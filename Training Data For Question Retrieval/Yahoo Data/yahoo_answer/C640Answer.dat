You can research any activity and know what to expect in theory, but the first time you do it, you aren't necessarily going to be a pro.    Even first time sex between non-virgins is awkward.  You don't know what they like, they don't know what you like.  And if you've never done it before, YOU don't know what YOU like!|`|96HWpdkFaa	Sex hurts for females the first time..not to scare you..actually the first few times!     Good luck...try to just have a good time make sure he's not to rough on you bleeding for a female is normal for a first time. So if you have to stop in the middle don't be embaressed just let him know!|`|CuGAYMlbaa	princess your putting a lot of logic into this just relax and enjoy it the first time|`|agTCqkLDaa	The only awkward thing for me is that I had all of these expectations and then he wanted me to get on top...that's weird for your first time, but just go with the flow.  He wasn't a virgin so that helped, but it's pretty easy to figure it out.    Good for you for waiting.|`|PyUDK9IGaa	it will be awkward no matter what you know but probly better|`|VUvfWG7Eaa	this isn't a high school exam or rocket science, you put part A into part B and or part C and go nuts, like I always say if it feels good do it, as long as nobody is being hurt or forced.|`|5r2Csdzwaa	I can provide some personal training for you.

As for oral sex, all I had to do was go down there and everything came out natural. Don't be afraid, after the first time your going to want it all the time. Sex is fun and it is hard to wait that long so make it special.|`|ruczpWrGaa	Ok firstly i really hope hes worth it.  My first time was worth it and i am one of the few of my female friends who can look back and say i dont regret it.  Anyways, you can research all day long but it doesnt translate so well from paper to practice.  Just relax,  take deep breaths and relax some more.  Its ok to laugh and make it a fun experiance.  It will be enjoyable when you are comfortable.   Keep condoms handy and when you are both ready and comfortable, it will happen, dont rush it.
ce060a29a8e7cbb3f7cdc004ec90adc3aa	Bunny, Accept what he says about being fine as the truth and then continue your conversation with him. Try to steer the conversation onto positive things. Ask him about the day. If he say it's rainy, then just casually mention how much fun it would be to go and splash in the puddles, like when you were young kids. If he says it's foggy, mention the fun things you used to do when you were kids in the fog. In other words, for every negative thing he says, bring up something positive and pleasant about that topic. Show him that even when things seem the bleakest, that there ARE things to enjoy about it as well. Don't contradict him about all the negative things, simply bring up the positive things about those after he mentions the negative things.     In other words, GIVE him the permission to BE a gloomy Gus but simply make your OWN Cheeriness be that lifeline which he is desperately seeking from somebody, anybody. He will do one of two things, he will either begin to find the positive side of things arond himself, OR, he will become so annoyed by your cheerfulness that he wil blurt out what really has him in such a blue funk.    If the first thing occurs, your problem is pretty much solved. If the second thing happens, let him unload it all onto you. If his depression is really bad, you will be able to help him to find the help that he needs, and it doesn't necessarily have to be professional and costly psychiatric help. There ARE other ways to get a person to the right source of help. JUst be diplomatic and nonconfrontational AND NOT in a condescending manner. You may even offer to go with him and accompany him for a few sessions until he feels comfortable doing so on his own. IN other words, do not intrude but simply BE there for him as a friend. To do anything else would simply be a tiny push in the wrong direction. He has to be gently and caringly guided to come to his own decision to seek the help that he may need. You can't force him to seek it, especially if he is in denial now, or behaving in a defiant manner. You have to gently help him to make his OWN decision to seek help.    I hope this will help your friend.    Brightest Blessings,  Raji the Green Witch|`|5IkZ64aFaa	It sounds like your friend is in need of a lot of help right now.  You're a good friend to care for them like that.  If they are thinking about suicide ask them if they have a plan and the means to follow through with their plan.  If they do, you need to get them to your local emergency room.  I don't know how old your friend is, but if they're underage you need to tell their parents immediately.  If they are old enough and refuse to go to the ER then call 911.  They will come out and do a welfare check.  Your friend won't be in trouble, they will just get him help if he needs it.  If you want further help you or your friend can call 1-800-448-3000. That's the   to a crisis line that avail. 24/7.  They can help you also.  Counselor KB|`|84928ac1d63b4b6f5acf3070843fb849aa	Do you know of any little things that your friend likes or used to like? For instance, chocolate chip cookies. Just something for a little token to perk him up some and remind him gently that he matters.     Let us know if anything works.  Best wishes.|`|1899aea197e9521ce9a275c00c477c75aa	After thinking about this .... well I think  the time for tact is past.  I would just march up to him and be very frank.   Tell him what you have noticed, let him know that you consider him a friend and would hate to think that he would think of doing something like this.  Tell him that many would miss him and if he is open to it ....perhaps he would like to go with you to see someone who could help him if he wants it.  Just lay it out on the line... if he snarls at you or denies it... tell him okay but let him know that if he wants to talk you are a phone call away, day or night... just to talk.      If the worst happens... well that is the path he has chosen.  Don't let it hurt you too.  People who choose a long term solution to a short term problem...are some times just being selfish.. or they make this sort of decision and frankly if they are adults.. I respect their right to make decisions that are this life altering.  Sorry.. many will disagree with me but do we really have the right to mess with another's will?      All you can do is let him know that you have concerns and that you are there to help if he needs it.  None of us want to feel like we are out there all alone.  It is a hard call to know what to do in a case like this.  What ever you decide don't eat yourself up if it doesn't work out.  After all you did try.  Good Luck.|`|FBPAIT0Zaa	I don't think you should contact any professional services behind his back. If and when he finds out, he will think you have been doing things that doesn't concern you, even if it does. Talk to him, and when he pushes you away, make him hear you out. Or write a letter if he doesn't listen to you. Exlain everything you've just explained to us, and tell him that you will always be there for him. He needs a lot of reassurance right now. Good luck|`|crtSLaJ2aa	sometimes just a hug can lift your soul and your spirits, your friend will ask for help once he can accept that he needs it.   rainbow blessings coming your way x x x|`|xV87GZNAaa	From what you say I suppose your friend is indeed shutting himself off and he will continue to push people away because that's what people in his state do. The more you try to get close to them, the more they'll push you away. he needs some time alone to figure things out, he needs to work this out on his own. I know it must feel terrible to feel impotent, unable to help someone you care about but you know that people are the ones to make choices about their lives and only he will know when it is time to move on and to feel better.  You just need to be there for him without invading him for as much as you may want to help him.  Medication is not the best thing to turn to, if I may say. Try not to force him to talk, he'll talk to you when the time is right. You must learn to be patient. I can assure you that being with him will be of great help, specially now that some of his friend may start deserting him, and the fact that you spend some time with him will open him up but you just need to give him time, he'll talk.  Good luck, hope you can give him a hand.
JuNf9cnJaa	that is never a nice situation..... Honestly, those type of people are obviously very insecure and have a lot of problems at home to have to act like that.  Perhaps you can speak with a guidance councillor at school in private and take this a little more seriously then not.  Teachers don't take abuse lightly, and nor should they.  I know your probably thinking "I don't want to look like a snitch".  But that is EXACTLY the fear that person put on you by fighting with you in the first place.  Give that bully a run for her money and get the teachers involved... that is what they are there for... and if she says something about it down the road,.. then say "Look, if you don't like getting in trouble for things like this, then perhaps you should control your anger more, as I am not one to sit here and take that crap EVER!" and walk away.. do NOT give her the satisfaction of ANYTHING, keep in mind if the teachers do something about it, that means her parents know, that means she is getting in crap at home too, and is most likely seriously regretting her actions.    Good luck!!!|`|Jzr8UmFKaa	Poor thing - people can be so cruel.  Ignore her - if it get out of hand get near other people

You let it slip without any malice and she's making such a big deal about it.  Had she been a little more forthcoming with you, this situation would not have arised.  Do you know why it was a secret, has she told you ?    She has become a little paranoid, I believe.  There is something more important that is on her mind.  Stop apologising and get to the bottom of the real problem.|`|Fu9tlKbhaa	Maybe try and sit down with her for the LAST time and just explain to her the situation and say look this is what happened and that's all that was said or done.

It seems she takes things way too personally and/or there is something she hiding about the babies father she doesn't want anyone to know and is paranoid.|`|xzl9njBXaa	Nothing, shes going to think what she thinks regardless,probably because you sold her out for nothing.Keeping silent on a certain topic is not hard,just put yourself in the other persons shoes.How would it be for you?

1235333b4f34f1147fc81bf4aef8885baa	Really liberating and really restricting all at the same time!<br>  <br>  It was definitely cool to make my own rules.  It's fun to not have anyone telling you what to eat, or when to go to bed, or monitoring when you come and go.<br>  <br>  It's not so cool when you realize that all that nagging your parents did about turning off the lights and finishing all the food on your plate is because bills, well, they really suck and wastefulness is not a good thing.<br>  <br>  Having my own place was a really good thing for me.  It taught me a lot of responsibility.  Not only just in terms of being able to pay my own bills, but also in terms of my understanding that I was the one responsible for my own choices.  When I didn't have anybody to rebel against, I sort of lost the will to rebel.<br>  <br>  However, the downside to all that was that, after a while, coming home to an empty house got pretty lonely.  I tried having roommates for a while, some were great, some not so great.  Eventually I got married and now I totally miss coming home to an empty house sometimes :P  With three kids and a husband, I don't get a lot of alone time, but I wouldn't trade it for the world.|`|psFBlHmVaa	if you have your own place with just you, it always going to be exciting cuz you have your own rules no one tells you what to do, every decision you make on your own, it is scary if your not used to being by yourself i always keep a radio on a phone nearby and sometimes a tv on just for the noise. but you get used to being alone, and when your out and you say you want to go home, you can go home netime you want without having to answer to anybody go to YOUR PLACE,and relax.|`|dUNajLjLaa	I moved out of my parents as soon as I turned 18! While living at my parents house my dad always charged me "rent" for my own room I would pay him $100 plus $50 for food and I had to pay one utility bill. <br>  <br>  I decided IF I was paying for my own stuff while leaving with my parents why not get my own place. So, I did and it was the best decision EVER. <br>  <br>  It was hard at first YOU really, have to watch your expenses and be responsible.|`|2RPtsrQGaa	havent yet lol|`|7iEk06aDaa	I didn't leave home, it was more like, throw me in a school for bad girls, and don't ever come back. I was on my own at 17 and it was SO hard. But anything was better then being at home, so I got a job, lied and said I was 18, rented a crappy apartment, and did the best i could. Thank God for grandmothers, that's for sure. She would come by every week with a care package for me. To this day, at 92, even though I am WAY beyond needing any help, my grandma still asks me if I need anything.

kUE3Ddktaa	I don't know anything about that company but my best friend has a moissanite engagement ring and it's truly gorgeous. People always mistake it for diamond and she is proud to correct them, because moissanite (created in a lab) is guaranteed conflict-free and looks just as beautiful as a natural gemstone.|`|kj507W26aa	I love their ring selections. But I have one concern:<br>  <br>  << Moissanite is an incredible near-colorless jewel with more fire and brilliance than any other gemstone on earth. Second in hardness only to diamond, Moissanite is durable and tough and it is in a class of its own with twice the fire as diamond. An eco-friendly and 100% conflict-free jewel, Moissanite is extremely resistant to scratching, abrasion, breaking and chipping>>. <br>  <br>  I would call customer service or the store directly and ask questions. Is it a diamond, or cubic Z or what the hell.|`|rNsCkHEwaa	To answer Gem's question:  Moissanite is not a diamond, not a cz.  It is a man-made stone in a class of it's own.<br>  <br>  The Moissanite that this website sells comes from Charles and Covard.  C & C gives you a lifetime limited warranty against the stone loosing it's brilliance.  <br>  <br>  Moisanite is beautiful!  It is much more affordable than a comparable diamond.|`|fb52aec114b2a6279348a5cf16976b41aa	Moissanite is a lab created stone to look like diamonds. Moissanite does occur naturally but that is rarer than diamonds. <br>  <br>  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moissanite" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moissanite</a><br>  <br>  IMHO - get a real diamond.|`|0LSuFk4Qaa	yes i have a 3 stone princess cut diamond ring. i have had it for about 3 years never had any problems with it the company was fine to deal with.|`|YZokRYWcaa	i couldn't find any negative feedback, and i tried. kudos to you for choosing moissanite, for so many reasons. they're beautiful!

3fa8c76451ac097cfc9f0493ed007f54aa	I too am still extremely self conscious of my own chest size (or lack there of!) with my boyfriend. We have been together 2 1/2 years and still I cover up and feel awkward around him. I am constantly commenting to him about other girls chests (famous people, strangers) and how they are so much more attractive because of it. The only advice I can give is to keep reassuring her that she is fine the way she is. My boyfriend constantly is giving me compliments and saying that I don't even know what guys really like and that what I have is perfect. Even though honestly I feel like he's just saying that because he has too, it does help alot. I guess the media/magazines/movies all tell us girls that bigger IS better and that bigger chests means you are more attractive. I guess I know deep down its not true, but sometimes it is hard to accept it. Make sure she knows you love her for the way she is =D|`|aiRn2lQGaa	then talk to her about it. most girls get really insure about that. i know i used to be that way and i finally found someone who loves me the way i am and would actually be upset if i altered myself. honestly she needs to be comfortable with herself|`|9289bf36b0092af9fa7aa94f40349863aa	you should tell her that it is on and that you love her for who she is... and that you love her boobs!! let her know you would rather her size, and that it is perfect for you.<br>  <br>  Ree|`|EEowYuNQaa	dude just tell her to get a boob job and then just dance it'll be ok|`|aZbmiYk3aa	It would be a good idea to re-assure her that you care about her overall as well as letting her know you love her body exactly the way it is. There is nothing about her in every way that you would change.<br>  <br>  She probably is very embarrassed about the  incident so it probably is a good idea not to mention it. But compliment her on every aspect without over doing it. She would sense the dishonesty if you are not sincere... good luck. Hope everything works out.|`|392b18ae97259a7518f51868eb7ea463aa	Good on ya for realizing that there is more to a girl than the size of her boobs. Stick with her, keep showing her that you appreciate her for her. It might take time, but get her to see the value in herself by showing her all the good and meaningful things that make you happy to call her your girlfriend.|`|omZzhx4Gaa	don't mention it for a few days, then gently bring it up and then take her in your arms and tell her you love her just the way she is :) it will take time for her to get over what happened but if your relationship is strong enough you will make it through|`|RyYumX0Aaa	First you need to talk to her let her know you love her body and reassure her she is beautiful.

l3kI29ywaa	It depends on how long it's been. I'd give her about a week (4-5 days) *just in case* something is really up. <br>  <br>  But I mean...if she became your "girlfriend" at a party on a whim or if she hasn't known you for long...you should just give it up as a lost cause.<br>  <br>  Check first though ;)|`|AqAxjdEuaa	I think you should try not calling her back or anything and see what happens. <br>  If she hasnt contacted you within like a week, then i would say to just forget her :P haha<br>  <br>  good luck! :)|`|60qeP4Epaa	if she moved on than you should too.|`|vvB0Etysaa	Hi:<br>  It depends how long you to have dated.  If she is not returning your phone calls that means she is not interested in you anymore.<br>  <br>  You can also ask her girlfriends what the problem is and if she has found someone else.  Girls do gossip among each other just like the guys.<br>  Good Luck
lzcglDnMaa	My husband is the same way. He only wants sex every now and again. I have asked questions on here about it and people have told me that he might have low testosterone. Well, we are going to go see a doctor about it hopefully tomorrow. This is problems that can be fixed. Talk to him about it and see if he will go see a doctor. A simple blood test will tell you if the testosterone is low. I feel like you unwanted, but according to my husband it is not me. He just has no sex drive. I am sure your bf thinks you are quite sexy, he just has no drive and you have to find a way to build it up again. How old are you? I am 26 and my dh is 33. They say a man's sex peak is in his early 20's. A woman's is from 25 to 30. Well, good luck to you and hope you get a better sex life in the future.|`|1854fb53779c38ad23e299fcc95f6010aa	Needed? Do you think that's all you are there for ? Give yourself some credit. He might have some sort of medical issue ( you didn't say how old you 2 are . If its nothing like that then make the first move more aft en , dress sexy , try something new and then carefully talk to him about your needs without making him feel as if he is not enough man for you , were fragile you know.|`|ygccpU2paa	If his sex drive is bad now, it's probably going to to be really poor as time goes by.  You may want to suggest he see his doctor and get a checkup.  If it's not physical, then maybe it's emotional--stress from work or other problems--but regardless, chances are if he's already a sexual dud, he's never going to be a super sex machine.|`|70kh6VSoaa	talk to him or just try having sex with him he doesn't have to come on to you put the moves on him|`|CQsD09D6aa	Side action. If he does not want to have sex with you then find someone who will.|`|Ybhgy5A1aa	There is nothing wrong its natural.|`|tIFXgawmaa	its getting old thats why. It does not mean hes not into you though. You should go get a new hairdo or somthing, like dye your hair a different color or somthing. Or go to the gym and get in shape if you arent already. Or walk around house with nothing but underwear ( that only works if you are somewhat physically fit though). It worked for me when my girlfriend did that stuff.|`|YXRRpodKaa	Well, Best thing to do is to talk to him about it. Initiate that you want it more. Maybe he's bored, try spicing it up with flavored lube or whatever. He could be masturbating to relieve himself and that could be why he's not into it as often. Won't know what it is until you discuss it. Good luck!|`|I5zi7mhzaa	Easy solution honey. Move next door to me. Between days 7 to 10, say days 1,2,3,4,5,and 6 sneak over to my house and you will live happily ever after.
Xw0pFjRpaa	why would any guy go for a bit**? evry normal guy goes for the nice girl unless he's desperate lol its a bonus if ur generally nice girl has naughty tendencies (sum really nice girls might do it just to turn her guy on) lol, i wouldn't want my girls too nice though lol :P|`|otEoK2e5aa	I'm a girl, but I always hear - even from my exes that they'd love to have a nice girl.  I guess I always hear this from men though because I've always been a goodie-goodie girl.  Seems like guys go through this phase, just like girls, where they think that overt confidence and sexiness is most important in a relationship, but that typically fades.  Just like how girls usually revert back to the sweet and nice guy, guys do the same with girls in the end.|`|mPqgfEhNaa	this is what i've always thought:<br>  they want the bitches to have fun<br>  and they want the good girls for a serious relationship :)<br>  <br>  because obviously bitches aren't gonna be faithful to them lol <br>   but probably not. all my guy friends say that they HATE bitches. & i sometimes feel sorry for them because for some reason they always seem to fall for them...literally ahaha but like some people have already said some good girls are really shy. so yea<br>  <br>  <br>  ?, Lily|`|146iNd9Iaa	haha, hell no.  funny you mention it because my buddies and I were just having a convo about how all the annoying bitchy girls end up at our school.

"bitchy" is overkill.)|`|j7kdn0JAaa	tht question doesnt even compare. of course nice girls because they dnt flirt with you every two seconds and they leave you alone for a while. bitches are obsesive and usually are despret|`|SOMwyDhXaa	they want a confident woman that doesn't compromise her morals.

There's a actually a fine line between a girl that argues with a guy and a ***** that bitches on a guy.<br>  <br>  so no. at least i don't think they'll prefer bitches over nice girls.|`|d9CjzWotaa	Girls like bad boys because they have no self esteem and guys like nice girls because they have self esteem.|`|8uMXFWgyaa	I don't like difficult women. I like crapping all over them.|`|PEN3hha7aa	if it's not a big deal then why ask all those questions?<br>  <br>  the only good thing about a witch is that her broom gets much better gas mileage than a nice girl's car...<br>  <br>  guys like nice(R) girls but not always nice girls.  every personality needs some play in it.  feisty, ornery, playful and even sarcastic sometimes (to prove a point) works.<br>  <br>  take what i told one of my students one time.  her opinion was that "all men are pigs and just want sex".  ok. then i ran this scenario past her:  lets say you and your gf or some woman for that matter get along really well in bed.  the sex is great and it seems to last forever.  all the good stuff, ok?  what if, after 5 minutes of being out of bed, she turns into a raving ***** with the attitude, no personality and the whole 9 yards?  what guy is going to want to be around her, and what else is she good for except sex?<br>  <br>  I bet there are some guys out there that just look for bitches/pain in the *** women and get them in bed on purpose just to make their lives miserable later.  then they go home the next morning and laugh about it.  some guys are just as mucked up as women are.
E3OHnv7Raa	YES! Of course it's normal! It means that you're really good friends. I had this problem once.|`|A08maaXJaa	we always want to a best friends but main think that dnt make friends b4 understanding$ dnt break afriendship after  missunderstanding|`|UdtqScGkaa	This is not weird AT ALL! I have the same situation with my best friend. Hes a guy and we always talk on the phone and online about relationships, girlfriends, girl drama, girl problems, and his same stuff with boys. Although I do love all my friends who are girls, sometimes talking to him is so much easier. He never tells secrets lol, hes really calm and gives good advice. I think its totally normal for you to have this type of relationship with a boy, I mean sometimes I even ask him for advice about guys and hes totally honest. I love talking to him and seeing him because hes funny and loyal. Having a close guy friend can be just a good, if not better than all your drama filled girlfriends.|`|QXMCWWAWaa	This is a very close relationship but I think it is a good one! Yes it is normal to have a really good friend! And don't listen to anyone else, you aren't bi. Your relationship with him  is totally normal.

fYDX6Ugiaa	I hate to say this, but most men (myself included) notice a woman's looks first. When choosing who to hit on, most men would pick an attractive woman over a less attractive one.<br>  <br>  However, if I got to know a sweet, smart girl, we'd probably start out as friends, and maybe things would progress from there. I'm not very aggressive when it comes to dating, so I usually start out as friends with anyone to begin with. I guess it depends on the guy; but for most, a woman's attractiveness is more important.|`|f79c26b7044dd5c4e629f481f9756330aa	yes its better to have a smart girl then a nice stupid girl|`|DD3hrcq1aa	no guys are shallow|`|a119a4ca8284696402c0f6ed3c9da428aa	She better be funny.<br>  <br>  Well I'm 23 and single so me personally would not like her as a girlfriend but I'd smoke weed with her if she's cool and encourage her to keep trying to find that special one.

Talk to her and tell her you don't feel you can wait till summer to be able to live a normal life.    Try to find a relative (like your uncle) who could let you stay with them till summer. You need to go talk to him yourself if possible and let him see how serious the problem is for you. Call him on the phone if you can't go to his house. Don't leave something so important to your cousin. This is YOUR life, not hers.    Tell your mother what you want to do, and understand that you should offer your uncle some financial reimbursement for your room and board if he agrees. (He may or may not accept it, but it's wise to offer.)    If you are able to go live with him and your cousin, be on your best behavior. Help with chores, clean up after yourself, and be pleasant.    Keep in close touch with your mom till she's ready to leave, and you should be okay.    Trust me - she won't be mad at you, as she knows it's her responsibility to take care of you, not your responsibility to take care of her.    Good luck to you.|`|5K1WNuNJaa	Take your mom with you.

Just some advise from someone whose father singed off on her. Don't do it. The only one who feels hurt and abandoned is the child. Even though your childs father is a deadbeat now, there is still the future ahead and someday your child will go looking for the dad asking why he 'signed off' on him. It hurts to know that your dad just signed your life away like so much garbage. I found my dad, and after getting out all the hurt I felt at his actions when I was a child, now him and I are the best of friends. As far as the child support, I'm pretty sure there is a program for child support arrears that gets you the money. I would look into it online or call legal aid. Also if you violate him at the child support office, especially since he owes you so much, they will take steps to see that it comes out of his income tax, suspends his license, or garnishes his wages.|`|BvJKu7cGaa	your best bet would be to contact a lawyer and find out how to go about it and see what your options are. i live in illinois and a friend of mine took her ex to court and he owed her like 30k also, she won and he has to pay her, it comes out of his pay checks and goes directly to her. i think she gets like 500 a month. i don't know how they would do it if he doesn't have the 10k upfront. probably make him pay payments, i doubt the state would "front him a loan" you could say. as far as signing over rights, he would have to agree to do that, but it could be something you can request at the next court date with the judge and lawyers. i hope it works out for you good luck!

If you can afford it, I would recommend you and he go talk to a family lawyer about his legal rights, and to review their custody terms.  He may want to file a modification of custody/visitation with the courts that better spells out what his rights/responsibilities regarding the coparenting agreement are.  This way, it should limit how often he and the ex have to talk about drop offs, pick ups, bills beyond the child support, etc etc.  The lawyer will also help him feel more empowered about his rights and make him less vulnerable to the ex's power plays.
VZVGXRyraa	The best thing you could do is to sit her down and to talk to her about your worries and concerns. You obviously trust her enough to tell her such a big part of your past, so talk to her about it.<br>  <br>  I was molested by my babysitter when i was 6, it had the biggest affect on me and i've told, maybe, 2 people outside of my parents (i'm 20 now). I told my fiancee about it about a year and half ago, she just made me feel comfortable enough to be able to tell her (we weren't together at that point, just friends) but afterwards i was afraid about what she thought also. So i sat her down, and explained how i was feeling and she reassured me that i had no control over what happened and that she knows i'm not that kind of guy and that i could never do that to anyone. She made me feel 100 times better by that talk. And we still talk about it occasionally when it gets me down.<br>  <br>  Just like my fiancee is there for me, your friend is there for you.

ff700543f3408186155eccc4290362b5aa	With one boyfriend I had, it was the first slow song we danced to at a club. <br>  With my husband, we have been married for 20 years, and do you know we don't have one? Terrible! I know! He is not as sentimental as I am. I would think it was our bridal dance song, but I don't even think he remembers what it was!!! Oh how sad is that? (sigh) But he is a great husband, and father and we love each other so much, I guess its not a big deal.<br>  If you really would like one though, it could be a love song that both of you really like, and you could say, "this could be our song!" just to hint at it. Or for a little gift, you could find a song, and put it on a cd, and give it to him, and write a little note, and say I think this should be our song, because it reminds me of Us and how happy you make me" or something like that. Oh, does that sound sappy? HA! I am sappy I guess. I guess it could be what you end up picking for your wedding dance.<br>  Good luck!|`|x6TEqf1yaa	it really depends. If there was a song playing when the guy first asks a girl out, then that could turn into their song. THats how it was with me and my girl.<br>  It really depends though. Not all couples have a song, and it is not necessary at all, but its sometimes nice lol.<br>  Its just a song that reminds you of your lover everytime you hear it. <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  good luck!|`|5b11def76967d62059b5c3c3cba31cf2aa	Me and my bf had our song after a couple dates when they played "Brown Eyed Girl" and started singing along because it reminded him of me...:)|`|Jusnu14oaa	when both of u like that song duhh|`|AA11944397	The best way to establish a song is by letting it happen naturally.  <br>  For example, me and my man established our song because we both like it, and find ourselves singing it together when driving it in the car.  It's an unusual song for a couple but ours is "Out of This Club" by Pussycat Dolls.  We didn't necessarily set out to pick a song for us-but after noticing that we both sing to it all the time in the car, it seemed perfect for the two of us.  <br>  I know a lot of people like to establish a song based on what song a restaurant plays when they go on their first date, or what song was playing on the radio when they had their first kiss, or if they share a favorite song...etc.  <br>  Don't force it, don't go looking on iTunes for a song for the two of you-it really defeats the purpose.  Just let it happen naturally.<br>  Good question by the way!|`|MvzrzDSNaa	Me and my boyfriend have a song... we got it because after we broke up, he told me he was listening to this song and it really reminded him of me and it made him tear up. (its come on get higher by matt nathanson. amazing song!) So i listened to it and it did the same thing to me. After that we both realized we needed each other and we got back together... It was so sweet...|`|T6Dgmxmoaa	My boyfriend and I don't have one and we've been together for two years. He always says "they're playing our song!" whenever we go out and there's music playing. So now it's just a joke and we have no song.|`|ENZVi0Ptaa	Most couples I know don't have songs...usually pick a song for your wedding.<br>  <br>  I guess when you find one that means something to both of you|`|4qWnVPqOaa	well me and my girl friend picked a because of experiences... her dad wouldn't ler her see me so our song was love story by taylor swift|`|dI6jfLM9aa	if me and my boyfriend are talking on the phone and just talking abot music or something, then we'll say " ohh i know these lyrics" and just start yelling them into the phone :)) good times..|`|a5c553f88ddc5e6ae111a11b956e0d57aa	i agree with peuhh not till im married or till i like someone enough to remmber the damn tune.|`|tA1ztvXaaa	when choosing the first dance at the wedding reception anything else is superficial|`|AA11192573	I believe that's up to the couple. My ex and I went out for two months but never had a song. My boyfriend and I had liked each other for a while, but remained friends since he was going out with another girl. He showed me the song "Your Guardian Angel" by the Red Jumpsuit Apparatus, which I came to love. I recommend it to anyone who likes soft rock. But about a week into our relationship, a few people started asking us what our song was. So he thought of three songs, which were: "I'm Yours" by Jason Mraz because we would always listen to it together, "Canon in D" by Pachelbel because he would always play it for me when I was down (he plays guitar), and "Your Guardian Angel" because it described us pretty well, since we constantly look out for one another. He asked me to choose. I decided that I wanted to be able to sing it with him, and Canon doesn't have any words, so that was out. I'm Yours is too overused and can be awkward at a few parts, so I didn't choose that. I went with Your Guardian Angel, and that's been our song ever since.|`|vRuNSY8Oaa	It's a song that has something special that connects you two.  My ex (<a href="http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index?qid=20090222194450AAhQXJ2">http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index?...</a> ) and it's CHeck Yes or No by George Strait.  His grandfather died about a year ago.  The day he died, I didn't know he died until later that day, I stuck a note in his locker with the lyrics on it because they were stuck on my head from him and I rocking out (as best you can) to it earlier that morning.  So now whenever that song comes on, we kinda grin at each other and enjoy it. <br>  Then we sang the song "Amazed" by Lonestar together and that's our other song.  One that I reserve for him...  If you get a chance, please feel free to drop your link on my Q but give me some advice, what do you think?|`|iKjsR79paa	when you both have one song stuck in your head for no reason at all... and you both heard it when you were out....THATS YOUR SONG its not a time frame when u establish one... it just happens|`|dvejYHIeaa	i think its b/c the song explains there relationship or b/c it has a meanin about there relationship to it|`|N9bLX382aa	u kinda just let it happen like when something happens that has to do with a song|`|60qeP4Epaa	when you  here a song that reminds you of ur significant other|`|yn58CCYlaa	NEVER!|`|4dXcZhuTaa	PUH.<br>  Not until i get married.|`|8uMXFWgyaa	that sounds gay
SsfnitjXaa	With a wrap your diamond has to sit a lot higher than normal.  I have exactly the same ring and have a thin white gold band.  I would rather people look at my diamond then my band.  Who wants to "upgrade" their wedding ring (as suggested above) you want to keep the original as you want to keep your original husband.|`|kj507W26aa	Pick what you like.  It doesnt have to match or be part of a matching set. Pick something you like, try it on and if YOU like it , then there, there is your ring.|`|PBdPD748aa	because it is a solitaire (like mine) i would definately go with a diamond wedding band.<br>  <br>  it really does bring out your diamond without over taking it (cos there are no side stones).<br>  <br>  i would go a channel set and i would probably keep it to round diamonds (or u could go princess diamonds).<br>  <br>  here is an example of what i am talking about, not the best pic but you get the idea!!<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.gemdiamond.com/images/containers/579.jpg" rel="nofollow">http://www.gemdiamond.com/images/contain...</a>|`|1hciyvKdaa	It will be your choice, but me, I would have the metals match. I would think that with looking at many many rings you might find one that melds more with the other ring. A good way to see lots of rings without leaving home is look on ebay. Im not saying buy online, but on ebay you can look at thousands of styles so easily. I do it with purses all the time!!! Then you can print out a pic to keep with you to ask jewelers if they have something near that look. There are so many jewelers online too to search through. Although Id be scared to buy from a no brand site with no way to tell how honest they are in the quality and with thier return policies when deailng with that much money.|`|TNH8QMOaaa	Try <a href="http://www.b2cjewels.com/weddingrings.aspx" rel="nofollow">http://www.b2cjewels.com/weddingrings.as...</a> they have some exquisite collection of wedding bands.

Do they even set rings in silver?|`|hKss8M9Raa	I got a wrap to go with my engagement ring and I LOVE it. It is sooo much prettier than a plain band. You can get one that is on both sides and your ring slips in the middle, or you can get one that is only on one side and has a small gap for the stone on your engagement ring. They also make a kind that looks sort of like a v that just fits up close to your engagement ring. There are lots of options. If you can get it from the same place your engagement ring came from that would be good because then you can get all your inspections done at once.|`|29gHY4U6aa	Maybe a wrap would look cute.

NJVm6dTiaa	You should tell her the truth, because once you start to lie, you weave such a tangled web that if another situation arises over this that you need her help and support with, you will feel unable to go to her because of the initial deceit. <br>  I know it doesn't feel like it, but you are so very young, and you really, really should keep your Mom informed about the people you are interacting with, and most especially your online friends. It's all too easy for practised paedophiles to create completely fake personas online, including fake photos, fake webcam imagery, and fake voice recordings. If you have given him your phone number, in particular your landline phone number, it allows him access to a whole host of other personal information about you. I do hope your online friend is honest and sincere, and not lying about his age, and I hope his intentions are strictly friendly. Online friendships can be absolutely wonderful, but it's so, so important not to maintain them in secrecy. If this guy's genuine and for real, he will have absolutely no concerns whatsoever about your Mom knowing all about him. Please tell her. You'll create an awful lot of hassle for yourself if you start lying about this.|`|uAzToWC7aa	actually, i hate to be the joykill, but you shouldnt of given the phone # cuz you dont know if he asked his friend to talk to you for him, so then he could track you down more easily ) :|`|MzEIoozyaa	I would say he moved to a different state.<br>  but please be careful... there's "weird" people out there...<br>  ik you said he's not a pervy old man but still... lol<br>  <br>  Hope I have helped (=|`|Gb47ZGNTaa	why tell her anything|`|DbDDl1x5aa	just tell her its a friend (that's not lying). and talk to him|`|70kh6VSoaa	my friend said she would tell her parents he moved|`|TKdDIu0Waa	try talking to him in detail and don't trust him completely and then tell your mom that you had got a buddy thro' chatting and once let your mom to chat with him!done!hope i helped yoU!
4WVUBnA6aa	I agree 100% with Janet W. The only thing I would add, is that these stupid family "freeze-outs" can fester and get magnified way beyond the original “issue” the longer they last. I have a friend whose parents got into a “no-talking” thing with her and her husband over how they were raising their kids (their kids are wonderful BTW) but the point is it started over something small but the longer it lasted, the harder it was for them to break the ice and start talking again. As hard and as painful as it is, you and your husband may want to try to find a way to break the ice, bump into them, etc so that it doesn’t take on a life of its own.|`|zu10q3Qyaa	I would hurt for my husband.  That was a pretty cruel thing to do.  I would tell my husband that I loved him and let him know that I thought what they did was selfish and childish and cruel.  If he knows he has you on his side it will help.|`|o0Badlndaa	seek help from family services they may send you to a Civilian attorney ... but do it now she is a menace ...|`|iD4ejChZaa	neither myself nor my husband would care about somebody's b-day party, their loss.|`|pVuNxfBZaa	I would be upset and I can only imagine how your husband must feel.

Maybe that would help them to open up the lines of communication.|`|vj2pWs9Maa	I would be angry and upset for them.<br>  <br>  This has happened to my partner by his family many times, it actually breaks my heart.

BeLWGBQxaa	I am a parent of two children.  I must agree with your statements.  I truly believe that a lot of parents are afraid of the government these days.  I have known of kids that threaten their parents with CPS at the drop of the hat. Many parents back down due to their fear of embarrassment. Others because of their lack of knowledge are afraid that Big Brother will step in and they will take their kids or the parents themselves will end up in jail or prison.  I don't believe in child abuse, but sometimes I think children and their behavior warrant a good swift smack on the butt. People are afraid to do it these days. My children don't always behave themselves at home, but they DO behave themselves when in public. When my child threatened to call the cops if I spanked her, I asked her if she would like me to dial the number.  I know the laws of my state and what I can and can't do. I never got threatened again....this was several years ago.  I will not tolerate bad behavior in public.  I think that if children cannot behave in public then they should be removed, especially at the movies.|`|7BG6eM7zaa	I have found the same problem with parents they days. They let their kids run around with no discipline at all.|`|Fwm6lHmpaa	bc of obama|`|iMNPH9I7aa	well my friend had sex and her mom caught her with the boy ontop  and all she did was grounded her for a day|`|tD2rVzFTaa	because of people like you|`|SPh4ctPCaa	Yeah I agree with you. It's getting out of hand. I'm 18 and it's annoying as **** to me if it's peaceful and quiet for me. I love peaceful and quiet for me. I think one of the reasons why is because the are afraid of getting sued by the public or their relatives. I don't know. It's all **** up I say. When I have kids and all I'm gonna treat them with respect and dignity to others and for them selves. If I ever have kids. Because I don't wanna be seen as a bad adult or anything and I just wanna do what is right and not wrong.|`|PmYpNontaa	"bc Obama". ...please don't be ignorant.  I think the unfortunate fact is too many people don't understand that giving birth/having kids is a privilege and not much thought is given in to what it takes to raise a child or how to even raise a child....it doesn't come by osmosis or "nature" .  In this day and age it's about learning and getting ready before the baby is made.  It's about respect for life.....and this is coming from a Pro-Choice person. Unfortunately, we have a society of people that don't know how to parent.....

First and foremost, you are not cruel or a bad person. So please do not be so hard on yourself.  The simple fact that you have regret is enough to show that you have a heart! People make mistakes and many many people in the dating world feel this way.  You are typically in it for the chase.  Because of that, right now a relationship is not what you should be looking for. If you are serious about rehabilitating yourself, do not get serious with a guy initially.  Set guidelines for yourself - 3 months or so of "dating" before starting an official relationship and maybe a "no sex" during that time rule.  If you can make it that long, something real is in place and it might be wise to press on. But it sounds like you loosing interest so quickly and not wanting to confront your problems is very personal. In this case I would suggest you stay single for a while and figure yourself out.|`|4WZMto1oaa	I just want to tell you that that can be very dangerous you cant play with people like that you are going to come accross the wrong person and they are going to go after you just be careful its for your saftey just think about it|`|3FjDT8yKaa	it's cruel, but i have the same exact problem<br>  <br>  idk why it happens. but maybe you should just lay off the guys for a while. until you know you REALLY like the person.|`|6N0LK74saa	your a prime exsample of why men should kill all women and jsut end the human race.  i hate you and all your messed up kind. you play games with other and see to hurt them by not understanding your true self.

They would hate it. They would hate the treatment of their in laws if the treatment were the same. They wouldn't tolerate it either. They'd either pack up and move out, or tell their wives to control their parents. See, men feel emasculated when they're not in control...by them, I mean their family too; but they just expect women to deal with it. Because hey, if u loved ur hubby, u'd deal with it, and know how to win ur in laws over. That's what my ex told me; but one day my mom just said something to him that angered him, and he gave her the most awful tongue lashing; and well, she lashed back. I got in trouble for not controlling my mom! But every time his mom yelled at me, oh, I must've deserved it, because she's wonderful to him and all others.<br>  <br>  Men can't take what they dish out. So if a man does put up with his wife's in laws, it's out of necessity, and he'll do whatever it takes to make his wife and her family happy, as long as they live under one roof. Oh, & that's caused problems too, & just like women in india, when the men face the same fate in the US, they're miserable too.|`|BfDM12ptaa	i see here that people dont even dare to answer......<br>  men know everything,but they just think they are superoir,if u ask such questions they have no clue how to react...|`|41519dcd613e198147ae134a0f6e6e78aa	Not in a patriarchal society.|`|uq9KBBPNaa	i think u going to be or already is a GHAR JAMAI...|`|s0j1D4n9aa	I don't want to be under anyone roof.

GuxPC1Kyaa	No, not at all.<br>  <br>  I'm 17 and I hate my parents, too. Not like sometimes, I've hated them for ca. 2 years like all the time.<br>  <br>  They only pay for a lot of stuff and take me with them everywhere (like on vacation) and they that's enough to be good parents.<br>  <br>  They are overprotective, too. They never let me hang out with friends, when I already go to a party, and it happens like twice a year, I have to be back at midnight, although that's when the fun actually starts.<br>  <br>  I am a really outgoing person and I make friends easily, but because of my parents, I have 3x less friends than my friends do. I was the only one to go to the prom without a girl. Do you know how it felt? My parents always let me know (because they never say it, they let me know, they like to do that) that school is more important than the teen life. They ruined what was supposed to be the best period of my life, the period of hanging out, making friends and having fun.<br>  <br>  They yell at me all the time, for even the tiniest thing, they can blame me for literally everything, whatever happens is my fault, they can not keep promises if they want to, they can humiliate me, whatever I say, they either yell at me or make fun of me. They think they are almighty and they can control me and do whatever they want to do and treat me like a thing 'because they are parents and I'm just !@#$%^&*()_. And I have to be like the happiest person alive because, as they like to say "everybody would like to have such good parents like you have". And whenever I get angry (and believe me, it doesn't happen often although it should), they say 'see - that's because we're too good to him!'.<br>  <br>  I just hate them.<br>  <br>  So, if your parents like mine are, no, it's not a bad thing.<br>  <br>  I'm afraid you can't do anything except for going to a college as far away from home as possible. That's what I want to do.|`|jtfBjK5Faa	depends if they dont care about u and trade u the wrong way i guess<br>  but if there tryin to the best for u and u dont like it i guess yess is bad!<br>  and if they didnt do anything wrong to u.u shouldnt hate ur parents because they raise u! and they lovee U! no matter what...<br>  <br>  there ur parents and always be on ur side!|`|Nh2xYpiWaa	My parents were & still kind of are when I was 12 too. I'm 15 now & my parents pretty much let me do whatever I want. <br>  <br>  I drive my parents crazy so they are eager to let me get out of the house as much as possible haha.<br>  <br>  WAIIIT? Your in 12th grade?<br>  <br>  Oh well then thats crazy. You didn't get your permit yet? Goodness. Maybe its because they don't want to pay for it. When your 18 I heard the classes are free.<br>  <br>  You should get a job, & then maybe they'll stop treating you like a kid & start treating you like an adult.<br>  <br>  :)|`|5VaTSogcaa	totally normal.|`|OtpI4YpQaa	its normal<br>  i hate my parents too sometimes<br>  but parents just love us :]|`|ikL5ZdfAaa	im sure its not a good thing|`|4fBXhYqSaa	i hate mine too.<br>  and i like your little title thingy<br>  dance 4 eva life when eva|`|7bf21413e2e3f54d05c3c67fc6e65a6eaa	only if they deserve it but if they don't then its probably just a phase|`|ph5OKsCLaa	Yes it is bad for you. I had serious problems with my parents during different stages in life. Still I don't hate them. I simply stayed away because I don't really want to have more problems. Though, running away doesn't fix any problems so the best bet is to search for professional help. Maybe you could go to your school counselor. I'm sure she/he could give you some hints on how to handle your driving license issue with your parents. Don't let your heart to suffer. Hating isn't healthy; love is. Life is too short so enjoy what it has to offer. Best wishes.|`|AA11967288	If you ask me, Hell no! Sometimes parents can try to live your life for you. They do things out of their norm that seems perfectly right to them, but makes us feel uncomfortable and sometimes angry! Prime example, my soon to be mother in law was telling my fiancee today that I shouldn't say " ***" around my kids! Despite these being my kids, and me working on this already within my relationship- she went further to say until he does- he shouldn;t be involved with his kids!!! What lady!!!!! Who are you?!!! I am feeling like I hate her right now, even though I know I don't really hate anyone. Sometimes parents can bring the worse out of you. So, I would say no; just try to make yourself like them whichever way you can! That way you will feel better inside!|`|DTxQ2Tpvaa	No it's perfectly normal, but what you don't know is that I hate your parents too. But what is not normal is that they love me.|`|eHrc9NPcaa	omg whats wrong with u people? yes it is bad to hate ur parents i mean every once in a while sure i hate mine too but u cant hate them forever. im sure they love u very much.|`|2xQiky3Aaa	No, that is perfectly normal.|`|0w8EmVjTaa	If they are good to you than yes.|`|e8kIn8rwaa	How old are you? and why do you hate them?|`|AA10817027	I more appropriate question might be "Do they deserve to be hated?".|`|M5oMYc9Laa	Sounds like they are loving you too much.  Yet, you hate them?  You have mentioned your learners permit twice.  You think life is supposed to be all about you -- a typical childish attitude. You feel grown up and want to be treated like an adult but have a very juvenile attitude, mad because you can't drive, calling your brother names -- not exactly what an adult does and then you wonder why they won't listen to you or let you drive.  Start with showing some maturity.|`|KkRb3paPaa	yes it's bad if you hate them. hate is a very strong feeling. i'm sure you love them but you DISLIKE them cause they get on your nerves sometimes. it's the same with almost everyone (including me)<br>  <br>  i don't hate me parents but i do dislike them sometimes.|`|iNtPA7X9aa	how old are you? if you are a teenager, then yeah, it's normal...but you only think you feel that way...when deep down, you actually love them.<br>  if you're in your thirty's or something, i would think there's a more legit reason to hate them.<br>  <br>  it's never good to hate your parents, btw.|`|bu6BhCnpaa	haha...no...and i guarentee that in a few years you will be liek i ant believe i hated my paresnt so much...tehy were right...<br>  <br>  <br>  i still think i twas wrong of my mom to shelter me so much and to keep me from hanging out with a certain group of friends...but had she not...i may not have been as motivated or become the person that i am today...|`|I0g24Jmkaa	You can strongly dislike your parents, but hate is a bit harsh.|`|qlcY8aKFaa	You should never hate your parents.

RBQrgByeaa	What was your DVD?|`|o0Badlndaa	get him to a psychologist he needs help fast|`|t26ctJdraa	maybe hes not even watching them cuz he's too depressed. i know wen i get depressed i just sort a lie there and dnt do anything. not even sex. wat about meds? wait i dnt understand wat is the question? is it about watching porn and materbating? or are u worried about his depression? if he dnt wanna hve sex w you its something else.just porn is not gonna satisfy him..id keep an eye on him. he needs meds for his depression.|`|LC8iYnncaa	maybe hes masturbating at porn.which is very degrading when he have you. Men Suck when it comes to porn. And honestly i think this whole Internet business is what ruin a lot of marriages|`|AMDoV0ecaa	LOL watch it 2gether me and my husband does and talk about it 2|`|7fAHPUkkaa	he is spanking it|`|1da4a2d0455c0102329b9db0565c3a34aa	It sounds coincidental.  Just because a guy needs to yank one down in between getting laid doesn't necessarily mean he's overdoing it cause he owns porn.  If he seems to be improving put the dvd in some evening and see if you get a reaction.  It was probably forgotten but would be a nice surprise to see again with you, a couple of cocktails and your best negligee.
1235333b4f34f1147fc81bf4aef8885baa	You're probably right.  Being a teenager with such a cool brother-in-law can be kind of intimidating.  I don't think you have a romantic crush, but you definitely are sort of crushing in a way.  Don't worry about it too much.  You will probably always think he's a cool guy, but the intimidation factor will decrease as you age.|`|bu6BhCnpaa	hhaahaha i definately know that feeling...<br>  <br>  its like...your too young to ever hang out and hes not related technically so its odd that he cares so much...and its nice but you dont know how to take it...and you feel liek its kinda fake so it makes you mad...becasue in any other situation he wouldnt be so nice...<br>  <br>  right?<br>  <br>  you just have to understand that its not any other situation...he is your sisters husband and so he has to like you and care about you...let yourself get close to thim...he might be able to help you out with dating and such later on...you will most likely grow out of that...your at a weird age where you cant be grown up but you want to be so you feel liek you cant relate to him on some levels....|`|5810e6ffd53a5af2e1a161b4d5ccf2e3aa	Low self esteem. You want to have something in common with him and your sister.Just remember you are younger and that is how they will treat you.|`|AA10817027	That problem has nothing to do with him, the feeling you get around him is merely a symptom.<br>  <br>  The problem here is that you don't realize how cool you obviously are. I mean, he sees something, so maybe you could try taking a closer look at yourself.|`|5VaTSogcaa	its cuz your young and he is older. i feel the same way about people in their 20s. think of it this way: what if you were older than him. feel the same? nope!|`|GtPnXzPAaa	Somebody has a cruuuush!!
231e2f619695988a9a2770ac10966cd2aa	Yes very possible, its happened to me.. i didnt almost brake my knee or anything, but i got alcohol poisoning and had to go to the hospital. i guess i was awake some of it, not of which i remember, but i guess i was out for at least 6 hours. its the craziest thing that has ever happened to me.. but hey, we learn from our mistakes! and it was when i was 14.<br>  <br>  no, there is no way to remember what happened. but when you hear all of the stories of what you did that night, you grow images in your head, making you think that you do remember.|`|5c70e4a7234f0be8642df55ef4a96e46aa	Oops, I did it again =P|`|WFRooU7Maa	Yeah, it is definately possible<br>  <br>  And there is not really a way to remember what happened|`|rHOHIdQKaa	Yea I believe it|`|PmYpNontaa	Yeah....it's call a blackout...not good.
ub6lxGPIaa	As long as it's only flirting and you know that the flirting won't lead to anything it shouldn't be a problem. However if the flirting leads to things such as you-know-what, then it should stop immediatly.<br>  <br>  if the flirting makes anyone unconfortable, it should stop ASAP, no questions asked, JUST STOP. If you and your spouse had made a commitment to each other to ne with each other because of your love, it should be tested by online fliritng like that.|`|xgWf3SKxaa	that happened to my uncle...|`|uff3kOoFaa	well i get why your spouse would get angry. but i dont think it would be something worth breaking up over<br>  so...if its ONLY flirting... no|`|xvUUdfxhaa	I would break up with someone if they were flirting with someone else.<br>  <br>  It really does depend on what your definition of flirting is.<br>  <br>  If you're like "What you wearing?" and the other person is like "nothing ;)" and you say "hot ;) lol" <br>  <br>  that's just silly flirting, everyone does that. But if there's serious flirting, with role playing or actually organising to get together...<br>  <br>  i would kick my partner to the curb so fast.|`|zwdGBrUZaa	it depends <br>  if the spouse is meeting up with that person, sending nasty pictures, saying nasty things, or saying i love you can be bad<br>  but before any breaking up happens<br>  there needs to be communication<br>  because maybe a lack of it casued this|`|bkgBLjuvaa	depends.. are you and this online 'friend.' getting personal?
gSo4dR7oaa	Yes, cheaters do make a mess of things, but what is important is what you do in response.  You have not done enough to change your situation.  By now, you should already be divorced, not still asking YA users what to do.  You and your kids would be much happier.  In fact, I am not even sure what you are asking today.  <br>  <br>  My advice, which I have given you many times before, is very simple, and only requires common sense to realize:  Get counseling.  Get a different attorney.  Get a divorce. You may not be happy with the terms, but at least the issue would be resolved, the terms would be on paper, and you could go on with your life, maybe even finding someone else to marry (eventually).   It sounds like you want credit for taking care of the kids, and your taking care of them is great, but you are not doing enough to resolve your situation and actually make things better for them and yourself. The longer you wait, the more you and your kids will be hurt by your "wife's" behavior.  Is that what you want? I'm beginning to wonder.<br>  <br>  (I'm sorry if this is not the answer you want, but it is the truth.  I won't just sit back and tell you what you want to hear,  because that would not be helpful to you or your kids. I'm just sorry I can't give you the motivation to do what you clearly need to do to improve your situation.)|`|elhcuN19aa	You was getting ran over when she was coming in at 12 2 times a week lol<br>  You should have told her to get to stepping and that you are not a fool....<br>  <br>  you should prove your case on why you would be a better parent than her....|`|C4bxnKDXaa	You need to start acting...instead of asking questions...give yourself some answers....make an action plan. It will takea  while man you are not thre yet. It took me a while to finally realize that my marraige was just not repairable. She was too out there. Even as she was cheating...right in my face I still had hopes and did what I could to make sure she felt like I still loved her and was there for her. Not anymore...I shut her out...and it has been tough! But I am strong enough now to keep her at arms length. There are stages you will go throuogh my friend...when you have had enough and you are ready to act, you will...it will take some more time...but you will act ...you will have enough eventually...and things will begin to look differently to you...and you will over come this mess...and be the warrior your kids always knew you were...and are!|`|S3UxNOhdaa	I am sorry for you. You are obviously the better parent. I would check with another attorney. Being an adulteress and coming in at all hours of the night does not constitute being a parent in any country. USA, England or Austrailia or Italy.  Please find another attorney, the next time she goes out of town and doesn't say where she is going..perhaps you could file for abandonment. Perhaps you have the means to hire a private detective to get photographic evidence for your case. Good luck..stop being her doormat to come home and wipe her feet on. You deserve happiness.|`|EdBCksSwaa	With the way she chooses to live it sounds like you will have the boys the majority of the time anyway,go ahead and file for divorce and get a 50/50 split.|`|1da4a2d0455c0102329b9db0565c3a34aa	You've thought of the complex, now here comes the easy.  Simply change all the locks of the house.  Once she sees this she will get a message.  Let her know you are done and if she wants to see the children it will be done legally and through the courts.  Once they see the situation for what it is they will most likely rule in your favor to the extent you wish for the most part.|`|kHRD7uUAaa	you sound like you want credit for taking care of your own kids (well if they are really yours)  stop the poor me you are not man enough to keep your woman satisfied so someone else is helping you out.|`|rLLyJtqNaa	I applaud you for being a good father and a loyal husband (despite the fact that she's a 6!tch).  <br>  <br>  It's seems that everything is being done on her terms and for her convenience.  Here's a suggestion:  perhaps it's time to flip the script, my friend.<br>   <br>  Don't get a divorce (at least not right now).  The next time that you know that she's taking off for an extended period of time, pack everything in your house and move.  Yes, move out. (You don't really have a common household because she's just visiting most of the time.)   Don't give her your new address; there's no reason that you should endure her emotional abuse.  After you've done that, invest in a mobile phone and give her the number so that she can keep in touch.  It shouldn't be a big deal to her anyway as it seems that she's not there half of the time.  She can have a different parenting style, just not at your expense.<br>  <br>  When she wants to see the children, arrange for a relative/friend to accompany them and have them meet her in a neutral zone (their house, restaurant, etc.)<br>  <br>  You don't have to cheat on your wife, but there's no harm in doing a little window shopping;  Heck, at least get a pen/myspace pal; it's just good to have someone to share life's ups and downs, vent, etc.<br>  <br>  In the mean while, continue to focus on the boys.  I wish you all the luck and prosperity that is due to you, my friend.|`|tMkt8IgIaa	Did not know there was guys like you left in oz <br>  <br>  Ok things work a bit differently here to the u.s<br>  <br>  You can not change the locks as long as her name is on the the house <br>  <br>  I would file for 100% care -you may not get it but you will get most<br>  <br>  Do you work if not make sure you aply for legal aid first <br>  <br>  Just do not let her know what your doing <br>  <br>  Make sure if it goes to court you ask that she does a parenting course|`|a66nvk0taa	Have your ever cheated on her? two sides to every story.<br>  Then she is a *********. But think you should get the kids full time. Let her go where ever she wants to go with her new man, and leave you and the boys in peace|`|a05818703edf627a70c2368c5b12f69daa	cheaters do hurt innocent persons, and devastate those who are unfortunate enough to be married to them. with my marriage to a cheater we had no children and i was able to move away, and know i would never have to speak or see him again, i can't imagine being tied to a person who hurt me. could u get her for abandonment, don't know the laws in your country. they seem to be unfair but given the morals of the world today, i can certainly understand why the courts would just give up on morals.
M5oMYc9Laa	First, move out.  Next, after you get out tell them that if they persist in being abusive (because that's what it is) then you will have to cut them off and disassociate yourself with them until they start respecting you.  Set firm boundaries and enforce them CONSISTENTLY.  As long as you are living under their roof unfortunately, you are at the mercy of the dysfunctional situation.|`|93r3nCM1aa	My parents are doing the same thing.<br>  <br>  They probably feel both left out and worried. Just keep them updated on your life. That doesn't mean you have to talk to them everyday about every little thing that went on, but at least talk to them on a weekly basis, and ask for their advice on things (even if its something you already know the answer to).|`|Ff7mCzlPaa	You have moved on with life and left home, obviously.  Sometimes parents can't hack it.<br>  <br>  You do have the right to ask  your parents why they are suddenly so rude.|`|69x3A1zwaa	if your not a teen anymore move out
4KuJaHeJaa	It's your responsibility to meet half way. You have to talk to the girlfriend first and have no argument for the sake of your old friend. Be the calmer person in the situation and don't rise to her instigation to fight. Through her is the only way you can make your old friend. If you don't think you can do that, maybe your friendship wasn't worth that much.
KSK22vHUaa	He'd have an advantage with me.

71fc8cbea5928669e06e7c42a2dd8046aa	From what you said, it sounds like you need to apologize to him. You accused him and then told him it was over, right?<br>  <br>  Its easy for things to get out of hand with people you care about. If he is still mad and will not talk to you, you will have to give it some time. A week, maybe a month, you will have to judge that. Once things have calmed down get together just the two of you and say your sorry and tell him you value his friendship. Unless he brings up the details of the event dont mention it.<br>  <br>  One last thing, be sure that you are truely sorry for your part in it. If your not don't waste either of your time.|`|E3OHnv7Raa	Even if you're right, I think you should have to apologize. One must apologize in order to save a relationship.
xvUUdfxhaa	You should kiss his bottom lip to start with until you can get a feel for how he kisses and copy it. 99% of people kiss how they wanna be kissed, so just copy.<br>  <br>  There's really no amount of practising you can do. It's like spelling "Like" as "lyk" and practising writing "lyk" over and over, if you aren't getting it right, doing it over and over won't fix it on its own.<br>  <br>  Just go slow, maybe one hand on the side of his face, kiss his lips, don't jam your tongue in, even though i can pretty much guarantee he will try to jam his in.<br>  <br>  in my experience, men can rarely kiss how we want to be kissed the very first time. it's always sloppy and awkward the first time. you're given a bit of a free pass when it's the first time two people have kissed together.<br>  <br>  and if he's all "you don't know how to kiss!" be like "well, i knew how to kiss the last guy i kissed, maybe your face is just stupid."<br>  <br>  :)|`|ImufuzQaaa	you kiss him real slow, <br>  dont add any tongue just yet, its too soon for that. <br>  Put your hand on the side of his face, most guys like that.<br>  Don't go to close, cause then your teeth will collide, which tends to be very awkward. But other than that, just relax, breathe, and you will do fine. Just dont think about it too much. Just remember, there is NO rush in making out. :)<br>  Best of Luck!|`|xTwWM6UFaa	k well im a natural, blessed thank god. but i know how my friends have messed up:<br>  dont open and close your mouth too many times, it get annoying<br>  and dont open your mouth so wide that your eating him, try to keep your lips with his lips.<br>  kiss him regularly once or twice, then add tongue.<br>  twirl your tongue around with his, kinda push against his.<br>  <br>  beginners stuff, you'll learn your own specialties the more you do it.|`|yA7EQIcUaa	not stupid at all . its normal to be nervous. but hes a secret - guys dont know how to kiss either ! he may be " more experienced " but that doesnt mean he knows what hes doing either. who really does. just kiss him gentally and let it linger. after that it usually just flows. hah and if you get lost just follow him. it will come naturally. theres no real step by step.|`|pUGgSk5laa	You don't sound stupid at all.  I 13 and just had my first real makeout.  I looked up "how to kiss" on youtube and found really helpfull videos.  Also just remember to keep a big mouth and puker up and have fun! You may not notice this but your body will just automatically take over. trust yourself!<br>  Good luck!|`|zMJDtFgGaa	Just by asking the question I'm assuming that you are way too young for anyone to answer "what do guys like? and how can I be really good at it?" Just kiss the dude and hell be happy.|`|zO59ezH3aa	Just relax and give him hints like tounge and if he doesn't get those hints than take control and kissing with braces isn't that bad|`|M34koGZgaa	just do it. hes probably just as self-conscience as you are, hes probably asking the same question on here|`|k3d5P5B7aa	Aww just go with the flow...follow his lead in you need to.|`|HlRWA3JHaa	just go with the flow and if you mess up simply say it's your first time.|`|0VLirxVtaa	Kissing and making out comes natural. All you have to do is continue to kiss. Trust me, it's not hard. When the time comes, you will know what to do.<br>  -Good Luck!|`|LNsVIV1naa	yeah not to brag about myself<br>  but i'm an awesome kisser<br>  it just happend naturally to me<br>  and awww<br>  i love it when guys ask if u want to kiss<br>  but umm practice on your hand<br>  like make a loose fist <br>  and there u go<br>  it doesnt really feel like lips<br>  lips taste much better|`|9fb74469d3f937feeed0a568c9da83feaa	Just go with the flow....|`|MxhJjSgLaa	silly, live and learn|`|4wAqwL3Caa	hey love<br>  omg you do not know how much i use to ask these questions on here & google them haha but seriously when the time came you let him take the lead and just copy what he does, everyone has their own kissing style (no 2 people have ever really been the same for me) and your best bet is to let him lead the first few times.<br>  <br>  Most kisses start with soft pecks on the lips, then he may touch your lips with his tongue (kinda probing his way in haha) when he does that (and if you want him to) open your mouth a little more and kinda nudge/massage each others tongues back and forth with your own..keep going and your making out! :)<br>  <br>  Basically, you cant mess up, you may clink teeth, but just laugh it off, go with the flow and you'll realize how naturally it comes to you :)<br>  <br>  Good luck !|`|rzei49A8aa	I had the same problem as you! I was so scared and was like omgomg how do you do it. But hun honestly It just hapenns, its hard to explain how you just go along with it. Dont worry about it eeverything will be fine! Just go with the flow|`|3FjDT8yKaa	everyone is shaped differently. dont worry about it<br>  <br>  but dont get naked w him soon if you dont even know how to makeout yet|`|2GdUvlMbaa	well i would just not make any noises. that kida is scary. <br>  <br>  tip of the day- breathing through noise helps making out longer ;o)<br>  <br>  good luck|`|Q65vW0QXaa	it takes practice|`|F4XKQKt2aa	so many people have already asked this question. go look it up and i'm sure you'll find some great tips <br>  <br>  good luck <3|`|7OL3gywaaa	Practice on an orange. Or maybe you're just a natural.|`|Vnah73CEaa	nah, its cool. and anyways, let me tell you a story: there's these two friends and the guy asks her (she's an experienced kisser) to help him out with kissing. Being close friends and all, she says yes. (true story). But maybe, if you have a really close guy-friend who wouldn't be offended or freaked out and has experience kissing, that you should ask him to help you out. <br>  <br>  OR<br>  heres what i would do: tell him that you aren't a good kisser, and that he should take the lead. And, i think that ur guy is cool by asking you if you wanted to kiss him. Good for u dude! lol. anyways, it would be cool if my bf told me that he wasn't a good kisser, because it doesn't matter, right? ur still together, and like each other a lot, and he asked you(which is really the polite, and cool thing to do), and just go for it.|`|pS3h9TZBaa	You don't sound stupid at all, everyone gets really nervous with their first kiss. My best advice is chapstick and gum. One of my boyfriends used to tell me he loved to kiss me because my chapstick tasted good (burts bees) and I recall one kiss to be really good because the guy had chewed some kind of fruity gum beforehand. Other than that, it's pretty easy to just go with the flow and follow his lead. I don't think there's a difference with braces. I've kissed with and without and haven't noticed anything. And don't worry, if you make a mistake it isn't a big deal. Sometimes when I do I just giggle and most guys find that cute anyways.
qXpxILnRaa	no, he does not hate you. he's just being a guy, lazy & all lol.
fYvxLMyHaa	i get jealous too. it's ridiculous. like i know my bf loves me and he says the same stuff your bf does, but i guess i won't believe it until we've made it for a while and he stays faithful and interested in me. <br>  <br>  i guess the best thing you can do (and it's hard, i know) is try to be rational about these things. like why would he be spending so much time with you if he didn't like you? and you have to think about his past actions that show his affection. it will make you feel better until the next jealousy fit starts.|`|nxMi4adjaa	<a href="http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;_ylt=Ah48.hK04QmNf7ATBwPBq9Lsy6IX;_ylv=3?qid=20090222181949AAknWhO">http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;...</a>

I know that my wife adores going to coldwater creek|`|a66nvk0taa	A trip to Paris?|`|CM0C65dtaa	I 'm a pretty simple life person, and to me getting a gift that shows a bit of thought is my favorite.  For example, I like to garden,and if my man saw that i needed something for my hobby, or there was a nice plant I had mentioned, I would think that was great, because it pertains to something I like, and it shows he knows what i enjoy and supports it.

Let me iterate and reiterate, there is absolutely no benefit in being part of a gang. <br>  <br>  **** man it's so unfortunate your brother is experiencing something like this. I will respond assuming this gang is a serious notable gang in the United States.<br>  <br>  In America, unlike here in Australia, the perception I get is that gangs seem to be a lot more serious, and possess firearms unlike the gangs here. It all depends how serious the gang is, sometimes they are just teenage cliques, so if you pull up with your 28 year old mates they'll **** their pants and leave your brother alone for good, but 18 isn't really teenage young.<br>  <br>  Your brother will have to deal with the situation. I don't have the details of the situation so I can't give specific advice. He will have to explain to his "friends" that he does not want to be part of a gang or have any affiliation with them, maybe quip something like "I just wanna be good friends", and then stop seeing them gradually. No friends is better than gangster friends. Get him to talk his way out of trouble. If he can avoid anyone associated with the gang, I think now is a great time to start. <br>  <br>  You can say you're not part of a gang, but if you hang out with people from a gang and dress like they do, what does that make you? Your brother has some explaining to do, and needs to reassess his priorities.<br>  <br>  If he has to get "jumped", it's way better than joining the gang (more so in America). It's part of growing up in the hood. It's life experience, you learn and move on, then never see them again. <br>  <br>  Generally, once you're in, there's no such thing as leaving, unless you pay a large sum of cash depending on how high up you are or they just put you on a hitlist, or they just beat you beyond recognition. So no matter what he does, make sure he doesn't join just because they threatened to jump him. Also, once you're in it's all about following orders, no matter what it is. If they tell you to kill someone you have to do it, or they'll kill you.<br>  <br>  If they know where you live, seriously, be very very careful. Also, don't negotiate with the gang, such as "give us protection money and we won't bother you again". They'll just keep making more and more growing demands.<br>  <br>  And believe me, it may seem like a solution, but don't call the police. Just don't. It's an unwritten street rule. If they find out your brother called, he's finished. To them, there's no one worse than a "snitch" and someone who leaves the gang. If you call the police you really have to do it smart, because I've heard several stories where people "snitch" and get stabbed to death.<br>  <br>  Above all, make your decision based on how serious and how connected the gang is. Plan things out and think them through. Avoid any form of conflict if possible. The plan is to stop your brother from hanging around those people.<br>  <br>  I hope all goes well. I hope your brother learns from this experience and changes for the better.|`|bhlHhE9yaa	It is tough but only thing I would suggest is get away while you can because it might only get worse. I know because I went through it. Now my oldest brother is no longer here.

zu10q3Qyaa	I was in a similar situation with my ex husband and he abandoned us, me and my two sons.  I didn't want to speak badly about him either so I told the kids that daddy has some problems and it's none of your fault.  He doesn't think like other people and it makes it really hard for him to stay in a relationship with his family.  I told them that he didn't leave them, he left me and that if he was capable of loving anyone, it would be them.|`|8ac2e5cbdd946ee60c803052559873c5aa	I really think that you do not ever need to tell your daughter that you consider her father a sociopath.  This isn't your diagnosis to make in the first place.  Not saying he's a nice man, just saying...<br>  <br>  Just tell your daughter that you love her too much to have her in that kind of home right now, and leave it at that.<br>  <br>  And I have a problem ex myself, btw.  And a child with him.  Children need to know their fathers love them and we mothers of children with problem fathers have an even more important job of figuring out how to make this happen for our children.  Don't put your own feelings first about this--protect your child from the harsh realities, but let your daughter know her father loves her (bad men love their children too).|`|e44113cd9f21585ce32b6f910959288daa	Tell her that everyone doesn't get along and that is the case with you and her father.  You have to be real on some level but you don't have to be mean about what you tell her.  Tell the truth.|`|SsfnitjXaa	It is good that you don't want to paint the girls father in a bad light.  After all you are the one that selected him to be the daddy.  Just tell her that you found out you couldn't get along together.  <br>  <br>  Stop keeping track of his life now.  It does not matter.|`|a66nvk0taa	I think you want to tell your daughter about her dad is because your jealous of this other woman success.

Ask in it that they take your thoughts and feelings seriously and ask if there is some way you can all resolve this without you moving out. Hopefully if they know just how bad the situation is then something will get done to rectify it. Another couple of years and you will look at and behave in a totally different way with your family, often it is the hormones that are flooding your body at this age that makes things like this. Hang on in there and try to find a positive solution if you can.<br>  Good luck for your future.|`|4dXcZhuTaa	well, yeah moving into the boyfriends house is indeed a really bad job especially since you're so young, but just let her know how you have been feeling.<br>  you are at a tough age, new hormones and everything.<br>  everything and everyone gets on your nerves, especially at home, but things will get better, just talk to her, that in itself will help you a lot with how you are feeling.|`|5810e6ffd53a5af2e1a161b4d5ccf2e3aa	If you think it is bad at home just move in with the boyfriends family and then you will have a new set of rules.Then where are you going to move .Stop running and deal with it.

Trust me on this.  Talk to your mom.  Open up to her.  I know it can be hard and maybe you can start with "Mom, I need to talk to you" or "Mom, I have been so unhappy lately and I would like to talk to you about it".  I would have loved it if my daughter would have come to me to talk about how she felt.  I made the mistake of not letting her know that she could come to me anytime, with anything.  Talk to your mom.  Maybe you can all get some family counseling to help with the fighting problem.  It is better than being stressed out constantly or fighting with your sister on a regular basis.  <br>  <br>  Hope this helps.  :O)|`|W4O4rcv9aa	I have found that the best way to start the conversation is telling your mom your tired of fighting with them and say that you think it is best if you leave for a little while that you love her and you are just sick of everyone being unhappy and  you want to see if things get better if your not there but i would find some where else to stay besides your boyfriends it will most likely be easier if it was some where else.|`|yb9gP4CCaa	OMG I KNOW HOW YOU FEEL, My sister and parents are fighting constantly and then afterwords she goes around and tells her friends how horrible they are!

Try tallking to her about it while you two are alone in the car, believe me it will work this way because shell be partially concentrated on the road and not want to blow her top off!

It's called custodial interference.  So forget about that.  It's not an option.

This woman should be in jail even to suggest it to you, she should instead be encouraging you to talk to your parents and let them know how you are feeling. Sweetie you sound like a very smart and mature 14 year old. Just think if you move in with your boyfriend’s mom and you and him get into a normal boy/girlfriend misunderstand? How uncomfortable that would be for you, in no time you would be make into live in sex maid for your boyfriend. How are you going to be contributing to this house hold? At home you can get away with a lot of thing like not wanting to clean your room, doing dishes, taking out the garbage in another persons home they may not have the same love and patience as your family shows you. Just know this every family have their problems wherever you move to, you are only going to find problems there, sometimes theirs are worst than yours (run from the pot fall into the fire). Maybe you can enlist the help of a trusted family friend or another relative to speak to your parents i.e. if you feel you can’t talk to them. But no matter what you resolve do not leave home. I hope your boyfriend have more sense than his mom.
psFBlHmVaa	ouch that sucks, be straight up and ask her how can she has feelings for you is her ex is still fresh on her mind, your not a rebound guy, ask her how she really feels about you, try not to be a jerk to her even though that does hurt. tell her if she needs time to get rid of him then let her have that time, just let her decide before you get hurt any more, if she goes back to him, then so be it you deserve better just remember that|`|YMbvOmryaa	Sorry to say this but it sounds as if she cares about you some and doesn't want to be the one to hurt you But, she still wants to be with him (the ex). She wants you to be the one to break up with her because she wants to spare your feelings. You are a good guy and have been there for her, she feels she owes you, and that is why she is coming to you for advice. She is hoping you will gently back out of the relationship.|`|otEoK2e5aa	Ok. Obviously this dude left her with some turmoil. He must've broken her heart and altered the way she views the dating world. I had a similar situation where a guy completely changed my life when he cheated, but I was over him before I started dating my current man.  If she tells you she has feelings for him and loves him, multiply that by 100 and that's how she really feels for him. You will be dealing with her issues for a while and it will ultimately end up in heartbreak or you loosing her respect for not being strong and bouncing out. Trust me, it will end badly. Get out now.|`|Ns99VyQMaa	yup sounds like your the rebound guy. there is no way she could have really fallen in true love with you unless she had already been completely over  her ex for a while. im sorry to be the one to tell you but she does not love you like she does her ex so leave while you still can and next time you fall for some one make sure there are no strings attached.|`|onrcmQf8aa	wow,  she should have closed that door with her ex before she moved forward with you.  i sure hope that she doesn't cheat on you with him.<br>  <br>  all she can do is stop calling him and being in his life and she will forget him.  you shouldn't allow her to talk about him to you.  that will only make her want him more.<br>  <br>  Please answer mine: <a href="http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;_ylt=AjJCu5rz2eF0Hbv8T_Qx3Ozsy6IX;_ylv=3?qid=20090222151649AAzjM8n">http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;...</a>|`|3XVHBA51aa	Dump her now.

She obviously has never loved someone like that before. She needs to truly move on and learn to ignore her left over feelings for him. Also, you might want to be careful because she may be just using you as a rebound, which is never good, because when she gets over him, she'll realize she never really cared about you, she just wanted to have someone in her life, which is a majo sign of immaturaty. This may not be the case at all though. she may truly love you and want him out, but she can't figure out how to get over him. <br>  <br>  Everyone knows that if you truly loved your ex, you can never be friends with them, because there's always a little bit of that love for them left in you. What she needs is time away from him. time to sort her feelings out. Maybe she needs to take a break from your two and sort her heart out:)<br>  <br>  good luck!|`|ff700543f3408186155eccc4290362b5aa	She has got serious baggage here. Don't you feel she should be so into you that the old boyfriend should just fade away? She still has feelings for him? Come on! Don't just sit there and take this. She has got to make a decision. I would tell her if she has that many feelings and still loves the guy, she better go figure it out and get back to you, because it seems if she cant let go of that guy in her mind or heart, its not fair to you at all. Really, you are not even supposed to talk too much about an ex with your new guy, but this? Wow! You are pretty tolerant! This COULD be an issue??? It IS an issue. Maybe she should not have jumped into another relationship while still so hung up on another. By her even admiting to you that she still has feelings for him and still loves him.... I dont care if she added that she loves you more, she still has soemthing for this guy, and a big red flag should  be goin up in your head. Its bad enough that a lover talks about old lovers, but to still have love and feelings for them and admit it... yikes!!<br>  Tell her to go figure it out even if it means going back to the old ex and work ouit whatever. You will be better off. Either shes gonna get abck with him or come running to you. Either way, you will be better off.<br>  Good luck. You sound like a nice guy. I wish you the best!|`|ZNe6B9TQaa	Dump her.  Do you really want to be the rebound that she just dates to get over the last guy? <br>  <br>  Clearly she's not over him and it's not your job as her present significant other to help her get over him.

If you don't I would find a place where your Mom won't be able to find it - I'm sure you've got somewhere...or take it to your dad's and keep it with you all the time in your bag or something.  It's good to write down how you are feeling because it gets it out of your head so don't stop writing if it makes you feel better.  <br>  <br>  Parents usually only snoop because they are worried about you so try and talk to them about how you feel and how hurt you felt about the fighting and the split.  remember that it's not your fault that they aren't together and it's also OK for you to love them both.<br>  <br>  Hope you have a good visit with your dad :)
gTfIQaHcaa	Well, just for starters, slooooooow down for a second, girl. Let's just take a step back for a moment.<br>  <br>  First of all, you have already stated that you have a fantastic relationship - this much is clear. It's easy to have insecurities about this stuff, and I totally understand that (I've had my moments too)<br>  So, I'd like to address your questions about you relationship one by one.<br>  "Is he going to get bored with you?"<br>  Well, for a start, if he was going to get bored with you, it would already have happened. Take my word for it, if he wasn't into you, he definitely would NOT have asked you to marry him. Getting engaged is a big step and I'm sure he realises that. You love him and he clearly loves you in return, otherwise your relationship wouldn't be as great as it is. <br>  <br>  "Is he excited to be marrying you, or just doing it because it's that time in life?"<br>  This should be an easy question to answer. You ever read, or hear about that book, "He's just not that into you" ? Well, one of the chapters in that book is entitled, "he's just not that into you if he isn't marrying you." Your fiance has asked you to marry him, and he chose you, not any other woman, to be his future wife. If he's asking you, he wants to be with YOU! He's definitely wanting it and not just doing it because "it's about time' !<br>  <br>  "Is he going to cheat?"<br>  Well, I gotta tell you now, if you're even considering that possibility, you need to talk to him about it. If he's asking you to marry him, he trusts you and presumably feels that you trust him also. Would you ever cheat on him? (this is hypothetical, not literal, so don't be offended!) If you love him that much, you must trust him to some significant degree. The more you worry about a thing happening, the more likely you are to set yourself and him up for it to happen. Don't do that! You just need to sit down and have a normal discussion with him about it. Don't say it like you are expecting him to cheat, rather approach it explaining that you're feeling insecure right now and that you just need his reassurance on the matter. If he really loves you, and its seems to me that he must, he'll put your fears to rest.<br>  <br>  "What if you grow apart....have a cold marriage.....lose your appeal?"<br>  As long as you are truthful, loving and caring towards him, anything can be resolved. I'm not saying you must do this 24/7! No-one can be perfect. However, as for appeal, let me tell you a short story. I have been with my fiance for nearly 3 years, have known him for 4 years, and I love him so much that if he were ever to say to me 'I don't love you anymore' I'd probably just lie down on the spot and die of a broken heart. I would never recover from it. Anyway, I'm pretty chubby, and although I have a pretty face, I have MAJOR self-esteem issues with my body, as I have a large pair of legs and a rather round belly too. Despite it all, though, I have never once doubted that my fiance finds me physically attractive (for example, he's always talking about how he loves my waist and my breasts, even though I find them lacking, so unless your fiance is the type to have impossibly high standards, you should be fine), and if I can be attractive to him in my current state of body, I'm totally confident that you can.<br>  <br>  As you say, he chose you! He could have picked from any number of other women anywhere else, not only is it you who he's with, it's you who he wants to spend the rest of his life with. That's what marriage is about, a lifelong commitment borne of love and respect for each other. Everything else comes after love and respect. Remember, he LOVES you! Love can overcome anything :) you really need to talk to him about this. Don't worry, just take it carefully, and in a non-confrontational way, and you should be fine!<br>  Good luck, and I hope I could be of some help to you!<br>  :)|`|h7H1AWnjaa	It may help if you talk to him about your concerns. I don't think that he would see it as you not trusting him, but speaking for myself (I am also engaged to wed this may) these are issues that you need to talk about if you will be sharing a life and having children with this man.<br>  <br>  Good luck and congrats!|`|Vbq6kMKbaa	Its because you are close to something you want. And now you have something to lose. It's always scary when you can see what you want, but it's just out of reach. You feel you could lose it.|`|N48qV69daa	It is just because this is so new, and you dont want to lose him. He loves you though, and you will not lose him. I felt this way too! It will be okay after a while you will began to realize again that he loves you for you and will always love you. Life is still going to be amazing. Good luck! You guys will be together forever and ever just as my fiance will be together for ever and ever. I wish you two the happiest of lifes, even during the worst of lifes.|`|jPJ9MTCwaa	Just so you know, this is really common.  My fiance and I were together almost 4 years when we got engaged and I totally went through this.  While you are dating it is kind of fun and games but when you get engaged you start to think about the permanence and implications associated with getting engaged and then married.  These are questions I think we all ask ourselves.  Really, there is no way to tell the future but you know your relationship and you know how you two mesh.  Just think how much closer and more in love with him you are everyday.  That is going to continue to grow and you needn't worry about the what if's.  Basically, you realize that any relationship needs work and nurturing and if you are willing to put that in, things will be fine.
8yE2sYGeaa	HE was abusive.<br>  <br>  You had violence directed against you.<br>  <br>  is he a vicious drunk?|`|FtyLwqR5aa	No he is the one who took it out of hand. Get rid of this jerk it is going to get worse. TRUST ME I LIVED THIS!!!!!!!!|`|RtkB46peaa	You started it, he should have been mature enough to not take the bait.  Did you honestly think it was ok to grab his face?  If he did the same, would you go online and complain to the world?  Wait a sec, you just did.<br>  <br>  Sorry sweetie, but I read the whole thing.  You put your hand in his face.  Then he did in return.  I don't care if you feel justified because you were trying to "hush" him or not.  You started this, not him.  I stand by my answer, and others have agreed.<br>  <br>  And now you change the story?  Now you're telling of how he put your head through a wall on a previous occassion?  But when you wrote your question, instead of mentioning this head bashing experience (which is obviously a story of abuse and we all would have said so), you decide to post a question about him putting his hand on your mouth?  Sounds suspicious to me, and your credibility just went right through the floor.  <br>  <br>  There are women out their with husbands that abuse them for real.  Now it sounds like you're making this stuff up just to get attention. Why wouldn't you have mentioned these past experiences?  Why use ask the question and use an example that is barely borderline?  Making this stuff up is an insult to the women out there who are truly suffering at the hands of some abusive piece of #@$#@#.  <br>  <br>  If your husband is truly abusing you this way, you owe it to yourself, your family, and your friends to get out immediately.   If these things truly happened, you are being abused.  No doubt about it.|`|wpi36XBAaa	It seems that you BOTH have problems with the way you deal with conflict. <br>  I am sure you were not gentle when trying to silence him (since you admit things were already heated), just as he was rough with you too, only to have you do it again. <br>  You are both at fault, and you both need to get help for the way you react instead of being the adults that you are supposed to be.  Do this for those 4 kids who need parents who can show them better ways of dealing with conflict - or you doom them to repeating this sort of behavior.|`|4o3jXz3Waa	You both put your hands on each other, so you were both in the wrong.  No matter your reason for doing it, invading someone's space by putting your hands on them tends to create a very bad reaction, as you found out.  HOWEVER, I am in no way condoning your husband's actions.  He was very wrong for what he did and he was definitely abusive.  I would not call your actions abusive, but I do think you were wrong by invading his space.|`|iD4ejChZaa	he is the abusive one|`|pVuNxfBZaa	Of course he's going to accuse you of being abusive, he was drunk! Honestly, why would you put your hands over the mouth of a drunken person anyway? <br>  <br>  But that's all in the past. I think that in the future, when he gets drunk, the best approach is to let him be. I don't know how often he gets drunk or what type of drunk he is but if he's a violent, loud or abusive one, you may want to consider putting your kids in a friendlier environment for the time being. They really don't need to endure that.|`|Yx5GlOJDaa	I don't believe you were abusive at all I honestly would have done the same if my husband did that to me. The way I see it they can treat you the way they wanna be treated and if they grab your face or something I would do it right back. I had a ex boyfriend who decided to hit me with his fist and i turned around and hit him back twice as hard and than later he actually beat be and I fought back. A woman has a right to defend them self when they feel they need to and he had NO right doing that to you at all|`|2P2K0rl2aa	You both were abusive.  If somebody put their hand over my mouth I personally would find that very demeaning and aggravating.  But then again that's no excuse to grab your face.  Next time he tries to yell, get up, walk out of the room and tell him you won't be yelled at like that.  If he tries to physically stop you from leaving, get the cops involved.|`|zu10q3Qyaa	Sounds like you both were.  Nobody has the right to touch another person, you put your hand on his mouth and you also grabbed his face.  He was drunk, you shouldn't have been confrontational with a drunk man.  Alcohol and children and families don't mix.  Yes he was abusive but you were both wrong in my opinion.|`|vn2Lq7hIaa	Get a letter to Don King. He will promote your next bout in the ring and make you a few bucks .<br>  <br>  Good Luck <br>  <br>  God Bless|`|1da4a2d0455c0102329b9db0565c3a34aa	Neither of you sound abusive...immature definitely, abusive absolutely not.|`|mWzQjqB1aa	no that was not ok on his part even tho he was drunk he still hurt u and thats not right|`|aeLyiRczaa	I think you have an attitude problem to start with.  No, not a stretch.  You are making the typical female excuses now.  Like I hit him but he is bigger and stronger and yada, yada, yada.  Okay, then you are a fool for hitting someone bigger and stronger and meaner.  That does not make you a victim, just a whiner and stupid.  If I hit someone bigger or stronger or meaner, I use a bat or something.   I dont want piss them off, I want to put them down.  Otherwise, I just asked them to kick my butt around the block for all intents and purposes and I have little reason to complain.<br>  <br>  Lady, you seem like the typical women of today, at least to me.  You want to be able to do what you want and then yell foul if you get back anything you did not like or want.  Look, forget all the feminazi crap you gals not only bought into but now try to pedal to everyone else, especially to men.  Some of us guys wont play that.  I can tell you, my wife tried similar nonsense with me one time when she got mad and found out that if you want to come at me like a man, you land on your *** like one.  That helped her figure it out and we have had no more of that nonsense.  It actually seemed to square her away a bit and that was many years ago.  <br>  <br>  Honestly, it is getting to the point that when I hear a women talk of abuse, I sort of laugh and figure it is just that she did not get her way or she got hit back.  Sort of like the kid who yelled wolf too often.<br>  <br>  Look, being a female does not entitle you to be a jack *** any more then being a male does.  It also gives you no more right to spit in a persons eye then being male does.  You dont want it to become physical, dont make it physical.  For having a vagina does not mean you get to rule the world or make all the rules.  Figure it out and keeps your mitts off or learn to take it as well as give it.<br>  <br>  And honestly, if this answer offends you, then let it go.  For a response will completely fall on deaf ears.  I have seen and heard this nonsense too many times and no, you will not get me to change my attitude.  Women seem to always want to have it their way and some of us just do not feel inclined to put up with it or excuse it, no matter how much yapping the female does.|`|uuV1ak58aa	I am not going to condone what happened. I have been in a similar situation with my wife. Albeit I wasn't drunk, I still left a mark on her arm when I grabbed her wrist as she was hitting at me. After the fight I apologized empathetically, as she did in return also. We both realized what we had done was wrong and talked about ways to not let our anger fester to the point of abusive behavior. Now the fact that he was drunk raises certain concerns for me, especially if children were present. I need not raise particular issue on that. I would say if it is something that he did that is not character of him when he is not drunk then I suggest talking about it while he is sober to get his take.<br>  <br>  MILDRED SENT ME HERE TO HELP YOU**<br>  <br>  pitstop83 in central Illinois|`|oAJi0s3Waa	your husband was being abusive and if this was the first time it will not be the last
uTNKfpV6aa	Ask her what's bothering her, and tell her you're concerned. Tell her that she need to stop, and make her promise to you, on your friendship, she won't cut any more. If she can't promise you that... Tell her you'll be going to her parents. You're main concern is her safety. Explain to her that you're not doing this for her safely, and you hope that she understands that you care about her, and that's why you're doing this. Not to hurt her, but to help her.<br>  <br>  Now excuse me for not being helpful below, but it's my turn to rant!!:<br>  It's an attention seeking behaviour. It bugs the **** out of me. If I find out any of my friends are cutting themselves, I'd hand them a sharper object and tell then to either end it, or stop F--KING around. Cause I'm not going to pity these people. If she doesn't want people to know, she shouldn't be doing it. Tell her next time you see her doing this, you're going to scream it out, and draw as much attention as you can, cause clearly that's what she wants.<br>  <br>  ATTENTION SEEKING IS NOT A CRY FOR HELP. IT'S A STUPID F--KING MOVE THAT PISSES PEOPLE WHO HAVE ACTUALLY HAD A HARD LIFE MAD. STOP LOOKING FOR ATTENTION AND WORK THROUGH YOUR SH-T.|`|a4d0cf9dc578dd26b78d03242fc9311daa	She's obviously just doing it for attention. Why else would she do it right there under the table where someone could easily see? Honestly, don't do anything. You'd just be feeding into the attention she wants, and it would just make it worse. Eventually, when people stop noticing and caring, I'm sure she'll stop. Just pretend like you don't know, or care.|`|IfOTZhQyaa	I really think this sort of thing is to much for you to handle so I suggest you tell you counselor at school. they are better equipped to handle this kind of thing. They have help at there disposal for her and her family. One thing is for sure and that is you need to tell someone. You don't have to be a friend to help you just have to care.|`|At1jjbIKaa	Fight it. Take the razor blade away.|`|UsFirzTHaa	taking the razor blade away is not a good idea, but maybe tell her parents that she is cutting herself and get a professional, if you try yourself she probably won't take it seriously, she needs a professionals help. At first, she might think you have betrayed her, but when she has stopped cutting, she will thank you. be as supportive as you can and take into consideration that cutting is an addiction, she causes herself physical pain to block out mental pain. keep us posted and stay strong.<br>  <br>  by the way, i'm not a psychologist, but i'm telling you what i would do in the situation.|`|u86YQTkZaa	my friend use to do it but she stopped i told her to stop<br>   she did it bcuz sum guy she fell in love with broke her heart...<br>  so just tell her to stop and w.e the problem is tell her everything is guna b okaii nd if she doesnt listen then tell her that u dont wanna b her friend ne more just to see if she would stop or tell her u really care about her nd dont wanna lose her to nething stupid<br>  nd shes only 14 she probaly has little problems nd she has a whole life ahead of her!|`|4oEuCkjPaa	with a knife
onrcmQf8aa	Tell him that a "birdy" told you that he has spoken to Jessica.  Let him know that you feel betrayed.  You don't have to tell him how you found out (**** you might need to do more snooping later). <br>  <br>  But he isn't being honest, and truthful.  He lied to you.<br>  <br>  Please answer mine: <a href="http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;_ylt=AjJCu5rz2eF0Hbv8T_Qx3Ozsy6IX;_ylv=3?qid=20090222151649AAzjM8n">http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;...</a>|`|Q65vW0QXaa	tell him the truth|`|6h5slqFnaa	Dump him immediately.  You clearly can't trust him, and he clearly doesn't respect you.  There two huge road blocks right there.  And you won't be able to fix the problem because if you admit you looked in his myspace, then HE won't trust YOU.  I would save some time and cut your losses... this isn't going to work out so find a man that will trust you and cherish you.  There's no point staying with somebody just because you're comfortable or lonely, because the more time you spend with some loser, that's time you could've been meeting Mr. Right.|`|LTkRTfPSaa	well i think its going to b hard to tell him "y r u talking to the girl when you promised you wouldnt" cuz then he would know you got on his myspace. but i think the right idea to do is just probably confront easily but not in a hrash way you knw wat i mean but dont ignore him cause that wont solve nothin (he would wonder y your ignoring him) but just lightly question it or just say"heyy, did you change your password?" umm idk that might make things loose|`|eIlQN7XFaa	Your both wrong, you for not trusting him and him for not deserving your trust. I would tell him the truth about you being curious to the point of feeling like you need to snoop. Trust isn't deserved it is earned and needs to be continually worked for. Maybe this is a good situation to help open your eyes about him and his relationship mood at the moment. Sounds like you are both young and it sounds like he is intirested in talking to other Girls. He can have female friends but he should have them in a way that you will feel happy and comfortable about. maybe bluntly ask him what he wants out of your relationship and then as him to show it.|`|i16XRTEBaa	as his significant other it is your right to make sure he is being truthful to you. i would change the password locking him out of his own myspace. even as a guy i know the importance of honesty and that you don't lie to women seeing as how they control the world. later confront him and give him a punishment you see fitting for is lack of cooperation|`|iKjsR79paa	just say in a joke-like-way "hows ur lil friend jessica?" let the man lie(cuz he will from previous exp), 2 reasons... u can see how far he goes with her and you may ned to be on myspace again. so dont burn your information source. You can get back at him anytime, but you need to keep the upperhand...play it cool.. then bite him in the A**!!!! lol<br>  <br>  sorry guys, but i love my ladies they dont need to be hurt!|`|w0tquTRXaa	You *can't* stop a person from wanting to talk to another person. If he really respects your opinions then he would keep communication to a minimum with her-- and judging from that one message that's pretty minimal communication.<br>  Put yourself in his shoes,<br>  if HE told YOU that he didn't want you talking to a certain guy, would you listen to him? Now, it would be rude and nearly impossible to completely ignore anyone.<br>  <br>  If it were me, I would ignore his message. But if any other details develop (if he is insistant on going behind your back to talk to her), I would confront him about the situation. You could get yourself  (and your relationship) in a lot of trouble by confronting him about this so early. Just lie low.|`|xvUUdfxhaa	Pfft. That's stupid. He's stupid.<br>  <br>  I would dump him for something like that - it seems like he's completely disrespecting your wishes and going behind your back - and if you ask me, if there's nothing wrong with what's happening, there's no reason to go behind someone's back. People don't lie just for the sake of it.<br>  <br>  It would also depend on why you don't want him talking to her. If they've been friends their whole life and they're like brother and sister, then maybe you should calm down a little and realise that men and women can be friends.<br>  <br>  but if she's an ex that's obviously not over it, or if you think HE may not be over it, you're right in asking him not to speak to her - it's best not to force him not to, because people generally want to do their own thing when told NOT to do something - but if he respects you, he should realise that speaking to her upsets you and that you're more important than anyone else.|`|3XVHBA51aa	Don't try to regulate my answers you crazy insecure psycho.  If you can't trust your boyfriend, you shouldn't be dating.  Whether or not he gives you reason...  It is inexcusable to snoop through his private messages, just as it should be for him to flirt with other women.  But we don't know the context of his relationship with this other girl, but who the **** do you think you are to control someone else?  Grow up *****.|`|DNwHGeEtaa	Confront him. If he promised that he wouldn't talk to her, why did he do it? If he was pissed off, he should have told you, not another girl. Plus whatever is going on between you and him should be between you and him, he shouldn't have told her. <br>  <br>  He has no respect for you and this girl is laughing at you. Don't allow that to happen.|`|xTwWM6UFaa	you dont want to let him know that you were on his myspace, it would just be something for him to use against you. and you dont want to be vague and say a friend told you, cause then he would ask for details. i suggest asking him about it, and when he lies and says he hasnt, explain to him how honored you are that he respects you and that your lucky to have a guy like him, etc. one thing i like to call the guilt trip.|`|t4aqoR2Aaa	You weren't supposed to get on his Myspace.<br>  =D<br>  <br>  <br>  For real though, don't confront him. It is one thing to go on there for the information, but then to do something about it? Plain idiocy. Consider why you do not like this girl and what she may mean to your bf. You may be taking away one of his very good friends.|`|7r2qkPnuaa	confromnt him...but id wait a few days make sure he knows you ont know his password..and keep snooping....and wait til somthing comes up like if hes going to meet her somwhere...then follow him and meet him with that chick and bust that shi* wide open!!!! thats what i'd do :-P....but i am crazy........|`|dCoGR2Tdaa	change his orientation to gay and upload gay porn to his pictures, the post bulletins so his friends look at his page. then the next day report his pictures so his account gets deleted. then go to s his d and use ur teeth. then dump him. ;)|`|5ZAF4qzBaa	confront him about it.<br>  but DONT GET BACK AT HIM,<br>  its only gonna make things worse(:<br>  hope things get better for you guys.<br>  <br>  (and i dont think it was wrong for you to go on his profile,<br>  i go on my bf's all the time. but he knows i do, so yeah. lol.)|`|6N0LK74saa	you got on there jsut to find dirt to break his heart  FU  your like every woman ive ever met and herd of. so jsut break up wit him then play your games and add drama to his life. thats all 98 percent of you are good for drama|`|tlhhL20Jaa	confront your boyfriend, dont be scared. keep it real like me.

Just because a guy talks to a girl doesn't mean he's cheating or intends to cheat.  <br>  <br>  Seek counseling over your trust issues|`|5TIIgqhhaa	well if u confront him, he will prly get mad and say why u were on his page anyway! it all depends tho. the rite thing to do is to be honest! but idkk its kind of just ur desicion, follow ur heart girll! :)|`|FrWhdRL1aa	What??|`|aC9dBaNqaa	I would casually just start a conversation with him and talk nonchalant telling him about how important trust is in a relationship and that you have been that way with him and that you hope that he is that way with you and see what he says if he doesn't come clean then tell him that you had a feeling call it what you want and you went on his space and discovered that he was talking to that female that you didn't want him to (but before you mention that you can ask why did he changed the pass code unless he have something to hide) ask him why and that was very deceitful of him even though its a small thing but things can escalate into larger problems|`|n8eRg88Faa	it looks like this relationship is heading south.<br>  <br>  Firstly, you should NEVER have to tell him to not talk to someone. That is very controlling and dominant, which most guys hate cause it reminds them of their parents. <br>  Secondly,if he truly cared and knew this girl was threatening your relationship, would he really risk it by still talking to her?<br>  If you want to save this relationship, you need to sort this thing out and talk to eachother about it. don't tell him "I didn't want you to talk to her WHY DID YOU TALK TO HER?!?!?" talk as equals, not with a dominant person and the other person. ask hi how he thinks you two as a couple are going, then go one from there.<br>  <br>  good luck!|`|BYTPpcNZaa	well it isn't very fair of you to tell him who he can and cant talk to.<br>  you should do what you think is a good decision, whether it be to confront him about it or to just forget about it.|`|aiRn2lQGaa	you two need to talk about what's going on. sit down and talk about it and find a happy medium|`|4fBXhYqSaa	thats the problem with snooping is you can't confront him. Cause OBVIOUSLY he didn't want you on his myspace and you got on it (is that trustworthy of you?) He lied you lied<br>  <br>  and now its gonna be there in the back of your head no matter what.<br>  <br>  i know you told me not to do that but i  did cause it falls in place with my asnwers<br>  <br>  i think you should just break up with him cause, you want to get back at him ya what a loveful relationship. Ignoring him just make it worse. Confronting him he'll blow up at you for getting on his myspace.|`|TawYWc4waa	let him talk to her<br>  nothings going on btwn them..things will start if u dont let them talk (you always want what u cant have) but let him know u no longer mind so he doesnt stay pissed at u  <br>  say " u know what, i was thinking, its ridiculous what i said before...talk to who u want, i trust u" u should b able to trust him <br>  say that u were jealous a little bit because u like him so much<br>  u do sound a lil jealous unless theres a legit reason y u dont want him to talk to her<br>  no stupidity|`|lqxvFZueaa	healthy relationship is based on trust.<br>  if you dont trust someone, why be in a relationship with them.<br>  <br>  and dont tell me cause you LOVE him. cause love REQUIRES trust.<br>  seems like you want someone to control. not trust or love.|`|IfCOvnA1aa	1. let him talk to whomever he wants. why not? why WOULDNT you let him talk to her in the first place?<br>  2. you shouldnt have been on his myspace.|`|xQsMPtFGaa	well ive done the same as you before. just pretend you dont know about it for now and see what he says to her and what they talk about. it might be something good.<br>  trust me on this one!!|`|ryh5AslRaa	Your too controling your not married so its none of your business if you dont like it dont date him.|`|yKWPdilQaa	You should've at least let him keep it up and spy on him more.|`|AA10934463	you shoul tell him ..thats what relationsships are about ..trust and communication,good luck|`|4qWnVPqOaa	ask him about it if he lies then confront him.. if hes honest forgive|`|obKyQ5CTaa	Get a new man He is playing games!

Remember, you don't run his life. We (I'm a boy) find it annoying that we can't talk to any other girl. Most of the time, the girls we want to talk to are just friends. So technically, you shouldn't be concerned unless he acts, in person, like he's hiding something from you, personally. Oh yeah, and one other thing. If he changed his password, how did you get in? TEACH ME!!!|`|c630401eb9baa68dddde8641339b6a29aa	This isn't the answer you're going to like, but this relationship doesn't seem to be working. There's no trust or respect. You invaded his privacy by reading his mail, and he broke his promise and isn't standing up for you to this girl. <br>  <br>  That said, I think you should ignore it, because admitting that you guessed his password and checked his mail will definitely make him angry. I would give him a little space on the subject of this girl because it might backfire and you'll push him away. If it really bothers you, talk to him again. Don't just tell him not to talk to her, explain your reasoning so he can see it from your point of view.|`|PEN3hha7aa	if you don't want to hear the answers then don't ask the question.  lmao, you have the right to tell him who he can and can't talk to??  Yes you do need to be reminded.<br>  <br>  I'll try to summarize this as short as I can:   It sounds like you are nothing but a possessive, spoiled little girl that needs to grow up.  If I was him I would dump you.<br>  <br>  Is that short enough?|`|xoveRPysaa	girl, i do that all the time.<br>  my boyfriend NEVER talks to girls.<br>  but i check his myspace everyday anyways.<br>  & yes, I think you should confront him!<br>  maybe with this type of context "Why would you want to talk to another girl, when you have a girlfriend, it isnt right, you have a girlfriend you dont need her"<br>  but then again i wouldnt say that if yall have only been together for a few weeks.<br>  <br>  is the girl his ex or something?|`|Vnah73CEaa	uh... why is this other girl that is talking to your guy such a big deal? I mean, if you know where she stands, you stand, and more importantly, he stands, then i think it's ok. And i think that you should ask him about it and see if he lies to your face.

f20d38f2d9e2702cb548cbcb14a06eb8aa	Not sure what you need to know here.  A man has used you for sex.<br>  <br>  He was never falling for you, sorry.  He cheated on his girlfriend with you.  His girlfriend is now pregnant.  Is there no end to this mess?<br>  <br>  I am still trying to figure out why you would even be interested in this loser. <br>  <br>  "he has a gf and whatever..is a f'ed up situation..but whatever" - this is just sad, I am sure you would not feel this way if you were the girlfriend.  And in life, what goes around, comes around.  Cheaters cheat.  So the best you could get out of this is a man that cheats.<br>  <br>  Please have a little respect for yourself.  I think you can do better than being a f buddy.|`|e2HW9iQ5aa	No. He's using you for sex, and now for whatever reason he's tired of doing so or doesn't want to anymore.  This is a guy that has a girlfriend, and a pregnant girlfriend no less, and he's still having sex with YOU. Do you really think that you can trust him to have feelings for you. Or, to just trust him in general? Also, this is someone that just found out the he got his girlfriend pregnant but "doesn't care about her"?? Don't let yourself get put in the position of his girlfriend. IMO you should think really hard before you have anything more to do with this guy.|`|mefxIQP9aa	No, he's not falling for you. He's just keeping you on a leash.<br>  <br>  You should run away and find a better f buddy or boyfriend.|`|MXRXG62oaa	ayyy, sounds like this guy isnt worth your time, because if he truly cared about you, he wouldnt have sex with you and them leave you.<br>  time to move on is my advice|`|HlRWA3JHaa	Well he finally realized that he was becoming a father and need to be more responsible hence the goodbye message.<br>  f buddy never goes far nor end well.|`|AA11108018	I "ll tell you what wrong he found you as a F buddy and things got to close for Comfort.  Find some who want you not just for F some who will respect you|`|qxgkhN8aaa	Hi Kate, I'm impressed with Max comments, he's honest.<br>  But ask yourself, would you want to get pregnant with this guy ?<br>  Or you don't care ?<br>  Let everything to pass by and see carefully what's ahead before you go for another attempt to have sex pleasure.<br>  As this will never get you any good out of it.<br>  If he loves you, he'll give you a Best Commitment.<br>  Or take it as a chapter in your life as a lesson to learn.|`|B24KqmgGaa	You are a booty call....respect yourself more.  I think maybe you want him to want more out of it.  He is telling you what he thinks you want to hear at the moment so he can have better sex with you.   <br>  Find someone that respects you...this guy has a pregnant girlfriend for godsake....dont you care about that?|`|OGkPeww1aa	He is incredibly lost and confused. I think he likes you, but, since he has that girl pregnant, he might feel a lot of responsibility for that, and not be ready for that.|`|AA10934463	no he doesnt want a kid so your his next booty call..wheres your self respect? you actually think what your  doing is okay ? i hope  you guys start going out then he does the same thing hes doing with you when you guys are together...have a good life|`|YjGYQrlMaa	this guy doesn't deserve you. he keeps making you confused by saying goodbye and making moves on you. move on and find a better guy. you will be happier then being with him.|`|53o0Z2Xvaa	damnn this is deep..<br>  <br>  just remember..:<br>  <br>  SHiiiT HAPPENS !|`|AA11739944	i stopped at "he has a gf and whatever." For doing this to someone, you are just as much of an *** as him. you brought this on yourself. <br>  PS you didn't say "my boyfriend" or anything like that. You referred to him as "this guy". This guy you sleep with. And if he's sleeping with you AND his girlfriend, I wouldn't be surprised if he was doing someone else too. If you think he cares about you, you are very wrong. Have some self respect.|`|ENZVi0Ptaa	He doesn't want to be with you. Its harsh but its true. He liked having sex with you and said what he needed to keep you. As time went on he needed to keep upping the stakes to keep you interested until it got too high.<br>  <br>  Listen you want a guy who wants to be with you not who wants to play you.<br>  <br>  Leave this guy in the past and find someone who wants to be in a relationship full time all the time.<br>  <br>  You deserve the best don't be afraid to hold out for it|`|f8bd5677bcf38585dd6016bf3f2c4687aa	What's with all the people calling her a slut and a whore? She's here for HELP people! There's no need to be so inhuman towards her.<br>  And this is the 21st century; why do we still buy into the antiquated double standard of men and women's sexuality?<br>  <br>  <br>  Anyways I think he likes you, made an ENORMOUS mistake with his girlfriend and is panicking about the consequences, and is also dealing with being shipped off. You could try to make it work now, but it seems like there is too much going on right now to come to a conclusion.<br>  <br>  I suggest you try to find what the results of the pregnancy situation will be (abortion, keep it, will he be forcibly tied down by it, etc.) and work from there.|`|ca1562f9999b16755e6d5f797fb3b9ebaa	Uh.. You should've been able to see this by now that he's just using you for sex. If he says that he didn't want to see you anymore, then that means he has decided that he wants to stay with his girlfriend. Maybe he's trying to be faithful to his pregnant girlfriend. It might be confusing because of all the great times you guys had, but it sounds to me that it was nothing more than a physical. I really think that you should leave him if he decided to not see you.|`|cbt4I1cuaa	can you say looser because that is what you found. he is cheating on his pregnant girl friend with you. He just has sex with you when he wants to and then by what in the world i don't know you but im a guy and this jerk is giving guys a bad rep. leave him alone all ladies can do better  than this that is crazy and if you don't want any better then maybe the problem is with you|`|0DdSoi4Maa	Yea, I agree with the other person.  If he really cared about you & loved you then he would have only been with you.  I wouldn't even mess with someone like that b/c then you'd be wondering if he was cheating on you & now that he got a girl pregnant.  Sounds like he doesn't know what he wants or he just likes something about you that he doesn't have in his girlfriend.|`|dadbfe4dd1ae10510f5cc7a4eac6a961aa	This guy is telling you what you want to hear so he can have sex with you. Hes ending it because he dosent want his girl to find out. he keeps coming back to try to keep you from being with anyone else. Havnt you heard of having your cake, and eating it too.|`|dCoGR2Tdaa	close ur legs whoar<br>  karma will come n get u bc if he doesnt care about his gf and she is preg i bet he does pretends to her like he cares or she wouldnt have had unprotected sex with him so just wait until u get preg then he will be doing it with some new girl he is obv a d-bag. also you should go get tested because he sounds like he has diseases.|`|6N0LK74saa	he probley know the truth that your jsut going to cheat on him when hes away. what can i say you women have a bad rep with if come to moral values and commitmit.|`|xTwWM6UFaa	hes probably guillty that he has been with you and got this other girl preggo. plus hes leaving, he doesnt want to leave you behind all tied up.|`|3XVHBA51aa	You're stupid for getting involved with an unavailable man.  If he cheats on his significant other now what makes you think that YOU are different?  Stop being so naive.|`|4ssAPRtaaa	this is one huge messed up situation, get out of it before it gets worse, and possibly might end up blaming you.|`|M34koGZgaa	hahaha holy sh*t thats a crazy situation. well if his girl is pregant, you have to let him go, cause now he has a baby|`|xngBZmr7aa	if your staying with this guy your ruining his kids future you hore|`|4qWnVPqOaa	his girl might have said it to you or he just cant deal with the fact that his girl is having a baby and realized that she needs him more than you|`|Ns99VyQMaa	girl he is just trying to get all the booty he can before he leaves and by telling you he cares or likes you more is just a way to get you to do anything and everything he can in the bedroom. sounds like you are the fool and if by him saying he doesnt care about his prego g friend who is carrying his unborn child doesnt raise any flags then u must be blind or is the sex that good? if it's just the sex thats holding you then just keep getting all you can too before its gone but please use CONDOMS!|`|YMbvOmryaa	You should have walked away as soon as you heard he had a gf. Imagine how you would feel if your bf was cheating on you. But, that is in the past now. He is not worth your time, he has a messed up life to deal with and is going to be doing visitations and child support soon.Do yourself a favor and move on with your life. Respect yourself and find someone who will cherish you and no-one else. Everyone deserves to have a loyal mate. And don't fall for that same old line, I would break up with her but.... Or I would never cheat on you.... They are common lies. Find someone who will be true to you.|`|zO59ezH3aa	Well maybe he really did care that his girlfriend was prego but he was embarres about it because maybe he really liked u.|`|k3d5P5B7aa	Girl he's bad news. Drop him like a bad habit.
xTwWM6UFaa	that is a big difference, but my boyfriends parents are 10 years apart and they are honest to god in love, so i think it depends on your relationship. if all he wants is sex, its not worth it. but if he wants to get to know you, and has as much fun messing around with you as having sex, its a good thing.|`|rwZB7bP2aa	I grew up the same way as you..same age dating.  I found personally that dating some one your age or younger you have "power issues". Meaning- childish behavior between the two of you, with no apparent or supportive reason.  I have been with my man for 10 years... he is 15 years older than I.  He knows what he wants in and out of live, responsible, understanding and loves the fact that all of his friends are jealous of him.  I feel that you should give him a chance.  You don't have to make a serious commitment the same day you say hi.  That is what dating is all about, getting to know each other before you make the big plunge.|`|AYyoasvtaa	Well um... only if you really truly like him. If you just want to try him and be "played" then don't. He's not interested in the panties; he is interested to get in your panties or get you out of them- by the way. Just do what you want. I mean it is your life :)|`|AA11515782	haha i just turned 25 last week and the last four guys i have dated have been 33,31,42,and 36.  Older guys are smart, they know what they want, and are focused. I learned a lot from the men that I dated, I am sure you will too :)|`|6N0LK74saa	sounds jsut like me and my X im not a player she was  so save him the pain  your not mature enough to grasp with love really is in real life.|`|aiRn2lQGaa	My grandparents are 8 years apart and they are still married and in love after over 50 years.|`|27ff667901ee8ed319424150c8879cb3aa	Wants your panties? what a weirdo. Doesnt he know its whats inside the panties that counts?|`|1hvqgOYVaa	you should give him a chance<br>  but be careful you never know|`|Q1f5n8mNaa	Just try it out for fun.. keep your guard up and dont let him smash to early either.. just have fun with this one|`|1NCPPHR9aa	Date awhile and you will see what he is about. <br>  Don't let yourself get too attached until you see where he's coming from.<br>  Go by his actions and not just his words.|`|4fe4fa0093052951c5515ef2f32cefffaa	I am about twice your age and my girlfriend is about 3 times your age.  We have been together for 14+ years as a couple and 5 years longer as friends. <br>  <br>  What I would suggest you do is start out as friends and see where it goes.  As I see it, your problem isn't really the age difference.  Your problem is, you really don't know his real intentions.  <br>  <br>  If there is a connection, you'll soon find age really doesn't matter.  After all, 8 years isn't very much difference.|`|AA11447210	Why not check it out? You don't have to let him in your panties any time soon so see how things go and if you get the feeling it's just about sex, or if he's really into you.<br>  <br>  You won't know unless you try. Why be left wondering, if the interest is there?|`|5TIIgqhhaa	try it! the older, the more mature[for most guyss=p]<br>  goodluckk! :D<br>  <br>  please help with my questionn<br>  <a href="http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;_ylt=An5uTY7hRmmIN1ZCcE3TKBXsy6IX;_ylv=3?qid=20090222201600AADuqkC">http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;...</a>|`|9f2391ebf6a1c505bb9421899963d771aa	Just give it a try and see what happens.

IfOTZhQyaa	Tell him just what you wrote. If he can't go out because his girlfriend is jealous that's one thing but he should at least tell you that and not get all stupid about it. If he continues to treat you like this maybe he is not as close of a friend you make him out to be. It may be that your friendship is one sided.|`|SsfnitjXaa	It really is not healthy to hang out with an ex boyfriend when he has a girlfriend.  So don't.

Tell her though that you would love to be in a relationship with her but the parents gets in a way.

bu6BhCnpaa	if this woman is your fiance and the mother of your children...then TALK TO HER!.  Let her know that you love your mother in law to be, but that her constant presence and nagging is begining to make you upset and uneasy and its begining to make you resent your fiance.  Ask that she maybe come over on saturdays to spend tiem with you and her grandchildren, but thats it.  or maybe she can pick them up after school and leave when an adult gets home...come up with a real solution.  just let your fiance know that its not that you want her ou tof your life, its just that she is constantly there and you cannot take the nagging and judging.  Its not fair to you or your relationship...and your realtionship will begin to suffer if she doesnt back off...<br>  <br>  if talking ot your fiance doesnt work...then take her mom out to lunch and talk...explain that you care abtou ehr and her daughter but that there needs to be boundaries because you feel suffocated.  Ask if her mother or mother in law was that present when she was caring for her kids and getting married...i bet not...so why is she doing it to you guys?  say that you understand her need to be around her grandchildren...and you will try to accomodate her, but that it is unreasonable for her to judge YOUR parenting styles...|`|AA11032586	First off you need to sit down with your fiance and make sure you guys are on the same page. If not, boy have you got a problem. If you are, great. Since it is a soon to be monster-in-law, I would have you and fiance to have a sit down, without kids around. Let fiance and mom do most of talking, your just there for moral support. Let her know this is ya'lls house, rules, ways of cleaning, etc. She needs to call whenever coming over to make sure ya'll don't have any plans. Ask her to respect ya'lls house and rules. Kill her with kindness. No loud mouthing or obscenities. Calmness will greatly intimidate her, especially if you are usually loud. Good luck.|`|dGBbFwFWaa	i believe this is something u have to talk to your wife about ..let her know how u feel about her mom coming around and the problems she causes when she stays for many days.. let your wife know that u and her are married ..and are well adults to know and decide on your own problems and most of all u two decide on the up bring of your kids.. your mother needs to cut the string loose of her daughter.. she isnt a baby no more... good luck|`|546ciq46aa	First you have to learn to be patient ,stay focused on the fact that she is the mother of your soon to be wife. You must realize that know man will ever be good enough for her, therefore you have to prove yourself worthy, so pray and ask GOD to give you want it takes to make it work, i'm sure your wife is worth that. Be blessed my friend!!!|`|Ff7mCzlPaa	You and you wife need to discuss this.  She really needs to know you feel as if your home is being invaded and you're very uncomfortable.  Your mother in law doesn't need to stay weeks on end, and you don't have to be mean to your wife about it, but you can discuss making plans for the visits...  weeks is too much.<br>  <br>  So, after talking with your wife, you need to let your mother in law know how you feel, too.  Your home, your rules, your way.  She already raised her own kids and she really needs to give advice only when asked... <br>  <br>  ugh, i feel for you
8s4pA8ASaa	The best thing you can do for yourself is see a counselor. Have you gone to one before? Most cities/towns have rape crisis centers, and they can help you find a really good counselor. Sometimes it's free (I see a free counselor). Oftentimes, they have specific counselors who help survivors of child sexual abuse. The counselor will be able to give you advice on how to work through intimacy issues. One thing I do is picture a stop sign in my head any time I feel like I might freak out. It works for me.<br>  <br>  You're very lucky to have such an understanding partner.|`|PmYpNontaa	Sounds like you have a wonderful man.  Unfortunately, he can support you with the trauma you experience, but you have to figure it out.  Trust me....it's emotional white water.....get a good therapist to figure this out.  What happened to you is not a small thing and it impacts people like us every single day......the best is yet to come.  Lots of luck......|`|UOSrSEqHaa	I'm sorry about your past but you need to remember, it's your past.

BOTH OF YOU, not just one of you.|`|AA11447210	I'd suggest you get counseling and see what a professional suggests. If you haven't been able to get over this yourself yet, it would probably benefit you to speak to someone about it, and get suggestions on the steps you can take to overcome it.<br>  <br>  Best wishes to you!|`|pJ7icz0taa	You are young and something very traumatic happened to you. because of this you have panic attacks. Talk to your doctor ..have him rec commend a councilor so that you can get past this...don't let this ruin your life.  They can give you medication for the panic attacks....mild ones like Ativan.<br>  Good luck, and take control of this now before you are 40 and still fighting it.
Mbgck2ifaa	Play it cool, don't let her know that you are really really into her, just keep doing what you are doing and look for opportunities to ask her out to a casual thing, like a party or a school sports even, what ever comes up. But don't ask her out straight away, ask her if she's going, and if she is casually mention that you're going to, and maybe you'll see her there. Then you can look for her at the game and catch a seat next to her. Just make her wonder if you are interested or not, flirt really subtly, it'll make her think about you and she might start to like you too. Don't stress about it, relax and play it cool.

By doing so you let her know you can be serious too. Ask her questions like "how does globalization affect those who are against postmodernism?". I mean, these are questions that you should know about her if you are going to develop a relationship with her or even continue to like her. See what her tastes are like in postmodernist art. Then if she agrees with Actor Network theory then you can understand that she will see you as more of a power player with agency if you can show her that you have social capital by asking restraunts to "put it on your tab".|`|27ff667901ee8ed319424150c8879cb3aa	My advice? Dont listen to people who give advice. Yes, that probably means im contradicting myself but hey, its fun. Just do what you think is right.

4KuJaHeJaa	You need to find a balance. If your boyfriend can't accept your friend, I'm sorry to say you should dump him. Try compromise with him and tell him sometimes you need to hang out with friends also. If he can't understand this and accept your friends maybe he's not right for you.
slis2OGNaa	planning a wedding is as stressful as you make it. don't lose site of what is important. you are giving your life to another person. the wedding is one day. it will come and go.|`|m25lpepOaa	A wedding is one of the most stressful events a person has to plan in their lifetime, and having to work with so many other people makes it more difficult. Planning a wedding will not set the basis for an actual marriage. Wedding plans usually consist of only set options (constantly picking between "this" and "that") when in life you will choose from a variety of options and as you learn together and grow as husband and wife, you will be able to choose easier.<br>  <br>  Don't let the wedding stress get in the way of what the wedding is- the bond between two people. I mean, although it is nice to have a good dress and the perfect cake, remember: those things are only special for one day, and you have to deal with your husband for the rest of your life.|`|GaHkxtU9aa	Its about money. Best thing to do is to compromise. When men talk about shopping around for the best bargain - the best way to get around that is to drag them with you shopping!. Trust me - no man likes to go shopping. <br>  <br>  Set aside a weekend and just spend the weekend or two or three weekends going from shop to shop, from suburb to suburb, from city to city looking for wedding dresses - and by the time you have spent travelling and looking - he will wish that he listened to you in the first place.|`|KSK22vHUaa	It's wedding pressure.  You'll be better after the wedding, I promise.<br>  <br>  That said... try to compromise a little more so you don't turn into Bridezilla.  If it gets too stressful, you could break.  That's all there is to it.  Both of you need to compromise on a good dollar amount to spend on a dress, and then you can shop around for something as close to what you want.  <br>  <br>  Having the guy you want is much much MUCH more important than having the dress you want.|`|galoGEOFaa	I think the engagement is a good way to see what's to come.<br>  <br>  What's going to happen when you find a car you want that's way more expensive than what he wants to spend?<br>  <br>  What about when you find the perfect house and he feels it's too big and expensive?<br>  <br>  Besides, you're spending $1200 on a piece of clothing that you're probably going to wear for less than 12 hours? That's $100 an hour!<br>  <br>  It's time to try to decide which is really more important...the wedding, or the marriage.

cxNLOPHNaa	The best way to "handle this" is not to handle it at all.<br>  <br>  She's an adult. She can take her of herself. Also, since you only just started dating this woman... Such a display so early on, while you're still getting to know each other, could be a signal that you may be the jealous/controlling type... A real turn-off. If you really aren't that type then back off and let her handle it herself. You don't want her mis-interpreting that as you "showing your true colours".<br>  <br>  Also, on the "other side" of this coin. Seeing how she reacts to the behaviour of those other guys, could say something about her character as well. If she appears to notice them, and ignores them or makes it very clear to them in no uncertain terms that the attention is unwelcome, then you know you she's not interested in them. But if she seems to like the attention and appears to encourage it... Then you might want to think twice about changing this from casual dating to relationship status.<br>  <br>  In any case, you should keep your behaviour professional at work. Both with her, and with any male patrons of your workplace.<br>  <br>  By the way. Jealousy doesn't show how much one cares about a person. Jealousy shows how insecure one is. Most mature women like a confident man. What you can do at work, without compromising your professional position, yet showing this woman you care, as well as looking confident and mature yourself...<br>  <br>  Next time "this" happens at work, if her reaction is to ignore them, or put them in their place. Go up to her, and say "Hey, I noticed those guys bothering you/openly gawking at you. Sorry you had to face that. But I really like how you handled yourself." By saying something along those lines, you not only did Not acknowledge your "relationship" at work, (you could have just been making a positive comment to any client). But you will have shown her an encouraging sign of respect as well. Further putting yourself, in a good light.|`|dfa0f10d091f9f82c584408f50df66a8aa	Such the gentlemen Jon...awww I had to smile at this question and have a mommy moment. *sigh*<br>  It really is up to the female how to handle these guys sorry to say, but if they start to put their hands on her inappropriately say or start to harass her you have every right in the world to set them straight...<br>  <br>  BUT... if they are just looking there is no law against that. You point out that they comment to each other but can you really hear what they are saying or are you just speculating that they are thinking nasty thoughts because maybe you have before?...not meaning to be offensive in that but just wnat you to think about it... if you hear something off color said about her or to her you become a witness and in a real polite dignified way you could ask the guys not to talk to the lady that way.<br>  You don't even have to say she's your girlfriend but just that inappropriate conduct is not permitted at the gym.<br>  <br>  <3good luck love|`|G0O1M5XZaa	I think you hit the nail right on the head on the last20 words. I think it would be good just to give her a kiss in front of them or something to let them know she is off limits now, Good luck|`|pEv3yEkpaa	just go over and kiss her and be likee are we still on for tonight babeee?<br>  or something.|`|4RsurY2xaa	huh,,,,<br>  i think u should tell the guys,,,|`|HdOVYIWjaa	I think it's kind of cute when a guy will make it known that I'm his girl, being that you work at the health club and she goes there I don't know if it will affect your job though.  <br>  You can't stop everyone from saying and thinking the things that they do.  If you really feel she is being disrespected you could say something, but it doesn't mean they will stop with their comments.<br>  The best thing I can say is that if you really like this girl, make sure you treat her right and respect her, after all she chose to be with YOU and not those other guys.|`|kYwTVi0Waa	i understand where you are comming from but saying somehting to they probably wont help much. its a matter of trust, they can look all they want and if you trust her there is nothing to worry about plus you can feel good knowing that other guys envy you for having her.|`|kRbkiPvnaa	I had the same problem when my Wife started working, then a friend asked me the question that made me feel better....<br>  <br>  Would you want a woman that no other man wanted?  If she is a good woman she will remain faithful to you, If not move on.|`|griwMyO6aa	Well guys will be guys. Usually they won't do anything but comment and make jokes. You're probably going to have to get used to it. Go up and kiss her that will probably get the best of them.|`|iAtanlT8aa	i wouldn't worry about it unless they sexually harass or asult her, because i know that i check out girls all the time and mean no harm.|`|T6Dgmxmoaa	She can take care of it herself.

If they are saying things along the lines of what they would do with her if they had the chance, you could say to them that you 2 are sort of dating and you're not going to tolerate her being disrespected. If you tow get serious and you ignor the issue, it could progress and if she ever knew you stood by and let them talk about her that way, she will be really hurt. Stand your ground. And don't forget that YOU know who she is coming home with.|`|W4eI1Td7aa	After all shes your girl and that's what counts. Men will always stare no matter what, so you cant be mad at everyone that looks at her oviously if people looking at her shes pretty so feel good you got a pretty girl. Let them make comments as long as they don't touch. Dont stress it, shes yours so let them say all they want because so many other men prob say it when shes walking alone so its best to ignore it. Now if you see someone disrespect directly or someone disrespecting her in another level then you should take action but otherwise dont even bother let them talk all they want because shes with you and thats all that matters! <br>  <br>  Good luck and remember dont let it get to you. Only act if shes being disrespected in any other level.|`|rwZB7bP2aa	You sound like you have some hidden jealousy that you haven't experienced before.  You should not confront the guys because they retaliate and get out of control.  What you should do is talk to your girlfriend and let her know how you feel about what you see at work.  Ask her if she can help you overcome this "uncomfortable" feeling.  Being a women, I know that when my husband asks me for help, it is easier to get a respectful response instead of making accusations.  Like I said, talk to her about your feelings, then ask her for help to overcome them|`|shg4egWIaa	yeah man, that's kind of a tough one. I would personally show some pda around them to send the message, but that doesn't always help, and not everyone's comfortable with that. I guess I would follow one of the other answers I saw... let her handle it. If they never approach her, than it's not hurting anyone but themselves. Maybe let her know what's going on and how you feel about it??? Hope this helps some way.|`|xzX3NSUjaa	If you say something to every guy who checks her out or makes comments, you're going to be getting into fights daily. They aren't disrespecting her..they're just being typical guys.

If they're commenting to themselves... so what. Guys will be guys. And what she doesn't know won't hurt her. But if she can hear them, that's not cool. Then you should say something. And you don't necessarily have to say anything about your relationship with her. Keep it professional. But do say something. Letting her handle it all by herself may make her think you're not that serious about her.|`|3bckCo6iaa	i think if you ever notice them talking about her and looking at her that you should just find an excuse to go over to her and then slipp her a litte kiss on the cheek or lips. showing them that you know, hey she's off limits so you can stop and yet not being too upfront about it to them either. and if it continues then you should consider saying something to them about it.|`|ecgRNdpBaa	I think that you should do something subtle to let the guys know that she's yours and ditto. Like buy her a flower or give her a little kiss at work to get them to back down. They will probably still talk a little but they won't do anything stupid or make crude remarks in front of you... which is a good thing.|`|d1ufnbXeaa	The way I see it is that if you just wait for Something to happen then the girl will think that you don't care that much about her to stand up for her, take a stand show her u care and always respect her and think of her first and foremost|`|8l9KFl2raa	Next time you hear these comments.

He should respect your wishes. A guy telling you that you shouldn't scream because your hurting, he really doesn't care. All he cares about is himself. Why be with someone who treats you that way? Find a man that cares for you and respects your wishes.|`|zLnnkTX0aa	tell him its over you can find some one that cares how you fell and not be so impatient|`|82XPLs8Zaa	break up with him, its for the best|`|0cj5FRCZaa	well this depends on how long you have been dating... and if you love him or not. my suggestion is to sit him down and talk to him about it. first of all, if you cant talk to him then you shouldnt have had sex with him in the first place. honestly you will hear it a lot and think you dont need to tell him this or that but if you do it shows that you arent afraid to express anything to him.<br>  my first time didnt hurt but it depends on the person and if they do it right. obviously you dont have to worry about him doing it right b/c you no longer have it. its ok if you regret it, i regretted it too and i know many people that do regret it their first time. yes, he will always want sex, my boyfriend does it too but i refuse and he accepts that. you HAVE to talk to him. if not then you might as well end what hasnt even started for a relationship. and he shouldnt be rejecting other girls just for sex he shouldnt be talking about sex with them in the first place if he is your boyfriend. as for the pain...you are going to hurt for a while.. think of it as a lesson well learned, and you may hurt everytime you have sex. you may even bruise, i dont but most of my friends do...but it once again depends on the guy, if he does it right and how rough he is. if you were screaming it sounds like that guy had no clue what he was doing and he went just about as rough as he could with no sympathy at all for you. you should have stopped him and in a way, that sounds like rape. And yes, i have gotten my period almost every time after ive had sex, i dont know if its just the sex or if its just me, but it happens to me too and it doesnt help at all.<br>  <br>  i dont know if i helped at all but i hope you make the right choice this time and all i can say is good luck to you. :)|`|tSmJQRU6aa	If he can't respect that you're not ready for sex, then just break up with him. It's not worth it.|`|kpg0QbHUaa	First, you are worth more than that!  You deserve a far better guy than your boyfriend.  A guy who really respected you would not have guilted you or annoyed you into having sex with him.  He would have waited until you were ready.  And that he now wants to have sex with you again only two days later when you're in pain is incredibly wrong.  He obviously doesn't care about you, he just wants to feel good.  So ask yourself, should I inflict more pain on myself for someone who doesn't care that he hurt me and only cares about himself?  If I were you, I'd say "No, I'm gonna dump his uncaring, selfish ***."  I would tell him to go have sex with all those girls he was supposedly rejecting, yeah right, if he's so damn horny.  I mean, he should have stopped the sex IMMEDIATELY when you started screaming.  I can't believe he told you you didn't have a right to scream.  That's abuse right there, whether you understand it or not.  This guy is no good.  If you had a better self image, you probably would have realized that.  I think you should consider talking to a counselor confidentially about why you got into such a situation.  You may have real self-esteem issues.<br>  <br>  I know you're upset about losing your virginity and wish you could go back and change your decision.  I wasn't happy about the way I lost my virginity and wished I could go back, but you'll eventually come to terms with it.  It is a major step, but it's not the end of the world.  Try not to worry about it too much.<br>  <br>  Also, I hope you used a condom.  If not, you should visit a doctor to check if you're pregnant after your period.  Since you only had sex two days ago, you could be pregnant and still get your period so soon after.  Lots of people don't know that.  If you do decide to have sex again when you're ready, use a condom and even another kind of birth control, like vaginal gel, every time.  If any guy says he doesn't like using condoms, you ask him what name he prefers for a girl and what name for a boy and then kick his *** to the curb.

c630401eb9baa68dddde8641339b6a29aa	It was after homecoming. We took a walk and we were still in formal clothes - I was in this silver dress that made me feel really pretty and heels, and he was in a tux. He looked so cute. We stopped by this building and just started talking. I was leaning on the wall and he was in front of me. Then all of a sudden he held my face in his hands, looked at me for a second, then leaned in and kissed me.<br>  You always hear about these disaster first kisses but mine was perfect! :] You should post yours!|`|S3uLASLnaa	Well my first kiss was with my current boyfriend of 6 months.

My boyfriend landed on me and planted a sweet soft kiss.|`|AA11584265	I was 15 and he was 15 and we were at school (walking to class hand in hand) and when we got to my classroom he stopped and kissed me right there in the hall and then said have a good day and went on his way. Everyone applauded when he kissed me because that is just what they did at my school. It was a stupid thing, but if you heard applause then someone kissed. It was kind of cool because that was the only time I ever got an applause. So its a neat memory.|`|oJdyMMkUaa	ahahaha<br>  mines cutee<br>  <br>  welll <br>  I was in grade 1<br>  and there was this boy named Joe who i had the biggest crush on<br>  I found out he liked me too...<br>  and one day he went to tell me a secret and made a kissing noise.  but the whole class thought we actually kissed!<br>  i was sooo embarassed i hid under a table, and he followed<br>  then he said to me<br>  "why dont we actually kiss so theyre not laughing at us for nothing"<br>  and i answered<br>  "uhm i dont know how"<br>  and he told me<br>  "just stick yur lips out and go like this (he made the kissing thing in the air with his lips)"<br>  so i said<br>  "ok..."<br>  and thats how it happened<br>  it was cute =)|`|NHWmBbvYaa	Oh wow, you'll enjoy this.<br>  <br>  He was the high school nerd and I was the confident, funny, outgoing bubbly girl. Basically, the popular girl.(No, not mean popular.)<br>  <br>  He liked me. I know he did because he slipped notes in my locker all the time, writing Shakespeare love poem and all the romantic crap.<br>  I thought he was sweet but my friends disagreed, I think when I asked what he didn't have that the jocks had, they said "Everything? He's a loser, Sarah, admit it."<br>  I shook my head and said he wasn't. He asked me out on a date later that very day and I said yes.<br>  He picked me up at 7 and I gotta say, it was the worst date ever!<br>  From the movie choice(He chose Halloween, I wasn't scared but he kept on excusing him for the bathroom.) to food. I knew at the end of the night, I wasn't gonna ever date him again.<br>  He sighed and said "Sarah, I know I'm not your type and this must've been the worst date you've ever had but I had fun just being with you." I was shocked and silent for a minute and he took it as rejection.<br>  "Bye then." I grabbed him by the arm and went to plant a kiss on his cheek but he turned to look to me and I kissed him right then and there.<br>  Talk about a weird first kiss.|`|N4qRQ1EVaa	I pushed her hair out of her eyes. I leaned in and planted one. She wanted more. Best day of my life!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!1|`|UY2CPmroaa	my first kiss was at the Oil Bowl (football game between the 2 rivalry schools) <br>  it was raining and i was huddling close to my at the time boyfriend.<br>  at half time i looked up at him and his kissed me right there in the rain. <br>  (:
1vaqtRI2aa	My boyfriend is the youngest and he likes girls who are nice, compassionate, positive and upbeat.<br>  Every guy is different, but my boyfriend is the youngest and definitely a soft rebel, haha.<br>  <br>  Don't try and change who you are for a guy- ALL guys like girls who are themselves, not total fakes.|`|1A1ozEaKaa	everyone is different.<br>  no one fits a specific category.<br>  sorry :(
YkhefnKRaa	Why dont you write her a letter instead and drop it off with some flowers. Just tell her how much she means to you and how much you miss her. Its always easier to write it and once you have done that its up to her. If she doesnt respond than maybe she is not as good of a friend as you think! I am 38 and have lost a couple of friends recently and truly it hasnt been that bad. Some friends are worth losing! But give it a shot you have nothing to lose!!!! Good luck!|`|EtXktTgbaa	just go apologize to her. try to figure it out. i mean 10 years is a long time. Try who knows you may get what you really want.
h7H1AWnjaa	Yes, I know EXACTLY how you feel... <br>  <br>  She probably did not understand like you said why you did not go to her first knowing that she deals with computers on a day to day basis. Maybe she took it as you did not think she knew enough to help you, so just talk to her and help her understand where you were coming from and be gentle, women have these emotions sometimes that take everything personal.. unfortunately.<br>  <br>  Good luck :)|`|D8sMuoCpaa	Youre mothers alright, youre daddys alright<br>  they just seem a little wierd<br>  <br>  Surrender: Cheap Trick.|`|Nnplp5Qqaa	Geez. I think your mum's under a lot of stress though|`|064lCmFBaa	no|`|p9gOEkSPaa	parents seem insane a lot of times for 2 major reasons. firstly they are emotional about their kids and i mean very emotional. specially the mothers and emotional ppl seem insane at times. secondly they are from a different generation. with new innovations we've entered the era of computers and tech. they were born and raised in the era of  science but they were not raised around internet technology.|`|kzmvzTeEaa	Parents are Crazy!! LOL.....Your mom is probally under some stress that u dont know about and u not asking for help made her feel like u didn't want her help, or maybe its just that time of the month idk.... This is one of those times that you need to hug her, say I'm sorry, and ask for her help. Even though you don't agree, Imagine yourself in her shoes.|`|4ZGgrp9raa	your not wrong, i think she is just having a 'moment' but if you knew she was and still is sensitive to these things maybe you should have asked her. i agree with you though|`|4fNqff7Eaa	All the parents do those crazy things, leave her alone, she are going to forget it.  And find someone else.<br>  <br>  Yes they are insane|`|qrGLcTh4aa	My stepfather WAS insane. Seriously.  He literally screamed himself into an asthma attack 2 years ago, and died from it.  If that's not crazy I don't know what is.|`|UAyCxFIRaa	who doesn't feel like their parents are insane?|`|bu6BhCnpaa	haha...its jsut one of those i love you but your insane moments...<br>  <br>  you might have asked if she could do it...but she also didnt have to react so dramatically...theres a possibility that something else is wrong...mayeb you could ask her about that...and make sure shes feeling ok...
cj8iM1Olaa	Maybe not text so much during the day. <br>  <br>  Having a conversation should come natural though. I'm in a LD relationship, and we've known each other for 5 years, and we can still talk all night long. Even if it's just trivial stupid things.|`|mVUpt8waaa	I hate girls that txt me 500 times a day.  By the end I am exhausted and the last thing i want is to spend an hour with her on the phone.|`|hnpw7xataa	Hi Lizzy <br>  This is not any easy answer because i know what you are thinking. Long distance relationships are hard enough in the first place. I am a firm believer in being able to talk to a person face to face. Truly you have only been dating 3 months and have know each other for 3 months. You and him being apart can be a good thing or bad thing and this has to be with how you look at it. When you can not talk to each other and i mean on the phone or in person that is a sure sign that you are not. I guess what i am trying to say is that being apart from him can be a good thing for you and time for you to think about it.|`|txkTyn0laa	I completely understand, im kind of in the same problem but i do get to see him on the weekends since he lives about 30/40 miles away. Me and my boyfriend have been together for 9 months and we were together all the time in the summer, so while im in school we text all day long until we get home and go on aim. So basically we just do things while talk together, i get a bit sad if theres nothing to talk about so we ask what were doing or just find a funny site to send each other so itll get the conversation moving. Perez hiltion, fmylife,  just anything, bring up a dream, a thought, anything that comes to mind. maybe even a sexy piccture :)|`|p5SAQHzBaa	My boyfriend and I went through the same thing in our long distance relationship.  We just talked ourselves out.  My boyfriend actually wrote about this time in our relationship and how we got through it.  Below is a link to our story.
Wi97GrVVaa	He knows you won't leave him, because you even broke up for his benefit at the time, and you still stuck by him. Why will he give chances to those 3 or 4 other girls who broke his heart, but not the girl who tried to fix it?<br>  <br>  Tell him that.|`|griwMyO6aa	I think he's afraid to love. You just need to give him time and guidance. These are one of the easier relationship problems to answer b/c they don't end with a sad story. Just keep doing what you're doing and maybe someday mention him how happy you are you've met him and see where that goes.|`|Xo91SKP1aa	maybe he does love you if he said so,but you have to find out if he loves you as a friend or as a girlfriend...personally i've gotten my heart broken so many times...and even though i love someone it's really hard to express my feeling because im afraid of getting hurt, maybe he feels the same|`|YbnEr1z7aa	he is unsure, he likes you but is having a hard time trusting women. give him time|`|6oZcHIjiaa	I think he will love again. It might just take some time. But when the right person comes along, he will open up again.<br>  <br>  There are two ways you take the way he is saying love you. 1) he actually does like you alot or 2) he is saying love you in the "best friend" sort of way. Which way he means, I dont know though. <br>  <br>  Maybe you should find what his opinion is on dating again and things of the sort, and see if he is ready for another relationship if you like him that much. But right now I wouldnt tell him you like him. Let him figure himself out frist. You wouldnt want to be his rebound.|`|e595f7ac7a327d1d4712b6bf5afc83f5aa	You should continue to love him as much as you can, show him how much you love him i know how he feels its really a downer, and yes hes just afraid to love.|`|SZvJVM2yaa	im gonna tell u something im a living dead i have no heart never had  never will since i was little i hated women and relationships because women always were controlling not letting men do what they want then i got older didn't like women and because they are jsut time wasters users abusers the times i was suppose to fall inlove in my highschool years were the times i saw my own cousin he was more like a brother to me he was older then me and had gotten out of highschool early as well and long story short at age 21 he had to master degrees and he had gotten married at that point his father was still alife he married his so called highschool sweetheart up to this point i never cared bout love i didnt like women becaus ehtey are too soft too mushy too over protective but now hes getting married i see how his so called wiffe well fieance is they were highschool sweethearts she married him and after his father passed away this guy lost a percentage of his fathers assets because he didnt know what to do how to convert them in his name he lsot a percentage of it he was recently married going toschool full time working part time as a programmer for a company that designed taps and dies he was the programmer for the machine he wrote the program for them he worked 4 hours from 10 pm to 2 am and came home that night he came home caught her in bed with some one else he came knocking on my window he i thought something happend to his mom he asured me she was fine then he told me what hapend to him i was always with him always till he committed suicide one day my stupid fault i took my eyes off him he had gone and gotten in an accident on purpose drove the car off the cliff and his head decapitated i had to go identify him i had promissed myself ever since in  his honor never to love never to like let alone love never to fall inlove never to belive in love never to let one love you but i was stupid i fell inlove i betraied my promiss to him in his honor so i fell inlove and went thru hell i wasnt heart broken but it was more of a mental stress nagging nagging nagging nagging bitching complaining her trying to control me this is how women are waste of time and fake so it wound up with us being togethe r5 yrs engaged and wedding fell apart thank god it did i didnt go ahead with it i would have honestly killed myselff the day  i came to my sense if i was married i had promissed i wouldnt love is fake women can not love will not love a man the way a man should be lvoed would wnat to be loved a man will put his life on the line and love a women the way she needs to be lvoed but nothing in return bottom line women are selfish they nad complain and are materialistic all they care bout is sleep get up make up wear fashionable name brand cloths go out come home late night and not even cook is that love lol no its not then the poor guy gets a divorce after years no there is no such thing as love if there was simple love in human society a brother will not backstab a brother what makes u think there is a sophisticated love in a so called relationshit therefor a women can not love because there is no love love is fake bs so therefore a guy will never be able to love or trust a women ever i mean look women cheat are  liers backstabbers and materialistic gold diggers look at firs women so called eve she couldnt control her mouth for an apple what makes u think women will control herself no there isnt love women can not will not ever love even tho a man might but women cant there is no such a thing as love we will be lucky if people first start respecting honoring then  after that comes liking then maybe lvoe but its too early this life time to love women cant even respect n honor nowdays so there is no such thing as a love and he knows it thats why he is holdingback leave him alone dont ruin his life poor guy|`|2uzOkFr7aa	Probably afraid of getting into a serious relationship because he doesn't want to get hurt. :/
AA12393776	I suggest you spin this around Zen or even christian like.<br>  <br>  Love yourself, because you can and you are lovable.  You are a child of the Universe, no less than the trees and the stars...<br>  <br>  Take each day a day at a time.  Work towards being your own ideal person. Hopefully a pattern will emerge.<br>  <br>  In the mean time you have to do something.  If nothing else, breath and eat. Very hard to just lay down and die at our age.<br>  <br>  your question reminds me of this great poem:<br>  the complete poem below.<br>  <br>  Desiderata<br>  Go placidly amid the noise and haste, and remember what peace there may be in silence. As far as possible without surrender be on good terms with all persons. Speak your truth quietly and clearly; and listen to others, even the dull and ignorant; they too have their story.<br>  <br>  Avoid loud and aggressive persons, they are vexations to the spirit. If you compare yourself with others, you may become vain and bitter; for always there will be greater and lesser persons than yourself. Enjoy your achievements as well as your plans.<br>  <br>  Keep interested in your own career, however humble; it is a real possession in the changing fortunes of time. Exercise caution in your business affairs; for the world is full of trickery. But let this not blind you to what virtue there is; many persons strive for high ideals; and everywhere life is full of heroism.<br>  <br>  Be yourself. Especially, do not feign affection. Neither be cynical about love; for in the face of all aridity and disenchantment it is perennial as the grass.<br>  <br>  Take kindly the counsel of the years, gracefully surrendering the things of youth.<br>  <br>  Nurture strength of spirit to shield you in sudden misfortune. But do not distress yourself with imaginings. Many fears are born of fatigue and loneliness. Beyond a wholesome discipline, be gentle with yourself.<br>  <br>  You are a child of the universe, no less than the trees and the stars; you have a right to be here. And whether or not it is clear to you, no doubt the universe is unfolding as it should.<br>  <br>  Therefore, be at peace with God, whatever you conceive Him to be and whatever your labours and aspirations, in the noisy confusion of life keep peace with your soul.<br>  <br>  With all its sham, drudgery and broken dreams, it is still a beautiful world. Be cheerful. Strive to be happy.|`|GLa6jrNoaa	U are the person u are u can't find ur self cuz there is nothing to find I'm 19 and I feel the same way u just have to live life with out thinking who u are cuz we r what ppl make us its hard to explain so just be u.

What he's doing is trying to see if you want to be friends. You should go over there, and wear a short skirt with no underwear. Tell him you want to watch Free Willy. When he puts the movie in, reach over and grab his crotch and tell him you wanted him to free his willy. Proceed to flash your goods, let him take it from there, and you will fall in love with him. I say this because you are never going to find a boyfriend otherwise.

cd87c1cf515692ef0adc60a28df772b0aa	Yes, you can change your name, but you may have to go to court to do it. I tried when I was a minor, and had to go to court. My mother signed the okay for it. My father, despite the fact that he never saw me and never spoke to me at that point, and had stopped paying any child support for several months, and despite the fact that I am as much my mother's child as his (so surely, she had just as much right to give me her name) still got to show up to object. The judge took his side. I think I could have gotten a lawyer or contacted a women's rights group (to defend mom's equal right to give her child her last name), but I let it got for the time. I am over 18 now and neither parent will have a say in this, and I am considering returning to court to try to change it again. IF I go back and am somehow denied, I will seek organizations, lawyers, whatever I have to, to change my name. I think my mother has just as much right to give me her last name as my father, and I know legally a child can take it's mom's last name. If parents disagree on this, I don't know what is legally supposed to take place, especially if it happens when the child has just been born and can't voice an opinion. I do know parents who agree can choose either last name, and I know at my age, I should be able to choose.<br>  <br>  When you get married, you can choose either the husband's last name or the wive's, and you can also do hypenated named. For example, if the wife's last name is Owl and the husband's last naem is Moon, you can make your last names Owl-Moon or Moon-Owl, and give the same to your children.<br>  <br>  While I certainly think your mom has just as much right for you to carry her last name, if both parents agreed on giving you dad's last name, I wouldn't change it JUST because I thought mom's last name was cooler. I'd prob. suggest you have a diff. reason for doing something like this- unless of course your dad's last name is something traumatic or offensive. Some people have the last name Rape. I would change that. I'd say sorry dad, but I am not walking around with a name that can actually trigger people and cause them to have panic attacks and flash backs. Plus, while I realize they can't help their last name, if I was about to go out with a guy and he told me his last name was rape, I wouldn't turn him down, but it would sort of make me feel icky. So yeah, if it's that bad, then I understand. Otherwise, maybe find another reason besides, it's uncool. But if you get married later and you and your wife want to take her last name and give your children her last name, or your two names hyphentated, then go for it.|`|RM2a6XDNaa	if you go to court or something and get your mum AND dad to sign a form, you can take your mums last name|`|ed9c52fcc32bc21499c8007eec999f5faa	If you live in the US, once you turn 18 you can change your name to anything you want.

Are you less happy with me?  If so, why?  And listen to what she says.  It sounds as if she is tired of you - sorry I know how that feels.|`|RtkB46peaa	It sounds like something is bothering her to change her attitude so quickly.

But what is more worrying is the fact that everything you do annoys her. What's going on between the two of you? You guys need to sit down and be completely honest. Is the love gone? Is she going through a rough time? What are her expectations and what are yours, and can you two come to an agreement? It seems like you are on two different orbits at the moment.|`|W9B6EJrWaa	H*LL no.  If you can't even put a shirt on without annoying her, then she's got a problem.  <br>  <br>  Why make it YOUR problem?  She's obviously an unhappy person.

You were really rude. She is just griping to gripe out loud. She doesn't mean it. When she starts it next time...(if you ever get back together) lean in and give her a big kiss and a smile. It will diffuse her nit picking. She will notice how much she does it. Ignore the "noise".   If you want to get back together, you better send her some roses quick. A week is too long for an apology.|`|oeEsnwSMaa	You could have said it alittle better! the problem is you should have said something to her 5month ago, and you let it build up inside, and this is the result! she will calm down. and you both need to sit down and talk. good luck!|`|wE89mPZ3aa	No you were fed up with somethings just as she was.

You will never change and this past 6 months she is really fed up with putting up with your bad habits. You just won't listen when she tries to tell you that she's not happy with the way things are between the two of you. The last straw was when you told her to shut up. You finally gave her the courage to leave.<br>  <br>  Congratulations! You win! She stopped bitching and shut up.|`|2vUOqAikaa	I really don't want to say that your were wrong, but I will say that I understand were your anger came from. Her attitude just made things hit a fever pitch. To be honest, with the way you describe this girl, I am really surprised that something like this didn't go down earlier (I assume this has been the only time). At any rate, if you're sorry then I suppose that you should go and apologize. However, when the two of you speak, you may want to tell her what her attitude is doing to you and as a result the relationship. Try to to be as cool and collected about as possible.|`|OQF1HlwRaa	ha.<br>  na. at least you didn't call her a b.<br>  what i do think you maybe were in the wrong about was letting it build up at popping off on her like that.<br>  maybeeeee she didn know she was bit***** and you just totally went off on her and scared her<br>  <br>  i think this shows how you maybe let anger build up in you which could be a problem.<br>  <br>  give her time<br>  2 years 6 months;;;even if it is you guys' time to end, she won't leave you without talking about it with you.<br>  <br>  and when it comes to talking about it, make sure you take a breather and do NOT pop off on her :]|`|KmfSCPR7aa	sounds to me like she jus bitches becuz she cheating on you. U knw when someone is cheating, everything becomes n issue. and she dont wana talk to u or return phone calls, seems like she got an easy way out. blamin u, cuz she dont like the way u talk to her so it's over|`|sCCjAKllaa	Yeah, that was wrong. Certain things you just don't say, and need to not be said.|`|dPtYPQ8saa	You should talk to her and ask her why she has changed...|`|aeLyiRczaa	No, you were not out of line.  In fact, you probably did the best thing for yourself.  The actions on her part seem to indicate that she believes that you all are already married and she is acting just like a wife.<br>  <br>  Look, keep these things in mind, if you will.<br>  <br>  How it sounds does not impact the truth of what is said.  And if someone tells you it is not what you said but how you said it, trust me, no matter how you said what they do not want to hear or admit, they can find a way for it to still be upset with you.  So say what you have to say in your way and let them pound sand.<br>  <br>  Just because a person is offended does not mean they have legitimate reason to be.<br>  <br>  A woman does a man no more a favor by being with him then he does the woman by being with her.<br>  <br>  You in part set the tone for how others treat you.  So if you find they use you or act badly toward you often, it is because you are in a way allowing them to do so.<br>  <br>  If she leaves you, yes, you will probably miss her.  But she needs to face up to how she acts and treats you as well.  Better to get this nonsense straight now then to have to do it when married.<br>  <br>  P.S.  Watch what so many of the women will say and try to tell you how you were mean or rude or whatever.  A woman can never be wrong dude, and other women seldom will fail to back her in her wrongness unless they will gain personally from it.
RpxKmUBUaa	Good question...why do we call it sleeping with someone if we're not really sleeping?|`|S3uLASLnaa	Its just a term for sex. People think love and sex are connected. So thats how the term came up.
OQF1HlwRaa	because if you are in love with that person and are giving up a part of yourself to that person, you're becoming closer with them, emotionally and physically, thus making love.|`|VRSUyeqbaa	Making Love is the Ultimate sign of your affection for your partner.|`|tHFY2hg4aa	Kind of like saying "you have to go to the powder room" versus saying "you have to take a #$%@^"|`|b8c678e20c5b368190238ab98c78d204aa	It sounds better then making sex doesn't it ?|`|GG51YaHLaa	Actually, it's because the act of sex has an affect on brain chemistry that influences the affection you feel for the other person. This reaction is stronger in males than females.|`|T7ZVlHyLaa	because sex is something you do with someone you don't really love & making love is showing affection to one another.|`|aeLyiRczaa	because it is more polite then saying that you are banging the crap out of them or ricocheting them off the head board.|`|Ebbchd1Saa	because you're doing it with love. if its just lust... it's just plain sex!!!!!! no string attached......|`|5exiXAQbaa	when your on top you say im in love lol|`|wE89mPZ3aa	It is only making love if you love the person. Without love it is just sex.
rxGrRkOraa	I'm pretty sure no. o_o Honestly though a friend shouldn't be<br>  using someone's else computer, they should've used their own<br>  to watch those things. I mean it all comes down to privacy.<br>  <br>  But anyways they wouldn't know. Unless she signed up<br>  an account and all, which I doubt since the age would be<br>  fake :] Yea.

8MnjjpJ7aa	Yes, she Likes you as well, I have never seen such a long text message, she was probably impressed with your honesty, most men leave us wondering how they really feel. Good Job Go for it.|`|AA11399706	Well, she's obviously fallen for your romantic text you sent her! :)<br>  Unless you didn't mean the things you texted her because you were 'real drunk' <br>  <br>  I'd say she's interested in you. <br>  Just get to know her and talk to her often, <br>  and youll somehow get the language of hers. ;)<br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|24caf12fd1a85e2a135854e193a0cba2aa	Of course she's interested. What girl wouldn't be after that text, and it was a damn good text considering you were drunk. It's also kind of obvious she said you were great comon if a girl says your great she's interested.|`|T7ZVlHyLaa	she is def. interested but, don't seem to needy. she knows how you feel now just let things take there course.|`|JA5wdLV9aa	Well if you really feel that way about her, and you really want a future together, then i think that text she sent you isnt enough, but at least she responded, which is a good sign. so I think she's interested!|`|Pa3hWJ5saa	yes i think she is definitely interested in you as well.|`|d0VfIV8Waa	she is most definitally interested!!!!!|`|8q265fWdaa	either she's interested or she was drunk too<br>  <br>  ask her if she wants to go out again|`|k26Vbizmaa	i wanna know soemthing.<br>  you were drunk right? did you even mean it?|`|jiOGmVlSaa	she is very interested ! but it might have been awkward for her to text back any really good comments like you did :) <br>  <br>  just talk to her in person, and im really shure things would work out. she has obviously fallen for you open, charming .. text, and personality. so go with the flow and ask her out ! there is no doubt that she would say yes. because girls absolutely love it when guys are completely open liek that, if you ever DID go out with her, you were bound to say those things to her anyways, so obviously youre have just stepped  a step ahead. so be even more curageous by askign her out ! : )<br>  <br>  good luck tyou :)|`|8JU1hxZ1aa	She likes you lol, how is that confussing.|`|nC8GRKxhaa	"sorry, ihave to respong youre great". Words have meaning, and by the looks of this i can tell you a few things. <br>  1. she said sorry i have to respond becasue: she is only responded because your message was so intense and if she didn't it would be very rude and obvious she had no interest.<br>  2. she said sorry: i think she is sorry for the fact she can't really return any of the feelings, as evidence by her saying your great rather then a whole spel about how in love with you she is.<br>  3. your great: really? i mean is that all she could think of. how about, that message blew my mind, i never thought i would met someone as amazing as you. i really appreciate everythign you said, and i have no words to describe how i feel. thats what she would have said if she was into it. but i don't think she was.<br>  <br>  You see, sending someone a text while drunk isn't always the best option. I have done it, and reagrdless of how good an idea it is at the time, you have to remeber the person recieving it is often sober, and therefore unlikely to be feeling as great as you: with a bottle of vodka laying naked on the couch. You obviously like this person, but to me its clear that the message was not good for her. She might have been a little freaked out by how intense it was. Take a step back and reevaluate the situation. I don't think she is into you as much a you are to her. Cool it down.

06f1b8496562ceae60b7c13272bc0615aa	Some, but not all. If peace is important to you (it is to me), then I suggest you look for that kind of woman who is willing to talk things out and want to solve the problem rather than dramatize it. Dont commit to any lady until you know she's that kind of woman.|`|J3JClsuQaa	Yeah, I think a lot of women do.  But then there's dudes out there that love the drama too.  Women tend to hold a grudge a little longer than men, too.  If we feel we've been wronged, then we really like to get that apology.  I'm not saying to apologize if you didn't do anything, though.  I think the gist of it is that girls hold a grudge a little longer and want to talk the problem out until the dude feels beat over the head with it... dudes don't want to do that... They want to agree to disagree and move on...|`|Mbgck2ifaa	YES! Stay away from those women! There are plenty of girls out there who would love to avoid the drama just as much as you do, and there are plenty of girls who don't play the stupid girl games with their men. For some reason, there are just some people who need drama in their lives, it drives me crazy! lol, maybe you can help me with my question <a href="http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index?qid=20090222203410AAsjkPL">http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index?...</a>|`|9ubOYou8aa	yes but its also be some man too

lAQG15kdaa	Im right near your age and so feel the same way, glad im not alone!!!
jmq2i59Jaa	does your friend know any of these people? if not put your self in her shoes. as for going out why not? just remember to be your self as you are now. if some one is being rude tell them in a nice way that wasn't called for. hey they invited you! and you never know it could be one of those best times I ever had  times. just be your self|`|PW13AMKLaa	don't feel nervous..do what your heart says and be sure to be confident
kHRK66Mwaa	I really enjoy Joe DiMaggio's Italian Chophouse in North Beach. Great atmosphere and fantastic food. <br>  <br>  Here is the resturants website - <a href="http://www.joedimaggiosrestaurant.com/" rel="nofollow">http://www.joedimaggiosrestaurant.com/</a>
aG0GR9IZaa	When  it comes to the first instance it sounds like you need to forgive yourself, and with that comes not repeating the wrong doing. Ever. Put yourself in the wife's shoes and think about how you would feel  You can't undo something like that.  If you come clean to his new wife about it, well, it  will cause a mess of problems for sure, but I think you should definitely say something to him about your choice. He can deal with his own guilt when he chooses to. <br>  <br>  Now in regards to the person you were involved with at the time I don't see why you would feel any guilt over someone who didn't want to be in an exclusive relationship with you.  If you are afraid that he will think less of you or feel as though you betrayed him somehow well lets just say that would be the most hypocritical reaction he could have.  With no ties that means that you BOTH are free to see whoever you want and if he feels its ok for him to do so but has a problem with you doing the same thing then he isn't someone you should be worried about in the first place, right? Double standard!!I know from my own experience that it isn't always the easiest thing to come out and tell someone when you have intimate relations with another person, whether or not they are taken, but it's the responsible thing to do and the mature thing too. You should tell him and feel better about yourself for it.  Then continue to do the next right thing. Its habit forming!<br>  <br>  You know, it may be a good idea or you to take some time to discover yourself a little more and learn to love yourself before you try to have a serious relationship with anyone.  It's true you can't love another without loving yourself first. If you are unable to do this alone you may consider a professional's advise. Its what they are trained to do.<br>   <br>  I wish you all the best|`|J3JClsuQaa	Guilt is a stinky, dirty thing... I've been there, most of us have.  At least, feel good that it bothers you this much.  There are people out there, that are only out for #1, and wouldn't give it much thought at all, ya know?  Chalk it up as a very important life lesson.  Now ya know that you NEVER wanna feel this again and will do what's right next time around.  And yes, there will be a next time.  You'll be okay.  : )|`|6HX4u0SRaa	okay so lets get this straight you slept with your ex who was engaged and then you slept with him again after he got married sorry lady you deserve the guilt as for the @@@hole i feel very sorry for the wife since she doesn't know about you and one day i hope she does before he does it again and he will if not with you he will find someone else so hang your head in shame there is plenty of divorceout there without someone like you adding to the mix SHAME SHAME SHAME|`|Ff7mCzlPaa	Guilt is for criminals, and you didn't commit a crime that i know of?<br>  <br>  Plus it takes two to tango, so if you were with guys who were already "taken" they were cheating.  <br>  <br>  Maybe you're not prepared for a commitment or exclusive relationship right now, so you are attracted to men who aren't really available?  Our subconscious really does come into play in our daily lives.<br>  <br>  Date!  You deserve to have a good time.  And it's ok to date more than one person.  It's okay to just date, without the expectation of commitment.|`|V610w8EXaa	You're doomed to be a "dirty whore" for the rest of your life.  You should, and will ... ALWAYS feel guilty that your "loose ethics" allowed you to be such a despicable person.  Everybody's so damn focused on "sex" these days ... where's the LOVE, people?<br>  <br>  Do you believe in God?  Well, you committed "adultery" and broke one of his commandments.  Way to go.|`|31ac7af70f781384d9825a87cc62d0f2aa	well to feel free, to feel peace..u need to perhaps confess and ask for forgiveness..<br>  <br>  go to ur ex and ask for forgiveness even if he doesn't say sorry himself..the best feeling when u feel guilty is when u let that secret out in the open and don't feel binded to it...<br>  <br>  then pray to forgive yourself...many people makes mistakes in life..so don't be so hard on yourself|`|ff700543f3408186155eccc4290362b5aa	Well, by realizing that it was 100% wrong, you are on a good path. If you didnt see anything wrong with it, I would think you werea terrible person. You must let it go, and move on. Start tomorrow as a brand new day, and start making good decisions. I've done some things in my past that I am not proud of, but have gotten my life together, and am now married with a beautiful daughter, and thank God I didnt repeat my mistakes. I have been faithful to my husband and always will be. I know this. Move on and vow to be a good person. Be good to that next guy.<br>  Good luck!!
6oZcHIjiaa	If you want to get all technical. She isnt a virgin. Just because she didnt have intercourse, she still had a different form of sex...its all sex, no matter how or what you do. <br>  <br>  With that being said, virgin or not, it is special if you think it is. If you think that by not breaking a hymen is not special then that is your opinion. <br>  <br>  Hymens can come in many different shapes and sizes and therefore there are several different ways they can be broken. So my question is, if she broke it some other way, let just say, horseback riding, would that make it less special for you??|`|AA11371251	that's lame no it doesn't matter|`|rNIFQKF9aa	I never heard anyone say it was so special when I broke her hymen|`|QoOx93PPaa	In my opinion, yes. There's been something from a guy inside of her, that doesn't mean she's not a virgin, but in my opinion that means that you didn't take away her virginity 100%; it's hard to explain.|`|pFjgBBUZaa	nope i dint think so, because i dint think most guys even feel the difference. :). plus it's the feelings that makes it spacial not broken or unbroken hymen.|`|qsWk3Fo6aa	She's still a virgin til someone hits it with the salami.|`|lKpHd1yOaa	Nah, virginity isn't anatomical.|`|z7FEj9QSaa	Well its opinion, but yeah, Its kinda rewarding to know that your the first one to ever pleasure a girl in that way, If a guy has already dug around in there its a little less special. Kinda like getting a used car that looks new but has puke stain in the seat. Its till a nice car. exept It would be nice if you didn't have to know someone puked in it.|`|uZDEa2Bcaa	It only makes it less special if you think of it that way. And since you asked this question, it looks like you already have your answer. If you love her and want to take the step further, then things like this would not matter, much less stand in the way.|`|cbt4I1cuaa	special dude she is a virgin that means no other man has ever had sex with her she is willing to give you something that she hasn't ever gave any one so what are you thinking its a gift a gift that she will never get back or be able to give anyone else you figure it out|`|YvJdkSNaaa	It shouldn't be special because it's her first time.  It should be special because you love her and she loves you.|`|2R897ziraa	Look man if its still tight and it still feels good then its special|`|gDzuFQ7zaa	Dude you dont want that **** on you! Be thankful her hymen was broke!
jPJ9MTCwaa	Maybe a lovely older building like an art museum or historic site.  We have an old train depot in my city a lot of people have their wedding/receptions at.  A lot of universities have lovely halls for conferences that can accommodate weddings.  A penthouse downtown perhaps.  Many cities have rooms available just for receptions and weddings which are nice as well.  If you want something in the country a rustic barn or even a building at a vineyard.|`|l43NSgHyaa	A lot of reception sites have spaces that can be converted for wedding ceremonies.   They can set up a room with chairs, aisle and space for the officiants to stand.    Some places have rooms specifically for this and they might have impressive views or other features particularly for indoor, non-religious ceremonies.|`|a1566efb5533aa90596e330bc315a547aa	You don't want to be inside or outside? Wow...Well, how about in the water?|`|JtEBaOdjaa	Museums, halls, art galleries, historic sites, hotels sometimes can set a meeting room up to look like a chapel.  Get creative and you can figure something out.<br>  <br>  Oh, look for wedding chapels too (not churches lol).  We found a wedding chapel where the chapel rental and officiant are $195 all inclusive.<br>  <br>  Of course we live 20 minutes from Niagara Falls. And the Falls has tons of chapels. I don't know if other cities have many of these (other than Vegas lol) and yes they are nice, not cheap and cheesy|`|diCASlUXaa	Have it in a formal dance-floor setting.|`|d9d7dbffacb9c5256ef7afd69e6023b6aa	My brother had his in a really old inn (over 150 years old) Buckley Hall Inn, in Virginia, I think.|`|hKss8M9Raa	Hotel <br>  Restaurant<br>  Bed and breakfast<br>  Museum<br>  Aquarium<br>  Where your first date was<br>  A play house/theater<br>  community center<br>  a tent<br>  the local dance hall<br>  an art gallery<br>  a convention center<br>  a destination wedding|`|DW2u5HODaa	Try <a href="http://www.eventective.com/" rel="nofollow">http://www.eventective.com/</a><br>  Make sure you do the advanced search.<br>  <br>  Good Luck!
bbP9gBu8aa	Moderation is the key =) Personally, I would tell them if you love them dearly. Another way is by letting it be & over time it will go away. If not,  find someone else you find attractive w/ out the "neediness."
u8zEMN3Oaa	Yeah, I think so.
7X9VKElxaa	Depends. She may have placed you already in the "friend zone". It can be very misleading/difficult to decipher "flirting" online. Have you guys had any form of flirtation in your relationship in the past? You need to determine if she looks at you more like a brother who she can always depend on, or as someone who she could be interested in dating and having a romantic relationship with. If you want to pursue a relationship...I would ask her out on a date. While you're on the date, try holding her hand or giving her a kiss on the cheek at the end of the night. Something very subtle that won't freak her out...or make things awkward between you guys if she does only see you as a good friend. If she responds well to your small advances, perhaps then you can go ahead and ask her how she feels. Its up to you, but I would rather find out where you stand with her so you can adjust accordingly - as compared to always wondering. Good luck!|`|26ubZfbFaa	i agree with kair_free288, but i also think that there may be potential as well.|`|9dc7211c44c17097c672d814b9900b0faa	i think that there is potential
AA12393776	Depends on the culture, your confidence, and your potential new friend.<br>  <br>  Some can go up and say hi.<br>  Since you asked this question, I would try to go with a friend.<br>  Smiling is a good start, but may not lead to anything.  If it does not, then try something else.<br>  <br>  the best time is when you and he seem to be in a good mood and that he not have too many guy friends around .. hopefully none.<br>  <br>  good luck!|`|LPCfOtiKaa	It'd be fine to go talk to him. Just think of something to talk about so you don't end up saying "Hi, I'm [name], uh....um....I gotta go, nice to meet you.."|`|8TmK8Qklaa	Just because you think a guy is hot doesn't make him unapproachable. I love it when girls smile intently at me or walk up to me and just start a conversation by introducing themselves.<br>  <br>  I don't know when the best time to talk to him would be - are you at school? Try to talk to him when he is mostly alone or at least not with his guy friends who will watch his every move and then talk about you behind your back :)|`|ftZzvkNCaa	just introduce your self|`|ohIvx6rkaa	The best time to talk to him...is when he is alone. Then he doesn't feel pressured into putting on an 'act' in front of his friends.<br>  I think you should just walk up and talk to him. Maybe just talk about a class you might have together...or a teacher you both hate! hahah<br>  Start with something small and something you both can relate to.<br>  But keep it quick and short. If you find your self running out of things to say...just end it with "it was great chatting to you, gotta run! catch you another time" or what ever :)<br>  <br>  Good luck :D <br>  You could always try and get his email or chat address...then you can start chatting to him in your own time :D|`|VOxZ2dt2aa	friend would be nice but if your friends dont know him just go up and talk to him. it helps if you have a reason to start it like your in the same class or something|`|ZzEAc5ecaa	easy one just write on a note you would like to see him alone then put your number on it so he can ring you ..|`|tYFfZLrCaa	Go and talk to him!! i had the same problem recently but i went and talked to the girl :D worked out well|`|c32aCqwqaa	dont have your friends do it... that is awkward... just go talk to him...|`|hlE3nwyGaa	Find a way to walk up and talk to him. If he looks up at you just smile and walk over and say hi.

If he says no then you can say I could have sworn it was you, and then tada you have a conversation. If he says that he was, same things apply you could say, did you find anything good? Just be cute about it, but don't say anything that could be taken as really creepy.|`|zO59ezH3aa	Just say hi and if he says hi back then just ask him Q's. Like what kind of stuff do you like to do or if u take any classes with him than talk about stuff from class. The best time to ask would be when he was just walking in the halls or alone but don't talk to fast or he will think ur weird.|`|TyQsGapmaa	Talk to him yourself, just walk up to him the next time you see him and start to run your sweet little mouth. Talk about anything, your a young girl I'm sure you can jabber on for hours about nothing.|`|rzei49A8aa	Girl talk to him, strut your stuff lmao. But Don't go by yourself go WITH a friend and talk to him, and make sure you dont get your friend to do all the talking, cause then he will pay more attention to her and take interest in her.|`|ZqDvQprCaa	just smile at him<br>  if you have a friend that knows him ask him/her to introduce him to you.<br>  if you dont have a friend who knows him just go up to him and introduce yourself to him.<br>  hope i helped :)|`|UgtEjHmcaa	Just go up and talk to him, be yourself, If he doesn't like it, then move on. Lifes too short to hesitate and never make a move, you never know what can happen, so go for it.|`|oyB3vi5Waa	Hey,same thing happened 2 me!!

If he is interested you should be able to tell. If he not you know that too. Get your spies involve and they will tell lies.|`|DwkO4Y9uaa	ahhh kids. i remember doing that back in the day. of course i had my *********-e-s go and tap-a-hoe for me. so... walk up to the guy or wink. even a nice smile will get him to think about you.|`|w0HgVh6iaa	no not at all ..smile at him then when your leaving that place where your seeing him..meet up with him and say hey then talk to him|`|rgp87jjTaa	If you walk up to him and grab his weiner without even saying anything he will rail you.|`|RfZK3FBzaa	seriously just go up to him be like you are HOT let's chill sometime. confidence my friend:)|`|F9ljq6H9aa	start small, by smiling and then work your way up to talk to him.|`|xokRgrG5aa	idk? i am tryin to find ways to ask boys out so yeah sorry|`|DzrPjcI9aa	u should go introduce urself<br>  letting ur friend do it makes u look shy<br>  after school|`|oikrOaSiaa	well i like it when girls come up to me and talk. but do whats best for you|`|X6koEo6iaa	if you have to confidence, go and talk to him!|`|Oh2RcFUMaa	Well I find it awkward but that's because i'm shy in the first place. I think that making your friend go up to the guy you like and have them tell him that you like them is SOO Middle School. Be outgoing and start a conversation with him but if your shy like me I would smile at him a little bit and kind of show him that you like him or by "mistake" bump into him and be like "oh sorry!" and start your convo there.|`|02s3iTNBaa	well I think you should just talk to him.  Keep it simple, not to emotional.  Guys have a poor attention span cute or not.  He will probably be nice and talk to you back.  He might even freak out a little because he is not use to the attention, but that doesn't mean he wants you to stop talking to him.  So go for it!  If you tell a friend to tell him and so on, that only makes what was a little something into a big deal.  Oh and when? Well when you see him not so busy or in a hurry.  Get him when he is relaxed and hanging out.|`|3bckCo6iaa	if your friends know him good then they should go over there and talk to him and bring you along with them and just introduce you to him. then it won't be as awkward if you go up to him and just start talking to him the next time you see him.|`|80e088ffca62125b41881dd24ec4c917aa	From what I've noticed about guys, they like CONFIDENCE. So, yeah, walking up and introducing yourself could be a very good idea. Just be confident when you do it.|`|b97a60cc9ef0ae8df3c5be5378159e84aa	You should go up and talk to him anytime he is open. When he's alone just go up and talk to him. I'm sure you guys can start a conversation.|`|uA0MGxyHaa	Hmm, usually if you just say hey to a guy that will start a conversation, but i mean, all guys are different so if he is really shy he may not.|`|nNE3hVV7aa	TAAAALK TO HIIIIIIIIM!
Iqtoxb5laa	He was wrong to say "You need all the friends you can get" . Because no you dont, As long as they are good friends. You dont need many|`|IT1TW63naa	he is not a friend i guarantee you that|`|1pZLQSz0aa	Dude that guys a jerk tell him to shove it|`|btCc2CRNaa	You sound like a girl.
tGGVeW3yaa	No, look you can't be wasting your time on people who don't seem to want to know you. and since you haven't heard back from her I think you've answered your own question|`|71fc8cbea5928669e06e7c42a2dd8046aa	Sounds about right to me. If someone isn't acting like a friend then they aren't your friend. The problem is you were too nice to her. Never kiss anyones butt to be your friend. They either like yu or they don't. If they don't then move on, their loss.|`|0DdSoi4Maa	I think she just didn't want to hurt your feelings.  I have friends who like me but can't simply call me back & they always have an excuse, but I really enjoy their company.  You just have to realize you don't need them & they're a waste of time.  If you're worth a friend to her, then let her come out of her way to prove it to you.  If you stop trying & she does nothing, then let her go. That's what I've done & it sucks b/c like I said I do like being friends with them but I'm not gonna wait around.  You stop trying then maybe she realizes how good of a friend you were & she really screwed up.|`|A4SU14Wwaa	No, don't be her friend. She doesn't sound like a good friend. She is using you. Don't bother with her anymore
h9FCAZ2Iaa	Hae<br>  Well I think that if a guy was flirting well he would look at you and not look away if you look back um if he didn't like you he would spread rumors avoid you.<br>  <br>  Hope that was helpful ???<br>  <br>  DON'T GET YOUR FRIENDS TO ASK A GUY OUT cause you need to be gutsy he will look it as not worth it I tried and failed
0AfsIFp0aa	yes i would after I knew she was clean. People are not prefect and u need to learn to forgive them for the sins.|`|576d3c0f5585575e4094193ccc692e9aaa	I agree with richard and luis, sometimes people like you dont think before you act.  Prostitute are human being too, and they may have done those things to support their family or their studies i have known 2 girls who are doing that and one is supporting her very ill father and her little brother and sisters and the other one just want to finish college and not as lucky as many of us that could afford and have parents that could give us a hand on those.<br>  <br>  They are good people and have dreams in life.  Hope you feel and experience something in life that would remind you of those poor girls that you just happened to pick on with your selfish and dumb questions.|`|AA12016833	If she was clean of all STDs and changed up her life, why would it matter what she has done in the past?|`|bcf393e4db41afbc89350db8fced8a1aaa	FB, SURE, under the right circumstances (i. e. she was disease-free, etc.)|`|hv3gyI9Eaa	my wife is mine,her life is past,the future of her life is our?<br>  (some people in this soo called free countryes try mess and control the others people lives)<br>  WHY YOU PEOPLE DON′T  LET OTHERS TO GET A DECENT LIFE? <br>  prostitutes are humans like you and the rest of us.<br>  is just a simple advice ,work for you and let the people of the human race live in  peace whit  others,think about it?|`|W9B6EJrWaa	That only works out in the movies. <br>  <br>  In reality, prostitutes are on drugs, have diseases, are on drugs, steal things and come from really bad situations, are on drugs, usually hate men and sex, and are on drugs. <br>  <br>  And most of them are on drugs, too.|`|kHRD7uUAaa	yes i would and if i found out later i wouldn't care as long as its left and kept in the past|`|6b7eeb4f41fa6f871211ccd21d079e24aa	It might, cuz the past catches up to the person.|`|pcjLTnwTaa	Its not true that all prostitutes are drug addicted and dirty. I have met a few prostitutes who are very clean and professional and consider themselves to be doing a good service for people who may not get that kind of attention in life. Such as people with disabilities. So they are not all the stereotype that most people think.<br>  <br>  And also, maybe some of them who are drug dependent need the help from someone who loves them to get out of their habits and clean up their lives. They are still people like the rest of us and I can't see why anyone would hold someones past against them. They haven't hurt anyone.|`|f909806a2b9c600ac6de192a33fefdd4aa	This question call for a lot of soul searching, she may have suffered residual effect (both physically and mentally) from her time in the street that she brings over to the new relationship. Then you have to think about your feeling she may be a good woman to you, do just the right thing you would want a woman to do, but when your are in your “ME” time and start thinking all she’s done, hundreds of men during her prostitute time, dozen per day. Think honestly about how that make your feel, the value you then have of her knowing as you walk hands in hand down the street or at a function you may encounter men in her past life who see her as the prostitute she use to be even though she left that life behind. How would your feel when one of those men disrespect her? It takes a very strong man to deal with that are you that man? After multiple partners per day would you be able to satisfy her? So many questions need to be answered before you make that decision.|`|ac258ba4f1436e3dfef31f6f3ab3f0c8aa	This is a yes-and-no answer for me.  Here is where I am getting stuck:<br>  <br>  If *I* was the person who chose to take this prostitute off the streets and clean her up... then I would always wonder if she wanted to go back to that lifestyle, or if I had truly changed her.<br>  <br>  BUT if I met someone who I loved, and I found out that this person had been a prostitute in the PAST, and SHE had chosen to clean up her own life and change herself for the better... then I would probably be okay with it (if she got an STD test).|`|p8RvGtNYaa	Prostitutes are basically human beings.  They are somebody's daughter and somebody's mother (if they get married).  Some do what they do to help the family and some do it because of drugs and other reasons.<br>  <br>  This question is too broad to answer as it does not take into account of the woman's circumstances and basic decency.|`|OYFoYDOaaa	"If she was clean of all STDs and changed up her life, why would it matter what she has done in the past?" lmfao i pity gemini only a woman could say this<br>  <br>  women cover up their past. the truth. i wouldn't date someone whos had it in every crevice of her body. u do yourself a favor and find a decent woman. theres nothing special about her.|`|lXpGlAm3aa	I agree with Gemini.It would be awesome for her; if he truly loved her ,and she loved him.She would just have sex with one guy.What a ton of bricks she would get off her chest.Literally.|`|U286XG21aa	Naw.. But at the same time everyone desevers a second chance...|`|sCCjAKllaa	No, I would not. That's weird and not needed.

Not necessarily ones that are like her. I never went through a bad girl phase, i always dated good girls with good morals and values because that's the kind of girl i was raised to like.

pANxH13Aaa	3 year that is 36 month which equals about 1095 day.  no she is not a hoe or a **** but human. sex is a natural human urge, and unless she is tossing the goodies around to everyone there is nothing wrong with what she is doing.|`|jiOGmVlSaa	it doesnt matter how many sex partners, it could just be the fact that a lot of people have liked her and it never worked out .. but ummh, it would depend on how these 13 came to be her sex partners. and personally, i liek guys .. but for a guy im guessing it would depend on how logn they would be together before they got married. asking if someone would marry someone else isnt the simplest question :)    <br>  this prolly just makes her attractive and wanted .. for sex.. :P|`|EbrZy7JUaa	MHM, she's a slutty whore.<br>  <br>  But then again, I'm waiting until marriage for sex.

Did she date them all? and if she didn't cheat that's also a differen't story.

AA11313793	Let's look at this - 13 partners in 3 years is an average of 4 partners per year.  I do not consider 4 partners a year to be considered a "Ho".<br>  <br>  Someone's past should be that, their past.  A person could have a new lover everynight and then find that one person they want to spend their lives with.  It should have no effect on the amount of lovers a person has had.  If you are happy with her then be happy and forget the past.|`|HiRYOKoqaa	Only if she was selling it.|`|hPFRNbW7aa	If i knew this. I wouldnt touch her.

I have had some similar issues and now am grateful they ended as they did. It would have never worked it's possible but not probable.|`|AA10065812	??<br>  Well, let's look at the figures.<br>  <br>  How many years apart are you?  No, it's not 17 years.  Why?  Because you don't reach full maturity until age 30, whereas she reached it at age 24.   So, by the tome you reach 30, she has already gathered 23 years of ADULT lifetime experience, so she's already 23 years your senior.  <br>  <br>  For the next twelve years, you will still be producing the hormones and desires of a child, which will often override your logic.  She will have to put up with this.<br>  <br>  The only reason you're a LEGAL ADULT at age 18 is because you can be drafted.  But, they don't draft you at that age because of your maturity.  You're drafted at that age because of your overall lack of maturity, and the ability to process oxygen and energy.<br>  <br>  The older you get, the harder it is to manipulate you and overcome the inherent reserve to killing someone.  Your brain is still so much mush, making it easier for them to mold you.<br>  <br>  So, do you want to date someone 23 years your senior?|`|wu2g3BtRaa	she's already been where you have yet to go... does that put it into perspective for you?  <br>  <br>  i was there once... with a man 18 years my junior.  i loved him and still do.  we still see one another on occasion but it's as friends and nothing more.  he's become the man i knew he would become and i'm still 18 years his senior... again, he has yet to go where i have already been.   don't get your hopes up... hopefully she is gentle.|`|AA11391968	I guess anything is possible.  The only experience that comes to my mind is that teacher (a movie was made) who fell in love with her 14 year old student.  Then had children and eventually married.

She has just been having fun. Even if she says that's not the case. Don't make a drama about it. It will never work in the long run. Positive on this one here.

Put it in a journal and "shut the book".|`|2P2K0rl2aa	Don't listen to all that negative crap - even from those who claim to have letters after their name.

I think there is a limit on age sometimes.  B/c she's gone through & experienced way more things than you have.

It's better to try then to not do anything at all.

AA11043457	Slowly.  Take things slow.  Just get acquainted and get to know one another.  Keep the relationship more friendship and see where it goes. You don't mention your age so i don't know if  you are way too young or what.  You can kiss him when you want to but you need to control that.  Don't get into lots of kissing or petting as that tells you he wants in your pants.  If he has a bad reputation, then he may be looking for that.  But you have only been with him a few times and so you can't know him very well, which is why you are unsure.  Just take it easy. Speak when you see one another and date if you are old enough and you wish to.  <br>  <br>  I guess it depends on where you want to go.  Do you like him?  If  you do or want to get to know him more, then talk to him and be friendly.  Get to know him.  And see if you think more of him or he of you.  You seem to want things to go a lot faster than it is going and yet you are concerned he is after sex.  Well faster it goes, the sooner you get to that point which is not good.  <br>  <br>  So go slowly.|`|0DdSoi4Maa	Sounds like he likes you & is kind of keeping distance.

txkTyn0laa	Not always, i mean people are different. Cuz a lot of girls like to keep going. Maybe have like 3 in a row until theyre done. But maybe when she does its quite intense that she doesnt wanna continue OR!! maybe she just doesnt like having long sex, thats quite common with girls|`|06f1b8496562ceae60b7c13272bc0615aa	No, she is very selfish.|`|J3JClsuQaa	Hmm that is kinda strange... usually it's the other way around, right? :)<br>  I don't know if this will help, but the only thing I can think of is once she comes (probably going at a faster pace here), maybe u could slow it way down after that??  Sometimes when my fiance does this just right, I will c*m again.  I don't know maybe you were already doing that.  Or maybe do a little oral on her after that and start again...?  Btw, I am sooo hoping u are over 18, atleast...|`|S3uLASLnaa	Sex is different for everyone. When my boyfriend and i first started it would only last 5 min because it hurt for me and it was still uncomfortable.|`|gzERnclQaa	It varies from person to person and couple to couple.  Also some girls find it painful continuing after they climax.|`|JMIKVR5waa	well sex is different for everyone i dont think its right if she only get to *** and she doesnt let you finish i mean even after she cums she should atleast give you head till you do|`|sSpOCUGNaa	dude thats a good problem|`|0792099af4d32f715881d4a39d91aee9aa	She must be dumb lol. Never heard any kind of woman say they only like to come once... I've always heard they don't have enough orgasms during sex. lol that's weird. <br>  <br>  How about you have more foreplay get to where you know you'll be close to bursting so when you have sex it'll be around the same time as her. Unless you have her think about something that will get her away from coming. <br>  <br>  I suggest talking to her! She might be lying about her coming and just wants to end the sex, you  just never know. It could be a lot of things. You might be too big it hurts her, or she might be too dry that you're hurting her, or maybe she is one of those kind of girls that can only handling coming once and it's over with which I find hard to believe in my opinion but I  could be wrong from the sound of what other people said on here.|`|Qkwrjztlaa	it doesnt matter how long or how short you go for.<br>  just ask your parenter if he/she wants to stop.<br>  or if it looks like there liking it then by all means keep going.<br>  have fun with your sex life ;]|`|cbt4I1cuaa	yes some ladies body's cant keep going afterward it takes to much out of them but on the other hand i know a few that could up to 8 or 9 times and want to keep going|`|b1ca3f5e6e5466981ff2b50c7568e497aa	7 mins is okay . Is there any sexual buildup leading to it?
U9AUkadAaa	The only thing you can do is be honest with him. It helps if you get it off your chest. Sometimes after being with a person that long things change, and you want to experience other things, and other people. Do whatever you have to do to be happy.|`|DyPVKQg6aa	Without breaking his heart?...ya thats impossible<br>  dont tell him unless youre planning on breaking up with him for this other guy. Seeing how you have been with this guy for four years and made a commitment to him for four years then you should fight through temptation. If you dont then youre going to lose your current boyfriend...of four years...<br>  <br>  Good Luck.|`|aJKpiFBlaa	ha.ha. y is your avatar exactly like mine? even with the same earrings. doubt that we're twins haaa! 2 ans. ur Q. ur guy in this case is being stupid is all.
mptnpn9maa	There are so many types of love. While you may feel love for your friend, it doesn't mean that you are in love with him. Even if the love you feel is somewhat romantic, it doesn't mean that the two of you are well suited for each other. When and if you two are meant to be together, neither one of you will have to ask.  My suggestion to you is to not over think the relationship you both share, enjoy it for the special friendship that it is right now instead of wondering what it may one day become.|`|aEbk51zSaa	u might want to love him<br>  or think u do<br>  u may like him very much<br>  <br>  if u were really close when u went out<br>  nd if u felt like that bak then<br>  then i think u may be <br>  <br>  answer mine plz?<br>  <a href="http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index?qid=20090222203353AALTtLG">http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index?...</a>|`|pcI25NXzaa	Yeah. When you look past faults and accept the way someone is, and really care about them, that's love, in my opinion.just make sure his faults arent the type that are not a big deal but then like two years into the relationship youre pulling your hair out. As far as his gf goes, i wouldnt say try to break him up, but try to tell him like love isn't what he's feeling (if indeed it is not) and maybe he'll just realize that you care about him/should be together.|`|YZv4rOJ7aa	maybe its just an attachment.  sorry i had similar feelings in a similar kind of thing recently and i got a real not so good suprise as to what he thought of the "relationship".  i suppose you have to put it on the line and ask his feelings if you really want to know.  he'll tell you - they usually do, good or bad.  its best to do that and deal with what he says than to keep guessing.  guessing takes your mind often times other places than reality.
9851deb6f5776ae6834cf0b79571e624aa	Quit playing his game as long as he knows he is getting to you (Good way or bad) it is his game so yea tell him to stop but do not turn around and then text him. If you have really moved on then move on. Some how I think you are not sure or you would have told him to leave you alone already not on here asking advice. Good luck with your choice. I just read your profile you seem like a up and positve person do not let this guy bring you down.

AA11399706	Like everyone says, it's great the way it is. <br>  BUT since you really seem to wanna change it, <br>  you should go darker or redder. <br>  <br>  How about jet black? (with hint of red or purple in the sunlight?)<br>  :)|`|W4eI1Td7aa	your hair looks very nice as it it, i dont think you should die it if this is yur natural color keep it because the dye chemicals mess up your hair and your hair looks healthy and shiny.|`|576d3c0f5585575e4094193ccc692e9aaa	I think you can dye it with dark copper blonde and then high lights in blonde|`|8q265fWdaa	dyed hair falls out and turns gray sooner at a younger age<br>  <br>  plus it gets frail and gross<br>  <br>  you're already so pretty<br>  <br>  natural beauty is so much better than fake|`|QSQV6PJ8aa	dont dye it.<br>  i made that mistake.<br>  original and natural = something that no one else has.|`|h9FCAZ2Iaa	Black it would bring out your eyes but go for a semi pemanent other wise if it don't suit you then you cant wash it out|`|LVa6Wr63aa	your hair color looks pretty nice as is...if you're looking for a change maybe go shorter? as long as you don't do anything too drastic color or style wise you'll still look good.|`|HzR9PrqAaa	one i think your really hot the way you are and youd look good in pink|`|v1tHjJ3haa	it's gorgeous, don't !

I prefer it when girls don't dye their hair to begin with, but you definitely shouldn't.<br>  Why? Well, to start off with, you're gorgeous anyways. You are one of the absolute most pretty girls I've seen on here. Heck, even out of the girls I've seen in real life you're freaking beautiful. And your hair? I absolutely love it. You have amazing hair. <br>  <br>  If I could make your hair any other color, what would it be?<br>  I wouldn't. Yours is perfect. Not even joking.<br>  <br>  I want to meet you, so I can yell some sense into you. ;)<br>  hahaha. Have a nice life.|`|828e8681c299a009930f6174f5138b49aa	Your natural hair color has a red tint to it? It looks lovely.<br>  <br>  If you want a change though, I think dying it a dark brown (like your dark haired friend standing next to your blonde friend) AND add caramel highlights.|`|g1ciF3DVaa	i really think its fine as it is. . .<br>  <br>  pretty cute.<br>  <br>  but if you do anything, maybe try going with shorter hair...and umm darker?|`|AA11266289	leaveeeeeee it like that<br>  <br>  sorry but asian girls dont look good with anything but natural|`|AA11119702	your hair is GORGEOUS<br>  pleaseeee dont change it, it looks so healthy and shining and voluminous<br>  the color is soo pretty btw, ur luckyy 2 havee that as your naturall!|`|ewQ0mLxsaa	It already looks really good on you, I wouldnt change it to be honest lol.|`|T6Dgmxmoaa	AHH you are so cute!

5Uot2bzLaa	As much as it sucks, what you describe happens to many people at the end of a relationship.  You feel a mixture of depression and grief for the loss.  The symptoms you listed can easily be attributed to depression and grief.  For most people, the fog will begin to lift within a few weeks.  If it doesn't, you should speak to a doctor about counseling or an antidepressant.  You can start with your primary doctor if you don't know of a specialist to go to.|`|JxY5WXF2aa	No that is perfectly normal. I have experienced this as well. You are depressed and you don't even know it. It's just a way of grieving after a lost or feeling of lost from a relationship. Once life goes on we start to see things in a better way and then as you said all is good again.|`|Mbgck2ifaa	Thats exactly how i felt the first time i had my heartbroken, the second time it wasn't as bad because he tried to end it on good terms, my first boyfriend just started sleeping with my friends rather than be a man and come out with it, so yea, that's how i felt when my heart broke. It means you really loved him, but it gets better. Just be careful with your heart in new relationships, it helped me. Good luck! help me with my question <a href="http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index?qid=20090222203410AAsjkPL">http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index?...</a>|`|mJ8T1soxaa	Yes..i don't want to eat..i have trouble sleeping..so lost and confused..i just feel sick..and sick of life..its normal.|`|rRlD215Paa	I think it's fairly common.  I lost fifteen pounds when my boyfriend/almost fiance cheated on me.  It was bad it actually made me physically sick and important girl stuff stopped happening I was so stressed out.  That was a while ago and I am finally recovering.  I still feel the emptiness though sometimes.|`|RXzj8vg2aa	perfectly normal...thats heartbreak at its best(worst).  Kind of a sucky feeling, like someone ripped out your heart kinda feeling.
uPBzcMX0aa	okay for the first question, if your bestfriend is doing this than she isnt a true friend at all only true friends doesnt leave.. what you do is you just ignore her and find someone that is more like you and be less like them :) and tell that bestfriend of yours to grow up its obvious shes a bully... <br>  <br>  the second question... what in the hades is take the pee??<br>  but im guessing they are being mean right? well just ignore them too <br>  if they are making fun of you then that means they like you or they like the fact that you like him.. if they are that imature, then find someone els thier is plenty of boys in this world..<br>  3. that is rude but, guys tend to do that, be yourself around him if it doesnt work then take a hike, <br>  4.you do have friends you just dont no it yet, i was in this situation once but that was 9th grade and now im in the 11th my advice is i just moved on and found another friend that is happy for the way i am :))
1vaqtRI2aa	Girls are better than guys.<br>  <br>  Simple as that.|`|560LwXoKaa	I find it just plain gross but i think some girls do it to get attention from guys and i know that some guys find it hot(i don't get it but whatever)<br>  girls who do that have low self asteem and not enough male attention in there lives- i.e. non-present father|`|8JU1hxZ1aa	simple, because guys dig it. So girls do it to get guys which makes no sense but it works ^_^|`|xzX3NSUjaa	Women are different than men. We can admire another woman's beauty and even be sexual with another woman without being gay. 2 women together is acceptable these days..where 2 men together isn't. Men also have that whole "ego" manly thing going on. We don't have that..some girls just do it so they can say they have done it and it was a great experience.|`|GtPnXzPAaa	Because it's fun and we like to put on a show for you.|`|RpxKmUBUaa	I think it's gross, but my guess is, to get your motor running...:/|`|JzTg0hg5aa	well most girls don't, but some do it to get attention from guys or just practice. well, hope i helped.<br>  <br>  <br>  good luck [:
V610w8EXaa	Forget the player ... date the friend.<br>  <br>  Player will cheat on you ... he acts really nice because he "wants" something from you ... ya know?<br>  <br>  Friend will eventually give up on you when you find a steady boyfriend, because he will realize that he is trapped forever in the "friend" zone, which is the equivalent of HELL, when you're talking about a hot girl you'd like to be in love with ...<br>  <br>  ... so why not give it a try?
XKTZbxBPaa	Not always. Most of the time she'll be flirting, but sometime she just wants a favor done or wants to make friends with you.|`|2tn8EALqaa	NO<br>  Dam guys are dumb and annoying!!!|`|qXpxILnRaa	If she smiles at you all the time, like eveytime that you see each other. Now if she just smiles shes just being friendly, but if she smiles flirtitiously or stares then she's interested. Or if she even looks at you from a distance, like you catch her looking at you frequently then she's pretty much interested in you. Hope my advice works! :)|`|8kMZwgOuaa	hmm . well did you smile at her??<br>  she probabally thinkks your cute. <br>  or maybe shes just being friendly.<br>  its hard to say.|`|xxvLfLrYaa	not really, some are just polite|`|VOxZ2dt2aa	lol no|`|I2wPn0Zlaa	it means your were prob staring at her first and she is being polite by smiling back|`|BYTPpcNZaa	maybe|`|05gBNxJcaa	she is flirting, shy, or thinks your funny looking.<br>  im pretty sure you can tell. just remember girls usually <br>  wait for guys to talk to them..so go for it if you feel "the look"<br>  :]|`|891163e341b6df2267c2814852e70145aa	it depends on tha gurl, if u kno that she is friendly then she wuz juss nice. but if she is being flirty then she is most definitely interested in you. Hope i've helped you :)|`|B97UyW0Faa	no, it means she is friendly<br>  <br>  next time it happens use an opener, dhv and run solid game<br>  <br>  if you don't know what those are, go to rsd nation.com|`|MPbB0ri1aa	Not necessarily. She make just being friendly. There is more to flirting then just smiling.|`|lxLeeYA5aa	Try to talk to her. Most likely she's flirting, but not always.|`|03f0a9d551a5416ac048517c4d07fe35aa	not necessarily.|`|sVg4Qco0aa	No. She is just friendly.|`|FSruw622aa	I would only take answers that any ANY girl says...|`|zLnnkTX0aa	no get real its just a smile|`|EozYN8ynaa	she could just be nice. i'm always smiling.|`|RuQsLaCraa	You should know... or be able to tell, eyes tell more than a smile though.<br>  <br>  Most likley yes, but i wouldn't go to her and say WANNA GO OUTS?!?!<br>  <br>  should make you want to get to know her and from there u'll be able to tell THIS GIRL WANTS MY MAN MEAT, OR SHES ENJOYS SMILING FOR THE HELL OF IT.|`|D4mT82Wtaa	Dude i wish but she probably isn't. If she keeps doing it and you are still wondering then just go up and talk with her. If you like her then go for it.|`|iwYPv2dyaa	it could really mean either, i smile at guys that i know, but not very well in the hall.  but i also smile at people im interested in. next time you see her be like "hey whats your name again?"|`|cbWfIKaYaa	She may just be really friendly, or perhaps just in a really great mood at that time.

Also let her see you looking at her but dont me obvious pretend you dont know she knows and than shell think your interested. Good Luck!|`|HXU9kDQjaa	Uh... just because a girl smiles at you doesnt mean they like you. She is probably only trying to be friendly... Don't go to fast dude.|`|JEOAknkfaa	Possibly, but not always..|`|lDlk3jCqaa	maybe, but she could be the type of girl who just smiles at everyone to be nice, like me.|`|Of1iEnT1aa	sometimes but not always|`|d6aeaede0ad891b9c29939a2eb665e11aa	i think no, maybe shes just being friendly with you,or maybe  it depends on how a person thinks about you...|`|NoOo05Xxaa	Nope, shes just being friendly.
6oZcHIjiaa	HAHA that is kinda funny. Im sry. <br>  <br>  I think you are over reacting. He is obviously liking you if the two of you are dating. And she doesnt sound like someone you should be jealous of. If all she has is her boobs....<br>  <br>  Honestly, just because you dont like someone, doesnt mean that your friends shouldnt like them too. I know that it bugs me when people only talk to me because they are friends with one of my friends, but then when they get into a fight and we stop talking that is the stupidest thing, cause they did nothing to me. And I have no reason not to stop being friends with them.

Get him to do stuff to get you turned on to get you wet. The first time will not be that good, its going to most probs hurt, plus you might bleed. Try buying some lube as well and put it on your ... and his ... b4 you attempt putting it in. You may also want your boyfriend to start with fingers and increase the number of fingers to stretch it out a bit. You can buy lube from any shppers drug mart store ect. They are around 10 dollars and you can get warming and tingling for example which is suppose to make it feel better for you.|`|yI5ldlc1aa	this happens to me. I have a pretty big dick. Just have him lick you down there and then lick and suck on his and get eachother real wet, it will go in just fine. if that doesn't work have him finger in and losen you up a little. then put lotion or something on his dick and it'll go in.|`|ZILVBVRbaa	there's a lot of reasons for this, but two typically come to mind right now.  first of all, you're probably nervous!  relax!!  second, maybe you are too dry- try lube or foreplay to moisten up (i'm being completely serious).|`|RIw8iITtaa	It depends.

7CJPtG0caa	shes playin u|`|DVRSCYU1aa	a man only has limitation to think dat women is playing or cheating --may be or may nt be ..bt it compleltly depends wat situation came across her ,u were straight forward to her ..so as everyone says she is playing --ur stuck like a piece between 2 people widout any reason and both r blaming u ..firstly u figure out if u have made any mistake,,if u havent --den dont be bored of both d crap people -let them bark wat evr they bark ,,secondly make clear ecah and evry bit dat u nevr thought of any such crap and ur nt into al dis **** ..say them nt to use u as scape goat.it wud have been dat things went wrong between them and u came in ..she started flirting wid u -as  u said ur an honest man --and as u said -(-. I told her i wasn't going to kiss her butt to be my friend and that was that.) may be she is just time pass lady who uses men for her needs and upcoming in life for fame and money ..COZ AS U KNOW WOMEN JUS A BIG BLOODY FLIRT ,how can  ucall her ur friend when u dont knw wether she hates u ,,wether she likes u or uses u for money and outgoing like party,clubs and things and so for ..<br>  <br>  either ur nt able to take up dat she yet likes d guy  and ur friendship or u only want to be ur time pass piece ..ask ur self wat kind d women is off .u may have better picture dat wat kind of character she carries .|`|rwZB7bP2aa	She is playing you.  When she wants the attention she will come looking for it.   Give yourself the satisfaction that you tried to be her friend, gave it  your all and find a real friend who will respect you, listen to you, defend you, talk to you and love you for who you are.<br>  I had "friends" like that.  They only wanted to be your friend if you had something that they wanted.  They take and then stab you in the back.<br>  Like I said, find a friend that you would consider your sister and be treated back as if she was your sister.
SdOtY7Isaa	-time heals everything<br>  -the best revenge is being happy without them<br>  -everyone goes through this at some point<br>  -tought it out. sunny days are ahead.<br>  -surround yourself with positive people.<br>  <br>  <br>  keep that mindset.|`|pgmXNpuOaa	well I still am not over mine....he is still  one of my best friends but it hurts to be around him because I still have a lot of feelings for him.  But I just look at it as at least we are still best friends.|`|wr2uiZk7aa	Get yourself occupied with other things so as to keep it out of your mind.  It'll go away as time goes by.|`|aycP5Krtaa	time and friends|`|aG0GR9IZaa	Use the time spent down-in-the-dumps to focus on yourself. Work on the things you might have been putting off or do something you have always wanted to do but maybe couldn't for one reason or another. Spoil yourself a little. It won't hurt. Try to not focus too much on your ex and any woulda-coulda-shouldas. It will only serve to keep you feeling miserable longer.<br>  I don't know your situation but I am going through something  similar myself. I know how hard it can be especially if you were together for a long time. Keep doing positive things in your life for others and yourself. Eventually it gets easier. Really it does. In fact you already said so yourself didn't you? =>|`|NfE70Vr8aa	I am in the same boat as you right now. But I find it easier when I surround myself with friends and family. They will be there to support you. I have been very blessed/lucky that me and my ex are still best friends. But it will be hard and it will take time to get those feeling back in order. Good Luck and stick in there.|`|rxGrRkOraa	Well, what I would do is draw out a chart. And see what I got off the relationship. I would make one row for the things I didn't get off the relationship and the other for what I did get. This usually makes me realize how much the guy ends up being a jerk or never really took the relationship seriously. =/<br>  <br>  But another way could be. Try new things out. Find a hobby. And hang out with your friends a little more to get your mind off things. xD<br>  I hope you feel better :) Just know. you deserve so much better.|`|05gBNxJcaa	col lol.<br>  <br>  the best thing is get out of the house.<br>  do alot. even if u dont want to ...<br>  call up friends...family or whatever..<br>  stay busy.<br>  also. cry. dont be afraid to do it..u need to let it out.<br>  but srsly try to stay occupied and busy.<br>  <br>  also the worst thing alot of us do is get heartbroken over <br>  reminising on the "good times" but just remember, there was a reason why you broke up..try to focus on the **** u went through<br>  and remember don't blame yourself.<br>  be happy and get rid of his crap! :]|`|Jg6Z3dUsaa	Take a small trip for yourself to forget. hang out with your friends. Do something you always wanted to do. Hang in there, this kinda stuff sucks but when you get through it it probbly happened for a reason.|`|zMJDtFgGaa	Get laid. Like about 10 months ago my wife left me and I went to the bar and wound up in bed with a chick that wanted me to choke her. Nothing helps you get over an ex like chocking a B@#ch.|`|tlhhL20Jaa	first of all. get rid of all evidence of them. Delete their number, erase them off your myspace or whatever, let your friends know not to mention them so you dont get depressed.|`|cOkUsbleaa	Well you can go out and party with a few of your friends, meet up with some guys.....that is always the best way!|`|COZf4bMYaa	do it a lot, with a lot of people.|`|8SRjELNBaa	Torturing my body physically at the gym is a short term answer.|`|RpxKmUBUaa	Sing an dance to your fav music with your friends!!!

What is wrong?  How long has this been happening?  How long was your sex life "good" before that.|`|IvMPh09baa	yea, theres a genius idea go cheat on him and that will solve your marital problems, right?<br>  <br>  are you kidding me... come on...|`|W9B6EJrWaa	I highly recommend cheating, it's fun and there's nothing like a little strange d**k to give your life a little perspective.  <br>  <br>  Quit pestering your husband!  Go to a bar and pick up a total stranger, go to a motel room, and bang away all that frustration.  <br>  <br>  You'll love it.|`|NWH3MnE9aa	Take a look at the question I've just asked ... one or two away from yours. I'm the husband who doesn't want to have sex with his wife. I'm getting what I want on the side, so yes, cheat.|`|RtkB46peaa	Perhaps you should figure out what's going on with your husband.  One thing tho, find out without complaining or nagging... that's key.|`|b8c678e20c5b368190238ab98c78d204aa	There are some mighty good vibrators out there go buy one and you might not ever want your husband again. That's if you buy the right one some of them makes you feel like you have been to heaven and back. Only kidding about the husband thing nothing can replace a man that knows what he is doing.Maybe if you surprise your husband with a sex toy he will open up and want you all that much more. It doesn't take long for a husband to get tired of the same old thing. If the toy isn't your thing just try something different. Could be it has nothing to do with sex but a deeper problem talk to him ask him what the problem is if he refuses to talk about it let it go he will work it out that's all you can do. Just don't do anything stupid like go out with your girl friends drinking and flirting with guys because it will get back to your husband then you will have a problem with him. Lets hope your husband hasn't done anything stupid like that or worse yet. If he is depressed about something that will do it and i know from experience that when a husband holds back sex from his wife he is getting it from another woman preferably from a co-worker or an old girl friend.|`|aLgY4l3Naa	No you don't cheat, you sit down and talk to him about it!! There is obviously a problem and between the two of you its needs to be fixed, you need to be honest with him and let him know how you feel, don't leave anything for him to wonder about just lay all out on the table and go from there!! You also might consider getting some marriage counseling, sounds like there are some under lying issues that need to be addressed and your husband might now know how to communicate these things, what ever happens you need to give it your best to make your marriage work, its always easy to just throw in the towel, but it takes a lot more to stick it through and continue to work at the marriage together, with commitment to each other and the love you share it could happen so don't give up hope!! Good luck to you and i wish you the best!! But just remember an affair is NEVER THE ANSWER TO MARITAL PROBLEMS!!|`|C59bTKO2aa	Have you asked him why he won't have sex?  I wouldn't advise cheating, there is something wrong in your marriage, and if there is any possibility of working on repairing your marriage adding another serious problem like cheating with severely narrow your chances of ever resolving this.|`|kHRD7uUAaa	well cheating is a option and sooner or later you either have to accept you will never have sex again or leave him.  Its easy for so many to say oh don't cheat but get real the reality is you either go without for ever or you cheat.|`|S3UxNOhdaa	Unless he's got a medical problem or depression, he's cheating on you with someone else. He's emotionally disconnected from you.|`|rawz0RJuaa	give more detail. what are his reasons? have you talked to him about it? does he push you away or what?<br>  <br>  and no never cheat!!|`|zFx7NT2Baa	You have a lot of good and serious advice here.  Tennie is spot on unless there is another woman.  Open up and talk about the matter.|`|p8RvGtNYaa	Are you coming to this column for approval?|`|aeLyiRczaa	I will give you the same answer I give to men.  First, try to figure out what is going on, which may be hard for he may not communicate or admit there is a problem at all.  Consider that he may be cheating on you.  Also consider that maybe you have hurt him badly and do not realize or accept that you have done so.<br>  <br>  If you all have any religious background, explain to him that as his mate, you have every right to expect sex with him.  If he has a med. problem, he needs to do what he can to get it treated.  He also can use other parts to try to help you out even if twinky is not working.  <br>  <br>  Explain to him that as a husband and wife, you do not own your body anymore but have given it to the other.  Also explain to him that we are not to withhold sex with our mate but for an agreed upon time lest the other spouse may be tempted to cheat.  Lastly, as him two things.  Ask him if he is ready for you to enjoy someone else and then if he is ready to shoulder half the blame for it.  For if he is able but will not have sex with you, he is partially responsible if you do cheat.<br>  <br>  Good luck.  I hope you all work it out.|`|Dn8xd0Kuaa	You should never cheat.  If you do you will only make your problem worse.  It's never right to cheat. Talk to your husband honestly and let him know what you're thinking and how you will like for him to make love to you more often, or if that doesn't work maybe you two should go to a marriage counselor who will be able to guide you in a better direction than cheating . Good luck to you two and i hope you make the right decision.|`|AA10494978	Well, that's usually a sign of something deeper.  Have you guys going through a stressful situation lately?  Is there something else that is going on?  If you have, maybe you should check into the possibility of having a few marriage therapy sessions.  When physical contact stops, usually communication preceeds it.  <br>  <br>  I don't want to jump to a conclusion about what your husband is doing, but ususally lack of intimacy is a sign of infidelity.  So, definitely check into the possibility of having some counseling sessions with your husband.|`|VXvq83lIaa	Don't cheat! Are you a whore? Two wrongs don't make it right. This is what you do sweetie, listen. Only if you are positive he isn't screwing some other chick:<br>  <br>  1. First, you come on to him. Get your hair done, wear some light make up with shiny, glittery lip gloss. Get your nails done. Smell really nice for him right out of a hot bubble bath. MAKE SURE YOU ARE PROPERLY SHAVED IN ALL AREAS EVEN IF YOU DON' T NORMALLY DO SO!. Put on a g-string and nothing else! If you are a little overweight, wear something else like little see through shorts and a tank top...then seduce him! When he comes home, be all up on him, kissing and caressing him. Grab is penis out his pants and play with it and tell him how much you miss it and kiss it. He should definitely be getting hard by now, if not....HIS AZZ IS CHEATING.<br>  <br>  2. The next day, tell him you wanna go to the doctor to get a check up because you don't trust him and you wanna make sure neither of you has any STD'S. This will shock the hell out of him and I'm sure it will rule him out from messing with the mistress, then maybe he'll start to appreciate monogamy.<br>  <br>  3. If all else fails, stop asking him for sex. He'll begin to think you're getting it from elsewhere and jealously is always key.|`|tHFY2hg4aa	You know your husband better than all of us (hopefully). You should talk to him about it anyways, because some guys slack off when they find interest in some other woman. Not saying it is the case, but something is definitely going south here. You have every right to be concerned, so if he won't tell you anything useful, do some detective work. <br>  If he is cheating on you, divorce him. Don't just go out and cheat on him too. Two wrongs don't make a right.|`|e5dc164a9700e6d8db77bbc63baa658aaa	I'm in the same boat honey! It sucks I'm so randy that I cant hardly stand it. My hubby's problem is hes on meds that interfere and so I could have sex alot or have him act like an ***. I prefere him not to be an ***.  But I tell u that its getting to the point of me wanting to cheat.<br>  wish that I could be of better help.|`|4iUhdKKiaa	talk 2 him 2 find out whats up.  i bet hes cheating though.  men love sex and will get it even if not w u.|`|Ebbchd1Saa	no cheating................ you'll just ruin your marriage. just seduce him.|`|GegQJNzSaa	you may as well,sounds like he is a step ahead of you
01ec5b9cdec921ba8997a4653b265e95aa	some times, as a friend, you have to make tough decisions on behalf of your friends.  shatoya needs your support.  she also needs professional help and guidance, which unfortunately you can not give her.  i think you need to tell someone.  whether it's her parents (only if they are sane and supportive people), a police officer (someone who is capable of handling rape victims) or just a professional/support group for rape victims.  you need to help this girl.  and she may be mad at you, resent you, or decide not to talk to you ever again BUT at least you did what you could for her.|`|zguucR8yaa	First of all, you really should take her name out of your question.<br>  She told you this because she trusted you to keep quiet, don't break her trust. If she wants other people to know, it's her place to tell and not yours.
BxYWNm31aa	someone who i have lots in common, holds a conversation, who is fun, who is nice, someone passionate, someone i could hold forever.<br>  good thing is i found her but bad thing is that we dont talk no more. i dont know why, we just stopped.|`|E6kJE2x2aa	I think a special girl is the one you lost your virginity to.

OIAODVcHaa	Being attractive is not extremely important. I mean, I want someone who is well-groomed and tall and not deformed, but I'm not looking for someone "hot". <br>  1. I really want a guy who can laugh at himself. Humility is really, really attractive. Some guys just get all offended when they're teased and they think they always have to "prove themselves"-- that is just so ugly and immature.<br>  2. I want a guy who cares about other people. Like, genuinely focused on making other people comfortable.<br>  3. I want a guy who likes me. If a guy is good for me in many ways, but he doesn't bother with getting to know ME, I don't bother with him. Maybe that sounds selfish, but I want someone who cares about me.<br>  4. I want a guy who doesn't have a mean sense of humor. I think there are a lot of genuinely nice people out there, but when they tease people, that little mean streak starts to show, and it is such a turn off. Guys who laugh at other people's discomfort gross me out.<br>  5. I want a guy who will take charge. This is sort of like number four...if a guy is too lazy to do the work and "chase" me, I'm not going to bother with him. He can find some other girl who doesn't want to be chased.<br>  So yeah...these are some of the things that are most important to me as an individual. I can tell you what most women look for in a man-- Intelligence, humor, and confidence.|`|FROfw46Yaa	A sense of humor and intelligence are what I look for first. He doesn't have to be the next Einstein or anything, but I appreciate a guy who's knowledgeable in something and understands some of what's going on in the world. Sarcasm is good, as it blends both of these qualities, as long as it's obvious that the guy's joking around and not being mean. <br>  <br>  That said, he should also be kind/caring. If he respects me, I'll respect him. <br>  <br>  As long as he has those qualities, looks don't matter.|`|Gl7tkWV7aa	Someone you can depend on. Reliable, but can also be spontaneous. Not selfish, but not so unselfish that he never takes time to take care of himself. A completely honest person. Usually someone who has similar interests, or is willing to give my interests a try. Smart. Doesn't have to be extremely smart, but we should be able to carry on a conversation without getting bored. Humor is nice too.|`|MyVtwtOnaa	sense of humor and intelligence
cbWfIKaYaa	Yes I was a virgin until I was 17 and the guy I lost it to is now my husband. You have no reason to feel like you don't fit any just because you haven't slept with the first girl to look at you. If you want to wait then wait, no one should make you feel bad about your decision and I bet most of these people later down the road will regret sleeping with someone at this age.|`|W4eI1Td7aa	don't rush it, its not a race, wait for the right girl.<br>  I was 19 when i lost it, and i wish i could of had waited for the right person actually because at the time the person i though i likedd alot was just a phase.|`|JzTg0hg5aa	virgin 13.<br>  <br>  ive done other things [makeout, handjob, ect.] but im still a virgin [:|`|tSmJQRU6aa	well im 14 ill be 15 in a couple of months and i am a virgin.|`|MPfj42xDaa	yes|`|FbqaJm0paa	Yes, I still.

O0pYOOpAaa	Dude, it sounds like you need to build experience with women. I suggest you go out and meet some and start conversating with them. I also suggest that you go to a community college and socialize with the opposite sex. Go to a club, bring your friends, and get to know women.<br>  <br>  Start analyzing them and find out what works. If you're way below average looking, then you need to get a girl that is in your league.<br>  <br>  Source: my guy perspective|`|pANxH13Aaa	stop chasing them "Good things come to those who wait", and until then use those two things on your wrists the good lord gave you, as a mean of lovin'. Because real love can't be rushed.|`|KqxoYgUYaa	I'm sorry. I get this alot too. I recently became friends with a guy and talked to him through IM's and just when I need the encouragement or a listening ear, he just suddenly stops responding. That's what I get, a guy who is not emotionally available. I was engaged to a man over a year ago that decided to be emotionally unavailable at the worst possible time in my life when my niece nearly died from E Coli poisoning. So, to get lack of encouragement from some recent stresses I've had to encounter made me realize that this new friend isn't right for me either. It's really sad and frustrating to me because it's humiliating every time you put your heart out and you get crushed.<br>  <br>  Just keep moving forward and thinking about the future, that someone special will come along... the anticipation of it all keeps me optimistic. Maybe reach out for some hobbies. Stop making it a focus for your value as a person. I think I do that too, and I'm 28 and still learning how to be happy single. I use to cry after weddings, now I just dance the night away and go home happy because I got to party. lol I just have to keep looking at things that way, that I can still be happy but I have to choose where I find my happiness.|`|YWcsgdiUaa	aww...<br>  <br>  I say, go out more often...even if it is to the mall, grocery store, or park....get out, try and meet as many people as you can.  When you develop a network of people that you know...chance of getting to know someone that you can get to know more than just a friend is better.<br>  <br>  Never give up on yourself...!!!  Who always have to ask yourself, who's world is this? The world is yours!  You ultimately have to make the decisions that create your life.  No one else will do that for you....trust me.<br>  <br>  This life was given to you, make the most of it...stop letting time go by and just make it happen no matter what.  Don't wait for the world to take you by the hand and guide you through.  Face the world head on and "feel the rain on your skin" cuz today is where your book begins!  <br>  <br>  <br>  good luck!|`|2mlHf7Opaa	You shouldn't need to have a girlfriend to feel like you exist.

If he would rather hang out with you than his mates then you're in!
98ZLBUSBaa	Honest answer? When i masturbate am with a girl. She normally does it for me.|`|CljWuePwaa	I think it is unique in every situation.<br>  Sometimes I believe it is a form of escapism.<br>  If not in a relationship, then yeah, either a random girl or someone he desires. <br>  But if in a relationship, then I would fantasize about my gf, assuming the attraction is still there.<br>  ...Don't know if that helped.|`|3J7xX66waa	It depends from time to time,, today, I will masterbate thinking of some hot pics i have ever seen,, wow,, it will help me for two three weeks, ,lol|`|qfpUKk7Paa	Random pornography.|`|hqKrsSMJaa	it might even be somebody he made up, with all the perfect features in his eyes... although judging on your picture i wouldn't doubt that he thinks of you... (if that IS you)|`|R86v6ndpaa	whatever is turning us on at the time :P|`|8SRjELNBaa	Sandwiches|`|8JU1hxZ1aa	The reason you can't get an honest answer is because all the answers would vary for each guy and even for the same guy it could vary each time...|`|Gl7tkWV7aa	It depends on the guy. Some guys might think about their wife/girlfriend, others might think of some random hot chick. They don't necessarily think of the same person every time, some times it might be his girlfriend, other times some random girl, other times no one at all.|`|UCQ2yr5Vaa	Yes,he only masturbates about some chick who looks hot to him.<br>  He does not think about wife or girlfriend.<br>  <br>  Why would he think about a wife or girlfriend?<br>  He can have the real thing from them and doesn't have to jack off.|`|AA11314631	generally if they are quiet, they need their space and in clutch mode. Leave them alone until they get it figured out.|`|9dc7211c44c17097c672d814b9900b0faa	a random hot chick
cbt4I1cuaa	tell them when they say you are****** tall  that they should see how  Long you are that will blow their mind and start a new conversation btw  it doesn't have to be true how many people are going to say show me and a lot of girls will wonder about it even after the party is over|`|sgoF5P6Baa	i dunno, play it off casually.<br>  like, "yeah, a tall guy who plays basketball, bet you've never seen that", or something kind of playful along those lines, and then you can segue to talking about how you play basketball. <br>  or just answer telling them how tall you are.<br>  or even admit that you get that a lot and you never really know what to say to it. admitting awkardness and being honest is always a good way to make someone comfortable around you.
dPULl5hjaa	You'll get that comment forever from people!<br>  <br>  You can say:  Oh, really?  (My bro is 6'4" & he says that!)|`|PbLuxnzdaa	Say "I didnt notice!" or "Interesting"<br>  a cute thing to say is "Hows it going down there cutie?" lol|`|cO6BD3hVaa	you should say, "Hey, Thanks for noticing, i couldn't notice you down there." and make sure you laugh at that point, this will spark a conversation and will make you appear more confident with yourself.<br>  Women, love confidence. period.  you appear confident they love you.|`|dztKGMAQaa	"You could wear heels with me."<br>  <br>  Automatically starts them thinking what the date would be like.|`|l7rn9zE9aa	Say "I'm not tall, everyone else is just really short"<br>  <br>  or<br>  <br>  Say "Yeah, you like it?"

AA10296506	It was with my current boyfriend, we've been together over a year. It happened just before we got back together, November of 2007.. We had dated a few times before that, but always broke up because of so many things, I knew I loved him, but I could tell I wasn't "in love", not yet. We were just hanging out one day, and wrestling, and having a really great time together, all my feelings were back for him. And I tackled him onto the bed and fell on top of him, and we just stared into each other's eyes for a little and then we kissed, for the first time in so long, and immediately when our lips touched, I fell in love with him, we've been together ever since, still strong and in love.|`|N4qRQ1EVaa	I was sitting there. I pushed her long gorgeous hair out of her i eyes and planted one on her. She wanted more! Got the tonging of my life!Best day of my life also !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!|`|RpxKmUBUaa	My best kiss was when my bf wiped away my tears, and reassured me that I am the most wonderful person in the world to him...and that he would be lost without me...as I would him:)|`|hwKFm7H8aa	She wasnt drunk :O hahahah joking
8aa2f76f19d65cc5bc682422bda1ee49aa	It sounds obvious he does.<br>  <br>   That is a sure sign when a guy will tease you and make fun of you that he is "smitten".<br>    <br>   Normally guys act different around their friends, but if he acts the same toward you with his friends there then it means he is comfortable with them knowing he likes you.           Other guys want to hide that they like a certain girl so it can be completely different then.<br>  <br>      The good clue is your friends see how he smiles when with you.<br>         Sounds like you have a "keeper".|`|rAAHHYEWaa	he is falling for you not tooo quickly just tring to get to see if he likes you on that level or just as a friend  give it time and hell let you know how he feels|`|aEbk51zSaa	he might have some feelings for u <br>  but seems like he really into u as a buddie <br>  <br>  try to give him a little clues<br>  like flirt a lil<br>  c were it takes u <br>  <br>  answer mine plz<br>  its bout my guy friend too<br>  <a href="http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index?qid=20090222203353AALTtLG">http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index?...</a>|`|Gyo0V4WRaa	same thing with what happened to me.<br>  just give him some time and hell let u kno ;D good luck.|`|TyQsGapmaa	maybe|`|zwdGBrUZaa	you'll never know until you ask him|`|zO59ezH3aa	Try to flirt with him a little see if he picks it up. If he doesn't then ask him out. I know it's scary but I have been there before. The worst he can do is say no. If he's a true friend but doesn't like u as in love than he will still be ur friend. And if it is meant to be than it will happen.|`|GynN3LKuaa	i would be straight forward and ask him. i know it's gonna be hard, so maybe do it over the phone. it's better than not knowing, and also you will know 100% the way he feels. i'm 25 and the direct approach is always the best. there's no guessing involved, and if it turns out he likes you, go out with him. if not, move on to the next! i hope this helps!<br>  <br>  and p.s. all guys are goofy, so that doesn't count  lol|`|Q1f5n8mNaa	Awww man he is a confusin one... I think he does like you but is not ready to be in a relationship with you because it would be kind of weird to him.. Just continue to be his friend.. you could try and get a boyfriend or at least start talkin to somebody else and see how he acts when that happens.. that should tell ya alot|`|PwkWiaitaa	Sounds like you're more of a sister figure.|`|Vnah73CEaa	my best guess is that he's totally unsure, and every time he trys to approach that problem in his mind, its just a brick wall because he's unsure of himself. I say give it time, but if your not willing to be that patient, i suggest you ask him who he likes in a nonchalant way. if he says no one, it could still be you. If he says someone it could still be you. I'm having this problem too. This guy i like that flirts with me all of a sudden stopped talking to me. And i'm really upset about this, and i can't get him alone to talk to him about it. It's like he does everything in his power not to talk to me. It's horrible. and he stares at me weridly too. I was going to ask him out last friday, but seeing how the week went, i'm just totally unsure.
UrE9xvliaa	How do u feel..?? do u want to get married?? or are u just doing it because its "the right thing to do"...i personally take marriage very seriously..i've been married for 8 years..and i married for love..not for any other reason..i also had a child before i was married..i did end up marrying the father..but i didn't marry him because we had a child..u need to really think about what u want..don't jump into anything for the wrong reasons..because u could end up regretting it for the rest of your life..also,being that u are unsure of what u want to do..u should wait until u know..don't worry about what people think or say...its ur life..and u need to do whats right for you..good luck.. :)|`|tHFY2hg4aa	Allot of people in this world would say "Get Married." I don't think it is necessary for you to get married right away, but I think by the time the kid gets old enough to understand you need to be married, rather than just living together.|`|Ff7mCzlPaa	It's an individual choice.<br>  <br>  We have more benefits when we are married - tax benefits, insurance benefits and financial benefits... <br>  <br>  If you are scared about making a commitment, then you're not ready for marriage.  You are not required to get married until YOU are ready.|`|sCCjAKllaa	I think it's okay. I hate when people get married and divorced in the same yr, since it seems pointless. I guess it's okay if you really love the person.|`|pcjLTnwTaa	Im a bit iffy about marriage at the moment. I think that forever with the same person seems a bit scary. And I think if I loved someone I don't need a piece of paper to prove it. But then again if I found the right person I am sure I would love the idea of spending the rest of my life with them. The only thing i am afraid of is falling out of love with them some day down the track.<br>  <br>  Congrats on being pregnant by the way. I have a friend who has just had a baby out of wedlock, and she says she wishes she had the stability of being married, but she is single as well so maybe even having a partner would be more comfortable for her. However, I don't think you should get married just because you are having a baby. That should be a decision made only on you and your partners relationship.|`|gxqN8Eaqaa	Well if you both *know* you'll be together forever, than it cant hurt right? I mean, if you were destined to be together at some point, you're just rushing it a bit b/c of good sex right. <br>  <br>  However, if you're still not sure about him or your future together wait it out. Because you do NOT want to add another notch to that belt when it comes to marriage and divorce. Its all you. just go with your instincts and talk to him about it. Also, screw what the 'family' thinks. Do whats good for the two of you.|`|4iUhdKKiaa	does not matter what we rhink, what do u think? I think when its right ull know.|`|wE89mPZ3aa	Marriage is good if you really know the person and they are not just trying to be what they think you want.  Having someone to love and be there for the good times and the bad is great,but you have to make sure you are doing for the right reasons. You have to know they are the one and you can see yourself growing old with them.|`|NqbBjS0raa	Seeking an answer whether to get married or not is depended on a mutual decision between you two if it's feasible. I think the vote is split on whether to get married or just stay in a relationship for the long haul or forever. I think from what I have seen of this family he is lucky man. I hope he doesn't mess this up now.....
71VRvldJaa	You don't get him to go!  He's your ex!  Leave it that way!|`|Nqda6ulSaa	well i think its best that you do it rather than your friend|`|UoMOLXdfaa	sweety, i know its hard but just call him up and say hey i know you don't have to and its up to you but do you want to go to this concert with me?<br>  you dont have to we would go as friends i promise. i wouldn't ask you if i wasn't serious so i promise just as friends. no pressure though but i wanna hang out. say something like that for better or for worse you need to find out and this is the only way|`|YWjhqlxbaa	Get over being scared, you only live life once so just ask him

Its very responsible of them.|`|t14Jk1IPaa	Wow what a good, yet bad position to be in! My good side says turn it in, but my bad side says it is alot of work to earn 20 Grand!

lg6jexk7aa	Well if they are going to end their friendship with you over something so insignificant and without your side of the story - then they aren't true friends to begin with.<br>  <br>  They are acting very immature.  While it was wrong of you to slander "Liza" by calling her a Lesbo, you did apologise and tried to explain to her that she was never meant to see that and you were venting.  <br>  Sounds like your friend "Annie" is a trouble maker for sending on the message in the first place, then when she could handle "Liza" attacking her, just did the simple thing and ended the friendship - blaming everything on you.<br>  <br>  I think if you are given the chance to explain to your other friends the situation, and they have a few brain cells among them - they will see your side of the story and support you.<br>  <br>  Don't worry about trying to make things right with these other two girls - they don't seem worth the trouble|`|DVRSCYU1aa	let people play their drama ,u dont have to xplain ur self to dogs anything ,if they r human they will and shud stop al nonsense .|`|8bHuUJczaa	just tell them how u feel, simple as that.|`|Tnw9Ypl9aa	ignore them and make new friends and if this annie girl is your true friend then she wouldn't spread gossip about you.

OQF1HlwRaa	well idk<br>  <br>  take it slow;;i wouldn't get too excited about you guys talking.<br>  he's your ex...before that he was obviously your friend so you guys are obviously going to have alot to talk about being that you have chemistry.<br>  <br>  i broke up with my ex in september..i told him i never wanted to talk to him again.<br>  <br>  we talk occasionally now.<br>  i saw him at @ party, we danced. talked after the party through texting;;he texted me.'<br>  he's called like twice.<br>  ive called randomly at times and on friday i called to see if he was going to this party...he called me back to tell me his final decision [[he didn have to but he did which obviously means he wanted to talk]] and then afterwards he told me to call him to tell him how the party was...we talked on the phone for like 3 hrs. 11:30-2:30ish<br>  <br>  but throughout all of that i have not gained feelings for him and i do not feel like he likes me or we're going to get back together..we actually talked about important stuff too and he complimented me throughout the conversation.<br>  <br>  i believe you should take it slow.<br>  i refuse to call my ex often or invite him places.<br>  i invited him to somewhere once. this month we went to a friends house and chilled but i do it every once in a while because that is my EX.<br>  <br>  just talk to him<br>  i guarentee you will enjoy just that.<br>  i enjoy it...<br>  and i know if we ever get together again we're going to be as happy as ever..<br>  because we'll know each other better.<br>  <br>  have fun talking to him. just chill out.|`|IvMPh09baa	get a life!|`|S3UxNOhdaa	You showed your interest in renewing. He is just being friendly. If he was renewed by the spark, he would be calling you ..not saying"call again sometime". Don't hold onto the past or try to recreate it. It ends in heartache everytime. Don't believe when people say they've heard it worked out for someone they know. It feels good because it's familiar to you. Please don't toy with the past. It's called the past for a reason.|`|2P2K0rl2aa	He's just being polite.  If he really wanted you back he would have let you know approximately 3 years ago.<br>  <br>  If you want him back, let him chase you.

I mean ive seen it happen with my friends. My best friend had broken up with his girl maybe a 1 year ago and they just got back together and their better thane ever.

Hope this helps, good luck. :)|`|2M2oLNFfaa	LOL you were the one he called...you have feelings for him not him...ask him if he still likes you(in some way or another) or else you gotta move on..whats the point of getting back together after 3 yrs break up|`|WT5tYLdfaa	I think YOU still have feelings for him NOT vice versa....

As far as rape goes, demand a paternity test. As far as family disowning you, have they heard both sides of the story? You did not include age, but I'm guessing you guys are of legal age to drink. You need to contact other family members, uncle, aunt older cousin, grandparents or someone. I would also recommend calling a suicide crisis hot line in your area. They can give you advice and maybe a safe place to stay. Good luck. God Bless.|`|Eg3VqGsuaa	i'd go down to the local police station, tell them what happened and see if they can help you or give you some advice. get a court ordered paternity (that way she HAS to get it done), if it's ur's (and i was you) i'd make her get an abortion because children bred from incest end up having A LOT of medical (sometimes psychological too) problems and some don't live too long. is there such thing as court ordered abortion? oh yeah, i'm sorry that happened to you :( but that's gross|`|AA11108018	Killing you self is the last thing you want to do.

Uwn8jvx3aa	aw that really sucks. But the way I see it is that if you want to get over her, try to see things that annoy you about her. (and im sure theres at least one) so that way you dont like her as much. or try not to spend so much time with her. that only makes it worse. If you see her less, youll think about her less. And by the way i think she  being kinda messed up to u. I mean if she tells you she wishes she was with you? thats kinda leading you on. I think that shes just trying to keep u close just in case she breaks up with her bf. but wtv anyway the best way to get over her is to spend time away from her. Do something that will keep u busy so u wont have time to think about her. And I dont think shell be hurt by that. I mean DONT ignore her. just spend less time with her because youre just hurting yourself that way.
0PbYE3M7aa	sounds like it. <br>  <br>  If you like her and she likes you don't hesitate to ask her out. Girls are fickle and can lose interest quickly so... reel her in before she loses interest in you and starts being interested in one of your friends.|`|mR0N9UW8aa	That is effed up of your friend. Maybe you need to tell him to lay off you like her. But she might loose interest in you soooo hurry up and ask her out, Be creative when you ask her out, she will more likely say yes.lol.

JxY5WXF2aa	Don't pay him any attention. Get out of his face and let him come to you. There is nothing more unattractive then a pesty girl. Guys are not into unless they come to you. So if you are always in his face he will entertain you but that doesn't necessarily mean that he likes you. However if he comes to you on his own then he's into you. Just be careful because he may want something other than friendship if you know what I mean.|`|ca1562f9999b16755e6d5f797fb3b9ebaa	Ok. so it's pretty clear that he likes you which means that you just have to trigger him to make the 1st move. Give him like... a sexy glare that makes him want to ask you out. lol. And dress really nicely. Play with your hair. Casually, touch, or brush his arm. And be like.. "omg, your hands are so big! Can i see?" and then like measure your hand against his. and stuff like that.|`|qUnPpZNJaa	since you've tried flirting but didntt work you have to play thekind ofaGirll that is hard to get. when he asks you to walk with him walk for a bit and then tell him u remembered you have something to do. in the bus when he sits beside youdon'tt just stay there looking at him andtalkingn just listen to what he is saying.don'tt hang up with him all the time because he says so. try to look at him in a way to make him understand that you like him because the eye language is a very clear language.<br>  <br>  i hope you allthe-bestt:)|`|QD2AJv22aa	you should say something implying that you have absolutley nothing to do one night and u want to go out but have no one to go out with...
tGGVeW3yaa	look she is obviously changing big time and if she's into that now at such a young age what do you think she'll be into in a few years. And tell the boy that your not into to him, because he's obviously just trying to get a name for himself as a bit of a ladies man.

Wcscjegnaa	Guys don't get those types of hints most often. So, I wouldn't recommend playing hard to get. It'll just make you seem annoying. lol<br>  Just talk and flirt and be straight up about it if he flirts back. You'll know because he'll smile when he's around you. That's a dead giveaway. lol<br>  Hope it all works out! =]|`|DS1cPBg5aa	I hate when I see other girls do that to a guy. It seems like she's playing with him! I feel bad, especially if he doesn't get it. With what I have seen, the guy can get hurt, and that complicates everything.<br>  Either that or he thinks that it will be a meaningless fling, and goes after multiple girls, eventually hurting them both.|`|N1rwfsDXaa	i don't play hard to get intentionally, but i am kind of shy sometimes so i'm not the type that'll go up to a guy and say "HEY I LIKE YOU." so people mistakenly think i'm playing hard to get, when really i'm just too scared to be dead honest :P<br>  i don't think its necessarily a bad thing though, i do have a boyfriend and i'm pretty straightforward with him.|`|rJmi68tVaa	I rather have the girl just tell me they like me not play hard to get because what if the guy is shy and you play hard to get then the guy is just going to give up since maybe he does not have the courage to come up to you and ask you out. And also if you play hard to get then people will think you are stuck up and lose interest.|`|RfZK3FBzaa	being a girl, i think you should just let them know you like them. i mean i guess it does depend on the situation, but i think it just makes things worse when everyone is trying to make eachother jealous.. shows how much you actually care about the person.....|`|B97UyW0Faa	i don't play, i don't act uninterested in those i'm interested in, and i don't have time for women who don't want to act the way they feel they should. games are a waste of time|`|g3I4zblPaa	From what I know.

Otherwise:<br>  <br>  1. The guy will never get the message that the girl likes him.<br>  2. The guy will think she is not interested in him.<br>  3. The guy will think she's moving on.<br>  4. The guy will think that he should move on with a girl who is more interseted in him.<br>  <br>  The only time I recommend playing hard to get is when a tiny relationship already starts and the guy doesn't seem to respond to the girl. In that situation, the girl should play hard to get so they dont act clingy which will make the guy can panic and do something. If he doesn't do anything then that alerts the girl that the guy lost interest.|`|qUDas0R4aa	not really, the reason is because a lot of girls that play hard to get expect the guy to be there little lap dog and they like to use guys, well at least thats the impression I get. Being straight to the point is always good I guess but no woman in my lifetime has ever come up to me and said "Hey I friggin love ya, we have got to do something toghether because your the sh*t" or something like that idk. its never that upfront with women and that gos for most guys. I mean women never make it that obvious. Guys are always expected to read the signs and innitiate the first move. Thats the way it usually is. I mean sometimes firls make the first moves but its always different than if a guy does it. With a guy making the first move you girls got him, thats it you dont even have to work for it. Butt when a girl makes the first move towards the guy, it can still go to crap and she'll walk away if your not up to par. unless shes a complete slut. Its the games that annoy me more than anything. Knowing exactly what to say and when to say it. Sometimes the guy practically has to be a mind reader with some women and thats dumb.|`|griwMyO6aa	To be honest.. Guys don't really get it when you're playing hard to get. They think you're just a tease and sometimes go after you but it's usually more for sex in this case. So if you're looking for an honest relationship you should just be straight up and tell a guy EXACTLY what you want.|`|k0zAhV4eaa	you'd want to be straight forward but not tooo forward, get it? you don't want to act to fast because that's the easiest way to become "a hoe". ppl will start to think ur easy, but then again you don't want the guy to lose interest. so be direct, but not in a hey there's no struggle to get in my panties type of way|`|WFRooU7Maa	I think am a pretty straight forward guy, so I prefer a girl who doesn't play hard to get or atleast doesn't play really hard to get
3r4gNukeaa	bcuz i get lonely... <br>  even though i do it, id have to say im against it.<br>  too much drama lol|`|q2H9jgDSaa	i'm 14<br>  idk.<br>  it's for fun i guess.<br>  it makes us feel wanted<br>  and liked<br>  and we are horny.|`|PbFL8jh2aa	--> hormomes<br>  --> curious (trying things out)<br>  --> we've been exposed to dating and stuff since a very young age<br>  --> people are "growing up" faster<br>  --> lonely|`|GmP7rkPmaa	Well, for one reason it can give you some background. Because for the most part young relationships don't last for that long, maybe a week or two or maybe a month or two. And then when you break-up it can give you a little experience on what to expect when you are actually are serious with someone. Idk really, to some it may seem stupid or like you are trying to grow up to fast, but if you go back and think about it, at that age weren't you curious about all that stuff. And maybe sometimes you actually do find one that works. Like me for instance, I am 14 and I have been dating this boy for over a year and its going really great. We are taking it slow and maybe that will help us in the future, who knows? But everyone wants to have that one boy that they can say they are "going out" with. Most of the time its basically a game, and then sometimes that game turns into something real. Sorry if this confused you. Lol.|`|05b8e574350cb9042ae48f65192c5811aa	um...<br>  for most of us.<br>  we really do feel for the person you know?<br>  it starts with a little crush and grows into something more.|`|BkdEq3NNaa	sex, fun, nothing better to do
7mDHRgZyaa	Personally, i am more attracted to brunettes as a general rule, as i see them as being more reserved and a little more mystique, that being said, it depends on the individual girl of course and how she carries herself. Witty girls go a long way.<br>  Different guys like different features, as i'm sure is the case for you girls.|`|9jQwxvYgaa	For me, all other things being equal about a girl, I will take a brunette any day over a blonde, because I'm more attracted to brunettes.<br>  <br>  But that is just it, I'm attracted to brunettes, most of my friends prefer blondes, which is to say it's solely a subjective matter of preference that will vary from person to person.|`|cBtFp2aYaa	both im more of a personality kind of guy|`|o6orgXm2aa	B.L.O.N.D.E.S.|`|C9bIpY1waa	doesn't matter ... i dont even care if its been dyed .... just as long as it looks normal lol|`|snZ5xJedaa	brown hair with some blonde in it.<br>  <br>  but i am not really attracted to blondes at all, but some are still cute.|`|0NUs25jLaa	it doesn't matter to me it's the eyes that first attract me to a  woman|`|yl2pJauAaa	depends on the guy...

dyAMG21Laa	Jason, the answer to this is that it depends......on what you and your spouse are willing to put into the relationship.  It also depends on how old you are, and how long you've been married.<br>  <br>  I think the best thing about marriage is the bond you have with your spouse, if it's Strong, it can withstand a lot of things.  The worst thing about marriage is learning what is acceptable to you and what isn't.  The reason I say it's the worse is because it's really hard to do.  For example, your spouse may exaggerate things.  To you this is lying.  To your spouse, it's just making a story more interesting.  Is this acceptable to you?  Can you live with it?|`|W1rCsvTzaa	In a good marriage: After 20 years<br>  <br>  1. The best:  You bring out the best in each other and you slowly remove the worst from each other.  You raise children who hopefully are superior to you<br>  <br>  2. The worst: Fighting with someone you deeply love, who knows you well enough to badly hurt you.  <br>  <br>  Most important:  Children|`|W9B6EJrWaa	Have you ever been to jail?|`|VRSUyeqbaa	i think marriage is overrated, i myself have been married once before. <br>  <br>  it is hard to be married.<br>  the best thing would be that someone would be there for you all the time, which can also be the worst thing to (depending on how you look at it.) it gets annoying having someone under foot all the time.<br>  <br>  the most important thing, is to make sure that the one you marry is the one you want be with the rest of your life.|`|OQF1HlwRaa	well can i at least tell you what i'd think it'd be like.<br>  <br>  best - spending a lifetime with someone who shares similar interests, who loves you for you and who you are, and who you can talk to about anything<br>  <br>  worst thing - if you ever divorce, it'll be a bit** because you've spent your life time with them<br>  <br>  most important - you will learn alot from this person if its a healthy marriage.... in essence they become apart of you...<br>  <br>  have fun, if you're getting married soon! :]|`|C59bTKO2aa	If you marry the right person, it's the greatest.  You never have to face a bad situation alone, there is always someone with you that cares just as much as you do.  There's a lot of security in knowing that no matter what, that your spouse loves you completely.  <br>  <br>  The worst thing, is the back seat driving.<br>  <br>  The most important thing-is the honesty and trust.|`|b7bb85526b028b7f92b16c8204ed4012aa	The easiest way to sum it all up is if you married to your true love, its like being in Heaven but if youre not then its a living hell with no in between|`|rEo5gfO3aa	Marriage is not about ultimate satisfaction or fullfillment. It's about learning to love another person despite all their flaws, and them loving you despite all yours. It's all too easy to walk out when it's not all fun and games. That's not to say being married is bad. It's much like parenting. You have to learn not to be selfish and think about each others needs. If you do that, you will have a good marriage. <br>  Having said all that, the most important thing about marriage for me is having someone who meant his vows. We both know we have a partner for life, even when we're on each others last nerve or things aren't going well. The worst thing is that the honeymood phase does end and you learn about each others flaws. The best thing is the quiet nights at home, long talks, and looking at the life you've created together, and knowing God is there holding you together.|`|MPNvGc5Xaa	I've been married for 12 years and am very happy.

She's probably a little worried too if you haven't talked in 2 days. Just call her.

Your ex should not be telling you this. You should have gotten more of a notice than 1 day too. Now either way you can go into court and ask for a postponement due to being notified on too short a notice and you arent prepared for this. The Judge should grant your request which will buy you some time and also youll know what action is being taken against you. I can try and speculate on what hes trying to do but would rather not since I dont know for sure and theres several different routes I could tell you to take.

In any event you need to be served with a notice, a phone call won't do it. Tell the judge you haven't been served and he'll either dismiss it or continue the case.

Wo5Ezmwiaa	I think it's really hard to kiss wrong. When I was set up on a blind date with a guy, I was really nervous cause I didn't know what to expect. But then we really hit it off. Later on the date, I could tell he wanted to kiss me. But I was too nervous so I kept prolonging it. I really wanted it too though, so I finally just gave in and did it. It was fine. I know the 1st kiss can be a really big thing and you want it to be perfect, but if you just look at each other, and the moment is right, then go in slow. Don't just dive in and be messy. Go in slow, look in each other's eyes, and you can't mess it up. The only way you can, is if you go in too fast cause you're nervous. So just take a deep breath, and go.|`|blcBYvbNaa	omg that is so cute just go ahead and do it it doesnt matter how you do it just try to kiss him right and good a kiss both of yous will enjoy and orgasm about later on at night when you think about it again hahaha but for real just go for it

Vnah73CEaa	dude i had the same exact problem. then he started to tell me that he wanted to kiss me, and that was the reason i broke up with him. It would have been fine to kiss him, except for the fact that it would have been my first kiss. And we didn't have THAT much spark. And i told him i loved him. But now that i think about it, i don't. I was just really attracted to him, and i know now that love is a commitment. I think that you should tell him how you actually feel, but only if you know he can take it. And i think that he shouldn't have put that much pressure on you! That's accidentialy applying peer pressure. and i've been on that end before. if you don't think you can handle it, gradually stop saying I love you. and if he asks, tell him that you don't really, and want to still have that speacial something between you two.

0MYTPRfdaa	I would strong suggest working with dating coach, if you feel new or uncertain in your meeting and dating abilities. I worked with dating coach for a few month last year and it helped me a lot. My dating life has improved big time since then as well. I worked with New York Dating Coach, and they done an excellent job of easing me into dating, i was in a relationship for 4 years. Me and Ex broke up 5 month ago, and i felt like fish out of the water, it was strange to start dating again. Since i never been good at meeting women to begin with, i was uncertain what to do. So i went to dating coach, i really didn't have much to lose. I meeting a lot more now, probably 3 time more then i did before the coach, and i find myself meeting and dating women that are my type, which was certainly not the case before.

0cj5FRCZaa	Well I am not going to ask totally personal questions, but in order to answer this it depends on how long you have been dating, how far you have gone with her sexually and how old you both are... I am totally devoted to my boyfriend and yes we have had sex, but because we love each other and trust each others decisions, we have both decided that it is better off for us to wait on the sex. We have been dating for almost a year now so different things to do seem to dissapate, so ik what you are feeling...<br>  <br>  Now there are many things to do, and honestly most girls are very easy to please but you have to do the right things. Im not saying this is what she likes but i like it when we are in public and he just wraps his arms around me just to do it. or walks with his hand around my waist. things like that will rekindle flames. but dont be inappropriate unless she likes it.. i hate it when he puts his hands where they dont belong in front of other people, i think its rude...<br>  <br>  Take her out to dinner.. it doesnt have to be fancy, but surprise her. (once again, depending on your age and her age) Ask her parents for permission if you can surprise her with dinner plans, tell them where you are going and such but make sure they dont tell her! <br>  <br>  Then maybe after go to a movie and dont go to make out, go to enjoy the movie. Even if you rent movies at home and just sit where you are comfortable, invite her over for a night to just hangout, movies, popcorn and cuddling.<br>  <br>  Buy her presents randomly. that definitely spurrs up things. even if its little.. a teddy bear to say i love you. or a piece of jewelry just for her to have and be reminded of you every time she looks at it. or her favorite chocolates if she likes candies.. anything just random to do it.<br>  <br>  I dont know, there are many things you can do to spice up dates. even if you havent done anything sexually, you can make things romantic without being sexual. light candles, dress nice, act like a gentleman (open doors for her) Be spontaneous and i can almost guarantee that things will look up<br>  <br>  I wish you the best of luck and hope i have helped in some ways.. at the least to give you ideas :)|`|70744bc4be63015a2ec2bfa99decb962aa	Go for a walk under the stares, a picnic, or take a blanket and go sit by a fire.|`|hxfOD9o1aa	Remember that feeling you first had for her.

LmH5jZxkaa	first off, it is absolutely not fair for them to make you feel bad about yourself in ANY way!! especially about your weight when you are trying to get in shape. If you are healthy, then there is nothing wrong with being a little thicker or thinner than the average person. As far as being a virgin goes, that is really something to be respected! most people wish they had waited, and it definitely means more when you do. I too had extremely controlling parents, and an older brother and sister who seemed to get away with everything. One thing that really truly helps is writing things down. In high school I was only allowed to leave the house for sports, and that was a big help. being at practice was in a way my alone time, so joining a club or sport can be really beneficial. the important thing is to spend some time for yourself, it keeps you sane. whatever you do, do not continue to bottle up repressed anger and emotion. that is what i did and i nearly ended up as a self destructive person. find whatever positive outlets you can and everytime you hear a negative comment, think of something positive. it's hard to ignore, but try not to dwell on it. that's when it starts to eat you up.|`|AA11032586	A school resource adviser is a place I would start. You need counseling for all the things, so you can get them aired out. That is supposed to be private confidential sessions, but I have known of some small towns that everybody knows everybody, will contact the parents and talk about what you have talked about. There is always a Pastor or some Elders in the church that can help with counseling. There are also Battered Women's Shelters everywhere that can give you some help or point you in the right direction. I hope this helps. God Bless and good luck.|`|Y8fDB2V7aa	I would talk to your school counselor and pray about it.  Something good will come out of it just be patient.  <br>  <br>  it seems to me that your family is babying you so that every area of life must be controlled by someone else so that you won't grow up like you should<br>  <br>  i'm not sure if that helps any.  <br>  <br>  Best Wishes for your life!

You rationalize, justify, deny and falsify.  This is how you protect yourself.  One trick is to realize that the person in your mind is not really that person.  We build people up, apply impossible traits and standards.  You'll always compare others to this ideal in your mind, and they'll never live up to it, and so you'll be disappointed.<br>  <br>  Your best bet is to follow the advice offered by the others here.

The loss you have suffered is as real as if someone died.  You loved that person and now your loved one is gone.  <br>  <br>  So the most important thing to do is understand your feelings are normal and that grieving is going to take a little time!  Much can be learned from your terrible loss.  Remember that forgiving is very important.  If you don't forgive, then bitterness takes root!  So forgive your lost loved one and yourself!<br>  <br>  I urge you to talk things over with a trusted friend or relative or a counselor.  A good thing to do is write the whole thing down and in this way understand how your feelings are guiding you.<br>    <br>  Make up your mind to let it all go and set out on a new path for your life.   Because, my dear life does go on!  You can hunker down in a corner and feel sorry for yourself or you can determine to make the most of what you have learned from this episode and make a new life for yourself. <br>  <br>  Get together with your friends and keep finding reasons to smile and even laugh out loud!  The sun continues to come up each morning and your life holds many great and beautiful episodes.

cd87c1cf515692ef0adc60a28df772b0aa	Honestly, I'm unsure if you mean that they loved you, but then stopped loving you, or if you mean that they never loved you all along, but pretended to.<br>  <br>  Obviously, either one is painful. The first (they quit loving you) can make you feel like you can never have faith in anything to last. If you believe the person honestly, and deeply loved you, then you think, if that doesn't last, what can I trust in to last? You realize "true love" is not necessarily "forever"- if someone really loves you, you see now, apparently, they can stop. This can make you worry in future relationships that the person you are with will quit loving you, as well. And you may spend some time after the break up wondering if love just dies for no reason related to you, or if somehow you did something wrong and if you did something to make them stop loving you, what was it?! You may beat yourself up, figuratively speaking, over something you might have done wrong or failed to do right enough. Even if you decide it just happened and wasn't you, this makes you feel you have little control of whether love dies or not, which isn't reasuring, either. They both feel bad. It can make you almost expect things to end or be paranoid that they will when you are in future relationships. You may spend time wondering if there is someway to make them fall in love with you again, since they loved you once. This may keep you holding on, and slow the healing process.<br>  <br>  If someone turns out to have lied to you all along, you also lose trust and faith in things. You lose trust in those who tell you they love you. Afterall, if someone fooled you once, if someone told you they loved you and it seemed that real and you believed it that deeply, you may wonder how you can ever trust someone's words, or even their actions again. You may find yourself questioning the love of others in your life at that moment, or people who come into your life later on. You may often doubt other's love because you have found that people can fake love pretty well. You may not trust the other person to tell you the truth about their feelings, and you may not trust your own ability to tell if they mean what they say or not. You may feel extremely stupid for ever being gullible enough to believe them. You may wonder how, how could they have tricked you like this? You may lose your ability to believe others love you with all of your heart and need a lot of reassurance in relationships, which may do little to ease the paranoia and doubt. When someone lies to you all along, it also, obviously causes anger.<br>  <br>  Both of these may cause you to believe you can never trust that someone else loves you or/and will continue to do so, and you may even question love altogether. Both of these things can make you insecure in love. This insecurity and the resulting doubts in the other person's love (thinking they are lieing to you and don't love you), as well as fear of abandonment and loss of love can make you overly jealous, paranoidly defensive (snapping over things that weren't intended to offend you), clingy, seeking too much reassurance, on edge and irritable. These things can actually push your mate away as they may cause arguments in the relationship, leave the mate feeling their is no way to please or reassure you, feeling untrusted, etc. And it can cause a loss of intimacy. Alternatively, these things can cause you to push people away (or you may alternate between pulling them close and pushing them away as in apparoach avoidance), you may put up walls to keep from getting too close to them, etc. and in the end, this may also assure that they either leave you afterall, or that they never get close to you to start with. This whole situation of losing love  or finding out it was a lie, may also cause grief, dissapointment, panic, a sense of hopelessness, loneliness, surprise, dissillusionment, etc. and anger.<br>  <br>  Of course, while these things often hurt, things don't always go quite this badly. Sometimes people recover from these things quite well and learn to trust others and themselves in the future, don't put up huge walls, etc. I think it is an individual thing.<br>  <br>  By the way, about the player/hoe comment above- women can be players, as well as men, and men can be hoes, as well as women.|`|tBuzrlSdaa	Dump them and find someone else better|`|6HX4u0SRaa	get over it|`|AA12393776	I would hurt, perhaps mope, perhaps never get over it. <br>  <br>  But since it is the end. it is the end and it doesn't really matter what was.

Every Mistakes that he made, Every Hurtful thing that he did to me..<br>  <br>  It is really better to not be friends with your Ex when you've just broke up with him and when you know that you still Love him... <br>  <br>  But..  i want to know... why do he still wants to  Stay up and contact you? is it bcoz he still love you? or He just want you to be friends since you've had some good times together... <br>  <br>  If he contacted you bcoz he wants to be friends with you.. then what you did was right... Since you still Love him.. it will be more hurtful and harder for you to forget your feelings for him..<br>  <br>  But if He contacted you bcoz he still Love you.. Then try to Find a way to see him.. ( just don't make it too obvious for him)<br>  <br>  If you don't want to miss him... why don't you try to work :-P, Or watch some funny things. Walk Around. <br>  <br>  ( and always tell yourself that he's a man.. once he started to miss you and still love you.. then He will surely contact you) LEt him be the first to approach you.. Since it's you who choose not to have any communication with him... So you should go on with a pride<br>  <br>  -----<br>  If there's a will there's a way (hehe)
XKTZbxBPaa	No. Where'd you get that crazy idea from?!?! That's just a normal boy-girl relationship starting its photosynthesis, like if it was a bloom blooming into a luscious flower.|`|JtUuMdRKaa	you're kidding, right? <br>  LOL, nice i wouldn 't even think of a question as subtle as that|`|3ctchU2faa	You are most definitely not a ****. We need more girls who just hug and pet!|`|GhsqaXsdaa	No way!<br>  Your the opposite girly!|`|eKuvx6f8aa	roflmao!|`|8nLuyDmPaa	You sound very young.. and not "****" like at all.<br>  <br>  That is such a terrible word..<br>  <br>  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/****" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/****</a>|`|rAAHHYEWaa	no yerr not a sult|`|AA11627920	wow you hugged???? lmao|`|RpxKmUBUaa	Um, no...you're actually just being normal and enjoying his company, so have fun!|`|JMIKVR5waa	wtf <br>  how stupid are you.<br>  you are the biggest **** that has ever lived.<br>  <br>  honestly if you don't know the answer to that you are to young to be on here.|`|ww3ukbdVaa	...yes, yes you are. you must be the biggest **** ive ever seen. <--- im being sarcastic.

If you were doing him then yeah|`|VOxZ2dt2aa	OH MY GOD YOU ARE you hugged.... you have to wait until marriage for that|`|AA12393776	Not in my eye<br>  <br>  Do you want to be? <grin><br>  <br>  This is not completely a joke.  From your question probably not. But it might be fun to think about.<br>  <br>  Actually those guys are using the term "****" completely backwards wrong.  "****" means wantonly kissing and/or having sex both of them or more with complete lust and abandonment.  <br>  <br>  They could have called you a ".... tease"  to be mean and cruel from the situation described.   That would be an insult used when you won't kiss or do more  Yet  that would be just mean cruel.  Not accurate.  <br>  (kinda like the spider man movie .. know your insults)<br>  <br>  And besides.. Only hug or kiss or do more with someone you respect and that they respect and like (more importantly love) you.<br>  <br>  good luck.|`|v3vBcyGLaa	Even if you have had sex with him, I wouldn't think you're a ****.  I consider a person easy or slutty if they are having sex for the wrong reasons (i.e. to feel better about themselves, to use someone, etc).  Don't be so hard on yourself.  Life is about our interactions with other people.  Enjoy and have fun|`|iAtanlT8aa	no, you don't reach sluthood until you start to sleep around with 3 different men within six months, although my standards for a **** is 3 different men per year, but people call me stupid.|`|2QbnUwnBaa	No, you are not a ****.|`|xkMkPwZkaa	no you are not a **** it was a hug and a kiss. a **** is a girl that lets anything with a dick and a pulse in. so no you are a ****|`|lKw1wsBxaa	No<br>  DB|`|GCpnuPNCaa	no i know people who do that when they r not even going out dont worry|`|tQXQS01waa	hell no<br>  <br>  <br>  <a href="http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index?qid=20090222211421AAnBdZ3">http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index?...</a>|`|griwMyO6aa	Haha no not at all.

z9k2TUcbaa	I concur that you should keep your options open, but if this girl is truly special to you, then you should make that commitment and stay with her. Build a closer relationship with her even if it's just friends for now. <br>  <br>  You say that she says she isn't ready for a boyfriend yet, so give her confidence that you'll be a positive contributor...not a negative choke-hold...basically be there when she needs you, and don't bug the crap out of her when she's busy.<br>  <br>  For right now, I suggest you talk to her MORE, but not too much that it gets to her schoolwork. Try having a more intimate relationship with her :]<br>  <br>  Good luck ^_^|`|Wo5Ezmwiaa	Well the thing is, you ARE ready for a relationship, and she is not. So I would keep her in your heart and in your thoughts, but keep your options open. Don't pass on someone promising, just cause you're waiting on this girl to come around. But stay picky. Don't just date anyone. If you come across a girl that catches your attention, then go for it. Maybe you'll find she's all you need or want. I would not put everything on hold just for this one girl. She may be really really great and really special, but who knows how long she wants to wait before she makes time for a boyfriend. So my advice, don't put all your eggs in one basket yet. But also, don't go out with just anyone. Sorta let this girl set the standard, that way you don't waste time dating girls that aren't worth it. So keep your options open. There are so many great girls out there, I'd hate for you to pass on a winner.
xVbUwhZoaa	Ask her out then learn English.<br>  <br>  If you're old enough to date a girl who drives, you're older enough to not appear as a moron to the entire world.|`|6HX4u0SRaa	ask her out to a movie or for a soda|`|xvxtQwV5aa	Those are signs that a girl likes you BUT they are also signs that a girl is drunk or under the influence. Next time you see her in school, say hi. If she says hey and keeps walking, then she's probably not really into you. If she stops and talks to you then you might have a chance. Talk to her and charm her. Tell her you'd like to get to know her a little better and ask if there's a time when the two of you can chill, with or without friends, let her decide, no pressure. If she says yes then maybe she really is kind of into you. From there, it's up to you to get this girl to go out with you.|`|hPFRNbW7aa	Are you serious....Have you attended a day of school? You need to ask your questions in English, show that you have an education.|`|griwMyO6aa	She obviously likes you! I don't know why you didn't kiss her goodbye! But you should defently ask her out the next good chance you get.|`|YWjhqlxbaa	You should LIEK ask her out. <br>  <br>  ;]|`|qUnPpZNJaa	i really dont hink this girl likes you, i think she is the kind that went to a party alone and felt like she needed to have fun with someone that s why she hung up on u because as u said she goes to scho0l with you and you were shy to talk to her if she likes you she would at least talk to you in scho0l and feels that ou like her not all of a sudden comes and kiss you in a party <br>  <br>  be carful man!|`|M9iOiYZtaa	bro,what r u waiting for?take her on a date and show her a good time!<br>  shes given you enough signals already..<br>  <br>  check out my dating series.|`|DhkGnzJCaa	she obviously likes you.. so keep doing cute things.. ask her to hang out some time just you and her and take it from there.|`|JzTg0hg5aa	wtf you need to go back to 1st grade and get you spelling and shiit right!<br>  <br>  <br>  from what i could understand from that she likes you.|`|LVRBtXGuaa	those are all the signs of a girl liking you.. ask her out.. dont wait someone might take her before you|`|1eVyegzDaa	i would make sure shes into you and maybe not drunk that night<br>  but heey... you never know till you ask|`|0NUs25jLaa	ask this person out|`|mDBHMJPjaa	get some! she likes you :))
71VRvldJaa	If your boyfriend has already earned your trust and never given you reason not to trust him, then you should invite his friends.  I've had my best male friend for over 30 years and we've never once even considered crossing boundaries we set around our friendship.  His wife invites me to all their parties!|`|f3SyOyMEaa	If you have anything to worry about just because he sees his friends that are female, then things wouldn't work out in the long run no matter what. He is with you and that's what you need to remember. I think that it would be a nice surprise and show that you have confidence in yourself and your relationship. We all have our jealous moments, but they can't control your life. Whatever is going to happen in life just happens. You won't turn into a constantly jealous person because you have already told yourself that you don't want to be that way. I hope you throw a great surprise party!|`|W9B6EJrWaa	Things are different since your mom was your age, and yes maybe back then a girl couldn't be friends with a guy without it going further, but you know that nowadays it's not like that. <br>  <br>  You say you don't want to be like your mom?  What would your mom do in this situation?  <br>  <br>  Now do the opposite of what SHE would do.  <br>  <br>  And there's your answer.  <br>  <br>  And who knows, you might get to know these girls and like them!  <br>  <br>  Besides, guys love it when their girl can integrate into his life.  <br>  <br>  You need to integrate his friends into your life.  <br>  <br>  Now is the time.
a8e2130188e45facab4c16a4a764104caa	It is sad that you have been so recently bereaved.. Probably you have issues to deal with from that sad event.<br>  <br>  BUT, I would think even your brother shouldn't have had beer in the house. Though I guess it is legal in most areas. However, it is NOT legal for a 13 year old to drink beer ... at least not in most of the USA and in many other countries.  You laughed at him when he told you to stop breaking the law. Guess you weren't laughing as much a little later.  You called him a "stupid m****r f****r"!!!  That is certainly not polite, not respectful, and not "lady-like". Sounds more like a spoiled young brat!<br>  <br>  You say you knew Mike wouldn't tell your brother on you. Really, I think that is just what he should have done; rather than spank you himself. But you say Mike is just like a brother to you. So in that sense likely he had "the right" to do that. Though I think "pulling" you across his lap and "lifting up" your skirt were both definitely wrong. Better would be having you bend over a desk or table and whacking your covered backside with the hairbrush ...for illegally drinking the beer AND for disrespect to someone older than you and is "like another brother" to you.<br>  .<br>  And, IMO, twenty smacks of his hand was NOT excessive; however, I do think his HAND should not have been "touching" your backside ... better he used a hairbrush or belt.<br>  .|`|9dc7211c44c17097c672d814b9900b0faa	he had no right. it sounds like he is treating you like you are 4 yeas old or something|`|AA10296506	No, he shouldn't have done that. You also shouldn't have been drinking at such a young age and shouldn't be using such disrespectful language. I'm very sorry your parents passed away. Don't be rude though, keep your manners and talk right. Tell your brother what you did, explain it all to him. Think before you do things, you're young.
tVPyRHEJaa	I agree with Krissy M|`|a8e2130188e45facab4c16a4a764104caa	Is there any valid reason why your parents don't spank you when you need it?<br>  <br>  Some children have OLDER brothers who are taking the place of absent or dead parents.  Then I'd think it not unreasonable for your older brother or sister to spank you as a parent would.<br>  .|`|ElgAP5L2aa	im 14 and i get spanked by my brother and sisters 2 <br>  like 1year ago me and my best friend went on a trip with my brother and he said i was geting on his nervs and he said if i dident quit talking that he was going to put a switch over my legs well i was with my friend and i dident think he was serious and i guess he was so he pulled over went and gor a switch took me to the back of the van and busted my legs and but for 5 min|`|N4nYw5B8aa	Um...there is something wrong with this picture! You are way too old to be spanked by ANYONE! I think you should discuss this with your parents first and if they don't listen, call Social Services and ask to speak to a Child Services officer. There is no excuse for this kind of abuse, and yes, sweetie, it is abuse. I know you're only 13 and you're probably pretty intimidated by the thought of calling for help, but this has got to stop! There are laws against this type of thing, sweetie.|`|AA11402154	Listen to your brother and you won't get in trouble.  You know what they say, an ounce of prevention...|`|vriwvQ7haa	im 14 iget spanked by my older bro and sis wen i dont follow there orders :D
BpZLDMsoaa	If he's lying to you then he's not worth it. But don't rush just to be the one to dump him, without hearing what he wanted to say. The thing is, it's better if you break up now before you've really fallen for him, it will hurt less this way.|`|wr2uiZk7aa	Maybe he found someone better.
sqmIO2u5aa	Hi! It is your right to know your biological father..So try to ask your mom about his basic details to make it less awkward..Anyway, she might tell you about him if only you will ask her nicely..Then if you want, you can search him to have more specified details of information..Using this reliable search provider, <a href="http://www.web-detective.com/index1.aspx," rel="nofollow">http://www.web-detective.com/index1.aspx...</a> you can acquire only true and accurate results information you wish to know..<br>  <br>  Good luck!!!|`|3ctchU2faa	Bring up the subject to your mom. Explain that you love her and your step dad very much, but you have been wondering more and more about your birth father and would like to know more about him. I would start with your mother for information as she was married to him.<br>  She might tell you "I'll tell you when you are older" and respect that. They did divorce when you were very young and your father doesn't know you. Your mother may decide to contact him and tell him that you would like to know more about him. Let her be the mediator.|`|8722a385a740fd3c165b65c08ed568ffaa	Don't do it--you'll only get your heart broken.  Remember, he didn't want anything to do with you.  If you go looking for him, and you find him and he rejects, then what are you gonna do?  I don't mean to be harsh, but men like that don't want to be found by their children.  You'll just get hurt.|`|LU7yg6Ejaa	what a mature 13yo you are!..ok darling you are going to have to ask straight out..."mom i want to find my dad..can i have his surname please?"..if mom gets upset sweetheart show her the question you have asked here on yahoo!..if you can find out dads last name,date of birth,and what kind of business he had he shouldnt be too hard to find..but honestly darling if he divorced mom because of falling pregnant,,really darling hes probably not worth knowing..you will always wonder and good on you for looking...i hope all goes well for you
4EWCegiRaa	Let me explain to you the 3 types of man:<br>  <br>  1.  The right man.  He can express himself, doesn't play games, and is actually interested.<br>  2.  The wrong man .  He can't express himself because he;s insecure and he usually has to make up for his insecurities to showing off, playing women, or being obsessed with how they look.<br>  3.  The other man.  This man isn't holding back his feelings or acting as if he doesn't care; he's just not interested in you.  He just hangs out for the attention and ease of it because you're satisfactory.<br>  <br>  If a respectable man is really interested, you won't have this problem.|`|8KVvfxdxaa	As a guy I try to keep my negative feelings to myself so as not to burden others with my problems. Its all about what we are taught as a child what a 'man' is supposed to be.  He leads his family, he shows no fear, he hides his grief (as long as he can)  and protects what is his from others trying to theft or harm.  With age comes wisdom but once the die is cast the form is hard to change when it is something so fundamental.<br>  That's also why we cannot turn down a double dog dare;)|`|urNrb3GBaa	we do care. well, most of us anyways. that is why we keep distant. either we are afraid to hurt YOU, or are afraid you will hurt US.|`|nuOt5017aa	you know what..alot of the times they DON"T CARE|`|BkdbiwSwaa	they r scarred of commentiment but im a girl and so am i

AA11974523	Don't worry about if they have more money than you.<br>  <br>  Those items won't make them any better of a person than you. Hold your head high.|`|rwZB7bP2aa	Think of it this way... she's not rich, her parents are.  She is growing up spoiled rotten, with no real responsibilities and the inability to really enjoy and take care of what she has.  I have a feeling that you feel like you are the 3rd wheel and really don't have anything in common with them.  I think that you should hold your head high and feel like a million bucks everyday because money has no value to true friendship.|`|Xx2Iu5FXaa	Don't worry about it. By the time you graduate high school, no one will care.
0GTKBM4Zaa	OMG have the same problem lol<br>  i'm waiting for him to find me.<br>  And your pretty young im 14 nearly 15 you shouldn't be worrying about things like this.|`|sGvEU9j8aa	seriously...<br>  wait it out, you are 12.<br>  it will come naturally.|`|HhSFwnuiaa	well im with you!<br>  <br>  i keep waiting for a guy...<br>  <br>  but its taking a long time.<br>  <br>  i think the key is to wait "for the right one".<br>  <br>  so yeah trsut me...<br>  <br>  even though you want to kiss him sooo bad<br>  <br>  just wait then when you do kiss it will be more romantic than you think! :D|`|0DdSoi4Maa	You'll know when it's the right time, it'll just happen like that.  I didn't get my first kiss till 17, well & at your age I wasn't thinking about guys.  I was just out doing what kids do.  It'll happen someday, there's no rush you're very young.|`|C30NreILaa	I didn't get my first kiss until I was 15 so don't worry about it and when the time comes it will be special and you will be happy that you waited|`|k26Vbizmaa	dude, you're 12. your supposed to like ponies and rainbows.|`|5Wd6sIqbaa	It isn't a big deal, just be patient, don't rush your first kiss, it's supposed to be special.
BxYWNm31aa	its ur choice<br>  but my uncle is married to a 21yr old and he is 33.|`|mVUpt8waaa	Your parents are dumb bitches.|`|yk4QFZBuaa	I'm 23 and dating someone who's 33- I got crap from my family at first too. Luckily they got to know him and now they love him.. But sometimes dating someone so much older than you is hard. He’s experienced so many more things in life than you have. I love my boyfriend to death but I advise you that if it’s not too late and you haven’t already fallen in love, RUN! Date someone your own age and grow up together. After all, most of the time families really do know what’s best for you!|`|z60TZr8paa	I was in a very similar situation but my family didn't know about him...mostly because he was separated when we met. I was 19, he was 32. It was fun for a while. More than anything I loved talking to him because he was the first guy I ever had intelligent conversations with. Most boys my age bored me. However I can totally understand your family being upset about this. It's a significant age gap and I'm sure they are wondering why the hell this guy isn't dating someone closer to his age. I'm sure they feel you are too young for him and you're just going to end up hurt. While you can't spend the rest of your life trying to please your family you have to remember you are still very young (even though you may feel very mature!) and they are looking out for your best interest. Generally in these situations they know best and I'm betting you know this. However, you're going to do what you want and hopefully they will be there to help pick up the pieces when this ends. That's what families are for.
dFHsAXDMaa	well as a mom and christian as well my kids are two girls 17 and 15 and two boys 14 and 11... my advice to you would be to hang out at her house with her watch a movie etc be around her family and let them get to know you and that you have good morals and values! Good luck oh and sneaking around is a sure fire way to get them to dislike you|`|ed9c52fcc32bc21499c8007eec999f5faa	It doesn’t really matter what anyone else's opinion is.  The law says until she turns 18 (not 16 as someone else stated--at least not in the US), her parents get to decide who she's allowed to spend time with/if she's allowed to date.  And if ALL her exs were 'assholes' then it would appear she's not capable of making good choices in that regard, so I can see her parents' point.  Note--I'm in no way implying that *you* are an 'asshole'<br>  <br>  And just to add this--if you think kissing isn't sexual (unless you’re referring to a kiss on the cheek, and I doubt you are), then you have a lot to learn about kissing.|`|AA11032586	You're a Christian, and calling exs what you did? Really? As far as what you should do, nothing. There is nothing you can do. First of all Parents said no. That's it. They don't even know your dating? Strike two. If your a Christian, read your Bible. From front cover to back, I bet you won't find anything about dating. What is the matter with honoring thy Mother and Father? Why can't you watch movies at her house? As far as kissing her and "stuff", but not sexual contact, don't go to a bar if you don't want to be called a drunk. If you are such a gentleman, prove it to the Parents. Obviously age has nothing to do with maturity.|`|hc89tLJcaa	If you love her, respect her parents' wishes. Get to know them. And, spend time with the whole family at her house, if they allow it. She will be 18 shortly. If you respect their wishes, her parents will have no problem with her dating you once she is of age. And, they see that you are willing to wait, they will know that you truly love their daughter. :)|`|Y8fDB2V7aa	just have patience and try to get along with her family (win them over) by showing them the love you have for her and the rest will just work out.|`|7342BXehaa	well, be friends with her family let them get to know you, tell them your principles|`|LU7yg6Ejaa	theres nothing her parents can do darling shes over 16...you sound like a decent young man,,,why not write a letter to her parents OR see them face to face alone and explain your good intentions...dont worry sweetheart,just be yourself..or just say nothing and wait til shes 18!!...good luck

Show her how much you love her by a simple surprise poem left on her pillow you wrote, or an unexpected night out to dinner. If you do this, she might realize how much you love her. When the time is right, then just explain how you want to move on to the next level. Tell her that if you weren't in love with her an only wanted sex, then you wouldn't have waited 6 or 7 months. (I assume that's the truth) If you tell her the truth and come clean, it will improve your relationship too. You can see how your communications skills are with each other.
a05818703edf627a70c2368c5b12f69daa	no i would not, because its not the first time, he is still in contact with her, meaning he doesn't really take his marriage seriously. and u will treat him badly, and he knows this. i can't tell u how many times i forgave my first husband, and kept taking him back. i too supported him, but it just got old, the same old thing over and over again. best to end it now before u wake up and old women who looks back on her life with nothing but regret. apologies matter little and are only given until they find someone new who will support and accept them for who they are. and there will always be another woman who wants them, theres always someone out there. there is no excuse to cheat, if someone wants to cheat they ought to be man enough to tell u and let u go. instead they keep u just so they will have somewhere to go. u can't compete with the other woman, because the other woman represents what he wants in life. this is a man who doesn't want to work and be responsible, which causes problems in the marriage, and as soon as there is another woman out there who falls for him, and who doesn't know the true him, he will leave u for her. with him all u have is a cheater and someone who is happy with letting u support him.|`|ghz5D5iLaa	I would not take him back after the first time.|`|i953FFZKaa	even though u 2 have been together for such a along time and have children... i wouldn't be w/ him.. epecially if he doesn't have a job<br>  i bet u r stressed out b/c i know i would be too<br>  u changed already and he hasn't yet <br>  that's not good<br>  u don't need him in ur life|`|jFi4ARUEaa	no cuz if he cheated once he'll do again especially if he did it twice already that u know about|`|WT5tYLdfaa	he aint ready to be taken back yet just because you matured doesnt mean he did so no dont take him back yet or ever|`|Bt1D1wWuaa	Absolutely NOT!!!  You sound like an intelligent and smart woman....now you need to do the smart thing.  I don't really think you need any of us to tell you that it's over and you need to move on.  Please don't say that you're staying because of the children because not only has your husband made a mess of things with you but he will mess up those poor children's heads that will affect them the rest of their lives.  Trust me when I tell you because my situation was not all that different from yours except mine wasn't cheating!  I was with my ex-husband for 5 years and then married for 5, so I was with him a total of 10 years.  I was told I may never be able to have children but by the grace of god, he blessed me with a beautiful baby girl after 3 years of marriage.  When things started to fall apart w/our marriage I suggested counseling.  The last thing I wanted was to get divorced and of course I thought of my daughter who was just under 2 yrs old.  Also, my parents were divorced when I was 5 but they kept getting back together and separate until I was 12.   That was the dumbest thing they could have done because my brother really paid the price emotionally.  It took him a long time to get it together....probably around the time he was in his 30's.  Plus, I had my share of dysfunction for awhile too.   What it all boils down to is I believed I was still in love with my ex and I wanted my daughter to have her father around but the constant fighting and behavior was a far cry for being role model parents.  That's why I decided to divorce and move on....for the sake of my child!  Sometimes I think when we've been involved in a relationship that long, we are more in love with the idea of being in love, when everything else points to the opposite.  You sound like a strong woman and you and your children deserve so much better!!!  Your husband has already admitted to cheating 2x and now maybe 3???  And those are only the ones you know about.....could there actually be more????  I would venture to guess........most likely!  At this point, I don't believe he's going to change.  When you think about it, he really has it made.  You go to work, take care of the home, take care of the bills, take care of the children and he does what????   He sits around on his lazy behind, goes off and has affairs (most likely on your dime) and then he does what?  Makes your life miserable, and your children, that's what!  If you don't think these kids know what's going on, you're dead wrong.  And what a horrible example to set for them.  Would you want your daughter to be treated and living like this?  Is this how you would want your son to treat women when he gets older?  Seriously, please consider divorce and show your children and yourself a better life....they are worth it and so are you!!!|`|fMfOen5Iaa	It is the hardest thing in the world to forgive someone for cheating, i know, i have been trying to do it for over a year but it just keeps coming up in my mind. As far as I know he hasn't had contact with her in at least a year but... when you have that feeling that you were fooled the first time for however long he was seeing her how can u trust him again. I know it is easier said then dont' because i am still with mine as well but I know it would be best to move on. We have kids together as well and i try and say to myself i am stayin for the kids but the kids hear us argue when we do and that isn't nice either. The only thing is that you need to make a firm decision and stick with it no matter what, when there are kids involved u can't keep flip flopping because they get hurt but it all as well<br>  good luck!!
Wi97GrVVaa	well if you're only 'kinda' seeing him, I wouldn't worry too much about getting anything too great. You could get him something related a favorite band. If you were more serious, I'd suggest a new ipod or something.|`|DS1cPBg5aa	What are his musical interests?<br>  My boyfriend plays guitar, so I bought him a pedal for his birthday...<br>  <br>  Just base it off his interests, and in worst case, ask him!|`|RpxKmUBUaa	A couple books of poetry, a volleyball, and some drinking glasses(hey, its not beer, right?)
txkTyn0laa	No, dont worry about it. I read in a magazine that when you have wet dreams about other people you would never think of as sexy or anything it jsut means you have something you desire, like body type. It doesnt mean that your gay. So you have nothing to worry about.|`|GhsqaXsdaa	I lost you at "his mom came home and we had to lock her in her room."|`|Wg0VteZ9aa	you might like girls but your mind tells you otherwise|`|griwMyO6aa	Well I woulden't tell her if it's your first one(dream like this). This dosen't mean your gay. Alot of people are bicurious. Maybe you're at a point that your not sure if you're bisexual. Also the wet dream could have been from the drinking.|`|pMDY89KQaa	lol you may be bisexual.?|`|S30Dcsvgaa	Do you have feelings for men? Okay then. Shut up and move on.|`|x3RGtco8aa	wow thats crazy idk maybe a gay person might be able to qanswer thjis|`|6oZcHIjiaa	Dude- chill out!<br>  <br>  First off, everyone has homosexuality thoughts. Its a proven fact. <br>  <br>  You probably had a dream like that cause you were watching that play and had a sexual desire. Not to mention you were drinking. You always dream about the last thing you thought of before you go to bed....<br>  <br>  quit trippin...<br>  <br>  though only if you want to give your gf a good laugh would I consider to tell her....|`|XnIkIwY3aa	Typically a person has 3-5 dreams a night. Usually we only remember 1 or 2 if any.<br>  <br>  Odds are your wet dream came from another dream.|`|DcBtM3oWaa	You locked your friends mom in her room?|`|YWcsgdiUaa	perhaps you should consider a career in the arts|`|Jg6Z3dUsaa	Dude dont tell her about it. There are somethings we keep to ourselves.|`|DyPVKQg6aa	Its definitely going to effect your relationship so if you dont want that to happen then dont tell her. Its not unusual for guys to see another dude with a good body and want the same thing. And most men have hoomo sexual thoughts; its natural for some reason, but it doesnt mean were gay. Theyre meerly thoughts. And most men have gay dreams; none of them will admit it but most guys do. Whats unusual is the wet dream. Thats the only part that would cause worries or doubts so dont tell your girlfriend for it will hinder your relationship.<br>  But just about everything else is natural so dont think too much on it.<br>  <br>  Good Luck.|`|jiOGmVlSaa	i think ou should slow down a little bit. dreams arre just dreams, though they do mean some htings at times .. but this doesnt neccessarily mean that you are gay just because of this dream. it could easily mean somethign else. maybe you felt uncomfortable wit hyour own body because of seeign all these strong sculptured males in frotn of you at cirque du sole. i went to cirque du sole aswell, i live in vancouver. it was a good show, and it w as really cool too :) ive seen the guys, and they are pretty built. i dont think that this dream is telling you that you are gay, its not really how it works. feel free to tell you girlfriend, but really there is no reason unless you really want to. if you are attracted to her then you are not gay, you could possibly be bi .. but i highly doubt that :^) this dream may have got you thinking, but always remember that there are other possibilities than being gay. i hope you make your decision wisley, : ) goodluck !

Wo5Ezmwiaa	I think the age difference is just making you take the things he says and does, differently than you would if a guy your own age was saying and doing those things. Honestly, calling you his "little girl" isn't that bad. Also, sitting in a guy's lap is typical in relationships. Almost everyone does that. And, being called "cute" is a compliment. It's an endearing term, nothing babyish. Also, you being a virgin may also make you feel a bit more "babyish" when you're with him, cause he is older and more experienced. Really a 7 year age gap isn't that big. I think it's just a mental thing. The age difference is in your head, and so you're interpreting things differently than you would if you were with a guy your age or younger. So just try to not think about it. Don't let it get to you. Tell yourself that these things are normal and having nothing to do with age. He isn't treating you like a child.
XmJZkFuMaa	I believe she would be your second cousin.  Your mother and her mother would have been cousins, so I think you'd be second cousin.  Some states allow marriages between second cousins.  I wouldn't.|`|1pZLQSz0aa	Dont risk it...that simple|`|1235333b4f34f1147fc81bf4aef8885baa	She is your second cousin.  In most states, second cousin marriage is not allowed.  It's worth checking the laws in your own state.  Personally, I'd move on unless you have a compelling reason to try to pursue her (perhaps you've already gotten her pregnant for example).  Cousin marriages produce children with higher rates of birth defects than non-related marriages.|`|TIy7c7Vlaa	I believe that would be a second cousin.  You might be able to marry check your local/state laws and if you are thinking children see a Dr that specializes in genetic counseling.|`|NENNHNVPaa	She is your second cousin and marriage would depend on the state that you live in.  However, that's a awfully close blood line to be marrying.|`|AA11032586	Sorry, Man. Too close of a branch on the family tree for me.

He is a married man that came on to you! YUCK. He has done this before with other women. You were just going to be his next.   He has a woman at home with feelings and probably children too. He is a stinkin scumbag who sees you as weak and a target. He wanted to use you.  It's a good thing you said what you said to him, because it showed you had some self respect. Get over it and find someone your own age.|`|AA11464317	He has a wife, maybe kids too. So he has a fantasy about making it with a young thing from the office. You. If you play into his fantasy you might ruin his marriage and if they divorce his kids will suffer.

Is it really worth it?|`|FmBuFsnfaa	b natural..u will not listen to nebody expect ur mind..isnt it? u just want to know what others think..many ppls here said no here..i just believe that we should not do bad of others..until u r not doing bad of others..as i think it is not bad..but remember dont fall in love with that guy coz it will effect his married life..just b friends with him..ok? pls.|`|FzS3aphWaa	Why would you meet a married man who has told you he only wants sex?  He cannot take you out or share your life as he has made a commitment to the person he is choosing to stay with.  He liked to flirt with you at work because it was easy.  He wants to have a physical relationship with you because it will be easy.  Meanwhile, he has a wife at home to offer him love and security.<br>  <br>  Find a man who can give you a relationship and companionship, someone who can be there for you and who does not need to go home to his wife.  Dating a married man means that you are sharing him and his wife is getting the larger share.  Why put up with the leftover crumbs?  While you are putting up with him, you are giving up the time that you could be spending with someone who could give you so much more.

My brother tells me that every now & then who's 19 & even my hot neighbor who tried to get in mine said the same thing.  From what they say if you put out quick the guys not going to love you.  I think when a guy really does love a girl he won't really say it b/c he maybe afraid of her response & they tend to wait a long time debating when's the right time to say it.|`|XnIkIwY3aa	Probably.|`|TmvlWVH7aa	yea...he just said that to get in your pants....and if he meant it....then you need to stay away from him because he doesn't know what love is......better yet, just dont sleep with people you meet on vacation|`|QD2AJv22aa	probably|`|JQYuM4EDaa	yes, love isnt made in a week|`|zLnnkTX0aa	your way to easy second date sex that's not good tighten up a little bit|`|x3RGtco8aa	YUp!!!|`|JzTg0hg5aa	yup
AA10065812	??This is becoming a problem as more than 70% of soldiers are experiencing it with 50% being arrested for DV within the first year.  So, what do we do.  <br>  <br>  Do we need to have all exiting soldiers committed to a detention center until someone can figure out what to do about this?<br>  <br>  Do we set up programs to make it easier for women to leave the men?<br>  <br>  Either way, it's a punishment for the soldiers for their service to this country.<br>  <br>  If you're on here asking questions, have you contacted PTSD support groups?|`|rH33ty23aa	Well all he managed to do with that was fu+k his retirement|`|Ff7mCzlPaa	You will probably need to get a job. <br>  <br>  I don't think wives who leave get anything, except alimony if the court orders it.|`|AA10494978	I'm afraid the army will be no help to you.  They don't exactly see helping a spouse, either present or former as part of their duty.  <br>  <br>  You will have to start searching the civilian sites.  First you need a job.  I don't know where you guys are posted, so I can't tell you what the job situation is, you know better.  <br>  <br>  However, if he did get a dishonorable discharge, that means no pension, no benefits and a criminal record that follows him into civilian life.  So to answer your question bluntly, no, the army won't help.  But there are a ton of civilian job force opportunities.  Start by going to the Internet sites of your local paper and see what they are offering as far as jobs.  Good luck to you!|`|AA11996507	Your husband is no longer in the Army, hence you are no longer an Army wife.  That's the first thing.  The second thing is - you want benefits for being "put in this position"?  What position is that - the position of knowingly marrying a service member and turning your back on him when the going gets rough?<br>  If you want to leave your husband, that is your choice.  But you will be in exactly the same position as any other woman who comes to that decision.  You will have to build a new life for yourself and your son.  The Army won't do it for you.
AA10413046	Listen to your husband complain and tell you about his day then when he is done tell him you don't know how he keeps doing it.  But, that you love him and are proud of him and that you know he will figure it out.  The best thing to do with your husband when he is stressed like that is pretty much don't add to his stress by your feelings about it.  Let him handle it.|`|W9B6EJrWaa	Just tell your husband how wonderful he is.  What a fine, good man you know he is, and tell him you are proud of him.  Tell him he makes you proud to be his wife, and tell him that you are on his side and that you will stand with him no matter what.  <br>  <br>  My husband went through a similar situation and I just had to stand by helplessly while he was forced out of a good position, which he did well, because of office politics and some really bad behavior on the part of his boss.  There was nothing I could do about it but like a couple of years after it happened, my husband and I were talking about it, and he told me that he didn't know what he would have done, without me to turn to, and to talk to, and to be there for him.  It was the sweetest thing and I just cried, because at the time it was happening it seemed many times that I was just an afterthought for my husband, and he never really said too much about my support of him, but a couple of years later it came up in our conversations, and he told me then what it meant to him.  He did feel my support, and he did treasure it, and it did make him stronger.  <br>  <br>  I could not change the outcome of what happened eventually - eventually he was fired in a disgraceful manner - but I could show my love and my support, which I did. <br>  <br>  And it was important, and my support mattered a great deal to him.|`|AA11391968	Tell your husband you are behind him whatever he decides!

Is the truck in YOUR name??? if so, why in the world would you have to give him your truck? is it something your mother negotiated? if so did you deed him the truck?

HKF4tdmhaa	Well you are an asian right! Many Indians or south east asians are short. Pakistani's are a bit taller. Some north Indians are.<br>  5'6'' or 5'7" is a good height but the your heart throb has to be ideally 5'1" or so or at the max she can be your height.<br>  My man is 5'7" only and I am 5'1" we make an ideal pair;-)<br>  <br>  Well asian society generally wants men to be taller or of same height for their women.  Well celebrities though have exceptions man. Take Tendulkar. Shah Rukh Khan latest movie heroine's are taller than him.<br>  dont worry much.<br>  <br>  Your height really doesn't matter in physical pleasures but you weight may! dont get obese. For short people do look too fat. You got to be agile and flexible to please a woman though! If its for physical pleasure I tell you won't have to keep kissing on the lips all the time when you are fusion. While there are many ways and positions to do it if you prefer.<br>  <br>  Only thing is to avoid people commenting on a couple's height taller men marry a bit shorter girls. Be a macho any girl will love you. Height too doesn't matter than to know that her man is more masculine. Be like a horse with muscular self.<br>  <br>  Hey we really care of how you are at heart. And there are definitely many cute little girls like me(I am aleady engaged so excse me!) looking for a boy like you.|`|AA10413046	NOT extremely short.  5'9 is the average height for men in this country.  While there are some shallow ladies out there, I believe most women are NOT looking for certain characteristics in a guy, they are looking for the whole package.  If you are a good guy overall as you say, don't worry about your height.  Just be you!|`|NOhaRLNFaa	Height doesn't matter to me. I had a crush on one of my best friends and he's 5'3". I'm 5'4". If you go onto YouTube and look up David Archuleta (runner-up on American Idol last season), he's 5'6". Don't beat yourself up about your height!<br>  If a girl likes you for you, she's not going to care about your stats. Just keep looking, and I promise she'll come along!<br>  <br>  *smile4me* :)|`|Gl7tkWV7aa	No, short is like 4'9''. You're 5' 6''  That's just fine for me. 2 inches taller than me.

The guy I have the hugest crush on is my height, soon to be like half an inch shorter than me and I could care less!|`|JZMfUDylaa	a lot of girls care about height which i find annoying and shallow. I'm 5 foot 3 and my last boyfriend was only three inches taller than me and I didn't care at all! I could care less if he was the same height.

They care about personality. Imagine how a really tall girl feels. I would suggest not trying to be someone else. Keep your body the way it is. No buff. No trying to be skinny. Girls don't like guys that try and change themselves. And if you keep trying, you will get too obsessed in trying to make yourself perfect. Be the way you are and you will find many girls. I promise.|`|DXkE7Go5aa	It all depends on the girl. Most girls do like tall guys,  like my friend who will only notice guys who are at least three inches taller then her. While others like me don’t really go for height just as long as he is a little taller than me like half an inch is good.|`|80sJznfRaa	Arre yaar, don't worry about wat ppl say about ur height!  Since ur a good guy overall, it's wats on the inside that girl's are interested in, not so much ur height! =]|`|pZ2fA8VZaa	yeah dude it sucks being asian,, im half.. Im 5'8" and im short i think that average height for a guy is around 5'10"|`|SCFD8AFJaa	hi... you sound like you are a real good guy and you have all those good qualities... when it comes to dating, I would not say you are extremely short. Most women are around 5.3', and you said you were 5.6 or maybe 5.7'. Do not lift too much weights it will stop your growth completely, and it will make you appear shorter. Just maintain a nice slim looking body and you will do just fine. Just do not go for girls that are taller than you, that will be a little uncomfortable.... oh by the way Brad Pit is 5.7' lol.

It's not because she hates your or because you're boring to talk to or because she just doesn't want to talk to you or anything like that, she's just tired man. My girlfriend will go from fully awake to totally out in like 5 minutes, and it sounds like the girl you talk to is the same way. <br>  <br>  If anything, I would say it's a good thing she falls asleep on the phone. It means she doesn't mind dozing off with you on the other end, which is good. Wouldn't you rather her just talk to you till the second she falls asleep instead of saying 'I'm tired, talk to you later, bye' and abruptly hanging up the phone every night?<br>  <br>  (Yes, you would.)<br>  <br>  Hope this helps :D
JxY5WXF2aa	Yeah so you spend all this time together and you guys have great chemistry but you are not officially dating because you don't want any pressure. Well I would say that he is sticking around and doing all of this stuff because he wants something from you. Guys are simple. He is paying you all this attention and time because it is apart of your standards. If you didn't have these standards and stipulations he would have had sex with you along time ago and probably split or stuck around long enough to continue to have sex with you because you don't know his true motives. A guy will tell you immediately if he wants a relationship with you. He isn't going to spend all this time with you for no good reason he has a reason and if you knew he was trying or going to make it official with you, you wouldn't need to ask such a question. My advice to you would be to ask him where is everything leading. Is he looking for a relationship or what? Be upfront. Seriously.  Don't think that you are adding unnecessary tension because you have a right to know where it all is leading and he should be willing to tell you. If he bullshits you then he is in it for sex no matter how long it takes. He's going to hang out with you be sweet to you and everything else until he can have sex with you. If he wants a relationship he'll say so with no hesitation.
EUnx6Ncoaa	3-5 dollars a kid per hour|`|GuNBgiEWaa	The person who these kids belong to must either trust you very much and/or  must have something pretty important to do that can't be rearranged.  If that's the case, I know that I would be a bit more generous.  I also think that all the posters that answered so far may have forgotten how busy a 2 and 4 year old can keep <br>  ANYONE, much less an 11 year old.  The responsibility is greater because you have to watch them much more closely and do everything for them. I know that if I entrusted anyone to watch my children for a mere hour, I would compensate them with 20 bucks as long as the did their job well.  I have to admit part of that money would be because of the fact that most 11 year old's I know wouldn't  want to babysit.<br>  <br>  Now if this was say, something you had the responsibility of doing every day, then I would say that 10 bucks (for 2 kids that small) and for one hour would be fair for both people.<br>  <br>  I used to pay my daycare 25 bucks for 6 or more hours every day for just my four yr old. And they charged considerabley more,  the younger the children were.  That was a good 6+ years ago and the last I heard (a couple of years ago)  daycare charges had doubled. <br>  And as far as I know, most of them will not agree to watch children for only 1 hour, once in a blue moon.<br>  <br>  That's why finding a trusted sitter, pre-teen or adult, is special and deserves a bit more. <br>  <br>  Don't ever watch kids for free (or offer to) because if you bump into the wrong kind of parent, they could take complete advantage of the situation.|`|QoOx93PPaa	Well, an adult gets minimum wage. 11 is close to half the age of an adult. So half of minimum wage?|`|a3ffZgRsaa	8 bucks an hour for both|`|2HJYblAPaa	To be fair, I would say look at the current minimum wage which is I think about 6.55/hr and gt paid  that for BOTH children.  It's not like FICA or insurance is being deducted or anything to that effect. That is more than fair for an 11 yr old. When you get old enough to get an official paycheck, the government will deduct all those. For example, if you have a check for $1500 for 2 wks, you may only take home between 1,000 and 1,300 depending on deductions.|`|g59GJB8Kaa	i would say 5 dollars because 10 dollars is something a 16-18 year old would get paid (im not making fun of the 11 year olds) but 5 is a Reasonable amount :)|`|F35Eb8Ziaa	i think $4 is poyfect!|`|RM2a6XDNaa	id say 10 dollars an hour|`|1235333b4f34f1147fc81bf4aef8885baa	An 11 year old IS too young to be solely responsible for children that young for any length of time, sorry.<br>  <br>  $2.5 an hour is probably a decent rate for a young babysitter.  If you're babysitting for an evening, maybe a $20 would be a good amount.|`|khwr87SVaa	im 13 and a guy and i charge 5$ per kid per hour, 8$ if they are under 2 but thats just me

It's petty|`|Hrky2Tigaa	i found the information here|`|N4nYw5B8aa	I think you need to take a step back here and listen to what you're saying. People only imitate the actions of others that they admire. You can't tell me you've never seen a pair of shoes or an outfit someone was wearing and thought that you should get one just like it! Your SIL may be having a difficult time finding her own form of expression. You could maybe offer to help her find her niche and be a decent human being, or you could keep complaining about it and carry that baggage around with you. Get over it!
6evKakpsaa	I think that is one great thing about relationships, knowing that there's that room to improve on. It was similar with my soon to be wife and myself. She is brilliant, don't get me wrong, but i knew more thing than she did, especially when it came to world events, politics, math, science, and other things like that. But then, she on the other hand knows things i don't know, many things. In this way, i feel our relationship has grown stronger. She astonishes me occasionally, as do i her. Trust me, you'll never know what she really knows until you really get to know her, that can take years. Don't reconsider you decision based on this. As i see it, (don't take offence by this, every guy in you position faces this), you're scared, and that fear would cause you to find any fault; this is a time when the smallest of bumps can cause major fights in your relationship, trust me. One week before i proposed to my girlfriend for two years, we had this major blowout over how i parked my car, yes, how i park my car. It was our third and worst fight in the two years, but today when we look back at it, we laugh. In any case, do not let this obscure you decision, if you love her, go for it. No one, no couple, are equal, and that’s what makes life, a relationship, fantastic and works. From the way you wrote about her, it seems you love her, but are scared. We've all been there, don't let that fear it be a menace. Go for it and Good Luck.|`|9HFYshQ1aa	Well,If you are expecting your girl to be smart enuf,y are u going for this one??Getting irritated now itself is very bad sign of love.Just the Appearance wil not count.As far as she doesn fit into ur expectations dont go for her.Later u cant step back as u think of the long run.|`|jRl43824aa	You need to be sure of your thoughts on her before proposing.

BUT, if you have to think that hard and long about it, you might not want to make the commitment of marriage. You should have no doubts when you marry someone. Marriage is hard enough even if you start out without any doubts at all.|`|AA10899659	you're wrong.  you are too cocky.  this chick speaks 5 languages and you fear that she AIN'T SMART ENOUGH? man get over yourself.

I've been in a situation similar to yours. Guys like us are attracted to intelligent females. If a female is not intelligent then we won't/take longer/harder to fall in love with her, or if that intelligence is not there then it's a nagging feeling that never goes away (from my experience).<br>  <br>  For us to fall in love with a girl, she has to have intelligence. Weird huh, some guys just want women for their bodies, but guys like you and me want them for their brains.<br>  <br>  I think it's better to leave her and be friends with her, because it's a nagging thing. It will get to you eventually just like it did to me. The real victim here is her, and it's not her fault either.|`|xfj1B7YSaa	dude if its love ud learn how to accept her flaws. she cant b perfect. nobody is. geez give her some slack. if u hate her lack of knowledge more than you love her as a being, then dont propose. if u cant stand her right now, what makes you thnk you'd be able to stand her with the rest of ur life..til death do u part?????<br>  <br>  <br>  and may i add that you are being ridiculous. she speaks 5 languages and ur implying that shes an ignoramus b***h? puh leeez. grow up. i thnk ur the stupid one in the relationship. for failing to see of what an incredible girl u have. just so you know you do sound cocky and overconfident|`|k0zAhV4eaa	well if you can make a list of good things about her, as well as bad, and the good out weighs the bad then marry her. because the only thing you can name that's bad is her inelligence. she's smart it just so happens to be that you're smarter. your about to propose meaning you knew her for a while and you tolerated it so why stop now? accept her for he little flaw. nobody's perfect.|`|49b9f11e44e18077f6f0e62710cda0d0aa	Sounds to me like you have a great girl on your hands. I mean she speaks 5 languages which is pretty impressive. Maybe your just a little picky which is ok. I'm the same way when it comes to women. I usually tend to overlook all their great attributes and focus more on their flaws. If you can only find one flaw in her then it seems like shes the girl for you my man.|`|qtt7gy9Maa	You know what dude, if this is the only thing you have to worry about then you are a retard.

You could make a request to the court to order to obey the pickup time, along with a cash bond or bond certificate that she forfeits if she repeats the error.<br>  <br>  You could also start their bedtime routines, such as baths and brushing their teeth.  You could inform her that if she has not arrived by a certain time, the children will be put to bed and she can pick them up in the early morning.<br>  <br>  Depending on your state laws, your conversations with her can be recorded, in case she claims you just denied her access to the children.<br>  <a href="http://www.rcfp.org/taping/" rel="nofollow">http://www.rcfp.org/taping/</a><br>  <br>  If this behavior continues, what are your long term goals?

When she gets there, she'll know you're not there, and she'll call your cellphone.  Just tell her, "Oh, since you were so late picking them up, I just went ahead and took them to the grocery store with me.  We'll be there in about 10 minutes."  Then don't go home for about 20 minutes. <br>  <br>  I always find that giving people a taste of their own medicine works wonders.|`|AA11996507	Enjoy the extra time you have with them and make sure you don't make any plans for activities on your own until 8:30.|`|Ff7mCzlPaa	realize she's late for everything.  <br>  <br>  we can't control what other people do|`|4iUhdKKiaa	just talk about it.  it soundslikeur fussing about nothing.  just tell her to be on time cause u got xyz going on.|`|hcgaizJCaa	If you don't mind....what's the problem?|`|ORNCLGtFaa	Here in Michigan you file a "parenting time complaint" at Friend of the Court.

Pretty sad we have to envolve the courts in a simple matter of punctuality. Or in my case...common sense. Good luck!
mzNLfY4Caa	Honestly, I never REALLY send anything by mistake. I usually send it "on accident" because I want a response from the person. Okay she really wants you to talk to her. You have showed that you do not hold grudges and it seems like she is over it, if you feel like you want to take it out on her a little longer, reply to her and say, "oh oops" and just keep it casual. Act like you don't care. But if you "want her back" say, "Oh, it was a cute pic anyway" Depends on what you want with this girl. <br>  <br>  But that is really funny. A PICTURE? come on...I mean I know I have sent accidental, random rant messages, but never pictures. That is way to specific to be making a mistake especially if you guys haven't talked in days. <br>  anywho, good luck, and play her game if you'd like, send her a picture and say OOPs wasn't for you..|`|J30Gh5O6aa	LOL yeppp ive done that. "by mistake"|`|mR0N9UW8aa	I know how this works She did it on purpose to kind of just show you herself, so you will think about her. I think it means that she is trying to get you to talk to her without her apologizing first. But yes she did send it to you on purpose. At least it means she has been thinking about you.|`|GQjIkO3iaa	hmmmmm.....thats hard to tell<br>  she could have realized it and meant to make up with you, then later on decided against it<br>  or she could have really made that mistake <br>  (ive never made that mistake, but i guess its possible)|`|XFGmmF90aa	She might have done it on purpose, because some girls are like that.

Digitalcameras nowadays are pretty expensive to get a good qualityone. <br>  <br>  I would go for the necklace in my opinion.|`|bMLdEkncaa	well it depends on if u really like her. A digital camera is really expensive for someone uve just met. a necklace it okay depending on what type. i really dunno. if she's a nice girl and not materialistic then she should appreciate anything u get her. i dont think the actual gift is important. in my opinion i think someone who takes the time out to do something for someone is really sweet. MAybe u can surprise her early in the morning with flowers. girls always love flowers. spend the entire day with her. if its nice out do have a picnic and cuddle. it sounds lame but those r really sweet things. if u think about it most guys dont do that. most wanna take u to the movies or out to eat. this really takes no thought at all in most cases. spending the time to make something for her and spoiling her a bit with affection always makes a girl melt. its really hard to find a guy like that.|`|eAIapfXsaa	Digital camera sounds good IF you can afford it. Don't spend too much money. Girls don't like you for the money you spend on them. Get a thoughtful gift.

But if you are not then you need to listen to your mother.|`|P0wMTzDFaa	Tell him you stil have feelings for him.|`|3kBcHJIIaa	In my opinion, the best thing to do would be to sit down with your mother, and calmly talk to her about the situation. Tell her about your feelings for this guy, and apologize for upsetting her. Maybe, asking for another chance would be a good thing to do. If you take things slowly with her, maybe she'll feel a little more open to letting you see him. If you still talk to this guy, maybe tell him that you don't want to do the things you used to. Cutting out the"pornographic" things would probably make a big difference. I'm sure if you explain your emotions calmly and rationally she'll see your perspective.|`|3nL4BgCjaa	Do you see yourself in five years with him?<br>  <br>  Probably not.<br>  <br>  I wouldn't be too concerned.

If people acted on this there would be even more problems and divorces in marriage. Let it go you will be grateful you did later on. It's a huge mistake to stay on fantasy island when you live in reality.|`|AA10413046	You are bored and need to find other things to occupy your time and your thoughts.  It's normal to think about the what ifs.  It's not good to keep entertaining those thoughts.  If you do not cut this person out of your life you will regret it.  It is a slippery slope you are on.  Think of it like this, would you want to ruin a sure thing with your husband just to see if how this other guy is like when even you said he is nothing compared to your husband.|`|ghz5D5iLaa	You don't have to stop being his friend. You just need to make sure that he stays only a friend.|`|C59bTKO2aa	Part of the problem is that you got involved with your husband so early in your life.  You didn't get to experience dating others and how empty a lot of those relationship are.  When you miss a part of your development, sometimes you try to fill in with a lot of what ifs.  So you have a fixation on this other guy that you have known for years, and probably just because you've have known him so long.   You admit that your husband is a total jewel and you wouldn't want to be with anyone else.  So what if you had met the other guy first, you probably would have dated for a while and eventually broken up.  A best friendship would have never developed, and you wouldn't know him today.  If nothing has happened between the two of you, then there is nothing to feel guilty about.  I think that you need to get this into perspective, it's not sinful to talk to a man if your married.  It is not sinful to fantasize about running off with best friend or Brad Pitt or winning the Lotto, as long as you realize it's just a fantasy.  Everyone fantasizes to a certain degree, it's natural.  You picked the right husband, you realize the other guy doesn't hold a candle to him, you should be rejoicing in your insightfulness, not the what ifs.|`|f8fs6kycaa	fren...both ur husband and ur best fren is required in ur life...c but u should understand the importance of both in the positions they have to get in ur life...<br>  <br>  u have got married 2 dis wonderful man as u told...so he's is urs for life long and let me tell u a hus and a wife relation is so very divine on this earth if u consider it in the best way...u need ur hus at every step u take in life and for him 2 also take every step u have 2 lead by his side...<br>  <br>  and a fren...c fren is also required whn u need...there's an all saying a fren in need is a good fren in deed...u also require him in and u for him whn at all times in pain and happiness but he's never equal to ur hus...<br>  <br>  feelin my dear fren it can com across any person...v all r human beings..even ur hus might have som feelin for another woman..but he has given a place for u in his heart and he wudnt allow any1 2 try even peek thru that space of his...the same way just look into ur heart..give some tim 2 understand urself...u will also c somthing lik dat...<br>  <br>  its easy for a relation 2 breakup..it jus requires a sec tim or lesser..but jus imagine how long hav u taken d pain 2 understand ur hus and built up dis relation of urs which as u said is very successful...u need 2 always maintain d lov, trust and understandin b/w ur partners...u shud definetly b a part of ur frens bad and gud times but remain as a fren...jus 4get it...al d best|`|i0LUuhyLaa	You need to do the right thing and let the friendship go at least for now.

The solution, you will agree, is to focus on what is logical and healthy, not how you feel.<br>  You will end up in your freind's arms eventually if you don't knock it off. You seem to clearly understand that the way you relate to this friend is creating discord in your heart about your marriage. If it is the case that you are committed to your marriage and making it work, I would listen to that voice telling you to get out of that friendship, as unpleasant an idea as that is. You need, more than anything, to break the habit of this friend.<br>  Just be straight with your friend and say, I feel our relationship is crossing boundaries and I'm not interetsed in losing my husband over you.<br>  Force yourself to count off not less than 22 days straight of not calling your friend. You will hate yourself if you lose a husband that you love over a curiosity about this other guy.|`|sCCjAKllaa	You need to seriously just forget about this other guy. I understand you always think about hypothetical situations, but you really shouldn't be doing that. Why can't you just be friends with someone without tryin to imagine what could've been or anything? That's just wrong, and you know it. Your husband commited to you because he loves you, and you should be happy with that instead of constant wondering about another guy.<br>  <br>  Anyway, your husband should be your #1 priority.

This all assumes you want to stay married because if you continue to indulge yourself with this other guy your marriage will end....badly.|`|F7PU16eXaa	Personally, I think you should continue talking this guy for a couple more months, help him through this time with his father, then stop talking to him completely. Although you have not cheated yet, what you are doing is borderline. If your husband is such a nice guy, and you want to be with him and love him etc etc, then there is really no reason for you to be hanging out with a guy you possbily have feelings for. Something like that could destroy your marriage.<br>  <br>  It sounds like you are suffering more from "what ifs" than from actually loving this guy. I think you may be wishing you had not gotten married so early and had experienced more. However, you are married, and if you love your husband and he loves you, you are very lucky. You should not risk ruining it I don't think.|`|I2gs5opxaa	hii it seams as your both good friends even before you met your hubbie, but just because you care for others like your friend that dont mean your doing anything bad with him as you have said you have allways dont everything right so never be ashamed i bleave that hubbie knows you well enough that you wont, i see that god has giving you a good caring heart so talking explaning things with hubbie will help just maybe hubbie will help you he cares as well .|`|ISCewF75aa	In my opinion, and it's just that an opinion, in the end it is your life and you will do what you feel you have to.<br>  I feel that you are already cheating on your husband whether or not  you have done "anything" thing with this man, the fact that the two of you talk about what could of been sounds to me like you have checked out of your marriage.  You are emotionally unavailable to your husband, therefore cheating.<br>  I say either cut all ties to this man, if he cares for you he would honor your choice and let you give your marriage all of your attention which it deserves, or tell your husband what you honestly think of this man (if you can't you'll see why I say your cheating) and give your marriage a chance.<br>  I wish you the best of luck.<br>  My first marriage was like that and well... that's why there was a second.|`|U8rjbwUBaa	you are silly ,you don't think it is hurting your one and only good husband.he would be in a very small group of husbands as well as a male.lose the other before it to late girl.your so call best friend will tell you anything you want to hear,do anything right up untill you get with him,he is after the b....and that would be all.the catch of anothers wife.the ego that goes with that...wake up.,but you are right about the horrible incident what this is the first one he has had.your husbane is having a horrible incident with these two guys in your life .but who praying for him-gee i will-better still hand him this way please.|`|aaCMNSB2aa	it's natural to feel like maybe you've missed something when you get married earl y or never been in another serious relationship other then the one you're in. i have an idea but this could be very risky... tell your husband. If what you say is true, he could be very understanding on the matter and it's easier if you have the support. He may even had/ or still have the same feelings as you do now. You can also go see marriage counseling. as for the guy... just stop talking to him; horrible incident or not; stop making excuses. Also think, if you husband did this to you, what would you want him to do?<br>  <br>  --I wish you three the best, CutieNiki|`|aeLyiRczaa	Well, pray that God helps you see when it is the devil that is working on you and to help you understand that.  Also, ask God to help you truly see the blessings he has given you in your mate and to help you appreciate them more.<br>  <br>  Now you need to admit it has never been wise of you to keep having this friend after marriage.  Look, most people do not set out to go have sex with another.  It is often a very innocent thing at first which becomes an affair.  If you actually are a Christian, then you know not to put yourself in situations like this to start with.<br>  <br>  You and the other guy had the opportunity to have been together, but for one or another reasons you did not hook up.  Just like the old say of they are an ex for a reason, they are your mate for a reason instead of the other person being.<br>  <br>  Do not blow it.  If you have a good marriage, cut the other guy loose and jettison him.  Your husband and you both have no need to have temptations like this about.  And trust me, if a person really is a true and real friend, they do not want to cause your marriage problems anyway and they do not want to cause you to be tempted.|`|cQJGaUK4aa	You need to let him go before you lose your husband,  and the "what if's" in life doesn't provide you with someone you can depend on and will be beside you through thick and thin.<br>  Let the friend go and maybe he will move on and find someone for him self and if this keeps on then you need to get some professional help .<br>  I wish you the best in this .|`|p0BVk8lhaa	You're right to pray for help.  But along with praying, you've got to "let go and let God".  It's like asking God to help you stop smoking, while you light up or after you smoked a cig.  That won't work.  You are experiencing fantasies, as most of us do.  Tho harmless right now, they can lead you to trouble.  The "sin" is not in being "tempted" but in acting upon the temptation.<br>   Thank God daily for the wonderful husband you have.  He sounds like someone very special.  Make sure and tell him that he is. If your friend needs friends in his life, especially with his father having been in an accident...take your husband along with you when you visit.   And KEEP on praying!|`|tHFY2hg4aa	The problem here is that you don't trust yourself with this guy. And if that is the case, you need to stay away if you want to stay faithful to your husband. If you are doubting your faithfulness, it will only be a matter of time before you go against it.<br>  Try to figure out why you can't keep your mind occupied on your husband. Are things not as spiced up as they used to be?? Maybe the two of you need to talk about ways to make your marriage more interesting, and I am not just talking about in bed. You guys need some stuff in common that you can spend time together doing when you are together.|`|ujtCEmnOaa	Im not really sure what your asking for. If your husband is the man you want then you have to believe in yourself to be strong enough to resist the urge. Everyone has those what if thoughts and since you married young its very normal to wonder. But if your husband is what you say he is then i think you have it made with him and if i were you you i wouldnt do anything to mess it up. Maybe you just feel close to this friend since he is part of your premarriage years and its not wrong to offer him comfort as a friend in light of his dads accident. But you should really sit down with him and get it out in the open perhaps he doesnt feel anything towards you but firendship and that should make it easier for you to stop thinking about him in any other way. I hope this helps...you are the only one who can decide what you want though..noone can really tell you what to do. Good Luck
zzaScg0haa	Your showing you like him by dating him
AA11043457	Women need hugs.  And a woman wants to be able to do some things with her man.  Many men don't like to read and sometimes don't read well.  Others want to read but do it on their own.  <br>  <br>  What my husband and I have started to do is to have once a week as a date night.  We might go to a movie (even cheap dollar one) but that is our night out. You could have dinner out or if you can't afford it, you could make his favorite dinner or a special dessert.  Make that night special.  It is a time for you to get out and enjoy yourself.  If you have kids, work to get a sitter or to exchange babysitting with a friend so they get  night out as well.<br>  <br>  If you don't have a good relationship before you are married, it won't get better afterward. <br>  <br>  If he won't do a date night with you and doesn't meet your needs, then perhaps you should move on and find someone with whom  you are more compatible.<br>  <br>  There are purposes in marriage.  It is to love and honor one another and help take care of one another and to have children.  There are some protections for a woman in marriage. However, when a woman makes more money, she may find fewer benefits.  If a couple are not married then if one gets sick, the family of that person could keep the other "partner" from seeing them or having any say on their treatment.  With marriage you do have a say and have a right to see them in the hospital or wherever.  In marriage you could be responsible for the debts of the other which can be a negative side.  But if you have trouble before marriage, you will really have trouble after marriage.  Work out things now and if they don't work out, get out.  Some men are insensitive and only want someone to meet their needs without meeting the woman's needs.  There is nothing wrong with wanting to be hugged so long as it is not more than a couple times a day.  Morning and night  you should get a hug and a kiss and maybe even a few more on occasion. <br>  <br>  If he works long hours, he may not feel like much affection or going out much so take tht into consideration, but you should have once a week out (not expensive).  I actually took this from my daughter and her husband as they do this. Our church recommends this date night.   I think my son and his wife do that as well, but I am not sure.  I am 65 and been married 17 years now.  I was married before.  I also worked.  If you haven't finished high school or didn't go to college you might want to think about finishing your GED or taking a college class or two. Sometimes  you can do that for free.  Check into it.   If you do have to start over it can help you support yourself.  Eduation is the key to getting ahead.<br>  <br>  Good luck to you. Hugs and kisses to you.|`|O2VfQyOdaa	do u got b.o or smell like ya mum|`|3kBcHJIIaa	First off, I'm sorry you felt deprived of affection when you were a child. That can be a hard thing to deal with. If your boyfriend is being ignorant of your feelings, try telling him that you feel this way. Also, there are other ways to show your affection towards your boyfriend other than being clingy. Simply being with him should show you care about him, or visa verca. Also, if its space he craves, then give him some. Let him have a night with the guys, maybe he'll be a little more excited to see you afterwards. The only other resort would be breaking up. If he's not being good to you, maybe he just isn't worth it. <br>  <br>  Good Luck, and email me for more help if needed!<br>  xoxo.
0wMBIHDxaa	I don't know...cause we can't tell his tone...<br>  <br>  perhaps he is doing it in an endearing way...like "awww"...|`|hko5rrVoaa	Retard.|`|W9B6EJrWaa	Just say, "Back atcha, dumb-azz", and maybe he'll stop.|`|xvxtQwV5aa	Funny! but so not funny!! yeah he's being an a**.

If he's being serious, drop him because he's being mean.|`|24caf12fd1a85e2a135854e193a0cba2aa	He's probably being a jerk because when someone does that it probably means they think your ugly (not saying your ugly or anything just telling you what it usually means)|`|KfKr3hUmaa	<a href="http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;_ylt=AlAL6.UP._v1_28TjognT7fsy6IX;_ylv=3?qid=20090222194557AAZK3gw">http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;...</a>|`|Vx9Lvt9Aaa	its called ....being a goof balll...i specialize in it|`|mBSAvRKoaa	i swear to god after reading ur detail then llook @ ur icon MADE ME LAFF SO ******* LOUD LMFAOMDKLfnh90eorklfdih;oaldfk hahaha okai umm...1 u are uglie...2 he is a ****. 3..ummm....he cant talk..4..umm he lieks u?...5..hes dreaming of tapping u.|`|7DOBM5oPaa	Lol my friend did this before to this girl im sorry to say but we mean it as in your face isnt good to look at, at least thats why my friend did it that one time.|`|zO59ezH3aa	Because he's a duce he might like u but dont waste ur time on him|`|4bAZW3F6aa	sounds like the guy is nagging you|`|AA12254690	??? you need to re word your question????|`|QSQV6PJ8aa	hes a *** maybe!?|`|3hLZUvMZaa	lmao<br>  <br>  wtf?|`|ejSCd2Mkaa	I think he may be trying to be cool but in a corny way if you know what I mean.  Like he says "ow" or makes another noise trying to say that like you look so good it hurts or something like that. Like I said, corny but just go with it. I think he's just trying to give you a compliment.|`|02s3iTNBaa	he is an *** whole so move on don't let him mess with you.  Find out his mother's first name(example: Linda) Next time he says it walk up to him and say "Hey Linda....Ooowww! and walk away. His budies might not know what you mean but he will.  Then he will leave you alone.
FVozOguzaa	that she is good at sucking things, lol jk. Well i think its just a habit that she hasn't broken yet. Kinda weird but no one is perfect|`|QoOx93PPaa	Maybe she's been listening to the song "Something in your mouth" by Nickelback too much?<br>  <br>  Though, if she's seriously doing that and it's a natural thing for her, it means something is wrong, obviously.|`|mBSAvRKoaa	either i have issue also cuz that IS HOT. or she is signaling she wants ur thing instead of her thumb. if she put whip cream on her thump and licked it and swallowed.

Nothing to worry about. It's probably pretty cute when she does it if you ask me. Kind of rather naughty looking even. Go along with it man. It's all good.|`|HiRYOKoqaa	She's trying to tell you something.|`|JzTg0hg5aa	dumd?|`|5PcMA84Zaa	Well, Infants are hard-wired to need and enjoy sucking as a separate experience from feeding. In some infants this need is more pronounced than in others. Infants tend to exhibit the sucking behavior most when they are tired, bored, or in need of comfort. It is highly unusual for a woman in her 20's to have carried that habit into adulthood. Her reasons for doing this are probably the same as it was in infancy.|`|hko5rrVoaa	Probably an addiction of hers.|`|W9B6EJrWaa	It says far more about YOU, that you would call it "her dumb".  <br>  <br>  It says you're an idiot and you've got a girlfriend who sucks her own dumb.

kdSuwt8paa	First of all consider this - if you are bored you are undoubtedly boring so not a fun person to be with.   If you don't like sport surely there are clubs you can join.   Volunteer for something.    Read stories to chldren in hospital.    Visit an old peoples home.    Then you might appreciate your life better.    Get out a recipe book and make some cookies to take to school tomorrow.   Read a book.   Tidy your cupboard and sell your spare stuff on ebay.   Anything.    But NEVER admit to being bored.   It reflects badly on you!|`|Kkxq4Tisaa	go outside of your house and meet some new people...<br>  <br>  yeah im still kinda workin on my life...so dont "quote" me lol|`|AA10300538	learn how to play an instrument, read books, join some other club if u hte sports....learn a craft, take AP classes too...read the bible... there is so much u can do....<br>  Go to a school with guys, take extra lessons with guys (that way meeting new pple)...start talking to ur neighbor, or the boy down the street,,,,make new friends.

8vnYq5mPaa	Just talk to her. Dont bring it straight up, just gradually bring it in to the conversation. Try to get her to say how she feels first before you say anything. And then tell her that it made you mad, but dont yell or anything. She will feel bad from this, and in return will want to make it up to you.|`|8SRjELNBaa	grounded? lol what are you 10?|`|84f1d633997f832abb6eb96e376f11daaa	DUDE SOME BULLSHIT RIGHT THERE, I WOULD FKING SOCK HIM IN HIS FKING FACE|`|EMM6wlm2aa	You really should not do anything. Your girlfriend should, since it's obvious she is not being clear enough to this guy in getting the message across.<br>  If your girlfriend doesn't like him as much as she says she doesn't, she should put her foot down and level with the other guy. She needs to make it very clear that no romantic relationship is ever going to happen between them and that she is with you now. Plus, she should give the necklace back. In fact, she never should have accepted it. <br>  If she doesn't do this, she's not as committed to you as you are to her. And if that's the case, dump her and find a better girlfriend.|`|ilzSv9Ltaa	You need to talk to your gf first to make sure she does not like him. Then talk to this guy and don't be mean but just say she is my gf and it is disrespectful for you to do that and see what he says and if he gets smart beat his ***...lol|`|LHhds2tQaa	Dude thats some bull. I would be pissed. Well can you take him lol? Anyways I think it would only be ok if he was gay but from what your saying thats not the case. Tell you girl to give it back saying shes taken.
v1tHjJ3haa	ROTFL !<br>  <br>  Girls only. If you found a guy and he was 3 inches tall, what would you do?<br>  Would you have him paint your toes?    YES and Clip them while he was at it<br>  <br>  Would you step on him? No, he's my foot servant from now on<br>  <br>  Kidnap him? No, he's my servant !<br>  <br>  Would you enslave him? DUH ! :P<br>  <br>  Have him kiss your feet? No, he can lick my toe jam, LOL !<br>  <br>  Have him rub your feet? Rub sugar mamas feet, yup !<br>  <br>  Sit on him? No, he's locked up in a match box....remember ?<br>  <br>  Tattoo him and (where)? No, the needle would kill him, but he can have a bath and play w/my rubber ducky :)<br>  <br>  Make him smell something bad? Only if it looked bad, if I were 2 eat it<br>  <br>  Stuff him in your dirty sock? No, he almost died from smell intoxification, jk.....his in the E.R, critical condition *tear*it was foot rub time<br>  <br>  Have him do Other stuff? (anything you can think of.) funny is good too.<br>      Sing me the song BEN, prepare me food, steal $ on floors, scare away bullies, :D He can fight any bugs that get in my way and have him teach me how to surf|`|9DtJeAUKaa	lmao<br>  I'd make him cool little clothes & get him an RC Hummer car & we'd wreak havoc in the neighborhood streets. lol  And he could hide in my hair behind my ear & whisper funny stuff to say to ppl. And well...when he whispers in my ear, I may just melt cuz I have a thing for that, like that. ;)<br>  Get him Barbie accessories that would be neutral, like a pool & house. Or he could just use the bathtub & it'd be like a lake to him. lol|`|4DGWcaFLaa	To be perfectly honest, I would probably stare at his smallness for a little while and then forget about him and keep on walking, 'cause I wouldn't really care. He's just a extremely tiny person.<br>  <br>  But that is boring for a story. So I guess maybe be surprised, talk to him and try to befriend him? Perhaps take him to some special place?<br>  <br>  Good luck with your story!|`|NOhaRLNFaa	I'd be like, Awww! what a cute little man! and pick him up and carry him around everywhere and keep him safe.<br>  LOL! what would he wear?? I'd have to go to Walmart and buy him little bitty boy dolly clothes...<br>  my gosh.<br>  <br>  *smile4me* :)|`|6Nj5VZQ8aa	I would keep him in my pocket and make him do my errands in school.|`|F3KkB4GWaa	I would keep him in a shoebox and not tell anyone about him and make him listen to me tell him about my day every night lol|`|tMJITxk7aa	Why, many of those options sound rather cruel, no?<br>  I'd probably converse with him for quite awhile, ask him some questions. He sounds fascinating.|`|T6Dgmxmoaa	I would shove him in a very special place.|`|QoOx93PPaa	I'd call the people who do world records; he'd be the world record shortest man ever.|`|i953FFZKaa	keep him forever and let no one take him away<br>  he'll be my little man<br>  the one n only!|`|BiIdiINJaa	i'd be like okaaaaaaaaaay and walk away|`|H7UphlLCaa	AWW i'd make him a home in my portable little hermit crab cage, and carry him around with me... dress him in teeny doll clothes.. give him baths in the barbie bath tub..|`|JwORUoByaa	I would probablly think I was dreaming or coming down with some mental illness, if he didnt go away after persuading myself that I was awake, I would run out of the room and lock him in. Im terribly afraid of spiders and creepy crawlers, and something small... well... it could be a threat. So, I would grab a bottle of bug spray and warn him to go away. Maybe if he told me he was nice I would think about letting him leave in peace. Most likely I might call my sister in to examine and make sure I wasnt crazy. <br>  <br>  Now, if this little guy had wings....his life would be over in less than 30 seconds....|`|D5CVoI7Yaa	hahahaha<br>  some of these people makeme laugh.. lol..

ac258ba4f1436e3dfef31f6f3ab3f0c8aa	I would put him in a pickle jar and make my friends pay to see him perform the love song from "Thumbelina"!<br>  <br>  "I will be your wiiiiiings, I will be your oooooonly love..."|`|13bb52566ab17616d45ffcb87e7e341baa	Nothing.

But otherwise go home and wonder over and over again how things on this planet and elsewhere work|`|YvJdkSNaaa	I would let him live in the barbie dream house.<br>  <br>  <br>  On a side note, I think "Sounds Painful"'s answer should win.|`|1fZ4OWzXaa	i wish i was three inches tall=)|`|kNLi16C6aa	I would make him walk around the house looking for all the small change I dropped. <br>  And help me clean under the lounge and bed. <br>  <br>  <br>  Oh, and I dropped a chip in my new car...my hands aren't small enough to remove this rouge chip...he would be useful for that too. its been there awhile now, and I don't want it to grow mould.<br>  <br>  Um, if he's evil, I would use him to plug the sink. Or be my personal front door opener. <br>  <br>  Oh, back scratcher, that would be nifty....<br>  But I do like your idea of him paint my toes!!!|`|IvMPh09baa	i would use him as the garden gnome for my front yard.|`|Qu7GIg6Haa	Hopefully, I would not mistake him for a rock.

But to answer your question the BLOND chic is right just don't download and make sure you have up to date virus protection and you should be okay i been watching tons of porn for years and never got a virus|`|ac258ba4f1436e3dfef31f6f3ab3f0c8aa	Yes.  Porn sites are #1 for viruses.  THAT is why you should NEVER go to ANY porn site that isn't a major, AUTHENTIC brand.<br>  <br>  playboy.com<br>  hustler.com<br>  <br>  Those two are the only sites that are guaranteed to be safe.|`|6b7eeb4f41fa6f871211ccd21d079e24aa	not sure.|`|4POGapREaa	Yes, you can.  Well known & more trusted sites are usually okay like youporn, etc. but I got a virus just from looking up lyrics to a song once so that's why you should always have a really good antivirus software installed.  That stupid lyric search had me shut down for weeks.  You never know when it's going to happen.|`|wSeOxs7Jaa	If you have good anti-virus software and are just watching videos and not downloading anything it shouldn't be a problem.

If people see that you are embarrassed or that this is something that they can use to get under your skin, then you will never live it down.. just roll with the punches because it is inevitable that in the coming weeks someone else will do something embarrassing and your oops moment will become as forgotten as yesterdays news...|`|aaCMNSB2aa	They will forget on there own. Just don't attract to much attention to yourself and the whole thing will blow over. If you like, you can bring a woppy cushion and let it fall "accidentally" out of your bag in front of the guy you like. Maybe he'll believe it was that. Otherwise, if he's too immature to realize everyone farts then you should let him go anyway.<br>  <br>  --Good luck, CutieNiki|`|YbSsCVRRaa	every one will make mistakes and it is to be rectified by not repeating and to be simple. as you your self know that this is wrong and you have admitted boldly and this it self shows that your are conscious. you can be a perfect human being by acting to your consciousness.|`|AA10436868	everybody farts, it's natural, and if you did not fart, you would blow up...well, you might.<br>    do not worry about it, just laugh about it and go on with your life.

Then you better stay at the job you have right now and make the best of things, and don't worry about how you appear to others no matter what they say, just keep on doing your thing and hold your head up with pride because you didn't change yourself to please others and you can be sure other people are going to notice this and admire you for it....<br>  <br>  Best of luck, I hope it works out for you :)<br>  <br>  -Moose|`|ciK5J2MNaa	I think this is a terrible idea.

I don't know what the future holds for me and her, but I am willing to find out. She knows who she is, meow baby.|`|53aeaab718309a313fe3a1b19bd7c05aaa	Love is a lottery. But sould we speak of love or of loves for love can take different shapes.There is love at first sight that might end as a nightmare. There is true love that evolved into tenderness as years pass. There is burning passion that leaves the lovers in total ruin. There is the love from children and the one we bear to our forbearers.<br>  It is not easy to have all these meet at once at the same time.<br>  There are concessions to be made on both parts. <br>  But, yes, I do think I am loved having someone by my side who does his best to fulfill my needs and a dear child that would do all she can to see me happy.<br>  Mother's Day is coming son and they are preparing something big for me to show how much they love me.<br>  I wish you would some day find a true one ready to make you happy all life long.
kdFphW30aa	This is definitely a tricky one I however would not add him to facebook unless you  really wanted to know his name also I would suggest meeting with him to get coffee or play tennis or whatever to hang out is my plan. Another way is to be cool with his friends and ask them about him.|`|gdwWhZGRaa	start your convo on facebook & then work up to talking in person|`|4861f9e17bcef08d8f5e36f917de504eaa	your own instinct is your best guide!|`|ROVExbzFaa	You can talk 2 him on facebook or u can find him walking around...aproch him and say...hey im (name) and ive seen you around schoolschool and wanted to get to no u...try 2 say something like that...it worked 4 me and now im great friends with this girl in my school...lol goodluck
y0zxk79Maa	I know what you mean! lol Distance yourself from the friends you already have (they will get the idea sooner or later that you are pushing them away) and then just make new friends the way you met them. I am trying the same thing out right now and it is working for me. I am in college, I am joining a sorority without my friends so I can meet new people. Try to meet new people. Join a group of your interest. Dont just expect friends to fall out the sky, if you are friendly maybe you can meet some better people|`|eNfTWtDHaa	This is nothing new, but just be yourself!
AA11043457	when ou found him crying and saying you killed him, you should have told him -  "We're just friends.  That is what you wanted.  That means tht I can see other people and you can see other people too.  What did you think it owuld mean when  you wanted to be just friends?"  <br>  <br>  But I think you would be a lot better off to move on.  You need to encourage him and perhaps his family to get him some help. He needs to see a psychologist so he can talk out his feelings and get some help.  People who are depressed are not just a little down, it is a chemical imbalance in their brain and they  often need  medication to help that imbalance.  So encourage him to get help.<br>  <br>  But you are going to be sucked into an emotional roller coaster with this man or boy.  He will always see everything negative and will pull you down whether he wants to or not.  He will never take responsibility for his own actions; it will always be someone else's fault. You can see that now. He broke up with you and wanted to be friends but when you see someone esle, then it is your fault, not his.  He was the one who wanted to be just friends, well, then that is what he has.  And it is now in your advantage as  you need to move on with your life.  You need to tell him that he wanted to be just friends and that is what you are now.  So he needs to see others and you do as well.  And then move on.<br>  <br>  If he doesn't get help, he could be more controlling and dangerous to you.  I hope you have discussed some of this with your parents so they are aware of it.<br>  <br>  Good luck to you.  You might actually want to talk to a counselor at school (or better a psychologist) who can help you cope with this situation and decide what you need to do with life.  They can help you as someone who is dealing with someone suffering from depression.  It affects freinds and familes to live with someone who is depressed.  it sort of catches.  <br>  <br>  Good luck to you.|`|nQghiEWgaa	you need to talk to this kid & see what's really on his mind......and ditch th "male friend" if you still love anthony then your fine just being his friend|`|qtoylDVnaa	Looks like he wants to be more then just friends with you. I guess you better figure out where you want this relationship to go and be honest. Relationships can be so utterly difficult.|`|xWUqzPOWaa	tell him that your world is not just you and him. introduce him to other girls and encourage him to date other girls.|`|bhh5RPYBaa	it sounds to me like he cant handle just being your friend. it was too hard to be with you but he doesnt wanna be without you either. i think you need to talk to him and say that if you guys are gonna be just friends then he needs to treat you like thats what you are and he needs to get used to seeing you with other people. but if it bothers him that much then it seems like he cant let you go. idk how you feel about him as a friend or more. but friends dont try to make you feel like **** just because you did something they didnt like. its your life and you need to live it according to what makes you happy, not this guy. he should be happy for you instead of grilling you about your decisions.
MPfj42xDaa	My advice, she shouldn't quit, not now anyway. I promise you your moms going to feel a lot worse sitting around the house all day watching movies and answering questions on yahoo answers. A friend of mine quit his job and has been out of work for months, it really eats you up knowing you can't provide for your family. A lot of people would kill for her job, regardless of the working conditions. You should both be grateful you're not living on the streets. <br>  <br>  Better working a job you hate than standing in line for 3 hours waiting for an interview.  <br>  <br>  I hope everything works out for you and you're mom.|`|x2l1sK5waa	don't quit. why dont ur mum try to 'attack' that mean lady in another way? if she's yelling or insulting, tell him nicely but firm that sshe's not up for any of the nonsense. remember the 'eye for an eye'? i dont think that works. <br>  <br>  when the mean lady saw ur mom is doing better than before despite of her insults etc, she'll be depressed. hahaha.. sometimes, pple just don't like other person to have a good time. be strong<br>  <br>  ask her to take some days off and chill out. only then she will be ready for a new start and u should support her.|`|3lPL6pVBaa	What I always tell people is pay attention to the people who love you.  Don't pay any attention to the people who -don't- love you.  <br>  <br>  It sounds as though the co-worker doesn't love your mother at all.  So your mom should just ignore her completely.  <br>  <br>  In fact, the co-worker sounds like a crazy person.  Be nice to crazy people.  They're crazy.  They can't help it. :)  Right?  <br>  <br>  Of -course- the co-workers behavior is horrible.  You've convinced me.  That's why your mom shouldn't pay any attention to anything she says.  <br>  <br>  As they say on the Internet: Ignore the haters.  Giving the haters your attention . . . is giving the haters much, much more than they deserve.  <br>  <br>  Your attention and your thoughts are precious.  Keep them focused on the people you love.
AA10966291	I really think you should cross if off of your list of potentials. If he is rude to you now, he will be rude to you again, regardless if the funny and nice guy shows up in between. It would end up being a hurtful cycle for you. He tainted the possibility for pureness and adoration with harsh words. Sorry, just telling it like it is, I know it's not what you wanted to hear.|`|AA10623936	Does he like you back?<br>  <br>  Honey, if he's rude with you...it is only the beginning...let that negativity go. You don't need a ton of bricks to fall on you to get a hint...do you?<br>  <br>  If he's not rude to you...he will soon be. A person's character traits they reveal willingly in public just shows that there is plenty more where that came from...the icing on a three layer cake!<br>  Hope you understood :)|`|2JiFdZ3Waa	let go... once a guy starts getting rude and hurtful, he cannot stop....|`|z4IdY4FPaa	umm..its not really for us to determine that but just continue being nice with him, he might come around somehow

Ff7mCzlPaa	Cyclothymia is a mild form of bipolar disorder, relative to bipolar II - the patient has a tendency to be depressed-to-normal in mood.  Sometimes a bit of mania can be present.  Just follow your doctor's orders, and if you are on meds, and they are not working, TELL THE DOCTOR.  Doctors really can't read our minds and do not know whether drugs work unless we tell them... just food for thought.<br>  <br>  Worrying about what other people do is not important.  I know that at your age, social life is important.  But worrying over it is not very healthy.  You can tell who your friends are through observation.  These people should be more important than acquaintances or those "friends" who have proven they are not trustworthy or loyal.  You don't have to pay attention to them.. just put them on "ignore"<br>  <br>  If you're having issues with school work, maybe discuss whatever they are with your teachers.<br>  <br>  I hope things work out.. ask for help when you need it.. from your parents, teachers, and even the doc.<br>  <br>  take care and all the best to you

4496c50c17d4a078fe23b6af3c481646aa	If you want her back, you basically are going to have to do the exact opposite of what you want to do.  <br>  <br>  When a woman knows she can have you whenever she wants, and you are always going to be there, then she places very little value on you.  She probably knows that you really want her back, and if you chase after her, she is going to just keep running.  What you need to do is make her chase you.  <br>  <br>  How do you do that?  Easier said than done, I don't know the whole story or what all has happened, but here are some things to start with:<br>  <br>  1) Make yourself scarce---if she calls, don't call back right away, or even if you are home, let the answering machine pick up.  If she asks why you didn't answer tell her you were busy.  <br>  <br>  2) End all conversations first---this shows you have other things to do in life than stay on the phone and talk to her.  Staying on the phone for hours shows that once again, you will always be there for her and makes you immensely less attractive to her.<br>  <br>  3) Don't place such importance on her---she can sense this when she talks to you or sees you, and knows once again, that you'll be there when she decides to come back to you.  Let her know that you are not waiting around for her to figure it out, and you have a life to live---this will start turning the tide in your favor...<br>  <br>  Basically, when you pull away from her, she starts having to chase you, which is exactly what you want.  Women always want what they can't have, and people always value that which is scarce over that which is plentiful(reason why gold is more valuable than copper).  <br>  <br>  Also, check out this site and sign up for their emails---it contains a TON of good info like what I explained above that will really help you in your quest....<br>  <br>  www.doubleyourdating.com<br>  <br>  I know the title sounds like it isn't what you want, but it's all about how to make yourself more attractive to women and the things that most guys do that make themselves less attractive...and I know firsthand that it works, I used a lot of the info myself and with some practice it works like magic...|`|0a2d4668d605dea1020e09efddb93edfaa	Well, you have to know, so call her up and set up a lunch date.  i say lunch because if things are going well you can extend it into the night, but you have to be aggressive about her.  <br>  Pick up where you left off ... don't talk about her stuff abroad .. talk about what she is going to be doing.|`|1189016f23f371991784ec96e5d129cfaa	Have you tried calling her?

69ebdfa872907c9eb5cba61e41e731b8aa	truthfully the wedding isn't that important, I know you might think I am crazy for saying that but all that matters is the love and the union... you can always plan later for a wedding|`|ua61WAvIaa	I think your idea of the botanical garden is worth considering. I was at our botanical gardens (australia) not long ago and there was a wedding there. It was beautiful. The bride had a gorgeous white gown. There was a buffet table and large picnic blankets with garden umbrellas scattered around with cushions on them. One blanket was for all the presents.They had a red carpet down the centre for the ceremony. All the guests brought a plate of food for the table. And a couple of guys were playing spanish guitar while they ate. It was so romantic. <br>  I think last minute is good coz there's less time to be anxious over petty things. Just go with the flow and enjoy yourself. <br>  All the best.|`|PoBIyZ27aa	I'm marrying a Marine this August. We don't know if he's going to be deployed or not and won't find out until a month or 2 before the wedding. Here is what I would suggest: Go ahead and plan the wedding on the condition that all of your vendors are made aware of the circumstances and are willing to refund your deposit should he be deployed. Unless they agree to that, don't sign any contract. Now, if he does get deployed again, just have a small ceremony and have a reception when he comes home. When it all boils down, you still get to marry your man. Oh, and the Botanical Gardens sound like a wonderful place for a wedding! Hope this helped a bit!|`|H9WbaFeNaa	What about a small ceremony and a reception at a nice restaurant afterward.  It wouldn't really need much planning, just a couple of weeks notice at the restaurant and a little bit more notice to your officiant.  <br>  <br>  Sorry you have to plan like that, I can imagine that it's stressful not knowing when your wedding will be.  Good luck|`|36R3v5VBaa	I'm married to a Marine and we got married in November and he deployed in December. The whole point is to be married, just ask for a few close family members and a preacher and in a nice house or community center and do it. If you get married and he has to go just do school and be happy when he gets home. Do it as soon as possible before he has to go back. A Marine wife has the hardest job on the planet just ask any Marine.

Be a gentleman, be yourself, be honest. Tell her you like her company and would like to go out or meet up somewhere maybe with a couple of friends, that can help if your nervous about what to talk about and she will feel more at ease. It will give you a chance to see if you have things in common with less pressure. Good luck.|`|f2cd15de9d7e9df6066112688f2ec270aa	by "link up" do you mean get together with her?  just go up to her and say whats up ... small talk a bit maybe about the dance and then ask her if shes free sometime soon to hang out. you could find a place by your school or in your area maybe to get something to eat one on one and be more personal and she should get the hint. if you think she already likes you then pretty much the balls already in your court. its up to you now to go to her and try and make it work. just be yourself and pay for the meal and then see where it goes from there. good luck|`|f32601d07d278a41ceed92861ee5a0b0aa	She sooo likes you!

xjpeTWXZaa	Do not go out with his brother at all costs!!!!!!!!! That's just wrong. Imagine how awkward it would be.

(if you want help.) im sure this probably will work. then again... im only 13.|`|AA10184262	I see it this way. You only went out with this guy (the first one) once right? If it's nothing too serious, then I don't see the problem. Actually, funny enough, my mother met my father because she dated my Uncle! Stuff like this happens. Now if you've been with him a while, then your heading into tricky territory.|`|AwKbkLcQaa	girl you sound permiscuous! Hey follow your gut feeling...if that doesn't work hit me up!|`|Yk0CqWTpaa	do what you feel is right|`|nI0ntcTkaa	You can't hide your feelings. Odds are even if you dont tell the first guy that you like his brother, you'll stop liking him anyways. I would tell him before it goes any further. Ask him if it would be ok if you went with his brother, and if he says no, then you NEED TO RESPECT THAT! If he says it's ok, then go ahead, but be careful of his feelings. Good luck and i hope this helped!<br>  <br>  PS Ever seen "while you were sleeping" with sandra bullock? Same thing kindof happens, and it's a classic. You should watch it!|`|wmwVMMyQaa	I think it would depend on the guy that you are dating. Chances are that he probably won't like the idea of you breaking up with him to date his brother but if you like his bro. more then you need to be going out with him instead. Just follow your heart, and good luck.

MlNryOcQaa	dont make the mistake alot of dumb men make of having 2 females by there side you dont want to hurt you current girlfriend becuz she loves you but if you get with this other girl and she were to find out you would hurt her more than if you would just tell her the same way you feel now you said this is a long distance relationship she might understand (your current girlfriend) and let you go you never know but dont play with neither girls feelings.

Just because there's not an actually burial doesn't mean that the other things change.|`|2e9950d18e44c9e655f268d694949015aa	If you know the family personally I'd ask, elderly people especially appreciate the thought but really need the money that is spent on flowers, wives with small children also could use money in times like this.  So many want to express their feelings at this time but don't know what to do other than send flowers and/or a card.  If you know the family or know someone that is close to them ask a few questions about "their" needs or desires.  Some have a PO Box to send money to while others make donations to a charity.  You might be surprised at what your $35.00 basket of flowers will buy towards food that is greatly needed with extra people in the home at this time.|`|0b9cf3568acf2a76265a0b5b41ead92faa	You can still send flowers, since I've seen that they set the flowers by their picture at the alter instead of on top of a coffin.

QaaaRYZWaa	First off, Your grammar is terrible.  Second, The way you stated the question made it hard to understand. Third. What is wrong with a culture that reveres family and hard work? Is that a concept that you find foreign?  The way you prattle on about Asians makes you sound like a bigot. Who are you to think that they are ugly and strange?  I find Asians to be friendly and intelligent people . I would rather deal with them than a narrow minded, and uneducated person  like you..|`|AA10228756	OK first of all I'm not sure what you are asking. If you are asking why Asian women marry ugly people, maybe they are just more evolved than you  and can see past the physical stuff. Maybe she kept talking about him because she is proud of him.  Or maybe she kept talking about him hoping you would get the hint and go away!

If the person is easy to talk to and you have a good time together.  Also, if the person can make me laugh...that's very important!  Personality is what keeps you around, but looks are also important.  Being a good guy, gentleman, and keeping your promises is always a good sign.  As for looks...has to be in shape, nice smile, and nice eyes.

I have found many women in the US, from all over the world, including Indians that love to be eatin out of. The best practise before intercourse is "PRACTISE SAFE SEX", not only so she doesn't get pregnant, but also, so you don't get any SURPRISE gifts. Even nice looking, decent, home bodied girls have fun, So, play it safe. Talking about romantic things, flattering her, telling her how much you love her, that is a big plus. Set the scene, if you want it to be special, moonlight or candle light, soft music, a clean freshly smelling ambiance. You get what you put into it.

dPDa4N41aa	okay you have a problem.THIS GUY REALLY LIKES YOU but seeing that he is your friends brother I don't think it would be a good idea to get involved with him,However long the relationship might last, when it is over things will just be awkward.NOT A GOOD IDEA.Keep in mind that guys come and go but your friends are the ones who stick by you come hell or high water.If you do realy like this guy though firstly discuss it with your friend and if there is any weird vibe from her side just forget about it and move on.That is the second unspoken law of friendship...Never date your friends brother or sister....Good luck though|`|Bpp5f1Szaa	I say he totally digs you but he wont admit it! Keep doing what you're doing but get to flirty around him!|`|iOHYADn9aa	it sound like he does|`|AA10333829	hmm... that's a tough one.  honestly, to me i think it's always better if a guy is very open and public about having feelings for you.  for example, if he always keeps you indoors or never or rarely introduces you to his friends.  guys are tremendously unexplainable.  but everyone has different actions.  so i dont know.  but good luck to you.

60727b7a69fa8d5147eadb2d20e17e83aa	i think the answer here is to strike up more of a rappor with her, become more friendly, keep it light, chatty. tell her in your e-mails what you been up to and how things are going, she is bound to reply in the same sort of fashion, that way you will hear her news and deduce if the guy is around even if she doesnt come out and directly tell you, then you decide if and how much further you want to take it, good luck|`|1ebe19195d224570f415e839a361cf87aa	well, it depends on how you know her. Do you guys have a common link such as mutual friends? Maybe you can find out from them.  If you guys have known each other for 2 years, then there are 2 scenarios. Either she has a long-term boyfriend or she's not interested. She could be super-shy, but that's unlikely. You could email her and tell her how you feel, but if you've only spoke a few times, then that might be spooky. This is a tough situation, and I've been there, except I'm a woman. Life is a gamble, I suppose. What have you got to lose?|`|AA12120358	Well, I think you should keep contacting her through the internet. Even you can have a friendly chat with her. At this moment you should not ask any thing directly. You can develop a nice relationship by being a good friend to her. After that there will be time to raise such issues of relationships whether she is still seeing some one or not. So at the right time you will know what you want to know and then you can give her some clues about what you think about her. If she is not seeing any one, you will have the chance of getting her. You just don't have to rush to any thing. You should be patient and see whether you are headed to the right direction or not.<br>  <br>  Good Luck!|`|S7E202g4aa	If all you have is an email address, then your only choice is to either email her or not to email her.  I would email her and ask for her phone number and give her a call and see if you can meet her for coffee (or whatever -- something not too heavy). If she has a boyfriend I'm sure she'll let you know.  Women like and admire self confidence so psych yourself up to be bold and go for it.|`|c4356bb569eb46c553cf2b4f5077ac48aa	Leave her a rather long e-mail telling her that you have such fond memories of her and that you found her to be an amazing woman and wonder if she is still single. Ask her to e-mail you and tell you how she is doing. Indicate that you still have an interest in her and that if she is still available you would enjoy being able to see her.|`|3122ae6f8b98a3cf8f31941e30e7d8deaa	forget her,don t keep her

You may also want to do a blend of songs fading from one to the next depending on the mood of the serires of pictures.  Don't forget that laughter is a great medicine.  Surprise everyone with a serious of goofy pictures and some lively music to go along.  I love a sequence of pictures that starts with "Awwww" goes into laughter and ends in sweet meloncholy.  The Awww pictures would probably be baby pictures.  Good luck with the project!|`|wJrQnJvgaa	yeah...i think that's cool...aww sorry for your brother...hope he rests in peace

We usually look for the best looking people to get along with them.

YPsIljtQaa	get comfortable with yourself. you cant have a relationship or chemistry with anyone until you love yourself. if you are not attracted to women, then you are not a lesbian. be patient, and love yourself.|`|9541af6563ddafa991efa1a961ddd4c8aa	I'm not a lesbian either but I was a late bloomer.  I had little if any chemistry toward men either.  I was a humanitarian.  I think some of us see a bigger picture.  You may be a person who is both left brain (scientific/logical/abstract) and right brain (creative/sensitive).   I could control my emotional states... so I didn't have the need to be married or mated.<br>    Probably you could go to sciconnection.

afc450c272a8e7cbe986f3278a12edf0aa	im not aware of a certain age. I think when you are mature and responsible enough to take care of yourself and can be a monogamous relationship, then that is a good time to settle|`|AA10676836	People do not mature emotionally until 22.

No matter how busy they are they should still acknowledge your existence.|`|7e479db41d20a65bab36a8c80b9449b4aa	Stardust:  ask this person for a favor.  Make it a "pain in the butt" type of favor -- such as helping you move or if you are younger then something that will be really time consuming and kind of annoying to do - like help you clean your parents garage -- then when the "friend" has 73 reasons why they can't help you then you will know they are not your true friend.  A real friend will say "sure" and jump right in even if the chore is a real pain - It is always better to find out that no friendship exists than to waster your time with a phony.

0PS2vX2Paa	Oh I loved this question. My fiancé and I actually met when we were both working for Target in our early university years. I was a checkout girl and he was the department supervisor. We started out becoming friends, having lunch together and just chatting. It turned out that he had a lot in common and actually a couple of mutual friends. We flirted a lot and he often dropped me off at home after work because it was on his way. Soon after that, however, things became a little more obviously serious and the chemistry was undeniable. We started seeing one another casually and then everything just fell into place. Years later, here we are.<br>  The moral of this story is to start as friends, build a relationship and see where it takes you. Flirtation is fun and usually gives you a good idea of how he feels about you… as for not being pretty enough, if that’s his frame of mind then he’s too shallow for a sweet romantic like you.<br>  My advice: take your time and see where it leads you. If it’s not him, you’ll find someone else. There’s more fish in the sea… ;)|`|AA11930576	Dress real cute, smell real good and wear make up then when you get a chance to see him that day walk up to him and say something nice to him, smile then walk away.

xzMUxGpgaa	Hi there, well the first thing I would do is ask her to sit down with you and explain to you how she thinks you have changed and why she thinks you are selfish? Then make sure you LISTEN.<br>  <br>  You said that you don't believe you are selfish or have changed. So if you indeed have, she should be able to point things out to you as to how. She said that you have hurt everyone that loves you, so ask her what you have done to hurt her. Ask her to tell you how you take her for granted. But please, like I said, keep an open mind. Sometimes we don't see the wrong we have in ourselves and it takes a big person to admit when we are wrong. That is why I said, to make sure you listen. <br>  <br>  You have had this friend 6 years and that is a long time. If you really don't want this person out of your life, I think you should go to her for answers. If she only lies and makes up things about you, why would you want to be around her anyways? And if she tells you thinks and you really do admit that she is telling you the truth, it might be hard for you to hear, but then you can work on yourself, for the better. <br>  <br>  I hope that you and she will be able to work through this, as good friends can last a life time. Aunt DeeDee.

She doesnt want to be herself because she is afraid that you wont like who she really is. She likes you. trust me. When a shy girl actually doesnt like a guy, she turns into a more louder person. but give her another try. also, to loosen her up, she'd probably really be flattered if you opened up to her and let her know that you like her. Just tell her the truth, and she'll immediately realize that she has nothing to hide when shes with you.|`|hko5rrVoaa	Nope, it just means she's really shy and doesnt want to embarass herself in case she says something stupid.

442e5f4a3db253f9ae4c7782d74143a1aa	The circumstances. Since you are posting this in the marriage and divorce section, I'm going to focus on divorce. I am tired of spousal support. What the hell is that? I understand it in the case of a woman who has been a housewife for 30 years and has no career or job experience because she has been taking care of her husband. In that case, spousal support or taking part of the goods aquired in the marriage is fine. But I am sick of people trying to get half of everything after an 8 month marriage. I am also tired of guys who are perfectly fit for a job getting spousal support from a working woman who had 3 kids to support. I am tired of the children's needs not being priority.<br>  <br>  The best case I have seen regarding children's support was from a guy who's ex wife tried to get as much as she could, and since her attitude was a warfare one, he ended up having to pay for child support. So he himself goes to his daughter's school to pay, he pays the electric and water bills, he buys clothes for them, and he takes groceries or store cupons to make sure his ex does not spend a dime on herself.|`|kNLi16C6aa	The victim and what they went through should be the main motivation in sentencing a criminal.<br>  <br>  I believe the sentences need to reflect the laws of the time.

She is playin' you! The friends are probably laughing because you cant see that she doesnt like you! She only says she likes you in private to give you false hope. Move on and just keep it on a friend's only level because this chick isnt the one for you if she is ashamed of you!
mzNLfY4Caa	My opinion:<br>  I think you're really cute. I like your style ;] and blue eyes and dark hair KILLS me every time, I go nuts. <br>  <br>  Cutie.|`|dWwIEqEwaa	your not ugly, i acutally think your cute, no lie.

YHwVw2pdaa	I agree with the other answer. A lot of parents don't know how to be parents. They only know what they THINK parents should be doing and I think that is wrong.(hope that made sense) I think being a parent you should know what your kids need, dislike, like, want, etc... I think parents should be more of a friend to their kids instead of a parent. But I dont mean that like always. Sometimes you still need to play the parent card. Just dont overprotect your son. For me, I have seen a lot of parents that are overprotected and their kids always rebel later on.(mostly in high school) Try to be your son's best friend. hope this helps! =]|`|IxvSAhkqaa	hi  how  are  you i  am  pakistani man  from islamabad  i help striving <br>  <br>  people  in  all countries of people     <br>  <br>  <br>  thank  you <br>  <br>  best regurd <br>  <br>  aamir shahzad|`|X6YY0OS6aa	If you are worried about being a good parent..you probably already are one.  One thing that I can tell you helps is being supportive but don't spoil.  Make him work for everything he gets to ensure he picks up a good work ethic.

d0mbMaNxaa	I love it when a guy tells me the truth. Just tell her, that you really enjoy talking to her, and would love to talk to her more often. This will give you an opening to ask for her number. Do not give her some cheesy line, that is just a turn off, especially if you have been able to carry on normal conversations with her for the last three months. High School is tough, do not make it more difficult for yourself by giving her a reason to laugh about you with her friends, and that is exactly what a cheesy line will do. If you tell her the truth when she goes to her friends and tell them what you said they may even encourage her to consider you a nice guy with potential to be a really nice boyfriend.|`|e1fcbf43da1281603ea0215e78e06c94aa	I will tell u a simple and practical way...<br>  <br>  Do u know where she stays?? If so try to get the Code number of the place and u tell her tat U tried to call her on tat number but couldn't reach her...<br>  <br>  To add final touch just put this simple question:  Hey did u changed ur number or what?  Ask her as though ur confirming the number....<br>  <br>  I bet u will get her number for sure and tat too she will tell on her own...|`|8ab49cc759af24e6dc958568fc94731eaa	yu say:<br>  i've lost my phone number, can i borrow yours?|`|31559244b9e5689a518533efb6344fe3aa	you say hi, compliment her and then start a conversation. at the end ask if you could have her phone number. be really polite and charming of course! bon chance|`|57xZxXI8aa	Say  "Hey sexy, how bout givin me your number" and laugh. she will give you her number.|`|hDNqPmvyaa	in a casul convosation just sy hey maybe i can call u sumtimes wat ur # and then give her urs and from tehre ull be good bestz luck|`|80244d5e31df6f90a20ef9fe27d276a5aa	go up to her and ask.  dont forget to act cofident, but not #####.|`|AA10895732	tell her your rich.... thats all thay want..if it dont work ..go get rich and it will .....it worked for me|`|AA11031973	You should be like- "hey sugar can i give you a ring. Your digits please."  <br>  Don't do that- just kidding- but just ask her.<br>  Say that you really enjoy talking to her and would like to talk to her somemore.  Maybe ask for her screen name, myspace, facebook, ect. <br>  <br>  Good luck|`|Gq3L3d6eaa	You go up to her and say "Hi, can I have your phone number?"|`|fiNJ25pcaa	ask if you can use her phone,,then call your cell, itl be in the "recent" or "calls section"..make sure your phone is off, otherwise your in an embarrasing prediciment.|`|i3eJ0IrXaa	Say it like she is dying to go out with you.

2toOSNJpaa	well, you could be really sweet and nice. some girls are really touchy feely, but others aren't that easy to get a hug from.
0c4ab78fe5dc94fbe00e9ce12b23c1eaaa	Just be yourself because if people are going to notice anything, they're going to notice when you're showing off/trying to impress a guy. If he doesn't like you for who you are as a person, then he doesn't deserve you.|`|lYN12Xpjaa	I sorta delt with the very same issue. See I have a crush on this fine *** guy, who has mostly friends that are women. I dunno how many times I've felt stuck on how I could get his attention without being too upfront. I just found a common ground and interest we both had and started talking to him. <br>  Yeah, it's not easy when you have a huge crush on a guy and other women are around, but you have to be confident in yourself that you can win him over.  <br>  For me, like I said I just made small talk with the guy I liked. After awhile of talking to him and getting to know him, I put a spin on a type of hat he often wears. I wore a similar hat with a really cute outfit and not only got his attention, but the biggest smile from him.<br>   Have your chick friends dress you up real cute and go talk to him when you don't see the girl around. Unless she's his girlfriend...she has no buisness knowing why you want to talk to him. She's not the boss of him. <br>   Besides he might not enjoy the attention he's been getting or even like the girl he's getting attention from. If she's really as selfish as you say she is, it probably won't last that long even if they are together. Just go talk to him!!! If he's rude to you, he's not worth your time. <br>  <br>  Be careful...girls can be catty and insecure in jr. high, just be confident and yourself. You never know what might happen. For me, it took some time, but the guy I was originally too shy to talk to because of a crush and women around him, has now become my best friend. <br>  <br>  There ain't nothing to it, but to do it. What do you have to lose???<br>  <br>  Best of luck to you....|`|13rnUMHxaa	Hi, look i think that what you shoud do  it that you have to talk to him and let your fillings out. Tell him you like him. be nice with him and give him some time to think about it.<br>  Good luck.<br>  Pinkgirl.|`|75e506bb68a18b730d37c2a0e853aabcaa	Just know that it's alright to like someone.  It's human nature to find the opposite s x attractive, so don't hide it.  Just get to know him better, and become close friends.  If someone asks why you're suddenly interested, just say you want to get to know him better because he looks like a good person.

DXrUVAThaa	This is a weird problem. But girls do go through all diff. emotional states. Just kinda back off for a day or so and see what happens. She might be going through something personal and is not ready to talk about it yet. Give her some time she will come around. You are a great friend and she knows it. Just let her come to you with what's bothering her inside.|`|JORga0Mlaa	something like that happend to me, i was friends with this person since kindergarten , and then she all of a sudden hated me and started calling me a loser!

Maybe this is the end of your friendship, you'll just have to wait and see.

Avoid looking like a  loser and at the same avoid trying to hard, gain some self confidence. <br>  <br>  Learn to be more social and greet people often, compliment people often. <br>  <br>  Be positive, practice your story telling techniques (they work like a wonder drug).<br>  <br>  Avoid being a low class stereotypes and socialise more. <br>  <br>  Great places to meet friends are school / college, work, bars, through friends, social events ect.<br>  <br>  Self confidence is a big factor, avoid slouching and just socialise more, prove to others that you are fun and entertaining to be around.<br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|67ca5f16c70d9d86cc6e5be00db25445aa	No you're not.

If pple laugh at u, they are laughing not at u, but at themselves coz they are so insecure with themselves they need to find someone else to put down so they can feel better about themselves. Sorry about the rambling....but it hit a nerve.<br>  Everyone is nervous about fitting in and making friends, being famous or popular or whatever (esp if u in high school). Im in college, and that still kinda hounds me... But if u take a moment to look around and actually observe, u will see that a lot of pple arent as happy as they seem to be, and everyone is just as shy as u are. Try it: if u sit infront of a class, or anywhere u feel people may be staring at u- gather the courage to look back...and u will notice no one is really looking at u...coz they are scared u are lookin at them. Its called Spotlight bias in psychology. So, if u take the initiative and talk to someone- u will make a friend- coz that other person is just as scared as u are.<br>  Good luck buddy!<br>  <br>  edit: ps. i agree with everyone else- i dont think u are stupid either, so change ur avatar name...its all part of being confident in who u are. (self fulfilling prophesy- u become what u say u are- so speak/believe in success, and u will have it,.....speak/believe in bad stuff, and bad stuff will happen!)..another schpeil from my psych classes, lol!|`|d9tCS7BPaa	Be more specific.

Making friends can be hard at first but just getting out their and socializing with people is the only way to do it. Find things that you are interested in (for example dancing, gaming, etc.) and put yourself in that setting among others that share the same views. When you go out do not sit back in the corner or blend into the crowd go up to a small group like 1 to 3 people and strike up small conversations about your interest, always leave politics and religion out. Stay calm and cool and just be yourself. Good luck to you and always remember that it is always better to have one great friend then a lot of people you just hang out with.|`|aebCCtfXaa	just be your self....don't worry wait um is it the first day or something???? and remember just like be your self...if they keep laughin its cuz their jeluse or something.. :)|`|pIE3b6rXaa	maybe its because your an A S S!
UAMtRFruaa	Ditto to above. She's right.|`|GRY78ihRaa	Remember, if you just started at the hospice, you are a stranger to those dear and fragile people.  Start out slowly, letting them get used to seeing you around. Introduce yourself, always smile, say hello, how are you to everyone you encounter everyday.  Just a smile and an 'how are you today?' can mean so very much to a person who is ill or who is just having a not so good day.  Be yourself, be friendly and courteous at all times and then the proper things to say to each individual will become second nature to you.  Sometimes people this ill do not feel like talking, but they may very much enjoy listening, to you reading to them or singing for them (if that is something you enjoy doing), maybe offering to comb/brush their hair for them, offer to bring items to them (ex.: item from bedside table to the chair they are sitting in, etc.). Offers of assistance are rarely turned down. Sometimes, just sitting quietly with a person is all that is required to make that person comfortable and content.<br>  This is a wonderful thing you are doing for these patients.  Thank you for caring about these precious people.  Good luck and God Bless.

That way when he does get a job then you can congratulate him and be there for him to help him out and give him someone to talk to. Support is what he needs.

But hey, you're young and so is he. He needs to start taking care of his own sh it and if he really loves you and wants to be with you, he'd take care of his business and get you back. In the mean time, it doesn't mean you wait for him to get back on his feet (heaven knows, it could take 5 months or 5 years.)|`|2R897ziraa	No i dont think so if you have tried to talk to him about it and he wont and you tried to help by doing anything and he still woundnt try to get a job then you have done a good job by not supporting or helping out someone that is to lazy to work|`|02s3iTNBaa	Heck no!

The main thing you want to take into consideration when planning a date to get married is your own comfort levels with getting married. You both need to make sure that you are comfortable with the time you set. Once that is determined, you may want to look into your wedding plans. If you are planning a larger more complicated wedding day, you want to allow enough time to get everything planned. For a standard wedding many feel a year is the minimum amount of time required to plan but this can definitely change depending on your independent choices and ideas. Just make sure you understand that there is no rush to getting married and each situation is different and calls for different answers.|`|v4ocLWpKaa	awww yay that is so freakin awesome....i cant wait till my bf asks me to marry him he alwasy asks me if i would marry him in the future..im very happy for you ...i say about a yr nhalf so you have lots of time to plan the perfect wedding good luck and congrats!|`|oO28swKYaa	congrats... depends normally on you age if you young (below 25) atleast an year<br>  <br>  prob.. 6 months to over an year|`|7efe69c2d9a0b4d3a0798d71a2f5ea43aa	I would say a year. start planning the guest list followed by the budget.

749f62386066aee890a6c3b73a90ebffaa	mhmm this is a serious relationship....I know this answer is going to sound harsh and in many ways it is but such is life:<br>  Love is such a thing that if you love someone then they must love you back, if they don't love you back you know that they don't love you. I think thats the thing with your bf you love him but you are not getting that love back. If you still love him, wait till he comes to you. When and if he does you know he is loving you back. But if you don't love him or you are not sure let go of him because remember god has made a person that is perfect for us, maybe he wasn't perfect for you, maybe you still have to look. I know, its sounds painful and it is but its the right thing to do because if you don't let go its going to hurt and haunt you forever. And follow your heart cuz it always knows the best for you. <br>  <br>  Good Luck and may god be with you!!!!

After those muscles are used to being stretched, you will start to relax and experience the pleasure of having sex.|`|e38cf4ec514ca9128a9f4fc8d70baf0aaa	It really depends on a lot of different things, First of all, Is your Hymen still intact? many girls rupture the hymen from various things such as sports or tampons etc. Also the size of the mans penis, Lubrication, many things come into play, It usually is a little uncomfortable the first time but if you go slow, and have your partner thrust "gently" it shouldn't be too bad, You need to be sure you are ready to lose your virginity, Once you cross that line there is NO going back. So take your time, Sex CAN wait!|`|AA12084174	yes it does. ohh wow. i wish i had never lost it w/ my x bf last year. i didnt love him though. make sure u r in love with the guy.

But it will be a good type of odd, kindof adventure like and fun if you're ready. If you're asking yourself if it's something your sure about then you're probly not ready and it will be strange. Strange might make you tense and uncomfortable, unable to relax and enjoy. And yes it may be a uncomfortable fit regrdless of being ready or not. But will soon become enjoyable and nice feeling. Make sure you look before you touch. Have to be careful of STD's!!!<br>  Take care of yourself and GOOD LUCK!<br>  VIRGIN IS AWESOME, one time and VIRGIN won't be credited. Remember SAFE SEX!!!

Graduate. Go to the same college he will. Or "accidentally" get a job in his area. AFTER GRADUATION. It's a tough game, waiting, but if you are a minor. It's something you'll have to get used to. Keep your eye on the goal, and be okay if it doesn't work out. Watch the TV series Felicity, and have fun with your friends. You might see that being in the moment, and loving the here and now is more important than the future.|`|05b0ae1abeb9fdade1a6a382644b4c86aa	If you are in the same class.......Keep asking him about studies...Start taking his help.

In other words she likes you. Now..since you said no to her i wouldn't suggest you tell her you were embarrassed to say it in class.(cause i would be embarrassed to)<br>  if you don't know her that well, you could tell her that you wanted to get to know her better.<br>  but if you do know her well, just tell her you wanted to tell her you liked her to her not her friend.|`|8b25c0a321f5e8a1f3614e6d18337781aa	try to be friends with her at first then make ur move....she is better for a friend due to her older age!

9feccab334726c76b98ab8028282090baa	Believe in  yourself.  Start learning to say hi and really listen. Friendship is the beginning. If you all ready have guy friends, then it is not much harder to be friends with a female. Sincerity is a must. Common interests also count. Try  saying something  simple to a female every day.  Such as"How are you?. How is your family?" Did anything cool happen to you this weekend. If you know they are good at something, compliment them. Like art or math.( Hey I really liked that picture you drew and tell them why). Don't be phony though.  Or if someone is having bad day, just tell them you are there if they need someone to talk with. These are just suggestions.Without knowing what kind of people you hang out with; it is hard to be more specific.  Although it is hard, it gradually gets easier. There are always setbacks. Allow for these and don't give up.  It is just like learning something new.   Practice  till you master the  objective.Have the  courage to try. You will be so glad you did.  Some will be bothered. You can't please everyone.   Good luck. Make sure you try to be yourself though. You have to continue these behaviors on  a regular basis to see results.|`|AA11820856	Well if you talk the way that you type I can see your problem|`|d4462c07e857571d7d008297dd6b6c8caa	you should be smarter! social intelligence and an attractive body language are your 1st steps

b6e416af682b2903cb4480e507528c1eaa	This is Christmas, just let it go.  You probably inspired her to do what she is doing by seeing your exhibit.  So enjoy the holiday, and don't let your feelings about this co-worker ruin your holiday spirit.  Besides if your really into this then you should remember the reason for the season and not the opposite.  Because then your doing it for the wrong reason and that will just make you feel worse.  Have you tried to ask this other co-worker if she/he would like to go together and make holiday cookies for your other workers?  Don't let this other co-worker steal your Joy.  I can tell by the way you asked your question that is it already robbing you of precious energy. Do not let this other person occupy space in your mind. It isn't worth it.  Enjoy your cubicle and not worry about what other people think. Tell everybody, even the other co-worker, Merry Christmas and have a nice holiday!|`|AA10898112	Sounds like a little friendly Competition and that is normal. Your Idea was creative and you should accept it as that. The one thing your co-worker can't take away from you is the impression that you left on some of the others at work. I would say do not let it bother you so much and just take it in stride. Just remember that by you doing what you did to decorate your area inspired another to do the same. Imagine if we all took a small idea of kindness in the world and inspired other to grow bigger acts of kindness. The world would be a better place.

If everything you say about this person is true, then they are a jerk. Don't feel bad for "beginning to dislike her." <br>  <br>  Let's face it, there are people in life that you just never get along with. Minimize your contact with this person, and keep everything to a professional level. Most importantly, stay secure about who you are. If you prefer to celebrate Christmas modestly, that's okay! Finally, this is a contest, so it only makes sense that someone would try to outdo you. If they didn't then they weren't taking the contest seriously. The fact that the person doing it gets on your nerves could just be an unfortunate coincidence.|`|89f7d60a12351a95b748818d03f8be2baa	maybe you should ask her if she is doing this for a reason and tell her to stop it or just do your thing and don't worry what she's doing     better yet wait until it almost time for christmas and OUT DO HER this time get even, when she won't have any time to redo hers

Think about what would make a good friend... maybe qualities like always being there for you, not getting angry over small things, cheering you up when you're sad, being honest... the list goes on and on.  Make your own list.  And then try to be that person on your list.  Take note of your flaws and try to improve them.  For example, I tend to lose my temper sometimes and say things I don't mean, so I need to work on holding my tongue until I think about what I'm saying.  But whatever you do, don't pretend to be someone you're not.  A good friend will like you for YOU.  Pretending you're someone you're not only leads to hardship and hurt later.  Eventually, someone will notice the type of person you are and want to get to know you better, and you'll have a good friend.<br>  <br>  Good luck and best wishes!<br>  <br>  ~Maethoriel|`|AA11295296	being honest and faithful,and sharing|`|e875334f00b78c3a1d05121e77f9c1e8aa	Act friendly, and be EXTREMELY nice to people andalways invite them to do things!

8209ca7c96d7e71e3db7ce82bf38dd14aa	There is a lot you can do to impress a girl on the first date and a lot of times it depends on the girl. if it is an actual first date, make it traditional. Bring flowers, dress nice. listen to what she has to say. If she seems at all shy, spark up some conversation and ask some questions to make her feel more comfortable. oh. make sure you show up on time. make sure you are able to pay. most of this already should be enough grounds for impressing but if you want to go beyond... remember, a first date is an interview for a second date :)  just make her feel important. make her WANT that second date. hope this helps! and good luck!|`|bc3250da38d3ae59e39ad40884112b81aa	First is first, flowers are traditionally given to a lady on a first date and are always appreciated. All in all what makes for the best impression is good conversation and a connection which you can't plan for. What you can do is dress to impress, make her feel lucky to be with you, not only that, when you dress nice you generally feel good about yourself and can carry confidence which is an attractive trait. Dinner at a nice restaurant is a good setting for a first date because it allows the both of you to get to know one another. Goodluck!
f765b2a844f87392be0d9e50cfb38874aa	Sad to say that most guys around that age don't want to be with a young lady with a child because it breaks into their chilling time with there friends. They also don't want the responsibilities of dealing with a child that's not theres. Most guys these days don't even want to own up to the responsibilities of dealing with their own kids.<br>  <br>  I wouldn't have a problem with dating a lady with kids at all, I've done it already. I don't see it as weird, I see it as a chance to help raise a child so you know that he/she has all the positive influences to grow up and prosper into a respectable adult in our ever changing world. <br>  <br>  In closing. The little bundle of joy comes along as a package, accept it or leave it. good luck in your search.<br>  <br>  Diabl? @};-|`|6197d1b3b641ee97ed9280312bf08fffaa	I dont think its wierd, if you care about the person your dating whats the big deal.

At 17, yea some dudes will probably be scared off...but don't worry about it...the right guy will come along. Besides...with a ten month old you should be more concerned with raising the child than whether you'll date or not...|`|33bfcd90b8c8bd688850310d6834e999aa	I dated a mommy for the first time last summer. I had never done it before and I didn't have a problem with her having a child. The child seemed fine around me and had lots of fun. I think however she didn't seem to realize that I don't have any experience dating someone with kids so she took a few things harshly.<br>  <br>  Have some patience with a guy that is willing to try. He not only has to deal with you now, he has to get approval of how he treats your child. It's a little nerve racking.|`|c36b4bf801d58e84b13eb11dc92041f7aa	I would definitely date a girl with a kid, so long as she took care of her kid.  Seeing someone care for their child is a great thing, and I would have no problem at all dating someone like that.
AA10744296	I know it's frustrating, but look at it from this perspective <grin>...<br>  She adores you and wants to emulate you as much as she can.<br>  <br>  In the interim, have you discussed your feelings with her, or with a parent, or all of you sitting down together.  At 12, she should know how much she appreciates her privacy, and might understand that you feel the same way.<br>  <br>  You're in a difficult position to enforce your desires, no matter how reasonable they might be.  But your parent(s) should certainly step in when you and your sis cannot work out something that resolves the critical situation....  Good luck!|`|2b8f545ee228e1ac6a4718ff1d725681aa	trade her in|`|d55b78c459d295c355c1e04546af4774aa	but a lock on your door to where you have the ONLY key|`|6db675de226ac878eccfaa6e72d0ccddaa	Grew up with two younger sisters.<br>  Get used to it.<br>  After I got an apartment, my sister came in to borrow some shoes, while I was sleeping.<br>  She couldn't decide so toke a box, and left me with out a pair to leave the apartment.<br>  We still laugh about it, today.<br>  The first pair of socks, I used from buy to wore out, was an event.  My husband thought I was nuts, but he was an only child.<br>  These days will be the days you will laugh about and tease her about when your older.|`|AA12246327	Instead of you letting it drive you crazy it should make you feel good cause your sister looks up to you.  She thinks you are so cool that she wants to be just like you.  She could be doing far worse that would really drive you crazy but she admires things about you and she wants to be just like you.|`|d8f075268d9fd86ba7314c7a4596a5adaa	It sounds like your little sister idolizes you and just wants to be like you because you are "perfect" in her eyes. My little sister was the same way and I would get so annoyed. I lost her 1999 when she was 40 years old. We were best friends but even at 40, she was still trying to emulate me. I'd give anything to have her still with me. So, just be patient with your little sister and she'll grow up to be a better person because she had such a great role model - meaning YOU. :-)|`|76JKcbApaa	if you're the big sister act like it don't allow her to stay all in your space like that but at the same time you need to spend time with her and do some girl stuff with her and maybe when you want some privacy she'll give it to you respectfully|`|7f4b5e8db4820204105086a70f805924aa	This is  why i use to do to it my sister because i was the youngest  because i thought she had the coolest stuff and she was so pretty than i , she got to go on date and do and all  this cool things , So i wanted to be just like her a big girl . now i have my own daughter two youngest and one younger daughter and she does it to them too them the youngest only have one more year before they go to college in another states, The youngest daughter is just copying her sisters because she wants to be a big girl like them, How my oldest daughter deal with it ,is love her anyways she wont be in this stage very long and so they just make time for her once week to make her feel they love her too but she needs to stay out of their things and to respect their stuff<br>   and they just talk to her that sometime big girl need their own time too , she only does it maybe once in while because my daughter make their own clothes so they make the same thing for their little sister but smaller that what works for my daughters i hope this help with your problem|`|tLYBOqrDaa	love every min.of it she loves u and admire u and she looks up to u to her u are cute,cool and cant wait to be like u so enjoy spend a day with her take to the movies or something do girly things with her she will love you even more let her know now im going out with my friends ill be back and dont go in my things but if you do please put them back ok,,,What if something happen to her you will miss her driving you crazy,,so Try Please to enjoy her|`|veTB3EEdaa	You should put a lock on your door.

VSuBo8Nlaa	The best thing you can do is be his closest friend.  Be there for him when he needs it.  Continue to do fun things together.  Let him know that you understand he's not interested in a relationship right now, but that you still like him and want to be able to do things with him without all of the pressure of a relationship.  Tell him you would like to take that next step someday, and be in a relationship with him, but only when he is ready for it.  When he is ready, he will let you know.<br>  <br>  He is probably not interested in being attached at this time because he is worried about his future.  When I was finishing high school and going through college, I wasn't interested in anything too serious either.  I just wanted to get good grades and learn so that once I finished school, I would be able to get a better job and provide for the girl I would someday love.

615e8eb11dddb1c5f0997d3b5dfbe638aa	Ask her if she realizes the magnititude of what you've done for her. Tell her that she could at least thank you for doing such a big favor... I've been in the same boat before. A forced thanks is still better than none.  Hopefully you didn't really inconvenience yourself by doing this!|`|5914d3cce0b8e6170ff830e8b9b2940eaa	Come right out and ask her if she appreciates the job you found for her or not. If her answer is negative, you have your answer why she is not grateful. You could then tell her that you put your own relationships with people you have worked with on the line for her. <br>  Tell her if she doesn't appreciate what you have done and does not like the job, perhaps she would be happier at some other place of employment.<br>  I would also go to the people you had a good relationship and explain to them you did not know how negative she was and you are sorry if she has brought wedges between you and them. <br>  Is there any way for you and others to let her know what is appropriate in your place of employment and what is not. Some people don't stop their negative behavior because no one has ever let them know it is not appropriate.
7b77a35dade4fbb90299f96767952709aa	If this person were truly your friend she would take your wishes and your feelings into consideration. Since she has basically ignored your requests to stop bad-mouthing your family even after you have stated that it was hurting your feelings and the fact that she has done this on more than one occasion makes me think with friends like her you don't need any enemies. No she is not really a friend.|`|839Ihjusaa	no thats nasty. y would sum1 do that!!!!!!!!|`|adb8421524ae504d613274a890ec935daa	You should tell her to shut her mouth because thats just plain rude. talk to someone that knows (me).|`|e223c2bcf2658ef052b9f50017d7fba7aa	If she knows it bothers you, she should respect you and stop.

BJDnEtoaaa	if you've already kissed the person, getting to know them better and hanging out is best.  go to the movies, bowl, go out to dinner, have late-night chats.  after you're confident that you know the person well, see if he/she is ready to move to the next level physically.|`|AA12092430	well usually, its a rule of thumb common for guys that if they dont get any by the third date, they'll dump you, plus, if not into sex but ur guy is, tell him to wait on it, but make sure u make it worth the wait.  um, kiss on first or second date, get more comfortable with him for a while then act as a couple, not much i can say than that|`|AA11372510	ok when your bored dont think about sex
foZWUGGFaa	What is said is often indictative of inner feelings but may not be 100% accurate. Sometimes what they say should not be taken at "face value" and, instead, used as a starting point for a discussion as to what they really mean.

KLLysJ45aa	"You don't realize what you've lost until it's gone."<br>  <br>  Always remember this.  Putting distance between you and your girl is a big NO-NO.  You could do more damage than good that way.  Take this in as a learning experience.  Be glad that before you realized your true feelings for her, she told you how she felt about the relationship.  It saved a lot of heartache between the both of you.  Meaning, if you went to her and told her you found the person (being her) you want to be with for the rest of your life, then she told you that she wasn't feeling you, it would've been akward and embarassing for both parties.<br>  <br>  I agree on the part of giving her space.  Yes, it'll hurt, but you heal, and then move on.  If she wants to be with you, she'll come back.  If not, look for bigger and better for you.  Maybe the next girl will be the right one.|`|62ba6184b6e43bd28caa9b1b690bcb75aa	Why are you here then? Just tell her what's in your heart. Acknowledge that you've been a fool. Humility, honesty, and patience. If things dont work out, it just wasn't meant to be. I know it hurts, but you can't stop living and loving. So, best of luck with your heart's desire.|`|TDlweCzdaa	If both of you had been going through the same situation of not loving each other, then the relationship was not working, u need a break and then maybe meet up agen and see if the relationship will work, or jus chill out and find sum1 new|`|fa824889046b6cdf682451b83ef4d7b9aa	If she means that much to you, let her know. Girls love it when you feel free to express your feelings to them. A true man is cool with expressing himself. It'll let her know you're serious about her and  if you really care about her tell her sincerly. A gift would also be good. But make sure that if you buy her a gift you make it known that your not trying to buy back her love and affection.|`|96af43a6ab3bf4045a9898acf5153bb9aa	You have been together for a while and you probably got a bit commitment phobic - thus you questioned your feelings. To gain her trust back (she also had to have a deep think about the way you were reacting) you are going to have to sit down together, talk and agree to put some distance between you (if you live together agree to move out IF that is what she wants) and then start dating again  as if you have met for the first time- you have to woe each other from the start - at least you now know your true feelings. If it is meant to be you will get together again and commit to each other.
bd035cd5fbed641889c4230d224d60d3aa	Tough one. How far away did she move? In other words is she going to see you together? It's always a bad idea to date a  friends ex if you still want to be friends.

I'm a freshman in hs and I've gone out with a couple guys and haven't had my first kiss because I'm waiting to find the right guy. It should be a special thing, not something just to get over with to look "cool". Who told you it was lame? Something lame would be to brag about it, seriously. People will think you're making it up and it definitley won't be cool. Plus,about  those guys who have asked you out, that's really shallow to not go out with them because they're ugly.

Te he he he he...<br>  Seriously! Sometimes when you focus on it you can't make it happen. Just relax and don't worry about it. Then, POW! when you least expect it, love comes calling. I have seen this happen a lot. Contrary to what some say, the nicest girls do NOT chase down nice guys. Most girls don't even notice "nice guys" AT FIRST. They likely will notice the more aggressive "bad boys". Those fellas tends to lose out in the end as girls mature and start thinking about more solid relationships, security and the future. "NICE GUYS" do not finish last in that arena!<br>  Keep being yourself, a nice guy, and take your time. Try approaching a few. You will be surprised what a bit of boldness will do.

7uBoxYedaa	Well if you still like him he must not of said anything that bad, because if he said something really bad and you still liked him you would be dumb and I don't think you are dumb. Something I have learned is once you have broken up with somebody you only remember the good things about that person (for the most part) but once you get back together those things that made you want to break up in the first place are still there, so theres a huge possibility that getting back together is a complete waste of time. There are too many people to waste your time with a loser. Good Luck!|`|7UMpSpGcaa	hello katie you shouldnt go out with him any more because you dont deserve to be called bad names katie|`|c0dd28e337acd6c05e7bf0634abd5923aa	Well, write on a piece of papper why and should go out with him, then write down why not to go out with him, why why dont you want to go out with him, trust me it works.|`|zydpKBq1aa	Ya go out with him, give the poor guy a chance.

They act different in bed...eg: my husband used to be very gentle  when intimate, but all of a sudden started being more aggressive and forward. They spend a lot of time away from home and usually use working late as an excuse. You may smell someone else's perfume on the passenger seatbelt of his car. Omg the list just goes on...<br>  On the other hand if u are just wondering if a guy is in a relationship without cheating...then they may be distracted a lot, i guess often thinking about being with the person...they may get and make a lot of phone calls and text messages and get a bit cranky if they don't hear from the person they are waiting on to call....<br>  Hope that can help...Good luck|`|AA12174255	U can tell by the way he treats you.

Heck, there are a million attractive people each of us might fantasize about, but anyone who loves you will respect your sensitivity and not go out of their way to make you feel inadequate.  If they truly love you, they will focus on you as if no other woman exists. (Just to set the record straight, the guy might actually notice that fox he'd like to, errr..., but to show his love to you he won't acknowledge her at all!)<br>  <br>  Besides that, it's little things, like him learning and remembering your birthday, favorite foods, movie tastes, etc.  Plus a willingness to compromise.  Men hardly (I should know!) ever want to compromise on much because it's a macho thing, not to say that they DON'T compromise, just don't WANT to!  So when that man in your life does, it's a sign he is putting "US" before "ME".  <br>  <br>  Another way he shows his love is that he will stand up to public criticism of you, even at his own expense.  Then, if he is chivalrous (I do NOT mean just being on his best behavior on a first date) he will pamper you some, maybe by asking you what you'd prefer to eat when you guys go out to dinner, the occasional flowers or maybe opening the car door (yes, we guys KNOW that you gals are perfectly capable of opening your own doors!), or something like that.  Then MAYBE, just maybe, during baseball season if you hate baseball he will only watch 3 games a week instead of every day!<br>  <br>  Other than that, if he flosses and uses deodorant, it's a lock!!!|`|MFoVZETRaa	Well he could surprise you and take you out for a romantic date for no occasion or the way he looks or when al he wants to do is kiss you, depends.

If you're friend needs you to watch her boyfriend like a dog then their relationship obviously isnt very strong. If you're friend cant trust her boyfriend then they shouldn't be going out. She cant ask you to babysit her boyfriend everytime she's not there! Also, try not to get into the middle of things, dont agree to babysit her bf. Let her make her own desicions.

59db026edfa23a5b830e73014abde50eaa	I definitely think that your b/f going away with his friend had something to do with the decision of wanting to see other people. Another factor may be age. How old is he? Have the two of you ever discussed where you both want to be by a certain age? Since you've been in the relationship for over a year, I think your commitment and love for each other is something to think about. Do you really love each other or are you just together to have someone? What attracts you to each other? Has he ever given you reasons not to trust him? It seems like he may be easily influenced by his friends. Your b/f sounds confused. It seems like he may be afraid of losing you. What kind of relationship would the two of you have if you weren't dating? Would it be awkward to be around each other? Maybe you b/f's friend is jealous that you're taking time away from the two of them being together and that's why that went so far away. His friend might have wanted to make sure there was no way that you could just pop in. Ask your b/f why he's not sure things will work out and don't just settle for "I don't know." Maybe he needs a different atmosphere and wants to move, but is afraid of what may happen with your relationship and his friend's. Maybe he feels stuck in the middle because it sounds like your b/f's friend and you don't really get along and your b/f doesn't want to upset either one of you.  Really think about your age gap (does it cause unnecessary conflicts?). And really think about what brought the two of you together and why you would want to stay together. These things should be concrete (ex. you're supportive of each other, you're always there to help each other out, you're both trustworthy and loyal and so on). I hope this has helped. Good luck.|`|V6LHOK55aa	theres another girl!!!!!   hey im single in yukon|`|ekY1msDXaa	Be careful with how you handle the whole " friend" situation, guys are very loyal to their freinds and what they say about you, even if it's not true and they don't know whats going on, they droal over every word they say. Second, try and work it out, but make sure your not changing yourself or your standards by doing so. Always hope for the best but expect the worst.|`|fe1d39298167488bffc507ca9f4225bcaa	if he can't man up and tell you his true feelings kick him to the side take him up on his offer and see other people.<br>  what time should i pick you up?|`|a7806b35229d65df79a5c5cade6412c7aa	He probably got some action on his trip and wants more freedom to do so at will.

0782289f0c05ead01cc3eab5d2f60925aa	This will only happen through the man showing his love to his wife and by the wife seeing to it that she respects her man. When a man loves his wife he naturally shows her respect yet a woman loves instinctively and if she recieves his love she automatically shows her love back.  However because women are inclined to be a little over emotional at time, they tend to loose respect for their men easily, hence the reason the bible says women must SEE to it that they respect their husbands. It takes commitment and accountability and making the right choices too by overriding the feelings and emotions and using god old common sense.  Sadly this is the area where most marriages fall down - right here!  A crazy cycle develops in most marriages where partners do not respond to each other correctly. She shows no respect, he steps back, goes into his cave and does not feel like behaving lovingly towards her, because she is critical, bitchy , nasty and vindictive, bad-mouthing him to all and sundry, going through all his stuff to FIND CLUES of betrayal, and what we have here is a typical 5pm sitcom full of controlling women and pathetic husbands who mount to nothing, disrespected by the entire family. The women RULE!  Not good.  When you find yourself in this mess, you can but only stop, look and listen to Ephesians 5:33.  You choose to start respecting him again and slowly the crazy cycle slows down.  it will take time to win his confidence again but it will work. LOVE CONQUERS ALL! Men want to be respected more than they need to be loved. But respect them, we must!!! Stand together after all thats why you married in the first place!|`|7a66fd2ed9d9f3b7cdb917cf9b78bf0faa	I am on my second marriage (and hopefully my last!) and I have learned that the key to a successful marriage is communication. Also that the path of communication is a two way street. It isn't worth talking if no-one is listening but how can you listen when no-one is talking? Plus, I don't think sex is a huge deal but intimacy is. You may not always feel in the mood for it but there are other ways of making your partner feel loved and wanted.  You should always make time for intimacy. Dr. Helen has spoken!!!!!!
1368ddaea051f5cc917197f59048d9f5aa	Great question... one that should be asked by everyone in our society. here's my top things list:<br>  <br>  1) #1 and the absolute most important-- the greatest gift you can give your daughter is a strong, loving, open and honest relationship between you and your spouse! They must always come first.<br>  2) Model what you expect... if you expect respect, honesty, affection, integrity, spirituality, open expressions of love, etc., then you must model it as you want it to manifest.<br>  3) In addition to modeling what you expect, now begin to teach these things: a) self discipline and responsibility; b) accountability; c) how to think independently and for herself; d) how to have the heart of a servant and leader; e) compassion that is followed by action; f) courage- how to stand up for her beliefs; g) diplomacy and tact. If you are a Christian and or another faith/religion, bring her up "in the ways" of that religion. For me, raising her to believe as I do, in a loving, gentle and compassionate God, is key. Many will disagree and see this is as right winged-fundamentalist rantings and ravings, but it's more about teaching an approach to life that accepts others, forgives, lives a truth that doesn't encroach, isn't narrow and mean spirited, and doesn't alienate or impose on others.<br>  <br>  Finally, I recall telling both of my kids when they were old enough to understand: "i don't need for you to be the smartest kid in your class... don't need for you to be the tallest, or handsomest, or most athletic or even most popular-- what I want is for you to be the most sincere, compassionate, open, honest and loving person around!"|`|jvW3a5GYaa	Bryan M is 100% right!!<br>  It would have been good to start this task from birth, but it's never too late!!

And to have respect for themselves and others.|`|QeWAKW2qaa	All the dicipline in the world, all the instruction, all the education means NOTHING if you do not first show your child how much you love her. This means, no beatings, no screaming at her...love..PURE LOVE is the only thing that will motivate a child to actually do what you want them to do. <br>  <br>  Yes, you do all the things you're supposed to do, i.e. discipline them, educate them, instill values...but it must be built on a loving foundation or you will not be able to influence them when they are older. I can guarantee you this!!!

rpeFoIVUaa	I think it would depend on what the situation is. If he seems untrustworthy still(if that is your issue), then I would say. Drop him! I personally believe girls deserve guys who actually care for them. Too bad this is rare! Any other guys reading this? Maybe some of you will learn something!!!! If you really want to test his trust do this(I know I've posted this a lot tonight, but I think many people need to stop pushing this and wait.) If he's willing to wait for marriage to have sex than he is dependable and completely in Love. That is how you test whether he Loves you. Make it known to him what you stand for if you stand for that. It's the best thing for a relationship. I have been with my fiance for 5 years and getting married in October. I have never had sex with her or anyone else. All of my friends that have had sex with the person they've dated have all been broken up. Even my best friend and her fiance. Trust me on this one. Oh yeah, and train that guy to open your door for you!!!!!!!!!!!! You can find a rare guy! Never settle for second best! You and ALL women deserve THE BEST!!! Not the crap that most guys throw out at you! Don't settle. Oh yeah and by the way. If I haven't helped and it's not a trustworthy issue, I'll let you know I've fought with my fiance before too. People fight, but it depends on the subject. I rarely fight with her now, because I know her soo well. Get to know him better(not physically, because that's the way to kill it and most future relationships). Write a list of qualities you want and never settle until you get every one of the most IMPORTANT qualities!!! my e-mail is scy0846@yahoo.com if you want me to say more. Hope I helped!|`|2742da1f536108f4b01aff4eb523fb36aa	1) start a cold war....let him know he cannot live w/o you<br>  2) forgive and forget, because all men got flaws!!!! and they are created in this way, we cannot expect them to be as high standard as us<br>  <br>  3) go for mediation class, it will help you to control your temper<br>  4) do yoga, it can stimulate your brain, then u will know the best way to handle your boyfrd.<br>  5) find another boyfrd.....|`|WrwgLkt1aa	Maybe you are getting angry at him for stupid reasons but there are reasons you are getting mad at him even if they are stupid and a reason you are getting mad at him for stupid reasons.  One is something he needs to deal with and the other is something you need to deal with.  You reaslize you get angry alot but there must be a reason for all this anger.  It's probably already there and just looking for excuses to come out.  You need to find out what this thing is that is already making you angry and diffuse it.  Of course, if your boyfriend is doing stupid stuff to annoy you he should take care of that but either way you two ned to talk about this problem of yours and discovering the source together.  he is your boyfriend and he probably loves you so open up to him and maybe the two of you together can figure it out.  He needs to know how you feel.  Besides, that just make it up to him afterwards and remind him that even if you get angry at him you still care about him and hope he will remember that and have patience with you.  He's stuck around this long so he probably will be willing to help you with your problems, change a little himself so he doesn't annoy you as much and stick around especially if you make it up to him.  GIve it time but work together and talk together.|`|095b56c04caca5de841c3abc142ed37caa	Stop spazzing out about the small, stupid things and just enjoy spending time with him. If something small is bothering you, just try and forget it or blow it off. If your constantly fighting with him over stupid things, he's going to get sick of you and get rid of you, and Im pretty sure thats not what you want. Spend more time having fun and being happy when your with him than searching for stupid things to fight with him about. Dont waste your time together being unhappy.
ybQaMekMaa	ask questions..<br>  1. Do you need a vacation?<br>  2. Do you want to move-out of this house, to a new house?<br>  3. Is the kids pressure too much handle alone?<br>  4. Are you bored at home?<br>  5. Is there problem which is bothering you? if so, come out with it, i will understand.<br>  6. Are you unhappy with the current Finanace?<br>  7.

Do you want to go to the doctors? or your mother's house or something, I reallly think you can use a break..|`|rpeFoIVUaa	Very tough. I would say how is their communication. Communication is key in a relationship! Tell him to either go to marital counceling or try to initiate it himself. Most woman won't have sex unless the man starts it in most cases. It's how they feel loved. Men should be aggressors and do something about it. If that doesn't work tell him to go to marital counceling. I know many people who have been and it's worked out great. He also needs to communicate his love more. Take her out for a moonlight walk on the beach leading  to a picnic surrounded by flowers and tealights(shaped in a heart). Let him rekindle the flames! Just sweep her off her feet. She how she likes that!|`|cwdit3Pxaa	Does he want sex and she doesn't? Or do they both not want it? For most women, if they are happy and emotionally fulfilled and NOT TIRED, they'll be in the mood. Maybe instead of trying to talk specifically about the problem (ie no sex) he could try and help her in other ways, with the housework or looking after the kids. or letting her sleep in in the morning, so she has more time for herself and to rest etc. This might help fulfil her emotional needs.
Xkc8rhXKaa	if he is being mean then he isnt a friend. but if it is just a little picking or teasing to have fun i would say yes he likes you. he just isnt sure how to flirt or tell you he likes you. but if he is being really mean to you i would say no|`|a22bcfde8b12be81871c863e29105e2daa	you call that chump a FRIEND? just stay away from him.
0y3gHevHaa	Yeah, get him a massage.  Make sure the masseuse is old and fairly resembles his grandfather.  He will love it.|`|AA11326266	Why don't you save the  money on the "couples massage", which can be expensive by the way...Rent a nice hotel room, decorate it with candles, have a couple drinks, and give him a massage yourself. Ooooooh also check this place out...you said you're in Los Angeles right?<br>  <br>  <a href="http://search.cityguide.aol.com/losangeles/entertainment/splash-spa/v-149205" rel="nofollow">http://search.cityguide.aol.com/losangel...</a><br>  <br>  It's a romantic spa/hot tub place....pretty sweet!|`|Pfarz3Woaa	Go down on him bubbles, and complete the job|`|3xUPHf3Jaa	Couples massage? Is this his birthday or yours? Get him something a guy would want, sports tickets.|`|kolDDBL3aa	It really depends on what type of guy he is. If hes an outdoor guy I would recommend canoeing if its in your area. me and my boyfriend go alot and its really fun. or maybe roller skating in the park and a pinic. something you guys can do together. bowling, mini golfing, even just a simple walk and a pinic. the massage is a good idea too but it could get alittle pricey if your not doing it yourself!! good luck!!
Yi3Rv5WAaa	Definitely go and get him a ticket to yours. If he does not go dont worry, just give him some space. He just thinks you are trying to make him like you or something. Try to give him time alone if he is a good friend he will speak to you on his own. Good luck, and definitely go to his performance.|`|IYwmDe7jaa	well I hate to say this, but your friendship probably wont go back to exactly what it was before, I have been here before and I know others who have as well, it does not mean that things wont get easier in time because it can, but that is up to you. You need to talk to him and ask him what is going on and how he feels about it, tell him how you feel that you don't wont this to change your friendship , tell him you would rather be friends than nothing at all, and leave it at that, try and date someone else, and see how he reacts, if nothing than maybe it is best you guys are just friends, I don't think that he was looking for anything at that time. I would go to his show, he did as you as a friend , I think it would make things worse if you did not go, and yes invite him to yours.|`|de6f11f94bba2a71a74c665d254f5582aa	I have the same problem with my guy friend. i wish things could be like they used to. but they cant. things take time. sometimes all you need is an open invitation and maybe taking him to this performance is a good idea. tell him to go, tell him that thought things have changed you would like to remain friends.<br>  <br>  good luck i hope things turn out better than things are for me =]|`|scixzsPFaa	i also have this crush named joe. but i didint tell him i liked him my avil friends did,. well anyway you should jsut be yuorslef and he she be hiself . and yes go to his performance ushould get him, ticket for yo uperformance and if he doesnt come give them to a bff

Do you have clubs or organizations at your school? If you do, join one or a couple and when you meet the people in the clubs just be yourself.<br>  Maybe just start simple conversations in the lunch line or something? I went to a very small private school where everyone knew everyone, so I probably don't have the best advice. (And I'm not exactly the most social myself)|`|5defc32fe9211888bd175d52c67cae6baa	It is hard to be alone. Join a sport or a club there are always other people there. You really need to stand up for yourself and be the real you not some nerd with social problems.|`|AA11400672	relax, take a deep breath, and just imagine everyone is like you and you'll be fine|`|de90058ed57abeb0f761264c4d6eb830aa	no there is not to get a friend. i can be your friend|`|jpQciSeUaa	I think you are still able to make new friends. It's never too late... try to join some clubs or organizations. I'm sure you'll meet lots of people there and/or try talking to some people in your classes. That can help too.
d2XVTG9xaa	Based on her body language, I actually think that she likes you and she's just shy. One of you has to make an effort to really break the ice, and I'm sensing it should be you. If you really really like her like you say you do, then approach her. Be extra-friendly, make it painfully obvious, FLIRT! :) See what happens next. :)|`|rSUh2ytRaa	i would say she likes you but she is probably upset. you know it happened to me too, maybe during the time you were busy and couldnt talk to her she felt she was ignored by you and went through alot, and wondering if you suddenly changed your mind about her, or maybe she has done sth that made you lose your interest,you can never really know a girl, we are damn senstive to details and that causes alot of problems for us, but it's always good if you know this so you wouldnt do anything to your girl even unintentionally. <br>  i suggest just talk to her about different stuffs, be firends, or more than just a classmate. if you have the same writing class then that's your chance find sth about that class and consult her or ask for her idea, make her feel important and wanted, and i bet you will have long lasting eye contact. <br>  good luck|`|AA11945915	It sounds like you are both a little confused. Tell her how you feel. Even if she doesn't feel the same, if you are respectful and sensitive towards her always she will want to be around you. Girls like to be treated with respect and to be listened to. When you talk to her really listen and respond acordingly. The bottom line is your relationship depends on how you treat her- you can sway it either way! Good Luck

a2241d9e0f57b29fa67b98f6ffbf458baa	i think chocloate brown and light green look really good together. maybe a chocolate brown board and make everything stand out by using light colors, like pastels. that means creamy colors. it will look great!!
AA12131791	Only you can know the difference.  I mean you will know when you are in love because that is no doubt in your mind.
0CWe0qm1aa	Get it out of your system - go tell him how you feel and see what he says. You have nothing to lose.|`|7HKKbdZtaa	This breakup is a little confusing.  You say you can't trust him.  This statement is not clear as to why.  Sounds like things were left unresolved.  Perhaps you have stuff to own up to with him.  Having a mature discussion with him might clear the air and then let it go.  If you two were meant to be together then you will.  I would approach him with your thoughts of your role in the breakup and how you have learned from your mistakes.  One caution is enter the discussion without any expectations on his part.  The good news is you will be free from guilt and in a space to move on with your life.
xSoo1JRwaa	be there for her (and let her know you will be), hug/hold her when she cries and don't push her, she seems very vulnerable so don't try anything on her yet, just wait a little, she will come around... or maybe when she is try getting her to cheer up by going to funny movies or bowling or smthng|`|1ia1Aef4aa	Simple ask her out she's vulnerable.|`|96196a444ea23070021630b1488416cbaa	Well, don't stop being there for her. You could tell her that you luv her instead of telling strangers how you feel. Girls luv sensitivety and there's nothing more sensetive then saying I Love You to someone. Fallow your heart, because your heart never lets you down. Oh ya, and tell her "that if that guy doesn't love you then he is stupid  cause how could anyone not love you." Good Luck!!! ^_^|`|IIJMSSTdaa	wow,sounds like the girl is confused her self.<br>   its only a matter of time 4 her 2 see her dilemma.<br>    just be you ,,,,she'll come around if it's right for HER,NOT YOU!!|`|wQZu1vsRaa	let's just say your in the "friend" zone.....in other-words, YOU'RE ******....unless you tell her how you feel|`|AA11931593	Just tell her how you feel, if you can't bring yourself to tell her write her an e-mail/note bearing all. You never know she may feel the same way. :)|`|JEjh8kP0aa	Continue to be there for her.  You'll know when the right time comes along to tell her how you feel.|`|Z0Bt8JeJaa	i think you should first comfort her next time she gets sad about the other guy not liking her and explain to her that there are other guys out there and that maybe she should move on... i know how she must feel... she needs some one else in her life to get her over the other guy so as i said try comforting her and getting her over the other guy and then ask her out|`|a3kcws2Aaa	You should make her feel better and like tell her it'll be okay and stuff.   If you talk to her a lot and stuff and you make her feel better she'll like you more and if you're her type she'll end up liking you more than just a friend.|`|b06dad94228860a331026930f8e72943aa	Take her out. Hang out with her. Make her laugh and whatever you do, kiss her at the end. Show her you like her, you don't have to tell her. If she keeps going on with that other guy thing, she's damaged goods for now and needs time to get over it. Good luck.

6a6086b2996985e57de03e16c5597258aa	You're right - things are doomed - you know the problem (your behaviour) yet refuse to do anything about it.  You want him to change i.e. get more confidence in the relationship.  You are a piece of work and still so self-centered that I doubt you will ever change.  If you want to "show" him how much you love him CHANGE!...get counseling or something.   Good Luck|`|AA11263050	I see a problem here, that I must mention.  You state you are controlling, and act like you can't stop being that way, or that he can't ignore it when you do it.  In other words, your out of control, and asking for advice on how to control a situation you have lost control of.<br>  <br>  You say the relationship is doomed, so, give it up and move on.  Just because you are breaking up, doesn't mean you have to stop loving him, or that you can't keep on being someone to him.  Just accept the fact that you cannot get back what you have lost, and let the situation go the direction that it must go.  You have no control over it.|`|1xywya2laa	I totally feel your pain. I was in a relationship with my childs father for a very long time & really you can't do much except really watch your temper & if you are a christian you need to pray about this. Ask GOD to help you control yourself & not to be controlling of that person. I had to do the same thing only it was after we seperated & honestly it was the best thing I could have done. GOD will do that. But you have help yourself as well. We were seperated for a yr. & although right now we don't live together we are working on our relationship & it was better than when we first started out. I think we needed that time away from each other to clear our heads & see what each others good points were. We did kinda see other people (nothing serious) but we both realized that we wanted to be together despite our problems we had in the PAST. I'm not sure if you can convince him if it's gone that far. You need to lay low & chill out & start praying your butt off. & if you do seperate it doesn't mean that you can't work it out eventually. GOOD LUCK!!!! & I too will pray for you b/c I know when you love somebody so much it can hurt so bad. Sometimes it gets worse b4 it gets better.|`|5c7fe96048cb12bae1dd4b323ecd947baa	Just be honest with him. Short fuse? I doubt it, I think you have a fear that is controlling your actions. Tell him how much the relationship means to yuo and how much he means to you. Don't think something is doomed and you should just give up. You say you're an adult well act like one. Make adult desicions. You need to think what would make him happy. You obviously have concern for him that shows you care. You don't know if you two were meant to be. If it wasn't meant to be it wasn't meant to be but if you want to go out with a bang just treat him good and act like an adult, no blowing up no short fuse no fear. Good luck|`|AA11608315	When you know you are going to blow a fuse walk away and count to ten, breathe do whatever it is to control your temper and maybe you should get some counceling to control your temper. As for your boyfriend write him a letter telling him how you love him, how you appreciate him and dont want to lose him. Also, compliment him tell him how handsome he is its the little things that make a relationship grow and the arguements that tear it apart. LEarn to compromise and get your self in check. Learn to share and commicate or he will leave you|`|wNNZGrJhaa	im not sure if this'll help. but go somewhere where he will feel in control like if he loves a sport take him to where he can play it and ask him to teach u how to ( even if u already knw hw to) and bout ur fuse.... ionno im the same so i need help wit it too
rJqRilYMaa	Sounds to me that she just likes the idea of having a boyfriend. When she is around a group of people she wants her space. But around her close friends she likes to be affectionate to sort of " show off " <br>  <br>  Only you can decide if you should leave her or not. Sounds to me like the relationship isn't going anywhere though.|`|adcd58fae8c4f9db17f2c25a46a5ba62aa	u sould try to talk to her how she really fells about u|`|fxMfn9SWaa	I agree that it sounds like she just wants you to show off to her best friends.<br>  <br>  You should talk to her though and find out what her deal is.|`|xQfenWNWaa	Maybe she has swetty hands.Or she might not know how to kiss?|`|fNw4wJSGaa	Sounds like she's just not comfortable PDA (public displays of affection). <br>  <br>  Does she have a problem being affectionate when your alone? <br>  <br>  I know I don't have problem holding hands or hugging in public, but I don't want someone pawing all over me, and I don't like kissing while someone is watching. I find those to be private and intimate. It could be she feels the same way.<br>  <br>  If it bothers you, you should ask HER instead of her friends. They don't know and you shouldn't involve them in matters that should be private between you and your girl!

ELar1bKRaa	Two things come to mind. One is not so pleasant so dismiss it if you wish.<br>  <br>  Could it be that this sort of behaviour that she is showing gets her rewards? That is - because you know that it is going to cause stress - do you tend to be very attentive to her, at the cost of your freinds and social group? Do you tend to ignore friends that you would have otherwise enjoyed being with? Perhaps females? Do you think that this extreme behaviour could in fact be a tool to control you?<br>  <br>  Or.<br>  <br>  Of course we all have pasts. Some people deal with past issues better than others. If she really is still suffering from some past injustice and everything that you do is still not enough to make her feel secure - then you really must sit down together and talk about getting professional counselling.<br>  <br>  She must be made to see that she is actually going to fulfill her own prophecy if she doesn't start to contain her unreasonable behaviour.<br>  <br>  Your love for her now may not last as long as it would if this gets worse - as well it could. If she is suffering from a complex such as low self esteem or insucurity - she really must, for the sake of this relationship - get help. Try to make her understand that it is an investment in your future together.<br>  <br>  I wish you both the very best of luck.|`|krh0Lzm0aa	but what is the problem?i mean is it jealousy or what?it will take time of course.if you really love her,you should try and try again.

In any relationship trust is paramount. Be it boss/worker, bank/customer, parents/kid, especially in love. If you can't trust, you can't really love. The doubt is always there. You'll find yourself thinking about it when she's just talking. It might sneak into your thoughts when you're kissing her- and you hold your breath. 2 years isn't much when you look at a lifetime wondering about someone.|`|J7mSnQPpaa	Tell her youre hurt and it will take a while for you too heal and to trust her.|`|ZFpziOLNaa	Joseph,<br>  <br>  First of all you have to ask yourself what you feel and what you need.  Then you need to gauge how she feels about you; do you trust her, do you really think that she is indecent?  Then you need to confront her GENTLY with your feelings and see what her response is.  If she gets angry then you learned a valuable lesson and can move on.  If she professes her love for you and wants to make a go of it then you have to set up some ground rules for both of you.  Perhaps she was trying to come clean with you so that you two could start a new chapter in your lives based on trust.  if this is the case (and only you can be the judge of that) then you will have acheived something that few people ever manage.<br>  <br>  Either way you will come out of this alright and should be able to move forward.  Good luck . . .
34f58d193a1c27340e8401a3848c8c53aa	you were right to break up with her.. I read an article that guys will stay in a unhealthy relationship, because they don't want to be lonely, don't want to go through the dating game to find someone else.. if she is talking about suicide, then the best thing that you can do is help her get help.. It's not that hard to commit someone. if someone is talking about suicide, especially if there talking about how they will do it.. They are on the path to taking their own life..|`|AA11269410	I have the same problem also. I always want to be around my bf, but he picks his friends to be with instead, so I think he goes around cheating kinda or being with women also. No, it is not wrong of u to break up with her.  If u r not happy with her, why should u stay with her right?  And also, my bf says it gets old of me thinking those bad things and assume he is doing something with some girl.  No, YOU R RIGHT!!!       Good luck!!!|`|VxTvZ8w6aa	Use your common sense then to settle your problem. Try to patch up things because man is elastic and can be compressed. The way I see it is that you love your girlfriend so much. So try to be her adviser-lover-counsellor-provider.<br>  God will bless you. Good luck|`|WIXz4L5yaa	Your girlfrend is insecure and I'm sorry to say, doesn't love you.  People who truly love one another do not use ultimatims such as death to get the things they want.  If this woman is causing you to change your job, friends, and basically your life, then it is best to let her go.  See if you can have her committed, just for kicks.
AA11352280	I accidentally let a girl know that her bf had cheated on her.  She found out that I was his ex, and asked when we broke up.  When I told her, we both realized that there had been about 5 months of "overlap".<br>  <br>  In my situation, it was completely by mistake.  However, she then told me that they were about to get an apartment together and get engaged, so she really needed to know the extent of our relationship and how bad his dishonesty was.  I felt bad that she could potentially be about to make a life-altering choice completely in the dark, so I told her the facts.<br>  <br>  It turned out to be a bunch of drama that got way out of hand.  I tried to do a good thing, but it didn't go very well.  I wouldn't worry about it too much, if I were you.  It's not really your responsibility, and more often than not, you end up unfairly caught in the middle of a bad situation that you weren't anticipating.

RYoMfoc1aa	Well sounds like this kid is a prick. Im not sure how you can get over him cause everyone is different but i can give you a few suggestions. You could try hanging with other people and find a hobbie that keeps you busy and keeps your mind off the matter. i know its hard but seriously if you find something and do it with people you enjoy you will meybe meet others that make you happy. i suggest surrounding yourself with others that set off a positive vibe. Obviously this kid doesnt have respect for anythng and If you have respect for yourself then  you should really tun the other cheek and find other people and activities, your only 16, get away from those kinds of people!!! Good Luck!!
s5stkYaDaa	Listen to your friend.  You really should move on.  Good luck.|`|AA11348224	Your question has more red flags then a highway repair man.  Suspicion needs to be addressed before a real relationship can be done.  He won't allow you over his house? She answers his phone?  Not to hurt your feelings but unless you need to go over there unannounced and get a nasty surprise maybe you need to rethink your relationship.  Is this what you really want for the next 6 years for you and your daughter?  He lives it up any way he wants  you sit by on the side lines, what's this telling your daughter? Love is not suspicious, its unconditional, not set with limits, not telling you where you can or can not go.  After the first few years you should have had a key to his place happily given by him.  Tell him goodbye and find someone who respects you and will love you they way you deserve to.  Set visitation rights and show him you can do better.<br>  <br>  Good luck.|`|1bbb93fb01e19af781dd2d771fdd791aaa	I truly think that you need to worry about and take care of your child. <br>  If someone wanted to be with you then they would.

0DjdZpyEaa	The story of "Lil' Red Riding Hood" is based on a short story of a young early teen who wears a red hood and whose mother sends her through the forest, by herself, to her Grandmother's house. The story was made to talk about young adulthood. Riding Hood wears red, which symbolizes the coming of her period and thus her maturation. Having her mother send her through the forest, by herself, symbolizes the fact that she is no longer a small child, that it is time for her to be able to delve into the world without the comfort of her protective bubble. The "Big Bad Wolf" symbolizes all the malevolent upcomings that she would have to face on her own. The forest that she is sent through represents the world she lives in; large, vast, unknowing of things to come, a place full of mystery and danger, a world full of opportunities and a world full of tests. Tests that she would have to face and learn to strive through. Getting to her grandmother's house will mean she's accomplished her goal. <br>  <br>  I hear too many "endings" to the story, so here's what I think:<br>  <br>  Going into her grandmother's house, Red is encountered by the wolf who is disguised as her grandmother. This could possibly represent that one should not always be so trusting, even with family. One must learn to use their own intuition in order to sense whether or not the atmosphere feels weird or not. If you fall for it, then you get eaten. And some lumber jack will come and save you and your grandmother. A second chance, perhaps? Or maybe an ending that lightens the mood a little for the younger kids. <br>  <br>  But yeah, basic story line here:<br>  Girl is becoming a young woman, and she must now start facing the things that she will encounter in the world on her own. She must be able to learn how to deal with the things that will come along her way, or else she'll get hurt or even killed. Even though she'll get to where she needs go, or even if she's with someone she thinks she can trust, there'll always be a need to lookout for danger. That's what growing up is partially about. It's a lesson, a lesson about growing up and the dangers that one will often have to face. Be careful, learn to deal, and you'll be able to do live a little better every day. This is the time when one loses innocence and the time when one faces reality.<br>  <br>  So, was this like a homework assignment or something?|`|db5995604687145651832d17bf9a4c92aa	Little Red Riding Hood is an old German fairy tale about a little girl who goes to visit her grandmother through a dark forest in which The Big Bad Wolf lives.In the olden days when it rained <br>  people on horses in Europe wore a hood over their heads.<br>  The girl in the story wears a red riding hood to protect her from the weather so she is called Little Red Riding Hood and she loves her grandmother so much that she will face the wolf.|`|68lGkNyDaa	Okay, I've been reading "little red riding hood" for over fifty years and the "oracle's" answer just blew my mind.|`|HPVLYYJGaa	its used in some poem.......... n i dont think so it has got a particular meaning.... its jst used for rhyming....|`|WoW3J6pLaa	its a short story, i hope you will be knowing that, it doesnt have any meaning, and why are you asking this question.

rpuCEm5Uaa	Lizbeth,<br>  You may not agreee with what I am going to say to you, but I certainely hope you would think about it.<br>  First thing I want to tell you is to learn first to love yourself. You are the most important person to you, and your value is worth more than having a multitude of boyfriends.<br>  Secondly, don't settle. You are young, and are just beginning to conquer the world. There are so many roads for you to travel, and your success is measured by what you make of yourself, not in the number of boyfriends you can add to your notch. There are many young women who wish they could take back being "out there", because the sad thing is, obnce you give it away, you can't get it back.<br>  Did you graduate from High School yet?<br>  Please concentrate on college, and the beautiful person that I believe you are.<br>  Boyfriends come and go, and really, you don't want to settle simply for the sake of saying you have a man.<br>  Do not go looking, when the time is right, the person for you will come along. Of course it sounds cliche, but it is the truth.<br>  My niece also like you, and I have given her the same advice.<br>  Your mom being proud of you is important right now. There are many girls who don't have their mom's support, or anyone's for that matter.<br>  I hope that I have helped you in a small way.<br>  Please remember that you should always put yourself first, stay true to what you believe is right no matter what others are doing or saying, and pray.<br>  With Love|`|sRhu4U3Uaa	you are not meesing nothin about sex you keep savin your self for that right person that God send to you  you will know when that time come! goodluck!|`|y2KbdoU6aa	Lizbeth........o man!!! why do you feel there is something wrong with you???!!!

cdQryr7paa	You can't tell your bf who he can talk to or not talk to you.<br>  If he is into you and truely your bf, then he won't listen to what the guy says and even tell him to stop talking crap about you.<br>  If he isn't telling him to stop saying stuff about you, or listening to what the guy is saying, then you need to examine if you really need him as a bf.|`|a0c102b8ca14a50e8e38a99b46dd5505aa	The talking crap about you part is sticking with me.

nSGEyiywaa	You need to move on and find someone else who will share the same way you feel. Obviously she wants to string you along. If she has trust issues now, she'll have trust issues down the line.... it's the fact that she's avoiding it right now. If she truly loved you she'd try and work it out now, not later. You can't get your hopes up. You need to go out and live your life now and not sit around and wait for her.|`|d75a215506dd9f3e3ff03a3892cfb7c0aa	she wont give her heart to him if she's still in love with you. <br>  same thing for you if you still love her.    and the bad relationships will continue for both of you if youre not completely free to love someone else.  but, good luck with that.   either you let her go from your heart completely or wait it out.  either way, your future relationships will probably suck.

AA10293793	everybody has something to offer.<br>  i guess it depends on what kind of relationship you're going for here. you have the rugged cowboy thing going for you - i don't know what your real job is but there are too many romance books featuring rugged bronc and bull riders as the hero for it not to have some sex appeal. in all honesty i find bareback riding sexy as all get out. having said that, i wouldn't be inclined to consider a bull rider for the father of my children, though i might pick one for an occasional roll in the hay. i guess the bottom line is, what you do is probably going to be a turn on for most women, but how you do it, and why you do it, not so much (if you're thinking long term). i can only speak for myself on this one: when i am looking for someone to spend my life with, to father my children, i am looking for someone whose hobby isn't in danger of getting them killed, not to mention someone who will be home on weekends to mow the lawn and make a special dinner for, and play with the dog and the kids. if i was looking at you and thinking roll in the way, you're the greatest thing since sliced bread. but if i was thinking marriage and kids we would have to figure out some compromise because the bullriding would have to go.

If it was him and his buddies, I don't want to be the only woman there.  I would probably not want to do the hunting part, but would be more inclined to hang out at camp.  <br>  <br>  My rule is they can go hunting, but they have to do all the cleaning.  I am happy to cook it for them, but they get to clean it. I have no interest in cleaning an animal.|`|FktKvEQWaa	hey, I am fine with hunting to eat... you eat what you kill fine, what I dont like are unsanitary slaughter houses and other unnatural enviroments for raising and killing animals...<br>  <br>  hunting is natural, its part of being human... well male anyway|`|Ege5abQRaa	yeah i love hunting most of the time i make my best friend (he's a guy) go with me (cuz i don't have a bf).|`|clRAc05Naa	Yeah, I'm a bunny hugger so I would never do that. But if my b/f was a hunter, I probably wouldn't mind unless he bragged a lot and tried forcing me to go with him.|`|jASHPOYUaa	"love is rejoicing in the otherness of the other." <br>  <br>  if hunting was a huge part of who he was, and it was really important to him that he share that part of himself with the person he loved, then yes i would be honored. i'm also a firm believer that if a person eats meat or wears leather, to refuse to experience such an event would constitute the utmost in denial and hypocrisy. even if i cried throughout the entire "processing" or puked all over in disgust, it is dishonorable to not hold the animal's sacrifice in the highest respect.<br>  <br>  on the other hand, in the spirit of that quote, if she just can't or won't do it, and you want to love her, you have to try to find a way to rejoice in that quality of hers.<br>  <br>  (bunny huggers can bite it!  humans would never have developed without a high protein diet. this is scientific fact.)|`|a66b9020fecea14970cf8c13fe80888faa	I'm a bunny hugger and I'd like to harvest you

AA12339238	1st of all...How old are you....It sounds like perhaps you are in love with the chase.  Probably once you finally got her you would decide you were done and dump  her.  Try chasing after somene else that does not want you and see if you have the same desire.|`|bNdMR66Paa	Ok, seems to me like you really love her, just get in touch with her and let her know how you feel.  Its not good to feel this way and not do anything about it.  Tell her exactly what you wrote here.  Send her an email explaining to her how you feel, there may be a chance but you have to be honest and up front with her.  Hope tis helps!|`|Z2NLFBOFaa	just tell her.
9RZxP0dZaa	Well many would recommend a movie but you cannot really get to know someone at a movie. I would recommend having a nice dinner, playing something like put put golf or going for a walk in the park. If you both like music, go to a concert. If you both like sports, go to a game. It really depends on what you both are interested in.|`|3zJ3eWteaa	Golf, bowling, mall, arcade, movie. Things of that sort.|`|8eQoNPdYaa	Be yourself, go to get some pizza or something  and talk.|`|AA10595380	ive always found that the Zoo or theme park|`|yhXi27U0aa	Go walking, or go out for dinner dutch style(pay for your self).  just hang out with him, see what he wants to do.|`|mr6SqSevaa	Be yourself.|`|cb3f205ed49147ccbafe64d4742b4cc4aa	movies are a good thing to start out with because you dont have to do much talking because first dates are always the most awkward so make it easy on you and him......before or after the movie maybe you could go to a good burger place but on the first date you should probably pay your way unless he says he will pay for it but dont argue just say thank you politely...i hope this helps!
cR1M8ALyaa	If you're that freaked out over something that doesn't hurt anymore than a little pinch, then I don't know how to help you.<br>  <br>  I would hope that you are old enough not to kick and scream over a shot though... It's pretty sad if you actually do that.|`|9b95ebb9cc6400eed21f206c4fb51951aa	just close yur eyes relax and get it over with. you wont feel a thing.. its ok girl, we all been there|`|52ce97d412b0c26cf800e6779706ee71aa	I hate shots too.<br>  <br>  If you make yourself soft meaning relaxed, it doesn't hurt.<br>  <br>  But if you put your arms on stress, the needle will hurt|`|5ZajLSyWaa	If it's for your own health you better prepare yourself.

Being a diabetic really sucks. <br>  Even taking a TB test scares the fell out of me.There is little else that scares me, but those needles do. So ok, ask for a butterfly needle (they are thinner). Second and most important, just don't look! Third of all try not to tense, it will only make it harder for the needle to penetrate. Remember, it will be over quick. If you don't look, you'll be surprised at how little it really does hurt. It is mind over matter, tell yourself. you can do it!|`|An8iAs2taa	Haha. Have fun.|`|CEsTJ3GFaa	It doesn't hurt (although I know how that statement doesn't help much since I have gone through the same fears).  What i find helps is looking the other way so that you don't see the needle.  Also, if you need to, try to think of something you like while getting the shots.
iS4qgYACaa	yep that is this catorgy!|`|MlNryOcQaa	so wheres the ?

However, with that being said, if you are of age then you also realize that you are the one that has to be happy with your b/f, however you do not even know what your true feelings are towards him are  after being with him for a year?

Girls like that. When me and my boyfriend were still in that 'talking' stage before we were dating he would always use smilies when we texted. It was cute, like "good night A.J. :)" Adorable. I'm a sucker for anything cute. Haha just be yourself around her, don't try too hard. Trust me, we can tell when you are. And yes, if you are flirty, there's a good chance she will flirt back, most girls do. Best of luck! :)    Oh, and about the nickname. I think it's kind of cute. Any nickname usually good.|`|Adq6y8tXaa	just be cute! but be rude.. don't go off telling her nasty things you want to do because that would be a turn off if you came off so strong and it would also seem like all you want is sex.. so i'd say just be cute and show her that you care|`|oDTzW46maa	To start flirting, simply kind of get yourself happy about seeing her. Or more happy and when you see her, hug her. And just smile at everything she says, and laugh at her little jokes. Just be yourself- but act sort of just plain happy.    If you touched her to much, or commented on your boobs or something like that, it may make her uncomfortable, depending on the girl. Callie Wallie, well it's cute but kind of weird. If your joking with her or something, just call her Callie Wallie, she may laugh. You never know.|`|R5mmX9Woaa	Maybe if you said callie wallie jokingly, and laughed it off together. I would say if you want to be more flirty, you have to risk the chance of her being uncomfortable a little bit. Make sure you flirty-ness stays appropriate, you are both in high school after all. Jokes and flirting go hand in hand in my opinion, so keep it funny. Playful banter of playful put downs are also good - emphasis on playful, you don't want to insult her.     Best of luck! Hope this helps!    P.S: If anyone would like 2 help me please answer my last question. Thanks!|`|5K1WNuNJaa	Tickle her. Kiss her. Give her big teddy bear hugs. Look her in the eye more.

aLgY4l3Naa	Marriage is a partnership and should be treated just as that!! You both need to sit down and talk about these things and figure out ways to make them work for you both, its about communication, commitment and effort from the both of you!! First of all don't nag your husband because that always seems to give a negative affect!! Try to look at things in a positive aspect when ever dealing with the issues at hand, like you said he does the dishes but he does it 3 or 4 hours after you have eaten, well the thing is, he is getting it done just not to your timely standards BUT HE IS DOING THEM and that's the good part!! I know this can become frustrating and just make you want to throw the towel in, but when you took the marriage vows you did make a promise "FOR BETTER OR WORSE" so try not to nag but to work with your husband so that the two of you can become a wonderful team together!! Remember you will have qualities that HE WONT and he will have qualities that YOU WONT but together you both can take those qualities and make it work!! Good luck to you and i wish you luck!!|`|eb9a693cbdde8fd29f4eff3ed378d62baa	yeah that sounds familiar.      some me, some my wife, but definitely familiar.        my answer was to put her entirely in charge of the bills, so then she understood the importance of getting them out on time.     as far as the dishes/garbage are concerned, well I still get in trouble for those, but I accept getting yelled at for my avoidance behavior.    meantime I called her bluff.  she said if she was stuck doing the dishes, cleaning, laundry, garbage, etc.  she shoudn't have to work.  So I told her to quit and stay at home.    so call his bluff, if he doesn't want to chip in around the house tell him you'll do it, but he's got to make up your salary.  either way you win.|`|KadJyjtBaa	Its funny, I went through similar situations. However, my suggestion to you is sit down and talk. Tell him how you feel and try getting involved as well as him trying to come up with a plan to help him help himself, you and the marriage function.  My husband and i decided that since we have a 2 bedroom home we'd clean at the same time and help each other hed clean one room and i clean the other. he sweeps i mop. He washes the dishes i dry them and put them away. He helps me manage the money by keeping track of what needs to be paid for, balances and so forth. It seems to work for me.   Marriage is about finding trust in each other and learning how to work as a team. Try working out a plan and give him time, and have faith but you need to let him know that he needs to put time and effort because in order for a marriage to function and be successful both need to give their shares.|`|H3WHxCgaaa	Pre-marital counseling - it makes the counselor the bad guy and not you for trying to get your fiance to do these things....besides, they will help you guys work out and talk about other marital issues and communication.  Can't hurt!    Edit:  Didn't read enough - try marriage counseling for you two...it'll help with your communication - if nothing else.|`|2f2338425d995c6d00e32cb38d57ee7faa	Maybe you need to re-think the list of chores? Finances is an especially tricky one; some people are not good with money, and never will be; if you feel you can do a better job at handling the finances, by all means you should do it - it's too important to let him "learn on the job" and screw it up.     As far as the rest goes... We all forget things. My husband doesn't always remember to put the garbage out either - it's not a big deal, and not worth getting in a tizzy over. And what's the big deal if he does dishes 3 hours after dinner? He does do them, right? When you agree on splitting the chores, you have to learn to back off and let the person do things their way. If his way is to do dishes 3 hours after dinner, then this is how it will be done; it shouldn't be that big a deal.     I agree that upbringing has a lot to do with being responsible as an adult. So, you got a head start in learning responsibility and he hasn't caught up yet. You need to be patient. People don't change overnight; it may take him years to become truly responsible; you guys are still very young, and have lots of room to grow and improve. 10 years ago, when I was 24, I was a different person, in many ways still a kid; seems like it was ages ago - and I was on my own in a different country since I was 18 years old, so if anyone knew anything about responsibility, it was me.     The one thing that is very important to do right the first time is finances. I strongly suggest you take over in this area. But things around the house is not such a big deal; guide him, give him direction, but let him do things in his own way, on his own time. He will learn. Also, what are his strong suits? Maybe there are things that he would be really good at that you could assign to him? My husband is a real handyman, so he's often working on various projects around the house - painting, installing new lights, fixing stuff; recently he re-built the patio. I'm happy to do all the dishes, and let him handle all the home-improvement stuff. But yes, in general, I don't have to worry about my husband, he's very responsible and is always doing stuff. We're a little older, tho (he just turned 38), so by this age people generally are more responsible. So you might have a little ways to go still.|`|BUET39wmaa	put a list on the fridge like a little kid and maybe he will look at it and remember his chores|`|IQ50BJ0Waa	I'm not saying lower your expectations but it sounds like you expect for him to be perfect. He's your husband - not a robot. And if he lacks common sense and is irresponsible why is he handling the finances? Cut him a little slack and realize that he's human.|`|bO2rzfISaa	Finances is a bad job for him. I realized my husband sucks at it and took it away from him after COUNTLESS fees.    Really, you  can thank his mom for this. My kids are more responsible than this, but that's how I raise them.|`|aDIPIu7xaa	Well, he has always been like this.    I doubt he will change.  And you can't change him, so don't bother trying!|`|rcut6bhoaa	Sounds as if he has ADHD, or at least some traits of it.  Lack of organizational skills,  cant finish one thing before he starts on another.    I have been though this and kinda sounds like me.  In order to help him,  you need to make a list of the things for him to do , as basic as it sounds.  Emphasize one doing only one thing at a time.  See if that helps.      Attention span is another thing, sometimes a person gets so frustrated that he just gives up on the tasks at hand.    Contact a counselor and see what they think after him/you going there.  It may help out your relationship.  There is a simple test that even a counselor can give, that takes 5 minutes to see what is going on .  Hope this helps you out.|`|TzeYsXKGaa	You're both young, I'm guessing you're newlyweds. I had similar problems with my hubby helping around the house and I talked to my mom about it because her and my dad do everything together...true teamwork. She said it took them years to get to that place. So I think cut him some slack and if he forgets the trash, you take it out. So what if the dishes are done after 3 or 4 hours...they're still done. He's clearly trying so let him try. You'll eventually find your groove together and get the teamwork down.    EDIT: Also cleaning isn't really "common sense" maybe to you cleaning the dishes right after dinner makes the most sense and maybe to him as long as they get cleaned it doesn't matter when. He's not going to see everything the same as you.    I know I'm always like ugh the house is a mess and my husband will look confused and I'll be like well the furniture needs to be polished, the floor vacuumed, and things like that. Honestly my husband would NEVER notice these things, it's not like he does and goes haha I'll make her do it, he just doesn't notice so it's  not a big deal to do it myself cuz I'm the one who notices!|`|263434b6fe9b827cbad3893e796d8d18aa	He doesn't lack common sense, he's just lazy. He knows exactly what he's doing. And honey, he only hears about the first 5 seconds of anything you say. Unless you are talking sports(or his sport of choice), sex or beer, he has tuned you out.|`|OBCvewW2aa	He had all that free time to study and the best he can do is a gig at the pest control company?  Pffttt... his behavior might be mildly acceptable if he were a doctor or an attorney, but this?  Whatta disappointment...|`|AA11496842	He's very immature and will never grow up.|`|n8vBnA9Iaa	Is he your husband or child? Stop the insane nagging and little chore lists. Maybe there is nothing wrong with him, but doesn't want to do it because his crazy controlling wife is breathing down his neck. Time and time again.   Keeping the house tidy constantly is not that hard. Every night before bed, pick things up, and put them where they belong. Do the dishes after dinner. Do laundry when your sitting around for the evening. For someone who has been doing chores since the age of 12, you should know this. Sounds like your pretty high on yourself, been doing chores since you were 12 is nothing to brag about. Maybe if you had won a Noble Peace prize or something.    Is your husband legally retarded? From the way you talk about him, you make it sound like he is.    Wait till you have kids.|`|9fa1adb1c8a5e488f13a34915c1381ceaa	People don't change, that's the one thing I've learned. If he's doing all that now, he will still be doing all that 20 years from now, exactly the same way. Either decide you can live with it and do everything yourself, or divorce him. I know that sounds harsh, but its the simple truth. And take the checkbook away from him right now, before he lands you both in bankruptcy court.|`|5Wr9Mlwoaa	Probably has ADD.    And what is it like there? Chores every night? Say it isn't so.
a12e193114f1493cd577cd2bd7fe28f6aa	Yes dear! They are all like this! We women just have to learn to deal with it. That is why we have girlfriends! Talk it out with your girlfriends and you will feel better. But men just dont talk about feels, or emotions! It is really hard to deal with, but you just have to learn to accept it. I know it sucks! |`|YMXmKKpxaa	Yes most men don't like talking about their feelings. What i find that works for me is, trrying to talk about the subject, but don't press him to be more girl about the way he feels, just let him talk about it the best he can. And if he starts yelling at you, you can either walk away, stand there and take it, or try to clam hime down, but don't start fighting with him because he will justified his actions were right because you started to fight with him.<br>  <br>  <br>  |`|dBsKywXJaa	My husband gets so nervous when we talk about things like money or conflict that he walks out of the room in fifteen seconds...he doesn't even know he's doing it. <br>  I try to get around it by thinking about the problem beforehand, plotting out my own solution then setting a (short) time for a meeting. Then after that, I try to set a calm, cheerful tone and begin and end the conversation by talking about positive aspects of the problem. <br>  I think the key is that men don't like conflict -- they want everything to be nice and happy -- so it's important to make it clear you're not blaming him or accusing him of anything -- you just need his help.|`|6B1Sggi6aa	I have a husband who was born with a learning disability and he doesn't do well at expressing himself or his feelings. So what I do is get at his level and try to read him like that.In a man's eyes expressing there feelings takes away from being a man,so try to be more understanding about that.They say that love's concur all.Remember that this is the man you love and want to be with. It's going to be hard. Let him know that it's important for you to know his feelings and that's the only way your relationship can survive.No more arguing,find another outlet to solve your differences.All men are different. Try to figure out why, then work on how, then work on resolving. The key words here are love, patience, and understanding. It's not as easy for men as for women, because we will and can let it all out!Stay strong and loyal to how hard you've work on this relationship and don't give up. I didn't and now we've together for 17 years.It's love that came through in the end. Believe me|`|MKJAobeVaa	Yes, we do avoid talking about these things a lot. For one main reason.... 9 times out of 10 it ends bad. <br>  <br>  We can't express our feelings like women but they expect us to... is in our genes sorry. And then they get pissed because we don't express our feelings right. So maybe you don't understand HIM?<br>  <br>  Listen, I totally agree with you about talking these things through. No need to wait for an argument... But when you try to talk about it, bring the subject in a positive, non-arguing manner that way we feel much more confortable about it. And just keep an opened mind about men being different from women. Believe me, you can get any guy to be really open about his feelings... sometimes more than women, but it takes work. If your husband feels in any way it will end in an argument, then he'll stop right there and then, and remember, thru experience, he will already approach the subject cautiously.<br>  <br>  Good luck.|`|3xTEDINMaa	Every relationship is different but most men are not like this when they are in a meaningfull relationship that they care about. It is very possible that he has hit that plateau stage where we become numb to our loved one. Give him a reality check and am sure he'll come around. Dont beg, plead, or let him see you cry, simply give him a dosage of his own medicine while being the bigger person. If he wants to treat this like a game you have to be the winner of it.|`|e3Hh3Xkiaa	with my bf its not so much that he avoids it, he just doesnt seem to know how to. its odd considering hes actually terrific at writing, he just has an inability to verbalise what hes feeling. to get him to open up i try to sit down with him and tell him that not communicating with me is making me unhappy and insecure and that for us to work properly i need to know what he is feeling. usually this will get something out of him! it is difficult and makes me wonder where we are going sometimes, but after a talk i usually feel more encouraged. good luck.|`|XkupmomKaa	Yes, talk to him when you can.  If you don't like this you should confront him about it, maybe he doesn't have strong feelings for anything in particular.  |`|3TW8xBnAaa	We usually do,<br>  stop asking questions to him about his feelings , leave him on his own,<br>  if he doesnt like expressing himself, simply, you cant do anything on the matter.|`|TRKZ3Ao0aa	Yes most men are idiots and never realize the idiosyncrasy the other half is living with.|`|aan2EVoJaa	No, my hus always talking about his feelings and about what he want...<br>  without even me asking.<br>  try make him to relax and ask why hes shy or afraid of...|`|TXsY5zEAaa	yes and the ones that do are lying |`|WFs6f6i2aa	yes|`|AcubUarEaa	it depends on what tastes best really...|`|IbJ2O0vpaa	No, most men are not like this, but a large number of men and women are.  You can do marriage counseling, you can try to get him to do individual counseling, you can get counseling yourself for how to deal with it - but you can't change him.<br>  <br>  All you can do is try to talk about feelings.  My wife tends to avoid talking about hers until something happens, and then we argue.  I talk about mine constantly, so I guess she understands me better than I understand her.  Sometimes she confides in me, and I thank her, and hope the positive reinforcement will lead to more sharing.  I mean, if I were her I'd be sharing my feelings all the time in search of advice and support - but I'm not her.  Sometimes when she doesn't tell me anything about her feelings for a long time and I think something is wrong, I ask, and though it's sometimes like pulling teeth, sometimes it isn't, and either way I learn things I ought to know.  At this point, I kind of figure it's just the way she is, she's nice to me, and I am just going to have to deal with it, and that's OK.  Maybe we can have a fun life without me knowing much about her feelings most weeks.|`|z2SODuR9aa	yes most guys are like that and i must say it is one of the most annoying things..but i guess most guys are just harder to be emotional cuz they need to keep their "manly" side|`|qVMg9YRsaa	Maybe MOST, but surely not ALL... I'm sort of like your husband and my boyfriend is a lot like you. He likes talking things out and I really don't. <br>  And I think if you were to do a small survey you'd find that there are some men who don't fit your husband's profile. But now that you're married, it's no longer your job to attempt to understand MEN or question how many of them do what. Your job is to understand your man. So you need to know what it takes to get him to open up more. And the answer will be different with each guy. If you'd like more advice email me... God bless... |`|ukwEzumdaa	most men dont talk about their feelings.<br>  usually when we start to talk about their feelings, you women pick us apart and always think your feelings are the right ones and that we should think more like you.<br>  but we dont think like you and we wont. we know this. so we avoid talking about these things because we know it will only stir up more arguments and problems.|`|Qo0WqeOpaa	My husband is extremely open with me... He tells me everything that is going on with him and way he feels the way he does.|`|pQ8VGx0Oaa	yes a lot does|`|7be554591e8c040c7b5bfa762a5a2560aa	Have you tried putting your needs in writing...and letting him answer in writing? Sometimes that is easier for them. Depends on the man tho.  Most just cannot go where the female mind goes.  They never will. They are from  Mars....we are from Venus.  as  Dr Phil says you can't change what you won't acknowledge.   Or  "How's that working for you?"<br>  <br>  Sounds corny, but really, if the relationship is not working, that last question could be a wake up call.|`|AA10419793	Speaking from experience, yes.  Men are very poor at communications skills; it is genetic.  I have been trying to communicate with my wife for 39 years of marriage; she can read me like a book but I am still unable to talk to her.  There is a mutual understanding and compensation? |`|pJJyH3vhaa	No, I'm not like that. I'm quite the opposite. I like resolving issues. In fact, my first love and I broke up because SHE always liked burying stuff under the carpet whereas I always wanted communication. She used sex to shut me up and that really offended me. <br>  <br>  So, no, only some men are that way.|`|l3L5eYj4aa	Most real men are like that.  Men live in logic and women live in the emotions.  During conversations try changing the word, feel to think...  That may help...  Men are just uncomfortable talking about it as they never do and really don't know how.|`|VdKis8Uvaa	Women want to tell you a book about what they feel and guys are very brief. I don't dwell on the stupid small stuff and in a couple of words i can sum up the big stuff. You sound like you have about 15 books you want bash into his head. Make it brief.....|`|hCAQ6aWWaa	Yeah most men avoid confrontation.  Try and have a friendly chat and discuss whats on your mind, without pointing the finger|`|Mbbu0Itgaa	Yes most do it seems.  Try to talk to him when your not fighting about whatever.|`|Kgi8vvvoaa	yea us guys like dealing with our problems on our own plus society tells us that we are weak if we talk about them<br>  <br>  now mine ;)<br>  Who thinks I am a sexy beast? I have pics?
q93CKSWwaa	Get them deodorant as a gift.|`|45f1360efad547282be68b1242ba3452aa	Make sure that no one else is around when you tell him/her.<br>  Tell them nicely. If you can smell them I'm sure others can. I'd want to know.|`|vhf0A400aa	tell the truth but tell it slant... <br>  which mean tell them the truth but in a way that won't hurt their feelings.. <br>  they might not even know that have the odor... you could help them!|`|7hmr5aQfaa	"honey, do you know how the flowers along the drive ways got massacred as you walked by?"|`|6gQbZiOFaa	lol mabe say something like a love guys who use axe etc...
P7M0pqajaa	Sweetie, first I am sorry that your friend is saying things that are hurting you.  You will get lots of advice on here but it is up to you what you do.    Your friend may not even realize she is saying things that hurt you.  It could be her personality and sometimes we need to look outside of ourselves at other people.  We are all broken people and we all do things sometimes that hurt others and we don'tt realize it.    Also, since I don't know you if you are really sensitive this may be something that you need to work on.  Not taking things very seriously or being sensitive.  There will always be people in your life that will hurt you or say things you don't like but you must become secure enough in who you are to not let them bother you.    And lastly you must find fullfilment in God and not other people, if you have not already.  Only he will fill those needs inside your heart and allow you to not lean on others for that.    Take care hun|`|dHgPVOVPaa	Yes, its totally okay. In my opinion, she's a jerk. Do you really want to be friends with someone like that?|`|evEJxv06aa	tell her if she doesn't stop it than you are going to break your friendship with her or a better idea Trust me it will work why don't you behave like her with her and soon enough she will re-lase that you felt the same way and says sorry to you right than.|`|VuGMOf4Caa	I hate bossy and mean people.  Just tell her to back off or do the same to her and see how she likes it.|`|oojO4WAraa	It's okay with me.      I think you should dump her as a "friend" until she can grow up and ACTING like a friend.|`|2R1H8B8taa	It's a hard age. I know that totally sucks, but I had a friend like that in high school too. unfortunately, sometimes fighting fire with fire works too, so just jokingly say something like that to her. Or, just read her facial expression. I think she is just kidding..    PS you should see beauty and the beast! its good|`|vA07XhcKaa	Well it seems like that is just her personality. I know it hurts your feelings however perhaps you are being overly sensitive. My advice is to show her what you wrote on here and explain to her that you are her best friend but her insults make you feel bad. If she doesn't stop, you have two choices, you can either accept that , that is part of who she is, or you can call it quits for a while and see if she either apologizes or ditches you for good. A true friend will do two things. Accept others for who they are and respect the feelings of each other. She can't make you stop being sensitive and you can't make her stop being silly. perhaps her brothers and sisters picked on her growing up and she is just repeating what has happened to her. Regardless, as I said, have a private but serious discussion with her.  I hope this helps and Smile and be blessed :)|`|EUd3HjFhaa	You're taking it way out of proportion. She's your friend and friend will say things like that all of the time.   As a matter of fact... my best friend is asian and I'm mexican (and a pretty dark one at that). when she says something i don't like I tell her to go pick some rice and when i say something she doesn't like, she tells me to go back to africa. we call each other B!+(h, ****, and all kinds of other names. That's what friends do.  But if it really does bother you and you've told her to stop, she obvious doesn't respect you and you just might need to find new friends who do.|`|0ZnX6Qjyaa	yes|`|PtqOvLtOaa	sounds like sarcasm to me.|`|XJGp4AxHaa	Friends can have disagreements. I think that you should just explain how you feel or get over it. I always took the second way since I didn't like talking about feeling with my friends.|`|SIFwDinAaa	its ok to be mad at her. everyone gets mad at their friends at least once in a awhile. just continue telling her that it hurts when she does that, and if shes a real friend, she'll stop.  good luck :)|`|H66RHumIaa	They are just kidding. Don't be mad at them... It's not nice of them though...|`|c91032f4386f0b1ceea8747a91b30331aa	You should calmly explain to her that when she says that, she hurts your feelings. If you don't then things would just get worse and might even end a really good relationship. Also maybe you shouldn't take things seriously and learn to trust that she's just playing around. I really hope I helped!    :)God bless|`|DAU9lIO7aa	Yes, you should not take things personally and yes... You have all the right in the world to be sad and angry on your friend if she not behaves.|`|jBxW6ee9aa	I had the same thing going on also. I just told her, " I know your joking but it still hurts my feeling. So could you please stop." And it worked! So if you tell her how you feel maybe she'll stop. And if she dose not, take a break from her. Hope this helps.|`|aMHIA7XMaa	Stop taking it so personally.|`|ULLDjjHZaa	tell her to stop because its hurtin' your feelins|`|9SSO454taa	lol come on|`|ZmlXRnlcaa	i know what you mean but i think you need to talk with her in person or over the phone and talk about what you think she should stop and both not get mad at each other for saying how you feel and come to an agreement. :) hope everything works out|`|sw2C2gMwaa	You should love when she says stuff like that to you! She likes you, and is flirting! Boys and girls are mean to each other when they like each other...(OMG, YOU'VE NEVER SEEN BEAUTY AND THE BEAST??)|`|DE0DJsdqaa	talk to her if you're a good friend.|`|4cp2eZwbaa	say "HEY LOOK...YOUR MY BEST FRIEND AND I DONT LIKE BEING CALLED NAMES...IT REALLY HURTS MY FEELINGS..."  then explain to her that you understand that she is joking, but sometimes it doesn't sound like it, and that it kind of gets to you and makes you uncomfotable.|`|O7mnsqKwaa	when you talk to her about it, and she says that shes just kidding, just tell her that your serious and she really needs to stop. and if that doesnt work, maybe hang out with some other people and that might get the point across.|`|Ly2pvbfcaa	Tell her again that what she is doing really does hurt your feelings and you don't appreciate it. If she is truly your BFF she will respect you!!|`|ENYkIOPDaa	Tell her straight up.  If she doesn't listen then tell her: "Look, I'm glad we're best friends and all but I'm not going to just let you insult me like you always do."  Then see if she changes|`|5SEogmv6aa	I just say I don't kare if ur kidding, It hurts so plz Stop or we can't be friends!!! but be nice|`|1RAR0bEdaa	i had this problem tell her that you don't like it then if that doesn't work then just do it back|`|Hj5sXNI7aa	Andy,  A best friend would stop doing what you ask her to stop doing. If you tell her that what she is saying bothers you and she keeps doing it, well, she is not your best friend, and you need to tell her, you can't be her best friend if she doesn't stop. You already are wondering about her, you know it isn't right what she is doing, you are only needing verification. There is truth in kidding. If kidding hurts, it is wrong. For some reason she needs to knock you down? Why? take care and be aware.|`|onbwN4csaa	Shut her off for a while.  don't see or speak for about 4 or 5 days.  She will ask you what is up. Now tell her. Tell that if she can't respect your wishes you can move on. At this point what good is she as a good friend?  If someone kids there is some truth to it in some way.  She's telling you in a way that don't hurt you.  Comity always has truth behind it.  Find out who your true friends are.   Those are the once. that should get your attention.  No friend put you down.|`|Ejp91kLeaa	You should tell her that it actually herts ur feelings even when she says she's kidding and if she is really ur friend than she will start to get the picture and lay low on the insults. I think that ur friend is just saying that to get attention cuz she "knows" that you won't take it the wrong way.    =)
NMYiE6dgaa	I would just try talking to her about it again. Tell her how much your friendship means to you.. and that you know she would do the same for you if you were in her shoes. That is very generous of you to give her 400 as a gift. Tell her that whenever she gets the money(no hurry) she can pay you. Tell her that your not mad at her at all and that you just want to help her. Money problems can stress anyone out!! I know that first hand. so just try and be there for her and just let her know your not mad your there to help her.|`|bttrB0Rfaa	Just keep picking up the phone & talking to her. It's good she's so concerned, hopefully she really does pay it back. That was very generous of you. You could tell her you know she's under a lot of stress & want to be there to help her but when she acts like you're upset when you're not, it makes you wonder if she knows what good friends you really are.|`|KTCVe9KYaa	Maybe talk to her other friends, parents or people who she listens to and tell them she should stop stressing out.|`|WJjfrf0Caa	tell her that you understand her situation and that you know there is no possible way for her to pay you at this time so you are not going to force her to do anything she can't actually do.    and then tell her that you are not mad at her now, but you would only be mad if you found out that she was going shoe shopping and wasting any money she could be paying you with.    or just let her know that you will give her a 3 month extension. that will create a new deadline and she can focus on getting another job instead of worrying about this debt.|`|t0uIgY08aa	wanna be my friend??? jk. Just help her out look for a job for her or give her more money. idk. what i'm doing now is paying minimum bills for my friend until she gets back on her feet. but i push her to look for a job.|`|dPULl5hjaa	Your no way pressuring her to repay so tell that again, again, again, again, until she gets it.    If she insists in paying the whole $900.00 or the $500.00 you informed her, tell her you'll set up a payment plan once she secures employment again.    What a nice friend!|`|9vvaFxEeaa	Tell her very clearly that you are reducing the obligation to $500.  Then set up a new time for repayment that is contingent of her employment.  For example, you could have her pay you 3 days after receiving her second paycheck from the next job she gets.|`|XYOYml59aa	you are being really nice to her. I would try to constantly remind her you are her friend, and you don't want her to go into debt because of money she owes you. also ask her what she would do in your position, and try to show her that she doesn't have to pay you right now. you can refuse to take money from her for now until she has a job but this can be tricky i she takes a loan for it.|`|ba428f6f619bfc67fa65e92c90d4c839aa	Tell her that if she is that worried about it that she can pay of the debt with sex.|`|H66RHumIaa	Help her get more money or help her get a job...|`|YFKwT1owaa	Make her pay the $900 so she feels better about it|`|pUYfE1Zraa	try showing her this question!|`|dd6rgtL7aa	There's nothing you can do but keep reassuring her. Tell that you understand she's sorry and in a bad place... but to not put herself further in the hole because of a debt she owes to you. Tell her you have the money, you dont need it right now...and if she still wants to pay you back later, she can....but to not do it now.|`|qHUcyrytaa	Sounds like you are a generous person and asking for very little in return. You might try to set up a payment plan for her and tell her she can start the payments in a couple months if you can wait that long for the money.|`|PuVgZiddaa	make her do something for you for example, my best friend needed 1500 dollars last month but i have a personal rule that i do not loan money (everyone knows this that knows me) so i told him he could drywall my unfinished basement (basement of a town home) and i would pay for all materials.  this way he was able to give me something to receive something.  i do not do favors to expect something in return but i learned a lesson earlier in life that it is easier to give then loan because you never get loans payed back.  And this way he felt better because he was working for the money and i was not giving it to him.|`|2JJLYSAKaa	You are a good friend and she is a good friend to you.  Even with all her other problems, she is still concerned with her commitment to you.  You must trust her in order to loan her this money and you are being very generous to "forgive" the $400.  Your terms for the repayment of the $500 are more than fair.    Why did she lose her job?  How is she going to live?  Under no circumstances what so ever, loan her any more money!!  If you truly value your friendship, do not loan her any more money.  If you do, it will be the start of the end of a beautiful friendship.    I "helped' out a friend.  After the first loan there was always something else.  Eviction is rent not paid, repossession if car payment not made, electric turned off if not paid.     Sound familiar???  How is she going to live with no income and already in the hole?  My "friend" figured that I wasn't sweating over the first loan and getting repaid, that I could afford to keep handing out the cash.  She became a leech.  She would hint and tell me all her hardships and if she only had $100 she could get her phone turned on to talk to you, her good friend.    Do anything you can to help her but give her anymore money !!!!!   Help her with updating her resume, filling out job applications, take her to dinner if she's hungry, bring her a care package of toilet paper, paper towels, everyday necessities.      My mom passed away and left me some money.  I am happy to help out when I can, but some people took advantage of my friendship and my generosity.  They were using me.  When I wouldn't give them money for their problems, they got mad.  I had money and could help them out and I'm not.  I am such a bad selfish friend.  People took thousands of dollars from me with no intention of paying it back.  They claimed these loans were gifts.      Just be careful.  Don't make the same mistakes I did.  This girl is in some serious financial trouble and now no job??    It is going to get much worse before it gets better.|`|2q0CNeg0aa	honey i would be to gurl u better make sure you get ur money i wouldnt kare if it was ur best friend im srry but you gave her 900.00 dollars and you need to get ur payback back|`|HESpmdqAaa	straight up tell her that there are no issues....but you have to understand the kind o person she is... she sounds like she doesnt like to owe people and she doesnt want to become that person that you think only calls bc she wants something...just let her do whatever she wants it will help soothe her...|`|CCqqTw6paa	sit her *** down and talk to her until you get the point into her thick skull    jokes...  errrm mention the global financial crisis, and that it wouldn't be feasible for her to get a loan for debt consolidation, considering that if shes late on the rent that could mean her *** may be kicked out onto the streets...     let her know that you understand and that its OK|`|rn0dxfmhaa	Dear Guy in distress     If you are really her friend you should just give her the money.  in the same way if she treasure your friendship she will pay you back at the proper moment
hIAKXlsNaa	First of all, Im sorry your daughter had to go through that and sorry that you as a mother had to go through it too.  I really really hope that you don't allow him to come live with you again.  He has proven that he can't be trusted and your Role is to be protective over your daughter who has already been hurt by him.  Please please think hard about this decision and listen to your heart.  it wont be easy but I'm pretty sure you already know the decision you need to make.  Good luck to you and your family {{Hugs}} :^)|`|AhO0Uoppaa	are you serious, dont let that scum in the same area as you let alone the same house you have given him two chances where as  most people would have disowned him after the first chance.look after your daughter and forget about him|`|vwuMTm7Saa	It is not safe to have him in your home.  I am so sorry that you are dealing with this.  I would try to find a counseling center that charges on a sliding scale based on your income and get professional help for your whole family.|`|af644b7256e7bf5a53974bb99a32d482aa	Don't let him move in. He can go back to his father to live.  If it is court record about him molesting your daughter, then they wouldn't allow it anyway.    You have to put her first here.|`|IhZSaDXDaa	Please, don't trust him. Maybe help him pay for an apartment but PLEASE do not let him into the house. It's a horrible thing to be molested|`|XYOYml59aa	Either find a way where you can control him at all times or you have to be strict and not let him in. Tell him from the past he can't be trusted to stay with you until he can completely prove he will do as he should.     You can try maybe finding him a job and/or another place to live, but just remember, if anything goes wrong at either, you have to set it up where it i on him and not you (like no favors from other people type of thing and all).    I know this seems mean but when you can't trust someone, even if you love them, you have to do what is needed.|`|FwJLD1uDaa	wow thats hard! i wouldnt let him at home if i were you, but on the other hand he is your son. hmmm... im sorry i couldnt be of much help!!! good luck :)|`|OD3hxWxvaa	make him stay with his father, and ONLY his father..|`|BYHRjUa6aa	Don't let him move in. Protect you're little girl.|`|oojO4WAraa	Make him go live in a halfway house.  The jail can direct him to halfway houses in your area.|`|AA12041870	I agree with your husband.  Your son can't be trusted.  He is going to have to go into some other type of home.  Because of his past, he may want to consider a half-way house.  The courts can help you with this.  Your life will be miserable if you let him live with you.  None of this is your fault.  Never let anyone tell you it is.  Bless you and your baby girl.|`|7xHfvMIZaa	Love can be expressed in many ways. Do't you love your daughter too? Keep her save, and love HIM by keeping her away from a victim.     It would also be incredibly cruel of you to keep them in the same house--she was molested. She will NOT be the same. You cannot let him be near her, ever. Doesn't matter what he says.|`|vGCetYmAaa	for your safety and the safety of your daughter i wouldn't let him.|`|bg86ji6naa	Are you kidding?????Don't let him near you house, daughter, or life. The most i could say to make contact is on the phone.|`|TOljxMLMaa	Well if you let him move in  make him get a job and pay rent bills etc..  make him go to counseling.  He is your son you still need to help him  and he needs you to be there hes been through a lot.  I know hes put you through a lot too though.    Give him a chance , maybe he'll prove you wrong.  If he messes up tell him that was his last chance!!|`|2VtFVKCDaa	I know there's that "mother loves her child no matter what" but you've gotta look out for the safety of yourself and your other family members. Do not let him move in.|`|BJzhuAGWaa	if you really cant trust your son (which if i were you, i wouldnt be able to...) dont ever put you, your husband, your daughter, or anyone else in the position to be hurt. good luck && be smart.|`|a0b83986209c3ad9a015c92f044e983eaa	dont do it! He needs to grow up and move on with his life. I say maybe helping him get his own place and a job but having him live with you will be horrible and life threatning.|`|SDiNKp8oaa	Don't let him move in... Do you want to lose your daughter too?|`|1JY3GY41aa	Its a tough situation but your son has made his choices in life. That does not necessarily make him a bad person though. But, you do need to think about your daughter. She should be your primary concern. Your son is old enough to take care of himself now and has to deal with the consequences of his actions. Your daughter is still a child and definitely more in need of your care, and putting her in a situation where she may be harmed is not a responsible way of caring for her.|`|YbwDFvEaaa	He is your son, of  course, but he's now an adult as well. He has to be made accountable for his own actions. In this case I would recommend being honest about the situation. You have a lot of responsibility in taking care of your daughter and the prospect of having him move back in with you creates additional stress. His feelings may be hurt, but considering his history with your daughter this is a risk you have to take.  Perhaps his father will take him back in, and after living with him again, may eventually agree to assist him in getting some professional help.    Good luck and keep your chin up.|`|F7k8AYJBaa	You should try to help him find a place to live so he at least knows your love and support him. but by no means should you put him in the position to be left alone with your daughter at any point.One day he will realize if he has a problem but you need to put your daughter first now...hope this helps a little|`|52ELTGaWaa	You can't let him back into the house where your daughter is living after what he did.  With everything else going on in her life, it will simply be too traumatic for her to have to worry about him hurting her again.  Maybe you can give him some money for an apartment, or find a cheap place and rent it in his name, and then pay a few months of the rent until he has a job and is out on his feet.  Just don't make the mistake of putting the lease in your name or your credit will be ruined when he can't pay.|`|tAYXUXreaa	This is going to sound rude and probably blunt, so I am sorry for that ahead of time. It is time to open up your eyes. Your sons behavior is not out of control and by allowing him to move back in with you it is only making it worse. He should have been kicked out of the house a long time ago. Maybe later in life he will wake up one day and realize that he was horrible and come and say he is sorry, but it is not going to be while he is in jail or just coming out of there. He is only using you to get what he needs in life. Your should always love you child, but this child you should not like.  Give him the boot and tell him to come back when he was changed. I am guaranteeing you that he has not changed if he is in jail.     Once again sorry if this came off mean. I have a family friend who is dealing with the same thing, although their son is now 21 and has robbed them, has gotten a high school girl pregnant, and is dealing drugs out of their house. You think you can stop it once it has gotten that bad, but it only gets harder.     You have another child that is probably extremely messed up over her brother raping her, how could you possible allow her to live with even more fear by letting him live in your house?|`|McOF0DVnaa	sometimes you have just have to think with your brain and forget about your heart.  yes he is your son, but you shouldnt for any reason let him back into your life.  i really hope you make the safe choice|`|DHcEbZKVaa	Your main responsibility is to keep your daughter safe and that means your son cannot live where she does. If there is a friend he can move in with I would suggest that while he gets a job and get on his own two feet. You should give him emotional support and some financial help if possible while he hopefully turns over a new leaf.|`|mzkfSwLwaa	He is your son so you need to be there for him but support him from a distance..I dont blame you for not trusting him you got every right. But at the same time it seem like he need some help and love and guidence...Was he molested when he was little? Did something tragic happen to him that turned him this way?    I wish you the best of luck.|`|e5f4c192231c92a0d059825b151f7553aa	This sounds like time for tough love.    Tell him no - until such a time that he has proved himself to be changed.    Currently the risk to your daughter is too high to let him near her.     If he asks you why not - be honest.  Tell him his track record isn`t the most encouraging, and that you want for your daughter, who hasn`t had an easy start, and has already suffered at his hands, to be 100% safe.  As he was the one that went wrong, the challenge is on him to prove to you that he has changed.    Do not accept " yeah but i will change " or " but i am different " - that will not be good enough. You need to see proof yourself before giving your okay.     It may also be a good idea to ask your daughter what she thinks about it - as this will most certainly affect her as well.|`|vHP1VH2Qaa	There is no way I would let him move in with me. Being 19 years old he is able to support himself. Your daughter, on the other hand, cannot. She needs you to support and protect her.    He has already molested her, and what is to stop him from doing it again? Even though he is your son, he is a threat to your daughter. I am sorry, but I would never willingly put one of my kids in harms way, even from another one of my kids.    He made the choices he made to get where he is. He is an adult now. He can face the consequences.|`|c43c4f873b96d5b8ae08c90457ffed18aa	Your son made some bad choices, and the ones he made as an adult at 17 tells about his character. You owe him nothing else.    Protect your daughter and your marriage. He is a pedophile, and that is not going to change, no matter how much he swears.    You can love him from a distance, and never trust him. Again, remember that he is now grown and you owe him nothing else. Don't let him make you feel guilt for his self-made problems.    God bless you. You were handled a full plate of problems and seem to have done well.    Take care.|`|OngBk4Ejaa	after all he is your son, and you do have a right to be scared, he must be 20 something right now.. he should just buy his own apartment.. i wouldnt let him move in with me.|`|AA11226842	You have to ask? I think you should give your son tough love and protect your daughter at the same time. Do not let him in.|`|vupWa0eXaa	Until you can fully trust your son, I dont think you should let him come live with you guys. Of course you still love him, as a mother would do, and want to help him, but you still got a little girl to think about. Shes getting older, and you dont want her to go though anything that could impact her life harshly. think about it|`|a098e04dab579014d54e37f6c5d16362aa	maybe you could move into a split level house. for example, you get a big house and separate it into tow living areas. your son is with you, but gets his "big-boy" space. i hope this helps you out.|`|b7WEVGzXaa	ok well you should treat your son nd your daughter the same  you haven't seen your son for a longtime  spend time with him and give him love!!  thats all he wants and needs  he turns to that other stuff because he doesnt get ant love at home|`|60FT7Pzcaa	It seems like he has had plenty of chances. I believe in the old saying fool me once shame on you fool me twice shame on me. You shouldn't risk a good relationship with your husband and daughter for someone who has a pattern on being hurtful and deceitful. Tell him to live on his own for awhile or with someone else unitl you can see that he has truly changed. He should have to PROVE to you he has changed instead of just saying it over and over. Talk is cheap.|`|TWfuO1xoaa	its a tricky one - your daughter is a victim of a crime, shes your priority right now. Do what you think is best for her and your family, there is government and social support for people, if you are worried about your son, maybe you should consider seeking this out|`|boIRASS7aa	This is a no brainer.  Protect your daughter first.  He needs to prove himself some where else.  I don't see why anyone would judge you harshly.  We all have to make tough choices at some point.    Good luck and God bless.....|`|AA12396274	on this one you really should say no ,tell him he is a big boy and he will just have to take care of himself, you have your hands full with what you have,|`|bAP2JpD2aa	If you let him move in with you regradless of him being your son YOU'RE CRAZY!|`|lbt0ayPuaa	well just try it. i could be good. just try and keep a close eye on them.|`|pVaZty4Maa	don't let him move in, i mean you done everything you could for the boy, you have to think about your lil girl now, so don't let him move in bc it sounds like he will just kee making the mistakes over and over again, you could if you want try to get help for him......|`|oZpqEdI7aa	DENY HIM, dont let him in your home. He is untrustworthy, help him out with postive reinforcement, but dont shelter him, be honest with him, hopefully things will work out for the better that way|`|15FlstmHaa	i know that beating children is bad, but that doesnt mean you should never touch them, spanking is needed.  on day one, beat the hell out of him and tell him if he ever brings any harm to anyone in the house, or steals from you, you'll shoot him.  tha'ts what my grandpa did to my cousin, my cousin went to prison but he never stole anything from my grandpa.|`|uNd6OPCdaa	i think your story is a lie but if true i feel for you  dont take your son back(trust me)|`|Y9kHh7Ryaa	well i think you should make him get his own life he is old enough to get a life that is far from you three with no danger in the way and that he should never be close to you guys so he wont make any danger i know you told me not to judge but i think this is really sad so he should get his own house and go back to school!!!|`|LtlXSL51aa	I think you have already answered your question. He is a ADULT that should be able to provide for himself. There are tons of programs that he could get involved with that would steer him in the right direction.  Will he have parole/ probation  if so he may be able to go into a half way house. My personal opinion, being a mom of a son and 3 girls, never would I allow my son back into my home:( its hearbreaking that  you have been delt this hand , but know that you are not alone . Maybe you should find a group to join for some support. Its not easy to tell your child he can no longer be in you home.  Good luck:)|`|BtMerSOPaa	Although he is your son, he has these issues that cannot and will not benefit your daughter, you, or your husband. It sounds as if his situation is tough to fix. After he is out of jail, in my opinion, it is not a good idea for you to allow him to be around your daughter. He is grown up, has made his own mistakes, and must fix and learn from them for himself. You have to think about your daughter. If you let him around her, will this happen again? Will she trust you as her mother after allowing him to be around her? It is not healthy for anyone. If you do not allow him to live with you you will be doing the responsible and caring thing for everyone, even if it seems like you are not taking care of your son. He has to learn lessons without the crutch of somewhere to live. Once he feels secure in your home, things arise once again and who knows what could happen. Tough love needs to come from you for your son. You need to know that the positive must always outweigh the negative even if you feel bad for keeping him out of your house.|`|Y77wbUZxaa	well your son definitely needs your support..so don't take it away from him...I wouldn't really trust him either..but you just need to be attentive , don't let him feel alone in this...help him feel that you are there for him and that you will help him no matter what...|`|LknYI7FFaa	you should love your children no matter what, BUT if he done that to your daughter,his sister once all ready. The boy needs help. I would not let him move in. For your daughter safety. Its got to be hard to see your son like that, sorry to hear all that, wish I could give you good advice, Its easy for someone to say what to do, because its not there situation.|`|PsuPXzWpaa	Phew!  That's a hard one.  Okay, so, you haven't mentioned what kind of support structure is around besides you and your new husband?  Is he getting counseling?  Is he attending church?  What about you?  Are you seeing a counselor or do you have a clergy person you can speak too.  Someone who can give you a couple of hours to make this kind of decisions.  The amount of information you've supplied here makes it perilous to make any recommendations.      I'm extremely worried about the molestation - more so than the porn (most teens look at porn and since you don't indicate whether the pictures were of children or other teens - pictures of teen girls are also legally considered child porn - I can't determine how serious this all is.     I'm kind of curious though.  I do understand that you love your son, but it sounds like you want our permission to not allow him in your house.  I would point out that children don't just wake up at the age of 10 and be out of control.  The signs of trouble were on the wall long before that.  Did you get him counseling early?  Look, your family is in complete disarray.  I really encourage you and everyone in your family to seek counseling.|`|puEwA8Upaa	your situation is tough and I feel for you but I have to say your husband is right you stated your self  about agreeing with him personally I feel we are built with a sixth sense its our gut instinct if you kinda agree with your husband  its for a reason As a mother your job is to protect your children and allowing your son to reenter your home only places your daughter in harms way. You stated he is in big boy jail which I assume is prison for MEN, your son is now a man and with that he has responsiblities him self, If you still want a relationship with him that is your choice but remember you can still do so without him staying in your home. You can tell your self if I let him stay I wont leave him alone with my daughter but the reality is he found time before and more than likely will find it again. It will put undue stress on you and your relationship with your husband I personally feel it can only end bad for everyone|`|ZAqlySc1aa	I think you should let him get his own apartment. Don't put yourself, your daughter and your husband in a situation they cant defend themselves.|`|LsHkgexvaa	Your son needs help adjusting to his illness. The best thing for everyone would be a halfway house for sexual disfunction. He really needs the support of professionals and his family.Since you have recently married and have a daughter, it would be difficult on all your relationships. I don't think your son is "bad" but he has a illness that needs professional intervention. Best of luck to you and your family.
uETvGAAqaa	I've been dating my boyfriend for a little over a year. His job transferred him back to his hometown this summer. He has lots of old friends there and has spent a lot of his free time catching up with them - both girls and guys. I love him and trust him so I don't mind if he hangs out with his "girl" friends.. and I figure if he's not hiding anything from me, then he's not cheating. One of his girl-friends likes strip clubs even and I don't mind if he goes as long as he's looking not touching.<br>  You've got to trust him, or all of this will just keep making you crazy.|`|dYuK4JPEaa	Nope!|`|zU1jHBvuaa	no way. i personally dont think long distance relatioships ever work tbh.

There isn't much you can do when you're around a girl for a certain period of time. I was in a similiar situation, though the girl I was in love with had a boyfriend and wasn't a lesbian.

If she doesn't, then she has similiar feelings; if she resists, she probably still has feelings, but not quite ready to give in for anything physical like a kiss or more.<br>  <br>  Hope this helps.|`|PYB3rnY8aa	finally im not alone hahah <br>  i know what your going through, the thing is she likes how nice you are to her, no one else has treated her like you do not even the girls who are "supposedly" nicer than guys, and she gets jealous seeing you with other girls because she feels she wont be getting the same feelings your giving the other girls if you leave her side.|`|isiOn19Jaa	SHES GAY! it's so hard but...leave her be and find someone else, cos there will be someone else eventually, honestly. you can get over her, it will just take time.<br>  good luck!<br>  <br>  by the way....the reason she gets jealous is because she enjoys the boost she gets from you liking her and doesn't like it when other girls get it.|`|BVxu0P5Naa	you need to cut her loose.

qwY8iN5faa	Sometimes seeing an ex no matter how long its been since you ended it, sometimes its good to see him/her to get that closer and see how you really feel. You should see him and see how you feel when you get around him and go from there, but whatever probs that you guys had when you were together may determine if you should start it back up again whether it was something major or not. You both have to want it to go anywhere if that is the case. Good luck and I wish you all the best!!|`|KOX2J7uXaa	Well, I understand having closure is really important if it helps you move on and be ready for future relationships, but be careful not to get hurt again. Talking to him may be the ideal way to get the answers you need and to may be end on better terms, and you can do that over the phone instead of in person if it's better for you. Seeing him could be a bad idea though. If you aren't truly over him it will stir up those old feelings and you could end up falling victim to the past. Perhaps you keep chickening out because your subconscious is telling you not to do this. Can you really trust him after what he did to you before? If you really feel seeing him in person is the way you want to do this then make sure you are mentally ready. Choose a public place when it's maybe mid day where there is less chance of romance-unless that's what you want. It's just that you don't sound like you need or want a relationship with him again. Dress comfortable and casual and don't accept any of his advances, just keep it to the point, discussing the past and resolving your differences so you can move on. Have an excuse ready in your mind so if things don't go as planned you can leave. Also, make sure you aren't relying on him for transportation so you can get away when you are ready. Lastly, I would make it clear to him before setting another meeting, that you aren't interested in rekindling things just resolving them. This way next time you'll feel more prepared and won't be so anxious.|`|xrtdvGrMaa	Figure out what it will take to give you closure. Are you over this guy? If so, why not see him. If you are not over him...it may be difficult to supress feelings. This is a decision that only you can make for yourself.

WMR8hVlfaa	It's a matter of professionalism on the teaching assistant's part. Dating a student can bring all sorts of problems -- accusations of favouritism, issues with the student if things go sour. I don't think it's so much of a problem once the course has ended, but until then? Probably not a wise idea.<br>  <br>  (I am assuming, by the way, that you are talking about university-level. Anything lower should be obvious.)|`|plVXnjyVaa	Who knows...I had a pro explain it to me<br>  <br>  and my response was policies are<br>  <br>  like going to the washroom, you take them<br>  <br>  and flush them down the toilet.<br>  <br>  THEY DON'T WANT TO GET SUED.....<br>  <br>  YOU WOULD BE SURPISED WHAT PEOPLE<br>  <br>  DO OUT OF FEAR...........................|`|zmNg5YNQaa	It could compromise interests in school and maybe bias the teacher to the student's grades, put it this way, if a chick was having sex with her teacher in a relationship, don't you think he'd be inclined to give her good grades? Or if she was really bad.. bad grades.. lol.<br>  <br>  Ever since this one incident of a student vasltly younger than the teacher got married there has been a whole taboo with it even worse than before.|`|tWkw2DYwaa	it is just inappropriate.  their ages are probably far apart.. students may be underage. some may think they are getting special treatment from other students... etc....|`|0wScR1iSaa	Academic Integrity.|`|sp22WKTKaa	may be unfair when it comes to grading.|`|mXiTX0Hoaa	bc its wrong
kIGZ0Qq0aa	True love is mean that when you meet someone, look at them you feel like home and you want to spend the rest of your life with them, you want to have kids with them and probably you've never think about someone else.<br>  I had that feeling before but we cant be together...and yeah i always wish he is happy with whoever he may be with.|`|AA12270875	for me true love means you care for another person's happiness more than your own, no matter how painful the choice you face might be.. just like how you feel..

Por ejemplo me gusta mucho comer y leer, el cine y beber infusiones, entre ellas el mate. La cuestion es que no me bebo una taza de té sino un termo entero en una hora, por lo tanto sólo pongo una cucharadita de té para todo el termo, para que no me quite el sue?o. Como lo que quiero, pero como mucho, por eso me inflo a ensalada y fruta y yogurt,  no soy una persona obesa pero me sobran 10 kilos. Como me gusta leer me traigo de a cinco libros de la biblioteca, pero ya no empiezo tres libros a la vez, sino uno. Cuando me aburro hago otras cosas, como entrar en YR o buscar otras cosas que me interesan. Digamos que de a poco voy venciendo mi tendencia a caer en el vicio. La naturaleza y los a?os me ayudan porque tengo hipertensión por un lado y porque mi organismo no tolera excesos. Así es como dejé de beber mate, fué durísimo dejarlo. A cosas como el alcohol y el tabaco no me acercaría, ya que soy conciente de mis debilidades . No es malo conocerse, a mí me está salvando la vida.|`|jqfnqGoaaa	El Amor

Some guys may be shy and awkward because they naturally have that disposition or the girl is just so intimidating, or BOTH. Sometimes even confident and outgoing guys feel nervous around girls, and sometimes they don't. A lot of things can factor in. Maybe a guy likes a girl and he accidentally spilled something on her a couple years back...

I feel bad for you.  But here's what I say...I know you might be afraid to confront your friend that has a drinking and sex problem, but sooner or later he needs to get some help.  You can still be that persons friend because you would be helping them to stop their addiction(s).  If you try to get him some help then chances are he'll be mad at you but then he'll forget about it when he lives longer or gets over it.  When you stop drinking it adds another 10 years to your life in the end.  10 years he would have later if he stops now.  But seriously get him some help and he'll thank you later for saving his ***.  He will be mad at you at first but then he's going to love you.  Think of it this way... Would you rather have a mad friend or a dead friend?  There's your answer, if you want him to stay alive then get him some help as soon as possible.  It's like when a friend calls you to say that they are about to committ suicide that is a cry for help.  So help your friend by getting him some help.  If you like this answer mark me as the "Best Answer".  I've helped a lot of people like you.  I'm studying to be a Social Worker or a Pshyciatrist.  So I really hope this has helped you to find an answer.
wdlNtPBOaa	Are you both young people ??<br>  <br>  Maybe your friend is confused or doesn't know how to feel about the situation so she feels awkward and withdraws herself as a coping strategy.<br>  <br>  Enjoy your time while you're still together and make an honest effort to stay in touch after she leaves !!|`|QLbujqsDaa	I guess the hug embarrassed her!<br>  Some families are not demonstrative like this.<br>  Or maybe the friend is finding it hard to deal with the move and doesn't want to lose control.<br>  back off a bit.<br>  You could just give her your best wishes and say that it was a pleasure to know her.  You could offer your address !|`|AA11038294	Just ask her what's going on.

LPO8RlVdaa	Hi hun,<br>  <br>  I remember your first question on this, it sounds like you are doing completely the right thing and acting completely proffessional. <br>  <br>  First of all the groaning could be just because he is enjoying the massage, I know I groan sometimes. But the rest of his behaviour is completely unnacceptable. <br>  <br>  You have already laid down the proffessional boundaries to him and he keeps trying to push it, this is all down to him and it is out of order. If he comes in again I would take him as a client but the second he oversteps the line (with a comment, touching your arm etc) make it very clear to him that the proffessional boundary cannot be crossed and what he is doing is out of order, and say if it carries on you will refuse to take him as a client again (and you do have the right to refuse any client, if your boss says anything just refer to proffessional guidelines/boundaries) and stick to it. <br>  <br>  If it will be of any help to you, try reading the NMC (Nursing and Midwifery council's) guidelines on Nurse/patient relationships, I know it is a different proffession but the guidelines on ethical relationships and proffessionalism will be very similar and may be really helpful to you.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.nmc-uk.org/aDefault.aspx" rel="nofollow">http://www.nmc-uk.org/aDefault.aspx</a> <br>  <br>  As for your boyfriend I wouldn't say anything to him hun. Things like this are bound to happen from time to time, you have acted completely proffessionally so what would be the point of telling him and potentially causing problems?|`|0lefOvkSaa	You handled this fine by telling him you are attached.As for his groaning I can tell you I understand that because when you give a massage it really helps to untangle the knots in some body's body so do not misunderstand that as sexual.Of course he might be over doing it=let that go/As for telling your boyfriend it would be a mistake you will find this happens all the time and it is simply no big deal.If you start telling your boy friend every time it happens you will be opening a can of worms better left closed.As for him touching you avoid it or get use to it as it will happen all the time.Please also be aware that if you are good at your job you really are helping people so they are grateful and that means they might touch you as a way of saying thank you.|`|kAp2lRxpaa	you probably don't want to tell your bf unless you expect that guy to get the crap kicked out of him... your bf will be royally pissed so... unless you want your bf to take action... then by all means say hey i am having trouble with this customer at work... let him know the deal.. he'll get p.o.'ed then some teeth will be broken... otherwise i would say... tell this guy you are really uncomfortable with his actions or when he does come in and asks for you... you aren't there... you tell your co-workers and have them help you out... let them know how much he creeps you out...<br>  don't keep doing something that makes you uncomfortable...<br>  so good luck!|`|qL3dGTXDaa	Have the school explain that it is important to have students not always have the same client. The client has you in mind rather than the massage, Massages are an intimate experience. I have thought about making an advance toward my therapist but I did not want to risk being tossed to the floor naked. So, I just took in why I was there.|`|PdNE9j6Zaa	umm no, you dont tell your bf cause then he'll get right consious about your rubbing people at work and make you change carreers ...<br>  <br>  handle it like a big girl.<br>  kick em in the jewels.<br>  <br>  jk,<br>  <br>  no but really .. tell em to fucck off or you wont work with him again.|`|YlyOFrrKaa	Tell him how some *** hole pervert at work is keep on trying it on with you. Make sure you make out that you dont like it tho. Or your boyfriend might think wrong.<br>  Also ask a person or a boss at ur work place, and tell them you dont want to have to massage that guy anymore. <br>   <br>  Btw, telling ur boyfrined wud be good idea only becoz if he ever went to your work and saw that guy trying to touch you up, your boyfriend might think diffrently.|`|OvsJkVPuaa	As a woman if you dont like something you have all rights to stop it...so if you dont like what your client is doing tell him or dont serve him anymore....I dont think any good will come out of it by telling your BF...its going to open a whole new can of worms...Dont tell...As women we have to know how to solve problems on our own...<br>  <br>  Good Luck|`|d6bb91335d2d467b86fe9b280c4c812eaa	The only reason you wouldn't tell him is if you are afraid something is gonna happen. If nothing is gonna happen then there is no reason not to tell him.|`|vrkPjEZjaa	ignore him<br>  <br>  and then maybe tell the place where you work he's "molesting" you<br>  <br>  or just harressing you<br>  <br>  unless you like him?|`|aSnQscKZaa	tell ur bf...he has a right to know...and just tell the guy wen he comes to go to some one else because u have a client already......he sounds like a jerk|`|FPsR2xi7aa	I would take a remedial course in writing.|`|kISfCLOIaa	girl do you want him dead... lol get all the money out of him that you can get and don't worry about it|`|O5cEFIofaa	OMG AHAHAH! I hope ur boyfriend dosen't have anger issue or has a history of fighting cause if u were my gf, I would fu*c*king dust that guy lmao!|`|SVYI25Jlaa	being honest is normally the best way to go.  since you feel like this is a secret you're hiding from him, and you're obviously starting to be bothered by it, then yes, maybe you should tell him... unless he's the over-controlling type that takes everything out of porportion.  also, if you're feeling harassed, tell your superviser, who should be able to help you.|`|AA11943537	Don't tell your boyfriend - tell your boss instead.  This guy is making some advances to you he shouldn't.  If you keep turning you down, he might go to your boss and make stuff up.  Beat him to the punch and tell your boss the truthc.<br>  <br>  Than refuse to do anymore full body massages on the creep.  |`|0MDOKWq2aa	Dont tell your bofriend - it will only make him jealous for no reason since your dont plan on cheating.  Just make sure you make it real clear to this guy that you are hapily taken by not responding to his flirting in a flirty way.  Also you should probably tell your boss about this guy!|`|VT6npj9Zaa	nice, first off. he's a pervert. your gonna run into those at your job. but telling your Boyfriend. thats not needed. tell your boss about the guy and that you feel sexually harrassed by it. either way your 16 n your boyfriend is 26 lol. i dont think putting up with one pervert at work makes it right to date one.|`|7VqrO9Cvaa	Tell him you don't like it.<br>  And if he keeps doing what hes doing then tell him you will stop taking him as a client anymore.<br>  and if he still doesn't stop then tell your boyfriend<br>  or tell the cops<br>  because thats sexual harrassment.|`|hQDfLwb0aa	tell him in a kind gentle way stuff him up first so he's full then he won't bothered but if he pays attention i guess he'll go to the guys and beat him up like ****|`|07A3OFDFaa	he is probably married. and taking advantage of you.|`|ZCa2Q8b4aa	Just ask someone else to do it for you?<br>  Or just ignore it. <br>  <br>  or maybe you boyfriend can scare him ;)|`|b899b30cc441c5933664b05ace73e279aa	hes probly just trying to get in your pants. all he knows is you massage him and thats turning him on. id stay away from him.<br>  <br>  thats what id say if i was your BF but ya then id hunt him down and mess him up with my 40" Hardwood Daito.<br>  <br>  you really need to tell your boss because it could get bad later. my Gf was raped by a co-worker, if she would have seen the signs earler she could have avoided it. be carful and take legal action if you have to. that guys got his head in the gutter and hes gonna try and drag you in to the dirt with him.|`|AA11441704	tell him stop.........losing him is better than losing your bf.
jBxW6ee9aa	Be strong  girl!! At first It could be akward but who knows maybe you'll hit it off with him. That is, if you still like him. Have faith in your self I am sure you'll be fine. Hope this helps.|`|0599mRRCaa	say hi to him, and see what he sais back. you don't need to be prepared to meet him, just trust your instincts. showing too much affection could turn him off. be natural and cool. make him to make the first move. men love to be in charge.|`|dPULl5hjaa	say "hi" and move on - sit down and enjoy the game!  No conversation is required!  Be mature about it.
gTmbLqGJaa	Tell them, hey, it's your money. It's not rude to tell them your opinion on the platform situation, tell them that both Linux and Mac are good, but windows is the widely used platform. Since they have someone that is knowledgeable of mac and Linux (AKA you). I would tell them get what you think you need, but if you get windows, prepare to have some trouble.

gNqVzt0iaa	Unfortunately it happens, i have gone through this twice with my mom. Sometimes people just need to go their seperate ways. Your dad will always be there for you no matter what. But would you really want them to stay together and be sad?<br>  <br>  One day when your a bit older and having proper relationships it will all make sense to you.<br>  <br>  Talk to your parents and explain your fears of losing them, people say things in the heat of the moment they dont mean.<br>  <br>  But if it comes down to it, support them in their choice and dont be affraid to ask them for support in return. Parents often forget the hurt it can cause a child.<br>  <br>  Take care and goodluck x|`|frFiiT8Aaa	that'ss sad, but to be honest, if they are not getting on, then its better if they do split,if your dad loves you enough, he will make every effort to see you from time to time,besides, you could stay with him every so often.,try not to take sides,just stay out of it,|`|7B5J0C92aa	i know its really really hard but think about it and how much better it'll be for them. they will be less stressed and will have more time for you..<br>  <br>  i hated every moment of my parents divorce but i guess you just have to look at whats best for them and forget about yourself. as long as they are happy you should be ok.|`|kfV8s0cSaa	they just might need some ttime alone...<br>  <br>  maybe later you could talk to your mom about it.. maybe she willl tell wat is gong on with them..<br>  <br>  or u can somehow try to get them to go to marrage counsiling.<br>  im so sory.. its reallly hard but u lern to deal with it|`|bWyaCP4Gaa	back
zxQT3Uo5aa	As you describe it, you are already co-dependent.  Yes he does have an alcohol problem.  Person without one may have difficulty expressing themselves but they do not intoxicate themselves to be able to do so.    You are setting yourself up for a life of misery which may lead you to drink also, or keep making up excuses to excuse him and belittle the problem      Find AA and try to get help for him and please go too...as his support.|`|rcut6bhoaa	Some people are like that,  but often relationships will end because of lack of communication.  Maybe there is something in the past that is why he is like this.        My soon to be "X" is like that,  keeps everything bottled up like a little girl in the corner waiting for life to pass her by.      Maybe try getting him to go to a counselor to see if they may be able to help him open up some.|`|bO2rzfISaa	He is not an emotional person, and doesn't talk about his feelings much.|`|OBCvewW2aa	I feel the same way about mine when he's high.    /only like him when he's high|`|AA12085256	Whether you want to hear this or not...it sounds like your fiance' has a drinking problem.  He needs to seek help for the drinking and for his lack of communication skills and you need to stop enabling him.|`|pErRGYH7aa	He's an alcoholic in training who is using alcohol as a crutch for expressing and dealing with his own feelings.  If he is unable to express himself without alcohol, he needs to learn, but this is a very common excuse for people who abuse alcohol.  Unless he gets help with his emotional issues, you're going to end up with an alcoholic husband.  Nip it in the bud and get him into counseling.|`|hXQjnPuGaa	Maybe when he's sober, he's thinking about it, but doesn't feel like it's a big enough deal to bring it up.      I'm like that too kinda.   I know people that will freak out and have a huge fight over supid petty thinks, like "he said she said, she's a *****" type stuff. They'll scream, and shout, and get restraining orders over it, and i don't understand that sort of thing at all.  It's just not important.   But if i'm drunk, then i'll go nuts and get really angry over stupid things too.   Or like if I'm really good friends with someon, I assume they know that when I'm sober. But when I get drunk, i'll go up to them and giv them a big hug and say "I ******* love you!!" and i'll just go on and on to them about how great they are.      Some people just act differently when they're drunk.    it might be a good Idea to take him to a counselor like that other person said. But I wouldn't worry about it to much, myself.

Es cierto, ellos no tienen la culpa, pero tampoco tienes por qué aceptarlo. Tal vez ahora te digas que lo perdonas, pero muy en el fondo te dolerá la traición que hizo.<br>  <br>  Si yo estuviera en tu lugar, dejaría a ese hombre, agarraría a mis hijos y lo mandaría al diablo que es lo que se merece y les daría ejemplo a mis hijos que a las mujeres SE LES RESPETA.<br>  <br>  Yo se que es difícil y es muy cómodo dar consejos sin estar en la situación, pero fíjate, la mayoría aquí escribe que él no es lo mejor para tí...digamos que nos guía el sentido común.

Y buscá un hombre que realmente te respete. Los chiquitos no tienen nada que ver.|`|WWIcsLg7aa	Mira respecto a si se puede olvidar y perdonar una infidelidad como la de tu esposo, eso depende únicamente de ti. Mi consejo es que quien enga?a una vez, vuelve a hacerlo de nuevo. <br>  Respecto a sus otros dos hijos, te recomiendo hables con tus hijos de la situación para evitar sorpresas en un futuro.<br>  No tengas miedo de sacar a tus hijos adelante, tu puedes hacerlo, de lo contrario estarías aceptando estar con un hombre que no te respeta y eso es lo que ense?arias a tus hijos, te lo digo x experiencia.<br>  Mucha suerte en tu decisión!!!!!|`|dbe6de6f14bdba4c0f9f792dba4f2fc9aa	pues como mi abuelita decia, Yo soy la Catedral y las otras apenas si llegan a capillitas, o se que si amas a tu esposo, pues sigue amandolo y hablale claro que tome una decisión el hecho que tenga más hijos no quiere decir que no te ame,  porque esta contigo no?, los otros chavitos no tienen la culpa, si no los amas, tampoco los desprecies, y que tu marido cumpla con todos sus hijos y contigo que eres su esposa, las otras mujeres no existen.|`|qo67ji3vaa	NO

Hw would you feel?? <br>  <br>  Good Luck!|`|6T8pbWa1aa	As long as he doesn't try to push the subject, I don't see the need to tell your husband.|`|9kyOU0z7aa	I definately think that you should tell your husband, and i do think you need to talk to your friend and let him know he can't just stay back and not pursue his opprotunity because of an unavailable woman....yes what happened was probably very shocking and very flattering but if he is only a friend to you he can't be led on otherwise and he needs to know he does not have a shot at taking you away from your family that you love...i really hope you can remain friends with him and i hope my advice helps at least somewhat...it's just my opinion i have never had anything like that happen to me....good luck:)|`|7eEFKDrOaa	Well the only person who knows you husband is you! If hes the jealous type, then no! don't tell him!!...But if he has no insecurities then, I'd say yes, tell him, besides it will make him realize just how much of a lucky man he is!!!!<br>  <br>  I hope this helped!|`|iOqmoIrcaa	You accept the compliment and let it end there.  There is no reason to tell your husband.  It might upset him for no reason.  The guy is moving away, so say thank you, I hope your new location works for you.  Period.  Don't lead him on by going on and on about this.|`|ORG5UjGyaa	Be honest, and talk about this with your husband. How would you feel, if the same situation was presented to your husband? It sounds like infatuation, really. Tell your co-worker that you're happily married, and that he'll have to face the fact that you aren't available. Do you really want to break-up your marriage over something like this? Ultimately, it's your choice, but I would think long, and hard before walking down that road. I hope this helps.|`|WXSL7e9Aaa	first of all... if your married<br>  you should know.. but you obviosly dont!<br>  that your not supposed to flirt with your co workers!<br>  thats so skankish! eww what the heck where you thinking?<br>  <br>  get rid of him!<br>  marriage is a commitment! <br>  you cant back out on it<br>  thats why there are so many divorces..<br>  and god damn broken familys.<br>  <br>  <br>  GET RID OF YOUR FLIRTATIOUS CO WORKER|`|AA10373401	u don't have to tell your husband everything, well unless he persist on doing that again.|`|z8qqKPgqaa	tell him you are happily married and just want to be friends.<br>  DONT tell your husband, it will only start trouble.
zXwE0ALKaa	baha. usually my friends would always come up with random inside jokes, and if one of them has a word in them that reminds you of everyone, like if you say that word and all of a sudden the whole group pops into your mind, it must be the word! maybe yours could be THE MANIAC SWINGDANCERS or something weird like that. :D|`|yE1Rza5Zaa	The Posers....loser.|`|ZWLKim09aa	bootylicouse<br>  <br>  |`|oDgnXJB8aa	Do-right-Dudes<br>  Hey not bad for a fifty five year ole granny uh?<br>  |`|I0ROwm6vaa	well,
AA11249599	If he does not like you he will never like you. So leave it be and find someone who does like and appreciate you.|`|n8vBnA9Iaa	He doesn't like you. Remind yourself of who you are, and find another guy. There is no point liking him when you have no chance. Yeah its hard and it hurts but you know what, he isn't worth it. Why pine over this Kevin when you could be having a lot of fun with someone else? Get out of " your woe is me attitude"  becasue there are so many other great guys out there. Why waste your time and energy on someone who doesn't want you...think about it. Do you think he's thinking about you? Chase someone who wants you.<br>  I don't know how old you are...but I was young once too, and  there are some hard lessons to learn, especially when it comes to love. You will be over him in no time. It happens. Rest easy and again, remind yourself of who you are.|`|kdmhuVTEaa	You can't change people's feelings i'm afraid. Maybe you should move on i know it is hard but sometimes it's best to forget. It's a sad fact of life i suppose and i'm sorry it's happened to you.|`|VuG1lKcPaa	He's just one boy. Girl you will find someone who loves you. But you just have to be patient. And don't go LOOKING for someone. Because you'll def. get your heart broken a bunch of times. Just get over it. You will eventually. Like they say. There are plenty of fish in the sea lol.|`|XqG45fBlaa	Get over him. He doesnt like you and you dont love him. Its just a crush. Even so, it still is very hard to get over him. I completely understand you. I had alot of those when I was a teen also. But you need to move on, stop hurting yourself.|`|YARlDa1zaa	move on, ur beautifull. is not worth it.|`|rBb1FFtlaa	get over him, and like another guy.
AA11204355	he might be married, or he might be hiding dead bodies in his basement . either way NOT A GOOD LOOK. He may have just dealt with a crazy female in the past and she stalked him. but he needs to get over it by now. you have been together for a year. if he doesnt feel he can trust you knowing where he lives then, he prolly doesnt trust you about a lot of things.<br>  <br>  I think he is hiding something. I would tell him to fess up or let that go. thats just too strange.  HIS OWN BROTHERS dont know where he lives? that would signify to me homeboy has some serious ISSUES he might need professional help for.|`|4fC6EJWfaa	He probably just has a kid and isn't married, doesn't really want to get the kid involved too much...<br>  <br>  Do you know whereabouts he lives? not the address but the city? Maybe he's of no fixed address. This man seems to be hiding a lot from you, tell him to come clean or dump him...|`|B12E4rYiaa	Even his own brothers don't know where he lives sounds kind of far fetched. Why mess with it? Change your phone number and move so that you don't waste any more of your life with someone who is playing games. If you're stuck with him how are you going to meet the right one.|`|EvDmgWjvaa	Only someone who knows him can find out for sure.<br>  Real name and place of employment if known you can find out many things. Same as going to DMV with his car license plate number you can get real given numbers and home addresses<br>  Its all there, but if you have never been over to his home, something is odd. Id find out asap or walk away|`|ehcZAmUVaa	That was a way of baiting you and you bought. Dont worry most people do this but you fell for it in my opinion you should leave him or just be friends considering he does not want to let you fully in his life. You cant and never will change him.|`|agTCqkLDaa	This whole situation, regardless of if he's married or not, screams RED FLAG...|`|4dXcZhuTaa	break it off.<br>  he's a creep.|`|HUsv9VU9aa	Tell him you wanna know where he lives or it's over. It's as simple as that. Tell him you think his married and your not stupid. If you really love him tell him you want to meet the 9 yr old son. And when you see the 9 yr old son. Get him alone and ask the little boy questions and take some candy! You'll get the truth. Sooner or later the truth will come out. But i'm quite sure your man is married or with the baby mamma!<br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|nAYfU1Gdaa	Google his name and see what comes up. People with secrets always have something to hide, and I doubt it is what you are looking for in a relationship. If he can't trust you enough to be honest, you don't even have a relationship.|`|bDQYtMHfaa	No matter what his status is, ask him. Let him know that you are suspicious & need him to open up if the relationship is going to work. If not , dump him. Spare yourself the agony later|`|vt7Ir47raa	sounds like he is using your feelings for he's own benifit. If you have doutbs then theres probly something to your feelings. BE CAREFUL|`|mtOVRAnbaa	If you have been dating for a year and he cant even show you all of his life.. (but he can let you around his 9 year old??) BREAK IT OFF... seriously... Real relationships cannot be built on lies and deceit !!|`|trVtzbOpaa	DUMP HIM <br>  MILDRED SENT ME HERE TO HELP YOU|`|iU1yT9LXaa	stalk him or something....he's def hiding something...and it's being 1 yr??? plss dont waste ur time anymore...
lXE75yQjaa	I think you should challenge her to a fight. I mean, you are a a tough girl..show her who's boss. Beyotch slap her around a bit. Fight for your son! (Oh, and please read my book)|`|dRpiIZ2Faa	STOP TRYING TO CONTROL HIM! he's  thirty for gods sake if he likes her it doesn't meen you have to , let him live his own life if you dont he'll turn into a mammas boy and then he'll end up living alone all his life|`|709c6903bb9d12e5785ce1c84dd91533aa	Why dont you like her? If your son really loves her, you should just let them go. It is hard for parents to get involved in their children's relationship. As long as she is not a bad person and really care and loves your son, it is all matters.|`|dbe725df593f5e17b67ac77e5efbbfd8aa	Just keep being yourself.<br>  <br>  That'd be enough to scare me off.|`|256fe92c1f48eeee32f2750edc89baafaa	Is his name Norman?  Do you own a hotel?  Don't worry, he'll never leave you.|`|wc5MjKZvaa	thts a really weird sort of jealousy u got there.....|`|olo624U6aa	Well, it seems like you may have some type of mother son jealousy thing going on. <br>  <br>  I don't think you should scare her away, just because your not happy with her does not mean your son is too. I think the most mature thing to do is let your son live his life-if he feels as though your doing this to him-he may despise you in the long run and will never feel like he can open up to you. <br>  <br>  Let him make his own mistakes ,that's how kids learn in life. You can tell him how you feel but I wouldn't plot on how to scare her away! Good luck!|`|e1Yqm8z8aa	well, it depends, why dont you like her? if its just becuase you want your son to yourself you need to take a step back and reevaluate the situation. if he truly loves her and she him. AND they are happy with each other then why try to break them up? i understand that you want him to be your little boy still but think about if your mother or father had tried to hold you back. then you wouldn't have your son! just step back and look at it this way. you are NOT losing your son. you are gaining a daughter! unless she isnt a good person and she doesn't treat your son well! but you still need to let him deal with it for the most he is a grown man and needs to make his own decisions even if they turn out to be mistakes! think about it before you do anything to push your son away because if he loves this girl and you keep being mean to her you are only going to push him away! good luck! and remember if you love your son you need to let him go so that he can live his own life!|`|K4mDGJ0Zaa	Stop being mean to her. Become her new best friend. Take them out for dinner to nice places if she appears to be lacking in manners.  Take them to museums if she thinks Monet is a brand of jewelery.  Attempt to show her to him through your eyes, but be sweeter than she is. <br>  <br>  But sons are supposed to move on not move backward. You know that. Start finding ways to live your life and allow him to live his. If you don't, you'll lose him completely. You know that also. You may get rid of this girl, but there will be others.|`|racnq84Vaa	You should put the breasts back in the bra and stop him from continuing to hang on to the nipple.  Time for you both to grow up.  Unless you plan on marrying him and having sex with him, he is gonna have a female other than you in his life.<br>  <br>  Perhaps you should find a life of your own.|`|JmeYK303aa	ok, let him and her be. he needs to figure this one out for himeself. you have probably tried to encourage him to dump her for a while now. if he hasn't by now then you need to let him figure it out for himeself. he will. give it time.|`|hAzokvWfaa	A hockey goalie's mask and a chain saw might just be the ticket to drive her away for good, and then you can have mommy's little baby all to yourself again.|`|vFF2cEHfaa	wow I would be kinda scared if I were your son. That sounds kinda creepy and your picture doesnt help. Hopefully you dont.... ummmmm nevermind I dont want to be reported for saying something bad|`|HFhLU69zaa	he is a teenager and you should know how he feels to love someone. let them be, talk to your son, go on a vacation.|`|pFgNqvBKaa	let your son be who he is. you are just another case of a MONSTER IN LAW. you son and her must really like eacother so just sit tight and wait for it to end.|`|UTOTmjRjaa	keep controlling him, dont cut that apron strings, wait till you get old and die, he be the loner forever, and congratulations for that|`|NAKYRvwqaa	He should be out of the house by now and running his own life.|`|hSCVuHsPaa	IF YOU LOVE SOMETHING, YOU SET IT FREE|`|eaSX0DBGaa	do you want to root him or sumthing          this is freaky.|`|1H2Q605Raa	let it go
AD5epFi0aa	Some guys think its ok to talk with friends about this type of stuff.  If you don't feel comfortable about it, then you need to set boundaries with him.  Tell him this subject is off limits.<br>  Alot of people share porno movies & pics.  To them no big deal.<br>  He may or may not be doing doing it behind his girlfriend back, I don't know.  <br>  The thing that worried me if you get into these types of topics with him and he gets horney with you, that he doesn't try to do some type of advances on you.  That's why I strongly think you should set boundaries and tell him your uncomfortable with this.|`|ba808642a0667193fc002c2bbda18db5aa	Right on!  Mabye it was even alot inappropriate.  This guy would have given me the 'creeps'.  The good thing is this guy is out of state and most of your contact has been over the phone or the internet.  I think I'd forget about the idea of getting to know him any better at this point.  good luck|`|70JTOlkkaa	ummm yeah....i think it is very inappropriate.  DO NOT DO IT!  these people who ask for pics and vids end up sharing them with others and sometimes put them online for everyone to see.  i would not have contact with him, he has a girlfriend for one...and he sounds like he 'likes' you for one reason...and i think you know what that is.  you sound like a smart girl and know what is right for you...good luck.|`|AA11186157	Okay, I'm going to be blunt with this. He's looking for a booty call./Or Bail Out Suddenly he has a lady after getting to know you, he's looking for a way out of that relationship, then asking you inapproprite questions related to sex, I get that feeling right off the bat, you seem quite smart, so stand your ground and tell him you don't like it, if that is your choice but if I was you I would end the friendship now.|`|KV1D4Bygaa	Yeah i agree with you that is a little bit odd, but i guess its understandable since he's a guy.  I would tell him not to send that stuff to me and if he doesnt stop then just block him from emailing you because he already has a girlfriend and you dont want to cause anything to happen between them|`|P192hA5Eaa	He's a bastard and you should tell his girlfriend. Back up your fellow woman and let her know her boyfriend is scum. You'd want someone to do the same for you|`|MxWsPoJjaa	Stop talking to him, he is just a horny guy wanting to see you naked.|`|YK8Bn3Claa	i personally think thats inappropriate too, all u gotta to is tell him the boundaries|`|7yjLcfo1aa	hes just a boy with a *****
AA11629314	Did u ever think that he don't b actin right because you have a "sidekick?"  Do you think he doesn't know?  Or better yet, what if he has a sidekick because you have one?  You may love him but not as much as you love yourself.  That is a pretty selfish mindset to have.  What relationship doesn't have rocky moments?  Are you gonna just run to your sidekick EVERYTIME you butt heads?  That isn't healthy, that only makes things worse.  That time spent with your sidekick could be used on mending and making up.  Even if you  aren't having sex you are still cheating emotionally.  Love is a selfLESS emotion, it just won't work if you can't look past yourself when with that one.<br>  <br>  Good Luck!!|`|7lpFlUDTaa	I recommend it!  Making more friends will help in not making your boyfriend your entire focus in life. <br>  <br>  However if you aren't looking for a physical relationship with your 'sidekick' I would warn you to make that completely clear when you hang out with them, maybe get someone who already is dating someone, because single guys who have girls hanging out with them are likely to think that the girl is interested in him in a romantic sense.|`|KFu0mGt1aa	If you have to wonder if your boyfriend is cheating you don't need to be with him. On the other hand you are not right for  having a side kick. If you and this other guy are talking like friends then why is he a sidekick and not just a friend? If you are not doing anything then he's just a friend or is he?|`|iLboSX3Aaa	i think that that is a horrible idea, you are gonna be leading on one guy, while being unfaithful to another guy. Relationships have their ups and downs. Thats what a relationship is. If you really love the guy, work on it. Don't get another guy for backup just incase something happens. In the end when they both find out and i bet you they will. You will lose a boyfriend and a friend|`|7pu16Iazaa	sounds like you guyes have some kind of communication problem. Also, its not right to talk to someone then stop talking to them because you have to blow some steam.|`|Pul4Qhqraa	Lol i'd dump ya if ya did that.  You gonna go chill with some other dude cos you don't agree with me about somat pffft. I ain't gonna respect any girl acts like that.<br>  <br>  Maybe i'd keep her on the side till I found someone better, but probably not.|`|Y0WD46mYaa	Not wise.|`|PYB3rnY8aa	lol im sorry but till you have proof that hes cheating this is a stupid thing.. seemes to me like your the unfaithful one..|`|cpZOqe5waa	Ok, um no? UK SUX!!|`|jYDqknIvaa	Good idea.  It's a shame more girls aren't as smart as you.|`|mDQZnI7gaa	No no sidekick. If youre worried about him being faithful to you why would you get a sidekick on him?  Dont stoop down to his level.  Just break up with him or tell him straight up how you feel and what you think hes doing.  Youre young anyway.  You shouldnt get into any committments. Stay single and have friends, network, trust me, it wont last anyway especially at the way its going now.|`|MX1shAbcaa	Well you do have friend right, why not just talk to them...I don't think you should be plannining another relationship while you're in one.<br>  Then again, life's too short, if this would make you happy... then do it.<br>  Everything you think  may make you happy may not, keep that in mind.<br>  Good luck ~ William.|`|b75bba675dda73187aeb83430b085b44aa	You're too young to date just one person.  Get out there and meet some men and just be yourself.  Worry about education and career right now and relationships later.|`|AA11558572	You are asking for trouble and will lose your friend and your boyfriend.
MLblb028aa	there's nothing wrong if you fantasized your best friend after all he's a guy and he's someone u'd known for awhile.there's nothing wrong also if ur best friend used to like him.but the thing is,he might not want it to be like that.he might not like it that u would fall for him coz it might scare him away or the other way around.but there's still no harm in trying though.lolz.wat i can suggest is not to entertain whatever u are feeling.maybe its just purely admiration of his real being and the way he treats u as a friend.somehow ur wanting that if ud be with a guy hope he would be as kind and loving as ur bestfriend.gudluck!|`|Y8EkzFHjaa	I've had this problem happen once.<br>  <br>  I had a best friend who I liked, and he liked me.

It will pay off in a long run.|`|62269f46091acb9253bd8877713e550baa	Well, sounds like you've got to set your priorities straight. Sounds like you're really into the guy.|`|1q7JFD1Iaa	test the waters.... to avoid ruining what you have.. if it goes well .. . good times.. if not you didn't mess up what you have|`|wdinukuWaa	well she USED to like him.

yyn7nFKWaa	sounds like he wants to be friends... if you want him, tell him... :D|`|96196a444ea23070021630b1488416cbaa	Maybe he is shy in front of a crowd and/or maybe he he is taking things slowly because he was going to fast in the other relationships. I think you should be patient.|`|0RM8VwNQaa	guys lie when they like a girl<br>  "straiahgt forward " yah right<br>  he lied andprob likes all the signals add up
FlrVPdWfaa	Neither.  A relationship should be a partnership and one completes the other where one is lacking.  If dominance is the question, then there is no true relationship.  It should be a give and take and never my way or the highway.|`|oiY1Hpcaaa	I'd say female.<br>  But males like to be dominant.<br>  But I say female.|`|0a10b458d661d00b6ca07ad7e4b327b6aa	opposites attract but like minds seem to bond. in a relationship, the domination is flexible, is more or less a shared lead. I hope that ypu can understand this, but a relationship is more than domination, it is a continued commitment that will ultimately benefit both parties. sometimes one person can be acertive better than the other, think about a samba.|`|84sYXLk6aa	There should not be dominant in a relationship between two people. you should both compromise and respect each other. now if you are meaning Marriage when you say relationship, then according to King James Bible, God made man first, then woman, so the man would be the head over his household.|`|CQR11hKlaa	the female, cause she is the one who has to deal with their water breaking and having to push out the baby.
9ae557afae8c72a2f03fc0f5b4f78564aa	Maybe you just aren't clicking with these new friends. If they aren't inviting you to go places with them, then maybe you should try and find new friends.|`|LkfXCh3Zaa	Well do you really like them that much? Because honestly sweetie they don't seem like the nicest girls around. Try finding some new people to hang out....ones you can be yourself and act crazy and have mutual conversations with. Don't be afraid to hang out with new people =))|`|1663aacaf477ab5d8cb4705d60ab324faa	Well maybe you're just hanging out with the wrong group of friends. You probably don't feel included because you don't share the same views, topics or even the same personality with them...Just try to expand yourself and make new friends...good luck dear!|`|LTFXZcE7aa	If you are feeling left out ask yourself "are these really your friends?"|`|fb0e6ee443fc42488c552557d2231b78aa	i dont beleive they are your friends and i dont beleive they dont like u|`|1cc45714beafef23459d79e852dec489aa	I know how this can feel and it can be hurtful.  What you have to ask yourself is if they were true friends why do they make you feel bad or like the occasional third wheel?  True friendship is fulfilling and you feel supported not made to feel like an outcast, and this has nothing to do with your shyness, I  know a lot of people that are shy that have good friendships.  Remember you don't have to give up who you are or your feelings just to have people like you.  Sometimes you have to let go of unworthy people to make room for the ones who are good for you.  Good luck in how you choose to deal with this.
EKw6Klhgaa	yes its not like she can help it|`|4HoVVCenaa	Yes, Don't be afraid of "honest" sweat, it has pheromones in that attract the opposite sex. But it can't be BO. This is the reason that a deodorant is better when dating than an anti-perspirant, contrary to the advertising. It is the reason that men are attracted to sweating girl athletes when playing together.|`|60e2jimDaa	uh yea who cares about that?|`|fVa3mERxaa	yes its natural and my hands get swaty 2|`|45f1360efad547282be68b1242ba3452aa	Sure I would.

siOVI0bjaa	You know you want to, so just go...|`|oDgnXJB8aa	Nothing wrong in him calling you lil girl, you have taken it the wrong way, It would be the same if he called you baby, right? same thing. <br>  Go meet him and wear little make up as you can, guys don't like girls with alot of make up. Wear some jeans and a cool top or sweater if it's cold.<br>  Good luck|`|lu0rHF43aa	He's older,smarter,and more mature than you.he just wants to bang you,mess with your head,and ruin your life forever.run!|`|NZg7cvLcaa	Just go and be yourself<br>  his problem if he dont like u and he thinks ur young.<br>  
q8eHw75Faa	I think he cares about you he just isn't good with his money, and for the record you can have a lot of fun without spending money like having a movie night at yours or his place or just hanging out with friends or going to the beach at night.... If you want to help him see if you can find a book or class that helps with money management.
C7sc1Dqaaa	No... You dont need to know how to dance inorder to get a girl, you need confidence... f*** dancing... have balls|`|5klYhhqNaa	no|`|5u7MlKfHaa	Well, it is kinda weird to meet someone at a club and then to see that they can't dance, can be a bummer.|`|9XsTLSEeaa	just dance...people will barely notice your dancing!|`|BWZZN8ZAaa	No it is not stupid at all.  I am sure that you will find some nice ladies who would be only too happy to help you to learn to dance.  It would only be stupid if you just stood and watched all night!!<br>  <br>  Go, have a great time and I hope you met the girl of your dreams.  It is bettter that going to bars and pubs etc.<br>  Happy dancing.|`|JFaLLMLCaa	not at all|`|Rp7O3Wsmaa	i aint a ladie <br>  <br>  but what wrong with that not dancing but having a chance to meet some fcuking sexy girls that will pleasure you with a one night stand|`|SmlCCqXRaa	No, not at all.  At least you're not trying to meet girls on the internet.|`|T68SVPZraa	I met my husband at a club 8 years ago. He was a shocking dancer maybe that's why i fell for him, thought he needed some help, lol. <br>   I think if you don't have the courage to stand there and just bop then you need to make sure you have a nice smile, and that you are able to look at someone and just smile to let them know that you like them, They will let you know if they want to talk more by going up-to the bar where you should be standing/ sitting.|`|UHIySrg2aa	Not at all.<br>  Most people in the club probably won't be great dancers, but when you're drunk noone cares!<br>  If you want to pull a girl just offer to buy her a drink<br>  it works trust me ;)|`|ea6e861f02efbe475e33340ca6a879c3aa	I don't think so... I'd judge a guy more on his ability to talk than to cop a feel or rub up on me.|`|pXrcJ7aGaa	You don't have to dance, that's why there's always a bar! Just sit down and wait on a ledge! Lol.. Of course you need to have self-confidence, but not too much coz you might mess things up.|`|q4rFIH8eaa	no worries, just have fun hangin out....|`|zRQOIoAGaa	in reality clubs r rarely for dancing<br>  its single central!<br>  go for it, theres no hame in not being able to dance, some girls evn find it cute|`|5aKUV5afaa	No.  Some women don't dance or know how to.|`|TlCWyLImaa	Not really. I think it's cute when guys don't know how to dance but try to anyway and look goofy.<br>  Maybe that's just me.|`|4B7vXaVZaa	no...there are plenty of people who enjoy the club scene but can't or don't dance...the only obstacle you'll face is just that...she may want to dance with you...something you should be prepared for otherwise, try a different scene|`|7fea9483ab669b48946b2b7176d7532daa	yea|`|AA10508462	Not really. There are tons of guys who haven't danced before who go clubbing. You probably aren't as bad at dancing as you think you are - club dancing is really not so hard. But if you want to form more of a relationship with a woman, clubbing probably isn't the best way (although it can be).|`|n8x9fkHRaa	nah, not really. although i spose it would broaden your chances if u could dance.<br>  maybe go take some lessons, or ask ur friends.
gZVIiIxzaa	Bring your mom along, get her to translate....|`|lMKy9Ho8aa	say HI!!!!!|`|rLwRRYynaa	go up to him and say hello and ask if he would like to come some sort of club thing and ask if he will put his name down.  if he does then you got his name.  <br>  <br>  or you could always take the high road and go say,  "hi my name ----, whats yours?"|`|WR4cYLd4aa	You could go two ways:<br>  <br>  1. March up to him while he's in the hall and introduce yourself. This is mainly for superbold girls only. I personally am WAY too shy to try anything that wild, so there is an option 2.<br>  <br>  2. Bump into him on purpose, hard enough to knock something out of him arms or hands, and then apologize and take the moment when he's picking it up to say something witty like "Wow, maybe next time I'll bump into you on purpose." Implying that he is attractive. <br>  <br>  Just remember to exude confidence! Have fun.|`|Pe9HrBhbaa	just go up to him at lunch or during a break and say "hi im [insert your name here]  and then just talk....dont think about it that much or you are going to make yourself nervous   and you shouldn't be nervous|`|H2tTRW41aa	Hehe. It's usually the guys job in my opinion.<br>  <br>  Use some corny excuse. Like you have a pencil? Or did we have Hw?|`|lO3Py7Ciaa	That's easy sometime soon ask HIM his NAME. Its that easy take it slow especially when you go to the same school. Just talk to him when you get the chance and take your time, I can't stress that enough. Don't go out of your way to talk to him but find an excuse for the two of you to run into each other. Don't act desperate. Have confidence because if you think your cute he will feel that and find you attractive. If you are too afraid to ask him you could always make friends with one of his more accessible, but you could make that guy like you and complicate matters. <br>  <br>  Trust me asking his name NEVER hurts, people can speculate and wonder why but if no one knows your motives it adds a bit of mystery to it. You could ask his name flirt a bit and then stop and wait. He will come to you after that it may take a bit and if it doesn't come to you with in like 2 weeks try again. That will get him wondering and you may even catch him staring at you from time to time. Girls have done this to me and it drove me crazy, in a good way.|`|WEXS0y9qaa	kk u are talking to a pro! <br>  kk everytime u see him do the 3 second rule (eye contact for three seconds then look away) <br>  also Smile. Smiling is contagious. Gently brush his arm or something while passing, not too hard but just like it was an accident, it'll get him thinking. Don't be the kind of girl that sits in the corner and waits for the guy. if u see him by him self give him little flurt!!<br>  <br>  hope this helps!! |`|Dv8xIV6Uaa	If you don't wanna approach him it's easy. Make sure he knows that you're looking at him. Eye contact drives guys crazy. Eyes meeting across the room etc etc. seriously, try it n you can get most guys to come talk to you once they know you're interested|`|ZrZcQiSpaa	find something little, like put your 2 cents in about  something that happened at school, if you have a class with him.<br>  <br>  oh! and ask a friend or two about him, like his name and stuff.|`|Pw8wcD2baa	One very good way is to. Miss class then,on the next ask him what you missed. Doing this will ease the all nervs...I did it to a girl and we ended up talking all class!|`|NqgZ83oLaa	go up 2 him and just be ya self..<br>  say hi in the hallways <br>  and always smile..that always gets the boys attention..and thats when he shall realize something is up..|`|lylfNkLqaa	do you know anyone who knows him? because you should try to meet him through them <br>  otherwise just say hi! but you should probably try to find out his name first!|`|KIXlMOfTaa	Just walk up to him, introduce yourself and ask his name. |`|G6wbcMqvaa	if hes a friend of a friend have someone introduce you<br>  say hey watsup? when you pass him in the hallway|`|3wySV42jaa	bump into him and make his school books fall and help him :D that's how i met some one :P|`|rwnYwz3Paa	compliment his biceps or his cute shirt then go from there|`|PmGv9eCvaa	slap him on accident..then start from there
4FRDxbAEaa	I would call him back if I were you. For me, when say "I'll talk to you later" I Mean I will call them or i just say it after they say they will call me later. I would take the chance and call him, you have nothing to lose and only something to gain. I hope y'all get together! Good Luck!|`|pbdHWU5haa	if you told him ttyl that meanz yah ur supposed to call him back. so hurry and tell him "oops i forgot"or something...|`|vA1rJUDUaa	call him...you may be scared but what can you lose from it
SzQi9N7daa	Age is falsely regarded as maturity.  However, very few folks under 25 are mature enough to consider Love as more than good sex.  So carefully consider this question. Is the love you ask about simply because you have had sex? Love is so much more than fondling, kissing, and sex....<br>  <br>  The difference in age has less of an impact as you grow older.  Why? Because there is less to do with the physical aspect of a relationship and more to do with being a lover, a companion, and a friend.  Younger folks put oh so much emphasis on the lover part, and never really consider is this person my best friend, my compadre who will go where I go?|`|v398Qalyaa	love is not governed by numbers...the biggest age gap relationship i've hsd is 36 years...i was 20 at the time|`|370e691422f07fe796ab12f350d57094aa	Age is so important yes,but for love's matters there is not limit at all.<br>  Good question.|`|4SHr6i55aa	age is important depending the age. i was 12 and i had a 28 year old bf. that is a 16 age difference in a very important time factor. now if someone is 90 and the other one is 70 those 20 years aren't anything. so it depends. but if he treats you right, and you love him, and his intentions are well, then give it a shot.|`|C9QQPROkaa	You at least have to be 14 at least that's when i first fell in love. But no there really isn't a set age although there is puppy love which is way different. The biggest age difference ive had is the relationship im in now im 23 and he's 41 and we are completely in love.|`|JlyYRBCIaa	5 years|`|nrHJOILNaa	I don't really think their is an age limit for love.<br>  It just the matter of finding someone you love.<br>  Age isn't important but I'm sure there's plenty of people that would say otherwise.|`|xCqNTjGLaa	i dont think it matters as long as your both over 20
apXxSZvhaa	I dont blame you for being offended.  But your girlfriend should have told you herself that she needs space and some time to think about things.  The fact that you had to hear this through her friend shows how inmature she really is.<br>  <br>  You guys havent been together for all that long, so maybe thats why she got frightened when you said that you loved her.  Maybe she's afraid of commitment?  I wouldn't bother texting or trying to call her for a while, let her contact you.  And when she does, dont let her off the hook so easily.  No one deserves to have their feelings stomped on- and thats what she did to you.  <br>  <br>  She has some making up to do.  Let her know when she does come around again how this affected you.<br>  <br>  good luck|`|PIERZQUwaa	the thing is shes not ready for a committed relationship alot of girl do that you say you love them and they don't talk to you for a while and wen you ask wat she was up to and how come she didn't pick up ur call or call back and she gonna say she was busy or didn't have time or she was sick you didn't do anything to her <br>  next time you see her tell her again and ask her why didn't she reply and keep her there  till she answers <br>  <br>  i used to be one of those girls but maybe after you talk about it to her she change<br>  <br>  shes just scared |`|AwrOIp6yaa	dude, she's a woman and some of us will never understand why they do the silly **** they do.  she's too emotional, find someone that isn't so emotional and won't freak out when the love word is mentioned.|`|ZreHK5rvaa	She's prob scared to open her heart to you. Women get scared of the L word too, just like men. Give her some time. If she really cares about you she will come around. |`|wL7v53Unaa	Maybe she thinks its moving too fast or maybe she's had someone say that to her in the past and she's been hurt or let down by them.Or maybe she wasn't as serious about the relationship as you are and she doesn't want to hurt your feelings by letting you down.<br>  <br>  It could be any number or things the only way you're going to know is if you ask her,when she decides to talk to you,no one can predict what she's thinking.<br>  <br>  Dont call her and give her some space to think but put a time limit on how long you are going to wait for her to talk to you,otherwise you could be waiting a long time<br>  <br>  Either way its really immature of her and disrespectful of her to ignore you for a week without an explanation maybe shes too immature for the type of relationship you want with her<br>  <br>  I hope it all works out for you|`|5FCiKNaGaa	maybe she has been with sme1 who said that, then did it wth her then dumed her, and she doesnt want to happen again|`|OQOq7Owqaa	find another girl. maybe it was too soon for u express ur inner feelings. or she must have taken ur brief time together lightly|`|UCFuDjTaaa	She's scared...maybe committment issues as well|`|dmrilJ0uaa	Sounds like she's just not ready for that level of a relationship yet. I mean, it's not like you did anything wrong, especially if that is how you feel. But, and I hate to say it, there's not much you can do to make her feel the same way if she doesn't. Maybe ask to meet with her and tell her that you'd like to talk about what happened. Try to get an understanding about where she's coming from, and tell her your feelings about it all. Hope it goes well!|`|HNtEdoVpaa	Uhhm this is really confusing... I think that maybe she wants the attention. Like I'm sorry but lots of girls these days have this "pretty girl" attitude where they think they are the best and that they can get away with anything. Usually if someone does this they are looking for attention. I don't really know though. That's weird you might try asking her why she did that. (I would consider getting rid of her. I mean if she really wants you then why would she do that.) <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  The sad truth. Good luck though. |`|c0n2Rgkpaa	you told her you loved her after two weeks???? seriously??? and you want to know why she's pissed? She obviously doesn't feel quite that strongly about you yet. and by rushing things you've probably scared her. if she doesn't love you yet she's going to feel super guilty for not wanting to say it back. just give her some space and for god's sake don't mention the l word again for a while.|`|ye9Os1hdaa	thats how we are.<br>  stupid but true.<br>  <br>  give her some time, maybe till friday?<br>  then go straight up to her and say <br>  <br>  "listen i didnt mean to do anything wrong, and i want things back to normal.. can we try?"<br>  <br>  say it in a calm and nice tone so she knows your not mad, (even if you are just stay calm and sweet)<br>  <br>  if shes still acting weird just try and forget about it and try the next friday. and so on..<br>  dont bug her so much that she gets annoyed :)|`|6Ck5zn3xaa	Maybe you thought she was your girlfriend and she didn't see you as her boyfriend and she just does not share the same feelings that you do so I would just give her space and she'll come to you when she wants to explore your feelings further.|`|TXe8eL65aa	Maybe because she didn't wanna hear it yet she just probably needs time like her friend said just give her some time like a week and text her saying that you'll give her space but that u really do mean those feelings and that your not joking with her or playing with her emotions that those feelings r real for her|`|nJuexFXLaa	She got scared and needs space, give it to her. When she wanna talk she'll come to you. Some guys just throw those 3 special words around, not saying that you did, but maybe she was hurt in the past and doesn't know if you really mean it.<br>  <br>  Good luck !!! :)|`|vqXG20hKaa	i bet she just got a bit freaked out give hr some time and talk it over can you please answer my question <br>  <a href="http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;_ylt=AguaGYOZU8uhn6iS9p1vFUMazKIX;_ylv=3?qid=20081019185958AASCLnG">http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;...</a>|`|HtOqeOtkaa	HOW CAN U LOVER HER IF U BERLY HAVE 2 MONTHS WiT HER?/ BUt ANyWHO MAyBE THATS THE REASON WHy SHE GOT ALL FREAKED OUT...OR MAyBE SHE DONT KNOW HOW TO SAy i LOVE YOU BACK |`|7f8892ae1b07d4f8889cc1e90046112caa	The "L" word scared her, now she doesn't know how to come at you.|`|Rxemh0bcaa	maybe shes not ready to love back<br>  <br>  give her some space to think about watever she has to think<br>  |`|iGKoqBGfaa	Get rid of the girl - she sounds like a dumb bi---.|`|v4HbYrgYaa	thats weired|`|hFaPKK3jaa	wait for her-she just needs time|`|JDJ6ofTUaa	she may be a little freaked out about that...she may get over but i dont know the future....good luck!|`|a2Na3Abqaa	lol u scared the **** outta her,<br>  guys don't say the word l*ve|`|swNzTwUfaa	I think it's a possibility that she's afraid that you're just saying that. Or maybe she thinks that you're moving too fast. I definitely think she's just afraid of getting hurt--most likely overwhelmed with her emotions. She wants to feel so happy that you love her, but on the other side she doesn't want to get TOO connected in case something bad happens.<br>  <br>  You can't talk to her through her friends, but if it's a last resort, DO IT. Tell "her" that you have no idea what you did and if she doesn't start acting MATURE you're not going to be with her anymore. Because if I were you I'd kick her to the curb.|`|4NR5Ha5Saa	She went all mad and weird on you because you told her that you love her. Maybe she's not ready to say i love you back to you and she's worried and could be afraid of what you might say or do if she doesn't say it.<br>  <br>  I was in a similar situation, my boyfriend toldd me that he loved me after 3 weeks and I was so confused, i stopped talking to him cuz i thought to myself that i wasen't ready to say it back.<br>  <br>  Maybe you should give her some time.|`|mfN0MKYpaa	right, this girl is kind of weird to be honest, but maybe you need to leave her alone for a little while, wait till she contacts you, maybe you shouldn't text or ring her 4 a while, let her breathe, maybe its hard for her 2 take it in that you love her, maybe its the 1st time a lad has said they love her? you know ?  so maybe speak to her friend and get them to let you know when its best for you to speak to her?|`|hh6f7fqRaa	She might just be shocked. Or she might not think that you really do. Since she won't talk to you, try talking to one of her friends and see what it is that's going on. Maybe you could write her a note and have a friend give it to her. Just say that if you scared her you didn't mean to or something along those lines. I hope that helps.|`|JzWSXGoYaa	let me know how old you are and ill tell you what happened. if your under 21, chances are she is scarred confused, and worried. Let it go and take things as they come. Texting and calling her only makes you look desperate as if you did infact do something wrong. loving someone is not wrong. So chill until she realizes she is wrong here. <br>  good luck.|`|0FSOHQNUaa	HAH!<br>  buddy , she's just not ready for " i love you " <br>  Give her some personal space , and watch her say  "i love you too " <br>  Dude , It was juust akward .<br>  it ALWAYS is the first time you say it .. <br>  dont worry you'll devolp in time ,<br>  Sooner or later you'll be saying " i love you " Continuasly :) <br>  <br>  P.S <br>  for the guy that said .

She might have been abused by some one b4 & after they hurt her they could have said i love u. <br>  she might not believe u. idk hon. im having relationship proublems 2 :(|`|1b7Qys4maa	she probably felt rushed and pressured to say it. You should call her and tell her if shes not ready to say it she doesnt ahve to|`|D5Aj1RUVaa	Well first of all do you know her past? Maybe she has a a past bf that said that and destroyed her life. Secondly I don't think she is mad. Maybe she just wants to think about if you are right for her. After two months I would hold off saying " I love you" even if i felt it. You may have moved too fast for her. Maybe she isn't ready for that. She will eventually call you soon. She will not leav you hanging off the edge of a cliff unless she is just an ***, and I don't suspect she is. She is probably scared and doesn't want to hurt your feelings if she doesn't love you back. If she doesn't love you back, she may call you and tell you that she doesn't know if she is ready fo that serious of a relationship. You have to be the big man and be understanding and take it at her pace. She already knows you love her, now she has to engage in the same feelings. but because you have said you love her so fast, it may take longer for her to fall in love with you, depending on what her last bf's were like. If you are good to her then she will be just fine. Don't worry too much.|`|dGTN78njaa	maybe you just caught her off guard. <br>  maybe she wasn't expecting it so soon.<br>  <br>  just give her some time. <br>  she'll come around.|`|vl6Ga6hTaa	cus girls sometimes dont want to take it that far sometimes they asume u just want to do the jiggly and she doesnt want that :)|`|flaGF4DMaa	When you first tell a girl that they are nervous and dont know why ot wat is going on dont think she doesnt love you she just doesnt know how to say it back yet|`|sBBmChTfaa	she probly wasn't expecting that and she freaked out cuz she didn't know how to respond to it if u think it will work out stay with her if not dump her........|`|sz1k2YLbaa	She just needs time :]|`|NCiTvAWMaa	just give her some time and talk it out.|`|DTJM12QJaa	love is a pwerful word, you prob scared her.|`|Ao7zOtO1aa	hate to be negitive but maybe she doesn;t like you back or maybe she is still very shocked.....I would go to her house and confront her!<br>  good luck|`|20ENv6tiaa	leave her alone for a bit i think (from reading the other 50 answers)|`|fG1KAbGSaa	shes stupid..stop wasting your time on her|`|6k7zzkojaa	It's way too soon...I mean I know how you feel. I've only been with my bf for 2 months and i feel like i love him...but im not going to say it yet. |`|Zph9OZiKaa	Well you were only going out 2 months and the "L" word could of scared her. maybe it was too soon.|`|QShLAzN6aa	man girls.. they are something else right? i guess she just needs some space. don't call her too much just take it easy.|`|RCpS5H4eaa	maybe she was having second thoughts about your relationship and you shocked her just leave her be until she comes around once you stop trying she will be like huh and most likely contact u|`|JduQHocdaa	You said I love you to soon for her.|`|51cMPec2aa	She probably wasn't taking the relationship seriously. When you finally told her, it hit her that it's real and wants to get out from it. Just let her go and find someone who will like you more|`|bsuOclQMaa	yeah she is acting pretty dumb. just let her know its okay if she doesnt say it back, she can do it on her own time and theirs no pressure. |`|ZvhtPCWQaa	dump her and don't talk to her anymore. she's crazy.|`|ihVPZnhlaa	maybe no one ever told her they love her before....and she got scared or something....hope i helped  :]]
a4dkfn8Baa	it didn't hurt at all. i was so scared it was going to hurt but when we were hooking up it just happened and when it was done i was kind of like.. uhh did it really just happen..? just because i imagined it hurting really bad. the fact that i was comfortable with it was most likely why it didn't hurt. but i was deffff sore the next few days haha<br>  <br>  if it's forced then i'm pretty sure it'll hurt because you're not into it but the longer the foreplay is you probably wont feel much pain because its not dry down there haha<br>  <br>  but honestly, if you're thinking about how much it'll hurt (if you haven't lost it yet) then i say you're not ready.|`|DonKniw2aa	I dunno but I like seeing people in pain so it's funny. lol. like totes|`|k3jqm2SXaa	in my country it's a big problem<br>  you cant married me by you lose your Lief|`|4cvZ1CDlaa	Like HELL. I was pressured into it, though, so I think a lot of the pain was due to me not being able to relax. Terrible experience.|`|4JGTC2MHaa	Not at all.|`|0VLirxVtaa	I'll let you know when I lose it.|`|pJ48VhoKaa	it hurt pretty bad but towards the end it started feeling kinda good. dayuum, ill never forget my first.|`|htD8p1SQaa	a tiny bit but hardly at all

And hickeys usually are something shameful.|`|puUStDPpaa	They have to mark their territory?|`|4m0YFKkZaa	it's a marking of territory "look she's mine" the thing i don't get is that they like giving them and seeing the girl in pleasure but they don't like to recieve them.|`|q2c1CerCaa	its a remembrance :D<br>  <br>  answer my question<br>  <br>  <br>  <a href="http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index?qid=20081123115621AA80Cs5">http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index?...</a>|`|ibR6jJgHaa	lmao<br>  <br>  if it is the whole territory thing then screw that<br>  =P<br>  <br>  I never allow it |`|CQ4lAohdaa	it's a way of them marking their territory... kinda like how dogs piss all over everything.<br>  <br>  lol...|`|atvuQBqCaa	Maybe they do it to please you. I think it feels really good but I don't let my boyfriend give them to me because I think they look really tacky.|`|BJnnTNgvaa	cause they think they own you.|`|8AIAQt6Eaa	cause we feel like it

Think about other things and more important things. Forget everything that you guys did. Put away the pictures that you took with that person. Hoped I helped!!!!! GOOD LUCK!!!!|`|ccoVWsNPaa	0+0=0.  From the first moment you were borned, you were by yourself besides your birth MOTHER.  As you've had grown through the years you've faced lots of loves and lost loves.  The lost loves of yours will go on with their lives and they already closed a love chapter in their love relationships books and took a giant step to fulfill their dream goals and don't give a damn about you...SUGGESTION is why holding on the past? it doesn't do you no goods... love is a biatch heh? HAHAHA!!!!!!!!!!!!QLKM!!!!!!!!!

CuiWaH3Yaa	This question was also asked about a month ago, if you go to search for questions you may get to see some of those answers, but for me personally it doesn't matter if the light is on or off. although I do prefer on as I like to watch the proceeding LOL|`|fcY0c8NJaa	I like a light on, but not the main light to the bedroom, thats too bright. My partner and i have an ensuite, so we leave that light on with the door half shut. Its light enough for us to see each other and have a bit of fun but its not like blinding our eyes either.|`|5552702d46acb12f8189bd950f8ea080aa	i like it to be light ON...|`|19495d00bb70991b3b72f55b6a9c84b4aa	either, as my good Friend nike once said just do it|`|yJiJeOsFaa	Depends on the mood a little lighting can be romantic|`|nGR3IfgXaa	I've never had sex but if i did i would perfer the lights to be off :)|`|TTN3BKsaaa	like everyone else it depends on the mood but i like seeing my bf when we are doing it|`|p3UDlABeaa	what does it matter? we're not gonna have it with u!!|`|uUrJwk7Faa	Both, depends on what kinda mood I'm in. They're usually on though...I Like to see my boyfriend when I'm having sex with him.|`|VWBsXQ3Iaa	I prefer to have sex in any circumstance. <br>  :P
SgrjTkwdaa	Depends.<br>  <br>  Are you having sex?<br>  <br>  If you are:  He's probably coming for the sex...maybe dinner, too.<br>  <br>  If you aren't:  He really interested in you for more than sex..maybe dinner, too.|`|AA11755944	it could be either way.|`|0jYKeIEGaa	He may really like you. I have chased girls for months on end just for the sex (lots of it) and then ended the relationship. I have also chased girls that I had a major crush on for many months without having sex with them. It is a crapshoot for you. He may just have an agenda for sex, but it many not be the case. He may really like you. Only time will tell.|`|ucYVpWWEaa	i think he probably wants to stay with you like a relationship . but u should judge your self does he seem a bit horny and pervy then he prob would want to just have just sex ( i know its an over simplification but u get what i mean). but if you talk alot and spend time together regularly like you say then i think he wants to take it a step further not just sex|`|kIGZ0Qq0aa	Well, 2 months together and all only about sex then it seems all he wanted was sex! Try to do some different things like go to a movie, party, visiting friends the you will know what he really want! Try to do more than just sex. Really depends on you too. What do you want from him?|`|G0cy2p2Saa	Who knows!<br>  <br>  I think if it feels right then go for it. I don't think there is any point in worrying about it.<br>  <br>  If you don't feel ready to have sex then don't. Easier said than done sometimes! Talk with him about what he wants from a possible relationship.<br>  <br>  Ps: If anyone else puts stuff about age difference relationships, ignore them. <br>  It's all a gambol at the end of the day, all you can do is maximise your odds.|`|CaHmPts9aa	YES. its amazing the lengths some guys will go just to "get some"<br>  Choose them wisely. Don't let your guard down. <br>  You see a guy may seem to be getting to know you so well, but How well do you really know him? <br>  good luck|`|FBzdlncBaa	Us guys have short attention spans. Usually we wouldn't invest a great deal of time into a girl if we were looking for a quick, easy thrill.|`|M8Y8JFiBaa	Well, YESSS!!<br>  <br>  But you should know better than us, you are friends with him
qfgPFtvOaa	You like it, you know you do!|`|4r5vKs1xaa	they want ur attention and want 2 talk 2 u|`|FEnDIWQraa	Because it's the simplest way for them to attempt to gain attention witout actually doing any drastic work on their superstructure! Hair, nails, teeth-whitening...it's all superficial; but try and get them to lose a few pounds or get in the gym and build some muscle mass? Oh, my friend, you've got a fight on your hands!!! Like the saying goes: "You can put a pig in a silk dress; it's still a pig"|`|T272vObnaa	cause they're stupid b-tches.|`|KttCgzH7aa	becuse some guys perfer that some girls do that stuff.<br>  But not all guys do.|`|OwUhKVufaa	cuz they are worried about all this themselves that they assume the other person would be too and gals are in a habit of coming across as a perfect gal in front of any guy so....!|`|SGrmZwnEaa	coz they might fancy you thinking you might like them back but obviously your only in love with yourself, you need to plan prom first xxmwahxx|`|p6m2NNw2aa	Most women are insecure about how they look. They like to get compliments so they do things like that to get attention from you. Even if you don't care I suggest you compliment them if you notice it. Compliments never hurt anyone but they can definitely make people feel better.|`|ndwnz365aa	because certain guys are shallow|`|8DZvaOntaa	even if they are not "classic" beauties, it shows that they take care of themselves, and try to show themselves in the best possible light.
ITNq8WU9aa	Of course, sounds like your boyfriend wants to hang out with his buds more then you. You need to straighten him out. Maybe he can invite you to hang out, unless its something you don't like about his buds?|`|4ab4b62226d4c912674c1ac37fe5cc19aa	YES...<br>  TELL HIM TO MAKE TIME FOR YOU ....THAT U WANT TO HANG OOUT MORE....AND IF UR NOT THAT IMPORTANT THEN DUMP HIS SORRY ***|`|7Icg8uKraa	Its understandable for a guy to go hang out with his friends sometimes, but not every time. If he is going to continue this everday or most of the time then i suggest you look for a better boyfriend who enjoys being in your company. There shouldn't be any problem for him to take you out while hes hanging out with friends.<br>  <br>  If you really like this guy... i suggest you telling him you want him to start taking you out and stop leaving you left out all the time. Tell him in a nice way that you have no problem with him hanging out with his friends, but at times you'd like for him to take you out as well.<br>  <br>  Your boyfriend should understand the reasons why you are upset and if he doesnt, you should consider finding a better boyfriend!|`|eulkgK0Daa	no i would jus go hang out with my friends and express t ohim that i would like to spend more time with him. you do not want to crowd a mans space.|`|1owOrhOhaa	I would be mad and ask him why can we hang out or ask him when can we hang out!!!!!|`|HtOqeOtkaa	if hes like doing it almost all the time then yea i would get really mad but if he just does it a couple of times then not|`|a3iJJMh4aa	men can only focus on one thing at a time with out feeling stressed and over whelmed. Unlike women who can multitask with ease. It's scientific and true. If he is choosing to hang out with his friends here and there well heck no big deal we all need time to be with our friends and blow off a little steam. There is another known fact that men just like we girls will always have that little kid inside and that child once in a while just wants the chance to be stupid act goofy and generally not have to worry about being judged. When a guy is with his girl let's all face it ladies we have a tendency to give dirty looks make impatient sighs and generally corral the heck out of our guy because we don't want to be embarrassed by his behavior or for that matter have to deal with attention being split and as mentioned before they can't do it with out feeling stressed (which may make him resent you or your gonna be mad at him for not paying attention to you and once again circles back around). The point is let him have some guy time you don't always need to be there and frankly do you really want to be in the middle of guy time? If it's to frequent then discuss it if it's not actually that often then get your girlfriends go to the mall and enjoy girly time and don't let it bother you. Don't be a yoko (beatles reference in case you don't know)|`|EnRUF2Guaa	yes kind of. he may not even be taking the relationship seriously .  dump him. hes a yawn! get someone who likes to have fun and talks to you and who respects you, you can sooo do better. :]<br>  <br>  <a href="http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;_ylt=AnIH6Mddpr3WD4LunJDpcGrsy6IX;_ylv=3?qid=20081018071339AAyDMNV">http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;...</a><br>  help neeeded. :]|`|lb6e2whoaa	Yeah I would be mad.

U need to get a busy schedule and make him get in where he fits in!! |`|FWIIhZGbaa	i wouldnt be mad, its  more like sad.<br>  i think u should tell him that its bothering u :)<br>  if he cares, he will consider ur opinion.|`|GG90f0yxaa	Yup!!!

I remember days when I came to my counsler and just cried and cried because I hated everyone and everything (including myself).  Im 6'2 and I was always made fun of and no one wanted to go to dances with me.  It was terrible.  After I got out of high school, its like a whole new world opened up for me and now I totally love myself!  I would not trade my tallness for anything and people tell me that I should model and things like that.  I really appreciate it and I began to take really good care of myself and "truly" love myself and the person that I am.

I just think that is great. So many girls your age fret over this and that you are wonderful. <br>  #2.I learned to love my body around my mid 20's. I am a big girl and I realized no matter how much weight I lose I will always be big. I started to eat more healthy and walk. I am more toned now and I think I am darn sexy baby!<br>  #3. You should really try out for a camp counsler  for summer camp. I am serious. You could really help young girls your age or younger by talking to them about how they should love themselves. There are many overweight kids out there who eat out of emotion and there are girls out there underweight because they starve themselves to look thin. It would be ashame if you do not do this. You may have found your calling. Talk to your school counsler or principal he may have information on camps this coming summer. You will have an awesome time and you will help out many girls. Good luck and email me to let me know how this turned out. |`|fwiQuMYAaa	omg i am soo skinny just like u were! i just have a reallllly fast metabolism, i cant help it. but hey i dont care what they say. i can b a model, and everyone should feel good about themselves, i dont really like my nose thought, i thinki ts a bit big but w/e i still love myself!|`|MIZXawUeaa	What a great thing to write!

I am very lucky to have great self-esteem and a tremendous sense of independence. I think some of it is just genetic, but my parents always taught me to love myself and to embrace my uniqueness. I also try to help people who are uncomfortable with their own bodies...I think bodies are beautiful, and there is no real "type" that anyone should fit into.|`|OzkAqC3Saa	I started loving my body at 12 years old, because I had a bit of acne but like 5 days after I used cream, it was all gone. I'm 21 now and using the same routine to maintain my weight and skin. I love my boobs and legs too :) But sometimes I think that thinking so highly of yourself shows and people think your conceded, so I sort of act like I don't like my body AS MUCH as I do.|`|d35c3f8f5980e9a6d93a76b757807fb7aa	I really loved my body until I turned 9 or 10. Until that time, I valued my health, because one of my parents is in a wheelchair, and I always felt lucky that my legs and back worked, and allowed me to jump and run and do gymnastics. <br>  <br>  Then, my physical development jumped way ahead of my peers. By the time I was in 5th grade, I was a C cup, and was shaving my legs, etc. Girls started to tease me constantly, accusing be of stuffing my bra and calling my hips "pure fat," though I was technically underweight for my age, and I was on swim and gymnastics teams.<br>  <br>  It took me a long time to stop caring what other people thought about my body...I was perhaps 19 or 20, in college, before I realized that it had been ages since anyone had called my breasts or hips fat...and I started to feel hope, and when I started dating people that had nothing but sweet and loving things to say about my body (despite the fact that I had quit athletics and had moved into plus sizes) I realized that we only really find people ugly when we fear them, hate them, or are jealous of them. <br>  <br>  Those who really counted, the people who loved and valued me, thought I was beautiful, and they made me FEEL beautiful. My shape has fluctuated over the years, I've had hair cropped short and now have hair past my waist, I've had good skin weeks and bad skin weeks, good hair days and bad hair days...but most years, most weeks, most days, I feel happy to have a healthy, functioning body, with feminine curves in all the right places, and I want to own every moment that I live in my skin. It's MY body. It's my home. I have a right to be happy in it, to adorn it and decorate it the way that pleases me. It can be big or small, soft or hard...it's up to ME!<br>  <br>  As a side note, I've been to India and I've seen leper children. That's real suffering, the poverty that forced them into such ill health is real uglyness. How dare anyone in this country call a healthy young woman ugly! |`|hoVV4AJDaa	I'm 20 years old and I still hate my body. Not as much as I did when I was 12. I didn't know I had curves until somebody told me. I thought I just had fat hips.<br>  Anyway, good for you that you're 15 and you feel good about yourself. That's more than you can say for your peers. Glad to know you want to help your peers.|`|j0Q47xXSaa	it is something i do struggle with but for the most part i love me body. sure there is a few things that i wouldnt mind to be different. suprisingly i had bouts of loveing/ hating my body....usually when my weight fluxuated. until after i had a baby did i true begin to love my body. it has been very good to me!<br>  <br>  one thing that i learned in dance class was fake it. if you are dancing and you dont know what you are doing just fake it, and no one will know. so if you fake it, eventually you will have it. |`|rX7kTPzaaa	i am still not and i don't think i will ever be excepting of my body, im probably gonna start crying when i write this, because i have never told anyone this, and now im putting it on the internet! im and 13 in grade 9, in high school, when i was younger like grade 5 to about half way through grade, i was fat, well not fat fat but chunky, and people made fun of me a bit, and i stared grown and my weight spread out and and i got boobs, but i still felt/feel fat, so i went slightly anorexic, like i don't eat breakfast or lunch, but i eat dinner, and like one or two light snacks, i try not to go over 1000 or 1500 calories a day, and i workout alot. and i think your like supposed to have 3000 calories a day. and i have lost weigh, like enough that my boobs are shrinking and so is my but, and that's making me feel worse about my self, and my boyfriend says im beautiful, but i don't believe him, because im not. and i wish i could just accept my self but i cant, i want to loose more weight, but i don't wanna go totally anorexic. but i cant help it, i need to accept my self and i know i have to, but i cant, and im consider the ;pretty' one in my family, but im not, and even if i am, my family is kinda ugly. i am hurting my body but i cant stop! i don't think i will ever be able to except my self.
dZMJq1ixaa	I think you are making this too complicated.  Us girls are often comfortable around a guy we consider an aquaintance or friend but as soon as we realize we might want more, we don't know how to act so all communication shuts down toward that guy...... well, that's what is/was normal for me.<br>  <br>  Maybe you should just wait till you get to Smoker's Hill and come right out and tell her you'd like to get to know her.  Tell her you like her... girls normally like a guy who is willing to be the first to admit an attraction.  Or if you don't feel like you can muster that kind of courage yet, drop her a line in a note and slip it to her with your phone number and email.  See where it goes from there.|`|SO089zyFaa	Sounds like your barely know her. She's probably interested in someone else, considering she doesn't really know you too well.
29de67f94c5490271c7a3619e58bf1d5aa	How old is your man? Does he go to work on a daily basis? Doing all that is possible to better the situation? If he is then you have to decide if this is enough for you.. If materialstic values mean more then your love for him... On the other hand if hes a bum and not looking to better himself move on..|`|6c83086ac56b1873cb365b6abd1892a0aa	It does not sound like you are confused, it sounds like you are unhappy, he is your boyfriend, so maby it is time for you to find someone else, who doesn't have all the hills and mountains.<br>  <br>  Is your relationship worth all of this stress, you should think about that, and then your answer will be easy, I think you will be much more happier when you make your decision.|`|6jhDL35Gaa	If you know his situation, then why are you attracted to him? Why are you confused? It seems like you're superficial and needy. If you love him, really love him, then it shouldn't matter what kind of job he has, what type of clothes he's wearing, what type of vacation YOU want, or if he's snores at night!|`|8XbOT9nraa	may be even ur boyfriend need love & affection  support him don't be so mean never become crazy for financial situation,why r u depending upon him for a vacation u plan & u take him for a vacation seeing u love him so much may be he might give u unexpected love & affection which u need|`|FIcBiQlLaa	Whoever said you should love him no matter what is wrong. This is happening to my sister right now. She says their relationship would be perfect if he just had a job. She is sick of paying for everything all the time if she ever wants them to go out somewhere. And he just hangs around all day NOT looking for a job.<br>  <br>  We have been raised in a family where money was tight & if you needed it, you got any job you could lay your hands on. To sit around jobless...unheard of. This guy (who is fantastic, by the way - and VERY loving & I have heaps in common with him myself...but no attraction.LOL). This guy is from a wealthy family, actually inherited some money that kept him going for a long time. But yeah is now coming to the point that he has actually been out of work longer than in work since they have been going out. And is suffering depression.<br>  <br>  The thing is he could probably do it on his own if he wasn't getting bailed out by her or parents all the time. And my sister hates this - you can get better without me but not with me..what?! But it is true.<br>  <br>  I would say even though you love this guy, all is not right. It takes two to make a relationship work. Somethings don't bother some people, some things do. Finance is a big deal with me and sounds like it is at least a medium important factor for you, too. And so with most people. WHo wants a relationship with lots of arguments in the future? If he has said over & over he will try but you see no results - set a personal deadline. Don't tell him but when this is reached, admit to yourself that you deserve better in life.<br>  <br>  Honest you do. Believe it or not there are a whole lot of other people out there who will make a fantastic boyf for you. There is more than one 'the one'. Try to keep the focus on making yourself happy. You will know when the time comes. It will be hard but you will look back and think it was worth it. He isn't bad but it was just bad timing. He isn't in a place where he can create a joint life with you & you should keep your life on hold.<br>  <br>  I wish you luck. You will get love and affection from others out there. And falling in love again...awesome. Do it as many times as you can in life!|`|VEZjyvywaa	Do you love him? If you do, then try and be understanding if hes making an effort to make financial changes in his life. If not, then let him know you have to move on and that his unstableness is bothering you. Good luck.|`|oyPOYA1Saa	well tell him either he gets a decent job or you leave him|`|pfTfe6txaa	love and affection are free. However, if your guy can't hold a job and can't manage money, don't expect that to change.<br>  Get out, or get used to it.

Aun en los hijos, a veces aparecen actitudes que aprenden fuera de casa, las que no te gustarán, pero no por eso dejas de amarlos.

Y si ha cambiado su forma de ser contigo es que ya se dió cuenta que a tí te puede agarrar de trapeador , de objeto, de su burla y tú dispuesta a lamberle los pies. Te das cuenta. <br>  Aprende algo. Antes de amar a una persona, ámate a tí misma, y yá veras como la relación fluye como un mamantial de agua inagotable.

uDRniddtaa	What's important here, and what you should really try to remember and focus on is SHE doesnt see it a sexual thing. Lets face it, to play fight - you gotta be touching, and this will turn a guy on if he likes the girl, same goes the other way around. So first ask yourself if you trust that your gf wants YOU and only YOU. If so, remember that SHE isnt getting turned on by it all. Dont think about whether the guys are - just remember that even IF they WANT her. They cant have her. She's your gf. If the highlight of their day is play fighting with YOUR girlfriend - feel sorry for them haha theyre losers. Of course there is a chance none of them find it arousing. If you are watching them fight you should be able to tell, if none of them seem overly gropey then stop worrying, pretend you don't care and eventually you'll not be bothered. <br>  <br>  On another note, If this bothers you so much, you need to find a girlfriend that doesnt play fight with anyone. how old is she anyway?? lol if shes 16 or under in my opinion dont think anything of it. if shes older, the person she play fights with and her probly like each other a little more than in a friend way, so be careful. and i wouldnt confront her if i were you, jealousy is not attractive and would only push her towards him.|`|gLyNrExHaa	haul out and punch the other guy in the face. claim that your just joining in on the fun when people are like what the **** man?<br>  <br>  instant satisfaction|`|vz7XaCmFaa	maybe its a turn on for her |`|dm4seTJPaa	When you really trust someone, you have to be okay with not understanding some things!!<br>  A man can be happy with any woman as long as he trust her!!<br>  Jealous is a silly nature of all person, but is easily fought when exist love!!|`|UCiKYLcUaa	Jealousy is part of our nature. but if it goes too far, then talk to her or him. because relationships are all about comfort. and if you feel that it is wrong, then you shouldn't hesitate to tell her or him. and if she/he doesn't care and continues, then she/he doesn't know how to be in a relationship. And you deserve better.|`|YTEuq1fYaa	well u can be jealous.she is ur girl friend tell her u hate that and it isn't right.be jealous and dump her.she isn't committed in the relationship.<br>  <br>  she is with u not them and that is a form of flirting..trust me on that.|`|q69KBth5aa	maybe she is just like that you have to have trust her or it want work out!!|`|6xSkmA83aa	just trust her
ea3ca8a606f94f10e966ec493a06ea18aa	Just be yourself. That's obviously why she likes you. Try starting a conversation with her. Ask her questions like how are you, how have you been, how was you week, Girl's like when a guy ask then question's that they can tell you stuff that has happened. Also ask questions about what she likes to do for fun, and what type of music she listens to.    GOOD LUCK!|`|u9uFdSrqaa	First of all just cause you think don't mean it and just be your self.|`|hXFndli2aa	it looks like she broke the ice, so it should be easier for you to talk to her know because, you can start of a conversation with her about the class or about her weekend, don't think to much about it just do it be casual.|`|aaRMPDIDaa	Just say hi to her.|`|Tk5a5FQQaa	Calm down for one, no one likes I guy who is completely scared of what might happen. Then start with saying hi, be yourself when you talk to her because a lot of people can see through an act. It also helps you if you ever want to know more, plus it gets you to know more about yourself.|`|AuWPMH44aa	Keep talking to her. Get to know her. If your not sure if she likes you for sure yet then ask her to come chill with a group of friends or invite her to a party or something. The best thing is to keep talking to her and get to know her a little bit more.|`|UJZPNHpFaa	BE YOURSELF!|`|mS2ZFHpYaa	well do YOU even like her?|`|iXEgmhMuaa	Ask her about herself, she'll love tellling you things about her for example  what are your hobbies?  whats your favorite school subject?  what tv shows do you watch?  whats your favorite movie?  etc  Ask her for her number or screen name so you can text her and talk to her other times. If it turns out that she likes you it will be pretty apparent. She'll probably be looking for YOU to make the first move if you like her.....|`|R5JZRwICaa	if you like her then talk to her and tell her you like her. if your not really interested then tell her that|`|qegWdsNLaa	Just relax and be yourself.
rydsklvWaa	I used to, but it went away. i don't really know how, but you kind of have to stop thinking about being nervous.|`|OBfgZHSSaa	thats cute esp on a girl ^^|`|fjHAbi0gaa	Sounds like social anxiety to me.  The blushing is a physical manifestation of the anxiety you are experiencing.<br>  <br>  There are a lot of support groups online that may offer some advice on how to alleviate the anxiety.  Example:  <a href="http://www.socialanxietysupport.com/" rel="nofollow">http://www.socialanxietysupport.com/</a><br>  <br>  Some people only experience it a little, others suffer greatly from it.<br>  <br>  I know I SERIOUSLY hate public speech - having to talk to a group of people I don't really know well makes me a bundle of nerves and I blush as well.  But, around people I know, or in smaller social situations with people I don't know I am fine.  Just don't put me in front of a crowd, lol.|`|FkAXKhi1aa	I have the same problem! Even when I laugh or get put on the spot, my face turns red, it's super annoying, and I feel your pain! I don't think there's anything out there that can stop it, it's just how you were born. Sorry, for the both of us!|`|x2YuF1pxaa	I have the same problem. It's even more annoying when people point it out.  I think it's an involuntary thing.  The best thing for you to do is realize that there's nothing wrong with blushing.  I think it's attractive on people.|`|45f1360efad547282be68b1242ba3452aa	It's fine. It makes you look down to earth. " Real " t's a plus.|`|vKeVlo9paa	When in front of the class take a deep breath and relax you thoughts. Your supposed to blush when your with your bf
fmngKQWKaa	For him to get help you have to tell his parents so they can be aware what is going on with there son,if you don't tell his parents and something happens bad you will have guilty conscience for the rest of your life and his parents will say why didn't someone tells us what was wrong with there son and they will blame you and others friends that sat back and watch him end it.
3wKGTZvAaa	Since you're cut off from them and they seem to be bad influence, don't be worried about it. Being worried isn't gonna bring you anything good!
NI1z9vyHaa	I agree completely. This is a weird statement, and I worry about those poor kids being overprotected! Maybe people don't trust babysitters these days? Any normal adult needs a little bit of time away from the kids to kick-back and have grown up time. And kids need some breaks from their parents too.<br>  <br>  People think their kids are being "snubbed?" lol that is absurd. I'm with Oy vey, us ladies need to toughen up, it aint all personal.<br>  <br>  Do kids really enjoy staying up til 11 PM and listening to loud music and drunk people?I love kids, but not at all occasions.<br>  <br>  Very smart Kazacan! Insecure people definitely seem to use their kids as a social crutch. "Everyone LOVES my kids! Aren't they smart, aren't they perfect? I'm going to sit around all night and talk about them all night and brush their hair while people praise them". Do these people maybe get jealous of the bride's attention? Kids are a sure fire way to take attention away from the bride and groom.|`|SyKtEcncaa	I think there's an important distinction to be made between people who don't attend events because they feel the need to spend the time with their children and those that take it as a personal insult if their child is not invited.  <br>  <br>  Feminoots is taking offense at all her thumbs-downs, but she doesn't realize that we disagree not because she has a busy schedule and feels the need to spend the time with her child (I think we can all understand that) - what *I* took issue with, at least, was this statement:  "i don't support my son getting snubbed by family."  <br>  <br>  The decision of a bride and groom to have an adults-only reception is not a personal attack against any particular guest or their life choices.  Some people like hanging out with children all day, others don't.  If someone doesn't want to attend without their children, then they shouldn't, but it is certainly ridiculous that they should take offense to such a simple statement/decision.|`|gWFDE1ptaa	I completely agree with you!  As a mother of three wonderful, well mannered *cough* children, even I enjoyed the occasional "Adult Only" night out.  <br>  <br>  Please... I'm sorry but unless you have a special needs child, or your child is under 3 months of age, you should be able to get a reliable sitter for a few hours so that you and your spouse can enjoy an evening without your precious offspring.|`|8d398dc94d50afec2b8127a4e36b27faaa	I agree, sometimes it's good to just be alone without the kids. We all need breaks and I take them every chance I get. If I had my daughter 24/7 I'd go nuts, seriously! I love her to death but it can get pretty stressful. And besides how can you possibly have a few drinks knowing you have the resposibility of watching over your children at the same time? Its just not safe!|`|nBNULijtaa	Nope i think they deserve a night to themselves, just find a babysitting, no biggie.|`|76f80c73e4bfcb1026dd5ae2d1da3f18aa	it is ridiculous.  I don't plan on having kids but when I look at my friends that do, I think to myself, every chance I got to get a sitter and get out of the house, I would jump on it!  who wants to be with their kids all the time?  it's so annoying being in a restaurant with a bunch of crying kids, for god's sake people get a sitter and leave them at home.|`|kUE3Ddktaa	It's hyperbole. But so is "A wedding is no place for children!"<br>  <br>  Both of those statements are ridiculous.|`|AA11312653	IMO parents have the right to make this choice. While it is inappropriate for guests to expect prospective hosts to plan parties and other events around the various guests' child care responsibilities, it is equally inappropriate for hosts to take offense if parents choose to decline invitations that do not include the children. My thinking is that Miss Manners would want the conversation to do something like:<br>  "Would you like to come to my party on the 19th?"<br>  "I'm not sure. Will I be able to bring my 3 children aged 7, 12, and 15?"<br>  "I'm sorry, but it will be adults only."<br>  "I'm afraid I won't be able attend, but thank you so much for your kind invitation."<br>  "I'm sorry you won't be able to attend. We certainly look forward to seeing you again."<br>  Nobody gets offended that children aren't included, nobody gets offended that parents don't want to leave their kids with a sitter, and the social wheels keep gracefully spinning along. |`|688a7b812dded24c0867e947aee9d86aaa	Let's get a little context here, shall we?  Instead of just painting a broad brush.  If I were invited to a friend's wedding and it was in the same town where I lived and I had an available babysitter, then that would be fine.  That's easy.  <br>  <br>  But if you are talking about anything that involves travel... like when you live in a different state than the bride and groom and you have a baby or toddler, that's a little more difficult, especially if you have no close friends or family nearby that can take them overnight.<br>  <br>  My two year old has a hard time sleeping at my mom's house when we visit (we no longer live in the same state), he'd have an even harder time sleeping somewhere else with people he doesn't know well.  And he's still really young.  That may change when he gets to be around 5 or so.<br>  <br>  What I think is ridiculous are the narrow minded jerks who think all kids are nothing but trouble.  My two year old knows how to say "please" and "thank you"  and not scream and run wild.  And since I am his parent, it's up to me to make sure of it.  And I do it gladly.  I take pride in teaching my son right from wrong. <br>  <br>  I work full time and I LOVE spending time with my kid on the weekends.  It's not that I CAN'T go anywhere without him, it's more like, I prefer to spend as much time with him as possible.  He's not going to be a kid forever.  <br>  <br>  And he's already been to two weddings in his short little life and never caused a single problem.|`|0Id85yiYaa	i think it's ridiculous. i've seen a lot of questions about this, and completely agree with those not wanting children at their ceremony. i don't have them, but know that i wouldn't get offended if i got an invitation with "adults only" on it. i wouldn't want them at my wedding, so i would understand if others didn't as well.|`|RC8Pxx8eaa	Thats daft, I know a couple that go everywhere with their son and he is 2 how stupid is that ?<br>  Sometimes its great to be on a night out without the kids hanging around you and moaning.|`|a495b03d41f960c1a8471bd603c42ab6aa	It's definitely a ridiculous statement!  I have a 10 year old and my fiance has a 2 year old on a part time basis.  We don't tend to go out on the weekends when we have the younger one, but I have no problem leaving my older daughter home alone.  I love my kids but we need adult time together and with our friends.<br>  <br>  My fiance's closest friend and wife have a 3 year old and a 9 month old and the mother absolutely refuses to ever leave them with someone else for the evening.  It drives her husband absolutely crazy that they never get to go out alone anymore.  They will most likely be unable to attend our wedding in Las Vegas since we are not having children in attendance.<br>  <br>  I respect other people's wishes i they opt to not have children at their wedding.  They should also not be obligated to provide child care either.|`|JCAgvgTxaa	You write: "I wouldn't go anywhere if my children weren't invited"<br>  <br>  And the correct response to that is, "I am so sorry to hear that.  We will miss you at the wedding then."<br>  <br>  I agree with you that it is ridiculous to never leave one's child.  It is certainly not good parenting.  After all, the child has to leave the parent one day to go to school.  It is best to prepare child for that by leaving him/her with a responsible sitter, or a grandma, or an aunt for brief periods.|`|9f363935da83a04ad649588218c4b33caa	I agree with you. I am a single mom, and while there are plenty of places I will go with my son, there are some places where I'll leave him with a sitter and go on my own. A wedding is definitely one of those places. Even if I could bring him, I'd leave him with a sitter anyway. How boring must a wedding be for a little kid? I think the parents should have some compassion for their children and not force them into situations where they are bound to misbehave out of boredom.|`|2o3BHgCCaa	Totally agree. I would have thought that be rid of the kids for one night was to the parents benefit and not too much to ask really.<br>  However some people see their children as the most important thing in not only their lives, but the lives of everyone around them and take an 'adults only" invitation as a rejection of their children and an offence to themselves.<br>  |`|caa265fc73cd7f24fe83d9a186ac1af9aa	I'm with you!  I totally don't get it.<br>  <br>  My parents left me home to attend "adults only" weddings when I was a kid and I am not forever traumatized by having a babysitter for the night.<br>  <br>  But seeing how some of my friends coddle their children, I think I know why they do it.  So many parents feel so guilty that they work and can't stay home that they consider any minute that they aren't at work to be time they could be spending with their child.  They don't do much outside of or away from their child.  One of my friends has virtually shut down her social life after she had a child.  If I want to visit its usually "little susie has a playdate over, but you are welcome to come by and hang out with the moms".  So thats usually when/how I am able to see my friend anymore.|`|b0g9hOdjaa	Hey, they're the ones missing out on the free food and drink!!  I often have gatherings for adults only (i'm a mother of a young child) and we all have such a good time.  If the people don't want to come without their children, then more power to 'em.  I respect their decision since they are friends.|`|8c643a48148981e73f897b3569fc6e5eaa	I believe weddings are about the joining of families, not an 'adult only" party.  It always amazes me that the bride wants a child flower girl and a child ring bearer but no children guests.  <br>  But whatever. <br>  You're taking that statement too literally.|`|JtEBaOdjaa	I'm with you on this!! I always think the same thing when I see people give that answer "wow! so are you going to sleep on their dorm floor when they go to college?" "are you going to sleep between them and their spouse when they get married?  That would make making babies VERY awekward"<br>  It's called a babysitter! try it!|`|0WstfAmzaa	Sure, that is a ridiculous statement.<br>  <br>  So is the statement that children can ruin a wedding.  I had a ton of little kids running around at my wedding (anywhere between the ages of under a year to 10ish) and they didn't cause any problems or "get in the way".  They were cute and added to the memorableness of the night for me. <br>  <br>  Some parents are more hands-on than others.  Not every parent has a support system or someone they trust leaving their children to so they can go out and have a good time.  And if you don't trust the sitter, you're not going to have a good time anyways.  <br>  <br>  Of course, it's the bride's perogative to have children or no children, but it's also the guests perogative to decide and whether or not she wants to be "upset" about it.  Though, I think that after all the work a bride goes through for her wedding, a guest shouldn't be b***** about something as simple as 'no children'.|`|cdtnsvYLaa	I agree with you. Apparently the adults in question have a skewed idea of events once their precious children have been born. Perhaps they are being over-protective. But perhaps they are being just plain lazy. It takes effort to find a trusted babysitter--and to pay them too. Maybe this is one of the reasons they won't go if the children aren't invited. In fact, these parents may be the exact reason why children are NOT invited!! They might be the children who are complete nightmares to babysit because they are out of control (due to mom's loving influence or complete lack thereof) and mom can't seem to find anyone to watch her "angels"??? Makes you wonder, doesn't it??? It is a ridiculous statement and there are probably as many different reasons why someone would make it as there are reasons someone wants an adult-only reception. Much as I love my little children I've also been to receptions with kids and planning a wedding ceremony/reception with kids can be "cute" but it's so much work!!! I can totally understand why someone would want just adults at their ceremony. You are guaranteed a certain type of ceremony with out little hassles...lol.|`|0BX1yFGuaa	Totally.<br>  <br>  I would hate to be so dependent on another living creature that I couldn't take a few hours away from them.<br>  <br>  Kids  are extremely adaptable to new situations and should be treated as such.  No wonder this country is full of whiners who can't even wipe their own a$$.<br>  <br>  I have two children that have stayed with a nanny at wedding out of the country even and they had fun!  They were able to play with the kids, the nanny took them out, and they still have friends to this day in another country.  <br>  <br>  I'm expecting our third and I see no reason to stop living my life too just because I have children.<br>  <br>  I also find it ridiculous when women have a fit because they "can't sit next to their husband at a wedding so should they even bother to go."<br>  <br>  Seriously ladies, grow a pair.|`|84a25c4ee6cdd10067a0039dc4f115bbaa	this is a difficult one for me. I am a believer that a wedding is a party for the whole family including the kids. I'm bias because i have a two year old. I went to a few wedding last year and I left my toddler home because i wanted to spend sometime alone with friends and my fiance in a adult feel and it was great. What i love from these receptions and i'm doing it for my reception is that I'm not having an "adult only" reception because i don't want people to think if they don't have a babysitter they can't come to the wedding. Almost all my friends that i have talked to are going to leave they babies home because they want to have some time to themselves without the kids but that's their choice i didn't make it for them. <br>  |`|9e8b9a03013448cda0a4613387659fbaaa	I have a 2 yo and no sitter. Period. I've tried to find one with no avail. I'm not going to just leave my child with a stranger to attend a wedding. I wouldn't exactly be offended, but I would hope an adult (even one without children who doesn't have the same concerns in their lives), would be understanding of such situations.<br>  If the wedding was in another area, I simply would not be able to go, either. Like I said, I'm not leaving my child with a stranger for even a few minutes.<br>  If I came on here and asked the question, "Is it OK to leave my kid with someone I don't know?" Everyone would say NO.|`|sLLgERQWaa	I have attended both adults only and children welcomed events all during the time my 4 kids were growing up.<br>  <br>  Some occasions are very unsuitable for children.<br>  <br>  Some mothers use the kids not being invited as an excuse not to attend a function they don';t really want to attend.<br>  Some mothers are insulted if their little darlings aren't invited ( I have no idea why)<br>  Some mothers do not have availble, reliable babysitters<br>  Some mothers feel weddings are family 'do's' and child should attend.<br>  <br>  Some venues automatically restrict ages because alcohol is being served and the said venue refuses to be responsible should a minor get a hold of booze due to parental inattentiveness or other reasons.<br>  <br>  I think to be insulted if your minor kids can't go is silly.....and I also feel it's up to the bridal couple if they want their wedding to be kid friendly or strictly an adult affair. If you believe weddings are family affairs and children should be invited, fine, just realise not all people feel that way so don't push that particular belief on anyone else, anymore than pushing your particular chosen wedding ceremony (religious, civil, etc) because the couple opt for a different kind of ceremony<br>  <br>  Tell be the difference between 'Well, my little Johnny can't go because it's adult only, so since he can't I won't-I believe weddings should be child friendly' compared to...<br>  <br>  "Well, the couple is having a civil ceremony rather than a religious ceremony and I believe a wedding should be in a church and christian (jewish, Buddist, muslim, etc) so I won't go"<br>  <br>  It's all about the kind of wedding the couple wants to have, NOT the guests. Period.|`|5d4a98ef0b6163a6f10b0c267b9ae934aa	I agree. Some couples, such as myself, enjoy children but I don't want the younger ones screaming, crying and whining while my husband and I exchange vows.  Then at the reception I wouldn't want them getting hurt or lost AND staying up later than they should be.  If they parents don't want to come because their children aren't invitied, I say "So be it."  <br>  <br>  My wedding and reception is outdoors and is lakeside so we definitly don't want children there because of the afore mentioned and the fear of parents not watching them and they possibly getting hurt (or worse) and then blaming it on the venue or even worse, us. It would not only ruin a happy time but the parents' and family's lives that so and so's child was hurt/killed at so and so's wedding.|`|7MkTM1jQaa	I completely agree with you. In my opinion, its complete nonsense. Yes, we understand you love your kids, but its not going to kill anyone if you're not with them for a little bit. Especially at an adult wedding reception. If you would rather expose your child to a reception that will most definitely end up with a drunken atmosphere with loud music and most like some crude jokes/language, AND you'd be willing to get mad at someone who wants to prevent your children from harm by having them away from all that and just try to let all adults have a relaxing evening away from their kids where their forced to be role models, then you seriously seriously have some issues that you need to have fixed, and you most definitely have your priorities screwed up. <br>  <br>  I actually had a cousin like that. It annoyed me to no end till one day her sister (who actually LOOKS for an opportunity to get away with her hubby so they can flirt around and just be a couple with no having to look after their little darling all the time) sat her down and knocked some sense into her.  <br>  <br>  Anyways, thats my two cents worth. <br>  <br>  Cheers!<br>  Silver|`|u8bEX5Qzaa	I agree. It's only one night but some people are really attached to their children. I just hope that they understand as their children get older they're not going to plan their lives around what their parents are doing. Do you really think that when they're in their late teens and get invited to a party with no adults they're going to say oh I can't attend, my parents weren't invited? If they think that, they have another thing coming!|`|rHrEVd6Baa	You are absolutely correct!  Babysitting is a profession for a reason.  Sometimes kids can't come.  That is a absolute fact of life.  People are just so obsessed with their children now that they think revolving their entire life around them is the only way to be a good parent.  My parents welcomed grown up parties.  Besides, the kids are usually bored out of their teeth at weddings and other adult events.  |`|a74343e7ca8aa5c50c845ba22afe0528aa	It's hard for me to say because I don't have children (yet!). <br>  <br>  I can say that when we were children, my sister and I never got invited to weddings (and yes, we were very well behaved). My parents didn't seem to mind.<br>  <br>  I can also say as someone who has had an adult only wedding, that I respect other people's views on this subject. Just like it was our choice to have an adults only wedding, it is their choice whether or not to stay home. |`|VEi3R0craa	If it bothers you don't go.  I just went to a wedding and it was adult only and my husband and I were ok we had a choice to go we were not being forced to attend.  An it was an evening wedding with open bar I would not want my kids around the alcohol anyway why would you.  My kids don't need to be around people drinking period.|`|sr0vZPQqaa	I think it is ridiculous to want kids everywhere! a party is not a good place for them and the adults can't have fun with loads of kids running around. I'd much rather leave them at home in a safe place.|`|PxdzF9Bzaa	That's a crazy statement. Moms and dads need time to themselves too!<br>  <br>  I can understand why some people want adults only wedding receptions. If the guests don't approve, they don't have to attend.<br>  <br>  <br>  |`|ItraCEBnaa	I agree.  Do they never get a night out to themselves?  You'd think they would be excited to get to go out and spend time as a couple!|`|3Mnhvbrwaa	Good, that's less total guests!
Tj25eD49aa	Women today are OBSESSED about their looks. Well, most of them are. We're worried about our outfits; does it make me look fat? or does it make me look sticky? we add on a bunch of makeup and perfumes. and some are always trying to impress that "person" I myself am guilty of trying on outfit after outfit thinking about what "he" might think. ( but i don't wear makeup or perfume or anything like that) Our society sadly is based around (greatly) on our outward appearance, our status, etc.... <br>  i wish it wasn't like that but, what can you do>?|`|45f1360efad547282be68b1242ba3452aa	Yes I do.

Así son las mujeres. <br>  Amigo, si ella te interesa, habla con ella para aclarar las cosas, dile que intentarás portarte mejor con ella, que te dé la oportunidad, e intentar ser mejor con ella.<br>  <br>  Si despues de eso sigue con su misma idea, investiga si no es por otro amigo que a ella si le dé lo que contigo buscó: estar con ella.<br>  <br>  Si continua con su idea, déjala, pero "que sufra", dile que si no estan juntos como novios, pues ya no serán nada,ni amigos, ni conocidos, y que ya no la volverás a ver nunca más en la vida. Te despides de ella como si te fueras a vivir al extranjero y verás que va a recapacitar.<br>  <br>  Muchas suerte campeón!!!|`|CatTbX51aa	Significa que es poco madura o realista o que quiere un tiempo para darse cuenta si realmente te quiere como se debe querer a una pareja.

SUERTE..|`|tRtsxAPWaa	Tan sencillo como esto: ella ya no te quiere como novio, sino como amigo... probablemente porque la heriste.

kk8p6yvsaa	I wouldn't get too worked up about it.  <br>  <br>  People online are just looking for friendly people and an occasionally chat, nothing more.<br>  <br>  One reason is for that is the fact that they will never meet.|`|PNnwHp7gaa	Nope. No Aussie girl will want to walk around with a bag over her head!<br>  <br>  Best you look for one nearer to home......|`|AA11780567	Are you looking for a green card to Australia?|`|AA11128932	WHAT PROFILE?
AA12095283	.Not really.l find the free dating sites are just as good|`|rEvyV0ZWaa	haha believe it or not I tried out singlesnet.com as a joke & found the love of my life...so, you never know...
AA12178405	once you are there it doesnt make sense to leave and have a grand entrance.  since your theme is roses, maybe u could do a rose bowl entrance with guys dressed up in football gear and a big banner they can break through with cheerleaders doing a cheer behind them for you.  then you could come in parade style?  maybe it is a bit over the top.  i dont know what else would really tie in with the roses.|`|AA12274392	maybe you could have people come in with trumpets like announcing you like that trumpet noise that announces something then people come in throwing red rose petals down on the floor in front of you and then behind them you come in with your brother and his friends holding you up in a chair like a mini parade sort of thing.|`|eLHAQK1aaa	Kids these days are so flippin spoil it drives me nuts. I hope you fall off your chair.
46420c36ab2e01995959fc5c3ca500d5aa	That sounds quite rude. I wouldn't be friends with someone like you.|`|sR7jM0UCaa	.....|`|n3ZE9cIdaa	that would be real fun. but that's because you aren't in his shoes. but once you realize that your supposed-to-be true friends are making fun of you, that would really hurt you know.that's him, freckle boy, so you should just accept him.if you are a real friend.|`|posAAVmQaa	...no, no i dont
OfpUf6Dcaa	if he knows you  he will make it you don't have to tell him :)
e3cLhuEMaa	yes you have a right to be mad cause your other friend didn't give her the right to give it out and neither did you...that's really shady you don't need friends like thar|`|AA10295994	ask yourself WHY are you mad. Do you like him and want more then a friendship.|`|X1BdlzK6aa	Of course you have the right to be a little upset because that's a number you called from her phone and she has no right to be using that number to give it out.  Okay, you sister is friends with your friend, but it's still an act of violation because she could have asked you if she could use the number to give it to someone, after all she didn't know how your friend would react to this type of behavior.  However, don't take it to heart, just let her know not to do that again.  I mean a friendship is not a friendship without respect and a bit of privacy.  Just make your point straight and clear with her about respect and that shall straighten things out. I totally understand where you are coming from and she should not have done such a thing to you.<br>  <br>  Peace and love remember don't take it to yhe heart and ruin a long-term friendship if it indeed it's long-term.  If not, it's always best to be straight forward with who you are and what you want.  Clarity is the key to everything and if she's a true friend she will understand you.|`|ibeVcQyWaa	I can see why you'd be upset over her giving out his number, but not THIS upset.  She did what she did and it's sort of over now.  You need to take yourself out of the equation and let your friends sort this out.  You will get blamed for this, but there was nothing you could have done.  I think you should just drop it.|`|vULVL1jmaa	If there were no repurcussions from her giving the number to your sister (for example, if the friend didn't get mad that someone else had their number) then I don't see why you'd be upset or why, for that matter, your friend would feel the need to keep it a secret.<br>  <br>  Are you and the friend, more than friends or do you like him? If not, I don't know why she'd hide it from you and I don't know why you'd get angry. It seems a little petty on both sides and I think you should both let it go. 
AA10044906	take your time you dont have to be at his becon call|`|AA10529674	Love can't be rushed. Just tell him that even though you would love to be online with him a lot, you obviously can't because of your work schedule. But what you CAN do is arrange for a time when both of you can be online together. As for marriage, just take your time. Tell him that you don't want to get married so quickly because you want to get to know him a lot better. Be honest with him like you've been on Yahoo Answers by asking this question to complete strangers. If he really respects your feelings, he'll take things much slower.|`|28d28c17f31325c9e146ccea373e4038aa	My dear, never rush in getting married to a person you don't really know so much. look, even if you know them bear in mind that people change. If I were you, I would take my time to ensure that he is the one I would like to live the rest of my live with. And with the on-line stuff, explain your work situation to him and let him know the times that would be convenient for both of you to chat. If he really cares, he will understand. To me, to Love someone is the most beautiful experience but please don't rush.
bshkruiUaa	Just forget her.  You imagine there is a quality fish at sea.  Instead of salmon fish why not you search for a gold fish? Get what i mean? My mom always told me, look for a boyfriend not only because of their look and education, but please look to their attitude. Do he can be trust, do he can make you happy, do he say he really need you when he lonely?  see your dad, he sacrifice everything to mom, he sacrifice his left kidney to make me live longer and can see our children grow up together.  That  is what my mom said to me before my father pass away.    But my mom, still feel  that my dad still alive because his left kidney with my mom.|`|Rq1AjXWKaa	There's only one choice here. Don't take her back.<br>  <br>  Would you want to date a girl that would cheat on some one? It's as simple as that, please, don't lower your self because some one pressures you into it. If they question you for making that decision tell them "I never want to date some one who could cheat on some one they are meant to care about".|`|3761fd41d1e1924ba238ade61232efefaa	I wouldn't forgive her.

1V4nQyJJaa	maybe she doesn't like what she did and shes ashamed of it and worried what you'd think of it just talk it out with her|`|663cySmvaa	What difference does this make to your relationship?  Some people don't always want to bring up the past and would rather leave it where it belongs.  Questions about your past lovers and asking questions to your partner about your past lovers is a selfish part on our behalf.  You want to feel more significant than the past people before you...always forgetting and overlooking that they moved on and so should you.<br>  <br>  <br>  Never ask a question unless you already know the answer and don't ask your partners about their past lovers....it really shouldn't matter.  If it already makes you guys feel uncomfortable about asking these things to eachother, then stop asking.|`|AA11102036	From my experience, the more you know about each others pasts, the worse it gets - because you'll overanalyse things, like now.<br>  She probably doesn't feel comfortable talking about her past sex life, as she doesn't want to upset you. <br>  Just focus on the 2 of you and learn to move on!
zkovxRseaa	you are stalking back as well, in a way, by cooperating|`|ITNq8WU9aa	I would say that a stalker is someone who creeps you out. He is always around when you don't want him to.<br>  <br>  What you described is a guy who has not gotten over you.<br>  <br>  If these meetings start to become more and more and you do not want to see him anymore, then that would lead me to think he was a stalker.<br>  I don't believe this is the case|`|OFJL5d9vaa	you arent helping things by playing along with his infatuation with you. its clear he isnt over you and you texting back, answering and talking for over an hour is definately not helping for you or him. you either split yourself from him completely and avoid him (wouldnt recomend) or you talk to him head on and let him no where you two are an that what he is doing is unacceptable.<br>  <br>  hope this helps|`|GfNVcq7Naa	From what you've written I can't say, for a fact, that this is stalking. But, there is somethings to be said about the overload of calls and aiming to meet you after school unwelcome. He has overstepped his boundaries and you must not try to be nice any more. If you don't feel safe then there is a real problem here. Then it is stalking. He has got to learn how to back off. |`|ivsYJPx3aa	Tell him to come to your house ..its ok ...you can talk then.|`|Kv3GqU9Zaa	he sounds obessed with you! i just think he still likes you and he prob thinks he's in with another chance|`|S88Lkq5yaa	you can probably get a restraining order against him.
V8YlHXUAaa	Depends...|`|0eorp2Hhaa	idk but i no i like those 22 year old with Italian motorcycles ;)<br>  |`|K4dBXFJYaa	baby women love bikers. Let us wear some ripped up jeans and tight t-shirt and hold onto you on that sexy bike! Take us for a ride!!!

She probably wanted to get back at you as she has lots of pent up anger so she just fired off an email.  <br>  <br>  I don't think you can tell whether she still cares or not buy her email.  <br>  <br>  Perhaps she's been speaking to her friends, analysing everything to death and mulling it over for a few weeks getting worked up about it and then decided to act on her anger.|`|wQDILKHtaa	You probably really pissed her off. Stop bugging her and maybe she won't have to email you.|`|9Eo74yYMaa	She does not care. She is just forking with you. Get over it!!!
JtxiHm7xaa	I don't see the question here. Perhaps you should re examine your question and pose it to the community in a way that makes sense so that your peers can help you with your question.|`|3SNhXpf0aa	Has it ever crossed your mind that she is hurt from the breakup so is trying to use music to overcome the pain? Or maybe she just fancies that song?<br>  <br>  Chances are its the first one.|`|Fc4GZ0OKaa	Whats the question|`|NC6lcSZJaa	Talk to her about why you broke up, have a serious chat, ended up in me getting back with mine - not the same song but similar theme
sKCZftE2aa	Both are good. I'm slim and don't have a belly sticking out, so i definately like the same on a girl. Not a fan of huge boobs either for that matter. A smaller, yet perky handful is brilliant. Most importantly though, is that she have lovely eyes and a killer smile!
7fHsyHYraa	I know it's a lot of trouble for you but keep your car so close to EMPTY that the next person driving it will have to put gas in it.  Never fill it up.  Only add a gallon or two when YOU are going somewhere.  Your parents and sisters are being very inconsiderate.  Have you thought about moving into a dormitory or sharing an apartment with other college students?  Independence has a price but it might be worth it to you.|`|e7069668dbc5d373aa0855b917aa2acaaa	Just politly tell your parents that you do not have the money to pay for gas all the time if every one is gonna use gas. Tell your sister that if she wants a ride she will need to pay for gas atleast 10.00 a week or maybe 15.00 and if she can not do that. well than the good Lord gave her legs! Good Luck
7f016cd0e0e15a878bb8b3eacc536aa8aa	Yes..that's why I elected to get a home office many years ago.
PYAoFA9laa	my advice, find someone to talk to that you can trust. find a good counselor, whatever you need to do. Do not let anyone tell you that you are a slut because of a mistake. the fact that you are looking for help is a great sign. I support your friend in the issue. Just because she has done specific things does not mean her advice is worthless. All that will become of your hanging out with some dumb guy will do is make you feel even worse when he either dumps you or uses you.|`|kEy3W5ydaa	Hun you need to keep your legs together until you can handle all the consequences...STOP comparing yourself to some other girl..you are you and it has nothing to do with her....you know if you are a slut...7 guys in a year....sex all around  .....where is the commitment where is the love...you need to love yourself and respect yourself before someone else can....right now you are just another ho in the road.|`|m6LQkIrjaa	mallory listen you r asking for some advice with a problem your having don't take your mixed emotions out on anybody, it was your decision to do what you did. in certain PPL eyes you look like a slut to them but they don't know if you were willingly or did somebody force you. i can tell you to take this advice honey and keep it in your mind slow down and get checked out bcuz AIDS and HIV is one thing not to mess with you can die so do me that favor and always use protection if your going to do it at all.|`|tBXeiuBhaa	first of all don't let stupid comments like that make you mad it just people hating but for your other question just chillax there is nothing four u to worrie about ur 18 your sex life is your biz and nobody needs to be in it that doesn't make you a slut sex happens it's a way of life let it be an experiance not a regretful disicion.|`|3AKuxMM8aa	No that does not make you a slut. If you like it at the time and if he like it then no your not a slut. Go for it and try different things and have fun! As long as your safe and using protection then your good. Good Luck!|`|Ymd6VlCoaa	yes!! u need to stay away from them for a while......sooner or later you're gonna let them run your life....you'll get hurt and u'll never be able to find that one nice guy  that wouldn't hurt you for anything |`|5NaZdZZjaa	No that does not make you a slut. I think if you have feelings for someone and you feel good about having sex with them then do it. Girls, unfortunately are going to hate on you for being secure with your sexuality. :)|`|QX066pcjaa	you are only a slut if you flirt with every boy you see, just take time out, and think about what you are doing, you may find a way to tone down. hope this helps :)|`|IAuuTtU7aa	a quick tip making your WRiTiNG LikE THIs doesn;t help anyone<br>  <br>  not really a slut cos you don't seem to have it than often<br>  <br>  but be protective then nothing bad will happen :P

For example, are you wanting to tell a girl you like her or are you expressing for one that you are already with.  Just trying to help.

1426b050ed989f056bff94b40067afacaa	You don't have to tell her about the comment but you can reassure her he is no good and to move on she should trust your word if your good friends she knows you are only trying to help her|`|EWExqw09aa	It happens sometimes, we should pray for her.|`|MsuLhsv2aa	take her out and about and tell her straight out he was lying to <br>  her |`|JV0i77uiaa	You don't have to tell her all the details, she won't propably believe it.  However you can tell her of a friend that went through that.  This guy did not have the gut to tell her the true.  If you were my friend and I trust you, I would probably appreciated that you open my eyes.  But she is not me and she may thinks that's is not true.  But only time will let her know and soon or later she will find out the true.  If you have a chance to talk to your friend who broke off with girl, tell him he should be man enough to tell her the true.  Some day he would get the same treatment. He is a good coward.|`|1FKQryQzaa	dont show her the comment<br>  shes hit rock bottom<br>  if it was me i would kill myself<br>  the only thing that she is holding on <br>  to is that he still loves her<br>  take that away and she will be crushed<br>  ik it sounds bad but think if it was you<br>  if it was me i wouldnt want to know....<br>  <3Q

HAHAHA people might think youre crazy but thatll get every girl to look at you.|`|dX0jV4iSaa	slap her on the *** and tell her firmly that shes going to the prom with you (include the word ***** or ho once or twice throughout)|`|oRvVEUcuaa	Take her to the beach. Tell her to lie down in the wetter sand and make her a dress made of sand.  And whilst she is burried ask her to the prom.  Make sure that the dress is flattering!  I didn't consider the weather!  Here it is really hot and beach weather, if its snowing or cold where you are trade sand for snow?|`|tWloazyBaa	Well are you friends with her, in a relationship, anything?|`|uPccIetGaa	simply ask her that "can i have a pleasure to dance with you"

If things are best just by spending time with your ex (not dating him), then it's probably best just to be friends and leave it at that.<br>  <br>  Give the new guy a chance and I'm sure you won't regret it.|`|7de40b7cd61c4151ad634facc2beaa63aa	Essentially you want to be happy in your life so you must be with someone who can make you happy.<br>  <br>  You want someone who has something going for themself and not a slacker.|`|EmTEppXFaa	Totally Renegade, the more the marry-er|`|O0jk4UHGaa	no problem 3 some

Q3AKSvn3aa	I am in a long distance relationship now and it is certainly not easy but can be really great. (currently long distance due to his deployment). <br>  <br>  I don't know why your boyfriend gets so moody, he may just be having a bad day. I would be frustrated by the fact that he refuses to talk about what is bothering him. Tell him how you feel when he refuses to talk to you about this. Sorry I can't be more help. I have no idea what is wrong with him.|`|ae3ecab489f9cbbdd2b51fb0492f64d3aa	Long distance relationships can last for a period of time but eventually you have to decide how to be together or it will just fade out. Sometimes it is just not enough to talk or e-mail. Sometimes you really have to feel that person and I mean physically. I suggest you two talk about how you can be together permanently.|`|p0MUCtj1aa	Sometimes boys suck at talking on the phone.  It is a fact of life.  My boyfriend and I are long distance during the summer and we are very happy together even though we only talk about once a week.<br>  My biggest lesson was to stop putting other peoples expectations on my relationship.  I know he loves me even if he doesn't like to talk on the phone very much.<br>  Just be happy that you are young and in love, and don't listen to what other people say.  To trust someone loves you is hard to do, and if you believe that he loves you, then he definitely feels for ya.|`|NPamPtSgaa	I'm sorry, but in the long run, long distance relationships aren't really worth the time and effort.|`|h5w8MiIDaa	i live in centreville va and my bf lives in st louis buttttt its really hard to keep it up sometimes your attention wil stray but you gotta try call him at least 3 times a week email him etc|`|u01JWYhPaa	long distance relationships can be full of alot of lies so beware
86NkB2OCaa	well for me, you can't ask her for a date if she really don't want to have a boyfriend for the time being. u can state your feelings to her even your not in a date. if your main goal is for her to know what you feel, then go ahead tell her, no need for the drama of a fine dining in a classy sassy restaurant and flowers. just find a suitable time, maybe after the movie "date" with her, tell her what you really feel, that she  is more than a friend for you. assure her that your not asking for an answer immediately and your willing to wait for her. stress to her that you liked it that way, that both of you hanging out together, enjoying each other company. tell her that you wish your friendship wouldn't change, that she wouldn't avoid you after your confession. good luck! =)
eL6lg9j0aa	Hahaha. I've had problems like this, where the guy just poked his tongue in my mouth and left it there.<br>  <br>  It's hard to be tactful in these situations, but the best thing to do is be honest, and set an example, when you're kissing her and her tongue starts to get a bit....ferocious, I suppose, just pull away a bit and say "I really like it when we don't use much tongue, it's so much more sensual." or something along those lines.<br>  <br>  If you're too chicken to say it, just keep pulling away a little when she jams her tongue down your throat. She'll get the message haha.<br>  <br>  Hope this helped.|`|YbGULYAwaa	mmmmm thats a hard 1.<br>  <br>  I dont really think there is an easy way with out hurting her feelings.<br>  <br>  Maybe one day when your kissing you could just kindly say to calm it down a little.<br>  <br>  If that doesn't work you might just have to tell her straight out but remember her feeling so do it gently just ask her for a little less tongue.<br>  <br>  hope this helps.|`|c9fZNMi8aa	don't you dare tell her!hahahah! no matter how you say it, she will get offended. just kiss her slowly without a tongue so she will not going to use her tongue too. she will get use to it and might realize that the kiss is more sincere without using too much tongue. goodluck!!!|`|SfaQbZqpaa	you don't. no matter how you say it shes gonna take it as shes a bad kisser and its gonna start an unnecessary fight. So unless its that unbearable just let it go

Yeah, we're best friends, but we are very different, when she's at my place so many little things she does piss me off.  Like she doesn't like syrup, so she eats her pancakes with her fingers, and her body language is horrendous.  So don't think that you guys are messed up, I think that it's just nature's way of telling us to get away from the other one!|`|KXcedehOaa	look at your question, the answer is right in there, you argue because you guys have spent too much time together, and get on your nerves and are sick of eachother, this happens when ppl are around eachother too much, you become too comfortable, dont worry its completely normal.
hhRDjIvZaa	Ahaha! They were talking about you. x) <br>  <br>  LL|`|EnkSP0Vtaa	We always go to the bathroom together, I don't know why we just do, and if we happen to talk about the boys we are with while we are in the bathroom, then so be it.
AA12242730	This could actually go two ways:  A lot of girls simply enjoy being around a guy they know likes them, even if they don't like them back.  It is a huge ego boost, plus its fun to see you squirm.  On the other hand, she may still have some feelings for you but for some reason she is afraid to get serious with you again.  The best way to play this without looking like a jerk or looking dumb is to be upfront and honest.  Tell her you made a mistake, you do want her back.  Tell her that you definitley have feelings for her, and you think that she has feelings for you.  Also advise her that you do not play games, so if she honestly doesn't have any feelings for you to move on so you can as well.|`|2CmDL3ysaa	get a boom box, flowers, chocolates....<br>  park your car outside her wnidow<br>   hold the boom box over your head and play the song "baby come back". then when she comes back give her the flowers and chocolates andd then take her out. it'll work. trust me.|`|AA10107040	Sounds like she is scared that you will break up with her again, so you need to take it slowly. Ask her to go somewhere with you but not as a date. Don't make it end up being a date either, unless she tells you she wants to have it that way. It will make her feel safer around you. Oh, and for goodness sake stop asking her if she likes you, she doesn't like the pressure that you are putting on her.|`|ee5d4dbc31c28ff670204f084e57def9aa	Well for one thing, She needs to stop playing these mind games.  Giving you mixed signals. Telling you that she doesn't have feelings for you yet she's flirting.  You need to ask her straight out if she likes you.  If she does then go for it, other than that you need to tell her to quit playing these mind games.|`|AA11594273	It sounds like because she knows you still want her that she is kind of playing with you a little.  Maybe what you should do is tell her that your feelings are real and that if she doesn't want to be a part of your life that she should stop with the games and sending the mixed signals.|`|HUCyXpmDaa	Unfortunately when a woman decides she likes or doesn't like you, you can't do much to change her mind without crossing the line.

THANKS.......|`|AA11933435	That question goes right to the point of what 'love' is, really, to make a relationship work, and to make it last.<br>  <br>  What is Love??? Wow... philosophers and poets have been trying to answer that question for thousands of years, and there is no short and easy answer to that one. Love, unfortunately... is notably complex. There's little question of that. But... many agree that 'love' as a word, expression, or feeling, cannot stand alone. For love to be complete and to work, it requires a great many things. And yes, my reply here is long, but love... is not so simple a thing. This is a fact that cannot be denied.<br>  <br>  Most tend to agree, that for love to work, and to be real and true, it must have what is alternately known as fidelity, faithfullness, loyalty, or devotion, all words that mean pretty much the same thing. But there's more... that makes love real and true.Very importantly, love requires communication. The importance of communication cannot be stressed strongly enough. Love often fails, and quite unnecessarily, simple because of a lack of good open communication. Lovers... should be able to talk about positively anything and everything, at any time, and with a real respect for the feelings and views of one's love. And yes, it's very important to actually listen, and to ask questions, camly, when something isn't understood. Understanding, empathy, kindness, compassion, and flexibility... are very important. Lovers must be very able and very willing to accommodate one another, and it must be completely mutual.<br>  <br>  To love... means to express genuine companionship, to develop a real and deep actual friendship, and to provide a goodly portion of sweet personal attention as needed, and there must be generosity or unselfishness, and a respectable level of real trust and honesty. Trust and honesty are essential, and both must provide this in considerable proper measure. And the total reduction of petty jealousies is important, as is learning to not allow the 'little things' to become a big problem. And love cannot persist if one or both in a relationship is unreasonabe, inflexible, or overly demanding. Love positively requires a lot of adjustment and compromises. It also requires a true measure of mutual respect. Respect... is important.<br>  <br>  Love requires giving of one's self to the full, holding, and being there for one's love in the best of times and the worst of times. Love... takes strength, dedication and uncommon patience. Love... means to feel joy, with the one you hold so dear, and it's very important that it's indeed deeply mutual :-)<br>  <br>  And of course... what happens in the bedroom (or wherever) must be good, enthusiastic, and mutual. And I address the subject of sex, only because it's impossible to overstate its real importance, and it should not be ignored. It can't be. When it comes to sex, it shouldn't be permitted to become bland or routine. Sex, while in love, is the very best kind. Nothing equals it. Nothing. And being sexually compatible is important, and the there must be real respect for one's partner's sexual needs, feelings, and... limitations. Love does not permit for the forcing of someone to do something sexually, that they truly do not want to do. That is unreasonable and unfair. Love means caring about the actual sexual confort of one's loving partner. And this doesn't mean that one shouldn't be flexible and accommodating, but obviously we all have certain limits, and there's little doubt about that.<br>  <br>  The last thing I want to mention, which is the cause of love failing, commonly bringing a very sad end to many otherwise good relationships, is the acts and actions that attempt, for whatever reason, to force major 'changes' in the person that one loves, with the hope of molding and shaping them into what one wishes them to be. If you feel that you have to coerce or persistantly demand big or numerous changes in your lover's behaviors, habits, personality, character, moods, spirit, religion, politics, or any other major aspect of their being... then one are destined to fail, and miserably. People cannot be changed so radically, and they will resist such changes, fight them, and eventually such attempts will lead to a split, and usually a loud, unpleasant, hurtful... or even a dangerous one, with some. Ultimately, if the person isn't what you wanted them to be in the first place, then quite simply... you chose the wrong partner, and you should have kept searching, until you've found the person with the qualities that you want in a person as a lover and a mate. And note that very likely, the 'perfect' mate simply doesn't exist. Such is usually the stuff of dreams and fantasies, so, personally I suggest that one finds the best person for them that they can, then learn to accept the little things that arent 'perfect', an acceptance which itself is born of love- that tolerance of those things that are... just as they are... and likely always will be :-)<br>  <br>  Now, how's THAT... for 'detail'? :-D<br>  <br>  ~ Jonathan Rich

62loNBx9aa	Romance, on a tight budget, doesn't need to be cheap. Like many others have recommended - go all out!  Work within your means to make it special.  <br>  <br>  Plan like you're going on a night out on the town, but you're at home. That includes dressing up (high heals mandatory say the male population), beautiful hairstyle, makeup, etc. Just think of how you would plan something special if you were away from home on vacation.  <br>  <br>  Tidy up the house by hiding everything. Aside from candles, use aroma to spruce up the senses.  Remember, create ambiance, mood and romance. Do little thing like having the table set with matching dishes and napkins, and be creative with paper napkin rings celebrating the day of your anniversary.  Finally, include a menu of dinner and after dinner activities.  Men tend to be visual; they'll notice your creativity, so don't forget to be overly organized and asymmetrical.  Cap the night with a romantic movie or romantic comedy you both enjoy, and perhaps even a nice brisk walk late at night. <br>  <br>  Hope you have fun!!|`|X05Jiim4aa	Definately prepare his favorite meal, candle lit.

If their saying really bitchy things wouldn't your best friend be better off if she didn't know espically as you guys all work together therefore your best friend has to see them regularly. i can understand why you would tell her, thinking she has a right to know and don't get me wrong i would feel the same but from personal experiences i find it makes the person you tell feel lower and more self conscious which isn't good, because although people say "i don't care what others think" if they know people are laughting/gossiping about something they are doing there soon stop because its a constant reminder there getting made fun off and everyone in life doesn't like people dislikely them espically making fun of them.<br>  only solution i can think of is for you and your best friend to ignore those gossip goblins and have fun together observing their silly behaviour, show how you guys are having fun and their stupid little comments will do nothing to stop you laughting and enjoying work! :D<br>  xx|`|wur42yPgaa	i agrre with you.

If you did, what would there be to look forward to? <br>  <br>  Be thankful when you don't know something, for it gives you the opportunity to learn.<br>  <br>  Be thankful for the difficult times. During those times you grow.<br>  <br>  Be thankful for your limitations, because they give you opportunities for improvement.<br>  <br>  Be thankful for your mistakes.

You're rushing it. Find a gurl... Become friends slowly!... Then later on think about dating. Be her friend and show her you're going to be there for her. I'd say friendship for atleast a month if not more...|`|Ds7AN1i7aa	are you corny or weird or maybe you smell... no dont take it seriously and plus whos cares if you get rejected theres allways other girls
aapFvNg3aa	riesgo siempre hay porque las pastillas anticonceptivas no son 100% efectivas.. deberias cuidarte con otro metodo tambien.. <br>  es raro q no te haya venido pq las pastillas te regularizan el ciclo.. asi q yo diria q te hagas un test de embarazo por las dudas, suerte..|`|kq9QzP2Iaa	si las tomaste todas correctamente, no hay posibilidad de que te embaraces, probablemnte no te ha bajado porque estas estresada pensando en eso|`|aIE3wC3Raa	Hacete un test es lo mejor que podes hacer en estos casos recuerda que es en los posibles dias de tu periodo no antes. Y en ayunas de liquidos y sin haber ido al ba?o. Urgente haztelo! <br>  Y hazte cargo de lo que suceda pero si te cuidaste con preservativo no veo que tengas que preocuparte.
5rgyweFbaa	My last 2 relationships have actually both been long distance - one didn't work because I just lost feelings and the other probably would have worked out if we lived closer<br>  <br>  They were both over a year long and we only saw eachother twice during the year. <br>  <br>  Long distance relationships are different for everyone, so I am not going to tell you that you are doomed :) But the hardest thing in my opinion is that nothing makes up for actually spending time with someone on a regular basis...so when you are in a long distance relationship where you only see someone once or twice a year - you spend most of the initial time you are back together trying to get back into the groove with eachother. Remembering how it feels to be together....if you can make it past this stage (or never have this stage) then I would say your outlook is good....But if it is awkward then you never know.<br>  <br>  Good luck! and i hope things work out|`|gFiaG6wTaa	Umm well we do get along well and we are figuring out how to see each personally.She loves me dearly and I want to show her the same in person.|`|bea6991cc04521373d597c05fbe1f296aa	I guess it would be fairly hard! I've been seeing a girl who lives some distance from me and it seems to work ok, but we see each other a lot more often than once a year.|`|53b5a85717ed0371fdf1fd99178d5606aa	naw didn't work out.. =(|`|5XxVQ8w3aa	No it didn't work..it lasted a week.<br>  <br>  but im 13 so that could've been the prob. because i moved from my old town to a new one and the guy from were i used to live asked me out and he didn't know i moved till i told him lol|`|iODqTb1laa	it depends on both of you

AA12095283	Well if she can decifer your lingo,may'be.
f1f028e1b87f4263abe46dd6cf2aa259aa	They say 'men use love to get sex, women use sex to get love'. <br>  <br>  So depends on which gender answers your question.  But most women will say sex isn't important, most men will say it is.|`|169f0f3f3078086407af37611825f7abaa	Love is more important! Sex means more when u love someone! Love will always be there even if you stop having sex later on (when ur old).... so love its totally the most important thing|`|RiVp52Ntaa	Love is more important because with me, there won't be any sex unless I love that person.  Also, when you're in love with that person, sex is a LOT more fun, you know you can trust them, and it means a whole lot more.  Sex is meant to be an intimate act, not something you do with just anyone.. that's why I think it's critical that you love and are IN love with a person before you have sex...<br>  <br>  Also.. there's not really much of a point in dating someone if you don't love them, right?  It's just a waste of time.  You could accomplish a lot more and have much more passionate sex with someone you actually loved and cared about.|`|T6zkEwd6aa	Love is more important to me. If there is no love then sex is meaningless.
AA11665495	Jessica Alba
N6X5rkWQaa	Not necessarily.  I have seen many couples you could call "mismatched".  A lot of the picky-ness tends to occur more when people are younger.  As people are in the dating scene longer they tend to lower their standards and give Mr/s. Personality a shot.  Then they realize that looks aren't everything.  <br>  <br>  Snobbiness is an instant ugly-afier.  Sure you get looked at, but no one will approach you except the troll guys who have no clue what NO means.|`|aOtiIgYSaa	Yes actually (which is quite lousy on certain people) but i believe that its more abou peer pressure and social status-lyk you have to be seen with the right people. if ya get me?|`|583e5d537a6d410ad98990c6d6250044aa	No.  People assume that, but it is based on the individual.  Everyone has a right to be picky no matter what they look like.  No one has a right to be snobby though.|`|12272f49d6c0da0443855ea3602a455caa	Broad brush my man. I've met a lot of ugly choosy/picky girls. <br>  snobs come in all shapes. <br>  <br>  as far as hot girls being picky, well they want good babies that look nice so... yeah probably pretty picky. I'm fine with it.<br>  <br>  I play within my range, and don't go out of it.|`|7e8a79679077253ba19f7c7646511819aa	Of course, that's the way it goes. Pretty girls get the hunks and the hunks get the babes. Or the very wealthy average men get the babes too. Life's cruel, but that's the way it goes.|`|AA12186556	well if they aren't whores they usually just start falling in love with someone.|`|NSCN8dyLaa	Yes|`|84c5a932ff70a051b8ec3676232914a5aa	Contrary to popular belief a girl typically picks a guy that she is compatible with. You can't base any relationship on looks alone and expect it to work out. Sure they're a plus, but personality is much more important.|`|C4aqbyYTaa	well, i think for most attractive girls, their standards for a boyfriend are higher. they know that they can get probably whoever they want. so most girls are gonna want someone attractive as well. i dont think that makes them snobby, i think it makes them human.|`|FpXgePYgaa	and they are usually very High Maintenance.....Once I did see a really beautiful young lady hanging all over this really ugly weird looking dude, figured he must have been extremely wealthy|`|RZqtJSlsaa	Of course they are. They are just too "hot" to be seen with just anyone...|`|SNRRIHT9aa	how many of them do you see with really nice fat guys with no jobs???|`|W0y5rtLTaa	no most of the aren't snobby..believe it or not some attractive girls don't always get the guy they want|`|c5d1dc06e2970a709bd64f96afb36439aa	No, I'm not, but thanks for calling me attractive!|`|ZVnf72skaa	all the pretty girls in satan island where im from are and i cant say bad shiit about them because im one of them too hahah.|`|ZbDpSuXwaa	no, cause im one of them. well actually...|`|ayGOSG0laa	I suppose it depends on whether they know they are attractive! It sounds silly but so many girls out there dont realise how pretty they are. Its usually easy to tell if they think theyre gorgeous though and if they are arrogant my mates say it puts them off.|`|bVfZgYZuaa	Us being attractive doesn't mean we're snobby. That's just a sterio type. No, I think it just seems like we're more picky because we have a ton of guys to choose from.<br>  <br>  Crystal-----XxX|`|fbdcc6c92c8ece768c3b9792412117c2aa	Yes they are
7GzUChe6aa	sorry that she does not seem to love you as you love her. she said that she does not love you, so you have to respect her. you risk offending her if you do not respect her wishes. you could also scare her if you pursue her to much and she feels like you are stalking her. if two people are meant to be together they will. trust that and be friends. it is good that she did not tell you to leave her alone because you can be friends with her. do you know if the guy she likes likes her? because if he does not you can be there as a friend for her and once she realizes she cannot have him and what a great guy you are you could have a chance to pursue a romantic relationship. <br>  <br>  considering she wants to be friends and likes another guy she probably was telling you the truth that she does not love you (though her feelings could change in the future right now she does not love you) but she was nice to you why? because she is just a nice person, she did not want to hurt your feelings, and she sees you as a friend. i would not read anything into her kindness. but you still have reason to hope that her feelings for you will change. but you have to realize right now she just sees you as a friend.<br>  <br>  if you try to make another pitch to win her heart you risk losing even her friendship. and i think in the long run you have a better chance of winning her heart by being able to be friends because you told her you love her so there should not be any confusion as to how you really feel (sometimes a girl likes a guy friend but thinks there is no future for it because he just likes her as a friend but you have clearly indicated your love for her) and you can support her as only a dear friend can. she is going to see that. then, hopefully, she will come around and realizes it is you she loved and wanted all along.<br>  <br>  you could definately try asking her to the senior ball. if the guy she likes does not ask her she might say yes to you. she might see it as going with a friend, but you could help her not miss out on going to the senior ball and she will probably appreciate that. especially because she will know she can trust you which might not be true of some guys who could ask her to go with them.|`|AA11933435	I... have already given private advice on this matter.  So... are you going to ignore it... or wait until enough people tell you that you should give it another shot... all against my advice?<br>  <br>  I'd have have to ask- why ask for my advice, if you're just going to ask others... for different advice... until you decide to do what may very well be the wrong thing to do???<br>  <br>  You're risking becoming more the persistant perst or stalker... and you may lose her as a friend - - -<br>  <br>  ~ Jonathan Rich
v0aYB5braa	CUTE     AMAZING   CREATIVE   i'd say yes!|`|zTzPyfVlaa	aww that is such a creative idea and cute =] i wish i knew more guys willing to do something like that! have fun at homecomming  <3|`|C88iHJHjaa	im steeling that...=genius|`|lSw1p9Dsaa	That's a great idea!!! She HAS to say yes! Good luck! :)
d5b952e4ff7e277adc53d59e2417a9f7aa	Hell yeah you can! <br>  <br>  Some of the best friendships EVER are the ones that pick up right where they left off.  If you and your friend are truly close, the matter of a year is nothing!  <br>  <br>  People grow apart when they are apart simply because the things that they related to before were present in BOTH of their lives...now that you have been apart you are both experiencing different day to day things and it's hard to relate on a day to day basis like that.  The fundamental reasons for your friendship, and your initial chemistry as friends are really the underlying issues.  If you have a strong foundation, you will remain strong friends!<br>  <br>  Another hurdle that people at times find hard to overcome is the feeling that if you were once the best of best of best friends ever and haven't spoken for awhile it means that you can't be friends...or you can't be those BEST friends all over again....worry not!  <br>  <br>  Promise things will be okay.|`|BykL0txuaa	Yes, and no.  Depends on how much work you put into rekindling the friendship bonds and how much each of you had changed in that amount of time.  Sometimes friends just grow out of each other's sphere of interest and don't have much in common anymore.  Sometimes its easy to pick up where you left off.  Depends on the friend and the situation, but it is possible.|`|Zc8gpK1Uaa	Definintly i lost touch with my best mate for 3 years, we found each other again and its like we never had that time apart.<br>  She is my ***** lol and im soo glad i found her again if anything our friendship is 10 times better than what it eva was xx|`|iAyGdSvzaa	i think so as long as u kept in cpntact w/ that friend :) even if u didnt u still can be good friends or maybe not i wasnt w/ my best friend for 4 years but i try to contact him|`|LXAnAWb4aa	you can be... as long as the two of you will not change and will stay the same until the day you'll see each other again... because a strong friendship will last forever if no one will try to break it...
cn1VNRGuaa	talk to him see how he feels,tell him how you feel,
Zc8gpK1Uaa	There no tactful way of doing it unfortunetly.<br>  I had this problem with a mate and i just told them straight out be honest and respectful at the same time|`|AA12102827	be honest and straight to the point ....|`|046473fd7f160fe7a30e657aa5faaf75aa	There is no tactful way really.  If the person is a family member you can be more straight forward.  Perhaps you can say, "It looks like you are a bit behind in your housework, can I help you?" or just grab a broom and dig in!  It never helps to criticize someone without offering helpful suggestions.  Maybe the person is depressed or overworked.  <br>  Remember you are a guest in whomever's home you are talking about.  If you can't stand the mess, and don't want to help out, don't visit.  Ask them to your house instead.
mImYBFOFaa	you should talk to him, find out why you are always fighting and how you can solve the problem, you shouldn't give up on love to easily, give it a try and if that doesn't work then rather let him be.|`|XTiyy72caa	Yeah if he want you to forget about him, do it.|`|AA11322508	That means he's hoping u still like him alot so when he gets horny he can hit on u and u will submit because u think it's going to work out again.

06f1b8496562ceae60b7c13272bc0615aa	If you are over 18 you dont need permission to buy a car. Youre an adult. So quit whining like a 6 year old and go get a car.|`|d4d01c5238047e6763938fef9ff7fc3caa	A couple of things to consider before you act on any advice you get here:<br>  <br>  1.  You live in his house, you live by his rules.  If you go against him, you had best be ready to move out right away.  (Always be prepared for the worst case scenario).<br>  <br>  2.  Things always seem worse today than they will tomorrow.  Talk to your mechanic and find out what it would take to make the van run the way you want it to.  If you are having engine trouble, ask how much to rebuild the engine, instead of replacing it piece by piece like you are doing now.  After  you get it fixed up, you'll look back and this won't have seemed so bad.<br>  <br>  3.  If you are confident of not getting thrown out of the house, then assert yourself and start shopping for the used car that you feel best suits your needs.  If you stand up to your father, he may see that you are grown and responsible enough to make your own decisions.  (Don't buy a piece of crap car though, it will undermine you and make you look incapable).<br>  <br>  The most important thing is to thoroughly think your decision through.  A lot of advice you will get here is short, simple, and may be what you want to hear. (i.e.  Screw him, go get yo'self a car!).  Just take it with a grain of salt.  You may find a better solution when you aren't even looking for it.<br>  <br>  Good luck, and look before you leap...|`|AA10037504	This is a complicated matter...if you're parents are not paying for your college then there's nothing keeping you from moving out! Put an ad in the paper, get a couple of roommates and access the money to buy a small, used car. <br>  <br>  Then you can begin carpooling with some other people or your roommates. You'll save money the way and start living like an adult. You're at the age where you need to begin making your own decisions...independent of your Father.<br>  <br>  If your parents are paying for your college, then you're screwed...you're at Dad's mercy until you graduate. You can still carpool with someone, can't you? What about public transportation?<br>  <br>  Wishing you luck...|`|Zc8gpK1Uaa	U are ur own man now u earn ur own money u are in your own education.<br>  Get out of the control stage with ur parents get urself a car and live ur life the way you want to not the way ur parents want to.<br>  One day they might not be around so learn now and be independant the fact that you want the independance just makes it betta good luck sweetie xxx
2000da2b76133bf99f5c089828aafcd9aa	The next time you guys are meeting up somewhere, when he comes up to you just stare at him lovingly until he says hey or hello whatever then hug him and kiss him on the cheek and say - you had me at _____ (whatever greeting he used) - its the Jerry MacGuire line. If he doesn't get it then just smile and take him around the corner tell him you like him and want to spend more time with him - tell him to let you know when kiss him on the cheek and walk away ( make sure he' has your number before you walk away) :)

You need to really sit and talk with her about it. Just tell her that those pictures make you feel really nervous about her going away for so long. If she refuses to talk to you about him then well....thats a BIG sign that she likes the guy. I don't know how the European culture works but my thought is, a girlfriend shouldn't have pictures of her and a guy kissing each other all around the place..thats wrong and really disrespectful to you..But just try and talk to her and ask her if she is serious about you two or not and it might help to meet this guy that shes friends with..Hope everything works out!!
RdQtT6HIaa	I think that you are confused with your feelings. This girl is just your friend if she like you she wouldn't be trying to set you up with her friends. Do you know if she is unhappy with her bf? If she is happy then I doubt that she will want to be with you. Perhaps your friend was just joking you may have confused her friendship for other feelings. you seem to like this other girl so i think that you should go for it. You broke up with your ex  for a reason and maybe you should give this other girl a chance. I think you should forget your friend as she has a bf and it could ruin your friendship if you tell her and your friendship with her bf and your FRIEND! good luck!|`|KsCIJHnqaa	i must confess that we all fall prey of such sometimes in our daily lives just because we do not real know how to love or how truly whether we are in love or in lust and we concluse to say that we are falling in love.if you fall would you feel better again,so you rise in true love.<br>  i think you dont truly love the new girl it is just that your friend gave you a hint about her and it suddenly caught your minds off to her.check yourself you will agree with me.<br>  As i use to tell my friends that if an AIDS patient is not told for years he/she may not die early but as soon as they hear of it that very day they died but you may still see them look gud but it is only the cracass you see not true pix.<br>  pls becarefull let God direct your steps.ciao|`|b7ac7ce11ff55bf286172d1affc4f56daa	Just leave it, trust me you really don't need to put yourself in that situation right now.

Cztv8y3Yaa	I say, both of them are just as bad.|`|7d1446035dfa270e9f7c8bd79088f25baa	-physcial is worse|`|j7SfYjAAaa	I think both are the same. Either way somebody is going to get hurt. I HATE cheaters! They are pathetic jerks! What's the point of having a bf or gf if you cheat on them?|`|7G5f4Vzoaa	both are pretty bad but i would say emotional.   You shouldnt love another guy when your with you partner but you also shouldnt cheat on someone when you dont care for the other person.|`|a268c12b5ec47775ab6f4e878095ab26aa	emotional is worse. It only takes a few moments of bad judgment to get physical with someone out of lust. but an emotional attachment to someone is a much deeper connection.
lImbqpAmaa	yea u are, i knoe some very short guys dating very hot girls! girls usually judge u on how confident you appear so even if u r not...act it|`|1aFSnPGVaa	your fine- if you feel uncomfortable with someone taller than you just date shorter girls, mamoth guys a mile high can be intimidating.  hold your head high youll be fine.|`|VgCQGNrKaa	no.|`|b5yWXdRBaa	It souldn't  matter how tall you are what matters is how you feel about yourself. I'm sure that your gf wouldn't matter either|`|nN4ReU9aaa	aww i love short guys!!! there sexy! and fun to hang out with and ive dated tones of guys shorter than me
7a5f428982fc6c711546c73a64461a69aa	Stop being materialistic and look at the inside.. is he a jerk? Or is he nice? Is he smart or stupid?|`|ca3d66e27603c03c4b25863ec1659951aa	It not what is on the outside it is what is in the inside. The look does not make a person. What different does it make if his hair is long as long he is a nice person. That is what matters. Go for it and if it does not work out then you can go your way and he can go his way. Good Luck.
mAwiGKBmaa	if i didn't notice you<br>  you'd probably go down the drain<br>  <br>  but I'm sure i wold coz you'd have a shiny smile plastered on your face that would glow the bathroom up. sweet, cute, nice, funny AND handsome.|`|ab08ce8d0c96d3f3b3c871c338bb4351aa	what a stupid question|`|lImbqpAmaa	well i wouldn't do anything to you if i didn't know u were there!|`|ponbWrigaa	Stab you.<br>  <br>  No questions asked.|`|Q7I88l0caa	um throw you out the window!! your 2 inches tall!!!|`|sNRbowvZaa	i would throw u in trash

zs3xMXGHaa	For one just be your self and maybe find what she likes and start talking about that. Then work in maybe a date.I hope it works out for you.
MV4QN2maaa	You're worried about him and his feelings, yet you have the fear that he will spread gossip about you to others.........dumping him would be no problem for me.<br>  <br>  Just say that it's time for you to get back into your (studies or work, hobbies or friends, etc.), and that you will not be available for quite some time.|`|eY005pu8aa	See what happens when you lie? Women are so cruel and self-serving. You led this poor bastard on and now you have to deal with him not disappearing when you conveniently need him to.<br>  <br>  Now is the time to adopt the honesty policy. Tell him that you lied before and have not had feelings for him. Tell him you did it to spare him pain. At least let him try to take some dignity away from this. This is the only way for this to truly end. Or just keep lying and he will be your albatross forever.|`|lwnH4Es3aa	First off if you are dating someone you should not be embarrass of them/other ppl knowing<br>  And second just be like had I sorry dude but this is not working for me, and if he asks why tell him and if he offers to change or says he will tell him no you dont want the relationship you made a mistake!<br>  Trust me thats how I dump the few guys I went out with!|`|bWFoBubeaa	You should tell him how you feel - the longer it goes on the harder it will be for both of you. <br>  <br>  It might seem hard now, but you will feel better for breaking up with him as soon as possible. The last thing you want is to feel stuck in a situation you don't want to be in.<br>  <br>  Good luck whatever you decide to do...|`|neq6RrJzaa	Just walk right up to him, grab him by the shirt and scream "It's OVER MUTHAFKERRR!!!!!"<br>  <br>  Then you push him aside, flick your hair and keep walking.<br>  Now that's handling the situation with style ;)|`|KJP0FMNKaa	i think a week is too short to make statments. Tell him you two can be friends, because friends can talk all the time without having to worry about complicated issues like liking/disliking one another.  Tell him your feelings.|`|m6vPqKVtaa	ok well you should definately tell him its not working immediately...one week isnt really too long so whose going to honestly think you were having a relationship!?!?! if he is jerk enough to say anything to other people just to get back to you (emotional blackmail!?!?) then you have every right to tell them that you guys just went out a couple of times but were never serious!!!and if he asks you why you said you love him just tell him it was how you felt at that moment!!!! and tell him you'd still lke to be friends!!!! just to keep the peace.
AA12392885	i would tell her to stop acting that way or im not clubbing with you anymore. don't let her embarrass you like that.|`|1M6pjWttaa	First off, I am sooo sorry. I was the drunk, idiot friend my freshman year of college and it took my friends sitting down with me and expressing their concern to get me to pay attention. I still drink and go out but I am more careful. Knowing that my friends cared enough to express concern was all I needed. Good Luck!|`|bIvQ1htJaa	Find someone else to hang out with. It doesn't sound like you guys mesh all that well anyways. Taking care of someone who's had too much to drink is ok - once in a while. But you're not a babysitter, and you shouldn't have to do this every time you guys go out. Hang out with people who will take care of YOU and let YOU get tipsy for a change!
vFF2cEHfaa	Maury baby!!! Free boot camp with that. And then you get a free trip out to where they tape it. I think it's in ILL. <br>  <br>  Hey I'm being realistic here. Some people don't have the money fot boot camp|`|F8HIS4djaa	Take him to a juvenile detention center, then to the welfare line and then to visit some homeless.  I don't know which one he would like best.  Some people don't want anything in their lives and are happy that way.  Leave him alone and live your life safely away from your son.|`|bhBYqfghaa	it seems that your son has reach a high point, it is natural on teens at his age, although it is different for every body, they all share one thing in common, they all belive to know the absolute truth. there is a program that can help you out, it is call boot camp and here is a website for you to check them out. <a href="http://www.bootcampsforteens.com/" rel="nofollow">http://www.bootcampsforteens.com/</a>|`|gKNfgd5caa	I AM 24 AND WHEN MY BEHAVIOR STARTED GOING TO THAT ROUTE MY MOM DID NOT THINK ABOUT IT TWICE AND SENT ME TO BOOT CAMP. <br>  <br>  THAT WAS THE MOST CRAZIEST INTENSE EVENT IN MY LIFE. 6 MONTHS LATER I HAD LEARNED TO LOVE LIFE AND EVERY GOOD AND BAD OBSTACLE IN IT. I LEARNED TO HAVE A CHARACTER,BUT HUMBLE.<br>  I LEARNED TO ACCEPT THE THINGS THAT I CANNOT CHANGE AND MAKE THE BEST OF IT. I GRADUATE HIGH SCHOOL, I TOOK A YEAR OFF.

YCXxP43Laa	You will never know whether a decision will be the right one or not. I would invite him in your case, if only to get back into contact with your friends. I don't get the who gets the friends deal at all. People have a choice, and if they are mutual friends then they have the right to remain friendly with you both, unless they disagree with the way one of you treated the other. It sounds like your ex may have feelings for you, but your awkwardness suggests you don't feel the same way? if you don't have feelings for him them don't lead him on, but explain how much you've missed his friendship, and he is still has an important place in yo9ur life. Invite him as well, it is a good ice breaker. good luck, have lots of fun :-)|`|VtTU4KcNaa	Absolutely, invite him.  There's no better way to show him and your friends that there are no hard feelings.  He obviously still cares about you if he had tears in his eyes the last time you talked and you obviously still consider him a friend.  And why would you need to discuss "who gets the friends"?  These are people who were friends to both of you, not things or children.  It's not like a divorce where you decide who gets the house, the car and the dog or on which days you get the kids.|`|EsmUNsOUaa	baby girl, It'd be a damned sin if you didn't!!!!<br>  His friends are also yours, you know....just a side note. You don't have to stop talking to anyone. I still talked to my dude after the uncalled mutual agreement that it was over. I still talk to him, he's my bud-bud, you know? INVITE HIM.....if you don't it'd be a sad sad waste of invitaton to use on someone else|`|MkQq28laaa	you should invite him.maybe you and him were mean to be together back.gud luck!|`|9LjZ1Q3Naa	Yes, but be casual around him. And don't exclusively talk to him.|`|1sfJ4M1kaa	You have to decide if you really want him back in your life again or not. Breaking up with someone is hard because it is like loosing a best friend. But you also have to remember that you broke up for a reason. Also you have to ask yourself if you want to invite him just as a friend or if you still have feelings for him. Ultimately you have to make the decision for yourself but I think you should go ahead and invite him to see how things go. If they don't work out at least you gave it your best shot. 
Zc8gpK1Uaa	just go up and start a convo.<br>  Hi how are you and drop the fact that youve called him into the convo.<br>  Be confident and smile thats all you can do and just see if you get a response|`|83fa794af32a5767098d3af02be1ac93aa	Well you should already know that he doesn't want to talk to you because he hasn't called you back yet. It really doesn't matter if he's shy or not, if he really did like you then he would have called. don't ya think? just forget that you called him. maybe he just needs time to call you, or he's still trying to work up his nerves to call you, because he's so shy.
AA10471659	Write her a letter telling her why you were a jackass to her. I have had to use the written word to tell a girl that I was totally in love with but couldn't tell her any other way. She was very nice to me after that. Try it you have nothing to lose but the girl.  May the words be with you.|`|kWOtGEpbaa	she didnt use. u should have been happy because more often then not, u have the least contact with the person you like the most. get over the idea that she used u. she flirted with you and you should have flirted with her. it would have opened things up to move forward. but now, you have to get over it and just start talkin to her like it never happened. its probably hard for you, but it you still like her and she likes you, than theres nothing else to do except give it a shot.|`|7Fqj1lyHaa	I dont think she used you.  Maybe led you on a little.  Start to flirt back if you like her.  Show her that you are interested in her.  If she asks why you ignored her explain what you had thought.|`|U4jW7PHTaa	ask her to talk and see whats up
CRWJLp6raa	Well, you can't stop your true heart's feelings right.<br>  Does she make any indication to show that she likes you? I have friends like that they were friends for a long time since maybe 3rd grade and then he asked her out and they dated for a while but then she said she likes him as a brother than a guy sometimes it may apply to your situation she may like you more of a brother than an actual guy guy..|`|AA10634709	make a move. it might be very progressive!|`|EouR037haa	I think you should get your feelings straight first and make sure you like her before doing anything about it. Since you were friends first you don't want to ask her out then after it gets all awkward and whatever. <br>  It could turn out to be great but make sure it's worth it first. :D|`|WyVWbtddaa	you must be shure about you're feeling it could be true love and you musn't waiste the time <br>  if you really love her tell her before it's being too late and just to know if you ever thought of her this way she will feel it and things will never be the same

CUEWhG88aa	Long distance relationships rarely last the test of time. Either one of you has to give in so you can stay in one place or separate and let fate take it's coarse.<br>  <br>  It really depends on how mature BOTH of you are ?????<br>  <br>  You should do what my step daughter did. Her and her BF are going to the same college just so they can keep an eye on each other.... Yea... how dumb is that? They already don't trust one another and they think the best way is to be within eye shot. How S-T-U-P-I-D. <br>  <br>  If you both really love one another then you can separate for this time but be aware... separation is just what it implies. You will be separated. It's not easy to keep a good thing going when you are not together.|`|5Xqn7zEMaa	If it is meant to be, it will find a way. 19 months is a pretty long time and it seems like you guys are serious. So, try it out,.,,,,and see what happens.

Good luck....and remember to stay focused on school first and foremost.....love should be simple, non-complicated.....remember that and ease your mind......i have a hunch it will work out for you guys.......distance aint nothing but a number,....long distance can work if both people remain honest, trustworthy, and keep the lines of communication open at ALL TIMES./...Good luck girl!!|`|NaaMYEPNaa	I think it could work, but its not going to be a cake walk.

If he's wearing cologne tell him you like it (but only if you actually do lol) or compmliment him on his clothes and of course make more body contact, but don't be to upfront or he might think you "want it" right there and then.|`|ac1b836a7fbf6db3886fe496cc360fbbaa	give him some head. its not flirting but hell he'll enjoy it.|`|l0udgfx0aa	look at him intently, and look away a little less then what you would with him normally. compliment him. try making more physical contact, such as patting him on the back, high fiving him, and get more into hugging, and while you're hugging, perhaps compliment his smell, or jaket, stuff like this.<br>  <br>  don't be too forward though. build it up. he'll get scared if you start flirting out of nowhere. start at the basics.|`|nNaj8g8Faa	giggle alot... smile alot... put on lip glosss, hmm and twirl my hair lol<br>  oh and tease him a bit too <br>  =)
K4VE6wf5aa	try to work it out with mark and if it dosent work try to give kalyas bf clues that she is cheating on him after a couple of clues and he gets it then you can say i didnt tell him actully he guessed;-)hope it works
d9iIS14Paa	I thnk it seems like he likes u. but he is also scared of people knowing. he is how u find out:<br>  when u talk 2 hm move closer 2 hm. like next 2 his shoulder. <br>  if he moves back then he likes u as a frnd. <br>  if he moves even closer then he relli likes.<br>  trust me it wrks!|`|Qf8Pn7i1aa	ya|`|TBcGAWAxaa	This boy really likes you. I will say by the way he is acting in no time will he ask you out!<br>  <br>  Hope This Helps.......|`|kXzcRE3maa	well he may like you but than again you can never be to sure so just keep testing him and ask around..dont make the fisrt move if he dose like yuo than he will show it|`|ZOkOx4Azaa	No doubts, that he pay attention to you. You attract him...but may be he does not know how to behave with you. It` s not a love...but of course your sympoathies are mutual. So, try to take his attention and not to loose it! Good luck!|`|e9c36ca0f2730115ae65696edbc5fb42aa	hmmm maybe. You can't really be sure. He sure sounds like a blast to be around tho! Don't wanna lose that friendship! :D|`|ac5e9e9b9056ea5130ce5e1074c075b7aa	Yeah, he might like you but one time I thought this guy liked me because he came up behind me a couple of times and just started talking but I realized that he does that to a lot of people and it was just his character. <br>  <br>  Get to know this guy better and try to start up conversations when you can. See what you think then, good luck! :)|`|JZdYJiCMaa	I have a feeling that hes trying to annoy you or maybe he does like you. Go up to him and ask him why he does these things but dont show him that it bugs you. Maybe eventually he will stop what he is doing.
RzBjyzEzaa	Yes, he likes you.
xRYybUV5aa	Theres this book called The rules: time tested secrets for capturing mr. right. it's a great book! my friend brought it for me when i was having a hard time with a guy and i loved it so much i read it in one day.  she gave it to me and my other friend for christmas last year and it was awesome! i think she'll appreciate it.  Here's the link:
wCxjiPRZaa	set him up with another girl but still be his friend|`|owzFxSjeaa	Don't do anything.<br>  If he asks you out tell him you want to stay friends but if you don't do or say anything about him wanting to be more than friends he will get the message without getting hurt.  If his friends ask you how you feel about him be honest and say that he is a good friend.|`|dZslcbBSaa	Set him up with some one else<br>  If that doesn't work, I think that if you explain to him that you would never want to risk the friendship by going out with him. You'd rather have him as your best friend for a long time than to have him as your boyfriend for a very short time and risk the relationship later on. It would hurt you too much for it to end up like that.
owzFxSjeaa	He is hurting he still likes you and you broke up with him.<br>  Plue his pride is hurt and I would be willing to bet he does not have 2 girlfriends it was his way of saying see I don't need you.  He will get over it it will just take time.|`|YYBTXUVsaa	Some people tend to act like that because they are no longer going out with you.<br>  They try to get over it by being mean at times and taking out their anger on their ex's.<br>  I'd say, don't talk to him anymore, he's being an ashole.|`|uwoAgUqdaa	Hm, that is quite immature of him to do that.<br>  Just ask him straight out. "Why are you doing this to me?"
ab44a6e329f8a1704d55d56689f357a2aa	In Person,  be honest and dont make up excuses
xlcZUAIRaa	the only reason ur feeling like this is because shes the first person who gave u effection.i know how that feels and its really hard to get over but i dont think shes worth it if she was a ''ho'' and had a lot of guys then she obviously was playing a game with u and wasnt taking u seriously. get over it and u can find someone better.ur still young focus on ur education first then worry about other things like girls.|`|AA10134182	It often happens to young people like you and is called "infatuation".

I like the idea of a cool t-shirt and a cd of songs that both he and you enjoy and do some cool artwork with perm. markers on the face of it.|`|0GTNw6J9aa	get him a t shirt from his fave store or gift card|`|0fxSvA8zaa	You can get him some candy ,love notes...you know.|`|99c5RiIMaa	get him like a game or a love card mybe a teddy bear!|`|AA10230857	I would say get him something that guys like, like a video game( some are under $25), or get him some chocolate because guys aren't mushy like us.|`|TCCCTyaNaa	maybe buy him a cheap (but cute) shirt and make him a CD with a bunch of good songs?|`|VE3IxKqLaa	gi joe|`|acGCrEfkaa	uhhh dats hard ummm get him a card...not a teddy bear dats 4 a guy 2 give a gurll...not flowers of course idk give him a card say nice things|`|i6z2CBCJaa	Chocolate, candy, or any food will do the trick!|`|kSPW3oVyaa	Condoms<br>  <br>  ...aww...for sweet! You'll be his first!|`|xs30iaDyaa	What he likes <br>  Jock=Something Jockey<br>  Nerd= some thing not nerdy exception to the rule|`|zUIxNyVRaa	Chocalate maybe and a card.
c2280b7707b39f71d4174015a1ada7a0aa	he could be busy, but i would say mostly likely someone came back into the picture or is in the picture already. If a guy is interested you will know.
9JfjBz9maa	Wow that's a lot going on right now, a way to get over him is to just ignore him. If he got angry over a little prank then he isnt a real friend. A real friend would laugh about it, and if you bump into him then just dont say anything
7w48LK3Naa	Work out what type of party it will be: Sleepover, Pool Party, Theme or one at a different venue. <br>  Make sure your choice is suitable, for example, you won't be able to have a pool party without a pool! <br>  Decide who you want at your party, Co'Ed, All Girls or all boys or both. <br>  You will have to discuss with your parents how many you can have at your birthday, although it is hard, try never to leave someone out. <br>  Plan what you are going to need food wise. You don't want 10+ hungry 13 year olds turning up to a party with no food. Chips and mixed lollies are a great start. Of course you'll need a cake, but that is your personal choice. <br>  Plan decorations. If you are having a theme party this is essential. <br>  If the party is at your house, decide where is going to be off limits, as your parents wont want umpteen children trekking through the room. <br>  Plan some entertainment. Work out party games and supplies well before. If you are having a sleepover, rent some movies.<br>  <br>  Good luck and Happy 13th Birthday. Hope you have fun!|`|AA10763203	Tell your friends your having a party for the less fortunate in your town. Ask everyone to bring 5 food items for your birthday. Enjoy giving the food to your local foodbank and by the way happy birthday.
kkBmLB2Qaa	dang that sux...actually really shitty...  she should of atleast told you why.  well you cant do anything about it so just move on....its gona be hard but dang if she wants to be like that then why even bother with someone who doesnt care about your feeling and how shes making you feel!!!<br>   Happy Valentines Day|`|2cCxGgLvaa	Why dont ya get a hold of some of her friends and ask them?<br>  Maybe she met another guy and didnt have the words 2 tell u that so she just said what she said...
GajB12mWaa	I think she is a little too old for you. Also the fact that she's been divorced once by the age of 20 isn't exactly promising, if you know what i mean.  Do you really think she'd go out with some kid in school if she's been MARRIED. Especially if it's her little brothers friend. I think you should move on. Also the fact she's been looking at you doesn't have to mean she's interested.|`|vrKBcfO0aa	thanx for the 2 points|`|KmUdkaTxaa	Hey com'on!

Tell her to go tell the police even though it won't really help since she doesn't know who did it|`|CP96dYj4aa	haha i went through maybe ur boyfriend had sex with her<br>  <br>  get her tested and see the DNA that was in her and try to match it with her boyfriend or yours|`|CPQ8f8fWaa	did you see something, like where was the boyfriend , was he near your bf well your story is confusing. some advice for all girls, DONT GET DRUNK WITH PEOPLE THAT YOU DONT TRUSTEVEN IF IT S YOUR BF OR BOYFRIEND, if you dont trusst the person stay sober. because this is how most rape happend. girls ussually got raped by a close friend or family members or friends not by stranger. so STAY SOBER.<br>  <br>  i witness some inapropriate touching all the time, my friend bring some friends over to her house for some drinks, and when they got drunk, one of her guy friend friend is touching them, like running after them to tickle them, and at the same time he is touching their *** and chest. while they lay on the floor.|`|KJGsH7n5aa	Your friend was in another room... and her bf was in the couch?<br>  How did he rape her than??<br>  <br>  Maybe someone else slept w her?|`|fdd473aac771e312e31e0ebe74bdc8f7aa	the first thing i would do is go buy a test to make sure then i would talk to her  about it and make sure she learned her lesson now about drinking so it doesnt happen again|`|n8jtKQ6Paa	Oh no, that is so bad.<br>  <br>  She doesn't remember anything at all? You need to talk to a older person about this and get some help.<br>  <br>  Bring her to the clinic, in case she caught any std or if she got pregnant. Hope she is okay!|`|t3H4yklUaa	She knows for sure that she didn't sleep with her boyfriend? And she know for sure that she had sex? Then yes. She was raped. It has been upheld in court numerous times that people under the influence of drugs and/or alcohol can not be consenting to sex. <br>  <br>  I assume that she doesn't know who she had sex with, and that she's showered since then, so there is no more physical evidence, unless there were semen stains on her clothes. <br>  <br>  If the clothes have been washed, then there is no evidence at all.<br>  <br>  Tell her to go to Planned Parenthood to seek a pregnancy test, and counseling. They provide both. If she turns up pregnant, then her rapist's dna will be kind of available with the unborn child. Again, Counseling.
YcSoNhdLaa	I'd say he's interested in you, the looking alone is a good give away, i know i've never looked twice at a girl i wasn't interested in|`|a8qvLezVaa	No they don't but I wouldn't incourage him if he's seeing someone else! And it doesn't matter whether his girlfriend is pretty or not. Put yourself in the other girls shoes......think 2x before you act on impulse!|`|GNqQnAy9aa	Or when they hope to become a son-in law first and then a husband|`|940hjyZ5aa	Yes, most guys act differently around girls they like. And you definitely have a chance. Go for it.|`|ZxDSqNW3aa	Yes- talk to him. Be brave, and flirty at the same time. Guys like the kind of guts it takes to ask them how they feel. Good Luck!|`|a1623b72d6484cc02a3b5d4266745d4daa	DO IT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!|`|AA12197871	I would say yes, but he better leave his girlfriend<br>  first.|`|B8aZ5Qtwaa	Let me put it to you this way: all men are somewhat sleezy. They meet people they like and they go after them slowly. <br>  Especially if they are hugging you like that. <br>  <br>  Men want ONE thing in this world: sex.  <br>  They want it more than anything else and they will do and say anything to get sex. <br>  So if he's hugging you like that and making eye contact he is interested. But WATCH OUT FOR THE GIRLFRIEND|`|KxCryGR0aa	its all you, i say do it|`|YAaBAOtPaa	you can't unpry a relationship. That is cruel and he will see you as cruel. But you can make him decide on his own. Show off in front of him and give him hints. Small one's though.

He is afraid that your ex bf might take you back in his life; or that you'll betray him. So do anything you can to tell him you are standing by him no matter what other good things might come your way. And if doen'st take notice of any of your effort to safe the relationship, just dumpp him. Why? Because he doesn't seem to know nothing about forgiveness and understand people.

Nudity and sex is not the problem with today's society.. An addiction is a medical issue of an individual.. You claim watching the natural act of sex causes all kinds of evil thoughts in our minds well hell if that's the case the world would be rampant with violence and killing just tune into one of your local tv stations.. There is no problem with taking a gun and shooting a man but just make sure he has his clothes on.. Watching sex as well as watching violence the more you view the more dormant you become to it..

If you find this happens to you then you need help. Pornography , however is different, its purpose is to stimulate and create arousal..Destroying social life? Only if you become addicted to it, but you can become addicted to anything (gambling,drugs) that will destroy your social life.<br>  I think your views are a little skewed and extreme.|`|VEZjyvywaa	Well, after a while pornography becomes some sort of replacement for sex. You two should be atracted to each other enough to fully enjoy it. You should lay off its obviously taking away from your intimate experience. Maybe stop having sex for a while until it builds up and then maybe it will give for a more pleasurable experience.Personally, I dont need that to have great sex! It takes away from it. Good luck.|`|jPCz0Uckaa	It's people's choice whether they watch it or not, and if they stay addicted to it, they will expect that kind of sex from a partner.

It gives people a bent view of sexuality and intimacy. I think it gives men that see it in a clouded view of what women want during sex. For women it can give them the idea that these sick acts are what sex is about. <br>  <br>  If I were king, porn would be gone.|`|rDhrZLFRaa	so after reading his question, i went to look at some of the answers he has posted.

Leave the address and the name of the place where you're staying at. Also put down an estimate time when you'll be back home. Don't pick up your phone if he calls while your out. <br>  If you decide to dye your hair again, maybe ask him if he likes the idea of it before you do. <br>  Deciding your job should be your choice because obviously, it's you working there not him. Just breathe...calm down.<br>  If you try acting like a calm adult maybe he will too. <br>  Don't put his statements into too much consideration. You're almost 20, time to show him that you are.

f4653542288455cd58da95dd853b1fc7aa	Well, I know i'm a guy, but it's always good to have someone of the opposite sex to answer some questions. I don't think you should have cheated on him, because word gets around and you've got to think of you're repetition. He chooses to ruin his and plobably won't have a very successful relationship. You don't need to take it lightly though, give him a good kick in the balls and tell him to get the hell out. There's no need to be nice anymore, he went behind your back. But don't ruin your rep because of someone else. I hope this helps, good luck.|`|F12s04X4aa	No, I wouldn't because then I'd just feel like I'm on the same level as him.  I'd dump him and that would make him either realize what a moron he was, or he'd just cheat on the next girl.  He might just cheat on you again and if that happens you guys just sound like you'll be in a bad cycle of things.  I hope it works out for you though.|`|45f1360efad547282be68b1242ba3452aa	Are you still with him? What next? If he cheats on you again then what? Value yourself.

e3qutY63aa	I think women know what men are capable of if they do push them So they try to put on this big tough act to try and show you that if you were to hit them they're going to be strong enough emotionally and physically to handle it.

I am not sure why they do it..Im not that type of girl lol.  Some women want you to hit them so you will get in trouble. You dont have to hit her. giver up to 3 warnings..and then "push" her *** out the way.|`|U5dVHOGAaa	My man women do this for one of two reasons:<br>  <br>  1. They want you to get in trouble or<br>  2. They want you to hit them because it shows that you have compassion for them. YES there are some women like this, they feel that the only way a man can truly show that he loves her is by physical abuse. It lets them know that he must really love me to actually raise a hand to me and get this mad at me. Its a strange but very true reality for some women. Its really a shame. I have known women that constantly get in abusive relationship's, they will finally find a nice guy who is about something and kick him to the curb for another abusive male. Its very sad but true!!!
Fm3jxhdraa	It all depends on what season is the wedding, but if you are not sure you can always wear a black dress with cute accesories.|`|HxeaMhIvaa	I wouldn't just opt for a black dress as the easy way out...some brides don't want anyone wearing black at their wedding.  Also, don't wear white, that's the bride's color.  Since it is your sister's wedding, find out what her colors are and choose something that compliments those colors.  For instance, if her colors are brown and teal, choose a nice lilac color.  Or if her colors are pink and orange, go with a subtle yellow or green.  This way if you get thrown into pictures (which, as family, you probably will) you won't look out of place, but you won't "match" the wedding party either.  <br>  <br>  As for style, choose it based on different factors like the formality of the wedding (for a formal wedding you should wear a long dress, but a semi-formal outdoor wedding would allow for something shorter).  Just don't wear anything shorter than about 3" above the knee or something too low-cut.  Its a wedding, not a club!|`|2c3bc1e2a237e1e0184fd45914d20451aa	You could use several strategies to help u make a decision. One is the time of year of the event. For a fall or winter wedding u want dark colors that will attract heat and for a spring or summer wedding u want light colors so that heat won't be as easily held against ur skin. <br>  <br>  You also might try getting a dress in one of the colors that she has chosen as her colors for her wedding. That way you would blend in easily.<br>  <br>  And you can never go wrong with choosing a dress in your favorite color. <br>  <br>  I would advise that you stay away from white. White is usually the brides color and you don't want to upstage your sister.|`|mPKDmMJoaa	What is the seasons the wedding is being held?<br>  <br>  What are her colours?|`|BLArxeQGaa	I have a wedding to go to in a few weeks and I've made sure to stay away from white and the color of her bridesmaids dresses. You don't want to take away from the bride or her party.

He is either playing games with you or he doesn't want to get too close to you. Either way you should move on.|`|cxu3ez5Kaa	umm you should ask him watz up? I guess he is into you and another girl but thats just my thought hope you the best of luck

hqSWUc8uaa	I am doing what is called "spoonful of kisses"<br>  <br>  You take some tulle (which I got from <a href="http://www.tullesource.com/" rel="nofollow">http://www.tullesource.com/</a> cuz they had a wide variety of colors, my colors are apricot and sage, they didn't have apricot but they had a peach that was very close so I got that) I would say probably a 6"x6" square, a plastic spoon (I got white ones cuz the colored ones were more expensive) and about 5 or 6 Hershey kisses and tie the spoon/kisses together in the tulle with a ribbon (also in my colors, got that at Michael's) and a tag that says "a spoonful of kisses from the Mr. & Mrs" and with our names and wedding date under that. I saw this on a website and they wanted like $3 or so for one favor, and I'm like, uhh, nooo, I'm not spending $300-400 on favors when i can make them much cheaper myself. Kisses are about $8 a bag at Walmart for the ones that have about 250 in them... and I'm making 150 of them, so if I use 5 kisses per favor, I'd need 3 bags, and if I use 6 kisses I'd need 4 bags. So that's $24-32 for kisses, I spent $18 on tulle, $2 on ribbon and $2 on spoons and I think $5-6 on tags.<br>  So $60 for 150 favors isn't bad for doing them myself :)<br>  <br>  I'm also having bubble bottles... I got them at Dollar Tree for $1 for a dozen (!) So that was $12 for 12 dozen, and I'm actually tying colored ribbon around the neck of the bottles and getting stickers from this seller off ebay <a href="http://stores.ebay.com/Beautiful-Favors-Fast_W0QQssPageNameZstrkQ3amefsQ3amesstQQtZkm" rel="nofollow">http://stores.ebay.com/Beautiful-Favors-...</a> and she's got some cute bubble labels for very cheap! It's gonna be like $10 for 150 of them so that's not bad...<br>  <br>  <br>  So there ya go... 2 different favors and both for less than $100 altogether... <br>  <br>  If you don't wanna make something yourself, check out <a href="http://www.orientaltrading.com/" rel="nofollow">http://www.orientaltrading.com/</a> for their favors... and sign up to get their wedding catalog in the mail, AWESOME ideas in there for not real expensive, either...<br>  <br>  Hope this helps! :)|`|pagKJkCpaa	well i work at a resturant so i was going to buy a large supply of new small salt shakers and fill them with m&m of the wedding colors, and put the label on them that read"mr&mrs*******  the date they married and something cute like spices for a hot marriage!" it sounds silly but i was running out of ideas too.

Then I went to Michaels and they had these little stickers that are double hearts with a transparent background. We are placing those on the candles for the tables and they will be the wedding favors as well. <br>  <br>  PS we are also paying everything out of pocket and going as inexpensive as possible.|`|b328a9d35b4d38f11fb5ea37fe0b727aaa	It took us forever to decide on favors. Here are some ideas I liked:<br>  <br>  Candy bar with candy in our wedding colors<br>  Coasters with different stuff on them based on our home states (letter press)<br>  Lucky bamboo<br>  Chocolate playing cards (our wedding is in Las Vegas)<br>  Personalized playing cards<br>  Personalized Jones' sodas with a picture of us on it<br>  Gum ball slot machines<br>  <br>  We finally ended up deciding on doing butter cookies in the shapes of our two homes states with frosting.

nQ5PuS3qaa	debes saber que no todo gay es galleta, o mejor dicho afeminado, hay uno que no se les nota ni a palo, y si le preguntas directamente como muchos te han dicho que lo hagas, muy seguramente se va a sentir bombardeado y te va a decir que no eso es obvio, lo mejor es que actues de manera sigilosa e inconciente, por ejemplo si se conecta mucho al messenger crea un correo falso y hasta pasar por otra persona, obvio un hombre gay interesado en la persona a investigar, si es gay ya estara acostumbrado a eso y caera, si no lo es simplemente va a permancer tranquilo o responder con agresividad, eso si nada de llamadas, puede reconocer tu voz, si vas a usar el celular lo mejor es que sean mensajes de texto...espero q te sirva, a mi me ha funcionado las mil maravillas tengo investigados a todos los de mi grado, si lo haces constantemente puedes darte cuenta de la gran cantidad de personas que no son lo q parecen, saludos|`|1lxMO10Xaa	Mmmm es muy dificil saber si tu no eres gay pero si eres gay nadamas fijate en su mirada o la mas sencilla de todas su comportamiento si hablas asi de ay mana o cosas aso seguro es gay pero si no se le nota pues en la mirada <br>  Saludos|`|5oYtHq2Baa	Preguntaselo..... no hay nada más directo!!!<br>  <br>  :o)|`|6AdwJUXYaa	si te mira con cara de sed,  y si te busca mucho la mirada, y todo el tiempo esta  con vos y para todos lados con tigo.|`|7O7xEC7maa	Preguntale|`|B0arFF4Raa	eso se conoce cuando habla su forma de ser con los hombres como los mira y sus actos sus preferencias y hasta como se vista en los colores como rosados de mujeres no le gustan los trabajos pesados si no como trabajar en floristeria y cosas suaves y si no tiene novia bueno y nisiguiera se interesa en una bueno ya te podras inmaginar que es gay suerte???|`|aOEw2xHzaa	?y para que? ?para ligarselo?...ese tema es tabú en medio planeta, si  se pone de muy plumifero le darán tus buenos  golpetazos.

Llegar a los treinta a?os y no tener panza:........<br>  Seguro que sos gay. Nada más que decir.<br>  <br>  2. Comer chupetines:<br>  Mariconada; las únicas cosas que un hombre de verdad puede chupar son algunas partes femeninas, una cerveza. ?Un buen whisky!.<br>  <br>  3. Tener un gato:<br>  Trolíííííísimo, sólo un homosexual consumado tendría un gato. Un gato es como un perro pero en versión maricón, se lava con su propia lengua, come pescado y nunca se emborracha. Es decir que el hombre que vive sólo con un gato en su casa, vive en una profunda relación gay. Sólo fíjense: a un perro se lo llama con dignidad masculina, "Perro de mierda, venga para acá!!"; "échese, perro puto". Pero a un gato,... Bsss-bsss-bsss, kiti-kiti-kiti, michi-michi-michi,....tan lindo mi gatito.....??putazo de mierda...!!<br>  <br>  4 No ir de caza o de pesca porque no hay ba?o:<br>  Un verdadero hombre caga donde sea.<br>  <br>  5. Llegar a casa temprano y lo primero que hacés es revisar el buzón:<br>  ?Marica!, un hombre llega a casa después de ocho horas de trabajo, medio al palo y dispuesto a hacerle el amor a su mujer. Pero llegar y revisar el buzón!. Además, las llaves de los buzones están hechas para dedos femeninos.<br>  <br>  6. Pedir café descafeinado, café con leche descremada o cosa similares:<br>  Maricón de mierda, café es café, debe ser fuerte...???es masculino!!! Las únicas cosas que se le pueden a?adir al café son co?ac y whisky, todo lo demás son cosa de nenas.<br>  <br>  7. Saber el nombre de más de cuatro tortas:<br>  Un hombre sólo conoce lo suficiente para desayunar en el bar. Dónde se ha visto que un verdadero hombre entre en un bar y diga "disculpe, me podría poner dos porciones de lemon pie y una de brownies" ...?puuuuuuuto!, con 20 equipos en primera división y 25 jugadores en cada uno... a quién le queda sitio en la memoria para recordar los nombres de las tortas.<br>  <br>  8. Alimentar al perro con comida para perros:<br>  Maricón!!! la comida de perros la ha inventado las multinacionales para amariconar a los perritos. Un perro come lo que se cae al suelo o lo que desentierra. Después de comer esas mierdas enlatadas se vuelven afeminados, ya no toman agua del chorro, se ponen pajeros, no tocan nada podrido y dejan de perseguir al gato.<br>  <br>  9. Conducir con las dos manos en el volante:<br>  Si los "cowboys" consiguen enlazar a los toros con una sola mano... ?por qué un hombre precisa de dos manos para agarrar el volante?, putito. Las dos manos al volante sólo en dos momentos: pasar a otro o tocar bocina, el resto la mano derecha debe estar libre para poder sintonizar la radio, hablar por teléfono, fumar, morfarse un sandwich, agarrar la cerveza,<br>  rascarte los huevos y sobre todo para meterle mano a la copiloto.<br>  <br>  10. Pasear los perros con cadenas:<br>  Trolaso. Los perros han nacido para andar sueltos, pasear al perro es una actividad de riesgo. Nunca sabes hacia donde va, si va volver a casa, si le va morder la pierna a alguien, o si tirará al suelo a una vieja. Las cadenas son para maricas, no hay discusión.<br>  <br>  11. Mirar la fecha de vencimiento de los alimentos en el Súper es de nenas:<br>  Un verdadero hombre no mira esas cosas porque es inmune a los alimentos vencidos. Qué mal le pueden hacer, unas salchichas viejas, o un pollo de Mazzorín arruinado.!!!..<br>  <br>  12. Tocar las verduras para ver su estado antes de comprarlas:<br>  No hay duda, es de gay. Un verdadero hombre no le importa el estado de las verduras, al contrario, pueden ayudar a producir gases, con los cuales se divierte luego frente a sus amigos, para ver quien los lanza más sonoros y fétidos.<br>  <br>  13. "Le encanta bailar: ?????<br>  !!Maricón!! los hombres sólo bailan por necesidad, para atracarse una mina, pero de ahí a que les encante...<br>  <br>  14. Conocer los nombres de actores y actrices de moda y en que películas o novelas actuaron:<br>  Es de trolo trolo, un hombre de verdad sólo se acuerda que a ese tipo lo vió en otra película cortando cabezas con una espada en cada mano.<br>  <br>  15. Se fija que bien o que mal se viste una mina y puede recordar de que color era su vestido<br>  !!Troooooolooooo!!! un hombre sólo recuerda que buen culo o tetas tenía.<br>  <br>  16. Recibe y reenvía mail que hablan de la amistad, el amor, la ternura y otras porquerías que para colmo estan ilustrados con fotos de ni?os, flores, angelitos o perros trolos, y al final te amenazan que si no lo haces te va a pasar algo terrible:|`|U7AJkE6gaa	pinchalo con una pesta?a si salta es gay|`|Xnj9ppqFaa	Como se comporta, o si parece ridículo en todos los aspectos, hasta al caminar y hablar.

d8e728311057920726dbfbc7353ca59faa	Tell her straight up that you don't like her like that and say that you just want to be friends. Say even if it isnt true. But say that you trust her with your life and you want someone who will always have your back. Just keep telling her that you want to be good friends.|`|xImYfDzraa	i agree with the first guys answer , is she ugly come on give her a chance .|`|jpIdtWB0aa	Whatever you do, do not be inconsiderate. Do not laugh. Do not be mean. All you can do it be sincere with her, say you don't like her like that, that you aren't looking for a relationship or whatever, but you really care about her as a friend and enjoy hanging out with her. She'd be disappointed but anyone loves to hear someone say something sincere like that. You could actually try to prevent a situation by setting her up with someone else? Just an idea. All you can do is be honest though, if she reacts badly, you don't want to be around her anyway. Good Luck mate!|`|bfZVSyR3aa	He doesn't have to be gay and she doesn't have to be ugly or fat for their to be romantic chemistry between them!<br>  Maybe he's ugly and fat!<br>  Anyway mate just be open and honest with her. If she really is a friend she will understand and won't be offended. If the relationship gets "ruined" simply by you being honest with your feelings then it really was built on a lie and not worth it.|`|8GUdhZSgaa	look ur a jerk if u dont go out with her she is very sweat i think so just give her a chance u jerk|`|ifWTcXVcaa	Whats the matter, are you gay or something? is she fat?|`|AEuQB42Naa	I've been in that girl's position, so I know what it feels like. No matter what you do or say, she will, inevitably, be upset. Whether she shows it or not just depends on her personality. You have to accept that she will be hurt, and now it's up to you to try and minimize that hurt. <br>  <br>  Take her seriously. Do not laugh, say, "You're kidding, right?", or if she directly says that she likes you, say, "Oh.", and change the subject. That's your cue to have a real conversation with her about this. You need to explain to her, directly but empathetically, that you want to be friends, and nothing more than that. You care for her, and see her as someone very important in your life, but not a lover. When you tell it to her straight, she won't be left wondering, and will hopefully be able to get over you faster.|`|HXrvIhzxaa	I think the first thing is not to jump to conclusions.  Yes, it does sound a lot like she is making a move on you, but make sure first so you don't embarrass yourself!  Second, if she does come out and tell you the way she feels or make a move, you have to be upfront with her about how you feel without being mean about it.  Let her know how much you like her friendship and what a great girl you think she is, but you don't see her that way.  I think this is the best way to handle it and she may be really upset at first, but if she is as cool as you think, she will eventually appreciate the honesty.  Also, under no circumstances, EVER discuss a girl you may like with her.  That would be very mean and insensitive and probably really hurt her feelings.  Honestly, as a girl, I would appreciate the honesty and respect you for being upfront with me and still being a friend!  Good luck!  You seem like a nice guy who really does care about this girl and her feelings.

Make the most of the guys looking at you whilst you're young and fabulous!<br>  <br>  :) :) :)|`|ltoI3QY2aa	There is noting wrong with flirting; however in my opinion the way you are going about it is not the best way. You need to be careful not to send the wrong idea. These guys are older and you may get into more than you are looking for, especially if you do not know these guys. Please be careful.|`|45f1360efad547282be68b1242ba3452aa	You guys must have self esteem issues. There are better ways of getting the right kind of attention. But far be it from me to stop you. As a guy, I would be on that street watching. I'm sure they all love it. I don't know if I'd call it wrong. So do you have big breasts?
wovoZ5Z0aa	Its a bit of an age difference, but not too bad.  If they're both committed, there is no reason that it can't work.  If they've made it for 16 months, there is a lot of potential there.  The big question is if they have a common vision for the future.  If they want to make it work, they can.|`|45f1360efad547282be68b1242ba3452aa	He is too old for her. What could they have in common? I think that he can't handle a woman his own age that is why he is with her. He can mold her. She needs to find some one much closer to her age.
jedXCVtMaa	She is flirting with someone she trusts. <br>  Though she may not want to admit that.|`|sVQ0IB0Gaa	pretty much if you were gross we wouldn't touch you.|`|pQz6k4r2aa	she's a flirt but also a little aggressive, hence the HARD slap, haha. Seriously.|`|52383a5b2697c2e9ecf62a6ab9fd4c1faa	She's flirting. A lot of the time the girl doesn't realize that she does pack a pretty hard punch. Sorry if we leave you with bruises!|`|d5b3cbd61f1b8706cb2c84b0c56e4898aa	it might just be playing not flirting|`|qYjvuu3Zaa	Well kinda..I love slapping arms when he works out..lol|`|iR1WzT04aa	depends on the girl....hope she never slaps in the face lol|`|24c92661915a4582662b691cb05dc0baaa	Sorry chum, could go either way, seeing you said it was a hard slap. <br>  <br>  A light slap is definitely flirting, especially if her hand stays on you just a teeny bit longer than it has too. A hard slap on the arm could be overzealous flirting, but could also mean she really wanted to slug you in the face but was trying really hard to resist.|`|GW9cETg5aa	Well, if she slapped your hard it is most likely not flirting and she was mad at something you said.<br>  If its more of a light slap, its definately flirting. <br>  Its her way of getting closer to you and having an excuse to do so.<br>  If she's laughing while she's slapping you, its a definate signs he's flirting.|`|wTJDMI2vaa	so she smiles when she does it? And maybe giggles? And maybe looks you in the eye even for a second? Then yes, it's not that hard<br>  <br>  If it was just a tap then yes, if it was hard and smiles but sound kind of angry then no she's just mad at you and tries to tell you with out offense jeez|`|23b127352bec969c4abbafa63dd0917eaa	Yeah.. If she is smiling then it's flirting.<br>  Maybe she thinks you'd like pain and wanted to see your reaction. XD<br>  <br>  OR.. She may just see you as a very good friend and hits you to mess around or in a jokey way.<br>  <br>  Could mean either? Look for more clues!! :P|`|dtaMx6e6aa	When a girl slaps you on the arm or pushes you away playfully they usually are flirting and like to see you come back.|`|WGBAm1jYaa	thats our main way of flirting-touching/light hitting. the girl might just not be the best at it if it hurt ; ) but guys seem to love it when we touch them on the arm and such when laughing!|`|45f1360efad547282be68b1242ba3452aa	She is making physical contact. I  think that means that she finds you attractive.|`|OQfj7l9yaa	well. it depends on what you said. if it was offensive like mean she prolly meant to hit you. if you were jokingly doing it she prolly was flirting. if u can't tell by that if she was smiling wen she hit you she prolly was being flirty if she looked pissed i'm guessin she wasn't..|`|C7b1zmUWaa	Well i would say most likely yes she is flirting. Unless you did somthing wrong that was bad, but in that case you would know, if she is smiling when she does it then absolutley for sure its a flirt, go with your gut it will tell you,|`|hxrmXipkaa	Girls slap on the arm when they're offended, but not angry. It's flirting sometimes, but it's not a very good kind of flirting. It definitely doesn't mean a girl likes you unless it comes with a lot of other signs.|`|AA10587214	that all depends. if its hard it could mean she didn't like what you said or it could be flirting. cuz i have a friend who punches guys hard and she is a MAJOR flirt. specially toward one guy. but if its not hard and she is smiling yea i prolly is flirting|`|5mAixjyeaa	It depends on how often she does it. It also depends on if she does other things, like always trying to  have some kind of contact with you, like always trying to be around you or always laughs when she's around you.|`|TSX6kTfraa	Yes, sometimes. But I do that to guys I'm not intending on flirting with so i wouldn't take it as a hint or a flirtatious action necessarily. Look for something more clear.|`|JoHNCUq3aa	its a definite sign of flirting if she's being playful. you'll know if she's being playful or not by the look on her face. some girls don't know their own strength so even if she slaps you hard but is playful about it,, it could still be flirting|`|pNfzlctkaa	yep. we cant help it, we will do that clear into middle age. we usually trying to be cute or get a little attention, but sometimes it is just an excuse to touch the guys arm. or just touch him period.|`|5RWatSmyaa	kinda<br>  depends why she did it<br>  <a href="http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;_ylt=ApBPdJqEbIKhtjQOdT.0PBvsy6IX;_ylv=3?qid=20080706213604AArwQVD">http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;...</a>|`|3toqoc0waa	yeah shes flirting.

Maybe he doesn't want to think about his girlfriend as being too sexual, as some guys do that which is stupid, but the thing is that doesn't mean THEY don't like it anymore, just means they will go seek for it with girls that aren't their girlfriends because their girlfriends should enjoy sex too much.|`|31ac7af70f781384d9825a87cc62d0f2aa	well this is really something that u need to speak to him about..if he usually had a high sex drive and now all of a sudden its low there is something wrong there..<br>  <br>  I'd hate to assume that he is getting it else where now..but its a definite possibility..<br>  <br>  but for the sake of ur relationship lets first presume that he got tired of the fact that the relationship was souly based on sex and nothing else..its true that if you stop having sex after having it often it forces couples to bond emotionally ..and makes the want for sex more LOL<br>  <br>  so speak to him..then if u still unsure...monitor his movements (i personally hate doing that ) but sometimes u just have to|`|551d6f3460d1fe605ec4b3484bf76ff7aa	If you guys are that comfortable with your relationship, flat out ask him why he hasn't been wanting sex. That's the only true way to find out, and if he's as great as you say he is he'll be truthful, if he's bored with it maybe find stuff to spice it up, with like sexy lingerie or different position, but you should ask. Honesty and talking is very important in relationships. If you are afraid to ask him then you shouldn't be having sex.|`|7Kcj9HJJaa	Obviously, he doesn't enjoy the sexual part of your relationship, if sex is important to you, and it sounds like it is, move on.   He likes you and doesn't want to hurt you.<br>  <br>  You need more than a good buddy.|`|2ner6vmKaa	If you guys been together for awhile its probabaly because you guys are in that "comfort zone" and knows its not all about sex anymore.

Bottom line no sex who cares the reason, say good bye I'm telling you. Best of luck keep me posted on what you decide and the out come best of luck again...<br>  <br>  Guy|`|dtaMx6e6aa	Honestly you sound like me like a year ago. This is a scary situation and things may not end up for the best. Sex is a strong and physical and should be mutual in the relationship. Him showing less attention to your sex life and KNOWING that it's affecting you means that he's loosing care for you and the relationship in general. Maybe you should suggest a break from the relationship to think things over. Sorry about this...and good luck.|`|8j5LRUwNaa	babe, Hes either lost interest in you, Or hes got so used to you that whatever he does it wont bother you. How does he know it bothers you? Do you ever talk to him about it? but be careful when you talk to him about it, Because you could expect him to snap a bit, and then he'll start telling you how he really feels when he gets angry.|`|45f1360efad547282be68b1242ba3452aa	I think Nikki is right. Maybe he has found some one else. How is your nonsexual relationship? Do you fight a lot. Does he enjoy spending time with you?|`|wHrOKQrXaa	he might be stressed out the older guys get the more they get stressed. and they don't function so well|`|veHTVKbiaa	i guess you might have to make the first move|`|IIav8IKuaa	Is he doing drugs? This tends to lower people's libido a lot. I know it is something you probably wouldn't want to think about, but that's what it kind of sounds like to me. I've heard Dr. Phil say that a good sex life effects 5% of the relationship, and a bad sex life effects 90%. I think this is so true! When you have a good sex life, you don't even think about it, but when it's bad, it effects everything! I was in this same situation, and it hurt my feeling's so bad, I just didn't understand why he didn't want me and it caused so much tension between us. We sat down and had a long talk which helped relieve the tension. If he's not into sex, would he be interested in just pleasing you? <br>  <br>  Good luck sweetie!

It's not that I'm not in love with him, I am. We're actually planing an engagement party! But it started to feel like a routine. He'd start off on top, we'd flip, I'd ride him backwards, then we'd end it doggy-style. We started watching porn together and making bets that the other person couldn't pull of the positions in the episode or whatever. If you guys don't want to watch porn together, you can watch it by yourself and take notes. Then surprise him by going down on him, get him turned on, and try new positions.

ZOXoPgJbaa	Ask him when hes going to take you out again, and let him know that you've missed him or something along those lines.Maybe when you guys go out he will let you know how he feels  about you. By asking when you guys are gonna hang out again, you will let him know that you are interested in him, and when you guys do go out,he will let you know  know how he feels  because he will be more confident that your response will be a positive one. l. If he really likes you, and he isnt sure if you like him back, the last thing he wants to do is get rejected by you! Besides getting rejected, he pretty much changes the dynamic of the relationship you guys have going now. Because there is so much on the line he might be hesitant to let you know how he feels.  This is exactly how me and my gf got together. Ive never had a problem asking out girls, but since I had such a huge crush on my girlfriend, I was extremely cautious! Her kinda meeting me halfway really helped it out and reduced the stress by alot! Good luck with whatever you do.|`|4ba73b3f683ed117a4c6bd55a0a06134aa	ask him if he likes you because then he is required to answer|`|45f1360efad547282be68b1242ba3452aa	Just ask him.|`|2d41a17d1eee3b822a70e62b7874dcf0aa	just ask him.|`|PzR0cUFOaa	tell him u think hes cute!|`|4euPzF2Xaa	say u will give him some booty.|`|RNAGmAAGaa	Talk more about each other.<br>  Try to make sure that he likes you back and once you guys get in to the real talks let him know you like him..<br>  Don't be in depth with it just say that he's been on your mind lately and see his reaction and see what he says!<br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|Jo4RzbFBaa	Number one your dealing online.

Im waiting till im married and I do not feel like giving my boyfriend any sign that we are going to have sex but sometimes it can get hard. She must be trying to do the same thing becuase the moment she gives in to you she most likely will either make you think your going to have sex(and get blue ball) or you will have sex and ruin your relationship. You are making it hard on her to wait by getting mad at her.

Engaged means that someone has promised to marry another. But, if during the engagement either of the two have second thoughts, then it is broken.  Bottom line:  SPEAK UP!  If she is in love with you, she'll break off the engagement! If the feeling is not mutual, then at least you spoke up.  You can't break this engagement, only she can.  Once married, there usually is no turning back.|`|LZ17CdA8aa	i think that it is a little to late to try.

She is committed to marriage to someone else.<br>  <br>  Regards,<br>  Dan|`|ORG5UjGyaa	An engagement is solemn, you have to give up this dream, and let her go. The difference between 'involved' and 'committed', is like a breakfast meal. If you're having ham, and eggs: the chicken is involved, but the pig is committed. See what I mean?|`|yRzmnHoHaa	They are not availible to you man! They are ready to be married for pete's sake, it would be no different if they where just in a relationship.

If she likes you it's better to find out now.|`|fhChZfnyaa	Alright Mr. Procrastinator,<br>  <br>  Ask yourself what you hope to accomplish by possibly breaking these people up.<br>  Are YOU trying to marry one of them? 'Right now?<br>  Or, are you afraind of missing out on figuring out what might have been?<br>  <br>  Because, you took time that the person you're interested in, obviously wasn't willing to give you, to figure out what you wanted -a smart move for you. But it appears you are on different schedules, wavelengths, or of different priorities.<br>  <br>  You can reveal your affections. I am always an advocate of the truth. But realize that at this late juncture, you may end up being a last hurrah before the big day, and nothing more, or, an excuse for that person not to get married for other reasons they don't want to reveal. -For the latter, later, the two of you will probably end up hating and blaming each other for the greater happiness you may have kept each other from.<br>  <br>  I would probably reveal my feelings, only in my expression of wishing them both well. <br>  Something to the tune of:<br>  'I realized a long time ago that I cared about you, more than I ever had the confidence to tell you. And, I really hope he takes good care of you. You deserve it.' <br>  Then, move on.<br>  <br>  Honey, it's a sad fact of life that time waits for no one. And even though we may not feel up to it, or may feel completely afraid of it, if we do not push ourselves to confront our life opportunities, we often miss out on them. for good.<br>  <br>  Don't lament what you missed.<br>  Always remeber that what might have been and what would have been can never be reconciled. <br>  And the sunshine and rainbows you may imagine yourself to have foregone, on the other side of the alter, may have been a Hell beyond your worst imaginings.<br>  <br>  Wish them well.<br>  And, let it go.<br>  <br>  What's meant to happen, for you, will.<br>  <br>  Good luck.
45f1360efad547282be68b1242ba3452aa	Talk to him.
2nw9thaCaa	less effort? not really, it doesn't matter if she is in a serious relationship. as long as you know it by yourself that you only want friendship relationship with her, nothing more. you should know your limits though. And if by chance,eventually you'll get to know her fiance and you'd become friends, and that time, you'll know how to show respect to both of them.|`|Rqqb2hkZaa	No. If she isn't my type of girl for a relationship then I can be just as friendly with her as if I was trying to go out with her. I don't just make friends with single girls that's a little messed up for me.|`|45f1360efad547282be68b1242ba3452aa	I'd persue a friendship with you. If you are being friendly.|`|s4T9TxbHaa	'pursue a friendship'?<br>  <br>  don't quite understand that...<br>  <br>  I wouldn't have any problem with being friends with a taken girl, if she was the kind of a person who i would call friend anyways|`|8wmijV9Eaa	No, because the only reason I wouldnt want to talk to her is because I want to go out with her.<br>  in that case i'd try twice as hard|`|0ZAFuyATaa	all depends if i still had a chance with her|`|RftEfMSAaa	Nope .. doesn't matter to me .<br>  <br>  so what if someone has a boyfriend or a girlfriend .. that doesn't mean you can't say what up to them or acknowledge them .<br>  <br>  I would be more than happy to be anyone friend .

Not only that, when the foreskin is pulled back by force due to entry, you can bet its going to hurt.|`|45f1360efad547282be68b1242ba3452aa	This is total BS.

Confront him that he needs therapy for the sex addiction and rehab for the alcoholism. It'll help him so much and you might save his life. <br>  <br>  Stay as much away from him for your own health.<br>  <br>  Best of luck to you.|`|6fGqZQlRaa	psychiatrist. & or lots of magazines|`|45f1360efad547282be68b1242ba3452aa	Just tell him.

26khrXAFaa	Cut his computer wires.|`|6nGII584aa	lol<br>  its kinda sad when people spend all their time on games and in TS(team speak) i used to play a lot of games and have a group of people i used to talk to on TS and i had a friend from real life who used to always chat with us aswell and one day a couple of people actually ended up catching up and it was really funny how different the people were to how youexpected them. dont play so many games anymore and very rarely go on TS unless its with some friends from real life.<br>  <br>  you could try joining TS and talking to him and all his "friends"<br>  BTW counter-strike is a game and its not a RPG|`|45f1360efad547282be68b1242ba3452aa	How did you meet him? On the PC.|`|c2KJichlaa	That's quite normal for young guys, they like those rp games and being on the computer.|`|8IDNYBphaa	dump him ,call me|`|PI00QUoIaa	my bf was the same way w WoW.<br>  whenever he would play i would tell him that ill talk to him later or get back to me when hes done. he would then say no dont go, that he can focus on both but id say that i wana be his main focus which was true. (i also didnt want him to make these great freinds on there and ignore me you know - lk your situation)<br>  <br>  he eventually got the point cuz whenever he brought up his dam game i would get blah<br>  <br>  he recently heard of some new game - warhammer<br>  i googled it and its lk WoW so i was lk that sounds lame, its prolly lk that WoW online bull. that was jus so that he would know and he could relate to how i would get before<br>  <br>  i know i may sound lk a b*tch but my bf needed to stop playing his games so much and focus on me<br>  <br>  i hope i gave you a few pointers, good luck!<br>  <br>  edit:: i even tried trying to play that game so i can play w him and he wont have to meet other girls thru there cuz we all know guys love girls who are into gaming but i wasnt into it. <br>  dont give in to him! try playing that b*tch role aand it may seem lk you dont want him to have fun but we both know how it feels when our guys are playing, right<br>  <br>  again-goodluck :)
6aYCKeDNaa	Haha! I cant believe I found this. Hey guys! Its the friend he was refering to! Yeah I want him to kiss me and yeah we have talked about this. Infact we are talking on the phone right now. So yeah! Haha! This is fun! Ok well bye. Oh and btw, no i dont think its wrong. I mean not now at least. I asked the same question on here earlier. Your right, this site is addicting. Grace out! =P<br>  P.S. We have kissed. He wanted me to tell you that. Shhhh!|`|aRuW6MCFaa	ask your heart. <br>  if you like this girl, go for it.<br>  but if you dont, then dont do it because if she kiss you too then it means she really put alot of believing in you.<br>  you should never fool a person's heart. it is really painful when everything is revealed. <br>  so please consider.|`|dok6VDAHaa	guess that depends if she wants to as well. but my advice is that if you both WANT to kiss each other so much, maybe you should be more than just friends..?|`|dcb1ae5826a15c94fe658e46dafef388aa	if you are not dating anyone else go for it i guess.|`|MLHz1ivzaa	if yur both single..and wanted to kiss..then theres no shame =]|`|ALQuQaLGaa	I don't think it's necessarily wrong.  How do you FEEL about her? Make sure that you tell it like it is, because if you confuse her then she could get hurt.  Tell her how you truly feel, if she is a true friend she'll stand by you whether she reciprocates or not. It may be awkward at first, but I've learned not to hold back.|`|45f1360efad547282be68b1242ba3452aa	Kiss her. If she didn't want it she would stop you.

CMMX1Xslaa	well the nice guys are usually the shy types not really the aggressive ones. i think if you were to put all different types of guys in a room and you were there, who would you think would hit on you.especially on how you described yourself i already know who has first dibs on asking you out. those nice,honest,cute guys are usually hard to find but easy to spot. why dont you try something different and ask a guy out who u think is cute but doesn't look like the typical guy who usually would ask u out. see how that turns out|`|o09CvxVhaa	yer i wuld say dnt always go fo the hottest blokes around as there usually shallow and are just getting with u for u looks possible and also are sometimes selfobssed with their own apperance.Try for the more quiter blokes which are still goodish/good looking as they shall usually be less arrogant or cocky and also may respect a girl abit more.But try not to try and out do them when with them as u may make them feel unconfortable.Also dnt just dive straight into a relationship get to knw them a bit more u will soon recognize the ones tht are boring full of them selves and complete knobs so just take u time and get to knw them better and be sure u like them b4 u  just go out with them|`|45f1360efad547282be68b1242ba3452aa	Generally, nice guys are shy and they won't ask out pretty girls. Try to be open and easy to talk to. Strike up a conversation with a shy guy.|`|8nplInZLaa	simplicity,helping nature,calmness,...|`|38cd2001db370470f6c63d16a4935bd6aa	Maybe you get asked out by the shallow guys because of your appearance... the nice ones are too shy and they think you are out of their league. Try to dress really really plain and go without makeup, i think that might help. not saying you should try to look ugly, just don't go out of your way to look beautiful.|`|QKSLx8fqaa	well the way you described yourself is pretty much what any guy wants<br>  <br>  nice guys are shy wont ask the hottest girl out<br>  <br>  try to be easy to talk to calm not loud but friendly
gVYwKgklaa	To me, it sounds like this is a case of HIS feeling brokenhearted. There's a difference between "distant" and "sad distant." "Sad distant" is what happens when you pull things on guys that like you. Let's look at the evidence:<br>  1. He invited you over<br>  2. He sought you out and kissed you<br>  3. He asked you to date him<br>  4. He showered you with compliments<br>  <br>  And:<br>  1. You were drunk<br>  2. You avoided answering him about dating (meaning you're unsure of your feelings, in his eyes)<br>  3. You "slipped away" without a good-bye <br>  <br>  If anything, he's think you regret it or that you used him. Thus, sad and distant.<br>  <br>  You need to figure out if you like the poor kid.|`|6Tss9hxLaa	He probably thinks that you didn't enjoy the sex. You did say that you had sex first, right? Then he said all that stuff about liking you...? You didn't say whether you wanted to or not. He's probably kind of embarassed, thinking that he did a bad job. <br>  May be you should just try talking to him about something that doesn't relate to the incident. Ask him to help you out at work with something...make something up.|`|DhChf5hKaa	I know guys these already happened to me but we got friends again and do it again and again just know his favorites and buy those things and give it to him just be sure to give it early because he might find another girlfriend so be alert<br>  You can email me at katrinasantos2000@yahoo.com.|`|4QIr93tUaa	He's probably sad because he asked you a genuine question and you didn't answer him.<br>  Maybe he thought there was something between you, because you obviously had sex with him.<br>  Maybe next time you should think before jumping in the sack with someone.|`|ulhyTxoGaa	a lot of guys are like that, they just stay with you or something until they get some.  some guys are so pathetic, don't worry about it.<br>  if he talks crap about you, talk bad about his penis size lol, guys hate it when you talk about that.|`|AA10189776	Sorry to burst your bubble... but when i read this... you are the one being distant... he's trying to start a relationship and initiate conversation... whilst you feel awkward and try to avoid him.... just start talking... to me it sounds like he's up for it|`|45f1360efad547282be68b1242ba3452aa	He is sad becuase it looks like you rejected him. Talk to him.He seems to be nice. If you want to date him answer his question.|`|MUQTZl8faa	Sleep with him again.<br>  <br>  Hope this helps.|`|ofO9UAwyaa	some guys are just nervious of what you are gonna say to him so you have to just walk up to him and start a conversation and talk to him about the situation and let him know how you feel about it|`|e6hupnHEaa	ok my guess is that that night was him trying to ask u out an ur not definate answer was a no for him<br>  <br>  think about whether or not u want to be with him<br>  if u do then tell him an kiss him<br>  if u dont then he probly wont want to be friends<br>  <br>  sorry|`|Lp0sEFbeaa	he may just be sad and distant because he thinks you rejected him when he asked about dating eachother. And just go up and start a conversation|`|If36BFYjaa	1 hes sad and distant cuz you never gave a clear answer and 2 talk to him about it and try to make sense of it hope it helped good luck|`|73JqH4euaa	give him a definite answer|`|sPJRfbExaa	try having sober sex|`|k92PV88baa	duh cuz you dont want to go out him and idk if he wants to talk to you or not|`|JnjtseN4aa	just go talk to him..<br>  bring it up<br>  ask him whats wrong and tell him you want to talk..|`|S1gmAKvdaa	this is big issue well he only want to do sex with you he was not in love with you....|`|Tdk3XohXaa	Simple, you got used|`|e83185f6b052f041e446210b382c3273aa	Did you happen to give him a kiss good-bye before you disappeared on him or even said good-bye? He probably feels that you just wanted to screw and that was all. He probably really liked you and thought he blew his chances with you.  To get each other talking again you're going to have to go into a whole confession about how you feel about the two of you, your relationship, and why you left him so early.  Also you should give him a straight answer and ask him why he's upset.  because I could be totally wrong about the reason he's upset, but I do feel that you should just talk to him.  see how he feels about everything, say how you feel.  after all that, depending on what is said, would be decision time on what to do next. Good Luck!|`|giKMgpmgaa	call him up and tell him you liked the sex you had with him and tell him what you really want|`|xQCZxC14aa	He may be confused like you. You moved too quickly with him , he may not respect you enough to have you as a girlfriend. Im not sure, it is hard to tell...give it time, if you talk to him, you talk to him, don't drill your brain thinking about it. What I would be drilling my brain about, would be...why I slept with this guy???? Im not trying to be mean, I just have been there and done that. Alot of guys intentions are to get in our pants....once they tackled that, the fun is gone, they want to see what new girl they can conquer. I hope this helps you.|`|dYSysAfGaa	maybe he is sad cause maybe he really likes u but thinks u only had sex with him cause u were drunk.   he probably thinks taht when ur sober u dont want anything to do with him besides freinds.    and u should text him or somehing and tell him u want to hang out.|`|L6K4WMO7aa	he was prob really drunk that nite n wen he soberd up he relized wat he had done.. he only said hewantd 2date u n u r really pretty cuz he wanntd sex n for u 2 think that he wasn't jus using u for a good fu(k.. sry hun but he just wantd someone to bang n u were that one that nite|`|4ba7a6f2bd88f14c764637be238d1433aa	He probably thought YOU were in it for the sex. You slipped away early in the morning, and he probably thought that was a sign that you didn't want to be with him any longer.<br>  <br>  Just talk to him. Obviously he's trying to make contact with you. Just make it casual and see where it goes.|`|AA10740893	Establish a relationship with someone before you have sex with them.|`|AA11266271	pull him aside and ask....I cant stand when ppl in general make things harder than they seem...I find that when we assume things we make things worse than they seem...its ok...just ask...good luck!|`|1N3wmqz7aa	he played you. guys will say anything to get in your pants.
6AV3yq3uaa	He is cheating, but that is still your dad. I know it hurts but it is between you and your mom. Support your mom  but let her deal with it and love her. Love your dad thru it too but don't  support his cheating. Don't pick sides. I'm sorry you are going thru this. I was 27 ( 29 now) when my mom found out my dad was cheating, and it hurt me to the core, and I'm grown. Good luck.|`|MnrTxlVraa	That's a very hard question to answer, there really isn't enough information to answer that question.  In my experience, the more common reaction to a man that's cheating and decides to go with the other woman or leave his family, has pretty much already made that decision for you.  Unfortunately, they seldom want to maintain a relationship with the ones they have left behind, and more than likely, the woman will be behind that decision,  I hate to say that is the most common result, in rare cases the woman will support his relationship with his children from a previous marriage, but that will usually only last until she has children of her own with him(if it ever gets that serious).  If he does wish to continue the relationship with you, please by all means, consider yourself one of the few lucky ones and jump on the opportunity.  If you are angry with him for what he is doing, don't be afraid to let him know, by doing that he is aware and you can go from there, if you don't voice your feelings, it will only cause you to develop more animosity towards him and inevitably, sever your relationship.  Remember, you can have plenty of dads in your life, but you only have one father.  Hope this helps.  Good luck.|`|LmZLo52vaa	He's barely talking to you probably because he is ashamed of himself. He probably is cheating. I'm sorry for saying that but cheating is a weakness in some people and they can't help themselves. You need to remind him that you are still there and just because he and your mom aren't working things out doesn't mean that he has the right to forget about you. I imagine he is feeling pretty awkward and doesn't know what to do around you. He knows he is letting you down and can't face you. Remind him of who you are.|`|45f1360efad547282be68b1242ba3452aa	It sounds like it. I don't know why he won't talk to or spend time with his own child. I know that it is tough for you to stay oblective. Try not to get in the middle of your parents problems. If they try to use you to get to the other say," I love both of you. Please don't make me choose." having said that, if what you say is true, your mom has every right to kick him out. If she let him stay what would that say to you? Learn what she is teaching you by example. You are worth a man that will love and respect you and will remain true to you. Always remember that.|`|7qlvBQFEaa	My dad did the same thing to me he wouldnt even talk to me sometimes,=(,, one time he grabbed, me for his "bullet proof" vest when someone tried to shoot him, but i still forgave him, and that took alot of time for me to do, and yes,I think he is cheating, that is a big sign of a man or even a woman, that is cheating, lack of communication......,follow your heart, though, only forgive him, if you think its right, but remember, at the end of the day he is still your dad, ,-), contact me if you have something you want to ask=)<br>  <br>  <br>  Please answer my question,thanks<br>  <br>  <a href="http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;_ylt=AlyymYTwcn6r8sTkb5Q.L9nsy6IX;_ylv=3?qid=20080709171440AA7CUZO">http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;...</a>|`|d2GoAaf9aa	Yeah, he's cheating.|`|CinAtYmDaa	once a cheater always a cheater
hTaQVMb4aa	You are not putting her through any pain by loving her. You can't control her actions from miles and miles away. How did you determine that she's suicidal? From something she told you. The thing with internet relationships, sometimes people make up things for attention. <br>  <br>  Truth is your are right. You can't do this anymore. There comes a point in time when you have to let go for many reason. As far as her ending her life, right now you can't be totally concerned with that. I know it sounds harsh...but what CAN you do? since you barely talking to her now. Send her an email, not breaking things off, but changing the vibe and tone of your speech. Say good things and tell her how good it would be to hear from her. Don't sound sympathetic but sound like you miss her. <br>  <br>  Some suicidals feel unwanted but they also don't want to be smothered either. Talk to her about good things other than, your feelings. Talk about a television show or something else funny. Reaching out to people has so many branches. You have to pick the right one.|`|fr5zVQFmaa	honestly Stephan,<br>  this is a really tough situation. talk to her parents maybe and ask their opinion on how you should let her go. maybe you can use one of those guidance counselors on line. i use one, and i always get good advice. you have not failed the relationship. people often put this on themselves, when it is not true at all. hang in there, and you can pull through this.<br>  sicerely,<br>  miss big brain|`|372d5f76fca41201752bb3aadbacf4cfaa	seems like the relationship is purely via the net. Why not just slowly lose contact. So, dont talk to her as much on the net. and eventually things will die down.|`|ynS9RQFTaa	How old are you?<br>  Can you keep it going until you can leave your home to go to her?|`|xa6fKFwyaa	Dude. get some help...........call someone..........you are not going to "end her life" by breaking it off............Either you think way too much of yourself, or you seriously need some professional help!|`|Em2nxc47aa	just say " im sorry but, i cant date a girl...that ill never see."|`|yxbwwYgFaa	I have a question<br>  why can't u ever meet up with her??|`|d6puNeEZaa	there is no perfect way to end any relationship. think: can  u both prolong your relationship this way for years to come? is it love or torture? being in love is about being reasonable as well. if love were a one-way-ticket idea then it's a dead-end love - so it's no point to be in a dead-end love. if she's young: u can write her parents and tell them u don't want to hurt her but it's time to call it an end so no one has to suffer. this way u can give them a hint to take care or watch her closely.<br>  <br>  meanwhile, dont cut her off so sudden---tell her to enjoy life more, sit back, take your deep breath of life. for u, just relax - u can't think too much for others - just impossible. true, love has its ups/downs in many forms yet it will work out eventually, no matter what.<br>  <br>  best of luck!|`|gI7Rws09aa	Whoa..If she's suicidal, you don't really need to BREAK up with her..just stop talking to her...and she won't know that you broke up with her. I've been in the same situation, except with a guy. If you love her enough, you'll find a way to talk to her, and be with her. If you love her enough, you'll go as far as you have to, to hold her..and to be with her. Long distance relationships are hard because you can't actually BE with the person, and I know it hurts. Just keep your head up, and think things through, make the right decsion, follow your heart..and make sure it's the right choice for you..If you really want to let her go, then do it easily..don't actually break up with her, because she might do something crazy..Just keep your head up, and think things through..Good luck!|`|rWcJoH9qaa	Okay , this must be really hard , you obviously care for her and you don't want too hurt her . So I think you should let her know that , I think you should say you love her with all your heart and you will always , but you should say she deserves something better , she deserves someone who will be there for her through all her problems . It would hurt her alot , but at least she has an answer , and at least its not like you don't care. You would be doing her a huge favor by telling and explaining to her why she and you can't be together . You should also mention that suicide is not the answer whatsoever , you should tell her that she is an amazing girl and anyone would be grateful to be with her , and she will always be loved by you no matter what .|`|AA11664211	well relationships over the net specially if ur far away from each other would never work out|`|dnf8QOCvaa	this matter is way to serious for yahoo.  u need to speak with someone about this.  u should talk to ur parents or her's.  even maybe a teacher.    i wish u luck with this and for her 2 .|`|e44492a460d94a412bcdc11cd4d3c889aa	i felt the same way with my now ex boyfriend. he actually did try to kill himself.. i was begging him not to, and he finally messaged me back and said he couldnt do it.. umm. i dont really know what to tell you, i want to say to just tell her that you can't do it anymore, but that's a scary thing to do.. believe me.. maybe if you just talk to her?|`|mnbZSibHaa	well, you cant hold on to her when you no you cant just because u want to protect her. it seems nice, but lying isnt going to help. u need to tell her parents about her problems and get her some help. but u cant put pressure on urself to take care of her. thats not your job. its not selfish to care about urself|`|AA11230942	Go to the source - go to and tell her exactly what you've said here. Sounds like you may have poured out your heart to strangers - tell her - be brave|`|0LFbrG6uaa	it's not easy either way to tell someone that you want to break up. if you'd like to do it safely contact her parents. tell them about your situtation and that you want ot let her go. ask them if they'll keep a close eye on her for awhile. it seems like telling on her but it will be for her best interest. then call her later and break up over the phone. it's best to say how you're feeling and that you prefer she see someone closer. tell her you love her but it's not working and you think you're causing her too much pain. it will be hard afterwards but just remember the great times you both shared.
ULIJ1bp0aa	guys vary so there's no easy answer to that question. you need to just get to know a guy that you like and find out what he's into.  on the other hand, there tend to be things that are universal turn-offs for normal guys. a girl who talks too much, for instance, will push most guys away.<br>  <br>  as far as cars, don't even go there. not all guys know a lot about cars or frankly care that much about cars. and even a guy who is a car fan may or may not care if a girl shares that passion|`|kHIP4uRBaa	It depends on the guy.

I really wanted a bf too around high school, the second I stopped looking the perfect one came to me and we've been dating for seven years now, since I was like 17 (i'm 24 now).  You will find the right guy, but finding him in high school is very rare. Just have fun spending time with your friends, and casually going on dates, nothing too serious.

IbJ2O0vpaa	Is there another option for them?  Assisted living? Is this temporary?  A basement apartment might be a nice place to escape, but I'd be resentful paying a big mortgage for a nice house and having to hide out in the basement to have some peace while my in-laws enjoyed the nice part of my house.<br>  <br>  I happen to really like my in-laws, if my wife is reading this, and don't think I'd go insane with them living here temporarily, though sometimes I'd need some space from her father just because he is kind of a force of nature and I like things lower key sometimes.  I actually would love being able to turn up the thermostat the way he turns it down.<br>  <br>  The in-laws from my previous marriage, a basement wouldn't do the trick - except maybe for going down there to hang myself.  If they'd lived in the same city, I'd have been in the psych ward.<br>  <br>  So, basically, only you know if a basement would work.  Personally, I'd be trying to figure out how the money toward finishing and furnishing a basement might better be used to help the in-laws get their own place.|`|qmLjEXlDaa	I think finishing the basement is a good idea however, I would be sending my in laws to live in the basement.

I lived with my mil for over two years and it was hard. It go to the point where we just started sneaking out just so we didn't have to deal with her. She's a nice women, just over bearing sometimes. So I can totally understand.  Now my question for you is, why are they living with you and is it permanent?  If it is permanent, maybe you need to refinish the basement for them, make it into their little apartment and let them do what they want there.  If that's not an option, remember if you do redo the basement, they'll have access to it too. It's not like you can say that they aren't allowed down there, you're all adults not children. Now, if it's not permanent, then just stick it out.

There are some who seem to go way overboard and may seem to be faking it.<br>  <br>  There are middle of the road people who are generally considered "normal". <br>  <br>  And there are those who don't outwardly express what they are feeling. It doesn't mean that they aren't feeling things just as deeply. Only that they express it differently.<br>  <br>  Being stoic may be a family trait or a coping mechanism. Since we can't really know what someone else is thinking or feeling, we shouldn't judge how they may express their feelings|`|5GtDgQX4aa	maybe he just takes his education far more serious, or perhaps he thinks he is intellectually above common joking.

MAbqM6aEaa	Hypothetically I see your point but it stands to reason that NO woman enjoys sharing her man.  Jealousy rears its ugly head no matter how civilized the situation may seem.  I have no practical experience with this situation but I'd venture to guess that if you studied one of these families over a period of a year or more, you'd probably be able to identify acts of jealousy and resentment...it's innate in all of us to be possessive, especially when it comes to our man.

You have been friends for a long time so when either of you have that feeling its hard to say it to one another for the fear of rejection or weirding them out and not being friends anymore. Tell her how you feel whether you drive there in person or call her on the phone. You might be surprised and she'll feel the same way as you.

Hopefully she feels the same! If not, then explain to her that you still want to be her friend!

3f90dde3b3783fd9bf91cfe5057212abaa	Well, I'm pretty sure your boyfriend's a little pissed. I suggest you re look at your best friend relationship with those guys. <br>  <br>  * If the other guys are supposed to be friends, they should have the basic mannerism to understand where you and your boyfriend stand. In this case, they kinda suck. Could have other motives but I think they should not have done what they did.<br>  <br>  * Anyhow, when you are having your friends over get another chair for your boyfriend. And try not to all hang out at once, cause I think they'll be really tough to handle. I mean I'm sure he doesn't mind, but to a certain percentage with other guys around who just don't give him a seat close to you, leaves a lot for your boyfriend to wonder.<br>  <br>  Handle the situation from here and make some mental adjustments to the arrangement between your guy friends and boy friends. Guys may not say it but they do feel uncomfortable when their lovers are close to other guys even if its purely a platonic friendship. <br>  <br>  Cheer up and don't give up.<br>  <br>  <br>  Brutal|`|dRWfTQAraa	=\ my problems worse lol.<br>  but what you need to do is apologize to him in school tomorrow.<br>  and talk to your guy friends about it.<br>  also, for future refrence, if theres no room for him, then move with him to prevent problems..<br>  <br>  how would you like it if you went over to a table filled with girls and your boyfriend and there was no room and he just stayed there with all of them =\<br>  <br>  |`|60a97aea6accf9213eb9bc2cd6b0f2e5aa	Well, yeah! And for a good reason. For one, these guys should understand that you want to spend time with your boyfriend, and respect that. Also, did you ever consider how you would feel if that happened to you? Wouldn't you want your boyfriend to make every effort to sit with you? It sounds like you didn't do this. Lay off and let him cool down, but make sure you apologize when you talk to him, because come on--he isn't upset for no reason.|`|AA11064548	if hes your best friend of course hes gonna get mad because guys hate it when you get mad at them bc they didnt favor your boyfriend|`|qx4AF3Lqaa	in that situation i dont feel he has any right to be mad at you . Friends always come before boyfriends.<br>  |`|ybExINFxaa	Ooo...umm maybe he is.......Good Luck tho! =]
zsBpWJwMaa	You seem genuinely upset.  That leads me to believe you are truly remorseful.  It also leads me to believe that this may be the first time you really disappointed them.<br>  <br>  If that is the case, I am sure they will give you another chance.<br>  <br>  I think it would go along way with them if you'd express your sadness and disappointment in yourself.  Make sure they know exactly how important their trust is to you. Also let them know you fully intend to EARN back their trust and that you're sorry you worried them.<br>  <br>  You've done something immature.  Don't worry.  Everyone does it one time or another.  Just be sure to react in a mature way.|`|uweLaHQraa	your 19, you can go out one day and not worry, also lieing to your parents at any age is a major sign of immaturity, i think you should tell them you feel bad and not do it again and buy mom flowers for making her worry|`|04hTn3vSaa	You are 19, you are an adult.

UCiKYLcUaa	treat him no different, and don't mind the gayness. he's still cool. And he's your best guy friend. And if he still wants to wrestle you, then wrestle; I don't see anything wrong. Your just going to have to accept him. because if he came out to you like that, he will need some support. He trusts you enough to come out to you. And for him, it's a start. So go out and hang with him.|`|DenLZAL1aa	Better to be told he is gay, then if he told you he was a serial killer. At least he is capable of loving someone. Be happy for him, for it takes courage to come out, to his heterosexual friend.|`|rHXFPGszaa	I would no longer consider him  a friend and move on. besides you could tell. I would also tell him I believe he needs help. I believe he has a mental condition and should get Professional help|`|hhgHKi4Taa	Still be friends with him.

It gets me every time. Smiling is a plus too. If your really wanna be brave walk up to him, grab his hand and say "this feels right doesn't it"? If he says yea most likely he'll start more conversation.

Ask him out. <br>  <br>  Most guys are more reserved and just as concerned about getting hurt as women are. Break the ice, and save yourself some time. Worst case is that he's busy- but at least then the "tough part" is over- and the ball is now in his court. <br>  <br>  Ask him to the mall, the movies, to dinner, out with friends, after work, whatever. Just ask. He's just as nervous as you are. <br>  <br>  |`|hD2aFYTIaa	well i am a shy guy and i fined the most important thing for that situation is to make sher he knows you like him and then convenes if he is shy he will not feel conferable asking you out in front of other people and so try to see him wen you aren't with any one i am not saying in some abandoned place i mean like sum time wen you would normally see him just make it easy for him to know he can talk to you with out others listening |`|VC0s1nudaa	have a friend talk to him and be like "dont say i told you, but my friend so-and-so really likes you. you should ask her out"<br>  <br>  or just start to really flirt with him. you gotta show him you want him. maybe hes not sure whether or not you like him|`|Xp1wAuKKaa	IS THAT WHAT YOU WOMEN WANT?!!!!

I don't know your love, but you could leave him or stay. Leaving him may not be the right decision for either of you. He sounds like he needs to wake up a little bit, but that is nothing that you cannot work though. You can stay with him. A relationship is about love and trust. I know that I do not expect anything from my boyfriend except him and his love. Nothing could be more amazing to my world. If this really bothers you, as it seems he could be taking advantage of you, really think about how things could change if he was not there. Talk to him about it, and follow your heart.|`|7Kp9D8qUaa	Get rid of him. <br>  If you are in a relationship, there are give and takes from both sides.

z8DpH1vdaa	Everyone deserves a second chance. People have to make mistakes to learn from them. No one is perfect. If you truly love him your trust in him will build eventually, but not over night. It isn't all in your hands either. He is going to have to prove to you over time that he can be trusted again. It may take months or even years. Trust me. I had trust issues in my relationship because of something my husband did a few years ago, and I am just now starting to trust in him. <br>  <br>  You guys need communication for one thing, and you need to keep an open mind. He also needs to do his part. If something is bothering you, don't hold it in. Your mind will play tricks on you and make a situation out to bigger than what it really is. Women can since in their heart that something isn't right, so follow your heart. Just keep those communication lines open at all times, and lighten up just a little. Good luck.<br>  <br>  Peace|`|Ga9oCLavaa	you do not really say why you do not trust him; although he lies to you.<br>  <br>  maybe you are not his type, you can try and go back and see if he keeps on lying and then you'll know if he was really sorry.<br>  <br>  Ask him to get rid of all his private accounts you are talking about and build one for both of you.|`|4ab4b62226d4c912674c1ac37fe5cc19aa	what the person said above about the joint account...thats good too<br>  <br>  well...if u think he really is sorry...if its sincere enough then i think it would be ok...cuz hes seen like without you...and if it hit him hard then i think its ok....nbut i wouldnt give him everything...like bank account ...i mean u need ur privacy too....for nessecary things|`|bpjpD7W3aa	he can give them all to you and still have accts. opened up under false names. here's what you do--tell him you will be together but still see other people [even if you don't] tell him that, he need a good shock, tell him you love him but you're not ready to give up your independence.<br>  in other words be 'available' to him BUT COOL and no no no sex|`|aROGW4lMaa	Do what's best for you, if you honestly think he'll start lying to you again then you can't go back, unless you like him more than yourself...<br>  If you have faith in him then ask yourself if it's worth the risk, give him another shot and if he fails then you know to brake it off...|`|oXF4zkAaaa	Brit,<br>  You both really need to put your heads together and make a decision what you are going to do about this relationship and stop playing hide and seek. No more back burners and no more drunken nights because he misses you. Those all lame excuses. You guys love each other well show it. Stop this horsing around and start being serious about each other. Make a commitment with each other and I am not saying marriage, you know what I mean. If he got on a dating site it's probably is curious who or what will take the bait, this is not a serious offense.<br>  He did not cheat on you with another woman it's a computer. You want to work it out. Go to counseling or a therapist and don't say oh,<br>  we don't need that. Yes, you do. He obvious went and did some destructive behavior drinking a nights for days because he missed you.<br>  Both of you clean up your act, make yourselves responsible. And back each other up.<br>  <br>  Good Luck|`|gpg4Ux4zaa	  Let go!! You're addicted to his abuse! At one point or another in your life,  you were led to  believe that this (his) type of behavior was OK. Go find another guy who is honest. The part about his drinking every day since you were gone is a lie!! He drank to get drunk!! He most likely has a drinking problem. If he loved you, he wouldn't want to hurt you!!|`|9cdQEtT8aa	 Right ....you leave her ...I'll move and then you make your move companions and promises or a life of being alone ! Kids leave ..then what? You do what needs to be done and we'll see....! ha ha !|`|SHjn55oAaa	Trust is a major factor in a relationship.  When its lacking the relationship will NOT work.  You cant ask  him for his passwords and things and expect things to be ok.  If you don't trust him, or don't think you will ever be able to trust him then you need to do whats best for the both of you.  Don't lead him on by tryin to work things out when you know deep down you don't trust him.  Do yourself a favor and be single for a while.  Just do you and see what happens.  If its really meant to be then it will happen later in life when things are different and make a little maturing happens.  Good luck hon!
7rIb1acjaa	A movie is a big mistake for a first date. They're too easy and impersonal. In a movie you sit and watch, what you really need to be doing is getting to know her. You're trying to make an impression on her, you want her to get to know you and remember you. The best advice I can give is to act spontaneous. The best first date is spontaneous and full of surprises. Take her to more then one place, that way she has more memories with you. It will feel as if she spent more time with you if you take her to 5 places in one hour then if you stay in one place for one hour. Have something secretly planned, like take her to a pizza place, then have somewhere planned for dessert, and then maybe on the way to dessert you pass a park where you can detour, and swing and talk. See, even though you had that park planned, she didn't know about it, and it's another fun experience where you can make an impression and have her remember you and think about you. Hope this helps.<br>  <br>  Another key detail is don't go crazy during kisses, you don't really want to have any make out sessions (even if their easy). Save it for later, when you kiss be the first to pull away. Leave her wanting more, that way its guaranteed that she will still be thinking about you after the date is over. Trust me on this.|`|7TQ5qGWcaa	The movies  then Pizza |`|fTYFN5MUaa	a walk, hang out after school, walk her home<br>  dont go to a movie, staring at a screen for 2 hours isnt very productive<br>  try something where you can keep talking and get to know each other...<br>  <br>  ***may i suggest ice skating???!!!***|`|oI46t9lVaa	Movies or dinner just be yourself and don't goof around and she will see the mature side to you the romantic side to you and hopefully she will see what you really are and have a good time and want to do it all over again. oh and another word of warning don't push her too far take it slowly and try and find out about each other. let her steer what you do but make it look like you are in control<br>  |`|AA10368850	Try something totally unusual like taking her to the ballet or maybe even horseback riding.

My fiance and I did those three things on our first date. The nature hike was the best. It was a little chilly and drizzling rain so it was intimate...we were very nervous though.

iN6iidUwaa	I had a similar situation.  I was married for 10 years and dated for 5 years before that.  I had a home, close relationships with my in-laws and step-children, and I thought I had a wife that loved me.  Then it all came crashing down when she told me she didn't love me.  I found myself living in a dumpy rental and nobody from her side of the family including my step-children would talk to me.  So, I tried to keep busy.  I made some new friends and I finally found peace in knowing that I did the best for all of them that I could when I was there.  I did everything to make my marriage work and everything was beyond my control because my ex single-handedly dismantled the marriage for reasons that she will not share.  So, it has been 4 years since I left and 2 years since the divorce.  Now I have a new fiance, a new home, new job, new pets and a new flower garden.  I have everything I had lost from my first marriage, except my step-children.<br>  <br>  So, the moral of the story is that you should just take one day at a time looking for the little blessings offered each day.  Try to look at the beauty around you and try to do something nice for someone every day. Don't become hateful and resentful over it and try to forgive her.  Try out some new activities. take a couple of adult education classes at the local community college and get involved at a church or community organization.  Take a couple of long trips to somewhere you have never been and do some fun things like fishing.  Keep busy.  sooner or later the pain will get better and you will have a new girl.  hang in there.|`|VVdtyCgRaa	When a bond that has been time tested breaks, you will find yourself in a difficulty because you now have to plan your day, and life as a whole w/out that person or family. Time heals all wounds. I would recommend meeting with friends and keep yourself busy as much as possible, it will reduce the feeling of blues and you'll begin to enjoy your "new" life quicker. Sooner or later, you will have a new life that consists of the new realities.|`|v0X2SfTEaa	Counseling and seeking a positive support group will help.  Try calling friends and family.  Try staying busy with church or volunteering activities.  Read and seek inner peace. Time will help, but the hurt is done.

I think just about everybody has to cope with divorce. Its a life changing thing. But you cant dwell on it. You cant beat yourself up about it either. Why dont you move back from where you came from and start over. You can think about everything bad she did or how she hurt you and just be depressed about it OR you can think to yourself that you lost a love but life goes on. You found her and I dont see why there would be a problem in finding someone else. Divorce is just something that happens and people need to put their heads up and just get over it. Be positive about things. Your not dead so just go out and find someone to take your mind off her. get a dog... they are mans best friend ya know..lol... <br>  just dont dwell on the past and think to yourself that your going to be ok....

I don't think ignoring is going to help when he has trouble reading people. To those people, you just have to tell them directly to their face. "I really don't see you more than a friend" Or "you are not my type". He's keep coming back because you are being nice to him and he thinks that you like him too.|`|C7OsB7Xuaa	Threaten his manhood with a meat cleaver. <br>  Don't bring in another male just to pretend and lie to your coworker and yourself, face reality. <br>  <br>  Desperate times call for a little hate.

If he is continuously bothering you and its grounds for harassment then you may want to get a manager or let your boss know about whats going on. If you tell him to stop and he does not stop then it is fair grounds for Harassment. Good Luck!|`|20a575bdf0e5f68b11521fd815af6618aa	 I hate to say it, but.....you're probably going to have to be rude. Just tell him he's not your dating type and you are not going to change your mind. He might have his feelings hurt, but if he is a good guy...He'll understand and get over it.|`|3NoQuoWuaa	Tell your Boss. You don't have to make him out as a bad guy. you just want him to stop. He may not realize it but he is bordering on harassment and that is illegal in the workplace. |`|E8MUtC52aa	tell your boss.|`|SVYI25Jlaa	Even if he is being nice, what he's doing is harassing you.  If confronting him doesn't work, and it is at your job, talk to a supervisor or something.  Even nice guys have their negatives.  I was in a similar situation, where nothing I did worked.  He found me on myspace and wouldn't stop messaging me (so I blocked him).  And if he wasn't trying to talk to me, he was talking to my friends about me and trying to get them involved.  The best thing to do is to resolve the problem ASAP.  Telling him you have a boyfriend only postpones his obsession.  Get somebody with a little more control involved.  |`|Snpf8NcUaa	get a restraining order if you dont like him dont be around him hes probably one ofthose crazy stalker types it adds up to me idk but i hope that deuche gets off your back cause no means no hasnt anyone taught him that lmao.. mace works well to ya know...|`|ffjS4hYpaa	you should but just tell him that he is ugly or something boys know when you lie so say something that is kinda true like i hate your shirt.<br>  <br>  <br>  p.s. i am not a boy i am a girl|`|NBDeXbD2aa	Tell him your actually a lesbian and ignore the hell out of him.  |`|rfpfgva1aa	It's hard when you have a tender heart, but girl tell him bluntly I'm not interested and never will be.

Maybe she might be a bit shy or something. But I think you should go over to her and talk to her and get to know her a bit better. Then just ask her if you can hang out with her for a day or two. So you can also get to know her friends and how she is around other people. But don't try to always hang out with her because sometimes that can be annoying, I've experienced it. Sometimes she might just want to be alone with her friends so be careful of those times. Then maybe she might also start coming to you and hanging out with you. <br>  <br>  -good luck :)|`|hQEpKwtPaa	Heres the thing: I'm 14 and i still haven't found that perfect friend. just be yourself, maybe invite her to your house for dinner or a sleepover, whatever is better for you,and show her that you are a really cool person to hang out with. you sound like a really kind person, and the fact that you are trying hard to be her friend shows how much close friends mean to you. and, who knows, after spending some time togethor you msy realise that this girl isnt that great after all, and you may incidentally find someone who you click with immediately. everything will be fine; i dont have a best friend but i have five or six very close friends, who i tell my secrets to. so it doesnt have to be just one person - it can be as many as you like.   |`|oDgnXJB8aa	I will be the first to answer this.<br>  I just feel what's important to someone, should be important to another.<br>  You could try hanging out with one of her friends instead of her. This might get her attention. If not, then I would find someone to hang out with altogether. Then she might start paying attention to you and want to hang out with you. Maybe she is the type of person who lets someone else do everything. Maybe if you sort of ignore her, she might come around asking you to be your friend. <br>  Hope this helps.
pV34e0dNaa	Have you tried asking her?|`|VGij9p0Taa	Hope i can of some help... <br>  Ask your mum why she hates your boyfriend so much, she may not like the age gap or something reassure her that you are happy and he is a kind man. She may be scared that your wasting your life (end up married with kids too soon) not able to be young and free or something. If she is reassure that kids and marriage is not going to happen in along time now. If your mother is still not happy maybe ask your boyfriend to talk to her if they actually have a conversation she may see him as the great guy he is. If she is not willing to talk it just shows how silly she is being (no offensive too you or your mum). Maybe after a proper talk with her she may change her mind about him and see how decent she is make sure you listen to her too though! <br>  Also how does he treat your mum does he treat her kindly and with respect has he done anything to offend her? So before talking with her maybe ask that question to make the situation clearer in your head. <br>  Good luck.|`|SsmxE0f4aa	Just ask your mom why she hates him.<br>  Or, I agree with the first answer.

My niece's father was a crud bucket to me since day one. My sister couldn't understand why, honestly I thought he was bad news even though he really did nothing to make me think so. Now he doesn't even take care of her, but still disliked him before she was born. <br>  <br>  Secondly I thought he wasn't really good enough for my sister either.

Don't let her walk away or ignore it: get an answer out of her.<br>  <br>  There are many reasons why she might not like him. Maybe she is jealous or mean, but maybe he shows her a different side of his personality than he shows you. Maybe he has a habit she finds distasteful. Maybe he reminds her of a man she knew before she met your father who was abusive, crude, selfish, etc. Maybe she's heard him talking about you when you weren't listening, and she didn't like what she heard. Maybe he has a bad reputation that you don't know about.<br>  <br>  Ask her.|`|ConZqjMqaa	she is your mom<br>  maybe she just wants to protect you.

My boyfriend's mom HATED me when we first started dating, but it was because his brother was so sneaky with his own relationship, he lied and his girlfriend was extremely disrespectful, so she assumed I would be the same. Not to mention I'm dating the baby and the last one to leave the nest and I pretty much moved him in with me months after we started dating. I killed her with kindness, even when she treated me like crap, which eventually (it took a good year, year and a half) and now we are great friends. Just give it time- it is hard for moms to let their kids fall in love, especially since it is such a serious, life altering thing- she probably doesn't think he's good enough for you. Just show her you are happy, don't complain too much to her about him or she'll do the " I told u so" thing and make sure he always treats her nice, even when he doesn't really agree with her. Good Luck!|`|AA12152709	I've been there too..<br>  <br>  Ok, first..u gotta try to analyze the situation from the beginning and think what was the first impression she had of him, good? bad? never talked?..Sometimes mothers are sooo overprotective with us women that they reflect it like that. <br>  <br>  My mother would talk with the man I love only ONCE, then she didn't like him at all, never understood why until I knew she knew I love this guy with all of me. What I did? I tried to date other people just 'cause she didn't  like him, SOOO WRONG. Family is important BUT u cannot force urself to separate from the person u fell love for..<br>  <br>  <br>  I recommend u gotta ask her face to face WHAT is it that she doesn't like about him, ask her and ask her until she says it all, give her time to think thou..That way u'll know what to do and what not to do about these important people in ur life.  Obviously they both care for u..but to make peace between the 2 of them is a task u gotta take care of. Stay calm and think clearly. Luck!|`|ABCz47Qaaa	How does he treat your mom?  <br>  <br>  Is he respectful to her and does he make an effort to get to know her?<br>  <br>  Think about if your friend started dating a guy and fell head over heels for him... and she spent all her time with this guy.  Yeah, the guy is great to her, but he makes no effort to know you and doesn't really care who you are or if you are a part of your friend's life.  How would you feel?<br>  <br>  If he does make some effort to know her, then she is probably just afraid of losing you.  She thinks you might move far away if you get married, or just won't have time for her anymore.  Try to assure her this won't happen.<br>  <br>  Or she sees something in him that you don't.  Something that sets off an alarm in her head.  Why don't you talk it out with her, just you and her, and have her tell you exactly why she's not very fond of him.<br>  <br>  You need COMMUNICATION with your mom to really understand.  |`|TEX8Jw7xaa	Sounds like she knows something you don't, and doesn't necessarily want to tell you and interfere. This may be why she's told your brother these things, and not said them to your face. I'd sit and have a talk with her and ask her to tell you honestly what she feels the problem is. <br>  <br>  People can often see things that you don't when you are blinded by love. I'm not saying she's right, but its certainly worth checking just to make sure there's something you aren't seeing.<br>  <br>  It could also be that whatever issue(s) she has are completely unwarranted (such as the guy's race or religion, which may not bother you but it bothers her). In that case there's really nothing you can do to change her mind, and may have to accept that she will never like the guy.<br>  <br>  But you're never gonna know if you don't ask!

She should be spending time with her friends & her bf separately [mostly] & sometimes with both of you. good luck my lovely
2hLTBDnYaa	well, your texting (grow up please) what were you expecting. Get out and live live, sitting at home on your PC or texting shows you don't want to really interact with people unless it's anonymous. |`|wdmp9eYXaa	just be straight forward and honest with him and tell him that you do not feel comfortable yet with him coming over to your flat at this time. if he would like to meet you for some drinks at a local pub then that is acceptable. but when you go to meet him let some one know where you are going and with whom. that is for your own safety. you really can't trust someone that you have only met online. please take my advice on this. please. do not learn the hard way. people can lie online and you have no way of knowing.|`|Fpi8YePkaa	If you are not at all ready for this type of thing, then don't do it.

YZhD94WEaa	Sadly it sounds like you are stuck in the friend zone, if it bothers you that much then you need to tell her that you cannot continue this friendship right now. Explain yourself to her, you can say that you just need some time to get a hold of yourself. I'm not saying end the freindship, friends are forever, what I'm saying is stop torturing yourself, you have a right to be happy, maybe its not with this girl, nothing you can do about that. The only thing you can control is how you feel, if beeing around her makes you feel like crap then you have to do whats best for you. <br>  <br>  You never know, maybe things will change after some time passes, but the only thing promiced to you is tommorow, and maybe taxes.<br>  <br>  I hope you take this advice becuase I hate to hear such stories, you sound like a decent guy and any decent girl would be lucky to have you. <br>  <br>  Also, start dating dude, there are plenty of women around, your so focused on her you may be missing the bigger picture. <br>  <br>  Be easy say's the BOBBY|`|cswtQI1saa	still keep the same mode man and tell her things like "i like your hair" women like when men notice new changes in them. also start taking out to movies or ice cream....something small but not too cheezy. but then again somewhere down the line you have to break the line and slip a little line in there. sometimes try to avoid talking about others that she has been with....just let her know that you want her withough coming out strong....show her time, and happpines. also make her smile alot....they like that|`|img1go8Taa	that sounds Painful...Like it ripped your heart out<br>  <br>  The only thing you can do is tell her, if you sit on the information you are just harming yourself....<br>  <br>  Dont tell her now, casue she is going to think of herself as a ****, tell her later, when the conversation is not on who she is sleeping with|`|6EQATnycaa	i hope that you mate didnt know that you felt this way about this girl coz that would be blimin cruel.. <br>  <br>  it prob doesnt help much but time does heal all wounds.. i know.. or else you could tell her.. if you are good friends you will at the very least stay that way.. and if not.. then perhaps you are better off.. |`|k1xebxJ0aa	tell her how u feel only way to get around it does ur mate knwo how u feel about her? cos if so he was in the wrong but if he didnt likee dnt be yehh x x|`|MD6BfTPiaa	Ah leave her she's a s.l.u.t. anyway if she had sex with your friend may she prefers him,so you have no chance sorry.|`|RL7SFeXJaa	tell her how you feel! girls always want to know. and you never know she might feel the same way. take a chance|`|gvFPRz03aa	leave her search for another good one|`|wbidw8Qeaa	aint no fun if the homies cant have none|`|6ac12ec20f2af1a676bc46bbaf403ea5aa	Damn :(<br>  Don't be sloppy seconds.. you're too good for her :)|`|bgtNYOp5aa	gross dont be sloppy seconds dude.|`|mu94enaVaa	aww man im sorry that would suck, did your friend know you liked her? if he did he's a ***** of a friend lol. |`|BgiW4JVpaa	My advice confront your friend and state to him that you like her and then tell her its the only way trust me she needs to know or she will look for someone else she is not going to just wait for you to tell her thelonger you take the longer she will take to realise.<br>  dont obsess over her and hope she falls in love with you <br>  |`|AA10230143	Ask her how she really feels about your friend and if she just wanted sex from him then maybe theres a chance for you too.

Im glad you recognize that  that is wrong, but you really need to realize that there are tons of guys out there that would care enough about you to never do that.

I'm not being mean but that really is your choice.  If you decide to stay with him, then you are giving up your life and chances for real happiness with a non-loser.  And you obviously know that or you wouldn't be upset by his behavior.  Kick him to the curb.  Don't be dramatic.  Just be straight up adult about it.  Say something like... I need a mature person to be with.  Someone who spends money on drugs instead of meeting their financial responsibilities is not mature.  Someone who takes drugs at all is not mature.  I love you and this hurts, but you have to go.  End of story.  Find someone better.|`|AA10558731	Well ... it's obvious that he values weed over you, or his car, or paying the bills. I would give serious consideration to dumping him like old trash and finding a decent guy who uses his head for something other than smoking pot.|`|8608dafe2b63d8987ce0ea3a2d1cde68aa	You gotta look at that as a red flag about his priorities.

Oh and this program is not advertised so if you want to know the name and info about it e-mail me.<br>  <br>  If his parents don't know and you decide to dump him you should tell them... it could save his life.|`|6e2eebd498466699a4ceb47740f7b7cfaa	Why would you subject yourself to that behavior? It will only get worse or stay the same, So if you don't like it now, you won't like it later. you should think about where this relationship is going. I am sure your relationship is not based on gifts or material things, but come on....that's ridiculous. i would NEVER last with a selfish turd like that. If you are going to stay with him, then do not question his actions. |`|7bb7def5791e75742a5d4105132faf16aa	So you have a boyfriend who buys weed! What kind of life do you expect to have with him? Or how do you see your life years from now?|`|9cpKYneZaa	Uh .... this is a sign of greater things to come.

All I can tell you is to follow your heart and choose the girl that you are the most comfortable with and are able to handle their downsides. <br>  <br>  However, if you are planning to choose Katie, I think you should give her some space or time a little so she can heal from her past relationship. |`|EGTNlfQRaa	Well who do you think about the most?<br>  <br>  If its both I would choose Genevieve because you don't get to see much of Katie and she should be staying single to recover from the breakup.

fTVU0sP1aa	Getting attracted to other persons even if you are already in a relationship is perfectly normal. However, only you can decide whether it's worth it to act on those feelings. If you pursue someone new, you run the risk of losing your current girlfriend, so it's important to think carefully about what you want to do. <br>  <br>  |`|bGFCVOqAaa	Nothing is the matter with you. If you find someone attractive or if you like someone, does not mean there is something wrong with you. You just need to figure out who is better for you, in terms of the future. <br>  <br>  Also, make sure you know both girls well enough, especially the new girl. If you feel really strongly about this new girl, then maybe you can tell your girlfriend that you need a break. This way, you can see other people without offically cheating on her.<br>  <br>    Then if you feel this new girl is the right one for you, go with her. Otherwise, go back to your girlfriend and tell her you have realized that she is right for you (without bringing up this new girl thing).<br>  <br>  Hope this helps-:)<br>  Take care and good luck!|`|rovxgyiRaa	You should be faithful to your girlfriend,it's not worth staying with her if you're going to cheat.It's human nature to be attracted to other people,just don't act on your feelings.<br>  <br>  Edit:Think of it this way,what would you want if she was in the same situation?|`|fqkjnLsjaa	NO.dont do it.<br>  !!!!!!!!<br>  |`|9HPeR2m8aa	give urself a couple of slaps in the face|`|xDOIoV2aaa	Depends on which one you like the most, if you like the other girl , just break up with this wonderful girl you're talking about. <br>  If you like the wonderful girl even more, then just leave the other girl alone.|`|Npnoohddaa	Clear your mind and decide who you like better....You cant just completely make your decision on a single attribute, decide who you like best and go for it...|`|4uAfr3uhaa	you actually sound alot like a boy i know but anyway why dont you make sure the girl you are starting to like actually likes you too then think about what you really want.|`|e9f0havBaa	I'd figure out which one is most important and who you'd have the better future with and go for her.<br>  <br>  :]|`|pYme3socaa	Look at the girl that means more to you and choose her|`|15eb8387d74986a6f6f9cf3828274860aa	Lust for females .|`|69032101d345cbf59949bd632699caf9aa	it's a test and you know the answer.... meditate...|`|Lf3it1VUaa	same with me i just love the other girl|`|41NyT8oPaa	Does this wonderful girl you're in a relationship with deserved to get hurt and broken hearted because of you, you're already in a relationship then why are you even thinking of someone else, it's not fair. Anyway only you can decide but be careful what goes around comes back around.

da3f31f0285fe3fe3296aa9f25dca37eaa	This is a very serious situation and it is not to be taken lightly.  Have you tried counseling?  Do you go to church?  If so have you spoken to your pastor?  You and your wife really need an intervention.  She really sounds confused and unsure of what she wants out of life.  Does she even want to be married?  If not, then you need to move on, if she does, then there are some things that she must get right and commit to doing and commit to refraining from.  I think the first step is to go to the Lord and ask for some wisdom in this situation.  The most important thing is you don't want to put the kids in the middle of this mess, and you really want to do what is right for you in the end as well.  Another important thing to remember is that you don't want to solicit the advise of all your friends and family.  That usually messes things up worse.  And you don't want to react off of emotion because that leads to an entire new set of problems.  I don't have the answer for you because it is not my life, it is yours and the decision must be made by you since you will live with the consequences.  I will pray for you and your family.|`|zv01EjTLaa	without trust a relationship cannot last|`|yhsi0sWzaa	get rid of her.|`|afedCNrlaa	I feel so sorry for.

Yeah you've got kids, but kids shouldn't grow up knowing that their father was a wimp and lived a life knowing his wife cheating on him.<br>  If she did all this stuff, don't stay.<br>  Maybe you'll get the kids, she isn't a good mother if she cheated on you.<br>  Hang in there, things will get better once you break it for good.|`|QP8LdPLeaa	your wife does not realize how well she has it, she has a loving husband and all she's doing is seeing all these men, she's so open with herself and she doesn't realize how she's expressing herself. according to that little voice message, i think your wife has another side to herself. she says mean about people and she does stuff behind your back. how many times are you going to keep giving her chances? you may have been really serious THIS time but still, how many TIMES are you going to put up with this? youre allowing her to do this to you. she didn't get the message the first time or second time. i think its time to let her go, she will not understand and she simlpy will not commit to you. whether you have kids or not, your happiness is important too. dont feel stuck just because you have kids, there is always a way out.<br>  <br>  i would not trust her anymore.|`|wpi36XBAaa	She's already got four strikes against her - the affair nine years ago, kissing your cousin, wanting to hook up with some random guy on the phone and now this affair? And they are just the ones you know about. <br>  If nothing has changed, what do you expect to change? She is who she is until she decides to get some professional help to break this pattern of behavior, and even that will only work if SHE sees this as a problem she needs to fix. You can't do that for her. <br>  What you need to decide is this sort of behavior good enough in your life?
n8lXItGraa	Getting on his case, though you mean well...will do more harm than good.  He needs to realize why he does this.  What is going on in his mind that drives him to purge.  It's a psychological problem, something deep seeded that maybe even he is not aware of.  He needs professional help to come to terms with his illness, and yes..it is an illness. Also you need to find out what actions you could take to support him.  It wouldn't hurt to post this in Mental Health Section of Yahoo! as there are sometimes professionals available that might give you and your husband some insight.  Try that, and I wish you both the best.  Be strong.   Hope this helps...|`|ZyK5fW2yaa	If you want to help him, try somethin like couples counselling, because it will include both of you and you will learn ways to help both him and yourself.

(Guys can be pretty bone-headed)  I would suggest keeping things light hearted and pleasant on your end, especially with your anniversary coming up.  If he is stressed out and resentful toward you the day before he goes, he will not look forward to coming home.  But if you choose to be the understanding, laid back wife, he will feel like the luckiest man alive, and look forward to making it up to you when he returns. <br>  <br>  Ask him if you can help him pack the day before your anniversary, so you can savor the day as much as possible.  He will appreciate the help and see that it means a lot to you.|`|AA11204355	he is coming back to spend a WHOLE week with the 2 of you.

Men sometimes are not very receptive to how women feel and don't even realize to what degree they have hurt their spouse by doing something that he doesn't think it a big deal.

Communication is the number one reason that a lot of marriages fail. If you do not know how to say it to him maybe you should just let him read what you posted. It sounds really inconsiderate to me that he would do such a thing. But then again, inconsiderate basically describes all males. Just talk to him. Calmly. Don't accuse. Just express how you feel. <br>  <br>  And you know what else? You should read Steve Harvey's new book: Act Like A Woman, Think Like A Man. Hope everything turns out well. :-)|`|9mQC5Vihaa	If you complain at him like your complaining at the rest of us on the internet, I'd need a break too. Let the man have a rest from you.

AA10407839	It just sounds like you gained some confidence through losing weight and getting better at school. There is absolutelty nothing wrong with that. It is a good thing for you and you shouldnt feel bad. Maybe the other guys are just jealous but they dont seem like very good friends.    Making friends with girls is easy, really. Just talk to anyone approachable or that you kind of already know about anything at all. Interests, hobbies, movies etc... sit with them at lunch, you know what you would do with normal friends.|`|LkfXCh3Zaa	Well well...congrats on changing for the better bet you feel more confident now huh? Well don't bother with those guys seriously not worth the time or effort. Now for your question for girls just go with the flow man go and just strike a conversation with one of them and start talking soon you can be yourself around them and take it  from there. No worries if it doesn't work out then move on to the next!! Good luck =)))
eGscNMTOaa	um because you want them to love you back of course.|`|MG1IVmvIaa	Because love is not based on how the other person feels toward you, normally hate comes from a past hurt and sometimes showing love to that person can heal the heart.

VSVQHKwKaa	Your grandmother killed the relationship. And you should have left the past in the past.     Men don't enjoy drudging up embarrassing situations. If he gave you an STD, it was a mistake and didn't require more digging.    So you have two problems to overcome:    1. You think talking fixes or solves or cures anything. The only thing it does, is satisfy your paranoid curiosity while driving your fiancee away from you. Not good!    2. You can't confide in your grandmother any more. If you do get back together with this guy, he gets a free pass to not see her or deal with her beyond the point of handing you the telephone. And all the relations between your family and him are going to be difficult.    Your grandmother was foolish. And you were foolish for not forbidding her from talking with him.     Solve those two problems, and you're good.    Good Luck!|`|BUET39wmaa	an std contracted before he met you?   what does that have to do with his love for you?  I hope the std is taken care of however if he is telling the truth and wants you that badly then why would you jeopardize that?  tell your gramma that he is a stand up guy and is telling the truth and if she loves you she will support you.  having an std doesn't make him a bad person|`|OBCvewW2aa	If he got an STD from a previous partner he should have informed you before sleeping with you.  If he was unaware, he's irresponsible with his health.  If he got it after he hooked up with you, he's a cheater.    Either way, the man burned you!  In my book, this is grounds for a serious beat down.|`|8ac2e5cbdd946ee60c803052559873c5aa	I think your grandmother is old enough to know better than to have gotten involved in your business and she needs to stay out of your life entirely.  Assuming you are an adult, go do what you choose and live with the consequences.  If grandmother is supporting you, get a job and move out on your own.    |`|EdidZdtlaa	usually they are right. atleast my family is.|`|8758df9720f7d094342fbcef3c91a629aa	It seems he doesn't want to talk about it with you because then he will have to be honest with you when he got the STD.  Come on you've been together for 2 years and got the STD 1 year ago, so either you two did not get it on for an entire year or this guy is not telling you the truth.  Simply put, it is time to move on with your life and trust your grandmother's knowledge.  Good Luck|`|KadJyjtBaa	FIRST OF ALL I WANT TO SAY TO ALL THOSE WHO ARE HERE AND WRITE DONT WRITE TO TALK CRAP AND MAKE STUPID AND IGNORANT COMMENTS.. KEEP IT TO YOURSELF OR DONT WRITE AT ALL.    In reference to your question I think its normal what you are feeling. But this is something to think about.. you got an STD and your fiance cant tell you what you want to know. Could it be that he is hiding something? Because when someone gets defensive its because they are hiding something or is keeping details from you.   I think that you need to build more trust in your relationship because what if the STD would of been HIV/AIDS ?   what is he going to say then? Thats not fair to you. i think you need to think about yourself and your health.   I just think its hard to believe that in 2 years he was with you he didnt know he had an STD.
M5oMYc9Laa	I have been through what you are going through and understand your situation.  Constant put downs, intimidation and invalidation is just not right, in fact, it is ABUSE.  You need to protect yourself.  I think you need to talk to them and yes... you need to cut them off for a while.  Every time they violate your boundaries you need to set them straight (in a nice way).  Let them know that as long as they insist on disrespecting you, you will have to keep your distance.  You must do this CONSISTENTLY.  I did it.  It was painful and took many years before they got the message but over time they finally got it.  Set firm boundaries and stick to them.  Let them know it is not okay to come to your home without asking first and that it is never okay to just drop by your job.  The more you do this the better you will feel about yourself.  Let them know that if what they are saying to you is not honest, kind AND necessary then it should not be said.|`|MdWaS1Hpaa	Your family should have a better attitude towads you, they should be bringing you up instead of down.. i'm not a doctor so i'd ask your theoripist..|`|0EkJQEV9aa	YOU HAVE TO BE STRONG! no one can take away your self asteem and even make you feel like you dont have any! my old teacher gave me some similar advice on the lines of that subject. she told me to always be strong and confident and foil the people giving me a hard time by knowing what a beautiful woman i am inside. she said to cowgirl up n kick some booty! you should do the same because it worked wonders for me and now im a positive happy person and people respect me for that. im sure that people would realize that confidence is not just looking like it on the outside but feeling it on the inside. good luck and god bless you.    hoped i helped.  erin|`|tutuKX5Gaa	My family was that way too and probably worse. They say family is thicker than blood and aventually you have to deal with and resolve your issues. For me i had to make up my mind that my happiness is more important to me then dealing with all their drama. Whatever they do that you find affensive you should just ignore it and hang around people that see the good in you,sometimes you just need to make them back off.|`|AA10199189	first of all things do not happen in a vacuum and there are always at least two sides to a story - trite but true.    you are likely an adolescent or a young adult.  you have not yet got to the point of independence but intellectually you know you are mature as well as smart.    emotionally however, you sound younger.  you are currently blaming THEM for everything.    ask them to give you space but acknowledge that you are one of the culprits, and try to resolve this within yourself before you tackle the externalities.|`|6ZxZoT7Raa	Yes; You need to tell them that you just need a little time to yourself right now and that your sorry  &  That your stressed out|`|CCqqTw6paa	YES, i used to keep my emotions to myself too, thought it was the manly option not to show any sort of emotion whatsoever.     i found out later on that method sucks, people don't know what your feeling about things and your really have the emotional sensitivity of a brick like that..     one day i just had enough of being fake and trying to please people, now i give people the shits and please myself. LOL life's too short to please everyone, im gonna enjoy every second i have on this earth    hope that helps|`|D3XQ5DoSaa	sometimes faking it is the best answer because if you give off confidence ppl with recognize it and then it will come more naturally to you. As for the family situation you have to make yourself realize that nothing will get you down, and nothing will stop you. Its all in your head. You have already recognized that you need help now you need to tell yourself what you love about yourself and accept who you are and who you will always be. Dont shut ppl out, if you bottle things up get a journal|`|2UjheafFaa	Everybody is self-conscious to some degree. And the inner-levels are in constant movement and fluctuation. It's embedded in out genetics. A lot of people "fake" confidence too. And you will probably never know that. I have a tactic of my own where, when I'm feeling more self conscious that usual, instead of concentrating on my social discomfort, I focus on others. Not the nicest sounding of tactics, but it does give me an 'instantaneous boost' of confidence and self awareness. You need to feel self aware and know what you are doing. Remember, every other human being physically senses the world as you do. They see with their eyes, feel their imbalances, and contain their own deepness, as you do. To feel the best about yourself, you need to identify what is most important to you in your life right now and your future, and you need to attack it without any bad influence. And yes, I cut people out of my life that are bad influences.     As far as your family in concerned, I would approach it from a safe, mature, and understanding standpoint. Let everything out and put it on the table. Tell your parents of what is important in your life right now, and see how they respond. If they respond with understanding and support, then you should keep them around. Life on Planet Earth can be a feeding ground sometimes. It's our instincts. Do what is right for yourself, you are a human being, like everyother on the world. Therefore, you are an equal. Nobody is better than you. Human emotion can sometimes be self-destructive and virtually all feelings like that are illogical (ie. jealousy, hatred, and feeling insignificant) It's BULLSHIT. In your head, you may feel less significant than others, but that's just some fantasy your mind made up. It's never true. That's why these feelings may be self-destructive for people who are not in understanding with their feelings.      We all have our lows. Just we all don't see everyone else's lows, so sometimes, through irrationality, we have a false sense of belief..    Your low feelings will pass. Eventually, your mind will 'click,' could be today.  When that happens, you will start feeling good about yourself. You'll having good and bad days instead of just bad. As more time goes by and as your mind matures, the good days will outnumber the bad days more and more. You just need to break the habit your in now. And yes, it is just a habit. Your mind is trained to act and feel the way it is now. That is the main principal of shyness, I don't believe the shyness is embedded in their personality completely, it is more of a habit, the way their used to acting. They can slowly break the habit by exercising against it. That is what you need to do. SLOWLY break your habit. Going for all the gold will be horrible. You need to force yourself to do it slowly. Just like medication, it never instantly fixes you. Just think of this as mental medication.     You will prevail.|`|1k6UUC8qaa	i feel for you i used to have an anxiety attack just being around my family.  i went to a good therapist once that told me people have different principles, ideas, and standards, and the people in your family are not going to exactly share yours.  i have kept quite a bit of distance from those who cause me lots of pain and i am occationally polite to them keep it short and sweet. Like you i don't always answer the phone only if i feel i want to deal with their drama.  My therapist also told me that bee keepers don't ever go into the bee hives without their protective gear that why do we insist in going out into the world with out ours she says that when i go around those who hurt me or make me fees unconfortable don't go without my protective gear be prepared so that they cant hurt you their opinion doesn't count anyways you know what they say you can pick and choose your friends but your can't pick and choose your family.  i really understand my therapist says that the worst thing is to be loved and abused which ever it may be mental phisical ect. because when someone does something bad to you and you or them don't feel love you can write them our of your life and erase them but when feelings are involved you experience all kind of guilt and pain you can do without.  I have been able to minimise the guilt and pain a lot.  I feel that someone who is part of your family don'st have a license to upset you  or torment your life not when you were little and not as an adult.  Don't feel bad by ignoring them they know what they are doing they just see that they can get away with it. I don't think other people worry about how you feel they go on with their life and your is interupted by mean words. thats why I know i'm wright and they are wrong so I look out for  1 me that way I don't have to deal with meds or therapist its called being happy, believe me Im sure you are a great person, you've done your best and if thats not good enough for some or in some cases too good for others too bad what matters is what you think and what makes you happy take my advice I rarely share about myself i don't want you in pain|`|qlaZpHnPaa	gotta put yerself out dare yung women. that's the key to life.

ZWEmPMsqaa	The best way to let your anger go is to talk to them like you mean it. I've been with people who refuse to talk about stuff like that, but if that doesn't work you have to let him realize the harm he is doing. Try to breath in and out and don't let this hang over you for the rest of your life its not good for you. Enjoy life, and Im pretty sure soon he would realize what he is doing to your family. I know how you feel but the best thing you could do right now is to concentrate whats going on inside your family and not to think about your brother. I know one day hes going to look back on this and regret the decision he made. Hope this helps!!|`|w3oVzM2Zaa	iit is very painful when a brother turns his back like that.Please dont be angry its a killer my mom had a heart attack a few weeks ago she was so hurt over her brother who has been married to a women who since came into the family ripped my mom and him apart.She is such a awful women my mom didnt like her I dont either.ofcourse they have been married for like 30 yrs so they have kids.Im close to their daughter.We didnt let the seperation betwwen her mom & my mom seperate us.my uncle (my moms brother) were so close when they were younger.my aunt(his wife) was making him chose between my mom & her.Because of the anger & hurt she was by him an my aunt she had this heart attack and now I am left w/o her.She died from that heart attack.Talk to him don let the anger get too much.I wish you the best!
jd5a3Pk5aa	So is your brother.  God be with him.  He has been traumatized to the max in his life.  I would think he needs some serious counseling in all aspects and this can take a very long time to even be able to like himself.  I would think, about all you can do for him is to let him know you are there for him anytime he needs you and to let him know that he is your brother and you love him dearly.   Perhaps some counseling for yourself to learn how to deal with this situtation would be good as well.|`|5qmcv083aa	I know this sounds cruel, but you can't help someone who doesn't want help.

I am the survivor of sexual abuse and can certainly understand some of the pain he is feeling. He was dealt a blow that no human being deserves and he needs all the love and support his family can give.

Good Luck.|`|pErRGYH7aa	I hope your mother is no longer available to the public for what she did to your brother.  He needs counseling, and his issues run so deep, he may want to consider inpatient counseling.  Most likely, he will never be able to have a normal relationship without years of intensive psychiatric treatment.|`|ecNeN0staa	WHOA.  He'll need continual therapy for the rest of his life.|`|GSEBCYeUaa	This is hard for you and your brother i can tell...You should really see someone about this.  They will tell you how you can help your brother with this.  You can also tell your brother how concerned you are about him|`|g1tidbsmaa	Try giving him love and show that u care don't be up in his bussines just show effection towardds him|`|bttrB0Rfaa	Think when you were kids, was there something you shared or you know he really got excited about back then? Even something stupid like throwing rocks at cans.   Come up with an adult version of it.   It would be great if, say, he liked going to Grandpa's & planting that tree with him. Then you could suggest he get a job as a landscaper of some kind. Or at least encourage him to do some gardening. Landscaping is just an example, but there's got to be something that can always bring a smile to his face.

gsS0c3yVaa	If it's about an affair, and you KNOW you are clean......DO NOT TELL!!!  You are only releasing your own guilt, but you will destroy her.      If it may affect her health like STD's or aids, then you must tell her.    I have been there and told.  It was the wrong thing to do!!!!!|`|2d0b79adb461559e1749c15161f778bcaa	You decided to have a life with this person.  You should be completely honest with her.  Skeletons come out of the closet eventually ... better you tell her then her finding out one day.|`|doM7kDUDaa	Im going with YES it is noble.  You should suffer with the secret and not pass down the pain to her,  she is not the one who did wrong.  Keep secret until your on your death bed    My opinion|`|da3764770f9d97db5463f7e509eac31caa	It depends if it's something far in the past that would only hurt her by knowing it now or something that could affect her at the present time and her well being and her life, then she needs to know now and you're not being noble even a little bit.|`|7fAHPUkkaa	loose lips sink ships|`|AA11990465	You know the saying, "what you don't know won't hurt you". I think it's ok to keep a secret if you are sparing her pain.|`|wpi36XBAaa	I find when one is lying to their spouse about "something that would hurt them" and that something is what they did, it's not for the sake of the spouse, but to avoid facing the consequences of one's own actions. If you believe that you are doing that for her sake, then you such a good liar that your even fooling yourself into believing your own lies!  If you truly cared for your spouse you wouldn't have done whatever it was that resulted in having "a dirty little secret" to hide.|`|CIlwfiU3aa	Noble...no nothin about a dirty secret is noble..    If you did something that would cause her that much pain than you are not noble...    Im not telling you to tell her..im just telling you your deffinatly not noble|`|7uB42JzJaa	yes it it is, you are just keeping from breaking her heart.  If you think your secret will cause pain then just keep it to yourself.|`|O36qjj7Oaa	No its a cowards thing to do.    Be an adult and be honest for once because there shouldn't be any secrets in a marriage.|`|wGw834Gkaa	If it involves the spread of STDs, no you are NOT being noble.|`|pJQd5Rxwaa	This is a joke right?|`|JkvlAVX2aa	Unless keeping the secret potentially subject her to a physical harm, why inflict unnecessary emotional hurt onto her by telling her???    If telling her only lessens your own emotional guilt, then you are worse than having done that dirty secret.    I'd say suffer the guilt of your own doing and let her live peacefully.|`|L38M9lrLaa	depends on what it is but honesty is the best policy
gfxXikenaa	you want her to stick to you always and you are insecure that if she went too much successful she might get some one better|`|RTa3g9ZHaa	I've had this before and yes it is jealousy. You love her but you want to do better than her. She's good at something, you go one better. she has something; you want it. It's hard to explain but I think it is jealousy, and you want to be the one who does better because you want her to look up to you and not the other way round. I've been through this and I would say it is perfectly normal; you'll get over it. Don't however set things up so that she will fail or do badly to make yourself look better, because it will only come back on you. (I'm not saying you will, but I just wanted to day it). Good luck with reaching the end of this stage, and I hope you get through it quickly.|`|Rnkewtiuaa	thats awful... but at least youre realizing that you're doing it. she deserves a guy who is going to wish the best for her all the time though. if you love her, you'll wish her the best.|`|2ieiGIhTaa	Probably because if she succeeds, she will get a boyfriend who is not such a loser.|`|4cc767b496173b3227cf5f9f17efd2b5aa	Mr. Limbaugh, you need some serious help.|`|IhZSaDXDaa	It sounds like you want to be the "Macho man"|`|9z0CpCR9aa	maybe you think is shes good at everything, other people will think wow shes amazing, and you maybe have a jealousy problem and think other males will think that about her? or maybey ur just insecure?|`|EK4NGPJMaa	I think your jealous.|`|xzJGhhN0aa	Yes you're jealous and you need to grow a pair and be man, not act like a little kid.|`|HchGJp3oaa	Your Jealous of her and want to be the dominate one..|`|82359ab5eb2bec5d95da9132c032f006aa	Jealous and dominant...not good traits to have for a relationship!!|`|91ACjB5eaa	because your a man.  you were made that way...you men like us to depend on you guys.  just make shure if your going to be that way, you are dependable.    but for gods sake don't tell her you want her to fail!!!!!!!|`|F2XxqlVfaa	ready for the real answer? i think you might just want her to come to you when she does fail. so that you can feel that theres something you might be able to help her with instead of her being so independent|`|XsSMIdBtaa	wow that's really mean1 but i feel that way towards my sis!    perfect grade,boys all over her, star athlete! ugh|`|oi2dEDuRaa	maybe its because u think tht she will want you because she will be depressed ans u want that|`|69b929d341b49df84c23149c7790163faa	well, you may have a little envy in you, only you would know that though|`|mZlPj8Guaa	Sounds like you both compete and you cannot stand losing.|`|wpkJFL5Qaa	hahahha, lol, ur normal don't worry but never ever ever ever tell her that, just keep it to yourself|`|pqholNyqaa	i think your an egoist and obviously you don't love her as much as you say you do. Andyes,  you're jealous!|`|JMPB5OO0aa	I wouldn't say you are jealous.  It's probably more along the lines that if she succeeds you are afraid she may leave you for someone better.|`|r8owV9esaa	i had that prob too. i dont like it when my ex bf does better than me cuz then i feel like im not worth his time.. but treally i dunno.. those are foolish feelings|`|AwAw0uiKaa	Hmmm... my husband thinks it's cute and sexy when I struggle with things, fall down, answer a question wrong, get confused.... he just thinks it's cute. Maybe it's an attractive quality she has? If you feel a strange satisfaction in her failure, maybe you have some insecurities that you think are made to feel better when you see her fail at something? If that's the case, I suggest you self-examine your motives and what you are thinking about when you see her fail.|`|ckcNNMkLaa	She deserves better than you.  Do her a favor and get out of her life.|`|TxV2DRpNaa	its obvious you have some self esteem issues, and deep seated envy of her. You think you are not as good at her in so many ways, and as long as she keeps proving your right, it breaks Your heart and confidence more, which in turn makes you bitter, angry and jealous. If you really love her, you will be proud of all her achievements in life, and maybe you could try harder at what you do?|`|DjircW6waa	Do you feel like she's smug and rubs it in when she does well?  It may be that when she's successful it makes you feel like a loser by comparison like you're not worthy or what does she see in you?  Or it might be that you like to console her after she does poorly because it makes you feel needed.  Either way, I hope you get to the bottom of it, because this is a serious obstacle to your relationship.|`|ML7FRVzIaa	Jealousy is a sickness|`|nMzzwrtUaa	Melanie is out if line that's not helping him at all.    Why you feel like that because allot of men feel like that once in a while, because they want there girlfriend, wife or best female friend to fail so they turn to us to help them. Men like to feel needed once in a while it makes up feel like we are needed and wanted. Just a normal thing for men don't think to much in to it, nor do i say make it to where she will fail once you feel secure that she will always need you in one way or another you will no longer have that feeling.|`|bg86ji6naa	Maybe she acts like she is better than you so you like to see her fail to compensate your feelings?|`|96zZlJVYaa	Yes that you're very jealous of her if she do better than you in smilier things. You can't stand for a woman who could do better than you and this is why you want her to fail so you feel good about yourself.     if you really love her as much as you claim there is no reason for you to think about her failing. You should be supported of her, so what she is better than you in some area. that is life, dude. If you can't support your girlfriend what kind of companion are you?|`|yc0gKBkwaa	perhaps you just want her to depend on you when she fails so that you can comfort her and make her feel better xox|`|0fVtHNtmaa	You're a sadistic a**shole|`|gqvvXknQaa	Sounds like you're just a very competitive person|`|eda1e3044f3b72caa810590b84628887aa	masochistic|`|0S92MwtJaa	LOLLL!! haha  thats kinda funny    maybe u want to be the winner in the relationship, the bigger person|`|z2OfsA0Jaa	lol|`|TWfuO1xoaa	you obviously have low self esteem - counselling may help or maybe get some hobbys of your own|`|DWCSDzo4aa	maybe you just want to comfort her afterwords?    or that you may be jealous?|`|hAmfmV2Baa	jealous.  its probably not just her  are you mad when other people do good/better than you|`|ccXJo7xUaa	Could be that you just want to be there to pick her up when she is down so you look like the good guy.    Otherwise, it could be that you just want to be seen to be more accomplished than her.|`|qZPZ2bTpaa	I think that you are worried about her getting bored of you and moving on.  It is okay, just try to realize that she loves you too.|`|4o0LfLjvaa	maybe you want to feel dominant... if your grades are worse than hers. but you should think about it... the better her grades, the better the job she will get and the better her life will be.|`|bttrB0Rfaa	You love her but feel the need to be superior to her?  Not the kind of love I would like to have|`|xgRJJbFRaa	It's the fact you love her so much, that you want her to experience everything life has to offer, and failing at something is one of them|`|l01yTPHWaa	I think you just feel that If u she fails in something, you want her to see how much you love her by making her feel better, and you like to make her feel better.|`|PEGZmw73aa	You like seeing others in pain possibly?    Sadism?|`|3kKlGfy7aa	you just make your self feel better when other people suck try talking to her about it!!!!!!!!!!!!!|`|hnnMVO39aa	You are probably just very insecure... she loves you or she wouldn't be with you! Be proud of her when she does well. Relationships are about helping eachother be the best you can be!|`|39pl2Dotaa	i think its you you want what she has|`|zO1eMt0haa	what it most likely is, is that fact that you want to be needed, you want her to come to you, because shes successful at everything, shes not coming to you for confort, its completely understandable.... no judge|`|pgfgzz5Jaa	i can feel the same way to at times but i don't let it get in the way i just stand by her side and support her with everything she does but i think its cause you want all the attention in the relationship|`|vNlyRmB7aa	You are jealous and intimidated by her success. It sounds like by her doing well, you feel like it is threatening your "manhood"...It also might be that you're afraid if she is successful, you will lose her because maybe you feel inadequate or not good enough for her.|`|wohGR1Nkaa	maybe because you fail at things and she suceeds at them then you want her to fail like you are.   Maybe?|`|d5348844fa0d0a525f373ae1f2bf3a78aa	maybe you're starved for her affection and if she fails you can console her and get some love yourself. i know after i fail at something there's nowhere i'd rather be than in the arms of someone who loves me in spite of doing badly at something.|`|GiHOnv54aa	Maybe you feel like she outperforms you in many areas of life. I can understand how you feel because I used to feel jealous of a friend of mine who always got "the guy" and her grades were amazing in everything, but I let it pass. Not only because I improved in all those areas but because she was my friend. Just try to find something you can do better than her, work hard at it and praise her for her achievements. Sometimes comparing yourself to others constantly is bad for your own self esteem. Be who you are - you're lucky to have a talented girlfriend  Smile  :)  X|`|kgUzdfqVaa	This is definitely an insecurity issue. You want her to do badly because that means she will not succeed - something which makes you feel worried about your future together.  You need to relax, and start learning to be happy for her. She's not going anywhere - but she might if she learns of your attitude!  The sooner you start seeing the pair of you as a team, the sooner you will start to support her and encourage her as you should.  Your competitiveness possibly stems from a fear that you will not succeed, and so you hate to see others do well - even when that person is your girlfriend. Not a good luck.  Just chill out, and try to change the way you view these things!|`|fMnM01isaa	Mabe cause she's just better at stuff than you are. What your feeling is just natural competition instinks that we all have. As long as you control them you should be fine. They say men should marry someone smarter than themselves, that way they are pushed to succeed in life.  So you could take advantage of your feelings and use them as a motivator.|`|4b5e829f99833cfe9aca6bd2c08e31b3aa	I know why..Probably it's because if she failed something, there's a chance that she would consult you on what she have done on that certain situation..And that would make your relationship stronger than ever..|`|sbZPsXk0aa	maybe sometimes you feel like you, as the guy, want to be the one winning sports or, getting good grades. Showing off to her and being manly etc    Or maybe you think shes a little bit up her own **** and needs taking down a peg :D    If you love her, and you feel like this, just so long as it doesnt get in the way just carry on regardless!! Be proud of your girlfriend!!! Just dont grow to resent her, please!    You could be jealous, but at least its not envy.    xxx|`|OapbXepjaa	Honestly i think it's a man thing.    You are the guy and want to be seen as the masculine can do no wrong type, can't blame you cause that's how all guys for the most part want to be received.    I think you feel this way because she does well at most she tries and if you fail you get a little jealous.     Back off a little get some activities you know you are good at and keep doing them to develop some confidence and maintain your masculinity and I think this feeling you have towards her will start to drop.|`|FFD8nfeVaa	idk|`|vh8YJH4oaa	Guys generally don't want girls to be smarter or stronger than them because they think that they are guys so they have to be the one being strong and smart. I think smart girls itimidate guys and make them feel useless.|`|PKR1xunDaa	it sounds like your jealous..|`|xxfwpJBdaa	Dominance or jealousy.|`|GxYCnNgDaa	your probably jealous or just want to see what happens if she fails for oncee|`|EIS3LqYZaa	Sounds like insecurity with a strong control issue going on...if you recognize that you have a problem..there is no excuse for why you don't seek help.  Love does not include the insecurity, control...or jealousy.|`|L1TaB0QTaa	your jealous and you envy her because she is better than you, it looks like you dont want her to be better than you. if you are a real bf and if you real do love her , than you wouldnt want her to fail|`|6lBWoKrgaa	Perhaps it's because you are insecure. Maybe you are afraid that if she beats you she won't treat you as your equal. Maybe you are scared of being inferior. Or maybe you are just competitive.|`|0LyFeRFraa	you probably want her to come to you crying so you can soothe her and give her comfort. You might just be jealous though|`|1c674c32f70abbba9b74d0e568421553aa	You feel inferior when she does well. You should look at improving how you feel about yourself. You need to be ok with it. Think about it this way she can be great and do some wonderful job and support you and you can be Mr. understanding boyfriend man who is so progressive because you let her pay the bills.
aJjV5b95aa	Both of those ideas sound really sweet. What do you think she would enjoy more? I personally would like the ice skating followed by dinner, it seems more personal and romantic to me, but it really depends on what she likes. I don;t think you can go wrong either way unless she does not like ice skating or a broadway show.|`|PogMq7Pcaa	awww sweet! i like ice skating better for an idea|`|OI3bf4yjaa	Ice skating in Central Park sounds very romantic. Do that.|`|jDArp8H3aa	i'd go wit the 2nd choice|`|zDqlHcGSaa	Ice skating, definitely!!!

If you were willing to go along with this long distance relationship then you should stop worrying about who is playing who grow the **** up. When being in long distance relationships it's hard to be faithful so just ask him how he feels about you and if he likes you like you think he likes you then stop worrying he is not playing you!!|`|JZP4dClVaa	no one but you will really be able to tell how much he likes you . it just depends on how he talks to you and if  he acts diffrent around you, personally i cant do long ditance relationships. i have to see the one i love ,.... or want to love, another thing is you dont want to try to change who he is to accomidate you thats a big no no. guys hate that and if he cant be him self around you then he is not the one for you. thats like starting a relationship and haveing him lie to you the whole time before you starting dating. but its completly up to you... just be careful|`|CPnrhK74aa	You can only find out by meeting him in person and getting to know him better in person. It sounds to me that he really does like you, but if you're that concerned about it, then ask him if he's interested in other girls and if you're the only one he likes....or you can also ask him if he's the type of guy that would stay single and wait for a girl like you, in other words, is he trustworthy, not a cheater, etc.
eiI99PF6aa	Get online and do a search for "Hostel" and the town/city/state you will be going to.       Pack a cooler with food and drinks so that you keep the overhead low.     Bring a small backpack so you can take lunch up with you on the Lift.  If the ski area has a lodge up the mountain have lunch with a view.      Just remind each other that this trip is about celebrating the relationship you have and that being together and doing something fun is what matters the most and spending money unnecessarily will only bring the moments together down.
a3422bad6666b60894e80bace0f14387aa	At someone's home or a fun restaraunt would be ideal. You can have a light lunch, a BBQ, all-appetizers buffet or something with a theme (Mexican, Sushi, whatever she likes!). It's a party so you can decorate with crepe paper, balloons, etc, in the wedding colors. Go with whatever fits your budget.     Good luck!|`|sGP6s7uraa	Do it at your house or go to a restaurant and reserve a private room.  Do a bruncheon or dinner followed by dancing.  Be sure to ask her what SHE wants or would like to do.
4cQKBkqCaa	Run the other direction! If you have nothing in common if you're not flat on your back, it is not a good relationship!!|`|F3LBgfvwaa	Leave him. Don't let your hormones control you. We're not animals.|`|hazucBxbaa	yeah deff leave!! ur heart is more valuable then sex!!!! it makes no sense to stay cuz when the sex dies where does that leave u???|`|853fd2c5ba7e089875fdc909f31d8bd9aa	That's a tough one, but think of it this way...semi-prostitution?  Try friends with benefits, don't have to deal with all the emotions and title of a boy/girlfriend and just screw each other and walk away with no strings attached on a daily basis.
4cQKBkqCaa	Ickk that's a tough one. I think he's only mad that both things happened so close together and either one on it's own isn't that bad. Remind dad that its' a progress report, not a final grade and you will work on pulling it up ASAP. Even do extra credit if the teacher will let you. As far as the ciggies in the car, make sure Dad knows that you don't smoke, that you don't come home smelling like it, etc. And make sure you tell him all this calmly and rationally becuase if you get upset and fight he might think you are just trying to cover your lies. If you are telling the truth you have nothing to hide or lie about.     good luck|`|M4eefVjLaa	my dad is the same way. You can't reason with dads usually. He's just trying to look out for his daughter. Just ask him why he doesn't trust you. Good luck.
JiUwpYSXaa	You didn't indicate much about his drinking habits,  Alcoholism is progressive & I completely changes peoples perception of things.  If he is drinking I recommend you you go to an alon meeting.  I drank heavy for 10 years and must have a terror in my house.  I went into rehab, joined AA and believed in a higher power and with time things got better.  That doesn't mean that we go to church.|`|VSVQHKwKaa	You know what churchy people and drunks both enjoy?    BBQ's!!    So throw lots of BBQ's!!    That way everyone can mingle.    But even more than that...letting him off the leash isn't a bad thing. Just remind him that he's got a warm, willing wife waiting for him in bed at home.    And when he gets home, just treat him really special. Things will work out.    Good Luck!|`|8ac2e5cbdd946ee60c803052559873c5aa	You admit that you have changed and you are expecting him to move your way.  It doesn't usually work like that--it didn't for me and I divorced when I couldn't handle his life-style and didn't want to rear my child around it.    If he isn't an alcoholic, though, you might form a compromise.  Sometimes, be around his "drunks" and sometimes he hangs around your "churchy" people.  Good luck.|`|MG1IVmvIaa	Begin everyday praying for your husband, then begin to be the godly wife that God intended you to be.  Through you, your husband will see the difference.  This might take years but stay faithful.  There is a great movie out right now called Fireproof (ava on dvd)  talk him in to sitting down and watching it with you.  Also share this burden with the people at your church that you know have a serious walk with the Lord.  I have seen many rough old guys become great men for God being brought to church by thier wives.|`|dRj9FoHzaa	The problem is caused by you two not spending enough time together and once each of you adopted the space and time you have in your hands, then you no longer need each other as much as before.  In order to reconnect, you will have to start to do something together again in order to remind each other how good it felt.  Don't become each other's shadow right away.  Do it slowly and at beginning do something both of you can enjoy or at least can tolerate in order to rebuild the connection.|`|IuJjYz6gaa	It sounds like you both are a bit guilty.  You are spending so much time apart, it's no wonder that you are growing apart.    Start by having a heart to heart talk with your husband, tell him that you feel distant from him and why.  Spend more time together, even if it's just at home.  Stop spending so much time with other people.    Oh, and watch the movie Fireproof.  I promise you'll like it... I forced my husband to watch it with me Sunday night and he was moved to tears.
Qhw8TGSNaa	Friends are supposed to make you feel happy and comfortable with yourself. It's okay to joke with your friends, but not when it gets to the point when they do it constantly. Jokes are supposed to be funny and not hurtful. Even though you already mentioned to them how it bothers you but they still do it behind your back, they are not good friends. I would definitely dump them and make new friends. Don't worry, you will find other friends that are great and won't make you feel sad all the time.|`|cPpP4BZIaa	THIS DOESN'T SEEM LIKE THE ACTIONS OF A TYPICAL ASIAN FEMALE. YOU NEED TO CONTINUE BEING FRIENDS. I THINK THEY LIKE YOU , AND JUST LOVE TO TEAS YOU.|`|w1bgyng3aa	Tell them how you feel again and if they dont except it and keep doing it get some new friends and show them that when your not loyal to a friend it hurts in the future because you loose that friend.............hope this helps.....-Mrs.Teribassi|`|vupWa0eXaa	I dont think you haev to stop your friendship jsut because you gusy cant agree on which resturant to eat or watever. but you need to tell them how you feel, and that they woudltn liek it, if they were in ur shoes. if they laugh at you, and continue to make fun of you, you need to fidn otehr friends.|`|yEHdJwVGaa	just think about it before u decide. but, i truthfully u should stop hanging out with them because they're being jerks to u. but, if u rly want to stay friends with katherine, talk to her alone bout it and see wat happens (idk if u want to take this answer, cuz ur talking to a younger teen) i hope i helped!|`|Ejp91kLeaa	They seem like jerks! You should do the same thing to them and see how they like it!!!! I know that that's just stooping down to there level but they need to be straightend out. You should'nt be treated like that. No body should!!!!!! They are not your real friends.|`|CPGMIcEoaa	sounds like the typical asian girls...many act all stuck up. I am sorry to hear that but you need better friends that will not always hurt you!   These are not true friends if they are racist liket his all the damn time. So I suggust you find some other friends possibly hispanic or white. but wtf, don't let yourself down...I would so call them cha-ching(k) haha when they call you out like that. There are so many other names to asian out there...one starts with a F and another a Goo...But i'd hate to get kicked off. Anyhow best of luck with your so-called "friends" if you continue to be friends with those flat...ties.|`|1cc45714beafef23459d79e852dec489aa	When friends joke around it should not be hurtful.  I also have a problem with the racial undertones of the jokes.  Sometimes when people are in a group they tend to do things they would never do if they were alone.  Obviously, they tend to gang up on you and this is not fair and you are no one's punching bag.  The fact that you are new in college gives you a great oppurtunity to meet new friends.  Don't be afraid to find new people to hang out with because one day these so called friends will be in the past, where they belong.
9ae557afae8c72a2f03fc0f5b4f78564aa	I'm sure your heart was in the right place, but for many people the funeral is not the part they want to remember (I am one of those people), however I don't think anyone should be mad at you. I don't think this was an appropriate Christmas gift, but you sound like a nice person. I think they are over reacting. In the future, you may want to ask people how they feel about these kinds of things before you go to all the time and trouble.|`|FwJLD1uDaa	aww :(    i think they just miss him. it might not have been the best idea because they werent over their loss quite yet. i think as a christmas present thats pretty morbid, but as something to keep for yourself and show sometimes, thats fine. good luck and just tell them you didnt mean to be rude.|`|82359ab5eb2bec5d95da9132c032f006aa	It sounds pretty whacked to do that!  I mean the pics and the music were a nice gesture, but not the funeral part...that is something people do not need a remembrance of...his life should be enough!|`|e5f4c192231c92a0d059825b151f7553aa	Well, some people do want the funeral to be taped or photographed.    Where this went wrong is probably that you did not ask if people would appreciate receiving this - as it can be very confronting.    So, small mistake, but emotions get involved so things get blown up.|`|lC1VVt96aa	You did a fantastic heartfelt tribute to someone you apparently thought a great deal of.  The ones who have been critical are the insensitive clods who do not recognize the actions of a true friend.  All of us would be fortunate to have a friend like you.  I truly admire what you did.|`|55e3858ec5337970fbef5876fc1e5fe0aa	Ok ..that one beats the 2,000 travel photo-slide show presentation.    Not something I would have done.|`|nXombf2baa	I'm a Funeral Director. I have had many people video tape the entire funeral service for a loved one. I don't see any problem with this. I don't know about sending it out as a Christmas card, many people can't handle it. I think I would have let people know that you have the funeral on DVD, and you would be willing to send them a copy, if they wanted. There are professional companies that do this type of service for families who ask. I'm sure you had the best of intentions, but some people will always find fault with it. If you have relatives who were not able to attend the service, this is a great thing to be able to send them. My condolences on your loss, and I hope that this incident doesn't sway you from doing it again if there is another death in your family|`|JaNE0HKyaa	Why would you do that at a funeral? That is just wrong in so many ways. I don't even understand why people take pictures at a funeral. Don't do that any more. YES it was WRONG|`|4b05bb4486f2461ecde8bbc13899981daa	I think you should have asked first if people closest to your cousin wanted it taped and if they wanted a copy. To send it without asking if someone wanted it was insensitive.|`|jd5a3Pk5aa	Don't think that should have been done.  It would be like reliving the funeral all over again, every time they saw it.  I think the persons funeral should be where it stops.|`|8sVpAO2yaa	While I do not think it was "wrong" to tape the funeral, I think you should have asked before you sent it to other family members. Everyone does not handle death of a family member or loved one in the same way. You chose to handle your grief in a way that made you feel positive about the event, others may not be to that stage in their grief. In time, the video may be a treasured gift but, not something everyone wanted to remember at Christmas! I would have to say it probably shocked some people that were not ready to relive this sad time, even if it was presented in love. So, possibly the timing was wrong, not the video.
ILFeu7Oyaa	i was hurt pretty bad..<br>  i was with my ex for about 2yrs we broke up as i just wantin to be out with my friends more than i wanted to be with him everyday..at this time i was 16/17yrs old...3weeks after breakin up with him he got with 1 of my best mates who we used to go out with her and her boyfriend the 4 of us...which broke my heart and made me drink loadz and loads..then found out she was preggars with his bby which made me feel worse..but the young minded person i was..he came running back to me and after awhile we got bk togeva then went out on my 18 birthday and right in front of my face he snogged my best mate at the time, which made me go mad!!...there alot more to it than that but that wuld be like writing a book...im 19 now and have only stopped loveing him....i just think its strange how ppl can treat u this wait yet you still take them back....x...|`|ZCq2Y26waa	no, sorry for the inconvinient answer, but you never said you wouldn't accept nos. soz|`|QGv8ngfeaa	Sigh.<br>  <br>  Our definition of love changes and grows with us. I think I've been in love twice. Once was a puppy love, and the second was my last relationship, years ago. I have not dates anyone since than, I don't think I'll ever get over it.<br>  <br>  We met online, and hit it off fantastically well. He was the kind of man who really changed my perspective on life. He taught me to be more aware of the world. After dating him, I knew exactly what I wanted out of life. I knew what I wanted out of school. Out of relationships, out of men, out of my family. <br>  <br>  He also taught me the kind of things that can only be learned by trial an error. How to handle a relationship, what's important, what you can give and what you shouldn't compromise on... that kind of stuff.<br>  <br>  He was the leader throughout the whole relationship. He asked me out, he initiated conversation. He asked me to have his baby, he begged me to be with him after our first break up. Then suddenly he dumped without explanation. When I asked him way, he only said "You just can't understand because you don't want to." You can imagine the devastation. <br>  Months later he admitted that he just didn't want to tell me the real reason. I wont say what it is because its stings. I will say that it was for a VERY stupid trivial reason. <br>  <br>  I think I cling to the relationship because I still feel like we're perfect for each other, and that if he could just grow up and be a little bit more mature about life, than maybe we can have things perfect again, the way they were meant to be. I don't feel like I could find anyone like him he was a very unique guy, for a very unique girl. <br>  <br>  Anyways, hope this is what you were looking for.|`|RnHDnSgPaa	I love your question because it makes me think back a couple of years ago...<br>  <br>  Yes something did change my life, very dramticaly and i think that if he or it hadnt happened. My, who i am would be very different.<br>  <br>  At 14 I was a pretty good girl, didnt drink do drugs had a stable family and was loved had good friends.I met a guy in highschool he was atually asain.. but me growing up with an asain step mom we got along really good.<br>  <br>  I fell in love with him, he was so perfect for me, He was my first time, and the first person I ever really cared for.. We were together for around 5 months and out of no where one day he says we need to break up because we were fighting to much * we were not fighting that much*!! I called him for 2 weeks crying my heart out asking him to take me back and he said no, i then hooked up and made out with another guy! JUST MADE OUT. a week later my boyfriend wanted to take me back.. so ever though he hurt me so bad i wanted to be with him! i accepted but didnt tell him that i had kissed someone else.. after a day of me and him being together he found out that i had kissed someone else and he left me then again. i couldnt take it! we were broken up and it was just a kiss...<br>  <br>  aftter he broke up with me again i was devastated for months crying everynight wanting to commit suicide (lame i know)... i start hanging out with the wrong people, and my friend introduced me a to a boy that was 21 at the time. he did alot of drugs (  coke) for instants and i start getting into it. he then became my boyfriend.. at 15 i had a 21 year old guy. :0<br>  <br>  at 15 i became a coke head, dropped out of school and ran away for two months...<br>  <br>  i didnt know who i was and what i was doing, i became pregnant and i was too scared to ever go home,<br>  <br>  i stayed away for about 4 months, having to go through an aborotion all by myself, livining in peoples homes... finally after 4 months i went home, i was behind in school, lost all my friends, and had to do homeschool to graduate on time!!<br>  <br>  i have recovoered and would never go back to any of those drugs!!! i am so glad i am out of it,<br>  <br>  i am 18 now! and probabvly have been through a lot more then what people think when they look at me <br>  <br>  crazy.
hMZQd7Cpaa	Well i think you shouldnt do anything. But if you wanna move in Florida-Precisely Miami theres this school MaterAcademy & its great. You shouyld try going to it. If you dont find that good enough for you then go to L.A & find a good school there. Or If you dont wanna move away from your family go to NewYork theres great oppurtunytties there (:|`|qFiWcJogaa	Try talking to school officials they might be able to set you up with something. also get on line and search student exchange programs
JPBh5WT3aa	For my Grandmother that turned 90, I took some of her favorite photos of the grand kids.....and brought them to Office Max......and made a calender.  I also wrote birthdays, anniversaries and such on them so she could keep up.    Coincidentally, my cousin had the same idea.....and got a calender....except she used very old photos of our late grandfather....and our grandmother as a child growing up.      She loved both equally....and was proud to display them.|`|55e3858ec5337970fbef5876fc1e5fe0aa	Close up large 8x10 photo ... Grannys love pictures...|`|ubucYQhQaa	Maybe something that shows her role in your life.  A photo album or home movies converted to DVD?  My grandmother is an older lady who has health challenges, and really likes to read cook books.  Maybe if your grandmother has interests from the past, you could bring some of that back for her.|`|P9C6VTseaa	What about a photo album full of memories of the two of you from your birth to present day? Maybe include sentimental quotes about grandmothers and family. You could write comments next to some of the pictures or memories of the two of you. I would definitely include an inscription a the beginning of the album, expressing your love for her and wishes for a happy 90th. She'll know you put a lot of thought and effort into it!
Qhw8TGSNaa	You're definitely not overreacting. These people seem fishy to me. I would cut ties with them.|`|dPULl5hjaa	Definitely, messed up big time.  Cut ties with pathetic people.    Move on and enjoy life!
6ZxZoT7Raa	It is normal, he is just very sensitive  All you really can do is try to ignore him and maybe draw with him or something and do something that he likes to do and that will bring you closer as brother and sister :)|`|0bYcYz2jaa	It sounds like he's a bit odd.  The stones and lizards and ghosts and stuff is fine, I would worry about his inability to take any kind of criticism.  It seems like he needs to deal with people more often to learn to deal with disappointment and understand that just because you may not agree with him or enjoy the same things doesn't mean you hate him.  Maybe he could join the Boy Scouts or something like to get him out and about with other kids.|`|FwJLD1uDaa	maybe he is just different. i dont think hes mental, but the tv he watches is not suitable for his age. make him watch sports or cartoons. dont let him watch stuff like that. my little sister watched those shows for a while then got spooked and i told her to stop. she looks up to me and listens to me, so ever since she stopped, she has been into normal stuff like my makeup and i even bought her a diary so she could express herself. good luck :)|`|ZAqlySc1aa	I dont think theirs any problem with him all he needs is love...|`|ecNeN0staa	He'll probably grow up to be a hair stylist or fashion designer.|`|mzhETLVDaa	Its not for you to judge. Ask your mom to take him a doctor, and tell her why. Maybe she has an answer but emphasize on a doctors visit|`|g1tidbsmaa	Well don't start to stress ur self mabey he will grow out of it mabey or it is just a phase
AA10942089	It's probably hard for her to call and text and she's on her hands and knees all the time.|`|EevMUAqJaa	No, they don't. This happened to me, and the guy wound up splitting up with me. Ouch.    I'd give her a little more time or suggest that you to go out on a date or something to liven things back up. That's all you really need to do.|`|JV0i77uiaa	She probably likes you, but she does not wants tobe close or get involved.  You have to back off.  Relationship is suppose to go forward on improve not go out.  Maybe she is tire of talking in the phone for too long.|`|47puykLGaa	she is scared and doesn't want to get hurt she does like you but doesn't know if she should give you a chance|`|Ba4dBwWnaa	she's just not into you. you mus tbe a mean disrespectful selfish guy. there are alot of guys out there like this.|`|gqvvXknQaa	Yes... The beginning is normally called the "Honeymoon Phase"... She probably got comfortable with your relationship and doesn't feel the need to be intouch with you 24/7|`|lJAaBmlyaa	Yeah after about 4 months it's probably nothing personal it's just you start running of of stuff to talk/text about|`|Djnl92vXaa	no. not usually. she sounds bored, and I don't blame her    I would probably get bored if all my relationship consisted of is texting and chatting on the phone.|`|0fVtHNtmaa	calling and texting gets old.   She may just be bored of it in general.  Nothing against you.|`|A02BYDJxaa	Maybe she is just busy at the moment.  If she is cool with you when you do speak and meet up I don't think you have anything to worry about.  If you are still worried you could tell her how you feel, maybe she doesn't realise.  Hope this helps!!|`|qkeT8NQAaa	I had the samme problem. Ive been dating my boyfriend for a year, and it just depends. when we arent happy with eachother or something is wrong or were sick of eachother, the texting and phone calls die down. After we take a day or two to just be without eachother, then everything is fine. so just giver her space and dont keep texting and bothering her. Let her come to you! Good luck!|`|ae8d19d6c14e636d7d1c56de18f7c3a5aa	No worries, she's comfortable now and feels secure with you that's why she's slowed down on the calling and stuff.  What happens is that you probably got use to the calling and now that she does'nt do it as much it feels weird to you.  It's all good.  She still loves you!|`|11vkZiVsaa	i agree with the person below me shes probably getting bored with the situation. Im not saying go have sex or anything but you should deffinatley spice things up a bit. And don't forget the little things like telling her shes beautiful and you love her but don't overwhelm her or make yourself seem obsessed.     P.S i've been goin through this with my boyfriend for the past few weeks too and we've been going out for 4 months. I have my days i just wana go back to when it was easier and just be single and then theres other days i wouldnt want to be any other place than with him. We had a big falling out and i almost broke up with him it was soo bad but i couldnt because i love him soo much.   Long story short just make sure you talk to your girlfriend about how your feeling and make sure you give her time to just have fun with the girls or do something on her own occasionally.      (: hope that helps a bit & goodluckk!
K2dv9u7baa	I think he may just be treating you more like a friend but he does display some flirting. Tell him that you like him after he and his gf break up|`|gfxXikenaa	sounds like he's a playa from what you said|`|iIOJxjvUaa	he sounds just like a player or flirt to me epically if he has a girlfriend i doubt he likes you, i'd steer clear|`|lcXBO7Smaa	ask a friend of his, and he might jsut be doing it because of your reaction. example, i have no interest in this girl but i do similar things just because she goes bonkers and its funny|`|JZP4dClVaa	all in all it sounds like to me that he might be trying to impress his buddies and friends , he sounds pretty imature so he probably hangs out with imature people so im just going to assume that ha doesnt like you, and i could be wrong so if you want to ask him if he likes you go ahead. just start talking to him one day and ask him why he is always flirting with you and see what he says, let him know that you like him.|`|PogMq7Pcaa	wow    what grade r u in? 1st? cuz thats a lil' first grade|`|3y0w1qIBaa	If he has feelings for you rather than his girlfriend, then he would break her up and be with you.|`|UmidemI6aa	He is probably just a flirt.  If he liked you, he wouldn't call you ugly even though he was just kidding.|`|nKU4BDfaaa	Probably he seems to.  Just ask him! What do you think will happen the world will Blow up? Just ASK!!!!!
EE9F6q3Jaa	trust me, the best advice is your sisters advice.  do not talk to her.  she is not worth your time  she's not a good friend for ditching you, i know it hurts to let go of things, but you're better off without her.|`|e5f4c192231c92a0d059825b151f7553aa	You sister knows you.  Follow her advice.|`|3y0w1qIBaa	No, I think you should not do it because she ditched you for her personal gains in the past.  If you keep being her friend, she will most likely to continue the pattern.  I had a friend who ditched me so many times and it was time for me to realize that I shouldn't be his friend at all.  If you really value this friendship a lot, then take a risk, but be prepare to expect the unexpected.
hMZQd7Cpaa	Get him a love bracelet. Or a neclace. Or a perfume!|`|tjeVygG5aa	ok im not a guy but I had that trouble just a while ago! I've known my boyfriend for over 2 years and have been going out since september. I've never had a boyfriend during any holiday that you give gifts or birthdays. Well christmas came around and his birthday is the day after.    I ended up getting him a black light (which he told his best friend he wanted), a key chain he had wanted for a long time, and a really nice new pocket knife.      You just need to know what he likes. If he collects anything or really into any games or activities and such go with that.    Plus as long as its coming from you he'll love it and show it off or tell people about it!     Good luck|`|uRHVCvNPaa	get him a pair of UGGs CLASSIC SHORT CHESTNUT boots. my g/f (we are both 14 too) got me a pair for xmas. at first i wasn't sure bout wearing them but once i did try em on and wear them i've been wearing them ever since.i wear them barefoot and they keep my feet warm.UGGs were originally made for guys and they wore em after they got done surfing. my style is skater so it fits right in.i like em so much im getting the UGGs CLASSIC SHORT CHOCOLATE boots next.hope this helps.
9624d1b569ca710536d56a309ae51f7aaa	As a Dad... I would want to know that my baby girl is going to be happy and well provided for, that she will be protected and loved for the rest of her days.  Does you Dad really know that all of this is possible between you and your boy friend?  Communication is essential. You can not expect him to guess or go on a feeling. Talk to him from the heart.    Be realistic in your expectations of both your Dad and of your boy friend.

This is one of those times.|`|zLKsBm1Uaa	Have a heart to heart talk with your dad.  You are still his little girl and he wants the best for you.  Convince him that your boyfriend is what you want.and that you will always be his daughter.|`|AA11138696	You have a talk with him and let him know this is the guy for you and that you would like to have his blessings and to walk you down the aisle.  If he will not give his blessing you have a choice to not marry or do it without his blessing.      You might take a listen if he has any legitamate objections to the guy like hes a drug addict or something.  You can assure him that you will not vanish from his life but in the end you are an adult and parents are supposed to let their children go when they are grown.  Then  since you are grown, aren't you?, you will go and do what you need to for your life.
7uB42JzJaa	You've got to be kidding!!|`|A9q3h6Lyaa	totally inappropriate behaviour.what a disgusting woman. no matter how old you may have looked, i'm sure she knew how old you really were. hang on a second. are you sure this is true because your new recall of something that you apparantly had suppressed is very detailed. you're not just trying to get us women all sympathetic to you are you? i can't remember that many details about movies i saw last week let alone when i was 10.|`|13LqodO7aa	whats the question  O and nice story|`|ZadOtSlOaa	Extremely inappropriate, and I don't know if that day "had a bad influence" on you. Probably not, since she didn't physically molest you, but it's still real f-ed up so if you have some sexual issues it might be because of that.|`|qXJnNelsaa	Yes she was definitley wrong in watching that movie with you.  It is completely inappropriate to watch something like that with a young child.  It is perverted.  She had no right to explain anything about it to you either and her explanations are disgusting to tell a young boy that.  I wouldn't worry about it now that you are older and nothing actually happened, but it is with out a doubt totally inappropriate what she did.  And don't feel like you did anything wrong because you didn't!|`|a9OwtN7faa	Yes she did something awful!   I think that she violated a line that should not have been crossed.   I guess if you had stayed around maybe it would have lead her to something further like trying to seduce you.    You were very innocent and had 0 clues as per her intentions but let's put it this way..., lets say you had been a girl and she a man in his late 30s and the same scenario had happened do you think it was wrong? I do!  thank God that it did not go any further.    lots of luck to you.|`|pALAoZSKaa	YES IT WAS INNAPROPRIATE!!! GOOD GOD! Showing porn to a little boy? Thats awful.|`|GSEBCYeUaa	what she showed you would be considered porn, but you didn't do anything wrong she did.

AA10065812	??All Christians, even with a properly trained conscious, has to deal with urges of some type, whether it be the urge to drive to over the speed limit to get to work, or being attracted to someone not their spouse.  They are both the same.  It's a matter of a choice.  Choosing to commit a willful sin or not.  With a properly trained conscious, one learns to avoid temptation.  Unfortunately, too many self professed Christians lack this, or choose to ignore it, thinking that all they have to do is ask for forgiveness and the slate is clean.  <br>  <br>  Yes, Christ who was the Lamb of God died for our sins, but for over 1000 years prior to that, the sacrifice of the lamb in the Temple was for the forgiveness of the sins of Israel, yet Moses was denied access to the Promise Land due to just one sin.  And a minor one to be sure.  So, can anyone say they are more deserving of the Promise than Moses?|`|0KLu4hRaaa	Christian men are not immune from temptation or sin.
