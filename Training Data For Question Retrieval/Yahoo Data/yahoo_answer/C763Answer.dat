gY61GJu6aa	I'm not a professional baker, but i like baking cupcakes and muffins. I think whats wrong is the temp of your oven... its a bit high. Also, if u r using a cupcake pan --- leave a spot and fill it half full with water. The water will add moisture to your cupcakes while baking them.|`|1CdLseXbaa	It's just dry. Lol.|`|92kDhDcMaa	Two things.<br>  <br>  First, the little fan probably indicates that you have a convection oven. When this icon is displayed, you'll probably hear a breezy noise in your oven while you bake... this circulates the heat around the oven to cook things more evenly. It's important to cook at a lower heat when using convection... 25 degrees less usually does it pretty well. (For example, cook at 325F if the recipe calls for 350F.) Either that or turn that option off.<br>  <br>  Second, are you using paper liners? Your cupcakes will be a bit harder without them.
cEuuj70Eaa	Have you ever made drunk chicken?  My dad is a Master at making this.  Every Saturday we all would gather at his house and he would pull his HUGE bbq grill out.<br>  <br>  Take a chicken, rub the inside with butter then crushed garlic (under the skin too.)  Light salt then pepper.  Then take a can of beer, pur out a third of it for yourself, then shove the beer can (2/3 full!) into the cavity of the chicken and stand it on a aluminum pan.  (The chicken will look like it is standing)  Grill this at med high heat ...I think 2 hours will be fine.  Chicken is done when a light poke into a joint shows no pink juices.  We always have this with whole garlic (Take big cloves, score the top, put in foil, drizzle a little olive oil then place in bbq for about 20 minutes.  When done, take a clove and squish onto bread or into yuor mouth.  You may smell garlicky but I tell you what...great way to keep mosquitos away!!   Onions can be done the same way. )<br>  <br>  We also have a huge fruit salad with what ever is fresh and available.  With the grill hot we let the kids roast marshmallows and let them make s'mores.  We make a  huge vat of sweet tea but if more people show up we make a huge bowl of punch with a bottle of sprite (or 7Up), a container of what ever flavour of sherbert we pick up, ice and cut up fruit.  You did not specify if you wanted alcholic or none alcoholic beverages.<br>  <br>  Another yummy quick dessert the kids love to decorate is take a piece of foil, lay a banana in it sliced open (with skin still) then fill with all kinds of stuff.  M&M's, mini marshmallows, sprinkles, pineapple, cherries, chocolate, etc.  Then wrap and place in hot grill for about 5 minutes.  Then dump into a bowl with ice cream.  Even my g'ma had fun decorating her 'Nana!!<br>  <br>  Hope any of these are helpful!!  Feel free to ask me any questions by email.

German potato salad is unique because it doesn't use mayonnaise,  it's a little sweet, bacon is a key ingredient, and it's often served warm.  <br>  <br>  2. Russian potato salad is creamy, colorful, and delicious, made with a combination of mayonnaise and either sour cream or Mediterranean style yogurt, peas, carrots, gherkin pickles, and if you'd like, you can add beets and fresh dill.  <br>  <br>  3. French potato salad is elegant and savory with white wine or champagne vinegar, fresh tarragon, garlic, and dijon mustard.  <br>  <br>  4. Potato salad from Peru, where potatoes are said to have originated, can be made with a variety of potato types and colors. The sauce is a creamy bright yellow blend of mild cheese, half & half cream or evaporated milk, and turmeric, which gives it its color.  <br>  <br>  5. Japanese potato salad is light and crunchy, with cucumber pieces and rice wine vinegar mixed with mayonnaise. For a heartier salad, add diced ham.<br>  <br>  For drinks I would serve homemade lemonade  as it can be sipped on its own or spiked with a splash of gin, vodka, bourbon, or rum.|`|bn8OZrYSaa	I love it with Baked beans<br>  Potatoe Salad<br>  Regular Salad<br>  Bean/Pasta salad...with oil<br>  Corn on the Cob<br>  Fruit Salad<br>  Deviled Eggs<br>  Mac and Cheese<br>  GreenBean Casserole<br>  <br>  Leomonade<br>  Fruit Punch|`|M9RJLpqEaa	For side-dishes you could have corn on cob and baked potato,tabouli,macaroni,coleslaw is great too...<br>  for drinks : lemonade,soft drinks,juice...<br>  Deserts:cake,pie,custad,caramel and anything is great !!!!|`|EpCuEvvdaa	corn on the cob<br>  spicy corn<br>  salad never goes wrong<br>  baked or fryed potatoes<br>  <br>  for dessert <br>  ice cream or frozen yogurt<br>  straberry cheesecake<br>  choclolat cake<br>  flapjacks<br>  <br>  try bbc food for idears and resipes<br>  <br>  x<br>  <br>  enjoy <br>  <br>  x|`|Sl9lwyVdaa	I usually make Potato Salad, Deviled eggs, beans and Regular Salad.

A decir de los investigadores, Rubén Páez Kano, Raquel Ibá?ez y la fotógrafa Natalia Fregoso, las principales etapas del trabajo fueron la exposición fotográfica titulada Las pitayas nuestras... en las instalaciones de la presidencia municipal de Techaluta. Dichas fotografías lograron captar diversos aspectos del ciclo natural de la pitaya (brote de pitones e inicio de la floración, maduración, cosecha y venta).<br>  <br>  Gracias a las entrevistas de trabajo, visitas a huertas de pitayos y tomas fotográficas, se logró un Breve recetario de la pitaya. Ambos trabajos se publicaron en un folleto bajo el título de Las pitayas nuestras...<br>  <br>  <br>  Recuento de la historia de Techaluta<br>  <br>  Techaluta, "lugar donde abundan las ardillas" es cabecera del municipio del mismo nombre, y se ubica en la región del sur del estado de Jalisco. A la orilla de la laguna seca de Sayula, aproximadamente a la altura del kilómetro 70 de la carretera libre Guadalajara –Ciudad Guzmán, el más peque?o municipio jalisciense se distingue por su producción de pitayas.<br>  <br>  Este municipio limita al norte con Zacoalco, al sur con Amacueca, al oriente con Atoyac y al poniente con Tapalpa y Atemajac; una de sus principales características es la gran cantidad de huertos de pitayos, en donde se producen las variedades mamey, roja, amarilla, blanca y morada.<br>  <br>  Las mejores pitayas del mundo, orgullo de los habitantes de Techaluta, se producen en este terru?o del estado de Jalisco. Su historia tiene profundas raíces. De la época prehispánica poco se sabe y quedan como mudos testigos, sitios a punto de desaparecer.<br>  <br>  El arqueólogo Phil Weigand dijo que, durante un recorrido por la superficie por la cuenca de Sayula, "se encontraron evidencias que permiten afirmar que se trabajaba la sal en las playas de Amacuenca, Techaluta y Atoyac (...) En efecto, existen cerca del actual pueblo, varios sitios con arquitectura monumental como pirámides, plazuelas cerradas y terrazas. Además se localizaron talleres de obsidiana, plataformas residenciales, minas de barro y compuestos de cobre. Techaluta antigua se desarrolló entre 700 y 1300 d.C. con aspectos de una evolución urbanística incipiente".<br>  <br>  <br>  Las pitayas también tienen su historia<br>  <br>  Representaban el símbolo del manjar de los antiguos dioses: los corazones representados en el cuauhxicalli. El historiador José Ramírez Flores oriundo de Techaluta, se?ala que como parte de esta tradición queda el nombre de la localidad de Anoca, que significa "lugar de las tunas de agua, atl-nochtli".<br>  <br>  Durante la época colonial, Techaluta formó parte del territorio conocido como Provincia de ávalos, por la encomienda otorgada a Alonso de ávalos en el siglo XVI. En el documento denominado Suma de visitas de pueblos de 1548, aparece el nombre de Taxelutla, y en otros documentos coloniales se nombra Tlachelutla, Techalotlan, Techalutla y, finalmente, Techaluta.<br>  <br>  Este trío de investigadores se propuso realizar una publicación y una exposición "que recuperara la memoria histórica de los antiguos y actuales pobladores de Techaluta alrededor de las pitayas, además que recopilara el conocimiento popular y los saberes tradicionales acerca de ellas y de la cactácea que las produce".<br>  <br>  <br>  El órgano, árbol de la pitaya<br>  <br>  Los brazos del órgano pueden medir de metro y medio hasta dos metros cada uno, y en época de calor se llenan de peque?as frutas semi redondas, de cáscara verde, y con ahuates similares a las del nopal y la tuna. La máscara es blanda, semejante a la de la guanábana y puede pelarse fácilmente con la mano. Incluso, las pitayas silvestres suelen abrirse ligeramente por sí solas.<br>  <br>  Aunque para los recolectores sólo hay dos clases de pitayas, la silvestre y la criolla, la gente suele identificar a la fruta por su color y así la denominan como "pitaya roja", "bugambilia", "amarilla" o "blanca". Ninguna desmerece en frescura, pero en tama?o, sabor y calidad de azúcares, la mejor es la variedad conocida como "pitaya mamey", que por cierto hace referencia a su tama?o (similar a una manzana mediana), y no al color. La diferencia de colores sólo se debe a la especie a la que pertenece el fruto.<br>  <br>  Para obtener las pitayas es necesario separar el brazo del órgano del tronco principal y luego cortarlo en dos. Ambos extremos se sembrarán para obtener nuevas plantas. La raíz tardará tres a?os en dar frutos y aunque en el extremo del brazo, donde estaban las pitayas podrán renacer al siguiente ciclo.<br>  <br>  La pitaya sólo se da entre los meses de abril y junio y es cuando tras unas tres o cuatro horas de trabajo, durante esos meses, los recolectores terminan de llenar sus canastos con 200 o 300 pitayas que después se repartirán entre familiares y vecinos, o bien, se venderán en el pueblo, comunidades vecinas o a la orilla de las carreteras.<br>  <br>  Techaluta, Amacuenca, Zacoalco de Torres, Teocuitatlán, Sayula, Tolimán, Autlán de Navarro, San Martín de Bola?os, Colotlán, Totatiche, Villa Guerrero, San Cristóbal de la Barranca y Juchitlán, son la casa de este fruto exótico, que sólo nace en regiones, como el sur y extremo norte de Jalisco, donde las condiciones agroclimáticas lo favorecen, aún cuando se trate de suelos pobres y sitios con poca agua. Por algo se ha llamado a la pitaya "fruto de piedra", pues brota en suelos donde la roca madre está casi a flor de piso.<br>  <br>  El órgano (Stenocereus queretaroensis) es una planta que pertenece a la familia de las cactáceas y de la cual se conocen 20 especies en el mundo. En México se dan 19 de ellas, que crecen en forma silvestre (80 por ciento) o cultivada.<br>  <br>  Jalisco, después de Oaxaca y Puebla, es el tercer productor de pitaya del país. La Secretaría de Desarrollo Rural estima que existen 400 hectáreas de plantíos de pitaya, pero la producción es muy variable: en algunos municipios, como Techaluta o Amacueca, puede haber densidades que van desde 625 a 825 plantas por hectárea, mientras que en otros, apenas se encontrarán 50 plantas por hectárea.<br>  <br>  Así pues, con la monografía y la investigación que a través del programa de Apoyo para las Culturas Municipales y Comunitarias (PACMyC) que otorga el Consejo Nacional para la Cultura y las Artes, la fotógrafa, Natalia Fregoso y los investigadores Raquel Ibá?ez y Rubén Páez Kano, se dieron a la tarea de realizar por medio de trabajos colectivos e individuales y de tradiciones orales de los habitantes de Techaluta; todo lo relativo a este mexicano fruto que es la pitaya se desprende también a partir de la difusión que se le ha dado a este cultivo en Jalisco desde 1996: se le ha brindado la importancia que amerita, "ya que anteriormente el productor sabía lo rentable de la actividad, pero para llegar al mercado estaba sujeto al coyotaje", se?alaron los investigadores.<br>  <br>  Ahora, se saben muchas cosas del pitayo, por ejemplo que se adapta a condiciones adversas al suelo y clima en las que no sobreviven otros cultivos, y además es muy rentable por los bajos costos de producción y riesgos. También es regenerador de suelos y puede combinarse hasta con dos cultivos en su etapa de crecimiento, observándose en algunas parcelas que está en combinación con el maguey pulquero y el pasto. Gracias a la investigación de Ibá?ez, Páez Kano y Fregoso, ahora se sabe más de este fruto que bien podría ser también un verdadero símbolo nacional.|`|df7cbf4da163a00767eea27e54707fecaa	solamente se ke es komo una fruta...a pesar de ser vegetariano no me gusta|`|f303a7bde773fe6c2b9d0f363ed724ccaa	si   es   una   fruta   muy   buena  y  dulce   de  América   del   sur  es   difícil  verla   en  los   mercados   pero  aqui  en  morelia   solo  hay  en  pocas   ocaciones

F77AfkUIaa	If you're looking to make liquor, don't. It's illegal to make your own because it's very, very difficult. This is because of how easy it is to screw up and end up poisoning yourself.<br>  <br>  Brewing your own beer is another story. Making it cheaply is not horribly possible because there's such a large market for it and because there are so many tools needed to do it right. Also, if you're underage, you won't be able to order supplies on-line because most ask for I.D. upon receiving the delivery. <br>  <br>  If you are of age, Mr. Beer is relatively cheap: <a href="http://www.mrbeer.com/" rel="nofollow">http://www.mrbeer.com/</a> and you don't have to be horribly knowledgeable.

Because some of the products are salted, like the two items you mention, I have it on good authority from a Japanese Chef, that his broths, and a lot of other additives do not have salt and he doesn't add any additional salt.<br>  <br>  The only time that seasoning is addressed is towards the end of the cooking process.<br>  <br>  Chris|`|CNSGz12zaa	nope--they like it salty|`|cfdc405defe60d37e2129e3f90174096aa	C.M.C is right, I worked in Japan and they use very little residual salt as there food product tend to be pre-seasoned in some ways, it depend on the dishes and what way your cooking, salt id use for fish and meat dishes not cooked or marinaded in salt seasoned elements.<br>  <br>  Alot of the food there is seasoned when cooking so you will not see salt shakers on the table, but soya sauce is there choice for added saltiness. You could like other cuisine limit or reduce the salt, and I have never seen salt free miso, it is what is used preserve it and in the fermentation process. Bonito is so fine a small amount will not be loaded with salt, I buy it here in Canada, I live in Toronto and use them with my "Natto" in the morning.

Whoever told you that mattered, please slap them and then ignore anything they tell you in the future; they clearly wish to confuse you.<br>  <br>  The only way you could have food poisoning is if the salmon was not cooked.  You never mentioned it being cooked, this is why everyone is bringing up that point.  If the salmon was cooked you are fine.  You could have even eaten the salmon!

zQbpJmESaa	My favorite way to freeze scones and biscuits are to first prebake them partway until they were set, but right before they started to take on color. After they were thoroughly cooled, freeze in a resealable bag in an airtight container.

Go ahead and bake them, then wrap them tightly in plastic wrap and put them in a ziplock freezer bag to protect from freezer burn.  Then when you're ready to eat one, either nuke it in the microwave to defrost and cook, or let it sit out and thaw a little bit on the counter while your oven preheats and warm it in a 350 degree oven 5-10 minutes (keep in mind that microwaving will leave it sitting in a little puddle of melted ice, so reheating in the oven would probably work better).|`|4b2aeczjaa	Fridge

This way your chicken is  moist and delicious throughout.<br>  <br>  You can cook a frozen chicken, but it will result in the outside being cooked before the middle reaches the ideal temperature.  To get the middle to the safe temperature for poultry you will need to cook it much longer , and it will result in an overcooked dried outer layer.<br>  <br>  BTW - many "fresh" chicken found in your markets have been frozen when packaged and thawed at the store.  So you are really not getting a "fresh" chicken at the market unless you go to a farm store.

I will just add that I drain the pickles on paper towels before battering or breading them, and I dredge them in seasoned flour, then either batter or egg.  The flour helps the second ingredient stick.  If you're using the egg method, then dredge them in the seasoned flour again.  I've learned that if I don't drain some of the pickle juice off the pickles, the batter tends to slide off in cooking, if you even get it to the oil.|`|gnCiGSjbaa	All I do is dunk the pickle in an egg, dunk it in bread crumbs and fry it.

HxtKRMKAaa	A good chip is not rocket science. However a bit of time is required.<br>  For the best results.<br>  <br>  The best oil for frying is Peanut Oil. It allows for high temperatures without burning. The blue haze you see in other fats is the oil burning. Burnt oil gives a bitter taste to the food you are cooking and it also means you are ingesting carcinogenics.<br>  Each type has its own heat threshold. Most shops use Veg oil. It is not the most healthy choice regardless of what is espoused.<br>  The type of Potato you use also impacts on the crispy factor.<br>  Some species of spuds just don't make good chips. I use the commonly available desiree or just the plain old reliable pre washed.<br>  Try to cut all chips to the same thickness. This then means that they all cook and colour at the same time. (I tend to put the cut pieces into a bowl of water until all the peeling and chopping is done, it helps to stop oxidization and helps to leach out some of the starch) Once all the spuds are cut up, wash thoroughly (to remove the excess starch) and use a clean tea towel to dry. Be sure to dry properly or the oil will rise in the pan too much and spit all over the place. Ouch factor high.<br>  Oil in pan is hot enough when a test chip floats to the top and has a lot of bubbles around it and gives off a lovely crackle.<br>  Do Not over fill the pan rather cook in patches.<br>  You double fry chips for the best crunch on the outside and colour.<br>  So the first time around you cook them until the spud is tender. Meaning that you can eat them even if they look pale and limp.<br>  Place on absorbent paper or another clean tea towel, to drain off the oil. Pat them dry if need be.<br>  Once all the chips have cooked the first time you then repeat the process but this time cook until they are as brown as you like them to be. keeping in mind that the longer you do this the less of a soft center will exist.<br>  When ready once again drain them of excess oil by either using clean kitchen towel or paper. And season.<br>  The ones I like are <br>  Salt mixed with chicken stock. Maggi is the best.<br>                           OR<br>  Aromat made by Knorr<br>                            Or<br>  Fresh Rosemary in a bag with salt smash with hard object and separate from each other. <br>  Enjoy.|`|7cUDstdjaa	You can as they are normal potato chips, only the Chippies' cook them in either lard or a special cooking oil/fat|`|uq4ZuWnEaa	There is no special anything added to the oil it is just used over and over again anyway who wants chippy chips all soggy and limp and absolutely totally unhealthy|`|XAAF7R23aa	they are not allowed to use dripping any more in england sadly , but the fat they used is very saturated oil, some chippies part cook them, and then throw them in later. could be the rest of the stuff they cook in the oil like fish, sausage, etc tastes the oil? <br>  <br>  I used to like them cooked in dripping, lots of vinegar which is stronger than you use at home even though they used to dilute it, with the added filip of newspaper print. lol|`|hNCiw6Laaa	I feel sure it's the fat they use??

Heat up fat in pan until hot (a chip dropped in will bubble) and cook chips until they are soft. (They will not be brown yet, just "done"). You also need to cook in smallish quantities -- not too many for the size pan you are using.<br>  <br>  2. Using a slatted spoon, fish them out into a colander, trying to tap off as much fat as possible.<br>  <br>  3. Turn the heat UP until the fat is really hot and "smoking". Now carefully return your chips to the pan. This SHOCKS them and turns them crunchy brown on the outside with a lovely soft inside. BTW You can "cheat" making roast potatoes in the same way, only parboil them and drain (or leave to go cold) before shocking them.<br>  <br>  4. Remove to colander lined with kitchen paper to absorb some of the fat. If you want soggy chips wrap them in greasproof paper instead, so they "sweat". Sprinkle generously with salt and vinegar.<br>  <br>  The choice of fat for proper chips is traditionally going to be a saturated animal such as lard or dripping which can be heated to a high temperature without fear of "catching" i.e. burning, or going rancid with repeated use... This means you cannot use chicken, lamb or many of the oils available these days. Even 100% beef dripping is debateable.<br>  <br>  I suspect the taste of chippy chips (even if cooked in oil) has a lot to do with all the other goodies they have cooked (fish, chicken, battered burgers, etc.) along with the chips! YMMV<br>  <br>  And Loon... If you bought the Best Chippy ever, but cannot make good chips, wouldn't you feel sorry for all the customers?!?|`|Wd1vUx3Vaa	Ever heard the saying evil never felt so good?<br>  That's why chips from the shop tastes better to our carnal senses.

SSD3jj7baa	Beans, cheese, yogurt, milk, tofu, all have protein =)|`|oQs2i4Z9aa	Protein is found abundantly in plant foods. Vegans should consume a variety of protein sources, including legumes and foods made from them (e.g., beans, peas, lentils, peanuts, peanut butter, tofu, tempeh, edamame, soy milk, and faux meats), nuts, seeds, nutritional yeast, and whole grains. It was once thought that various plant foods had to be eaten together in order to get their full protein value, but current research has shown that this is not the case; a varied diet of nutritious plant foods provides all the protein that you need. Unlike animal protein, plant-based protein sources usually also contain healthy fiber and complex carbohydrates. Animal products are also full of artery-clogging cholesterol and saturated fat, and consumption of animal protein has been linked to some types of cancer. Plus, it's suspected that the high sulfur content of animal protein weakens people's bones. (For example, a study by researchers at the University of California found significantly less bone formation in meat-eating women than in vegan women.)|`|T32hOtKtaa	protein shakes rulez the worldz.|`|siA8pCOmaa	Beans and rice, eggs,pasta,yogurt,Chick peas, Cow's milk|`|MbSSIOpSaa	Any kind of bean.

About 20-25 grams should be plenty for the average person so don't be overly concerned about protein.|`|aMHIA7XMaa	Try other nuts - almonds walnuts, brazil nuts, etc. Beans, lentils, chick peas, milk, eggs and cheese are also good sources of protein.
36a3ynpJaa	The actual cost of the food is only part of what determines the price.  If something cheaper sells less than another product, it still has to pay "rent" for the shelf space in the supermarket.   Supermarkets also buy regular sugar by the pallet load while the organic sugar they will buy in a case on a split pallet, which holds less and costs more to ship and inventory.  This goes all the way down the line since regular sugar is shipped in 20 ton containers.<br>  <br>  Most supermarkets have pallet sales where they get in a full pallet of some product and put it on display for a very good price.  When they have sold off about half the pallet, it goes back to the regular price.  The store makes the same profit and they get good good will from the customer.  This is how Waldemar got started as a discount store.  People would drive 20 miles so they could get the pallet prices on the things on sale and then they would sell add-on products for the regular price.|`|9ekjMzbUaa	because more people buy it|`|eF6HTt0gaa	Anything with NATURAL in its name is always going to cost you more as your paying for it in its almost pure state.

u0udwkZQaa	Livestock is not a major cause of greenhouse gas, it is however a mentioned source because it just about registers as significant.<br>  When scientists mention livestock, they're refering to the methane they produce, basically, they fart a lot as a result of all the vegetation they eat.<br>  <br>  Eating meat doesn't contribute much at all, there will always be a dairy industry, a leather industry and a meat industry whether or not some people decide to eat less. Some pollution no doubt comes from transport of animals, but then pollution comes from transport of anything which uses leaded petrol.<br>  <br>  Being a veggie, is no solution because unless everyone stops, the industries will still need cattle and besides, it's not like you don't use petrol in the planes that spray pesticides on crops, or work the harvesters in the fields, or power the machinery that processes and the transport.<br>  <br>  Truth be told, pollution from traffic is much worse than cattle farts, and pollution from traffic is also nothing itself, when compared to pollution from industrial factories and powerstations. It's places like China, India and America that are affecting the world's pollution on a major scale through industry and powerstations, so unless those big three polluters all stop using fossil fuels (coal,oil,petrol,gas) it won't matter what anyone does. It's totally insignificant compared to the amount of pollution going on around the world as a result of these top 3 huge polluters.|`|ZcrsqMbcaa	nobody would make money raising them ..if nobody bought meat or used dairy|`|AA12334360	livestock production accounts for 90% of agriculture polution <br>  <br>  and yet it produces only 15% of the food.<br>  <br>  ( EU government figures - 2007 )<br>  <br>  As you can see from that, meat production produces a dis-proportional amount of polution compared to arable crops<br>  <br>  Its not just methane, Cattle are also responsible for 30% of the worlds Nitrous output - this has a 900% ( yes, 900% ) higher impact on global warming that methane.<br>  <br>  The farming community ( of which i am part ) universally accepts that livestock production is the worst poluter.

I just ask cos this is one of the reasons given for not eating meat."<br>  <br>  That's correct, they produce it whether we eat them or not.<br>  However, because we force these animals to continually produce more and more cattle to meet meat demands, there are far more cattle that we create for the meat industry than would exist in the wild. <br>  <br>  That's how it contributes.|`|0fuF2sHbaa	There wouldn't be so many cattle if it weren't for the over-breeding. <br>  <br>  It's not like people pick a few out of a field - they're bred in their billions to supply the demand by meat eaters, milk drinkers and leather buyers. <br>  <br>  There might only be a few million or hundreds of thousands in the world if they weren't farmed.|`|dzalU4tBaa	actually termites produce more greenhouses gases than any other creature on this planet.....so instead of stopping eating cows...why not exterminate the termites|`|f262cda35c3c0959f3b4089b38f0359faa	Well said Yowsa!!!<br>  <br>  According to the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization, livestock generates more greenhouse gas emissions as measured in CO2 equivalent – 18 percent – than cars. It is also a major source of land and water degradation, and livestock (not just cows)  30 percent of the earth’s entire land surface.<br>  <br>  The large contributor of polluting agents are animal wastes, antibiotics and hormones, chemicals from tanneries, fertilizers and the pesticides used to spray feed crops, and yes, come from both human and natural sources. Widespread overgrazing disturbs water cycles, and reduces replenishment of above and below ground water resources. Large amounts of water are withdrawn for the production of feed. <br>  Cattle industry is not the only source of greenhouse gasses, there is also combustion of fossil fuels, coal mining, landfills, and rice paddies. To name a few human-related sources. <br>  Therefore, becoming a vegetarian is not the primary solution. Even if the entire world population became vegitarians the problem would still remain. And, I do not propose that doing away with all livestock could be a solution either.|`|7E2kGw2naa	Maybe you don't understand this, but the more meat people buy, the more cows farmers will breed.  <br>  <br>  Cows have microbes in their digestive system that help them digest food, but the microbes also release methane when they break that food down.<br>  <br>  "Truth be told, pollution from traffic is much worse than cattle farts, and pollution from traffic is also nothing itself, when compared to pollution from industrial factories and powerstations."<br>  <br>  Nope....According to the UN's food and agriculture organization, livestock is responsible for 18% of greenhouse gas emissions and transportation 13%.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.fao.org/ag/magazine/0612sp1.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.fao.org/ag/magazine/0612sp1.h...</a>|`|uq4ZuWnEaa	How very right you are the argument that livestock produces methane gas and is adding to the cause of global warming does not give a solution to us not eating the animals vegetarian logic is not always correct so it is proved.  The comedy of it is that these animals have been around for millions of years although they were not classed then as live stock but were wild and hunted and eaten by humans when suddenly they are the cause of global warming.  It is okay for humans to drive cars produce electricity extract oil from the earth send rockets to outer space but not okay to eat meat.   No logic or very carefully thought out I'm afraid|`|kMK9E2a7aa	At least by saying you are ignorant on these matters goes in your favour. Most on here don't admit to it!<br>  Anyone who suggests cattle is a major cause of greenhouse gas, then I take it they have forgotten about all forms of transport and some industries pumping out pollutants every day.<br>  If cattle ARE a major source, then humans aren't far behind them.|`|s7pqFa1eaa	Due to the methane gas that cattle produce and the transport of beef and beef by products over long distances.|`|sDAnuaBYaa	Don't forget the green house gases created by feeding all the livestock. (100 lbs of grain to 1 lb of beef)|`|wX3P9Tlcaa	livestock does produce a lot of gas ,but termites emit more.|`|uS0wlcmtaa	Farts from eating all of that hay. It produces methane gas. It takes a lot of grass, and vegetables to feed the millions of cattle and when they digest all that fiber they let off a lot of gas.<br>  <br>  To grow vegetables as food for humans takes a lot less land than it does to feed the animals. More people could be fed around the world if the land devoted to raising livestock was used for growing food crops.|`|rofoYTh8aa	It is not THE major cause, but farming produces a great deal of methane. If you do not eat farm animals (mostly cattle), they will not be farmed and so you remove this source of green house gas production. But you will also have to reduce or eliminate dairy products from your diet too, otherwise they will still be kept for milk production.<br>  <br>  I personally consume milk and most dairy products because the alternative (soya) is now responsible for massive deforestation in countries like Brazil and IMHO cannot possibly be GM free any more. Which is why I no longer use vegetable oil from maize, corn, etc. either.<br>  <br>  It also reduces my carbon footprint... Local dairy products (inc. methane) are better than imports from across the world, especially if the land has been "stolen" from forests too. At least that is my take on the problem and what I have chosen to do! YMMV!|`|Je2QKnxvaa	Cattle don't produce much compared to Industry.  Agriculture pollution, is not a major percentage of World pollution. Around 75% of World pollution is nothing to do with livestock or their farts! LOL.

The dish was invented by the London food shop Fortnum & Mason, in 1851.[1] Contrary to popular belief, it is not a Scottish dish. Scotch eggs are commonly eaten cold, typically with salad and pickles.<br>  Scotch eggs were traditionally a picnic food, designed to be eaten fresh. However, in the UK at least, they have acquired an unfashionable, downmarket reputation due to the preponderance of pre-packed, plastic-wrapped Scotch eggs sold at convenience stores and motorway service stations.|`|FariFRFjaa	A Scottish cult invented them. They were farmers who were sort of chefs on the side. They wrapped some pork around a boiled egg.

Same said for washing onion off your hands.|`|eF6HTt0gaa	Wash as normal, soak in a solution of water and bleach for 10 minutes, rinse and then scrub with a combination of Lemon juice and sea salt, the abrasiveness of the salt and the acid of the lemon will break it all down and remove that scent.

XpKY04Tnaa	Because you drink cheap crappy beer. Ice cold liquids stun the taste buds in your mouth and you really don't taste anything. You just have the cold sensation from the liquid. Once the beer warms up your taste buds start working. <br>  <br>  Try drinking a high quality American or German beer. They are made to be served at cellar temperatures. Meaning they don't taste bad when they get a little warm.  <br>  <br>  Or if you have to drink cheap beer drink it faster.|`|19XMgD2Xaa	Depends on what you are drinking.  If you are drinking American commercialized beer such as bud light, coors light, miller... then that's you're problem.  <br>  <br>  These beers are made at very low quality and usually only take a couple of weeks to produce.  The reason why they serve it cold is to cover up the lack of taste or (poor quality taste).  This may be the reason why the last sip of beer taste bad.  <br>  <br>  If you try a good quality beer they actually stands up in the warm (not freezing cold served in a ice cold mug that just nums your taste buds) that may solve your problem.|`|XwacWyy6aa	Well in some beers, (particularily unfiltered beers) all of the impurities sink to the bottom so it doesn't taste as nice right at the base of it.

Some dark beers are beer with a light amount of carbonation for sure but not flat.<br>  The main thing it is flat by the last sip (s). That and it is warmer. But these two reasons are related because as a beer warms it allows the CO2 to leave the beer making it flat.<br>  The action or agitation of tipping the bottle also releases the CO2 out of the beer causing it to become flat.<br>  It is a myth that all beers in Germany (Europe) are served at cellar temperatures which range from 50-65F. Most lagers especially pilsners are served col at about 45F. It is in England (Great Britain) where many beers, especially darker, are served at around 55F.|`|IGNzSoUoaa	Warm and bitter, right? Ugh, I know exactly what you mean, it's nasty! I would recommend a coozy or pour the ice cold beer in an ice cold mug and it should be ok.

f2d9c213ef900a74f5759771f3fb61a7aa	On Line I found this : Perhaps it will help :<br>  <br>  <br>  Things You’ll Need:<br>  <br>      * 2 empty plastic bottles<br>      * Water - 2 Quarts<br>      * Sugar - 2-3 cups, depending on your desired sweetness<br>      * 4 1/2 - 5 teaspoons  Baker's Yeast<br>      * Flexible plastic tubing <br>  <br>  <br>  1 Mix all of the sugar and water together in the bottle. Put the lid on and shake it vigorously to make sure all of the sugar gets dissolved. Warm water will help it dissolve faster, but make sure the water is cooled down before you add the yeast.<br>  Step2<br>  Add yeast. It can be found in the baking supplies aisle of most supermarkets. The ideal amount is enough to cover a quarter. Put the lid on and shake the bottle lightly to evenly distribute the yeast throughout the mixture.<br>  Step3<br>  Tightly cover the top of the bottle with a CLEAN cloth or rag and let sit for 24 hours. The yeast needs fresh oxygen in the first 24 hours of fermentation. After 24 hours, remove the cloth and install an airlock (available from many homebrew websites online) or stretch a balloon over the top. The reason is that the fermentation will produce excess gas which must be released, while preventing bacteria from entering and turning your kilju into a fly-infested mess.<br>  Step4<br>  Wait. Place the balloon-topped bottle in a place where it won't be disturbed. Storing it in a warm place (between 70 and 80 degrees) will aid the fermentation. You will have to empty the gas out of the balloon a few times a day at first, then once a week to prevent it from blowing off. Wait one week. If everything has been done properly, you will begin to notice a fine beige-colored sediment accumulating at the bottom of the bottle.<br>  Step5<br>  Rack it. "Racking" refers to the winemaking practice of siphoning off the product, leaving the dead yeast at the bottom. Insert your flexible plastic tubing and get it as far down in the bottle as you can without getting it too close to the sediment. Make sure the other end of the tube is below the level of liquid in the bottle. A good setup is to put the kilju on a chair or table, then have the tube going into another bottle on the floor. Lightly suck on the end of the tube for a second or two then quickly insert the tube into the second bottle. This will produce suction that will pull the kilju down the tube and into the other bottle. When finished, wash out the sediment and return the kilju to it's container.<br>  Step6<br>  Do this once a week, or simply whenever there is excessive visible sediment at the bottom. A good test to see how your fermentation is progressing is to add a small amount of sugar to the mixture, and if bubbles rise to the surface, the fermentation is not complete. When you add sugar and it sinks to the bottom with no result, your kilju is finished. Don't "test" it too often, as it will result in an overly sweet product.<br>  Step7<br>  Enjoy it. You have just produced a drinkable beverage ranging anywhere from 20 to 40 proof. A frequently racked and clarified kilju tastes the best straight. It doesn't seem to take well to mixers. Drinking it straight well chilled on the rocks is probably the best way to enjoy it<br>  <br>  <br>  Vegan Forever

Reduce down on a medium heat then add teriyaki sauce just enough to wet then turn off the heat. Allow to sit in the sauce for 20 minutes then serve over a bed of rice. There should be no juices left. If so add the rice and let sit 10 minutes. Then serve. It is wonderful.

besOFglNaa	I would go with a dry reisling or a pinot noir, depending on how heavy the dishes are. And in my opinion, a dry champagne goes with everything.|`|c22cd3bc80b769e97ac9ae2bc60d368eaa	I usually go with a white with lamb.  A Pinot Grigio would not overpower the food.  For a red, perhaps a Pinot Noir.|`|TJOHxhEUaa	Retsina would be the traditional choice for Greek food, either white or rose.  But a lot of people don't care for the taste of resinated wine.  I'd suggest a light red to pair up with the food but not overpower it.  Kendall Jackson seems to be available everywhere at decent prices.  Look for their Merlot or Meritage Red; each is 13.5% alcohol which is a little lower than most reds these days and that will help it match the food.|`|f262cda35c3c0959f3b4089b38f0359faa	Greek cuisine can tend to be on the heavier side, so as a rule of thumb try to choose crisp wines that are light to medium bodied and somewhat refreshing.<br>  <br>   Those from the north of Greece will insist on a wine form Naoussa, whether aged 12 months, such as the Xinomavro Chrisohoou or the elegant Estate Chrisohoou, aged 18 months in the barrel then two more in the bottle. Those who are from the south of Greece will in insist on a Nemea, such as Kouros Nemea. <br>  <br>  Lamb and pinot noir are the classic pairing, because lamb has a gentle flavor that goes well with the soft berry flavors of pinot noir. Burgundy is the pinot noir made in France. If your lamb recipe involves a heavy amount of spice or sauce, try moving up to Merlot or Cabernet Sauvignon. <br>  <br>  See the link below to learn more about the greek wines.
hh4p6irSaa	I have purchased from Hookaholic.com before! <br>  It's trustworthy!|`|qKpRCwVXaa	Yeah, I've smoked hookah for like 8 years and their website's pretty good, but truthfully you might want to just go to your local hookah bar which you can find at this site <a href="http://www.planjam.com/hookah.html." rel="nofollow">http://www.planjam.com/hookah.html.</a> Also in my opinion the best brand to buy is nakhla tobacco because it's not too expensive at most places(like 8-10 bucks per flavor) and mixes well with other brands especially al waha brand tobacco. Some good flavor mixes to try are anything to do with nakhla's double apple flavor, al waha's coke flavor and nakhla's mango and nakhla's peach and honey flavors.
AA12176630	Your wine has to much acid and thats why its tart.You will need to blend it with a low acid wine to make it drinkable.You could mix it with a low acid wine from the store if you're in a hurry or make a batch of wine from juice concentrate then blend them later.I've had the same problem,my blackberry was to tart and my pear wine was to sweet and bland.I mixed them to taste 60/40, aged them for another 3 months and it turned out great.Good luck.|`|WOfQZiiJaa	got to the state's store and buy a bottle of blackberry wine....are u dumb?|`|bN7Ja3Woaa	In beer we add dextrine.

I'll keep an eye out for it, and I'll talk to some of the Polish fellas in work to see if they know where I can get it! If you haven't done so already, you should try Zubrowka.

For a start, it won't be raw until a few minutes before or suddenly burn to a crisp if you leave it for a few minutes over. I deliberately tested it with the cheapest pork chops I could find, and the bones just fell out of the meat, it was so tender. It even makes its own apple sauce, and the apple/onion gravy from the juices is fabulous - and there is no waste, either. Enjoy. <br>  <br>  PORK IN CIDER<br>  <br>  Serves 2<br>  <br>  INGREDIENTS<br>  <br>  250ml of cider<br>  1 apple<br>  1 onion<br>  2 pork chops or steaks<br>  <br>  METHOD<br>  <br>  Pour the cider into a measuring jug. Peel and core the apple, cut it into thick slices and put them into the cider to stop them going brown. Peel the onion and chop it into tiny pieces.<br>  <br>  Put the onion in the bottom of an ovenproof dish with a lid. Put the meat on top. Add the cider. Arrange the apple slices on top of the pork. Put the lid on the dish. <br>  <br>  Cook in a preheated oven at 150°C, 300°F, gas mark 2 for about 2 hours. Check the liquid level from time to time and top it up if it starts to dry out. <br>  <br>  ADDITIONS & ALTERNATIVES<br>  <br>  Stir 2 heaped teaspoons of gravy granules into the onion and cider left in the dish to make the most delicious gravy. <br>  <br>  TIPS<br>  <br>  Any cheap cider (that doesn’t have the word “white” in the name) will do. The long, slow cooking in the alcohol tenderises even the cheapest meat.

Bring to boil, and continue boiling until tomatillos turn a different shade of green (from bright green to a dull, army green). Strain tomatillos and chiles, and place in a blender with another quarter piece of onion, 1 clove garlic, and a pinch of salt. Pour in reserved chicken broth, so that liquid just covers the veggies in the blender by about an inch. Blend all ingredients until they are completely pureed. Pour salsa in a medium saucepan, and bring to a low boil. <br>  Pour oil in a frying pan, and allow to get very hot. Slightly fry tortillas one by one in hot oil, setting each on a paper towel afterwards to soak some of the oil. Finally, dip slightly fried tortillas in low-boiling green salsa, until tortillas become soft again. Place on plates, 3 per person. <br>  Fill or top tortillas with shredded chicken, then extra green sauce. Top with crumbled cheese, chopped onion, and chopped cilantro.|`|U7cRW6xqaa	enchiladas...tacos...flautas...tamales..... all good

Irregularly in such circumstances entailing medication can make these pains worse or at times it’s just plain suitable for you in the long wrong to use natural remedies for stomach aches.<br>  <br>  1. My favorite home remedy for stomach aches of the fundamental and not too critical type is entailing some scoops of lime sherbet and putting it in a glass with some sprite. This one is really tasty and a really great remedy for children.<br>  <br>  2. Another really good one which is good for stomach pain and other kinds of stomach aches as well is entailing a sock preferably a long one, filling it with rice, and ensure that you tie it in a knot at the end. After you have completed this put it in the microwave long enough for it to acquire quite warm but not burning then when you place it on your stomach it will offer you a great relief.<br>  <br>  3. Eating yogurt is quite helpful for stomach aches because it holds loads of bacteria that your stomach could at times be missing during a stomach ache. Sometimes lacking such bacteria can be fully responsible for stomach cramps.<br>  <br>  4. Sometimes the reason why people obtain stomach aches is because they required a colon cleanse.

Don't worry the molasses syrup will be rinsed out, however, the taste will still be there. <br>  The difference? It tastes better, doesn't leak, and it actually lasts longer than not watering it down. Just the other day, I timed it with 2 other friends, and changing the coals twice while smoking it generously, it lasted 1hr. & 40min.

The Red were simply found growing wild as were the other colors . Some countries produce more Red while other produce more yellow..<br>  <br>  Here is a bit of Onion History:<br>  <br>  History of the Onion:<br>  <br>  There is no agreement as to the exact location or time of origination of the onion. Many experts believe onions originated in central Asia while others believe they were first grown in Iran or West Pakistan.<br>  <br>  Regardless of where they originated, it is presumed that people discovered and started eating wilds onions a long time ago-long before farming or even writing were invented. It is likely that onions were a staple in the prehistoric diet.<br>  <br>  Most researchers do agree that onions have been cultivated for 5000 years or more. Onions may be one of the earliest cultivated crops because of being less perishable then other foods, were transportable, and could be easily grown in a variety of soils and climates.<br>  <br>  <br>  At the University of California at Berkeley, researchers found that yellow and red onions, along with shallots, contain quercetin, a powerful antioxidant that acts as an anti-cancer agent to block the formation of cancer cells. One and one-half to three and one-half ounces of raw onions eaten regularly contain enough quercetin to offer cancer protection.

This is  because the dry and poisonous enviroment creats a shift in electrolyte balance  in the food which makes it impossible for bacteria to grow and so, the food is preserved.|`|zVIqkjMTaa	The high salt content used to preserve foods prohibits growth of bacteria and other organisms that would otherwise cause the food to spoil.|`|f2AWSb48aa	Next time, use google you fool!!!!!!<br>  <a href="http://wiki.answers.com/Q/How_does_salt_preserve_food" rel="nofollow">http://wiki.answers.com/Q/How_does_salt_...</a>|`|ArKT9O7Maa	First of all, like most questions, this can be solved a lot quicker by using search engines.  But since you already posted the question, here goes:<br>  Salt preserves food because it kills bacteria.  This is because of osmosis, the process of water moving from an area of higher concentration (of water only, not matter) to a lesser concentration to achieve equilibrium.  When salt or a salt solution covers the food, the water in bacterial cells flows out of the cell membrane, causing the cells to shrivel and eventually die.  This means that the bacteria cannot spoil the food, and so it lasts longer.  This is also why pickling (a process of submerging foods in a salt solution) and smoking (typically for meats) foods were the only way to preserve food for long periods before the invention of the refrigerator, which kills bacteria using a cold environment, which is not a good condition for bacteria.|`|9ZkzBAQCaa	Salt inhibits bacterial growth. It provides for a hypertonic environment in which most bacterial cells plasmolyze, or lose water and shrink away from their cell walls. (a hypertonic environment is one where there is more salt concentration outside the cell than there is inside) <br>  <br>  Basically any cell will die with too much exposure to salt. Bacteria is no exception as people found out before the use of refrigeration. <br>  <br>  <br>  I hope that helps!|`|AA10299703	because salt is a neutral compound .

But honestly its hard to say if the chocolate kept its integrity intact or not. In my experiences with baking similar cakes I have always just put them in the fridge in a tight cover. So I have to say...... I really don't know. Check the constancy of the mousse layer and see if there's any change to the texture when you take a small finger full and move it around. You could try tasting it but I don't want to sour your tummy doing that.

qRG2int7aa	The difference is that white eggs come from white chickens and brown eggs come from brown chickens. You think I’m kidding? There are actually different breeds of chickens (just like how there are different breeds of dogs) that lay different colored eggs. The most common breeds of chickens used for egg-laying are the White Leghorn, the Rhode Island Red, and the New Hampshire. White Leghorn chickens are white and lay white eggs. Rhode Island Red and New Hampshire chickens are reddish brown and lay brown or brown-speckled eggs. <br>  <br>  Actually, both kinds of eggs start off white. But in the Rhode Island Red and New Hampshire chickens, there is an extra layer of brown coloring on top of the white egg, making it look brown. Nutritionally, there is absolutely no difference between the two types of eggs.|`|5f6fbccb8643408cbd62a8431b3e5c44aa	"Chickens are just like people in that, generally, a white chicken will lay a white egg and a brown chicken will lay a brown egg, but they're pretty much the same on the inside. Technically, it has to do with the color of the chicken breeds earlobe, but most folks don't get close enough to the chicken to look. Since we feed all of our chickens the same high-protein all vegetable feed, there is no nutritional difference between a white or brown egg."<br>  <br>  There is a link below to show you where I got the quote from. There is no difference between brown eggs and white eggs at all This myth is busted.|`|oqiWY1QBaa	the brown ones come from black chickens.|`|UDfJQ3i9aa	According to the Egg Nutrition Board (and who should know better?), "White shelled eggs are produced by hens with white feathers and ear lobes. Brown shelled eggs are produced by hens with red feathers and red ear lobes. There is no difference in taste or nutrition between white and brown eggs." The people at Crisco (who may know even more than the egg nutritionists) go further to say, "They simply come from two different breeds of chickens. Brown eggs, however, are more expensive because the chickens that lay them eat more than those that lay white eggs." Among the breeds that lay brown eggs are the Rhode Island Red, the New Hampshire and the Plymouth Rock--all larger birds that require more food. <br>  <br>  But Bill Finch of the Mobile Register suggests that brown eggs may have tasted better at one time. He says, "For years, the chickens preferred by commercial growers happened to lay white eggs. A few smart cooks sought out brown eggs because most of the home-reared American flocks, which had access to flavor-enhancing weeds and bugs, happened to lay brown eggs. Commercial egg producers eventually got wise to this. They started raising chickens that laid brown eggs, and charged a premium for them at the store. <br>  <br>  "But because the white AND brown grocery-store eggs are the result of the same bland commercial diet, their eggs taste exactly the same. Many people still apparently don't realize they've been duped at their own game."|`|YJVmL9Ubaa	Well the brown eggs my grandpa's domino chickens laid weren't organic,i asked this question  to my mom when i was little and she told me that brown eggs didn't taste as good as white eggs.The fertile thing now makes sense because dad would laugh and joke with mom in front of us kids that she didn't cook the egg all the way and could we see a feather?Reading back on that i had to edit,it was a joke i couldn't get as a child and obviously still can't.|`|kjgonYlgaa	There' s no difference.

I'll go look for some recipes and cooking ideas.<br>  <br>  Here are some cooking ideas:<br>  <br>  Make a pot roast. Serve the pot roast with mashed potatoes and salad.<br>  <br>  From the pot roast you can make beef hash, barbecue sandwiches, beef sandwiches with brown gravy or beef vegetable soup.

Med8LbTcaa	I am a fruitarian. No, that is not true about the sugar. Fruit sugars are very different than cane sugar, and other artificial sugars. Fruit sugars, such as fructose, are easily digested by humans. They will never ever cause your blood sugar to rise. However, people who eat unhealthy heavy, fatty meats, milk, etc will oddly not do so well with fruit. The combo of the fat and the fruit is what makes blood sugar rise. You cannot experience the raise in sugars on fruit alone. In fact, I actually knew someone who was diabetic and cured herself by eating mostly mangoes. show these articles to your mom to show her:<br>  <br>  <a href="http://hem.fyristorg.com/fruitarian/why.html" rel="nofollow">http://hem.fyristorg.com/fruitarian/why....</a><br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.youngerthanyourage.com/13/protein.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.youngerthanyourage.com/13/pro...</a><br>  <br>  In the long term, you should not have any problems with a fruit diet, as long as you eat a balanced amount of fruit. You can also choose to add some leafy greens later for protein (you do need some protein) and avocado (avocados are fruits) for fat. I actually eat spirulina which is loaded with vitamins and minerals, as well as protein. Wild blue green algae, chlorella, and other similar greens are chock full of nutrients which fruit lacks and allow you to sustain good health long term. It is true that a diet consisting entirely of fruit will lead to nutritional deficits, tooth problems, and developmental problems, but I have eaten a diet of mostly fruit and the greens and algae since I was five. I'm 15 now. I have grown taller than the  kids I know and I have a lot more energy, and vitality without eating toxic grains, meat, and dairy. <br>  <br>  Whenever I try to eat whole grain bread, a little bit of cheese, or anything the like, I feel the toxic reaction immediately. For days, I feel sluggish, clouded in my head, and heavy. Only when I clean it out of my body does the energy come back.|`|URHkLqeKaa	Well, first of all you are not getting any protein or fat. Believe it or not you need a little fat in your diet to produce certain enzymes and hormones. Of course, you definitely need protein form your source of choice. I am vegetarian but I do it for health purposes, not because of morality. You also might have some kind of deficiency of vitamins or minerals in your body causing you to crave one kind of food. This is called Pica. To be healthy, you need to eat a varied diet that includes a balance of proteins, carbs, and fat. Eating only one kind of food is not good for you, no matter how healthy that food is. If you can't control this, you should go see a doctor and he/she should run some blood tests to see if you have some underlying condition. Hope this helps.|`|NNiN0tK0aa	Eating just fruit ruined my health.  You need to go back to a varied diet ASAP.  Your body will eat itself - bone, muscle, organs - and eventually you will starve to death.  Your hair will fall out due to lack of protein and wounds will not heal.  My skin became so thin and fragile that just wearing shoes wore holes in my feet that would not heal.  My shoes were full of blood.  <br>  <br>  How old are you?  You will not grow while on a diet of just fruit.  If you don't start eating other things then you will never get any older, you will look the age you are now for the rest of your life.  Google for kwashikori - protein deficiency.  When people consume enough calories and fat but not enough protein they stop growing and developing - both physically and mentally.  Your brain will not grow.  You will stunt your growth very badly.  <br>  <br>  Eating just fruit is very risky for adults and will lead to all sorts of problems when done for more than a few months.  But for those under 18 it is very very serious - you will not grow.  You need to start eating other foods as soon as possible.  Please believe me.  I ruined my health with just fruit for 6 months.  I regret it every day.|`|f262cda35c3c0959f3b4089b38f0359faa	There can be but, if you are only eating them for a month you probably will not encounter the issues listed below.<br>  Some of the problems of or more fruitarian of more than two years have significant health challenges. The most common challenges are dental decay, osteoporosis, wasting of muscle tissue, inability to maintain a healthy weight, chronic fatigue, skin problems, thinning hair, weakening nails, and excessive irritability. Some of these problems are the result of nutritional deficiencies. The most common deficiencies that I know of in this population are vitamins B12, A*, D, zinc, and certain essential fatty acids.<br>  <br>  eat fruits in moderation, they can contribute to excellent overall health and fitness. Here is a list of some of healthy fruits:<br>  Wild or organic berries, avocado, pomegranets, and apples.<br>  Stay away from fruit juices most of the time, their concentrated sugars contribute to health problems related to too much insulin production.<br>  Please do not leave out vegetables. Lots of beta carotine (for vitamin A) comes from them.|`|fgnQ2vLqaa	A diet of fruit only is not healthy. Please look at the link below for more information. Your body needs protein, grains, dairy, and vegetables, too.|`|cVBSsbodaa	You need to eat a variety of fruit at the very least. <br>  Your body really does need vitamins from vegetables and other sources unless you're taking vitamins..
hHCdXq0Naa	If you have a Container Store near you, they have anything you can dream of for organization!  I bought spice racks, that fit into a drawer, and the bottles fit onto them.  I put pastas in large glass jars (with rubber around the stopper).  If you don't have room in your pantry, these even look pretty displayed on top of the refrigerator (I assume you don't store boxes or misc. up there).  I have little plastic dish bins under the sink, with cleaning supplies in one and some indoor gardening supplies in the other one.  They just lift out, so you can keep it clean under there:)   I have wire racks in my pantry, so I can store 2 levels of cans in one spot;  and I have all opened cereals, rice, etc. in either glass jars or tupperware/rubbermaid.  I keep larger serving bowls on the top shelf of the pantry or cabinets - but if they're pretty, you can stand them up on top of the cabinets as decorations too:)   I keep misc. tupperware and lids in a drawer under my built-in ovens;  and Corningware lids in a slotted metal stand, where you can fit about 5 of them; with the bottoms stacked next to it.   I hope that helped:) ..... Oh!  I had a lazy susan in a corner cabinet in my last house, and kept spices in there.  I had some small square tupperwares that I put envelopes for seasoning in.  You could even stack your kitchen towels on the bottom shelf, if you don't have that many spices - but I wouldn't put any china dishes in there:)|`|yfwY8XGlaa	first of all, you must get rid of clutter.  get rid of everything you haven't touched in the last year.   this is probably most important than any other gadgets.
HxtKRMKAaa	Short Answer in laymen terms.<br>  Scientist are taking genes from animals and plants and placing them into other animal and plants to make them more resistant to a plethora of things that trouble breeders and growers.<br>  Some of the purpose is to make them resistant to diseases and strengthen them against parasites.<br>  It is also done to create species that provide a higher yield for the same effort. As well as creating species that can be grown in areas where previously they were unable to do so.<br>  This is a very interesting subject and I highly recommend that you look into it in some more depth. A huge eye opener.<br>  The long term effects of this process on us mere mortals has of yet not been truly studied and there are some very strong and differing opinions out there.<br>  Much like the green house effect. Some scientist believe there is no danger and other believe that there is.<br>  Who do you believe? Be informed is what I say!|`|9v31wUz1aa	Parts of a plant's DNA is replaced by the DNA of another living organism. This is to make the plant better at resisting pesticide, bacteria, viruses, drought, heat etc. The debate around this issue surrounds where the DNA has come from in the first place - ( it may be animal DNA!).
