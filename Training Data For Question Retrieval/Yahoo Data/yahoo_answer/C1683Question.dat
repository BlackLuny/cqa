Please, please, PLEASE will someone explain to me why does it seem that the 3 stooges are in charge when it comes to simply determining the following when it comes to this Anna Nicole Smith saga:    1) How she died?  2) who's damn kid it is?  3) Where to bury the body?    I get that her will directed everything to her son (who is also dead) but did the will not dictate what happens beyond him?

20090202215338AACAYF8	News & Events;Current Events	Why is it when an African-American is elected or confirmed, it's the fulfillment of MLK's dream?	Now, please don't misunderstand my question.  I am not a racist.  I remember watching & listening to Martin Luther King, Jr. on television when I was younger, and I happened to agree with his dream for African-Americans.  But, surely, not every African-American who is elected or confirmed is the fulfillment of MLK's dream, or are they?  You tell me, as this man who was just confirmed has an unwillingless to back the right to keep and bear arms.  Thank you!      WASHINGTON – Eric Holder won Senate confirmation Monday as the nation's first African-American attorney general, after supporters from both parties touted his dream resume and easily overcame Republican concerns over his commitment to fight terrorism and his unwillingness to back the right to keep and bear arms.      The vote was 75-21, with all the opposition coming from Republicans.      Holder's chief supporter, Sen. Patrick Leahy, said the confirmation was a fulfillment of civil rights leader Martin Luther King's dream that everyone would be judged by the content of their character.       http://news.yahoo.com/s/ap/20090203/ap_o...

So my friends and I have been asking questions to cha cha like "Who is (insert person's name here)?" It's kind of creepy that cha cha gives back some pretty accurate answers.  At first we thought that maybe you could google the information up or go through a search engine but no that's not the case.  We also thought that it could have been through facebook, but none of the information given back about the person is listed under their profiles. It's kind of creepy. I just wanna know how they know this information that you can't just look up.
