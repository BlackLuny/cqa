20090227152332AAh8XIR	Travel;Canada;Other - Canada	Would Canadians like driving in the Florida Keys, USA?	The Florida Keys is a HUGE contrast from Arctic Canada. Both are opposites.      The Florida Keys have not had day of Frost in almost 40 years!  In summer the road gets closed every time there's a hurricane threat though.  And every single day for 90 straight days, it's between 28 and 33 degrees with extremely high humidity.  Winter is blissful.      But here's what this road is like.  You are surrounded by gulf water on both sides of the highway and smell seafood in the warm moist air and they have Key Lime Pie and Lobster and shrimp and crabs and conch chowder in the air.   And each key is like a little island and the main road bridges them all together and then there's a 7-mile (12 kilometer long) bridge at one point with a sidewalk parallel to it.  It is like a highway in the ocean.      Would Canadians like this kind of place every now and then?  What about in January when it's 28 degrees celsius and the sun is out and people are in swimsuits getting sunburns eating ice cream and sea food?      How would that feel to go there in the middle of winter and then come back up to Canada????  I think coming back to Canada AFTER this you'd finally understand why some Americans wear facemasks in -5 degrees.

20090227154202AAFVfJK	Travel;United States;New York City	What will happen if I do not pay my fine for trespassing in the NYC subway?	Hey guys.   I've been visiting New-York for a few weeks and myself and my friend got fined at a Brooklyn subway station (my transit pass was not working and I've been along with my friend). It's 200 USD for both. We tried to explain the police agent I did pay my pass but he did not want hear anything.   So I now have to pay that fine (for myself and my friend) and I'm just wondering if I would get in trouble by not doing so. For instance next time I'll go to the US at  the border. I do not think they will send my information to the database system that they have at the custom but I do not know. They just got my name and birthdate and not my passeport number because I showed them my ID and not my passport. The last  thing is can not go to the hearing because I'm back in Europe.   What do you guys think?   Thanks for your help.

To better specify, is it possible to work as an LPN while also holding the job of a flight attendant?       For as long as I can remember, I have had a great desire to help people, and I believe that nursing is one of the ways in which I would like to do this.   However, I have also realized that travelling is one of the few things that make me truly happy. Although I understand that the economy is greatly struggling at the moment, I continue to have hope and determination in achieving this career in aviation.      P.S. While I have heard the advantages of becoming an RN, I think that being an LPN would be best suited for me. Consequently, I am not interested in becoming a flight nurse.

20090227165338AACxNJH	Travel;United States;Las Vegas	Sexy Vegas weekend with boyfriend- Luxor or Paris?	My boyfriend and I are visiting Vegas for a weekend in June. It is my first time in Vegas so I have no idea what to expect-- I just want a fun, romantic getaway..       Which of these hotels have a better room, better bed, more clean, modern, luxury furnishings--?      The Spa Suite at Luxor--- I think this sounds like a lot of fun if it is clean with a nice view... as long as it's not too raunchy feeling or dirty..      or the Paris hotel with a view. Sounds very romantic to me...      Pretty much I'm looking for a luxurious hotel with a comfy room..       Do you guys have any other suggestions? Thanks!

Pensavo di organizzare una vacanza all'insegna del relax, nel periodo settembrino tra gli appelli universitari e la ripresa dei corsi, con meta la Sardegna (circa 5 giorni). Non la conosco e vorrei che mi consigliaste la costa e le spiagge più belle da visitare, contando che preferisco l'incontaminazione e la bellezza naturale alla popolarità e al caos (rinunciando anche a qualche comodità). Se conoscete anche alberghi carini o siti utili sarò felice di seguire i vostri consigli.   Grazie mille un bacio.

20090225103322AA4mn89	Travel;United States;Other - United States	Vacation to California or BosWash?	I live in Toronto and I'm planning to go on a vacation in the Spring (end of April, beginning of May) for a couple of weeks and I was wondering if I should go to BosWash or California? I've sort of been to both, but here I'll let you guys know:      BosWash - The only place I've been between Boston and Washington is New York City. I've seen most of NYC and been to all its boroughs in a week. I heard getting around the cities in the Northeast US is cheap. I want to visit Boston, NYC for a bit again, Philadelphia, Baltimore, Washington and maybe Virginia Beach. The only problem is that Baltimore, Washington and Philly seem like dangerous cities to visit.      California - I went to California last year for a week (Los Angeles for 3 days, San Francisco for 4 days). I didn't get to see everything, so I want to visit again. If I go, I'm planning to see SF again, Sacremento, maybe the central coast/wine valley, Los Angeles, Orange County, and San Diego. The only thing is, I can't drive in the U.S. right now and it would make my trip in L.A. a lot more fun if I could.      So what do you guys think? Should I go to BosWash or California this spring? :)

20071218205047AAwjur4	Travel;Travel (General);Other - Destinations	How long will it take to receive my international package?	I'm expecting a package coming from China. When I track it on usps all it says is that it arrive at JFK on December 8th, 2007. that's it, nothing else. I've been calling the airport to see what the delay is, suspecting that it's because of the holidays, but I'm not sure. I was told my package was in the care of JFK Airport Service and had passed through customs, but when I went to my local post office they told me it hadn't cleared customs yet. what can I expect? will I receive this? help please!
