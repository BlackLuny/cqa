20090227125019AAYltcG	News & Events;Current Events	What an amazing outcome for such a terrible ordeal!?	Emma Williams, 24, was approached by a man wearing a police jacket who told her he needed her car.      Believing the man was a police officer, she got out of her silver Lexus which was parked on a street in Bolton, Greater Manchester.      But the man then grabbed Miss Williams' arm and pulled her out of the way before jumping into the driver's seat.      She managed to free her two-year-old son Lewis from the back of the car but was unable to reach four-month-old Jack before the thief drove off.............      Miss Williams and the boys' father Gareth Forbes, 32, were still at the scene when a Nissan Micra pulled up 30 minutes later.      A man took the car seat with the baby inside and placed it on the pavement near to them before driving off.      As a mum of four, I can't being to imagine the worry and trauma those parents went though in the minutes they were waiting...Might seem like nothing but it must have been a lifetime for them.      What kind of scum bag stops a mum in a car, takes the car and won't even give her time to remove her children. Yes he returned the baby, but that's NO excuse for the actions he took...      Your views please!       http://news.sky.com/skynews/Home/UK-News...

20090307012517AAUB4Gk	News & Events;Media & Journalism	Has Keith Olbermann become  a total joke?	I always thought that a journalist was someone who was supposed to be fair and balanced, and not supposed to take sides. Though he, over the last few years has become extremely left leaning and nothing more then a joke in the world of cable news. Kim Jung Ill has a more fair press working for him.       It is clear to me that Keith and MSNBC has become nothing more then a group of cheerleaders for the failing Obama regime. Sad but true.      Heck every cloud has a silver lining though, and that being that we have a 99% of taking the 2010 congressional elections.
20090227123756AAlPbUl	News & Events;Current Events	Do republicans have any issues left that won't lead the American people to believe they are struggling?	It seems that issues that were once so clear to them have became nothing but a slippery slope and they can't see to get any friction. Do people really believe that once a President takes over a declining economy it becomes his fault when inaugurated? While it becomes his mess, it surely isn't Obama's fault. So tell me republicans, Are you really worried that much that the GOP will self destruct, that you have to bash a competent president with long term goals for this country?        I disliked Bush, but never wanted him to fail. He did fail and look where we are, so why would anyone want Obama to fail? If he fails, we fail as a nation.

20090306161831AAiAHzd	News & Events;Media & Journalism	The media has a liberal bias?	OK. Think about this. Who owns the big media outlets? Big corporations. HUGE corporations. Now then, who do HUGE corporations NOT like? Liberals. Everyones is always going on about how socialism and liberalism is bad for big business. So why the hell would these big corporations use their media outlets to PUSH LIBERAL AND SOCIALIST AGENDAS?!?!?! It makes no sense. The media does not have a liberal bias, or a conservative bias. It has a corporate bias. End of story. If the media had a liberal bias, they would be trying to completely black out the Republican objections to the budget, and keep the public from hearing it. But thats all you hear on the news. News outlets dont care who the president is, as long as he bows to big business.
