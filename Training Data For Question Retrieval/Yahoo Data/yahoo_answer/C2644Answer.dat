L22hVXTIaa	I don't think the lumps are connected to the vomiting, but you can always get a second opinion on them.  But, the vomiting is always cause for concern because it can quickly lead to dehydration which can be life threatening.  It also depends what he's vomiting, but if he can't hold down food or water, or is vomiting yellow bile, he should see a vet very soon.|`|q17Zlq1Zaa	some breeds like labradors get those lumps allover the body:fatty lumps.I see it with beagles too.  the vomiting is not good:try to reduce the meal size,feed the dog2 or 3 meals per day.  I had a dog for 11 years,he had a sensitive stomach:he ate home-made food(i cooked rice or potatoes+fish)  later,Wellness made a dog food with fish and sweet potatoes:available in dry or canned.  i was able to give him the canned one,the dry food still made his stomach upset.  did the vet do any blood test on your dog:like check liver function:SGOT  or check the pancreas:any problems with the liver or pancreas can give nausea to a dog or human.|`|1JsZbgyFaa	how big are the lumps?  if they're tiny and your vet says not to worry, then it's probably nothing.      the vomiting wouldn't have anything to do with the lumps.  it could be that he swallowed something he wasn't supposed to.  Or it's something completely different.  I'd take him to the vet to have him checked again.|`|uSjy6vgnaa	The vomiting is not likely to do with the lumps.  If he just started vomiting a lot it might be a good idea to take him back to the vet.  There are so many possible causes that it would be impossible to say for sure on here.
AA11459417	You are NOT "too worried" about your cat.  You love him, which means you're concerned about his safety, and that's perfectly normal.  Now, I don't mean to lecture you, but there's a very simple way to put your mind at ease.  Don't let your cat go outside.  Based on what I've read, the average lifespan of a cat that's allowed outdoors is two to four years, and the average lifespan of an indoor cat is 15 to 20 years.  Big difference, huh?  I know your cat is used to being outside but his safety is more important than his desire to be out and about.  Believe me, he can be trained to be very happy being an indoor cat.  I know this from experience -- my cat used to be an outdoor cat, but when I got her, I turned her into an indoor cat by making sure she has enough to stimulate her inside -- lots of toys, TV, radio and plenty of affection.  Cats are very adaptable and can live very happy lives indoors.  So if you really want peace of mind, you'll keep your cat indoors from now on, away from all the dangers outside.|`|4cWtH7X2aa	No, you're not too attached, you're just a concerned pet owner. These are all things that should be considered when you own a cat. I personally keep my cats indoors for all the same reasons you've mentioned, it is not cruel to have an indoor cat. It's been proven that indoor cats live longer as they are less prone to disease (contracted through fighting with other cats), and accidents. I know not everyone will agree with me but at least I know my cat's are safe, otherwise I wouldn't be sleeping at night either.    Something to consider.|`|283f865e237ea72119b132f652eb514baa	then keep him inside where he belongs. cats are not wild animals, they haven't been for over 4000 years. too many really awful things can happen to him out there. I work in a shelter, I foster cats and kittens, and do rescue work. I have seen some pretty awful and disgusting things happen to cats. I know they had horrendously painful drawn out deaths too, many were tortured, some had diseases, some hit by vehicles, some mauled by dogs or coyotes, some of them poisoned, some were even cut into pieces or had firecrackers shoved up their rectums and their guts exploded. Please, if you love your cat then keep him inside!|`|wq6lfHIBaa	If you really worry about your cat try keeping him indoors.....this way you will never have to stay up all night and no one would be able to take him away from you/hurt him and you know he would be safe!!!|`|70878cc978ee2e4a79b3b53284340f9caa	Listen to everyone and keep him inside! That is the only safe place for him,especially if you have coyotes,a parking lot and crazy teens in the area.If the cat gets killed,it's no one's fault but your own,so if you love him SO much,you will keep him in!! Is he neutered?,because if he isn't,that's the reason he wants out.Get him neutered and he will be perfectly happy to stay at home.|`|ZZJKTV8laa	haha god i thought i was the only one that was beyond attatched to their cats. i miss them so much when im gone for only like an hour and just get so happy seeing them. one of them also just senses when im upset or crying even if shes at the other end of the house and comes running to me meowing and gives me headbutts and will stay with me the whole night. i swear id be diagnosed with depression if anything ever happened to them.     i dont let them outside except my balcony if were sitting out there during the summer but it usually only last a few minutes and i bring them back in but my mom has a few cats that she lets outside and shes had 2 get hit by cars and 1 is missing to this day so theres only one that does the same thing your cat does so during the winter she doesnt let him out at all no matter how much he begs and he just gets used to it after a while and doesnt beg as much so i guess you could try to train them like that. i would be to freakin worried letting my cats out because they might not come back.|`|e124e8765c4b0ed9c4d1ca5f0af5f848aa	I have the same problem with my cat!!! I am too attached and would fall into deep depression if she passed away!!    I guess best Advice is to get another cat if it happends!|`|VNdmNUppaa	yoour not too attached. its perfectly normal for someone to treat their pet like a baby. I have a pit bull i do that with. when i leave my house i always worry about him some how getting outside. basically for most people until your have kids your pet in your child.|`|c88Z21chaa	u sound like a great owner, and if something does happen, you can at least know that you took every measure you realistically could to ensure the cats safety. how bad would you feel if you didnt try?    xooxoxox|`|feUxjBbnaa	The only way to assure a long, safe, and healthy life is to KEEP HIM INDOORS!  Other wise it's like playing Russian Roulette with your cat. One day one of those horrible things will happen, it's just a matter of time.  You must keep INDOORS even if he wants out!  No, you are not too attached to your cat.  All true cat lovers have a strong bond with their feline companions.  I love my cat more than most of my relatives! lol I don't know what I would do if anything happened to my Whiskers.  He is my baby.  I do keep him safely INDOORS though, so that makes me feel ALOT better. : )    edit: If you are as worried as you sound about losing him, your ONLY choice is to keep him INSIDE.  Case closed.  Otherwise, it's a matter of time....... : (|`|IuYekkPVaa	If this is your declawed cat, then he should definitely be indoors for his own safety.

AEnXejqzaa	Baby red-eared sliders need a lot more care and attention than adult turtles.  A 10 gallon tank is an adequate starter size for a baby red-eared slider but there are a variety of other enclosures that work just as well.  Large dishpans, mortar tubs, Waterland turtle tubs, and Rubbermaid containers, are among the many things that work as turtle homes.    The water should be deep enough a turtle can easily flip itself to a normal position if it gets turned upside-down.  Ideally the water should be filtered with a 10 to 20% water change performed weekly to help keep it clean.  Foam filters or canister filters work well.  Uneaten food and feces should be removed on a daily basis.  The water temperature should be warm, at least 80F for healthy babies and at least 85F for babies that are not eating well or show other signs of ill health.  A submersible heater used for tropical fish tanks works well with small turtles as do some of the waterproof heat pads that can be placed underneath the tank.  There are many different water conditioners sold for water turtles but aged tap water works quite well for red-eared sliders.    A basking platform that sits above the water line is essential.  This platform should allow the turtle to easily climb out of the water or hang on the edge of the platform and float at the water's surface.  Cork bark, floating wood, and sturdily stacked rocks are good choices as are the floating platforms sold in pet stores.  A bright white light should be focused on the basking platform and provide a temperature of 90-95F throughout the day (at least 10-12 hrs of light a day).  A red basking light or ceramic heat element should be on at night to keep the basking spot around 85-90F.  During the day, a second bulb is needed to provide ultraviolet-B for at least 8 hrs a day.   This ultraviolet-B, often simply abbreviated as UVB, is essential for normal bone development and the overall health and normal behavior of a baby red-eared slider.  Zoomed's Reptisun and Powersun are excellent choices for providing UVB.    Baby red-eared sliders normally have voracious appetites.  Sometimes they are stimulated to eat by moving things, such as live crickets, minnows, bloodworms, or earthworms, but they usually settle into a diet of prepared foods such as a high quality aquatic turtle pellet, frozen and thawed chopped minnows, chopped earthworms, and small amounts of chopped green leafy vegetables.  Most aquatic turtle pellets are excellent sources of protein and calcium.  Ferret kibble, kitten chow, and trout chow have also been used with good success as part of a red-eared slider's diet.  It is extremely important to provide a balanced diet as calcium deficiency (also known as metabolic bone disease or nutritional secondary hyperparathyroidism) and low levels of vitamin A are common causes of poor health in growing red-eared sliders.    If your baby turtles develops swollen eyes, bubbles from the nose, floats a lot or has trouble submerging or surfacing, has a  poor appetite, or simply doesn't swim around much or it sits on the basking platform all day, it is sick and needs veterinary attention    And there can be diseases and infections spread from turtles to humans and vise versa so it is best to keep them away from a lot of human handeling.    MY BEST ADVICE IS MAKE SURE THEY HAVE WATER TO SWIM IN AT ONE END OF THIER TANK AND THEN ROCKS TO CLIMB OUT OF THE WATER AT THE OTHER END. WATER TEMP NEEDS TO BE AT 80 DEGREES AND MAKE SURE THIER WATER IS ALWAYS CLEAN, WHICH IS ALOT OF WORK.    LOVE THEM AND READ AS MUCH AS YOU CAN ABOUT THEM!! THEY ARE VERY CUTE BUT YOU ARE THIER "MOMMY" NOW AND THEY NEED TO BE TAKEN CARE OF LIKE THEY ARE YOUR "BABIES"- GOOD LUCK|`|8cikAYp3aa	you can let the water cool off a bit 70 or there about is fine for them.  No  80 isnt going to burn them.  just make sure they have something to crawl out on to if they want to.    Aquatic turtles are born knowing how to swim. they wont drowned.|`|vS1Z0inOaa	If you're putting them into warm water, then it likely IS too hot for them! 80 degrees F is below your own body temperature. I believe the kind of warm water you give a baby a bath in is close to 95 or 100 degrees F...     I know many people say baby red-eared slider (RES) need 80 degrees water, but I have kept and observed many turtles and I honestly disagree. They do perfectly fine in 70 to 75 degree water. That's about room temperture for most people, so I don't use any heating source on my own turtles. The room temp can drop to 65 at night, so unless your house is cold you do not need a heater. I have heard many complaints of aggression in RES, and personally have observed this in turtles being kept in warmer water. These turtles are native to my area--the midwest--so they are NOT tropical animals and so I would think their water in the wild is colder than 80! As I said, I don't use a heat source and my RES are very mellow and coexist with other turtles very well...     The basking platform, however, MUST be 90 degrees F. They need a hot place to go to be able to digest their food. Also the heat activates their immune system--kind of the way a fever does for humans--and basking keeps them healthy. So as long as you provide that for them and they can crawl out and get warm they'll be fine... And no, 90 degrees won't burn them, they are smart enough to take to the water when they get hot.     Baby RES should eat mostly live whole food the first year. Theyare growing very quickly and really need the bones and liver for proper nutrition. So the first year feeder fish, crickets, and worms make a good base diet. After that firs year RES are mostly vegetarian, so at that point they should be eating turnip greens, kale, spring mix (bagged salad mix), shredded carrots, and occasionally romaine supplemented with the live food.     Pellets make a very good supplement too and I recommend you use it, but it should never account for more than 20% of the total diet. Right now as babies you should give them ZooMed's natural aquatic turtle food, hatchling formula, as this is the only high quality food I know of that is available in very small pellets that babies can easily eat. Eventually you can give them reptomin sticks, cichlid food, Aqua-Max (trout chow), and the appropriate formula of ZooMed food (growth or maintain, depending on turtle's size).     The basking platform must be completely dry so the turtle can dry off, including the bottom shell. This will prevent shell rot. Making sure they always have access to a cuttlebone and to a UVB lamp will ensure proper metabolizing of calcium and vitamin D and a healthy shell. The light should be on 14 to 16 hours a day because that is how long the sun is up in the peak of summer. Then switch it off at night to allow them to sleep.     Turtles are born knowing how to swim, so you really don't need to worry about drowning unless your filter is too strong. You can tel if they're drowning if heir mouths are gaping wide open as if gasping for breath (this does not mean just opening for a drink--it'll obviously look like gasps) or they're staying in one place just flapping their little legs. The most common reason for this is the filter current is too strong and the babies can't swim against it to surface or reach the basking area. This does happen to very young babies. Also if the water is not deep enough and they happen to capsize they won't be able to flip themselves back over and will drown. To prevent this, hold them on their side as you fill the tank. If the water is deeper than the width of their shell they will be fine.     My preferred setup for baby RES is a 10 gallon tank with a floating ZooMed turtle dock and a ZooMed 501 turtle filter. The turtle dock has a submerged ramp so it is easily accessible to the babies and it stays completely dry. Since turtles are very messy and need a filter that is rated to clean three times the water and this filter is rated for 30 gallons, it is adequate for this 10 gallon sized tank. This filter also does not make a very strong current so the babies will have no problems swimming against it, but it does clean the water well as long as you feed them in a separate bowl and keep the media changed out regularly. When they outgrow this tank they wil be large and strong enough to go into a really big tank with a strong filter and virtually any kind of platform (the larger turtles are able to grasp and pull themselves up onto a rock basking area without a ramp--that's not to say the babies can't but sometimes it's harder for them).     Turtles are my favorite animals, so enjoy your cute little babies... Congratulations on your 40 years of rewarding work and love :)|`|Vrc13ExVaa	80 degree water? If that's Farenheit, then that's below your own body temperature.    I doubt it's too hot, seeing as they're cold blooded, anyway.    Holding them is fine, but you have to wash your hands afterward or you might get sick.|`|fBMSIlSIaa	Its fine. And wash your hands before and after you touch them, they carry a disease called Seminola (dont know how to spell lol).     You can tell if they're drowning if they are at the bottom, not moving at all, look like they're trying to swim but are not moving at all except flapping their wittle wegs.|`|XDE8F7Bdaa	80F, or 80 celcius?  It seems like you're gonna kill your turtles.  Never put your turtle in biling water, or hot water.  Use warm water is fine.  I use warm tap water.  They are still ok.  How big ios your baby red eared sliders?  Is it under 4"?  Baby RES will do best under a 10gal tank, with water, and a rock90 for him to bast out through a zoomed repti halogen lamp.  You can use uvb lamp.  It will be cheaper than zoomed halogen lamp.  Don't feed live fish as turtle's diet for the baby red eared slider.  Always feed high quality turtle food like the one called rep-cal aquatic turtle food.  II don't use this one, but another high quality turtle food.    If your home is controled by air conditioner, you don't need a heater in water.  I've experienced that they are fine with cold water.  The only reason for cold water will get the RES refuse to eat.  If you keep your RES in 10gallon tank, you don't need a heater, but provide a basting area for your RES to get there for basting.  A zoomed halogen lamp is required.  It's a good quality lamp for all reptile cares.  They are not very expensive, however the bulb isd expensive.  They are fragile, and easy to damage.    There is no problem how long you will holding your turtle, but immediately soap your hands in warm water, and shake your hands.    All aquatic turtles are born to know how to swim. if you see a turtle begin drowing, it maybe the water depth is too high.  You need to understand how much water you need to add to your RES.  If you do not provide a basting area, you need to keep the water low.  Allow the turtle bast out of water for oxygen.    Another thing is if you don't have a filter, you will need to feed your turtle in a container to prevent fawn the water from feeding too much foods to your turtles.
sbB0TpGXaa	There is no way for us to view the photo since it is on your computer not the internet.  However, you need to put wound powder on the cut every day.  After about 2 or 3 days I would start washing the wound first with clean water.  Scrub gently with your hands.      The reason I would wait until day 2 or 3 to start scrubbing is that if she cut open a vein you do not want to reopen it.    I particularly like the wound dust with activated charcoal since it helps to absorb the bacterial toxins away from the tissue and in doing helps prevent proud flesh a little better.  Wonderdust is one such medicine.    The reason the vet can not do anything is that stitches in the foot never stay in.  Not does the glue they use hold together.  The skin is stretched to tight for that and when the animal moves it pulls back open.  Foot cuts also bleed a lot.  They bleed even when veins are not open.  It is because blood collects in the lower legs and is pumped out by the frog when the horse walks.    Also wounds are not supposed to be kept covered after the first 24 hours.  They need at LEAST 1 to 2 hours to dry each day to prevent build up of bacteria, particularly anaerobic bacteria.  Better to leave the wound uncovered.  This may not be an option if the horses are in constant mud or the wound can not be kept clean.  But if the ground is dry and the the horse can be kept out of the mud then this is the best solution.  It is also why wound powder tends to work better than salves in these conditions.  Powder dries the wound.|`|IMPvzBk1aa	You need to get medical attention for her.  What kind of vet would tell you there is nothing they can do?  That is ridiculous. Has she had a tetanus booster?  And she may need sytemic antibiotics in addition to wound care with a deep wound, which can develop an anaerobic infection. This wound should have been promptly flushed with antibiotics.  If your vet isn't interested, find one who is asap.  Once a full blown infection gets going, it is not easy to get under control.  I hope you flushed it well initially which would be important in preventing infection.  At this point, flushing with saline is the best treatment, and sterile gauze lightly wrapped over to keep debris out but let air in will help.  An ointment like EMT or Preparation H (the hemorrhoid ointment) will reduce pain, itching, and swelling and help promote healthy tissue formation.  Please get her a vet to provide a tetanus booster and some decent antibiotics.    EDIT.....Some of the advice you are receiving can be very harmful to your horse.  Here is a good article on the correct way to treat this wound....I do hope you will read it........note that  caustics like copper sulfate,  found in  Wonder Dust,  should never be used in wound care.  Here is an exerpt from the article........    "Petroleum-based products, such as Vaseline, are generally cautioned against because they tend to promote proud flesh. Caustics, such as copper sulfate, are murder on granulation tissue and have no place in wound healing; even as supposed treatments for proud flesh, they do more harm than good"    Research has changed the way wounds are treated as more and more knowledge has shown such products to destroy healing tissues and do  way more harm than any potential good.  Hydrogen peroxide is another old time favorite that has been found to destroy healthy tissue and promote infection, and is no longer ever used in open wounds by anyone with any degree of medical knowledge.  .  http://equisearch.com/horses_care/health...|`|meoRbjgCaa	My horse also did this.  I washed it out every day with water and would put mild pressure afterward to make sure no infection would build up.  You will smell it if it does. I then sprayed Blue-kote on it and mixed it with corona.  I covered it with a 4 x 4 cotton gauze and then kept it there (best I could) with vet wrap wrapped under and over the hoof and pastern (not too tight though, you could cut off circulation).  About 4-5 days into it I began allowing it to air dry a bit for a day every so often.  It healed fine and he is doing great.    However, a word of caution, mine might not have been as extensive as yours so you may have to care for it differently.  Every case is individual.  I would at least have a vet come and look at it and give you a schedule of what you can do for the best care.|`|8cikAYp3aa	keep it clean,  soak it in clear cool water from a running hose to help with swelling.  use a furozone ointment or salve on it and bandage it to keep it clean, change it daily.  its going to weep and drain.      Keep a eye out for foul smelling or yellowish green discharge.  that's infection and needs to be dealt with immediately .      After 14 days or so your going to need to watch for proud flesh.  That area is known for getting it when wounds heal.  by then you should be trying to keep the thing dry as much as possible with just a wipe of ointment    Call a second vet.  your first one is right in that stitching in that area is in all likely hood going to simply tear the skin and make things worse.   But they could have come by to make sure the blood flow in the foot was still intact if you think the vein was cut.  And a cut that deep should have prompted a shot of antibiotics just to be sure there was no infection|`|487pYnzraa	I would personally think that if we cant get the mare to sit down the whole day, maybe try not to let her walk too much and the wound will heal by itself slowly and in order not to accelerate the wound.    Another way that I could tink of is to put an iron/ smthng next to the foot (like those ppl with broken leg where usually a temp wood will be put to hold the bone) so that when she stands, her foot will not touch the ground, rather the wood/ iron is pressing the ground.. in that case there will be lesser pressure on foot thus will recover faster...ensure that it's not too high so that she wont fell down..     Though i do not have experience rearing a mare/horse.. I hope this can help!|`|ajj7ATyAaa	Find a different vet. You are absolutely right- no hoof, no horse.  And If it's that big of a wound, I would want the horse on antibiotics ASAP.  Also to do a thorough cleaning of it just in case it's deeper than you thought.    The last thing you want is for a wound to close over some foreign bit of dirt or bedding that you didn't know was in there.  Infection/abscess city.   More pain, more wound care, more scarring.   Horse should also probably have a tetanus booster.|`|bI7wMCJXaa	Maybe you should call a different vet. If they don't have anything useful to say call your farrier.|`|DoS1Ow2jaa	I agree i would be calling around to every vet i know that is terrible that they are not willing to do anything and not even come out and have a look what kind of vets are they????    I would be calling another vet right away or like the answer answer befor me your farrier!!    in the mean time keep it wrapped nice and tight keep her stabbled and comfortable with lots of fresh water and hay to nibble, what you are doing at the moment sounds good just keep it clean and dressed till you can find some one that can help you...    Hope i helped good luck let us all know how it goes|`|y7H1V39Jaa	I would clean it each day, keep it wrapped and clean and in a confined area, like a clean stall.  Keep her quiet if you have to trank her for a while.  Sometimes, depending on where the cut is, you can use pressure bandages to pull and keep the opening closed or partly closed as it heals.  Scarlet oil alternated with tea tree oil can not only help heal but help in the prevention of proud flesh.  Did the vet even come and look at your mare or did he diagnose her over the phone and decide that there was nothing he could do?  If you see proud flesh growing, (I know that this sounds gross), but you can cut it off yourself by using a safety razor, then the scarlet oil.  Good luck and I'm sorry that this happened to you.|`|vaulPrAmaa	nm you can do - if you have it put McNasty on the gauze so that she doesn't rip it off.  keep her rested and in a stall part of the day if you have to....change the gauze bout every week?  good luck!|`|OjeL1if4aa	First of all, just because one vet says they can't do anything it doesn't mean that there is nothing to be done... IMO call around and get a different vet. The wound needs to be flushed and sterilized. It's most likely too late for stitches and it's in a bad place anyways. But if she actually cut a vein the wound may be able to be cauterized (burned) to cut off the bleeding.    You'll want to clean it with betadine or iodine solution very well, then apply some antibacterial medication and wrap entire foot and up past the affected area. She'll need to be kept quiet and on stall/paddock rest until the wound heals... you'll also probably want to give her an anti-inflamitory like bute or asprine powder to help with any swelling and pain she might be experiencing.    I can't stress enough how important it is to get ahold of a vet and have her looked at though. She's young and healthy and will most likely recover fully, but she is at risk for serious infection if it's not cleaned/sterilized properly. The vet will most likely have to tranquilize her to clean it good... unless she's very mellow. I won't lie... it's not going to be cheap, but it's what needs to be done.    Good luck in what ever you choose to do.|`|q9Dg8BdFaa	1-Look to see if the horse has a cut that is bleeding. Apply light pressure to the cut using a clean,large,white gauze pad.    2-Clip the hair around the wound and clean it throughly using either betadine surgical scrub if handy, shampoo, or iodine. Apply an antibiotic wound powder such as Wonder Dust, if possible.    3-Use poultices, either homemade or store bought, to keep the wounds clean or ease the pain of an injury. To bandage the wound, apply several guaze pads over the wound, and cover them with one or more large quilted pads. Wrap the quilted pads with an elastic bandage, and make sure it is secure, but not so tight as to interfere with the circulation. Change the bandage every 2-3 days, and keep the WOUND CLEAN!    4-Treat swelling from a kick or a fall, have the horse stand still with the swollen leg in a bucket filled with Epsom Salts and lukewarm water. If the horse is fidgety and will not stand still, you can dip a quilted stable bandage in the epsom salt water and bandage the leg to reduce the swelling. After the horse has been standing with its leg or hoof in the bucket for about ten-thrity minutes, apply a poultice, either homemade or store bought to the swollen area.    5-Apply stable bandages , then elastic bandages to protect the leg. Let the horse reset for as long as it takes to heal!            Remember not to ride this horse until it's leg is complety healed. And if the cut is as deep as it sounds and it may hurt the horse when the salf and other medications are applied. So buy or make a twitch. I prefer to twist the lip to numb the horse but the shoulder point is somewhat good. Rinse the cut throughly with steamy hot water to disinfect any bacteria build up. And when scabbed over, check it ever day and rinse it throughly with steamy hot water also!But be careful, klnowing this horse may kick. But DO NOT punish it if it does. It's only responding to natural ablilities.  Hope this helps!And some of this stuff may need to be bought. So if you want your horse to get better and to ride another day. Please take responsibilities!=]|`|0kh2HEFMaa	http://www.healing-tree.com/Tea-ProEquin...    This works wonders. I just spray the cut with a hose, then spray this stuff on. Its pretty cheap too.|`|L2rivPUWaa	You need a vet asap. Not only to clean the wound but also administer antibiotics to stop infection. If the wound has opened a vein get the vet NOW if you want the horse to recover quicker.            http://www.horserides.org|`|5i8lDbXfaa	Is it on the back part of her pastern?    I ask because my horse has done this twice in the past year.  Here is what I did:    Everyday I cleaned it with some peroxide (you can dilute it with some water too).  Then I bought some Triple Anti-biotic Cream with Pain Reliever in it.  Then apply Wound Kote on top of that.   http://www.horse.com/Wound-Kote-BCA82.ht...  (let this dry for a few mins before wrapping)    Put that on and wrap the wound with gauze (or square cotton pads) and then vet wrap.  The flesh probably looks really pink and that needs to be protected from the mud, dirt and germs.      Do this routine everyday, try to put the cream on maybe twice a day.  Call another vet to get a second opinion.      I did this and my horse doesn't even have a scar. it does take a month or two before you can't notice anything.|`|TA4Bvp4Kaa	Call a vet   all the vets around your area   untill a good one comes up  they know what to do|`|YtBzRAxMaa	Derma Gel has worked wonders for me with a cut I thought needed stitches.    Yes there ARE spots on a horse where stitches would do more harm than good, this is one of them.   Keep it wrapped ( use an unscented sanitary napkin like a panty liner instead of gauze as the gauze may fray and stick to the wound)  and change the wrap at least once a day - both for cleanliness and to make sure you have not wrapped too tight. I would wrap the entire clean hoof and up over the fetlock (ankle) to help keep it in place.   You may need a wedge of wood cut on an angle to stop her from moving her hoof - farriers can usually help with this.   Keep her stalled to minimize her re opening the cut. Keep her stall as clean as possible with deep bedding (again to minimize any flexion of her foot)   I'd also get a tetnus shot and an antibiotic (penicillan?) going.   She may need bute for the pain - but I would keep the dose low so she does not feel SO good she re injurs herself!   This will take a while to heal up - she'll need a hay ney and a buddy in the barn with her to help keep her calm.   Good luck!|`|mKWwz1uUaa	Maybe try another vet, but in the mean time to stop the bleeding hose with cold water to shrink the blood vessels, use some "quick stop" or wonder dust, once the bleeding is stopped, apply nitrofurazon, three times a day, keep wrapped not to tight, keep in don't turn out, keep quite, no grain, just hay, also no matter what the vet should give antibiotics at least!  Best of luck my thoughts r with you.  Also would recomend to use rubber mats in the stahl, and straw no wood chips or pellets.|`|I5PwCwERaa	Look into a product called green clay.  it is a healing clay that you mix with water and sread it on to cleaned wound, this stuff is AMAZING!!!!  IT works wonders,and I have seen it in person, and couldn't believe how fast the wound actually healed,!  It's worth looking in to , good luck
f1bc84bbc8f80702f7871dd9f28476c0aa	he is fine, those are milk chocolate and he is a big fella, he is just fine, nothing to worry about, he probably won't even throw it up, it is more peanut butter and sugar than chocolate anyway.  :)|`|cFpHsqNBaa	It depends on the dog. My dog has eaten Chocolate before and been fine. If you think that he is going to be hurt from it you can give him a tablespoon of hydrogen peroxide and that will make him puke. Get prepared though because my dog was all over the house when I had to give her that all because she ate a pill. Watch him closely for about 20 minutes and see how he acts. If you think he needs the emergency vet don't hesitate.|`|Dunc379maa	Allot more than most people think. My three dogs steal chocolate out of the candy bowl all of the time when I am not looking. They eat it like its steak or something. Despite the bogus ungrounded, non-fact based rumors, chocolate is not any worse for dogs than it is for humans. My dogs have been stealing chocolate for years and they are all over 11 years of age. I have done much study on this subject and dogs can eat chocolate even though it is not recommended that they eat it on a consistent basis. In fact I cannot tell you how many times when I went to pick up the poop off the backyard grass that the undigested silver aluminum foil wrapper is still in the poop from the Hersey's kisses.|`|ijDgKdcxaa	A dog or cat should never be allowed to eat chocolate!  Ask your dog's vet for further information.|`|KYC0pmH6aa	That won't kill him, my yorkie ate that much. But if he suddenly changer in mood or throws up, take him to the vet.|`|HS5ZSdd0aa	Don't worry, take a deep breath your dog will be fine.  it is not the chocolate that is bad for dogs but the caffeine associated with the chocolate.  Your dog would have to eat 2 pans of brownies before I would be to worried.  My 30 lbs hound ate an entire pan and he was fine.    I would expect maybe diarrhea.  Watch the stools you might see some wrappers in them.  If you don't, don't panic you probably didn't see them.    They will most likely pass.  If he does get bloody stools and/or vomiting and keep any food in his system tomorrow, I would call the vet.      But relax there is a 99% your dog will be perfectly fine.  (You have just learned your lesson no to put candy where he can reach it)|`|t2M1kXY4aa	There's no "safe" amount of chocolate for a dog to eat, but milk chocolate and a big dog will be better than dark chocolate with a small dog.    Your dog will probably be all right, but don't be surprised if he pukes it up and gets the runs.    As long as he seems OK, he probably IS OK ... but if he seems sick, please call the vet.|`|okdPuy1Kaa	It's never worth the risk to "wait and find out" if the amount he ate was toxic!!!|`|C59bTKO2aa	I doubt that your dog got enough chocolate to hurt him at all.  At least you know now that things on the counter are not out of his reach, and that he will get into it given the opportunity.  So now, your job is to remove the opportunity.  Dogs will keep you on your toes!|`|L22hVXTIaa	Three things in your favor.  Your dog is very big, the candies were small, and they are mostly peanut butter which isn't bad for dogs.  With that said, keep an eye on him.  If he seems ill, or starts vomit ting, diarrhea, etc. call the vet, but I don't think he got enough chocolate to make him sick.
283f865e237ea72119b132f652eb514baa	that large one is the kind we use at our shelter. I think it is a great idea! kittens can get into too much trouble when left out to play all night, they can also get hurt or get into dangerous stuff or chew cords. If you can afford it then get the big one (three shelves, 4 doors) there is plenty of room in them for food dishes, bed, toys, and a litter box. Great idea! It will be worth every penny!|`|Mxq1NQJdaa	That does look wonderful and a great solution to your dilemma.|`|70878cc978ee2e4a79b3b53284340f9caa	It would be fine.I often cage kittens so they stay out of trouble.As long as she has food,water,a litter box and toys to entertain her,she will be fine- and safe.|`|nktIqi6raa	i don't see anything wrong with it. my parents used to have a cat (he had to be put down due to cancer) that has his own kennel. He had to go in it at night or when we were all leaving, when he got older  he started spraying (he was fixed) if left out at night. He has his own litterbox, food and watter dish, he loved it, he would ask to go in it at night if we didn't put him up when he watned to. if we left the door open he would go in and sleep during the day, he would only eat from his food and water dish, and got so he would only use that litter box.     the other cats got jelous, and would sneak into his cage when ever they could to eat his food and use his box.|`|vhEp3PeJaa	You're on the right track! My mother in law fosters kittens quite frequently, and what she did was purchase a standing bird cage from craigslist, and put some extra carpet she had in the bottom, a long with a small litter box, and some toys and a bed and the kittens adore it!     She made some shelves so that they could climb around, and it's worked perfectly.     http://lh5.ggpht.com/_F9RTFfHePN8/SG06cA...    the one she got looks kind of like this except smaller. You can useually find them for about 20 dollars on craigslist used, just make sure you clean them and if you want spray paint it to match your daughters bedroom. Also, make sure that the bars are close enough that she can't get her little head stuck in it.    Have you considered putting the kitten in the bathroom at night? I ended up having to do that with a cat i had, until she got old enough to where she just slept through the night, and didn't bother the other animals.    Hope this helps!|`|DZedvrIraa	oh yeah that would be fine!! dont worry about it...|`|sOkePjK3aa	just buy a kitty crate, much cheeper and cats can get out of playpens|`|fIsjIMZHaa	I have one for my cats at night.  They actually like it and go in when ever they want during the day (to nap eat ect) It also solved them peeing on my clothes at night.  I have a 3 tier one for my 2 cats.  It has a scratching post a hammock 2 beds 2 food bowls 2 water bowls, tons of toys, and a litter box
e9gXZsKxaa	Check your water quality, it may be ammonia poisoning..|`|OaaJ7o9Haa	He sounds healthy and not sick, however the red streak does sound like ammonia poisoning, which can cause permanent damage. Your cleaning routine does sound very studious though and I commend you. However, increase your water changes to perhaps 15-20% every other day just to keep the ammonia down.    There are many symptoms of ammonia poisoning such as red gills, red streaks and gasping for air at the surface. Keep taking good care of him, but a slightly larger tank with a filter may be a better option if you can afford it. Good luck. :)|`|YnCUyvK7aa	This wouldn't be septicemia which is a bacterial infection.  The infection would always be present, not come and go.    Although I wouldn't claim to be an expert in fish physiology, I do know they change their color in response to things around them, like getting pale when they're stressed or the lights are turned off.  If he seems to be in good health otherwise, and there aren't any raised ammonia levels in the tank, I would consider that this might be the equivalent of a person getting mad and their face flushing before they started a fight.  That seems to fit your situation when you see the color "these red streaks only become visible when he sees me or starts to go crazy ".    The fins are lighter colored or transparent for his coloration, making the blood vessels easier to see, so if he gets more active, the blood would be pumped harder, and the blood vessels would dilate, making the fins look redder.

YnCUyvK7aa	The red tail may get territorial and act aggressive to any fish in its territory, but the others are fine together.    I'd add more ottos, as these are a schooling fish.  At least 2 more.  But because they're more bottom fish, it's the ottos and bristlenose that will have the most trouble from the red tail.  It might be in your best interests and those of your smaller fish, to find the red tail a new home.|`|w4DIPHf1aa	The shark may eat most of the fry and he will harass most of the fish but thats his nature.    Otto's really need company they are social and travel in schools of thousands in the wild. I would get at least 1 or 2 more.    other than that enjoy...|`|J3IOlhd8aa	Yes, I see no reason why not. You could add a few more community fish also.    Don't forget to cycle your tank for two or three weeks prior to adding the fish  good luck|`|SY5JQX69aa	uhhh probably    but you should really go to a pet store & ask.    try a website & call if you dont want to drive to one. (:|`|32uGH3cVaa	the rule of thumb is.   one gallon per inch of fish!   you'll be fine! :)   enjoy your fishyssss ^_^|`|00304d9ffa531ceed89bafb4bfe8b6f0aa	I think that is a great setup just make sure you buy a good filter! Don't use rocks with epoxy coating use aquarium rocks that are really rocks. This is the best brand for filters just make sure to get one for your tank capacity I would recommend doubling it or getting two. For you if you can afford it get a filter for  a 100 gallon tank. The best filters pull water from  your aquarium and go through several filter medias and pump it back in. Try to feed your fish a mixture of frozen foods flake and freeze dried foods especially if you want to breed fish.
bI7wMCJXaa	Like your mom said, let him get in shape at the 3' and then go up a few inches at a time and see how he does. I've seen 15H horses take 4'+ jumps and I had a 17H+ Warmblood that wouldn't do two feet. It all has to do with their conformation and attitude.|`|DdpvxfkNaa	I have a young Arab too he is 15.1hh and 9 years old, we have currently been jumping 3' with ease. But I would say get him in shape and train him to go higher. Arabs can go up to 4' and especially if he is a mix with long legs he can do it too with training. But take it slow and maybe get some x-rays if you could. They can determine if he can jump higher without hurting himself. and maybe put shoes on him if he is going to jump higher. Hope this helps :)|`|LrYcvGgiaa	You can slowly inch it up as he is going well at one height, just take it slowly.      My mare is 15.2, and she can't jump at all... trotting poles is all she likes to do... my last horse was a 17.2 TB and he could jump 5'4"... it totally depends on the horse and yours could go really high if you take it slowly and don't rush things with him.     Good luck!|`|vaulPrAmaa	every horse is different, just add up the numbers slowly.  If you work hard enough and slow enough, you'll get it going well ;)|`|0aLLvdqFaa	Just Work You Way Up And When It Feels Like He Is Struggling Or His Attitude To Being Ridden Changes, Stop  It All Depends On The Horse|`|OjeL1if4aa	I agree with GOOODD. I've seen my fair share of 15hh horses jumping 4'+. It all depends on his conformation and ability. Once he's used to the 3' and in shape there, start adding a 3'3" or two fence to your courses and go from there.    You'll know when he's really having to work to clear something or if he's not liking the height.    Have fun and good luck!|`|L0iFXjH6aa	Well i have a 13.1 that can jump 4.3 so it is just up to you and the way your horses jumps some will just keep on jumping and others will get to a certain height and will not jump any Higher    Hope this help XBitzX
zRXkkh0Maa	Put their cages side by side for about two weeks and try putting them together. See if they are scared or if they fight. If nothing happens, then it is fine, if something happens, then seperate them again fro another week, if nothing still changes then that's the end.     Good Luck!|`|2bZMxMitaa	Put them in the same room alone in two separate cages. Every day move the cages closer and closer together and then take them out of the cages so they can see each other. If they both end up in one cage, then there ya go! :D  If not, then just see if they'll both stay in one cage, but any bickering then take them out right away because if a cockatiel just give a playful nip, it could kill the budgie. Hope I helped!|`|FGn8okQQaa	You don't yet.  You quarantine the parakeet in a separate room away from the cockatiel for at least 30 days and get it checked by an avian vet because you need to make sure it doesn't have a contagious illness (since birds don't like to show when they're sick, so it could look healthy and still be sick).  Once the parakeet is confirmed to be healthy, then you can move it into the same room as the cockatiel.
zXzbWmybaa	i see what you mean...lol reading other peoples answers to this is quite funny! very few people actully answered you!    I think its mostly because of the points..people are trying to get as many points as they can so they just write anything, and also most people just want to sound smart...like that other guy said!, so they just write a whole bunch of nonsense that doesnt really make sense...unless of course they just cut and paste from a google search lol|`|m0e3a3gWaa	Bottom line is most people on this site simply don't know the answer.  People buy a 10 gallon tank and talk with a Petsmart employee for 5 minutes and they are suddenly a fish expert.  This is evident by looking at posted questions about a Betta or a 10 gallon tank.  Questions like that will get 15-20 answers.  Post a question about a 200 gallon tank and you are lucky if you get 2!|`|J3IOlhd8aa	Because lots of people try to be smart, but are not. Also for the points|`|e9gXZsKxaa	I find this offensive as I always answer the questions asked, you are assuming, which makes you an @$$.|`|c159efe1b44ee4b1b369d779c1d19521aa	Ha Ha! People like an opportunity to get up on their soapboxes and give their two cents even when you didn't ask for it!|`|qGWj3EVPaa	Well maybe since you don't have a picture they won't answer because everyone wants the asker to choose them for the best answer so they get 10 pts and by not having a picture it sends the message that your a new member and don't know what to do|`|tDcItiATaa	Well i do see that too, but i will not answer anything myself unless i feel i can be a contribution!  I feel that my answers are on the ball?..|`|vSUfNm1Zaa	problem is not with our ans dude its ur silly question for which reader couldnt stop to laugh like now what u have asked      ..............|`|eaa7ea7ca05d6d4a3f86eb39b32a5cb9aa	I would love to answer your question and assist you in any way possible but there is no question here. Post a question and I will do my best to help.|`|YnCUyvK7aa	I do try to answer the questions that are asked, but sometimes I [and others] see something in the information that's in the question which has the potential to cause a problem that maybe the person asking isn't aware of.    As an example, someone might ask how often they will need to clean their goldfish's bowl.  They're just looking for a number of days to go between cleanings.  But I see a fish that's capable of growing over a foot long, and that produces a great amount of wastes that's being kept in a container of a size that in a few months it won't be able to turn around in.  So I feel obligated to mention that as a part of the answer I give.    Another reason is that there are a lot of young people who use Answers, not just this category, who'll post something [right or wrong] just to get the 2 points.  Some even just post "thanks for the 2 points" without even giving an answer.  And others who just try to be *clever* in what they say.    What you're saying extends beyond Answers into life.  Several of the people in my neighborhood are teachers, and I hear them say the same about their classes - ask a question on a test, and the students will tell you all sorts of information, but sometimes it's not what they asked about.  I guess that some just feel the need to tell you what they know [or think they do] or *what happened to their fish* rather than having to answer what you asked.    But to be perfectly fair, there are a lot of people here who do give good answers, and sometimes the people who ask the questions only choose answers by what they want to hear, or that go by outdated myths about fishkeeping, or *what they were told at the pet store*, rather than what's best for their fish.  So this can go both ways, there are people who ask questions, but then ignore the best advice.      If you read the Yahoo! Answers disclaimer http://answers.yahoo.com/info/disclaimer they don't say anything about quality of the answers you'll get, or even the quantity.|`|e54TCBKiaa	this post will not get you the answer you are seeking.    THe ones that give randomly off answers are generally "trolls" to flame random users to try n get them mad or are peoples answering to just get points without even looking at the question.  Then there are also those that attempt to sound smar twith no real knowledge of it and are just making anything they feel like up.    So by putting this here.  You won't get trolls since theres no real question to make a crude answer to.  Like if you asked "what should i feed my pet" and a troll came in and said "you shoudl feend him poop"    you might get random people coming in making any answer up,b ut of course that wont answer this question.    You wont get peoples making up answers like they know something, since there is no real question, other than the heading question    So the only people that will probably answer you heading question thats nto really a question are the people who actually take time to answer, that will get offended by this.  Although some peoples take their answers a bit too far i must admit o.O but still they will get offended any ways.    I guess i sorta in a way just answered ur heading question with the 3 different type of peoples who will answer your question without really answering it.|`|WBopwqTGaa	i dunno about the others but i try and answer the best i can to help people but i guess if the answer you're looking for isnt there than its possible you're asking the wrong question|`|QyP0hDkJaa	People are normally very helpful..

OjeL1if4aa	Personally, at level 1 and 2, even higher... I wear a nice polo (t-shirt with collar) shirt, breeches and boots... generally, my horse's pad will match my polo shirt and sometimes his boots, depending on the level and the type of boots I wear. Level 1 and 2 generally aren't a big deal for us so I'll just wear polo wraps for a bit of extra support, but nothing to over-do it. Bigger, tougher jumps I always wear splints or open front jumping boots for maximum protection.    I know of a lot of big time show barns who also follow this (polo shirts in the jumper ring) and unless it's a medal or money class wear nice, but casual clothes. I know for USEF recognized shows, you have to wear your full outfit for medal or money classes... but for regular open classes it doesn't matter. You aren't judged on your outfit... and though there are limits (I don't think you can wear tank tops or sleeveless) you don't have to be fully dressed. The horse is the only thing being judged... on time and faults.    I used to always show in my full outfit, unless it got too warm and we could remove our jackets, no matter the show or level. Then I got a new trainer who taught me different and actually frowned on wearing full outfits at schooling shows. All of his students wear polo shirts for jumper classes... unless of course it's a medal or money class.    This is for the Northwest... but I can't imagine there would be a huge difference in region as far as that goes, especially considering most shows follow USEF guidelines.|`|qdtU1Q1Laa	Yes, you can use colors, but don't overdo it! I use a white with blue piping saddle pad, blue/gray fly veil, browband, polo shirt [[ as long as they're not sleeveless and your not doing a medal class, they're fine to wear ]], etc. Just don't overdo it by using a whole pink saddle pad; it looks more professional for it to be mainly white.     Well I hope this helps and good luck!|`|DdpvxfkNaa	Normally in Jumpers you can wear colors. Especially your horse, saddle pad and that doesn't matter. But, I have heard that polo shirts that are nice are aloud but to be safe...look in the rule book or go safe with full attire. Good luck and hope this helps!|`|bI7wMCJXaa	Look into the USEF H/J rules. They are very specific about what is allowed and what isn't. Colors are usually reserved for clubs and teams.    A word of advice: You want the judge looking at the rider with the nice equitation on the nice pleasure horse, not the chick in the pink coat. If you're wearing pink and everyone else is wearing more somber colors you're going to stick out in a bad way.
4zp6Uz2Haa	It's probably a stain from licking versus being a "poopstain"   Licking and tears cause stains on white animals...Use Angel Eyes or some other stain remover and it should come out.  Also bathe her in a whitening shampoo. And don't let her lick her bum to prevent the stain from even being there.  Poo won't stain the hair.  Another thing you can do for longer haired dogs is to keep their behinds trimmed so that they don't get dingle berries....(I love that word LOL)|`|AA10412922	Try a whitening shampoo like white on white,but leave it on longer than the recommended 10 mins before rinsing it out|`|F17bGTAOaa	Feed it to a Rottweiler - poop stain disappears immediately|`|f1bc84bbc8f80702f7871dd9f28476c0aa	Try Angel Eyes for dogs, it is for tear stains and food stains around the mouth, but you put it on their food rather than wash them with it, so since they eat it it changes chemicals in their system, so it very well may help with the feces stains.  It will not help with the feces getting stuck however, they only way to help with that would be to keep her hair trimmed under her tail and any areas where she is getting it stuck.  Good luck, I know it is a bothersome problem, and she can't help it either.    Edit:  whomever is giving me thumbs down is clearly not educated enough to know that feces will not stain, it is some type of secretion, and Angel Eyes works from the inside out.  Getting a thumbs down from people that have no clue just really irritates me to no end.|`|K5ZWi2Mhaa	Oxyclean or Resolve carpet cleaner|`|wGsVO2iNaa	First I give my dog a bath and then I trim the hair off from around her butt.
Ei85kgfdaa	Do no alpha roll your dog, that is an old and disproven method and a good way to get yourself bitten.    Don't allow her to grab sticks, when you see her going for one tell her to 'leave it'. Its a very handy command that she should learn, regardless of the situation.
MzHwklzKaa	Skip goldfish.  They're more trouble than their worth.      They each need 20 gallons all to themselves, yes, even the little feeders.  They grow!!  Those feeders will be 6-8 inches long someday.  Far, far too big for a 10 gallon.    If you want cheap fish, get rosy red minnows.  They're feeders too, and you can get them for about 25 cents each.  They're pretty and stay small.    If you want something fancy, look at Leopard and Zebra Danios.  They're about 99 cents last time I was at Petco.    Remember that "cleaner" fish are also pooping in the water.  They're also more trouble than their worth, because they make almost as much mess as they clean.    Skip "cleaner fish".  Get yourself a gravel vacuum, follow the directions once or twice a month and call it clean.|`|AA11708471	10 gallons is too small for a single goldfish and most plecos     goldfish are coldwater and plecos are tropical so they dont match|`|SZOMVGBRaa	A gravel vacuum. All Plecos do is eat algae not gold fish waste. They need to be feed algae tablets and actually produce more waste and do mare harm than good. GOLDFISH ARE NOT EASY FISH TO TAKE CARE OF. Just thought I would let you know they produce ALLOT of waste and need huge tanks. Look them up before you buy them. If you want something to go good in a 10 gallon tank as an only fish look into the Salvini Cichlid. Good Choice due to its hardiness and it only grows to about 6 inch's. It does however require a heater. Just like your goldfish though In about a years time he will need a 20-30 gallon.  Good Luck|`|J3IOlhd8aa	Some type of Bristle nose can live with gold fish, the main thing is to get something that is compatible within the gold fishes temperature range. Pond snails will work great|`|vDB5sI9faa	in my 31.6 gallon tank i have one gold fish and one chinese algae eater and they seem fine Maybe some Cory's if you mean left over food not algae|`|e9gXZsKxaa	They don't match because goldfish are coldwater and plecos are tropical fish. First off, goldfish need huge tanks. 10 gallon isn't even enough for one goldfish.|`|eqTrMY1Vaa	If nothing else, you are looking at a tank you will have to clean constantly. Also, the tanks sounds a bit small, and you may end up have to give atleast one of them away (probably the pleco), because it will get over crowded. Maybe think of shrimp or clams to help with the waste.
d2b13247b0a080e166b6ef614a4f6a7daa	It sounds to me like you're describing the dew claws, which I guess sort of look like where the thumb would be. If your dog is constantly breaking them, I would suggest you have them surgically removed. Most breeders have this done before they give their puppies away, but obviously in some cases some don't bother. My dogs are an example of that. However, in their case, the dew claws cause no problems. Some dogs dew claws are attached very loosely, which sounds like your dog. Other than surgery, I would say keep them clipped blunt so they don't catch on anything.|`|pYpXj7gOaa	mal nutrition, he isent getting enough nutrients in his diet try switching foods.  i suggest science diet|`|WYIIpO3gaa	put bandaid
r9wrDGm2aa	Around 4-5 weeks along she will get a bigger, harder tummy. The most popular signs are hard tummy, puppy movement at about 5 weeks along, eating more, being more picky, peeing more due to enlarged uterus, digging, getting lazier, laying around more, and a possible temperament change. The first signs don't come until about 4 weeks along sometimes later. I really need to warn you that chihuahuas due mostly to their size often have birthing complications that if not dealed with correctly can lead to death of the pup and/or the mom. You need to know how to take care of your dog and know how to tell she is ready for labor so you can be with her. You also need to know what to expect during labor so if something goes wrong you can call the vet. Sometimes the situation is too serious to waste precious time to call and wait for the vet so it would be a good idea to know what to do in certain situations. Answers to all these and more on whelping/stages of whelping you can find on http://www.hilltopanimalhospital.com/rep...   Your dog can show all the signs of pregnancy and not be pregnant sometimes. It is called false pregnancy and it can now be ruled out by getting a test at the vet called repro check.

The usual gestation period is two months for dogs.

You will need to go a few times especially near the end because many Chihuahua's have difficult births and may need an assisted birth. (C-section) Their heads are so large that they often become lodged in the birth canal.    EDIT:  If you did not breed her on purpose, please look into getting her fixed. It really sounds like you were not prepared for this possibility and there are a lot of dogs that need homes. I rescued a breeder Chihuahua who had 10 litters in 6 years.

Yvdg31WGaa	You might want to start her out with a very soft plush toy you can get from the dollar store.. your dog may not like the hardness of some of these toys. She may not even be used to playing with toys.   She might have been abused when she chewed up some stuff  :( so you have to reteach her it's OK to chew up her toys.  Playing Keep away is fun for most dogs, Praise her a lot when she plays with her toys.   She will have a lot more fun once she realizes that she can without getting in trouble. :)  Good Luck.|`|E5gaKzCsaa	You're doing the right stuff so far. At least you're getting some exercise out of it! Sometimes you have to try different toys till you find what the dog likes. But some dogs just don't get toys. If they were never given any and shown that toys can be fun when they were young, some of them never catch on. I had one like that once, for 8 years. He just never played with toys, and I tried. Also, if the dog is new to you it might take a while for her to settle in and feel completely comfortable with you. Try a squeaky toy, try stuffed animals, try a frisbee, try a laser pointer.|`|qa4gjD52aa	Put the toy in with him to sleep some animals just don't like toys right away because they don't have their sent on them. You could also try peanut butter! It's messy but it works.|`|LrYcvGgiaa	You could try not leaving the toys laying around the house all the time... only bring them out and do the 'crazy things' with the toys, without letting the dog actually have them.  After a few days try again to get her to play with them, if she's been watching you play with them for those few days she may be more interested.    It takes patience, it took our rescue about 2 weeks to learn to play fetch and it was a pretty slow process.
Y8ssQvCKaa	You should have neutered him before you even thought of letting him out.    Why do you think he was pawing at the door, really? Because he still has the urge to go and mate with females. And an unfixed Tom can roam for miles looking for a female or females to get it on with; reguardless of the weather. They'll also get into fights with other Toms, so he may come back with a few battle scars. Cats, especially unfixed ones, don't understand the concept of 'come outside with mummy for a few minutes'. As soon as they're outside, they're a different animal.    As for him dying, I doubt it. As domesticated as cats are, they still have fur and instincts for a reason, and these help them survive cold weather. I had to put my cat out in the snow last night (in the UK) and he gave me the most annoyed look imaginable, but trotted off and came in this morning, as right as rain, shaking snow off his fur. No, he wasn't very happy- but he wasn't hurt or ill, either, let alone dead.|`|n7bok7NRaa	He might come back. Some cats can remember where they live. But I would have picked a much better day to let him out - where it wasn't cold (which can hide the scent of things), and after leash-training him in his own yard so he knows his bearings a little better.    Cats will seek shelter when they get cold - but it's not uncommon for cats to wander around even in weather as cold as you describe (I have woken to fresh paw prints outside my home, even when it's been about as cold as your place is).    I don't know when he might come back - he may never. It's good he's got a collar - hopefully someone will find him.|`|0xxaDrRXaa	Don't panic. I'm sure you know that cats have fur and that keeps them warm. I have a cat (a few years old) that goes outside and stays out there for over half of the day. He survived a severe thunder storm, blizzards, attacks with other animals, and he was able to survive through below frezzing temperatures. Cats have great senses. They can see, smell, and hear things very well. As long as there aren't any big animals (like bears) in your area, your cat should be fine. I hope you find your cat.|`|rJJhMQ37aa	He will come home when he's finished, and when he gets good and ready to come home.    Get him fixed, for heaven's sake!

And why is he not neutered? When he comes home,keep him in,and then get him neutered,he won't care about going outside then.|`|4aAhEK9daa	Yes, it's very possible for him to die out there.  Why on earth after keeping him indoors for a year and a half would you let him out?  And when the weather was BELOW FREEZING?  And you let him unaltered?  It's never "too cold" for a cat to mate.  Give me a break.  Why haven't you bothered to get him neutered????    If he hasn't frozen to death odds are he's been hit by a car, eaten by a wild animal or maybe got into a fight with other cats over a female and is lying somewhere slowly bleeding to death.  Or maybe he went to jump over a fence and caught the stupid collar you put on him and was strangled to death.  I doubt you had the sense to put a breakaway collar on him, right?     But if he's lucky he's simply been taken in by someone else - which would be the BEST thing for this cat considering how irresponsible his owner is!!!!|`|pnZB0uBFaa	nooo!|`|vaulPrAmaa	no, cat's have fur.  if he was cold he'd come home, and if he was lost he'd bug someone else.  dont worry - be happy!|`|54hVzylRaa	He is out looking for ladies of the evening. He will be back to eat, then take him to be neutered. That way if he gets out again at least he won't be adding to the pet population.|`|sYyNyjwuaa	My cat was not fixed and ran outside all the time. He won't freeze and he'll be fine even in that temperature (they're resilient) but the things you NEED to be worried about are his fighting habits. Male cats that are unfixed love to fight with other male cats. That's how my cat got an infection and I had to put him to sleep. I felt I an obligation to tell you, please keep him inside or get him fixed. They get cysts and infections along with FIV (Feline Aids) and possible Feline Leukemia which is fatal. I don't want another cat dying from the same mistake I made..    Really though, he will be fine and he'll be meowing at your back door when he's ready to come in.
vhEp3PeJaa	This is infact kind of weird. It might be easier for her to eat off the floor, because of the lip to the bowl. If may be that it's easier for her 'dominate' the food when it's on the floor, against your other animals.  Try getting a plastic place matt, and putting it down on the floor, and then putting a cup saucer down to and putting the food on the cup saucer. You could also try putting her food up a little higher, such as on a desk or or a table, and putting it on a saucer, but that just dpends on how you feel about her being on tables and desks.|`|8TOmJ2BLaa	maybe she doesn't like the food that u give her|`|IuYekkPVaa	Many cats don't like eating out of a bowl if their whiskers touch the sides because it's an uncomfortable sensation.

Here is an ear cleaning solution that will clear up any infection or fungus in a dog's ears and will keep the ears clean, and dry.    Warning:  Do not use this ear cleaning solution on dogs with ruptured ear drums, or on dogs with open sores or wounds in the ear area.  An ear exam by a veterinarian is recommended prior to beginning treatment with this ear cleaning solution.     Here's what you need to buy:      The ingredients you'll need are white vinegar, powdered boric acid, isopropyl alcohol (rubbing alcohol), and Betadine antiseptic solution.  Generic versions of the Betadine are known as Povidone-Iodine, and those are fine, too.  Just be sure not to use "Betadine Scrub", which is Betadine with a detergent added.  What you want is "Betadine Solution" or generic "Povidone-Iodine Solution".    The first time we looked for the boric acid and the Betadine, we had no clue where to find it...  but our local Pharmacist was happy to point us in the right direction.  They used to keep boric acid in stock out in the pharmacy section of drug stores and you could buy it "over the counter".  Recently, it's gotten a little harder to get after the regulations got tightened regarding selling it...  since boric acid can be used to manufacture illegal drugs.  These days, you usually won't find it just sitting out on the shelf of your local drug store.  You usually do have to ask the pharmacist for it.       You'll also need an empty bottle to store your ear cleaning solution in, and from which you will squirt the solution in to your dog's ear.  We recommend use of a plastic bottle with a long applicator snout, and with markings on the outside that show fluid levels in ounces.  This makes it very easy to measure the ingredients as you pour them in to the bottle.  A great place to find these is at beauty supply stores, as they are commonly used for hair-coloring solutions.     Here are the directions for mixing the solution together.  Be sure to follow them in the order listed...  I'll spare you the explanation of the chemistry involved, but trust me...  to get the boric acid to dissolve properly, you need to do it exactly like this:    Pour 6 ounces of isopropyl alcohol in to your applicator bottle.  (This is where those ounce measuring lines on the outside of the bottle really come in handy.)  Next, add 1/2 tablespoon of boric acid powder.  An easy way to do that is to measure the powder, dump it on to a piece of paper, fold the paper in half and use the paper as a funnel to get the powder in to the plastic applicator bottle.  Be careful not to get any boric acid on your skin or clothing.  If you do, wash it off immediately.    Shake the solution up really well, until the boric acid powder is fully dissolved.  Next, add 2 ounces of white vinegar.  Shake it up some more.  Finally, add one teaspoon of the generic Betadine antiseptic, and shake it some more.  The solution should take on coloring similar to ice tea.  Be careful not to get any of the Betadine on your skin or clothing.  If you do, wash it off immediately.    That's it!  You're ready to move on to the hardest part now...  getting your dog to let you squirt this stuff inside the ear canal.    Applying this in to your dog's ears is usually easiest if you have a two-person team...  one to hold the dog still with the ear up and out of the way, and the other person to squirt the solution in to the ear.  All you have to do is squirt it in there until you have completely filled the ear canal with cleaning solution.  But don't let go of the dog quite yet.  Fold the ear back down over the ear canal, and use your hand to rub things around so that the ear cleaning solution gets sloshed around inside there pretty well.  Keep the dog still for a minute or so...  because as soon as you let go, the dog's going to shake his head, and a lot of that cleaning solution is going to go flying out.  If you get any of the ear cleaning solution on your skin, wash it off as soon as possible.     If you don't have someone who can help you hold the dog while you apply the cleaning solution, an alternative is to use a grooming table with a noose.  The noose will keep the dog's head immobilized enough for you to do the job yourself.    Apply the cleaning solution to your dog's ears daily until you start to see some improvement.  Once things get better, you can cut back to once a week...  and when you're fully satisfied with the condition of the ear you can go two weeks between treatments.  The ear cleaning solution can be stored at room temperature and, as far as I know, does not go bad with time.     One little tip:  your dog won't object to you squirting this stuff in his ear so much if you make sure the solution is warmed up to body temperature first.  They hate it when you squirt cold liquid in their ears!  Don't use the microwave oven to heat the solu|`|BhXOLas1aa	Don't responsible dog owner see a vet?

AA10192697	My dwarf hamster lived past 3 yrs.     Sounds like he might have a knot in his intestine or have feces backed up into his intestines.  Has he pooped lately?  Clean his cage and keep an eye on the amount of his poop, if you can.  If he isn't pooping normal, he might be constipated or something worse.  Honestly, you can bring him to a vet. It cost me $45 to find out that one of mine had wet tail.  It was odd to pay that amount for a $10 hamster but I love animals.    Or you can all a vet's office or an animal hospital and seek advice.  Take his food out for several hours and only let him drink water.  This might sound odd to others, but if you can hold him gently and gently rub his tummy with your finger for a few minutes. This might help him move his bowels. Or at least might help ease some of his pain.  If he seems in too much pain, stop then.      Hope this helps some.  If he is dying, just make his time comfortable. I have lost 3 hamsters over the years and I held them all while they died.

If it starts to ooze, or smell or she does start to limp she's going to have to be seen by a vet, but for now, don't worry, she's taking care of it herself.|`|AA11890009	best thing wud be to consult a vet ASAP.but 4 d tym being,kp keeping the place clean.apply some antiseptic lotion like betadine..and let ur cat kp licking.their saliva has medicinal properties for them|`|TPTpwarwaa	Sounds like it's infected, what i would do is start peroxiding it every day and night-she will not like this at all, but make sure you talk to her in a calm voice and keep saying it will help her or anyting like that, just comfort her, and put some type of neosporin on it with a ace bandage around it (or try to keep it on). Try not to have her lick at it, since it will make it worse.  If it does get really infected, calling up a vet and telling them your situation will help-they will give you information and maybe even give you antibiotics w/o an appt.  Or look it up online also
BA3y6MBlaa	I'm pretty sure your dog does not suffer this problem or you wouldn't be asking the question.  Many dogs go the "silent but deadly" route, which is unmistakable and will clear the room.  Others, are loud and practically musical offenders, and they'll likely look up, attempt an embarrassed look and fall back to sleep.  They can also be deadly, but a kiss and a "you stinky goofball" hug is the likely response.  Warn people entering the room, bless their stinky hearts.    If you are not having a problem, which it seems you are not, continue to feed them the same diet.  It seems to work.  If they are pooping good solid stuff (easy to clean), definitely do not change their diet.      If you are afraid they in pain because of gas, relax, I really, with all my heart, don't think that is the case with you.|`|Q9ImkWRJaa	dont worry this isnt a stupid question to me, cause when i think of gas, i dont think of just farts. i think of like internal like chest pain..     but then again, i dont know how anyone would be able to detect gas in a dogs chest so yea, i guess it is sort of silly.    p.s. dont talk about gas or farts in your home? an average person farts 8 times a day, ease up a little bit.|`|zTSZgP3jaa	If your sitting in a room and suddenly it stinks. Your dog probably farted unless you fart and don't know it. Sometimes changing their diet will work, but my friends have a bulldog and no matter what they feed him, he farts non stop. Literally...|`|wZzWmXU0aa	if your dog has gas you will know! his fart will make you leave the room! lol. believe me i know!|`|2c844fcf526bc2b90f16b7c425e11aa7aa	Is this a trick question?  What are your symptoms when you have gas?  The symptoms are the same with dogs.|`|taLD45Sqaa	It will smell something similar to $h*t and will linger in the air causing those around to hold their breath or evacuate asap. The dog will look around like nothing has happened when really inside he is thinking "Muahahaha"|`|bSarvx0Daa	The symptoms are that the dog stinks.|`|stCyrS4Eaa	A dog can have gas just like humans. It is the same uneasy feeling. Dogs will not show any pain. They may show some discomfort, but not understand why.    My older dog has this quite regularly. She will get up from the spot she is in, turn around, and lay back down in the same spot. We don't know what she is doing until the smell moves through the room. Yep, that is gas.    You are changing your pet's food as you should be, gradually. Just watch her behavior and keep an eye on her stools. Chances are, all will be fine with the transition.
8i90ov0Gaa	Well, first off, if she's severely underweight she most likely won't become gravid. They use fat cells to develop egg follicles, which in turn become the embryos, but if they don't have enough body weight, they won't develop follicles. Even if they do begin the process, they can still reabsorb the follicles. A female boa should always have significant weight on her if you're trying to breed her. Even after they become gravid, I continue to feed them up until about 60 days before I expect them to give birth. Some will refuse food. I have had gravid snakes go for 5 months without eating and still looked fine. Also, my males mate with my females several times over the period of a few months. This gives me a much higher chance of a successful breeding and a higher fertility rate than a single mating would, so I would recommend trying to get them to mate a few more times. There are ways you can try to encourage this, such as separating them for a few days and then placing them back together, a cool down period, or the smell of another boa.
rLDf1gGGaa	Its neutering for Male dogs, Spaying is for females    Decreased Aggression: One of the most important behavioral advantages of castration is that as adults, these dogs will tend to be less aggressive both toward other male dogs and also people. The androgen (male) hormones, of which testosterone is the most important, are responsible for the development of many behavioral patterns. When young puppies are sexually mounting their 7 and 8-week old litter mates this is because of androgen surges in their bodies. The same is true with aggressive behavior. Some medications that have androgenic hormonal activity often cause increased aggression (an example would be the birth control medication, Cheque Drops, which contains one of these androgen-type chemicals). The degree castration has on suppressing aggression varies between animals and the age at which it is done. Its effect is greatest if it is done before one year of age.    Decreased Roaming: A second behavioral advantage of neutering is that these dogs will not 'roam' when they sense a female in heat. Male dogs can sense females in heat through pheromones. These are airborne chemical attractants that are liberated from the female when she is cycling. They travel through the air for great distances. We grew up on a farm where the next closest house was over a mile away, but when one of our female dogs was in heat, the males would come for miles from upwind, downwind, and crosswind. Pheromones are, to say the least, very effective stimuli. In the seventies, it was briefly popular to do vasectomies on dogs thinking that we would not be taking the 'joy of sex' away from our canine counterparts. The problem with this reasoning was that many of us keep our dogs restricted in our homes, a kennel, or on a chain. Now think of the psychological stress the vasectomized male is under when he is locked up, but yet smells that female in heat four blocks away. There is no joy of sex, as he is trapped on your property unable to go and mate with her. He is, in effect, teased continuously for three to fourteen days while the female is in estrus and he is unable to mate with her. If dogs are neutered at an early age, they will not sense or respond to pheromones, and would certainly be less stressed and tend to stay home.    Increased Concentration: A third behavioral advantage occurs when you are training or working your dog, or using him for field work. If neutered, he will be a much better student with a much longer attention span when there are females nearby that are in heat. This is because he will not be constantly distracted by pheromonal stimuli.    No Testicular Tumors: There are several different tumor types, both benign and malignant, that arise within the testicles. As with most cancers, these usually are not noted until the animal reaches 5 or more years of age. Therefore, these would not be a problem in those individuals castrated at the recommended age.    Improved Genetics: We all agree that a male carrying a harmful genetic trait like hip dysplasia or epilepsy should be neutered. We must do all that is possible to prevent the spread or continuation of these conditions and others like them.    Fewer Hernias: A hernia is a protrusion of an organ or parts of an organ or other structure through the wall of a cavity that normally contains it. Perianal hernias occur when the colon, urinary bladder, prostate, or fat protrude from the abdominal cavity, through the muscular wall by the anus and then lie just under the skin. This type of hernia is far more common in older, unneutered male dogs. The levels of testosterone and other hormones appear to relax or weaken the group of muscles near the anus. When the animal then strains to defecate or urinate, the weakened muscles break down and the abdominal organs and fat bulge out under the skin. In shorthaired breeds, this large bulge is noted by the owner almost immediately, but in the longhaired dogs, the problem may go on for months before anyone realizes there is an abnormality. Left untreated, these organs may become damaged, unable to function or even die from loss of blood supply. Additionally, because of the displacement of organs into this area, the animal may not be able to defecate or urinate correctly or completely and may become constipated or have urinary incontinence (dribble urine). The surgery to repair this condition is not simple and today can easily cost $700 to $1500 or more, depending on the severity.    Fewer Perianal Tumors: There are tumors whose growth is stimulated by testosterone. These occur near the anus and are called perianal adenomas (benign) or perianal adenocarcinomas (malignant). As with the hernias, these usually do not occur until the dog is at least 7-years old. They require surgical treatment and should be caught early in their development to prevent recurrence. These tumors and the above hernia are very, very rare in those individuals castrated at 7 to 8-months of age.    Fewer Prostate Problems: The most common medical problems eliminated in dogs neutered at an early age are those involving the prostate. Over 80% of all unneutered male dogs develop prostate disease. Prostate conditions such as benign enlargement, cysts, and infection are all related to the presence of testosterone.    Early neutering     In the United States, most dogs are neutered between 5 and 8 months of age. Many humane shelters and veterinarians are starting to neuter male animals at a younger age, even 6-14 weeks of age. This early neutering does not affect the growth rate, and there are no appreciable differences in skeletal, physical, or behavioral development between those animals neutered early than those neutered at a more traditional age. It must be remembered that younger animals may need different anesthetics and are more prone to hypothermia (lower than normal body temperature) during surgery. As long|`|Ei85kgfdaa	It will help but you also need to train him and be aware of other dogs entering his space, especially when he is on leash.

2fdee6b1fd597a29209ecfad9dc8b598aa	Firstly, I don't own iguanas and I never have. But from what I read it sounds like prolonged stress exposure.    Try this link.  It might head you in the right direction.  You might think of finding a rescue if she is sick.  They may work with you to get her seen (and let you pay in installments) or you might need to surrender the animal for them to provide treatment.  Please don't take offense, this is just an idea, and it could possibly help your pet.    This is the link I found: http://www.anapsid.org/iguana/skincolor....    Good luck.

a2cjwMKcaa	The fish you list will certainly eat bloodworms, most fish love them.    But it's best to vary their diet.

Ei85kgfdaa	It depends on the breed band also the individual dog(how much food, treats, toys, etc). But if you do not have enough for regular vet visits as well as emergency medical care then you probably cannot handle it.|`|E5gaKzCsaa	It's not the weekly or even monthly expenses that will get you. If you can afford to feed yourself, you should be able to work dog food into the budget. It's nice to be able to buy special dog toys, bowls, blankets, etc, but most dogs are quite happy with toys like sticks and tennis balls or cheap stuffed toys, and bedding from the thrift store. What can really sting is vet expenses aside from regular vaccinations. I have a cat who needs a decayed tooth removed. It's costing $1000. That was a total surprise, I'd never have spotted it so soon but the vet did during the annual exam. Most of the large vet bills I've paid, I didn't see them coming. After the initial puppy shots, an average healthy dog probably won't need much vet care until it's older, if you feed it properly and exercise it, and keep it from having accidents. Some breeds are known for medical problems, so avoid those if possible. As an animal owner, you need to be able to handle sudden expenses. Get insurance, have a savings account just for dog bills, or have a credit card with room on it for emergencies.|`|rLDf1gGGaa	Fact is dogs are EXPENSIVE  Approx 1st year  Purchase Price=$1000, you can cut this cost down by adopting a puppy, or even adult dogs from a shelter,rescue or pound, generally the older the dog the cheaper it is at shelters.   So a puppy would be around Shelters 260  Adult would be 210  Senior 115  Some shelters even charge less then $100  Shelter/pounds/rescues do charge various prices depending on their policy     Food=$500  Vacinations;$150-again you save if you adopt an older dog  Vet bills, $400  Spay/neuter=$200-some shelter/pounds/rescues already have spayed the puppy or adult dogs before it allowed to leave the shelter or rescue, which also save you money as the adoption fee already cover the cost of spaying/neutering  Bed=$150  Treats=$100  Toys-$2.00 bargin stores, $40.00+ for a quality toy.   Chew bones=$150  Bowls=$25  Collars=$20  Leash=$20  Harness=Best for small dogs  Trainning=$450  Fence=$1500  Flea control=$200  Heartworm=$100  Shampoo=$25  Grooming tools=$250  dental care=$40  Trainning aids=$300  Boarding=$200  Crate=$150  Car restraints=$100  Also don't forget the cost of those dogs such as Poodles,Schnazuser that require clipping, you can get the groomer to do it but it is not cheap every 3-4months, you can also learn to do it yourself, but the groomer kits aren't cheap either  Total over the life of a 14 year old dog approx 38,905.00    I spend already over 1000+ on the care of my dog, however by buying high quality dry food even though its more expensive at 1st, save money in the long run and dry food is actually cheaper then canned food. I spend $110 dollars on Proplan 18kg bag, its last for about 3months, depending on the size of the dog and how much nutrients your dog requires, not everyone has the fancy, holistic diets available in their area, also we do have eagle pack, but my dog allergic to Alfalfa which is one of the common ingredients in pet food, so even though it all nautral, it no good for my dog when she allergic to Alfalfa. I used to buy canned food for my dog regular, as well as dry, but now i only buy it as a  treat and have saved lots of dollars already, which i put toward a vet bill tin, for those unexpect costs and believe me those unexpect vet bills can EXCEED $2000+! You don't have to pay for veterinary insurance plans, however its a good idea if you can afford it, you can put just any old, spare  coins in the emergancy tin every week, and i've saved up $50.00, already and NO i don't work! that a tiny bit of pension, and any loose coins and my race winnings from the melbourne cups that earned me this cash.    remember is you pick up a dog food bag at a grocery store, it is no where as big as you'll get at a pet supply store or very much nutrition, and it won't last 3months, its be 2weeks maximum and in this way it actually cost more, as you are consistently having to go to the shop to get more pet food to fed your dog, say=$8 x 14 days=$112, 8 x 365days=$2920 a year.  Where as a bag of quality pet food such as Proplan=110 for 3months=would last alot longer.    Dogs that have been uprooted from their happy homes or have not had the best start in life are likely to bond very closely to their new owner.  Yes, dogs that have lost families through death, divorce or lifestyle change can go through a mourning process; however, once they become attached to their new family, they seem to want to please as much as possible to make sure they are never homeless again!  Those dogs that are just learning about the good life and good people seem to bond even deeper. They know what life on the streets, life on the end of a chain, or worse, is about, and they revel and blossom in a nurturing , loving environment. Most rescues make exceptional , extremely loyal companions|`|AA12074512	its not just a week or month its years and years|`|zTSZgP3jaa	Each week about 5 dollars. That's including treats.

This is on the lower end of the scale, because we adopted and I live down near the gulf coast, where everything is pretty cheap.    One thing that you REALLY ought to think about, from one girl who got a puppy with her boyfriend to another who might... sometimes relationships end. One person has to be the owner of the dog. One person has to take ultimate responsibility for it. You don't want to get in a situation where you're staying in a relationship to stay with the dog, or where you break up and can't agree on who takes the dog.    My story has a happy ending because the boyfriend and I got married three years later, but it was still, in hindsight, a rather stupid thing to do. But she was getting close to her deadline for adoption before being euthanized, and I knew that she would be the perfect dog for me, so... I did it anyway. She actually would have been 100% mine if not for the fact that I thought my place allowed pets when it didn't (apparently our duplexes were owned by different people but managed by the same landlord - who would've thunk it), but I sure as hell wasn't giving her up after I got her, and she moved in with him for a while before I found another place.    So just make sure to think and talk about this first.|`|fjkRIUSnaa	well  i would call vets in your area to see the shot schedule. also get a price to have the spayed or neutered. the after that you have to decide what type of food and get a price .

(Also, think about the time requirements, the training, what personality you would like best, etc.)     Here is a list I was keeping for my newest pup for her first 6 months. We got her (chihuahua) on 02-14-08. I tried to write down all the expenses, but sometimes I'd just forget to put some in, so I really spent more than this. Also...a lot of the little items I bought, I got on a better sale than most folks might get. Also, my vet is probably the most reasonable in the whole city...maybe much cheaper than you will find (what some folks have told me, when comparing vet bills).     Good luck whatever you decide to do. Remember...a pup is yours for life.

The Costs of Dog Ownership....Responsible dog owners realize that love and companionship don't come cheap. One-time ownership costs such as purchase/adoption fees, spaying/neutering and training average $2,100.00 according to an online survey conducted by the American Kennel Club (New York).     Annual ownership costs, covering food, grooming, veterinarian visits and so on, averaged nearly $2,500. Here's a closer look at the costs:    One-time costs  Purchase/adoption fees $646  Spaying/neutering $160  Training fees and supplies $340    General supplies (bowls, crates, leashes) $350  Emergency vet visits and surgery $631  Total $2,127    Annual expenses  Dog events $457   Food $446  Grooming $190   Ongoing training $254  Pet sitting/walking/  boarding $223  Toys and treats $217  Travel $279  Veterinary care $423  Total $2,489    Divide this out by 12 -- $200+ a month.  Obviously you may not have travel or grooming expenses and some other things you can reduce -- but I would leave food, treats, and I probably up the vet care expense -- you never know what might happen!!  I've had over $4K in vet bills in 2008 trying to save my oldest dog but I still had to put him down in the end.  Totaly worth it to me but I knew that I would have to pay it off over the course of 1-2 years (and put off purchases/investments that I had planned).|`|lmSffrNuaa	Let's say you're adopting from a local shelter as opposed to buying from a breeder. By doing so, you'll save hundreds of dollars--and possibly take advantage of the spay / neuter surgery that many shelters include in the price of adoption. That said, you can still expect to spend between $795 to $1725 the first year, just for the basics.    Check this link for more info.    http://lnk.nu/dogtime.com/s2m.html|`|57c42715dc881c8ee82c57d63156ad6faa	Let's just say that I spend more money on my dogs than I do on my boyfriend. Good Luck!
a2cjwMKcaa	There are some things you can do to help..    Switch off the lights, the fish dont need them, and they put out heat.    Open the lid and point a fan at the surface. Evaporation will help keep the water cooler. You will have to top up the water more, but thats not a problem. In fact let the water drop a bit, the fish are less likely to jump out.    Freeze some plastic bottles of water (only fill them 3/4 full). Float the bottles in the tank untill they melt. Get a bunch of them, then you can rotate them between the freezer and tank.    Increase the aeration in the tank, warm water cannot hold as much dissolved oxygen, so make sure you get as much as you can there.    Our weather isn't as hot as yours, but I have been floating bottles of ice in my coldwater native tank to help keep the temp down.    Good Luck    Ian|`|NBfBKI1Uaa	Here is a few ways to keep the water temperature down in an aquarium.    1. Leave the hood open. Evaporation will lower the temperature.    2. Direct a small fan at the water surface increasing the water evaporation and thus lowering temperature.    3. Float bag of ice cube. Don't add ice cube directly into the water.     4. Increase surface agitation to increase water evaporation.    5. Aerate the water. This will also increase water evaporation.    6. Shut off the light or lights should be on on for bare minimum.    7. If all else fails, buy chiller or built you DIY chiller.    -rds|`|YRwjguBDaa	maybe no1 :get a chiller 2 :get a dc fan: 3:use a plastic coke bottle, put it in a freezer, wait till it becomes ice then put it in the tank, will keep the temp low for about 12 hours.|`|WBopwqTGaa	you can use ice cubes to bring it down to the temperature that you want or use coke and water bottles that are frozen3/4 of the way to bring the water down.  also block out any light that comes from out side and keep the light off when your not in the room because light produces energy in turn produces heat.   also remember that as you begin to cool down your tank your going to lose water which is not too bad but you'll use up more conditioner when you top it up so wait until the tank is about down to 3/4 full and put in luke or semi cold water to top it up that will also help reduce heat in your tank.  hope this helps!|`|vDB5sI9faa	get a container of ice and sit it in their and are you from aussie|`|QyP0hDkJaa	Add some colder water when you do a water change. Sorry to hear about your loss.

ZRG7wEf9aa	Your female cat probably has worms.  You need to make it a priority to get her fixed.  Just call the local Humane Society and they can refer you to a vet that will do it for less than the cost of a tank of gas.  If you can't afford to get her fixed to do your part in controing the MASSIVE overpopulation of cats, then you really can't afford to be a pet owner.|`|8IfePMa3aa	*head/desk*  *head/desk*  *head/desk*  *head/desk*  *head/desk*  There are a lot of programs that offer free/low-cost spay/neutering.  If you can't afford this, you can't afford the vet, and you hands down can't afford the pet. Give animals the love and respect they deserve.|`|XfjoDHo2aa	just because your female cat is spayed does not mean that she can not be in heat it just simply means she can not reproduce ..and since you have a male cat around that is not spayed she can sense that because he probably sprays around your home|`|0LsRbK2iaa	DUH CATS HAVE PERIODS SO DO DOGS DOY|`|Y8ssQvCKaa	..So you don't have the money to fix two of your cats of opposite genders, but you magically have money to support kittens when they come along, and any emergency care they or the mother may need? That's so weird.|`|zkNotsePaa	your gonna end up with kittens if your not careful|`|vhEp3PeJaa	First of all, you really need to either have the male cat neutered, or have the female cat spayed. If you can't afford, call a local vet school, or research options in your area. Some groups or vets offer low cost or free neutering and spaying based on income.    Your cat may be in heat, and the blood may not be in the stool, it may be coming from her vagina. Also, she could potentially be pregnant or be getting very aggressive and worried by the two male cats in the house. The peeing will become a huge issue, because when she pees your male cat will spray to dominate the area with his scent.     If i were you i'd take her to a vet, just to make sure she is OK.|`|Cl23eeneaa	i would suggest calling your local vet and expressing your concerns. she may be in heat yes, but this runny bloody bowel movement could also be what we in the veterinary field call "stress colitis" meaning she might be stressed out due to the fact that you already have two male cats in the house and one is not altered. The urinating out of the litter box is a behavior issue she is probably just marking her territory. this could be helped by using the rule of thumb when owning cats. For every one cat owned there should be double the litter boxes (if you have one cat you should have two litter boxes; if you have two cats you should have 3 litter boxes, etc).     also i would also call your local shelters and see if they offer money vouchers for spays and neuters..these vouchers make the surgery cost very affordable nd usually include hospital stay, treatments, and medications.
T2rU15Nsaa	Sorry but this sounds a little shady. How did you aquire a greenwing macaw without knowing what it costs, and not from a breeder or pet store?|`|v6coHbIeaa	If you want to know the cost go to the web sites and look it up. I will tell you this you will not get 1000, for it.|`|qeOlkRM0aa	Why are you selling him/her? They are glorious creatures.  Individuals selling a pet don't get as much as a breeder or store, simply because of the issues that come with getting someone else's pet.  Potential buyers will know that he comes with emotional baggage, and will most likely prefer to go to breeders. Alot will depend on where you are, how old the bird is, and if the bird has any bad habits. With the present economy, you won't get much, even if you throw in the cage, toys etc..  With a good cage and everything else, I'd guess around $800. This is a bad time to be selling parrots.  Again, why are you selling this bird? If you need to get rid of a Green Wing, there are parrot rescues around that will take it off your hands.|`|gDMsl2Osaa	Pet stores will charge anywhere from $1500 to $2000 depending on region.  I would suggest asking $1300 and allow bartering no lower than $1000.  You can play around with the top number if you feel that your are a good barterer.    Edit:  Upon reading the answers below I must admit my advice may be a bit dated as this is a good answer for a few years ago when I ran a pet store.  With a poorer economy people are less likely to spend money on luxuries such as pets.  If this is a bird that you have had and feel that you can't take care of or shouldn't have gotten in the first place I would agree with the Macaw rescue solution.  Remember this is a living caring creature that depends on you to make good decisions for it.  This is the kind of reasoning that made me get out of the pet business, I made good money, living creatures should never be an impulse buy.  You should only buy a pet if you truly want one and are willing to give it the proper care and attention.
bepZupAfaa	i have 5 ferrets and some of them will take treats from my hands and some won't. it depends on the ferret.    don't try and get her to do tricks just yet wait until she will take the treats from your hands.  always wash your hands before you try to get her to take the treats from you. that way she will smell only the treats.    she may not be sure of your fingers when you try giving her treats this way. they may make her a little nervous your open palm is more comforting to her.  try putting a little ferretone on your finger(s) and let her lick it off. keep doing this until you think she comfortable and then try offering her a treat with your fingers.you can also put a little on the treat that you are offering her to intice her into taking it from you that way.    be patient and she should come around after time    hope this helps and good luck|`|2fdee6b1fd597a29209ecfad9dc8b598aa	Some ferrets just don't like it.  Sometimes it depends on the type of treat (all my ferrets take treats that are mushy--baby food, etc--from my fingers. When I *used* to feed commercial treats they preferred sticking their head in the the bag or eating it off the floor.      Sometimes, too, it depends on what smells they pick up from your hands.  If it is something that they find offensive, then they aren't likely to want to take a treat from you directly.|`|6Z29aDnjaa	This is normal. If you have not had the ferret long, then it may not be used to you yet. Try different treats and find a brand that she just loves. If that don't work, then try to find her favorite toy.|`|k1bR1BHiaa	She probably doesnt feel comfortable enough yet. But dont take it to heart because a lot of small animals are that way. Once she feels comfortable she'll do it. Give her some time :)|`|SLmLGwnNaa	Don't know what treats you have tried but my ferrets love bananas try that.
3tSMTwGraa	Buy another cat. Animals from different species will not interact with one another.|`|FYjf7hkEaa	Erm, no. Unless you want your cats leg/head disapearing down its throat.|`|ltIuUBXNaa	The only downside I can see to the interaction is an injury to one of them caused by the other...They cat would probably avoid the lizard in my opinion and they really wouldn't "play".|`|AA12344593	It would be okay if they seem to like each other but really watch the cat because it could take your lizard's eye out.|`|5ydyfbkyaa	Thet can possibly make each other sick.|`|vMXk9ohSaa	When we had a bearded dragon, we found out he could give you salmonella just touching him.  We had to be careful and not touch your eyes until you have thoroughly washed your hands after handling him.  Do not let a reptile play with any other animals unless your vet has told you specifically otherwise it would be ok.  You should do more research than just asking a question on Yahoo.
8i90ov0Gaa	Nope, corn snakes don't eat insects, nor should they be fed them. Feed them mice.|`|TkJn9gO0aa	Species that usually eat mice in captivity should be fed mice to offer optimal nutrition. If the snake is too small to take on a full pinkie then simply cut the pinkie up and offer "pinkie parts".    Heck, I had to do this very same thing yesterday. I have a Black Kingsnake (Lampropeltis getula nigra) that is TINY! I had to offer it "pinkie thighs" one at a time because it was so small/thin.     Another option is to use adult mouse tails. Simply sut off the tail from a dead mouse and wiggle it around. Many times ratsnakes and kingsnakes will go for these.    Here's a photo of the little guy eating a pinkie thigh = http://i544.photobucket.com/albums/hh340...|`|CJ7tAr6gaa	i dont think so.. i think snakes will only eat baby mice.|`|AA10558731	I believe in the wild baby rat snakes (corn snakes are a variety of rat snake) will eat just about anything they can overpower that doesn't eat them first. However in captivity it's best to give them frozen / thawed baby mice which are available in the freezer section at PetSmart, PetCo, and other animal supply stores.    (Warning: live mice can and will kill snakes ~ I've seen it happen with my own eyes. Rats are no better. Always feed snakes pre-killed food items.)    Simply thaw a "pinky" in warm water until it appears to be freshly dead, then offer it to your snake. Put the snake in a clean container so it doesn't ingest any substrate, or make sure the cage is clean and lined with something unswallowable such as newspaper. I always feed my snakes this way and they never have a problem from eating wood chips (which can happen in a cage) and they've always eaten pre-killed food items.
eS8wuYRfaa	I think 100w is a little too much for a 10 gallon, but the only safe thing to do is get a thermometer for it.  NEVER use a heat rock..my daughter volunteers at a local reptile rescue center and you would be shocked at how many animals they see that have been burned by a heat rock!!  Under Tank Heat Mats are fine, because there's protection between the heat and your pet.  Again, though, the only way to tell if you need a light on at night is to get a thermometer and monitor the temps.|`|Rk8QKuQTaa	Just add a heat mat underneath your tank, and get a lower Watt bulb. The heat mat can stay on permanently with the bulb on the timer. that will be your best setup on that size tank.|`|Bn1EjmEHaa	I have a glass tank size 18"(L) x 12"(W) x 15"(H)    I have a 100W bulb (not sure whether it is ceramic or not) installed for heating. This is keeping the environment pretty cozy.    I have never used a Under Tank Heat Pad. So wouldn't be able to answer your query
9AHTNcanaa	The chip is implanted subcutaneously (under the skin) between the animal's shoulder blades. Normally the tiny chip will stay in that place for the rest of the animal's life, however chips have been know to migrate down limbs before.  (We scanned one that was almost to the dog's paw one time!!)    When your dog is picked up by an authority, they should check it with a special electronic scanner that can read the chip's numeric code.  This code is linked to a data base that should contain your contact info, or at least the contact info of whom ever chipped the dog in the first place.  With this info your dog should be able to be returned to you. (If you are afraid the info in the database is not up to date, you can update it by finding your ID number either on the tag (I think they are either yellow or blue depending on the brand) or the paperwork that you received at the time the dog was chipped and going to the companies website.    The two most common chips are AVID and HomeAgain.    The only problems with this great system is if your dog A) Does not make it to the authorities...  :-(  or B) If the authorities do not have the correct scanner since there are at least two different kinds of chips out there.  Some places don't even have any kind of scanner, since they can be quite pricey.  Luckily most shelters these days have the scanner that reads both types of chips.    Well I hope this helped and I really hope you find your dog!!!    Best of Luck!    ~Samantha      EDIT:  I talked to my vet today and he said that he thought the scanners are actually free to police dept. and animals shelters, so find out if your local PD has one.  If they don't encourage them to call AVID and get one!  :-)|`|r9wrDGm2aa	How does a microchip in a dog work?     The microchip records a number and when the chip is scanned eg. by an Animal Control Officer or a vet, the number of the microchip is seen on the scanner.     The officer is able to source from the Council's dog register, what dog this chip belongs to and the owner's details, address etc. In the case of a vet, the Council is able to give them some information.     A member of the public would not be advised of the dog and owner details attached to a microchip number (if they actually knew the microchip number) as they would not generally be given details of any dog or owner by other identification.    If a dog has a microchip and it has been found, the Council will endeavour to contact the owner and get them to collect it or make arrangements with the finder for it's return. If that is not possible, a Dog Control Officer may collect the dog and attempt to return it home.     This is not guaranteed as a frequent wanderer is liable to be impounded, microchip or not, as this "return home" courtesy may have been given several times before!     It is important to note that a microchip is only of use if the Council (or any other council in whose area the dog may have registered) has been advised of the number.|`|CIkD0SfOaa	I guess it depends on the chip.  Some may even have GPS.  Usually though, if the dog is turned in to the humane society, they will scan your dog for a chip. When the chip is scanned it will say who the owner is and how they can be reached.|`|CtYqMs5Paa	If your dog is found and taken to a shelter or vet they will scan for a microchip...if they find one it will give them a number that they can call in and get the owner info so they can contact you and tell you they found your dog.    **Current microchips DO NOT have GPS capability|`|BhXOLas1aa	when the dog is found and scanned, the chip will show who owns it and where they live  Good luck|`|taLD45Sqaa	Where I live microchips are useless because many of the shelters dont have the scanning tool. I would call around to see if your dog has been found.
cToJQNknaa	These are called trumpet snails and they can overpopulate your tank over time. They reproduce asexually so they do not need a tank. They come from plants that are added to the tank that aren't rinsed off before putting them in there.|`|AraBfesHaa	You don't want to take care of them, you want to get rid of them before you have thousands in the tank.  One of them probably hitchhiked into your tank on a plant you added to the tank.  all it takes is one.  There's no stopping them unless you completely eradicate them from the tank.|`|QyP0hDkJaa	If they are growing in your tank it means they are eating so you don't really need to do anymore.

ESA only allows you to keep the dog in a living situation that may normally not allow the dog.    The difference is that a service dog is actually trained to perform a task or function that assists you with a disability.

Good luck.|`|sjvdbDn9aa	please call a vet.They can give you info over the phone.Posion is deadly .JD|`|zTSZgP3jaa	It depends on how much she's taken in. She may be perfectly fine but if she's gotten too much poison it can lead to severe problems. There's no real way to tell. Water won't help with the poison unfortunately but it might help her cool off since she's panting.     Call the Vet.
8i90ov0Gaa	Yes, there is a difference. Captive hatched  ball pythons are imported. People go out into the wild in west Africa and catch gravid (pregnant) females and also find nests. They hatch the eggs, then without feeding or offering water, they package them up and ship them to the United States by the tens of thousands. These snakes often arrive dehydrated, haven't eaten, and may possibly carry parasites. They tend to have more feeding problems than a captive bred ball python. In my opinion, "captive hatched" is just a fancy, misleading term for wild caught imports. I always advise buying captive bred snakes. Most of the ball pythons in pet stores are imports, but breeders are easy to find at reptile expos, and you can usually buy them for less than what you would pay for an import at a pet store. I'm currently sold out, but I sell my captive bred males for $30, which is better than an $80 import from Petsmart.|`|MX9M36B4aa	Captive bred means both parents were bred and hatched in captivity,and captive hatched usually means the eggs were retrieved from the wild and then hatched in an hatchery.|`|rJtw29Xoaa	Ball pythons are pretty chill snakes so you are unlikely to get an aggressive one. The difference between captive hatched and captive bred is that captive hatched are from eggs that were laid by wild snakes taken from the wild to lay their eggs in captivity, there is a chance they will have mites or other parasites as they will not have had the same conditions as captive bred animals. If it is your first snake it would probably be best to shell out the extra money for a captive bred because then you know it will be healthy and eating as captive hatched are not always good eaters. When you buy it ask if you can see a feeding record and what it has been eating, e.g rat pups or whatever. You should look for a snake that reacts to your movements, has black, dry eyes unless it is in shed in which case they will be shiny. Check around the nose for any discharge because if there is any it could be a sign of a respiratory infection so choose a snake with a clean dry nose. Also check the vent located near the tail, this should also be clean and dry. As for the prices and quality, look for a breeder in your area as places like petco and petsmart are notorious for selling sick snakes that die very quickly, you could check out some reptile forums and ask if there are any reputable ball python breeders in your area, some breeders will also ship them to you. Wherever you buy your snake from make sure you do your research on how you need to keep it, remember they are cold blooded so need costant heat and if they get too hot they die so you need a thermostat hooked up to whatever heat source you're using. Hope this helps.|`|0LsRbK2iaa	SNAKES :O|`|KihffCc5aa	if you are looking for a ball python as a pet, you'd do best with one who has been handled since birth.  It's a snake.  Obviously, a hand held since birth will be the best pet, regardless of whether it's captive or otherwise.    If you are seeking a Ball Python as a pet, get one raised by a reputable breeder as an infant, who has had a LOT of human contact.  Ball Pythons are wild animals, and the more human contact it's had, the better, especially if you want to handle it later as an adult.  Ball Pythons are typically the best pet snakes to own.  They can be phenomenal pets, and VERY human friendly.|`|fb8eb9f3f86b1ec5c3bc6e0bde5fed3caa	There is no difference in Captive bred or captive hatched..  theres a lot of info from people out there who deals and sells thing..

Born in captivity but imported.  Captive born and bred is what you want.  Most tend to be healthier, better eaters and you'll have parent history as well as feed/shed records.  Imports aren't necessarily more aggressive in this species, but in most, I find the cbb to be more docile than a wild caught individual.  Captive hatched is anybodies guess.  You always run the risk of parasites from an import as well as related health issues from stress, long periods without water and exposure to many animals.  For a more established animal, you might try a local reptile show and see if the breeders there have anything that appeals to you.  Most shows these days are ball python shows....there's usually about 1000 to choose from.
G032Flc3aa	Cats shouldn't be bathed unless for some reason they are covered in something that will harm them.  Cats are self cleaning, it is included in the grooming process, you can do more harm than good to their coats by bathing.    Cats and kittens have claws, it's a known fact, over the years we've had loads of cats and kittens and never had problems other than just having to be careful around the sharp bits.  Please don't start messing about with a 7 week kitten by clipping claws and bathing, you might make the poor little creature nervous of you for life.|`|jKMH27gKaa	There is a device called the Peticure that I've seen on TV and at the pet specialty store; it basically will gently sand (rather than harshly clip) the nail. You both still need to get used to it though, so before cutting them, pet your kitty's paws and hold them gently and praise him so he gets used to your handling them; it will probably take a few days/weeks before he trusts you enough for this, but once he knows you're not trying to hurt his paws and gets used to the process, it won't be so stressful.    Don't bathe the kitty; if he's got horrible fleas (mine did when I first got them) use just a drop or two of Advantage (not a whole tube or it could hurt/kill him). It will kill all fleas within an hour. After that, give him a good combing with the flea comb to help him shed the dead fleas and excess fur. If he's an indoor cat, you will notice he'll clean himself quite nicely.|`|AA11890009	i've never bathed my cat or got their nails cut.i've had many of them and had no issues about it|`|Y8ssQvCKaa	Don't bath him. That simple. Cats don't need to be bathed unless the vet instructs it because they're too old or overweight to clean themselves. Cats are very good at cleaning themselves and rarely need human input.    As for the claw issue, it may be best to get them done for the first time by a groomer. I NEVER cut my cat's claws, even as a kitten, and never had an issue, but if the cat is wigging and crying, it's a hazard as you may slip and cut the quick of the nail. Either leave it for now- after all, the kitten's new, and you don't want to stress it out too much- or make an appointment at the groomer's.|`|TPTpwarwaa	I know a lot of kitties/cats dont like their claws clipped, but it doesn't hurt him. just make sure you don't cut past the cuticle part, only the claw part (where its white, ending before its red), he will get used to this and it won't mind him for a while. I know its hard but you have to get them clipped, its better for him to prevent infections and such. If he's too little right now to clip them, even filing them helps. Talk to him calm through this process. i sometimes put my kitties (with their heads out lol) in a blanket so they won't squirm.  Hmm i've never really gave my kitties bath's, but even doing it in a small bowl would help or just wet a warm wash cloth. They have bath wipes at wal-mart that i use on my kitties, they work really well and aren't expensive|`|taLD45Sqaa	Let's put two and two together. Cats instinctively don't like water and they have razor sharp claws that are still sharp even when trimmed. Good luck with that recipe for disaster!! I would recommend a suit of armour.... but really cats are super clean anyways and don't need baths....|`|25660b99958e6df83f2c651134b3891faa	he is only a baby, and too young to be away from mom.    he needs a friend to understand this, and put up with a few scratches until he gets settled and adjusts to not having mom or siblings any more.    his claws will always be sharp, that is the idea, but as an adult he learns to keep them retracted while playing with humans. as long as you dont do something silly, like bathe him. if you do, he will show you what his claws are for, hind  claws too, and fangs.   it is fun to watch them use all four sets of claws to climb up you and out of the tub, though.    dont bathe him. you will live longer.|`|Cl23eeneaa	As for the bath situation..I would start very slowly some cats are very freaked out by running water. This doesnt mean dip him in the water either. I would bring some treats into the bathroom with you when you two have him in the bathroom. One of you hold the kitten in the sink (water off at first) reasuring him it is ok, while the other holds the treats and slowly turn the water on. If he stays calm offer him a treat. Gradually turn the water on a little more still offering him treats. You may even try wetting him with a wash clothe while doing this. Try doing this at least once a day at first, when you think he is ready try and wet his whole body. Once you've accoplished that your joob to go..You want to make bath time a rewarding time. Always stay calm if your getting the least bit stressed because he/she isnt behaving they will sence it and react. If you do not have kitten shampoo you can use one of two things. You could either use regular johnson's baby shampoo or Palmolive dish detergent but make sure you dilute it in a seprate container first..I'd use the Johnson's though due to it being tearless. If all else fails and he just hates the water you could alwasy go to the pet store and look for waterless shampoos, powder baths, or they even have disposable wipes too.  As for the nails do it as a team effort. Just like with the bath. One holds, the other clips and gives treats.  Hope everything works out and best of luck to you.|`|gU34xa9vaa	This kitten should have been  with his mother at least another week.If you are messing him about now, needlessly bathing him and cutting his claws, no wonder he fidgets and cries,you could traumatise him for life. He's a baby cat, let him live as a cat ! Once you start bathing cats it strips their fur of the natural oils it needs to keep healthy.  He needs good food,warmth,lots of toys to play with, and to be allowed to sleep when he needs to.|`|P3WPiEVPaa	With your claw situation, instead of clipping them use Soft Paw Gel caps, www.softpaws.com that is what I use on my cat that still has claws, not only does it prevent you from being scratched but they can't tear up anything else, and it's a great alternative to declawing.    When it comes to the bathing, I wouldn't bathe your kitten yet, It's actually a week to young to be away from his mother, but if you have to, if he has fleas, or something like that. I always found it worked best to actually sit in the tub with my kitten, put on some old clothes and actually hold him in the bath tub and bathe him until he is a little older. It worked great for my cats and actually now they love the water. They actually come and sit on the side of the tub and let their tails wag in the water while I'm in there, it's adoreable.

NBfBKI1Uaa	First, what type filter do you have?    If you have a HOB power filter, this water movement is coming from the water flowing over filter lip. If this is the case, the filter is at one end of the tank and thus you can use the other end to feed.     Guppies and other fishes like a little bit of water movements. I doubt if a HOB can create such a water movement that make it hard for the guppies to swim against the current.    If you you canister filter, then you can easily lower the water put put but adjusting the outtake valves.      -rds|`|SZOMVGBRaa	Wow, Ankaboot. Tell us how you really feel lol     If you want to slow the flow you can fill your tank up to the top of the water output. This will cause only the top of the water by the output to have high flow.  Otherwise just move your filter to one side of the tank so they have a quite side to rest and for you too feed them on.|`|45azZvL9aa	Put a small piece of saran wrap (or any clear plastic wrap) near the intake on the filter.  Should slow it down.|`|JvTF7UrMaa	you need to turn it off and then make sure you are actually turning it down and its not jammed if that doesnt work, i got told by my fish store to turn he out flow vale facing towards the surface of the water so that the water will break on the water surface and then not as much power will be inplyed to the fish xxx|`|AHEFXgE7aa	Buy a decoration that will block the flow.  That way your tank will look nice and your filter will continue to work.    cheers|`|Jkt3UkTBaa	Put the filter where the guppies don't usually go.  Like some people said, put pantyhose around the filter intake to slow down the water output, but that also gives the filters some difficulty sucking in debree and old fish food.  You can get a new filter if you want...  Is there an adjustable water output direction? You can point the direction into the back of the tank so it won't bother the fish.  Hope this helped!|`|4gfitHMxaa	aim your filter towards the wall. be careful about putting anything near the intake valve as that voids the warrenty|`|2lnizoHpaa	As the guy aboves idea may work i would be weary of using it because it any plastic gets sucked into you filter it isn't going to do it much good, I suggest you get a pair of tights/pantyhose and pop them over the intake of the filter/pump this will make it harder for it to suck as much water through as quickly. It should solve your high flow rate easily, i use it in fry tanks    Hope I helped      DD|`|eMFRN0HCaa	steel wool, brillo pad, and double up you filter to slow the speed flow, or buy a new one. try it and pick me for best answer|`|QyP0hDkJaa	Add rocks or plants or a fake ornament for them to hide in and get out of the open water.

tMlwcim8aa	You can feed any fish newborn Guppies. They are small. Plus, Angelfish will eat Neon Tetras, given a chance, so they will jump at the chance to eat a Guppy Fry.    How to breed Guppies,    by Cobra Guppy      Breeding Guppies are very easy, they breed constantly, and one female can have up to 3 litters of fry from only one mating. To breed Guppies you need a male to female ratio of 1 Male to every 2 or 3 Females. Why? Males constantly chase any adult female. If you have only one male and one female the female will nip and avoid the male to keep his advances at bay. For a female to be ready for mating it is best to really have a colorless female, with no pattern (If you don't know the origins of you female's parents) which is a virgin. Get 3 Females and 1 male and put them in at least a 4 Gallon tank. I recommend not using a breeding net for them to mate, they will mate a lot better in free water. The male will advance and most likely succesfully mate with females. The females will be fertilized and and their gestation period will be about 1 month. The  female will increase or decrease in her feeding habits, her belly will become larger, and her anus will become larger and darker, as the last week before birth draws near. As this times comes to a close, go to petco or petsmart and by a 2 or 3 way breeder's box. Put the female in the box, and she will give birth inside this box, and the fry will fall through the trap, where the mother cannot eat them. It will take about 3 hours for her to give birth to all of her fry. Remove the mother, and take the box to a tank with small, peaceful, or no fish in it. Let the fry grow and develop. The fry should be seperated by gender, when they are about 4 months old, as they will try to begin to mate with each other at about this time. this is bad because in-breeding will create birth defects in the resulting litters. Now that you have seperated by gender, it will take about 8 months for the fry to become the close to the size of adults.       Congratulations, you have now completed the cycle.|`|asEeCmzraa	Angels will scoff baby guppies. They aren't herbivores.     Guppy breeding is easy. It's successfully keeping babies alive that's difficult.   Buy a trio- 2 males and one female- or any sized group of guppies with a male:female ratio of 1:2. Basically, have twice as many females as males. Guppies generally give birth every 28 days, on the dot. As soon as the babies are born, separate them from the adults. If not, then the guppies will eat them. Throw them straight in with the Angels, and the Angels will eat them. Best of luck.|`|nZlMnmeOaa	yes|`|QyP0hDkJaa	I disagree with the above answer about angelfish eating babies and not being herbivores.|`|WBopwqTGaa	no angel fish wont eat baby guppies they are herbivores which means they only eat plants and algae and the works  and breeding guppies is easy set one male and two females in a tank and voila they'll breed over and over and over
W02kTOqmaa	How old is your shepherd? And what are you feeding him?    Honestly, shepherds aren't truly filled out until they are about 3-4 years old. Any age before that, and they are still growing. Bone structure and height wise, they are done growing at a year, but they still pack on weight until about 3 years old. My older male is almost 2 years old now, and he is just now finally starting to put on some weight.    Proper excersise is really the only thing. You don't want to pack on a lot of fat just by feeding your dog more. Fat may look good to you, but isn't healthy. Make sure your dog gets an hour of excersise a day. And that's not just playing in the yard. Actually get him out, run with him, go on bike rides.    Some shepherds are just plain skinny. My sister rescued a shepherd who looked like he had been starved for a month, and that shepherd looked like that until the day he died, after a long happy life with her. Shepherds from american lines especially tend to be on the tall and slender side, like my older boy. My younger shepherd is from german lines, so he is shorter but very thick and stocky.    Make sure you are feeding a good diet, too. I recomend Raw, but if you must feed a kibble, feed a premium kibble. If a food has corn (dogs can't digest corn), wheat (a cheap filler that is the leading cause of allergies), or by-products in it, I wouldn't feed it if you gave it to me.    Good luck!|`|euow3qazaa	As long as you can feel their ribs quite easily through a thin layer of fat and as long as the ribs are not sticking out, then he is at an ideal weight (I imagine that he is not desexed).  I have a tall male GSD that is exactly the same weight and some people have commented that I do not feed him enough.  My vet, on the other hand, said that he could lose a kilo.  Several of the GSD breeders that I train with also said that he is at an ideal weight (between 40 to 42 kilos).    It is better to have a GSD SLIGHTLY underweight than have them overweight as there is less likely hood of hip problems.|`|Pi8KfmOxaa	green tripe will bulk your dog up|`|W0buucLsaa	Don't. Dogs won't die from being a little underweight - it's actually good for them, especially the large breeds. Being underweight means that they're less likely to develop joint problems later. And GSD's are prone to joint problems.    My parents' dog is 14 and has bad joint problems now... I wish we had kept him a bit underweight.    If you're really concerned about him getting malnourished, get a good doggie vitamin supplement. Otherwise, don't worry about it unless he stops eating or starts to become truly emaciated. If your vet says it's OK, then it's OK.|`|taLD45Sqaa	Some dogs are just naturally lean. My dog trainer actually avoided feeding her dog lots so that he didn't bulk up. He should be fine unless he has worms and that's causing him to be malnourished, but they vet should have checked that out for you.|`|tz2f6iwHaa	Feed him cat food. I recommend a/d from Science Diet because it's very fatty. I work at a animal clinic, and we feed that to all the animals who aren't eating. I have a G.shep mix, and she's also very skinny but she is also very hyper. If your dog is hyper, the amount of food won't really make a difference. Also, feed him a very good dry food. Look for products without any grains, chicken meal, or chicken by products.
uBFhKXgHaa	You tried /one/ high quality dog food and you're giving up already? No, do not switch her to Iams unless you want to feed her a crappy dog food.     My question here is, did you switch to the Merrick /gradually/? Foods cannot be switched quickly, especially when switching to a high quality dog food, or you will give your dog an upset stomach.    If you switched gradually and the Merrick still isn't agreeing with her, I'd try another high quality dog food. Not all dogs do well on all high quality dog foods. You need to find the one that is best for your dog.    Examples of low quality foods to avoid: Anything you can find in a grocery store will be low end, Purina, Iams, Eukanuba, Science Diet, Royal Canin, Pedigree, Kibbles n' Bits, Beneful, Ol'Roy.    Examples of high quality foods to look for: Innova, Wellness, Solid Gold, Canidae All Life Stages, Fromm Four Star, Merrick, GO Natural, Nature's Variety Prairie, Nature's Logic, Artemis Fresh Mix, Timberwolf Organics.    Remember that foods should be switched gradually (mixing the new slowly in with the old over the period of about week or so), especially when switching to a higher quality one, so as not to upset tummies. For example:  Days 1 & 2: 75% old food, 25% new food  Days 3 & 4: 50% old food, 50% new food  Days 5 & 6: 25% old food, 75% new food  Day 7: 0% old food, 100% new food    More on dog food:  http://www.dogfoodproject.com/index.php?...  (Learn how to determine the quality of your dog's food.)  http://www.dogfoodanalysis.com/dog_food_... (Dog food reviews. Four stars is a decent food, five stars is a great food, and six stars is an excellent food.)    Darksong~|`|70878cc978ee2e4a79b3b53284340f9caa	Definitely,if the Merrick does not agree with her and the IAMs does,then go ahead and feed the IAMS.Millions of dogs eat it and are just fine.My dogs do well on Merrick;I have had no problems. If you want to feed a corn - free dog food,try Eagle Pack Holistic or even Diamond Naturals Lamb and Rice.|`|ja2UD973aa	What were you feeding before you switched to Merrick?  How long have you been on Merrick? Also, what breed, age, and health concerns does your dog have?  All these things are important to know in order to recommend a food.    Merrick is not all that high in fat, and it's usually not the fat content of a food that causes the runs.  If you switched without first mixing the food for 7-10 days, then her digestive system is probably just not used to the new food and the diarrhea should get better in a few more days.    If you did introduce the new food slowly and have been on it for a few weeks, it is probably something in the the food that her system cannot handle.  Some common problem ingredients can include flaxseed, fruits, and vegetables.  Your dog might do better on a diet that is more simple, but still high quality.    California Natural is a good one to try.  It is just meat (lamb or chicken), rice, and vitamins.  No flaxseed, fruits, or veggies.  Just the basics.  Other brands that dogs seem to do well on are Canidae, Precise, Wellness Simple Solutions, or Natural Balance (either the duck, fish, or venison formulas).    The addition of a probiotic in the form of a supplement or yogurt will help too.  Canned pumpkin for the added fiber will also help.    There are much better solutions than resorting to a food like Iams.|`|lmSffrNuaa	Dogs get run-of-the-mill diarrhea for the same reason people do--they've eaten something bad. For those occasional bouts, the best treatment is to switch your dog to a bland diet until it clears up.    Twice a day serve your dog a cup or so of brown rice, which acts as a binder. You can make it more appealing to your dog by flavoring it with a little chicken or beef broth, or mixing in a spoonful of cottage cheese or a scrambled egg.    Most cases of ordinary diarrhea clear up in a day or two. You'll know your dog has gotten over it when he skips one of his regular pooping sessions.    If the diarrhea persists, call your vet; it could the sign of a more serious problem.|`|tz2f6iwHaa	Her body isn't adjusted to the switch yet, which is why she has diarrhea. I would take her to the vet, also, and get some flagyl prescribed to help her out.|`|KbmP0xWhaa	hmmm|`|taLD45Sqaa	Switch to something with no fillers and grains or preservatives.....|`|7BqOnBa8aa	The most common cause of diarrhea after changing diet is changing food too fast. Did you switch slowly by mixing the new food with the old? If not, that is your problem. It is common to see upset for about two weeks while changing diet, the first week while mixing the two foods, and the second week being week one on the new food. If your dog doesn't like the food, switch to something else. Don't feed Iams tho, it's full of corn and wheat, bad for your dog. There are plenty of options without the bad ingredients. Here is a site to help you pick one:  www.dogfoodanalysis.com/dog_food_revie...
NlbmJCxIaa	If its staying in one place that means shes ready to give birth...best of luck with that!|`|Ed5JlMT9aa	Bread is NOT ok for dogs. It has too much yeast in it and can cause bloat which can be deadly, especially for a pretgnant dog.   It is ok that she has gone off her food, that is common for one about to deliver puppies.  If she is at 62 days, she should deliver at any time now and doesn't need to have food in her stomach and she instinctively knows that.

JwYwsrTzaa	Enroll him in a training class. It will help you bond with your dog, teach your dog his basic commands and give him time to interact with other dogs. I have a red nose pit that we adopted from a rescue when he was 7 months old. He had no prior training and we took a PetSmart training class together and he loved it. Petsmart has great trainers and are cheaper than most. If you don't have a petsmart in your area, check out the phone book. A good trainer will NOT charge for a consultation.    Find a dog park in your area. Most have different size areas, meaning, they have specific areas for small, medium and large dogs. This is a great way to find other dogs compatible to your dogs size, energy level and play level.    Same goes for people. Take him to pet stores, parks, anywhere he can interact with people and kids. Pit bulls by nature are very people friendly and love meeting new ones. The more things he is exposed to, the less likely he will be to bark at them.    Check out the TV shows, The Dog Whisperer on National Geographic and It's Me or The Dog on Animal Planet. I think Cesar Milan and Victoria Stilwell are great trainers and each brings something different to the table. Learning from both will make you better understand your dog and give you more of a range of training ideas to see what works best for you and your dog.    You need to correct any unwanted behavior while he's a puppy. Just be patient and persistent and you will have a great dog! :)    ADD: You might want to read Pitbulls for Dummies. It covers everything thing in there from training, to caring, to health concerns, etc.|`|uBFhKXgHaa	You should probably look into some good puppy obedience classes! Start practicing some positive training like NILIF (Nothing In Life Is Free).

It says right on his show /not/ to attempt anything he does at home. He also has absolutely no professional training and uses outdated techniques that have been disproved (such as alpha rolling and flooding). I definitely don't recommend him.    Darksong~|`|Bz9wAaZpaa	I think dogs respond best to positive reinforcement training where you ignore the behavior you do not want and praise every time she/he does something correctly.   They also need lots of exercise and socialization to become great dogs.

Encourage him to sit quiet while young children are around and remember to NEVER leave a young child and dog unattended. most doggy problems come from our behavior not the dogs.

The first thing you have to do is figure out why your dog is barking. Fear, boredom, lonely....the list can go on forever. The thing is that there are different ways to stop the barking but it depends on why the dog is barking. FOr instance if its an attention seeking bark the worst thing you can do is respond. The dog learns if he/she barks then you come. Hopefully you can learn all these things from classes or books. If you want more help just ask me. Good luck!
tMlwcim8aa	Yes, The fish are bottom-dwelling scavengers, feeding mainly on organic material such as algae. Dojo loaches are omnivorous and may also feed on tubifex worms and other small aquatic organisms|`|9759e8014743debd3d3fd1a7ad437c1faa	Probably.|`|QyP0hDkJaa	It depends if it is a small golden dojo loach and also if it is in the same tank as the snail babys/eggs as otherwise it may not find any so make sure that you feed it specialized food instead of relying on it finding snails eggs or babies.
Rwz3dkQSaa	I agree. It sounds like goat polio or Floppy Kid Syndrome. Unfortunately, testing for polio takes too long.  Get your butt to the feed store. You're going to need to buy PenG and FORTIFIED Vitamin B Complex. If you can get it there, also buy a Lactated Ringer w/ 5% Dextrose... you may have to get this from the vet. I personally bulk order from Hoegger Supply. Otherwise, you'll be dealing with dehydration as well as your current problems.     I'd give about 2cc of PenG [subQ.. if you give orally, you NEED to swipe some cud to give them], depending on the breed of goat and 3cc of Vit B [SQ or oral]. It takes MASSIVE amounts of FVB to overdose... whatever isn't needed, gets peed out.  This should be done for no less than 3 days.    For the Lactated Ringer, pinch the skin up first on the kid. If it snaps back immediately, it's fine. If it sticks up or flattens out slowly, the kid is dehydrated and you need to give it fluids. Squirting water/electrolytes down the throat won't work fast enough. Give the fluids subcutaneously until a lump about the size of plum forms. Turn it off and move to the other shoulder and so forth to the hips. I usually give 100 mL... let them absorb that and then recheck hydration.    I wouldn't give milk unless the kid up and able to get about.|`|OLXv3DEAaa	Try calling the $&%^  vet.     These are goats? It could be goat polio. Or listeriosis but I think the polio is more common in young ones, listeriosis happens more with older goats. I think the polio is not contagious but actually some kind of vitamin deficiency type disease (a B vitamin is needed right away to treat it). They both have similar symptoms, here's a little info. http://www.tennesseemeatgoats.com/articl...|`|ffJfKTrHaa	I'm assuming you are raising goats.  You should probably consult a vet, quickly!      I once had some kid goats born that developed "floppy goat" syndrome.  It was so sad.  They become like rag dolls and can't get up or eat.  Morning, they seem fine.  By afternoon, they cry and they are just weak and lying there. They were too weak to suckle.     IF this is what yours are doing, I was able to save one (when I finally found out what was wrong) by force feeding it.  You can either milk a nanny or even easier, get some replacement milk from feed store.  I used an eyedropper at first and put drops in its mouth.  You may have to gently stroke its throat to encourage the swallowing reaction.  Be careful, though, that it is not going down its windpipe.  Watch for milk coming from the nose.  That's not what you want.  Our baby goat was much improved by morning.  We continued to hand-feed.  He lived in the bathtub for a couple of weeks and was litterbox trained!    Good luck.  I hope your vet can diagnose quickly the problem and save the precious babies.  I love goats.  I had 22 before I moved!|`|KuXNYqa3aa	tetinus. and again ,call the vet
WJXzna8xaa	A tiny egg is usually the first one from a hen just beginning to lay or the last one from an old hen. Either way it is proably infertile and just composed of clear liquid with no yolk. If the mother hen is still sitting on it, just leave it until the other eggs hatch and then throw it away. I doubt you will get a chicken from it.|`|CqJnT2Oqaa	I have had this happen with my chickens from time to time.  It is more likely in beginning layers and older hens.  Mine usually have a yoke in them, but it's usually broken.  It's most likely that these are always infertile.  I have to say though, a midget chicken would be so cute, especially with chickens that are already bantam.  I would say most likely that it's from the hens beginning to lay, and even if it is from the mom, I don't think you have anything to worry about, but I wouldn't count on anything hatching out of it.|`|Bn1EjmEHaa	I agree with those who said it is from a chicken starting to lay eggs. From an older hen at the end of her laying season, I have never experienced this, although I have a number of chicken (with a dozen bantams).    Most probably it has to be infertile.|`|qzPZf2XPaa	Please I hope this doesn't worry you but it's probably dead inside of the egg.
sfyBCwxSaa	If she has never lost an animal that she cared for, then you will not be able to explain to her the pain and the loss.|`|fAcVndo7aa	Oh, just saw your update...if your vet can't find any reason, what food are you feeding?  I just read about a lot of issues with several different brands; you can check out the FDA website and consumer affairs...but anyway.    Your pet is a member of your family.  He (or she, you didn't say) loves you unconditionally, always listens when you talk, never judges, never complains, always wants to do whatever you want to do, doesn't ask for more than you can give, and thinks you're the greatest person in the whole world.  Your dog is loyal, doesn't cheat on you and never will, doesn't lie to you, forgives you instantly and forgets your mistakes, and can sense how you feel without you saying a word.  Ask your girlfriend - if she had a friend like that, wouldn't it hurt to lose that friend?    It's nearly impossible to explain how deeply the loss hurts to someone who has never lost a pet.  I hope that she can at least understand that you are hurting through this, even if she doesn't fully grasp why.    My deepest sympathies.|`|E5gaKzCsaa	Some people get it about animals and some don't. If someone has never cared about an animal of their own, it's just about impossible to explain what it means to lose one. I don't know what you could say so she'd understand.|`|DXQgaShPaa	Well depending on how close you were to your dog, its like losing a best friend|`|ckeOS0fdaa	As i have suffered the loss of a 13yo dog, You need to explain to her that he /she is your best mate. He has always been there for you, never complained, always gave you a hug or kiss at the right time sensing your emotions.I think the best thing you could do is for your girlfriend and the dog to spend some one on one time together. Encourage her to play with or walk the dog to bond them together.      1 question? why euthanize at such a young age?|`|KPKd8dzNaa	I'm so sorry you have to put your dog down.  It's a very tough time I know.  I had to put down 3 with in 2 years of each other.  One being on x-mas morning.    She may not understand cause she's never had a dog to begin with.  It'll be hard to explain, but just tell her what the dog means to you.  He/She is your best friend.  You've been through good times and bad with him/her.  Not only that, he/she is like your child.  He/She depends on you for food, water, shelter & most of all, love.  He/She has been a big part of your life for 6 years and it's hard to let go.    Just explain to her how you feel.  It's like losing a loved one.  It's REALLY hard.    Again, I'm sorry to hear about your loss.  Hang in there.  Maybe she'll come around and you can get a dog together.  Then she may understand.    Good luck & God bless!!|`|2c844fcf526bc2b90f16b7c425e11aa7aa	I don't think you can explain grief to anyone who has never experienced it.  I would be concerned that she dismisses your feelings as 'silly' though.  Grief, sadness and the  sense of loss is never silly, it's real and it's painful.    I also doubt you could expect anyone who doesn't love dogs to understand.  There are some animals people keep as pets that I don't like. I can't figure how they could possibly want to share their lives with such creatures.     What does your vet say about the involuntary bowel motions?  What has the vet tried so far to help the dog?  There must be a physical reason for this in a young dog and there is probably a medical solution to the problem.     I doubt the moderators of this forum would accept your report as spam if someone did suggest you get rid of the girlfriend.  That is not spam, it is an opinion....and did I hear you say 'please' when you ordered us to 'just answer the question'.    Added for Zachhot:  Just so you know, I have recently had to put my heart and soul dog to sleep because she had cancer. I fought this disease with her with everything I had both financially and emotionally but after it all I had to put her to sleep to save her from pain. She was not an old dog either. Do you  think I don't know what grief is?  Losing my dog was the worst day of my life and I doubt I will ever get over it.   I don't do spam, ever, let alone in a grief thread but if it makes you feel good to call my post spam and report it...go right ahead.|`|B7aWzEdyaa	I would tell her that your dog is like your family.

t6Ya3c3baa	It depends on the variety of snake. You could also take clues from the snakes coloration, or markings.    You could take variations on the snake's scientific name, for example my Wandering Garter snake (Thamnophis elegans vagrans) is named Ellie, which I took from elegans. A Valley Garter snake (Thamnophis sirtalis fitchi) that I once had was named Sir Talis.    Snakes from my past include:    Snakey Lakey, a Garter snake, was my first snake.  'Nake, a Kingsnake, was my second snake.  Buzz, a Pacific Gopher snake, was my third snake.  Gar, a Garter snake, was my fourth snake.    Besides Ellie, my other current snake is a Great Basin Gopher snake (Pituophis catenifer deserticola) named Go-go. As in, "I want to go, go away", or "Why don't you go, go away".    I grew up listening to stories about Gladys, the Pacific Gopher snake my mother used to have.    Other possibilities are:     Julius Squeezer  Sir Pent  Miss Hiss  Stripe    A Ringnecked snake could be called Ringo.  A Racer could be Speedy, or Speed Racer.  A Ribbon snake could be Bon-bon, or Bonnie.  A Rosy Boa could be Rosy, or Rose.  A Corn snake could be Cornilius.|`|1J4fJZQoaa	How about Fang!|`|GdZ5ukhlaa	Vladimir- ruler of the world in russian  Reaper  Cloud  Axel  Roxas  Slithers  Scales  Drago  Volante- Dragon in Italian|`|yf0tevyfaa	My sister had a burmese python named Sly.

I would suggest you take the time to educate yourself on the breed you are so willing to make a committment to.  It will enable you to determine if a dog is a quality specimen of the breed, what breed specific health issues to be aware of and how to determine if a breeder you are considering is breeding in an ethical manner with the best interest of the breed and preserving the standards at heart.|`|7W8EKkKLaa	I have a chocolate toy poodle, i want to mate her when she comes on heat next. the pups wont be white though|`|NlvghuIkaa	How on earth are you supposed to find something that doesn't exist?

This is a fancy little name commonly used by horrible breeders, slapped onto their sickly runts to fool people into believing the "MUST HAVE generation" of dog breeds has arrived.     A so called Teacup is produced by breeding two runts of separate litters together. In the first place, the usual runt has been born incorrectly causing this sudden change of health and growth. Breeding two runts together equals a life time of medical bills and heartache for yourself.    Please restrain from supporting such horrible people and places. Not only is it the breeder, but the buyer of the pup can kill many shelter dogs in just that one day. Seriously. You will not find a runt for under $2000.     Toy Poodles alone are great choices and there are many around and available.. just check this out.http://www.k9stud.com/DogBreedersByBreed...|`|xHOJY0x5aa	I know were you can get a gorgeous white toy poodle male or female. These puppies are all from champion bloodlines. They are show quality but, you can just have a beautiful pet if your not interested in showing. But, I pretty sure they are more than $600. But, you get what you pay for. They are health checked,dble series of shots, dewormed, checked neg. Reg. papers and answer any questions at any time. This breeder has finished over 60 champions. She's been in business for 57 yrs.    You didn't mention where your location is.
AA11299986	we had a litter or should I say a hurd of 9 kittens come into the shelter about a month ago.|`|f787da25adf88f5c9415340618993e18aa	19 i think. approx 70% survival rate which is surprisingly high.|`|XNgSJsJTaa	the average number of kittens a cat can produce in 1 litter is from 3-6  however, On 7th August, 1970, a four year old Burmese called Tarawood Antigone, who was owned by Valerie Gane of Oxfordshire, UK, gave birth to nineteen kittens. The surviving fifteen kittens consisted of 1 female & 14 males.|`|AA11721942	i think its 6|`|C2uHi6nZaa	19 -  4 of which were stillborn!    http://rulingcatsanddogs.com/cat-world-r...|`|3bea5b009588f79d7e47ee88915d8693aa	I don't really know. I assume it's more than six though!|`|EBQGAhrraa	I've heard of as many as 10 kittens being born in one litter. My cat has had four kittens with both her litters.|`|I1ildb3Kaa	I believe the largest number verified was 19 but I don't know where or when or how many survived.    As a child I remember we had a cat who had several litters, one of 8, one of 7 and one of 11.  They all survived and all got good homes.|`|GLG0X9oeaa	my momma cat just gave birth to 8 kittens yesterday. she got pregnant, a couple of days after she had her last litter. i had made an appointment to have her spayed, but she was too far along and they would not do it.
s57vwCRoaa	if you mean something where all you do is feed a pet.. and its for kids.. then theres Webkinz.  probably not what ur lookin for, tho.|`|Wp1sS64faa	hey this is free http://www.adoptme.com/|`|bHWHlAFiaa	Go to your nearest halllmark store and ask for webkinz. buy one for 10 dollars.go home and log on to www.webkinz.com  and click New Member. foollow all the steps from there. you can buy more then one too!!!!|`|cKzaMGXJaa	Seems sad that the previous responders have no idea what a virtual adoption is :(  Bless you for wanting to help out in this way.        This place is in Spain,  where the atrocities to animals is quite severe there is no animal protection anything close to what exists in North America  so this organization is unique and special, Fermn Prez a teacher is Spain was horrified at  the hanging of galgoes(the spanish greyhound) or the dumping of them alive in empty wells   at the end of their hunting careers  as a means to get rid of them, so he  retired from teaching and started a sanctuary which eventually led to taking in thousands  of these dogs as well as the racing greyhounds from Barcelona ,  and trying to find homes for them across Europe and even the US,  he has grown to the capacity of taking in up to 500 animals and added a cat sanctuary    and has been struggling to expand t larger to accommodate more  because of how serious the problems in Spain are,  There are some animals that will never leave because of lack of interest in adopting or simply not suitable fas a pet, because of the sheer numbers of animals  he and his small team of helpers  depends on donations on cash, collars and coats for dogs, and even medical help, teams of vets from the US ocassionally go out to Spain to donate their services and he has set up a virtual adoption for the animals that will not likely get adopted     The video on the main page  shows his facility and some of the virtual adoption animals      IF you want to avoid the real horrible pictures of what is done to the dogs there I recommend not clicking on  the "the present day problems" Photos under galgos    The news page is like a diary of what is happening at Scooby  though there are graphic pictures on some pages   http://www.scoobymedina.com/home_en.htm    THis is the site  the US vets that helped out donating services at Scooby put together, they also sometimes bring back galgos for adoption in the US  http://operationscooby.org/
XnXbPYd5aa	That's an awfully long time between kittens.  I suspect that one is caught the birth canal and it is not going to be born naturally.    Take the cat to the vet.   He may be able to deliver the kittens or he may have to do a C-section to save the cat and any kittens still alive inside her.    Take along the kittens, in case she has to stay overnight.|`|sXSgijXnaa	no its not normal it means that she cant have it without help thats why i cant have my cats breed without a prefetional|`|Sre1oHXlaa	Usually they have them all one after another|`|StV5Lfskaa	First off: Get your cat to a vet, if you are concerned.    Secondly: Get your cat to a vet. You have no idea whether you're feeling a kitten or something else, unless you have the proper training.    If it is a kitten, no, not normal.    If it's not a kitten, you don't know what it could be, and a vet needs to look at her, just in case.|`|uJKfGPnpaa	NO! it isn't take her straight to the vet if there is a kitten it could die, or it may be breached, if you don't take to the vet the mother and the kitten could both die.|`|6traIEueaa	you need to take it to the vet if it is stuck it can die in there maybe something happened when the mother was giving brith there can be a problem the mother cat may die if the kitten stays in there hurry take it to the vet

Se proprio lo devi tenere fuori di notte a seconda di dove ti trovi e che clima c' devi fargli una cuccia idonea eventualmente anche riscaldata moderatamente, inoltre se tutto il giorno sta in casa e la notte fuori  particolarmente importante attenuare lo sbalzo di temperatura, comunque tienilo in casa, cucciolo e sar spaurito e poi non sai cosa ti perdi a non averlo intorno tutto il giorno e la notte!!!!|`|FX1I1E0Aaa	Certo che soffrono il freddo!!!! Specialmente se sono a pelo corto. Ti sconsiglio vivamente di lasciare fuori il cucciolo, perch potrebbe ammalarsi. Almeno fino ai 10 mesi dovresti tenerlo in casa, poi puoi abituarlo a stare fuori gradualmente (prima solo mezzora, poi un'oretta e cos via), ma quando fa freddo deve avere a disposizione una cuccia calda dove stare.

XKNQkwuGaa	when she gets use to u and her new home she will start going outside.right after she eats, drinks, plays and naps take her out to the same area so she will know this is where her spot is.it takes time and patience and a lot of love and praise to get her trained and up to 5mths old before they get good control over their bladders and bowels.i have a 7 yr old male husky and he was easy to train. they are smart and can be pretty layed back so teach her right away and she will be a good dog for many yrs. they like to run and have good walks and excersize but are not fond of the heat,so keep ur ac on in the summer mths and lots of cold water and shaded spots out doors.they need to be brushed as they do shed a couple of times a yr so get her use to it now. enjoy ur new buddy.|`|sXSgijXnaa	I have a husky pup too! I prefer about 15 min. after it drinks.  No tricks at all. What I would do is keep her out there for at least 5 min. She will wonder and roam around, but I wouldn't want to risk having a accident in my house.XD|`|WmgpJn9Yaa	just take them out in the yard once in a while to get it used to going outside if they need to go to the bathroom. as long as you take them out enough they should get used to going outside|`|bbf65ac787e8647d9c84345554238138aa	if she wont pee, i would try taking her for a little walk and stopping at a neighbor's mail box. normally the enticing scent from all the other dogs that have peed on that mail box will encourage your pup to urinate.|`|FjIQ1q6Oaa	i dont have a husky i have a GSD puppy what i do is i feed it and rite after take it outside and i just wait there till it goes poo and then i give it a treat but dont bother it or play/run/jump around becuase they need to consintrate
78458b25f2ae7bcdc8b613bbcd7b68d6aa	So why do you have a dog if you can't even afford a vet bill? NO one on here is going to be able to tell you whats wrong with your dog. these are ALL pure GUESSES. take him to the vet! if he's peeing everywhere, he could have a bladder infection. could also be Parvo. which WILL kill him if not taken care of immediatly. TAKE HIM TO THE VET NOW  especially since he's been sick for 4 DAYS. that's WAY WAY WAY too long to be sick. how old is he?? Has he been vaccinated?|`|MuD5oXQQaa	I think you are confusing a FREE MESSAGE BOARD with your vets office.  Easy mistake, they look a lot alike.    The vets office, though, is going to have chairs, a desk, medical equipment, pictures of dogs, VETS in white coats, other stuff like that.  Take a visit when you get a chance|`|sXSgijXnaa	lol my dog does that all the time! Has it eaten bubbles? Those had hydrogronflics in them which couses animals and human to get a reaction.

d4783e71df63ab3124e4f9a99787c05daa	I do it all the time. But how well trained is your german shepherd is the real question. It should be pretty safe because it's a big dog and  is less likely to get any real harm done to it from the bike. Plus dogs are smart enough to realize "BIG SCARY ROUND THING, MUST AVOID IT"|`|MuD5oXQQaa	It depends on how well your shepherd has been trained to run along side a bike|`|sXSgijXnaa	Well, un I think it might  get ran overed. Or somewhat to that.   I think he/she will be alright to bring. Unless it is to to to to fast and it slides you. And you are dragging on the ground?XD jk It will be ok!|`|7yKXhMkmaa	i dont see why not|`|bbf65ac787e8647d9c84345554238138aa	yeah i would say that it is. as long as he's kept securely on the lead and YOURE not distracted by him, he should love it. make sure that the leash is not so long that hes tempted to run in front of your bike.|`|79b3d0f8c17037a2e4a5a3f573d4598faa	is ur dog trained,make sure ur not near roads.is he ok with dogs.ppl etc.|`|5LMKcPinaa	Yeah, very safe, how would it not be safe? i mean just keep your dog on a leash, and ride, go slow at first tho|`|toHgwW6gaa	slowly. but they have to know not to bite you. i ride my bike with my collie and he goes after cars and bikes and kids running. but since he knows hes gonna be running he loves it. he still goes after it but i make sure my brakes are good and i keep a very good eye on him. you need to be sure he/she wont go after you or try to attack you or anything while on the ride|`|7cad134ccab9dd1e2eb2059bb5bb8661aa	first u should train ur dog to stay on one side of u, the teach it commands for when u need to slow down or turn. i run with my dogs and thats how i keep them from darting infront of me or pull me to fast.|`|yOVT8Iw9aa	It would be safe.  For your dog at least.       I had a doberman and tried this.  It didn't go so well.  The bushes and gravel she dragged me into can testify to this.     :D have fun though!|`|t3pEoNMNaa	Some pet stores sell a leash which attaches to your bicycle and keeps the pooch from getting too close to moving parts, That and a body harness instead of a neck collar should work OK, ride carefully and have fun!!!|`|fhqJRV16aa	Hi there I do not think it is safe, and also depends on where  you ride your bike.  If it is on a busy road he or she could dart out in front of moving traffic.  Or chase after another dog.  As it has been sugested, you can train your dog commands.  such as close, halt.  And then it should be done in a quite spot where there is no danger for you and your dog.
9759e8014743debd3d3fd1a7ad437c1faa	I like the Fluval, but both are good filters.    With a canister filter, the number of gallons per hour the filter pumps is less important than the volume of media space it has. More media is better. I'm not sure how these two compare in that regard.|`|AHEFXgE7aa	If you get a chance to see the pumps at work, listen to how loud they are.  If they are about the same, then bigger is usually better, so Rena.  Fluval has a good/big reputation, so you're paying for that in the price, but you know what you're getting-a good, quiet pump.    Cheers|`|rqeEhVvXaa	But the rena    Better price  better flow rate  easier to get replacement parts|`|ssHzAVlwaa	I love Fluvals! i have a fluval fx5. it works wonderfully on my 249 gal salt water. I would put the rena filstar since its cheaper and pumps more water.|`|JvTF7UrMaa	well then number 2 would be better obviousely the 175 gallon would be to powerful for your tank sorry to say xx|`|QyP0hDkJaa	Fluval 405 would be best in my opinion.|`|tMlwcim8aa	I would recommend getting the Rena. It is cheaper and has a higher rating. But be wary of weak fish because they may become frustrated or injured from the strong current. But definitely get the Rena.|`|XEKvJzGaaa	Man, people think they need a big filter hanging over the side of their tank. It's not necessary. A biological under gravel filter with the up tubes run by an air pump or powerheads is all you need. Feed your fish once every other day all that they will eat in five minutes or so and you will have beautiful water. And leave the light off most of the time.|`|m0e3a3gWaa	Gary is correct.  That's why you should get an Ehiem.  They are the best on the market.    I love the thumbs down.  Has anyone ever seen or used a Ehiem?  The have the most volume available for the filter media.

You will only add to the already over population of dogs.|`|PM23RDycaa	*face palms* Join your local breed club and find a breeder willing to mentor you. You are putting the horse before the cart here.

Do the health testing, take her to some dog shows and if she is any good, the other breeders will be falling over themselves to let you use their male.  I have advice on how to breed her.  SPAY!  If you don't know how dogs breed, you should definitely not be involved in producing puppies.
3shqoZ5Oaa	i have had 4 litters of chihuahuas and currently live with 5 of them :]  ive come to learn that small children dont do so well with this breed bc they tend to be a little to rough for such a smal breed of dog. just becareful!!|`|AA11457471	You sound like a very responsible parent. Your chances of having a small dog & a child are better than most but keep in mind that sometimes kids hurt small dogs even when they're well behaved by falling on them & other unintentional acts.  Don't forget, too that your daughter is going to be having young friends over that will want to pet & handle your cute little dog.  We had a small dog when I was that age & it wanted nothing to do with me even though I adored her.  Even in your situation I would think long & hard about it.  Best wishes!|`|tnTxHVO5aa	I have a Chihuahua and a 2 children.  You have to teach you child to be gentle and respect for your dog.|`|LBfOsZN5aa	If your child knows animal boundaries I don't see any reason to not get the puppy. They will grow together and mature together. If you took your little girl to see the puppy and it was a match made in heaven then it should be just fine. Just remember to watch her interact with the puppy for a few weeks. Chi's were made for the soul perpuse to be a lap dog and a lover.|`|70878cc978ee2e4a79b3b53284340f9caa	Yes,as long as the child knows to be gentle with such a small and delicate dog,kids and their Chis can be the best of friends.|`|eDySIDPQaa	Any breed can be snippy and snappy with a child, not just Chi.    so you need to think this over well before getting the puppy, it's little and little dogs can get hurt easier by small children.    If you are gonna watch them every time they are together, then it would be fine I think...but you should never leave a child alone with any breed of dog, no matter how small the dog is,. small dogs can do damage as well......you just have to be really careful..    good luck...|`|0dbwA1dVaa	I have a miniature Chihuahua. We got her as a puppy when I was 11 and my brother was 8, and she did very well with us. She has always been a very sweet dog, and has not bitten or harmed anyone (adults and small children alike) to this day.     I believe that if you spend time with your daughter, a LOT of time with your daughter, on how to handle a dog, how to pet them, how to hold them, how to speak to them, etc. that she should be fine. Especially if she is considerate of animals, like you say.    It is also good that you're looking into getting a PUPPY and not an adult dog... the puppy can be taught to respect and not fear small children, just as your child can be.     I'm sure that if you spend time with them both that everything should be just fine.     Good luck & God bless!|`|NyNaJmIkaa	Small children under 4 that don't understand how easily they can hurt a tiny dog wouldn't be recommended....6 years old is fine. Chihuahuas can be a kids best friend. But    Yeah, now that you mention it our little chihuahua was a bit snappy, she would snarl and snap if she didn't want to be held of picked up.       None of us cared, not like she could really hurt anyone unless you put her up to your eyeball when she was in that kind of mood, but that would be pretty stupid.     She drew blood once it was just a little nick. Maybe it's wrong but we did let her get away with everything. She wasn't scared of anything.
JwYwsrTzaa	Definitely looks like a mix with a herding breed.

Looking and the head shape, body shape  and leg length.|`|yf0tevyfaa	Looks mostly like a german shepherd but there's something about his head. His eyes are a lot bigger than any other german shepherd I have seen.    Maybe a bit of Border Collie or some Australian shepherd?|`|AM7CgQ4daa	looks like crossed with an australian red kelpie, the longer snout, thinner tale and smaller feet would all fit.|`|IFq7tVhlaa	collie?|`|cnMk2jWAaa	Aussie cattle dog looks right to me.
t6Ya3c3baa	I would put an identifying tattoo mark on the base of its tail. Such as is done on rabbit ears, or the registration number on the inside of a race horse's lip. Some dogs have their registration number tattooed on their abdomens, or inner thigh, this was done before micro-chip implantation became availiable.    Breeding rats to feed snakes is not mean. Snakes have to eat too.|`|d10wjRifaa	the best thing to do is to move the rat to keep it as a pet. Just being right there with the other rats to crowded messy and smelly what if someone mistakes it and feeds it to the snake unless hmmm put a band like they do in birds in its leg not sure if it is a good idea because it might cause blood circulation|`|bg09Dd9saa	AWW! how cute. im not allowed to breed them besause im illergic or something =S  um i think maybe you should make them a band out of knitting to put on their tails? becasue if u go with the nail polish idea they might lick it off  whilst its still wet and who know what bad thing could happen to the poor things =[.   im sorry if wasnt much help  good luck xx  Nic|`|ZGLbVjgTaa	put the snake on the rat cage and let it decide who's gonna be for dinner|`|GfvxVeZMaa	The tail tip is a good idea, they don't clean their tails so if you have anyway of marking it and then buy a cage, bedding and food and put it in there.  Remember even if you have one rat, the cage has to be pretty big. As it's a baby, it shouldn't matter for now though.    Good luck|`|JmD0oq2Naa	id go with liddy and use food dye, if it licks it off, i dont think it will harm it.|`|359b038b4cd3c83977bac8158b2c3da7aa	omg..lol!!! oh well..use those hot iron stuff with numbers on them but the mini ones..than wack it on each rats *** with different numbers.like how they do for bulls...lol!|`|3IO4zCbUaa	lol you breed rats...thats too funny|`|SFL8VnOuaa	Put a LegBand or TagIt    http://www.nationalband.com/    Your local Vet may carry these|`|2YIxnXXyaa	Tell your parents it means something to you.  Buy a cage for it and bedding, they'll know you're serious.  Try to find something particular about it, otherwise, maybe some food dye or doggy nail polish and polish it's toes I guess..I'm not big on doggy nail polish but if you really want it, give it a go.|`|yJqXmy8Caa	try a little spot of old lip stick on it's tail, cuz even if some of it rubs of a bit you can still see it in all the groove's. and plus rats dont really lick there tail.|`|XnIAEX01aa	try a spot of nail polish on its back or food dye in its fur.  :)
1uSoU8Lpaa	Cats are great. They aren't overly needy, they're self-sufficient in many ways, they don't need to go to the kennel if you'll be gone overnight or even for a week, they still need some attention to remind you that they do care and love you, they will go down to the corner of your basement to do their duty, cover the evidence with their litter (which means no taking them for walks or picking up poop off your neighbors lawn).  They don't whine and cry when you leave the house, but still come to greet you when you return. They don't beg for "people" food. Kids aren't afraid of them, they eat bugs that get into your house, etc. etc....  I like dogs too, but I can only have cats in my town house and my 2 are sweet loving animals.   Cats are great, the bad reputation comes from outdoor cats. But if you don't tame an animal, what do you expect?  My one cat is a dog in many ways though. He's very strange. He even likes car rides and sticks his little white furry head out the window. It's hilarious. Oh, and he loves water, he'll splash around in the tub like a fish. He's a weird one.  Cats can be just as affectionate as dogs, it all depends on how you 'raise' them.|`|jF1xH89Caa	They're just so cute, soft, and cuddly|`|ztzL7ntwaa	sorry b/g, i don't like cats|`|AA10487501	i love cats because they look cute to me. but i prefer dogs because they like being closer to u and seem to understand u better.|`|QpvpZ6Vqaa	eww...  i hate cats  dogs are better   but i think girl like them because   there cute and fuzzy  =)|`|uhHbcIopaa	Because they are intelligent, clean and have a 6th sense.

Dogs are great companions to take on trips with you and protect your house and love you unconditionally. Cats are great outdoors for catching rodents, and they are playful and fun.

5PsKGss7aa	You need to tell the vet what is happening with the cat when he eats the baby food.. he'll probably suggest something else.|`|AA11457471	Sounds like your cat is really congested. I'm glad to hear he's eating at all. I'd give him whatever he'll hold down as many times a day as it takes. Try thinning out the baby food with water. You can also offer him some chicken broth, canned tuna juice...whatever to help keep him hydrated.  It may also be wise to invest in (borrow?) a cool mist humidifier/ vaporizer to run in his favorite area to help break up the mucous for him. Don't use warm mist as it can cause the mucous membranes to swell.  If your cat is not improving yet you may want to ask your vet if changing antibiotics is an option.  Good luck.
dIuOXR11aa	Plain yogurt.  Mix it with the dry food or even alone.  I'd do a half of teaspoon, lol, can't O.D. on it, unless it's allergic to PLAIN yogurt!  Any plants, carpet deodorizer, maybe a new cat nip brand, in the house, kitty might have snacked on?   Call the vet, GO to the vet if the yogurt doesn't help.   Good luck, happy meows!    Hmmm, the water type, example; well water now, tap water before? That will just take time for stomach/innards to adjust.|`|GduRpnn0aa	Diarrhea is how your cat's body protects itself from toxins shes ingested. Food is forced to pass through her system quickly. Liquids are expelled before her digestive tract has a chance to absorb them, which is what causes both the liquid feces and dehydration.    Cat diarrhea is a very common problem and has many causes:    Mild food poisoning from eating spoiled food   Changes in diet   Viral infections   Parasites   Stress     In many cases, the cat simply has a very sensitive stomach, or is reacting to stressful events such as a changed environment.    If your cat gets diarrhea, heres what to do:    Try to figure out what caused your cats diarrhea. If she's eaten something toxic, get her to a vet immediately. If you think it was caused by a change in diet, put your cat back on her former diet.   Ensure your cat is drinking lots of water, to fight off dehydration.

Many different factors can trigger cat diarrhea, and this condition can have a sudden onset and short duration (acute diarrhea) or it can continue for an extended period of time (chronic diarrhea). Feline diarrhea is characterized by loose or watery stools that are passed more frequently, and often more urgently, than normal. Sometimes, blood or mucous may be present in the feces of a cat suffering from diarrhea. Often, the liquid stools will be accompanied by a bad odor. After defecating, a cat with this problem may continue to strain, and may also develop matted fur beneath its tail. Tenderness in its hind end and a loss of appetite may also be exhibited by a cat that is experiencing diarrhea.    Rather than being a disease or illness in itself, diarrhea is actually a symptom of another problem or condition. The potential underlying causes and triggers are nearly countless, and the majority of them are not serious. As a result, diarrhea is often short-lived and not a cause for alarm. However, sometimes diarrhea is a symptom of a more serious, and possibly even life-threatening, illness. In addition, even less serious diarrhea can lead to other health problems if it persists and is left untreated. This is due to the fact that diarrhea can quickly cause severe dehydration, especially in kittens.    When trying to determine whether or not your cat's diarrhea is a cause for real concern, there are a number of signs that you can look for. First of all, if your pet's diarrhea is persistent or is causing your cat a great deal of distress, consult with a veterinarian. Furthermore, there are several symptoms and warning signs that may suggest that your cat is suffering from a more serious, underlying condition. For example, if your cat has a loss of appetite and is vomiting as well as experiencing diarrhea, this may suggest that your pet is ill. In addition, abdominal pain, fever, and lethargy are other warning signs to watch out for. Also, if you observe blood in your cat's feces, you should have your pet examined by a veterinarian. Moreover, if your cat experiences diarrhea and is particularly young, elderly, or suffers from other health problems, you should contact a veterinary doctor. Such cats are particularly susceptible to developing severe dehydration, which could put their health at great risk.     Causes    There are numerous different factors and conditions that can cause cat diarrhea, some of which are more serious than others. Two of the most common causes of acute feline diarrhea are dietary changes and viral infections. Dietary changes that may be problematic can include feeding your pet rich or spoiled foods or dietary indiscretions on the part of your cat. This latter category can include eating inappropriate foods or non-food objects, or ingesting certain bugs and other critters. While viral infections may be one of the most frequent causes of acute diarrhea, bacterial, fungal, and parasitic infections can also give rise to feline diarrhea. Parasitic infections frequently involve worms, such as roundworms or hookworms.    Toxins and certain medications can also trigger diarrhea. For example, acetaminophen (Tylenol) is not safe for felines and, when ingested, can cause serious harm, a symptom of which may be diarrhea. Also, inappropriate use of antibiotics can also cause diarrhea, as can exposure to some chemicals and cleaning agents. In addition, an intestinal blockage or obstruction can also give rise to this problem. Other potential triggers include metabolic disorders such as liver disease and kidney disease. As result, there are many potential causes of feline diarrhea. In many cases, the particular underlying cause will not be serious. However, if your cat's diarrhea is persistent, particularly distressing for your pet, or is accompanied by other warning signs and symptoms, be sure to contact your veterinarian immediately. This way, if there is indeed a serious underlying condition, it can be identified and treated as promptly and effectively as possible.

Home Depot has tons.|`|GpbYrDU6aa	If it is your room-mates cat, you shouldn't really be taking responsibility for it. And, if you're both allergic, why is it even near you??? Your room-mate should know about this and be fully aware, if it's his cat, he can't just let you and her put up with it.   I suggest you get a sheet or old blanket, and throw it over the bed in the daytime, (Making sure it covers most of the bed), and when the cat comes on to groom itself, you can let all the fur go on that, and throw it all in the bin or where-ever you like when you go to bed, so you're not letting down your room-mate by saying, "This cat has to go!" But you're putting up with it yourself.
jKMH27gKaa	I used to use VIP for my cats but honestly, it didn't pay off in the long run. They don't cover normal trips to the vets, only severe accidents, and even that just a small percentage. The solution: keep her inside so she won't have a major accident or get hit by a car (which you may already be doing) and you will save a ton on vet bills -- I have three cats and they are much more healthy than the ones I had that went outside.|`|50245e5074843d3b781e05bd05ac05baaa	good luck with that. those companies are just looking to rip people off.

8Trv4fqnaa	Dogs, are perfectly fine for outside pets as long as they have good shelter. My dog loves to be in our yard, there is just so much space and so much more for him to do then being inside. We have a screened patio right as you open the backyard door so my dog loves to stay in relax there and sleep when he wants some shade or shelter from the rain. We actually put his doggy house in the patio because he is in there so much. You can bring them inside whenever you want though. The only thing complicated might be if their paws are muddy or something you might want to clean them before you bring the doggy inside.|`|ppKQEhEMaa	Its fine to have as an outside pet.

And if you do decide to keep him inside, then you will just have to teach  him what he can and can't do.  Most dogs are like two year old's, they will do what they can get away with. LOL!

If you do not want to share your home with any dog, or are out of the house for long periods then please do not get a dog in the first place.    A dog should be allowed to learn good social behaviour and be a aprt of the family, sleeping indoors and with good training will not be a problem.   If you do not want the effort of house training, of sometime shaving to clean up muddy paw marks, and dog hair, then again, do not get a dog.    Crate training is the best way for early learning, providing the dog is not left for hours in the crate (all day is a no-no) and yoour dog will appreciate having his own "safe place" to go into when he/she wants to - with a door left open and a nice soft bed inside the crate to lie on.

OaaJ7o9Haa	Cycling doesn't have a specific time table, but expect to cycle between 4-6 weeks. You have it listed that you are planning on using your platies and barbs for a fish cycling, yes? Personally I would recommend fishless cycling, which you can find all sorts of stuff about on the internet, but it's your choice. You may lose a few fish in the process.    However, it's required that you have a liquid test kit (more accurate than strip). When you cycle, take some gravel or decor from your old tank (assuming it's cycled too) and use that as a jumpstart. It'll take a while but you'll need to test ammonia, nitrites and nitrates every other day. You'll see a spike and drop in each consecutively.    In the end, your ammonia and nitrites will hit 0 while your nitrates will begin to rise. Then and only then is your cycle complete. Do an 80% water change before adding fish. Test your water at least once a week for the first 6 months and keep ammonia and nitrite at 0 while nitrates under 25ppm. Don't forget to dechlorinate your water. Also, if you're using a cartridge media filter, do not throw away the cartridge, that's where a bulk of the bacteria reside.    During the ammonia and nitrite spikes, levels may become dangerous for the fish you are cycling with and they will likely suffer from ammonia poisoning or die.. you can definitely do a small water change to lower levels but it will slow your cycling process down a little. Also, each time you add fish, the bacteria will need to adjust to the bio load. If you add more fish than your bacteria can handle, you'll see a mini-cycle kick in. Don't worry, it won't take nearly as long as the full thing, maybe just a week at most.

TYohMrlXaa	The only way too tell if a tank has cycled is to buy the necessary test kits.     This site will tell you everything you've asked. http://www.aquamaniacs.net/forum/cms_vie...|`|QyP0hDkJaa	You can tell if its cycled enough because your fish will not die if they are put in the tank. If they do die then it hasn't been cycled enough.|`|NBfBKI1Uaa	The sign of cycled tank is when you have zero levels of ammonia and nitrites and substantial level of nitrates.    If you only setup your tank a few days ago (Saturday), then I can guarantee you that your tank hasn't cycled even if you used the old filter media from the cycled tank.    I don't know what type of fish you have the tank now but an angel fishes will not survive the cycling process.      -rds

N9pKl35Xaa	I have two rottys one is 8years old and we also have his son which is about 4 now. They are not always a dominate dog, our 4yr old is as friendly as all hell but he was brought up with a fair bit of attention and he is a well behaved dog and had no intense training as a pup, just sit stay, drop.    Basic commands like the person above said, do need to be taught basically straight away (because they all turn out differently). Don't be overally affectionate with them, they can turn into complete sooks and they will follow you around and it can often lead to behaviour problems with other people and dogs due to fear. They do something right, reward them straight away without hesitation and once they start becoming more consistant and start doing things automatically extend the reward giving from straight away to after 2seconds, 4 seconds etc, they do something wrong, a short sharp 'No' or a 'utt!' noise to grab their attention always works when you need them to focus in.   Don't start them jumping or anything (by that i mean like through hoops, catching frisbees balls etc in the air) before the age of 1, allow their muscles and bones to reach maturity otherwise you'll have hip and shoulder problems.   Give them the right amount of affection, attention, obedience and you'll have a well mannered rotty. Although sometimes as they're coming out of puppy hood/late stages they can be abit obnoctious regardless of training, but they'll grow out of it!|`|A9j7ahwsaa	rottweilers are a very dominant breed. you should start a.s.a.p. not really the best choice for a first dog, so lay down the rules from day one, so that you are the boss not her. eg make her walk behind you, don't let her through the door way first, feed her after you eat not before. make sure you can take her food from her without her guarding it etc. puppy school is a must as is dog obedience training. good luck|`|5rfnEQnGaa	You can start training her from the moment she comes home providing you do reward based training.

0OvOKaTUaa	You should get another rat to keep Pockets company.  Rats are very social animals who need to be kept in pairs minimum.  However, if you do get get another rat be sure to quarantine the new rat for a minimum of 2 weeks prior to introducing them the ensure the health of the new rat.    Also, you don't want to just throw your new adoptee in with Pockets, you need to go through proper introductions.  Just as people aren't best friends the first time they meet rats have to be gradually introduced, generally over a period of one to two weeks depending on their individual personalities.  This should be done on neutral territory, always supervised, and it is helpful to put a dab of vanilla on them so that they both smell the same.      It sounds as if your two original rats were playing.  Rats often scuffle for dominance and a no blood no foul rule is usually a good guide.|`|phBze9n7aa	if you get the other rat you should put it in a seprate cage.when it gets a little over a week take both out set them on the floor and see how they react. if they react nicley then put them in the same cage.|`|UndOg7yeaa	id say it would be best to get another tank and keep them side by side...and then slowly introduce them.|`|oGVWdnHraa	When my (2) females were younger they used to do the same thing, as long as there is no bloodshed, I wouldnt worry too much, theyre probably just trying to establish who's dominant, or, like with my rats, one of yours might just be a sissy and squeaks when she is being groomed lol :)|`|hy32mGg2aa	personally i wouldnt mix different groups as they are very likely to fight.|`|yJqXmy8Caa	if you put the remaining rat with a castrated male she will calm down.|`|JmD0oq2Naa	rats will usually fight for dominance. if there is no blood, then there is no need to worry. my male rats have a go at each other all the time, but they have never hurt one another|`|ZA8vMZ7eaa	you shouldnt keep animals in a tank it doesnt have enough ventilation or  climbing opportunities, no wonder your animals fought. didnt blood from the mice give you a bit of a wake up call?

QyP0hDkJaa	Mix an yellow fish with a red fish. When the eggs are developing add a single goldfish into a small tank directly next to your "egg tank" as during development the orange fish eggs see the goldfish as its mother and consequently change to a move gold colour. If you want a rare colour variety add two different types of fish to the orange eggs and this will confuse them (As they think they have 2 mothers) and should create some very interesting colours.|`|86b135e0c5c7fa8152fab546e88b509caa	The Gold colour is down to genetics NOT environment. Its related to albinism, possibly erythristic, and therefore you can only get that colour if both parents carry those genes as it is recessive. There's no way to know if they carry the gene without seeing the parents, family history and spawn siblings.

The thing is, if your parents aren't happy, they can make it so you are not happy, always having to defend the dog and so on. I wish you luck, but especially as your father has an allergy, I don't much like your chances.    Also I would like you to consider something that I didn't think of until my partner and I started house hunting. Dogs live for about 14 years and so when you do move out you will need a place big enough and with a backyard to accomodate your dog. German shepherds are big dogs and need lots of space.   This was a problem for us when looking for our first house. We needed bigger land for the dog. This was expensive.  My mum found a similar problem with her dog. She wanted to rent a place but no one would let her take her dog.   Until you know what your living arrangements will be it's better to wait.|`|bg09Dd9saa	maybe you can make a list of 100 things taht u think y a german shepard is a good pet ?

Catch it early so your pet stays healthy.|`|acf2b6b9818bc9a9c4ec1aa812e142faaa	You need to get a vet to check his teeth out. Losing teeth so young isn't normal and is probably quite painful for him. There are all sorts of possibilities from idiopathic gingivitis (believed to be a genetic auto-immune type disease) to nutritional problems. Another possibility is that some baby teeth didn't fall out and these are only now being forced out.    The good news is that pet cats can manage fine without teeth. You'll need to switch to a food he can eat, though some toothless cats will eat some biscuit food once the gums harden. So even if the vet finds there's no way to save the teeth, he will be be okay.|`|iZPWWLqVaa	He may have just had it pulled out by something he was eating or something similar, however, Id have puss checked out by a vet for gum disease...

v6Ka4gwbaa	Hello,     My cat has had troubles with these very same problems. Crystals, bladder stones, and infections in his urine and what not.     He got to a point a little while ago where I was told he would have to have surgery to remove the stones. Another vet that worked with my other vet started him on a special diet food SD science diet wet and dry for 1 month, and it worked liked a charm. He did not have to end up having the surgery and he eventually was able to get rid of the stones and all of the other troubles.     He does still have to be on a special diet, and probably for the rest of his life, but this is to prevent any troubles from happening again or at least try too. There are options, you just have to ask and see what your vet says. My kitty is also on a Chinese herb for crystals and prevention as an extra boost of protection. It is helping like a charm.     A great food for crystals and prevention is FELIDAE. You always want to buy good healthy foods from natural pet food stores rather than the typical store brand food. Store brands are bad awful food. They are loaded with so much garbage it's ridiculous. Food plays a huge role in cat troubles and especially what's going on with yours.     You want a food that is low in ash, magnesium, fat, protein etc for a kitty that has these issues. It will help. Felidae is a great food for that! So is California Naturals. It's low in these areas and helps too.     The stones develop usually due to the many crystals, and the crystals form due to the infection in the urine, and infection can sometimes form from anything and or certain foods. It depends. If you are able to prevent infections from happening which is sometimes hard, the better.     Cats sometimes just get infections and have things happen, that's why it's best to always keep an extra watch on them, and do what you can to help. Things just happen, but don't worry, all will be well.     Try finding a good food that will help with your kitty, but for right now you've got to get those stones cleared up. Your kitty needs a special diet like SD wet and dry. However, ask your vet first. Your kitties stones may be to the point to where the food won't help. That is a possibility, but ask. My kitty was told there was no other option but surgery, but the food worked. It just depends.     Best of luck....|`|AA11589437	Some stones can be dissolved by the proper diet (struvite crystals), but oxalate crystals cannot dissolve and can block the urethra and your cat may die.

If your cat ever does show signs of severe distress, get him to an emergency clinic asap, as a blocked urinary tract can kill a cat in a matter of hours.      Wishing your cat well!|`|acf2b6b9818bc9a9c4ec1aa812e142faaa	Bladder stones or uroliths are a common occurrence in animals, especially in domestic animals such as dogs and cats. The stones form in the urinary bladder in varying size and numbers secondary to infection, dietary influences, and genetics. Stones can form in any part of the urinary tract in dogs and cats, but unlike in humans, stones of the kidney are less common and do not often cause significant disease, although they can contribute to pyelonephritis and chronic renal failure. Types of stones include struvite, calcium oxalate, urate, cystine, calcium phosphate, and silicate. Struvite and calcium oxalate stones are by far the most common.    Treatment:    Reasons for treatment of bladder stones include recurring symptoms and risk of urinary tract obstruction. Some stones can be dissolved using dietary modifications and/or medications. Small stones in female dogs may possibly be removed by urohydropropulsion, a nonsurgical procedure. Urohydropropulsion is performed under sedation by filling the bladder with saline through a catheter, holding the dog vertically, and squeezing the bladder to expel the stones through the urethra. Bladder stones can be removed surgically by a cystotomy, opening of the bladder. Stones lodged in the urethra can often be flushed into the bladder and removed, but sometimes a urethrotomy is necessary. In male dogs with recurrent urinary tract obstruction a scrotal urethrostomy creates a permanent opening in the urethra proximal to the area where most stones lodge, behind the os penis. In male cats, stones lodge where the urethra narrows in the penis. Recurrent cases can be treated surgically with a perineal urethrostomy, which removes the penis and creates a new opening for the urethra.    To prevent recurrence of stones, special diets can be used for each type of stone. Increasing water consumption by the animal dilutes the urine, which prevents oversaturation of the urine with crystals.

SnAsZapMaa	None.  Whether they are gay or miserable has nothing to do with it.    The point is that dogs are NOT suitable as surprise presents.    I have accepted that a relative arranged beforehand to pay for the pup IF their birthday person chose one, but I insist that every actual future owner MUST choose the pup him/her-self, because I know that in the best dog-human pairings there is an almost-mystical bond. (One  business person who had second choice saw "his" choice picked by the lass who had first choice, so he left. Then he came back and offered her double my price to choose a different pup so he could have "his" pup.)    A pet is a COMMITMENT, not a gift that can be auctioned off or discarded at the back of a "For garage sales" box if it doesn't suit.    You obviously DON'T know the couple well enough to be able to choose a suitable pup.  Proof 1: You don't even know what breed or breeds THEY would like!  Proof 2: You certainly don't know whether they would want one to win in conformation shows, or would want to compete in obedience training trials, or would want to race around an agility course, or would want to train it as a personal protection dog, or get involved in search&rescue, whatever.  I'll bet you haven't even thought to check whether either of them is allergic to dog dander, let alone whether they are so house-proud that they would HATE having a hair-shedding dog around.    So either give them an inanimate gift that includes a refund-receipt in case it doesn't suit them or they already have one, or create a fancy voucher promising to pay for any puppy they choose during the next 12 months - if cost worries you, stipulate a price range; maybe check with a humane society shelter what they charge for dogs they allow to be rehomed then stipulate that the engaged couple can get any pooch they like from that shelter during the next 12 months.    But do NOT give ANYONE a living creature that might not suit them at all - have respect for both your human acquaintances and the non-human living creatures.

NO RESPONSIBLE BREEDER WILL GIVE YOU A  PUPPY TO GIVE AS A ENGAGEMENT GIFT,. NEVER BUY FROM  A PETSTORE, BACKYARD BREEDER, PUPPY MILL OR NEWSPAPER OR ONLINE WEBSITE SUCH AS PENNYSAVER,PUPPYFIND,PUREBREDPUPS, THEY ARE IRRESPONSIBLE.     THE FACT IS NO PUPPY/DOG SHOULD BE CHOOSEN BY SOMEONE ELSE OTHER THEN THE OWNER TO BE, They are the ONLY ones that KNOW what breed suits their lifestyle, energy require and the size of house and whether they can AFFORD the COST of the dog lifelong care, they NEED to match the dog to their LIFESTYLE. and if they   Number 2; Puppies cannnot be LEFT alone for any MORE then 2hours. 8week old puppies need to have trainning, socialisation, and housetrainning and  they need feeding 3 times a day, breakfast, lunch, dinneruntil 6month old, then 2 feeds a day after that.    Think Before Giving  Adding an animal companion to the family is an important decision. It means making a permanent commitment to care for and spend time with the animal and to provide for his or her lifelong care.      Before adopting, consider the time and money involved in proper animal care. Will your loved one have the time and patience to exercise and housetrain the animal? Is he or she prepared to pay for food, accessories (such as toys, grooming supplies, leashes and harnesses, and bedding), inoculations, and veterinary care, including spaying or neutering, flea treatment, deworming, and emergency care?     If a family decides to adopt an animal, every member of the family should go to the local animal shelter together to choose the animal, having already discussed the obligations and long-term commitments involved. Please, never buy from breeders or pet stores, and always practice your ABCsanimal birth control. For every animal purchased from a breeder or a pet shop, a potential home is taken away from a homeless dog or a cat at a local animal shelter.     Children May Not Be Ready  Small children may unintentionally harm animals, even breaking their fragile bones or causing other fatal injuries, when they think they are playing. Puppies, kittens, bunnies, chicks, baby ducks, and other young animals are especially vulnerable.    We have heard too many stories about families in which the child has lost interest in an animal, and the adult is forced to make the difficult decision on the best way to "solve" the problem. Often this means turning the animal over to a crowded shelter or pound orworsepassing the animal on to a series of homes, causing trauma, psychological scarring, and behavioral problems.   Too Few Happy Endings  Animal shelters are filled beyond capacity with homeless animals, many of whom were former "pets" who, for one reason or another, didn't fit into someone's lifestyle. No matter how much they would like to, many people who receive animals as gifts find that they are unable to make the lifelong commitment to care for their new companion.     Sadly, many people end up turning animals they received as gifts over to an overburdened humane society or animal-control agency that is likely filled to capacity. In worst-case scenarios, some people even abandon animals on the road or in the back yard when they move away.   What You Can Do   ?Don't ever give an animal as a gift.  If you have discussed the idea with the prospective recipients and know that they have the time, willingness, ability, and resources to properly care for an animal and make that serious commitment, consider offering them a gift certificate from the local animal shelter.  ?If you attend a fair, flea market, or other event at which animals are being given away, educate those who are responsible. If people are offering free kittens or puppies, for example, explain the risks of giving animals to unknown passersbysome people sell dogs and cats to laboratories or dealers, and others abuse, neglect, or abandon them.  ?Sign our pledge saying that you will never buy an animal from a pet store or a breeder and that you will always practice your ABCs (animal birth control) by spaying or neutering your animal companions.    RESPONSIBLE GIFT-GIVING ALTERNATIVES     Instead of giving a pet as a gift:          - Ask your local SPCA, pet rescue organization, or animal shelter whether they sell gift certificates. Give the gift certificate instead of a pet. The recipient can then go and choose their own pet, one whose personality and care requirements matches her own personality and lifestyle.        - Hand-craft a gift certificate or a pet gift basket. Offer to pay for the adoption fee of a new pet, or package up a nice basket filled with useful pet care items and treats, for whenever the recipient decides to adopt a pet.          SPECIAL OCCASIONS     The temptation to give a cute pet as a gift can be particularly strong around special occasions such as birthdays or holidays. Resist the temptation; special occasions are often filled with noise, crowds, and plenty of activity. This is a stressful introduction for both the pet and for the people! Wait until the things have settled down and you have time to spend with your new pet.          LIFELONG COMMITMENT     People surrender their pets for a number of reasons. In the case of "surprise pets", it's most often because someone in the family didn't get along with the pet or never wanted one to begin with - or the novelty of having a pet simply wore off.     Adopting a pet is a lifelong commitment. When bringing a new pet into your family, everyone in the family should have a chance to meet and spend time with the pet before making the decision to adopt. Remember, pets are family, too!       Possible Better engagement gifts|`|XEbe4Votaa	Agreed - dogs are NOT gifts.  It's a just plain terrible idea in every way.|`|UndOg7yeaa	being gay has nothing to do with it. some guys are femme and some are masculine. also id recommend asking them if they want a dog...id hate for them to take your gift to the shelter...if they decide a dog would be nice. why dont you go to your shelter and get a gift certificate or pay for a dog/puppy upfront and let them pick it out...just think youd be saving a life...    if you get one though i prefer boxers i own two but thats me.|`|Ulff1hcDaa	Never give a live animal as a gift.

GIve them a card with a cheque to spend on a dog of their choice.  Don't ruin a dogs life (or your friends potentially for the next 15 years) for the sake of 1 hrs glowy feeling as you hand over a puppy with a bow round its neck.|`|2c844fcf526bc2b90f16b7c425e11aa7aa	A dog is not a suitable surprise gift for anyone - ever - irrespective of their personal orientation...and what does them being gay have to do with anything?  Why would you even think to mention it?    Surely you don't think that certain breeds of dogs would be better for gay people as opposed to straight people.   Not slightly homophobic are you?|`|m81dfyOYaa	LOL. I don't of any breed of dog that is bred specifically for people based on their sexual orientation. Giving an animal as a gift is not a good idea, stick to conventional type engagement gifts they'll be much happier.|`|d6HXwlpPaa	I have to agree a dog is not an apropos gift, the human needs to feel a bond with his pet but if they asked for one or you are that close to them they would trust your decision, you must get them a rare and extremely beautiful and smart dog like a Boykin Spaniel. They are hypo allergenic as far as I can tell and everyone stops to ask what breed they are, so they will be the center of attention.

I assume that they are adults and capable of making their own choices?  besides, dogs make terrible gifts.|`|XI2iylR4aa	It's nice that you're thinking about buying a nice gift, but pets are not nice gifts.    Which dog a family gets is a highly personal decision.  Even if they LOVE a certain breed, they still need to pick out a specific dog.      Also, pets are terrible gifts because they come with a bill attached.  Now the couple will have to feed, care for, and buy supplies for this dog.  It's like giving them 13 years worth of added expense.    If they get a dog on their own, it would be a very nice idea to buy some supplies for the pup, though.|`|zZZnQuQJaa	Dog's make HORRIBLE gifts, especially when the recipient isn't part of picking the breed.    Give them a Gift Certificate for "Lunch and a Dog".  Go treat them to a nice lunch, then the 3 of you can go to the local shelter and you can let them pick out a dog that is suitable for them.|`|RPSouJzaaa	Are you an idiot?    First off, giving a dog as a gift could be the worst possible thing you could ever do. Dog's are not gifts that you can just hand over for a special occasion. They're pets and they become part of the family. Never give a dog as a pet.    And as for what would be "appropriate" for a gay couple? What kind of ignorant question is that? it doesn't matter if you're gay, straight, transgendered or asexual. You can't decide what kind of dog is "appropriate" for you just by your sexual orientation. You need to consider your home, lifestyle, personality, activity level, budget, space requirements, and so much more.|`|ZTsdpQsraa	A stuffed toy, an art print, or a sculpture depicting a dog is an appropriate present. A real, living dog is a horrible present.|`|AA11589437	Do not EVER give dogs as a gift.  A dog is a great responsibility and commitment that the people in question must think seriously over. Most gift dogs end up unwanted and abandoned, or killed in a shelter.  If these guys wanted a dog, I am sure they would have gotten one. You can't impose such a responsibility on a person. You shouldn't even give a goldfish as a gift, let alone a dog!|`|5rfnEQnGaa	PLEASE, NEVER, EVER give a dog to anyone as a gift !    A responsible breeder would not ever let you take a dog to give as a gift in any case as they will always want to match the dog/puppy to the individual and make sure that the new owner really wants the puppy.    Would you give someone a child as a gift?      It's pretty much the same thing - a dog lives for around 14 years and to be a wanted, well loved member of the family for life then the people who (hopefully want a dog) should be choosing it themselves.    I repeat, THINK AGAIN and do not get a living animal.|`|fdsKB9Shaa	All of my gay friends have a yorkie!|`|cmhDgruqaa	any type of dog is good for them. their not any diffrent because their GAY.

2YIxnXXyaa	Clicker trainers are GREAT!  They work really well.  First you have to let them know how it works.  You click, then give them a treat, do that about three or four times.  Then proceed to train them.  They sit, you click and then give them a treat within three seconds of them sitting and the click.  My dog was a pain in my butt to train, we took him to the training class and they had those and it was brilliant.  If you need any help, let me know.  Good luck.|`|u3Hdoeiqaa	Clicker training is fantastic. It works so well because it makes training much easier for the animal to understand, your timing is much better etc. It is also fun and  safe and humane.    Clicker training (the theory) has been used to train everything from goldfish, to competition dogs, to performing dolphins and even human athletes!    Just make sure you know what you are doing first though - read the books, or find a good clicker training to watch and get advice from. I have seen a few people do it wrong, which obviously makse it ineffective.    Personally I think the principle is easy to understand and apply, and it is well worth it for the great results! I would check out Karen Pryor's books as a good starting point.|`|ctiKoGGfaa	clickersolutions.com and clickertraining.com. It saved my pups life.

AA12335126	Toys Toys Toys!!! They need stuff to keep them busy partly so they don't chew your house up, literally. Make sure you have plenty of room for it to run and get it's exercise. As far as a crate goes your best bet is to just buy one of the big wire ones, they grow FAST! I have a pit and cur mixed 7 months old and he stands well above my knee. If you're on a budget go yard selling! Dollar stores are awesome for chew toys and snacks.|`|AA12243955	First of all...check out this site and READ the WHOLE thing.... then get back to me....  http://www.realpitbull.com|`|AA10341270	Tons of toys! If you don't keep him occupied, he will destroy your house! Good Luck!!!|`|AA11715935	Pit Bulls have historically been bred for fighting other animals. Dog aggression is, therefore, "in their blood." Excellent people skills and rock-solid temperaments are as well.    Just as a herding dog will chase, a pit bull has a tendency to want to fight with other dogs. Could be every dog he sees, could be every 100th dog he sees. Could be only yellow dogs with black spots. Could be only females, only males. It's not an exact science, but it's up to you to know what triggers your dog. NO MATTER HOW "well-socialized" Buster is, this "genetic whisper" is in his ear. In one litter of pit bull pups, you will likely find a huge range of aggression, from none to lots. Most are in the middle somewhere.    IN MOST CASES, DOG-AGGRESSION DOES NOT EMERGE UNTIL SEXUAL MATURITY, IN MOST CASES BETWEEN AGES TWO AND THREE. So, take your pit bull puppy to the dog park, have a blast, teach him about the dog world, get him used to a variety of people, dogs, sights, sounds and surfaces, and around 9 months of age, start watching him like a hawk for dog-aggressive signs. (Learn to recognize the signs . . . rough play doesn't equal fighting . . .and also, please, try to relax!)    If you see signs of aggressive behavior, BE HONEST WITH YOURSELF and REMOVE HIM FROM DOG-PARK SITUATIONS. Keep him active in the world, however, but at your side, ON A LEASH.    ***Consider yourself lucky to own a dog that is so wonderful with people, the skill that really matters.***    While he is on a leash, don't let him sniff other dogs and vice versa. Dog trainers agree that all dogs on leash tend to be more aggressive - they can't express normal dog body language, they feel they must defend you . . . trust us, it's just a bad idea all around.    PLEASE don't let dog aggression become an excuse for isolating him! Just because he might be dog-aggressive doesn't mean he can't control himself, act polite, go to obedience class, go on neighborhood walks, etc. Like humans, dogs have the ability to learn self-control. Let him become worldly and you'll have a better dog. Just don't tempt fate at the dog park. IT IS YOUR JOB TO PROTECT YOUR DOG.    While you're at it, never, ever leave Buster unsupervised with another dog. Even with Buster Two, his life-long buddy and housemate. Crate one and let one roam or crate both (in their own cages of course), keep one in the kitchen and one in the bedroom, but "keep 'em separated."    But what about this one pit bull I knew . . .    Of course there are exceptions to this rule. There ARE non-dog-aggressive pit bulls, and there are dog-aggressive beagles. BUT these are the exceptions!    *PLEASE BE HONEST WITH YOURSELF AND BE PREPARED.*    Yes, your pit bull puppy loves all dogs, this is common!    No, your pit bull adult will probably not love all dogs! This is also common!    Despite your best intentions and socializing experiences, your adult Buster will probably harbor SOME dog-aggressive tendencies. This is a fact, accept it, deal with it and move on. (It's not your fault, either, it's called genetics.)    "But he looooves people!"    Of course he loves people. . . he's a pit bull!! Dog aggression and human aggression are two TOTALLY DIFFERENT THINGS. Pit bulls are some of the most stable, PEOPLE LOVIN' DOGS OUT THERE.    The majority of pit bulls defer to and adore humans!! They are supreme examples of "man's best friend." They are not the best guard dogs for this reason. Remember that people-aggression and dog-aggression are VERY different drives, and this misconception has hurt more pit bulls than we like to ponder.    So now what do I do? YOU, my friend, join the ranks of the creative, energetic souls who proudly own pit bulls! Please see "your pitbull is an athlete" for tons of ways to have fun with your dog!!    (here are two fun ideas)    Your own private dog park?!    Ok, the verdict is still out on this one. But just as pit bulls can love and be cool with their doggie housemates, we believe that in a carefully controlled environment Buster and his friend Marilyn, the All-American mutt next door, can enjoy regular play dates. You eliminate the chaos and stress of a dog park situation, you and Marilyn's owner are close by and prepared to break up a fight, should it occur, and Buster has grown accustomed to Marilyn, after a careful introduction IN NEUTRAL TERRITORY, out on a neighborhood walk, with yummy treats. Don't let them touch, just walk 'em, side by side, and keep the treats coming. After a few blocks, the dogs will become relaxed (even bored) around each other. (if not, then this may not be a good plan, and call it a day). There is no new influx of dogs every 15 minutes, and you are familiar with Buster and Marilyn's playing style. You are in control. Approach with caution, but still, give it a try, you might find it a great compromise between total isolation and the overwhelming scene at the dog park!    Java Pit    A great way to practice "down/stays" and social skills is to bring Buster to the local Java Hut. Set up at an outdoor table (of course) enjoy your coffee and let Buster enjoy the passing parade of people, bikes, cars, and other dogs. Pit bulls adore being "part of the action" like this, and it teaches them about all sorts of things. They will be consumed and highly entertained by the sights, sounds and smells of the city. Make a list of dog-friendly coffee shops and restaurants and frequent them often! The more you go, the easier it gets, even if you have to tie Buster to your waist to get him to stay still and anchored, soon enough, he will "get it!"    A final tip    If walks and trips to the coffee shop seem daunting because your dog likes to act macho to every passing dog, try this: practice on short walks around the neighborhood. When you see a dog coming toward you|`|AA11598334	We have a metal cage for our Pitt. The kind of cage that is open on all sides so when he's in there, he can look around. My dog also chews up a storm. When he was teething, I took a sock and knotted it all up (so it doesn't look like a sock), ran it under water and froze it. He loved it. May I also suggest a Kong toy. Every time we leave him in his cage, we fill the Kong with peanut-butter.|`|c4c922bcfcc4b1a2a4866fb1262008f3aa	CREATE FOR TRAINING IS NUMBER ONE AND THEN KONG TOYS AND A GOOD OLD TENNIS BALL IN A TUBE SOCK WORKS GOOD WITH YOUNG DOGS AND PLEASE HAVE THE DOG FIXED DO NT BECOME ONE OF THOSE PEOPLE THAT THINKS THEY NEED TO BE A BREEDER NEXT YEAR|`|AA10117527	The number one thing that you need for your new puppy is a trainer for both the dog AND you!  I get the impression that your experience with ANY dog- let alone a pit bull is limited.  Pit bulls can be wonderful pets and they can also be unpredictable monsters.  You need to learn how to control your doggie and keep him happy, busy and socialized. Go to  your local pet store and talk to the manager about crates, food, toys and various necessities. Talk to your local vet about annual medical costs and neutering. If your budget is too limited to do it right, don't do it at all.  An unhappy or unsafe or under cared-for pet is really uncool.

AA11452599	Papillons because they are less common.  The less common, the less inbreeding and the less likely that you will have a dog with some sort of genetic problem.|`|AA11715935	If you've got small children, I'd suggest a Papillon 'cause Papillons are very friendly toward little children while Chihuahuas are dangerous to children under 10.|`|29575138fce7f69706c4b3a917c6fef5aa	I just think that papillon are so much cuter! But they need more maintenance with their fur...|`|0168653355bfbf76647de8915c3bf5c5aa	I wouldn't say neither one is better. It depends on your lifestyle. If you have small children don't get a toy breed. Chihuahuas are velcro dogs and be prepared for vet bills. They need dentals and sometimes have bad knees. I would rather see people adopt then buy a pup. You know the quirks of an older dog and so many need good homes.|`|AA11159620	First off there is no "teacup" any breed, there is just really small dogs of that breed (meaning that it is a default in the breeding and no real breeder would call it that). So my vote would be for the papillon, though for either of them do you know what the breed is like, hair maintenance, diseases, and behavior. We cannot tell you which is a better breed, papillon or chihuahua, as we don't know what your life style is like and your personal tastes. I can tell you one thing about both these breeds is that they have a tendency to get yappy or show dominate behavior if you treat them like a baby and not a dog (Watch Cesar Mulliun) and they can easily break a leg if they jump off from too high a spot (spinnly legs). For more information and possible breeders go to the AKC website, they have both these breeds listed.|`|160c9069c00cfd09f44a75df1d5ae81daa	A Chihuahua is the ultimate lap dog, velcro dog, best friend dog.

The papillion won't shed as much as the teacup, but the hair will need to be taken care of more. (Cuts will obviously cost you money...unless you are a Do It Yourself-er.) They are a bit more hardy than the teacup, if you have kids...You know the being stepped on and such... The chihuahua won't need the hair cuts, and both are "yappy" dogs. They bark incessantly when a visitor comes in. Both are very protective of "their person." Both are sweet dogs, and cute. I think the papillion would age cuter...|`|AA12323657	u should get a chihuahua bc they r so cute!|`|AA12044550	there is no such thing of a teacup
AA11502044	Cattle dogs are extremely brave, intelligent and active.  These traits can either make one of the best pets, or one of the most dangerous.  If you don't give them enough exercise and training they end up bored and will usually turn into terrors.        I have a cattle dog that knows the commands sit,stay (she will easily wait in place for an hour while I shop) lie down, up (to jump onto something or climb a ladder) down, jump (as in a fence), in, out (to move away from me) and fetch. She learnt all of these when I got her at six months and it took me only a few weeks.  She is excellent around kids and chases all wildlife away.|`|AA12261175	You really must exercise them a lot- that means running.  They are extremely loyal and affectionate AND protective.  They are not mean, but they will not allow anything bad to happen to you.  They are one of THE smartest breeds- learn, understand, listen, remember.  It's great if you can get a mix- I have an aus. cattle mix whom I rescued  5 years ago and he has been a prince.  These dogs are often one-dog shows.  By that I mean he does not want another dog in the picture in our house.  Very friendly outside the house and yard tho-plays well with others.|`|5807de872b8e3303c225e38c755ec77eaa	Be a little more specific...I have no idea what you're saying. Sorry. : ) An aussie dog?

AA10607664	The tiger is a 'concealment and ambush hunter', carefully stalking prey, circling in as closely as possible, and then suddenly charging the target from behind.     When hunting, this cat circles around to approach downwind from its quarry and may take twenty minutes to creep over ground which would be covered in under one minute at a normal walk.     At a distance of approximately 50 feet the tiger will sometimes pause, seemingly hopeful that its target may inadvertently move closer and so lessen that critical attack distance. The cat will raise and lower its head, judging the distance and angle, before finally raising its body and charging.    A tiger will not normally charge at prey until it has made some abrupt movement, but will endeavour to get in closer, so increasing the chances of a successful kill. Nor do charging tigers roar, or make any sound during an attack. For the prey, death comes silently.     Tigers also lie on the tracks to waterholes. Then they wait until a victim comes close and spring up, utilising the element of surprise. This ambush method of hunting uses less energy and has a greater chance of success.|`|AA10740247	smell and sound|`|fc5e8dbb0c8aebb2153e594da7da5e82aa	They use stealth.|`|AA10770115	They lie in wait.

AA11728937	begging and whining are not the answer. you must show your dad that you are responsible enough to care for the dog yourself. animals need lots of love and attention. you must be willing to sacrifice the time to ensure that your pet will be housebroken and trained, that it will be properly groomed and exercised, get all his shots and of course, fed. once you show your dad that you are capable and willing to do these things, then maybe he will consider allowing you to have a dog. if you're not responsible now, your father is not going to listen to you whining about a dog|`|648a51f0ca1f8178859620c9bff3371daa	Show him that you are responsible enough to take care of it.

Actually its not as common as you think that pitbulls attack people. It does happen, but sometimes my pet poodle wants to bite me too.  It all depends on the temperment of the dog.|`|52a3326d9ce1a778637b9a1655d37bedaa	It's not the breed, but the temperment.  All breeds can be dangerous, pit bulls are just usually the ones that make the news.  If someone owns a pit that knows it's temperment and raises/treats it right, it will never bite.  The problem is no one ever seems to do research when they buy/adopt an animal.    No matter what, a dog is a dog, no matter the breed.  Don't blame the pit bulls.|`|40979705a84c9095b7b9db95a3bd4969aa	I have a shih tzu and a pit bull; and all's I have to say is i'm more afraid of the shih tzu.|`|510397f187d2363028e168516930b039aa	pitbulls dont hurt people 24/7 ,what most people dont understand about the breed is this...they origanally were bred to be animal agressive NOT PEOPLE AGRESSIVE...its not the dog its the people who raise it..i raised american pitbull terriers for over 10 yrs..and never had one to bite a child  but i had a rottweiler put 97 stitches in a 2 yr old child..there are places now that use pittbulls in police work ...serch and rescue and work for disabled...give them a break...like any  dog years of bad breeding can change  a dogs breed from a great one to a scarey one...|`|306a5da7a4bbe9184cd02f0c766e26b8aa	They don't, the media just hypes it up.   I wouldn't believe much of what the media or the AR groups say about most topics.       A few a year is 24/7 to you?  Many more people get killed by their PARENTS each year than by Pit Bulls.  Why do parents kill their kids 24/7?     When an attack (by any breed) happens it is usually because the dog is roaming loose and/or a kid is unsupervised.  Its the PEOPLE!  Confine your animal and supervise your kids!|`|922ac6a295dba380799555f2f867b09baa	they don't. pitbulls can be kind gentle dogs. people can raise any dog to be mean or an attack dog. its just people seem to like the pitbulls to be used in dog fights and things like that. they actually are very sweet dogs.|`|6fbe24ed9b220b514c82326af10b3d62aa	first of all questions like this make me mad pitbulls dont attack ppl 24/7 and if they do its bc they gotta bad owner that made them mean i have a pit and its the nicest dog ive had he wouldnt hurt a flea thats bc im nice to him and so is everyone else|`|AA11466266	they don't.  when a pit bull has been given the propper socialization and training as a pup you end up with a lovely dog.|`|AA11346597	they don't....as other people here have answered, some smaller dogs are worse biters. It's just that pit bulls have a VERY strong bite, and can do more damage, so you hear these stories in the media more often. The square shape of their head is partly due to their really strong jaw muscles.|`|6373ff8cf7ffe5939674dacef3073eb0aa	Where do you get the idea they hurt people 24/7?  If it is the media I suggest looking deeper.  Most people group any blount snouted, bully looking dog as a "pitbull".  Chances are the dogs that are attacking are mixed breeds, or some other similar looking breed.  If an American Pit Bull Terrier, Am Staff, or Staffy attack a person, the blame can almost surely placed on the owner, NOT THE DOG!|`|AA10378318	Any dog will hurt people if trained/taught to do so.  It is all on how you raise your dog.  I have a Pitbull and he happens to be the best dog I have ever had.  And everyone I know thinks so.  Don't be so ingnorant to think that all pits a mean or vicious because they are not.  They just have that stereoptype associated with them.|`|AA10237273	What a ridiculous statement to make.  the only sensuible answer to your question is 'Because they don't ' . Pitbulls and other similar breeds (Ameriacn Staffordshire Bull terrier and the English Staffordshire Bull Terrier) Have a lot going against them.  A lot of people want a pitbull meely as a status symbol or to make them take part in barbaric dog-fights, these are not the kind of people who should own ANY breed of dog. And as aresult the dogs they own may be a liability and give the breed a bad name.  Pitbulls are less likely to bite than many (most) other breeds, they are just capable of causing horrendous damage if it does occur.  Pitbulls are dog aggresive, not people aggresive as mentioned above , often described as having a Jeckyl and Hyde personality, gentle as a lamb with people but without carefull socialisation they can be overcome with an urge to destroy other dogs. This would be my worry about the breed, that some idiot would let it attack my dog either intentional or through neglect (it almost happened to me and the owner was lucky I didn't attack him for endangering my retreiver ).  Restrictions on the breed may help in the long run , but an outright ban is ridiculous|`|AA11208224	oh wow are you ignorant.   pit bulls do not always hurt people.  a german shephard is more likely to attack than a pit bull.  i have two.  theyve been around a newborn baby, other dogs,  other ages of kids.  they are great dogs.  its all baout how you train them and socialize them. i wouldnt trade mine for any other dog in the world|`|fd6d3f671af348d710da6c386faee999aa	They don't, it's that they were bred for fighting and wars so sometimes even though sometimes one might have been always raised with love and care, it might snap and it's instinct to kill and hurt others will take over.  This is why they're outlawed in miami.|`|AA12083992	I have an amstaff that has never bit anyone. My neighbor on the other hand has a little ankle biter that did just that as I was going to my house from my car after work one day. Not all pits bite, some do. Dogs of all breeds can and do bite. Biting is not according to breed, it is according to dog.|`|AA12315242	They dont. Only bad owners cause that to happen. Any dog can bite. But Pit bulls have a bad rap. They are no more agressive than any other dog. They are just trained poorly or well trained to fight.|`|AA12056382	They don't hurt people more often but the damage they do when they bite is more severe due to the strength of the bite and the aggressive nature of the dog. They are some of the most loyal dogs and the best dogs WHEN TRAINED PROPERLY. The pit bulls that bite are usually the ones that the owner lets them run loose and they have never been trained to mind.   Any dog that is not handled properly is prone to attack in a stressful situation.   This is the owners fault and not the fault of the dog.     I have a rat terrier that if left to her own devices she would be an attack dog. But I have trained her to mind me and socialized her properly. So she can be aggressive still but I watch her and make sure I intervene before she can become aggressive with anyone. i.e. I keep her on a leash and hold her when anyone knew comes in the picture until she can get used to them and knows they are ok.     Do you remember the lady in France that had her face eaten off by the family dog? It was a labrador. All dogs have the potential to harm us.|`|c3c7aa8de2e7890e353eaf7858a40b18aa	because there trained that way duh!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!...|`|AA11629196	Pitbulls don't hurt people, people hurt people.

AA11315746	I admittedly know nothing of this particular breed, but from experience with many other breeds, can tell you this.  He is a puppy, at this age, playing is what they do best.  Get him some chew toys and a couple of balls and let him rip.    As for him not taking instruction, they are not born trained, it is up to you, as the owner/caretaker to properly train your dog.  To do this you need to start now, I suggest you get a copy of "Dog Training for Dummies" as it has some great, simple techniques for teaching a dog its manners.|`|2a4dfad474db2069802976af75e55dfcaa	ALL PUPPIES ARE PLAYFUL!  It is their nature, just like kids. And Dogos are a rough and tough hunting breed from South America, bred to hunt and catch rough game so they are an especially active type of dog. If you want a dog to lay around the porch, frankly, you should have gotten something a bit different.    As far as taking instruction goes, a good obdience school will make your pup into a good canine citizen and a much more enjoyable pet.|`|b02cd5dab19033353c770b84049476eeaa	He is a puppy and will play a lot. As far as not taking instruction, is he deaf? Has he been BAER tested? Also obedience training is a must with a Dogo as like the previous post stated, they are a large dominant hunting dog with high prey drive. They will catch cats and other animals, they were bred to hunt wild boar. If not properly trained and socialized you will end up with a dog you cant handle. The Dogo is not the breed for everyone

I had a friend who had the same problem.  If I hadn't seen him (the cat) in action I wouldn't have believed it.  He really bit hard and left marks. Here was the solution for her cat - get another cat.  They need playmates of their own kind.  Your cat probably is bored and needs more activity than you can provide and another cat would be perfect.    Personally, I'm against squirting cats.  Would you do that to a child?  Of course not!|`|669ae00b95ec28c9cc9fc9fc6b52159aaa	they want to play. that is how kittens play with each other|`|a61dba48a983fa5c3d20f3d5a3f752deaa	Cats experience OVER STIMULATION: If your cat's aggression comes about suddenly while you are petting him, it may be caused by an abnormal sensitivity, especially noticeable at the base of his tail. If stroking your cat leads to him kneading with his front paws and even drooling, he could be getting over stimulated. His reaction to this over stimulation can be a sudden burst of aggression.     Stroking your cat repeatedly from head to tail is most likely to cause over stimulation and should be replaced with gently scratching his head and neck only. If your cat suddenly puts one or both ears back against his head while being stroked, gently stand so that your cat drops onto the floor and return to your seated position to avoid passing your cat with your feet while he is still charged up.    If it is strictly play related biting a squirt in the face with a WATER filled squirt bottle/gun, or flicking your cats ear/nose with your finger followed by a stern NO works best.|`|6437565f4f28e1c9b0020828a0856b7daa	You can not.

Take each cat out there and show them where their litterbox is... Then let them out from time to time and see what they do. This worked with my cats when I wanted to make them outside cats. After they are really familiar with where their litterbox is, you can remove it and throw it away- it shouldn't take too long, because cats are pretty smart and usually pick up on things easily. However, do NOT keep an inside litterbox "just in case" because they will still use it regularly.|`|AA12362317	you could place the a litter box outside in the garden for a few weeks so they get used to going out there.  Of course you have to show them where it is.  After they get the hang of it, you could take the box away and put litter in the spot.

If that doesn't work, put a litterbox outside for them to start with then you might be able to remove it.    If that doesn't work, use an extra litterbox where there current one is and slowly move it out to where you want them to go.     If you want them to go in the same spot, have a look online for a self composting litter box. You use pine chips and potting mix in a hole, top it up occasionally and it can be put on your flower garden and changed out every 6 months.|`|d3af4e4d75ca03c30477ba59b4355727aa	What we have done with our cats is to gradually move the litter box so that it gets closer to the place you want them to go. Do this over the period of a week or two so that they don't keep going where the box used to be. Once the box it moved out side, the cats usually figure they can go anywhere.|`|AA11638305	See what happens if you remove the indoor litter box.  Cats generally are very clean animals - and since they are used to the indoor box, that is where they go.  I have a story about an outdoor cat who came into my first floor flat to use the litter box!! so even outdoor cats are clean, too.    Someone else made a good suggestion - take some of the dirty litter and put it outside in the other area you've created for the cats and they will sniff that and began to use that for their litter box.    Once you remove the indoor litter box, make certain that the cats are not starting to go indoors.

AA11847885	The proper way to groom a BG is indeed to handstrip.  Lucky for you, BGs (at least in my experience) don't take as long to strip properly as some other terriers.  The pattern is a bit similar to the Schnauzer pattern on the body--check out the picture at the AKC site: http://www.akc.org/breeds/brussels_griff...  I usually scissor the legs very lightly to neaten them, and neaten up the feet.  The head stays round, kind of like a little lion mane.  I scissor that lightly, too, just to reinforce a nice shape.  I use thinning shears to get a natural-looking ear.      You can always consult one of the all-breed grooming books for more exact details, but they are expensive and unless you're planning on learning grooming for a lot of dogs it may not be worth it.  Most grooming salons own these books, so you could always go to one and ask to take a peek.  Also, should you decide to groom at home I'd contact some reputable breeders/handlers of show BGs.  They do this daily, so they'll be able to demonstrate (pretty efficiently).  Good luck!|`|5ee828923160e00596a5dfc7521b736aaa	Actually you aren't suppose to cut them.

AA12058653	I have sugar gliders and cats and am the same way - I am comfortable with the diet I have them all on and do not believe in over vaccinating. It's REALLY hard to find a vet that will see exotics like sugar gliders and chinchillas in my area so I've had to really dig and am still searching. Mainly, see if you can get in to see the vet and have a one on one with out an actual exam of your pets. Get a feel for him/her and see how your comfort level is - if they are not willing to listen to your restrictions and knowledge on the vaccines and diet, thank them and walk away.     I made the mistake of seeing a vet I wasn't fully comfortable with for my Sugar Gliders. She said she was comfortable seeing me and taking my money, but refused to run basic urinalysis tests and perscribed me antibiotics on my hunch with no medical backup.    Dont make that mistake! :) Good luck!|`|001b7e63728d2fada33bbb337ced2c4baa	I'm not in your part of the country, but I do use a lot of 'natural' medicine in my practice, as well as am very experienced in exotic pet medicine and surgery.    However, I must say this:   If you choose not to vaccinate your dogs, start saving up your money in a special account NOW....because it will be only a matter of time before your dogs are exposed to and come down with distemper or parvo, which are very expensive to treat, and often fatal.    Unless they live in a plastic bubble, they WILL eventually be exposed....possibly even by you, just by walking through a store or in a yard and picking up the viruses on your shoes and bringing them home to your dogs.   I see it all the time.    Edited to add:   There is not a single place in the country where rabies is 'dead.'   Just because you don't hear of cases, doesn't mean they aren't out there.  It is a state LAW for the protection of humans that dogs be vaccinated for rabies, since dogs are more likely to come into direct contact with wildlife before humans will...then the dogs come in contact with us humans.  If you choose to violate your state law, be prepared to pay a hefty fine.    As far as parvo vaccines, we keep them in the refrigerator until just before giving them to our patients.  We have received years of in-depth education and training as to how the immune system works, and how to best protect it.   Mail-order and feed-store vaccinations are the ones you have to worry about....they have about a 50% failure rate due to improper handling somewhere along the way before they reach their destination.    Arguments can be made both ways as to how often vaccination boosters need to be given for any disease.  The only way to know for sure is to do a yearly antibody titer on each dog to see if it has a protective level for that particular virus or if it has sunk to the point of needing a boost.   That's really what you should do...and any veterinarian will be happy to draw the blood and send those tests out for you.  I just did 3 last week.   It's more expensive than just giving the boosters, however, which is why most owners request that we just do that instead.  But we still see dogs all the time whose owners get the vaccines only every 2-3 years, and they come down with parvo.   (Distemper vaccinations can do that, too, but less frequently....they seem to last a little bit longer.)    As an example:   Just had a 4-year-old dog in a couple of weeks ago that tested strongly positive for parvo and had a depressed WBC, along with other very typical symptoms.   She had her normal puppy series and a booster a year later, but then the owner stopped.   She wished she hadn't.  Sure would have saved her a lot of money....and saved her dog a lot of needless pain.   (She recovered with aggressive IV treatment for 3 days in the hospital, and is now doing well.)|`|27d2fe79dd9df7b907483b0eb75c1a39aa	Any vet or animal person that doesn't push shots is not the practitioner you want.  All puppies should have the full set of shots and a booster a year later. I did decide this year to have my yearly vaccines with my rabies every three years due to the excessive over vaccinating that is done.  We have seen auto immune develop in dogs that were over vaccinated.      However; my dogs are exposed to many of these diseases due to rescue and have built up their own immunities. I go by the rabies vaccination schedule that I have to abide by in my state.  If the three year booster is good enough for rabies it should hold true for the other diseases.

Shes also a certified companion dog...Hence: Main reason for having medical insurance on her!!!|`|d710255a26bcc9e84f530a951deb161faa	ummm well  A little expensive with the plans but they are helpful. Though they have set us up a few times telling us that my dog should take this 'special medicine' with her food to help with her coat and it ended up doing nothing.  But for the most part they're really good.|`|AA10112149	In my experience ..they are just as good as a Banfield outside of a Petsmart ..the only problem is their hours, unlike a normal Banfield they are not open as much and go by the store hours mostly.     I'd say their expensive treatments ..are worth it, as how they care for your pet is far better than how another pet hospital may treat the pet.   Always look for how comfortable your pet is with them and if they try to make it easy for you and your pet to visit :)|`|ee807690c6560454eaec5213484ed0d2aa	prob just as good as any vet....
aadab3ab3d1f341f25c123a97f251756aa	our nails are flat so is the clippers we use, the dogs are cyclindular, so are the dogs nails, you could split the dogs nails by using the wrong tools, go and get a guilitene nail cutter.|`|2821e642f26e1d2d0daab24df234f001aa	I use human nail clippers on the really young pups (it's easier to clip their tiny nails and see what you're doing) , but you can't use them on older dogs.  Dogs nails are too thick and strong for a human nail clipper to cut them safely.    I don't like the guillotine clippers though, I prefer the ones that are like a scissor with a curved cutting edge.|`|397ed91ed10462f242016495e3284824aa	because it's designed for the nails of a human.|`|3c4be736947a44516cc905f830ef40e3aa	BECAUSE YOU WOULD SPLIT THE NAIL  VERTICALLY EVEN LOWER THAN THE TOE AND GIVE HIM INFECTION....THEY ARE FASHIONED TO CUT FLAT NOT ROLLED TOENAILS....GO TO PET SHOP OR WALMART...THEYRE ONLY ABOUT 6.00|`|5e0deb3ee3b559af235dfa24bded3970aa	Obviously, human and dog nails are different. If you use human nail clippers on a dog you will cause the dogs nail to split to the quick. That will be very painful and then you have to take the dog to the vet. Only use clippers for a dog.|`|29daadcde1b4e8b68c892d67e4e272e1aa	I LOVE animals!  Many years ago I raised 2 brother dogs--small mixed breed. One looked like a (two tone) mini schnauser (Snoopy-whom I DEARLY loved)), one looked like an off white poodle mix (Fluffy-very sweet). I had them for about 13 years. I noticed their nails were growing quite long, so I tried toe nail clippers on Fluffy. He BLED!  It really scared me, but I LEARNED from it. Now if I use toe nail clippers (which I do), I'm VERY (Virgo) cautious not to cut too far up! Never want my dogs to bleed from that again!!  I also clip the very ends of my cats claws--CAREFULLY! (WHEN I have a willing participant.) This is "over the top", but when I had a reading from psychic Char (many years ago), she 'saw' a dog with a (back/gray) 2- tone colored coat around me! It was my precious little Snoopy! Still makes me cry!! I know God takes care of our precious pets on the "other side"!|`|63aaae0fd64178612c737f90c9233297aa	i'm guessing becuase they are not strong enough and dog claws are round.    don't know if this helps, but this is what i think|`|AA11612160	because their nails are to thick|`|d1c78f1e1ef2c81c9a590045d61a8661aa	A dog's nails are really thick and more than likely would not fit inside the human clippers. If you use dog nail clippers just be careful not to clip too far up, they have veins located approx. 1/4 to an inch from the tip of the nail. So the best way to clip them is to trim them  little bits at a time and file the rest down with a file.|`|AA11105335	You should NEVER use human's nail clippers on a dog.  It can  can put a lot of pressure on your dog's toenail before it actually cuts through the nail. If this happens your dog may feel an uncomfortable pinching sensation. This is because the vein in the toenail is being squeezed.|`|7c282de3a1b41cd3c66d8de3e81628cbaa	Because they have a vein that runs to their nail same with cats and if you cut to much of the nail you could clip that vein and then they would bleed really bad.  With the special clippers for pets then you don't have near the risk because they are designed to   cut only the tip off.  I have the small ones for my cats.  Never try   to use human clippers okay.  Good Luck.
AA11334957	No, they are still illegal, however there are many "underground" ferrets (it's estimated that there are over 150.000 ferrets) and their owners living in Cali and even "illegal" ferrets have to eat and get groomed.  Read what happened to this ferret owner in California:  http://www.contracostatimes.com/mld/ccti...  This site has lots of information about ferrets, laws and legalization on it. Worth checking out too:  http://www.cdfa.org/|`|06def5495029764a8f2ca5326fe6180faa	No, ferrets are not legal in California yet. The reason that Petco, Petsmart and other pet stores sell ferret items is because there are a lot of ferrets (illegally) in California. As it is not illegal to sell ferret items in the state, it would be foolish of them not to provide the service to the multitude of ferret owners in the state. It is also not illegal for vets to treat ferrets in California, so if you happen to have an illegal ferret, you can provide for their well-being quite easily.     Besides CDFA, there are a few other websites you can visit for information about ferrets in California. One is the Californians for Ferret Legalization site ( http://www.ferretnews.org ) that provides the latest information on the quest to get ferrets legalized in CA. The other is Ferrets Anonymous ( http://www.ferretsanonymous.com ) which is more of a support network for those that already have ferrets in the state.|`|ca156152c9b7c527c3eefa2193568ae9aa	I don't know if ferrets are legal yet in Ca though I do know there is a petition going around to allow them. That is a good question on why the sell them if they are not allowed. All I can say is maybe they are preparing themselves so when the time California does allow ferrets, they will be prepared. Some other pet owners sometimes uses ferret shampoo for kittens and cats.Some cats can't fit into a cat harness and so they use a ferret one. I am not sure on why they do sell them but you could call Petco and Petsmart and find out. Do they sell ferrets in Petco? If they do then they must be legal.|`|60afbcb97f22066c4a6dca5fa76280a8aa	Importation and possession of domestic ferrets have been restricted California since 1933, when the first State law restricting the importing of animals into the California was passed. The animals restricted under that law are included on a list that the Legislature originally called the "Wild Bird and Animal" list, which was later changed to the "Wild Animal" list. The law and regulations together list animals, or groups of animals, representing thousands of species, including those that are taken from the wild, as well as captive-bred animals and many kinds of domesticated animals. The Department of Fish and Game does not have the authority to remove an animal from the list of restricted species. The Fish and Game Commission has authority to authorize the Department to issue permits for possessing restricted species for specific purposes, such as public exhibition, research, and sheltering.    However, knowing there ARE ferrets in CA - the law was passed that the owners have the right to care for their illegal animals and the pet stores won the right to sell products.  I've also noticed some gerbil products popping up in stores over the last year.
AA10584876	Why do u have to get rid of the dog if he did it??? Anyway, just speaking from experience it was probably the cat because logic says that cats have more of a taste for birds. And what all of the other people said.....don't automatically not trust the cat because they say they like to pass the buck, I mean the cat never actually said anything. But here's a trick I hope that helps: Look them straight in the eyes and show them something of your bird's like the cage/toys/feathers, and say did you do this??? And sound really mad. If the dog cowers, crys, barks, whimpers, or reacts in anyway out of the ordinary, than you'll know, if u do this to the cat on the other hand you'll probably get nothing, so depend on your dog to be the indicator. Hope this helps......don't be too hard on the culprit, they're only doing what comes naturally.|`|e40cf7310b03d8a72732ef03d78425ceaa	you can never trust a cat but my daschund did develope a taste for parakeets.

AA12215194	The same way as you would train any other dog!!  Just keep in mind the reputation they have and make sure you do everything possible to reduce that reputation.    If you have a pup, read The Perfect Puppy by Gwen Bailey.     Socialising the Rottie to everything IS VITAL.  - - people, dogs, children, loud noise, strange noises, strange people, cars, lorries, trains, bicyles skateboards, rollerblades --- EVERYTHING! This way you will end up with a well balanced, friendly and confident adult dog.|`|AA12276208	You need to be calm and assertive. Be the pack leader and don't take any crap from the dog (though you should pick it up)|`|AA12208596	You don't. It just pretends to like you until it gets tired of seeing your face and then it mauls you and tears you a new one.|`|0c122e71e8bfa7f8a2b5fc00cf34f4b0aa	Are you really asking this question?? You shouldn't even be allowed to have a dog, especially a Rottie.  Ok, Dumbass, watch Cesar Milan, The Dog Whisperer. That is his favorite breed. He will explain to idiots like you that training doesn't start with the breed. It's dog first. Buy all his DVDs, books and tune into the National Geographic channel and watch every single episode. You train a freakin' Rottie the same freakin' way you train a Chihuahua.Their dogs. Get it??|`|668b7220457ed43be8587649f429607aaa	feed it well so it dont eat u|`|3845ec778cd9f56c64ca7e6f445d2f98aa	Carefully!    No not really...  They are fantastic IF properly socialized and trained.  You train them like any other dog, but they really do benifit from formal classes.  Look at your local AKC Obedience club.      The thing with Rotties is that they are typically VERY smart.  That makes them both easier to "train"  (learn new commands) and harder to "train" (be good).  I think this is because they are so quick to pick up on inconsitancies and expoit them.      You'll tell him to quiet when he barks at a jogger everytime, except two times in a row you don't when you're on the phone.  You just taught him he can bark when you are on the phone.    They have a bad rap because people exploit their strengths!  With a little (or a lot) of training they are amazing dogs!|`|81338c156bba51d9a5017577e6fb983baa	9 mm.|`|AA10990080	Go to the book store and get dog training for dummies it is full Prof way to train any dog.

AA10166914	That is a classic halmark of Lyme disease.  The animal needs a veterinarian.   I dont really know how it affects dogs but it is a holy terror on people.  Check yourself for ticks too...  anywhere your clothing is tight against your skin, behind your ears, belly button and lower...  if you find a tick on yourself take tweezers and pull it off, save it for a doctor and get to one.  LYme disease causes SERIOUS health problems for starters chronic fatigue syndrome that can absolutely RUIN your life!|`|0bc83a867d37f3eae6ba688ecf9f701caa	It depends on what the ring looks like.      A plain really round ring (that is slightly scabby or raised) is a sure sign of ringworm (a fungus, not actually a worm.)  For this you can use the cream you buy at any convenience store for Athlete's foot.  Apply this approx three times a day until the spot or spots disappear.    If the entire area, inside and outside of the circle, is inflamed (red and warm) and you know there was definitely a tick there, then it is an infection.  You can treat it with Durapen (injectable antibiotic available at farm supply stores).  Use dosage on bottle and repeat every 7 days.  Topical creams like Neosporin will also help.  (Infection can occur if you pick a tick off and leave the head embedded in the skin.    You should always take your dog to a vet.  These are two very treatable problems.|`|306a5da7a4bbe9184cd02f0c766e26b8aa	Sounds like Lymes!  It is very treatable if caught early.

These Terriers were developed by a fox hunting parson, Jack Russell, in England in the 1820s. The dogs purpose was to chase foxes out of the ground so the hunt could continue. They are also excellent at killing rats and other vermin. I can attest to Jack Russell Terriers being excellent ratters.   My little girl, Molly, has kept our place free of mice, bugs and snakes since we brought her home at eight weeks old and she killed her first mouse.   http://www.small-dog-info.com/jack-russe...    tunnel training terriers  a Jack Russell may be ready to dive down a go-to-ground tunnel at 9 months of age or younger.To release a Border, Jack Russell, Norfolk or other terrier down a go-to-ground tunnel is to unleash more than a dog: it is to unlock the genetic code within and explore the dog's true reason for being.   http://www.terrierman.com/tunneltips.htm    Wildlife Services has been working on Guam since the mid-1990s to manage damage caused by the brown tree snake and to prevent its spread to Hawaii and other Pacific Islands. In cooperation with the Department of the Interior and the Department of Defense, Wildlife Services works 24 hours a day, seven days a week to trap snakes around all military and commercial air and seaports on Guam and to inspect outbound cargo to keep the brown tree snake from inadvertently hitchhiking to Hawaii or other Pacific islands. All of these inspections are conducted with the assistance of Jack Russell terriers and Brittany spaniels that are specially trained to sniff out any snakes hidden away in cargo or on ships and aircraft. Our canine program currently has 10 dogs in the field. On average, Wildlife Services removes about 4,500 snakes per year from Guams ports through trapping, hand capture and canine inspections.        http://216.109.125.130/search/cache?p=ja...

2a7f749f86cc37597ffd4fb3a0fe361baa	OK...   If its a boy, its his penis.  He is excited or needs to use the bathroom.  Use this as a key to know what is going on with the way he is acting.  If he is walking around circling and he is frantic let him out.  If he is just rolling over and being playful he is excited and has alot of energy to burn.  Take him out and throw a frisbee or ball around....  If its a female and she is around 6-12 months old it is her first period/heat cycle.  This will last for apx a month, she will bleed heavy for about a week or two depending on her body.  There is no right time for an animals first heat because everyone is different just like humans.  If you dont want to spay her get her a doggie diaper and keep her inside away fromn other male dogs.  A dog should NEVER be bred on their first heat cycle its like getting a 13 year old pregnant, its not safe.  It happens.  But its something you should avoid.  If you dont want to deal witht he problems of having a female in season then spay her at a local vet with a good reputation....|`|AA12039743	that is ur puppy's private.|`|d51583757010983b30697a5c4e7b57dbaa	if its a boy, its his penis|`|AA10219457	You're puppies lipstick is coming out...lmao  That's his dong.|`|548acf9a110e33867b881416ccb0256daa	If it's a male, the pink thing is his organ coming out of it's sheath.|`|5bb345b45ec5eda4844abc19f7ae0d26aa	Blood?  That's her period.  I take it you haven't gotten her fixed.  That's what happens when you get a female dog :P.  That means you have to clean up after her every month.|`|4bdbf4e7de2cb9318867d83bd2e4c57caa	Dogs do that when they are excited.Whoever sayed a period thats retarted.|`|41ff9b47e5eec46d3c42536e83e3afd6aa	If your puppy is a male the pink thing coming out of that general area would be his penis.  Male puppies tend to do that when they are overly excited.    If your puppy is a female, and over 6 months old, it is probably her coming into heat.  Female dogs bleed similiar to female when they have their period.  If your puppy does not fit this criteria, you may want to have it checked by a vet.

Also they are a very high maientance pet no matter what an uncaring rabbit owner will tell you. They need to socialize constantly while they are young or they will grow up to be wild. Please please do not get one to just let it live outside or in the garage. They need to be inside with the family and are not for a neat freak. Also they do not smell bad but their urine smell is awful and mine has chewed just about every cord imaginable. Do a lot of research before you decide and check with an animal shelter first.

I have three rabbits and they are the best pets I have ever had. I had a fourth rabbit but he died today I only had him for a week he was a year old and was given to me by a neighbor who neglected to tell me he was sick.

They are not the best pet to have if you want to hold it all the time. Will you take care of it day after day for the rest of it's life? You will have to have a cage, water bottle and a feeding bowl for it. If you have responsibly taken care of a pet before then they may be willing to let you have a bunny. Just ask them to buy you a bunny and see if they will get it for you. You could name it "Blackie". There are other options such as a small dog, gerbil, mice, or other small pets.    Next question you have to ask yourself is....Will this rabbit get along with your dog? Are you going to want to have "both" animals in the house?|`|8bfa081d33b2b9860fc07884312233e0aa	well............this is how i got my bunny......i started crying and i told my mom all the positive things about bunnies!      i have a black bunny named thumper......name it..............i like Chester or master or Harley last but not least spankey          be my friend?   :)   email me at bunnybebe396@yahoo.com|`|b5188aed0af943d5c21572495b56710aaa	You have a dog, a rabbit is nothing like a dog, they are very intelligent and very social, they need hours upon hours of attention EVERY DAY!!! You cannot just ignore it. Also it needs a run. If you plan on just having a cage dont get one, you will be adding to the cruelty of the animal. They need a large space to run around ALL the TIME!!    Also you cannot cuddle them, a rabbit is not a cuddly animal, they are prey animals and picking them up makes them think they are in the clutches of a hawk and off to the dinner plate. But they love attention, for hours and hours my rabbit will happily accept nose rubs and grooming. He may even get on with your dog and play.    Our first rabbit came from a little girl who no longer wanted her as she was no longer a cute looking bunny, but she was a cute rabbit. She would spend hours in the garden running and hiding  but as with our other one did not like being picked up.    A rabbit is more work than a dog, if it has a runny poo you need to clean it or it will get fly strike (something you never in your life should have to witness but can happen). You need to clean their tray on a regular basis, feed a correct ammount and more importantly spend time with it. It will not be happy just being on its own.|`|AA11226206	Why a black bunny? Anyway take your dad to meet someone from the House Rabbit Society to pick out a rabbit. Mot rabbits aren't mean. This way your dad can see that it's a good bun.

AA10163496	Why do you want to keep her off your bed?  If it's a hair thing, why not just lay down a blanket over your bed that is "hers"?  Definitely don't lock her up.  That would be really cruel.  Provide her with a bed or a perch in a sunny window...I guarantee she will prefer that to your bed.  But you should be honored that she wants to sleep where you sleep.  She can smell your scent and finds it comforting.  My cats have free roam of the house.  The only place I don't like them is on my counter tops.  But my bed is their bed.  As a cat would say, "What's yours is mine and what's mine is mine!"|`|02d511db649335d2adefb43b06d507d3aa	If you're not using the bed then I wouldn't worry about it. It's not like she is hopping on to the kitchen table or counter. My cat sleeps with me every night. Even when I was in the same situation as you, my cat still slept with me. It's too a point now where she won't sleep on the bed unless there is a blanket there.     Try playing with her in the evening before you go to bed. If your cat likes things that are soft try getting her a soft blanket or cat bed. Try putting the bed near yours and that should help. If you are still having problems even with the blanket or the pet bed then you might need to keep your door closed at night.|`|AA11299986	close the door to your room.  is there a reason you don't want your kitty sleeping on your bed?|`|461930e206725e96eac73c7f11ad0eaaaa	Kitty probably sees you as the Mom Cat, and your nest is HER nest.

Cats have a personality of their own, and they bond with their owners who they look to for food , clean litter box, and companionship.Give her a flea bath and collar. Walmart has some flea collars for $1.00. They work as well as the more costly ones.My Siamese cat Sarah, goes anywhere she wants in the house. If I walk to the mailbox or a neighbors she follows me and waits for me.Because my health is not good sometimes, Sarah follows me all over the house. If I cry she is right next to me to give me comfort. Good Luck and look at your cat as a friend....|`|e797c1a80be965bcc95018d570ae4d60aa	If you're waiting to take the cat to the vet for a flea dip, then go to walmart or a pet store to purchase some shampoo that kills fleas.  I also suggest buying Frontline.  It works wonders and gets rid of fleas.  You just put it in the hairline at the back of your cat's neck.  For extra backup, you might want to buy some flea spray for your carpet as well, because if you think there's fleas on your cat, they're most likely in your carpet as well.    If you don't feel like buying the shampoo and other stuff, there's a spray that you can get at PetSmart that keeps cats away from certain areas.  So, just spray that on your bed and see how it works.
AA11082932	Why don't you lay down with him/her and pat the kitty, cuddle and rub you cat. then get a book and start reading it in bed. I am sure kitty will then come over and lay on your book so you cant read anymore. Buy some string, thick kind and dangle the string in front of kitty, kitty will not be able to resist and will attack it, make sure to put  up the string when you are done playing with kitty as they have a tendency of eating it. cat treats will get their attention anytime. Have fun and let kitty decide on how and when it wants to play if you are to aggressive in your play kitty may decide to find another place for a nap like under your bed.|`|d0611ec1a820402c86137b3ada987fdbaa	it almost having a lazy friend...  play with it|`|e5d537b994128155cca5d85bcefa98edaa	take advantage of having a lazy cat. every cat I've ever owned has been frisky and hyper. they zip through the house, chase my company's ankles and scare dogs out of the yard. right now I have 2 male cats a little over a year old and they think you're playing when you pet them or walk past them and they steal bacon off the table during breakfast if you're not careful.     lazy cats make good house cats. dress it up and take it on walks with you.|`|5f477cf9f429c86fcdfa05dc5d148aa0aa	play with it!  get it moving loose some weight, how can people alow their cats to get fat!  geesh!|`|AA11656632	Get kitty toys with cat nip.

It is not nearly as expensive as Iams or Eukanuba.  Now, I know lots of people would say that "my vet recommended Iams, so it's the best."  In reality, Iams will give potential vets scholarships, and other goodies in return for the doctor to recommend and carry his brand in their clinic.  The vet also gets a deeeep discount.  I am not saying it's not a good brand, it's just vets usually have a hidden agenda when recommending it.  Purina has done all my dogs well, and they are all healthy and happy.  However, I would not purchase a brand like Ol' Roy or a generic off brand.  They usually are lacking essential nutrients, and are extremely cheaply made.

1e2cb40ab2131b78fff9ca6e07f40eabaa	That's a male doxie for you!!!  Mine, even though he's neutered, still steals my clothing (right out of the basket).  It's more of a scent thing than a nesting thing, especially if you are the main caregiver.  He will steal my husband's dirty clothes too, but not nearly as much as mine.  It is embarrassing when he steals my underwear though (his favorite!).  Think of it as a positive thing, he trusts and loves you enough to want to be with your scent all the time.  Remember also that doxies are burrowers.  They love to burrow under covers on your bed (does he sleep with you?) or afghans on the couch.  That's the way they are!  (And they don't always care what you think!!)  Dachshunds are a very different breed of dog-if this is your first one, "Dachshunds for Dummies" is a very valuable resource book and well worth the cost.  Good luck with the housebreaking (I have 3 doxies) and learn to enjoy their idiosyncrasies.  Yes, this is normal!

HE LOVED TO GET MY SOCKS.  COULDN'T WAIT FOR ME TO TAKE THEM OFF.  CUTE ISN'T IT.  THE DIXIE CUP WAS REALLY CUTE TO SEE HIM CARRY IN MOUTH TO HIS BED OR NEST.

HE ALSO MISSES YOU WHEN YOU HAVE TO LEAVE SO HE LIKES YOUR SMELL VERY MUCH ITS A SECURITY FOR HIM YOUR HIS GIRL.|`|AA11847095	I have a 10 yr old dachshund who loves to burrow - under the covers in bed, in pillow cases, and yes in piles of clothes.  Dachshund's are natural hunters; historically their long snout and body made them perfect to hunt for badgers in deep holes.  As such, they are biologically inclined to seek a warm and dark enclosure in which to burrow and snuggle up.  It's totally normal and you should not be concerned at all.  However, if you don't want your new puppy stealing all your clothes you might consider getting him a bed of his own, a plush dog house type bed with a roof. My Lil One loves it and she's less inclined to steal my clothes since.  Good luck and congrats on the new pup!!|`|AA11853631	It is normal behavior. A lot of dogs are "pack rats".

Or, a mouse (Plural mice) is a mammal that belongs to one of numerous species of small rodents.    The best known mouse species is the common house mouse (Mus musculus). It is found in nearly all countries and, as the laboratory mouse, serves as an important model organism in biology; it is also a popular pet. (Non-biologists often use the term "mouse" synonymously with "Mus musculus"). The American white-footed mouse (Peromyscus leucopus) and the deer mouse (Peromyscus maniculatus) also sometimes live in houses. These species of mice live commensally with humans. Although they may live up to two years in the lab, the average mouse in the wild lives only 3 months, primarily due to heavy predation. Cats, wild dogs, birds-of-prey, and snakes prey heavily upon mice.    Mice can be harmful pests, damaging and eating crops and spreading diseases through their parasites and feces. The original motivation for the domestication of cats is thought to have been for their predation of mice and their relatives, the rats. A mouse trap can also be used to catch mice.    The mouse has bichromatic vision, lacking a photopigment that can detect red light.  There are 38 species in the genus Mus.

ONLY Borax!    Sprinkle it liberally in your house, on the carpet, on the tile floors, into the crevices of a wood floor.  Use a broom to mash it into the carpet fibers, tuck it into the corners of the floor and walls, into the cracks of boards of the floor.  Put it on your upholstered furniture, working it well into every crevice.  Treat every bed in the house with it.  Take the sheets and blankets off - launder them.  Rub the borax into the mattresses, between the box spring and mattress, under the beds.  Put freshly laundered sheets on the beds - leaving the Borax under the sheets and between the mattress/box spring.    Leave it there for 24 hours.    After 24 hours, use a fresh vacuum bag and vacuum the whole house.  Get all the borax powder up from all the crevices and rugs.  Be thorough.      After you have done that, empty the contents of the vacuum - bag or cup - OUTSIDE into a plastic trash bag and tie it off.  Put it in an outside trash container and do not bring it in the house for ANY reason.    Do NOT treat your dog with Borax.  It is much too harsh a soap for a dog's sensitive skin.      If you can't find Borax, you can do the same thing with "Sevin Dust."  Get Sevin Dust in a hardware or garden store.  I don't usually suggest Sevin Dust over the Borax because it can be harmful to people with respiratory problems.  You can, however, put some in a sock and occasionally "dust" the threshhold of your doors - outside - with it to keep all manner of bugs entering there.|`|86e5af1e3ecd8e843ceaec78bb2640ffaa	find a product that has a growth regulator in it. this stops hatching eggs from developing, stopping the cycle. treat the cat, the house, and the yard. if you don't do all 3 you may not get rid of your fleas. take your cats to be bathed and do your house and yard while they're away. ultrasonic pest contols may help afterwards. once rid of them always use precaution measures to keep them away. vacuum regularly; throwing the bags away when done, and using a flea comb on your cats.|`|4a0bec59b8474ca3c877a9122b585002aa	i put mule borax detergent aid on my carpets and furniture.  something in it kills the fleas.  just sprinkle it around and leave sit for about 20 min the vacuum|`|9f9483e7656a5ee5463d950c24054a25aa	I would first of all forget Advantage and switch to Frontline definitely better and does not contain "pesticides" will stay on animal even through water.

So it is certainly not a 'sure thing'. Few things in this world are.    On average, neutering does eliminate spraying in rabbits though...but keep in mind it takes over a month for a males' free range hormone levels to decrease and so that means it may take a few months before you actually notice chances in his behavior.

He's not lifting his leg on things inside your home is he?  If so, catch him in the act and tell him NO! very firm. then clean  area up with vinegar. let air dry. spray area with boundry no! from  hartz. keep area sprayed. repeat as needed. keep a close eye on him.

1cba4f183139e1db4df74eeb8e5da827aa	...  Carpets are filthy things and really impossible to keep truly clean.    Once a dog pees on the carpet, it takes a lot of effort to clean away the smell.  Dogs have very good noses and can often still smell their pee after cleaning.  I use a lot of chemical cleaner and smell remover and then vacuum them up with a wet/dry shop-vac.  Somethings I have to go back again and again until I have truly gotten it all.  My dog has a good nose and if he smells where he peed before, he will pee there again.  I may rip up the carpet and install a nice, easy to clean, wood floor.    You might think about paper training your dog, since he is a small dog.  Wipe up some of his pee with a sheet of newspaper and put it under a pile of newspapers.  He will smell his pee and pee of the newspapers.  Better than peeing on the rug IMHO.    Keep taking your dog for long walks.  It is good for both of you and if done correctly, you can establish a proper leader/follower relationship with your dog.  That means you lead and the dog follows.  Keep the dog's collar up high on its neck so you have good control.  Always keep the dog slightly back.  Once in a while take a doggy break, so it can smell, peep, and poop.    Teach your dog simple tricks like sit, no, come, fetch, etc.  I make my dog sit before we go on walks.  He loves his walk and will become extra obedient.  he sits before can have his leash put on and before going out.  I will go first, because I am his leader and then call him to join me.  Use these tricks to reestablish your leader/follower relationship.  It works and we are both happy about it.    Remember leaders don't beg.  If you dog forgets to be subservant to you, a sharp command or sharp snap of the leash will remind him who is boss.  Make it quick and very short in duration.  Don't beg or nag.  Your dog will think less of you if you beg or nag.    So, if you see your dog starts to pee, a quick sharp 'no' command may stop him or may make him think that what he is doing at this place is bad.  Then take him to where he is supposed to pee and have him do his business.      My dog will pee on command.  I say 'potty-potty' and he thinks it is time to pee or poop.  In training I say 'potty-potty' while he is peeing, so he associates my command with the act.    Good luck.  ......|`|86e5af1e3ecd8e843ceaec78bb2640ffaa	what size is your crate? Many people make the mistake of buying too large of a crate. the crate only needs to be large enough for him to stand up,turn around, and to ly down in. If you've alreday  purchased a big crate then get a board that will fit inside crate standing up, drill holes on the sides and top to attach cable ties to crate and board. this way you can adjust the board for more space as he grows. next make sure he goes ouside potty before he goes in crate and when hes taken out of crate to the same spot every time. praise for good behavior, ignore bad. do not leave food or water in crate only toys, or bones. right after hes eaten or drank water take him out. your basically starting all over.  but once he understands this he'll remember it forever. be patient.  be consistant.|`|4b96522cdada9bee2a93669cc4023651aa	4 1/2 months is too young to hold it for more than 2-3 hours MAX.    Just make sure his crate is large enough so he can have a dry end and end with newspapers.    Don't come back in with him so fast - stay out 15 minutes longer.  When you come in, keep him on a leash and if he starts to assume the position, yell NO - grab him up and head back outside yeliing NO BAD all the way there. Praise himif he then pees outside.    Also, have your vet check him..  He may have a low grade bladder infection. Also, male puppies have hormonal surges as they grow that can result in episodes of frequent urination.|`|AA11844456	First I would Suggest you read "Don't Shoot The Dog" By Karen Pryor and "Culture Clash" By Jean Donaldson.     The process for House Training is to Accustom the Dog to gradually increasing periods of Confinment With frequent trips out to a proper spot for "doing his duty." then you can reinforce the act of going out side. tell the dog what you expect from him and try to forget about the things he does wrong.     Also consult your veterinarian for a check up and recomendation of a dog trainer.|`|cf8ad412e0f6a4c17b0c35c1a97ced18aa	Try pee pads you can get them at Wal-Mart.  My mom uses them with pom.|`|03c821d2c24022486739931549ca6b2baa	First off, how long is he left alone in a day? Puppies have much smaller bladders than grown dogs. leaving them alone for longer than two to three hours isn't advisable, for the sake of your carpets.   To train him it's a little lengthy. Could take a few months. Are you ready? ^^ I'll try to summerize it bellow  1) Go to the petstore and buy some "puppy training mats" These are good to have because they are disposable and well to be frank puppies seems to get used to them faster than just news paper. But both do work. Take these papers/mats and put them where the pup has been going to the bathroom in the house most of the time. At this point you just want to focus on the pup going on those mats. Make sure that you put some by the door that the pup'll go out to use the yard for his business. (Very Important!)   2) Make sure that the dog is going on the mats. How do you do this? Every time the pup uses the mat get happy! Treat him! Play with him! Be excited! Make sure that the pup knows that you approve of this behaviour. If he doesn't go on the mat, (because he's small this'll be easier for you) pick him up and put him on the closest mat. Say a quick "too bad" when he's going on the carpet, and praise him with "good boys" and pets when he's on the mat, even if he's not going anymore, make sure that the little guy knows that being on that mat is the best place in the world! He'll eventually start going on it all by him self.  3)When he starts to go on the mats/papers consistantly, start taking them away. One or two every week, depending on how well he's doing. Don't remove the one near the door. That should be the last one in the house. At that point start moving it outside. The pup'll learn that he's to go to that door when he has to go to the bathroom. (Thoughout this whole thing keep treating and praising him. You don't want him to regress.) And hopefully soon after the pup'll know to go out side to the bathroom. when he does this for the first time, praise and treat like you've never treated and praised before! When he starts to go outside, stop treating in the house. If he goes on the mat by the door praise him with a calm good boy and leave it at that. When he goes outside, praise as you did before. The pup will learn.  Good luck, hope this helps, and sorry for the length.  Contact me if you have problems I'll try my best to help.  ~manda
f15bfe456ac1ad42cfa6860d4bba022baa	First and foremost, you need to give your old baby the love and attention she has always gotten.  Ignoring here for the puppy will only make her (more) jealous and make her feel like she's being replaced before she's even gone.  Also, you can't let the puppy nip and bother her in an unpleasant way.  A 14 year old dog can become uncomfortable easy enough as it is, without a puppy latched on to her back leg.  Even though it might seem she dispises the puppy, she'll probably eventually warm up to it.  We had an old beagle when we got a new puppy.  She wouldn't even look at the new puppy, and would even turn her muzzle up away from us.  Eventually, we'd catch her looking at the puppy admirably, but when realized she had been seen, would act mad again.  Before too long, they were best of friends, and the older was even protective of the puppy.  So all in all, make it clear she's not getting replaced, don't let the puppy be mean, and give it time.|`|a2fefbbce6a2b99995c4ab382a914492aa	I had this problem also.  My older dog actually went through a grieving process.  She was just jealous of the young one getting her love and attention.  First thing I did notice.  The older dog has to establish rank in the home environment..  She will defend her dog food dish and her bed.  If young dog gets too yippy, she will reprimand her.  My dog did this gently.  Hope yours does too.  They may get into a few fights, but eventually one will give in.  Dogs are pack animals and always establish rank.   So my answer is just see how much they can accomplish on their own.  Speak harshly to dogs if they fight.  Be ready to step in if  the harsh tone of your voice doesn't stop them fighting.  Otherwise a good stopper is a firecracker.  They then will associate something they don't like(firecracker) with fighting and this will discourage fighting.   Probably best not to bodily step between fighting dogs.   Three years later, my younger dog usurped the authority of the older one.  I had really good results with this.  Both my dogs are healthy, happy and very much loved.   We think the success came from letting things happen naturally.  We noticed this is also how Steve Irwin introduced his animals.  The only problem I have with Fetch11 way, is in a shelter dogs are constantly coming and going.  How can one establish rank when there is no stability in bed, food dish, and home for that matter.   Sounds like a good plan for a shelter though and obviously one that  works for a shelter.   Good Luck.|`|7836d3ca7b1d67fb9e7bf9b98c5106cdaa	put them on leashes and let them see each other but dont let them get too close. they will get used to each other after a while.|`|b3a9cb04f7081dd4a39e0319c3aa3acfaa	When we introduce new dogs into our shelter we bring the new dog in to the kennel room in the evening when the other dogs are settled down in their crates for the night.  They spend all night getting used to the new dog's presence and scent and wake up in the morning eager to meet the newcomer.    Since dogs may fight if they feel their place in the pack is being compromised, we also make sure that the "resident" dogs, the ones who have been with the us the longest, keep their place in the "pack" by making sure that they get fed their meals and treats before the newcomer; they get petted and groomed first; they get their good morning wake-up call first...  When the resident dogs don't have to worry about losing their place in the pack, they're more apt to accept the new dog...  And the new dog learns immediately that the resident dogs are "above him" in the kennel room heirarchy.    In your situation, we'd keep the dogs on leashes and keep them well-supervised until you're comfortable with how they interact with one another.      Make sure your older dog gets fed first, treats first, and attention first -- even if it means pushing the little guy out of the way for a moment.      The dogs will take their cues from you as to what is or is not "acceptable" behavior between them.  Example: If the little dog yip-yips at the big dog, and the big dog growls in return, you need to give the big dog a firm but calm "no growling" command -- so there is no confusion on the dog's part what you'll allow and what you won't.  If you're a strong "alpha" in the house the dogs will respect your input.|`|AA11510015	Don't throw them together for a few weeks. Get an old shirt that you've worn several times (without washing) and rub that shirt all over the new dog. Keep them separated while you are not there. And I would highly recommend getting muzzles for use when they ARE together outside or in the same room. This doesn't have to be a long term thing but just for a few weeks while your 14 yr old gets the idea that the min pin isn't going anywhere. I have multiple dogs and let me tell you from personal experience that muzzles are a wonderful thing in helping to avoid LARGE vet bills and ripped up dogs!!! I would use for BOTH of them for several weeks.|`|86e5af1e3ecd8e843ceaec78bb2640ffaa	treat them equally. be the leader of the pack and don't accept any  bad behavior from either of them.
4b96522cdada9bee2a93669cc4023651aa	Let me guess - obedience class was Petsmart??? or Petco??? or one of those other kitchy kitchy koo 'please do it and lets be postive about this even if you are trying to kill the dog next to you' operations ??? Let me guess "please sit, sit- I'll give you a cookie"?  Headhalters and weird martingales and other funky pieces of equipment???    Frankly, if that is what they did, you should get your money back!    You need help. Huskies are dominant dogs and fond of getting their own way.  They are NOT for the inexperienced owner.  (And Golden Retrievers or dogs like that don't count.)  You have to be very determined, very unyelding and very insistent.  Also need to be able to deepen your voice and roar NO and grab her and pin her flat on the ground when she ignores you or does what she wants.   You have to be, must be, the ALPHA and enforce rules on her behavior in all situations.    She is being the Alpha - the leader - and you can take a hike as far as whether you do or do not want her to act like that.     Alphas take the food from lower ranked dogs in the pack.  Alphas nip and grab the lower ranked pack members when they don't immediately do as the Alpha wishes.  Alphas knock over the lower ranked members of the pack to establish their dominance.    Alphas round up the lower ranked members of the pack and won't let them near other unknown canines to socialize. Alphas chase off unknown canines and keep them away from their pack.    We are talking the ultimate ME, MINE, MINE, MINE, ME FIRST personality.(and right now you are a lower ranked member of the pack and don't have any say in the matter.)    (By the way,I'm sure some poster is going to drool over that TV person - Milan - who throws dogs on their backs and claims to be able to train them in an afternoon.  Uh huh...everyone has their delusions.  Try that with a Husky and they will fight back no holds barred - they are not that far descended from wolves and having the belly exposed to an "attacker" means they are going to die. There are other and far better ways to get control - but on the other hand, having to spend more than an afternoon isn't  good TV.)    All of the "positive only" nonsense does not get it. Would you always obey speed limits if there was no chance of getting a ticket.  I can postively guarantee one thing about "postive only" training and that is that the dog will absolutely positively ignore you and do what it wants if that is more fun or interesting or just because it wants to, than doing what you want and getting a treat.    You have to make her behavior cost her. You have to communicate in ways she will understand.  That is the roaring at her in a deep voice; pouncing on her and grabbing her by the scruff and hauling her back; the shoving her flat on her belly, leaning over her with the upper body, frowning  and putting your finger right at her nose lecturing her;  the swat on the nose, and if necessary, grabbing her ear between your finger nails and pinching (EXACTLY what the Alpha dog would do to her if they disapproved of her behavior.)     Unless you want problems with her finally really nipping and hurting someone or another dog, you have NO CHOICE.    Now when she is being good with visitors or other dogs,she gets smiles and happy voice and praise.    As for the jumping up on visitors, get a collar and leash on her before they arrive - and I don't mean those silly headthingies.   Forget a flat collar, you won't stop her.  Get a properly fitted slip collar/choke collar and if that isn't enough, a pinch collar.  She leaps, you haul her backwards and take her off her feet, down whe goes flat on her belly with yu getting up in her space and getting after her.    By the way, in AKC obedience competitons only two collars are allowed: flat buckle or a choke collar. All the rest of that stuff is illegal in the ring.     IF she is that dog aggresive and territorial (about you) , get a pinch  collar  on her - and USE IT    I've dealt with Huskies like that - I won which is rather amazing considering I only weigh 98 lbs but not so amazing when you understand that I was more psychologically dominant than the dog.    If you were within 60 miles, I would say come on over with her, nd I will show you how to fix and how to persuade her that the behavior stops NOW.    Short of writing 30 pages of text, the best I can do is send you to find someone who IS qualified to show you how to get her under control..    Now you both need a GOOD obedience class - and that is NOT Petsmart or Petco.

This dog knows you are the alpha and won't mess with you, but YOU HAVE NOT TRAINED THIS DOG. She needs limits and needs to be trained that her behavior is not appropriate, that comes from YOU.    Until she is under control, do NOT take this dog to the park or let it around children. If she bites another child, the parent CAN request that your dog be put down.    Huskies are often very aggressive dogs. CONTINUE OBEDIENCE TRAINING. Hire a specialist if you have to BECAUSE YOU have not been trained properly in how to deal with her.|`|86e5af1e3ecd8e843ceaec78bb2640ffaa	siberian huskies are very intelligant dogs and require alot of  exercise. they were bred to pull sleds, and if shes not getting enough exercise shes creating a job of her own.  when guests come over, put a leash on her and make her sit and stay as guests enter your home.  if she tries to jump up on them make a leash correction, also have your guests ignore her.  as for the cookie, i suggest you keep her away from small children when they have food.  she sees children as lower than her in the pack and will continue until you obtain pack leader and incorporate it to your children as well. the dog park shes guarding you, stop this now. make her stay and pet the other dog then release her from the stay once shes passed that exercise, if she fails set her up and try again until she passes. this way she'll get the message that your the pack leader not her. enroll her in another obedience class, a tired dog is a good obedient dog. the more training she gets the better control you will have over her.|`|a5e3f3f35e3c4487f2f784a995440c88aa	Your girl is a brat, plain and simple.  Not easy for you to hear, but going strictly by the words you have written, you have not given her the discipline she needs to be a good pet.    By discipline, I don't mean hitting her.  I do mean by getting her under control and not allowing her antics.    When visitors come over, leash her!  Tie the leash to your waist if necessary and keep her under physical control.  If you don't get her under control, you will soon have no visitors.    Your dog's biting a child's lip is way, way out of line.  Going for a cookie or not, she made contact with her teeth and a human's skin.  Completely unacceptable behavior.    YOU have to teach her better.    Start working on alpha behavior with her.  Learn about NILIF (nothing in life is free).  Enter into another obedience course, with a different instructor as apparently the last one didn't teach you a whole lot.    Another good place to go is to Sibe Rescue.  Call/email some of the people who work with unwanted Sibes.  Ask them how best you can go about rehabilitating your dog.    YOU are the only one who can help, though!|`|25fa00d0994275aa10c69b8b873ee392aa	I don't know if this is true, but I have heard that Huskies are one of the "one owner breeds"  I have heard the same about Chows.

AA11709234	Trimming is the easiest.  You can use nail polish remover, but it really takes too long and doesn't always do the trick.  We have the same problem and usually trim it out.    Tried Baby Oil.  Might take out FRESH sap, but not the old hard sap.  If it does, we gave up WAY too early because after half an hour of trying, it was making NO dent.  Left the dog greasy though.  Greasy AND sappy......no good.    You do not let them EAT the nail polish remover...DUH!!!!!!!!!!    You use it on the spots.  There is not much residue at all.  IT comes off with the sap. You just use a cotton ball damp with it.  JEEZ.........sometimes people have to use common sense!    And salad oil is the SAME as using the baby oil.  Does not work on the old crusty sap.  Maybe fresh, but then you would have to see it when it got on them...hard sometimes!!!!!!!!  Leaves the dog greasy too!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!...    Peanut Butter is the same thing...TRIED THAT TOO!!!  People need to understand that the sap is not really sticky after it hardens.  then it is just a hard mass of sap.  The only way to get it out is to dissolve it or trim it.|`|0f7fdd9c92f47050adab8ac6cec4ff7daa	baby oil will take out sap, and then you can use a light shampoo to get the baby oil out.

I breed dogs and run into this problem sometimes and recently started a job at a dog grooming facitlity where I encounter it A LOT.    At the groomers we use what is called a Coat Degreaser; you work it into the old pine tar where it gets stickish again and then gunk it into the stuff and then shampoo it out; it takes a lot of patience though. I did ask the owner other alternatives for myself to use and she suggested taking Baby Shampoo and working it onto the spot and then GENTLY pulling on the sap with a washcloth and continuing to rub the shampoo in; then pour the conditioner onto the mat also.    You may want to try the salad oil; I think the peanut butter makes a mess; but as you said depending on the amount of pine sap you may still have to trim it out.    Also if you happen to have any lye soap works great!|`|AA11105335	Please don't use nail polish remover.  It can  burn your pet's skin and cause toxicities.    The following article was composed from posts written by Ellen Morris.    To remove sap, tar, paint, chewing gum or other sticky things from your dog's coat, there is nothing that beats salad oil! Using a a small dish or a cotton ball, thoroughly soak the area with the oil. Work the oil into the sticky or hard place with your fingers. Blot off the excess oil with a paper towel, and wash the area with dog shampoo. Repeat this procedure if there is anything left in the fur.  Don't let your dog walk around the house until you shampoo the area, otherwise you will be cleaning up oily smears and foot prints from everywhere you don't want them.    Peanut butter can work just as well as salad oil (but don't use those low fat versions!).    You should never try cleaning your dog's fur with acetone, paint remover or paint thinner. It is highly toxic and can do permanent liver or kidney damage. Salad oil and peanut butter works very effectively and if (or should I say when) our adorable Labradors lick the area, they will be ingesting something that is good for them, instead of being toxic.

001b7e63728d2fada33bbb337ced2c4baa	The heat cycle does not end when the bleeding stops.  That's her most fertile time.      The entire cycle takes a good 3 weeks....so if she's 2 days away from the end, that means she started swelling and bleeding 19 days ago.       I'm betting you mean that you're expecting her to bleed for only another 2 days, though?   They typically bleed for 9-12 days, then are still "in heat" for another 9-12 days after the bleeding stops.  They can actually get pregnant at any point during that cycle, but the most common time is when the discharge changes from bloody to straw-colored.    Regardless, if she stood for a male to mount and breed her, then it's highly likely she's at her fertile time and got pregnant if they tied.  The best thing for you to do is to call your DVM first thing in the morning and schedule a spay if you don't want her to be pregnant.   They'll tell you the best time to have it done.  Most of us prefer to wait 10-12 days after the mating to let her go out of heat so that the tissues return somewhat to normal before doing the surgery.  There's MUCH less bleeding that way than doing it within the next few days.  But it's personal preference of the surgeon....you need to call your DVM and ask.|`|AA10928222	chance are she is going to have a litter see unlike humans animals don't just do it for fun or because it just feels good they do it for one purpose only and that's to reproduce|`|AA11767019	If she permitted a male to mate her, she's likely going to be pregnant.

AA10713060	Cat breeders often do this with their cats to produce the different unusual breeds, but I wouldn't recommend it.  They will eventually have genetic difficulties that can led to shorter life spans, and poor health.

Most likely, one case of inbreeding will not result in defects.  The problem becomes when cats are continually inbred and it actually thins out that genetic make-up, leaving more room for problems down the line.  A good example is a show-cat that my mother took in after her owner had died.  The cat's family had a long history as prize-winning show cats and were therefore bred and bred and bred from one family member to another.  The result was that the cat (a himalayan) had such a scrunched face, that her nose and eyes were constantly running and infected.  In the cat show world, an extremely smooshed face on a himalayan means more points, but for the cat, it brings nothing but problems.  Just being around the cat for some time, you can also tell she had mental problems.

I guess it all depends on how genetics are divided up.|`|a3e4db7bc0aa18e66a39e44371d7a206aa	Not a good plan, unless you want babies that are more suited to a freak show.  Keep them apart.|`|53e5bfac3c51bd4f8ccacc4a37c392a7aa	we had a cat that was inbred--several times over  the thing was nuts.. every cat that came from where we got ours had problems. sweet and affectionate one minute, then scratch at you the next minute.   We ended up having to give ours to the pound--they put them all down, because there was something very wrong with them.  avoid getting an inbred if you can...|`|e469549d2fa3cf543775af66910082f5aa	Yes.  Cats in that way are just like humans.  If they inbreed, they babies will be deformed.  I know because I had a cat, and she got pregnant by her own son.  She had 2 kittens, one was born dead, and the other died 2 days later with only 3 legs.  It's important that if you don't want your cats getting pregnant, to get them fixed.  After your infant kittens grow up, they don't consider themselves family anymore.  Cats will have sex with anybody or anything when they're in heat.  They have sex with their children, brother, sisters, hell, females will stick their butt up at you if you'll put something in her.  Trust me, I know.|`|ff5b27657c48be068369d89b4cf1bd61aa	It's something that you really should avoid.  I have two cats that are the result of inbreeding.  I don't know it at the time I took them in, but it wouldn't have changed anything I would still have made them my babies.    One of them is huge, I can honestly say that I've never seen a cat with longer legs in all of my life this same cat can't meow...she opens her mouth but nothing comes out.  Her sister got the brunt of the problems...she is very small, never lost her kitten fur or kitten teeth, she's cross eyed and sometimes her eyes move from side to side VERY rapidly.  When she was a baby one day she simply stopped eating and bathing herself...if was almost as if she had forgotten how, I had to force feed her special, VERY EXPENSIVE liquid food with an eye dropper.  I had to use warm wash cloths to bath her because she wouldn't do it herself.  After about 2 months of that she turned the corner and started to eat and bath herself again.    She also does very odd things, things you'd think a cat would have no idea how to do...My Husband calls her "Rain Man"  Her sister can't meow, but she never shuts up...LOL...well she actually doesn't meow, it's more like a chirp!    Neither of them can be spayed because they both have breathing problems and the Vet said the risk of spaying them outweights the benifits by such a high precentage that he wouldn't even attempt it.  BUT, they are two of the most affectionate cats I've ever seen..so sweet and loving....just wanted you to know that there are upsides to my two girls and we love them to bits.  They are 6 years old, the Vet said the bigger one will probably have a normal life span, but my little angel probably won't.    So after all of that, if you're willing to put some time, effort and money into a cat that is a product of inbreeding don't let it stop you from adopting one...but don't let it happen in the first place..make sure that all cats are spayed or neutered ( unless as in the case of my girls it's not possible for health reasons )
