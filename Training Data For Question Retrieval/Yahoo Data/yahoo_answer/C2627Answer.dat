If you have not driven it far or hard with the lifter noise, the combination I have suggested should quiet the lifter. Just take it easy on the car for the first while and let the lucas oil do it's thing. If that does not do the trick, then change the lifters. All of them. It is not that large a job. By yourself it would take an afternoon. A garage should do it in a couple of hours.   Then use the synthetic oil and a bottle of Lucas at every change after and it will not happen again.|`|5P3cHR4Taa	Change oil, sell.
IA7Gy9TAaa	In the price range you're looking for you should stay away from dealers and stick with private sellers.  Lots, if not most, dealers have bogus fees, like document prep and delivery fees, that may add up to close to a thousand alone.  Cash also ISN'T king at a dealer.  They'd much prefer you finance a vehicle so they can make money not just on the sale of the truck, but also on the financing.  Even if you're planning on paying cash, tell the dealer you're thinking about financing, you've got a credit score in the mid 700's and you're interested in hearing their options while you're negotiating the price.  They'll often give a lower price on a vehicle because they think they'll make it back on the financing.  Dealers usually bump the % up from what you'd actually qualify for and then sell the loan to their bank of choice.  So, once you've got the price where you want it, tell them you'd actually prefer to pay cash.  It's a dirty trick, but, if anyone deserves it, it's a car dealer, right?    Back to where I started, between $3,000 - $8,000 you ought to be looking on autotrader.  Bring Hundred dollar bills with you when you go to look at the truck.  Cash IS king with private sellers.  The only real advice is to take any truck you're thinking about buying to a mechanic to get checked out, could be the best $75 you've ever spent, and don't be afraid to make a ridiculously low offer and don't be afraid to walk away.  Tell them you've got cash with you and you'd really like the truck.  A nice way to make a low ball offer on a vehicle without offending is to say, "it's such a great vehicle but it's just a little out of my price range.  Would you be able to do me a huge favor and take x?"  Call back in a couple of days and ask if they'll accept your offer, if no, decide if you'd like to bump it up or keep looking.  There are tons of vehicles out there, even if you've found the perfect truck, there were thousands of it's "twin" built that year.  Don't worry, you'll find another.|`|55a7c9ee13be4af0516d03c798a92a60aa	money always talks   you go in dealership with hand ful of money they wil be all over you i got my bike like that dealer about freak out he was asking about loan papers i said im paying cash today he jump up started getting thing done  look like he was going in shock or something was funny guess he never seen 10,000 buck before til i lay it on the table|`|AdIrjmV7aa	Check KelleyBlueBook.com for the value of the truck you are interested in. Negotiate your best price.  The Dealer makes money on the financing. Do not mention paying cash until you negoatiate a deal that's satisfactory to you. The dealer's are paying an inventory tax for every car on their lot.  You are really in charge of the sale if it is reasonable.  If one Dealer won't move, go to another but tell the original Dealer that you were interested but their price was not good enough. And forget the line "it sounds good, I'll check with my Manager".  The salesperson is not checking with anyone except the vending machine for his/her snack.
JkoZzjwaaa	hope this helps        Suzuki SX4 vs. Subaru Impreza Review   How the Suzuki SX4 stacks up against the Subaru Impreza - by Nigel Cooper, Topanga CA         2009 Suzuki SX4  Price Range: $13,299 - $18,539    2009 Subaru Impreza  Price Range: $17,495 - $27,495       Suzuki SX4 vs. Subaru Impreza Review  Cost  The destination charge is a standard charge for transporting the vehicle from its point of origin to the dealer. It costs roughly the same to get the Suzuki SX4 to the dealership as the Subaru Impreza. The Suzuki SX4 is tremendously less expensive than the Subaru when it comes to MSRP.     Utility  The Subaru's more massive trunk will accommodate more sizeable items than the SX4. The Suzuki SX4 and the Subaru Impreza can accommodate the same number of passengers.     Comfort  Taller drivers will substantially enjoy the extra head room in the Suzuki SX4's front cabin compared to the Subaru Impreza. The SX4 offers more head- and leg-room to your passengers than the Subaru Impreza does.     Dimensions  The Impreza is a tad heavier than the Suzuki. Your wallet will hurt more every time you fill up the Impreza than the Suzuki SX4 because of its more capacious tank. The SX4 and the Impreza compete for the same parking spaces.     Performance  In terms of horsepower, the Subaru packs quite a punch and will knock the Suzuki down a few rungs. On the other hand, remember that high horsepower engines often command higher insurance premiums. The Suzuki SX4 is likely to feel slightly slow because of its high horsepower-to-weight ratio compared to the Impreza.     Handling  The Subaru Impreza and the Suzuki SX4 have about comparable tires.     Drivetrain  The Subaru has a more sizeable engine than the Suzuki SX4. Keep in mind that smaller engines typically get better gas mileage, but a smaller engine usually has to work a little harder. The Suzuki SX4 could learn a lesson or two from the Impreza regarding torque. The Subaru packs quite a wallop compared to the Suzuki SX4 with respect to torque, which is roughly equivalent to acceleration.     Overview  The Subaru Impreza and the Suzuki SX4 have the same basic warranty.|`|WUA5xdI0aa	Depends how small.    A Fiat Sedici or Daihatsu Terrios are about the same as size as a Fiesta or Renault Clio and are between 10000-12000.    An Impreza or Golf 4motion are around 15000+ and they are good family cars.    Subaru Outback/Legacy  are good large family cars.    The Audi A6 ALL-ROAD is a good luxuary 4 wheel drive car.    Of course there are Land Rovers, Jeeps and Lexus RX types.|`|IA7Gy9TAaa	Suzuki's are great motorcycles and really terrible cars.  They're incredibly unreliable.    Subaru's are extremely reliable and also hold their value very well.    The money you'd save on the suzuki would be a huge mistake and end up costing you a lot more than the subaru in repairs and loss of value.  Don't believe me?  Look up how much a new sx4 is and then look up the value of a 3 year old sx4 on kbb.com.  Now try the same thing on a subaru.|`|atbAakXuaa	Subaru Impreza in my opinion is the better car.|`|379b18fddd29f1b64385008f275bdd61aa	I won't write a novel as a response. I will just say you can't go wrong with a Subaru. Suzuki is cheaper to buy, but will cost more in the long run.
XeaC5UZhaa	Does it click at all when you try and start it? The problem could be with your starter, you can get one from an autobody shop for about 140 bucks and they will pay abou $60 for your old one.
lWu0fnllaa	Mary Anderson is said to have invented the windscreen wiper swinging arm in the United States.    Trico manufactured first windshield wiper, Rain Rubber.    it looks like Mary Anderson invented them, and Trico became the first major manufacturer of them!|`|zLlBQwuFaa	I believe it was Mary. She got the first patent in 1903.    FYI: Robert W. Kearns (10 March 1927  9 February 2005) was the inventor of the intermittent windshield wiper systems used on most vehicles from 1969 to the present.    Similar to Robert's invention, Mary likely invented it and the company took all the credit and profits.
d29M7lGKaa	If all they did was pour in some injector cleaner, that was out of line,, there was probably a diagnostic procedure fee, which should have been OK"d by you first !!! Make a note of this, the best injector cleaner known is BG 44K  by BG automotive products...|`|DV4xyeChaa	1 are you SURE all they did was pour it in tank???? at most shops they pump the cleanse through the injectors and fuel rails....ill bet thats what they did...dont be afraid to ask them 'hay bud,,,whats the procedure for cleaning those injector things" smile and flutter eyelashes...|`|NUXLamcWaa	This is a frequent complaint among consumers who don't understand service work.  There are often incidental charges that occur that have nothing to do with the actual service.  Although it may be that it only took the mechanic 15 minutes to make a repair for example, he will still need to charge for the time it took him to diagnose, identify and order the parts that are needed.    I work as a crane service technician which is similar so I have some familiarity.  So when I know of these incidental costs up front I always inform my customers so they aren't confused when they get a bill for 4 hours, and they know I was only there for 1 hour.      Your issue though is probably do to the dealer not carrying the injector cleaner on hand and had to either pay someone to have it delivered or send someone out to get it.|`|sP98NDi5aa	I work in a shop where a fuel cleaning system is offered, and we introduce a cleaning agent through the fuel rails and directly into the injectors, and as a second stage to it, there is a bottle that is added to the tank. It is there so that there is a prolonged cleaning taking place on top of the direct one that was serviced. Ours takes about 30-40 minutes, start to finish, depending on how many cylinders the engine has. 4 cylinders take longer, less fuel consumption, more time.|`|z0j0MPxbaa	witherinlily, I've always purchased an auto warranty for every vehicle I've owned in the last 6 years.

Complain. Ask them exactly how long it took to pour the bottle into the tank - it should have been about 10 seconds. Based on their hourly rate that should have been about a dollar.
AA10720479	Sounds like someone  torqued the lugs too tight with an air gun. If the tire iron stays on the lugs well, stand on it, and then jump a little. This little trick has worked for me several times. Maybe even try putting a little heat on the lugs before you try.    If the tire iron doesn't stay on that well, just find a pipe or some thing to extend the lenght of the iron.|`|d29M7lGKaa	Slide a cheater pipe onto your lug wrench, the added 2 or 3 feet of gained mechanical advantage will break any stubborn lug nut loose !!!|`|BO67795Caa	The same situation happened to me.

Or the lugs were cross threaded, put on at a slight angle, when they were put on last, which destroys the threading making it difficult to remove them. Either way you may need air tools to finish.|`|T1kRNoxCaa	righty tighty, lefty loosy|`|ed1e958a74b3aff1204376a3d8dca2a2aa	do you have a 4 way lug wrench? that's the best kind to use.if you don't have one get one find the one side that fit's your lug nuts put it on and start pulling counter clock wise if that don't work stand on one side of the wrench and pull as hard as you can if that don't get it call a garage to come and do it.|`|2cbe1bba8389a009e6f7e731cb983e90aa	Counter clockwise is the right direction and if you are stuck there is only one way I've done it that may help but be careful , I put the tire iron on lug then back the car up slowly , the tire iron hits the ground and hopefull loosens the lug, but do not back up far on the last lug, you only need to slightly loosen each one and dont let anyone stand near lug wrench en case it slips off, I'd really only do this If I had no other option|`|JYE48cY7aa	always leave the car on the ground to break the lugnuts  loose. If you can safely put the wrench on the lugnut with the handle facing left try to gently stand on the wrench to break the lugnut while the car is still on the ground. After you break the lugnuts then jack the car up to completely remove but only break the lugnuts on the ground dont try to remove them allthe way while the cars weight is on the tire. Calling AAA may be your best best if you dont fill confident!    Hurry and put the other three back on! if you have thre completely off and the fourth isnt even broken loose its probably binding and may break!

Pushing it upward will set it at the speed you are currently going and will hold it at that speed. Once set; you decrease the speed by pushing down on the stalk and increase speed by pushing it up.   I could be wrong about how it functions but I'm pretty sure it's your CC.  Keep in mind that it will not activate at low speeds.|`|94d1acf25e2af629b7eb957530024002aa	No harm ask the dealer?|`|55a7c9ee13be4af0516d03c798a92a60aa	move it and see what happens most likely tilt steering

Otherwise, it would be almost impossible for people to drive cars "in the other countries".

dQrBlk4qaa	The money looks almost like a wash when you pencil it up like you did, but the point is not to make financial sense with the conversion, its to instill much-needed horsepower! I installed a rebuilt performance LT1 for a blown stocker LT1 in my '95, and the last thing I was doing was running the numbers on whether it made "fiscal sense!"     The other route you can evaluate is to source a wrecked late model camaro/firebird, and take what you need from it. As long as its a reasonably low mileage candidate (less than 100k) and you do most of the work yourself, you can perform the entire upgrade for around 3-4k, depending on the extra bits you need.|`|2ee9ba3f8fa52a8c3bd583c6f12f11b8aa	As it is, your post doesn't make sense.  You make it appear you're comparing the cost of a CAR to the cost of an ENGINE.  The piece that's missing the value of selling a V6 car.  If the V6 blows up, then it could certainly be cheaper to do an engine swap.  If it's in good shape, then it might be a lot cheaper to trade cars.    Here, I can find LT1 cars all day long for $4500.    Ultimately, the internet is a bad place to get answers.  If you are able to investigate this and come up with an answer, then that just tells you that you shouldn't have asked the question here in the first place.|`|WwXrTQgaaa	That price sounds about right for everything but labor. I think what they mean is the total price of the conversion AND the market value of your car would be more.    If your car is worth $5000 then that's $10,300 for the swap, including car. So if you could get a V8 for $10,000 that would be a MUCH better way to go.    If you traded in your car or sold it for $5000 then used the other $5300 towards the V8, you would come out with a sound car, all work done, like it's supposed to be, for the same price.

If you have an offense against you in your first two years of driving especially when you have a learners or provisionals permit, then you can have points against you, but it does depend on the nature of the incident.

85e0a1e338cd29e0c7340bdce2fd51d5aa	Nathan,In cold weather stock or richer mixtures could be required.Check the color of the spark plug.If black it could be from lack of engine heat or plugged air breather. High altitude will have a factor as well as smog in having the correct jetting.Generally you would go leaner jetting in these conditions.It would be a good idea to keep a log of the jet changes you make the temperature and time of year.Motorcycles are jetted for the area they are sold in from the factory.Unless the plug is fouling out ,stock jetting is best because whenthe weather warms up you do not want your engine to over heat and ruin before you realize you needed to undue the jet change while it was cold if you did go leaner jetting.

099632998ddfe36083c67e9a7581a0a1aa	ditch two of the subs, always stick with the same sizes, they tend to cancel eachother out if you mix and match sizes.  you end up with a better overall sound with just one size.|`|zotCYH89aa	running different size subs in one system would never cause them to "cancel each other out" in any way, however it DOES create somewhat of a nightmare in getting each to perform at their best, even in the best case scenario of each having their own amp channels and crossover adjustments.   (I placed first in points IASCA 601+SQ in the southern calif region and qualified for the world finals in 1998 running a pair of 10" soundstream exacts and a Precision Power Pro flat piston 12", which raised a lot of eyebrows until the SQ round came along. At a Circuit City contest with over a hundred cars one SQ judge said I had the best bass he scored all day- but that was as much  the dynamat, clay and undercoating I spent 6 weeks filling the car with as the speakers)  you didn't say what kind of subs you had or how much power you have, that might be something to come back with- the kind of subs,if their enclosure suits the manufacturers specs, and how much power you have, and what you use as a crossover/eq/ signal processor to control them from song to song. That's critical as each recording has widely varying levels of bass. You need to be able adjust both level and crossover point on EACH pair from song to song to be happy if you like bass. You can try with an EQ alone but it usually isn't as effective.   See below, this is my system right now, it's pretty humble (pair of 15's, 6 1/2 components in kickpods) but built like a brick ****house though the most efficient use of dollars in the whole thing is that parametric eq in the dash. DEI used to make that but about a dozen other mfrs make them now for under a hundred bucks. I pipe my Zune right into it and don't even use that megabuck Clarion competition level head unit anymore. Has its own volume and Xover control, gives you control of the bass boost Q point, sub level, and 4 bands of EQ with KNOBS so 5 seconds into each track I'm dialed in- all without taking my eyes off the road. .   I used to waste 5 minutes doing all that with an RF Symmetry EPX back when I was competing. Simple is better.     http://s353.photobucket.com/albums/r384/...|`|NzIoJlNUaa	I'd say your problem with it not sounding to good is,your running two different sizes of subs and they are probably canceling each other out.    You should pick one set out of the two and run those,and then see how it sounds.|`|uoB0zduSaa	How big is your truck? Thats alot for a truck to have in there.|`|T8AtmgETaa	well build a better box for ur speaker that will ake a big diff. in sound and loudness|`|P03oHt6zaa	make sure the 10" is in a sealed area of tha box on its own. and the box makes a difference. sealed in a hatch back worked great for me, while ported didn't. a friend who had the same setup had sealed in a trunk, didn't sound as nice, but then it got ported, sounds WAY better
9a823d334bc2d11b63149434455399abaa	I had the same thing happen to my 87 F150.  It turned out to be a corroded wire in the main harness, took me a day and a half to find it.  It was the main power feed to the ignition switch (10 gage yellow I think).  Not the key, but the switch down on the steering column.  Get a complete wiring diagram for the truck (hit a Ford dealer, they will usually print one for you for free), and start tracing wires.  GOOD LUCK!|`|zOIgzIy4aa	there should be a square box on the inner fender, check those plug-in to see if they are clean and tight. if the box is bad then you won,t have nothing. that box should be bolted under the hood, on the drivers side on the inner fender.|`|e98c33dcc80602e7a73d2046b4999af3aa	Might be a bad fusable link near the solenoid on the right fender well.|`|Ty32khkaaa	Sounds like a fuse or a short.|`|lmSoNMhPaa	i would say  that its in your wiring harness since you have power to some places  but not all of them

The examiner does not want you to do anything special, if you have been taught properly and your instructor has taken you round the dodgy parts of all the test routes you should be okay, if there is any doubt in your mind about taking the test then put it back until you are fully confident, you will only fail if you commit a serious or dangerous error, your instructor should tell you all this. I am a driving instructor
tU8wLhIUaa	It first depends on the back end of the crankshaft. Some models of cars have different diameter recesses in the crankshaft to accept the pilot bushing and converting that could be close to impossible. Then you have to change the bell housing and add a clutch, plus mount and add the clutch linkage and shifting mechanism. You probably will have to have the drive shaft modified to fit the new configuration. Change the chip in the computer to reflect the change and perhaps modify the programming.    The short answer is it possible, yes. Is it practical, no. Even changing the transmission with a different transmission that bolts right up might mean one would have to modify the programming in the computer.|`|bqGgD5uwaa	No, No, and No bell housing differant, crank differant, need to install a clutch and on and on.|`|zOIgzIy4aa	i don,t think that would be a very good idea. i would just keep it automatic. it will be a lot cheaper too.|`|S9QyF6NQaa	it depends on the make year and model, in most cases its not practical|`|oWAUn0leaa	It probably wouldn't be a good idea to swap out an automatic for a standard. If you;re used to driving with an automatic in a car it might be hard for your brain to get used to driving the car with a standard.|`|JKQhSGEEaa	unless you can get all the parts cheap and you are a great mechanic. it takes alot of money and time to replace you auto with a manual
C0yagFFoaa	your power steering is broken, maybe if you are lucky the level of power steering fluid is too low, this can easily be rectified, by getting more and filling it to right level. all instructions will be in your owners manaul.    if it isnt the power sterring fluid, it could be the power steering pump. you need to get mechanic to look at this.    if oyu dont have power steeering, the i would say the connection between your steering wheel and the steering rack is broken  good luck|`|tF1XMilYaa	First I would imagine that a 2008 luxury car has power steering as a standard option.  There are a few possible problems to check before running off to the mechanic to get ripped off.  First, check the fluid level.   There might be a reservoir away from or attached to the steering pump.  The next thing is to check the belts.  You will either have one big belt or several smaller ones.  If you have the big one, serpantine belt, and it broke, you will have more problems than just power steering.  Alternator would not charge the battery, AC would not blow cold air, etc.  If you have the smaller belts it should be a fairly simple fix if you are mechanically inclined.   If the belts are broken or the pump is low on fluid, you should still be able to turn the wheel, but it will be really hard especially when sitting still.  If you cannot turn the wheels at all, it could be a lock in the steering column that is broken, or a dysfunctional steering box, and these should be covered under warranty.  Good luck!|`|zOIgzIy4aa	it could be the belt broke, the pump is gone or the rack.|`|S9QyF6NQaa	your power steering pump is out of fluid due to it malfunctioning, a blown line, or a bad component of the rack and pinion, if fluid is not the problem then im not too sure what it could be without seeing it
9upJthqCaa	You probably need a a/c recharge. This means the refrigerant in your air conditioning system has leaked out & needs to be refilled. $150 is about right for an a/c recharge. No cheap way around this...Oh yes there is one...roll down the windows.  Keep in mind that even after you have the a/c recharged it might leak out again as you most likely have a leak in the system be it a slow one. Refrigerant does not just wear out, it leaks out.  So have them check for leaks & if you can afford it repair those leaks otherwise you may end up having to spent another $150 in the near future.|`|TWe7mNzaaa	the liquid the guy was talking about was probably freon. cars sometimes need to have the freon recharged or replaced. you would be paying for the labor and possibly the new freon. there are freon recharge kits you can do yourself which would be cheaper but you have to make sure you use the right refrigerant. check your owners manuel|`|Ty32khkaaa	Try charging the freon. You can do it yourself for about $50. Get a Chilton or Haynes anual and it should tell you how to do it.|`|w4kdTalPaa	Sound like you need refrigerant for sure. If pep boy is going to do a full system check including a leak check then 150 dont sound bad.|`|5FPAobonaa	No way around paying for it. It could be the compressor, condensor or the receiver dryer. In any event fixing a/c isnt cheap.|`|g9shOAVaaa	I hope the pep boys guy was more specific. try a can of freon. can get at walmart for 5-6 bucks. if you do it yourself, you will need  the adapter for you car, also at walmart. if that doesnt work, there could be a leak in the system or who knows, the possibilities are endless unless you have the system checked out fully.

GHNz2fQGaa	Your amp puts out 600 watts RMS at 1 OHM. Your subs run at 4 OHMs and have an RMS of 200 watts, according to the manufacturer's website. To hook them all up, you need to connect all the positive terminals an the subs together in series, and all the negative terminals together in series. By connecting them in series, it drops the OHM level to 1 OHM, not 4 OHMs like the guy above me seems to think. It will power the subs at 150 watts RMS. If you wanted the full 200 watts per sub, simply remove one of the subs in the series, because your amp is able to handle 2 OHMs at the same rating.|`|BsMkp3nPaa	that amp will struggle with pushing those 4 10 in subs it's only rated for 400w at 4 ohms 1 channel. you subs are 4 ohm each so you'd have to wire all the positives together and all the negatives together then attach those to the amp, (pos to red and neg to black). you can try it but i think you end up clipping (overloading) your amp. you may want to try only two on the amp. it may actually give you a better sound. hope this helps.|`|NzIoJlNUaa	Your sub link is to an alpine amp.  Do you have a link to the sub.|`|T8AtmgETaa	is ur amp a mono or 2 channel? if its a mono then i dont think u can run 4 subs to one channel amp. but its a 2 ch. then u might be able to. just up one subs to another subs and same with the other 2 so u have 4 subs but 2 of them are wired into the other ones making it where u can hook it up to a 2 ch. amp
WiTBXCYvaa	No, chances are, it's just battery corrosion. Stop by Walmart, advanced auto parts, autozone, O'Riley's or someplace like that and pickup a battery terminal brush and a can of terminal protector. Some people will tell you that coke works good too. It's ok, but only for a temporary fix. (Coke eats the battery acid buildup.)    Remove the terminal cables from the battery and scrub them good with the wire brush and scub the terminals too. Then take the terminal protector on both the wire connections and the terminals.    If this doesn't fix the problem, you may have corrosion buildup in the wires where they go into the connector ends. In that case, take the ends off and clean the corrosion out of there too. Spray with the terminal cleaner and put them back on. You should be good to go after that. While at autozone or advanced auto parts, they can test your battery ad starter to make sure they're working ok. I'm betting it's just the corrosion on the cables. Electronics don't need much juice to work, once you try and get enough to crank the car, the corrosion blocks power flow and the lights will dim down/go off and radio will turn off. I know your battery isn't bad if you can crank sometimes and sometimes you can't.|`|Ty32khkaaa	Toyota has a good reputation, but that was a lemon. They have a lot of problems.

Most battery shops will do this on the car at no cost.|`|AA11101968	Could just be time for a new battery, how old is the current one?|`|hh7gKHdWaa	You can replace the battery terminals or get a new battery.

5aJ7t4hJaa	Your question is very *incomplete* with *details*.  What is the meaning of the ending -- "but is starts?"    If your auto just *up and QUIT* running while you were driving along somewhere, you *SHOULD* have had some warning signs *somewhere* among the gages on your dashboard panel at the first signs of *TROUBLE*!  Or, do you never glance at your gages on the instrument panel of your vehicle while *tooling along*?    At the ending of your question, did you intend to say that *AFTER* your "car fell dead", you were able to get it started again and drive off again -- without any further trouble -- so far?|`|7ygicWvzaa	May want to have your alternator checked.  Mine did this and that was the problem.  Yours may be going.  Usually Auto Zone (if you have one in your city) will check this kind of stuff for FREE.|`|WiTBXCYvaa	Sounds like the alternator. Alternators convert the mechanical power to electrical power to recharge the battery and run the electronics.    Stop by autozone or advanced auto parts and let them test your alternator for free. Be aware though, on some cars, when the alternator goes out, it could take the battery with it so have that tested too.|`|Ty32khkaaa	Give more detail, and it will be easier to pinpoint the problem.

Other fees to expect are the DMV fees, tire tax and dealer doc fees. The dealer doc fee is probably the one and only fee you can negotiate. Any other fees are probably BS.

If the noise is more like a loud screech then you may have a bad starter and its grinding flywheel|`|omNEQ4Tkaa	sounds like starter has had it|`|6507eb67b40c198c7f9e69ac4296c97faa	It sounds like your battery may be dead. Your gauges go up but when you turn the engine over it doesn't have enough juice to even turn the starter motor, so it just clicks. This also takes all the power away from the gauges so they return to their position as if no power is going to them. Try a boost start and once the engine is running your gauges will function correctly. Good luck.

N4IGdJXwaa	Bad Wheel Bearings Usually make a grinding noise.  If you jack the car up, and you can shake (jiggle) the wheel back and fourth, that would also be a indicator of a bad wheel bearing. Sometimes you may only get one symptom.  If you have been driving on it for 1000 miles, you really should get it replaced. It could cause major damage if not replaced soon (w/in a few hundred miles)  I suggest http://mibearings.com for new wheel bearings. They have 100% USA made wheel bearings at very good prices. Order the part from them, and have the local repair shop replace it for you.  I hope that helps!|`|zOIgzIy4aa	you never know ! you might drive 2 miles and it will leave you sitting or you could drive 20 miles and nothing will happen. why take the chance, get it fixed.|`|Ty32khkaaa	Just change the bearing.

A rubbing noise could also be brake pads or the brake disc backing plate. If it is the wheel bearing, get it sorted sooner rather than later; at the very least, it will fail the MOT (asuming you're in a country that has MOTs); worst case scenario, the bearing could collapse while driving and leave you stranded somewhere needing a very expensive tow.|`|7qYeKghPaa	Get that replaced as soon as you can.

RbsRpcIyaa	Please understand and let these points soak in:    1) This is a very common scam run on many different ad services  2) There is no "eBay Protection Program".  3) eBay does not act as an escrow service ("eBay will hold the money until you give the OK"). Ever.  4) Once you wire the funds to the fake escrow account, the "seller" then empties out that account and runs.   5) If you are taken by this scam, you have less than a one percent chance of getting your funds back.    Move on, keep your money.|`|4Y2mxvnfaa	Good job on catching the scam before it happens to you.

That's a pretty risky business, and from what you're saying it doesn't sound legit to me.  AT ALL.    Before you buy any car, you need to see it and test drive it, at least that's what I feel that I need to do.

b8tgCAQJaa	Why? If you're left-handed, you still have the use of your right hand. Swiping an Oyster card (or inserting a paper ticket into the barrier) isn't something that requires fine motor control, like handwriting or playing sports, so either hand can be used.    I am left-handed myself and never gave this issue a second thought until you mentioned it. It's not just London Underground. All railway barriers throughout the UK, and indeed the world have the ticket slot and card readers on the right. If someone somewhere did create a left-handed barrier, it would cause chaos, and wouldn't even particularly benefit left-handers as we've already grown used to the card reader being on the right.    And having the reader on both sides would entail having two sets of electronic circuits (and mechanisms for paper tickets) for each barrier - the cost would be prohibitive.    Don't get me wrong, there are probably all sorts of areas where things could be improved for left handers. I just don't think this is a worthwhile one. One example: I hate using, say, a public PC at a library (or internet cafe), and the mouse is either one of those dreadful things that are curved to fit a RIGHT hand, or the wire isn't long enough to move the mouse to the left of the keyboard. Or those pens in banks that are attached to chains... at the right-hand side of the writing surface. Or cheque books (some banks do now provide left-handed cheque books). Or...|`|m3VXOcE7aa	for then only tho,|`|2d3ab98f216743c75f2f200fa734cb7caa	you are making sense ... because I  have discovered that the stations are for right handed peoples  .. however we all have to adapt and accept ..  if I ahd my way the tube would be based on a lower rate of fare and the shops would be cleaner and food stalls would be spotless and sanitized... can we have it all our way ..___|`|fOc6PB2Oaa	Someone watches The One Show!

143bm6cnaa	You may need to get your fuel injectors serviced, or it could have something to do with your exhaust system.      If you are not capable of doing your own mechanical maintenance, the next best thing is to go to your Toyota dealer, or other major, brand-name repair shop.  They probably can't tell you what it is, so have them run a full diagnostic test.  It will cost about $100, but it will print out a report that they will go over with you.  They will also give you estimates to resolve anything that needs to be repaired or replaced.  You should take that diagnostic report to 1 or 2 other repair shops and get estimates from them as well.      Remember, not everything on the report needs to be fixed immediately.|`|HUluAQM3aa	Does they car still "drive" the same?  Power reasonable as always?    If it feels much the same very little can occur to drop it that much without at least feeling less power (bad plug or faulty injector) while under way.    Is it winter at home now as that plays a huge role as well as pushing the wheels thru snow on the roads.    I cannot think of something obvious and I don't feel a trip to the mechanic is needed.  Pull the plugs and make sure they all have the same color.    Drive on but keep records going forward to monitor the situation.|`|bqGgD5uwaa	87000 miles, spark plugs been changed? fouled plugs can drop mileage like a stone.
iHIEp8Fzaa	Sounds like a relay. Turn your key to the on position. Put your head under the dash and follow the sound to where it's loudest. If there is a small metal or plastic box anywhere in that area put you hand on it and see if you can feel the relay making and breaking at the same time you hear it click. Most likely it will be close to or in the fuse panel which may have plastic cover. If you locate it, replace it! Hopefully that will take care of it.|`|AA10331789	Try pulling the turn signal fuse out and see if it still ticks.

bLjGM9yNaa	Good beds these days cost a heck of a lot of money. If you can't       borrow a truck with the proper sized bed, I would strongly suggest       you get a price from a local hauler, or rent a Ryder or U-haul truck       for $ 75.00.  You don't want a $ 200.00 ticket, or a bed splattered       on the road. It just isn't worth the grief. Most people that ask this       question here usually wind up getting it shipped.

XgpuXjwtaa	Why don't you ask your attorney?  Just because you are under 18 does not mean you have to wait until you turn 18 to receive your settlement.      However, I assume your parents are pursuing the claim on your behalf.  You also have an attorney.  In most states, all minor settlements have to be approved by a judge.  This ensures the minor that he/she received a fair and equitable settlement.   Sometimes the settlement is placed in escrow in a bank, and other times it is put in an annuity.  The annuity payouts vary and do not necessarily begin at the age of 18.      If the claim is simply not settled by the time you are eighteen, you and your attorney can settle the claim.  You will sign the release, and then the check will be sent to you.|`|xJgILr5faa	First thing they want to know if your ok after all the PT that you received  then they can put a price tag on this inconvenience  at that time talk to your lawyer about how more your think you should receive you my want a second opion from a nother doctor try no trying to hurry this along time is on your side you will get your money dont take the first offer|`|XsZsk55Jaa	If you receive a settlement offer and accept it before you turn 18 the money will probably be put into a trust account until you reach 18.  At that time you will probably need to ask the court to release the money to you although it might happen automatically.  It will depend on what the courts instructions are to the institution holding the money.

N4IGdJXwaa	Bad Wheel Bearings Usually make a grinding noise.  If you jack the car up, and you can shake (jiggle) the wheel back and fourth, that would also be a indicator of a bad wheel bearing. Sometimes you may only get one symptom.  If you need new wheel bearings, I suggest USA made bearings from MIBearings LLC.

It will not make noise long before the bearing fails completely. You will know when this happens as it will sound like fingernails on a chalkboard.  Here's how to check: jack up the tire off the ground. grasping the tire at the top with one hand and the bottom of the tire with the other, try to move the tire pushing at the top and pull at the bottom. If there is an obvious amount of wiggle, bearings are bad. This will also check your ball joints for wear.  The best course of action is to have this looked at and taken care of ASAP. If the bearing fails completely, it will ruin other more expensive parts, but if you catch it in time, only the bearing needs to be replaced, which costs much less than new spindles and hubs.

If so,you can't actually adjust camber or caster.You can adjust toe and generally it should be 1/8" toe-in.|`|AA10137828	I might. I have manuals going back to the 30's!     They are in my shop. I will check and get back to you later.    EDIT.....    Back from the shop, no luck on that info. I'm a bit short on the truck info from '46 to '60.    As the other guy said, about 1/8" toe in would be cool. Caster/camber can be adjusted on a straight axle by bending but that is probably not needed.
BGPa2DqYaa	All States,now, look after each other.If you got tickets and they are on your drivers license then when you go to another state and request that states D/L they will know about It and before you can get your license they will suggest you take care of your prior obligations. You can no longer hide by going to another state. Your record follows you around. Good Luck

yBc0HJifaa	Hello,   I did a quick search on gumshoe and found a 1997 Honda civic for 600. It was a manual, looked good, and is loaded with 118,000 on it. If that is miles it is good and if it is kilometers it is fantastic. The owner is selling because he has to leave.   It list that it is in good shape and was listed on             01-28-09.  I realized that there are taxes there that we don't have such as a congestion tax. The "taxes" being the MOT, road tax, and PCO, WOW!   Here is some advice:   1)- Talk to the owner and ask questions.  a)- Has it been been in an accident?  b)- Has it had any major repairs?  c)- How long has the owner had the vehicle?  d)- Has the clutch ever been replaced? This is important.  e)- Has it been serviced regularly?  When was the oil and filter, air filter, and fuel filter replaced. Also important.  f)- When, or if, the brakes were replaced.  g)- has the timing belt(if equipped) been replaced.  I guess vehicles have lower mileage in the UK than here as there is not as far to travel.   Check the fluids, oil, radiator, brake fluid level.   According to what I have seen you can buy a vehicle with 900. It also helps to bring someone that can look a vehicle over.   1)- Look at the brake pedal for extensive wear. If it is worn until part of the rubber is missing and metal is showing it can be an indication the mileage is incorrect.   2)- How is the condition of the drivers seat. Is the outside edges worn, torn, or sunk in.  3)- How does the carpet look especially around the gas pedal.  4)- Look under the hood on the inner fenders near the very front for damaged metal. Do the same in the trunk. This will tell you if there was extensive repairs beause of an accident.  5) How do the tires look? Are the far insides or outsides worn(possible alignment problem.)   You can talk to someone and learn a lot. This does not work all the time but helps if you get a good feeling from the person and do not feel that they are just being a sales person. You can get a feeling if they like the car.   Sometimes people have to do things like sale a car because they are moving and this can be a gain for you.   Finally, test drive the vehicle:  Crank it up and hit the fuel a little and make sure it does not smoke. Let it warm up to operating temperature and make sure the coolant fan kicks on.   Does it steer good and if you pick your hands up briefly does it have a good center steer or pull one way or the other? When you take off is there a studder or jerk? This can mean the clutch plate is worn. Does it shift good with no noises?   How does it drive and handle? Does the brakes work good? Does the vehicle feel good to you?     It is my opinion that you can get a vehicle for 900.  In the U.S. you can buy a car with $1200.00 but expect it to be worn out. The silver Honda I saw was in London so maybe you will look at it. I like Honda and Toyota vehicles.   Also, When I had my shop I would perform these checks including a compression test for a nominal fee. Maybe there is a mechanic that will do that there.    Print this and it will arm you with some information to help minimize paying a lot for a vehicle and getting a large flower pot.|`|GHefTsUyaa	Even with 900 you can get a good, older car if you know what you are doing.    I would look for a person selling a small economical car like a Nissan Micra.    Preferably an older women who has owned it for a long time.    A long or fresh MOT is good to have.    Get in touch with someone who knows about cars,there are bargains to be had and remember,it's a buyer's market right now.|`|ZEwAalKPaa	With 900 you really need to buy privately not from a garage or dealer (they are not going to give any warranty on a 900 quid car anyway).    Despite what newer car owners think it is fairly easy to get a decent and reliable car for the money you have.  Forget the age and look at the condition!  Somewhere amongst your friends you must have someone who is knowledgeable about cars, or who has a son or husband who is. Enlist their aid.  Do an ebay search for a Vauxhall Astra mk3/4 with the 1.7 Isuzu diesel engine (NOT the Vauxhall ones) option it it.  These engines are hugely reliable.  Or look for a Peugeot 306 diesel, again the engine will rack up huge miles.    Do not be in too much of a hurry, there are big numbers of older cars coming onto the market where people are dropping down from two cars to one.  Many of the best buys in your price range will be from 'mature' owners who have not flogged them to death like the youngsters who can only afford a small older car but try to drive it like a Porsche.|`|AA10409227	Unfortunately, for the money you've got to spend, you will not find too much tha is reliable or with low miles. If you could hold off a bit longer, and save more money, you'd be better off. I woudl look for a good condition used HOnda or TOyota with high miles, but well cared-for. Good Luck.|`|LNnP3oAgaa	I would personally look in a local paper or on a local advertising board or somewhere like that.  I wouldnt like the idea of looking on the interent for a car because as they say you dont know who you can trust nowadays,  Look local and buy local because if you do have a problem with the purchased car you dont have to go to far to sort it.  Im a 32 year old woman but I always get my husband to deal with getting the car repaired and mot'd because I always feel intimidated by the men and feel as though Im going to get tucked up somewhere just for being a woman becuase we supposedly dont know what they are talking about.|`|IA7Gy9TAaa	I've got bad news.  900 isn't enough for a car that you're planning on keeping.    Off the top of my head, I think that's about $1,300 American right now.  You'll be looking at junkers as pretty much anything that runs is worth about $1,000.  Could you afford payments of about $200 american? about 130lbs (sorry, I couldn't find the key command for the symbol)?  It'll be a lot cheaper in the long run if you get a car that's about $10,000 american and make payments for the next 3 years.    The only good advice I can give for a car in the price range you're looking for is, don't expect it to last more than about 6 months.|`|2s5WSVbPaa	900 is ample for a decent car, people are selling cars now because of the credit crunch so is a buyers market, my husband has just found me a super little renault clio for 500 from ebay, it has 12 mths MOT and 6 mths tax and I love it. Go for a small, low mileage car, with mot on it and plenty of history, alternatively look in classifieds ads on ebay, garages are desperate to move their part ex's on.|`|dzWoORHfaa	Try local second hand car dealers.

I would choose a new all-wheel-drive Porsche 911.  Not only does this car purr on the way to Las Vegas, it's a dream to use as an every day car around town without worrying about it breaking down often.  Back in the late 70's Porsche did some trick stuff to the Cat. converter that allows you to lug it in traffic without loading up, OR taking precious horsepower.  Porsche, the gold standard in this mans opinion. http://autos.aol.com/cars-Porsche-911-20...   PS - The Triptronic transmission is a must....as well, no Targa or Cabriolet (convertible) - and personally, I don't care for the color blue shown in the link.  Enjoy the dream  ; )  IN RESPONSE to your add on:  My sister has an 08 Bently, it's like a root beer color.  The interior is so soft and rich that she feels like she's riding in a vat of pure chocolate.  I must say, that car is something and I couldn't blame you if ya chose it over the 911.  And did I mention that it's  F A S T  ?

Any brakes that can make you skid are as good as your able to get for your car. My stock brakes can lock up my tires, so there isn't really a need to get anything better from a stopping perspective. (once you skid it's a function of your contact patch size and not your brakes) So i vote brembo just for their looks.|`|AT0e3xwAaa	Any brand with a lifetime warranty

For best results you should replace the pilot bushing/bearing, resurface/replace the flywheel, and shim the flywheel if necessary.
333a8b96e50ca7be29e4122a1437a3d4aa	If you don't pay the payments then yes it can,  but the way things are going they will probably work with you as much as possible as they don't want to be stuck with another vehicle that they can't get anything for.|`|kjAWsDwLaa	Sixpack66 has it right; you should call the bank/loan company and see if you can negotiate lower paymens or an extension.  Can't hurt to ask; the worst they can do is say "no", and you might be able to work something out.|`|urkNRr5Kaa	If you can't afford the payment then yes.  No matter if it is a recession or not, car companies definitely need to make money like any other business.  Some people will have jobs and some what, but if you want to keep your car, then you'll have to pay the payments.|`|GMQDzcSZaa	No No, the seller will write it off as a loss. NOT! yeah, they'll take it. Quick to. Only takes 2missed payments. Yep sucks, should probably start hiding the car. OR try to refinance it. Good Luck there.|`|5vFGO57Kaa	It depends on whether you took out insurance on the loan.<br>  <br>  If it wasn't insured for loss of employment, then yes, the car can be taken away if you fail to make payments.
x0TnuI6daa	I'd give it a 7-7.5  Its a capable, comfortable soft-roader that, for its price, packs plenty of equipment. The engines are not unique to the Tucson, and power many other Hyundai models (2.0L powers the previous model Elantra, ad the 2.7L powers the former model V6 Santa Fe and Sonatas) so there are plenty of spare available for it, and providing its maintained as per the manufacturer's log-books, they're quite reliable. (PS watch out for the timing belt service on the V6 model, it is quite pricey..)    Its solidly built, just as solid as many othe soft-roaders pitched up against it, bu I wouldn't recommend it for vigourous off-roading - some beach work and light off-road work should be fine though.    The 2.7L V6 is a bit thirstier than normal, especially when mated with a 4WD drivetrain; but the 2.0L four-cylinder 2WD model makes an ideal urban light-SUV if thats what you're chasing.    Colour wise, I very much like the light metallic aqua, dubbed Aqua Silver, or the metallic Charcoal Grey. The interior fabrics and finishes are quite hardy, the base model is fnished in a charcoal hard-wearing cloth, while the upper-spec models are finished in a similar coloured leather (Hyundai's leather upholstery can become quite hard and uncomfortable if it isn't treated with a leather conditioner as needed, however, I much prefer the Hyundai's cloth upholstery anyway..)|`|HUluAQM3aa	Decent truck.

AA11142677	there are 2 possibilities for this  1. if rack has no assist when car is first started [generally first start of day] but assist comes back after car warms up. the seals in the spool valve are shot [bypassing fluid internally] and replacement of the rack will be required   note:[low buck re-manufactured no- name racks are subject to be as bad as the one you just took out]   2 less often the steering pump fails. this can be determined by momentarily pinching shut the pressure hose with engine at idle.  if bypass valve is stuck open there will be no change in engine speed.  if working properly the engine will bog down and constant idle motor will open to a larger setting as computer tries to compensate idle speed.due to the increased load|`|AA12352011	Steering pump bypass valve sticking.Get a scrapper pump|`|fe9b89ef9075d826f6d2b372470173b0aa	It could be the power steering pump itself going bad.

About 1ft behind the front wheel along the edge of the bottom side of the car, you'll see a steel tab protruding.  That's where you prepare your jackstands to hold the car.      About 6inches or so behind that tab along the steel frame, you can place your jack there to begin to lift the car up.    Good luck!
AN1EpGMqaa	I've read all your posts regarding the electric servo motor that actuates the all wheel drive.When they say they checked it with a meter and it draws too many amps,that means either the motor or the part that it drives is stalled.Somehow,this is probably a coincidence that has nothing to do with any collision damage.Maybe you can find someone else to look at it who is willing to go the extra mile to fix it without making a big deal out of everything like the dealer does.You'd think that after spending so much insurance money with them they would be willing to help you out here.|`|AXNkmdbKaa	What damage?

On a side note the Ford 5.0 max fill line was too much oil, the crankshaft hit the oil.

Kickers are good beginner subs|`|7ObGOaPPaa	First Kicker in not a terrible brand. Neither is it as great as the second responder claims they are. with their lighter cones for higher sound quality. a lot of people think that kicker's sound quality sucks. and they aren't very sensitive woofers. most are in the mid 80 range I believe.    the kenwood woofer is decent, but dual 3 ohms is a bit weird. you would either end up with a 6 ohm load, or a 1.5 ohm load. If you're going to run at 1.5 ohms you might as well run a 1 ohm.    alpines are decent subwoofers, higher sound quality than kicker, but not as loud usually.    some other brands you can check out are JL, JBL, Rockford Fosgate, Pioneer, and memphis. I have a memphis m3mojo 15 and I love it. but I'm going to try and keep this post as free from bias as possible. you should look up the companies you are thinking about and figure out what you want on your own.    I would start by checking the sensitivity rating of each woofer you consider. the higher it is the louder the woofer is. my mojo has a sensitivity of 92.57. thats very good for loudness, because a woofer with a sensitivity of 89 will need twice as much power as my woofer to be just as loud as it is. and most kicker woofers are under that 89 db sensitivity range.    another thing to look at is the frequency range, and the resonant frequency (which is the frequency that the woofer plays the loudest at).

If so they are usually behind the glove box, but depends on the vehicle. Yep they can be a bit expensive in to 2o-40$ range. To save money I made my own from foam packing that is like an air filter, just had to cut to shape. this way I can remove and wash, no need to buy a new one.|`|a919ffaf7b39c58d58f4680cb8cc3324aa	Your car probably never had the Cabin Air Filter.  Before about 1999-2000 they did not even exist.  Often (depending on year/make/model) the CAF is an option, not a standard item.  The car may be fitted for one, but it may not have been included on the option list of your particular car when it left the factory.  If you bought it new and still have the window sticker then it is easy enough to find out.  If the car is equipped for but not with a CAF you can certainly install one.  People with allergy problems in particular may find the improvement in air quality desireable.      Cabin air filters do need to be replaced periodically, many owners don't even know they have one (and dirty ones can be a health hazard) and NOBODY checks their own.  Why do you take your vehicle in for routine services like oil changes?  Because you want to maintain it properly, yes?  So why are you threatening to call the BBB when a shop tries to do just that?  If I may humbly suggest, it would be better if you got your facts straight before you go bats--- crazy over something this minor.|`|Ty32khkaaa	It will eventually clog up the heater core, but besides that it is not that big of a deal.|`|soerAzoMaa	35 dollars is a good price for a cabin filter.

gwj1a9jPaa	Generally, you should allow a car door's width between yourself and the parked cars. As you are driving past, imagine someone in the parked car opens the door - would you hit it? If so, you are too close!    There are occasions when you may pass closer than a car door's width - if that's the case, slow down enough so that you could stop if a door was opened. Driving that slowly would also give you more time to judge your distance.    You could, of course, ask your instructor to demonstrate to you exactly what he means - if he can't do that, find another instructor!    Hope that helps a little :-)|`|bxlYleZkaa	You will simply get used to it!|`|zOIgzIy4aa	i always like to park at least 1/2 car to a car length from the car in front of me. that way i can get out if someone pulls up too close to my rear.|`|1NWjta2jaa	Move the steering wheel a little from the parked cars and stay there.

And they cars come with jacks and spare tire. If you are going to put on together out of your house here are some suggestions.  A gallon of water in car at all times for you and vehicle 4 ltr bottles will do. A pair of leather/construction gloves, a knife in the drivers reach to cut off seat-belt(the ones that have a glass breaker on the end are ideal), a Phillips and flat head screw driver, a Mylar or wool blanket, road flares or cones, jumper cables, flashlight, Multi tool w/knife, a sun visor that has need help on one side.  Keep a Chilton guide of your car and owners manuel in car.  Some things are easy to fix.  Also a basic socket set for your vehicle whether metric or standard depends on your car. When your care gets older carry a quart of oil.  Some gardening tie also doesn't hurt.  It's a spool of twist tie that you cut to your own length.  A basic first aid kit bandages, Tylenol, ace wrap, sling, tweezers. If going on long trip make sure to have a cell phone with a GPS. Anything else would be climate and weather related for your local area.

U24VtSlZaa	Employment taxes is a big priority with IRS -- your employer has also been cheating you out of 1/2 the social security taxes (which they are required to pay).    Interesting thing about social security taxes is, they can make the employer pay it even though he never withheld it from your wages.  Not the same with federal withholding tax -- you're going to owe tax when you file your return, no way around it.  (Assuming you have taxable income after deductions & exemptions & credits).    The IRS website has instructions on turning in violaters, you might even get a reward.|`|FIxcpiA4aa	Even though you didn't fill out a w-4, you should still receive a w-2.

AA10353490	I'll assume you are talking about an engine block heater.  Some years ago, when it got really cold, we would place a trouble light under the hood and placed an army blanket over the engine and closed the hood on it.  When we got up in the morning, the car started right up and the heater starting working a lot faster.<br>  <br>  You could also place a trouble light inside the interior and let it warm the insides over night.  <br>  <br>  Just be careful, those light bulbs get really hot, make sure that the bulb doesn't come near anything or else you could start a fire or damage the interior.<br>  <br>  This is just what I used to do to get by when I was younger.<br>  <br>  good luck|`|bxlYleZkaa	Do you know, I honestly thought those things went out with crossply tyres!|`|uTA2TLC6aa	Take a look at the fuel burning heaters from Eberspacher and Kenlowe.<br>  <br>  I think they can both be used with timers so your car is warm and ready to go.|`|uzepqbXIaa	I got 1 from maplin to defrost the windscreen.  nice idea, but to be honest its too slow.  its faster to fill a bucket of water from the tap and chuck it over the car|`|yzZchHHTaa	You mean a block heater?

HFrsH9MRaa	If you have decided that this car is a keeper, get a new radiator, There are plenty of radiator hospitals and exchange clinics all over the country. After you do, do yourself the BIGGEST favor, and have your entire cooling system flushed out, and install Mercedes Benz coolant. It is worth the few extra dollars it may cost. There is a mammoth lawsuit against GM coolant that they are fighting (what else is new?) The chemical composition of the MB coolant protects better, prevents plastic component meltdown, and should last 100,000 trouble free miles. NEVER believe that all coolants are the same or that they come from the same manufacturing plant or have the same pro-perties. This is H@#$%^&T!!! It was probably the chemical breakdown of whatever coolant you have been using that caused the original radiator to trash itself out. Get SMART!!!|`|JkTGq2BJaa	Get a  radiator shop to mig weld a new piece on to the radiator.|`|QBKB4F4saa	I like the idea of a radiator shop welding a new inlet/outlet tube onto the radiator. Or get a junkyard radiator.<br>  As far as the coolant, considering its a 92, just get whatever coolant you can afford. Then again there is the "elitist" viewpoint of using good coolant, but unless its going into a supercar, then who cares! Maybe I don't know something, but I've been using cheap coolant from Menards for years with no problems. As long as you mix it 50/50 and change/flush the system every so often, you should be fine.|`|pJThuVtzaa	U can try placing the hose clamp as close as posible to the radiator.

They'll expect you to make it good.      Your neighbor's insurance should cover this.  Make sure you exchange information with her.  Also make sure you file an accident report.  If you don't do these things, you may have to pay for the damage yourself.    You're regular auto insurance policy may very well cover this, also.  Ask your insurance agent.  If they do, you may be able to have the rental agency work directly with your agency.  However, it's often better to have your neighbor's policy cover it, if possible.

114a9e7f24177ba552a0e5c76a745e27aa	how would your insurance know about your previous "accident" if you paid to repair a flat yourself. you aren't required to report a flat tire incident to your insurance unless you need to file a claim for a tow truck or something. Millions of tires are repaired every year without insurance involvement. Tell them you didn't consider a flat tire an accident or worth calling them over and that you will not open a claim on that. A flat tire repair does not cost $500, most places like discount tire do it for free. your leaving something out
0lBwS4QFaa	Well this all depends on your age for how much a accident will effect your insurance and by how much.  It seems like you are not that great of a driver if you are having allot of accidents and you possibly already have a record of accidents.  That may be why you tried to hide the other accident.      In the previous accident you did not repair the car correctly, because why are they noticing damage, you must have did a cheap cover up not repair it or there would be no question.  They can tell by rust and how old it is from prior damage.     Now they can charge 2 deductible and two accidents or they could just cut you a check for what it would cost to repair the current damage (Minus (-) deductable - prior damage cost.  What is left over is yours to try fix your car with.  That might be what they do if you just play stupid and have them decide how they want to pay the claim.       This all depends on the what company you have and what they do.|`|t5MNWDeBaa	For car insurance the fastest way to get a cheap quote is do a policy comparison.

Get the estimate for the new repairs less what ever they feel is previous damage and bite the bullet and get it all fixed once and for all.|`|U24VtSlZaa	Ok, there's no way they can make you pay the deductible when you never made a claim.    You are not compelled to report or make a claim every time your car goes in the bodyshop.  By *not* making a claim you save money for the insurance company.    What they are saying is that you still have damage from the first wreck that needs repair.  They think the repair costs they are looking at now came from separate events, so you have two deductibles.    Wrecks can sometimes cause damages that aren't apparent until you disassemble the car.    Here's what I'd do:  1.  Go to the first body shop and talk to the manager or service advisor that worked with you.  Find out what they know, and what they would say if an insurance adjuster comes to investigate.    2.  If you are right, they should tell the insurance company that they completely fixed all the damage from your first wreck.  That can only help you, not hurt you.    3.  If that's the case, then make a full report to the insurance company, and insist they interview your body shop.    4.  If for some reason the other shop says they did leave some damage unrepaired, then you just deny everything.    Remember, you've done nothing wrong, and they absolutely can *not* make you pay again for repairs you've already paid for.  Get a lawyer if you have to.  Don't take this kind of crap from your insurance company.|`|fOVqBv2Daa	Pootie what they are trying to say is that they got you. if you want them to cover the new accident then you need to report the old one and suck it up unless you want to pay for both accidents yourself.|`|EopteDzsaa	I don't understand why you didn't report it in the first place.  Instead of paying $2800 out of pocket, all you had to pay was $500 deductible and maybe a slight rate increase.  It still woudn't amount to the $2800 you already spent, and subsequent rate increase you are facing now.    Obviously there is nothing you can do but reopen that case with them.  They already know about the previous damage.  Did you buy your car new or used?  If bought new then you are SOL, but if it was used you could blame it on previous ownership {but you've done enough lying, so maybe not}|`|29ZL58Xjaa	Unfortunately, you are going to have to tell them.

sh6Gn0qvaa	First, $17,000 for a 2003 is WAY overpriced! That's criminal. In this market, that car should go for absolutely not a dime over $10,000, even with 30,000 miles. That car isn't worth much.    If you buy a car with 99,000 miles, you're buying massive trouble. The G35 is known for being cheaply made inside and expensive to maintain because it chews through brakes and tires every 20,000 miles. This is not an exaggeration -- check out any G owner forum or this very section of Yahoo Answers and you'll see how problematic this little car is.     The 2003 is severely underpowered, too. Ditto for 2004 and 2005.|`|Ti0q1Btiaa	I hope you can obtain a maintenance record with it.    Do you have any idea what repairs cost on some of those cars?  Think about it, and be prepared.

Be sure to get a carfax report for that car. The only issue i would be thinking about is how much power it would make. As the engine gets more miles on it, crap builds up, parts wear out so it might not be as powerful as a G35 with lower miles.  BUT with all that money you saved, you could completely rebuild the engine and turbo or supercharge that sucker and it would be fast as hell.|`|NZvYP7Q2aa	The condition of the car is dependant on the previous owner(s).  There is a normal routine service table for every make and model and they all differ depending on the car.  For instance, an Accord might say to change the timing belt at 90K whereas a Camry might be 105K and the previous owner may or may not have taken good car of these things.  In any case it is best to take it to a mechanic for a pre-purchase inspection so that you don't end up with costly repairs that the average person could not readily see.

eEzzyavTaa	It all depends on what state you live in. I'm in Nevada an we can get permits at 15. if your a teen driver you have to take a drivers course. but if your 18 you only have to take the written test than the driver's test. every state is different. go to your home state DMV web site and you should find the answer there. Good Luck. ;)|`|AA10092510	In Pa, you can get your permit at 16 yrs of age, It's probably the same in most states.|`|7B33ZEuMaa	well where i am, you can get your permit at 16 years old... but yeah you never have to take a drivers ed course, its mostly for the driver to be safer and you might get a discount off your car insurance bill when you take the course, but otherwise the DMV should have nothing to do with ur drivers ed.|`|AA10788612	Yup, as I know it. At age 18, you can take both the written & driving tests on the same day. But if you haven't driven at all, you will fail the driving part of the test. When you are still 17, you must have a parent w/ you because they have to be there with a car in their name. In Illinois, you can own a car at age 18, but in order to get one, you have to have a license & insurance on it. So that leaves you with having someone else's car on test day. And where I live, they make you show proof of insurance before the driving test dude gets in the car with you.
iNi2G6UWaa	The quick answer is yes - if you're a good driver you'll get used to it very quickly.  Just make sure that when you change lanes, you check your mirrors extra carefully for a little while and check your blind spots.  When over taking, it's always a good rule of thumb that if you can see the car you've overtaken in your rear-view mirror, you can't possibly hit it!|`|764013f096cd69445fb9f8249adc7462aa	I personally have the same car 03' and it's something you'll regret not feeling comfortable. i know someone in the same situation except she wanted a ford explo 04' and now drives it like no other. so you should be able to fit in with your new car.

9EdJHqKHaa	you can't have 2 different insurance policies on the vehicle. One coverage, with multiple drivers listed, but not multiple coverages with multiple drivers. You have the option of liability or full coverage. Then you can choose from full tort or limited tort. You can have liability coverage with full tort. If you cannot afford full coverage then that is your best option. You can look this information up online so you have a better understanding of the differences. (if the car is still being financed then you must have full coverage regardless)|`|EopteDzsaa	That is a good question.  I too am curious about that, but for different reasons.  Just an assumption, but I don't think the Ins co will object to you having an additional carrier.  Just like with health care, you can have a primary and secondary ins coverage.  At the end of the day I think it depends on you "the customer" to decide if it is worth paying for coverage from two carriers.  Either way they still get their money, and in the event of an accident there is a 50/50 chance they will be contacted.  Sounds like good odds for them, No?|`|2mRFIAVraa	SoCali, For auto insurance the quick way to get a low quote is do a car policy comparison. If you choose the same coverage levels, you can get an fast quote to compare against others. Use the same zipcode, car make/model, mileage and driving history to ensure you get accurate comparison. To get fast auto insurance quotes, go to http://www.simpleautoquotes.com/Auto-Ins... and you can compare all the major auto insurance companies.|`|LuqZXXyBaa	You CANNOT have two insurers for one vehicle, it's illegal and insurance fraud! Also, PIP is only coverage for you! The state does not care about YOUR coverage, they want to make sure that you have liability coverage for OTHER drivers. If you cause an accident do you really think they people that you hit are going to be satisfied knowing that your medical bills will be covered but theirs won't? Uhhh no.    If you're driving a vehicle YOU need to be insured. Tell your mom to find another insurance company to insure the vehicle. If you have a bad driving record, do you really need to be on the road? Especially on the road and UNINSURED? Oh my goodness, please park the car until YOU have insurance.

There's an Odometer Discrepancy check box, you have to check to say the odometer is right or wrong.      The title itself is a little confusing as to where you sign and where you print.  If you own the car now, you're the seller and they're the buyer.      The buyer takes the green sheet to the county clerk's office, they have to pay the sales tax to register and get a tag.  They pay the state tax where they live.    If you are selling for an unusual price, there's a "gift form" to fill out.  That's about it.
oiW7wZkuaa	Stock t-stats on most modern vehicles is 195 deg. If your vehicle has a tendency to run hot (and your cooling system is well-maintained and functioning properly) then going with a 180 deg t-stat will help bring engine temps down slightly.     If you have no issues, the best solution would be the original 195 deg t-stat. Using the 195 deg version will also ensure a quick warm-up and maintain the factory emissions specs. You live in a moderate climate (summers are typically not scorchers) and so the 195 deg should do you well.      160 deg t-stats are typically used when you put a "performance" chip in your engine computer ....I would not use one on a stock vehicle.|`|1SnI86BIaa	195 is most likely the stock temperature|`|AioBp16Eaa	Hi  Use the temp range for that motor. The reason being is that it has to match the spark plug heat range. If if that is incorrect the plugs will fail,   so you don't need that happening!|`|GaLw1qMwaa	higher temps open up when it reaches that temp.    you prob want a lower temp one considering you live in a COLD environment.|`|AA11537248	The parts counter guy can look up the factory setting.    I'd go with the 180 degree, just to be that much cooler from the boiling temp.|`|DydFQ0fcaa	Unless you have modified your engine, you should always stick with the manufacturers recommendation. On your 03' Durango you should be using a 195 degree thermostat.    The thermostat's job is to maintain a minimum temperature. Beyond that, an engine that runs hot is usually more a function of the cooling system as long as the thermostat is not stuck closed. A thermostat that sticks closed can quickly cause overheating, but one that sticks open can also create problems. If engine temps are abnormally low at slow speeds and climb as speed increases, the t-stat may be stuck wide open. Contrary to popular belief, maximum coolant flow though the system isn't a good thing. At highway speeds, the resultant high coolant velocity can cause it to pass through the radiator too quickly, limiting heat transfer and causing the engine to run hot. For this same reason, running with no thermostat is not recommended.

I find that when I go to ARCO with the 10% ethanol my car doesn't run as well and gets poor mileage. Union 76 gets me the best mileage. However, I'm sure it varies according to which refinery is making the gas.    What grade to buy also depends on your altitude. On trips to Utah I can't use the 85 octane they sell there. Here we have 87 and that works fine. So, experiment a little and then stick with the one that works best for you.

Yes, it's huge and floats all over the road, but there's nothing quite like riding in it. Especially on a long trip, where it's so comfortable you might as well be sitting on your living room couch.     It's not that bad on gas, either. It gets about 18-20mpg running around town, and a consistent 25mpg on the interstate. That's far better than the huge SUVs that seem to be taking the place of the traditional full-sized car.     We had a Nissan Pathfinder immediately preceding the Towncar-not a big SUV by most standards, but it still only managed about 18mpg on a good day on the freeway.

"clumpy oil ???"|`|fO5JWKMlaa	well first things first.  change the oil.    then you can narrow it down to too much coolant, blown head gasket, engine sludge, etc.|`|RQzsmvfiaa	To add to JTL's answer, add an oil system cleaner 5-10 mins before you change the oil. It will at least take out the gunk in your engine. The damage is more than likely already done, but at least now the problem can be narrowed down. Oil sludge alone can cause things like a head gasket to go bad.
yi3gEZoaaa	Martin is correct, you wouldn't have found this procedure in the manual anyway. It came with the UGDO (Universal Garage Door Opener) itself when it was purchased and installed. But the exact same thing is at the website. Basically you hold the button for several seconds until it flashes, then hold your remote up to it and press its button. However, if you have a rolling code opener, it is a little different. Also, if the button you want to use already has a code in it, you will have to delete it. To do this, you have to delete all the old codes. That is in the procedure also.  Here is a simple run down which would probably work for you, but double check.       1.  For first time training, press and hold the two outer HomeLink buttons, releasing only when the HomeLink indicator light begins to flash after 20 seconds. (Do not perform this step when training the additional HomeLink buttons.)     2. Hold both the handheld transmitter button and the HomeLink button you would like to program until the HomeLink flashes slowly then rapidly (then release both buttons)     3. Press and hold the HomeLink button you just programmed. If the garage door opens/closes then programming is complete. If it does not then proceed to step 4.     4. Get a ladder and press and release the learn button on the back of your garage door motor head     5. Within 30 seconds get back into your vehicle and press and release the HomeLink button you just programmed up to 3 times or until your garage door activates. Programming is complete.|`|sCqdisvnaa	Go to homelink.com and follow the link for your country.  Look for the link on how to "program homelink".

You can also test this and see if it is shorted by checking out a wiring schematic, or if you have an identical switch, another idea would be to take and complete the circuit that the switch is supposed to complete in the right turn and if the right turn lights blink as they should, then it is a problem in the switch, if not then you have a wiring issue.  also you will want to disable the air bag system most likely before you begin working on this just to be safe|`|v6NdNE4xaa	shouldnt need to fix this your car is still under warrenty take it too mazda|`|qPz4Dem3aa	Interesting.

uFQFRdczaa	It could, the tps is pretty delicate on the 4.3 engine.  You can also get this sort of response from half a dozen other things, including the o2 sensor, leaking fuel injectors, egr, and too much spark advance.  If the TPS is far enough out of whack for you to notice it "flood out" the engine, it should set the check engine light and there will be a code for TPS.  Scan your codes, that will point you in the right direction.|`|DV4xyeChaa	or the the crank position sensor...is ck engine lite on? scan might help....could also b a leaky injector|`|Q4O1v13Qaa	Short of actually witnessing it for myself, it certainly sounds like you could have a dead segment on your TPS. A simple "sweep" test could tell you for sure. Step  6 under "Testing".  http://www.autozone.com/az/cds/en_us/090...  Although they show a DVOM being used here, I prefer a high impedance analog voltmeter. Much easier to get a good reliable reading. Or at least set your range properly (autorange off), and watch the bar graph instead of the numerical display.

These special screwdrivers go by "T" sizes. (i.e. T15 or T20). Your local auto parts store can help you get the right tools. These screws are common on just about all cars made in the last 15 years and you should have a set if you want to do your own work.|`|f2b602340ec1c3f14c6da18edee430f0aa	With a screwdriver.

You would need a motor and trans that fits in there lengthwise so you'd probably be limited to a v6, maybe $500  then you need the transmission of that engine, maybe another $400  then you need a driveshaft, you need a rear axle, and a modified rear suspension, all of which will have to be custom $$$!!$$$  Then you need to convert your speedometer, your ECM, your fuel system, the A/C lines $$$!!!AAA!!!$$$  then your fuel tank needs to be changed, the exhaust, so many other things you cannot forsee...  ... as you can see it is expensive and probably won't handle very well and it might twist in half but it is possible!     http://video.google.com/videosearch?hl=e...|`|a919ffaf7b39c58d58f4680cb8cc3324aa	Take the cost of buying a car that already has RWD.

So you would need to more or less, build a custom car from scratch and then make the body fit. And you would need a completely custom drivetrain.    I kinda hope you find a way to do this though. I wish my car was rear wheel drive! (although it's probably cheaper for me to just get a GTO)|`|d1ee48df00eb4b8567acf7a43aeb1c1aaa	*laugh* If you have to ask...     There is no "normal cost" for doing this, because doing it is INSANE. What's the normal cost of converting a Honda Civic into a boat?    Seriously, you are in "Monster Garage" territory with this one.      However, as a specialist in insane conversions, let me tell you - cost is irrelevant, because this will be a labor of love that you will be doing yourself.  You will be a grand master at welding before this is through, and you will know a fair bit about powertrains and suspension alignment, as well as bodies and interiors.  You might be able to pay subcontractors to do small jobs, but nobody will take your money (even up front) for the whole job because a) the cost would be insane, b) nobody can say they're good at this, and c) nobody wants liability for the roadworthiness of the result.     Your first question will be "front engine or mid-engine"?   Mid-engine would allow you to take the existing powertrain from another Elantra and "simply" relocate it to the back.  Use an automatic transmission unless you have godlike powers of getting shift linkage clear around to the wrong side of the engine.  Car and Driver magazine did this to a Honda CRX around 1985; they retained the front engine, making it a twin!  Both engines would auto-sync through the road.     Front-engine means you will need to find a "rear axle" setup, either a live rear axle like a Firebird, or an I.R.S. like most modern rear-wheel-drives.  The live rear axle would be easier to "get right", the IRS would be very sensitive to alignment.     All of this will require so much cutting on the car that you will weaken the chassis, which will make everything more complicated, and run the risk of the car just shattering in a collision.  Just to make the independent rear suspension work, you'll need to add braces to stiffen that area.  Probably need braces throughout the car.     Since we're already in the "insane" department, here is another option.   Make it electric drive.  This simplifies notching the driveshaft through the middle of the interior, because with the electric motor in back, the "driveshaft" is wires.  Then you can use whatever you want for energy source, pure batteries like the Maniac Mazda (11.2 seconds in the quarter-mile, woot), hybrid-electric, or even straight gas-electric like a locomotive.  If you consider that route (which will complicate OBDII, as your transmission is now electric) talk to the EV list. http://www.evdl.org/    An added, project-killing complication will be OBDII, if you live in a smog state or if your state adds a smog law in the future.  Making such a car OBDII compliant absolutely CAN be done - I've done it - but it's another area where you're going to need some mad skillz, mostly electrical and government-hassle skills, and you'll need those skills before you begin the conversion, so you buy the right engine with all needed parts.  Great books on that subject are sold by http://www.jagsthatrun.com/     There is one more way to convert FWD to RWD.  Choose a model that was built with an AWD option.  Pull the RWD powertrain from a junkyard car and bolt it up.  Pull the OBDII powertrain from an RWD vehicle 2002 or newer so the transmission is pointing the right way.|`|ju4SMQYtaa	well you will need to find a rear wheel drive motor that will fit and a transmission and the right size drive shaft  it will cost you ALOT|`|gpNkuxNIaa	first what r u smoking.second u need a full frame  or weld a frame to car. the easy way is to bolt the body to a full frame|`|uMKuOlFNaa	They would have to modify the whole suspension, exhaust and custom make a rear end, driveshft.

U2Wl03c3aa	Like many have said it really depends on how much you want to spend.    The high end run-down is the 7 series ($80-85k base), 6 series ($78-86k base) and the M5 & M6 ($85-108k base).  Both the 7 series and the M5 are very nice sedans.  If a coupe is more your thing, it's the 6 series or M6.  The sportier vote goes to the 6 series, M5 & M6 out of those.  The 7s are very luxurious, but not really that sporty.    Mid level pricing goes to the M3 ($55k base sedan, $58k base for coupe, $66k base for convertible),  X6 ($55-58k base), X5 ($48-56k base), and 5 series ($46-60k base).  The sportier ones, IMHO, are the X6, M3s, and 5 series (especially the 550 and maybe the 535).  The X5 is nice, but not quite as sporty looking as the others.  The 5 series is a great combination of sporty and luxury.  Some people would go more with the luxurious on that point though.    The "low end" pricing for BMWs are the Z4s ($36-42k base), X3 ($39k base), 3 series ($33-44k base), and 1 series ($29-40k base).  The Z4s are roadsters and thus pretty sporty and lux.  The 3 series is most common and is available in pretty much anything you want (sedan, coupe, or convertible, even a diesel).  They are sporty and luxurious.  They can be loaded with options to make them into anything that you are looking for as far as luxury insides.  The 1 series is only available as coupes or convertibles.  The X3 is somewhat sporty, but mostly utility.    Pretty much any BMW is a good choice for lux and sports, but personally I'd get an M5, M6, M3, X6, 6 series, or 550 or 535.  That's just my opinion.|`|YLajQcFkaa	All of them are overpriced junk.  Get a Honda.  Note my screename!|`|3b3052873874a18b5ea83205f5549b9aaa	It would have been helpful if you had stated what your budget is. There are many different BMW models that are both sporty and luxurious, but the price differences are significant and this depends on the body style and the options you want in the vehicle. Even a fully loaded 1 or 3 series can cost some serious change. The new M3 would be perfect for what you're looking for. The styling is aggressive and the engine in this car has more power than you'll ever need---no matter how heavy your foot is. The Z is a head-turner, but the space is tight. The 6, the 5, the 3, or the 1 all fit your criteria as well. The only one I wouldn't recommend is the 7. Its definitely luxurious but not sporty.|`|JUcVPFEcaa	Well, how much do you want to pay?  All of the BMWs are luxurious interior-wise, but I would say an M6 if you can afford it.  They have the body lines of an old Merc hot rod, and a carbon fiber roof.  If that's out of your price range, I'd go with the M5, then an M3.  The 7-series has been a bit too gaudy for me since they changed the bodies a few years back, and it's definitely not "sporty".|`|sySZNkcsaa	It really really really depends on how much you want to spend. If you want something that looks good and is a great tourer, get an M6, if you have a family, get an M5 (basically the same car but 10,000 dollars cheaper and it has 4 doors). Both of these are great but they hover just above and just below 100,000 dollars, not what a person normally considers for a new car. (both with 505 hp)    Just below that, the new M3 is a much more sporting drive, albeit not as comfortable or as fast in a straight line, again, this car is very expensive at almost 80,000 with no additional options. (420 hp)    In the realm of sane pricing, a 335i has more power then any sane person will need (300 hp, 300 lb-ft tq). This car is around 40,000 dollars. the 330i has less power (220ish hp), but is cheaper and still has plenty of grunt to get you from a to b.    If your penny pinching, the fastest car for the money BMW has is the 135i coupe. This car has the 300 hp engine in a smaller body for 3000 less, but is not as luxurious or spacious as the 3 series.|`|VcVQSOS8aa	Well if you want something luxurious and sporty the 535i would be good.  It has a 3.0 Liter turbocharged inline 6 cylinder engine. They are very nice but they cost about $51,000.  But if you something more sporty and fast go with the 335i.  That has a 3.0 Liter turbo Charged engine. Very nice or the fastest or them all the M3 with the 4.0 liter V8 with 414 horse power.  BMW's are very sporty and luxurious and Fast. There are a lot of choices. The M3 would be the best for sure.|`|xJukjCWiaa	The BMW 3 series has been on the 10 best car lists in a number of big name car magazines like Automobile, Car and Driver, Motor Trend, Road and Track etc. for like the last 13 years. Often times car magazines will say BMW sets the tune for other car manufacturers in its class to follow.    I'd get a 335i
mwu6aJuyaa	I believe they do go up a little, and it might not be worth it for you if you have a deductable. If the cost to fix the dents is 500 and you have a 500 or 1000 dollar deductable your going to pay for the entire thing anyways. If it costs you 700 to fix and you have a 500 deductable, sure it will save you the 200 bucks but after your rates increase it wont be worth it.    There are places that you can get dents removed from a car without having to paint or replace the body part. That might be a cheaper option for you.|`|lN1tk0yLaa	I recommend an online insurance quote. It's free and generally hassle free. http://www.simpleautoquotes.com/Auto-Ins...

Make sure that you choose similar policies with the same limits, auto model, location, etc so that all options are an accurate comparison.

Also each dent is subject to a separate deductible.  So if your deductibel is $500 you will pay the first $500 for EACH dent.  Take your vehicle to a detail shop and see if they can fix it.
