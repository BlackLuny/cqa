This seems strange seeing as the Bible describes just about every other taboo sexual act.

If Christianity has been around for thousands of years, I'm pretty sure that Jesus will already have a huge crowd around him.       Does every person get to spend their own time with Jesus alone? Are there a bunch of copies of Jesus? What exactly does it mean to "be with Jesus." Does Jesus stand up on a stage and talk to all the millions upon millions of Christians?

However, dead children go to eternal heaven despite never being tested. Life can't a test if potentially billions of people go to heaven who never experienced a test by dying early. Thoughts?

20090219171655AAphSPm	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	Is religion partly to blame for America's educational system's poor ranking?	Not that I'm looking down on America (gloating from my cozy spot, somewhere in the top-5, while USA are down the bottom list: rank 18 out of 24)...    http://archives.cnn.com/2002/EDUCATION/1...       ...but I can't help to think there's a link somewhere. I've seen some really strange things in America: from Christian-approved texts books to parents home-schooling their kids because of the "negative influence" of "school policies".      And these don't apply strictly to science classes, we're talking about history, sex ED... and even Christian math-books (wtf?)!!!      There's also the problem of the teachers' beliefs... Why are teachers questioning the educational programs?... Teachers refuse to teach evolution because they "don't believe in it"?      Shouldn't teachers be able to put their own beliefs aside when times come to teach? We stop racist, sexists, antisemitic, cultists and other weirdo teachers because of their personal beliefs... but religious teachers get away with it?        ... Are Scientologist doctors allowed "not believe" in some specific diseases too? Would you consult a doctor who does not believe in psychiatric illnesses and tells you that you are hallucinating because you are possessed by the ghost of an alien who died 2 billion years ago?... And they have plenty of evidence to back it up too!      I think there's something very wrong in America's educational system, from selecting textbooks to selecting teachers.      Is religion partly to blame for America's poor educational system?      **Note: the numbers in the article are from 2002, but there is a more recent UNICEF survey that ranks America down 19 out of 24 in 2006... I just can't find it again, sorry.**

Does formless earth imply a earth with no physical dimensions or is it more like a barren sphere or plane or other geometrical figure? If god did not create the water, just shape it into what we see on earth, then what does that make water? God made everything from nothing right? Nothing would imply the abyss i guess, so what is water made from from a relegious view? Also if god was there with all that water, was he a giant whale?

Their was a bunch of balloons around and people too. But that's all I saw and then I just snapped out of it. It has been freaking me out for a while and I don't know what to think. Nothing like this has ever happened to me. I can't talk to my parents they will just think I'm crazy they don't believe in this kind of stuff. Was it a past life memory or something? I'm pretty sure it was meditaion though and I heard that meditation can lead to seeing visions from past lives. Please help it would be greatly appreciated! =]

20090219190638AAwr7oV	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	What makes you the blessed man or woman described in Romans 4:7-8? Why?	Romans 4:5-8 (NKJV)   "But to him who does not work but believes on Him who justifies the ungodly, his faith is accounted for righteousness,    just as David also describes the blessedness of the man to whom God imputes righteousness apart from works:   'Blessed are those whose lawless deeds are forgiven, and whose sins are covered;   Blessed is the man to whom the Lord shall not impute sin.'"      "Blessed" means "happy, fortunate, to be envied"      How does God impute righteousness to you? Why shall the Lord not impute sin to you? Has God lowered His holy standards or has God done something to justify you? How would this knowledge allow you to enjoy your blessedness in Christ? God bless you and have a good day. :)

I have a good sense of observation and I notice that pretty much all things we have and do in modern life is some how either financed or invented by jews. Technology, Mcdonalds, finance/banking, movies etc ..pretty much every thing. And looking at the most influential people of the 20th century were all jews...i:e Marx, Freud, Einstein and so many more. So from all this I assume  jews are probably wiser and far thinking then most of us.They are innovators and entrepeneurs. Do You agree?
20090219193601AApivZN	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	Was Joseph Smith confused? Or was God confused?	It was prophesied in the Old Testament of the Bible, the Messiah would be born in Bethlehem. The Book of Mormon "divinely interpreted" by Joseph Smith says the messiah would be born in Jerusalem.    Oops, Jesus was born in Bethlehem. Jerusalem and Bethlehem are two separate cities, not just a spelling error. Was Joseph Smith full of BS, or was God confused?   This is one of the many reasons that many who have investigated the LDS church believe that the Book of Mormon is a fraud or at best a adventure novel.

Well, the other day we were in our business class, and I was sitting with two of my friends. Our teacher gave us an assignment which was to be done in class over a few lessons, and one of my friends (we'll call him friend A) wanted to work with me while the other (we'll call him friend B) wanted to work with friend A.      Meanwhile, there was another really cute guy who had nobody to work with, so i let friends A & B work together, so I could work with the other guy.      We get along well, and my problem is that sometimes we look into each other's eyes, I just don't know what he means by it. I'm looking into his eyes on purpose but I don't know what's going through his head. He acts straight and everything, and he hangs out with obviously straight guys. The bottom line is that I can't see him with a girl, I'm not sure why, but I just can't.       I want to find out whether he's gay or bi, but I just don't know what to do, I feel helpless. Can anyone give me a bit of help?

There was Roman interference but that's not part of the question.  Judaism as I understand began with Abraham and the new boys 'Islam' are in agreement with the 'People of the Book' at this stage. Islam, what is your problem?  The Jewish Book is a guide, yours is a provocation!  Prove me wrong.

(For sisters, the amended question is, do you pray whenever you are required to pray)      2 - at what age did you start praying your 5 daily prayers and haven't stopped since !! (do not say in 2001 when only last week you missed some prayers)      3 - what is your age and what country you live in ? (this will help me stereotype you) (joking..this question will show us where we are all from and so on..)      4 - if you answered NO to the question 1, which means that you don't pray all your required prayers, please give us the reasons why you don't, and what prayers you have most difficulty in, and whether thats due to your being in school or uni or college or work and so on.. this question is where you add details. The other questions should be very straightforward yes/no true/false etc questions...

"I group them together cause child molesters claim they dont have a choice either. To be honest I think its a joke that our govornment has different sets of rules for them. If gays are allowed to express their sexual desires, then so should child molesters. Or no one gets to!"      I've seen this inane comparison time and time again.      Why don't they ever bring up a comparison of HETEROSEXUALITY and molestation of children? Is being straight a choice also?      Child molesters have a choice to molest defenseless children. It's a harmful action. Being attracted to the same (or OPPOSITE) sex is not a choice nor harmful.      What's the correlation then? Can anyone explain to me how they are grouped together coherently and justifiably?

I see kids wearing those to write love on her arms t-shirts and they don't even care the meaning behind it. I guess this question isn't really a question, and is more like a rant... but I don't understand people who feel the need to glamourize cutting like it's some kind of relief for not getting the type of attention that they wanted in the first place.

I recently went to Half Price Books bookstore to get a bible and some books on Jesus and I saw an Angel Oracle Kit.

20070121180022AA08zFp	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	The Call from God.?	America is country full of a lot of christians, now why are we hogging up the worlds wealth by like 80 percent? I believe if we have one dollar we should split it and each have 50 cent. It's what jesus would want us to do. But no, we'd rather buy television sets, instead of using the money to save a kids life in a 3rd world country. We'd rather live well than help save a bunch of people. We'd rather buy computers than give the money to a kid in kuwait and feed him for a lifetime. To be christians and watch the whole world suffer but live comfortably yourself should be a sin. Would what Jesus say if he saw the world today. America with ipods, video games and ect and other countries that has tons of people who can't even have 1 meal. Where is the equality? When you have 10 t shirts and the other guy doesn't even have 1 or a kidney. Pray for the world for a change and not yourself. The selfishness i see sometimes is unbelievable don't you agree? Captialism is also evil jesus would hate it

20070709233856AAtN8xk	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	Was it ungrateful pacifist Christians that made the great Jihadist slayer "Vlad Dracul" into a villain?	In the 15th century, the great Vlad Dracul was a champion against invading Jihadists. Vlad used the savagery of Islam against against Islamists, by taking the Turkish Muslim impalement method and turning it upon the invading Muslims.      Ultimately, the Muslims finally killed him, but not after he had proportionately killed many more of them and brought great fear to the Turkish Muslim empire as well as great expense.       Its amazing how prudish Christians, who benefited from Vlads resitance, snobbishly turned their noses at Vlad and villified him....eventually making him into a monster.      By the way, Muslims still impale people today, you can watch REAL footage of Muslims impaling people on strangeland.com (look in their video archives and use 'impale' as a search word).

Next problem, my teacher gives us a vocabulary list, and on the test he gives in fill in the blank questions where we fill in the appropriate vocabulary word.

20081006202712AAvbCBo	Society & Culture;Languages	Is Catalan the same as Spanish?	Sorry if this has been asked before. What is the main spoken language in Spain? Is it Spanish or Catalan?      Speaking of Catalan, is it the same or perhaps a variant of Spanish language? If you can speak Catalan, can you also speak Spanish? Or if you understand Catalan, do you also understand Spanish? If they both are totally different, then what are the differences? Are the differences that big/significant?      And about Spanish language, is it the same in Spain and throughout all Latin American countries/territories, e.g. Mexican Spanish & Dominican Spanish & Puerto Rican Spanish & Colombian Spanish & Venezuelan Spanish.... etc etc etc? Is there a significant difference in its language structure, or grammar, or vocabulary, or the words? Or is it just a matter of dialects (kinda like British English vs. American English vs. Australian English etc)?      Thanx in advance.

White guys always "hit" on me for some reason. When I show interest, it turns out they want to have sex or are just looking for a friend with benefits. I dress very conservative and I don't talk about sex or come off easy. Why is it that these guys only want me for sex? I have been told that I am very attractive, but I want more than sex. What is it that I need to do differently to stop sending these mixed signals? I have been celibate for a while now, I just don't understand why they think I am that way. Please help???

CAESAR      (aside to ANTONY) Let me have men about me that are fat,      Sleek-headed men and such as sleep a-nights.      Yond Cassius has a lean and hungry look.     He thinks too much. Such men are dangerous.         ANTONY      (aside to CAESAR) Fear him not, Caesar. He's not dangerous.      He is a noble Roman and well given.       CAESAR      (aside to ANTONY) Would he were fatter! But I fear him not.      Yet if my name were liable to fear,     I do not know the man I should avoid      So soon as that spare Cassius. He reads much.      He is a great observer, and he looks      Quite through the deeds of men. He loves no plays,      As thou dost, Antony. He hears no music.     Seldom he smiles, and smiles in such a sort      As if he mocked himself and scorned his spirit      That could be moved to smile at anything.      Such men as he be never at heart's ease      Whiles they behold a greater than themselves,    And therefore are they very dangerous.      I rather tell thee what is to be feared      Than what I fear, for always I am Caesar.      Come on my right hand, for this ear is deaf,      And tell me truly what thou think'st of him.

First of all, Indonesian uses Latin alphabet unlike many languages in Asia that use characters of their own (Chinese and Arabic for instance). In addition, a lot of Indonesian words come from other language making it more similar to a European language rather than an Asian language. Also I've heard that Indonesian is easier to learn rather than other Asian languages. Finally, Indonesian has fairly easy grammar. Why it is not similar to most Asian language?

I'm having trouble with the pronunciation of 'gli', 'glia', 'glie', 'glio', and 'gliu'.       I think it's because the book i'm reading says to think of it as spanish llya, llo, lle, and llu. Which is quite confusing to me and i can't think of words or anything to help me pronounce this clearer or tell me that i'm speaking it right. I've tried the online pronunciations and it still doesn't come out very clear either. Because most of those speakers are male. So... i'm out of ideas..      What would help me to picture this pronunciation better?? I already have most of the pronunciations down like ci, ce, che, cia, cio, cie, ciu, but its just this little one that i've trouble with. What words can i picture that might really help me??       The other pronunciation that is like spanish is the spanish n.. like senor and stuff like that (sorry i don't have the little squiggly line i don't know how to fix it like it). But those pronunciations are quite all right..       Any ideas? Anyone? Thank you..

I've noticed when it comes to strength competitions like worlds strongest man or powerlifting competions, even though there are many african american competitors, they never even come close to winning. I watch these competitions all the time and usually the three big winners are Icelanders Poland and Russians. Do you think maybe it has something to do with the cold climate? They also say people who originated from cold climates live generally longer than their hot climate counter parts. Just an acute observation. I myself am 1/2 black.

20081105085832AAE99pG	Society & Culture;Languages	Poll: What do you think of this idea for the world?	Please star if you find interesting!      Oh, and Just read it and answer, it doesn't take that long!      You people who said "too long" or something like that are LAZY!      Democracy would still be in all countries by the way! This includes world polls and elections for all politicians! Also, the culture would be preserved, they would just have to agree to specific ideas set throughout the entire world. All forms of religion would be allowed to be practiced (as long as it doesn't disobey the World laws) and the morality lessons from religion would be emphasized.      New holidays would also be created as well for religion which would be a "day of rememberance" for the prophets. During these holidays, at a certain time, there would be a "moment of silence" for the prophets and the messages they preached.      Picture this, a World Government, World language (universal language that everyone speaks), World currency, World court system, World recognized working conditions, World recognized human rights such as some of the freedoms mentioned in the constitution and the bill of rights, a United Nations that is very effective and deals with all problems around the world through diplomacy and (very rare) war through a World army set to create peace. All nations would recognize a single global authority although each nation would be able to keep their own army for when they are needed. Also, the internet would be easy to use and would be able to be accessed by everyone who had a computer for free. All government officials would have an 4 year term limit for every politician who would then be up for reelection again. A politician can only serve 2 terms each which would be one of the World laws. Solar power would be used as the main source of energy and used in all ways it can be. Also, there would be a pure form of Capitalism in the market which would be backed by some type of Communism for some of the people who end up not succeeding.      So, what do you think of these thoughts?      btw: I am not calling this idea "good" or "bad", I am just sharing ideas with you.      To everyone who saw it more than once: Sorry, but I will be asking the question many times to get different opinions from different people. I am sorry you saw this question twice or more than twice.      Thanks for all the answers!

20080402214809AAtooRA	Society & Culture;Other - Society & Culture	Does anyone else ever feel like this about growing up??	I'm having some real conflicts with getting older. I loved my childhood. I was happy all the time. All my memories are good from then. My life is okay now, but it pales in comparision. Nothing is the same as it used to be.       Another thing- innocence. I love how when you're little, you don't have any cares in the world. No one does drugs, no one has sex, no one drinks, everyone is young and pure and innocent. Nothing is messed up. And I know drinking, drugs, and sex aren't that big of a deal. A lot of people do them. But it's like I have this natural tendency to be upset when I hear about people I know doing that stuff. And it's not like sex is even harmful, or drinking/ smoking pot in small amounts. But that's not it...it's like the whole ruining innocence thing. I realize that innocence is only a concept and this probally sounds stupid, but I've been feeling like this for awhile now, and it's just hard for me to cope I guess.    Can anyone relate/ give advice/ just repond?? Thanks!

And yet I find myself looking down on them anyway. And it makes me feel so hypocritical too because one of the things I hate is people who are really judgemental of others. But that means I'm judging the people who are judging others. I am just sooo confused. Help please anyone??

I know priests are tremendously busy doing their dutys, coming up with daily homilys, etc. But, say for some small amount of time he had a moment to relax, are they still allowed to watch some TV, listen to music, play some video games? Or must they be constantly pious and not do that kind of thing? I know my priest has mentioned reading catholic blogs and listening to catholic podcasts, but what are the limits? Thanks!

20080306200952AAY27Yp	Society & Culture;Other - Society & Culture	?Por qué la gente no se da cuenta de que tener hijos está mal?	Tener hijos es, para empezar, obligar a nacer, imponer la vida en este planeta horrendo sin que nadie nos lo pida. Es perpetuar el sufrimiento sin que ni siquiera sepamos hasta dónde puede llegar ese dolor, ya que en la vida pueden pasar mil cosas. Lo de que "la vida es un regalo" es una estupidez inmensa y lo de que "también hay cosas buenas por las que vivir" otra, si cabe más grande, ya que es como decir que una bonita flor vale todo el sufrimiento del mundo.      El surgimiento de la vida fue la peor tragedia que pudo ocurrir, aunque muy pocos nos demos cuenta, y perpetuarla la mayor inconsciencia o atrocidad.      Yo siempre lo he tenido claro, siempre me ha parecido algo incluso obvio y jamás he tenido la más mínima intención ni  deseo de tener hijos, ya que Sé que está mal. Jamás cometería semejante atrocidad, y aunque pasen los a?os no deja de sorprenderme que a penas cuatro gatos nos demos cuenta de la abominación que supone tener hijos, y encima seamos nosotros los "locos".

20080620185255AADWPYJ	Society & Culture;Cultures & Groups;Other - Cultures & Groups	Refer to women as "female"?	So, I personally dislike, when a man refers to women as females. ie: "I have no luck with the females." "I was talking to a female.." I've heard it a variety of places. I feel like a science experiment when they say that. It may just be me. I mean really, my cat is a female, I am a woman. I'm just wondering:   1) Are there any other women that share the sentiment   2) For the men, why does "female" pop in to your head, why don't you call us women?    Thanks, and I'm not bashing anyone's choice of words, I'm sure most guys don't realize it, or even mean it in a deragatory way. I'm just curious thanks.

I read something that if you're doing a spell which involves candles, not only is the timing important but the way the wax melts can show signs of whats happening, just like some like to read the way the wick on the candle is burning.  For example I'm asking this question because for the past month I have been burning a pink candle over a picture of me and my boyfriend and every time I let it burn out the wax has melted all over his face and more towards him and some on mine.  I burn the candle on a level platform and place it in the same spot.  Anyway could anyone tell me how to read this?  And please only serious answers...if you dont know it then dont bother thanks.

Oggi ho sentito in treno ho sentito un tizio che parlava del cinese e diceva che ha fatto una figura di merda in Cina per la faccenda dei toni:      "Eh sì, perchè in cinese ci sono quattro toni e una stessa parola può voler dire la stessa cosa in base alla tonalità in cui la dici. Comunque anche loro si capiscono poco. Per esempio, è un linguaggio molto simbolico. "Uomo che riposa" si dice "Uomo che sta sotto a un albero" che però come frase può voler dire ogni cosa. E' un continuo dialogo per cercare di capire quel che vuol dire il tuo interlocutore..."      E' dunque vera quest'ultima cosa? Che la lingua cinese non è fatta per capirsi al volo?

Si stava facendo tardi, percio' dissi a mio marito: "preferirei che tu non guidassi al buio; dovremmo cercare un Bed & Breakfast per la notte. Potremmo non trovarne uno dopo cena." "D'accordo" rispose, "ce ne deve essere uno da queste parti. Ecco il cartello, seguiamolo!" Svoltammo in una strada che portava in una splendida villa in un enorme parco. "Quello non puo' essere un Bed & Breakfast! E se è davvero un hotel deve essere così costoso che non ce lo possiamo permettere!" "Faremmo meglio a fermarci qui" disse John, "non voglio passare la notte in macchina". L'estate prima infatti, nella stessa zona non eravamo riusciti a trovare un alloggio e avevamo dovuto dormire in macchina.

This may seem an odd request, but can anyone translate all or parts of this, or try to, into german, while keeping with it's "proper" tone? (if you do any parts, please mention which parts they were, in english)  I randomly try to translate things but as a semi-newbie to German I wasn't able to get far on this:       "Dr. Evil: The details of my life are quite inconsequential... very well, where do I begin? My father was a relentlessly self-improving boulangerie owner from Belgium with low grade narcolepsy and a penchant for buggery. My mother was a fifteen year old French prostitute named Chloe with webbed feet. My father would womanize, he would drink. He would make outrageous claims like he invented the question mark. Sometimes he would accuse chestnuts of being lazy. The sort of general malaise that only the genius possess and the insane lament. My childhood was typical. Summers in Rangoon, luge lessons. In the spring we'd make meat helmets. When I was insolent I was placed in a burlap bag and beaten with reeds- pretty standard really. At the age of twelve I received my first scribe. At the age of fourteen a Zoroastrian named Vilma ritualistically shaved my testicles. There really is nothing like a shorn scrotum... it's breathtaking- I highly suggest you try it."

20081006142239AA7IzkZ	Society & Culture;Languages	Need Some Help With Italian (10 Points Best Answer)?	Ok, I'm in 10th grade Honors Italian, I know I'm not using perfect Italian here, but this is the level we're being taught at currently, so here are my questions:      1) When do we use the indicativo? What is it..?      2) If I want to say, "My uncles/aunts want to go to Mexico", would I say "I miei zii vogliono andare in Mexico", or am I supposed to use "a".  I think my teacher usually makes me change it to "in", but why? I want to say that they want to go to Mexico, not in Mexico.      Also, how do I get more natural at this? I usually have to think for a while before saying something in Italian.  For fill-in-the-blank questions I can do it easily because I've memorized the rules, and on tests it says above the questions in what form it should be conjugated, so I can do that because I memorized the rules.  But if I actually have to speak I have to think if its in the right form, and what tense my sentence is in..

Someone called me "laotong" and I found the definition on line in English, but have been unable to find the Chinese character.  I live in southern China and none of my friends seem to have a clue what I am talking about.  Maybe it's a northern thing, I don't know.     The English reads, "More precious would be a LaoTong or "Old Sames" relationship. This was a more rare and formal relationship between women and was exclusive and life-long. Often a LaoTong relationship would be formed when a marriage was contracted between families "in-utero" before the babies were born but both children turned out female against the hopes of their families. Otherwise a LaoTong relationship would be formed through an intermediary like a match maker much like an arranged marriage. Women of suitable birthdays, ages, backgrounds and birth-signs would be paired this way in a bond of exclusive sisterhood that would last a lifetime and would survive marriage, child-birth and widow-hood. A LaoTong relationship would be rarely renounced or broken.

20081020083949AAUfP70	Society & Culture;Languages	Error in Spanish Dictionary? (Word for "living room")?	I was looking through my Spanish dictionary at school, and there was a diagram of a house with labels to names of different rooms. You know, the typical el bano, la cocina, etc. Except for living room, it said "El living"??? I thought living room was la sala? There's some regional dialect in here, and I know that Spanish borrows some words from English (Like how the spanish word for internet went from "el red" to "el internet" because of the English word for it). Is this just a typo--or does any sort of Spanish speaking country actually use "el living"? I'm probably overthinking this WAYYY too much :P

20081107223759AA1D9Hz	Society & Culture;Languages	Weird /s/ sound I make?	My "s" sound is like any other conventional "s" but there seems to be a lot of air, almost slight whistling.     my family started noticing the change to my "s" sound about two years, but now it seems to have gotten a little worse.  I'm not lisping in the "th" way, and i'm also not lisping in other common forms.  the closest i've gotten to matching my "s" problem is the lateral lisp (like Sid in Ice Age) because of the amount of air i produce, but there are no common traits other than that.   My tongue's tip touches the roof of my mouth, right behind the back of my teeth but not touching teeth.  and the sides of my tongue are (at least I think it does) touching the bottom of my top teeth, but only slightly.      So, basically, whenever i say "s" there seems to be a slight whistling sound and a lot of air.  how can i solve this, what can i do, any suggestions?  thanks in advance for your help

I am referring to public transport staff, post office staff, council office workers etc etc.       When you see such people in old photographs they look IMMACULATE; peaked caps, shining shoes and brass buttons on military-officer style uniforms.       Why has there been such a change recently? Bank staff, train crews and the like all wear horrible neon polo-shirts and the women have to wear silly hats. Surely this doesn't inspire good moral or instill respect on behalf of their customers or passers-by? I should know, I have to wear such a monstrosity myself.       Is it just a matter of cost, or practicality, or both? I know a lot of modern retail uniforms are actually thought up by catwalk designers...if this is true, wouldn't the money used to pay them be better spent designing uniforms that people would actually be proud to wear?      I'd like to hear what you think- and particularly if you wear a modern style of uniform at work, would you be happy to swap it for a smarter, more conservative look?      Thanks!

20090220025035AAmOtGH	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	Christians, do you agree eternal punishment is morally justified (this is for CHRISTIANS, not Atheists).......?	The fact is God gives you more than enough time to convert and accept Jesus. He can see into the future. God does not want robots and he doesn't want to FORCE you to accept Jesus.       The fact is we are all sinners and everyone deserves punishment that never ends because we sin.      If we sin and we don't accept the truth, if we don't accept the free gift, if we don't accept the sacrifice, then we send OURSELVES to eternal Hell. We get what we want. God gave us the means to decide if we want to avoid it and it's up to us to accept it.      Do you agree?

However, I am not sure if I will make it.

Her first term schedule was very confused by the school. I have a good experience from last year.      Yujin has to attend PE8 class everyday  I wonder if Yujin is the only student taking PE8 five times a week Monday through Friday. I know we can't change her schedule now.      Yujin told me that attending PE class 5 times a week would be quite tough. However, I know she will be fine if there are some other students like her in PE8 class. I hope she is as strong as local students.      I always care for her. She is still struggleing with English. I don't know when she is able to communicate with other people who can express how they feel. I deeply understand how difficult she is when challenging for English since I have gotten through the same processing she meets now. I just want her to be happy whether at home or at school.       Please fee free to contace me if you have any concern for Yujin.       PS. May I ask your Extension number of the school in case I have to phone you.      Regards,

20090203120420AA2wpUB	Society & Culture;Holidays;Valentine's Day	My Fiancee is a romantic, what should I do for HIM for our 1st V-Day together?	My ex of 6 years was NOT a romantic in any way, shape, or form.  Every one of my attempts to do something romantic for him fell flat since he felt bad for not doing anything for me.      After our break up i started dating a guy for only two months before he proposed.  My fiancee is a romantic, he's got me giant stuffed animals, bought me roses because i was feeling down, took me on a vegas getaway, and even bought me 96 roses and spread them out all through our living room.      What would be something I could do for HIM that would be just as romantic (yet very affordable as I only work one day a week while finishing my degree).  Any help would be appreciated.

20090220024637AAEhMHR	Society & Culture;Holidays;Ramadan	The difference b/w bible and Quran regarding Adam and Eve, which is more fair?	The judaeo-christian conception of the creation of Adam and Eve is narrated in genesis 2:4 thru 3:24. God prohibited both of them from eating the fruits of the forbidden tree. the serpent seduced evet to eat from it and eve in turn seduced Adam to eat with her. when God asked Adam, he put all blame on Eve. 'I'll greatly increase your pains in childbearing. your desire will be for your husband and he'll rule over you' (timothy 2:14)      let's look at what Quran says about the first creation:      "And O Adam! Dwell you and your wife in Paradise, and eat thereof as you both wish, but approach not this tree otherwise you both will be of the wrongdoers. Then satan whispered suggestions to them: "Your Lord did not forbid you this tree save you should become angels or become of the immortals.''. And he said "Verily, I am one of the sincere well-wishers for you both.'   So he misled them with deception. Then when they tasted of the tree, that which was hidden from them of their shame (private parts) became manifest to them and they began to cover themselves with the leaves of Paradise. And their Lord called out to them (saying): "Did I not forbid you that tree and tell you: Verily, Satan is an open enemy unto you" They said: "Our Lord! We have wronged ourselves. If You forgive us not, and bestow not upon us Your mercy, we shall certainly be of the losers.''   (7:19-25)      the Quran,contrary to the Bible places equal blame on both Adam and Eve for their mistake. nowhere in the Quran can one find the slightest hint that Eve tempted Adam to eat from the tree or even that she had eaten before him.Eve in the Quran is no deceiver or temptress. moreover, Eve isnt to be blamed for the pains of childbearing. in Quran, God doesnt punish one for another's fault. both Adam and Eve sinned and asked for forgiveness and God forgave them both.      The Quran does not portray the pains of childbearing and pregnancy as a punishment, but rather enjoins people to respect their mothers for the pain they suffered.   " We have enjoined on man kindness to his parents: in pain did his mother bear him and in pain she gave him birth"
20090220022300AA21ObI	Society & Culture;Cultures & Groups;Other - Cultures & Groups	How do I deal with a friend who has racist views?	I am quarter Albanian and quarter Irish and the rest English and my friend is English. I am very sensitive to racism as for 4 years as a child I lived next door to a mixed race family who were constantly accusing my family of being racist (out of spite, we NEVER were) and when they met my grandad they started calling us racist terms related to South-Asian people (as they mistook my grandad for South-Asian), I also work with refugees so I see a lot of the racism that they suffer. My friend on the other hand was brought up in a predominantly white area and went to university in a totally white city, she says when she moved back to our city it was a shock and she was made to feel like the minority in her "own country". I challenged her reasons for saying it was her own country and she said because the majority population here is ethnic minority and I said that most of them were still born here and she said well their parents weren't, I started to get offended because that implies this isn't my country either or my parents because they both have parents who weren't born here. When she said this is her country because she is white I challenged her and said if she feels like that then she IS racist, she got angry with me.    She also says things like Irish people are British and I try to educate her that Irish people see themselves as totally different (which they are) and that they were invaded by Britain and many fled to America as a result, and that Northern Ireland (Wales and Scotland too) are still occupied by England and Irish people don't like that. She thinks that they should just get over it because she is Utopian and thinks we should all just get along, but I try to tell her reality is not like that and whilst there are people whos countries are occupied there will always be problems. She also constantly calls Romani people gypsies and I've tried to tell her that they don't like being called that (I did a module on Romani culture at university), but she still does it.       Anyway, my mum thinks she is racist and it is starting to bother me. She does have emotional problems as she has Bipolar Disorder, as do I, and we are good friends but she has complained that I am giving her a complex because I'm always telling her she sounds racist. But I think its my duty as her friend to let her know so she doesn't get into trouble one day (she has had a bad experience in hospital when two black girls accused her of being racist).

Atheism obviously means you don't believe in a god, and while im more accepting of the Islamic god (which is the same as the christian god) (i don't like the whole jesus story) I just cant bring myself to believe in Allah, andi mean actually believe he/she exists      I am a completely islam newbie, so please don't use big Aramaic words or Quran verses i know i wont be able to understand, pronouce or 'get'      But seriously, my question is...      I want to believe in a god, i just cant because my logic tells me otherwise. Why am i so diffrent from the billions of religous people in the world, what is your 'secret'?      PS: I used to be a christian and i believe there was some guy watching out for me and i did love him and i believed in the bible and ALL that, but yeah, time changes and i seem to have grown out of christianity.

How is God not the guilty party by making us this way?  How can salvation be received by killing God himself (Jesus)?  Why create Satan to do Gods dirty work?  Obviously this is Gods will for us to be living in hate and deceit w/ just a portion of love to try and counteract all the evil.  How can Adam be punished when he didn't know good or evil before the sin?  Was it not a trick?  Adam was intelligent because he named all the animals, but as intelligent as he was, he wasn't aware of good and evil.  So therefore he was innocent, since he knew of no evil while he was doing the evil.

20090220022354AA3vAk0	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	Aren't you denying God is omnipotent when . . .?	Hello all.      I frequently read questions and especially answers in R&S making quotes to the effect of :      "You can't be saved if, unless, or by, etc.".      Sometimes it has to do with certain acts or prayers.      Sometimes it has to do with how/if a person reads or interprets The Bible or even which version of The Bible a person reads.      Sometimes it has to do with which religion or denomination a person follows or don't follow.      Most of the time it boils down to :      "You can't be saved unless you believe as I do.".      I'm not speaking of those who say "I believe" or "my Church/religion believes", I'm speaking of those who go out of their way to preach hellfire, damnation and doom all to it who don't subscribe to their own particular religious tenets.         My question is simply this :   By telling anyone they "won't be saved unless", "they can't be saved unless", they aren't going to be saved because" or anything of a similar nature, aren't you in effect saying :       "Those are the rules and God has to follow them !"      Think about it, you may have your own beliefs and are entitled to them but by enforcing them on others of differing beliefs as binding aren't you saying "even God can't choose to save you".      If, as I believe, God is all powerful, I feel I would be insulting Him were I to tell anyone of any faith or of no faith they can not/will not be saved.      God is The All Powerful and is not some red tape minor city hall court clerk bound by red tape and doomed to forever making sure He dots His I's and crosses His T's.   He is The Almighty and as such, is bound by nothing.      I've read questions and answers which stated good people who live their lives every bit as well as Jesus asked us to live but were not of one of The Christian Faiths were still doomed to hell no matter how good their lives were.   I've also seen the same said of Christians by certain non-Christian followers.      And worse, I've seen it said by Christians about other Christians of differing denominations.      Where does anyone have the right to LOCK GOD ONTO ANY COURSE OF ACTION or to speak with His voice regarding those of other beliefs.      I''m a Christian of  The Roman Catholic Faith, a Church which has a great many Doctrines and Sacraments we follow.   Our beliefs, Doctrines and Sacraments are solely for us.   We believe in them and do our best to follow them but do not consider others to be bound by them.   They are for members of The Roman Catholic Church only.   Any potential convert who could not be comfortable within our belief structure would not receive the Sacraments bringing them into Roman Catholicism.   Those of other faiths are not subject to our Doctrines or our judgment.            Jesus taught us to pray :      Our Father.   Who art in Heaven.   Hallowed be Thy Name.   Thy Kingdom Come,         ***********THY WILL BE DONE.**************         not ours.      As it should be.         Regards,            Lenny.
20090220025055AAUiOb6	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	Why is there a sudden Influx with Atheism?	Why are there so many Atheists in today's world, is it a lack of belief or are people just getting to lazy and self righteous to believe in God anymore (sorry if that sounded rude, I didn't intend it to be). Or could it be that Americas hatred for the Islam nations runs so deep that we now hate all religions that have had conflicts in the past?
20090220015255AA9O2Fw	Society & Culture;Cultures & Groups;Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, and Transgendered	I told my fiancee that I may have feelings for a girl?	 http://answers.yahoo.com/question/?qid=2...       Previous question ^^       Last night my boyfriend and I were talking and he noticed that something is wrong with me. He kept asking, eventually he just went through different scenarios, and then he just went, "Are you worried about never finding a girl for you?" And I just said, "What if I already found her and she probably doesn't want me?"      He kept asking questions and in the end he just said her name. I didn't deny it. I kept telling him how embarrassing I find it and he just told me that I have to learn to accept myself. I asked him not to tell her, he said he wouldn't. My reply to that was basically, "Yea, because for you there's a lot on the line too, eh? My girlfriend is bisexual, more attracted to girls than men and I'm basically the only man she loves sexually and emotionally..." He denied that and said that if I told him to put it in the paper he would have done that too.       All three of us are really good friends. She's probably my best friend.       Will it be completely awkward from now on? I never told him because I didn't want him to see every gesture towards her like I want to get it on with her!

I remember seeing a documentary last year about parts of the bible that had been removed, I cannot remember what it was called.      But there was something I remember about the Adam and Eve story that said was different at some point and was removed later on.      The removed passage said something about a female being created from the ground like Adam before Eve. Her name I cant remember. But it was said she was cast out of the garden because she would not submit to Adam and then Eve was created from Adams rib.   After that it was said women used to fear this female that came before Eve as they thought she was the cause of miscarriages and perhaps other things.      My memory of the documentary is very hazy and what I have said above is just what I could barely remember, I may have got bits of information wrong.      I just want to know what the females name was who came before eve and what the passage was? Anyone knows what I might be referring to?

20090220015848AAsrQwc	Society & Culture;Cultures & Groups;Other - Cultures & Groups	How do I help my black son who wants to be white?	My son, age 6, came home from school yesterday sobbing and pleading that he wanted to be white.  When we talked about it, it turns out two older boys told him that they didn't like him because he had brown skin.  We dealt with the two older boys but I am worried that he may be carrying these kinds of thoughts around with him.  We have always discussed how beautiful his skin is because it's true and tried to instill pride in him about his race and culture.  We have, since he was a baby, exposed him to the collective strength of African Americans and the pride that goes with that.  This isn't the first time this has happened.  My husband and I are white as well as his adopted sister.  He is adopted and we have friends we spend time with who have adopted transracially.  We want him to have a strong identity and pride in who he is.  I feel it is very fragile if an incident like this can make him want to be white.  We spent a good bit of time yesterday discussing his feelings and he felt better having the bullies dealt with and discussing that this country elected a black president (and he has a white mom, too!) and it helped.  But I'm worried about what he is feeling inside and what will happen the next time someone makes fun of him or insults him.  Any suggestions?  Thanks.
20090220015855AAWGLpx	Society & Culture;Cultures & Groups;Other - Cultures & Groups	How to deal with narrow minded and backward people?	My family is from India but moved to europe for more than 35 years ago. I was raised in an very open and balanced enviroment. My parents adopted a a little boy (who was related to us) in 1992 when he was 4. He grew up in the same house as me but now that we are all grown up he has very different views and values than we were raised with. Our mom passed away 12 years ago when i was 17 so i became responsible for raising my adopted brother which i didnt go so well. We have alot of bad history and been completly avoiding each other for the past 6 years. I just had to moved back home because of financial reasons.      Im 29 , still single and is focusing on my career. Yesterday we had a huge fight where my brother started to attack me verbally. He said pretty harsh things like "i hope you die with cancer like your mom, you are almost 30 and still not married, shame on you" and that its embarrasing for him when people ask him why his sister (me) is still living her life and gets to do whatever she wants. He also added that people from our community say bad things about me because im too indipendent and travel alot.      Im very dissapointed but mostly shocked that sat this age and time  there are still people who are so sexist and ageist. I will have to live under the same roof for the upcoming next months and i really dont know how to live with a person who is so conservative and narrow minded as he his.

20090220031926AAw7Hxy	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	How do I explain to  non-Buddhists how the metta bhavana benefits the people to whom metta is being wished?	The main effect is the conditioning of 'my own' mind, which will change my interactions with other people and, eventually (like the butterfly effect) benefit the people to whom metta is being wished.  Is this a suitable description to help non-Buddhists understand?      I've often been asked "is it like praying" and I have to answer "yes, sort of"... and then I'm asked "who are you praying to?" and I answer "no-one" or "myself".... but that just confuses people more!      Buddhists, what would be a better way of explaining the direct benefits of the metta bhavana practice to non-Buddhists?      Non-Buddhists, if you heard the description above etc, would you be happy with it?      Thanks      NOTE: I'm talking about Theravada practice here, so veneration of healing Bodhisattvas etc or other Mahayana practices is not applicable.
20090220031729AATebKl	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	Does God love my father so much that's why he's still alive?	My father is vile and cruel, selfish, arrogant, wicked, hateful and every negative things you can associate with him. He's bad person, husband and father. I hate everything in him. I have suffered too much from him. I can't tell you how but I can say that he ruined my life and I just can't forgive him this day and age. I don't know if I could ever forgive him. What I am today is all bcuz of him. I dont want to give further details about this.      Anyway, he's name is a kind of irony - Jesus. Yeah, his name is Jesus. I don't know why my grandparents chose that name for him. They must have not noticed the 666 mark on his scalp!      He's 63 and for us he will never change his evil ways. Metaphoric and biblical speaking he's like an old,dying tree branch. He must be cut and burn! I don't know why he's still alive. He's recovering from a surgery now. I told him last week, "you must change your ways. This is your 2nd life already." he didn't listen to us. I wish he just died last week! I don't know why he's still alive. Is it because his name is Jesus? (scoofs)      ps. Those are tough words. Sorry for the others who love their dads. You have no idea how much pain he's caused me

20090220031445AAS97Ez	Society & Culture;Cultures & Groups;People with Disabilities	How would you cope if you had a sister with special needs?	i have a little cousin called nicole, who is four years old. she is a very spoiled little girl, who always gets upset when she doesn`t get her own way. she was an only child raised by her single mother. aunt rose had recently got married again. her husband is a man called harry, who was a single father. he has a six-year-old daughter called jade. jade had also been greatly spoiled by her father, who doted on her. after the wedding, the two girls did not get along. nicole often tattled on jade and got her into trouble. jade thought nicole was an annoying little sister. unfortunately, jade got cancer and was in the hospital for ages. she had to undergo many treatments, including chemotherapy, which made all her curly hair fall out. when she got home, people gave her most of the attention. they let her have her own way because of her illness, which made nicole jealous and bitter. nicole feels ignored and left out. she threw temper tantrums and became greatly attention-seeking. she had even tried to fight with jade on some occasion.. there were times when she was mean to her sister. nicole had teased jade, called her names and took her anger out on her. when they go out as a family, jade might not feel well and they have to hurry her home. nicole would cry and scream because she wants to stay and play. aunt rose and uncle harry would just comfort her, saying"we have to go home now because your sister is tired. we will play later." what can i do to help them?

20090220025346AAwsK11	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	Original sin, digusting, who agrees?	Original sin, is basically what Eve / Adam did, according to the Bible, and because it says because of what happend, Almighty God has punished every born and living baby, they have sin in them and are born sinners.      In Islam babies are born pure and sinless, how on earth can you call a baby a sinner? If he / she dies being born as a sinner what's the consequence? Now you'll attemp to give me asnwers, but at this attempt because it lacks logic and structure, i'l get 50 different answers. in the sense different solutions. Please dear christians, i respect you, but this belief of original sin is heavily condemed. THE BIBLE DOESN'T EVEN TEACH IT.      UNLESS YOU ARE SANE, ARE AWARE OF YOUR ACTIONS AND CONSEQUENCES (PUBERTY IN HUMANS) DON'T HAVE A DISABILITY WHICH AFFECTS IT, OR ARE NOT A CHILD, YOUR ACTIONS HAVE CONSEQUENCES.      BABIES ARE PURE, BORN SINLESS, AND HAVE A FRESH UNTOUCHED START AS A BLESSING FROM ALLAH.      What kind of language is this? What teachings are this? BABIES BORN AS SINNERS FOR AN ACT THEY DID NOT DO?      A british man , wrote a book and said original sin is the most disgusting teaching that even the ruthless generations didn't even think off.      Adam and Eve both ate the forbidden fruit(the holy Quran does not shift the blame to Eve only), and Adam (pbuh) and Eve (peace be on her) asked for forgiveness, and they were forgiven ,but expeleed from the Garden , sent to earth, but Allah promised guidance, those who took heed will prosper.      Guidance came in prophets i.e Moses(peace be on him) Jesus(peace and blessings be on him and Muhammed(peace be on the last and final messenger)      PROOF FROM THE BIBLE AGAINST ORIGINAL SIN;      “The fathers shall not be put to death for the children; neither shall the children be put to death for the fathers: every man shall be put to death for his own sin.”      Deuteronomy 24:16      “But every one shall die for his own iniquity: every man that eateth the sour grape, his teeth shall be set on edge.”   Jeremiah 31:30       Again, the Bible states clearly how salvation can be achieved;             “If my people, which are called by my name, shall humble themselves, and pray, and seek my face, and turn from their wicked ways; then will I hear from heaven, and will forgive their sin, and will heal their land.”   2 Chronicles 7:14             “Let the wicked forsake his way, and the unrighteous man his thoughts: and let him return unto the LORD, and he will have mercy upon him; and to our God, for he will abundantly pardon.”   Isaiah 55:7      “Suffer the little children to come unto me, and forbid them not; for of such is the Kingdom of God…Verily I say unto you, whosoever shall not receive the Kingdom of God as a little child, he shall not enter therein.”   Mark 10:14-15      So it says you have to be like a child to go into the kingdom? In context have no sin. A child has no sin.                   Now if the idea of all children being born with the black stain of sin was among the many teachings of Prophet Jesus(as), then this statement would have never been made by him considering that Christians believe that unless a child be baptized in the name of Jesus(as), that child could never inherit the Kingdom of Heaven, but rather suffer the doom of hellfire and damnation. Any belief that Christians have in regards to a child being born in sin is refuted by the above words of Prophet Jesus(as). He makes it clear that unless you are as “innocent” as a child, you can never inherit the Kingdom of Heaven.       I'd like to end this question with a verse from the Holy Quran;      "When truth is hurtled against falsehood, falsehood perishes, for falsehood by its nature;bound to perish" - Holy Quran 17:81

20090220025506AA3FzP5	Society & Culture;Cultures & Groups;Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, and Transgendered	How will i know if my best friend is gay and in love with me?	im a guy and in 3rd year highschool. I have a bestfriend who is just sooooooooo handsome and good looking. we've been best friends since prep level and still friends until now. We are really close and very touchy too. When our eyes meet, we gaze into each other's eyes until someone looks away or asks why. We do everything together and I would even pay for everything when were together just because I want to be with him. I honestly go crazy if i dont get to talk/chat/see him. HE is really good looking and alot of girls are doing extraordinary feats to add him in friendster, chat with him or simply see him but he doenst have a girlfriend. He is kinda emo-ish but on a very small level.Aside from the fact that he is not that talkative but only i can make him talk for long. I really love his laugh. I pretty much make a fool out of myself just to see that beautiful smile and laugh. My other classmates have told me that he sometimes looks at me when im not looking. The look that says i love you. That kind of look. When we watch movies, he would sometimes hold my hand if theres a scary part(this could mean that he is either trying to stop me from covering my eyes or just wants to hold my hand) and leans on my shoulder. Its very sweet. I have this strange feeling when he is beside me and he hold my hand. I pretty much go to some school events that are not mandatory just to see him. He is the type of guy who looks like a girl. emo-hair thin body. He doesn't act like a gay-girlish person who flaunts but he acts like a shy girl. Really looks like a girl. I treat him as one. I really love him and i dont know if he feels the same way for me. Im pretty kinda defiantly maybe sure that he is gay for me. I even think he sometimes begs me to kiss him cause he looks at me when our faces are JUST TOOOO close. I also feel the strong amount of WANT AND NEED to simply press my lips against his.u know guys. there was recently an event that happened in my class. one of my friends who is really gay told they guy he was gay for. That guy said that he wasnt gay and now the whole class knows it and their friendship is now destroyed. i wont let that happened to me.   but i did ask him one night if he loved me as a friend. he said yes. I love him. How do i know if He is gay?
