Hr0wGp56aa	Maybe like mannequins even though they are expensive.  You can put like a sewing kit on a desk and maybe a ruler to "measure".  Put clothes on a rack and not in a closet.  A couch.  Although it's kind of expensive if it wll last a long time its worth it.  Also a birhtday or holiday can work to get everything.|`|P0h7lY7raa	lots of flashy big pop out colours!!!!!! and stuff like that!|`|B462SFJaaa	wow, if u are a girl, i think that u should put like bright colors, but be careful because some bright colors look really great with some dark colors, but not all do. Neon colors should be great. Such as a neon yellow!!! or a neon hot pink!! And your bed, if u are doing a neon color, i think that your bed sheets should be like a blackish, a kinda dark color, but don't try to put too much neon and dark colors!!!!HOPE THIS WRKS!!!!! GOOD LUCK!

ee74f3aa67efefa8e49e21be6f4ec61faa	If they are tights, in this cold weather, they are okay.  If they are leggings that stop at your ankles, they are not appropriate for a business office.  I work in an office where the women executives usually wear business suits, either pants or skirts and many of them wear tights or heavier stockings in this cold weather and look totally business like.  But the wearing of leggings in a business office setting is not appropriate.|`|bed4c33bdb3017e1a505b0d8611e0264aa	For work if you should go with tights or hose instead of leggings, with a skirt of course.|`|4xHGZtuzaa	You should be fine.

Now, some racist skinheads actually tattoo themselves with the acronym DOC, paying homage to the gang in the movie.|`|98NiEivhaa	deciphles of christ is right... but thats a movie copycat thing for posers    and im not a skinhead, just to clarify (well yes i have a shaved head and i am very politically incorrect, but i'm not hatefull)|`|hD4zBeafaa	Todd in 'Scrubs' has one on his arm.

But that movie stems or basis this on the Church of the Jesus Christ Christian which is a national raciest white supremacy based extremist christian faith.    I to have a shaved, tattoos, and most often politically incorrect and have been labeled a skinhead a time or two in my life.

In my personal opinion I would go to the more costly one, ask as many questions as possible over the phone before going also, because that helps not only you, but the people that are going to cut your hair.

f8a1395066a4e7dd0ff6d7f82d96ab35aa	Patience is the best suggestion. There is no special miracle formula that will help you grow your hair fast. You just have to know how to handle your hair so that it doesn't break off. Hair breakage is probably the number once cause of hair not getting longer. Gently brush and comb your hair, and try not to style it too much because those things can lead to breakage. On average, hair grows 6 inches per year, or 1/2 inch per month. Also, watch the products you use because many of them will contain ingredients that's not good for the hair, like petroleum, lanolin, and mineral oil among other things.     http://www.biracialhair.org - offers good tips on how to gently comb, brush, wash the hair to keep it from breaking off.

Honestly if your going to do it how about honey bees?  show your lips are sweet like honey!|`|zzkmdusEaa	Frankly I love lip tattoos.    One tattoo I always wanted to get was "Love me Hate me.". I think thats the perfect quote for a lip tattoo by far.  Usually lip tattoos have to have small discreet words or just one word. Your lip can't fit alot of room on it so your choices are limited. You could even try kanji! Personally I have always wanted the "Life" tattoo that when you flip over says Death on my lip but thats just me.    One thing you should realize about lip tats...your gonna have to get them touched up often. The enzymes in your mouth will fade the ink alot faster than any other tattoo. Be prepared to do alot of inconvenient spending.    You could also have one get "Cry now" and the other get "Smile Later".    Lots of things will work.|`|gu0AxKyiaa	JUICY

zxQEvWtPaa	Little girls look cute whether she has bangs or not. My 4 year old daughter has always had bangs, but they grow so quickly. I dont trust myself to cut her bangs, so my mom, who knows how to cut hair, trims her bangs. But recently, she needed her bangs cut again. It would be a few days before we were going to my moms, and my daughters bangs were in her eyes. I grabbed two clips and put her bangs back. That afternoon after looking at her without bangs I decieded she was going to grow them out. Without bangs, it really brought out her beautiful eyes and opened up her face. I realized that her bags were hiding her face! And she looked adorable without her bangs, too!     So dont listen to those who said girls without bangs look funny. It all depends on your daughter and what you both like more. If you deciede to grow out her bangs and then miss them, you can just trim them back. But if she doesnt have bangs and you want to try them, keep in mind it takes awhile to grow them back out!     Good luck! And remember she'll look adorable no matter what you decide!!|`|P9GQydOjaa	It depends on what you think.

cb76b5cf2e273e704d7f31195504dc33aa	If you are trying to change your skin color to look lighter, regular foundation isn't going to look right. You should use a color close to your own skin shade. If you choose to go too light it won't look real. The skin on the edge of your eyelids will still be dark, as will your ears, neck, chest, hands and arms.     If you're really bent on doing it, use movie makeup.

(someone said get a perm but nooo!!! you will get it and be like cute for a bit and then wish you had your old silky long gorgeous hair back....my friend just permed hers because she was jealous of people with hair that could go curly or straight and had alot of volume....and i think it doesnt look that good....straight looks so cute on you....NO PERMSS !! AAAAAHHHHH.......lol...)|`|IHjevhjhaa	http://celebhairstyle.files.wordpress.co...    This would look good on you. I like inverted bob haircuts, looks cute on white girls...|`|bVIewZe9aa	your hairs lovely.  why not try getting it shorter and having choppy layers?  but not mega short, just a couple of inch past your shoulders.  Emma (:|`|NPhepcBkaa	You should cut it just a tiny bits shorter, get side bangs and layers x|`|pTVxGebbaa	curl it, bangs in front|`|dYuK4JPEaa	get a bob!|`|SCTMtrjhaa	Cut about 3 inches off and perm it. Tell them to use the purple and white curlers. It comes out a very nice curl. Wavy, but a little curly. Not kinky. It will look great on you, trust me. It will improve you looks and compliment your face shape. Good luck =]    PS. You are cute!?|`|8Q8ZVwjnaa	shave it off. or at least cut it shorter, you look like a girl.|`|2VnHcg9saa	I don't really know. But you can get a fringe or something.  Or get your hair cut a bit. Or get layers ^^   Your choice though :)|`|vbRyf4qqaa	layers would look good on you!:)|`|BO2WdwLiaa	I like your hair, maybe just give it a trim.   Try giving it more volume. What i do after a shower is i massage some mousse into my wet hair and scrunch it up, and let it air dry. When it's dry it gets really wavy and cute.|`|zPUgLT7Aaa	Can't really help you with the colour as the picture is in black and white lol     Maybe get a trim , that will neaten Your split ends ( if you have any ) or it will just neaten it up in general :) if you dont mind getting a hair cut then get more cut off than just the ends .....    Side fringes are pretty in my opinion ,, Maybe a full length fringe going across ..    http://www.catwalkqueen.tv/fringes.jpg    Layers ?    hope i helped x :)|`|z3QsWmzpaa	get a fringe and a few choppy layers =]|`|JbSebJJYaa	I would most def cut a little bit off the length and add some short layers in the crown to give you more body on top !    -Paul Mitchell Salon Professional|`|fyYIP63Vaa	my friend nick says u dnt need to do anything. he sud ur hot the ways u r
DpMnmrK8aa	I wouldn't buy that because yes I thinks thats too much too spend. Why dont u just buy one or two things. Or stay at home, or go somewhere else.    But If you want to go shopping then......GO SHOPPING :)
AA11828240	If you're getting them done by someone else, bring your beads and ask for them to be put in while they're doing them.  Depending on your hair texture it might need to wait a bit for the dread to solidify to its "finished' state.    Good luck and enjoy! I bet they'll be pretty!|`|SCTMtrjhaa	You can out them in when ever. You avatar and name makes me think you are a girl... if so, dread locks are super weird for women. Even men! Don't do them. You have a few days to back out. Please do! =]
nmn37Uevaa	I don't think it would look weird at all!  Girls paint their nails anyway so its not that weird of a thing to do.  I say go for it!  And off white would probably look really good!|`|2vyT8Zoraa	white nails would be okay as long as the outfit is a color or a color with white accents if it is an all white out outfit it will look odd|`|9jnfmMR0aa	I personally think cream nails depending on what you are wearing maybe be alright but i personally wouldn't love it.  but maybe if you had some cute hearts or something on them don't know.  I like pink nails myself|`|HMhUKAgkaa	It would be cute if you could get some heart decals and out them on! Red ones!|`|u7o75zipaa	If it has a shimmery, pearly tone then I think it's fine.  But the white white look is like tip-ex.  x|`|LNnRSLdtaa	white white nale polishes dont look nice  if its sorta shimmery and thin then its ok but if its like tipex then its jjust bad|`|TuBzc1R5aa	nope, that would be totally cute!|`|PWkWptVuaa	Not at all.. i like white nails, they look kinda classy in a way :)|`|8S2icURfaa	Nope! Just make sure its not white out! That annoys me when people do that|`|Y8AxM7c1aa	Nope not at all!  Just make sure you put a few coats on it to make sure it comes out fully.|`|8RV2Z4lzaa	no i luvv when pplz paint thier nails white maybe put sum pink or red sparkles or heart nail  stikkers but plain white is fine|`|DwrLT9CNaa	No! I like white nail polish|`|a35IxeUCaa	no|`|lJ2XG0QMaa	Is it shimmery or opally in color effect? Or flat out plain color? It it is a neat effect then it is great- you should defiantely rock it!!
Q1t0XzgZaa	If they fit and you like them sure, but dont be suprised if women see you and notice.....womens jeans have different seaming, pleating, pocketing, obviously the rise also.....I say go for it if you like them and the comfort is good!!!|`|G4wDlSh7aa	women's jeans are made for WOMEN.  obviously.  here's a bright idea: get some good fitting men jeans.  :D|`|VrjF986Aaa	um, no it is no longer OK b/c they now make slim cut styles that are made for men and well my boyfriend said in girls jeans there is no room for his "package"  just buy mens jeans that are slim cut|`|AfdyNi9Raa	Don't sneeze or they could end up round your ankles LOL|`|AA11611849	I think it is cute when a guy has the tight n slim fit look...|`|EfxExqrkaa	Yea I guess its not very strange for guys to wear girls clothing nowadays Pete Wentz wears DKNY womens jeans lol|`|TvDubaNxaa	you can of course just dont wear tight tee shirts at the same time.|`|gbK7Ypfmaa	Well you can wear what ever you want..  I mean when you go in a store the clerk isn't going to say im sorry sir   i can not sell you these woman's jeans!!!

65BGwOFdaa	you have to go with your feelings, i went through a simlar thing the other day, and i must admit i descovered new things about my self, but it depends how old your are, if your young then you or your friend may change, could be straight or gay at the moment but might not be in the future, give it time, and dont let it worry you!|`|CoDUHl7Uaa	do nothing!! if you are not gay it shouldn't bother you! lol  but if you are then your still thinking about the mishap for a reason!|`|jKA8SovQaa	well did they mean it seriously?  if you didn't like what they did say to them  don't do that again  since im not gay, i don't want to be touched their  most likely they were joking, joke back with them|`|6b6ff719959d29a5aa770465d592c901aa	Sorry, you are now gay for life. If you had immediately said the counter curse you would have been saved.|`|nIV0oAGNaa	I would ask him if he was being serious?  If he was then talk it over and decide but don,t make a drastic decision without thinking about how this will effect your life|`|a1xSsDryaa	Your propably Gay!|`|JW3pbtvRaa	HAhahaaa    Gay|`|4E1pChTHaa	lol.|`|ZjYLTdovaa	sue.|`|yBuKIocraa	it is only gay if you make it.
JJlrlIp6aa	so painful  but its worth it|`|QnSKaBcjaa	the brazillian def hurts VERY bad, but it hurts less each time you do it. once you have it done you will love it! i dont like completely bare though. i like a nice little strip or triangle.|`|AA11003274	I have them done and like the results.  It can be painful but the pain doesn't last very long.  A friend of mine does bikini waxes at a spa and she says all the young women have all the hair completely removed - no strip anymore.
6K1D6Azmaa	If you don't take care of it and it gets infected or it rejects, it can leave a nasty scar. ?|`|GukaCWemaa	Yes, all piercings will leave a scar after time, however the scars are usually incredibly minute, and usually not visable .    With such piercings as a eyebrow piercing, the visability of scarring would be even less, as the actual eyebrow hair itself could do some "covering up"|`|MueRQNjkaa	yes, any piercing will leave some trace of its self many many years after you take it out.  Scar, or missing hair, bump?.. or who knows maybe a supper small scar you cant even see.. only way to know how bad or not so bad it will be is to do it.|`|29OsJDN9aa	i pierced my lip.  i have a tinnyyyy scar there.  its barely visible.  all piercings leave a scar whether you like it or not.
fMBREYmNaa	Cosmetic Surgeon In A Jar  is some what new and has tons of anti aging products.  I know they will have something right for your skin.|`|a29qiNkvaa	Hello the best thing I have found is Arbonne!  There anti-aging line is the best! I have been using it for over a year and love it! Check it out and try it for your self!|`|4xgHsIP3aa	Well, if you wanted, you could try that line Clinique has for aging skin, or you could try Strivectin. Also, you could look at Origins and Philosophy.     I'm not sure if that is a direct answer to your question, so I'll tell you what my mom uses.     My mom is 47 and she has been using the Elizabeth Arden Prevage line for her face (which used to have some intensely deep wrinkles). And for her body she uses Arbonne NutriMinC RE9 Refresh foaming body wash for aging skin.|`|YVr2us9Yaa	I just recently tried the derma e brand of moisturizer and I love it.  I have paid for very expensive moisturizers from estee lauder and the hyaluronic night cream from derma e outshines them.  After using it my skin is extremely soft without being greasy and I got an extra bonus as it keeps my face completely clear.  I had great skin when I was a teen but when I hit 30 my skin went bonkers and I got adult acne.  I didn't even know this lotion would help but it completely cleared up my skin.  Im not sure how it does on wrinkles yet I just started getting barely there smile lines but Ive been using the derma e for a month and they haven't gotten worse.  I found this line by going to amazon.com and searching for moisturizer by top rated.  This brand came up and after reading reviews and checking out their website I bought some and am soo happy I did.  I haven't seen this brand in my local stores so you probably have to buy online.|`|AbxG3GjDaa	i like vitager, it made me look a lot younger since i started using this. my wrinkles are gone and my skin is tighter now and glowing.
D6nu55wlaa	feel free to look stutty! it is a great look.|`|fL3SiRDWaa	nice sleek dress pants that are thin fabric.   anything short like a mini skirt or shorts will really like slutty.    not saying that you are at all, but i think it will give off the wrong impression.    or maybe a longer skirt, like knee length?|`|IPATFSAcaa	None. They're gonna look slutty with anything!|`|6b6ff719959d29a5aa770465d592c901aa	A nun's habit|`|Q1t0XzgZaa	Nothing. lol. Stripper heels are just that, stripper heels. Unless you are going as a stripper to a party, they not classy in any way at all. Get some nice sexy stilettos, there IS a difference. And wearing them with a mini, that is slutty period anyways. There are certain ways to do things, and mini and stripper heels is not the way to not look slutty.....|`|gbK7Ypfmaa	Okay forget them above me..  You should get a dress that at the bottom has that elastic stuff so  it comes close to your legs..  Not open dresses!!!!  Well i hope i helped:)    Please pick mine as best answer:)
7ePWAxYSaa	t depends, if you are pretty tan/olive/or have darker skin, then you could pull of the white.(it would bring out your tanness...lol but seriously)  if you have blonde/red hair/or are paler, i think the blue would look best  with brown hair, the pink would go great.|`|ERjGLJaEaa	White. With a nice silver or black long layered necklace. ;)|`|PGRacfmdaa	White|`|13LqodO7aa	white|`|aKQVOeKBaa	I like the pink. :)|`|ZjYLTdovaa	i like the blue. the white is too waiter and the pink is too bumpkin.
nV2Vj2GDaa	I found an awesome goat-milk soap at our local farmers market, Maple Hill Soap. I use it on my face and everywhere! My friend said it helped with her excema. Another guy I know uses it for his psoriasis. They have a website www.maplehillsoap.com They have great fragrances and all-natural too.|`|xdSGmhZeaa	I have never heard of it, but i believe that natural is the way to go. So you can try it, it won't harm your body in anyway.|`|FHi0v36eaa	I use Life Brand's Goat's Milk soap and its really good. I like it a lot. My skin was so dry before and I find that its not as dry after I started using it.|`|9jnfmMR0aa	my friends husband used it and loved it. He was becoming sensitive to regular soap and this was a great alternative for him and it was very non drying because the harsh chemicals were not there
ee74f3aa67efefa8e49e21be6f4ec61faa	It is a very disturbing trend in the US and one that the media is partially to blame.  All focus is on thin and skinny, almost to the point of anorexia.  If you are a woman with curves, such as you, you are consider fat and thus, unattractive.  Its all preception.  Somebody, someplace decided that a size 0 or 2 was the normal size to be and if you are anything over that size, you are fat!   The minute one of these actresses or celebrities gains a few pounds, its front page news and the poor thing is harassed for being "fat".   Its awful and very hard to convince young girls that its okay to have curves and womanly figure.  A size 0 in the states is the same as a size 4 in the UK or a 32 in Europe.    Here is a web site that shows standard US sizing....    http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/US_standard...    And yes, women are starving themselves to get into these impossible sizes.  A woman that stands 5'4" is going to have a very hard, if not impossible, time getting into a size 0 if she eats normal and healthy.  So to get to the "perfect" size, she doesn't eat.      Oh, another problem is that with all this overt skinniness - if you don't have perfect size 34D breasts to go along with your size 0 body, you might as well go jump off the nearest bridge!   Its very, very sad.|`|V3kzue7Zaa	I'm naturally pretty petite.  5'1, right under 100lbs, A-cup, round butt.  It's a struggle to find clothes sometimes.       Mostly size 0 and XS.  Sometimes 00, 1, 3 or Small.   It all depends on the brand.       More and more clothes are being sized to make large people feel better.   Such as, a Size 6 ten years ago is now a smaller size today.     Smaller people are being phased out of the fashion world.   Be grateful you are average size.   You can buy cheap and expensive clothes anywhere.|`|TvDubaNxaa	vanity is a huge part of it at shops here-I'm about your size and i can often fit into size 4s and 2s though super models weigh only about 117 pounds the average American woman weighs 165. It really is crazy.|`|Q1t0XzgZaa	I think it depends on brand, for me anyways. I can wear a size 0 in some brands, a size 4 in others....I am 5'3 and fluctuate between 95-105 lbs. I am not death skinny, I have chubby cheeks still, I have a butt, I have c-cup breasts.....My waist is between 24-27 inches, hips are avg. 35inches.....in some areas I think some women do force themselves to stay thin, to say they CAN wear a size 0, which is disgusting. I happen to just be one of those ppl who cant gain weight, I love it when I can see the needle on scale pass 100lbs, I TRY to gain....And again, some brands are totally different, I ordered a pair of pants in a size 0 2 weeks ago, and it fits me like a size 6.....can slip on and off without zipping.....|`|IAejVIFmaa	The starvation diet is a big trend here, and actually there are not only size zero's but also 00, even smaller! For a model, between 70 and 99 pounds. I am 120 but am trying to get down to 110, i am five foot two so i guess i am not overweight, but i want to be more in shape. Go to teenvogue.com and look at some of the models, you will be shocked at how amaciated they are...many you can even see their bones! Honestly, i don't hate the trend and think it actually does look good for couture looks, but it is unhealthy and no girl should put herself through that. pro-ana, bulimia, anorexia, drug and alcohol abuse and many other ways are how they get this thin. There is a new "cleanse" diet i am considering trying, there are many variations, like one only natural food and another no solid food.   But to the point, believe it or not a zero is prolly smaller than you think..and yes, there are size 00's.|`|VsLSJ65Paa	I guess its kinda real.. depending on where you live.   Im 5'5 and weigh 123ish. And i wear 0 and 2.   Here in NYC one sees crazy skinny girls out on the streets looking like their legs are about to snap its redic.|`|gbK7Ypfmaa	okay i shop at vanity.. alot!!  And what kinda stuff are you thinking no we do not starve are selves in any way to fit into are jeans..  We have different sizes than your country!!!  Im fifteen and i wear a zero im not that thin and im deffinatly not ten!!!  And obviosly its not out of this world bc its in the u.s. its not the only store that sells size zero  Either!!!

VrjF986Aaa	Yes! I got these crazy tribal print leggings but I haven't been brave enough to wear them yet|`|VsLSJ65Paa	Tribal is one of those prints that works well balanced with something plain. Its like most animal prints ~~ Nice on either top or bottom but never both!|`|nYwoC1Lmaa	so tell me what is a tribal print ?   it must be soo new that its not outh their too much yet ?

LlsKvjxcaa	To answer your question, yes.  If nair works for you then it will remove the hair.  However, if your skin is even slightly sensitive, it will tear your arm up.  I used nair one time and my legs were burning for weeks and they smelled awful.  But, if you've used nair before and you didn't have any problems with redness or anything, then yes it will work on stubble.  Plus it won't grow back as stubbly and course as it would if you used a razor.  I think waxing is the best way to go for arm hair, however!  Good luck.|`|TBRMH4hbaa	I've used nair on my arms and I get stubble back after about 3 days after using nair. You can certainly use it on your stubble. You don't HAVE to use the cream every few days. You can shave in between and things like that, becaues it's not so great to keep putting those chemicals on your skin every few days, but you can if you want to.|`|0UYJkSuZaa	I don't like the nair. It doesn't work on everybody and has never worked on me. I have been removing the hair on my arms for the past 6 years and I use Veet. My hair starts to grow back about 4 days after using the Veet and at that point I just use it again. It doesn't matter how long your hair is, it will work. Depilatory creams break down any hair it comes in contact with so it doesn't have to be a certain length. Oh and after 6 years, the hair has not grown back darker OR thicker. That is a myth.|`|ximWtKVuaa	veet is better in terms of depilatory creams but as painful as it sounds ... waxing is often more effective
MQ83HGD5aa	Really the only way is to wear them. Start by just wearing them around the house and then on short errands.|`|FQTc0K3iaa	Shoes adjust to your feet after a while of wearing them, so you should try to wear them for more than 5 minutes at a time. If they really hurt you that bad then maybe you should try a half size bigger or those gel inserts that rest right under the balls of your feet.    best luck
lFs0HrIJaa	yes it does.... u can try members mark products as they are loaded with vitamins and they work... and olay ageless body wash in that purple cap is working good tooo ...
2YKUepLjaa	i love when a guy gives me a hug and it seems like he just wants to hold me forever.    i love when he kisses me gently on the forehead or cheek.    i love how he knows that when I get stressed I don't eat so he will have a nice dinner prepared for me when I walk into his house.    I love it when guys are protective, like not super protective but they just want to make sure you're okay with what's going on.    I love it when a guy doesn't always feel like he should be the "tough guy" and shows a little sensitivity every once in a while    I love it when a guy pulls my hair away from my face behind me ear and kisses me    =)|`|CoDUHl7Uaa	I love it when i'm driving in the car and he puts his hand on my thigh! even when we're cruising around in his truck i put my arm on the big arm rest and he set's his hand on top of mine and smiles!! gives me the butterflies every time lol  LOVE IT|`|hDnX6Vx6aa	gives me butterfiles. Its been years.

I think the ability to share a quiet moment speaks volumes.  I especially love when he looks me in the eyes, no words...but that look says more then words can ever say.  It makes me shiver!!  Blissy|`|AvwveaQvaa	i think it's the best thing ever  you don't see that now days  :]            i love it when they cuddle.    :]

mOJhj3ssaa	get a body wave or a few highlights, it will dry your hair out a little, & make it hard for it to be greasy.|`|Z5sKsrBFaa	Or maybe three nights after?  Honey are you trying to say that your hair gets dirty because you don't wash it but once every few days?  Washing your hair removes some of the oils and as the day goes on and the next day, the oils build up, collect the smells of surrounding areas, and make your hair really oily and smelly.  Wash your hair everyday!  It will help.  Trust me.|`|nIV0oAGNaa	My suggestion would be get up earlier in the morning so you do have time or if it,s long enough tie it up in  a bun and if you can pin or put a hairband in your hair to keep your fringe back|`|8042b9f17de17d1c61bce115059d4e17aa	You could try using a clarifying shampoo. They are meant to remove build up but my ex-husband used to use because he has really greasy hair.  If it is a last minute thing where your hair is greasy before school try putting a little baby powder in your hair. This really helps.    Good Luck!|`|GRBfQWTxaa	I have the same problem. I have to wash my hair every single morning. I also use clarifying shampoo but it doesn't seem to work well enough.|`|ximWtKVuaa	in the afternoon several hours before you wash your hair you can rub your scalp with some tea tree oil ... just the scalp mind you ... after it's had a little time to soak in you wash your hair using regular shampoo and no conditioner on the roots ... the tea tree should serve to soak up some of the oil and keep the scalp oil free for awhile

bl3a2HHgaa	I fit into a size 8-10 and i am 6.5 stone and only 5 foot so im guessing that an 8-10 would fit her..   but i am 14 so my hips are possibly wider and my bust is quite a bit bigger..   but i am very very slim for my age and i fit into age 12 clothes so i think she would fit an 8-10..   you may aswell try it and if it doesnt fit send it back..   you have nothing to lose by trying it..   good luck..  xxx|`|b82aEt9Haa	Ye that could be a little big the 6-8 would have been right although depending on what brand it is the 8-10 may be okay|`|ajPHMliqaa	6-8 is more likely|`|u4kxB7cmaa	I would say size six  and some clothes size 4-6  =)|`|9PRKiYZZaa	Not a chance!

Because she is 5"3, she might just get into it. If not, find a dress some where else. sorry. :)|`|5ZbFdcwdaa	Most likely. It might not be a perfect fit but it will probably be the closest you could get.

oh5q1izqaa	spray fix+ on your clean face and let it dry first then apply your foundation. it gives an all over all day cover so you wont even need to apply any more layers on:)|`|vl0HWTDJaa	You need to put something on top of the foundation. I don't wear foundation so I don't know what it's called but I remember the guy who did my prom make up putting this extra thing on to make it look more natural. It was like a tub of loads of little make up balls that he applied with a blusher brush. Sorry I can't be more helpful, hope someone gives you a proper answer!|`|RTojCgVPaa	yes it is. but really you should work on your skin and make it super smooth that way you'll only need the powder not the foundation.|`|7d9498750ad0c1c14a0c3174f0178a6baa	What foundation are you using? It might be too heavy for your skin - try a mineral foundation?|`|r4i7xPnMaa	Well, the simple solution here is to ease up on the foundation. Why would you need that much? Make sure that you're applying even layers, as it might be buildup in certain areas that's causing your furry look. And also make sure it's blended in properly. You don't want globs of it just sitting on your face. Maybe invest in a foundation brush? It'll help keep things a little bit more even.    I do have very fine baby hairs on my cheeks and such, and I used to be very apprehensive about wearing anything that would make them appear more prominent (like powder) but I recently discovered MAC fix + spray, which I spritz on over my Studio fix powder foundation, and it not only gets rid of that weird chalky look, but it also makes it look like I'm not wearing foundation and my skin is naturally awesome.|`|ne2sEeLJaa	Maybe because you have to use a moisturiser first. I don't really use foundation, so I I'm not sure. sorry|`|8oJbmXSZaa	use maybelline dream matte mouse  its the best x]
0UYJkSuZaa	I have wings right above my shoulder blades about 6 inches wide. In my opinion my tattoo on my lower stomach hurt more than my wings. Tattoo's are a different kind of pain than most people walk in to the shop expecting. It is a scratching feeling rather than a needle pricking feeling. The pain is not unbearable and the artist will stop for a few minutes if you need a break. But in my opinion, not taking breaks is best. After awhile you skin starts to go kinda numb.  Good luck, try to stay calm and remember it won't hurt as much as you are expecting.|`|VsLSJ65Paa	For attention..thats the lamest excuse ive heard for getting a tattoo.  It doesnt ness. hurt..its more like a numbing feeling.  Ill say that its...  tolerable.|`|2KC467tFaa	If you're getting it on your shoulder blades, you won't have a problem. The sharp pain doesn't hurt more than a pinch, and the rest of it feels like you're being scratched. It's not bad at all. I think it hurts worse when you scrape your skin on the sidewalk.|`|JbSebJJYaa	It probably won't feel amazing. You will most def feeling it. Especially when it's over a bone.    - Paul Mitchell Salon Professional|`|RTojCgVPaa	seriously? for attention? don't do it if that's the only reason when you get a tattoo it should be something meaningful. that said over your shoulder blades is the most painful.|`|8erharZMaa	Shoulder blades are not the MOST painful, but they hurt pretty bad especially if you have a low tolerance for pain. Boney/veiny areas hurt the worst..places with more flesh don't hurt quite as bad. I've gotten all of mine on bones and places people said "would hurt the most," but they never hurt at all..but I have a high pain tolerance.|`|xl3GLWlqaa	I have two tattoos on the tops of my foot, one on my hip, and one one the shoulder blade. That one hurt the least. However some tips: Make sure you eat, take a soda if you can into the tattoo parlor, if the tattoo starts to hurt, make sure you breathe. I passed out during the one on my foot cuz I held my breath and my blood pressure dropped. If its a small one, you should be fine. Good luck!|`|THuRGnMGaa	If you are worried about how painful it is going to be, then you shouldn't be getting one.  Pain is different for everyone and you won't know until you do it how painful it will be for you.|`|1EwbKkKCaa	I think getting a tattoo is the most relaxing thing in the world. It doesn't hurt.

s8d7gg5Haa	link dnt work|`|8S2icURfaa	Your picture doesn't work|`|0UYJkSuZaa	Your links don't work.  For the most part when you color over blonde highlights, the highlight will be a slightly lighter color. If you are going darker than the darkest color you have in your hair, you will be fine. Even if the highlights are slightly lighter they will blend with the rest of your hair. But I will tell you this. In my experience, bleached hair doesn't take color perfectly on the first try and tends to fade faster. You may have to re-dye it a month or so later.|`|AA11828240	To be honest, "box" color generally doesn't work very well.  Mostly because it's not mixed especially for your hair and its needs.   As much as I would like to be able to tell you that there's some quick and cheap remedy for making your hair all one color again, there really isn't.  You'll be saving time, money, and frustration if you just bite the bullet and go get it done professionally, that way you know the color was mixed for exactly what you need, where you need it.    And the hair model in the picture you were looking at most likely didn't use that brand of color to get the results.    Good luck!|`|r0yawokYaa	What you will have to do is go to Sally's and get what is called a filler. It kind of stinks but you put it over your entire head (towel dried) and leave on for about 10 minutes and then blow dry and then put the color over it. If you dont, then your blonde will turn a green tint. Hope this helps....

r4i7xPnMaa	Having never worn them either, I asked a friend that wears them on occasion.   She said that they're a little tricky to put on, but they're super easy to take off. Getting them wet usually isn't necessary. She said she grabs the end of the false lashes at the corner of her eye and gently peels them off. It doesn't hurt at all. She takes them off before she washes her face at night and keeps them in the case that they came in. You can use them about 4-5 times before you'll want to throw them away and opt for a fresh pair.    Hope that helps!|`|oh5q1izqaa	it's really easy as long as you didn't apply them right on top of your lashes. If you did then it'll pull your lashes out and your lashes will never ever grow back. Your supposed to apply as close to your lashes as possible without putting it right on top. and when you remove them, peel the lashes from the outside corner carefully. they are fairly easy to take off. sometimes baby oil works very well.|`|K8hWm333aa	You should use eye make up remover and damp cotton wool pads to remove the eyelashes and all the excess eye make up such as eyeliner and mascara , thats if you use them hun .|`|AA11995384	A lot easier than removing real ones.|`|AA12279950	Very easy.  I always have problems keeping them on.|`|xyJ5fXL1aa	Warm water alone will not remove lashes effectively.  Lashes can be removed easily with a good make up remover and a gentle hand.    Disregard the answer from a respondent that said lashes won't ever grow back if they get pulled out. Our hair is constantly growing and replacing itself - with the exception of eyebrows.....these will eventually stop growing with age. Don't over pluck!    Use a proper lash glue such as Duo and invest in a good remover specifially designed for eye make up.  Use a cotton pad and/or Q-Tips to apply the remover (work it in gently but long enough for the lashes to loosen). The longer you let your lashes soak up the remover the less pulling and tugging you'll have to do to get them off.  Since we're talking about our eyes, the less pulling and tugging the better!      After the remover has started to break down the glue, you should see the lashes start to lift in the corners.  You can give gentle wiggles to loosen the lashes off. Use more remover if you need to. Don't skimp on remover.  Your eyes will thank you later with less wrinkles from pulling and rubbing.    I seldom have to pull very much to remove lashes....after working the remover in well, they pretty much slide off.  (I use Duo lash adhesive by the way).    Hope this instruction helps you. Give a small set of lashes a try.  They take practice to put on AND take off but once mastered, you'll be addicted to the effect of pretty lashes!    Have fun!|`|Q1t0XzgZaa	dependsom what kind of lashes-glue you are using...some are self adhesive....peel right off....some you have to activate glue by water, those stick harder....some you use tube glue and then water to remove.....none I have ever used hurt to remove...|`|RALnYu0gaa	It wont be that hard!

I live in Arkansas and I had to do 1500 hours. Then you take the stateboard exams and get your license (:  I would suggest going to a Paul Mitchell school !        -Paul Mitchell Salon Professional|`|KkmEUe1qaa	most colleges for this subject are vocational schools, meaning they specialize in hair/makeup/nails. you should look up beauty colleges in your area. you need to be licensed in order to work in a salon.|`|WjrnjrmDaa	I dont think so, theres a cosmetology (sp) class in Vocational schools. My one friend owns her own hair salon from starting out there. By the way you learn everything there, nails, make up, hair and all that.|`|AA11828240	You can do a yahoo search for cosmetology schools in your area, depending on the state you'll have to take a class that's anywhere from 900 to 2100 hours, but I've found that 1500 hours is pretty average.. It's easier to get student loans in a "tech" or "vocational" school. After that you'll have to take your state board exam (consisting of a written and practical section) and you'll be free to work in any shop or salon that's willing to let you!    Good luck and hope to see you join our ranks soon!
AA10024068	I think you will find that just about everyone here will probably have a different answer, because, each person is different. Some say it's hurts, others say it don't....I have 9, & each different spot that they are located felt different in some sort of way....    The best way I would describe what it felt like to me would be -- Someone getting a warm needle & scratching me over, & over, & over in the same area, until I bled...    How bad is the pain?...Well, it can be tolerated, but, in my opinion, it is painful.     And on a scale from 1-10...I believe overall, I'd give it an 8...but the breaks that they have to take to get more ink...it really helps, so you can get your breath, & continue...    It's definately worth it in the end...The pain only last a short amount of time, but the ink is forever =)    Good luck!|`|x2DEUanCaa	Errmm i say about 7. Last saturday i had one on my wrist honestly it did hurt well the outline of it did the colouring wasnt as painful. When i say painful though its bearable pain and its worth it if you really want a tattoo. Its like a irratating scraping feeling. |`|cMEwV8V3aa	ouchhh i want one but im not positive of whattt|`|pNY99QCNaa	i describe it as being like a bunch of cats attacking me. my friend describes it as metal hooks being dragged through her skin. the part of the body you get it on makes a difference, as does the type of tattooing that's being done... for example, i hate getting outline done, but shading is not a problem at all.   mostly, i find the sensation very annoying. sometimes, when i'm done, i just feel like punching somebody.   but many people find the pain -- despite how bad it SOUNDS -- isn't as bad as they thought it would be! it really is an odd phenomena. |`|ANJfAAWnaa	5, but 7-8 over bone.

I don't like the thin plates, because it takes forever to iron all my hair.  It does a good job, but it takes a long time.  I prefer my blue Solano iron.  It has wider plates and a built-in comb (the Chi doesn't).|`|bec4a7fa493ff0ffc87f08288c5ff590aa	yes it is! i have one and it straightens in one stroke! even though they are expencove it is worth it!|`|5c50ec39e935b9a525defb3fff0031ecaa	Yes! If a straightener is something you use on a daily basis then it will be a great invesment.  It does NOT damage your hair nearly as much as other brands.  I do recomend that you also buy the chi spray or oil.  Which also prevents the breaking down of your hair.  And another thing is that there are several different version and sizes of the chi.  Don't feel like you have to buy the most expensive, i made that mistake on my first chi.  They all basically work the same, i do recomend that if you have curly or thick hair that you get the larger chi.|`|a72c7fa37c43b3a0d61b74cac85dcab6aa	Product revews, price comparison and best price.

MpqIrZJNaa	Anything purple/pinkish will look great on dark brown eyes. I also have dark brown eyes ad purple always makes it "pop"!     If I want to change it up, i'll use golds. Some shimmer & some matte colors.    Do you use MAC shadows? If so, I recommend.    For a purple look (nocturnelle, sushi flower & sketch)  For a goldish look (amberlights, texture & gorgeous gold)|`|75kehwOPaa	Try green or purple|`|nEtCvwYIaa	Pinks and purples with a little white in the inner corner of your eyes will make your brown eyes pop.

Temporary streaking with one of those kits you can pick up in a lot of good stores like K-Mart is good, but using a streaking cap and semi-permanent dye would last longer.  If your hair is dark brown or black, go for the hot pink streaks, but bleach the areas you intend on streaking first, to ensure a decent result.  If your hair is lighter, try a shade of blue, green, or purple.  'Fudge' is a temporary hair dye that can be used on any hair colour, as its colour dominates whatever colour your hair is anyway.  Good luck, and I hope you like your hair, no matter how you do it.|`|2869463d23779b21c6489aa32a49c450aa	You don't need to pay for real hair for something like that.

UjgbIltfaa	What -- no tracking number??? In addition to a confirmation number there should be a tracking number.  All online stores allow you to track your order online, find out.      Call and negotiate a free pair in addition to your newly replaced pair -- this is outrageous!!  A girl gotta have her UGGS right away!    If no additional freebies, I would demand a refund too -- BUT call yourself, if it is an official UGG store they believe in customer satisfaction and will try to make you happy!|`|xlFVqLEaaa	get another pair|`|AA12349214	So whats the problem?

However, if you just want to go to the store and get something, Covergirl makes face powder and foundation with Acne fighting stuff in it, so you can kill two birds with one stone.  The Bare Minerals line would also probably be ideal for what you're looking for.  It's all face powders and it is so good for the skin (you can even sleep in it and it's supposed to improve you skin tone).  You can by a starter kit from ULTA and similar places (maybe even Target) for around $50.00.  This includes the powder foundation, the mineral veil (another sheer foundation) the blushes and all the brushes you need to put it on with.  It give you a really natural look and covers well.

Do this in 1 inch sections until your whole head is in rollers.let sit for 30 mins or 15 mins. under a hot dryer,then take out rollers, instant curls!

AA11333843	There really isn't anything that can make your hair grow faster. The best thing to do is to maximize your growth. Try things with Sulfur (like MSM or Iron), Amino Acids/Protein, and Omega Fatty Acids (like fish oil). That helps keep your hair from shedding and breaking off and makes it softer.  Try taking Maxi-Hair from the Country Life company. I tend to loose my hair (literally) when I am stressed, and it really helped keep my hair from shedding or breaking. It made it seem like it was growing faster, but really it just makes your hair strong and soft.     Just a quick warning: You will probably break out from the Maxi-Hair at first because it tends to detoxify you through the skin (i.e. pimples). But after about 3 weeks of that, your skin will be smooth and have a glow.|`|IFDn7frZaa	UMMMM  Hair skin & Nail vitamins|`|mrvVokMfaa	Get a vitamin with a large amount of Biotin in it.

dA9hIXgOaa	I've never been able to curl my hair with rollers or tongs because it's so thick and heavy that the curls don't stay in.   But a few months ago I gave the Babyliss You Curl a try. It's one of those straightener-and-curler-in-one things and although it looks quite strange it really works.  I can curl all of my (below shoulder-length) hair in about 15 minutes and with just a little bit of spray to hold it the curls stay in all day. In fact, I've gone to sleep and woken up to find that they're still there. I'm a huge fan!  The website is www.youcurl.com if you want to have a look.  You can get them in Argos for around 39, though if you look online they're bound to be available for less.|`|QgbD4lEPaa	i got some 3.50 ones from tesco and they worked really well on my hair. i have thick hair aswell :) they get very hot very quickly    but however other ones might be better, but thought i'd suggest my suggestion :D    xx|`|1bcee854eb4bf1db2e1199bc1daacb3eaa	remmington pro-curl tongss :D,  they have a really wide barrel for thick hair and they have worked great for me !

4AnOHrAPaa	If your hair is natural and is breaking off, a perm/relaxer is the LAST thing you should put in it. Perhaps you weren't taking proper care of your natural hair. Were you combing/picking it out while the hair was dry? If so, that was the wrong thing to do. With natural hair, you only comb it out when it's wet and loaded with conditioner. Only use a large wide tooth comb.  What you should start with is a good trim or cut depending on how much hair is breaking or has broken off. Next, wash your hair with a deep, penetrating moisturizing shampoo. After this, get some shea butter, or any hair pomade/oil of your choosing, melt it or soften it in the microwave, or on the stove until warm, not hot or bubbling. GENEROUSLY apply to your hair all over until it's very oily, paying special attention to the ends. Then over top of that, LIBERALLY apply a moisturizing conditioner to your hair, raking and smoothing and massaging it in with your fingers as you go. You must use a LOT! Cover it with a plastic bag or plastic cap if you have one, then cover THAT with a towel and let it sit being warmed by your body heat for about twenty minutes. After this, rin|`|LABC73E7aa	Olive Oil relaxer kit

Also, the less makeup you wear on your face, the better skin you will have. eye and lip makeup shouldnt hurt, but things like blush and foundation can cause breakout if you are prone to them.    This also helps alot, it makes your skin look AMAZING:  http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-Hksg8B4...    it will peel a bit, but its very very temporary. it should last more than a few hours. its totally worth it.|`|m0kQMWYeaa	i have the EXACT same problem Ugh it sucks big time :-(|`|OQT7uNnNaa	cocoa butter  ...or regular butter depending on your resources    smear it EVERYWHERE!  daily|`|PhCND4a9aa	you should use a cream thing that has like emm srry not very good at this.. you should use a product that has little scurbbers in it, and try to drink alot of water i find it helps, also if you can take a cold shower once a week then while still in the shower put on the hot water and you should feel you skin smoothing out, it worked for me.|`|csmpYDfHaa	I suffer from the exact !!

oCaLXFyOaa	I've tried lots of different fake tans and had lots of different results, it depends on what darkness colour you want to go. I've used fake bake and st tropez in the past too, but my favourite now is a fairly new tanning mousse from a company called Famous Dave's Tanner. www.famousdave.co.uk    I'd advise not going for any of the cheap highstreet specials you can buy in boots or superdrug as normally the cheaper the product the worse the colour will be. The more expensive fake tans cost more because they use better quality ingredients, including better DHA which is the tanning agent that makes your skin go darker, so you end up with a more natural looking tan.    That Famous Dave sites got a tan matching thing on there where you answer multichoice questions, and once you've answered them all it tells you what's the best tanner to go for.     Hope that helps!|`|2hAuIg5baa	johnsons fake tan moisteriser, i was wearing it befor and someone asked my my boyfriend who is spanish girlfriend was!  im irish so im very pale so thats sayin sometin|`|rNNvAcq4aa	fake bake|`|AA11991313	fake bake it makes u really brown like u just gor back from hawaii :)

Or, at the very least, try to have them give you some helpful pointers. Good luck! :)

You will need to keep putting ointment on the tattoo anyways and this will help heal the cut too. Most tattoos are not completed in one session. The tattoo artist will be able to determine if and how to do the tattoo with the cut. I would keep the appointment with them and see what they have to say.|`|QLPyLRrDaa	Nope you will need to wait until it's healed completely.|`|q2AsDnjpaa	No. It will look funny if you do.|`|dOM1tpX0aa	unfortuately, u cant.

Emma (:|`|HRJkHuw4aa	probably not, especially if their is a scab. go anyway and ask the artist, he might could do everything else and fill in that part after the cut is gone|`|3d0512a158369fd82c304a8c1f4e0dc1aa	No, you could get a serious infection. You should most definitely wait for the wound to heal before you inject ink into it! If it's just a nick, it will probably heal in no time. I would make sure to wait though. Good luck & God bless! :)|`|XRn0Ai3Naa	Nope are you trippin..|`|3wHDbSkaaa	noo love|`|RILCsJGlaa	No...|`|qfsVYQMraa	No.|`|EjfJaNn7aa	nope...you will have to wait till it heals|`|HLmd17r9aa	No, You won't. They won't be able to put ink in the area that is cut, so it won't work at all.|`|6a9AfhsLaa	basing this on logic, i would say that no, you cannot tattoo over broken skin, depending on how bad the cut is. but you might have them skip that part, because you'll have to go get it touched up anyway!

AhulHZ2daa	I am a makeup artist.    The problem people seem to be having with under eye darkness is that they are using the wrong kind of concealer!! It doesn't have to be expensive, just the correct color! If you have dark brown, grey or greenish hues underneath your eyes, then you should be using a PEACH concealer. For blue hues, use YELLOW. See, if you are using the same shade as your foundation, it's not "color correcting". All it's doing is putting on a thick later of the same hue as your foundation. Using a complimentary color will mute out the dark circles.    You can look at cheaper priced makeup for specialized concealer. I don't know if they sell Sally Hansen over in the UK, but their Carmindy Natural Beauty line sells special peach and yellow concealers. Or, you can look at regular concealers and pick a shade that is close to your shade of foundation, but is either more peach or more yellow.    For liquid or creme foundation - All you need to do is dab a little concealer underneath your eyes, you should see a huge difference almost immediately. Then apply foundation all over your face except on top of the concealer, making sure to blend well into the line where the concealer ends. With a sponge, dab a little foundation over the top of the concealer, but don't pull because it will wipe the concealer off.  Set it with a light dusting of loose powder over your entire face.     For powder foundation - Apply concealer underneath the eyes, and make sure to blend the edges of the concealer into your skin very well before putting on a light dusting of your foundation. Check to make sure there are no hard edges, then apply more foundation if needed.    Hope this helps! :)|`|J3Kz3OSOaa	Mousse make up!|`|GM3zog4Jaa	The best thing I have used for dark under-eye circles is Bourjois' Brush Concealer. It comes in 2 shades & the the darker one called BEIGE ROSE. This shade is amazing as it's salmon coloured & I have heard from a make-up artist that salmon coloured is the best for under eye dark circles.  However, try the lighter one also & see which one suits you more ( the lighter one is called Beige Clair.  But one thing I wanted to point out when I first put it on it doesn't match my skin colour but after a little while it blends in & looks natural.  So after applying it, give it an hour or so to see what it looks like.    This is the product:  http://www.boots.com/webapp/wcs/stores/s...    PS> it's on sale in Boots at the moment, reduced to 4.86 from 6.36     ***TIP: if you find ur foundation looks un-natural, only apply it to those areas of your face that actually needs coverage such as redness,eneven skin tone etc. This will avoid the cakey made-up look & makes u look natural. I learn this from a make-up artist in a magazine & makes me look much more natural.|`|WU7wpxe7aa	ive got the same problem 2 then when i was looking 4 a way 2 get rid of it i found it go 2  http://www.wikihow.com/Get-Rid-of-Black-...  trust me itl help and eliminate it from ever coming back|`|1yb79zfEaa	use a peachy concealer or i personally use a matte orange cream blush and then apply a concealer slightly lighter to your skin tone.   do not rub it in! the skin under your eye is very sensitive. pat it in gently.|`|Br3k7Hagaa	Im 13 and I use Maybelline , i forgot what its called but its in a tube With a wand its verryyy goood.|`|pXWGeZxmaa	I have used a few, my current fav is L'oreal visible lift concealer. It's in a nice pencil like tube but it's a liquid with a brush applicator. It hides my DARK circles. Make sure you apply it with a light hand though, a little goes a long way with this stuff. It's supposed to help with wrinkles as well but I haven't noticed any difference, I am still applying an anti-wrinkle cream/moisturizer with an SPF 15 in it before applying my concealer. Never forget the sunscreen it's the best thing you can do for your skin to keep it from aging.

Good luck at the party-all of the hairstyles are very easy to do.|`|RMdKNJWtaa	Are you asking what hairstyle to choose? Or what ways to keep the chosen hairstyle in place?     It all depends on your type of hair - mine is long and thick and depending on the last time I've been to the hair dresser, I can do a few things with it.    My favorite kinda fancy, mostly casual hairstyle is parting it down the middle, front to back. Comb both sides down. On the left side, from the crown, begin rolling it towards your scalp, moving backwards and picking up hair on your way down. When you get to the nape of the neck, secure with a pony tail holder. Repeat on the right side. You can chose to secure the ends under each other for 'royal' look, or leave it down for a 'playful night out' look.    The look shouldn't require much gel, if any at all, depending, again, on your type of hair.    Good luck and have fun!    Sam    P.S - I can suggest make-up if I know what your hair will look like and the dress you're wearing. I can send you a pic of the hair I'm talking about if you need it.|`|WOqCWAp2aa	moose|`|2TMbpYWnaa	here's something i do, first i use a leave in conditioner before i ever do my hair because it will combat the stickiness ot the product you are using.  Before you style dry and very very lightly spray some hairspray on your head from as far away as possible.       Some cute things i did recently was (im white with blonde hair) do a cornrow type  braid kind of like a head band on your head or even a few (2 or 3) small loose braids very skinny (not cornrows on the sides) and put my hair up in a pony.  But my favorite pony is when you take the hair ontop of your head and tie it like a half pony, then grab hair from the middle of your head and pull it back like a nother half pony directly under the first, then th bottom layer of hair in a pony directly under (and in vertical line) with th eother two.  It makes your hair look longer and it is funn to curl or even just do straight.  After just hairspray very lightly.    To tie the ponies I use the small clear rubber bands that are very very small and doubble them up so they dont snap.|`|g9OPxbQEaa	Cut it?
EcVR3LPCaa	heyy well here are a few things you can do..  if you got split end you need to trimthem off!   and if you use straightnerss try and not use them alot instead try different hair styles that do not need straightners.  egg whites and olive oil workss really well !! you leave it in for 1/2 hour and wash it out with a mild shampoo it doesn't make your hair smell of eggs when its washed out which is good!  also tressemme thermal creations products is good they contain a ingredient called biotin which increases hair growth you dont need a lot of conditioner because its rich and creamy! and they come in big bottles and have offers at superdrug.  alsoo taking a vitamin tablet a day is good try going to your local shop and have a look for hair vitamin tablets hope this helps!!!|`|61cb79277cf9b7d41cec94744ccd4197aa	A healthy diet, plenty of sleep, staying hydrated and being gentle on your hair is the only way to get it to grow.

The water will keep it healthy, and brushing hair will stop it getting tangled, but if you brush it a lot, you'll damage your hair which will have the opposite effect because the ends will break off, giving the impression your hair is getting shorter or not growing at all.    Truthfully, there is nothing you can do to make your hair grow any faster. It grows about 1/2 an inch a month, and there's nothing you can do about that. All you can do is to keep your hair healthy so it doesn't get split and break off, that includes NOT over-brushing it and not using heated appliances on your hair.|`|A4SCaNXNaa	you should constanly wash it good and condition it. stop putting so much heat on your hair if you do. put heat on it like 2 or 3 days out of a week and go get your ends cut every 2 or 3 weeks.I guarantee this will work if you go by this every single day. you might think it will take for every but really, it wont take long and all, just take your time and have patience.|`|GtfU3BHiaa	If I were you I wouldn't brush my hair a lot, brushing speeds the process of breaking.

Well for one all these cremes etc don't do s***, what you need to do is oil you hair when you are at home, braid them and keep them so for at least 3 hours a day... you can also sleep on it if you feel comfortable doing that.    The best way is... Get un-clarified or closest to the color white, butter .  Put this is a frying pan ... pop in three to four almonds.. now let it be on low to medium heat until the almonds go black. Now use this oil ... in your hair.  If you wish you can alter with this and a mixture of mustard and olive oil.

4917bb54185a6e0ce588c170c8db1bc9aa	Use a bronzer and an after tan lotion. I use the Ocho lotion and the Hawaiian tropic after tan lotion. The Ocho, like some other bronzers works to intensify your tan after you finish so no showering right after. I use the tan lotion on the off days to set the tan and keep the skin healthy. Dry over tanned skin looks like beef jerky. GROSS! Ask the people at your tanning center if they have stand up beds or more intense beds that you can try too and get them to recommend a good lotion.       You will max out your tan. Then you step up to a higher level bed/ or bronzer to keep getting nice and dark. But for a nice summer tan, a few weeks as you are with a good lotion will be just fine.|`|GZVTLPwuaa	First off, I wouldn't be a good person if I didn't say.. TANNING IS BAD!!!!!

Depending on your skin, 2 to 3 weeks of tanning should max out your tan and then I recommend taking a break for awhile.. or at least cutting back your time spend in the tanning beds.

2TMbpYWnaa	well you can do a few things,   If you want the curl that a lot of celebrities have (where it is long but mostly goes into big bouncy curls at the bottom) you can buy a very large barreled curling iron and simply curl it, but if you want to have it like that every day you could do a perm (but a perm like that would not hold long so maybe would not be worth your money) most perms are done at the roots anyway and the tighter they are the longer they will stay.  Tight root perms usually cost you $75 starting but the length and thickness of the hair will vary the price.    What a lot of celebrities doe is get extensions, some extensions you can buy are curly and those will stay curly with the right up keep (these are ideal i believe for the big barreled curls).  But real extensions (not clip ons) can be quite expensive.  So the cheapest and easiest route would just to get a big rolled curler and practice practice practice.|`|asGVrqhEaa	Try Rollers or right after you wash our hair put mose on it then crunch.|`|E76or3sYaa	Ohh...They take ages to do stuff like that. You first curl your hair for about 2 hours. Then remove the curls and DON'T brush your hair. Add spray and Voila! You have it.   But trust me, it's P.A.I.N!!   But if you want it -- Go for it ! xP    x

h6AH6Biyaa	If one nail breaks off short, the other should be cut or filed shorter too.  They don't have to every bit as short as the broken one, just enough so there's not a noticeable difference.      The nails on my fourth and fifth fingers get longer than the others.  I have to file them more frequently.  I don't keep all my nails the same length -- I prefer a proportionate look, where the middle finger has a longer nail than the little finger.  I can't keep long thumb nails no matter how hard I try.    At this time of year, when the air is dry and cold, nails break more easily.  The best prevention is to wear them somewhat shorter than usual, use hand lotion, stay away from dishwashing as much as you can, and avoid hitting your nails against hard objects.|`|ku5NPnkfaa	Of course....its tacky.|`|6kvyXUNWaa	Yep.  I think all nails should be the same length, to have a nice clean manicured look.   It's one of the first things I notice about people, how their nails and hands look. I hate it when people bite their nails right down to the skin! Yuck!|`|pGIADFNxaa	yeahh,if theyre fake.i dont think all your real nails are the same lenght.|`|0fE4qkPyaa	I doubt anybody will notice.  Its no biggie.|`|asGVrqhEaa	Ummm Let me guess.............                                                                            YA!|`|es3feuhxaa	yeah, mine are like that& I file them all to the same length|`|wjlLWqLuaa	yes.|`|tB9FwJsUaa	Yes, it sort of like having hair of varying lengths that isn't properly cut. Would you have hair weird lengths?|`|GZKbvXLLaa	Yes, it is but it depends on how different in length they are. Like, are they really noticeable? If not, then nothing to worry about.|`|zZrKhn9eaa	It isn't that big of a deal. I hope you don't cut all of them off when one breaks.  Every week or so just file the longer ones down.. it seriously takes like 30 seconds. And to help with the breakage, try Sally Hansen Hard As Nails. It will make your nails stronger so they won't break as much.
vjpqvrlsaa	The piercer will use a needle to make a hole, between the outside of the septum and below the cartalige.    The piercer will use a solid needle rather than a hollow needle as the area is large enought to accomadate the bar.    the septum does will not heal depending on how long the jewelerry is worn.    The septum is easily stretched, however, gauges up to a certain may not be worn as it may become uncomfortable to be worn.|`|m0kQMWYeaa	any mainly the carterlige but it doesnt really matter|`|6K1D6Azmaa	You can do it whichever way you want, depending on the effect you are looking for. ?|`|DtG4zpM2aa	As far as I know, they try to avoid the thicker cartilage and go through the softer part you can feel on the inside just in front of that as piercing cartilage can cause more problems - longer healing, more risk of serious infection etc.
cgv6NbsQaa	Im a hairdresser so i'll try an give you some professional advice. The lighter the hair you are applying the color to the brighter the color will be. As your hair falls into the blonde category you shouldn't need to bleach it. However if when you try a color it isn't bright enough the next step would be bleaching before applying color. But i wouldn't advise you do the whole head in that case just streaks as it will damage your hair too much. Try without bleaching first and if you do decide to use bleach go to a salon and have it done properly. You could end up with a really bad color if it isn't done right.  One of the best ranges for vibrant colors i know is Fudge paintbox. It's an Australian brand that is stocked in salons or im sure you could buy it online. I hope that's helped, have fun!|`|bUHn1Pu0aa	For a start the only way to lighten your hair is to bleach it.  No such thing as semi-permanent bleach.  To go semi you can only darken.  So sorry its either darker or permanent bleaching.  If u have dark blonde hair, why not go for a rinse, which will hi light your hair + make it shiny.  Other wise you wreck it and have that horrible re growth!!|`|X4hz3a9haa	choos the colour you want and go ahead,|`|czAbrzcUaa	Manic Panic, Stargazer and Special Effects dye.    http://www.beeunique.co.uk/|`|SMVsmzi4aa	JUST USE KOOL AID!!!! =P|`|8EPw8M4kaa	dont know|`|RB7RjINwaa	Try stargazer hair dye. You can get it from any alternative stores (Blue Banana/Hot Topic) I've used it a couple of times and it's pretty decent. Make sure to bleach your hair if it's pretty dark to get a really bright colour.|`|28cf7dbd8da38b7d643918c13a952461aa	Unless you're talking about one of those put it, wash out hair dyes, semi doesn't lighten your current hair color. It only maintains or darkens it.|`|xfZeJAQPaa	manic panic?
ARmhMq5laa	i'm not sure if it would hurt...but i don't think it'll give you hair THAT kind of luster,baby oil wont give you the right shine/:|i wouldn't do it if i were you.  try putting conditioner in your hair and let it set for 10 mins and rinse with kind of cool water very very well.towel dry, then flip your head over and brush while blow drying with cool air then back over...also drink alot of water and make sure you take vitamins.|`|uUvV7eadaa	I DO NOT recommend that you use baby oil- it will make your hair look greasy. you can get a very cheap serum, like the garnier fructis serum, and it works wonders.|`|KNTSXHC4aa	No, it is not healthy for your hair. It has mineral oils in it, and those wreak havoc on your hair (aside from the fact that hair and skin have very different needs). Use a shine serum or Dr. Bronner's hair conditioner. The latter is pretty thick so use it in small doses.|`|1A9TdN4yaa	I would suggest coconut or almond oil. Applly oil at night and wash the next day or minimum one hour before bath|`|WOqCWAp2aa	yeah|`|vwoqIUR6aa	yeah, just a little is good. you can also use a little hand cream too. it's also good for getting rid of dandruff|`|wJUDeZDQaa	yea...i use it|`|2TMbpYWnaa	its pefectly fine you can either put it on in the shower with your conditioner if you want a lot then rinse it, or you can put a few drops on your palms when your hair is still somewhat damp and just crunch it in but avoiding the scalp or top of your head, then blow drying will help heat up the oild and sink them deeper into your hair.  I do it all the time.  But beware too much will make your hair look wet all day.|`|WtTAwD4kaa	I wouldn't used baby oil in my hair. It just makes your hair get even dryer.

d5A37MTjaa	Ok just answering this quickly but for me my what i do when ever i go out and need an updo is a messy bun with wavy hair using pins to fasten wavy bit's and a jennifer behr style head band or two e.g.  http://kuwait-style.com/images/2008/10/1...    Hope that helps!|`|i5jNl2Cuaa	The one on your avatar!|`|bakQFJjdaa	I think you should do a fairly small bump on the top of your head and a pony. just brush your hair back and part where the bump will be, about the middle of both of your eyes up.  Take that section brush it back and fasten it with either two bobby pins on one side and one on the other and one going through, more or less it depends on how it stays, or a clip.  Then just brush the rest of your hair into a pony including the end of the bump and fasten with a elastic.   Thanks for reading my Answer.  Good Luck!

Grq9sVuBaa	Heres the thing with being black and going blonde is that black is one of the hardest colors to get out of your hair if you want to go blonde you HAVE to be patient with it. Do not I repeat do not get a box color and do it yourself you are just going to waste everyones time because that box is just going to F up your hair. You have to professionally do it unless you don't care about what it looks like and how you spent at the salon to have them strip it so many times, leave the box color alone|`|7KZOOkYYaa	You could try to redye it, but you might end up in the same situation. Either way, you need to give your hair a rest after all this stress. Get some heat therapy. Tresemme makes a mask for hair to get smooth again. Not only does it feel amazing but it really helps. I think you should leave the dying to the professionals from now on though. :)|`|IaaDgCgWaa	I suggest an all-over medium to dark brown color, a nice haircut and then let it grow out!|`|rNNvAcq4aa	dumb idea; your frying your hair to death. but let them strip it again.|`|JbSebJJYaa	I wouldn't use a box color.

s30Duwdraa	Just tell her straight up (but nicely) that you don't appreciate what she's doing.  She is disrespecting your things and it is very rude!  Especially because she is ruining them.  As proof, show her how the outfit looks on you after she's done with them.  Maybe that will wake her up.      You don't mention how old you are, but i think mums who where their daughters clothes are a little on the desperate side to try and think they're still young enough to wear them!      Maybe she admires your taste and that's why she does it...so maybe next time you go shopping you can buy her the same thing in a bigger size.    I feel for you!  GOod luck!|`|nVQGpvuoaa	Tell her.

JzGDBkZWaa	If you have a tolerance for pain, you can do it. It hurts, but it's nothing out of this world, not at all. I would compare it to getting your belly button pierced.    I got mine done about four months ago and I admit I sort of squealed in shock when he pushed the needle through, but it was done in a second and after that, it was nothing.    Mine bled a little the day after I got it done, so make sure you wear a bra you don't mind getting dirty, and make sure you keep it clean!!    Good luck!|`|O71xlcG3aa	Yes it does hurt.  I was going to have both done but I stopped after the first one.  Its bearable but they put this clamp right on your nipple right before the pierce it and the clamp is so painful.  Plus it takes a long time to heal and it hurts to give hugs.  You have to be really careful you don't hit it on anything cause it will bleed and you can't sleep on your stomach.  And you have to keep it super clean.  So they say that it feels awesome after it heals but imagine the opposite of that and that's how it feels to start off.  Its totally doable but it sure does suck for the first month or so....|`|c5anDswjaa	Wow all these crying, screaming, pants wetting people make me feel tough! Haha..    I got mine done last July, and yes.. They hurt pretty freaking bad.. But I didnt cry or anything, though if I hadnt of been sitting on my hands I would have hit something lol.. And I wanted to yell out obscenities so badly.. But I controlled myself, it only hurt for a little bit.. The clamps are probably the worst part.. But it may not even hurt for you, it didnt hurt for my friend when she got them done.. Just go and do it, youll love the results :)|`|NSpSWEWTaa	Imagine a hamster biting your nipple......

I suggest that you think long and hard about it. If you like the idea enough to endure a little pain, then go for it!    Good luck and have fun!    Pink|`|JbSebJJYaa	I've had friends that said it doesn't hurt as bad as you would think.|`|Qim0aSKtaa	for girls, typically no,  for boys, yes.    I've had mine pierced twice, both horizontally (then removed) and the right one vertically (still in). Have them pierced with a 12 gauge, the bigger the needle the more the pain is spread out. Its a very quick sharp pain, not even a second. It's totally worth it too.

It works!!! :P Do this 3 times daily for the quickest results.
6K1D6Azmaa	There's not a lot you can do to prevent this, if your parents have it. Probably staying out of the sun when you were younger might have helpedtoo late for that now.

6K1D6Azmaa	You're probably sensitive to the metal in the ring you bought. You can get it repierced again after it is completely healed, but make sure you only wear titanium jewelry.?|`|9qSF7zT3aa	For one thing, you changed it too quickly. Since navel piercings have less blood flow to the area, they take longer to heal. It's good to wait six months before even attempting to change the jewelry. And I'd have your piercer do it the first time. Just give it a month to fully heal, and then repierce. Just wait longer to change the jewelry. Also, make sure the piercer pierces it deep enough.|`|XNu6Krmcaa	Your piercing is rejecting.  You may be sensitive to the jewelery or something.  Some people can't have piercing because their body rejects them.  It's good that you took it out, it would have left a scar.  I'd give it a month or so for it to completely close, but you maybe able to get a better answer from your piercer.

bf5084d1ec35330c95ff7b7bd883bbffaa	This will sound really bizarre, but if you look it up on Google, it really works and people really do this.      The problem you have is caused by dilation of blood vessels under your eyes causing puffiness and dark circles.  Actors and actresses have often used (I told you this is weird) "Preparation H" to reduce the inflammation of these vessels and reduce the swelling of puffy eyes.

I would suggest going to the doctors if this isn't the case. Maybe you are allergic to a general ingredient in all shampoos    If you aren't keen on the doctors maybe try washing your hair with only water for a while and see if it cleans up.    Also, do you work in a sweaty environment? i know that chefs and other occupations that are required to wear hats or work in a warm environment get heat rashes in the places you described.

0UYJkSuZaa	You have been together for 5 years, it's not inappropriate. She knows of your fetish so it won't surprise her.

4vqzkIr4aa	Odd, I don't know of very many inks that have nickel. Maybe you are talking to an artist that does not know about the inks he is using but he is just simply using them.    You can do a bit of research and find inks that do not contain chromium or cobalt (forms of nickel). This is most often found in greens and blues. I would first start looking at Natural. It is a very good ink and is made up of all natural powder bases and is even referred to as non-allergic ink. It was created by a bunch of science professors from Harvard, Brown and Duke Universities and not by actual tattoo artists. I use several of there colors and have grown quite fond of there ink. The college geeks did something right for a change. I am not certain but I do not think that even the blues, greens, or reds contain any form of nickel.|`|6a9AfhsLaa	i'm allergic to nickel too, but i have multiple tattoos. all of the metals should be stainless steel. but as for ink, i've never had any problems. you might check with your doctor.

R2HS8BLiaa	Yes  you do need the mineral foundation powder first as it is a foundation to build on.  The Bronzing powder should not be used all over the face but only on the cheeks like blush plus across the forhead and down the nose and the tip of the chin-where the sun would kiss you.|`|ncCWCIEFaa	Shay answered this well.  The mineral foundation is your protection layer the bronzing powder is for a glow or some people use it as the blush I do lots of beach parties in the summer and I show people how to use it for eyeshadow as well.    I hate hearing people aren't happy and their consultant isn't helping if you are not getting the service you desire then please let her know you will need to find a new consultant if she doesn't become more helpful then go to www.martykay.com to find someone new in your area.|`|csypIdZWaa	Yes go ahead with ur choice|`|JYuz7CiXaa	Ok - I'm not a proffesional but my boyfriend's mom sells Mary Kay and MK sells powder foundation that looks airbrushed and clean (not clumpy and streaky). They also have a bronzer that makes you have this soft, tannish glow. And no, don't waste your money on the sheer mineral pressed powder, because the bronzer and the powder foundation should do the trick ;). Also, I always put the powder foundation on first then lightly brush the bronzer along my cheeks and under my eyes. So yeah it does work if you put one on top of the other. Hope this helps!
TCpTlCTRaa	There are several possible scalp conditions that can cause a yellowish. waxy, crusty or scaly substance that adheres to the scalp. Possibilities include several forms of folliculitis, sebhorrheic dermatitis, psoriasis and oily dandruff. Excess sebum can be a contributing factor. These conditions can create a barrier for healthy hair growth. Essential oil massage treatments are very effective at dissolving excess sebum and ridding the scalp of fungus, bacteria, dandruff and other pollutants. They can provide great relief for itchy scalp. The scalp must be clean and healthy and the follicles must be well nourished in order for hair to grow with ease. You can read more about essential oils for scalp and hair health at http://vzbotanicals.com|`|SMsprdMfaa	I would say not to use chemicals on your hair.Why don't you go for some home remedies. Egg whites, lemon juice, oil massages, reducing stress and diet changes can reduce hair fall and make it healthier. You can find more cheap, effective and natural home remedies for hair loss as well as for healthy hair at http://www.wellnesstalk.org/hairfall.htm...|`|ijXOMlIsaa	sounds like you have a scalp condition or infected hair folicals. This can happen if hair is continuously scraped back in a hair band tightly or if there is any other strain on the scalp. Some hair products can cause a reaction where the hair can fall out. Definitely see a pharmacist of doctor in case it gets worse.    Good luck

cWmROVe1aa	I had bleach blonde hair, and i wanted to dye it a red exactly like your first link. It looked absolutely wonderful (i LOVE red hair) but it only stayed in for a couple of days, and then it all washed out. each time i had a shower, my hair would go considerably lighter-until i had a pink shade left. I then had to cut half my hair off because it was so fried :(   So, i have been told by dozens of stylist that you need to fill your hair first. if your hair is a very light shade of blonde/bleach blonde you have to fill it.   filling is where the stylists put a dye on your hair. because blonde stripps the colour out of your hair, there is nothing for the dye/colour to grab on to.   the good thing about reds, is that they usually fade really fast to a reddish brown. Also, if your looking to get it done at home, then look for a box where the picture says red brown, or looks like it has red tones. Most store purchased hair dyes have a lot of red in them already-just avoid anything that says "ash". you could also try a brown hair dye (permanent) and then use semi-permanent reddish dyes to get the red, without frying your hair too much.  hope this helps!  good luck!|`|CyLv0mLPaa	well, I think on your light hair it's gonna be bright red. on the other hand, as far as Im concerned with coularants here in UK they tend to be much darker than in picture or in it's title.

6K1D6Azmaa	Yes, it can be normal. It's a result of weight gain. I've heard cocoa butter can prevent them, but I don't think there's anything you can do to make them go away. ?|`|mDt03eXIaa	Use cocoa butter, stretch marks are normal for any size if you grew quickly. Some people's skin is less elastic than others, so all this means is that when you developed, you did so too quickly for your skin to catch up. Most girls have them, it's no biggie. Cocoa butter can definitely help to fade them faster.|`|OQT7uNnNaa	step 1) get implants  step 2) get cocoa butter  step 3) enjoy|`|aYbm7gYTaa	yeah it's normal. anytime ur body grows and changes u get stretch marks. im a B and i have them. and u can use cocoa butter or a good firming lotion. dove has a good one.|`|PhCND4a9aa	i am not really sure but you might just be eating a bit too much or you are under alot of preasure|`|csmpYDfHaa	Well  i believed stretch marks.I sort of understand how you feel im 33A so have to be 34A and im 16.

e1434520b7d6b7db2b483084c9ad434aaa	Here are some basic tips for curly hair that you might find helpful:  *Try to find a stylist who knows how to work with curly hair. You can find reviews by region here: http://www.naturallycurly.com/curlsalons  *Don't shampoo every day.  *Comb conditioner through hair in the shower.  *Apply styling products to dripping wet hair. Scrunch or twirl hair to achieve desired shape.  *Use styling products suited for your hair type. Dont know yours? http://www.naturallycurly.com/hair-types  *Avoid terrycloth towels on hair; use linen, paper towels, or t-shirts instead.  *Air dry or use a diffuser with your blowdryer.  *Don't touch (or brush!) your hair while its drying.  *Once completely dry scrunch out any crunchy texture.    For hair type specific products check out these forums:  http://www.naturallycurly.com/curltalk/  There you can find others with the same hair type and try out some of their favorite products. I would recommend something, but I dont know your hair type. :)    Lastly, it has made my hair so much better since I started the curly girl method! I used to almost never wear it down (it was a frizz/poof ball), but now I have pretty, shiny curls. ~:) Its pretty radicalno sulfates (shampoo) or siliconesbut its so great for curly hair. Give it a shot and check it out:  http://www.wikihow.com/Follow-the-Curly-...  http://www.ylcf.org/gotcurl/ (outdated product recs!)    Some other great curly care sites:   http://www.youtube.com/user/jessicurl  http://livecurlylivefree.com/home.htm|`|CKLWiLbOaa	First off go buy the Herbal Essences Totally Twisted shampoo, conditioner, and moose. Use the shampoo and conditioner like normal. When you get out use the moose in your brushed hair. Make hair really curly and frizz free (that is if you don't touch it). Works for me and my sister.
4917bb54185a6e0ce588c170c8db1bc9aa	I tan. I'm not sure whether it actually makes me look any thinner, but it makes me feel better about myself. If you can find time to tan, I say go for it. AND since it's best to tan every other day at the most, Use the off days to do some lunges and such. You can do it while holding the baby to add a little extra weight and he'll enjoy the movement. I also do side steps/ lunges while trying to soothe my daughter instead of rocking her in the chair to try and firm up a bit.|`|GZVTLPwuaa	Tanning helps ONLY depending on your skin color. I'm white but have dark skin and tan pretty easily, I had a few small stretch marks on my boobs from being younger, Tanning basically erases them. However my best friend had a baby and has stretch marks on her legs and stomach..Tanning faded them for awhile, but when the tan faded they were as red and noticable as ever.. Why don't you try a self tanning lotion instead?|`|LhQtWT4Naa	Tanning will help reduce the appearance, get some Palmers cocoa butter lotion and use that where your stretch marks are,twice a day. you could also walk with your baby (stroller) and that will help  reduce the size of your legs

uVO5D0K9aa	i personally think that pink goes great with blonde hair.   here are some ways you could achieve this:  1) dye sections of your hair  2) get clip in hair extensions - i recently done this, i bought a dark red hair extension from ebay. it goes great with my brown hair. its just a singular clip in hair extension (it looks like a streak). and, it only cost me 2!    if pink isnt your colour, there are other colours as well :)|`|mA59dkjXaa	For blonde hair pink hilights are really nice either that or red or blue! umm for the hair style iam not really sure sorry
T5ZAYYpNaa	it doesnt ALWAYS get really damaged, but you need to have it done professionally.  I had mine bright red, then had it stripped and died platnum and had no issues (i also deep condition regularly but i always have).  but it was when i died to brown at home that it got really damaged! and i have been dying my hair at home since i was like in 6th grade so it wasnt like i didnt know what i was doing.    but what you'll want to do is do the blonde first, THEN do the front in the darker color.  it will be easier than doing it dark then trying to put in the lighter colors|`|AA11945637	it will be fine, just be careful not to over process and take good care once done|`|MYhQqeV7aa	Any drastic change to your hair color is best done by a professional. Your colorist will tell you if the color or process will damage your hair.|`|FHi0v36eaa	It depends. Since you have already dyed it a couple times, I would dye it the burgundyish purple colour, leave it for a bit, then dye the platinum blonde in the back. That will give you hair some time to rest after the dye. If you don't dye it too frequently it should be fine.|`|tB9FwJsUaa	When you dye your hair a lighter color, it breaks your hair off and it becomes super damaged. If you dyed you hair platinum blonde I can guarantee that your hair won't be the same for months no matter how much conditioner you put in it. When you dye your hair darker it fortifies your hair and it becomes healthy! Plus platinum blonde is old news! GO DARK.|`|5Fo0a32Uaa	if you bleach hair, it always gets some kind of damage
4917bb54185a6e0ce588c170c8db1bc9aa	CALM DOWN! Stress will aggravate the situation and excessive cleansing and creams will clog the pores. Your body will produce excess oil to combat all of the cleaning, making it worse. Try to settle down and see what happens tomorrow. Leave it alone for now. You may need cover up or something tomorrow but messing with it today will only make it that much worse.|`|JW3pbtvRaa	Cover it in foundadtion tomorrow|`|5TQEMVbtaa	take some eye drops like clear eyes or whatever brand & apply a few drops onto a q-tip or cotton ball & then dab that on your zit & it will take the redness out so it wont be as noticeable. Just dont pick at it or scrub it bc that will make it worse.
mvAgLB9laa	none - plain and simple.|`|kMsShtwpaa	i think it's cute + just a little bit of fun to be honest|`|SAhfYPWNaa	ttt|`|TfmvWPLLaa	nothing. its dumb, lame and ur forcing them to be a vain little child. child pageants are absurd...they subject children to pressure with looks/perfection at an early age.|`|0fE4qkPyaa	If they enjoy it,it can boost there confidence,and they can have a lot of fun doing it!  Plus it will put some extra $$$ in your pocket when they win.    But i am against parents forcing there children to do them.

Mine is wavy and my bangs are kinky, so it looks better long.|`|oPnfdTWuaa	I would go for a bob. It will make you stand out and not blend in with everyone else. It is a big change but it is edgey and very much in fashion this season.
I2ke8yj7aa	you are a beautiful girl and i do not suggest wearing alot of makeup at your age (14-15 maybe)  but if you want on girls opinion then.....  no mascara  a little blush no powder  blue gray of silver eyeshadow and a tiny bit of eyeliner (if you like it)  then a little lip gloss over some chap stick  also do your hair up make it look pretty (not that it isn't)|`|W3UYWpxiaa	Lip gloss  a brownish mascara  a peach blush    You have naturally pretty sick and you don't need a lot of makeup.  You look young...12-14ish|`|ukJ0rk2vaa	you look 12. But you have cool eyes! wear some black eyeliner to bring them out =) just don't go to heavy with it.|`|jcxtxBm0aa	grays,greens,coral pinks,peach it will really compliment your skin =]|`|KvZutMEZaa	You look about ten and you should not be wearing make up at ten.|`|m38dNEoDaa	If you have spots, then i think you should wear some foundation that's your skin colour, and i think some mascara. Because you look a bit too young for make up.
NEkXzGQoaa	Oh god, this question made me smile :)  But seriously, girls who wear freaking orange makeup are skanks and never deserve to NOT wear it.  (If that made any sense :/)  Let them live with their orange faces I say, they make good entertainment for us with the more natural skin types :D|`|PWkWptVuaa	Well it depends if they actually like it. Sometimes that just don't realise until someone says something mean and feel bad. Possibly 16? But some are really old - maybe they just don't care that.|`|5SiFjlBGaa	I've seen actresses who still haven't found a matching shade.|`|85iggLsVaa	once enough boys start making fun of them becoz they " got tangoed "  so usually 13 or 14  :D|`|SgFvuqJmaa	Not until they leave high school.  It seems that way here anyway.|`|9oTQpf3daa	some never do unless a friend points it out! i have seen woman with grown up children still using orange foundation, so i guess some just like it.
nJtJvL7Naa	LOL I was just talking to my friend about this...yes, I think it's completely stupid.  And I know girls that will spend their whole month's allowance on ONE designer piece - that is a total waste.<br>  <br>  The sunglasses are so annoying.  Really, if you want to look rich, then buy the knock-offs! JEEZ!<br>  <br>  But I think it's just because people are insequre and they think it will make them look more special, or more exclusive or something...|`|LLgLPEPUaa	I used to be like you are and I still 100% understand it.  I used to have an entire closet of clothes that didn't have a logo or anything on them.  <br>  <br>  Then I got to college and got a job at Abercrombie & Fitch (where they make you wear their clothes) and I finially changed my mind about everything and started to realize everything.<br>  <br>  When I've got my best outfit on and I look great, it's not like I'm wearing the same stuff that EVERYONE else has.....it's not that I'm WEARING Abercrombie.....it's that I AM Abercrombie when I wear it.|`|afX9FlaEaa	well yeah i guess i hate those abercrombie and labeled shirts there definetly not fashion...there more for little girls and teeny boppers...\<br>  <br>  as for uggs woman...get over it...i wear skate shoes and sneakers...but damn if my mom wants to buy me ugss ill sure as hell wear them...because they are comfy and they go with everything...if you dont like them then just dont wear them...easy as that|`|AA12133586	it not the insecurity depend on what brand it is, but most people buy it for the quality over time.. yes uggs and bearpaws can be warm and comfy however you have to think can bearpaw last as long as the uggs? or can they still be warm and comfy after 1 year of using it? i know my bearpaw didnt after a year since it start shredding and rip..  and yes i do not know why ppl pay 300 for a pair of glasses... like i said certain brand are much better than other|`|bJnNNpZdaa	have you ever just considered the fact that some people like what they buy? you're so stereotypical...oh eveyone that buys uggs and dolce gabanna glasses is a follower, they are insecure. get over yourself. its shallow when someone judges you on what you wear. you may be different, but my mother didn't raise me to judge people because of what they wear.<br>  <br>  ( ~ 8*

F4DIjrajaa	I think you are right that hair style would be perfect<br>  When I was younger people always guessed 5 years younger than I was too. I got a cute trendy cut like the one you picked out and BAM people thought I was my own age.  When I got older I let it grow out again (for my huband) I miss my cute cut (looked like that one) but sigh...the things we do for men:)|`|7nrhPCf0aa	i don't think it should be any shorter than you're shoulders. It would make you look too old
ff0ef493721d3e61a258a9ed095308e0aa	I have the same eye color as you and my eyes are small too, and the smoky eye always brings them out. First, I use a black pencil eyeliner (the brand i use is Rimmel) and I line the inner top and bottom rims of my eyes and on the top lash line, I make a slightly thick line, it doesnt have to be straight or perfect. Then just using my finger, I smudge the eyliner and blend it upwards. Then i take a Black eyeshadow (brand also Rimmel) and I put it over the eyeliner i just smudged and i blend it with my finger upwards. You should not blend it to far up close to your eyebrow or it will be too much. The blending of the black eyeshadow is what takes the longest and it just takes practice. Then i curl my eyelashes and put on that XXL Mascara. If you think the black is too harsh for you, you could use a dark gray or navy blue or chocolate brown and it would rally compliment your eyes.|`|AA10764379	well if you think ur eyes are to small for your face i wouldnt use the smoky eye effect.It is supposed to make people who think their eyes look like bug eyes appear smaller.instead i would use a jet black eyeliner to make your eyes look bold (but dont overdue it) and for the masscara just wear any kind you like.|`|e1238745a6f2beed5d522cc0545eb79baa	The best way I've found to get a smoky eye is to start by lining your upper and lower lids with a black pencil first.  Get as close to the lash line as possible.  Then go over that with an angle brush dipped in a dark shadow to give it a softer, smudged look.  Go over the lid of your eye in a medium shade shadow, blending up from the lash line.  Then use a light shade shadow in the crease of your eye to open up your eyes and make them bigger.  The concept here is dark to light, blending all the way.  To bring out blue eyes use warm brown shades like toffee, caramel, and gold.  To make sure your eyes stay nice and big, always line the outside of your lashes, not the inside, and don't connect the lines on the top and the bottom.  Top off your look with mascara.  A great mascara I've used is by Benefit.  It's a little pricier but worth every penny.  You can find it at makeup counters in higher end department stores like Macy's and Bloomingdales.|`|f487f18235ac897bddf905cc87e5b19faa	Tips on Eye makeup / Smokey eyes  http://homebeautytips.blogspot.com    Tips on Makeup /cosmetic tricks /celebrities makeup/  hair highlighting /Hairremoval/ Facials etc...     http://geebal.blogspot.com     Tips on mineral/bare mineral makeup and how to apply...  http://homebeautytips.blogspot.com|`|AA11009459	smokey eye would use perhaps a dark grey and blues for your eye colour. Start with the darkest of the colours in the outer corner of your eye, and put the 2nd darkest colour over most of the eye lid, and then the lightest colour oh the inner corner of the eye then blend all the colours softly with an eyeshadow brush.    Use lorel Lash Architect - in Black - works really well to open up eyes. also apply a khol eye liner to just the outside corner of the eye. if u use it all around, it makes them look smaller.

Now you want to determine what is the best shading shape in your case. You can try applying one shading shape (rounded) to one eye and the other shading shape (winged) to the other eye (this would save you time). Then go look in the mirror and see which one looks best on you.    Experiment and try all the different shading. You may be surprised to find that several of them may look great on you (the rounded technique seems to look good on the majority of women).    If you don't have much room between the eyelid crease of your eye and your eyebrow then apply eye shadow using the winged shape (unless there is some sagging).|`|KvZutMEZaa	I found some ideas:    http://make-up.lifetips.com/cat/65796/ey...    http://makeup.lovetoknow.com/Sexy_Eye_Ma...    http://makeovertrends.taaz.com/index.php...

Snow blindness, some medications make the eyes extra sensitive to any light, migraines are exacerbated by any light, surgical procedures on the eyes require sunglasses during recovery time, many blind people wear dark glasses to let people know they are blind. and of course some people have serious eye diseases --but hey, that isn't important is it?  If you think they look dumb without knowing or caring about the whole story then go ahead and think what you want.

It's a demi that washes out in about 30 shampoos. But I definitely had a friend help me. Especially because I can't see the back of my head (and I'm assuming the same goes for you. lol.) :)|`|9OdcDLRXaa	get some one to help you and get a second dye close to ur natural color just in case something goes wrong|`|0UYJkSuZaa	You need to have a friend help you. It's really hard to get the back even on your own (trust me I've tried). Your friend needs to part your hair in about 1in sections until the dye completely saturates your hair. After the dye is in, work it all in like you would work in your shampoo.

They were the first people to come out with anti-aging skin cream and now have a line for every single need including redness or acne.     I'd throw out what you're using as they probably have the typical over the counter chemicals in them which will dry your skin out. With Murad they do have a purging period of 7 days but after that everything clears up really fast and for good.    It's a company to stay with for life even after your problem is gone. (where's my free products for endorsing them? ha)    www.Murad.com    PS They have payment plans

But you should never put sterling silver in a healing body piercing.|`|l7r9MPt2aa	I got mine when I was 35 (now 42)-it hurt, but not any worse than any other piercing.

Let it heal and then for the first time-go back to where you had it done to have them change it.

2lqqRcMvaa	Girls tend to gain or lose weight after they go though puberty. If you've been like that all your life, it's likely that you will lose weight going though puberty. If you haven't, and its something that just came up recently, it is probably from going though puberty. Just remember to stay active and don't develop an eating disorder. If it makes you feel better, most girls are insecure about their bodies.|`|uhRKCb9kaa	you are 13 then why are you worrying about your fatness its good for you.it will go when you will loose your teens|`|qgDCcNQqaa	At 13 it's most likely puppy fat.

I bet when you get to 15 you will be a swan. Think more about grooming yourself. like looking after your skin, and nails, hair etc. x|`|lNsr26oIaa	As long as you are active and eat healthily, don't worry about a little baby fat.

I've been wearing mascara since I was 15, almost 10 years, and barely started using it.  I wish I would have found this miracle product a decade ago. I have very sparse, thin lashes but once i apply this mascara it transforms them into noticeably thicker lashes.|`|AA11352641	I've used Covergirls Super Thick Lash for years and I love it. I recently tried Maybelline Colossal lash and it works about the same as the Super Thick Lash. It's all in the brush - the Great Lash brush is too scrawny for me, I like a full, bushy brush to really coat all the lashes. It also helps to apply liner at the lash line.

2TMbpYWnaa	I have bleach blonde hair and go from tan skin to pale skin a lot.  I use a nice purplish brown /raisin eyeliner but i love using really really dark browns with purple hues in them as eye shadow.  I think that if you use bold colors that still have an earthy toen you will look stunning but not trashy or young.  But of course if you go crazy with the eyes do little with the lips and visa versa.  Blondes look great in bright red lipstick, Vincent longo makes an awesome lip stain you can even use on your cheeks.  All of vincent longos stuff is good check it out.|`|697ae04db2502a1d77e3c8fb84237406aa	i always use a black eyeliner & a very light brown based eyeshadow.  not the powder and not a goopy gel.  glossy lips with a very pale close to the color of my lips red lipliner that i always blend in...the focus is always the eyes.|`|AA11562326	What you need to do is ask GUYS that are your age what looks good.

Use a nice black mascara, you can use brown too, but I find that black stands out better. You can also outline our eyes with a good eyeliner. I would use either black or brown.|`|Rh6BekvUaa	use purple and brown :)  or   like a teal and a brown  or a teal and a silver  or purple with silver    :)  use black eyeliner if your using silver.|`|nCBdJkbEaa	bright, bold colors always work.    but since you are blonde, black eye liner, eyeshadow, and mascara will make make your eyes pop and will make them more noticeable.|`|0f18eHcXaa	What color eyes do you have? That is what it depends on.   Blue eyes- pink, blue, dark blue, peach etc all of those colors look greata nd will make your eyes pop.  Brown eyes- purple brown and greens.  Green Eyes- blues and purples and browns.  :D|`|vYRYeqiGaa	Dye your hair black.|`|3ZpMQjtpaa	Try colors that play on your skin/hair/eye colors combined. Blonde hair almost always looks good with pastels, which will be noticeable, and won't look like too much.     Always try to stay away from blue eyeshadow; instead, try eyeliners and shadows in leafy greens or hazy purples. Even light browns and pinks will do the trick.|`|ZumPWWi8aa	Use a bright color then a soft melo color like earth tones.. under the brighter colors.. hope this helps|`|bac2b33807e3acebb9fa63566c13cac0aa	(roderick here again)  Hey, sorry, no offense intended, really - just trying to help.

83c06126e3de51d3ad3aa098db034cf7aa	When I want my hair straight, I wash it and blow dry it. It's really soft and straight afterwards, and easy to do anything to it. It doesn't damage it unless you do it like every day.|`|3e9063bc3fc9ae1a7a1ca06bbe548e99aa	There is no best way|`|e9e0015aaf7294083ce9a0ec02ad3274aa	You should get a straightener that de-ionizes your hair.

I know alot of people use an iron.(that you iron clothes with)  It actually makes their hair really shiney and smooth looking.  But I usulally just blow dry it and put leave-in conditioner in my hair.|`|aad2fbe3a0da64ae93197c193011dd4eaa	there are hair products that claim to straighten hair, mostly for afro american, but i did know a lady that (ikid you not)  ironed her hair.  but it was very long|`|AA12336569	There's no best way, but to put heat restorer in your hair before you place heat on it. That's all that I really tell you.|`|7afadda781171cd9ce4069d36427bb67aa	Last time I cut my hair was in May, and I use heat every day but I don't have any split ends (that I have found)  Try this; deep condition every three or four days and leave it on for a while.  This will repair damage that does occur.  The best is to get a shower cap so you can have it on while you're doing stuff around the house.  I use redken all soft creme.  Get a shampoo and daily conditioner for your specific hairtype.  I like frizz ease hair serum which I use right after getting out of the shower, and before blowdrying and ironing, Alberto VO5 Miracle Mist heat defense spray.  The layers of these two products will help shield your hair and the mist protects color (if you do color it) and also helps lock in the style.|`|AA10940353	a hair straightner if you healthy hair|`|41a577ed737785613e0ad7e2c7312b8eaa	use ceramic straightener it might be more expensive but worth it don't forget the heat protection balm and don't straighten your hair everyday air dry instead of blow drying helps allot too|`|312c9f4a1e9e629bafad6e298bfff997aa	well you cant really, i straiten my hair everyday, and dont get me wrong it looks great but it feels like straw,|`|2811ea60c8ba9c670437fdf351bb7d12aa	You need to use a CHI flat iron, but first you need to use a heat activating mist. Biolage has a good one. You also need to make sure you do not use any other product before you flat iron it. If you use your flat iron on a regular basis you will need to use a deep conditioning mask to keep it moisturized. Kerastase carrys a mask "masquintense" that is a little pricey but it lasts about 6 mo. I use my CHI on a daily basis and use the entire Kerastase line and I am very happy with it. Good Luck|`|f87b49d97828b4858f5bf6b10fa08cebaa	If your hair is long use a great conditioner and place a cotton cloth over it and iron it on a med heat. If your hair is short, condition it and blow dry using a rounded brush.Start at the underneath hair at the scalp and brush slowly pulling the brush, turning it, up and out through until the ends the as the brushful dries. Continue all the way around and do the top thin layer last. You may need to spritz the top layer, if it has taken a long time for thick hair, to remoisten it so that you can get it to work properly.By pulling it up and out you get body and fullness,especially good for thin or fine hair. It worked back in the 70's, and now, before all of the hair products and special gadgets we have today!

RLBYSpU4aa	In my complete honest opinion I think you are to young to go and get one. However you are not asking for my opinion on whether or not it is a good idea. But before I go in to actually giving you advice I just want to say, think hard about if you really want to get this done. Don't be one of those idiots who wants one cause "It looks so major cool" or some stupid crap like that. Get it done cause you actually want one, and that it may have some meaning to you or something. Also you should know that if you are wanting to get a job most places don't want employees with facial piercings.<br>  <br>  Anyways there is really no one way you can go about it. The only thing you can really do is sit down with your mom and have an intelligent conversation about it. I stress the intelligent part, meaning you need to have actual good reasons for wanting to get it done, and not because it looks cool. So just get together a bunch of points on why you want it done, sit down with your mom and talk to her and tell her stuff like it wont change you and that you will pay for it and do extra work around the house to kind of sweeten the deal on her side.<br>  <br>  Other than that there is nothing you can do, except just get it done illegally and go through all the trouble of hiding it from her, or wait until your 18 (which I highly suggest you do).|`|AJjSEXVbaa	Just wait. Good Lord what is the big deal if you have to wait a few years? By then you may not want it anymore. This piercing craze is just about over anyway.

SmWoRu3kaa	It's simply because they look better to us guys. Heels make your bottom look better, make you carry yourself more upright, and give the appearance of having longer, more slender, and more toned legs, which are all attractive to guys. Same with the skirt — it's more enticing and attractive when you have some leg showing, even tempting.|`|NpSsLV9Oaa	Sometimes guys/people notice just when you start to make an effort to look great.

It could also be that because you took more time to look nice you...um...looked nice. High heels tend to make a woman's legs look more shapely (the butt too because of the way they shift your weight) and skirts naturally show off the leg so wear a skirt and heels and men are going to notice.|`|LLgLPEPUaa	Well since nobody yet has said anything that makes any sense, I will.<br>  <br>  I'm pretty sure that the clothes you used to wear were a turn-off to guys.|`|8ENRWmoMaa	i think girls look better with tight jeans, at least if they have a nice *** and legs.|`|n9HUANkiaa	it's so damn sexy, nothing like a women in high heels!<br>  just look at yourself and tell me you don't look sexy!

e6ee2d65a086e5e04a0dd950af7400c1aa	I strongly suggest that you use pumice for scrubbing dead skin cells off your skin since the normal washcloth doesn't seem to be suffient. If you find pumice too hard for you, then just pick the best body scrub that you can find in the market (even the dollar and the 99 cents stores have good body scrubs). And please, keep in mind that you really shouldn't miss a day of taking a bath. Not only that your dead skin cells will be thicker and accumulate, but it can also be a cause of bad body odor in the future.

The shortest layer should hit the tops of your ears, and the longest layer should be about 2 or 3 inches past your shoulders. If you wear bangs, keep them long, so you cab brush them to the side. This hair style works great with all types of hair, thick, thin, curly, or straight.
IHhDMHrGaa	we all have different skin types and there are different medications... you need to see a dermatologist to determine the right medication for your skin...|`|GZVTLPwuaa	You have to stick with Proactiv for about a month to see the maximum results. Also it's important to cut out soda from your diet and tomato. I find that when I drink soda or eat red foods it makes me break out. The reason it's getting worse is because you don't have a routine you are sticking too, switching products WILL make acne worse. You have to stay with something for a good month to figure out if the results will work for you.    Proactiv worked for me, and I used to get pimples EVERYWHERE, but they were always tiny white heads, my sister however would break out with large red pimples.. proactiv helped her too.

Hope I helped  Xoxo  Mary|`|hVKYVJ89aa	i used to suffer from acne when i was about 14-16. its sooo annoying and just totally breaks down all your confidence! and yeah i know what you mean, proactive dries your skin up pretty bad due to the large amount of benzoyl peroxide in it (i even got some under the skin spots), and even though i found the moisturiser by proactive used on its own to be quite effective, it was just a pain having to order it all the time as its only available from overseas. not even mentioning its expensive. So when i ran out of the stuff my spots would return..      i went to see a doctor and fortunately ive now got my acne undercontrol, if you haven't already try these:    benzoyl peroxide cream (prescribed by your doctor, just the right amount to clear up your skin by drying out your spots, and in experience ive found it to be a lot less harsh than proactive)    also you didnt mention if you were, but if your on the pill, there is one that really helps with acne that your doctor can also prescribe you.|`|altDLtTKaa	i think u might visit a dermatologist, because they can tell u if it's an acne problem or if its a hormonal problem.|`|e91KtSX2aa	If you are a woman, Birth Control would work.

They'd probably think about putting you on a course of oral antibiotics - this can help a great deal but usually will take a couple of months to turn things around or certain forms of the contraceptive pill can also help with acne.  As a last resort if all else fails, your doctor would refer you to a dermatologist, who can prescribe roaccutane...this can work wonders in time but can cause quite a lot of side effects.   Aside from this, a healthy diet and drinking lots of water is recommended.

The key for a sexy guyliner is line the smudge,smoke and lots of blending with a blender or smokey brush.|`|6iD5u3ymaa	well i don't think you should anyway... i don't think very many guys can pull off makeup without looking gay. but if you really want to, i think you should just use normal eyeliner, not liquid because you can't smudge liquid which will make it look really harsh and you don't want that. just do something subtle. hope that helped!!|`|AA11634944	You don't.|`|xyJ5fXL1aa	Sorry, Albert A.  I simply don't understand why men are wearing make up.   Men with eyeliner on is a turn off.....at least to women they are.    Why not get your lashes professionally tinted at the salon if you're after some drama around the eyes? This will give your lashes a deeper color and give some definition around the eyes.  And, you don't have to apply make up every day. The best part? It's natural looking and not very expensive. An eye lash tinting service should cost around or less than $20.    Consider this alternative instead of liquid liner.|`|l2rNPQYqaa	uhm...ew.|`|5TQEMVbtaa	you shouldnt.|`|0f18eHcXaa	i suggest you don't wear any.
cgv6NbsQaa	It's best to choose a hair color at least one shade lighter than what you want, they do generally come out darker than you think.   I think your best bet is to go to a salon before you go on your trip and get them to look at it. Leave it as near to your trip as possible to let it fade out a bit more with washing. It'll be better for the condition in the long run. Try washing it with head and shoulders, that's strong stuff. I've known colours to fade after using that. It wont dry your hair out as much as washing up liquid, although it would be worth doing a couple of wash's with it first then move over to head and shoulders until your salon trip. Also get yourself a really good conditioner and towel dry your hair before applying it, comb it through and leave it on for a good 10-15 mins.   Once it's a colour you like invest in a really good shampoo and conditioner. It really is worth the money. And make sure you do an intensive treatment every now and then. Don't let it put you off color, if you can't afford to have it done at a salon too often ask your hairdresser for some advice on what to buy.    Hope it works out. Enjoy your trip!|`|8UyUhlusaa	I had the same problem, except mine was WAY worse my hair was clown red. Basically I tried every urban myth there is to get it out but to be honest it won't come out. Unless you go to a salon and get it professionally done, which is the safest way. What I did was wash my hair like 30 times a day, it reduced the colour but it was still quite dominant, the colour has gone now, but baring in mind it was about 6 months ago I do still have a reddish tint. Your best bet is to go to the salon and have them deal with it.|`|f650668c14b2d6c103dc37b0b2affbc4aa	You can use dish detergent (like Dawn or Palmolive) to fade out an unwanted hair color, though some small traces of color may remain, and it will make your hair very, very dry.    To begin this process, lather a small amount of detergent in your hands, and wash like you would with shampoo, taking care to make sure the lather is worked in well, and rinse with water that is as hot as you can stand (hot water opens the hair follicle). You will have to repeat this several times, at least 10 or 12, and then follow up with a heavy duty conditioner. Leave the conditioner on your hair for about 15 minutes, then rinse in very cool water.     This should fade out the color pretty well, and the conditioner should help your hair from being too dried out.    If your hair is already very dry, before you work in the conditioner, add a little olive oil to to the amount of conditioner you normally use. This will not only add shine, but it will give your hair some added moisture.

You'll need a further two colour shades - one dark and one lighter (but darker than the base coat you just put on)     Use the lighter colour first and apply this to your eye lids.  Start at the outside of your eye and bring the brush along the bottom of your lid.      Now using the same colour, take the brush again from the outside of your eye over the top of the eye socket - not all the way to the brow - but it should show when you open your eye.  Essentially, you are  making a sideways 'V' here.  Use your brush to really blend the colour with the base coat.      Now use the darker colour and a thinner brush or applicator to apply around the outside of your lids - instead of eyeliner.  Smudge in the colour. With a bit of mascara - you should have one pair of lusciously smokey smoldering peepers.    With a base coast of foundation / powder, a little blush on your cheeks (always apply blush from the outside of your face in - so if there is any excess it goes in your hairline - not on your cheek!) and some lippy and you'll be away.    On me, this works best using a light silver for the base coat (non glossy) then darker silver and deepest grey - but you can alternate with what ever colours suit you best.      Have a lovely time!

NVx3iRZJaa	(Hey i'm the same age as you, lol)  Actually, all of that IS make up. :P    Make sure you don't cake it on, because that looks gross.   A little bit of each is fine..depending on what your face looks like. For example, if you have long dark eyelashes, then you won't need mascara. So it's one more thing you don't have to use.   The less you have to wear, the better.    REMEMBER : It should not appear to people that you're wearing make up, unless it's for decoration such as sparkly orange eyeshadow.  But if you go for a basic, natural look, then keep it simple. You should NOT put on tons of eyeliner. I'm sorry, but that just looks horrible..especially on girls our age.     There's also things to question.... what color are your eyes? If they're green, then brown eyeliner would make them pop. I have green eyes and black eyeliner makes me look like a hooker. Lol. O_o    Just experiment with different shades and colors. I personally don't think you need lip gloss all the time. Do you have a boyfriend? If you do and you kiss and stuff, wear flavored lip balm. You don't want to get your partner's lips all sticky. If you don't, then it doesn't really matter. But once again, if you're going for a natural look, buy CLEAR lip gloss.     If you have a clear face, then there's no need to wear foundation. Just a bit of powder is good. If you have a few pimples, you can wear a thin layer of foundation and a light cover of powder. BE CAREFUL of what kind you buy, and how much you even it out. Depending on the kind and the proper applying of it, it can make you look orange.    MASCARA :   I'd like to say from personal experience that you must take it off every night. If you don't, and then you wake up and rub your eyes even slightly..your eyelashes will fall out due to the fact they're brittle with mascara.        REMOVING MAKE UP : There's bunches of different make up removers, but the best one if baby oil. Yep, it's true. It removes ANY make up. Macara, foundation, eyeliner, eyeshadow. No matter how thick or how dark it is. Works like a dream. I wish more people knew this. Not to mention, but it coats your skin and makes it nice and soft. To remove eyeliner, put a bit of baby oil on a cue-tip, pull down your eye and rub it over your water line and anywhere the liner is applied.       Hope this helped!   Happy trails. :)      EDIT :   Sorry, I ment to add in at the top that Make up should only be used as an enhancer of your best features for a daily natural look. If you want to do sparkly decorative make up, makes sure it's only ONE thing like eyeshadow or an overall face shimmer. One, NOT both.     Decorative make up usually consists of bright, abnormal colors (red, blue, green, pink, anything that isn't part of your natural skin color). This is fine, as long as you understand how to use it properly.|`|QqaEpnkRaa	Dont use eyeliner under your eyes that really makes it look like you are using too much. Instead put eyeliner on the top, its harder but looks better, mascara is good. Stay away from sparkly lip gloss. as for foundation if you don't have acne or redness I recommend staying away from liquid foundation sometimes just a powder can work. If you do suffer from acne or redness make sure the color really matches your skin tone and try only applying where there are problems, but be careful foundation can highlight the problem with some acne. As for powder make sure it is just a powder and not another foundation and try to stick to just using it when your skin is looking oily.|`|7eKUic6Oaa	it depends how much you use of each product... you don't want want to cake on powder on top of liquid foundation... and don't use too much eye makeup|`|gnJ8yQmyaa	No. I wear the same make-up as you except I wear eye shadow instead of eye liner.  As long as you aren't caking on foundation, it should be fine.|`|duLD8iOEaa	Hah,  Well everyone has a different opinion on that.  I personally love dark eye make-up (I think it looks really exotic and pretty)  Just make sure you don't cake on foundation. Use bareminerals or a powder and apply only a little bit so it gives you more of an airbrushed look.|`|RXRn57f4aa	what u need to do is clear out all ur make up u dont need then use the make u do need. i would suggest u put the right blusher on to match your skin tone then put eyeliner then eyeshadow then mascara and lip gloss.|`|YdrnTTo0aa	no, i wore that much when i was your age. sounds good to me (:|`|mM0if8Yaaa	If you have to ask that question then you are wearing too much especially for your age in my opinion.

It all depends on the occassion though. . .pink would go for maybe something during the daytime, navy/sky blue would go great if you're going out for dinner, and black might go for, say, a banquet or something.  Hope you found this useful. . .sorry it's so long!|`|7IZZ8IO9aa	I like it [: its cute. you know everyone won't have that combo!|`|EVdBYsgSaa	wow yes those colours would look great together!    i would suggest you wear silver jewelry too xx|`|ARjGKSx0aa	Adore it, that's so cute!|`|DK127MNKaa	sorry but the dress is ugly    but i like going for simple elegant things  and its too green and shiny|`|z6ci3V1baa	personally, i don't really like the multi shade green color but you'd have to try it on to see if looks good or not.|`|x8mc8Ns0aa	cut but dont really like dress|`|iYL37RfPaa	Wow that dress is soo nice,  there is just something about it that makes me really like it,    and yarr those shoes a clutch would go well with the dress :)!!    xo|`|68d6a3309b70162315c58a97dda23287aa	I think the dress looks a little cheap looking.   The shoes look outdated.  I loooove the clutch!
6SasHFPBaa	It's a very pretty dress, my friend wore a similar one to prom.  Don't do red pumps, though.  Go with either a black shoe, or silver or gold.  It's more classy, more dressy.  Black matches everything, but metallics are a little nicer to pair with a relatively basic black dress.  I love the neckline, btw!|`|V3Vi5vUSaa	well i think that since you are short then maybe not too long of a dress maybe something not reaching the floor|`|zV1J3sByaa	Yea, i think you can EASILY pull that dress off.... Good Luck =D|`|hZDk07Wtaa	It's okay.  these are my choices for u:  choice 1 :  wear a chiffon scarf. tie it to the side  your neck like a bow. or satin scarf. the black dress you got in mind. use metallic flats. do your curled and put it up like you know classy elegant look ( go to the hair salon ). wear shiny and sparkly earrings. red lipstick, if you got a fair skin. hot pink if you got a normal tan skin. sheer colour if you got a black skin. use a mettalic clutch.     choice 2     Necklace not the short ones, long ones. find necklace with colours like black, white metallics, and clear colours. the black dress you got in mind. hair curled and put your hair any ways you want  ( you can braid you hair if you want ).use 'chunky' matching bangles. mettalic bow flats. use the clutch i recommend in choice 1.     choice 3:    get a black satin scarf that long enough to go around your waist. tie it up to cover the hole from your dress and make a bow in the middle, nice and cute.  wear a short necklace, possibly borrow your mum's if she have one. and use the hair from choice 1 or just curl your hair and leave it down and wear a head band. use the same clutch and shoes i recommend choice 1 and 2.       GoOd Luck|`|5OUKTgBAaa	Yes you'll look star stunning! Have a great time!|`|2zHq2XIMaa	Yeah of course, it looks beautiful. It will set you aside from the crowd.   Have a great time=)!|`|aoyVeq16aa	wow.    i think it is stunning, but you are right... not a prom dress.  maybe you can wear silver pumps and fancy jewelry. I wouldn't get it taken up quite as short as the models  :)    have fun!|`|O27yDj06aa	i think its really pretty|`|1sfYOZNbaa	yea i think thats really pretty. i dont really like the long puffy prom dresses anyway. i think silver accessories would dress it up a bit.    hope i helped!|`|AILK0BTiaa	i think so.. have fun!!! :)|`|9YlQ5HEhaa	It looks sexy.|`|26W8necwaa	of course you can just wear some red pumps and a pearl necklace and your prom material.|`|HnwvSdnKaa	yes, that's really cute and i see people wearing dresses like that to prom all the time. less people wear long dresses now. also it will look cute on you since youre short (like me!) and short people look cute with short dresses... long dresses make it look like youre swimming in them, and short people can get away with short dresses like that because they dont look skanky on short legs|`|EGvBUet0aa	its pretty but not a prom dress|`|87e9e1dd10cd6fdc964c54b8c9fcfabaaa	i think that is a much better choice than the long gowns considering you size
801214c8b225f54a67515ceb25b08c31aa	Umm...yes to me you sound very gorgeous to me, for a 13 year  old. However, no offense but you kind of sound shallow. You like to wear Abercrombie, you like shopping, the beach, kissing, cuddling and makeup? I mean, most girls like those things at least somewhat, but you didn't mention any other interests you have. If you hope to attract people, you should have a deep personality, because people want to date interesting people who make them laugh. Also, are you sure you're a lesbian? A lot of middle school girls go through phases where they think they're lesbians but may find out later that they aren't. Just give it some time, maybe you will like guys someday too. They are not all jerks. I mean, it's OK to have some fun in the meantime, but the Bible says homosexuality is wrong. You are only 13, so maybe this isn't the best time to be trying to attract lots of hott girls yet. I know you don't want to hear that but it could be true. Just my opinion, good luck...|`|00b724093ef3c0777c17117c9854e05caa	absolutely!|`|846b39a4bcddaf2a5579e9333cfb7184aa	Yes you do sound beautiful ! But are you sure your a lesbian? You are so young..

857ba936830c0b80bbd723acf28788a6aa	To look decent you need plain light colored shirts. Colored thin stripes on white base will be bingo !! Colours you can try are Violet, Sky Blue, Soft yellow, lightest pink, grass green etc.   Tousers should always be of dark color. eg. rich black (best), light striped gray etc. Black shining shoes are always well suited to inspection officers. Then belt also needs to be black with a simple buckle.|`|DI3GBpk9aa	Industrial Helmet, good quality leather shoes (ankle fitting), safety hand-gloves, Safety goggles / eye-protecting glasses, comfort fit cotton clothes. Clothes should not have loose ends such as "Pallu" or "Dupatta" etc. If you are visiting metallurgy industry then wear a Apron also. Dust mask would be required if you are moving in dusty zone.|`|Sp6A8cDnaa	Working in a factory myself, I can definitely say dresses are a bad idea.  Especially if you're moving about on the factory floor.  Always wear pants and tops that aren't too loose so that they can get caught in the wrong thing and take you for a ride.    -seen it a couple times, not pretty

Lo que sucede es que todas las personas necesitamos exitarnos para en la medida en que esa exitacion crece lleguemos a un orgasmo.     En las mujeres ese proceso es ms prolongado y lento. Cuando slo tienes penetracin a tu cuerpo le toma mucho ms tiempo acostumbrase a un slo estmulo, y lo ms probables es que a tu pareja le tomo menos llegar.    En la medida en que incorpores  ms estimulos a las relaciones sexuales como caricias, besos, sexo oral, sexo anal, otros tipos de juegos sexuales, en esa misma medida lograras orgasmo con la penetracion. En otras palabras todo tu cuerpo es un instrumento sexual aprovechalo a plenitud. No prentedas solo llegar por lo que sientes en la vagina este es uno de los puntos que te genera placer pero no el unico.

In just one night my dark circles were gone and I loved it!!!|`|GkjvLrLaaa	There are many causes of dark circles, from age, heredity, allergies, cold or sinus infection, bone structure and glasses which are not so commonly known.    http://www.mydarkcirclesblog.com/2006/11...    If you would like to apply home remedies to reduce dark circles, here are some of my suggestions:  Buy a box of regular, old fashioned unflavored gelatin (e.g. Knox) from grocery store. Take a small cup or bowl and put in 1 teaspoon of the gelatin mix. Add one tablespoon of boiling water & stir for a minute. Test it on your wrist to make sure it is not too hot. Then, using a cotton ball, pat it under your eyes as you would an eye cream or gel. Go lie down and listen to some music, or take a bath & let it stay on for at least 30 minutes. Then just rinse it off.Gelatin is very high in Vitamin K & Biotin. It will not remove your dark circles on the first application (but you will notice a difference), but if you do it daily for a week, and then 2-3 times a week for maintenance, you should notice a drastic reduction in dark circles.  http://www.mydarkcirclesblog.com/2007/01...

AA10940353	Long Hair, depends on the guy better|`|6ac013da2dceabac6383ebdee4f828c0aa	My tastes vary quite a bit when it comes to men, but it's more fun that way.  ;-)    I like long hair on guys but I don't think many of them can pull it off.  It has to be long, straight and dark.  Some light-haired guys can do it too, but I don't think this look works with curly or frizzy hair.    I also have a thing for bald men.  When DH shaves his head, I really love it.    Guys look best in whatever colors suit them best and it's important for people to know their "colors."  It really makes a difference in your appearance.  Generally (but not always), dark hair and dark eyes look good in black, white, purple, red OR the autumn colors, such as green, rust, orange, browns, golds, etc.  Lighter hair and eyes are usually (but not always) complemented by warm pastels (pink, yellow, baby blue, soft green) OR what I call the "heather" pastels:  heather grey, heather green, h. violet, etc.  It is all about the undertones (warm, cool or neutral) in a person's skin.      I like my man in black and he looks good in purple too.  :-)|`|AA10846376	I like a little longer in the back and permed.If it is short, I like it spiked on top with blond highlights.|`|1bcf22f639b1cb62308b28ce862e6fd3aa	i like my boyfriend to keep his hair shaved (not bald but no longer than 2 inches long), and I love when he wears striped polo shirts. no matter the color, although i do prefer him in black and red|`|3062e566745e964c32ae137964edfeccaa	I loathe long hair on guys, it kinda looks messy and there is not much they can do with it.|`|3vA69tmcaa	The best color depends on the guy and the person judging! I think my honey looks best in green, but someone else might think he looks better in blue.    And I prefer shaggy hair on a guy, but, again, it depends on the guy.  I dated someone with really long hair (past shoulders) once and I didn't like it at all.  I've also dated guys with buzz-cuts.  Generally I like a guy with hair long enough to run my fingers through without getting tangled.|`|gu9bREZ6aa	I don't like spicky hair, but i do like when a guy wears purple or pink :)|`|AA11011600	Short hair definitely.

Blanco y negro porque representa la union de las razas. Esto se dio porque despues de la independencia de jamaica, muchos jamiquinos emigraron a inglaterra. Habia jovenes ingleses que simpatizaban con los jovenes de los ghettos, ellos llevaron el ska de la primera ola y lo fusionaron, naciendo asi el 2 Tone y una segunda generacion de Rude Boys.  Esta bandera tambien simboliza el antiseximo, y pedia una igualdad en todos los aspectos.    El ska es muy viejo (1958) y han salido muchos subgeneros te los enlistare para que sepas como se les llamaba a cada grupo.    Ska Tradicional - Rude Boys (groseros)  Skinhead reaggae - Skinheads   2 Tone - Rude Boys (chicos rudos)  Oi - Skin Heads (Sharps o Rash)  3ra ola (Ska punk, ska jazz, fusion, latin,etc) - Skankers, skatos.|`|4079ac491f9ff8e025a390361b3326edaa	Ni idea.|`|cbfe7e9f2340b0bdccdaa7068e1746c8aa	segun es la uniuon de razas, blancos y negros, o algo asi|`|OPp4aMdjaa	yo se que la cuadricula de ska son cuadros blancos y negros = igualdad racial, ... neta k hay k demostrar que vestirce de punk o ska no significa violencia|`|MwHPW9Utaa	Hola, vamos a ver si entiendo la pregunta.., para empezar.., el ska es un estilo musical originario de Jamaica..,precursor del rocksteady, y mas tarde del reggae.., y la cuadrcula muestra la union entre razas sin diferencias.., por lo que no logro hilvanar la pregunta, quizas si la expresas mas te la pueda responder.., sorry.

AA12116295	Every women is different. It depends on the person and what looks good on them. Some women can look good in both types, other women only look good in one style.     You have to make it work for you and what style you think looks better.

wXloRCegaa	Use a foundation that's silicon based.  Silicon molecules are bigger that your pores so your makeup won't be absorbed into your skin.  Make Up For Ever has a great one.  BUT I recommend a primer.  It's much better for your skin.    I know someone is going to tell you to spray hairspray on your face.  Please don't do that.  You might as well be rubbing your face in dirt.|`|fE1KEqCsaa	When I had my makeup done for a show, the makeup artist used this special fixer for my face.|`|672b5656d0344c959a7f6892a55f88ecaa	set it with a powder|`|yRihCgxaaa	Use powder over foundation. then spritz your face with water. not too much, it will set the makeup nicely.|`|QJ8J9vkIaa	Cosmetic foundations such as powders and liquid foundation are used to create a clear, smooth skin tone - the illusion of seemingly flawless skin texture that will last as long as you desire.|`|A7ovwP94aa	You should set your foundatin with some loose powder.|`|52cHMjiTaa	Nothing will help besides primer. The key is to keep  your face from being oily because it's the oils that break down your foundation... Also don't forget to put power on top of the foundation because that will help set the foundation. YOu can also apply macs fix plus spray on a brush and dab it over your finished face to help set your foundation . I am attaching a link to one of my fav makeup tutorials by makeup geek. Its her face routine (foundation, powder, primer, blush, bronzer, ect)     Good luck...    I wonder why you don't like primers?    Make up artist, esthetician|`|wifucjbXaa	Professional make up brands like Ben Nye and Mehron carry make up sealers, they were formulated for use on stage so that even when performers heavily perspire their make up remains intact.  But they consist of mostly alcohol though and I wouldn't advise it for everyday use, because alcohol is very bad for your skin, and if you use it everyday you can say hello to wrinkles and fine lines :-)    I would look for foundations that claim to be long lasting.  Also, use a primer and finishing powder and when choosing one, take your skin type into consideration. Maybe it's because you have oily skin your make up doesn't last long. If so, I would advise oil absorbing primers and finishing powders, like the rice powder primer from Fyrinnae.  It doesn't dry your skin out so you can even use it on dry skin.  Their primer named ''Fluff' also absorbs oil and gives a soft focus effect (and thus, makes you look more flawless). Coastal scents also carries pure silica powder which works just as great as the HD powder from Make up forever (it's exactly the same product but without the price tag..)  Everyday minerals carries Kaolin finishing powders which also absorbs oil.  Maybe you find a silicone primer works better for you, because it gives the foundation something to stick too. The primer from GOSH is very nice.  Remember, al these product suggestions I just made can be used both as a primer and/or a finishing powder (except for the one from GOSH) you have to try different things and find a balance, see what works for you.    EDIT: I just found out that the mist & fix spray from Make up forever doesn't contain alcohol, so you might want to try that one. MAC also carries a fixing spray but from what I've heard it doesn't fix make up well and is more suitable for you if you want something moisturizing and refreshing.|`|4vhvagF5aa	apply some powder(compact powder is more useful) after foundation apply.

qQqC2cHIaa	I got my ears, tail, mitts and booties at an Anime convention.  If you look for Japanese anime and manga websites and stores they often have lots of cat girl cosplay stuff. if you search for neko neko cosplay you'll find cosplay.com and they have links to stores, I don't know how reliable these places are, but it could be a starting point.  I think there's someone on Etsy who has cat-girl stuff, including bikinis and bras.  KittyKouture on etsy has some really nice ears.  Also you can find some furry outfits on e-bay.  Last and not least, larger costume shops often have secret furry rooms.  Look around where you live for local costume shops in the phone book and call around.

If it is sugar based it will be watter solubel so you can clean it with plain warm water - a damp cloth. Don't poor water all over it, otherwise your wax will get ruined.    Other chemical wax can be cleaned with vegetable oil. Put on tissue paper and clean away. However, use sparingly and since the oil disolves the wax follow with some soap (or clinical alcohol if you have it) to get rid of the oil residue. Wipe dry.|`|K4ml1oSJaa	hahaha

You are doing way way WAY too much to your hair! You have bleached it and now your dying it once a month and applying heat from a blow dryer and flat iron to it everyday???!!!  No wonder its breaking, your really damaging your hair big time.  Stop dying it for a while, and I mean 6 months at least.  Dying your hair is not good for its health anyway, espeally when you do it every month.  And you need to find another style that doesnt require all the heated styling tools. In the meantime you need to begin a deep protein conditioning treatment.  What this consists of is after you wash your hair apply a protein conditioner.  Aveda, Bumble and Bumble, Ojon all have good deep conditioners.  Once you apply the deep conditioner wrap your hair up in a towel and let it sit for 20 minutes then wash it out.  Do this once every two weeks.  Between treatments make sure you are using good salon quality moisturizing shampoos and conditioners.  It might take a while but you should start to see some improvement with the breakage within a few months.  But seriously, you got to stop dying your hair once a month. That's really over doing it.|`|sw2R5A9iaa	get a good cut & quit damaging the hair with color and heat.|`|SGjSk5WTaa	Make sure before you are blow drying your hair you are putting a heat protector in while its wet. And then after you have blown it dry you need to have a heat protecting spray that you spray on each piece before flat ironing it.

You can't do all that and have healthy hair. If you dye it black then there is no need to do it less than every 6 weeks. You should get some of the length cut off and a deep conditioner and use a leave in conditioner. This will help the breakage but theres no way your hair will be healthy.|`|8Bvl7940aa	Dyeing your hair constantly will for sure dry it out and Straighting it everyday really really drys ot and makes it brittle so you should give your hair a rest for a while and i found that somthing called tres a me (sorry About Spelling) but i coloured my hair and stuff and gave it a break from eveything and used that and it helped so much. i have  hair to my mid back

XGo8O6bXaa	No, you should definetly wait!!! It will make your hair fall out. Wait about three to six weeks :)|`|aEpPt9koaa	You need to wait at least two weeks after a relaxer to get color.  I would wait even longer than that because your putting another harsh chemical on top of another.  I would wait more like 6 weeks.|`|dG7mUmVmaa	Hi:<br>  <br>  You need to wait only a week to dye your hair after a perm.|`|lYeFz0hTaa	you should wait atleast two weeks after you get a perm  to dye your hair or it will dry out alottt.

AVzQs5Uhaa	wow these answers just show you how artificial and how many guys really are a*ses. It shouldn't matter if your 130 or 160 or big or small. Id rather have a guy like me for who i am rather then what I look like. Remember your looks can always be changed but your personality cant and who you are as a person. Find and be interested in guys that like you for you and not cuz  ur skinny.big,small boobs or big boobs. If you want to loose the weight to make you feel better and feel better about your self then do it but don't do  it for anyone else or because someone else tells you too. The main thing is that you are comfortable with your body and who you are because guys come and go.|`|e633afd58fd578ab66287bf7228318fcaa	Can't I have one of each..? :O)<br>  <br>  No, I like a girl who is humorous and a little undaunted about those things.

If the 160 pound girl was short and that would make 160 pounds seem fat, i would choose the 130. If both were healthy(same body size) and pretty. I would choose the 160 pounds.

jr5Z03qaaa	to be honest, the best shampoo for dyed hair is the ones at the salon.<br>  <br>  drug store bought shampoo has detergents in them, which cause them to lather more than salon store products.  the detergents often strip the hair of color or even leave a residue that makes the hair "feel" healthy when in actuality it's coating the hair making it heavy and unable to breathe.<br>  <br>  as a professional, the best shampoo out there at a reasonable price would be the matrix biolage series. people often put a lot of shampoo on their hair when not much is needed.<br>  <br>  all you need to do is put a quarter size amount into really wet hair. scrub your scalp, quickly dip your hair back under the shower [don't rinse] and bring the rest towards the ends.<br>  <br>  but the most important product is the conditioner.  the conditioner is not only to get the tangles out but it helps lock in the color, bring the pH level back to normal, and lock in moisture.  it will only work if you follow the directions.  if it says to leave on for 3-5 minutes, leave it on for 3-5 minutes, scrub your body while you wait, your wash your face. it needs to stay in that long to actually work.<br>  <br>  what you can also do is go to your nearest REGIS salon.  there is a sale on the TIGI products.  buy yourself DUMB BLONDE liters [even if it says for bleach blonde hair, it still works great] or even the SUPERSTAR liters.  Their sales is either 2 liters and a sample hairspray for $21.95 - $24.95 or 2 liters for $19.95.|`|BXd4I9mmaa	You need to get a shampoo for color treated hair.  <br>  <br>  There are also tinted shampoo's that you can purchase that will add life and vibrancy to the color. <br>  <br>  Do not get pantene or Aussie. These shampoos have paraffin in them which will wear your hair down and eventually cause it to break off.|`|lU3fBoHfaa	My favorite shampoo for dyed hair is Herbal essences-Color Me Happy. It is amazing and smells good too! Its also won a few best pick choices in magazines such as cosmogirl. Also, make sure you use special conditioner to keep your hair from fading. Have fun with your new hair color :)|`|3GevtCxVaa	aussie. anything by them. they do miraclessss|`|1rgzvS2Vaa	girl or guy?|`|19lTNyyfaa	pantene|`|BFGh2JHzaa	go with one that is free of sulfate.. they arew the best.. anybrand actually.. <br>  <br>  i like coloreesse.. its something like that! lol<br>  <br>  sorry!|`|8a5448c93fd9580270e0448c6cc77673aa	I tried all kinds, even the salon brands, and the best I found was the John Freida collection. You can get it at the drugstore or Walmart. It's the kind that has a different formulas for different hair colors. He has a shampoo, conditioner and a glaze for blonds, reds, brunettes and for black hair. It really helps fading and the conditioner helps improve any damage from the dye. Hope this helps!|`|afX9FlaEaa	welli have blonde highlights and great moisturized hair<br>  <br>  ive tried everything<br>  <br>  I love AUSSIE...just tried it its cheap and im in love it made my hair feel soft and natural i almsot cryed i culdnt believe it.....get the full and soft shampoo and conditioner....and the 3 minute miracle cure it smells like coconut...leave it in for 3 mins while showering...it amazing...<br>  <br>  also if you want an anti color fade....get redkin  color guard...its amazing and well worth the mony...my hair color really did last alot longer|`|szOefQzZaa	depending on what color your hair is there are lots of shampoos for brunettes and blondes or any shampoo for color treated hair works too.|`|9maQMHXFaa	anything that specials in reconstruction because dyeing hair is really bad for it

OHs8yJiOaa	Depends on which ones you're talking about and what your own uses are. Some models would be worth the expense for some people's purposes, but they might not be for others. The sports-related models in particular do tend to be worth it for those who engage in various athletics, for example. Overall, they're probably more functional and a better value -- i.e., worth the expense -- than products made by, say, Chanel or Maui Jim, but those may well better suit the needs of some people out there.|`|yQdA5rHnaa	no.

Also, use ELMER'S GLUE, it is the easiest to do, easiest to wash out, and holds the best!  <br>  <br>  Keep it for a few days but shave it all before the novelty wears off and you seem overly primped.|`|xZ6azOPWaa	LOL @ LEMON T.

ktdMxaGuaa	First, tongue piercings aren't only for oral, it's just another type of piercing with a bad stigma.<br>  <br>  If your mom's issue is with the sex thing then the purity ring might help, but it already seems like she doesn't believe you so there might not be anything you can do. <br>  <br>  On the other hand, a lot of parents just have problems with piercings in general, no matter where or what it is. I don't know you or your mom, so I can't say yes or no that would work. How old are you? In the US a reputable piercer wont pierce anyone under sixteen at all. <br>  <br>  Ask your mom exactly why she doesn't want you to get your tongue pierced, do your research and learn about good piercing hygiene, what makes a good piercer, and who is a reputable piercer in your area. Explain to her why you want to get your tongue done and why you feel you're responsible enough to have it. If she says no then there isn't much you can do about it until you turn 18, but if you take the rejection maturely, and don't throw a tantrum she might be inclined to say yes in the future.|`|Rbbs8TAsaa	Hmm.. i Got my tounge pierced twoDays Ago And it Has Swlled Up Quite ABit. so i Suggest you Do it Withh time Of :)<br>  <br>  <br>  Why The oral Sex tho?<br>  i Dont get it.<br>  But it Mightt Work; youu never Now,<br>  but can youu really not Have Sex till Marriage? <br>  x|`|eX8VYRFXaa	that might be a good reason, but have you thought about the side effects of a toungpiercingng|`|c3eb9cc5af710aa695ddf32e0b5e463aaa	That depends a lot on your mom, and also, maybe, on other things like how old you are, etc.<br>  <br>  I wouldn't let my daughter get her tongue pierced when she was still in school, even though I knew she was training to become a tattooist and piercer when she graduated, because tongue piercings are complicated to heal, and many schools will not allow students to wear their piercings at school -- here, getting caught was an automatic suspension. It had nothing to do with whether she was planning on using it for oral sex... there were a lot of other reasons that were important at the time.<br>  <br>  The purity ring solution only works if the sex issue is the only reason your mom is saying 'no'.
L79EsOyDaa	People with dark brown hair usually look best in dark but bold colours. So like dark purples and greens, but not light, faint colours.<br>  <br>  Dark blond hair can usually get away with a lot of things. But lighter colours tend to match them better, like pinks and blues.<br>  <br>  Hope this helps!

A well dressed person looks good no matter what their height.|`|IW0p51tIaa	Well i think u should wear black jeans and a black hoody or a black skinny top it instantly makes u taller!!!!! <br>  Go to JD,H&M,or even primark!!!|`|QwHLZaS6aa	skinny jeans|`|OzRlHR4Naa	wear heels
lYeFz0hTaa	To make  yourself look taller, you should where any type of clothing that has verical lines in it.  As far as jeans where jeans without the lighter wash to them (solid color). If your comfortable wearing skinny jeans, consider wearing those. Wear jeans with a vertical groove like the pants in this link here:  <a href="http://graphics8.nytimes.com/images/2006/05/04/fashion/07skin.xl.jpg" rel="nofollow">http://graphics8.nytimes.com/images/2006...</a><br>  <br>  You could wear v-neck sweaters such as this:  <a href="https://shop.guess.com/StyleImages/M8360600-CGY-RF.jpg" rel="nofollow">https://shop.guess.com/StyleImages/M8360...</a><br>  <br>  Try your best not to wear prominent horizontal lines.

One is to apply the very disgusting (and therefore, highly successful) nail biting cream like Control It!), which you paint onto your nails. It tastes so bitter you won’t dare bite them. A new product on the market which doesn't taste any better, but is definitely worth trying is Jessica 'Nibble No More,' a no-nail-biting polish with bitter cactus extract as its secret ingredient ($5 at jessicacosmetics.com). <br>  try this site for more info:<br>  stopbitingnails.com|`|oXpTspmhaa	OKAY for that answer below.....

cEuuj70Eaa	Ok first off you want to bleach.  To go lighter with highlights or frosting or anything will require bleach and that is permanent.  Hair dyes are to make hair darker, not lighter.  And it is dyeing your hair.  You forgot the 'e'.  You are not killing it!!  All kidding aside, you might want to ask a hair stylist the best solution.  You can usually ask for tips for just a few pounds/dollars.<br>  <br>  What you want to do..is a permanent change to your hair.  Unless you go with a spray on type of hair paint.  They come in cans like hairspray.  But I really do not think there are any for dark blonde's to become lighter blonde.<br>  <br>  Good luck!! Blissy<3|`|v2P17YuDaa	you must go to hair salon|`|IIztioS3aa	get a semi permanent color. they normally come out in about a dozen washings. check the hair care aisle if your local stores. (anything from cvs to target to your local grocery will carry some hair colors.)

d7bJIgqlaa	I bet your outfit is so cute, but unfortunately it is not considered business casual.  Business casual does not include jeans ...even if you have to look close to tell they are jeans.  You need to wear a pair of slacks (dress pants) or khakis with a nice shirt (not a tee shirt) and dress shoes.

What are you trying to do?<br>  <br>  You cannot save bleach, or colour, for another time.  Once mixed, the chemicals start to work, and will be used up fairly quickly.  You only mix them up immediately before you apply them.<br>  <br>  If you are thinking of a high-lightening shampoo, you will have to look for recipes on-line somewhere.

jr5Z03qaaa	the only way to help split ends is to get routine trims. everytime you cut your hair the ends are blunt like this __. but as everything that is blunt eventually gets dull.  but when hair dulls it gets pointed like this /\, which will cause split ends. the ideal shape is the blunt shape.<br>  <br>  depending on how fast your hair grows you may need to get it trimmed every 2-3 months, about 1 inch off.  but if this is your first time getting your hair trimmed in 5-8 months, you may need to get 2-3 inches taken off depending on how bad your split ends are.<br>  <br>  if a split end is not cut off and reaches to the root of the hair, it will stop growing entirely.<br>  <br>  no matter what type of straightener you use, it will not make your hair healthy.  high heat from a flat iron damages your hair, especially if you already have split ends. i know from experience that split ends worsen when you iron them.<br>  <br>  if you are using a flat iron you need to make investments on salon products, such as a heat protector.  there are great ones out there that protect your hair from thermal damage and keep it healthy.<br>  <br>  also, there's a product by bed head that works great for split ends. it's called EGO BOOST. it's a split end mender and a leave-in conditioner.  you put a squirt of it into your hair while it's still wet, and you can also put a dime size amount on to the ends of your hair after flat ironing.<br>  <br>  also, think of looking into weekly or bi-weekly deep conditioning treatments. those really help a lot, but the only way to see results is to get it done more than 3 times. =]|`|UW5dHiKCaa	Cut it, then get some hydration conditioner.

iLiD8MEKaa	I'm not trying to sound mean, just giving you some advice. <br>  <br>  1. The pictures you put up are bad. You are wearing too much makeup and the angles are bad. Take pictures of yourself wearing no makeup and have your hair pulled back off your face. Take one shot of your face straight on, one profile shot, and one body shot. Try to wear plain clothing like a solid color, fitted t-shirt or tank top, a pair of fitted jeans, and some heels. <br>  <br>  2. You should try to do commercial/catalog/print modeling. They usually take models of all shapes and sizes. <br>  <br>  3. Make yourself a portfolio with your pictures and go to an agency. Don't be disappointed if they turn you down. Every agency looks for something different, so if the first one doesn't like you try another one! <br>  <br>  **Make sure the agency isn't a scam!!!|`|OdDbR4Psaa	You are really pretty, but not quite model material. There are many many young girls who want to be models (trust me, I know) but only a few have the "right" kind of look, which I don't think you have. Sorry.|`|2lqqRcMvaa	You are too short for runway modeling, but maybe try commerical?<br>  <br>  Or, if you have a really good feature, like eyes, lips, nose, ect. you could do certain modeling for that feature.|`|sZMa0s7Baa	I see nothing model-esque about you to be honest.

Sorry to say but you are not very photogenic in those pictures, and there is nothing that stands out and makes people want to keep looking at your photos. Successful models, even commercial ones, have faces that you want to look at for more than a few seconds because they have some unique features.<br>  <br>  it has nothing to do with looks. You are a cute girl, but you don't look like a model|`|v1tHjJ3haa	I don't think so you need longer legs and you're too short for it, my mom used to be a model and I'm too short and I'm 2 inches taller than you and 2 years older to|`|eytlIKITaa	No, not model material...|`|pLcUFBl2aa	Sorry but you're toooooo short.

JT8GYRL0aa	Side fringe, Layers, straightened (: <br>  Make you look older in my opinion. <br>  <br>  Good luck (:|`|IxR6Akpwaa	Shave a bald patch on the crown of your head and shave two lines of hair off above your temples. Then comb any remaining long hair from the side over the top of your head to cover the bald patch. You will then look like a 50 year old man!|`|M6PsYn56aa	Get a side fringe with layers and wear make up :)|`|rjsZ5iOMaa	aa bob|`|y1Jf3LoWaa	I would say get a side fringe, then out your hair up, rather than  leave it down. <br>  Like for e.g. have your hair up in a high ponytail one day, and a bun the next day!<br>  <br>  ^_^ I think that would really suit you! ;)|`|AHHDYeWfaa	chin length bob, its sexy too|`|q8v1jAF2aa	Maybe some kind of bob, like chin length?

MX3wOs1vaa	I'm not sure if you've gone to an actual spray tanning salon, but if you go to a good one, it does not look fake at all.  This is the safest most natural tan for the skin.  What I like best about it is that it does not smell.  Sometimes when you use those sunless tanning lotions, the stench is awful!  The sun and tanning beds are the worst things you can do for your skin.  Not only is it the biggest factor in premature aging, but it causes skin cancer.  As you get older, especially women..once we hit menopause all the exposure that we have had for the sun for example will start to expose itself.  This includes many pigmentation problems like hypopigmentation which is white pigment and hyperpigmentation which are dark spots.  I would recommend that you go to a good spray tanning place.  All this does is react with the protein the skin resulting in a natural tan.  Good Luck!|`|Opz3o8Boaa	Jergens will add tint. No tan is good.

After the ridiculous initial expense(you will need many units) in 4 to 6 months you have to have it done again! and.....ad infinitum!<br>  You can get better, permanent, low cost results with a simple, safe natural treatment that greatly diminishes them and prevents others appearing (see one testimonial below). <br>  With front of first three fingers held together do a horizontal forward and back massage directly on the lines. Starting from one side of forehead, do a series of short forward and back massages blending one into the next all the way to the other side. Do quite vigorously for 20 to 30 times, twice a day. See clearly noticeable fading in about a week to 10 daysl(depending on how vigorous and how frequently you do it). Use any oil.Try it! You will be happy that you did.  <br>  <br>  MESSAGE FROM "big papy"(on ANSWERS):<br>  "thank you mukunda so much i am greatly touched for your concern about my skin. i want you to know that i did continue the massage with tightening the skin around my mouth area and the lines are all most gone thank you soo much, you have changed my life.

It's possible that people might be shocked when you tell them your weight because you're borderline underweight and they're surprised that you only weigh 140 lbs. If you use the BMI (not taking into account how much muscle you have or what your fat percentage is), you have something like 19.0 for your BMI, and anything under 18.5 is considered underweight.|`|1VvKdQMNaa	No I think you are the perfect weight.

aLZoP73Laa	If you're not skinny and you're not fat then you're fine! I'm sick of hearing 'am I too fat? 'am I too thin?' Why can't we all just be happy with how we are? I mean what are our main reasons to lose weight? Because of men, other women? Either way, there are far more important things i life other than our weight. Unless you're morbidly obese - in which case you need to lose weight for health reasons.<br>  <br>  And by the way exercise and eating less rubbish, should be the proper way of dieting, not all these fad diets like Atkins and the zone!|`|f2907226c8519bb899357dc1c4c0e043aa	I think that you actually need to change your opinion of yourself first.  If you are already exercising and eating moderately than you are doing all you can.  You want to be healthy, not skinny.  As a teen and early twenties I was on the chunky side.  I had a very low self opinion and never dated.  I pretty much thought that I was the fat girl who didn't have a chance.  No guy would ever truly want me.  As I got older and started thin out a little (just because of eating smaller portions and exercising a little) I started thinking better of myself.  I only lost about 5 lbs, but it boosted my confidence.  With the boost of confidence, I started to put myself out there more.  Guys noticed and the dates started.  This gave me an even higher confidence.  It was a nice feeling.  If you like yourself it shows and attracts people to you.  A happy person will be a lot more appealing than someone who is obsessive about their weight.  <br>  Relax, keep exercising, be healthy, and most importantly, like yourself.  This will bring you happiness, not being super skinny.  (by the way, after having a baby, I lost a ton of weight and dropped down to a size 3. I have been on both sides of skinny and fat.  Being skinny did NOT make me any happier than I am at a size 7.  Plus, I am now a lot healthier.)  Good luck!|`|AQ3sgTZFaa	well you dont want to be too skinny so that your anarexic an you dot want to be so fat that your obese so i would say middle is normal and probably perfect. but if you do want to get a little thinner for a snack you could eat a food that takes more calories to eat than it gives you when you eat it, also protein and dairy products are good for diets even though you said you were on a diet i was just trying to help, but more excersise like you said not to talk about, to be honest is not that effective unless you do long sessions of intense excersise which i think you wouldnt like.|`|Z549nOvgaa	This might sound weird... but it worked for me!  Drink Lipton Diet Green Tea.  When it first came out I loved it, drank it all the time!  I love food (especially when I'm bored), I'm a snacker!  When I started drinking it, I wasn't as hungry anymore... I ate lunch/dinner, and a snack here and there... but way smaller portions.  I quit drinking it for awhile b/c it's kind of pricey (I was a poor college student and drinking them all the time).  But I started drinking them again recently and I've lost like 6 lbs in 2 weeks.  Hopefully this helps!|`|ThDMrFiSaa	That's what I am.... Its pretty nice for me! if you Truly want to lose some weight, take a run in the morning and in the afternoon. Try to eat lighter and eat more fruits. Carry a spare granola bar with you every hour. I hope I helped some!|`|JQRjub1baa	eat moderately ,stop eating fast food,oily food,and too much bread<br>  and exercise but remember that being skinny is not a good idea it effects <br>  your health and u get easily then sick  so keep everything in moderation!<br>  <br>  hope this answers yr questin!|`|uhQJwWGyaa	its wonderful.

4gAaNAuwaa	no no no no no. i am 16 years old and had mild  acne before i used proactive. it wasnt anything seriously bad. just stubborn acne on my chin and forehead and the occasional stubborn pimple somewhere else. also once a month it broke out a little more than usual. but i wanted it gone so i decided i would use proactive. i used it for one month. it made my acne worse than it has ever been. i could not believe that something that is supposed to work so good made my skin so bad. i kid you not when i say that there is not one square inch of my skin that is not covered in acne or red marks from acne now. it is absolutely HORRIBLE. when i started proactive i only had acne on my forehead and chin. now it is COVERED MY ENTIRE FACE. it is horrible. i cannot use enough makeup. it literally now takes me 45 minutes to do my face in the morning. and it still looks bad. proactive RUINED my face and the scars from past acne are more noticeable than ever. i dont want to go out in public anymore i am still in shock that my face looks like this. even my mom said that proactive made my skin worse. now im waiting for my dermatologist appt. and i really hope they can help to nurse my skin back to how it was. proactive also drys your skin out so bad i still cant get enough lotion on my face. this was absolutely the worst thing that i have ever used. proactive ruined my life.|`|N42wHIbuaa	To be quite honest i think it has to do with your skin type. B/c i've had people that i know use it & some of them said it doesn't work & others say it does work. but i personally can't tell you. <br>  <br>  Hope this helps. :)|`|33ad7557ca0d7c2188f6f4d4f5e9f6bbaa	It all depends on your skin type and how regular you are in using it. Personally, it didn't work. But I have numerous friends that have tried it and it's worked wonders. Why not give it a shot?|`|SZDPqdDkaa	no it dont i used it for one year and i just made me break out more|`|LPEWAoWCaa	Nope, it totally destroyed my skin! I went to the dermatologist andhe gave me a $10 prescription that gave me beautiful skin.|`|9HN78kUwaa	everyone i know who used it said it didnt work
cXQmtN1Saa	Yessss it's true.. but it's kind of a big hassel.<br>  1) It really dries out your skin (face, hands, and lips).. like you'd need to make sure you use a really good moisturizer and chapstick everytime you rinse your face with the mixture. <br>  2) If you get the slightest big in your eyes, it's gunna hurt BADLY.<br>  3) The front pieces of your hair will definitely end up getting lightened (either in the sun or with the heat of your hairdryer) because of the lemon juice. lol.<br>  <br>  Idontknow, I couldn't stick to this routine very long even though it did start clearing up my skin. My lips even got so dry after 4days that layers started peeling off (which really hurt and looked gross) so yeah. <br>  <br>  hope this helps. :]

IIztioS3aa	does it only poof when you straighten it? Your hair could just need some moisture from the damaging heat of the flat iron. try adding a heat protectent before you straighten, if you don't use any product when you do straighten maybe just adding a little gel to your hair will fix it.<br>  <br>  try a deep conditioner, something to protect it from heat. use some product before you dry it then straighten it. if all else fails get a anti-frizz product like the frutics sleek and shine or frizz ease.

8QhPUxllaa	Aw! That sounded quite cute :]<br>  Okay i say:<br>  Hair up, a low mess bun<br>  Black trousers with a nice smart top or a shirt.  Your ballet pumps sound fine or some nice heels.<br>  Your coat sounds nice so wear that and don't button it!  Then when you go in take it off but try and not make a big deal about taking it off.  Or while you wait take it off.<br>  Keep your nails natural and nicely done.  Maybe clear nail vanish?<br>  I say natural make up, nothing too heavy but still look nicely made up.<br>  Good luck, try and be yourself and you will do well :]|`|CpNVSJpmaa	Black trousers and pumps sound perfect , wear a blouse or a shirt in white , black or dark grey , a nice necklace would make it look more unique and personal .<br>  You can wear a coat and just take it off as you go in the door and lay it on the back of your chair.<br>  If you bite your nails just dont paint them , it would look more natural.<br>  Natural make up is always a good idea , a slick of lipgloss is all you really need. <br>  Wearing your hair in a soft ponytail or bun would make you look more professional.|`|JztyFYEnaa	You sound nervous. Wear your hair down but pull some back so they can see your face. The rule to job interviews is always dress one step nicer than the person interviewing you. So the black pants and black heels sound good. Wear a top the covers the girls and have it be a color that you are confident in. You can wear the coat if you want but take it off when you get in.Paint your nails and wear minimal makeup. GOOD LUCK!|`|dAQGAUJLaa	Wear (if you have one) a baby blue scoop neck tee that looks super cute! The black baby doll heels sound really cute!

6fAZfZ74aa	The problem is, you are going out and buying these cleansers and things, and you don't know what the ingredients will do to your skin. I have had the same problem, so eventually, i went to the doctor, and i didn't realize how much they could help. They gave me medication, one to put directly on my skin, and one in pill form, and now i literally have no trace of a pimple.

Soaps should be avoided as they may cause irritation on your skin. Cleansers are useful because they help your skin to heal itself while you are sleeping <br>  <br>  Acne cleansers contain benzoyl peroxide or salicyic acid in order to fight pimples. The best treatment is cleansing the skin with a benzoyl peroxide or salicylic acid cleanser, applying an alphy hydroxy, and finally using a toner. <br>  <br>  It is recommended that cleanser must be used gently with soft hands and scrubbing must be avoided in order to prevent irritation and reddishness. Acne Cleansers are thick and rich like yogurt and leaves a very creamy and silky effect on the face. It makes you feel fresh and bright throughout the day. Some acne cleansers have a very light medicinal scent fragrance, which is not at all unpleasant. Acne Cleansers must be shaken before use and applied in the form of massage onto your face in circular motions. When applied these cleansers also produce foams and bubbles, which leaves a very refreshing effect on the skin. <br>  <br>  To prevent acne and acne scars use cleanser once at night but avoid cleansers with alcohol, which will leave your skin dry and dehydrated.|`|rduazivPaa	This may sound funny, but I'm being serious:-<br>  Mix pure, freshly squeezed strawberry juice with water, so that there is 1/4 strawberry juice and 3/4 water and wash your face with that. After you have done that, cleanse your face again with just water. Do this once a day as a daily routine and you will see a difference.It really works, I do it every other week.<br>  Hope this helps. :)|`|0EtUahsRaa	Acne Free works great I had really bad acne and had tried alot of them out there and they broke me out more But acne free works|`|1430ca2d3d29baf8526ae34c2e2eaedeaa	Neosporin.|`|Md07JyI7aa	7 molar Hydrochloric Acid.<br>  <br>  takes the acne right off.<br>  <br>  and the skin under it, too...|`|iv5O5J2Laa	Anythang that works for you.|`|0816304797066153784f125d3c7f1337aa	i use clearasil but it honestly depends what works 4 u cause ive tried different ones and some of them make it worse, so u need to experiement and c which 1 suits ur skin type...|`|OfD5nurNaa	lava soap or any other soap that is gritty, it helps to clean the pores out even better than regular soap|`|ivhnVbbraa	pro active solution|`|p5cYEPASaa	Warm water<br>  If bad: <br>  warm water, with white bread, and baking soda|`|TIh05VKraa	"I heard semen works real well"<br>  <br>  It's not a joke, my face has been clear for years!|`|85PReKnIaa	pro active|`|D6Nm5cAvaa	pro active dude

jr5Z03qaaa	if you are going blonde, and don't have ANY color on your hair what so ever. use the LIGHTEST ash blonde that you find.  Ash will prevent your hair from turning orange.<br>  <br>  but if you do have color on your hair, even from 2 years ago and your hair is past your shoulders, see a professional.  because color cannot lighten color.<br>  <br>  you may need to get loads of highlights in order to get your hair blonde.|`|dc49d60c4d19a92e193ce2f41c92cfedaa	probably. depends on the dye but you're better off bleaching it first|`|6UKd0Gedaa	probably depending on what shade brown and if its your natural colour or if its dyed|`|dSpg5m01aa	Yes very true.<br>  To go blonde you would really need to have your hair stripped of it original colour, then blonde dye applied.<br>  This needs to be done professionally.<br>  If you box dye it at home you will be sorry.|`|mD4Xn3jNaa	no, if you have red hair it will only make it go redder<br>  <br>  if you have brown hair it will go blonde<br>  <br>  but make sure you get the color everywhere|`|Hek7MUNYaa	i was blonde many times so i went for dark brown irish look with sexy light blue eyes and everyone tells me i look HOT<br>  <br>  so just go for it|`|6nW0eSQ7aa	defo|`|kvCdRzzBaa	Make sure you go somewhere profesinal, even so you never no whats going to happen.

I had really long hair and to this day, its been almost 2 years my hair is still really damaged. Tips: go somewhere really perfesinal, only get the whole thing died once, then from there get just the roots died, and really think about it before you do it. GoodLuck! :)|`|kXesp8EHaa	It's happened to me before with one of those home-dying kits.<br>  But if you get a professional to bleach it, then it won't, because bleach takes away the natural chemical in your hair that makes it have colour, instead of covering up your colour then fading with time.

But with roots...|`|YN0DdLVlaa	How dark is your hair?<br>  <br>  If its very dark then it would probably go ginger. <br>  You would have to use a lot of bleach..which is very damaging for your hair and expensive to keep up with.<br>  <br>  Why not go to the hairdressers and get some highlights?|`|1ef783bf47b87eab548df2f0856383a9aa	If you bleach it then it will like a white-blond and if not it might turn yellowish.<br>  <br>  Bleaching isn't the best but hey it'll work.<br>  <br>  <br>  For the best results you should get it professionally done.|`|yVDaoZTpaa	not sure.<br>  but if you could live with blonde hair do it!<br>  answer mine? thanks<br>  <a href="http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;_ylt=Aupoxa645Y5rvuS08b8hROLsy6IX;_ylv=3?qid=20090219122559AAxvaJ0">http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;...</a>|`|sKCxxdNBaa	no not leash you keep it sarita it all the time|`|2An1XVQxaa	yeah its going to turn to ginger so don't dye it blonde|`|wajI2ACLaa	If it's your natural hair colour then it should be fine.<br>  Even if it isn't its also fine.<br>  My natural hair colour is black and I dyed it brown then I decided to go all blonde as well.<br>  I dyed it about 3 or 4 times for it to be proper blonde.<br>  Use XXL Live Absolute Platinum hair dye.<br>  I don't think its bleach so it doesn't really damage your hair.<br>  And this way is much cheaper as well.<br>  Just look after your hair with hair products and your hair should be fine.<br>  <br>  And go for it, dont have doubts.<br>  You only live once LOL|`|3bysSXBZaa	hello:), i have quite dark mousy hair naturally. i went through a stage of having DARK brown hair on the bottom and blonde on top.

I even had it done at a hairdressers. be careful though as it will go dry if you go quite light, natural blonde with different highlights will be fine as long as you condition it, use keep in conditioner, and heat protection hair products. hope this is as help. x|`|BXd4I9mmaa	It will most likely turn to a ginger color if you try to lift your hair color lighter with an at home kit. <br>  <br>  The reason for this is - legally stores cannot sell a bleach with a higher volume of lift. The usual volume is 15% which just isn't enough to get to a true blonde.|`|O1G31WMPaa	Most of the time it will "go ginger".  However, you can use hydrogen peroxide and get it truly blonde.  <br>  <br>  I recommend you use a rinse at first, just to see.  Coloring your hair always causes at least minor damage to your hair.|`|d4BPoMPwaa	no it wouldnt i've got brown hair and dye it blonde allll the time!<br>  go to the hairdresses and have it done properly then it definetly will not go round ;)|`|3GevtCxVaa	use hair lightener,<br>  you'll probs have to do it twice depending on how dark your brown is,<br>  if you dont it will go ginger yeah|`|8D5trv2Oaa	Try highlights. Their blonde but still you'll have streaks of brown left too. I think that this will look better, then it shouldn't go ginger :)|`|UoA099Rwaa	yes probably. go sumwere professional or keep a botle of brown hair dye handy in case it all goes wrong.

There are very dark deep reds in most company lines.  Talk to your hair colourist about that.  They have colour swatches and pictures, if you needed that.  Check with several companies because they all don't have the same darkness, and some have a more plum than a red.  It all depends on what colour of hair you are starting out with.<br>  <br>  btw, you probably won't be able to find a dye in that shade. Dye, as you know, is only for fabrics, and it could do something to hair, but you won't be very satisfied with the results.

AA11101361	Toner removes excess cleanser and prepares your skin for moisturizing.  Some toners have other ingredients: moisturizing, acne fighting, etc.  There's no such thing as opening or closing pores.  Pores, like eye color, are inherited.  You can mask their appearance with makeup and temporarily alter their appearance with heat (relaxing) and cold (constriction).<br>  Application depends on the type of toner, some are sprays, which you spray all over your face.  Some are meant to be applied with a cotton ball or round.  They are not meant to go near your eyes or on your lips.  For under eye circles you would want to find an eye cream that treats that particular problem.|`|qPfhXZw0aa	Toner cleanses the skin even more and closes the pores so that no bacteria can get in them and cause pimps :) All you need to do is put a few drops on a cotton ball and put a thin layer over your skin after cleansing, exfoliating, and then masking. You should not apply it to your eye area... you shouldnt need to. xoxo.
