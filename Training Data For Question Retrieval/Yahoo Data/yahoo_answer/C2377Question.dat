20090226162304AAPJ2Cd	Education & Reference;Homework Help	Good essay?i pick best answer!?	Schools should require students to wear uniforms. Uniforms will save money, save time, and students will no longer strive to keep up with the latest trends. Uniforms can make a big difference.   School uniforms can help parents save money. You will no longer dress to impress. While some clothing styles go out of fashion, uniforms will not they will stay the same. If there are uniforms you wont have to buy school clothes, you also wont have to buy clothes for different seasons like for the winter and summer. Families in which a child wears a school uniform are generally favorable about school uniform policies. Over half believe they save money on cloths and 44% believe that their children are more focused on learning. ( http://www.dickies.com/web/school/facts....    If students wore uniforms they would not waste time wondering what to wear. Fourteen year old George Berganza says, “ with uniforms you don’t have to think about competition. You don’t have to think about labels or if your wearing something to often.” (Cruz) Parent and principle Nora Rosensweig says, “ From a parents standpoint, I’d love it for my own child because I get tired of arguing about what to wear in the morning.” (Cruz) President Bill Clinton visited Long Beach, California and spoke to the students at Jackie Robinson Academy. Uniforms he said, “slowly teach our young people one of life’s most important lessons: what really counts is what you are and what you can become on the inside, not what you are wearing on the outside.(Cruz)   School uniforms make it easier for students. They will no longer have to keep up with the latest trends. Some students follow the trends because they want to be cool, to fit in, be popular, low self-esteem, and to not be the odd one out. ( http://www.smart  girl.org/reports/5445986.html)   Students should wear uniforms. They help save money, save time, and students will no longer have to keep up with the latest trends.      its bad but i tries so if u could help me fix this up espically with the last to paragraphs,that would be great!

20090226165451AAr3oFu	Education & Reference;Teaching	Why don't teachers care?	Not all of them...but I have like 3 teacher that just don't care about their students. Like, my Spanish teacher for example, she just gives us vocab, then notes, then worksheets. We do all the work our selves and she does nothing but sit on her but and mess around on her computer. Then she goes over the stuff by just giving us the answers. I have a 97 in that class because I memorize my vocab, study my notes, and do my worksheets and pay attention when she goes over the answers. Most of my class is failing or barely passing.       Also my art teacher is a different kind of example. I used to be one of her favorite student at the beginning of the year. She would always talk to me and use me as examples and stuff. She was also one of my favorite teachers. Gradually though, she stopped talking to me, using me as examples and she has started to diss my art work. My art work/style/whatever has not changed, it's gotten better in everyone else's opinion, including the other art teacher(there are two). Now she doesn't speak to me at all, and she grades my work bad, like B's and C's rather than A's, which I deserve because I work very hard on everything I do unlike all the other people who do a five minute sketch and then a ten minute project and get 100's on stuff. It's like she's just stopped caring that I even exist or try.      And then my science teacher is just a butt who doesn't care, we just teach ourselves in that class.

20090226163938AArcY09	Education & Reference;Standards & Testing	What would my weighted GPA be with these grades?	These are all honors classes:      English: A   Spanish: A-   History: A-   Geometry: B+   Art: A   Physics: A-      The way we do it at my school is, you raise it up two grades for every honors class, and then you average all them together. For example, if you have an A- in honors, it counts as an A+ in regular. If you have a B+ it counts as an A in regular, etc. Soo what would my GPA be then? I'm sorry about the confusion, I was unaware there were different systems.       Oh, and we use a 5.0 scale as well.      And another thing: art doesn't count as honors credit (even though I am taking it honors... : )

I am in my third year of college (2 more to go because I changed majors) and Im thinking about living on campus.  So far Ive been living with my parents and my school is more than hour drive away (each way), which sucks.  The problem is, I'd have to take out about 15,000 dollars in private loans to pay for these two years of living on campus (Im already using all the federal grants and loans i can get and I have an academic scholarship).  I want to live on campus because i think it would make my life a whole lot easier without the long commute and i think it'd help my social life which is practically nonexistant.  Im just really worried about the student loans.  I already owe 5000 dollars in federal loans, so altogether i'd end up owing around 20,000.  My major is computer science which sounds like it has good job prospects, but you never know.  Can anyone give me some advice?

20090226173319AA9AIDC	Education & Reference;Teaching	Do you like the beginning of the story my thirteen-year-old daughter wrote?	My brother is a genius.    Most people don’t believe me when I say that. They call me delusional, but I know better. And if you think I’m making it up, ask my mom or my dad.    The average person’s IQ is 100. If you have an IQ over 150, you’re automatically a genius. Matthew’s IQ is 184.    Matthew’s my little brother. He’s seven – three years younger than me, and we’re best friends. He’s memorized every Fibonacci number up to 12 586 269 025 and every prime number up to 3 125 672 873. He can do a hundred piece puzzle in four minutes and thirty-eight seconds. I know because when I was eight and he was five, I gave him my hundred piece Beauty and the Beast puzzle to look at and timed him as he put it together.    My brother is better at math than anyone I know, including my teacher. Sometimes I have him “help” me with my math homework, because he’s even better than a calculator. I’ve tried really hard equations with him like 256 x 397 and without a moment’s hesitation, he replied, “101 632.” And even with questions on my math sheet that had me stumped, like 789 2 (we were supposed to multiply it out, but why should I bother when I have Matthew, a.k.a. the human calculator, here to help me?), and he didn’t have to think for a moment before telling me the answer was 622 521.    I’m the only one who really understands my brother. He doesn’t speak – he’s never in his entire life said a single word, other than when he hums or answers mathematical equations. That drives my parents crazy – at first they thought he was doing it deliberately, but after awhile they accepted that something was seriously wrong and switched gears so fast it made my head spin. In its own way, that was even worse. My parents put Matthew into a million different therapies, mostly speech therapies. They convinced themselves that something was wrong with what they were doing, and set out to “fix” him and make him “normal”.    But not me. I accept my brother for who he is, and understand him better than anyone else does in the whole wide world.    One time when Matthew was six, he was filling out a multiple choice math sheet in class – easy questions like 4 + 5 and 7 – 3. There were forty of them, and he got every single one wrong.    There was no doubt in anyone’s mind that he’d done it on purpose. As his teacher put it, “If I actually believed that Matthew didn’t know the answers and merely guessed randomly, theoretically he would have still got between eight and twelve questions right. But he didn’t get any correct. Not a single one.”    No one understood why he’d done it. They drove themselves crazy trying to wrap their heads around it – was he rebelling against them? Had something gone wrong? Was this some kind of insane thing geniuses did?    It was somewhat amusing to watch them fumble around for an answer, actually. Only I understood, floating obliviously above the chaos, watching from up high. With my brother, sometimes there is no “logical” reasoning behind the things he does. Matthew tends to follow his heart rather than his head, and this was just another example. To him – and to me – it made perfect sense; he got all those questions wrong to prove he could. He was experimenting and testing boundaries in his own way, as all young children do. Matthew was so used to easily acing math tests that he wanted to see what would happen if, for once, he didn’t.    Another time, when Matthew was five and I was eight, we were at the lake. Our dad gave us permission to hike for a bit by ourselves as long as we didn’t get too close to the water and stayed together.    Matt and I went for a walk in the woodsy area, which wasn’t quite a forest but could have easily been mistaken for one. I didn’t let go of Matthew’s hand, even as I climbed up the gigantic jagged rocks with edges as sharp as broken glass and he scrambled up after me.    Then we came to the old abandoned pirate ship. It actually wasn’t a pirate ship, just an old canoe, but I had a very vivid imagination and made believe it was special and that it was a pirate ship. Matt always just went along with me.    I let go of my brother’s hand for just a minute. I jumped down from the rock at the boat, turning back to my brother and yelling to him to stay where he was. I didn’t know how safe this area was, and figured if one of us was going to get hurt, better it be me than Matthew.    I took one step on the curved boulder, then another, carefully balancing so as not to fall into the swirling, wild waters below. I took a third step and a fourth, and then – I lost my footing! I slipped and tumbled into the deep, icy waters.    Struggling to float and gasping for air, I screamed. Panicking, splashing around wildly, I prayed that someone would come save me before I drowned. Even though I knew how to swim, I wasn’t particularly adept, and especially not in raging waters as cold and deep as this one.

20090226185710AAPK1HR	Education & Reference;Primary & Secondary Education	Teacher got fired because of "us" students.?	This is a kind of long story so i will try to shorten it up. Im in middle school, and in the beggining of the school year, i had this science class and a really big teacher.A lot of students drove him crazy, and made fun of him because of his weight. All his classes would make his life hell. He would CRY (so you know this really bad was). Everyone would piss him off. At first the students were all making him really angry, but then they started taking it to far, like stealing his stuff, spitting on him, cutting the phone cord in the class, and even putting some kind of staining stuff on this hair so when he would sit down. They would also rip up all the sciene books and throw him papers. I guess he couldn't keep up with us and couldnt handle us anymore because he would always cry.    But anyway today we were in class and the vice principal and principal came in and took the teacher with them. And they had told him he was fired because he couldn't control us. When we found out that thanks to "us" all the students, we had caused him his job. Nobody tought it would actually go this far. And today a teacher that we all love came in and gave us a long lecture that we should all be ashamed of our selfs, that why did we treat him like cr*p when he never did anything to hurt us. That he was their to teach us and gain our respect, when all we did was treat him like ****. Now the teacher had to find a new job to support his family (he has 2 little girls and one little boy). So many students in the class started crying, because we couldnt believe what we did, caused his job.    Now all of us are only 8th graders and have to learn from our mistakes, and i know we all f*cked up really bad! We want to know if there is anyway to get the teacher back. Is their anything we can do?! ?We  realized he was there to help US in our education, and we ruined his job. And now he will no longer be back. We wish we could go back in time but we all know we cant do that. So we want to know if their is anything we can do to get him back, or not to feel guilty anymore?         Thanks to everyone who answers, i know this is really long. And it was wrong for us to do what we did.

I started at a small community college for my education and later decided to look into finishing up a four year degree. The community college had only a few options as far as one elective slot went and it got filled with a creative writing class.      Not being very useful I decided that maybe I should take a much better elective at the university since they have more to offer. The creative writing class is one that transfers over for credit. I, however, only received a B in the creative writing class.

Okay, the assignment was a persuasive essay, with 3 reasons you're right, a counterarguement, and transition words in the beginning of each paragraph. In the 8th grade, I know its long, please read, tell me what you think?         Refine Oil Safely, Refine Lives.   Help oil refineries put danger in check    When you think “oil refinery” you think “big factory that pollutes the air, and makes the road smell.” Right? Well, chew on this, have you ever thought about the people in those plantations? How about the work that goes into processing your oil? Have you bothered to notice the dangers behind those pipes? Who breathes the smoke emitted from the towers you watch from the freeway? The brave, intelligent, skilled, hard-working, alert, on-task refinery workers, that’s who. You wouldn’t believe the types of things they go through every single day. The hazards in oil refineries should be completely eliminated. They are working way too hard and way too long in a day. Not only does all of this have a short-term effect on the workers, but a negative long-term effect to their health. They are spending a lot of precious time away from their families, and their lives are at stake! We must do everything in our power to do away with all dangers in oil plantations.    Did you know that a refinery worker will work what’s called “seven twelve’s”? That’s twelve hours a day, seven days a week! With the amount of hard labor they must perform to keep the machines running, the heavy equipment they must wear and use, and the horrible air quality they must deal with every day, these hours are way too much! Have you ever heard the expression, “History repeats itself”? Well, back in the early 1800’s, the “Lowell Girls” worked in cotton plantations where dangerous machines and horrible air quality threatened their lives. These girls put their lives in danger just so they could get a little more money than some of the other destitute women. Strikes and trade unions formed to improve working conditions, and a woman named Sarah G. Bagley worked to lessen the hours  from 12-14 to 10. Even ten was a lot! Here is a quote from one of the Lowell girls from The Diaries of the Lowell Girls: “We work for long hours all the time, and the machines are deafening. All the girls in my unit have the cough. One of the girls next to us died because her hair was not fastened, and was ripped from her scalp by the machine. The others say it was the blood that killed her.” This example from the past shows how dangerous the plantations were. Must the same rebellious behavior take place to ensure safety of the people in our modern-day plantations?     Not only do the plantation workers have to endure hard-working, long hours for months at a time; creating muscle, bone, breathing, and other dangerous problems, but the refinery leaves permanent scars on its tenders. How so? The chemicals, gases, and smoke create horrible health hazards-resulting in early death. Cancers of the lungs, heart, and brain are just a few long-term effects. The same happened with the Lowell Girls. Our society is much better than it was in the 1800’s! To have the same dangerous working conditions is ridiculous! Our men and women do not deserve to suffer from cancers, lung problems, organ failure, and poisoning! Anyone who knows of these unethical conditions and doesn’t do everything in their power to improve them is sick! Our community must come together and put a stop to this nonsense and sickness.    In addition, people’s lives are at stake! One wrong step, one wrong move, one inch too far, and they’re dead. For example, S2S monitors are required by anyone walking or working in an active unit. If somebody walks into a cloud of S2S, they drop dead on the spot. A monitor is even required so that when a certain chemical is detected, it will warn the others to get out of the area. Why? Once the chemical is detected, the person wearing the monitor is already considered dead. There are “watch men” required outside a building at all times so that if somebody drops inside, there will be someone who isn’t exposed to the source to warn everybody else.  There are also “mile-highs” or the towers you see from the freeway that have only a ladder up the side to get up and down! Is this not dangerous? When a worker goes up, if he/she drops their hard-hat, the person below them is dead. Do you see the life-threatening conditions faced every day by our beloved family members?    Lastly, there may be many safety precautions such as M.S.D.S.’s (Material safety data sheets) that explain the hazards in an area, how to avoid them, protect yourself, and responding procedures. There is also the required P.P.E. (Proper protective equipment) such as certain clothing, hard hats, steel toed boots, air equipment, and monitors. These precautions are hardly enough! Benzene, Aragon, and Sodium Chloride are just a few deadly agents, not to mention S2S. Heavy machinery, high towers, dangerous surroundings and equipment…these

Peace! It was the owl that shrieked, the fatal bellman, / Which gives the stern'st good-night. He is about it.”       “I heard the owl scream and the crickets cry.”      “New hatched to the woeful time. The obscure bird / Clamored the livelong night. Some say the Earth / Was feverous and did shake.”      “A falcon, tow'ring in her pride of place, / Was by a mousing owl hawked at and killed.”      “Ere the bat hath flown / His cloistered flight, ere to black Hecate's summons / The shard-borne beetle with his drowsy hums / Hath rung night's yawning peal, there shall be done / A deed of dreadful note.”      “Light thickens, and the crow / Makes wing to th' rooky wood.”      “Eye of newt and toe of frog, / Wool of bat and tongue of dog, / Adder's fork and blind-worm's sting, / Lizard's leg and owlet's wing, / For a charm of powerful trouble, / Like a hell-broth boil and bubble.”      “And what will you do now? How will you live? / As birds do, Mother / What, with worms and flies?”      “Poor bird! Thou 'dst never fear the net nor lime / The pitfall nor the gin.”      “The devil damn thee black, thou cream-faced loon!”      “Where got'st thou that goose look?”       “There is ten thousand / Geese, villain?

I have yet to take my SAT/ACT (June), so I can not post my stats.      I do have teachers that offered letters of rec, so I am okay in that sense.

If anyone has any suggestions of what I can do as of now to improve my chances, please, let me know.      Thank you for the time.      Best Regards!

Photography is the art of using light rays to form an image on a light sensitive material. Photography is often more than just taking a photo with a camera, it is about creating something that is aesthetically pleasing. Photography is about the entire process from finding the object to photograph, framing the photograph, processing the image and presenting the image.       Why is photography important and valuable?      Cultural reasons      for artisitics purposes, photography can be considered as a pure aesthetic art form that combines shapes forms inlcuding the interplay of light and shadow.      Technological reasons      Photography has had a profound effect on new technological developments in terms of the kinds of equipment used in photography. In particular the advancement of digital technologies. It has impacted on storage of photographic images by the development of compression of digital image data such as the JPG format.      How is photography classified?      How is photography classified? The different types of photography.      Photography comes in a wide range of forms from Amateurs happily snapping pics of friends and family, Special Occasion photographers ie weddings, Sports Photography, Wildlife Photography. Fashion Photography.      How to take photographs      What are the things you need to consider when taking photographs?      Equipment       The type of camera - film or digital , the number of megapixels    The types of lenses- low f-stop lenses are generally best, eg about f2.8    Settings      The type of film - the ISO setting, the lower ISO the finer the grain.    The type of light - low light, bright light. The white balance(mainly for digital cameras)    A useful reference is from photosecrets.com       Composing a photo is about getting an interesting form of balance that perhaps evokes something more from the viewer.      The type of lense has an effect also.         These swans for example were taken with a zoom lense, notice that the back ground water is unfocused also.                 A macro lense allows you to focus on objects very close up. Do you notice a bee in the fine flower?      Depth of field is an important aspect of photography. This is about what is and is not in focus in the final printed image.           Maximum depth of field as in the left picture is when most of picture is in focus from the forground to the background.                   Minimum depth of field is when only a small part of an image is in focus, ie a portrait of person with the person's face in focus but the background a bit blurred out.       The blurred background is sometimes also called Bokeh

20090226185137AA3mh45	Education & Reference;Higher Education (University +)	Where should I go to nursing school?	Getting into nursing school (i.e., two-year community college ADN/RN program) these days is akin to what medical school admissions was like 20 years ago!  There are a number of factors driving the competition for spaces in nursing programs, and chief among them is that nursing/allied health sciences is the last frontier where a person can earn a living wage and not have to worry about his or her job being shipped overseas by some greedy, shitty American corporation.  So, a lot of middle, and upper-middle-class, white students with money and rich parents are flooding the schools and exacerbating the competition (you know how us white folk do -- we move into a neighborhood, send our kids to a certain school, and suddenly everything costs thousands of dollars more...), while immigrant students, many of whom are not even citizens, are snapping up financial aid and scholarships.  At least, this is what is going on out here in the West in Oregon, Washington, and California.      Are there any states LEFT in this country who's education coffers haven't been sucked dry by non-citizen immigrants, and who has nursing programs one can actually get into without waiting 5 years?   Please let me know.  I heard Nebraska, the Dakotas, Idaho, New Mexico, are among the last refuges for quality, affordable education in this country.

I am unemployed right now and have little chance of being employed, since my mother is currently dying, and I have to stay in her small home town for the time being.        My first private loan payment for the amount of $750 is due in a few weeks.  I barely have that much in the bank right now.  There is absolutely no way for me to some anywhere near making that payment.      Is there any way to avoid having my credit demolished?  They can't garnish my wages, since I don't have any wages.  But I also don't want my credit score destroyed.        What can I do at this point?  They rejected my application for more forbearance time.  They know I can't pay the loan, but they are demanding it anyway.        Should I just kill myself?  Death apparently discharges the entire debt.  I owe $95,000.

I was on schedule for your class, but there was an unexpected train delay on the six train that prevented me from attending your class on time (which is why I was late to your class this evening). I finally caught the train, but by the time I was able to arrive to the Bronx Campus it was already 5:50 PM.  I read your syllabus that you provided every student with at the beginning on the semester, and I am aware of your attendance policy: more than two (2) absences will negatively affect your grade. I would like to report that I only have two (2) absences to your class; however, I spoke with a fellow student of your class, Yusef,  and he mentioned to me: that even though unforeseen things do come up, it would be polite to e-mail the professor about the reason why you were late for class. Once again, I would like to apologize for being late to your class, and I will not allow this to happen again.
20090226192841AA71eIl	Education & Reference;Primary & Secondary Education	How is this intro to a story (10th grade,english extra credit)?	Its a bit dark and will be as I continue.      I used this as a prompt:   "Wake up...Wake up and...smell the ashes.   They tried to bury their sins, but instead    planted the seeds of their doom.    A war is coming.    I've seen it in my dreams.    Fire sweeping over the earth,    bodies in the streets,    cities turned to dust.    Retaliation."   --------------------------------------...                  The cityscape was barren,deserted. Fires filled the sky and smoke billowed from every pore of most buildings. He was in such pain...His vision blurred to the point of seeing only a few feet directly infront of him. An uneven gate as he trudged along breathing heavily all the way. The man turned a corner and continued on. His Lab Coat was bloodstained and his glasses had been cracked and shattered leaving only the mangeled and twisted form of their rim lying over his beaten and swolen face.                 His hand was clenched to his chest where deep within was the bullet that had wounded him so. His aggressor had been killed not by his own hands but of whoms he was not sure. One momment the man was upon him-beating him to the ground only to fire a pistol into his chest and the next all that remained of the man was a charred skeleton seemingly drowned in a puddle of its own blood. The whispering was stuck in his head. Something had said something as he looked at that skeleton.Indistinguishable and pointless ,no doubt, but menacing and evil in its own right.                 Again and again he stumbled and fell to the ground as he walked. Each time it was harder and harder for him to stand once again. He kept on walking and slowly he found that he didnt know where he was walking but felt he was moving in the right direction whatever that may be. Eventually only small buildings were around him and he had reached the epiccenter of the explosion marked by a deep crater.He staired out across the chasm and saw his wife and his children waving at him. The scenery changed and the grass regrew and the buildings were repaired and the lives restored. The man smiled and walked towards his family who had moved behind him. As he reached them he found 3 skeletons bathed in their own blood. Violently he spun away from this sight and again saw his own family.Once again smiling and walking towards them there was a massive explosion of hell and fire and as the fire seared and engulfed him he looked only at his family.                  He looked across the crater. They were no longer there. He wasnt sure what he had seen but the buildings were ruined once more. The lives again extinguished and the grass again destroyed. A sudden movement to his right turning only to find nothing. He turned away from the crater and at once saw a shadowy figure behind him. He opened his mouth in shock.And like his aggressor he too fell to the ground-a skeleton in a puddle of its own blood.

20090226171132AAkPuZa	Education & Reference;Financial Aid	Is the student debt worth it for me?	Right now I have a full scholarship that has been paying for my tuition and i have been living at home. I live about 40 miles away from school and commuting has been very draining and hard. I still have good grades, but it is a constant struggle. I have been thinking about living on campus for the next two years, but that is going to cost about 7-8 thousand dollars a year, which i will have to pay for with loans. I already work, have scholarships and grants,and i'm using every penny of federal stafford loans i can get, but if I live on campus I'm going to need a private loan. I'm also going to a state school, so Im not wasting money on a super expensive school. Also, my parents are poor (they actually owe me 5 thousand dollars which i will most likely never get back), they cant help pay for college, and have terrible credit so they cant get a loan for me. My major is either going to be computer science, math, or IT (i may do a combination of these). I am already in my third year and I've changed majors a lot so I am probably going to still have about two years left of school. I dont really know what I want to do with my life, so I'm scared about taking out loans since I dont have a direct career goal that I'm pursuing.       My question is, do you think its worth taking out about 15,000 dollars in private loans just to live on campus?

20090226155031AA5FVBt	Education & Reference;Standards & Testing	Can someone check my  practice SAT Essay?	Even though the world's economy is gradually decreasing, private college costs are off the roof and the college dropout rate is increasing at a disappointing rate, a students needs should be considered before his/her merits. Not every student chooses to go into the medicine field, or the engineering field, but he/she chooses to go towards his/her dream. Even the smallest of change can have a huge impact.    The current world's economy is at a staggering development. The rich are getting richer, and the poorer are getting no where. Bright and intelligent students may take birth into a rich, poor or a middle class family. No one controls the circle of birth and death. Some children, who are born in the slums of a detoriating enviornment, seem to be the brightest minds present in our world. An average student should not be turned down for scholarships just because of his/her academic standing, they should be given a chance to show their change.     Because of the global economy problems, attending college is only getting much more expensive. Students who choose to pursue their dreams are getting held back by not being able to afford college. Not only because of the high student interest loans, but also because of the government not investing enough money in the education department causes the students to pursue a "$7/hour" job, and wind themselves working in that "part-time job" for over two decades. Students who come from middle or poor class homes finish high school hoping to make a difference in the world, but their dreams are crushed when they find out they won't be able to afford the tuition.    When students are rewarded on something they worked hard for, the reward, no matter how big or small, encourages them to pursue on further. They want to gain their status, earn more rewards, and work hard. A great man also once said, "If its not worth fighting for, its not worth gaining". Students push themselves to a whole new level. College dropout rates are high, not because of the work, but because of the weak effort inputed by the student itself. Students who want to succeed can and will succeed, but students who find themselves in situations where they aren't happy, dropout.    Having support is what students all over the world need, they understand the bad economy, and this is exactly why they should be given an oppurtunity, to make a difference. Federal Loans can allow the students to pursue their dreams, and to improve the world.       Feel free to criticize.

20090226191855AArpWEh	Education & Reference;Teaching	Teacher got fired because of us students.?	This is a kind of long story so i will try to shorten it up. Im in middle school, and in the beggining of the school year, i had this science class and a really big teacher.A lot of students drove him crazy, and made fun of him because of his weight. All his classes would make his life hell. He would CRY (so you know this really bad was). Everyone would piss him off. At first the students were all making him really angry, but then they started taking it to far, like stealing his stuff, spitting on him, cutting the phone cord in the class, and even putting some kind of staining stuff on this hair so when he would sit down. They would also rip up all the sciene books and throw him papers. I guess he couldn't keep up with us and couldnt handle us anymore because he would always cry.    But anyway today we were in class and the vice principal and principal came in and took the teacher with them. And they had told him he was fired because he couldn't control us. When we found out that thanks to "us" all the students, we had caused him his job. Nobody tought it would actually go this far. And today a teacher that we all love came in and gave us a long lecture that we should all be ashamed of our selfs, that why did we treat him like cr*p when he never did anything to hurt us. That he was their to teach us and gain our respect, when all we did was treat him like ****. Now the teacher had to find a new job to support his family (he has 2 little girls and one little boy). So many students in the class started crying, because we couldnt believe what we did, caused his job.    Now all of us are only 8th graders and have to learn from our mistakes, and i know we all f*cked up really bad! We want to know if there is anyway to get the teacher back. Is their anything we can do?! ?We realized he was there to help US in our education, and we ruined his job. And now he will no longer be back. We wish we could go back in time but we all know we cant do that. So we want to know if their is anything we can do to get him back, or not to feel guilty anymore?         Thanks to everyone who answers, i know this is really long. And it was wrong for us to do what we did.
