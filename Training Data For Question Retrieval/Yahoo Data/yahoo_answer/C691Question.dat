20090309232518AAb4ifQ	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Whats the point anyway                        ?	what is the point in having a boyfriend? Especially at my age (20's). I am not interested in sex. Im in school, i do  not feel alone or lonly. I feel like the only reason i would have one is to fit in and not look like a loser. I would like one (a bf) but i do not need one. I am content without one. so what is the point for me, you think? thank you in advance.

20090309232558AAE8Pmn	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	What would you do in this situation?	I lived with this guy for 2 years, loved him with all my heart and we had great times. However his father also lived with us and was single,he drank a lot and would bring prostitutes in our house. This eventually caused us to break up and I moved out. Shortly after leaving I found out I was preggy and we now have a son who is a year old today! So now his father has moved out of the country and now the guy has just popped up and wants us to be a family etc. We have only argued for the last year and now with his father gone he wants to get back together. We have talked and realize that when we were together,we didn't argue about anything..except his dad..so dads gone,but suppose to be coming back in a month or so,should I even try to work it out with him. I just don't want my son to get hurt and I so don't want my heart broken again. What do i do?

20090309232946AARQMFO	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Can't forget my EX GF?	so its been 1 year and 2 months since i broke up with my high school sweetheart/ first 2 years of college gf of 3 years. since the day we broke up we have never spoken again. It was a paradise relationship of 2 years and 11 months and 12 days. Our relationship went sour and ended in literally 18 days. I loved her with all my all my heart and gave her 100% of me. Her parents broke us up and said that I was not good for her and that i'm not the guy that she always visualized she'd be with. Now that I've grown up i realized that she must of left on her own free will... because no one can make you stop loving someone. Her name is outlawed in my house and mom threw out all of our pictures from the 2 proms we went to.. yet if she were to call me to apologize and work on a friendship i'd accept it..its not that im dying to be with her again.. Because i really do believe i'm past that... but I view it as a chapter in my life that I never finished writing. She was my best friend also for 3 years... i haven't spoken with the person i've spent the most time in my life with besides my direct family and it bothers me. I want to make peace with her so bad and it just haunts me. there still has not been one day where i don't think about her. her way of coping was very destructive by thinking the worst of me so I don't think approaching her would be a good idea..She drinks a lot, get smashed... sleeps around. totally doing everything she said she'd never do. Everything she used to view as weakness in other girls.Deep down in my heart i feel she did this to try and convince herself she hates me.. but i think one day she will come around and face her problems...Im going to let another year go by...see if her anger towards me can heal and maybe some of my pain...Will I always suffer like this?

20090309233020AA62nfd	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Pick a letter, any letter! [20 characters]?	Just pick a letter. That's all I'm asking. Pick. A. Letter.   First, pick the answer that is closest and HONESTLY who you are.   Then, pick the letter that you would rather date.      ASSUME THAT BOTH PERSONALITY TYPES ARE ATTACHED TO ATTRACTIVE PEOPLE.      a) Has a very positive outlook on life, smart and witty, close to family and friends. Doesn't really attend parties, but ready to attend one if in the mood.      b) Always the center of attention, and they know how to catch anyone's eye. Parties often. Really a big ball of fun, but can be very judgmental or critical of others.

20090309233827AAViPM0	Family & Relationships;Friends	What to say to a clingy friend that is getting in the way?	I am at a point in my life now where I need to stop procrstinating and get things done. This is hard to do because i get distracted easily by one of my friends. She is the type of person who thinks the world revolves around her. She happens to also be my neighbor,  and she is getting in the way of my life. She calls me every day wanting to know where i am going and what i am doing and then she invites herself along. She is very clingy, and whenever she calls me, it is to talk about how great her life is going and how it couldnt get any better. but when i start talking she tunes out and stops listening. I need to work on my life instead of constantly hearing about hers.  my solution to this is to  "disappear" for a while. meaning i dont call or answer her phone calls. not to be mean its just im busy getting things together i dont need distractions.  I explained to her that the reason i havent called in a while is becuase it my way of balancing myself out and getting back on track. She is accusing me of being a bad friend now. What should I say to her?
20090309233641AA7JkeL	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	What does kissing a girl, you have never met, in a dream mean/symoblize?	What if you can remember the kiss from the dream, but you dont remember who you were kissing? What would you kissing a girl that you have only seen in or remember from your dream mean/symbolize? And the thing is it wasnt just a little peck kiss, it was near if not full on making out.      I have found different sites and answers that talk about seeing two people kiss, kissing some one elses girlfriend, kissing a close friend, and kissing an enemy. But I havent found anything thus far about kissing a girl that you dont know in real life.   thanks

Why does my guy friend keep me on the phone while he goes about his normal activities? He has nothing to say usually, and will keep me on the phone while he is working on something, ordering things for his work, and he'll have me memorize things he needs to buy...then he'll buy them online while we're on the phone.      The last time we were on the phone, he told me to go on a website and we were both watching the same movie, while on the phone. I've never done that before, and it was weird, and I kind of enjoyed it...      I dont understand though - why bother calling?

20090309233309AAE9rIj	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	This quiet girl is hard to read but i think she rejected me. should i text her tonight?	i've been going to my college's library for the last couple months to study and borrow laptops, and, because i like the girl who works there, since shes nice and good-looking. we've chatted a few times, but nothign more than 'hows your day been?'. she's really cute but seems quiet and not very expressive/outgoing, compared to the others who work there   so last monday, well i managed to ask her how her weekend went and got her name.   last tues, I asked her out. ok so heres how it went   after i got the laptop and asked her hows it going, she responded, and then she asked me back. i then stumbled for a few seconds, hesitated, then i told her that i wanted to get to know her better and asked if she wanted to get some coffee some time. she looked kinda confused after previously smiling. i then asked how about the upcoming weekend (which was this past weekend)? and she responded right away that shes busy since her friend is visiting from out of town. i then asked about any time that week, and she said shes busy, there was a pause for about a second or two, and then she said that she will get back to me   i then said 'how about i get your number?', she then gave it to me. she smiled. then i left with the laptop      finals are in a week from now, so i dont know how we can possibly meet up this week for coffee even if she agrees, since shes was busy last weekend, and last week, if shes was honest. maybe we can meet up 3 weeks from now, in the new semester?      i just called her tonight (its currently 11:30pn in my timezone) but she didnt answer. its been an hour and a half now, and still no response      should i text her? or is it obvious she rejected me?      maybe she doesnt answer calls from numbers she doesnt identify?

20090309233149AA95YvB	Family & Relationships;Family	I don't miss my mom, how evil is it?	Every time new people learn that my mother left my family when I was little they freak out and the mood of the conversation changes for a minute or two.I truly appreciate the sympathy that causes this but I feel bad because I don't feel bad. I don't care where she is or what she's doing, honestly, I don't want her to come back. It's not anger. I am not a vindictive person but I think my family is great the way it is. I never needed her because my dad and my grand-mama were always there for me and my brothers. Does this make sense at all? or am I in some sort of psycho denial? Is anyone out there in the same situation?
20090309233726AAw1zcN	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Where did all the good women go?	So i've been single for 1 year and probably gone on about 24 dates...(roughly 2 a month). At the end of each date i've thought one of these 3 thoughts: Is she really this dumb...is she really this easy....How long was I asleep for? LOL now keep in mind i'm 21 years old and the girls i'm dating are my age or 2 years older. i cannot tell you how many times a girl has tried to gloat about the number of guys shes been with or hangs out with. If a girl has been with more than double the amount i've been with thats a turn off. (2 long term partners).. and no guy wants to hear about all your guy friends on a first date. #2 I'm shocked to the number of girls who complain about their dick bf's.. have caught them cheating yet still make up excuses for them.. this one girl argued to justify how it was her fault.. the whole time she was wondering what was wrong with her bf I was thinking you need to find out whats wrong with you. The guy has no reason to leave u.. he's getting exactly what he wants! And lastly the girls who drink themselves to death..Sure lots of guys like the easy drunk one night stand girl but no one wants to date you..or carry you to the toilet to throw up..What happened to the challenge..Where did all the classy mysterious girls go...You know that cute girl back in the day that would shoot you a really pretty smile that would make you want to get to know them.. A quick hi and a lock of eyes for a couple 2nds... Where you didn't know everything about her from her facebook party pictures. Meaningful conversations...That girl that you just want to know more about because she just seems different then the other girls. she stands out...where did all the individuals go?!!

20090309233623AAj4kyc	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	How do I know if she likes me?	Complicated.        Okay so im 19 years old(male) and I went to high school with this amazing gorgeous girl who is a year younger than me.  I was shy two years ago however she and I talked a bit in our psychology class.  She had a boyfriend for about 6 months at the time and I did not ask her out because of this.  After I graduated I rarely talked to her until I realized that she worked at the same place as me(zoo).  So we talked again but after she went to school and I quit we once more fell out of contact.  She still had her same boyfriend from high school.  Now we have been talking for eleven days again and I found out that she had a crush on me in high school.  And the day before I got her to admit it she said she felt close to me, like how we were in high school.  So 9 days after we started talking I took her to her first sports game ever.  And did I mention she still had the same boyfriend?  She lives an hour and a half away and our hangout was completely spontaneous for going to a sports game.  She offered me to stay the night in her dorm since I was going back up there the next day.  If she did not still feel a spark with me would she have let me take her to the game?  Would she have let me stay the night in her dorm with her?  Would she have told me she was excited to see me multiple times?  Would she flirt with me how she does?  She also texts me when she gets drunk(which is extremely rare) every time she drinks.  I always keep her smiling.  I cant be my complete self around her because of the way she makes me feel.  Is it time to suck it up and tell her that I like her, despite her 3-year long relationship with her boyfriend? Thanks everyone.

THANK U LOTS!?	hi ppl, im 20yrs old, and a virgin, hard to believe, but true. =p      so i have this checklist (not written on paper, but in my mind, lol) when it comes to dating guys, and if the guy doesn't match up to my "checklist" then i won't date him, not matter how perfect he is. i know its weird that i do this, and i also think that becuz of this, i maybe sabotaging potential future relationships.   here's one main reason that ends up being the dealbreaker... i won't date a guy whose had more than 2 "sexual partners" and has had sex more than 3 times total.    weird, i know. unfortunately guys ive met so far, have had more than 2 sex partners, and have definitely done it more then 3 times.    im not seeking a virgin, just becuz i am, but i don't want a guy whose experienced becuz thats a huge turnoff for me.    ugh wat do i do???   ive broken up with sooo many guys already becuz of this...   i honestly get the feeling that im gonna be single forever.
20090225091653AAdmSSp	Family & Relationships;Other - Family & Relationships	Would a person do this?  Or is it unlikely?	Ive been dating this girl and things had been going great, but this last week we haven't talked as much. She claims shes been busy and I want to give her the benefit of the doubt but things just seem a little different. I gave her space nonetheless.      Anyhow, she texted me this morning saying she wanted to hang out this week. I called her and we made plans for thursday to go out and get a drink.      Based on our lack of communication I'm worried that she's going to reject me on thursday. We're normally very affectionate and we were getting REALLY close, in fact, the last time i saw her was on valentine's day (she lives a couple hours away so we dont see each other but once or twice a week) and it was a great and romantic night and she was really into it. Am I paranoid about her breaking my heart on thursday? Would she make plans with me to push me away in person? I'm trying not to get myself down but I really like her alot and I'm afraid of what might happen.      Would a person make plans with someone to go out and get a drink and even meet up with one of our mutual friends later on if she suddenly stopped liking me?
20090225091406AAnRc41	Family & Relationships;Family	My step cuzin and me getting sexual?	ok so like i have this aunt that is more of a mum to me, i see her more then my real mum. and her husband has a son that is one month older, we are now 16. we first met when we were 9. and we would spend every weekend together hanging together and what not, well when we were 12 he first asked if he could touch my breasts. i told him no but he just kept asking. so i stopped hanging out with him. well when we were 14 he moved in with his mum. so i didn't see him for a year. then he just started coming back around. well when i first saw him again he was so HOT. well i got his number and we've been texting, well i found out that he still wants to touch me. but this time instead of freaking out i was kinda interested. well now i see him like every weekend again and we've been doing stuff when everyone else gos to sleep. is this like super wrong? we aren't blood related. but is it still wrong??
20090225091656AAaUgMN	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Do you think its wrong?	Its wrong of me to think what if my boyfriend and me aren't meant to be or what it would be like to be single. my boyfriend and me have been dating for 5 months now and let me tell you he is a sweetheart and so caring and he always makes me smile and laugh. but we hit those days where i start thinking what if when i really shouldn't and he gets these days when he only wants to sleep or he will invite me over and start getting into something that just sucks him in and allot of times i've confronted him about it letting him know i was mad because he invites me over and then ignores me. But my boyfriend and me have great times to gather and have never argued or fought so am i thinking because im bored of the relationship or the relationship isn't fun?? someone help me because really i wanna know how many people in a relationships get into this thinking mood but let me tell you he hates this thinking mood and i do too.

20090225093126AAwpSTM	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Can someone please explain this to me?	I'm 17, i'm from london uk and...i'm not sure how to put this but i seem...to attract older men.   I don't mean older men like 20-22(which i don't even appreciate) I mean like oool ol oooollddd men, like over30s   i find this absolutely annoying because boys my age for some reason never come up to me to talk to me, they only try to get at me if i start a conversation or something.   But old men come up to me and try to talk to me when i'm walking, i get so angry sometimes i cuss them out. Yes i'm quite tall for my age, almost 5,9 but that does not guarantee that old men are attracted to tall women does it? PLEASE PLEASE I NEED AN EXPLANATION FOR THIS i hate it when they come up to me, they're old and im young im not into sh*t like that, AT ALL.
20090225094058AA2WCPH	Family & Relationships;Friends	Me and my friends got in a fight........?	Yesterday, me and one of my friends got in a fight. I am a guy and she is a girl (we're not going out, just friends, well more like best friends). We all have a lot of the same friends. So yesterday was my birthday. I always sit with her and the rest of my and her friends at lunch. So when I got to lunch, she said that I couldn't sit there because "There wasn't enough room." So I had no where else to sit, so I had to sit alone. It was kind of embarrassing. And she has also been a little snotty to me lately. Like she kinda talks like "No duh." and things like that. She never did that before. Recently, her and her best friend (also my best friend, I know, it's like a network of friends) became friends again with 2 of my friends. They all hated eachother. Now there all friends again. So maybe that's why she's being mean to me now? I have been friends with her since 3rd grade. I don't know how to get her to stop hating me now. Like she won't let me sit with her and her friends (who are again, also my friends). I don't think that it's fair. Just because she's mad at me doesn't mean that I can't sit with the rest of my friends who are always at the same table. And she said that I was mean to HER!!! I never was mean to her. Like I always have her and my other best friend come over. They raid my kitchen. I always let them eat. I burn them CDs. And I do a whole bunch of other stuff for them, but I have never been to the friend who I'm fighting with's house.       So just to make it a bit clearer... I'm fighting with my best friend. We both have the same friends. Our friends are leaning more towards her side (I think). How can I get her to be my friend again?         P.S. Sorry it was so long.
20090225092935AA1nAgp	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	Do you like this quote?	There is as much difference between us and ourselves as between us and others. ~Michel de Montaigne         I happen to think it's one of the most profound and compelling quotes I've read in a while. I believe he's saying that what we don't really know ourselves, just like we don't really know other people. And there's also a difference between what we perceive ourselves to be and what we actually are

20090225092238AAMYCdM	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Ladies: Why women want 'perfect' men?	Why do women want perfect men? Should I assume A LOT of women want the ‘perfect’ man who fits a certain image as portrayed in the media, tv, magazines, or Hollywood? Because of this influence, women (stereotypically) want men who are tall, dark, handsome, tan skinned / Caucasian, Non-Asian, Non-African American, Non-Middle Eastern, Non-Pacific Islander, Non-Indian American, Non-Indian, very rich, famous, classy, and really popular?         Ladies: Be honest. I like it honesty and how you 'admit' to this.
20090225093954AAvL4VG	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Why is he SO upset with me?	Okay so I am married and have been for just 2 years but together for a total of 10 years. I have a very close guy friend that I have been friends with for quite some time. However, something happened recently and I am unsure what to make of it. Me and my husband sometimes have issues because he likes to go out a lot and I allow him because I don’t want to cause fights and I know he does deserve to have fun although last year there was an incident that gives me reason to not trust him because he was caught red handed doing something wrong but I chose to forgive him and move on.    In any event my best guy friend does know about this because I needed someone to talk to and vented to him at the time. Well the other night my guy friend asked how me and my husband were doing I said we are okay you know that my husband still likes to go out a lot but you know things are ok. Well my friend then kind of went of on me he said the following to me in a way of a rant in a bit of a feisty voice:      “You are a dream wife. But you know what in this case especially if someone wants to take advantage of you I think things are your fault to because you don’t yell at your husband and tell him he can’t go out and question what he was doing. You know you aren’t his property that he can think he can just put you up on a shelf to wait around while he goes out and has fun and then take you down from the shelf whenever he needs you for minute. Your not just something on the floor for him to step over or through in the wash machine whenever he feels. You know I see you 30 years down the line in the same situation still married to him meanwhile he has had 3 kids with other women and bunch of diseases and your still going around like “tra la la la la” I know you won’t admit it but you are just to afraid to leave, I know you love him but I know your not happy but you are just to scared to leave him. You never will. And I am telling you this because I don’t want you to ever say to me “well you never said anything” because honestly if your husband isn’t listening when you tell him how you feel well then he is just stupid”      He also meantioned getting nasty FWD via text from my husband and he says "how am I supposed to feel when i get those?"      Okay then! Um I told him I do stick up for myself but that he doesn’t listen and you can’t force someone to be something they are not. Well we talked a bit more and he seemed fine however, the next day he totally ignored me I text him and he never responded and I haven’t heard from him since only briefly but he was short and only cause he kind of had to contact me. What do you make of what happened I mean is he so frustrated with me that he doesn’t want to talk anymore? I don’t think my relationship is as bad as he makes it out to be and don’t understand what happened and why his sudden hostility.    What do you make of this?

I chose not to in high school because I thought it was shallow and I didn't want all that drama and last year when I started college because I wanted to concentrate on school, but now people act weird when they find out I never had a girlfriend. My friends say "you better not tell that if you end up dating someone because they'll think there's something wrong with you" I don't get it, do people just assume that if you haven't dated by a certain age there must be something wrong with you? Should I just start dating people and not take it serious just so I can say I have?

20090225092854AAsZGhe	Family & Relationships;Family	Why does my brother act differently in front of some people?	I have a little brother, he's 18 and I'm 25. We are very close. Father passed away a few years ago and mother has diabetes.  I promised him I am going to make sure he is happy, healthy and successful in life and that I love him and going to be there for him no matter what. I try my best everyday to do this. The nicest thing he ever said to me was that I make him feel warm, safe and loved.  He's a really good kid and he's doing well in school and is currently working part time. We do a lot of stuff together and he seems confident and happy.       But there is something I notice when we are around a certain group of people (i.e friends or acquaintances) . He would not really talk to me. When I put my arm around him , he would push it away. This is something he would never do when I am just with him or with family. I asked him why he acts differently when he is with these people, he couldn't come up with an answer. He thought about it for a while and told me it's a hard question and he has to think about it. Maybe he think his big bro is not cool enough around his friends, I don't know. But I think I'm pretty cool with his friends. Can someone help me solve this problem. I don't really understand why he behaves that way. Thank you!

20090225092521AA5CvoV	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	How do I confront my husband about his gambling addiction?	When our first son was born, 3 years ago, my husband and I were financially secure.  We agreed that I would quit to be a stay at home mom.  For almost a year, everything was fine and during that time we also had twin boys.  My husband had enjoyed going to the casino from the time I met him, and it had never been a "problem".  Now, we cannot pay our bills and we have nothing because he has developed an addiction to scratch offs.  We had taken an equity loan out for 42,000 to pay off bills and possibly use the rest as down payment on a rental property.  $5000 was put toward our bills and the rest was unaccounted for.  We sold our home to get out from under the mortgage and equity loan.  We now live in a living quarter in a garage.  My husband made $100,000 last year and we can only account for $36000 of it.  We have 3 boys under the age of 3, and I looked into getting a job but daycare would cost more than I could possibly make.  I'm so sick every night and cannot sleep because of the financial ruin we are in.  I tried to discuss this with him several times and each time only results in either a very heated argument of which he spends the next 2 weeks not speaking to me, or he just doesn't speak to me when I try to talk to him.  Once, when I was upset and crying about the situation I yelled at him about what this has done to us he slapped me across the face and left for 2 days.  I DON'T KNOW WHAT TO DO ANYMORE.  I want a home and nice things for my children.

20090225092711AAdHyM6	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Guy number 1, 2, or 3? Which one do I choose?	Guy number one- we dated 4 1/2 years back. He was sweet and we intended on getting married. I thought I may be pregnant and during that time he was sent to rehab for marj. We decided to take a break and i found out i had a missed miscarriage. Then I started dating another guy, the first time we fooled around I got pregnant (despite the condom). Some me and guy number one stopped talking really, as he was upset. Me and my new guy decided to have one more child together and planned to wed, but he started drinking, ect ect you know how it goes. I left him when I was 3 months along. I met guy number 2 while I was pregnant and he was there for the birth of my son. Everything was great until I found myself pregnant again, this time by him (on birth control). He really treated me like crap saying he didn't want one of his own and I should have an abortion and he wanted to me go away and don't file for child support and the blah blah. After a few months, when the baby became more inevitable, he got over it and we started speaking again. Hurt still there. We had our daughter and bad things started again. Worked through it (he's bipolar) and have been "seeing each other" but not dating since. He says he still has love for me but we should work things out ladidah. I'm tired of fighting but I do have a child by him. Then an old friend of mine came back into the picture. We have never dated. Guy number 3. We love each other to death and have real trust and appreciation from being friends sooo long. Well he has announced that he is in love with me and wants to move with me when I do and get married..yadayada. He's good with my kids. I was contemplating it but I am still good friends with guy number 1. He is still in love with me regardless and wants to get back together. He is good with kids also. I love all of them in slightly different ways and I don't know what to do.      Guy 1:   Pros: down to earth, understands me, has never hurt me, has always been there, can always make me smile, among other stuff   Cons: isn't going anywhere too fast (but all's he needs is motivation), doesn't have his drivers license, has issues with marj still (though he would quite) and thats about it.   Guy #2:   Pros: he is my daughters father, we used to be in love, i know how to deal with him for the most part   Cons: he has bipolar, he is a bonified pot head in denial, he isn't sure if he wants to relocate, he doesn't understand anything about me, nor does he care to. I don't feel in love with him anymore. (but I do have love for him)   Guy #3:    Pros: One of my best friends, has been there for me through good and bad, pretty motivated most of the time, loving, honest, and can always make me smile/laugh, among other stuff   Cons: He hasn't made any life strides, I'm not too sure of his dependability, he can be too nice, there is a slight lack in chemistry due to the friends thing, and I thrive on passion.      I just don't know. Any one? Opinions? Oh and I do no intend on moving some guy in with me and my kids, I have a garage apartment that is separate. I don't want my kids confused. Friends in their eyes until we are really almost or already married. If that happens.

20090225045515AAe3oiP	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Are mothers ALWAYS right?	my ex boyfriend is ignoring me I think he is mad at me for my "erratic" behaviour (my emotions flip really easily), she is saying I shouldn't contact him for the week, then turn up at his house on friday and make him hear me out coz if i leave it too late the flame will die or something. As in his feelings for me will disappear the longer i leave it (we broke up coz our relationship is "erratic" apparently) we were only together for 3 months, she said i should give him like 5 days space but then go see him, acting rationally and mature, but dont leave it longer than a week.  are mothers always right? x
20090225063652AAvg3YD	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Please help me to get my ex boyfriend back?	hi :) first of all if you're going to tell me to forget him and move on then please don't answer.      He dumped me 2 weeks ago coz he said we're too erratic; he cant cope with the stress right now from his uni. We were only together for 2 and a half months. Right before we were happy 80% of the time, but I overreacted to something so he came over to talk and I threw a negative, childish, sulk so he ended it. I think he cared for me; he cried when he dumped me and has been a bit depressed lately. he said he still wanted to see me and talk as friends. So i tried it for a week but every time we talked I ended up being overemotional. I asked him to review the break-up and see if it was what he really wanted coz he seemed so confused. Finally I asked if we couldn't talk for a while so he has proper space to think it over, and I needed space to clear my thoughts, he said ok.      However the next day I texted him asking him if he'd been cheating on me, 5 mins later I regretted it and sent him another text saying sorry and I really need space now, im confused forget i said it, and asked him not to text back. Then the next day I said to him on MSN "I cant not talk to you its too hard" then said loads of soppy things, then coz he still wasn't answering i said "all i do is pour my heart out and chase you and you obv don't give a **** I'm sick of it" and blocked him. Since then we haven't talked.      My mum said I should carry on not talking to him (i left him the msn message on sunday) till Friday to give us both space, then on Friday I should go round to his unannounced and sort things out in person. She said if I leave it too long it might be to late to try and win him back.      What should I do? xx

20090225071614AAB82he	Family & Relationships;Friends	How can I get my friend back?	Me and my friend *Mark* used to be the greatest friends. I thought of him as a brother but had a slight little crush on him. Very slight and small. And I knew he did too. but we refused to say anything. Since I had a boyfriend. and I had more feelings for my boyfriend. And ya know the quote "Never leave the one you love for the person you like" something like that. Anyways, about a few weeks ago he got a girlfriend. I don't know why it hurt so much.       But yeah we used to talk at least three hours a day just simply talking or watching a movie from over the phone. Now he hardly calls me. I'm the kind of person if I don't talk to someone for a bit...I become cold to them. I didn't want that to happen with him. I didn'tw ant to be cold and distant with him. So I began texting. And then yesterday he's like "I don't know about you and your boyfriend but i'm happy with my girlfriend and she is too. I don't want to lose that." And I just sat there and was like...um..okay? I wasn't ever goign to go after you or flirt with you or anythign. and he said he didn't have feeligns for me anymore. But then I did something stupid, which would be apologizing over and over again.       I was worried I messed things up with him. Andthen he got mad at me for apologizing over and over again. And he hasn't messaged or called me sense. I know it's only been a day. But i'm starting to feel cold and distant with him. Like i'm starting to refuse talking with him and what not. I don't want to do that! He was the closest friend I had. Everyone else...i'm distant with. He only knows about 60% of me but everyone else knows about like 40% welll besides boyfriend.       But I think I messed a friendship up with him. :( I was just worried I messed up his life. and he even told me a long time ago I need to work on not saying sorry so much and I did say sorry a lot yesterday. because I didn't want to get him mad and I didn't want to be cold towards him.

20090225094922AA7klAq	Family & Relationships;Weddings	What do you think of this menu for a wedding?	I'm not actually getting married, but am planning my wedding anyway(think what you will of that, lol)...so please no "It's your wedding...do what you want" answers. So this is the menu I'm thinking of (quite tentative, of course, but still...)      It's 4 courses   Bread, Soup, n Salad   Sides & Main   Dessert   and a full tea      so this is what I'm thinking   Bread (guests pick one) - Rye, Pumpernickel, or Cracked Pepper   Soup (guests pick one) - Radish Leek Stew, Spicy Lentil, or Borscht (beet soup)   Salad (guests pick one)  - Greek Salad, Asian Spinach Salad, or Baby Greens & mixed "enliveners"(fennel, mint, cilantro, lime, ginger etc)      Mains(Guests pick one)   California rolls   Mushroom caps stuffed with saffron fruited kasha   or miniature asparagus quiches      Sides(guests pick two)   wasabi pea salad   curried pineapple jicama salad   sesame purple coleslaw   five bean salad   sweet n sour tricolor pasta salad   honey mustard eggplant strips      Desserts(guests pick one)   Maple Violet Creme Pie   Apricot Rhubarb Pie   Rum Raisin Pie   btw no the cake is not "dessert" in this instance because we'd cut it the day of the ceremony and the reception will be the next day.      teas will be as follows   appetizer teas are green, red, or black   main teas are hibiscus, jasmine white, or lemongrass   dessert teas are chamomile, irish breakfast, or chai spice         So...what do you think of this menu for a wedding? Which ones would you pick?
20090225063418AAQLJBw	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Would you consider signing up on eharmony?	I am only 18, but I have never had a boyfriend. I've gone on a number of dates, and none of them were worth persuing. I tend to like older guys because I have more in common with them. By older I mean like 23-25ish. I just don't know where to meet them! I cant go to a bar or anything either because the only place in my city that allows 18 year olds is a little gay bar thats only open on Thursday nights. My friend suggested eharmony but idk if I trust it. I dont want to be matched up with some weirdo or something, I've had WAYY too many of those. What is your opinion?
20090225052933AA2QtaX	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Not sure what category to post this in but here goes...?	A couple of years ago, I mistakenly got myself into a cyber-emotional affair with a man I had known years before.  We were both married.  There was very, very little sexual stuff involved, though we both wanted it.  We never saw one another - just shared our lives daily.      Anyway, it finally ended - some woman he was having a real affair with started cyber stalking, and he threw me under the bus, didn't care that she contacted my husband and caused a real mess for me.....he was involved with someone in his town and I was just this person on the computer.  I took the whole thing more seriously than he did, and in the end told him I never wanted to speak to him again in this lifetime.  A first for me and I am nearly 50.      So, ff a couple of years.  I had a project I wanted to do and started tooling around on the internet to find a website with info.  I found a thread that was exactly what I needed, but life got busy and the project went by the wayside.  I finally started it again a couple of weeks ago, but could not find the thread, so I wrote one line notes to several people on the website who looked like they might know about the topic based on their profile pics.      I got a response from the guy who wrote the original thread!  So, I went to his profile to write him a note back, and started to read the profile.  You guessed it - it is the man from a couple of years ago!!  I had NO idea he was into this hobby - he never once mentioned it and neither did I in all those years.      So, now what do I do?  Should I write back and say I realized we know one another and let's not continue this conversation?  Should I identify myself?  Should I just leave the guy hanging?  I sort of hate to do that since we both had this experience with cyber stalking.  Should I just make something up?  I would never want to take the chance that he would figure out it was me - not that he ever would.  I know him well enough to know I am the farthest thing from his mind, and that's ok - in fact, it's good.      Thanks.
20090225045444AAL2yDJ	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	What percentage of women like sex? at what age is it strongest when they do?	I am taking into the account that the young women may be curious at first, and it wears thin after they assume a mate (in about a year) I can be all wrong about this, so tell me so. Also some women are more easily turned on than others that need more time and more stimulant.
20090225095031AAAIngO	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	What is she thinking?	There is a girl in my class who she and I sit together. We have known each other for over 4 months now. When I first met her, I had a crush on her, but when I found out she had a bf I began liking her as a friend only. I also have a gf now, but she still seems quite fond of me. She talks to me about everything and anything and she even invites me to her skating events which I go to. She told her bf that I am her friend when I was at the event. she even gets mad when I show up late to class or do not compliment her.  The thing is, I want to continue been her friend, but I am not sure what she is thinking. What do you ladies out there think she is thinking when it comes to me? Does she just like me as a friend or what? I am afraid if she has feelings for me she may start getting jealous of my gf.

20090225070202AAAKVPP	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Why are girls so hard to ask out?	I am 20 and have problems with asking girls out.  None of them will give me a chance.  I am not desperate, I have other ways to occupy myself, I would just like someone special to spend time with.  Anyone got any tips?  I have tried going to clubs, but it is kind of hard when your state has retarded liquor laws.  Dating sites are total BS.  I refuse to do that.  I am not dog-ugly (I hope, lol), I am very nice and I am always clean.  I have a great job serving in the USAF.  I just don't understand why I get shot down so easily.  I don't think I am a total creep.  I have asked them out several ways and I am always myself.  I pick nice places like going to a new movie or a nice restaurant.  I am willing to try new things.  I am a country boy at heart.  I always thought lady's loved country boys (at least according to Trace Adkins).  What could I be doing wrong?  Why are girls so difficult?

20090225071707AA6YIvc	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	If a guy asks to take you out?	I met this guy at an after party, we got on well and now we chat online. I was speaking to him as I was most people at the party.. I'm not into him and he asked to meet up and I said I couldn't because I'm saving and he said he'd take me out.  I said I couldn't let him pay and he said well let's just hang at mine and have a few drinks'will be a laugh' he said. I said ok, I don't know him that well and he may just be being friendly which would be cool, but I'm concerned that he might fancy me (he's a flirt and always compliments me, a bit of a charmer but that might mean nothing). How do I make it clear that I just want to be friends without making things awkward because he may not fancy me? I just want to avoid the whole coming on to me thing and having to say no.... I know I sound like a big head but it has happened before a few times. I'm prob not going to go anyways but was curious to see if there was a way, cause he seems like a cool dude that I can have a laugh with.

Well Ill try and make this short, I dated a guy 2 years ago, almost 3,(josh) and it was anything really, I drank 24/7 with him, it was basically to get over a boyfriend of a year, he has alot of money and now i have been dating the same guy(kevin) every since which is about 3 years, we are good but always fight but I do love him, well when we fight i Always test josh (the boyfriend of like a month) we keep in touch and even hooked up a few times when me and kevin fight, well i know he does not care anything about me, because he only texts me when for sex and depending on my mood and if im fighting with kevin depends on whether or not ill take it, well, its been like 8 months since i have talked to him, and i texted him, and here it goes again, I am not attracted to him, but the fact of not knowing what we could have been make me still have some resentment and that he broke up with me b.c of my drinking pissed me off, but i got over it and always wanted to show him what he is missing, so i sleep with him occasionally, should i just drop him b/c I love kevin and he has stuck it out with me through rehab and alot of things, but josh still convinces me to hook up, should i just let it go, I feel like i have something to prove to him, i doubt he will ever date me again, I think he just wants ***. I tried to make it no strings sex, but i somehow anlways end up thinking about him and wondering what it could have been, what do i do? any suggestions?

20090225065706AABerqD	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Do girls mind being asked this question?	I like my friend alot. A couple years ago, she said she liked me, but saw me as someone she would settle down with, and wasnt ready to settle down yet. Weve been talking lately, goin out and all that, but shes sending some mixed signals. Some say she likes me, some say she just wants to be friends. Would it be ok to just come out and say, "Hey, what would you say if we go out next time as more than friends?" Do girls mind that?

BTW, he's 18, and I'm 34         He knows I'd never stop him from school or anything. He told his mom about me. He doesn't act it. He says he's been through alot. He says he promises he won't hurt me. I have thought of him leaving me for someone younger, and he worries about me leaving him for someone older. But we know we know we don't want anyone else.      We haven't had sex yet! And...we both already don't care what people think. I look alot younger and he looks a bit older...so we dont look funny or anything. We match quite well! My mind is pretty much made up. MEN DO IT ALL THE TIME. WHY CANT A WOMAN? He does more things around the house and is more manly than my ex husband!!! And add to that some guys I've dated.

People keep on saying that its okay for your girlfriend to have guy friends...maybe i haven't met the right girl yet but to me when my girlfriend says she has guy friends, i take it as she's cheating on me. Here is why i ask...      1) My girlfriend and i have been together for 4 years...   she's cheated on me before (first she says one guy only, then she says two, then she says one again, then she says 5 and now it's back to one...she claims that when i question her she tells me what i want to hear)either way, she's cheated before      2) just recently i caught her calling vibeline (for those of you not aware, it's a phone dating service)...she had the number saved in her phone as "good time"      3)Her guy friends have a tendency to call her daily and she smokes weed with them, how she gets the money to smoke weed, i don't know(she doesn't even have a job and sometimes i wonder if she has sex for the weed)      4)One of her guy friends comes over to her house once when im on the phone with her...she doesn't say baby to me, and when he walks in she says bye and she'll call back in 30 min      5)sometimes she falls asleep cuz she's bored a 9 pm or so, and she can't pick up my phone calls...wtf?      i love her, and i feel stupid for this. can someone please help me...i don't want her to have anymore guy friends...if she wants to be with me she's not allowed to...am i crazy/over protective/abusive or whatever? please help      note: i don't have any female friends to respect her, unless my girlfriend, myself and my female friends all go out...i've never cheated on her, and i don't ever call her out her name or any of that stuff....   i know this is a long question, thank you thank you thank you for helping me

20090225053016AAovhqj	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Why do girls seem to get so uptight when guys say something about a girl using them?	Lets say a guy was used by a woman and goes to his friends and complains about it. A lot of other females talk like "Oh, guys can use use but we can't use guys?" The guy didn't say anything like that, he was just talking to his friends like girls talk to their friends when they get used. It's not like guys don't need someone to talk to. So many women think that men are so cold hearted that they don't care if they get used, that they wanted it that way or something. Not all guys are like that....Well, just wanted some opinions.

20090225052359AA54jf7	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	What's an "auto-date"?	I was talking online with a friend yesterday who said they liked playdates and auto-dates more than just "date"s, and I have no idea what an auto-date is, but it got me curious.      What's an auto-date?
20090225060107AAih9cG	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Does this make me a two-timer, even if it's just after one date?	I went downstate to visit a friend of mine and wound up going on a date with her roommate, who I've known for a year and we've talked and sort of liked each other for a while; we wound up hanging out for some 8+ hours and she crashed at my other friend's place where I was staying, cuddling with me and stuff. The night was pretty great, overall, I had a great time and am going back downstate to take her out again next week on my spring break.      Some weeks ago, I ran into this other girl that I have sort of liked (and is definitely interested in me, too) but don't get to see a lot because we're both busy with different classes and work, and we decided to go on a coffee date sometime in the future.      After my first date with the first girl went well, I came back home to a "hey" message from the second girl, who I got back in touch with. We decided to have coffee together sometime next week (I imagine before I go downstate), in spite of the fact that I am in fact going to go on another date with the first girl.      This whole situation sort of gives me knots in my stomach. The second girl I'd like to just be friends with besides, she's pretty cool, and I definitely have more in common with the first girl and things have already started going well.   That said, I don't want to stiff the other girl on the coffee date we agreed upon. That wouldn't even be *friendly*.

I was hanging out w/ the guy I've been currently dating for a few months going through his old pics on his comp when we came across pics of him and his ex girlfriend. I'm not normally a jealous person, but it did sorta hurt me to see them hugging and kissing. Right after he noticed I saw, he didn't say a word about them, he just kissed me quietly. It hurts even more bc she was his 1st and only love, and she cheated, lied, and was terrible from what every person who knows her tells me. I cannot stand this girl for putting him through so much pain... so why would he wanna hold onto those memories? I know it's "the past" but shouldn't he let it go if he's really moved on? Now I'm questioning if he has. And should I say something? I don't wanna jump the gun and seem insecure, but what should I do if anything?
20090225034327AAirJlA	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Do i have a chance with this hot shy girl?	i'm a very shy nerdy college student but theres this cute girl who works at my college's chemistry library. she seems kinda reserved and not so outgoing, but she's hot and dressed fashionably   i go to the library and see her to check out a laptop about a few time a week for over a month now but i usually cant say anything except hows her day been. we dont know each others names      also, a few times before, when i asked her questions, like how her day went, she gave simple answers and didnt really smile. she usually smiles when i check out a laptop.    BUT not yesterday. yesterday, she seemed anxious to talk and smiled a lot, made eye contact, and even asked how my day went. i saw her again today. she asked me FIRST how my day was!! maybe shes starting to notice me.       how should i ask her her name? as i'm checking out a laptop, and we mention how our days went, just mention 'oh, my name is ___ by the way. wahts yours?' and then shake her hand?      i'm thinking of asking her out for coffee or movie right after we know each others names      i'm a loner with few friends with NO social life. i do have a fairly nice haircut, take shower everyday, so i'm not horrendous but also not perfect appearance-wise      the main problem is that theres always students studying nearby so they can hear me if i ask her out

20090225070229AAgYVSB	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	What should I do? Help? Guys & Girls! Boy Trouble lol?	Hi, there's this guy at my college that i've liked for a while now, im not in love with him as such, but i would just love to get to know him. a chance would be a fine thing, hes the type of guy that hangs around with a group of about 8 boys, now that's quiet daunting for me, as i wouldn't want to approach him whilst he's surrounded by them! Also hes not in any of my lessons, which would make life easier, its hard to catch him alone and most of the guys that he's close friends with have some sort of grudge against me or dislike me due to sillyrumorss that were spread last year, I'm also scared of them getting to him & him believing them... Also if any guys out there are reading this, would youbelievee something one of your mates tells you about a girl if you don't know her yourself? Does anyone have any ideas as to what i could do? the only thing i can think about so far is sitting near where he usually sits in class hoping that he'll end up sitting next to me one day, I have him in one lesson a week (advice &guidancee) apart from that we don'tactuallyy study any of the same subjects... Anyone got any tips on how a girl should get to know a guy without lookinobviousus? Any comments befortomorrowow would be appreciated.      Thank You

20090225054105AAIzvg3	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	How do I be non-chalant in asking girl out?	I have been talking to this girl in my class one day a week, and we share lots of similar interests.  I am 28, and she is 22.  I have finally moved on from my five year roller coaster that blew up six months ago, and I just moved back into my parents house again with intentions to save and move back out, which hurts the social scene.  But I am in this class once a week and we talk the whole time, but I don't want to move too quickly and mess something up by being too impatient.  I don't know the first steps to doing this crap all over, it's been way too long.  How do I go about pushing just enough and not too hard so that I don't push her away with being too forward?  I was thinking just saying something like whenever you wanna come to this church I have been going to or maybe we could study for the final next week or I dunno, that's all dumb, and I live at my parents which hinders a lot of stuff too.  Where do I begin this out of class relationship?   Any advice for a fresh single 28 yr. old Christian is greatly appreciated, I am just starting to find me again and gain all the confidence my ex stole from me back.

A friend is going through some rough patches, wants to file for divorce, but doesn't want to get into the custody fight.  She is a great mom, patient etc and she is with a man who really could care less about the kids unless it benefits him at some level.  She has to call him on his cell phone to even come out of the bedroom to say goodnight to the kids, and if she leaves him in charge for some reason, he is always so angry ...yelling at the kids, spanking them for things as simple as one of the kids wanting to wear a diff winter hat to school...I say she should try recording some stuff and take that into court when the time comes, she says she would feel bad for making him look bad, what do you think?

20090225042808AAI1mbN	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Weird don't you think? got the old I only see you as a friend speech.?	Weird don't you think? got the old I only see you as a friend speech.?   Hi i'm a 20year old guy from the UK, it seems my love life so far has been full of weird mixed signals. This happened to be before but it seemed to be abit different. I once got close to this girl I knew from college who was the same as as me, hit it off are still friends now but at the time I fell for her and wanted more I suppose. Anyway I asked her and I got the whole I only see you as a friend. I was kind of expecting it at the time 2bh so it wasn't such a surprise but was worth a shot only live once hey! This was about 6months ago.   Anyway recently I met this girl who is my mates gfs friend. If that makes sense. We got on well hit it off, and whenever we were out I would notice her staring at me when I wasn't looking. Also she would always tend to bring me up in a conversation and mention my name. I will admit it she is gorgeous and I'm 90percent sure the signals she was giving me was more than just friends. Cut a long story short the other night I asked her out and she said she "only sees me as a friend and she doesn't want to complicate things"   She is younger than me at 17. I am not going to dwell on it but I didn't really understand this. I am either useless at judging womens signals or she does like me but there is a reason why she doesn't want to give it ago. Women always seem to feel comfortable around me and I have tones of friends that are girls! but they never seem to want to any further. :(      Anyone had the same happen to them? or any women shed any light on the matter. Thanks.

20090225045437AACQdH0	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Is my boyfriend cheating, or just thinking about it?	ok... for starts, we have been together 2years, and living together almost 1 1/2....he is always(3or 4 times a day) asking me if i ever cheated on him, or if i will. and it is so annoying because we will be in the middle of sex, and he will ask me. he is always bringing up his childhood friends that are girls that live in the area.. he says he never liked them, but they are really beautiful, and when their names are brought up he gets all into the conversation... i even found out that where he has been meeting a fellow employee for work in the morning, is where one of them works..but lately i have been dropping him off.. when we are in public and i go to kiss him, he hurrys and kisses me and he looks around, as if he is making sure noone is looking... he usually holds my hand in stores, but when a girl or girls walk by he lets go and kinda puts distance between us as if we werent even together... oneday we were shopping and i was telling him about my day at work and some girls where nearby, and he just started acting funny and when i finished what i was saying, a few seconds after, he asked me what i said... just about everytime i get on my computer and check the history, it is filled with porn. i dont care if he watches it, but alot of nights when i want to be  romantic, i get  the whole "im tired" thing, but righ after he asks me to get the laptop so he can watch porn.. i get upset, because if he isnt to tired to watch that, then he can make love to me insted of fantisizing about those girls.... he is always reasuring or relationship CONSTANTLY! it gets sooo annoying, because i know what he is going to ask me before he does... he asks me so much, that by his actions when asking, makes me wonder if he is asking so much because he is/was doing wrong.. or maybe because he knows im a good person and wants to be sure that if he is doing wrong i would be there if i never find out... im always feeling like that... but he does always tell me he loves me, so thats where it gets confusing.. but he only mostly says it and loves on me when we are in front of our families, or at home. other than that i feel like he is embarrased of me...
20090225050143AAXRfpk	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Does he still love me?	i met this guy last year around march, and we fell in love without knowing it. the only problem is that he lives in GA and i live in IN. we talked on the phone each night. i was so in love with him. he even wrote a few poems about me. but then one day in July he told me that we couldn't continue to be together. of course i was sad. he told me the reason we couldnt be together was because he was being blackmailed into going out with this other girl. and if he didn't date her that he wouldn't be able to get into the marine corps. so he left for three months to basic training. i was depressed because i still loved him. then he came back in December. but he was so diff. we barely talked to each other. then we got into a big argument. he told me that he still loves me, but that he cant be with me. in a way i think is true because we're so far away from each other its impossible.

I love him very much and i know he feels the same.  Thing is we have one problem, our sex life...When we first got together it was great, new etc. but over the last year my sex drive got pretty low and things slowed down quite a lot.  I know he found it difficult when i really wasn't up for it and i tried really hard to get it back up and now i'm almost back to where i was.  We introduced loads of new things into our sex life and things are now really great but he just seems to want it all the time.  I love sex but it seems to be the topic of conversation most of the time and he always wants it.  I feel silly complaining about it but sometimes i would just like a cuddle and a kiss and nothing more.  I try to talk to him about it but he just gets offended.  The rest of our relationship is so so good i just don't get why this is such a problem.   Please help

But now, I think that I have lost feelings for him.  When I was thinking about ending it, it gave me a poem he wrote me and a stuffed animal for our four month.  Which is making this hard.  After he broke up with the girl before me, which was for three weeks, he was really depressed.  He said I was with him longer than anyone else.  And that he loves me and even if we break up he will still love me.  I'm scared of him getting upset.  Should I end it?  He keeps pulling me in closer when I'm trying to get away.

20090225083817AA3TdNU	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	Am I being unfair to think this about my fiance?	He is my first but I know he has been with other girls, and I have no problem with that. However, I just found out that about a year before we got together, he'd been having a lot more sex than I realized, and not always protected. But what bothers me is the fact that one time, he was with 3 girls in one day. I'm disgusted by this and did not think he was like that at all. He was always very respectful of me and we dated months before actually having sex. He has never struck me as the player type and insists that he isn't. But now I can't help but think he is more prone to cheating now. He travels a lot for work, and hangs out with his coworkers at the bars in town sometimes. It makes me think now that his casual attitude towards sex and his general lifestyle (hanging out at bars with his single coworkers when he's out of town) makes it a when, not if, he's going to cheat situation. I never had this concern or trust issues with him before he told me about his sexual past; he says that it's in the past, he has been tested and never had any diseases, and he's never once cheated on anyone. But he seems like a different person to me now...plus it's a different lifestyle than I am accustomed to.       Am I being unfair or unreasonable in assuming these things or are my concerns legit?

20090225075012AA2Uf8p	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Is my boyfriend a jerk?	Me and my boyfriend have almost been going out for 7months now. I really like this kid. But lately i've just been kind of cold and distant with him lately because my friend pointed out something that I didn't really put two and two together. Whenever me and my boyfriend hang out we always go to his friend's house and I just sit there while he plays video games. once in a blue moon will he let me play video games with his friends. But yeah he can seem like a jerk like that and make fun of me but then other times if I don't wnat to do something he'll say that's fine and do it himself or something.       It just seems he likes to act like a "Pimp" or whatever in front of people. Simple as that. Like I put my head on his shoulder when his game was on PAUSE. and he's like "Why do you always have to be touching me?" I don't always touch him. I leave him alone when he is playing his games or whatever. and then I got my student loan and I told him I was going to get him some games. like $300 dollars or whatever. and he's like "Can I have $450?" He even says he can be selfish at times and thinks he needs to treat me better but he said he wants to act like apimp before he grows up or whatever the heck he said. Also, he wants to do a three way but said if I said no he would accept that. And when I said "So i'm not enough?" Jokenly. he's like "Nope. One is better then two. But your the one I would choose."          ~ _ ~ I'm noticing he's a bit of a jurk more and more. and I don't want that! I was happy before. Now...i'm cold towards him. I stopped calling him. He's noticed. He would call me and be like "You don't call me anymore." and i'm like "I don't want to bother you." and he's like " Well come over here and pick me up. Going to friends now." and he's always saying he's here for me. and like we'll drive around for awhile and talk and it'll just be a great time. I don't know! I don't know. I don't want to act cold towards him. I don't want that      **I posted this earlier but I wanted more views and opinions**      Oh and last week he randomly called me to say he loved me and was thinking of me and what not

20070118223600AAfOFHo	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	I made the biggest mistake ever...?	help me fix this.       I had a crush on this guy, and suggested we do drinks one day...but we were working on a project and I wanted to get it done first. So the project gets cancelled, and I got too shy to follow through with the plan. He's a sweetheart, and always stayed on my mind and I can't forget him.      Well, I'm going to see him again. How do I explain myself? I know its kind of lame, but its the truth and I really feel bad. I just want this one chance to actually take him out and thank him for his hard work.

I do have feelings for him, i'm just not sure if i should put myself out there and show them.  I haven't heard from him in almost 2 weeks.  He left me a message two weeks ago to let me know a family member had died and he was sorry for being distant.  I replied that I was sorry for his loss and if he needed me I was there for him.  Now I haven't talked to him at all.  What should I do?

20070123130328AAID3xv	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	I heard today that the law in states let someone divorce for not being happy?	The other party does even not have to sign... You can just get a no fault divorce and you dont even have to reason for it! I think this sucks ... Why even marry if you can get divorced this easy. What do you think of this? Do you think this is fair or right? I want input and responses to this? What is this world coming to? Do vows mean anything anymore? Why even get married if you do not plan on staying married or working at it. To me why even waste the time to get married if you can get divorced and out of it that easy. I want to hear your opinions on this one. What do you think and feel about this and why? I feel the only reasons the other party or person have to sign it is in cases of abandonment or cases of severe abuse.

20090225085705AAbYFk7	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	Need Help on my marriage.?	I have been married going on 10 years. He plays in the band on the weekends. He has cheated on me and i have forgive him for that. I just had a baby she is 2 months old and we have a older son. We both have full time jobs. His band is talking about going on the road. My husband is so ready to quit his job and go he doesn't care on how I feel about this. He has told he is going and he knows how i feel about this i think he should stay with his job and be here and help me raised his children. I"m so confused and hurt by this. Is he selfish? I feel he doesn't care how i feel! He tells i'm trying to be controlling and he made up his mind. he told me that he was in this band before he meet me and he will still be in the band when i'm gone. I thought marriage was a partnership shouldn't he consider what he doing to our family. Shouldn't family come first?   I need help

20070125104338AANSH4v	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	What part do I play in this???	My bf and I had an argument. He was acting crazy, and my gf urged me to leave my house and have a protective order placed against him. I agreed. My gf accompanied me to court to get the temporary order, it was successful. We both went to collect my paper work, and while at the courthouse, my bf and gf exchanged words. She decided to get a peace order, as did he. His peace order was dismissed as the judge sensed that his was done in retalliation for her getting one. After the judgement, he told her that he had issued a criminal summons for her, and that he would see her at the court date in March. In turn, she went to the commissioner and issued criminal charges against him where a warrant for his arrest were attached. He now knows that he has this warrant and is upset that he may go to jail. He wanted me to act as the "go between" for he and my friend, asking me to tell her to drop her charges. She won't drop hers if she doesn't know for sure that he has dropped his. What should i do?

20070114104258AAvjMnF	Family & Relationships;Other - Family & Relationships	Plz help i can't stop crying i just wanna die rite now???	i was sooo much happoier still a little miserable (but tht i think was from just having no friends which i was always miserable for) but now i feel so much much happier!!! when my mom moved out away from my dad. even then though he still was and is trying to control us but didn't really get the chance to since he wasn't living w/ us. and yes my mom would let him she's so weak. but still i was happoer being away from tht asshole(even though we saw hi, evberyday at my grandma's) but she's feeling so lonely and depressed liek her usual self she says we're going back! (i can't help crying as i write this). i was so happy and now it's all just crushed down. even if he wud change it's not the same (even if he wasn't mean he'd still control like now and i still feel more free in this house no home) if u want info on my dad look at all my old quests. and i'm not an adult so i can't move out. i wish my mom foudn sum1else wut do i do? oh and how do i make tht 2nd additonal detil box *** up to wrin our old house everytime i used to hear the garage i would feel sad and scared becuz he was cumin, everytime he comes in i feel like that and i even fee; abnormal for the way i feel (especialy how i feel when i cry like now) i feel like i'me happy but not it's being crushed and like i said even if he did change i still wudn't wanna go bak. especially since my mom wud nevet leave then. i know tht sounds stupid but u don't understand. and i'm all alone! cuz he's mr. nice guy ro my ext. fam so they'll be happy and they know he is or was! u know be4 my mom married him she never dated him or knew him personally! she just saw him at places w/ fam. and liked him 4 his looks! (she doesn't know i know tht my grandma told me) (and he cheated on her b4!) i wana kill myself and i wud if i wasn't afraid of death or burning in hell) yea he had a bad childhood incase ur wonderin. wut shud i do?   if my mom were to do this i could never forgive her why do ppl have to be married? why do women feel so alone w/o someone? she says she's afraid of being alone and sick especially when she's old and i will take care of her i said i would but no she has to go back to him how could my mom do this to me? just thinking about our old house (bot even him) makes me feel 'ughh' even when i lived htere and he wasn't there it seemed bad. especially on the weekends it just felt like such a sick feeling i felt like that when i woke up. but i don't feel like tht here. i know this all probably soudns abnormal but my dad was an *** to me my whole life. even my aunt who visited us says i'm much more confident this time(which isn't true) and happier(thts true 4sure). if she goes back it's like idk there'll be no life 4 me. sad at home and no friends to make me feel better or understand. at least i'm a lot happuer at homw now. i don't get picked on this yr but still ui'm a loser w/ only one friend andi don't even know if she likes me sometimes. well skools totoally out of the situation. sry this is really long. i wish my mom was never stupid enough to marry my dad in the 1st place. why would you marry sum2 u know nothing about! and y wud let it happen if u know how my dad is (my uncle on my dad's side proposed it). i cud go to my grandma's house and she said i cud live with her. she sympathisez w/ me eeven though she relly likes my dad blindly like every1 else knwoing how he's treated me especially when i was a little kid. u know wut when i heard sotries like when all ym older cuz's (even the one on my mom's side!) were little they would be afraid of him and would become quiet and scared and **** when anything concerning him wud happen. my cuz used to (idk if she still does) hates him and she's not tht little she's a teen! she's the onyl one who saw him 4 wut he really was. see wut i mean even if he did change i'd be miserable.   my mom sayts if he becumes mean again she'll leave him. i can believe tht cuz she did this time but she said 4ever and i don't belive tht. cuzz at the beginnign when we moved out she said she had NO intentions of going back and she felt lonely then too i bet u. (i know her). sumtimes i wish i cud go bak in time and make sure my mom wudn't do this. even if she didn't get married and me & my bro wudn't exist. (God i feel so abnormall for the way i feel inside mayb cuz i've been told tht so much 4om my mom for ahting my dad and other famiyl ppl) if she were to go back i swear i'd never e happy agian as long as i'm there and i'd probably never ever talk again either to any1 or hardly to show my mom wut she's done to me (well i'd be sad naturllay anyways no need to fake it) and i'd never fprgive her for it. i'd rather forgive my dad. i won't hate her but i'll be mad at her 4ever. i just wish i could die right now and go to heaven..i don't ever wanna live w/ him again wut should i doif you don't wanna read everything at least read the first part

She's starting to get frustrated with the situation because she keeps talking about leaving me alone. She know I have a gf but I told her even though I live with someone I'm still single. My gf calls alot when we are together and it ruins our time.       My gf on the side is saying that she needs to get a man of her own, that she's tired of the booty call thing and she's tired of living alone. I've told her that I was going to leave my gf soon and move in with a friend. I told her it was ok if she decided to have a dip if she wants to feel the time that I can't be there, she no that's not what she wants. I'm afraid I'm going to call her one day and she's going to tell me I can't come over anymore because she's moved someone else in. Is she crazy? Or is she trying to send me hints about something? Is she thinking that maybe I'll dump my gf to be with her or something? But she seems unhappy and claims that she cries herself to sleep at night because she's tired of being alone.

20070104101752AA6ASwH	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	I need help?	First off whoever deleted my question FOR NO REASON! I will be reporting it to yahoo!      My buddies cousin used to have a crush on me in highschool. For one reason or another we never really got together though. When I found out about her having a crush on me I was just coming out of a long relationship. It's a couple years later now and the one day when I was over my buddies house she came over and hung out with us. Since then she has been there 2 or 3 times when I am there. She is always saying how "she needs a boyfriend" and stuff like that. Im just wondering if it sounds like she's hinting that she still likes me. Do you think I have a shot with her. Thanks to everyone who answers.

20070108133234AAYVqud	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	I have a crush help?	Thier is a girl in my school who I've had a crush on since the 5th grade , and now i'm in 7th. Tjis girl so unlike the others, she has a nice personality, and is VERY pretty. I really want to tell her about my feelings to get it out of my system but I can't becuase: She is one of the popular kids. So she either might react by teling the rest of the kids, or she might respond in a nice way. I still son't want to take the chance.       Also, When she ever just says "hi" to me in the hallway. Or says, just anything to me I totally respond in THE WRONG way! I totally am not making a good impression on her, although she still talks to me sometimes? What can I do to fix this issue?

20070121132643AACYdLV	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	Legal Question!?	What, if any, legal action can I take against a former spouse (6 years divorced) who persist in contacting people, trying to dig up dirt via internet, etc. Could this be considered harrasment? Every time she contacts me she threatens contacting my Commander, 1SG etc. knowing that the only outcome is them getting tired of it and her hoping they loose patience with me even though they know I have done nothing against the court orders or military regs. Is there any legal option for me to put a stop to this kind of activity on her part
20061128130518AAliWi1	Family & Relationships;Other - Family & Relationships	Fantasy Roll Play Question (Ladies Please)?	Okay now, this truely is a serious question. My wife has a fantasy about having sex with several men one after another. She keeps bringing this up to me about wanting to be blindfolded, and having me bring in 3 or 4 different guys to have intercourse with her...without her knowing who they are. I've done a good bit of checking around (for health and descreetion purposes) and I've even asked her if she's sure she would want to go through with it.... she still says she wants to. The only thing like this we've ever done close to this is I've fixed her up with a fella she met online once and we both found it pretty exciting plus she had the time of her life sexually. Should I give her this fantasy and how can I keep her safe while it's going on?

20070118150155AAj6Mf3	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	How long to make a move?	Ok this has just been bugging me for too long now. I started seeing this woman. In the end it ended up bad( it didn't need to). One of her complaints was that I didn't make a move in the first 5 chances.      She expressed how disturbed she was by this. Yet I got very intimate(sex) with her, about a month after first meeting her. I'll admit at first I was just looking at it as a friend situation, but then started to really like her.       So what is the correct amount of chances men should get to make a move for a kiss or holding hands or something else that just seems to be more intimate?      This isn't the whole story and I also admit that I had been out of the dating world for almost four years. We were both 28 at the time.       Am I wrong? Did I not move fast enough. I would tend to think that sex a month later would say pretty fast.      Siiiiiiiigghhhhh. Help. Help relieve my mind. Thanks.

Why would he look happy and wave to my friends then just stare at me so sad? We broke it off about 2 months ago

20090225090144AA70lf7	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	My girlfriend said that we dont match and that she dont like me anymore. Then said she wants to change me?	We were out shopping and it was getting late at night.  I bought some food that we were going to cook when we got back.  On the way back from shopping she said if it takes longer then 30mins to cook then she will be pissed off.  I then pulled over to check how long it takes and it was 45 mins.  I then said that we can just get a Mcdonalds or something. She then was going on about a shop that i was in for some time.  I was getting annoyed with her and i said what about all the shops she was in, that i only looked in one shop.  She was really pissing me off and i ordered food and that told me not to bother getting her anything and told me to **** off.  I told her to **** off herself and i orderered something.  We was not talking at the house.  I tried sorting it out and she said she was going to her mums that we dont match, and said that she dont like me anymore.  I walked away from her because she was upsetting me.  I then calmly sat her down and i asked her if there was something she's not telling me.  She told me that there was things that she wanted to change about me, that i am too laid back, and there is no get up and go with me.  I was shocked and really upset, its the first proper argument we have had.  I feel she dont care about me, and if i ended it she would just say ok.  I really love her, and at the start she loved me but i dont know anymore.  Think she is going to dump me.  why is she doing this? What should i do?

20090225084849AA3X88b	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	How does this trick sound to ask him his ring size?	I think I'm going to buy my husband a wedding band because I was on ebay and saw a bid for a ring that ends today and it'll only cost me $9 in total. I can't 100% remember what ring size he told me he was. I know we could possibly have it readjusted later, but in the case of buying this ring now, how about this: I bring up my fingers are swollen (I'm currently pregnant) and compare them to his than ask him his size. Does that sound like it will work or does it sound a little fishy? What do you think?

20090225085944AAQRuUV	Family & Relationships;Friends	How to deal with a pervert from my past?	A few years ago I worked for an attorney who was constantly sexually harassing me. This man was twice my age, married, and he would constantly send me text message telling me how lonely he was and how pretty I was and asking me what I was doing each night. I complained about it to my other coworkers, and long story short, I was forced to leave my position. Things didn't end well and I was so upset that I started seeing a therapist.      Fast-forward 18 months and I'm in a new job and volunteer with three animal rights organizations. I was overjoyed when one organization that works to expose Puppy Mills asked me to do some volunteer paralegal work for them. But last night I found out the attorney with whom I would be working is none other than this perv that I used to work for.      I emailed an old coworker and she said that he probably won't handle it well. In fact, she says that he has gotten worse and was recently suspended from our local country club for sexually harrassing a groundskeeper.      What should I do? Should I be the bigger person and put our past behind us for the animals? Should I do the paralegal work anonymously? I could really use advice from both men and women.

20090225074944AArLkYJ	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Am I calling her too much...?	... and should i have made definite plans monday. For the first date, I asked her out and we made tentative plans for Saturday. I told her I would call her Friday to make definite plans. Which was fine I thought. This time I called her Monday and did the same thing. Asked her if she would like to go bowling (she mentioned on the first date how she use to bowl). She said yes, so I told her im not too familiar with a place to bowl up where she lives. So she told me of a place. I told her that I would call that place to see when they have open bowling to see when we could go on Friday. She said ok. I told her I would call her in a couple of days to make definite plans for Friday. Should I have just made concrete plans then? Is it too much calling in between Monday and asking her out and Friday when we will hang out?

Jake talks to me a lot and is sometimes super nice and other times a HUGE jerk he also plays dumb obviously. but I KNOW I can't trust me cuz he's bff with Greg and they both talk about me.

I always have to watch what I say around him and its such a hassle. Any advice please?
20090225091437AAQa1hv	Family & Relationships;Friends	What to make of this? Ten points to best advice.?	Well, there's some girl I met last weekend. I've kinda known her family almost my whole life, but can't remember anything about them before 2 weeks ago. Well, I talked to her and we talked as if we had been friends for a long time. The thing is, I'm kinda starting to think I like her. What should I do? She's 2 years younger than me and goes to a school about 10 miles away from mine. We're kinda into the same kind of music. I talked to her alot, and I don't even know why, but I get the feeling that I like her.

20061202052317AAy731l	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Is it a rule?	Ok, I have a friend and she is dating this really cute guy. But honestly, she's not that pretty. Not trying to be mean. But we heard that he only went out with her because he was afraid to just break up with his first gf. So know he is dating her. But he is really REALLY cool. But she'll go out with anyone. She's like a $lut. And I think that she doesn't really like him, she just likes the fact that she is going out with someone.    I spent the night w/ her, and she calls him all the time! NOt onece or twice, but 4 to 6 times a day for nothing. Anyhow, we were talking to him and me and him spent the entire time talking. Not her and him, but me and him.    I really like him, is it a rule that you can't go out with your friends bf if they breakup?   Do you think that she really deserves him when she goes out with everyone she can and always wants to be something in the bed.    Thanks!

20090225083548AAGqlEu	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Did falling asleep in my arms mean anything..?	There's this girl in my university and she lives on the same floor as me in the dorms and I've thought she's amazing since the first day. She's Arabian and on her first day these 2 Arab guys go up to her and like introduce themselves and they become friends. Long story short they become EXTREMELY controlling of her and they tell her she's not aloud to date any guy other than them and so much other bull.... One time they get into this big fight in the halls and she sort of storms off crying and I go after her and she asks me to take her away so I take her to dinner then she says she doesn't want to go back so I take her to my parents' place which is like 45 mins away and we lay away till like 2:00 am talking and she's in my arms and then she falls asleep and even though nothing sexual happened I feel like we connected so well and I would do anything for her. Next morning we go back to school and we go to classes and we don't see each other for the whole day. The morning after she comes to my room really early like 6 am and she gets into my bed and cuddles with me.       Are we headed for a relationship or am I headed for the "best friends" zone?
20090225090640AALVBde	Family & Relationships;Other - Family & Relationships	What to do when you love your wife but you're no longer "in love" with her?	My wife of 25 years recently told me some disturbing things about her sexual past (before we were married).  It has caused me to lose respect and trust in her.  I still care about her but she is like a stranger to me now and their is little desire left.
20090225082916AAJUCHI	Family & Relationships;Other - Family & Relationships	Friend totally went off on me and now is very distant. What do you make of this?	Okay so I am married and have been for just 2 years but together for a total of 10 years. I have a very close guy friend that I have been friends with for quite some time. However, something happened recently and I am unsure what to make of it. Me and my husband sometimes have issues because he likes to go out a lot and I allow him because I don’t want to cause fights and I know he does deserve to have fun although last year there was an incident that gives me reason to not trust him because he was caught red handed doing something wrong but I chose to forgive him and move on.     In any event my best guy friend does know about this because I needed someone to talk to and vented to him at the time. Well the other night my guy friend asked how me and my husband were doing I said we are okay you know that my husband still likes to go out a lot but you know things are ok. Well my friend then kind of went of on me he said the following to me in a way of a rant in a bit of a feisty voice:      “You are a dream wife. But you know what in this case especially if someone wants to take advantage of you I think things are your fault to because you don’t yell at your husband and tell him he can’t go out and question what he was doing. You know you aren’t his property that he can think he can just put you up on a shelf to wait around while he goes out and has fun and then take you down from the shelf whenever he needs you for minute. Your not just something on the floor for him to step over or through in the wash machine whenever he feels. You know I see you 30 years down the line in the same situation still married to him meanwhile he has had 3 kids with other women and bunch of diseases and your still going around like “tra la la la la” I know you won’t admit it but you are just to afraid to leave, I know you love him but I know your not happy but you are just to scared to leave him. You never will. And I am telling you this because I don’t want you to ever say to me “well you never said anything” because honestly if your husband isn’t listening when you tell him how you feel well then he is just stupid”      Okay then! Um I told him I do stick up for myself but that he doesn’t listen and you can’t force someone to be something they are not. Well we talked a bit more and he seemed fine however, the next day he totally ignored me I text him and he never responded and I haven’t heard from him since only briefly but he was short and only cause he kind of had to contact me. What do you make of what happened I mean is he so frustrated with me that he doesn’t want to talk anymore? I don’t think my relationship is as bad as he makes it out to be and don’t understand what happened and why his sudden hostility.    What do you make of this?

20090225083823AAkoPAp	Family & Relationships;Other - Family & Relationships	Mixed signals from my Ex Girlfriend..UGH!?	Heres the long story short.  My ex and I broke up 6 weeks ago. I cheated....have been in counseling, started going back to Church. She, I and our friends all see a difference. Heres the problem;       She started dating this guy ASAP.  She tells me she really likes him, want to see where things go, hes great, etc etc. I say "No Contact" she finds reasons to contact me.  Says shes not ready to hang out, but misses me.  Feels like she lost her best friend,  We hang out last week. it goes from uncomfortable to us kissing several times.  tells me she still loves me and if it wasnt for the "new guy" she'd probably be working things out w me.  Than says she feels like we burned alot of bridges and it would be hard too get back there. (Friends, family, etc)       So that night (we kissed remember) she text me a bunch of sweet thigns.  (EX. BIG KISSES...Muuuuuuuuaaaaaaaahhhhhh!....It was great seeing you...Im blowing up your phone ..lol........as long as Dom (the new guy) and i are together , I dont want him to know im seeing you...)      We make plans t hang for the next day.  We meet up, she is clearly not 100% comfortable, we hang out, start talking..again make out. She says that she is in my life for a "reason" and it so hard. She, again, really likes this new guy and he is "great"...than she tells me "things arent great with him and her".      She doesnt fully warm to me. I endeavor to listen and tell her i understand thats what she needs now and i joke that if they dont work out I get first refusal of a date.  She agrees.        Heres the fun part...      The next day, she finds out that her "great guy" was flirting with a girl he never met on Facebook.  He even gave her his #.  Shes pissed. Dumps him.      At my house we hang for a few mintues, we make plans for her to come over tonight at 6 pm , make dinner, watch a movie.      She calls me later that night and tells me she's not ready for that and that she needs to take some space for herself.  She says she didnt deal with her emotions.      I get fustrated. She likes the new guy a ton, but makes out with me...says shes not ready to get back together , but wants me in her life.  Wants to hang out, but cannot.  Still loves me. Wants whats best for me. I tell her fine. please dont contact me...she says "ok" than text me a few hours later...(nothing too important mind you, but a text never-the-less)      She doesnt want it to be all-or-nothing.  Im confused.  I know she is conflicted.  She misses the connection we shared.  She says she doesnt/didnt have it with him, nor has she ever with anyone else. I feel it too. We kiss when shes "exclusively dating someone" else, yet she cannot bring herself to give this another try..not now at least.      I think she is trying to have her cake and eat it too.      Is she trying to let go? Still in love?  Mad because she see's changes but doesnt know how to make us work again? Was this guy a rebound that prevented her from dealing with her true emotions?      Ive met someone else who is great and the last thing I want to do is hurt her, but I cannot give myself to her fully because of obvious reasons.      Thanks everyone,   God Bless

But recently they have just been asking everyone to go out exept me. It gets me really confused because they dont act like my real friends. They tell each other everything but never me anything, yet they want to know all of my business. I really dont know why they have done this. I was thinking maybe because I have gotten a boyfriend and perhaps they think i am just with him all of the time. I just need some advice on what to do and perhaps why they are being like this with me.

He has an "I don't give a damn about anything having to do with my GF when I am mad at her!" And I know for a fact that he still keeps in touch with girls from the past and flirts with them.

20090225090007AAIFkSa	Family & Relationships;Weddings	I can't marry someone like this... please help?	Ok, so I have been engaged since late Decemeber to the guy that I truly thought I was going to marry.    This past saturday he told me that he had a work meeting at 4pm and that he would be back at my place by 7pm to hang out... well at around 8 I still hadn't heard from him so I called his cell and got no answer. At about 9 I called his work and talked to a co-worker only to find out that there never was a meeting. So I continued to call his cell phone and he accidentally answered and I heard a girl talking... she said "just answer it then", and he said "no, it's my exgf... she won't leave me alone... i don't want to talk to her"... and that was it. So I got REALLY upset and text him and said that's it... I heard everything. Well, he called me around 10 telling me that he was out with some work friends, but didn't want me to know because he knew I would be upset. He said the girl was some girl that he met that night (which I think is weird because why would she be in his business about who he is talking to?)... and he also said they were at a restaurant just drinking and talking... a resaurant for 4 hrs?? And if that's where he was then why didn't I hear any background noise when he accidentally answered?      I was so upset... we talked about things and he said that he just needed time to himself to "think"... to decide if this is really what he wants because "forever is a long time"...   For whatever reason... I'm still sitting around waiting for an answer from him... everytime we talk he tells me that he DOES want to be with me, but he's not sure if it will lead to marriage... he says he just needs time to himself to "think"... I don't understand! If you love someone... you will be with them! I am so frusterated with myself... I just want answers! He told me he loved me last night, but just to give him time...      What does that mean??? What should I do???

I have Venus in Capricorn so I'm attracted to Capricorn a lot and I have a lot of Capricorn friends. I know Capricorns are not the best to get involved in a relationship with though. especially for Sagittariuses because we are so different. I have Mars in Scorpio, Pluto in Scorpio. Ceres in Capricorn. Moon in Leo, Vesta in Leo. Chiron in Gemini. Juno in Pisces, North Node in Pisces. Ascendant in Aquarius. Jupiter in Aries. and Mercury, Saturn, Uranus, Midheaven, Pallas in Sagittarius. and I want to be in a long term relationship maybe even marry the person but I can never seem to find the right person for me. Im going to school right now and I like a Cancer guy and a Pisces guy but both I don't like THAT much really. the Cancer guy never has anything worth talking about but we have such great chemistry and the Pisces guy I'm pretty sure doesn't like me that much although I'm friends with his friend who is an Aquarius. I guess I shouldn't be picky at this point but I'm just curious to know which sign would be better for me at this point. I'm 21. I really like Capricorns, Geminis, Sagittariuses, Aquariuses and Libras the best. Don't really like Leos or Aries THAT much tbh. hope you can help me out. thanks. :)

20090225072820AAIkPA5	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Whats your take on the situation?	My self and my best friend [guy] have realised of late that were best suited as something more than friends. I have been studding over in Dublin for the last two years and plan to move back to SouthAfrica, where he stays and grew up, in a couple of months. Were going to see how things go from there. I love him dearly and really want it to work out for us but im reserved. My previous relationship wasn't very supporting, he really didn't treat me well and I was miserable all the time anyways the point is that I am used to being treated badly, and not shown love [if you get what i mean?]    Like when my best friend reconciled with a mutual friend that he disagreed with strongly, just so things would be easier for me to spend time With them both , my ex would have told me to deal with the fact that he didn't like that person.      Anyways my real concern is of running away from a good thing [i have done before, purely cause i was scared of some thing different] He truly is an amazing guy and has been an amazing friend for the 4 years ive known him for. Im almost feeling like i couldn't possibly deserve him because he loves me so much, all my friends say he speaks so well of me and they can see how much i mean to him.   Yea so basically my question would be how do i stop myself from being scared to get out of the comfort bubble i am in and make it work with him?

20090225080157AAvKzUN	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Should I just give up on 2 1/2 year relationship?	I have been with my boyfriend for 2 1/2 years, He has a stable job is educated, and no kids and is 26. I am in the same situation but I am 24, I have helped him financially with starting his buisness and have been very good girlfriend as far as being there for him emotionally, physcially, and sometimes financially. And he has done some nice things for me as well. We currently live in two separate housholds and 1 year into the relationship he was so excited about us, he talked plans of marriage, familey and moving in together, I was so in love with him I bought into what he was saying and started planning my life accordingly and talking about us. When we first started dating he had two roomates, and people where always at his house, and b/c the situation was so new and we were trying to get to know each other I was okay b/c I was'nt over there all the time. When things started to get more serious and he wanted to spend more time with me, I came to him on several occasions and told him that I was feeling uncofortable that every weekend his friends are always playing sleep over at his house, " I Have absolutly no Privacy"  Finally he dicided to get his own place and I though things would change but instead he told me he was not ready for us to move in together, "which I was a little upset about, but I decided to understand and not rush it". Constently, he still has people over all the time and these guys bring over a new girl every weekend, it even got to the point that his friend are seriously affecting are relationship in a negative way. Every time I have tried to talk to him about it he gets extremly angry at everything that I say now. "nothing has ever been resolved he sweeps it uder the rug and acts like the problem will go away" All I wanted was some damn privacy to take a shower and not have one of his boys knocking on the door, I even offered going to counseling with him for his anger issues. I feel I tried so hard and now it's over. " he decided to end it with me saying that I was creating a lot of stress for him and that he wants to work on himself as a person and figure out why he is always gets so angry when I bring anything up. "was it seriously too much to ask to keep your friends out of our relationship… so we could work on the issues we had. I feel that he eliminated me from his life but his friends and family are still there. He directly would'nt tell me but I feel that deep down inside he thought I was the problem. I did so much for him. Do other women let stuff like this slide? "Privacy issues"? Friends over constantly? Tempers of rage?  I feel that he choose his friends over me…

She also slept with him only 2 days after we broke up. She began to smoke pot and drink every night with him and began to screw up her life. During this time I could still not get over her, I missed her so much and wanted to do anything to stop her from doing this and to just come back to me. I didn't want her to go down the same route that I did, a year before with the drugs. So i took the responsibility into my own hands and told her mom about all that she was doing, hoping it would help her and she would stop. She then found out it was me who told her mom, and now hates me. I can't even look or talk to her without her telling me to go away, and never to talk to her again. I only wanted to help her and I feel like I am losing hope that she will ever be my friend again. What can I do to make her realize I did this out of love, and that I just care for her? How can i rebuild our friendship we once had? How can I get her to realize that all I ever did was care?
20090225084716AA0vupz	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Need help too much mojo?	I know the last thing anyone wants to hear is someones sex life, but please bare with me. When I was like 3 1/2 yrs old my mom use to leave me at her friends house. Well her friend had a daughter (my age) an one day during nap time. We start grinding we had no idea how it started, but it felt good. So we kept doing it until my moms friend broke us apart. An ever since then I've had this desire that never ends. I tried filling my time with sports, work, school, relationships. But it wont go away an the problem I had with it an my relationships is, even when I've finished an I'm tired. My body wont let me rest so my exes always think they weren't good enough. I've tried hot showers, ice, grinding, punching (you read right) , I even try thinking about something nasty, but sometimes I start to get turned on by that. When I was 8 I pitched a tent from a car (A CAR!!!). I literally have to jerk it at least 3 times a day just to keep my composure when going outside. I look stoic and I have a-lot of self discipline. So it doesn't seem like this but I have to know whats wrong with me.

I still don't know if he did and i really don't care because she already heard from another friend. Here is where the advice comes in. My best friend told her that the guy was just joking, and she looked at my best friend and was just like "oh," but my best friend told me that all her body language and her expression said that she knew he had been kidding but that she let me believe he wasn't. I don't know how to approach the situation or if i should just ignore it and continue to be friends with her. PLEASE HELP!
20060920174720AAk0Ovg	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Boy Trouble, what should I do?	Ok, I have a 'thing' for a guy...let's call him Ck.  Ck and I spend a decent amount of time together.  We go to school together, have classes together, in the same club (both officers for this club), and we hang out together at school. Its gotten to the point where everyone at school expects to see me beside him or vise versa. Its never Ck or Cami; its always Cami and Ck or the other way around. He has always been just a bestfriend type of thing to me, but recently, a girl (we'll call her JC) came along and Ck (and his family) is really close to her. I also know her. She told me that she likes Ck and suddenly, a jealous feeling developed in me. I became angry, but I don't know why. She is pretty, smart, and nice. And I'm...well, not pretty or perfect like she is. Am I angry because I feel threatened? Or because I'm jealous of what she has? And if Ck is trully just a friend to me, why do I care so much about him and JC? I'm an emotional wreck. Please help. What should I do?

20061129063330AACfcGM	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Second Chance?	A few months ago I met this amazing guy, we hit it off almost instantly. We dated for a few months and everything was wonderful. We never argued, never had any problems and we got along really great. We'd spend hours on the phone and even more time together. At one point he asked me to marry him and I said I would, but then he started having prooblems witrh his family and he had to travel a lot and it got harder and harder to keep in touch.  We decided to just give each other time and see it we could work things out after he settled his problems eventhough I thought I was pregnant at the time. I found out later that I wasn't. We saw each other a couple of months later and wanted to work things out, but then his ex kept calling me telling me they were together, which was not true, but at the time I thought it was because she kept telling me it was and I couldn't talk to him much about it. So we stopped talking and I miss him very much. Weve been talking for 3 weeks now and things seem

P.S.I love his scars.

He's constantly calling me, asking me to come there for thanksgiving, asking to come here for Christmas, constantly making plans for us, but he wants a divorce. So he says. I don't want a divorce. This will be my second. He's immature, I realize. But I still love him and don't want to give up on him. We have been seperated for about 6 weeks, it's been hell. I can't go back to him because he has made me look like such a fool in this small town, but he says I shouldn't care what other people think. But I do. And he's not the one looking foolish. Sometimes you can say something or do something to make a person have like a "brain fart" and say "man, you're right" How can I get him to understand where I'm coming from. He's willing to work on our marriage if I'm there with him, but if I stay gone, he wants a divorce.

20070107204132AASmOcq	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	I'm interested and I think he is too....?	He has smiled and said hello and I see him watching me, but won't approach me.  I'm very attractive, well spoken, friendly, and a genuinely nice person. I'm an old fashonied girl and think the man should make the first move. I think he may be seeing someone in particular, but I have never seen them together...just get that feeling.  If so, I wish he wouldn't watch me...I think the looks and the body language say I'm interested and he probably would be too if it were not for some one else. Do I just forget it and move on????

20070207043154AAtwGfT	Family & Relationships;Other - Family & Relationships	A problem of girl with guys!!?	I have a friend who almost doesn't like to be with boys. She had very short relationship with 2 guys within last two months. She says, she can't be with the boys and doesn't make her happy being with. She likes to lives alone and hangs out with female friends most of the time. But I know she is NOT lesbian and once she said to me about the same.       She is now 21, very friendly and kind girl. The only problem with her is as I said above. She has very weired nature, I don't know what happens within her. She wants to have a sincere relationship but...      She adds, she tired hard to stick with one guy but later on she looses interest with him and starts ignoring him, thou' she feels sorry for a guy but she doesn't look sad for this reason. I know she is not playing or using them.      She shares everything with me and talks to me openly. She likes to chat with boys but can't go into serious and long term relationship.       Anyone got any experience on these stuffs, suggestions are highly appreciated

20080227150757AALtYNH	Family & Relationships;Friends	Why would he do this?	I sit next to a guy (I'll call him George) in class that I've started to get to know. We're both high schoolers in community college, and we have a few other things in common. He commented last week that he couldn't afford the book for the class, and neither could I. However I asked the teacher if I could get the last edition of the book, instead of the one for sale in the bookstore, because I could find the older edition much cheaper on the internet. He said okay, and I found out while shopping on amazon that I could get a  few used copy of the book for a $1.50. So I bought one for myself and one for George. Then I go to class on monday, and george has a brand new book. I asked him "I thought you couldn't afford the book!" He told me he couldn't. Then I said "Well I wish you would have waited a little bit longer- I ordered a used one online and kinda got a two for one deal. I was gonna give you one." Then he smiled and mumbled, "well maybe I could take this one back..." So at the end

20070318092045AAkfTbN	Family & Relationships;Family	Can someone help me understand my mom?	I grew up in a smaller town (about 10,000). My mom and dad have lived in the same place since they were married (mom was born 20 miles away). My dad is from Denmark and came over for school. Okay well, my mom is kind of different, or maybe a better word is curious and unsettled. She says she is so lonely because there are no people like her that are into different ways of thinking. She has never worked. She studies goddesses and yoga, meditation. All she does is read. She says that she wants to give up being a mother and let her kids figure it all out themselves. My sisters are 14 and 16. She says she wishes she would have followed her dream of being a broadway actress...aka not having us. My dad works so hard. My mom is always using 'his' money to travel to workshops, trainings. She says that my dad is not interesting. But he has to work all the time (he owns a grocery store), and for that reason she is able to live the way she does. What is she up to? And I know for a fact that...
20070309083926AAYz8aO	Family & Relationships;Family	I need some insight?	My sister died last week after being ill for many years. My family found out 3 days later. She had been estranged from the family for many years due to a fallout with our dad. She was 18 years older than me so she wasn't around when I was growing up. Finding out she had passed on has hit us like a ton of bricks. My heart literally hurts and my parents are in a state of shock.       I had a friend tell me that I shouldn't really be affected this strongly since she had been out of my life for so many years. He sounded really casual like it shouldn't be a big deal. But the reality is that I have always loved her and she loved me. The last time we talked, she told me she was sorry she wasn't there for me and that she always loved me. I had forgiven her and told her I loved her too.       Is it crazy to feel this much pain since my sister hadn't been in contact with our family for years? And why did my friend act like it was nothing? It confused me to hear him act like that.

20070503202028AAaxbJi	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Please Help Me!!?	I wrote this girl a note telling her I liked her ,and she loved it and we talked more then ever! We were never offical but when people would ask her if we were bf and gf she'd say no but we're talking! Things were great! We'd talk late til night everything was groovy! Until one day, ohhhh God this dreadful day! It was a Tuesday, I asked her in a note if she wanted to take it slow, she responded, "No I can't, I'm really busy, and my parents. But we can still be friends" I'm like "Bull crap! Your letting me down easy" She's all like "No I really do like you, your fun and nice. But we can only be friends" Why did she wait so long to tell me?   Well since she told me that I haven't been talking to her that much, I'm popular at school but I only have 2 real friends, and I'm not in relationships often because of all of its drama.   This girl means a lot to me but I don't think it'll ever be the same. How can I get it back to how it was? Before I told her I wanna take it slow, we've been weird.

All the police say is that they can tell her to stop but until she threatens me..there is nothing to be done. She is harrasing me because i am pregnant by her supposed "man"..even though he is doing whatever with everyone else and she knows it..she chooses to stalk me.

20070618221357AAA8ysa	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Why is it eaiser for woman to push a man away and not forgive, than it is for a man?	I went out with my ex for 3 years and was very selfish and untrustworthy during that time.  She broke up with me 2 months ago.  During this time I realize what I did wrong and have changed.  I have apologized and asked for another chance, but she said I had my chances during the 3 years to change.  So now I am stucking having to accept this.  It is very hard and I get mad at myself for treating her the way I did at times.  I can see why she wont take me back.  I feel like my heart has been ripped out.  I do love her very much and I know I cannot turn back the hands of time.  All I can do is hope.  I have pour my heart out and learned you cannot change someone else's mind. Someone please help me.  This is a very tough time in my life.  She is moving on and having a good time with friends, while I can't just do it that easily.  My friends help, but my heart is still set on her.

She lived in Port Harcourt in Nigeria when I knew her. The reasons I want to find her are personal, but genuine. Is there an online service that might help me trace this person? Can anyone give me any information about tracing long-lost friends? I'm not willing to pay complete strangers for their "help".

20070130085752AA2M6pm	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	When is the right time for marriage?	My boyfriend and I have been dating for almost 3 years. We are really into each other, we like being together and spending time together (we haven't had sex), his family loves me and I love them, my family likes him and he like them, just my family is a little over protective of me, they go by the rules and want me to finish school and then get married, I say that’s not a bad idea but the problem is that I will finish school when I’m like 26 and him when he's like 28 we thinks that’s to far away because then we have to wait till hes done with school to start thinking about marriage, so if we get married at that age, we will have to have kids like almost soon because we want kids but we want to be married for like at least 4 yrs then think about kids, we have done a lot of thinking we know its not just we get a ring and there. We know there’s a lot of responsibility like buying a house, paying rent, buying stuff to survive, pay for school. So when should we get married?

20070724213911AA6nXJq	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Love Problem.?	I am in complete LOVE with this guy. He's about 3 years older than I am. I only see him in the summer because we go to camp. I hate to admit it, but i know that he and his girlfriend love each other a lot. I've told him before that i like him , but he didnt react too much to it because he's in 'love'. But i dont know how to explain how much i like him. He makes me laugh, and he makes me happy even at my worst times. They're still in highschool, but they seem REALLY serious - they're known for major PDA & are planning to get married. It takes me about six months to get over him, & that's only because i dont see him. I'm starting to falling in love with him again. Lately he's been really flirty with me. He like caresses my leg when he talks to me. He always hugs me and says 'i love you.' but i know hes in love with his gf. Im thinking that they'll prob. break up when they go to different collages. I want to keep hanging out with him, but i dont want to keep hurting myself.

We went to the same school for a while, but now we go to different schools, and we have for over a year. I love him with all my heart and I want to be with him forever, but both me and him get so jealous and worried. Both of us want to know who the other talks to, and where the other goes when they're out.. It feels like a natural thing but is it? These girls showed up outside of his house a few times over the summer, and the one that called him a few times a bf.. and my bf said it made him feel like he's wanted.. like he has friends.. and I just got scared and worried..like "what did he mean?" but maybe it's cuz we don't really allow eachother to have people of the opposite sex over at our houses? Even when i dress up for fun & put on makeup he'll think it's for someone else. Just trying to prove to him that I love him, and he's trying to do the same. What do we do? :( Thanks.

20070425051150AA5whfU	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	Custody battle?	My fiance's ex- husband is currently asking for custody of her 14 yo diabetic daughter who has been living with her mom for the past 8 years. He thinks he has a case because we moved from NY state to NH (about 4 hours away by car) and she had a failed 2 year marriage after she left him. The "dead-beat" dad only pays $98/week and  won't even take a  full week off on her vacations.    There was nothing in her divorce decree that prevents her from "crossing state lines" and he did give us verbal consent prior to us receiving the "custody notice from his attorney.   What is the best way for this to 'go-away"- we have already spent over $5000 in legal fees  and wasted a lot of time and energy .She is enrolled in NH schools and loves living with us.      ps   She is an insulin dependant diabetic- and I am a pediatrician and my soon-to -be- wife is a nurse- the dad's wife is 'afraid of needles'

20070203183201AARmyKS	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Do you have male brain sex or female brain sex?	It doesn't have to match your physical gender! If you had to pick only one that describes you best, which would it be?      FEMALE BRAIN: They usually can't separate how they feel about a person (good, bad, nice, boring, etc.) and how they see them sexually. They must feel positive about a person as an individual in order to sexually desire them. Environmental factors such as lighting (candles, soft lighting), smells, sensual bedding, etc. are also important when it comes to sexual contact and erotic feelings.      MALE BRAIN: Males on the other hand can have sex anywhere, any time, any place with equal gusto. They have a distant disconnect between feelings about a person as an individual and sexual desire for them. Males can easily, sometimes preferably, have sex with a person they don't know, don't like or actively dislike. Love and sex are almost two different worlds. These two worlds can come together, and for most this is preferred, but it is not necessary, and for some, not even desired.

I'm going to be 20 years old in less then 2 months. I'm heavy, but is the world really such a pathetic place that b/c I'm fat I'm doomed to a life of being single. GRRRR.      I am in the process of dieting, but I wish I knew there was someone out there that liked me for me, before I lost the weight.      I'm attractive, I have a cute face, big boobs, amazing eyes.      What's wrong with me? Are there any decent guys left out there today?

20070207113102AAZCuCm	Family & Relationships;Other - Family & Relationships	I'm a victim of incest, abuse, and a very unhappy, confused childhood. I want opinions?	When I was 5 years old my Dad started sexually molesting me. When I was 11 years old my Mom caught him, yelled at him, asked me if it happened before, and said to tell her if it happened again. It was never mentioned again. And yes, it continued.      My brother who is 7 years older than me forcefully raped me several times when he was in his teens. He physically abused me, and severely mentally abused me continually telling me how stupid, ugly, and worthless I was among other things.      My brother who is 17 years older than me sexually molested me after he was married with children. I was 11.      My Dad was confronted many years ago and the family has picked up and gone on with healed relationships. (He molested many family members)      My question, am I abliged to have a decent relationship with my siblings? My parents are dead. I'm 52. There are 8 siblings. I'm having a hard time with my feelings toward some of them, and I really don't want to have any relationship w/them. Am I wrong?

Ich bin seit 2 Jahren mit meiner Freundin zusammen, und ich habe sie sehr geliebt, denn ich wei? nicht, ob ich sie jetzt noch liebe.    Es ist so, wir bekommen ein Kind, sie ist schwanger.

Ich freue mich schon auf mein Kind, es ist mein zweites, ich habe schon ein Kind mit einer anderen Frau, und ich liebe meinen Sohn sehr.    Jedoch verstehen meine Freundin und ich uns überhaupt nicht mehr. Sie hat sich um 180 Grad gewandelt. Sie ist richtig "faul" geworden, und ja, sie hat zugenommen. Was meine ich mit Faulheit: Sie findet, weil sie schwanger ist, br?uchte sie jetzt nichtmehr zu arbeiten. Sch?n und gut, aber im Haushalt macht sie auch nichts mehr, sie ist ja schlie?lich schwanger. Sie r?umt nichts auf, w?scht nicht, macht nichts sauber, kocht nicht für mich... Also, nicht, dass ich das nicht selber k?nnte, aber we

20070319145116AANJcpi	Family & Relationships;Other - Family & Relationships	Esiste il mobbing tra colleghi?	mi ritrovo in ufficio con una collega con la quale non ho proprio voglia di parlare...nella primavera di due anni fa il titolare le disse che avrebbe dovuto licenziarla dopo l'estate, x evitare di lasciarla senza lavoro l'avvisava x tempo. Lei durante l'estate rimase incinta, il giorno in cui lo informò ci fu "ovviamente" un diverbio, il giorno successivo rimase a casa in malattia, poi gravidanza a rischio, poi maternità obbligatoria, poi maternità facoltativa e dopo un anno e mezzo si presentò al lavoro come nulla fosse accaduto. Peccato che durante questo periodo il rapporto sia stato solo tramite raccomandate ed una lettera del suo avvocato perchè non fu trattata in modo adeguato. Lavorando in una piccola azienda artigiana ho trovato assolutamente inaccettabile il suo comportamento ed inoltre la fiducia in lei è sparita. Tutta l'armonia dell'ambiente lavorativo è andata in frantumi. Perchè si deve tutelare solo una mamma e non i colleghi che si ritrovano in una situazione del genere

20070326153304AA8YuNh	Family & Relationships;Family	Unfair families?	In the past, Americans have fought for freedom, peace, and equaility. And we fought for these rights, and we achieved them. Although, in my family, Men is greater than Woman. Men make the desicions without the womans consent. Where is the equaility in that? I believe that parents should make the choices together. But in my family-its all up to the dad who is SOOOOO overprotective. The reason- we had a tragic thing happen in our family. One of our family members (my sister) was killed. And I'm the only girl left in the family. I'm the youngest out of three boys. I'm the baby girl. And my whole family is VERY protective. My dad doesn't want to lose another girl but who said that was going to happen? What are the chances of it happening twice? I am almost fifteen years old and my parents can't trust me because they think I will do something with a boy even thought my brothers have sex every night (my parents know they do) and Im not even close to doing that. How the hell is that fair?

Now, she saves a seat for [thisgirl] in everything and sometimes forgets to save one for me.    In some classes, there are two desks pushed together so there are two people together and [thisgirl] sat in front of us and all of a sudden, she turns to me and says, 'can i sit next to [thisgirl]?' and all i can say is 'Okay'    Before she left to sit next to [thisgirl], she asked [someothergirl] to sit next to me. That was nice. She's still nice to me, but she doesn't wait for me to pack up when the bell goes. She just walks out with [thisgirl] and i am left chasing after them. Whereas, if she was packing up, i would wait for her.    I also feel kind of stupid tagging along when she's with [thisgirl] and [thisgirl]'s friends. I feel left out, like i shouldn't tag along, but once i didn't tag along and she was like, where were you?

Okay so me and my gf were at the mall and up ahead of us we see her ex boyfriend (kyle). I knew we had both seen him at the same time. I then remembered why she broke up with him. He wanted her to have sex with him and she wouldn't do it, so he was forceful and she beat him up. Well he then saw us and started talking to us. I could tell that my gf was uncofortable so I told him to get lost. He got mad and yelled for a while but eventally he left. Me and Amber are in walking out of the parking lot when Kyle comes up behinmd her and trudt his pelvis into her backside. I got pissed and started to fight him right there in the parking lot. Amber stopped me and I told him that we would just finish it at school (we are in the 9th grade). Should I just woop him at school or ignore him? I really like Amber so Im not going to break up with her just because of Kyle.

20070413123631AA7JqN0	Family & Relationships;Other - Family & Relationships	How do I tell her to pull her pants up?	OK. So there's this girl at work & a while ago she frieked out when I told her that I fancied her. Her desk location means that she has her back to the office door & her pants tend to slide down as she moves around on her chair. This means that I'm quite often greeted by the sight of her showing off her knickers when I enter the office.  I'm not even sure if she had any knickers on today, as she had a propper "builder's bum" thing going on.  I wan't to tell her to either pull her pants up or stop wearing clothes that look like they are a size too small (last week she was walking around with her tummy on full view). We get on really well, but how can I say something without causing another awkward situation?  Any suggestions??
20070414210818AABjjg3	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Can a physically abusive ex boyfriend change over 6 years?	I think of my ex boyfriend constantly.  We have been apart for six years.  I still go out of town to visit him and have been doing it since we broke up.  He's done a complete 180.  He used to drink, do drugs, stay at home, and was very obsessive over me.  He was also very jealous.  We still talk to this day, everyday, and he is now going to college, stopped drinking and the drugs, gets along with his family now, and is becoming responsible, he is also on medication for depression.  He swears up and down he will never hit me again, but my biggest fear is how will i tell my parents?  I want to be with him and try again, and he said he'd even go to counseling with me, as he has already been.

Since our break up 3 weeks ago, we have spoken on the phone at least  a few times a week, text message and have seen each other twice .  We are pretty normal when we see each other or talk on the phone and don't mention anything about the relationship.  I think about him all the time and miss him very much.  He is lucky that I'm even friendly with him now since our relationship was nothing but heartache 95% of the time. Should I even be friends with him now?

20070504004250AAVgsxr	Family & Relationships;Family	Can I rebuild my relationship with my 23 yo daughter?	When she was 15 she messed up and I had to give her tough love. It worked, she turned into a great girl, but never understood me and our relationship was destroyed. What made her particularly resentful is for some months I couldn't trust her, though she promised shd had changed and in fact she had, but I had to be sure. She started to see me as a cruel mother and today, a great young adult, things are even worse. Never believed I wanted her best. Yesterday, after 2 years, we finally talked, but all  I heard was accusations, she even gave me back a necklace  I gave her when she turned 15.  I'm devastated. Since she's an adult, it seems she!ll never make up with me.

20070514191227AA0VaTV	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	How to tell a girl you like her?	First off let me state that she has a Internet boy friend. She has never seen him in real life and he lives all the way on the other side of the country.He supposedly got "the ring" a year ago. I really don't think this is going to happen because I talked to her best friend and she said that the boy friend is going to move here to be with her but doesn't have a job or money to move. The best friend said that the girl I like is getting tired of his promises that he isn't keeping.  My question is if he really loved her wouldn't he get his *** out of his chair and get a job and get some money and move?? Should I try and make a move?? We have gone out to the movies 3 or so times before this and Ive known her a good 6 months. We chat on yahoo all the time just because we live kinda far away (45 min drive).      I am seeing  her at the movies tomorrow (yes I am paying) and was wondering what is THE pest way to tell her that I care about her and how special she is to me.

20070520082549AAqNanX	Family & Relationships;Weddings	Secondo voi è possibile essere lasciati così?	Dopo quasi 3 anni di fidanzamento, la mia ragazza mi ha lasciato dicendomi che era stufa, non era più sicura dei suoi sentimenti,che tutto ormai stava diventando abitudine, non c'era più l'entusiasmo di prima.   Abbiamo passato questi 3 anni splendidamente anche se abbiamo passato circa il 90% della giornata insieme...   Io ho 21 anni e lei và per i 19.   Mi chiedo se tutto questo sia dovuto al suo stress per l'esame di stato e alla scelta dell'università...   Secondo voi la situazione è recuperabile o ormai non c'è più niente da fare?   L'altra volta mi ha detto non vediamoci e sentiamoci più...dopo circa 1 settimana mi manda un sms e mi chiede di uscire per fumare una sigaretta insieme...   Come la vedete?

Insomma io intendo farmi la mia strada da sola perchè voglio continure a studiare, intendo raggiungerlo visto che non vive nel mio paese ma a parecchi km di distanza, voglio costruirmi una vita mia con le mie forze anche se so che sarà durissima. è un padre troppo possessivo nn mi lascerebbe vivere serena.Voi cosa ne pensate, vi semba una pazzia?   siate buoni con le risposte please!

I am in college and going home this weekend to see him. (He finishes his last fire fighter exam Sat. morning!) We see eachother about twice a month and I just want to make it special this time.       Not to make him sound like an ***, but he is a typical guy. I don't think he would enjoy walking around a park. But I don't want to stay at home every second and make up for lost time having ***. I want something that we will both enjoy, but haven't done yet. I would love advice from guys.       Typical dates for us are Reds games, bowling, movie and dinner, Kings Island. While all these are fun, I just want to spend a great weekend with him and let him know how proud I am of him.       Last time I was home we got in a arguement because I was like let's go to the park, we got there and he was being an ***... so yea. lol I just want something that is romantic, fun, and entertaining!

20070601193015AAWDPVs	Family & Relationships;Friends	Oldest problem in the book?	There is a girl on my street who went to school with me. We were never close friends, but were in a little “vocational school” clique bout 5 of us in all, but now we go to college and I wanted to reconnect. So, I stop by her house every now/then(3 time by my count) and then and we usually talk for an hour or two, last week I brought over the Wii and we played for 3 hours. But if I call her she won’t answer, if I swing by and leave a message w/ her mom, I get no response. She has a bf and I’m not in anyway trying ruin that, I just like to know old friends. You say its obvious she don’t want to be friends, but it’s feels the opposite when I talk with her and we just are chatin it up. I thought that if you didn’t like someone you tried to make it know with mean things?

20070604013240AARHlCW	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Perché nessun ragazzo mi ha mai chiesto di uscire o mi ha mai fatto capire di piacergli?	E' da molto che mi pongo questa domanda e non so darmi una risposta. Posso capire fino alla terza media perché non ero molto attraente, ma andando alle superiori pensavo ke tutto sarebbe cambiato: ho messo le lenti a contatto e ho cominciato a vestirmi in modo molto differente. Sono alta, magra, occhi azzurri, viso delicato, capelli lisci castani di lunghezza media. Insomma sono molto più che carina. Allora perché? Vedo che i miei compagni di scuola maschi si interessano sempre alle idiote e anche un po' tr##e. Io invece vado molto bene a scuola, ma non parlo molto un po' perché sono timida e un po' perché non è che mi stiano molto simpatici gli altri. Forse i ragazzi mi vedono come una str##za, (e secchiona) ma agli uomini non attirano le donne che non li considerano? Purtroppo fuori dalla scuola non ho frequentazioni....Oddio mi devo rassegnare???!!? Non cerco l'amore..sinceramnte non mi interessa, ma vorrei piacere a qualcuno e poi vedere come comportarmi...

Sono una 30 enne, e uno dei motivi per cui mi sono lasciata con il mio ultimo fidanzato è stato questo; lui voleva TRE figli , io neanche uno.   Perchè?   Perchè non ho un lavoro stabile, nè una famiglia che mi può aiutare economicamente e moralmente.   Non mi va di sacrificare la mia libertà. Non mi va di stare alzata la notte dietro a un poppante. Non mi va di avere più pensieri per la testa di quelli che ho già.   Voglio essere libera.   Non sopporto i bambini.   Non sopporto gli adolescenti.   Non mi va di investire un capitale ( l'avessi!!) per la cura, l'educazione e tutto il resto per dei filgi.   Insomma, i figli sono un impegno senza scadenza, e io sinceramente non ho voglia di assumermelo.   Chi fra voi la pensa come me?

20070724132714AAV6kBB	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Breaking up, and being confused?	My girlfriend and I recently broke up, but theres still a chance of us getting back together. She said it was because she didnt feel the love anymore but she still loves me. I go to school where she lives and during the summer im 4 hours away from her. I try and go up as much as i can to see her and she comes down sometimes too. She said i did nothing wrong and that she's been feeling this for awhile and it was building up. I love her to death and would do anything for her. I know about fate and everything and i think she is amazing in every way. How do i a) try and keep things together emotionally on my part and b) is there a way to keep the relationship strong for when i return to school in september, if so what are ways to help me try to keep her interested in me being so far away. ( i have 1 month).
20070724185949AAgmxfg	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Is it okay for a girlfriend to have new guys friends?	I'm trying to prove a point to my GF. If you don't agree with my 'assumtion', please feel free to say so and why! ALL honest answers are welcome. :)   My GF of 5 months brought up the fact of possibly becoming friends with guys at the college she is attending and wanting to hang out with them. Of course I said I wouldn't like that. I wouldn't mind if it was an old friend of hers from back when she was 10 years old or something. Who am I to end that relationship? But I'm talking about NEW guys she comes across. I'm trying to start something serious and I don't think its okay for her to have new regular guy friends.   My argument is that 95% of the time when a guy starts talking to a girl, they talk to them because they are attracted to them. And at one point or another, it goes through their head to get that girl into bed.    Guys, what are your real intentions?  I'm trying to show her how guys really think.  I know that i should trust her and such, but why put herself in that prediciment?

She was with him for 3 years and me 4 months, ya ya I heard every possible view on how or what I should do or what she did.  I am asking this question b/c I still care for her.  We keep in touch, she calls me once a week or more and we just chat about things.  I made a promise before she left that I would always care for her, no matter what choices she made, b/c I told her I loved her and that I had to let her go to see what she really wants in her life.  She is still young only 18, but I still stay by her side and I am there for her to talk to about things.  I did move on, but I guess one day when she matures more maybe she will come back to me if I am not with anyone, I just dont want to break the roads between me and her, b/c alot can happend over the months, years, etc.. and I dont think she will be with him for long b/c she has cheated on him and moved up so fast.  i got views on that also heh

Alright, so there's this guy I like (I'm in 9th grade if that helps) and I'll pass him in the hallway and he'll smile and say hey but then if I walk up to his locker and we start talking he never makes eye contact and he gets really clumsy. I don't know if maybe he just doesn't have very much experience even talking to girls but it seems like he does. We talk on the phone sometimes and he's really confident but in person whenever I talk to him he always acts nervous. Can anyone tell me what this might mean or if it means anything at all?  Thank you! :D

Ich war ungef?hr ein Jahr mit meiner Freundin zusammen und wir hatten eine sch?ne Zeit miteinander-irgendwann wurde sie aber immer abweisender. Als ich sie darauf angesprochen habe, sagte sie mir, dass sie im Moment nicht recht wisse, was sie wolle, und ich ihr Zeit lassen soll. Ausserdem hatte ich immer das Gefühl, ihr vertrauen zu k?nnen..Zwei Monate sp?ter hat sie sich aber mehr oder weniger von einem Tag auf den anderen von mir getrennt. Sie hat zwar nicht bestritten, immer noch für mich Gefühle zu haben, jedoch erz?hlte sie mir Sachen wie,sie h?tte im Moment keinen Antrieb für eine Partnerschaft usw. Eine Woche drauf trifft mich fast der Schlag, als ich erfahren habe, dass sie einen Neuen hat..anscheinend ist er für sie aber nur Aff?re. Ich liebe sie aber immer noch, und denke, dass auch sie für mich Gefühle hat, aber etwas jung ist und Schwierigkeiten hat, sich v?llig auf jemanden einzulassen..da sie mich aber belogen hat, was für mich gar nicht geht, weiss ich echt nicht was tun

20090227105034AAK4CDa	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	The Tables Are Turning On This Situation?	We've been having a casual relationship (booty call) for 3 months now. I know he lives with his gf. He's said that he didn't want anything serious with me because he was already living with someone & I was free to see who ever I wanted to but now for some reason the tables seem to be turning on our situation.      He came over Monday and his gf was calling him back to back. He said that he was getting tired of her. That she nags him and is possessive and he said that soon he was going to move out and move in with his friend. I told him that I was starting to feel lonely because I live alone and wanted a man of my own. I told him that I was tired of the booty call situation. He said what booty call situation.       We normally only call and/or see each other once a week and I turn my phone off sometimes. He called me last night and asked me how come I didn't answer my phone the night before. I told him I had it off because I was in chill mode and then he started to accuse me of possibly sleeping with someone else that night. He said answer the phone when I called you. He stayed the whole night last night, but he left when I left this morning. If he's living with his gf then why did he stay the whole night with me last night and called me two days in a row and he's never done that before? She didn't even call him one time last night and she normally calls him back to back when he's with me.       Why do you think the tables are turning on this situation?
20080805134451AAr5D7r	Family & Relationships;Family	Dad doesn't respond right away when spoken to?	It seems like everytime I try and say something to him he doesn't answer, like I have to repeat my question 4 or 5 times before he answers... hes done this for as long as I can remember. Its not like he can't hear me, he'll usually respond a few minutes after I've asked or said something and he'll respond in a frustrated tone. What could the cause of this be?  He comes across rude by not responding and If I bring it to his attention he calls me names and tries to make me feel bad
20090227111127AA4FxY3	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	How do I become more confident?	I'm a 20 year old girl in college and I feel like I continuously struggle with my self confidence. Its weird though, I don't necessarily look at my self and think I'm ugly or dumb the main the I do is I second guess my self and I compare myself to other people way too much. For example I have a twin sister and she always seems to have guy attention but for some reason I hardly ever do and I can't help but ast my self what is wrong with me. All my good friends tell me I have a great personality (which I think I do to) but I have trouble showing it to people I'm not comfortable with. I honestly think I am very blessed when it comes to the looks department (I'm 5"8, 130 lbs, I have a nice smile and I think I have a pretty face) but I don't seems to attract people other than nasty guys at the bar I work at. Another thing thats weird about me is that I compare myself to other people but at the same time I don't feel like I should act like something just so people will like me.    I just feel like I have so much to offer but I feel like nobody gives me a chance to show them. I think part of my problem is I hold my self back too much and I want to be able to go to new places and be confident in myself. Like I've never really had that many guys friends but in honesty I would love to just hang out with some guys. I just want to find the balance between being myself but pushing myself out of my comfort zone enough and being confident. I dunno I'm just confused and I need some advice on how to be more confident
20090227104555AA8M2zR	Family & Relationships;Friends	I was badly betrayed by a close friend. Now I have trouble trusting anyone. What should I do?	Current friends of mine have shown that they are trustworthy, but so did my former friend.  But after years of friendship I found out that she was sneaking around with my brother in law.  Now she is the reason he won't let my sister see her kids.  I'm so angry and hurt by what my friend did.  I will never speak to her again, but I find myself checking up on my current friends.  I'm always paranoid that they are friends with her behind my back (even though they've told me that they can't stand her), or that they're telling her things about me.  I'm just paranoid.  This former friend of mine had been relaying personal information about me to many many people, including my BIL.  She even went as far as to detail my home to all sorts of seedy people.  I don't want to have this happen again.  How do I learn from my past and keep from repeating it?        Let me say again, I was very close to her, I had known her since grade school.  I don't know what else i could have done....  I just don't want to repeat my history.
20090227110515AAKUDsK	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	Why Did My Friend Sabotage My Relationship With This Guy?	I have a 12 yr friendship going with my best friend. She's 21 and I'm 20. I met a 17 yr old guy in November 08 that I really like, but I'm a shy person so I always wanted her around just to kinda break the ice.      Well my friend decided that she doesn't like him so she went out of her way to act foolish in front of him. (He's black & so am I and she went on a rant about how much she hates black men. She's white.) She went to his apartments at 1 am last saturday while everyone in his place was sleeping and started screaming his name at the top of her lungs.      He said that was very disrespectful and now he wont talk to me anymore. I feel like such a fool cuz I know I shouldn't have brought her around.      Why would she do this? I've never done anything like this to her. Should I still befriend her? Any advice is appreciated.

20090227105127AAmtemj	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Plz Help Me out!!  I'm Under so much stress!!!?	The girl whom I really really like has been acting really different lately.  Shorter texts, not paying attention to me, and no smiley faces in her texts-but idk if that's an issue to be worrying about.  I decided to send her a six page text telling her that I had strong feelings for her, that I've been playing it safe with her cuz I'm afraid of rejection, and at the end I asked her if she lost interest in me.  Two weeks ago she told me she liked me, but she's never shown it so I figured I had to ask this question.  For 5 hours: nothing.  It seemed like an eternity.  Then after 10 she sent me a text saying: "A girl can only be rejected so many times as well.  I like you but you don't seem confident in yourself.  How do you expect me to be confident in you if you're not confident in yourself?"  Idk what to make of this.  What does this mean??? Thanks to anyone who helps.

Well there's this girl that I used to work with, and I met up with her the other day, just for a few drinks and she is goin out halloween night. But the thing is she asked me to meet up with her, and go out "2geva" exactly how she put it. and she was kind of flirty, and just sent me kisses after I said bye on text...      But the thing is I never really thought that she ever thought of me that way and she used to tell me about like everyone she was interested in, so I just thought that she only liked me as a friend, which would make more sense.      Also that fact that she said, you don't have to go with me if you don't want to, means that maybe she doesn't want me to think more of me goin with her...      sorry bout the length...

20081112091947AAKnSEs	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Should I keep doing this or will he get annoyed?	This guy and I were together for months but didnt go out cause he told me he was too busy with school and work. I said that I wasnt going to do it anymore without a proper relationship and he asked me to be his gf. We only went out for a week before he told me that his grades were too low and he doesnt want a gf. He kept saying that he doesnt want to lose me and that he gets attached to the people he has sex with. I told him that its not like we were great friends before and he got upset cause I guess he thought we were. He told me that if someone hurts me or if I ever need him, he will always be there for me. He calls me about once a week just to say hi and see how everything is going. He told me that he really likes talking to me now but I dont know if he is being honest or if he just wants me as an available booty call. Now when he calls, i am not so "available" for him. I dont call HIM anymore and when he does, I call him back hours later. Before I would drop everything for him and was always there, as he was my #1 priority. I feel as if he wants me even more now that its not easy for him and I want him to know how I felt when he did this to me. Should I keep doing this or is he getting annoyed and will eventually give up?

So we were together talking in my room and i spoke to her about my new girlfriend (that isnt her). She was fine when i said that but then later into the conversation she just flipped and kept swearing at me! She desroyed the curtains, recked the bed, and she scratched me on the face and chest. She said that i was "Such a prick." I dont know what to do now.    I dont even know how to approach her anymore. WHat can i do be her friend again? She wont speak to me or answer her phone or reply to any of her messages.      We were really close like we could fall asleep in each others arms and tell each other everything and kiss each other on the cheek all the time WITHOUT having feelings for each other.I know we had no feelings cause i asked her if she did on numerous occassions but now i know she lied when she responded "naa."      Shes 18 and im 17 if this helps.      Ok so what can i do to be her friend again?
20090227110540AAzD9bi	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	What would you do in this scenario taken from Dr. Phil show?	Ok so imagine you and your husband/wife are excited and go to an orphanage to adopt a baby. This baby is new born baby. So after 7 months of you raising the kid you get  a knock on the door and its police.       It seems the baby was put up for adoption by a mother without the knowledge of the father. After months of looking for the baby the father finally located the child at your home. The mother's family did not approve of her marriage to the father and she was going through divorce with the husband when she put the baby up for adoption.       Would you give the baby back to the father?

20090227105830AA0fg3R	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	I need your opinions and thought everyone - preferably guys. please?	You;re at the gym and you see a girl and keep looking at her and then you go up to her to try talk to her. You ask for her name and she says that you dont have to know her name, in a laughing and friendly way and you just leave it. You keep seeing her in the gym couple of other days and you talk to her again another day asking how she is and stuff and she asnwers you but thats it. Again, after couple of other days you start talking to her again and she talks back to you, in a friendly way and you tell her you think shes beautiful and ask if she has a boyfriend and what she does during her spare time and stuff.    Then everday that you see her in the gym you guys talk like friends.

We were in the computer lab and there was one seat left avaliable so he had to sit next to me, he had no choice. I've had a class with him before (last symester). It seems like he hates me or something though. When he went to sit next to me, I tried to say Hi to him, but he wouldn't look over at me at all (it's kind of like he was doing that purposely) so then 5 seconds later a seat opened up and he looked at it and like went for it as fast as he could. Sometimes I catch him staring at me too, so it's kind of weird. Also I was asking people if they wanted me to take their books back for them, this guy like hesitated and turned around right when he was about to ask me, so I just asked for him, I asked him if he wanted me to take his book and he was like "oh yeah, thanks". Im so confused, why does he act so weird around me, its like he secreatly hates me.

We're in 8th grade now. He's showed a lot of signs that he kind of likes me. He told one of my bffs that he thought I was cute. he told the other one he didn't think I was cute. He tells the one that he told that I was cute, what girls in our grade he likes. He's liked 2 girls since school started. I like him so much. I think that he thinks that I don't like him anymore, even though my bff told him 2 months ago that I still like him. He looks at me a lot, I have 3 classes with him and I always see him looking at me. When ever I'm at my locker and he's at his, he's looking at me. He's just so cute! Is it my looks thats holding him back? Here's a pic. of me       http://www.flickr.com/photos/25994743@N0...    I mean do you think he'll reject me if I ask him out? I probably won't do it...

I use to bite my lip but then i bit back. After feeling really bad about it. My parents are useless but when id tell them not to give the kids sweets before a meal they would still do it behind my back and its hard getting my son to eat on a good day.    Tell us what to do with the kids our house in the end i would either stay upstairs or end up snapping.   They were so suffocating but they would bend over backwards to help. MIl go on and on for hours about herself not even ask how i am, FIL go on and on about how we should decorate our house etc they did my head in.       But now i reflect and i do feel bad but i did have depression so maybe this was the cause i just dont know.   Things are better and we now get on ok but i cant help feeling bad. My hubbys auntie and uncle dont like me but i havent done anything to them and they dont treat my hubbys mum n dad that well either so hypocritical, make s me upset that its like this.

20090227110047AAHy7nz	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	This in no way, shape or form involves marriage or divorce, but i want opionins about him? (very long)?	why is he doing this?      2 nights ago my ex called me and was being really sweet and we talked for about 2 hrs. Then he finally ask me if I would ever hook back up with him, meaning would i be in a relationship. I told him prob. not bc we are in 2 different places in life. I want to keep my virginity and he wants to rush things. He practically hounded me for sex while we were together.   After he dumped me, he went right to another girl and lost his virginity with her within 2 wks. This was one of the reason why we broke up. Not bc he cheated on me but he hounded me for sex the entire time we were together and I simply wasn't ready, and it was getting to the point that he made me feel like garbage. we were together for 9 months and i know that's a long time but from the very beg. he hounded me for sex, which is why i was uneasy.      So last night he called me and asked me was i close to my comp. I was like yeah. He said, could you log into this dating website and type in this girl's name. I want to see what she looks like. I was soo outraged bc he simply could have made up a fake account and found the person. While I am a part of that particular website, don't you find it strange and just crazy that he'd call ME and ask me to log in so I can look at some girl for him. Especially when he has his on comp. and internet.      Why did he do this? I keep seeing this pattern over and over.      He asks me to date him about every month and when i say no.. he does something crazy. Like last month he called me and started crying about his ex gf. Now him and I have only been seperated since OCt. and I make it a point to not call him. Heck, I don't even now if he was seriously crying bc afterwards he asked me again would I go back out with him, and the thing about it is that him and the other girl were together in Dec. and HE called me asking if i would him give another chance.      How crazy is that? and the thing is that he was the one who dumped me and said i was crazy and that he didn't want 2 hear from but called 3 days later.   what is wrong with this guy. He is 20 and I am 21 and i am trying  my best to be a good person, he keeps doing this.      The thing is that he will actually be a good person for a while and then he'll ask if we can get together. when i say no, then he does something like i described above. it's just an ongoing cycle of this, and i get confused bc he can be a nice person but when i reject him, he turns into a DOUCHE.

20090227103047AAr12NY	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	I'm 15 and never had a boyfriend.?	I'm not a popular or anthing, but I have friends and get on with guys in class.      a few weeks ago, i got a note from a guy saying "you are pretty". I got such a shock. He's really unpopular- people say he's annoying but he's not that bad. I used to talk to him and stand up for him when people were mean to him. But I never considered the fact that he could potentially fancy me. I got such a shock!      This was the first and only time (apart from a valentines card i got when i was 8 from another guy i stood up for!) i've ever had anything like this and it makes me feel bad about myself.      I can't really pronounce my "r"s and "ou/ow"s. I think this is a factor. I also think i'm quite ugly and my boobs are too big (32E). I'm quiet until you get to know me. Here's a few pics of me       http://i257.photobucket.com/albums/hh210...     http://i257.photobucket.com/albums/hh210...       i also wear glasses in classes and they really don't suit my hair!    http://i257.photobucket.com/albums/hh210...

20090227111222AAfMmkO	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Why doesn't he want it? **PIC**?	My husband is 21 yrs old and I'm 18 and we JUST got married 7 months ago. Why doesn't he want it more?? I try to turn him on and I make myself as sexy as possible to make him want me more and he never wants it as much as I do? Don't get me wrong we have sex oftenand it's great, I just want it more than him and that's weird because I thought husbands are supposed to be the ones begging to get some all the time.lol Instead it's me. Is there something wrong?   Here's us:    http://s600.photobucket.com/albums/tt85/... 
20080502083453AAP3Sdh	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Help. Help. Help.?	Hi, I am a fourteen year old Black british girl. There is this mixed race girl that alot of bys like. She is mixed race, very big butt and medium chest and she is rude and mean and lets boys she deosnt even know give her love bits on her chest. It is really weird. It is as if boys only like the certain type of girls. Girls with either boobs or butts, pretty and not a geek. To be honest, I would probably get a boyfriend If I let boys give me loves bites in places like that or gave heads etc. I would like to have a boyfriend, like someone to text in a class your bored in or when it is late at night. Or to actually go out places with. But none of the boys I know (the rare that I actually do know) are like that and I go to a girls school. I could still go to partys, but still no boy fits the criteria. They are all ****.
20090227104028AAYzkfL	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Have you ever totally gotten over your ex....BUT?	But than you feel bored, like you've got a void and nothing can fill it? Like you were so used to always dwelling your relationship, and now you dont care.......but you're nervous because now you've got nothing to worry about..like you're so used to the agony and misery of the relationship that now its gone and you dont know how to live?

20090227105618AAy92Vx	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Was she interested in me or not?  Because she just rejected me?  My entire fraternity is mind-numbed right now?	Here were the signs:      - First day I come in she gazes over and fixes her hair. She looks back twice.   - Next day I sit right behind her. She looks at me weird, a bit startled. I introduce myself.   - When we're walking out and it was raining, she said "sooo would you like to get under my umbrella?" When I refused, she seemed a bit disappointed (I was testing her)   - I walk right up to her and she acts nervous.   - Her eyes get WIDE when she talks to me.   - When shes talking to other guys, she gazes over at me every few minutes.   - When I go to talk to her, she immediately STOPs talking to all guys! And focuses 100% attention on me. The only time she goes back to talking to her guy friends is when introducing me to them lol.   - Her voice changes significantly around me. I heard her talking to a professor once and I didn't even recognize her voice - it was deeper than the one she uses around me.      ok. So we're walking...all of a sudden I say "wanna have dinner on friday?" And she rejected me! She said she was already dating someone. But her facebook says shes single....2 days after she rejected me, she took down the "single" status, but deleted the news feed (caught it in time!). The day after, she came to class with full-on makeup. She shoots a sharp glance over at me. And that was it.      I don't get it?? What the hell is going on? I'm guessing she wasn't interested, but was just being a flirt?

20090227093956AARxInF	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	GUYS: Do you prefer...?	A skinny girl with a stuck-up attitude who is more likely to leave you for someone with more money and/or cheat on you      or      A more voluptious girl that will be faithful and love you always?      I ask this because my boyfriends sister is very beautiful and skinny and model-ey looking, but she can't get a boyfriend without giving it up to him, and then after she gives it up, they leave her. I, on the other hand, am not skinny or model-ey looking (unless you mean a plus-size model), but guys want to go out with me, and I have NEVER gave it up to any of them or anybody. I call it my "Perez Charm".      Why is it that that happens?
20090227100524AATg7lh	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Why do women do this?	I see a lot of women on here complain that there are no more good men to choose from. The reason I find this odd is because I always see women picking the guys who are obviously complete a******? Then they assume that all men are. There are plenty of good men out there. So why do you choose to date the jerks, and then complain about it?

My co-working pal got really upsets with me yesterday because I aparentlys ruined her "poofed" which is a hairedstyle for those of you who dont know it a hips hairedstyle for the younger pals. I thought I could help her because I thought she was trying to slicks her haired back and when i messed with it, i guess ruinsed it. to make it up to her I bought her these clips ons that make your hair haves a high poofed, she threw them at me upon handings them to her.. why is my pal treating me like this? i didnt know she was so crazy about hairsed.

20090227104053AArlPqM	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	I give up. I don't know what to do?	Every part of my life seems to be turning completely sh!t. My parents broke up last year, and both have new partners they're living with and I'm having trouble dealing with it and accepting everything.       My ex boyfriend of 11 months and I broke up a few weeks ago and no matter what I do I can't let go. We're still best friends but he has a new girlfriend and it's like a knife in the side everytime I see them together and I don't think he gets how much it's hurting me.       My grandad was diagnosed with prostrate cancer a few weeks ago and that hit hard, but at least it was treatable and probably cureable. But then yesterday he was told he has an inoperable brain tumour. My world has just completely plummeted and I hate the way there is nothing I can do about it, anywhere or anyway at all. I just feel like crying all the time, I'm filled with this frustration, anger, sadness and loneliness and I don't know how to deal with it.      My grandad's always been my refuge, I talked to him when things got bad and he was always supportive. Now he's ill I don't know what to do. He's crying all the time, not eating, not sleeping and I hate how there's nothing I can do about it.      And I'm supposed to be doing my gcse's in a few weeks time. I don't feel I even can. I just want to give up. I don't know what I'm doing here. I've lost, or am losing, everything that means the most to me. And I feel completely pathetic. Sorry it's so long, but please, if anyone could give me any advice or anything at all I would appreciate it a lot.

Time for another good question:      You are with someone hurt by a cheater. They lack trust and are ready to bail from the relationship when ever there is change in temperature in the room. No doubt the person loves who you are but they are just so scared of getting hurt they have anxiety. How do you get that person to open up, relax, and earn there deepest fresh child like trust?

I threw a cup cake away in the trash and the trash was getting pretty full and my roommate told me to take out the trash. I asked him why he would even say that to me and I said if it is that big of a deal just do it yourself. It is not like I don't clean or do chores I just did not feel like doing it right then. And he seemed to make a big deal out of it. Was I wrong by telling him to do it himself?

So, I took the initiative and asked him on a second date about 2 weeks afterwards. He got really excited and agreed to it. A couple hours before our date he called and said, "I feel really bad but I got tied up at work and won't be able to make it." He didn't mention rescheduling and I said don't worry about it. We've talked a few times since then but he hasn't brought up rescheduling. Since I asked HIM and he canceled, who should reschedule. I don't want to seem desperate and needy by asking him out AGAIN (I already went on a limb and out of my comfort zone when I did it the first time).   BTW he is shy.

She was really closed to me trying to see the stage and now and again tried to pass words with me and about 5 minutes into it i could feel her crutch being rubbed up and down my leg.

20081005130127AAhrLqC	Family & Relationships;Family	Parental stress - what to do and how to deal with my mum?	Im just looking for some advise and comfort. I am 20 and still living at home, a full time uni student. I work, making $300 a week (never more).  I've thought about moving out and renting - but it is soo expensive alone. Help anyone who has had the same situation.      My mother, strains me out. I have curfews (have to be home before 10pm) and restrictions (cannot go for a holiday alone, sleep over anywhere etc). Pretty much, I am expected to be home whenever I don't have uni or work.      Its not just me over reacting here. My parents doctor has told me that if I need medical approval of sick parents for my studies (to help with my marks) just to let him know [this was during my hsc anyways]. My dad suffers slightly from depression and my mother is the devil (lol). She nags everyday, nags loudly in the middle of the night, nags when im studying for an exam. nag nag nag - and I mean, screaming - crying - yelling - 3 to 4 hours nag.       Ive tried ending it twice because of her a few years back.  Some of the comments she makes puts me down and distorts my sanity.       My hubby to be is catholic, I am from a muslim family. my mother wants him circumsized and would prefer him to convert to Islam. I am not religious. We have discussed our children's religion with my partner to be catholic as we live in Australia and that is the best option - my mother, if she knew this, would go ape sh*t.       I can't make decisions about my future and how 'I' want it without offending my mother. I have restrictions on the amount of time I can have to see my fiance. I am constantly told 'off' and 'put down' - for my studies [though I have never failed], for working [cause I do childcare work and thats degrading apparently], for my fiance [well my mother never praises him like she does with my brother's girlfriend].       I do not know what to do. Help? advise please.      ** sorry for the long question.

20080710061945AAPwAwQ	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Guys, have you ever not dated a woman because of her job?	I don't care what a woman makes, but when I meet a woman and shes something of a store clerk of waitress it tends to be a huge turn off, if they are going to school that's one thing but if that's all they plan on doing it makes me think they are just looking for a free ride. I would want someone who wants better for themselves, I would like money to be a non issue in a relationship, I am not a big spender and I'm not a tightwad either but I make decent money but I don't want to struggle in life like my parents did.      So is it wrong to turn a woman away because she's a waitress, she doesn't even have to have a college degree just some sort of career.

20081015074004AArkjCo	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Can I ask women a question please?	It's about ogling or when you think a guy is ogling you. Sometimes us guys do, but I usually try not to make it too obvious like checking out your reflection in a shop window as you walk the street, to look at your sexy bits, and then make eye contact as you pass me. But today my eyes wandered in the direction of a woman's clevage purely out of habit. I didn't stare deliberately - Honest! The thing is... she closed her coat as she passed me because she probably noticed me looking at her rather figure-hugging top. I felt myself blushing because I didn't mean to ogle. She was pretty though. My question is: Ladies, what do you think when you notice a man looking at you in this way, even if it's just a brief glance?

20090227105908AAdOqTE	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	My friend needs help...please?	Ok so i have this friend who is dating this guy who i think is lying to her all the time and she believes everything he says. everytime they are supposed to hang out he cancels and comes up with this lame excuse. Well this time his excuse was that his friend was in the hospital so he couldn't hang out. So i told her to ask him which hospital his friend is in and if he is in critical condition. He said yes he is in critical condition. SO i told her that he is lying because my mom works at a hospital and she said that many hospitals only let family in to see a patient in critical condition not friends. So then she texted him and said you are lying because they don't let friends in just family.  He said yeah i know they usually don't but i know the people at the hospital so they sneak me in.      Is he feeding her BULL CRAP of wat?      It makes me mad she still believes him! live serisouly he is a liar.      What are your opinions on this??
20081015093002AAUu8kV	Family & Relationships;Other - Family & Relationships	Im confused and don't know what to do?	So me and my girl break up but were staying friends best friends, but we still love each other. This is like the 3rd time we broke up. Even when were not in a relationship it feels like we are. She thinks she likes this guy but she don't know for sure cause she loves me. It seems like lately everything has gone down hill. I don't know how to explain it its complicated. So i need help with this predicament of mine....I DON'T WANT NO NEGATIVE FEED BACK!!!!
20090227100444AAxy7Hh	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	I want this girl...but everything says NOPE.?	So I met this very attractive girl in a Philosophy Club that I am attending at a college university. Eventually I did ask her for her phone number and successfully got her digits. And then upon talking with her I find out that she's a freshman (I'm a senior, though I had no idea because she seems very mature for her age) And I found out she's a big Christian (not exactly a problem-ish, but maybe) So long story short, recently, because I know she is so religious, I just flat out told her I wanted to talk about all things dogma with her. Heck I am in a way interested in that stuff given my own background, but at the same time I know it was just because I was looking for an excuse to hang with her. I told her I wanted to yap with her personally because she had taken the same philosophy classes as I and so I wanted to know her opinion on where all this religious stuff fit in. So we hung out and talked shop.    All the while though it was slightly flirtacious, and then somehow we got into talking about Jesus turning water into wine...and then we started talking about sexual immoralities and being tempted by things. Meanwhile, I found out she was a very sheltered girl in highschool, which would explain the well trained proper attitude (I dunno, before I knew how young and religious she was I thought it was just because she had experienced enough of the world and she was that mature, but nope)            Anyway, I'm wondering if I should even go after this girl? What's working for me is that we do click pretty well, and she's hella attractive. But what's working against me is her age (I'm not sure she knows what she wants yet), plus her ultra religiousness (it felt kinda weird talking about God, but also thinking I want to jump on you at the same time). PLUS she's of a different race and so I have no clue how her parents would feel about us being together. Anyway, the meet ended sorta dryly, and she told me we should hang out in a different place next time "if there is a next time". (She invited me to hang out at her dorm room because she was working on an art project there. Although I'm not sure if there was any inuindo to that - I'll admit I'm still finding it tough to read girls sometimes) Gah, what's the point of meeting a hot girl that you click with but everything else is working against your favor?      Welp, sorta anti-climactic, but after typing this, I think I'll answer my own question: should I pursue this girl? Answer: Nope. Just move on. But, of course, I don't want to. She's even an art major and I love those kind of girls. Dah! But I digress.      (Coughs - It still would be good to get advice about this type of relationship in general incase something similar to it happens in the future though)
20090227104203AAqjk7n	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	How would you handle this horrible sex situation?	I'm in college and was infatuated with this guy. We hadn't known each other for very long when he tried to have sex with me. I said no cause we weren't dating. He said he liked me, just didn't want to date me. But last night, for some reason I let it happen. A few minutes in, he stopped and said he couldn't feel anything cause of the condom. He said that it was a waste of time and I left. Who does that? I don't even know how to react.
20090227102839AAyL40t	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Why are girls standards so darn high these days?	I mean it's getting hard to even pick up a fat chick these days. It just seems as though women are TOO picky in this day and age. They all think that they deserve some Brad Pitt or Johnny Depp when they themselves do not look like an Angelina Jolie. I don't get it. Why are women these days so picky and choosy when it comes to men? It's not even that I am bad looking myself, it's just that I am not a superstar handsome.       Why is it that men aren't that picky while women ( who aren't even attractive) will settle for nothing less than a "model" type?

20090227093814AA2hAck	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Have I done the right thing ?	It concerns this situation:       http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;...       So even if Daisy didn't like it, I went to the pub with Sarah. She told me how dumping me for Duane was a mistake, and that she wanted me to move back in with her. I told her off, even though I wasn't one hundred percent sure. After having said my piece, Sarah left the pub.      I then phoned Daisy, to ask if she would come over to the pub - I did need someone to talk to - and she was reluctant, but when I reassured that Sarah was done and gone, Daisy was there in five minutes, even though it always takes me ten minutes to get there.      We had a great talk, and we danced to a band that was playing live cheesy songs of the 40s and 50s. I just hope I did the right thing. What do you think ?

20090227112231AAeoVhN	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Does he still like me or is he over me (sorry its long)?	okay about a year ago i was talking to this guy named ken and we hit it off but it seemed that he was moving to fast....i found out he had a girlfriend and he told me that he wanted to break up with her to get with me. i told him not to do that because that would be wrong and i would feel bad. So i just stopped talking to him because he had a girl. the next semester i got a boyfriend. one day ken's friend came and told me that ken was pissed i had a boyfriend and that he was really hurt and that he broke up with his girlfriend anyway after i told him not to so we could be together. apparently he had this whole plan to wait until after the summer to tell me he broke up with her and try to get me back. a couple of months later (11 months) my boyfriend and I broke up and ken got together with this other girl. But his friend told me that he only did it because he was tired of waiting for me....and that ken's girlfriend didn't like me because they told her that ken will never like her as much as he liked me. Ken friend also told me that they argue all the time and he wants to break up with her but he hasn't did it yet...so i was just wondering what is his deal...
20081114122142AA5nhOo	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	OMG! Ok serious problem? I need YOUR advice!!! PLZ!?	I have been dating this boy (lets call him "M") for about 2wks.      And yesterday I flirted all day long with this hot guy (call him "S"). It was innocent flirting, just playful and were were having fun.      But then "M" kissed me! It was the worst kiss of my life, I felt Absolutely nothing...so today when he tried to kiss me again I pushed him away and he looked stunned and was like omg, what?      I feel soo bad, but I cant get "S" out of my head! And well, he has a reputation of kinda a whore, I dont want to get involved with him like that, but having fun with him would be different.      So like what do I do? I cant change my feelings for "M" or "S" but I all ready dumped "M" before because of my feelings for my ex.    I feel really bad and Im very confused.    HELP!

20090227103148AAokRh4	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	This is going to sound really weird, but...?	I live in a double at college with a roommate.   I brought hall cough drops to school with me, but i didnt like them and havent eaten any since.   One day we lost the remote to the tv and i saw 1 cough drop wrapper on the floor under my bed near the heater. I thought it was weird because  i hadnt eaten any. A week later I dropped something off my bed and noticed that there were at least 15 cough drop wrappers all ripped up near the heater! I asked my roommate if she was eating my cough drops and she said no she had her own (a different kind). We asked anyone that has been in our room in the past week if they had eaten any cough drops and they all said no. We though maybe they were falling out of the radiator? But then I was folding laundry and putting it away in my bottom drawer of my dresser. There were 40 hall cough drop wrappers just laying all in my clothes in the drawer. Most of them were in the corners of my drawer all bunched up on different sweatshirts. I was really freaked at first, but took all my clothes out and there was nothing in the drawer other than the wrappers and 1 uneaten cough drop. Whats even freakier is that the cough drops are put away in a drawer that shut up. We thought maybe some sort of animal was in the room (my roommate got bit by something the other day when she was sleeping) but the cough drops are shut in the drawer and they are opened on both ends. Does anyone have any ideas what might be eating these cough drops?

He gets on me about my weight witch I am working on and trying so hard to lose weight.

20081103180218AAgbISe	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	Whos' controlling who?	Your husband is hiding the cellphone bill, you are not able to get access to the account. You are not able to see who he is calling, but he can see your calls, becuase he has the bill going to his secret e-mail account. He wants you to bring him a grocery reciept, when you do the grocery shopping. And he wants to see your credit card bills. But, he has everything personal about himself locked with passcodes. Now,who's controlling who?..

20090227095546AAyzqcn	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	My looks............?	(Please read all of it guys) Let me explain. Right now I'm 13 years old. 11 months ago I was drop dead gorgeous, even my friends use to say how amazingly good looking I was, girls couldn't help but stare at me, everyone was jelous of me. I felt really happy, I'm not smart, not good enough at any sports to get anywhere in life and overall I thought God had given me one trait.       In 11 months I feel like God had cruely taken that one thing away from me. The one thing that made me happy but now I have nothing.   I don't know what happened. Back then my face had perfect skin, my teeth were good, my eyes were amazing, me lips were nice, my nose was perfect too and my hair was shockingly great... But what the hell happened. My nose has turned bigger, my lips look different and I honestly feel ugly (VERY UGLY). The EXTREMELY hard part for me to understand is how my looks could have gone so fast and so quickly. If there was any time for my looks to go why now, why...... if my looks will never come back then I have just missed the chance of a life time to have that many girls adore you.      I had taken care of myself fine. I just want to cry and ask God to give them back but everyday I wake up, I look to the past and remember all those girls crowding around me. I don't think I'm ugly but I think I am getting uglier every day one by one. Guess what, my friends will get better looking but no, not for me, I will probaly get uglier as life goes on.. I would do ANYTHING to be that good looking again and you know why..because I am absoutely nothing. I am poor, I am sad now, I am useless, I am complete utter waste.     I have a few things to ask, It would be great if you could answer them.       :How could my looks possibly change so quickly? (I started going through puberty before my looks changed)       :Will I ever get it back?       :Also, is it just me, is it my insercurity right now, well I don't think so because I know how good looking I was then and I know what I look like right now.        Well thats it, please answer guys, I want to know whats going on because I am TRUELY upset. Thankyou for reading all of this...

20090227104544AAvi8py	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	Once a cheat always a cheat?	Discuss....   I mean, I broke up with someone (forced to really) last month as it turned out he was married. His wife literally nearly killed him and there was a LOT of drama.      I didnt know he was married, and when she found out, I truly thought that was it for me and him. He was so remorseful and I thought he genuinely made a mistake.  He went back to her and I backed off.      He called me a week after all this, to say his wife had made him change his number so I had no way of calling him again, and to wish me well. I was gutted, but understood.      Anyway, fast forward to this week...he called me again. He wants to start up again when the dust has settled.      I honestly thought he had learned his lesson and for that reason, even though I was devastated that he was happily married, I chose to let him go for that reason, I wanted him to be happy, and I put it down to a mistake on his part.      If his wife forgave him (I dont think I could have) why would a guy risk it?      I have conducted myself very well thru this and never lost my temper or even used any bad words etc - even though I could have gone round there and really f***d things up for him!

20081105023624AAJFEwX	Family & Relationships;Family	Is something wrong with me?	My mum wasn't exactly the nicest person in the world. at first i could understand her, because she had nine kids, me, my two brothers and six sisters. so she was stressed most of the time, and like i said i thought i could understand her when she went berserk. she usually never hits, but she's constantly berating me, making me feel like **** and it's a custom of hers to throw me out of the house every month : )   I don't live with her anymore, i live with my dad, but she was always so horrible to us that now i can think of nothing but getting back at her, usually just a good telling off, but sometimes i feel like doing something really violent for the way she treated us and me for years. is something wrong with me? should i really be feeling this way?
20080710081504AAKNfhn	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Will this feeling ever stop?	I don't mean to sound desperate and I'm not looking for attention but I'm genuinely starting to think I will be alone for ever and I truly need some suggestions. I am 26 and I've been single for 4 years. I don't have many friends because the people I'm around at work and outside of work are at least 10-20 years older than me, married, have kids and have lives of their own. The only guy I thought I actually would have a chance with and was very compatible with more or less rejected me this summer because he's 'not looking for a relationship right now'. I am really feeling the blunt of being alone and it's affecting me negatively. I don't know what my options are for meeting anyone else. And truthfully, I am not real certain how to get passed this right now. I have considered counseling but if anyone else can relate to these kinds of feelings I would appreciate your help on what I should do to feel a little better. Thanks!!
20080708092829AAp4UFG	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Your advice please. Should I forget about this?	There's a guy that isn't looking for a relationship right now but says he wants to be friends...I really like him. I'm fine with just being friends because I respect the fact that he doesn't' want a relationship right now. Here's the thing. I haven't heard from him in nearly 2 weeks even though I had asked him (called him) to go grab some coffee about a week and a half ago. He said he couldn't so I was like, that's fine just let me know what's good for you. Well, I have heard nothing back and I have made no effort to get in touch with him because to be honest, I was a little upset that he wouldn't even return my call. So, basically I've gotten mixed signals from him...says he wants to hang out with me yet makes no effort to get in touch with me. Should I try to contact him once more or just completely forget him? Thanks for your advice!

20080608143549AA9C14f	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Help! Need advice about what is appropriate to wear?	I am most likely going to be hanging out with a guy I really like this week (not sure what day). The thing is we are just going to be at his place watching a movie and I want to look great but not be overdressed. Does anyone have any suggestions for me? I don't know why but I am nervous about this. By the way I am over 21 so please don't suggest anything too short. Thanks!!!!!
20080705105324AAWbqZo	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Should I call him or just forget it?	Me and this guy started hanging out in May. Long story short, he doesn't want a relationship right now ( I asked him if he was at all interested in dating me) but he told me he still wanted to hang out with me (which is fine with me). About 2 weeks ago we were going to try and go catch a movie or something but he had to go out of town. He's been back for about a week and a half now and I e-mailed him after he got back to see if he wanted to do something. I haven't heard back from him. I guess my question here is do I e-mail, call or text him again or just quit trying and let it go? I mean he knows how to get in touch with me, I'm a little bitter I guess. Thanks for your help/advice!

20080520064938AAtfWdj	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Confused, Nervous and in Need of Advice!?	Alright, so I've been spending some time with this guy that I really like. We've been out on 4 separate occassions and we've had a great time together. However, I haven't heard from him since the last time we were together (Saturday). I don't want to come across as pushy or overbearing because I'm not that kind of person, therefore I'm kinda hesitant about getting in touch with him. I'm also just constantly nervous that I'm not doing the right thing (like maybe I should be contacting him). I will say that this time of year is busy for both of us (we both work full time in the same profession). Should I be concerned that I haven't gotten an e-mail from him or anything? Thank you for any opinions/advice!

20081023053042AAa0GAq	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Help. I just don't know how to help my boyfriend?	My boyfriend has been very despondent since Monday. He says he'll 'be back to himself' and to just 'keep doing what I do' when I ask how I can help him. But it's concerning to me because he just isn't himself at all. He wants me to continue to come see him every day after I'm off work but when I go to see him he doesn't even act like he's glad to see me. He's also getting deeply philosophical (which he is a lot anyway) but now it's even more so. How can I help him get through whatever it is he's going through? Or do I just take him for his word that this will pass. Thanks for your insights.

20081111170940AAFxCZ0	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	I confronted my boyfriend about this. Did I do the wrong thing?	Last night me and my boyfriend were getting some groceries and he stole a gallon of milk because he was out of money ( I know this because the milk was not on the receipt when I looked at it). This really bothered me. He could tell I was upset and I confronted him telling him that I don't steal and I don't believe that others should. He felt badly after I confronted him saying he was a bad guy etc. He's very good to me and I didn't want to 'scold' but that bothered me a lot that he would do that. Was I wrong to confront him? Thanks for your opinions.

A friend of mine (a girl) who works in the same area as her, has been talking to her for me basically.  I only asked her to find out if she was single or not, but instead she told her I like her and think shes "cute" and ****.  Then she proceeded to point me out and tell her my name etc.  Lol.  Anyway. I'm an extremely shy person, and so far (today) the most we've said is Hi and a smile to each other.   This is while passing each other in the halls.  What do I say to her? I want to start talking to her more so I can eventually ask her to hang out, etc.      Or should I ask her to hang out,  and THEN talk to her?        Either way, What do I say to her? How can I get a conversation going with someone that knows I like her?  I'm going to take your advice into serious consideration, so please give me some good stuff.  Also keep in mind I'm a shy person, and she's gorgeous.. so that doesn't help lol.

This is because all of his money goes to my 26 year old brother. My brother is a pothead, with five kids. He beats his wife (shotgun wedding....plus she is illegal so he had to marry her, or she would go back to mexico). My older brother breaks things and beats people when hes mad. He threw his cellphone in the street, and it broke. So my dad bought him a NEW cellphone. This makes me sick. My dad pays all my brothers bills, food, house, healthcare, car, phones, cigarettes, etc. My brother is a mooching baby! This isnt fair to me and my little brother. Our clothes have holes in them, and I dont even have a bed! I sleep on a mattress. My dad makes a good living, but all of his money goes to my brother. What can I do?? This pisses me off.

His sister told me that he hates me and doesnt want anything to do with me anymore. Which really hurts to know that he said that! I have noticed a change in behaviour, like he talks to me in a cold tone of voice, or if not, completly ignores me. But on the other hand he stares at me smiling more than ever! He has actually done this before, and it turned out he still liked me, and his sister has made up lies about that kind of stuff, but that doesnt explain his rudeness.    What do you think?

20081103180919AAaBdZK	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Just told a girl I like her, and she hasn't responded yet. Is this email appropiate?	Email -   *sigh*, I've been thinking about this for a while now and I realize that the email I sent after the first calling the previous email a mistake, is wrong. I meant it all, I just wanted to wait until we got to know each other better. I know I've sent multiple emails with no real feedback but thats alright because to be honest, I'm pretty stressed at the moment. When I talk you I forget about my problems and everything seems just dandy. In a way, I'm apologizing for pressuring you or bothering you, but in another way, I'm saying thanks, for lightening up my day =). I tend to overthink things, especially when there's a lot of time in between responses and I wish you would just drop a line or two. I'm not asking for a Y/N answer, just let me know you're getting these. Let me know if you think I'm annoying and you'd rather not talk to me, or if you're just not sure yet. I just hate being left out in the dark like this, I guess now I'm being naggy, again I'm sorry.       **Note**   We see each other weekly and had been talking for a week or so after knowing each other slightly for a year or so. The first couple emails I sent were replied pretty quickly, then they responses began to spread out in time. It's been 8 or so days since I told her I was interested in her and she's yet to say anything.

I'll call you tonight, or if not tomorrow." 3 days passed, he didn't call back. I called him today, he says that he has no money. but then I said that I'll cover for him. then he said yes. I know that usually he doesn't have money with him, but can this mean he's only going because I'm paying?
20081110090330AAicaEg	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Am I handling this right?? I need some mature (ages 18+) answers please!?	Im 21. Ive been seeing this girl for about a month and a half. She always accepts my date invites and always says we should do something afterwards. When we're together she always has a good time and seems to like me and always talks about doing stuff in the future. Weve been on about 4 dates and have hung out a few times. But she has been talking about her ex-bf recently and said she broke up with him a few months ago (they were together for 4 years) and hoped they would get back together but didnt. She then said she was hanging out with guys just so she would have someone to be with. I have had horrible experiences being a rebound so I want to be extra cautious. I plan to not make any kind of sexual move, including kissing, until Im sure shes actually interested in more than a rebound. I figure I will give her every opportunity to give up on me and move on to the next rebound if I was in fact a rebound. I know it sounds extreme but I really don't want to be another rebound with a girl I really like and I'd rather be nothing more than friends if it would just be a short rebound relationship. She just told me tonight shes lonely cause her roommates went home and asked me to come over and I said no because I don't want to be her shulder to cry on or the guy she calls when shes lonely. I want something real and am tired of random flings and hookups. Am I handling this right?

20081111124338AAER8qr	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Can you tell me what you think is really going wrong in this picture? (your opinion)?	last friday night i went to bed and my boyfriend was still up and he told me he was going to go over to a friends house and that he was going to take my keys and my phone with him in case i needed to call him cuz he didnt have a phone and he said he would be back around 9 or 10, well anyways i was like ok and went back to bed. i was up all night long waiting for him cuz he didnt show up and i didnt think to look at my computer so at 4:20 in the morning i went and looked at my computer and he had instant messaged (IMed) me saying that he was not comping home cuz the cops were thick and he was going to stay at his moms house, so i was like ok whatever. saturday morning around 9:00 he IMes me saying he wants to visit with his younger siblings and he didnt get payed till late that night, and yes i was kinda upset cuz i had a check to cash and i didnt have any cigs or toilet paper and i couldnt do this while i didnt have my keys so i bitched to him about it and he got mad and signed off, well anyways i did the opposite of what he told me to do which was stay home all day, i went and got my cigs and **** and wasnt home all day just to piss him off (by the worked and i'll tell you why in a sec). well later on that night i actually went home and found on my computer that he had IMed me say this "you r a ******* nasty slob, i dont want to be with you anymore cuz you are a drama queen and i w/ deal with it,, we are done" well for one how am i a nasty slob when i was the one picking up after his dumb ***? anyways tell me if i was wrong for this, i went to the store and bought a bottle of vadka and a jug of juice and i drank it all by my self with in like 20 mins, (now mind you this whole time all thats going through my mind is hate and kill) well when i got done he walks through the door and i guess i went right for the throat and squeezed, well then my manager of the apartment building came up cuz i was so drunk and i was being very loud and obnoxious and evidently i pushed my manager into the wall trying to catch my boyfriend to punch him but my manager grabbed me and put me in a sleep hold so i would calm down. but anyways four days later my boyfriend calls and says he dont want it to end like that so he wanted to get back with me and i dont understand why. ppl have told me that they think hes trying to get back with his ex and that hes just keeping in contact with me just in case it dont work out with her so he still has me on the side i guess but i dont know. im really upset about it although i dont show it to him. i just want to know whats really going on and i feel that if i come on here ask for your guys opinion that maybe i can get an idea of what i might be doing wrong or that he might be doing wrong. i dont know. but plz no downgrading answers or obnoxious answers i cant deal with stupid ppl right now im hurting enough as it is so plz take this story seriously. thank you and have a nice day
20081112092309AAECsMz	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Hi. Are we cheating, it is only text and msn chat.?	One month ago, I got a text, not ment for me, a wrong number, ever since, almost everyday we text each other, just mundane stuff, with a few connotations..just flirty, nothing heavy...said during our chats. He feels like an old friend already, trouble is, I am really starting to fall for him, I am single, he is married. Nothing has been said between us about meeting etc...we have hinted at what a disaster it would be, but gee, I was not/am not...looking for a relationship, but he has gotten under my skin, we have so much in common, I mean so much so that I have NEVER felt such an affinity with someone in my life, I know he feels it too, however he is more reserved on the fact, I know.  He just feels right and I so don't know what to do but, and this is a huge 'but', he has a wife, what should I do? and don't say ignore him, I dont think I can, he is never disrespectful about his wife, he's been married for 12 years and I think is just a bit bored, but he is a gentleman and really caring, he came into my life at a time when things were/are crap for me...not as such that I think I need a man, I know I don't, but really this is crazy, the whole thing just feels like fate, too many coincidences for it not to be....but my conscience is starting to nag me....please dont just judge me, I never entertain married men as a rule...but what's that saying...never say never!.

I know that sounds really short but i felt like we connected immediately in the first couple weeks.       He was 39 and I was 23. yes huge age gap but it worked kinda. Well we broke up in the first month because i decided i needed to figure out who i was. I did. and decided that i could still do it with him. I made a big jester and told him I loved him and wanted to try it again. He let me back in.       We broke up again and i believe it to be for the best. He is so much older and has his job and home and everything. And I'm still in college and plan to move away.       Did I make the right choice even though i feel like loved him?

Would you be able to last in a long distance relationship if you both truly loved each other and have been together since you were 13 and you're both 17 now. In june 08 one of you moved so you can only see each other about 7 times a month, sometimes even less, but you spend every holiday together. You tried to break up, but you were both miserable and when you saw each other again you got back together.

20090109110556AASwP60	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Does this guy like me?	There is this guy i like and he is very shy. He doesn't say much when he's with me but does around other people. In one class he sits near me but will talk to the 2 other girls mostly. He tends to look at me and when i look back he will either smile, or look away quickly. Then he texted a girl i know and told her that he fancies her which is totally out of character for him, because he wouldn't usually tell a girl if he fancies her. We talk to each other a bit in class and sometimes text/ IM but he isn't very good at making conversation. Does he like me, and if so why is he telling this other girl that he fancies her?
20090109203019AACgd6m	Family & Relationships;Other - Family & Relationships	What should I get my Boy Friend for his 27th birthday?	I want some advice on what to get my boyfriend for his 27th birthday.  He is the kind of guy who buys anything he wants when he wants it, so he is so hard to buy for!  We have been together for 2 and half years and we live together.  He reads a lot, likes to work with his hands, and plays a lot of Warcraft!  I will not buy him a giftcard.  They are impersonal and a scapegoat of a gift.  He is a music teacher, but has everything he needs in that arena.  I have a couple of ideas, including an air compressor kit with a staple gun and other attachments.  He has an industrial one he uses on projects at work, but nothing like that at home.  I would like to buy him a PS3, but I can't even afford the 40G.  I could buy him some nice clothes, but we did a lot of shopping over Christmas, and he is pretty much taken care of.  Guys especially, please let me know what you would like for your birthday (other than a naked woman/sex/BJ-because I know if I don't say it, half of the answers will be that ;)  Some past gifts I have bought him include fancy hair products(AVEDA, Crew, but he has enough right now), a robe (he loves), DVD's, a money clip (Tiffany's), Aerosmith guitar hero (which he hasn't had time to play!), felt bags for his trupmet mutes (a big hit), a Darth Vadar Mr. Potato Head, a nice meal, a night at the Fairmont (downtown SJ), sweatpants, a watch, a signed first edition of his favorite book, a very nice electric skillet (another big hit), and I'm sure a dozen other things I can't think of.  Please help!  Thanks in advance!
20090123121827AAnSed0	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Does this girl like me?	I met this girl at a New Year's Eve party, we exchanged phone numbers and have hung out a few times. We talk on the phone and through text message every day.       She comes to all of my hockey games. One time we were out a bar and I asked her what she was doing on Wednesday (when I had a hockey game). She said, "going to your game." I had told her a while back when my games were. And, believe it or not, she had never played pool before, so I got to teach her and got to do the whole thing from the movies where I stood behind her and helped her shoot.      She also remembers the little things from our conversation, and brought me coffee at work.       She calls me sweet (as in the romantic way...and maybe the cool way :))      She told me her friends were "creeping" my Facebook.      She gets all giggly and laughs at my stupid jokes whenever we talk.      What do you think? Does this girl like me?

Does a girl that likes big macho kinda man prefer sex to be a bit more rough? And does a girl who falls for gentle, sweet kinda guys feel more for romantic lovemaking? Or is there no connection between those things.   In other words, is your sexual preference in line with the rest of your personality? Or do you like to be someone else in the sack from time to time?   Shoot!

20081008082419AAOL4Dy	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	Porn question... Please help!?	Hi all,  My boyfriend stayed home from work today, not because he was sick just needed a day off.  He works very hard...  However, I know when he has the day off he looks at porn.  Not all day, but im sure he does and does not tell me, but I know.  I hate porn.. I am a beautiful girl, toned and have a pretty face and good confidence in myself, but I still hate the idea of him looking at other naked woman.  I know he thinks am beautiful, he tells me often and we have a great sex life, but it still hurts me.  I dont want to tell him because I dont want a fight..  Does it mean though that he enjoys looking at them more than me? Is it just a release thing? Boredome?  It makes me feel bad and I do not understand a mans facination with porn... I feel like im not good enough for him and thats why he looks at it.  Men dont need it they want it its a visual thing but why cant he just look at pictures of me, ive sent him naked pictures of me before which he says he likes a lot.  Does he think of these girls when he goes to have sex with me, does he think of me when he is looking at them.  should I feel bad about myself, I do?  I dont look at naked men and if I ever take care of myself which I never have to because he does an exellent job doing that for me every day!  Please help me understand....  :-)

20090227094542AA5WHPM	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	Question for you mature people about taking Ibuprofin for symptoms other than a fever?	Last week I had a sore throat for 2 days.  I took zinc, vitamin C and Advil/Ibuprofin for the pain.  That was like 2wice a day.  Next day i felt kind of cold. I took my temp and it showed a reading of 96.6.  I was shocked so I took it again and it read 96.7.  Then following 2 days I had a cough and cold a day later.  For the cold I was taking Advil.  again the temperature showed 96.9.  yesterday after a day and half of being nasaly congested and having my left ear blocked, i went to the Dr.  She said i have an ear infection and gave me antibiotics and Mucinex for the congestion.  I had ear pain also the night before yesterday adn then before i went to the Dr. yesterday I took Advils.  my temp at Dr.'s office was 96.9   Do you think my body temperature is lower because I am taking Advil and it is a natural fever reducer so it gets my temps down as well as helping relieve my pain and cold symptoms.  I have not had a fever throughout the whole week just pain from having infections and runny nose from the cold.

20090227095845AASd1ij	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	I think this girl likes me, but she says she's "sort of in a relationship"?	Hi :) There is this girl I go to university together with, that I like a lot.   She was always looking at me in class in a way that made me think she liked me. We often sit next to each other and talk during classes and so on. A couple weeks back I was walking home together with her, and I asked if she wanted to watch a film together with me, which she seemed eager to (at least I think so). We were watching the film and had some wine, but I didn't do any moves because she seemed a bit reserved. This was very well spotted by me because I called her a couple days after and asked if she has a boyfriend, and she said she "sort of did" but that it is complicated. What am I supposed to do? :( She's so amazing and I can't stop thinking about her! I mean, what girl in a relationship hangs out and drinks wine with other guys? :(

20090227101339AAZTS9a	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	My GF complimented an ex fling on Myspace, what would you do?	Ok, here's how this all came about.  I met my GF at work and we started to date each other.  After some time, this guy at work tells me he had a fling with her in the past and jokingly teased about me dating her.  It really bothered me so I confronted her on the topic to see if it was true.  She denied it at first however later on said she did with him.  She told me she was attracted to him however it was a mistake.  We talked it over, agreed how it was a very sensitive issue for me, and we left it in the past where it belonged with no judging involved.  Months passed by, with her and I having since left that workplace.  She has a myspace account that she freely shows me on "my" computer pretty regularly and I do not have a myspace account.  Recently another ex-coworker messaged her on myspace to say what's up and that the guy she had a fling with got a "New" haircut.  My GF downplayed it and life went on.  I went on a family mini-vacation for two days without my GF.  When I got home, I texted her that I was back and logged onto my PC to check some emails and such.  I did not get a response text right away and checked out her Myspace page to see what she was doing.  I cannot login to it, just looked at her general page.  Right on her front page, I find out that she looked up this guy(fling) and complimented him on his haircut and he responded back to her "excited" trying to strike up a conversation.  I was mad and immediately confronted her about it.  I asked her how she could do something like that when she knew it bothered me.  I said by her messaging him, she crossed a serious line that I laid out before.  She said she did not know why she messaged him and that it was very stupid of her.  The fact that she lied about being with him in the first place then admitting that she did, along with this, has made me lose most of my trust in her.   This is not the first time she has admitted to flings that she denied at first.  We have been together about 1 year.  Did I behave wrongly and what would you have done?

20090227110724AATvt5X	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Why do I feel this way about a boy I don't even like?!?	I have a certain boy in my life that once told me he liked me. At that time, I saw him as a really nice person and a friend, not someone I was romantically interested in. When he told me, I didn't know what to do and panicked. I haven't been able to talk to him properly since.    Now, he has a girlfriend. I though I would be relieved but everytime I see him and his girlfriend together, I get unexplainably bothered inside. I always want to compete with his girlfriend in everything, and I don't like this boy, at least I don't think so. I'm not even sure anymore.    Before, even after he told me he liked me, he still tried to talk to me alot. Now he avoids me like the plague. What to I do and why do I feel this way?! T_T
20090227111250AAQs5Ty	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Should I break up with him? 10 pts easily. Thanks?	I'm 16 and my boyfriend is 17. (he's also my first boyfriend) We've been dating for about 4 months - almost 5 and I feel a little smothered by him. He's already talking about how he wants to marry me and he loves me, etc. He's really sweet and I love him too - but things are going so so so fast with him.   And...he's not allowed to date - which complicates things because we rarely get to see each other and when we do, it is behind his parents backs. Also, my mom works and he was wanting to sneak over while she was gone (i'm not allowed to have guys in the house when she isn't home) and I am not comfortable with sneaking behind her back - so I told him no..but he's pushing it. Also, he doesnt ever pay for our "dates" because he doesn't work.   Is it time to break -up? All of a sudden things just seem complicated with him, but I do still have feelings for him - but at the same time...i think i just like him as a friend. Even when we kiss, i dont feel that 'spark' - I kind of just wait for the kiss to be over. Does that mean anything?      Thanks! (10 pts easily for you help!)      oh and he leaves for the airforce academy next year - which will mean i really wont get to see him afterwards.

20090227112428AAFSQJK	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	IS HE PLAYING MIND GAMES OR DOES HE HAVE A REAL REASON?	So..      I have been dating this guy for like 8 to 9 months and I'm 22, He's 31. He's definitely more experienced than I am but I am not dumb either.      I really let my guard down when he said I love you, (remember he said it first.) I love him too but I know his player type.       He basically broke up with me 2 weeks ago and since then I have been trying to keep my distance because I don't want to get caught up. He calls me and continues to profess his love for me. Its ridiculous. He even told me that he is sure that I will ALWAYS want him.      He invited me to see him sing (he's sings) and I said yes. Only with the intent of standing him up. I wanted to prove a point. Needless to say, he called me and CUSSED me out. and made me feel really bad and guilty.       I apologized like a million times but I have a hunch that even though he is disturbed by get stood up, he's not as mad as he lets up. I think this is a mind game?       Am I right? Or was I wrong for what I did?    IF it is a mind game, what would be his point?

20090225100300AA6xemX	Family & Relationships;Weddings	Covering tattoos for wedding day?	I have several tattoos, but most of them are in places that will be covered by my dress, other than two of them. One is on my foot and I think it will look fine with my wedding dress. But the other is on my forearm just below my inner elbow and it isn't very good, so I don't really want it showing with my dress. I like my tattoos and wouldn't normally care about them showing with my dress, it's just that the one on my arm is not very good quality and needs fixed or removed, but I don't have the money to do it right now.      Does anyone know of a way to cover a tat with makeup or even a special type of makeup that can be used? Has anyone else done this? Thanks!

20090225100950AAZkf9W	Family & Relationships;Family	Should i get my tubes tied?	I've been with my partner for 12 years and we have a little boy who is 5.   we had our son when we were both 23.   we are both 28 now and i have been wanting another child for a long time.   I have asked my partner about this over and over again be he just said that the time's not right...   I feel that time's running out for me and i don't think it's fair on my son to have a sibling who is many years younger.   it's also unfair for him to be an only child!..   I'm starting to give up hope of having another child now and don't think this will ever happen.   I have given up asking my partner about this as i have now realized that i will only ever have one child.   I'm thinking about having my tubes tied as it's pointless being fertile if i can't have children.   Even if i separated with my partner there is no way that i'd have another man's child?   Can anyone help, i don't know what to do?   Thank's

It is a plated dinner:      Appetizers:   Domestic and Imported Cheeses, Grapes, and Crackers   Assortment of freshly baked bread   Field Greens tossed in Raspberry Vinaigrette, topped with Candied Walnuts and Gorgonzola Cheese      Entrees:   Filet Mignon accompanied by Chicken Chardonnay, -or-   Portobello Penne Rigate (Vegetarian)      Side-dishes   Oven Roasted Red Potatoes with Rosemary   Green Bean Almandine      Dessert   White & Milk Chocolate Mousse, served in a martini-glass   Wedding Cake
20090225100945AAJwR12	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	He wants time with his friends. what does that mean?	me and my bf have been together for 20 months now. hes a type of guy who has sacrificed nearly everythng for me. before i met him he was always with his mates going out and having a laugh, but once he got with me i noticed he doesnt spend as much time with them anymore. i asked him why he doesnt, and he told me that he just wants to be with me as i am his priority and would rather do things with me than them. till this day, 1 yr and half later, he says that. he has also cancelled many of his other plans for me, even though i have at times told him not to. i found it really really sweet. even though a part of me did feel guilty as he should spend time with them too. he told me not to feel guilty though and that its his decision and he has chosen me.      recently, he said to me that he would like to spend some time with his freinds as well, all of a sudden. i found it a bit weird and got quite hurt. he said its just because hes still young and doesnt want to regret this time that he has at 19 years of age.      what does that mean? does that mean he regrets spending time with me, or that he just wants to have some more 'boy' time at this age before geting older? i am so confused :( i know he wouldnt ever regret spending time with me but im still geting worried. i hope it doesnt mean that he is drfiting away slowly :( but then he still says he loves me dearly.      please help me, im not sure what to do or think. thank you to anyone who replies x

20090225101130AAc6ZFF	Family & Relationships;Other - Family & Relationships	Gf wants to slow things down; needs space. Is it over? what exactly does this mean?	At first I thought she was breaking up with me, and I was about to end it myself. But I thought: why would she say she wanted to take it slow if she intended on ending it? Why would you want to take something slow if you really want it to come to a complete halt? I thought about sending flowers, but I'm afraid to do anything right now. What should I do?

We have been in a relationship for 5 years and we got into a huge argument and he came back after and within two weeks after the argument he was gone. We are both to strong minded people and well we always fight for head of house since we have been together. My real problem is that all of a sudden his ex girlfriend that did him so dirty 6 years ago begins to call him and all of a sudden he falls out of love with me and our problems tho just arguing are un manageable. I had 2 kids from a previous marriage and he has been there step daddy for 5 years they are devastated he is gone. He keeps telling me the ex and Him are just friends and that he needs time to think about the relationship but as of now he is done. When we do see each other sometimes hes really attentive to me like my nails are pretty or he tries to peek at my body asks me how i am and flirt and then there are times where hes really cold and just has to leave fast. I just need some good advice about what to do. The only thing he took from the house has been his clothes. i did try and go out on a date and he had a fit and told everyone i was out on a date. I cant read men i need help!!!! I do want him home.... it has been two weeks tomorrow....

20090225092429AAz012u	Family & Relationships;Family	I just wanted to know if you were in this type of situation what would you do?	I'm a 29 year old married mother of 3 and my mom has been living with us for over a year.My 54 year old mom is legally married to some loser but they don't live together.She refuses to divorce him.She is on welfare all she gets is $100 cash aid and $169 in food stamps.She's trying to get on SSI she even has a lawyer.She is trying to get SSI because she has health problems.She wont call him or anything either.I don't know what to do.I've been trying to be nice about her situation but she takes full advantage of me.She thinks she knows my husband and kids better then I do and she acts like she always knows whats going on.I just wanted to know if you were in this type of situation what would you do?
20090225093436AAYTtKm	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	I'm a childless Stepmom figure needing advice?	1st off...me and my boyfriend are not married yet (so yes, I know I'm not technically Step mom yet). Okay, so setting the scene...My boyfriends son is 4 years old. I've been around since he was 2 years old. Custody arrangement is 50/50. The 3 of us live together, and I stay at home with the little guy and his 2 cousins during the week.       My question/problem is...I'm struggling with my boundaries on correcting/parenting/punishing him. Me and my boyfriends childhoods were very similar. We were raised with both of our parents married, with strict rules to respect elders, mind your manners...whatnot. My boyfriends ex wife was raised in a poor environment of drugs, no father present...etc. Her sense of authority is not present with her son, and she lets him rule the roost, pitch fits, get his way. It's horrible to watch! And simply not a behavior that is acceptable at our house. Obviously when he's under just my care I am responsible for watching his behavior. But when its me, Dad and him what are my boundaries? Dad prefers that I step in and correct just as a mother would, to make us functional as a unit and to include me. Is that the correct way to handle it? Or should I step back and let Dad handle the parenting?      2nd question- Because the acceptable behaviors at his moms and dads house are such extreme opposite, how do we encourage the more respectful/personable behavior and shun the reckless behavior without pointing the finger at his moms parenting style, or lack there of.      *Just for the record, to all you biological mothers out there...I am very cautious that whenever me and mom are in the same place with her son, that she does the correcting and motherly comforting...whatnot. I'm not by any means trying to step on toes, just trying to find my place. Any advice would help.
20090225094107AAjuqIj	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	I flirted a chick just by just looking her and she said "interprete my silence". What does that mean?	It's a chick I recently met and just started to be friend for a week before I looked at her in a flirty way. She seemed to be kind in her response. So I don't know if it means "I'm not that into you " or "what else? keep going" because maybe she is just shy.   Maybe it means something else?

20090225100708AAQpHDJ	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	How do I cope with a unsuspected family divorce?	I’m fifteen and my parents just told me they are separating.  This came out of nowhere and I had always truly believed they were happy and this would never happen.  I also have an eight year-old brother who doesn’t know yet.  They want to split living arrangements school-year with mom and summer with dad but I don’t think me or my brother can handle that.  How are we supposed to cope with this?  We’re shy kids and I don’t want to do any counseling or whatever.  I just can’t stand that this is actually happening.
