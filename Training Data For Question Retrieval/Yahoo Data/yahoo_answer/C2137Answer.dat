Answers (And E-mail) Account   *<br>  <br>  Hi<br>  <br>  I only know of one way. Get your account suspended. Suspending means your away from a period of time, but on Y!A you are deleted, forever. Say mean things, inappropriate things, chat, breaking anything and everything in the Terms of Service and Community Guide Lines, and you will be removed, and no one will be able to access your account because it does not exist.<br>  <br>  Now, to erase your E-MAIL ADDRESS, do not sign in or log in for three or four weeks. After this period of time, Yahoo! thinks you have abandoned it and you are not using it, so they are going to clear their database and erase it, so you can't log in, no body can e-mail you, chat with you, and everything that is associated with your account will not be recieved.<br>  <br>  But if you don't allow anyone to add you as a Contact and make your Q&A Private to the Public, then no one can see anything in your profile, other than your information (which is located under your avatar in your profile) and how many Best Answers and how many Others you have on the side bar on the right side of the screen.<br>  <br>  You can make your Q&A Private and edit it so no one can add you as a Contact is to edit your information. You can make your Q&A Private by:<br>  <br>  My Profile > Edit My Info > Yahoo! Answers Network > On my public profile, hide my Q&A from people who are not my Contacts (check this) > On my public profile, only show my Answers Network to my Contacts (also check this > Preview > OK<br>  <br>  To allow no one to add you as a Contact, do this:<br>  <br>  My Profile > Edit My Info > Yahoo! Answers Network > Allow other Answers users to be my fan. ( do NOT check this) > Preview > OK<br>  <br>  To delete your avatar:<br>  <br>  My Profile > Edit My Information > Picture > No Picture (it's a gray head) > Preview > OK<br>  <br>  To delete all of your Fans/Contacts:<br>  <br>  My Profile > My Network > Remove<br>  <br>  To change your name:<br>  <br>  My Profile > Edit My Info > Nickname > Choose what you want > Preview > OK<br>  <br>  All of these steps above ( ^ ) will help you erase everything, your account, all of your information, your e-mail, basically everything that exists with your Yahoo! Account. But I gave you ways so you don't have to go all out and delete your e-mail, that's your choice

The bubbles read, "Choose as Best Answer," and they appear under each answer.

Then, you scroll down a little and click SUBMIT. The answerer will receive ten points, and you will receive three.<br>  <br>  To put your question to vote, you can either wait for the time to expire and then vote for the best answer, or you can go to the pencil beneath your question. If you click on the pencil, three or four tabs (depending on whether you extended the expiration date or not) will pop down, and one of them will read "PUT THIS QUESTION TO VOTE."

In one question you asked, you limited the pool of people who could answer you to those who live in Manchester, and that is not the Manchester I know which is 16 miles south of where I live in Washington State. Your other question is about an older, obscure game, which again, limits the pool of people who could answer your question. It isn't that people are ignoring you, you are severely limiting the number of people who can answer to a very small number. Your impatience is showing. This is not a forum which provides instant gratification. And the people who DO know the answers may not even have seen your question yet, or may not even use this forum at all.<br>  <br>  And in answer to your sound question, in general, DOS games played in a command window under windows can not access the hardware because Windoze versions newer than 95 prevents direct access to the hardware, which means no sound. Some older DOS games refuse to play because they try to access the video hardware directly. The only to play these games is to do a clean boot up in DOS real mode and not get into windoze at all.

The thing that gets me is, how a man/boy actually thinks a woman is tantalized by such garbage.  <br>  <br>  If there was a girl/woman who is "turned on" by such crap, would a guy really want to be with such a kook? ; )|`|44vgFcKcaa	First rule of E-mail safety: <br>  Do not open E-mail from anyone you do not know.<br>  Spam is everywhere now, you can only attempt to control it. Never open them, that only makes them send you more and more.<br>  Check mark them and click on 'Spam,' this stops those from being delivered to your mail.<br>  Use the spam filter and block addresses, too.<br>  Look for the 'Options' link at upper right corner of mail screen and click on it.<br>  Options /mail options / blocked addresses<br>  Enter the E-mail address you wish blocked and click on 'add block'<br>  you will never get mail from that address again.<br>  Then, finally, never ever give your personal info out to anyone.|`|St0VAKlDaa	Well, here lately i have gotten some kind of advertisement that talks about vulgar things & i don't know where they are coming from.

WY7NKvA0aa	There isn't really an e-mail which you can use to contact them. You have to use this form on their website:<br>  <a href="http://www.aim.com/help_faq/report_form.adp" rel="nofollow">http://www.aim.com/help_faq/report_form....</a><br>  <br>  Also, before doing that I would try uninstalling and reinstalling AIM. You can uninstall by going to Control Panel from the Start Menu, clicking "Uninstall a Program" in the Programs group, going to where it lists AIM, probably at the beginning, right-clicking and clicking uninstall, then OK.<br>  Then download AIM from this site:<br>  <a href="http://download.aim.com/client/68" rel="nofollow">http://download.aim.com/client/68</a><br>  Click download, then run, then go through all the installation. Launch AIM again to see if anything's changed.<br>  If you still experience the problem, try going to the message boards on AIM's website:<br>  <a href="http://messageboards.aol.com/aol/en_us/articles.php?boardId=565563&func=3&channel=AIM+Message+Boards" rel="nofollow">http://messageboards.aol.com/aol/en_us/a...</a><br>  <br>  If neither of those two work, try using the form I mentioned above.

GkzOurZmaa	The average hourly wage for an American worker is approximately $16.65 which would give you an average weekly rate of $665.60 -- (As of April, 2007)<br>  <br>  Another reason that people might complain more is because we, humans are materialistic and we want more expensive, better things.|`|6GaQuMbWaa	From what the little I know maybe 200-300 a wk.|`|GWQcD8BHaa	I AM 18 In washington makin 800 a week after taxes i live to work though|`|f3f63c87e27f64c3e9f1679c165409b8aa	Average would be around $750 a week (gross, and then pay taxes and stuff out of that)<br>  <br>  Wages are pretty good in America, it's just that we complain a lot and do dumb things.  We'll go out and buy a $35000 vechicle just because we want to keep up with what the neighbors are doing/buying, but then we'll complain about $3.00 a gallon gas.|`|ZzKGxoYqaa	Well it depends on what state you live in, Massachusetts everything is really expensive and then they add  taxes on top of that and most jobs around here pay really low and min wage I believe is $7.25 an hour and you maybe get $4.00 of that after taxes are taken out and the average price of a gallon of milk is 3.98 and gas is $2.05 in my neighbor hood and if you want an apartment good luck affording it because for a two bedroom it is about $1000 a month. So if your area is harder  than this i wont be moving to Australia anytime soon but i am leaving massachusetts soon.  Other states may differ.
g1scTbOzaa	The internet seems to be a breeding ground for those "tough guy"/"tough girl" types who use the anonymity as a way of bullying others.  It's sad that those who find it amusing to hurt others actually believe they are "tough" or "clever".  Yes, these types of people are in the real world as well, just not as abundant as behind the facade of a computer monitor.  :)|`|lYE34CVTaa	Yes there are rude people on Y Answers but like the first person said, rude people are everywhere. Posting a question on here is going to attract many people which means lots of different opinions. Some good, helpful, funny or nice... others rude, hateful, ignorant, or stupid. You have to be prepared to accept all types of criticism.|`|YuUNESK5aa	yes.|`|MbjJzs7Caa	Sometimes people are.|`|a1566efb5533aa90596e330bc315a547aa	I think it's something you get used to.

Our 'reliability' status is a secret, so we don't get told that we have 'lost influence' in the future -- it just happens. And, it can be regained with valid reporting.|`|gU34xa9vaa	Is the question deleted again now Amanda ? You'd think these people would  have better things to do that sit waiting to try to cause trouble.<br>  I can't see where any of your questions have violated anything ? <br>  I reported one today from someone about putting a cat in a microwave and it went straight away, but I don't know how many others had already reported it before me.|`|eb4a10b7d0c7b16ef422f23a98ba67beaa	It is said that normally it takes more than one person reporting a question to have it removed but a trusted reporter could have a question removed by just reporting it.<br>  Happily, you won your appeal and had the question reinstated and now the reporter or reporters will suffer the laughingly, meaningless penalty of having their reporting influence reduced. <br>  <br>  Yahoo doesn't notify them that the report was unjustified and their reporting influence has been reduced. Which, in my opinion, is a pity, doing so might reduce the number of frivolous reports on the site.

7u77AiBjaa	Double-check that you are using the correct Yahoo services and have followed all the instructions below. Some people confuse the Y!Profile (<a href="http://profile.yahoo.com">http://profile.yahoo.com</a> ) with Yahoo! 360 (<a href="http://360.yahoo.com">http://360.yahoo.com</a> ). If you've done everything, then likely you just have to wait for a change to be recognized:<br>  <br>  <br>  Create a 360 space at <a href="http://360.yahoo.com">http://360.yahoo.com</a> . Click "Get Started" button on the far right section of that page. After going through the activation process, you can click on the teeny tiny "Yahoo 360 Home" link on the upper right of that page (or the 360 main page) to get into the 360 space.<br>  <br>  Make sure a JPEG formatted photo (with .jpg, .jpeg, .jpe extension) under 5MB is saved to your hard drive.<br>  <br>  - Click your "My Page" link at the top<br>  - Click "Edit Profile/Personal Photos" over the empty picture frame<br>  - Click "Browse" and upload photo into an empty field. Then click one "use as primary" radio button on the right before saving (if you've uploaded more than one image).<br>  <br>  You can't upload more than 4 profile pictures (this includes an avatar). Make sure that you are following the 360 Personal Photo guidelines here: <a href="http://help.yahoo.com/l/us/yahoo/360/guidelines/guidelines-06.html">http://help.yahoo.com/l/us/yahoo/360/gui...</a> .<br>  <br>  Then, come back to Yahoo! Answers.<br>  - Make sure that it is the same Yahoo ID that you used for 360.<br>  - Click the "My Profile" link to the upper right of this Yahoo! Answers page, then click "Edit My Info" in the top left box on the Answers profile page.<br>  - Scroll down to the image section and check the option of showing the 360 picture. Click Preview and then the OK button. Then, WAIT.<br>  <br>  NOTE: The image may not show up right away in Y/A, as it sometimes take hours, days, or weeks for the system to catch up. So, in the meantime, you will be without any picture on Y/A (a gray unisex icon) or an old 360 image. Just go through the above process and let your picture stay that way until the system makes your 360 image appear. If you don't want to wait, then just use a Yahoo! Avatar (<a href="http://avatars.yahoo.com">http://avatars.yahoo.com</a> ) and forget about using the 360 image.<br>  <br>  OTHER TIPS: <br>  *** If the 360 space is recently activated, you may want to wait a few days before changing settings, as Y/A may not recognize that you have a 360 space right away.<br>  *** You may want to enable all the communication options on your Y/A profile and/or enable the Simple URL option in your Yahoo! 360 "Basic Info" and "Blog" settings pages. Sometimes that helps make the Y!360 image appear in your Y/A profile for an unknown reason. You still may have to wait for anything to happen though. <br>  *** Although, some people have found limited success in continually trying to re-select the 360 image option in their Y/A profile. I recommend waiting though, as to not inadvertently cause further delay.<br>  *** Some people never see an image show up. You can always post a bug report (or piggyback on other's bug reports) on the issue at the Y/A forum: <a href="http://suggestions.yahoo.com/?prop=answers">http://suggestions.yahoo.com/?prop=answe...</a> . This link between Y/A and Y!360 has been buggy for years.

FlNPMa4Yaa	Ok. This was the worst thing that ever happened to me and probably anyone ever.  I know it sounds fake but it really isn't. <br>  <br>   About 2 years ago I had a job at a small restaurant. I was working there when they were having a bikini fashion show (Don't ask. Not my idea.) Some person thought I was one of the models. I got locked in a changing room by this guy with a white bikini. This guy just thinks I am being difficult by not changing. So what choice did I have?  <br>  <br>  I put on the bikini.  At this time I was having my period.  I did not have a tampon with me.  So I find out that my boyfriend came to the show. I went out and started walking down the runway.  <br>  <br>  Then, I hear a dripping noise.  Yes, it was me, bleeding.  While wearing a white swimsuit.  What a wonderful day.|`|6qsTmMQaaa	My pants fell down when I was standing in front of my entire class.|`|Lth8UVJfaa	okayy well I have this really hot neighbor who is like really athletic and like 17 years old....anyways one day it was hot outside so I figured I would go outside and do my homework on the porch and get my tan at the same time...so as I was doing my homework I saw my neighbor and his cousin come outside and playing catch with a football...so I was trying to look cute and biting on my pen when it exploded in my mouth --- yea I didn't realize it either until about a minute after it happened and I ran inside my house and started washing my mouth lol I decided to finish my homework inside my house lol|`|tGAt3ZKkaa	This is NOWHERE near my most embarrassing moment, its more like the most embarrassing moment for my friends boyfriend AND me.<br>  <br>  We were at the beach, pretty far out, her boyfriend was surfing and we were just floating around on a massive board her dad had made.<br>  And a massive wave came at us all and knocked her BF of his surfboard and us off the board. And while I was under the water my bikini bottoms came off and my friend BF did a face plant on my bare butt!!!<br>  <br>  OMG!! I tried to talk to him saying "uh, what a coincidence!, me, you . . . my butt!" and I paused "did I just say that?"<br>  <br>  every thing between the 3 of us was just quiet for at least 1 hour.<br>  <br>  lol<br>  <br>  AND<br>  <br>  We had 70's night at my school, and I wa sin year 7 and so I didn;t know whatw as going on and what we were going to have to do and so, I grabbed my arm and said "what the hell is going on I feel like an idiot" she was holding a microphone and so everyone heard it.<br>  I felt like an idiot.<br>  <br>  AND<br>  <br>  I was with my friend and her BF (yes the same BF that face planted into my butt) and we were at the movies, my crush came in and we went to sit up the top.<br>  As my crush sat down, my friends BF said to me "hey Jen stop" I turned out I was in such a dreamland of love (lol) was leaning over the next rail of seats.<br>  I sat up and (oh, i forgot to say that infront of us was a long wide rail down to the front of the room) and so when we got up, (the movie wasn't over, we just hated it) I tipped over my friends foot and landed on the wide rail and when my friend and her BF tried ot help me they accidently let go and I went sliding down the rail!<br>  I was screaming, really loud, saying things like "OMG help me!! aug!!"<br>  I hit the bottom and fell off the side and I got up to see everyone laughing their butts off.<br>  <br>  OMG and there are SO many more embarrassing moments of mine but it would take a book to list them all.|`|dn7xIDwHaa	well one day i was in the night club and there was this really hot guy and i walked passed him and you know how you get that really good eye contact well yea we had that and i kept walking and not looking where i was going and before you know it i ran right into the stage and ended up falling over every ones shoes, well he ran over to see if i was ok - I was so shocked that i just told him ill call him after taking his number and never did and i never been back to that club since. and that was 3 years ago lol

I just saw this on a tech blog about trying to find an e-mail address:<br>  4: Search user groups and newsgroupsJust about everyone who’s online takes advantage of a newsgroup or user group. Sometimes, you can find a message, including a person’s e-mail address, using an Internet search engine, such as groups.google.com. If the person has posted on any UseNet group, Google will return a link to the post, which might lead to a full e-mail address. (UseNet is a network of worldwide Internet discussion systems, or user groups and forums.)|`|FF94QuKxaa	First of all, I hope you know that something is obviously going on so get ready.

Maybe an aol bill.

Most you even have to stay over night.<br>  <br>  Read all about it....<br>  <br>  Planning For Surgery<br>  <br>  Most surgeons recommend that parents stay alert to their child's feelings about protruding ears; don't insist on the surgery until your child wants the change. Children who feel uncomfortable about their ears and want the surgery are generally more cooperative during the process and happier with the outcome.<br>  <br>  In the initial meeting, your surgeon will evaluate your child's condition, or yours if you are considering surgery for yourself, and recommend the most effective technique. He or she will also give you specific instructions on how to prepare for surgery.

The best websites to store your photos in and post the links are Flickr, Photobucket and Tiny Pic, but if there is another website that you can use, feel free to use it. Then, all you need to do is copy and paste the link to the picture into your question/answer. However, due to a 999 Error, you might have to post the link after you've already posting the question/answer by editing into your response, or adding it as additional detail.|`|53FA3PSNaa	You are talking about a picture from a web page I guess.

I suspect you may have violated some guidelines. Here are some possibilities:<br>  <br>  <br>  Some people can only upload 1 or no pics, so consider yourself fortunate. You may still find people with 4 pics in the module though. Make sure that the image that you are using is a JPEG-formatted photo (with .jpg, .jpeg, .jpe extension) under 5MB that's saved to your hard drive.<br>  <br>  If you happen to have a red x in a spot, you can delete a remaining picture to possible get rid of that empty placeholder. But really, I recommend that you leave the module completely alone because it can cause other serious problems on your page like it making your Top Page very long - which may or may not be fixable. You can also lose more spots in the module. This has been a buggy module for a long time. Some people recommend that you keep trying to add the image and/or wait for the image to miraculously appear (which may work), but I'm warning you that messing with the module too much is a risky method.<br>  <br>  Also, please note the 360 community guidelines (<a href="http://help.yahoo.com/l/us/yahoo/360/guidelines/guidelines-08.html">http://help.yahoo.com/l/us/yahoo/360/gui...</a> ) regarding mature content. The personal profile area is a public area, which can't be changed from that status. Adult images must be placed ONLY in the blog under mature content controls. IF you have been reported for adult images in that module or in the 360 background, then Yahoo could have removed those images. This inadvertently could have resulted in those spots being lost as well.<br>  <br>  <br>  NOTE: The Y!360 team is no longer addressing bug reports, as it prepares to migrate parts of 360 to a universal profile system (UPS). This transition was announced in October 2007 and the UPS actually started in a rudimentary beta form on October 16, 2008. The Y!360 part of the system hasn't been transferred over fully yet. <br>  - See blogs at <a href="http://blog.360.yahoo.com/product_360">http://blog.360.yahoo.com/product_360</a> and <a href="http://www.yprofileblog.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.yprofileblog.com</a> for more details. The 360 team blog is also accessible via the "Yahoo! 360 News" link in the upper right corner of your 360 space. You can post complaints on the Yahoo! 360 blog, but don't expect a personal response. <br>  - See <a href="http://blog.360.yahoo.com/blog-4D4zxsg6fLRvC60pERfR7.8c?p=858">http://blog.360.yahoo.com/blog-4D4zxsg6f...</a> for more information on 360 glitches. <br>  - See the links in these blog entries for more details on Yahoo's overall direction and UPS: <a href="http://blog.360.yahoo.com/blog-4D4zxsg6fLRvC60pERfR7.8c?p=1414">http://blog.360.yahoo.com/blog-4D4zxsg6f...</a> , <a href="http://blog.360.yahoo.com/blog-4D4zxsg6fLRvC60pERfR7.8c?p=1168">http://blog.360.yahoo.com/blog-4D4zxsg6f...</a> , and <a href="http://blog.360.yahoo.com/blog-4D4zxsg6fLRvC60pERfR7.8c?p=1236">http://blog.360.yahoo.com/blog-4D4zxsg6f...</a> .

DO NOT us an image that's tiny/avatar sized to start with. You must use 'normal' size image files.) Then you need to put the image you'd like to use as your avatar on your 360 page. You may already have one. If you do, you would be able to access it from your profile. Just click on your avatar (or "My Profile" on the upper right). The 360 option will be on the upper right.

Click on "My Page" that's near the top. You'll see your photos (or where they would be if you don't already have photos there) and the option to "Edit Personal Photos". Click on that, then you will see where you can add photos. Click on "Choose File" to find the image on your computer. Once you add the image, click on "Save". That'll bring you back to the group of images. If you want to set the new image as primary to use here, click on "Edit Personal Photos" again.

Then click on "preview" and "OK".<br>  <br>  Keep in mind that sometimes, after following all the steps, the 360 image can appear right away, or can take 2-3 days... but it will eventually appear.

7j9MfenOaa	The permanently offline feature only works if they stay on your list.  As soon as you deleted them, you removed the permanently offline status.  <br>  <br>  You can't block them...but you can ignore them.  Messenger 8.0 and 8.1 have the ignore button in the IM box.  What you do, if they send you a message is that you look in the right hand corner (this is where the ignore button will be if they are not on your list anymore) and click it.  It's a red circle with a line through it.  You can also go to actions in that window, and at the top of the drop down menu is "contact options" with an arrow.  Mouse over that and see if the "ignore user" option is lit up.  <br>  <br>  The only downside is, if you're like me, you tend to have a lot of people on ignore because of their constantly bugging you.  I always end up having to empty my ignore list and then get stuck putting them back on ignore when they IM me again.|`|BuR6Wwknaa	one way to avoid it is that before deleting the contact you should block them.there is an option to block the contact when you click right.|`|13KBWzBXaa	There's a setting somewhere in Yahoo that hides you when you're online.<br>  <br>  Also, if you remove the person from your allowed IM list and they IM you, *then* you can block them.

7u77AiBjaa	Nope, it has nothing to do with Launchcast or Yahoo! Messenger. If you want to find out how those features relate to Yahoo! 360, see these links:<br>  <a href="http://help.yahoo.com/l/us/yahoo/360/profile/profile-11.html">http://help.yahoo.com/l/us/yahoo/360/pro...</a> and <a href="http://help.yahoo.com/l/us/yahoo/360/homepage/homepage-04.html">http://help.yahoo.com/l/us/yahoo/360/hom...</a> .<br>  <br>  The 360 space owner has posted an online-hosted MP3 file in their blast, thus enabling a play button. See <a href="http://blog.360.yahoo.com/blog-4D4zxsg6fLRvC60pERfR7.8c?p=916">http://blog.360.yahoo.com/blog-4D4zxsg6f...</a> and <a href="http://blog.360.yahoo.com/blog-4D4zxsg6fLRvC60pERfR7.8c?p=548">http://blog.360.yahoo.com/blog-4D4zxsg6f...</a> for details on how to put music in your blast. You can use music that you upload to the web or music already uploaded to the web by other people (the faster, easier method).<br>  <br>  The song file must be an MP3 file and the web address for that file must end in .mp3. Also, only certain services (music hosting sites, file hosting sites, or blogging services) will allow you to create or use a hotlink to an audio file. So, if you use a search engine to find links, you should definitely check to see if it's working on your page after saving your blast.

Here are a few areas to consider:<br>  Have you noticed anything unusual that might suggest to you that someone else is using your account? If so, change your password on the Account Info page. You’ll be asked to sign in before proceeding. <br>  In the first section of the page, click Change Password and follow the instructions. <br>  Did you send or receive many attachments in a short period of time? If so, try deleting some of the emails you sent or received in a short period of time in your Inbox or Sent folder. <br>  Clear your browser’s cache and cookies. <br>  During the suspension, you have access to all email in your Inbox, personal folders and Sent folder, and to your Mail Options. You will not be able to send or receive mail or save any drafts. Email sent to your account will bounce back to the sender.

Different things seem to work for different people. It's causing attachments to not show, 999 errors where it won't let you do a particular action and some people cannot send receive delete or move mail. It's not just Vista either it's happening to some of us on XP. If all else fails go back to classic mail  Hope this helps.

Rating = giving Thumbs Up & Down to express your opinion of other peoples' answers. No points are involved (unless a best answer has TUs, then they get 1 point for each TU up to 50) in rating, and thumbs do not determine the Best Answer selection.<br>  <br>  Hints: <br>  <br>  answer your limit of questions each day (2 points each)<br>  get an answer selected as best answer (10 points each)<br>  pick a best answer for your question (3 points)<br>  vote your limit of unresolved questions each day (1 point each)<br>  you also get a point a day for signing in<br>  <br>  each question costs 5 points, so ask sparingly<br>  <br>  :o)<br>  <br>  <a href="http://answers.yahoo.com/info/scoring_system">http://answers.yahoo.com/info/scoring_sy...</a>|`|gGZz2EGyaa	Getting to the next level on Answers just enables you to answer and ask more questions, also vote on more undecided questions.

iH2whFkHaa	You have to go to 'edit my profile' on your Y!A profile and select 'use my yahoo 360 whatever' . Then give it at least 24 hours to show up. Usually it takes a while.|`|6qsTmMQaaa	As far as I know, there is a glitch in the 360 system, so the profile pictures, for some reason don't work on Yahoo! Answers. Apparently, though, the team is trying to fix it, so it should be working soon. The best thing to do is just wait it out. Good luck.|`|ehBPus3Zaa	Click on your profile on Y/A, then pick the "edit my info" then click on"use my y/a avatar" then right under that click on "edit my avatar"
7u77AiBjaa	Click "My Profile" to the upper right of this Yahoo! Answers page, then click "Edit My Info" in the top left box on the Answers profile page. Scroll down to the Privacy section and check the option of showing the link to your 360 page. Click Preview button and then the Ok button.<br>  <br>  If it doesn't work (it has been a buggy feature) or the option is missing, put a full link in your "About Me" section.<br>  - Click "My Page" at the top of your 360 space<br>  - Click the drop down menu "Preview as seen by" at the top right of your 360 "My Page". <br>  - Choose PUBLIC as the permission group and click the "Go" button<br>  - Click the "Top Page" link above your personal profile picture section on the left side.<br>  - Select & copy the FULL web address that appears in your web browser's address bar (starting from the http:// part)<br>  - Click "My Profile" to the upper right of this Yahoo! Answers page, then click "Edit My Info" in the top left box on the Answers profile page.<br>  - Paste the address in your Y/A profile's "About Me" section. If you have a Simple URL setup, use that instead. Make sure A SPACE follows the address.<br>  <br>  The feature to display a 360 link is usually blocked to users who are under age 18. But it is also just a glitch for others.<br>  <br>  NOTE: The link would be viewable to everyone, not just those in your Y/A network.|`|lcj1AKt1aa	Go to settings on your page and click it.

1ac3781b361a0972a1980084331b52c5aa	To choose the best answer for your question, go to the page of your question 4 or 5 hours AT LEAST after it has been posted, you will find a big blue button / tab reading "Choose As Best Answer" under each answer like shown in this simple illustration (click please)▼<br>  <br>  <a href="http://i471.photobucket.com/albums/rr74/idixor/ll.jpg" rel="nofollow">http://i471.photobucket.com/albums/rr74/...</a><br>  <br>  Click the one under the answer you want to pick as the best one, rate it from 1 to 5, add a comment and click "OK".<br>  <br>  NOTE:<br>  ①If you did not choose the best answer for your question within 4 days after posting it, the question will EXPIRE (unless you EXTEND its EXPIRATION time to be 8 days) and will be put for voting by the community.<br>  ②By choosing a best answer for your question, you get 3 points back out of the 5 you already lost by asking the question and the user whose answer you chose as the best one gets 10 points plus 1 point for every thumbs-up his/her answer receives (up to 50 thumbs-up are counted).
7u77AiBjaa	Create a 360 space at <a href="http://360.yahoo.com">http://360.yahoo.com</a> . Click the "Get Started" button on the far right section of that page. After going through the activation process, you can click on the teeny tiny "Yahoo 360 Home" link on the upper right of that page (or the 360 main page) to get into the 360 space.<br>  <br>  Make sure a JPEG formatted photo (with .jpg, .jpeg, .jpe extension) under 5MB is saved to your hard drive.<br>  <br>  - Click your "My Page" link at the top<br>  - Click "Edit Profile/Personal Photos" over the empty picture frame<br>  - Click "Browse" and upload photo into an empty field. Then click one "use as primary" radio button on the right before saving (if you've uploaded more than one image).<br>  <br>  You can't upload more than 4 profile pictures (this includes an avatar). Make sure that you are following the 360 Personal Photo guidelines here: <a href="http://help.yahoo.com/l/us/yahoo/360/guidelines/guidelines-06.html">http://help.yahoo.com/l/us/yahoo/360/gui...</a> .<br>  <br>  Then, come back to Yahoo! Answers.<br>  - Make sure that it is the same Yahoo ID that you used for 360.<br>  - Click the "My Profile" link to the upper right of this Yahoo! Answers page, then click "Edit My Info" in the top left box on the Answers profile page.<br>  - Scroll down to the image section and check the option of showing the 360 picture. Click Preview and then the OK button. Then, WAIT.<br>  <br>  NOTE: The image may not show up right away in Y/A, as it sometimes takes minutes, hours, days, or weeks for the system to catch up. So, in the meantime, you will be without any picture on Y/A (a gray unisex icon) or an old 360 image. Just go through the above process and let your picture stay that way until the system makes your 360 image appear. If you don't want to wait, then just use a Yahoo! Avatar (<a href="http://avatars.yahoo.com">http://avatars.yahoo.com</a> ) and forget about using the 360 image.<br>  <br>  OTHER TIPS: <br>  *** If the 360 space is recently activated, you may want to wait a few days before changing settings, as Y/A may not recognize that you have a 360 space right away.<br>  *** You may want to enable all the communication options on your Y/A profile and/or enable the Simple URL option in your Yahoo! 360 "Basic Info" and "Blog" settings pages. Sometimes that helps make the Y!360 image appear in your Y/A profile for an unknown reason. You still may have to wait for anything to happen though. <br>  *** Although, some people have found limited success in continually trying to re-select the 360 image option in their Y/A profile. I recommend waiting though, as to not inadvertently cause further delay.<br>  *** Some people never see an image show up. You can always post a bug report (or piggyback on other's bug reports) on the issue at the Y/A forum: <a href="http://suggestions.yahoo.com/?prop=answers">http://suggestions.yahoo.com/?prop=answe...</a> . This link between Y/A and Y!360 has been buggy for years.|`|SurtsboYaa	take a picture, upload it onto the comp., make sure it is a jpeg or jip or j something file (if its not, go to media-convert.com, go from there) and go to your 360 account and use that pic

suPD7c3gaa	I actually have no idea what nick name your family has for you.  Did you possibly mean your Yahoo user name?  You don't write to Yahoo here.  Even if you did, they wouldn't give you any information without proof of who you are. You're using your Yahoo! account now or you, or you wouldn't have been able to ask this question. So you must have signed in.  It's the same user ID (nick name) on your computer at home.  It doesn't matter what computer you're using.  You could be using 10 different computers in 10 different locations, and your Yahoo! log on or user ID/nick name would still be the same.  It has nothing to do with where your computer is or what computer you are using.|`|eTuK9t85aa	Booger|`|8QFzCwBnaa	cool or fool. lol|`|TF5UPGP3aa	its nt me who gave you nickname when u wr born ........<br>  <br>  so how the hell we know it ...<br>  <br>  ask smthing meaningful.............
