AA11307940	Yahoo has been doing maintenance and updates on their sites lately, each area at a time. Today it is ok. Earlier in the week it didn't work for beans, keep freezing when I tried to change the page, That is how it started out, slow, then it came to a halt. It won't take long to be back.|`|UBxKqdPwaa	Yes, especially yesterday.  I would spend a lot of time writing the "perfect" answer and then it wouldn't allow me to post the answer. There were many other troubles as well.  I was beginning to think that someone there didn't want me around.
t2M1kXY4aa	I guess they assume Y!A answerers are all sooo smart that we'll know what they mean without having to tell us!|`|Fy9S6hjIaa	I think people are just looking for entertainment and are wanting to see what kind of answers they will get.  A bit immature, but easy to ignore at least :-)
S5DpU6yDaa	In addition to reasons from previous responses (to help, for points, bored), I like to answer questions I hadn't thought about before and now that I'd seen whatever the question is, I realize it's something I want to know about too. Sometimes I don't believe the other answers given or I want additional information, so I try to find the answer myself. Then if I find it, I post it to share what I found with others. This way I put the answer into writing (which I would probably not do if it wasn't for someone else), and it makes me write it better/ more clear and comprehensive. I usually pay more attention and retain the information better than if I had researched it only for myself. <br>  <br>  For example: <br>  'How old is human language?' -hadn't thought of it before and when I saw the question I was interested to find the answer for my own personal knowledge (I wasn't sure if the answers already there were correct), <br>  'What is the EAR of a loan?'- wanted to know answer for financial knowledge and may need to know later for a college class anyway.. since no one else answered I decided to find and post the answer myself.|`|AA12050428	Generally trying to be helpful particularly to kids looking for homework help etc.,|`|NEWbh3Plaa	It gives me something to do when I am bored.  I try to help other people.

u7vrul2Faa	After an interview I would ask these questions. <br>   <br>  1. When should I expect to hear from you again if I am successful getting this job? <br>   <br>  2. When and what time will I be expected to start work if I get the job?<br>   <br>  3. When, how and what method will my first wages be paid to me?<br>   <br>  4. Am I required to bring any documents etc to work on my first day?<br>   <br>  5. What kind of tasks or jobs will I be expected to do in the first few days of me working here.<br>   <br>  6. Can I contact you if I have any other concerns or queries?<br>   <br>  So I would say ask a minimum of 2 questions and no more than 6 questions at a time.|`|oDz0FQpEaa	I tend not to ask any unless something has come up in the interview that I was unsure of. Sometimes asking too many questions just for the sake of asking questions may come across like you haven't done enough research.<br>  Sorry for not giving a direct answer but I hope this helps!|`|7i6qj4OXaa	There is no fixed number.  I have interviewed staff and been interviewed myself many times.  Read your job description and person specification and write down the things you aren't clear about.  Turn them into sensible questions and take the list with you to the interview.  A good question to ask is always what future training will be provided?  At the end of the interview when you are invited to ask questions, get your list out and look at it.  They will be impressed by this, I can assure you.  If all of your questions have been answered during the interview, say to them, I believe all of the questions I had have already been covered and thank them for the interview.

colhXvWDaa	You have to be on level 2 or up to rate. Once you are you should see a hand giving a thumbs up and giving a thumbs down under all the answers. Click it and you will have given a person a thumbs up or thumbs down. If someone gives you a thumbs up you get 1 point. If you give someone a thumbs down it will hide it from you so you won't see the answer. If a person gets 5 or more thumbs down, it will be hidden from all users.

Then go to Y!A and set up a new Y!A avatar, etc., just as you did with the previous account.<br>  <br>  Yahoo allows us to have more than one account ... as many as we want, actually.  What is NOT allowed is using one Y!A account to influence another of your own accounts ... asking with one, answering with another, or voting one account's answer as Best Answer with the other account ... those are examples of point-gaming.|`|a2708e7f671d2c5308a7fca7225d05d4aa	if you lose an appeal <br>  saying your previous account has been suspended<br>  and will not be re-instated<br>  this is when another account is created.<br>  and starting from level 1<br>  if another account is created it is bound by terms of service and community guidelines, yahoo answers will be suggesting the person <br>  to read them.

Most stores will not sell you tobacco products without a valid ID, if you don't appear to be a certain age(usually between 27-35). Some retailers will take a chance and let it slide. Regardless of what they choose to do, the worst thing they can do to you is say "sorry, I can't sell you these without an ID".

We all know that.|`|zDQIPFH2aa	Update:<br>  <br>  If you told this as a joke, with nothing else, that is a violation for using the wrong format for jokes.  You can't just tell a joke, you must ask a question about the joke.  Read that section in the guidelines.<br>  <br>  "mary fell in the mud" is not a question, so yes it is a violation of the rules.  If there was more, you need to provide the complete context for use to comment.|`|1thzSbS8aa	"Mary fell in the mud?" is a statement, not a question. <br>  <br>  If there was more to the question, such as "how can I get the stains out of her white T-shirt?", then it would be a knowledge-seeking question, and you should appeal the violation.

So some questions may not post for hours – or may get violated by staff. Delayed questions will be off the front page, so get very few answers.<br>  <br>  If you are posting questions with links in them, this can delay the question posting or even cause it to not post. To get around this, post the question without the link first, then return to the question and use the PENCIL under it to put the link in the ‘additional details’ section.|`|VWvI5RyBaa	Is it possible that they've been deleted before you had time to check?

7u77AiBjaa	Are you sure that you were totally logged out of Yahoo when you viewed that 360 space? Also, this question lacks links to anything, so I can't check what you're talking about. You can click on my avatar and send the URL to the 360 space privately through a message. You can't set a 360 profile to private - there are always areas that are publicly-viewable. Some areas like the blog can be blocked via permissions though (see <a href="http://help.yahoo.com/l/us/yahoo/360/permissions/">http://help.yahoo.com/l/us/yahoo/360/per...</a> for more information).<br>  <br>  1) Log out of this account. Clear your browser's cookies and cache. Before clearing cookies, make sure you know your passwords to sites.<br>  <br>  CACHE:<br>  In Internet Explorer, see <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/windows/ie/using/howto/customizing/clearcache.mspx" rel="nofollow">http://www.microsoft.com/windows/ie/usin...</a><br>  In Firefox, click the "Clear Cache Now" button under Tools > Options > Privacy > Cache.<br>  In Safari, under the Safari menu is an option to Empty Cache; select this.<br>  <br>  COOKIES:<br>  In Firefox, do this under Tools > Options > Privacy > Cookies > Clear Cookies Now<br>  In Internet Explorer, do this under Tools > Internet Options > General > Browsing History > Delete > Delete Cookies > Yes<br>  In Safari, select Preferences from the Safari menu and click Security. Click Show Cookies, then click the option to Remove cookies.<br>  <br>  Then, restart your computer.<br>  <br>  2) Log into the other Yahoo account. Go to <a href="http://360.yahoo.com">http://360.yahoo.com</a> . Click the sign in link on the top left. Then, click the "Yahoo! 360 Home" link at the top right of the page. Click "My Blog". Click "Edit Blog Settings". Check to make sure the "Who can view my blog" and "Who can comment on my blog" settings are set to "Friends". Make adjustments and click the "Save" button if it's not. The permissions setting is for the entire blog.<br>  <br>  3) Check how other people view your page by clicking on the drop down menu "Preview as seen by" at the top right of your 360 "My Page". Choose "Public" as a permission group and click the "Go" button. Click the "Top Page" link and copy the web address of your 360 space<br>  <br>  4) Sign out of your Yahoo account completely. Go to your 360 space with that link. See if you can view blogs. You shouldn't be able to do so. Clear your browser's cookies and cache again. Close the browser.<br>  <br>  5) Open the browser, do the same search for the 360 space and see if the same thing occurs. Although, there could have been a cache version of your 360 blog logged by a search engine before you made adjustments to your permissions (if it hasn't always been set to Friends).<br>  <br>  <br>  If nothing has changed, there really is nothing that can be done besides contacting the Search Engine about the issue, setting those blogs on "mature content" if you are over age 18, or deleting those blogs. Yahoo! stopped handling bugs related to 360 in October 2007, so contacting them about it would probably be a waste of time.

suPD7c3gaa	Nothing you can do.  There's no way to get  those messages back.  Remind your sis that dear friends haven't gone away.  A message is much like an object we think we need to keep because it reminds of of someone or is from someone.  When those things are lost, or gone for any reason, what's important to remember is the people they remind us of are in our lives, memories and in our hearts.  That NEVER goes away.  No one can take those things, or delete them... ever!  In reality, messages can't be stored on a phone forever anyway.  There is a limit to how much can be stored.  It might have been a blessing in disguise that they were deleted.  Saving things can get out of control.

e63450517215908d3a9a820dd7193140aa	How to fight spam and scams:<br>  <br>  #1: Yahoo has a spamguard filter, but only if multiple users report an address as spam will it be treated as such by the filter.<br>  <br>  You have a personal list for blocking addresses in spam options. Anything you mark as spam in Mail classic will be added to that list, in New Yahoo mail adding addresses to the list has to be done manually. If you ever receive anything from those addresses in the future, it will be deleted automatically, you won't even notice when you got some more crap from them. One problem though: the list of blocked addresses is limited to 500 and spammers often change their address. So you must sometimes delete some of the older blocked addresses to make room for new ones.<br>  <br>  Go to this link where everything is explained in detail:<br>  <a href="http://help.yahoo.com/us/tutorials/mail/mail/spamguard1.html">http://help.yahoo.com/us/tutorials/mail/...</a><br>  <br>  #2: The Federal Trade Commission (www.ftc.gov) is supposed to help you eliminate spam mails. Forward spam to: spam@uce.gov, in the subject line enter something like "unsubscribe link results in more spam", "unwanted spam message", "no unsubscribe link" or something similar.<br>  <br>  Here's how to do the forwarding bit: click the crtl key and at the same time click the "forward" button to forward a message as an attachment, mac users should click the "apple" key and click "forward" simultaneously. <br>  <br>  When the FTC gets your mail, they will look into the matter and when they find out who the spamming source is, they will take legal actions. <br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.ftc.gov/bcp/conline/edcams/spam/index.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.ftc.gov/bcp/conline/edcams/sp...</a><br>  <br>  #3: Check Mailwasher, it helps to eliminate spam from your inbox...<br>  <br>  Set up your email account(s) in MailWasher and hit the "Check Mail" button. It then downloads all new message headers and displays message details alongside each one (priority, subject, from, to, etc.). Any email that MailWasher considers to be spam is highlighted for easy sorting.<br>  <br>  Two checkboxes are located next to each message header: "Delete" and "Bounce". If you click "Delete" the email will be marked for deletion, click "Bounce" and the mail will be marked for bouncing - a fake "address not found" email will be sent to the sender. Once you have decided what to bounce and delete, click "Process Mail" to get it done and your mail client launched for downloading all accepted emails.<br>  <br>  MailWasher has a "blacklist" and a "friends list" to enter good and bad email addresses. Addresses in the blacklist are marked for deletion, and addresses in the friends list will be marked as okay. Filters can be set to increase MailWasher's effectiveness.

It will take some research on this one. I'll check back on this question in a bit, after I do that.<br>  <br>  EDIT:<br>  Here are 3 question links, from 3 different accounts (mine, yours and a random one):<br>  <a href="http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;_ylt=AsN5ipuJc7m0oAgAU6qz8hPsy6IX;_ylv=3?qid=20090302112226AA8O3Vz">http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;...</a><br>  <a href="http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;_ylt=AsN5ipuJc7m0oAgAU6qz8hPsy6IX;_ylv=3?qid=20090304115905AAnWh8H">http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;...</a><br>  <a href="http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;_ylt=AsN5ipuJc7m0oAgAU6qz8hPty6IX;_ylv=3?qid=20090302071044AA9v5XT">http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;...</a><br>  <br>  OK, to really see this, you have to copy & paste them on a page in 'landscape' mode, so they don't WRAP on the page. When you do that, you will see that THIS:  AsN5ipuJc7m0oAgAU6qz8hPty6IX is in each one of them. The ONLY thing these 3 questions have in common? They are the FIRST question in that person's list of questions. The 2nd question has a different code there (which is the same for the 2nd question on each person's profile) and the 3rd different again.<br>  <br>  The LAST part of the URL is the 'date stamp' that I mentioned. The first one says: <br>  20090302112226 which is March 02, 2009, at 11:22:26, so it includes the time. The final sequence I assume to be the sequence code, since I'm sure there are many questions that post at the same time, or some other identifying coding.|`|4di2FUSUaa	um....y did u get suspended in the first place?|`|ncCWnApDaa	You could try using google advanced search, just open google search and click the advanced search option, then where it asks for your wording options enter your old profiles user name, where it asks search type within a site or domain copy and paste  <a href="http://answers.yahoo.com">http://answers.yahoo.com</a> that should make finding a few of your old Q&A a bit easier.

Sometimes the person changes their mind, or realizes the question may be out of order or in the wrong category. Many reasons why. But as long as two or more people complain about a question, they will probably continue to be removed.|`|2f739e8b2a5530e501bad3e76a9cb2f7aa	There are several reasons questions are deleted – not all are violations:<br>  ? No answer in 4 days<br>  ? Answered, voters choose "No Best Answer"<br>  ?  Best Answer reported for violation<br>  ?  Reported as violation<br>  <br>  'Harmless' does not mean that the question was not a violation. There are many, many rules and some of them are pretty vague. So things can get reported and removed pretty quickly and easily.
ivjHOJ8daa	Go to  www.imageoptimizer.net where you can optimize the file size, then try sending the smaller file to you phone.<br>  <br>  Hope this helps.|`|6Vaaqle0aa	The only way I could see would be to either change the file type on the phone, or change the resolution.<br>  <br>  Unfortunately, if your downloading from the phone, you'd need to edit them on the PC, which you can't do because you can't open them. You'd have to change the settings on your phone to take photos at a smaller size - such as 680 x 340 instead of 1280 x 720 or something similar. This will lower the size, also changing effects or the quality of the picture on your phone will lower the kb.<br>  <br>  But if you cannot open the files, I would say that there is not much you can do to the photos already on the phone. Unless if you found a friend who can edit the photos and make them smaller of change the file type from .jpg to .bmp or /png (these are smaller usually)

So for you next step, write: Na+2H2O ..> NaOH + H2<br>  Now you have: left: 1Na, 4H, 2O, and the same as before on the right. You now need to add more O on the right. <br>  So your next step is: Na+2H2O -->2NaOH + H2.<br>  Total again: left: 1Na, 4H, 2O; right: 2Na, 2O, 4H<br>  Aha, all you need to do is add one more Na on the left!<br>  Answer: 2Na + 2H2O --> 2NaOH + H2.<br>  Sometimes, you need to then divide by a common factor, but not in this case.<br>  That's the basic procedure, just go one step at a time.

I know we all like to check our mail, but there probably isn't any so urgent that it can't wait until we get home.<br>  <br>  Even if you have your Yahoo! mail forward to your work address, that's even more serious than using the internet from a work computer for non-business matters.  Now you'd be using work email for personal use.  Your IT department can see ever piece of email you get.  If they are blocking access to your Yahoo! mail, they certainly don't want Yahoo! mail coming to your work email on a work computer.  I'd bet anything there are some policies regarding using a work computer for personal use.

Google Toolbar bookmarks are saved at Google.  You can also save your bookmarks with the Firefox add-on Foxmarks.  Bottom line is why trust your bookmarks exclusively to Yahoo!  What if their servers are down.  I save mine in several places.  The downside is keeping all of them in sync.  Good luck.

jKfV6DoOaa	I had unfortunately the same problem as you with my Yahoo!Voice account and I have answered a lot of question to other Yahoo! users that had the same problem. On December. 18.2008 I couldn't make phone calls out anymore and my entire balance disappeared. My Yahoo!Messenger didn't connect to the new web page but to the old one and because of that I couldn't even buy more credit for Yahoo!Call out nor could I update my credit card information. I told them many times that this is because my Yahoo!Messenger ID doesn't connect to the new web page with Jajah. Then my Call in number didn't work either and all of a sudden it disappeared. Yahoo blamed Jajah and visa versa. I wrote to them many times and I called Yahoo Billing department so they refunded me my money for both services. I also talked to Jajah customer service hundreds of times. There was just always the same answer. " We apologize for any inconvenience and we know how frustrating that must be. We will escalate your issue to the superior engineers...etc..etc...bla,bla,bla..." I told them in my costumer surveys what a bunch of "crack heads" they are and how useless and incompetent they are. <br>  I am sure Yahoo knows about all that. The last time ( in January ) they had the nerve to charged me again for my phone number and yahoo call out credit and when I called up Jajah and the Yahoo! Billing department they denied taking money from me but hey...my bank account showed that they did...All my account history was mysteriously gone at that point. So I called up my bank and my bank took all the money back. I have collected an entire file about their messy business practices. <br>  I gave up on them and went with Skype for now. Unfortunately Skype doesn't have any real customer service. I hope that changes some time in the near future. <br>  Jajah is a mess! And Yahoo should have taken precautions to protect their customer from all this. Well, done Yahoo/Jajah. That's how they lost me as their customer. I had enough of them after 2 months of debating with them. <br>  I also never had any problems with my Yahoo!Voice services until Jajah took over. I have been a customer since 2007.<br>  <br>  I think you would need to write to the physical address of Yahoo and put her name on it as the recipient.

7u77AiBjaa	It looks like a problem that I warn many people about when using the personal profile picture module on the Top Page. This is a buggy module and any continual changes you make to that module is a risk. In this case, adjustments have basically messed up the left side of your 360 space's Top Page.<br>  <br>  Scroll down to the bottom and see if you can access the "Edit Personal/Profile Photos" link on the left. You can try adding another image to (or deleting an image from) that module, but if it won't allow you to do that, then try to add a Yahoo! Avatar. See <a href="http://avatars.yahoo.com">http://avatars.yahoo.com</a> and <a href="http://help.yahoo.com/l/us/yahoo/360/profile/profile-19.html">http://help.yahoo.com/l/us/yahoo/360/pro...</a> for more information.<br>  <br>  That's pretty much all you can do, as the Yahoo! 360 team is no longer fixing glitches. If it doesn't work, you will either have to tolerate the elongation until 360 transitions completely to the Y!Profile (<a href="http://profiles.yahoo.com">http://profiles.yahoo.com</a> ), wait until an image you've tried to add pops up (which may not happen), or keep trying to add an image in different spots or at different times.<br>  <br>  Also, you can create a new Yahoo ID so that you can start over with a new 360 space. Starting over does mean that your new space will be empty, and you will have to add friends and data to it. This does not mean that you will avoid encountering the same glitch again though.
7u77AiBjaa	Click "My Profile" to the upper right of this Yahoo! Answers page, then click "Edit My Info" in the top left box on the Answers profile page. Scroll down to the Privacy section and check the option of showing the link to your 360 page. Click Preview button and then the Ok button.<br>  <br>  If it doesn't work (it has been a buggy feature) or the option is missing, put a full link in your "About Me" section.<br>  - Click "My Page" at the top of your 360 space<br>  - Click the drop down menu "Preview as seen by" at the top right of your 360 "My Page". <br>  - Choose PUBLIC as the permission group and click the "Go" button<br>  - Click the "Top Page" link above your personal profile picture section on the left side.<br>  - Select & copy the FULL web address that appears in your web browser's address bar (starting from the http:// part)<br>  - Click "My Profile" to the upper right of this Yahoo! Answers page, then click "Edit My Info" in the top left box on the Answers profile page.<br>  - Paste the address in your Y/A profile's "About Me" section. If you have a Simple URL setup, use that instead. Make sure A SPACE follows the address.<br>  <br>  The feature to display a 360 link is usually blocked to users who are under age 18.

QlzFoBS3aa	Yahoo is often to harsh and unfair, but there are lots of Trolls out there that take offense at the sillynest dumbest stuff who start that process with a click on the report abuse button.  By the way, Yahoo is not very fair at all when it comes to enforcing(NOT) thier so called community guidlines either!   They don't delete most of the offensive questions, that should be removed in gender and women's studies catagories....bunch of male chauvinists on there who total J*ck off*s
nErAWfHxaa	The box only shows up when a question is in voting. That means the asker did not choose a best answer so the rest of us get a say in it. <br>  <br>  If you ask questions, you have to wait for four (4) hours after asking the question in order to choose the "best answer." That's to give folks a fair chance to log in and find your question. Many of us log on and off periodically during the day and we may not be online when you posted.<br>  <br>  Once the four (4) hours have elapsed, go back to view the question. You can do that by clicking on "My Profile" near the top the page, right hand side under the word "discover."<br>  <br>  Once you're at your profile, look under your avatar (photo) and you'll see a list of all the questions you've answered plus a tab you can click to see the questions where you were chosen as "best answer," the questions you've asked and the questions you've starred.<br>  <br>  Click on the word questions and you'll see the list of your questions, click the question and it shows you not only the question but all the answers. There will be a blue box under each answer. Click the box of the answer you liked best. You will get 3 points for choosing.<br>  <br>  Be sure you pick the "best answer" before the time for answering expires or it'll be too late, it'll go into voting. <br>  <br>  IF YOU DIDN'T ASK THE QUESTION, to vote on unresolved questions click the "answer" toolbar at the top of the page then click on the "vote" tab and it'll show you a bunch of questions in voting.|`|1ac3781b361a0972a1980084331b52c5aa	The "No Best Answer" option is only for In Voting questions. Either the question was posted by you or by any user and went into VOTING, you will find this option below the last answer to the question.<br>  <br>  For YOUR "Open" questions that were posted for AT LEAST 4 hours and before 4 days, you can CHOOSE the best answer from among the answers to your question. In this case there is NO option for choosing "No Best Answer".<br>  <br>  For more information, click the links below▼▼

5TgdJTAYaa	If you are using Yahoo, there seems to be multiple problems.  Several people I know created a new account, including me, and now we can't access those accounts.  Our old Yahoo accounts seem to work, but not the new ones.  We don't have time for this sort of nonsense, and will switch to Hotmail if it isn't resolved in a day or two.<br>  <br>  There is no excuse for Yahoo not having a phone number posted for reporting problems.  They have deactivated their feedback, so clicking on that button is worthless.

7u77AiBjaa	Scroll down in the "Edit Custom Theme" popup window, past the upload image part, to get to where you can change colors. Basic coding for web pages involves HTML. Hex codes are used to represent colors in HTML. You can change colors for the fields by doing one of the following:<br>  <br>  1) Click on the little box next to the right of the item. You can move the color scroll bar up and down if you like, then click around in the color square with your mouse (or select the transparent option). For non-transparent fields, you should see the hex code (6 total letters and numbers) appear on the line and little box color change.<br>  <br>  2) Copy and paste color codes from this site - <a href="http://www.december.com/html/spec/color.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.december.com/html/spec/color....</a> . I find it to be a faster method that makes it easier to see shades of color. You can also type the word - transparent - instead of a color code, so that your background shows through for certain fields.<br>  <br>  See <a href="http://help.yahoo.com/l/us/yahoo/360/profile/profile-21.html">http://help.yahoo.com/l/us/yahoo/360/pro...</a> for a graphic displaying the location of fields on your 360 space.

2f739e8b2a5530e501bad3e76a9cb2f7aa	You don't do that. Yahoo is a website and it stays there. SOME of the tools it offers you can download, like Messenger, the Toolbar, etc., but the site of Yahoo is not a download.

VQdqogD7aa	The obvious answer is because it is corrupt.  If you are asking how it got that way, it is difficult to answer because you do not state the OS (operating system), browser and version, i.e., your configuration.  It's best to un-install the Y! toolbar and re-install from toolbar.yahoo.com.
WqkOI7RDaa	If it's a copyrighted video, like you'd buy from a store, you'll need a whole list of tools which are illegal and which I cannot recommend without risking the deletion of my account. <br>  If it's burned in data format, she should be able to access it by going to My computer, right-clicking on the drive, and selecting 'explore.' The video can then be drag and dropped onto the desktop.<br>  <br>  Emailing it with yahoo can be tricky. Normally selecting 'add file' is the only way, but the allowed size is so small the video will probably not attach. <br>  Instead go to a website like megaupload or sendspace or savefile, which will allow you to upload your video for free. Then, she can email the link to you, and you can download it from there. Depending on the size of your video, this could take hours.

They receive unexpected answers because the question has been mis interpreted, and then the asker gets annoyed! <br>  <br>  There is not much excuse for poor use of the English language, and so it automatically makes me wonder about the intelligence of the asker, which in turn affects the tone and content of answers. <br>  <br>  Yahoo is indeed a global service, but there are different versions of YA for different countries, and if English is not the person's mother tongue, they usually put a note to that effect. <br>  <br>  I know to most there are more important things in the world, but I agree with the statement, "How do you expect us to take you seriously if you can't even spell properly."  There's even a spell checker!<br>  <br>  Thank you, rant over,<br>  All the best, <br>  <br>  Han<br>  <br>  Edit: yes I agree the spell checker is flawed, but it only affects a handful of words. Besides if someone uses the spell check and puts the US spelling, I would not correct it.|`|QG6TlDGcaa	Well, because either the person asking the question doesn't speak English as a first language and may be grateful for the correction, or because the person asking thinks they speak English as a first language and therefore NEEDS the correction.  <br>  <br>  You should never end an interrogative with an exclamation mark, it makes you look about six.|`|ae69df0205dd6e6d96e6d67fdc47b203aa	Its because the english language evolves and grows ... it is not there for the illiterate and lazy to butcher.<br>  <br>  Its about time the 'with it' were given a slap from time to time, it'll help you get employment some day.<br>  <br>  Why do you ask ... feeling threatened?|`|LIxpXTnLaa	stop trying to use semicolons. you are failing.|`|RhkKGsipaa	I ignore those people this is not a grammar nor a spelling class.|`|FGMDbhoJaa	It's we're not 'where'<br>  Ciat Murachú I actually agree with you it's a lot of bullshite|`|f5wTQblsaa	I put my hand up to this one, I'm afraid, it's habit from years of correcting my children's grammar and spelling mistakes.  I hate text spell, it's lazy and disrespectfull, the only people I will allow to 'get away' spelling errors are the one who were taught to spell the way it sounds, and that was only for a few years in the 80s.<br>  Thumb downers will have a field day with this answer|`|gGZz2EGyaa	I do not have a problem with the grammar and spelling on here, as long as I can understand the question then that's all that matters.  The spell check on here does wind me up sometimes when it keeps flashing that I spelt a word wrong.  I go to check and it brings up the American spelling of the word and not the English.<br>  You do see a lot of answers where they spend time correcting the spelling and grammar and do not answer the question.  If they feel like that then why do they not just move on to another question. They really must be desperate for two points.<br>  The only thing that annoys me, well it does not even annoy me really, I just find some questions done in text talk looses me a bit.  I am getting more used to  the texting but I have to pass on some questions when it is too much text.|`|6mVpfmR6aa	You made a pretty decent point here.  If you really understand the question/answer, why correct it.<br>  <br>  However, you also need to consider that some people would like the correction.  This assists them, in writing better in other forums.  By the way due to the various ways of spelling words, spellchecking is not completely effective.

7u77AiBjaa	Closing your entire Yahoo account gives you the best chance to completely remove your 360 space from the web. Closing a Yahoo account does cancel access (and for some removes associated content) to Yahoo services under that account. Otherwise, if you do not want to lose your Yahoo ID, your second-best option is content removal and permissions adjustment.<br>  <br>  So, here are your two choices:<br>  <br>  1) Go to <a href="http://help.yahoo.com/l/us/yahoo/edit/changing_users/edit-23.html">http://help.yahoo.com/l/us/yahoo/edit/ch...</a> and click the Account Deletion link. If you read through the text, you will find this will also delete all associated services for that account like Yahoo! Mail. I still recommend removing any content that you've added to your 360 before deleting your entire account.<br>  <br>  NOTE: If a COMPLETELY deleted account doesn't result in a deleted 360 space, you can contact Yahoo Customer Care through this Account Deletion Help Form at <a href="http://help.yahoo.com/l/us/yahoo/edit/registration/deletion.html">http://help.yahoo.com/l/us/yahoo/edit/re...</a> and/or use the 360 ABUSE FORM at <a href="http://help.yahoo.com/l/us/yahoo/360/abuse.html">http://help.yahoo.com/l/us/yahoo/360/abu...</a> . You can also call 1-866-562-7219, 1-408-349-1572, 1-408-349-3300 Hours: 8a-5p M-F (Pacific).It's possible that you won't be deleted COMPLETELY from the user registration database until after 90 days.<br>  <br>  2) If you don't want to completely lose your Yahoo ID, then I suggest removing all content and information that you added to Yahoo! 360. Make all your settings (basic info, blog, communication, and every module on your "My Page") set to "Friends" or "Just Me (Private)". The "Just Me (Private)" setting is preferred, but if you don't have that option choose "Friends." Delete all your friends (see <a href="http://help.yahoo.com/l/us/yahoo/360/friends/friends-05.html">http://help.yahoo.com/l/us/yahoo/360/fri...</a> ). Remove content from automatically public areas like the Personal Profile Picture module and Top Page comments. If you want to remove blog entries (beyond adjusting the permissions), click the "Delete" link below each one on the "My Blog" page. Change the background back to the default version - either called the "custom" or "classic" theme. Then, that's it.
