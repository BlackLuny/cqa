But since it was after 8:30 - by 32 mins - it does not process until May 1. So - CRA says it is late.   However - my actual paper file return got mailed in a convenience post office 5 minutes before they closed at 10:30 pm. They told me it would be stamped as of April 30. Will I get fined the 5% charge. No matter who I speak to - no one wants to help me with this. The bank won't budge, CRA won't budge - I'm tired of calling. The ironic thing is I am being punished because I was honest and declared cash income - so it caused me to have to pay. According to Canadian Government - if you are honest - you pay - and the people who don't - are subsidized by you.

20080929221232AAfA7JT	Business & Finance;Renting & Real Estate	Can I be forced to sell my home?	Ok I'll try to make this as short as possible (if it's even possible)...       We have a first and a second mortgage on our home. I had developed somewhat of a friendship (via phone) with our broker over the years. He had done a 2 or 3 loans for me prior to the one's I currently have. When we went into doing a good size remodel he did a 30 year fixed mortgage loan that was killing me financially during construction. So, during the end of construction May 05' we refinanced into a Negative AM Loan and due to needing more $ to finish our project we took out a second in the amount of $25,000 ($20,0000 was what our contractor told us we needed for completion). The plan was that a Negative AM would give us a little extra cash if we needed it for the finishing touches. With this loan I could choose month to month to either make a Neg AM minimum payment, interest only payment, 30 year fixed or 15 year fixed payment. After a year we would refinance the 1st and 2nd into 1.       Well, I had called our broker 3-4 times in the months following the signing of papers concerning when the payment for the 2nd was due and for how much. 1st contact was about 1 month after completion of the loan to let him know I hadn't recieved a statement for the 2nd. He said it was on his desk and he hadn't gotten to it but will soon. I called at least 3 more times over the next few months and was told the same thing during the 2nd and 3rd contact. Then by the 4th contact he said don't worry about it just appreciate it now. I thought ok I guess we'll just deal with it later (yes, I know that sounds stupid and why would someone do that right?)  I didn't really think much of it because like I said we had developed somewhat of a friendship over the years. (And NO not sexual, I have never met the man in person and I am MARRIED)        A year came and went, then a year and a half came. I called him sometime in January or February 07' to asked him when we were going to refinance the loans. He said let's do it. I started the process of submitting all the paperwork and he ordered an appraisal which we paid for out of our pocket. The result was that we had plenty of equity to qualify but due to our credit scores at the time (which weren't to bad but not great) he advised us to wait because the interest rates were continuing to drop and he was confident that we could get a better interest rate if we were to wait a little longer. We both agreed.       Another year went by. In January 08' I called him again to start the process of refinancing. Again, I submitted the paperwork and paid for another apprasial. I shared my concern with him regarding the news of foreclosures and it making it harder for me to get refinanced. I let him know I didn't want to lose my home. He understood my concern but was still confident and advised me not to worry. He wanted us to somehow cut our credit card debt down by 50%. He suggested to borrow money from our family or friends. Well, needless to say that was not possible. I don't have any rich family members or friends that would let me borrow 6 or $7,000. This was so I could manipulate the balance of my close to being maxed out credit cards. So, that's how we left it. I was to try and get my credit cards down. That was in March. I called him and July to let him know I wanted to get it done. He asked me to call him back next week. I agreed but didn't. Not on purpose, but at my job, the summer is crazy.      Coincidentally, while our economy is going down the crapper, I recieved a phone call from him a couple of days ago letting me know we needed to come up with some kind of plan, he said I needed to come up with atleast $15,000 in 30 days!!!! If I do that he will wait on the rest so I can continue to pay down my debts and refinance me later. He told me if I didn't, we would have to sell our house because, at this time I still have enough equity to pay him off.       So, after this long story my question is... can he force us to sell our home? I have been loyal in paying my 1st on time without default. I don't have a problem paying him back, I did borrow the money. It's not like I've ignored the 2nd completely either. I have looked through my paperwork and it doesn't have any payment address or who to make the payment out to. Can he just all of a sudden demand this money to be paid to him? Can he force my family out on the streets? For a $25,000 debt I had inquired about a number of times and a first that has no default against it.

20060804210326AAA40Na	Business & Finance;Careers & Employment	What should one typically expect as a professional body piercing apprentice at a tattoo studio?	I would like to become a professional body piercer and have been seeking education through an apprenticeship. After feverishly searching for opportunities in the area for about six months, I was offered a position as a piercing apprentice. I was not asked to pay money, but was told that I would be expected to do a lot of work at the shop. I have been working for a few days now and am very excited to have this opportunity. So far I have found that doing work without expecting monetary compensation really challenges one's beliefs in how willing they are to succeed. I understand that this is an intregal part of an apprenticeship, since training in a craft is being provided in return. Considering even the tuition costs for a one-year community college certificate it does not seem that unreasonable if compared to being paid minimum wage. Even so, I have been given a hard time by family and friends who feel that I am simply being "used" and that I am unfairly getting nothing in return.

20090227130435AADb30j	Business & Finance;Investing	For or against EMH and is it possible to win in the market?	What do you think?    In my opinion EMH is generally flawed. And I am not saying this just driven by some greed to make money :), but because markets, though complex, are actually fairly easy to explain: It's like a game: many players using different technics and some are better, some worse.    It's unrealistic to assume that all traders use one and the same method and hence all available information reflects the price the same way. For example, reading some studies I see that about 90% of the traders use technical analysis - while the rest funamental( keep in mind that quantitative analysis is also technical - academics just use more 'academical' name :). Now...think about what percentage of those traders use MA, what percentage use neural networks, what percentage "three white soldiers". It's simple: Game where the better players win - if we speak of uncertainty - better look at quantum physics and geneology - you MIGHT find some randomness there.

20090308005404AAJoksJ	Business & Finance;Small Business	Why is it expensive to setup a small scale website?	I'm reading a book on setting up a business from home, which said that even a small website will cost 1000s of dollars up front, but why? I have estimated that the total cost of my website is about $200 since I have bought a web site template with a shopping cart that I have customised myself, and I'm going to go with inmotion hosting which costs about $8 per month to host an ecommerce site. So the total cost is approximately $500. A merchant ID will take a small fee from every product I sell online and I will probably try and increase my market exposure through Amazon and Ebay. For my first year of trading I have set the goal of selling a 1000 units. So why is it going to be so expensive? What are the hidden costs?

My employer has said they won't lay us off ( i would imagine to avoid having to pay anything out for unemployment).  We are working maybe 25 hrs a week,  it is a full time job based on a 40 hr min work week.  They are stringing us along with this and its not fair, because technically i am laid off because the money i make is not enough to cover bills; however, we can't collect unemployment because no real layoff has taken place.  Is this legal? I mean how far can they go 10 hrs per week, 5, 1 and still not lay us off so we can collect unemployment.  At least when you actually get laid off, thats it, and you can dedicate your time to looking for another job.

I'm looking at a 1 bed flat for ￡525 a month and the listing doesnt mention anything about any bills being included so I guess I'll be paying for gas, water, electric, council tax etc, but how much are these likely to be per month for 1 person in a 1 bed flat? Roughly?

20090308012854AAfsUV6	Business & Finance;Personal Finance	Should I use a student loan to pay off my credit card(s)?	Ok so I have two credit cards with outstanding balances and have been hassled by the companies for months.  I don't have a job currently and am searching quite frantically, but I can't seem to land one; until I do get work I was wondering if I should use a student loan to pay them off.  I have a BofA platinum card with a $1000 limit and i'm over about $200 and a JCPenney with a $400 limit and i'm less than 100 over.  Stupid decisions have lead to my debt, please don't say how stupid I was for overcharging, because I realize that.  I'm not sure how much the interest is on the cards, but i want to pay them off now and hopefully when I get a job start paying off my student loan(they usually let you pay it off after you graduate, this is my 2nd year in college and I'm a music major planning to graduate with a masters in no more than 6 years)  What do you think?

I'm a hostess at a fine dining restaurant in California and my manager and the entire hostess staff recieve "handshake" tips. Typically our manager decides what we get out of the total amount at the end of the night. Typically she takes 50% and the two hostesses of the shift get 25% each. Sometimes the total amount can be $200 and over. Is this against the law for her to do even if the tip is given to her??
