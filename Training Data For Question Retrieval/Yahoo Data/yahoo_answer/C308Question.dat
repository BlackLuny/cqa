Okay you'll have to bear with me here, as neither song is on Youtube. Well there's a version of "Moog Island" there but it's the wrong one, trust me. xD      "Moog Island" - Morcheeba (1996)    http://songza.com/    Type in "moog island" and it should be the first song to come up. Click on it, then click the Play option that appears. It takes a few seconds for it to start off, it's a rather slow song, so be patient. xD         "Jupiter Island" - Porcupine Tree (1991)    http://www.deezer.com/#music/result/all/...    Click on the little arrow (not the plus sign) next to the song and it'll start up at the side.            Which song do you like better? Which lyrics?

I know they say it's because it makes the clothes look better, but don't you think they should be designing clothes that look good on normal, healthy girls? If their clothes can only look good on one body type that barely anyone has, then doesn't that say something about their designing skills?      Sorry for the rant, it's just that I'd love to be a model but I wouldn't want to have an eating disorder to qualify. Why can't they have a type of modeling where healthy girls model rather than super skinny or plus size.

I do not like her as a mother and i never did. Lately she has ben either ditching me, or just pointlessly complaining to me. Sometimes she just tells me to leave her house, but my other friends say to stay. My mom told everyone she's having a party tomorrow, and i offered to bring some stuff, then all of the sudden she says 'i cant go' and starts bitching me out in front of all of my friends and they were just like "wtf y would u be mean to your own son like that" and now every1 is pissed because i was bringing stuff.       My mom even gets my dad in on it sometimes at dinnertime They always scream that I love some girl or whatever. They say, for example I got a butt transplant, I want a nose job, I'm a loser, I'm stupid...and nothing is true! I'm actually very handsome and I am way smarter than them!      And I told them that if they're gonna insult me like that, they should say something that's true. Sometimes they say really mean things, like I'm a prostitute or something! Totally untrue!      I try to laugh along with them, and I know they're only kidding, but it's very rude. What can I do to show them I am able to stand up for myself? Even them, themselves say that I should say something mean back, but I'm too nice. What do I do?!!

I totally think that Molly and Jason were communicating while he and Melissa were still engaged.

"And getting confirmation about Molly in front of people like that was a complete classless move if you ask me - how could you do that to me after I repeatedly asked you about it? I'm not stupid, I knew about Molly... and you lied to me about it," she wrote. "I can't even tell you how much respect I lost for you"      I think him and that too easy Molly were communicating while he was still engaged to Melissa.        Am I the only one here or am I just too eager to jump on the conspiracy theory...lol.

20090227082450AA5WE9d	Entertainment & Music;Movies	Which war film was most emotionally touching: Black Hawk Down, Platoon, or Saving Private Ryan?	I saw some of Black Hawk Down, never saw Saving Private Ryan, but I did see all of Platoon which was clearly one of the saddest films I've ever seen. I just really felt bad for everyone in the film: the soliders and the villagers. I could feel deep pain when the U.S. Army torched the Vietnamese village and when they killed some of the people all because of fear, anger, and desperation. They got used to murder. I really felt bad for Elias as he was the only one (and later Chris Taylor) who cared one bit about the natives and didn't assume them as helping the Viet Cong Army they were fighting against in an effort to destroy communist influence. I don't remember why there was protest against the war but I think it had more to do with the fact that Vietnam didn't attack any U.S. territories than the fact that U.S. soldiers were dying because when World War II broke out the U.S. was eager to get revenge on Japan for attacking the Pearl Harbor military base.
20090227084537AAwuXIv	Entertainment & Music;Movies	Do you think this new Street Fighter film will be a sufficient upgrade from the 1994 debacle?	I think the new Street Fighter film will be good as long as the acting is decent and the fighting is realistic and not just a bunch of wire work. Still I would have preferred to see Ming Na come back because she is the only actor in the original film who did her role decently and the film should have been told in narrative from her perspective instead of focusing so much on Guile and the military. The character development for everybody else was so flawed in that movie. I hope the new Street Fighter movie is good but I still have my reservations about it. I hope Kristin Kreuk captures the essence of Chun-Li well but somehow I still think it will be a bit of a disaster just like the 1994 film. I'm going to see it tomorrow with my little brother so we'll see how it is!

20090306164255AAVCte5	Entertainment & Music;Television;Drama	Song that was on CSI: NY?	It was from last season, I think.  I actually don't watch the show, I just happened to catch the last few minutes of it and heard a song I liked.      I believe the song was featured in an episode where the lead character (played by Gary Sinise) found out he had a son, and went to track him down.  A song starts playing, it kind of sounded a lot like the band Muse.  The only lyric I could really remember was "a house doesn't make a home."      I know it's really vague, but if you could help, that would be awesome. =]

20090227081718AAt5nTs	Entertainment & Music;Music;Rap and Hip-Hop	Can anyone come with an ORIGINAL argument against hip hop? (INTELLIGENT DEBATE ONLY!!!)?	This isn't a intended to be a confrontational... I'm genuinely curious about why some people still, in 2009, make the "rap isn't music" argument.    I still have yet to read anyone's criticism that isn't simply a rehash of the same things every generation says about the music that emerges after their "time" or isn't based on the premise that all hip hop has violent, misogynistic or materialistic themes. This is incorrect, as has been proven thousands of times before since anyone who's a serious fan of hip hop could name 10 MC's off the top of their head who don't fit that category.      So... as the title asks... can anyone make an ORIGINAL argument against hip hop?

20090304170034AAvA3jw	Entertainment & Music;Comics & Animation	Anime title question, Is it Kimi Ga Nozomu Eien?	Okay, So I remember watching an anime about...      Girl A and B and one guy. The guy went out with both girls. All three of them meet up at the house and some drama goes down. In a later episode, Girl A asks the boy to meet up at her house. She asks him if he wants tea, he accepts. He hears a phone going off in the next room and he picks it up. A rapid amount of texts fill the phone like ''I'm sorry'' or something like that and the chick brings a butchers knife and cuts him up over and over. Girl B finds the guy dead.       Girl A and B meet up at a roof top of some place and girl B pulls out a knife and slits the girl open. She examines her body and says something like ''See, there's nothing in there at all...''      I'm sorry this was so long. Am I mixing up animes? This anime had multipul endings I'm sure. Do you have a link where I could find this specific ending? Thanks.

20090306160428AAztJmQ	Entertainment & Music;Music;Jazz	Have you noticed that the logo on Vandoren ZZ reeds have changed and that this affects the playability?	I play alto sax and have been using Vandoren ZZ reeds (3) for years. I've played them before they came in their new "flow" packaging, too. But something I've noticed is that the logo on the actual reed used to be black, but is now brown and indented into the reed. Has anyone else noticed this? Or have I just had a couple bad boxes? I've seen this on every single reed in two boxes that I've played. It seems to lower the quality of the reed, and this frustrates me because they used to be my favorite reeds to use.      Let me know if you've also experienced this.

Only problem is, there aren't really any kid movies out near us right now. The only one that we found that he would probably be interested is Bedtime Stories with Adam Sandler. I know its Disney so its kid friendly but has anyone seen it and think my 3 year old will sit through it? He loves to watch movies and not just cartoons either! Just wanted some opinions from anyone who has actually seen it! Thanks!

Don't get me wrong i'm not defending his actions. they were wrong but something tells me riri isn't so innocent. And its crazy how everyone believes so. If you look at  R. Kelly who had a sex tape out during which he had sex with a minor. His image is not the same but his career is not over. People still buy his albums. Michael Jackson who had child molesting charges put on him. Yet if he did a world tour his concert would most likely sell out every city. So give him a break. He will have to deal with his legal issues in court.

Okay, I found this website that replicates many guitars and sells them way cheaper, my guitar teacher buys guitars from it, he showed me his real Les Paul and their Les Paul he bought, and I couldn't tell the differrence, and they sounded exactly the same too! This real les paul is $4 399:       http://guitars.musiciansfriend.com/produ...       The Replica is $240       http://www.yueqi99.com/list.asp?ProdId=0...       a great deal, now I know its a replica, but Isnt $240 worth is for the guitar anyways, the wood alone on the duplicate probably costs just as much as that, and that crazy design and all the work put into it, the replica is still a great price $240 for a les paul, that too my ear sounds identical to the original! So My question is even though its a replica (that's established) Is it still a good deal?

So the preacher grabs him and dunks him in the water.   He pulls him up and asks the drunk, 'Brother have you found Jesus?'   The drunk replies, 'No, oi haven't found Jesus.'   The preacher shocked at the answer, dunks him into the water again for a little longer.   He again pulls him out of the water and asks again, 'Have you found Jesus me brother?'   The drunk again answers, 'No,oi I haven't found Jesus.'   By this time the preacher is at his wits end and dunks the drunk in the water again ---   but this time holds him down for about 30 seconds and when he begins kicking his arms and legs he pulls him up.   The preacher again asks the drunk, 'For the love of God have you found Jesus yet.?'

20090306190505AA9b3Ce	Entertainment & Music;Movies	Why do people need to see movies on opening night?	It's not like the movie is going to explode if you don't go see it on that night.  I personally CAN'T STAND going to see new movies on opening night due to the following:   - there are always ignorant teenagers blocking the bathroom or the lineup to go by your tickets.  I say "excuse me" nicely to get by & then they give me attitude like I've wrecked their entire world.  Next person that does this, I'm going to jam your iPod up your @$$ & strangle you with your ear-buds.   - there are always self-absorbed teens @!#$%ing w/ their cellphones during the movie.  The light is distracting or it makes noise. It makes me want to ram the phone into your eye-socket to shut you up. What are you texting that it can't wait? probably something like "im like totally waching wtchmn n stuf. u?" [Yes, I deliberately misspelled that].  Grow up.    - someone brings their 5 yr old, & the poor kid cries or is loud, or scared.  It's a 2.5 hr long movie! That's just cruel & inhumane to do to a kid! Pls get a babysitter or wait 'till it comes out on DVD. It's unreasonable to expect your little one to be quiet for that long.    - you end up having to go with a group of about 9 people & you don't end up sitting together anyway because you get to the theatre late.  This is a result of one of the party being late & screwing it up for everybody else.    - people eating popcorn like they haven't eaten in a month. Close your goddamn mouth when you eat! or eat a sandwich before you show up. We don't need to hear you chomping like you're @ a trough.       Are people that blinded by media that you can't wait a few days for the crowds to die down? Do you need to be part of the "cool crowd" THAT bad so you have 1 or 2 sentences to add for the water cooler talk / 10 minutes before your class on Monday morning?  Are you people THAT much of a mindless sheep? Are you trying to earn a merit badge or something?!       Disclaimer: Pls note that not all teens are ignorant @ theaters.  For those that are courteous, you have my deepest thanks.     Thanks for letting me rant, sorry it was so long.
20090306192753AANF0Mo	Entertainment & Music;Television;Drama	Lie to Me (US series; Fox): What do you think?	My thoughts:      Tim Roth is my favorite living actor (Peter Lorre is my favorite dead one. Yes, I have strange tastes). Therefore, I am predisposed to like this. BUT...      The old team-splits-up thing feels tired. I appreciate that they try to split it up differently from time to time, but it still feels old. I liked the ambassador-at-the-wedding episode best thanks to this, because they didn't really split up.      The angsty teenager daughter thing feels tired, although they're trying to keep it to a minimum, I think.      I am apparently one of those super-duper microexpression readers, because I catch them before Cal or some other character inevitably points them out. Either that or the expressions are way, way too telegraphed.      Of course, the acting is good. The writing is OK, but could be better. This isn't Roth's worst project by any means (that honor probably goes to Lucky Numbers, or all of Four Rooms that was not directed by Robert Rodriguez). I still don't know what to think, though.

Even if they don't write their songs, they still play them, and no one listens to artistic merit! People listen to music. They don't listen to how "indie" a band is, do they? No. And even if the JoBro's kind of music isn't your style, is it too much to respect them as artists?    I mean, they have a lot of fans, and they aren't doing bad stuff, and they're even very nice to their fans. I know the whole "imma marry nick and joe" is annoying, but musically, the Jonas Brothers are not bad.    Agreed?   Thank you <3

I mean, since I quit I haven't been able to stop playing, but i just mess around with it, not actually playing a song or anything, just riffs and stuff. Anyway, if I start taking lessons again, do you think it will take me long to get back to how good I was before? Is it like riding a bike, once I start again, i'll remember quickly? Thanks for answering!

"I can't get any water from that water hole, Grandma" exclaimed Johnny. "There's a BIG ol' alligator down there!"      "Now don't you mind that ol' alligator, Johnny. He's been there for a few years now, and he's never hurt no one. Why, he's probably as scared of you as you are of him!"      "Well, Grandma," replied Johnny, "if he's as scared of me as I am of him, then that water ain't fit to drink!"

20090306164952AARrM1B	Entertainment & Music;Jokes & Riddles	Help, I want to make this funny?	(You can skip to the end if you don't want to know all the details, they don't really matter that much)       My two best friends and I were hanging out one night and one of my friends signed onto facebook on my computer but she didn't realize she left it signed on when she left so when I went to sign out I noticed that one of our other friends messaged about how excited she was about my surprise party. I got really excited but I wasn't going to let her know I knew. Today when I was coming home from school I was talking to one of my other friends and I asked her if she knew about it and she started smiling so I knew she did so I invited her over to get information about it. I figured out that it is going to be the saturday night before my birthday (my birthday is on a Sunday) but I have no clue who's invited or what we'll be doing, all I know is that its going to be at my house and that one of my friends is going to take me to a "birthday movie" and then they'll take me home to the party. After she told me this I realized that there had been a lot of signs that this was going to happen, like how the friend thats throwing it stopped my other friend that she doesn't talk to, to give her a note and that my sister wants to see a movie that night.      Anyways, I thought it would be really funny if I could maybe mess with them and ruin the surprise, I considered that when my sister asks again to go to a movie, I'll tell her that I don't feel like it and that I just wanna stay home on the couch (which is the room they'd party in) but I thought of asking you wonderful people if you had any idea's of something funnier to do, please comment! =]

So, I’ve always wondered if you could create your very own super band…who would you choose??? what kind of music would they play? and what would you call them?? My super band would look something like this       singer: I'm thinking Fabiola Gatti, also maybe add Caroline Polachek for backing vocals and add Karen O for the shouty bits. also add M.i.a for some weird bits in the middle of the song lol.   guitars : the guys from Vampire Weekend and Hockey   synths : Andrew Vanwyngarden and Gaspard Augé   drums: programmed by Hot Chip   also bring Brendon Urie on piano for the boring songs (if any)   backing dancers: Kevin Barnes, Yannis Philippakis, Noel Fielding      would be the best music in the world and they would all look amazing on stage!   I would call them “hipsters united” haha…

It sounded like an 80's song, the keyboards and synths were extremely cheesy, and the singer was terrible.  The only understandable lyric was something along the lines of "mystical imagery".  The tone of the song was kind of spacey and occasionally they had men speaking in the background.  The song was in a cycle of verse, chorus, verse, chorus, verse, chorus, bridge, verse chorus..etc.  And it was about 7 minutes long.  As you can tell, I really want to know the name of this song.  If you know it, thanks :)

20090306193246AAVyeqn	Entertainment & Music;Music;Other - Music	Need help finding a song.....kinda slow....chorus is hard to understand...help?	I heard a song on the radio the other day but it didn't say the title or artist or anything. It's kind of a slow song, but it has guitar and drums and stuff. I think it would be under alternative genre, maybe rock. The chorus is hard to understand; I couldn't even make out the words when listening to it. The only lyrics I remember is "push-up bra". I know it is very vague, but any ideas would be welcome.

20090306193921AAYIxeJ	Entertainment & Music;Jokes & Riddles	Do you know the answers to these riddles?	What is:   The beginning of eternity   The end of time and space   The beginning of every end   And the end of every place      What is the situation?   I am afraid to go home because the man in the mask is there...       What is so delicate that when you say its name it is broken?       A man was walking in the jungle. He only had one bullet in his gun. But yet he shot a puma and a cougar. How did he do this?       Dead in the center there is a bunny on an island. 6 feet north, 6 feet south, 6 feet west, and 6 feet east is land. How many jumps does it take to get to the other side?       How many letters are in the alphabet?      What state is surrounded by the most water?      A farmer and his hired help were carrying grain to the barn. The farmer carried one sack of grain and the hired help carried two sacks. Who carried the heavier load and why?       George, Helen, and Steve are drinking coffee.   Bert, Karen, and Dave are drinking soda.   Using logic, is Elizabeth drinking coffee or soda?      I cannot be felt, seen or touched;   Yet I can be found in everybody;   My existence is always in debate;   Yet I have my own style of music.   What Am I?       There is a common English word that is nine letters long. Each time you remove a letter from it, it still remains an English word - from nine letters right down to a single letter. What is the original word, and what are the words that it becomes after removing one letter at a time?      A man was born in 1955. He's alive and well today at age 33. How is this possible?       What is the next 3 letters in this riddle?   o t t f f s s _ _ _       I soar without wings, I see without eyes.   I've traveled the universe to and fro.   I've conquered the world, yet I've never been anywhere but home.   Who am I?       A woman shoots her husband.   Then she holds him under water for over 5 minutes.   Finally, she hangs him.   But 5 minutes later they both go out together and enjoy a wonderful dinner together.   How can this be?       What force and strength cannot get through, I with a gentle touch can do.   And many in the street would stand, were I not a friend at hand.   What am I?       Well here is a lot of riddles I hope you like them!

20090306211952AA3DtNk	Entertainment & Music;Music;R&B & Soul	Why are so many people of all races so down on Chris Brown, why do they want to destroy his life and career?	A 19 year old kid makes a mistake and it seems the whole world wants to see him destroyed, its crazy. I mean, I don't condone  beating up women or anyone else for that matter but he is only 19 years old, everyone deserves a second chance, Rhianna has forgiven him why can't everyone else do likewise.      I can't say the it entirely a racial thing either seeing that so many black people are calling for his head also. Give the kid a break, he has suffered and lost much, and I believe that he has learned a very valuable lesson and will ultimately be a better man because of this experience.      These are two very young talented successful and very wealthy kids who seem to be in love, we don't know all the facts in this case and one bad mistake doesn't make anyone a bad person. I think everyone should just back-off and let them mend their mistakes and heal their wounds as the attempt to get their life back on track...
20090306205556AAo0gNp	Entertainment & Music;Celebrities	Why are so many people of all races so down on Chris Brown, why do they want to destroy his life and career?	A 19 year old kid makes one mistake and it seems the whole world wants to take away everything he has worked so hard for his entire short life.       Now, I don't condone the beating of women or any person but every one deserves a second chance, plus Rhianna has forgiven him so why can't we all do likewise ? i mean we don't even know all the facts of the case yet most of you rush to judgment against this young man.       I can't honestly say its solely because hes a young, talented, successful and very rich black man, seeing that so many black people are calling for his head too.       We live and learn, give the kid a break, I think the he has learned a very valuable lesson because of this experience and will go on to be a better man because of it. I can't help but wonder if it were a white couple would so many be calling for the head of the young white male...

Did you know that if you use the 'To' or 'Cc' (Carbon copy) lines, and there are multiple addresses, each and every one of these addresses (including yours) is more likely to receive Spam?   With the 'Bcc' (Blind carbon copy), all addresses are kept private. Most people prefer you use this line to cut down on their junk mail by reducing chances of falling into the hands of Spammers.

20090306210553AAR6aUT	Entertainment & Music;Movies	What do you think of the ending of "A League of Their Own?"?	Okay...first of all, yes, I know I'm a complete dork for asking this,(Considering it's 2009, and this movie was made in 1992) but what do you think about the ending to "A League of Thier Own"?   I just watched the DVD again tonight (I haven't watched it in years) and the ending still bothers me.    Here are my thoughts on it:   1.) You have to draw your own conclusion as to whether or not Dotty dropped the ball on purpose.    2.) Okay, so if Dotty did drop the ball on purpose, she did it to help her sister, right? The problem I have with that is that Kit was not a likeable character at all in the movie. She was whiny, and had this distorted image that she was a great baseball player. So why would the producer have her come out on top and have Dotty, the likeable character come out on bottom?   3.) Now, let's say Dotty didn't drop the ball on purpose. All through out the movie, Dotty's the strong player, and suddenly, during this very last scene Kit suddenly becomes strong enough to knock Dotty over to the point that Dotty loses the ball?   Can you help me make some sense of this ending? :)

20090306213718AA6VAMH	Entertainment & Music;Music;Rap and Hip-Hop	Out of these songs.....?	Out of all these songs that were on the BET Top 100 for the end of last year, here are the ones that involved "hip hop" artists in some way......I look thro the list and I am not surprised at how many of these songs was wack and I completely hated.....Look at some of the ones you like and dont like and see where the rappers in the songs are from...  You'll probably notice theres some regions of the country that you like their music way more than others......These were the most played and shown on TV videos last year which really makes me really really embarrassed where I think hip hop is headed.....I'd like to see which cities or regions your least favorite songs or from......I just thought it would be interesting to see......

20090306200544AAA1hO5	Entertainment & Music;Television;Soap Operas	Question about GH fanfic I am writing?	I am writing a story where my original character, Arianna, is the daughter of Claudia.        Story Synopsis - Claudia found out she was pregnant after she slept with both Sonny and Ric.  Her father was tormenting her and she didn't want him to end up hurting her baby.  She left for Italy, not telling anyone (even Johnny) where she was going.  A few months later, she called Carly and asked her to fly to Rome to meet her.  Carly went and Claudia asked her to adopt her baby.  Carly agreed and seven months later, Carly took Ari home to the U.S.  Ari was ten when Carly and Jax told her she was adopted. They asked her if she wanted to know who her birth mother was and she said no.  The story ends up taking place when Ari is 16.  She finally asks Carly about her real mother.       I need a good Spinelli nickname for Arianna. I'm writing this so that he is her best friend.  Any suggestions would work.  Remember, he knows she was adopted but doesn't know that Claudia is her mother

It's left things in conditions known as havoc of noobs. Note: Noobs is a term to describe persons who are new to a certain program. I have not been on Yahoo Answers for a long while now. It has come to my attention that some of the old regs have either deceased or have stopped coming. I do not know if or when I will come back to Yahoo Answers again. You'll either see me, or you won't.      Q1: What major animes have been through a holocaust?      Q2: If you had the chance to create your own anime, what would you name it?      Q3: It has come to my attention that anime creators create animated females to have large breasts. Is this because anime creators are perverted? x]      Q4: I believe that anime graphics are becoming degrated. They look aweful. What is your opinion?      Q5: Which Anime would you prefer to go through a holocaust?      I am finished. Have fun. Or not. I don't really care.

20090306212042AAbp1ub	Entertainment & Music;Polls & Surveys	Was this wrong out of my friends and me?	ok; a few days ago (im in the 10th grade). my school had this big thing on hiv/aids. they had this guest speaker come in, and he had aids. he also told us that he had unprotected sex with his boyfriend. well alot of people in my school just hate gay people, i'm not one of them though. and when he told us that he was gay my friends and i jumped back real fast. then he told us that he has aids, and while he said that he passed out papers. but when they came around to us, we didn't want to touch them. i know you can't get aids just from touching something they touched, but i guess it was just the thought of him having it. my friend took the papers but holding her hoodie down over them, so that she couldn't touch them. i just sat there and pushed my seat back and said that i wasen't touching them. so she threw the papers real fast, and we all busted out laughing. now i feel really bad, because he saw us laughing. oh my gosh, what should i do?
20090227085745AAGQLJk	Entertainment & Music;Music;Lyrics	Hey you guys how do you like these lyrics?	They are for a metalcore/melodic metal core song my band might work on. It's about finding solace within your home and the security about being alone. Its also about not needing others to help you when you are well enough to do it yourself.         "Behind These Four Walls"      Never did I think,   That everything was about to close on me,   That I could find some help, some closure,   A place that I could call my own,      I set a goal,   To never ask for help, From you,   Even when I’m left for dead,   I will never rely on your defending,   I will never ask for your protection,      You still tell me “You need my help”,    “You won’t make it without me”,   I said thanks when I took those words,    I put them in the ground,   In the ground just like everything else,   That slipped from your mind,      I think I found some closure,   I think I found security,   I know now what I needed,   I found this all behind these four walls,   The walls to be alone,   The walls I call my home,

You may be gone   but the power of your dreams is not done   and its   holding on to your dreams    and acheiving your dreams that will keep a smile on my face everyday and everynight---alright      so ya...there u go that song is called SMILING ALL DAY      u see hannah was different than others and she had amazing dreams to help other people and she was just amaziNG! we started an organization in her memory and help kids in other countries cause it was her dream to help them. so thats what i  mean when i say "acheiving your dreams" in the song!      thanx for reading this and remember plz be nice      i want ur true opinion but dont be rude

You hardly notice the progression   As you’re going blind.   A world of color slowly halts   And gives away to shades   Of black and gray,   Love what you may,   The beauty always fades.       Chorus:   Take this winter away,   Strangled in its gray,   Why won’t these pieces …   Fit…   Like…   All of our previous days?   Come whatever may,   Got nothing to say,   In tides of time,   New memories    Have washed your face away…      Blowing dust off of a box   And smiling through my tears   The world just seems so simple   When a box can retain years   So fragile and so broken    And so irreplaceable   Almost as if we’d spoken   Something irretraceable.       (Chorus)      It’s when…   The wind cuts into my skin…   That I remember you,   Down and out, time and time and time again   The memories turn blue…   I’m confined,   But I’m just fine,   Leave me to reflect in rhyme…      (Chorus)         Feeling this. Feeling this.   Like I’ve never felt anything before.   Killing this, killing this.    And leaving the body at my door.   With all said and done, I have nothing to say,   In tides of time, new memories have washed your face away.      I already posted this but i needed more opinions!!   Any suggestions, criticisms, bashes, praise, etc are welcome!!

20090306210231AAkiAnH	Entertainment & Music;Polls & Surveys	PLEASE HELP!!!!!!!! I need an answer?	I am writing a book with my best friend and we have come across a dilemma. One of our main characters is going to get married to another one and we can't decide who. The two people are Katie and Ali. Don is the one that one of the two have to marry. Here are the stories.      Katie and Don went out when they were teenagers for a short time, but Don was really immature and they broke up. Both of them still liked each other but Don kept nagging Katie and messing things up. But they are pretty much in love in a kind of love/hate way.      Ali and Don met when they were about 15 as friends and then 4 years later they met again and it turned out they had heaps in common. After a while they started to date and really liked each other. And they got on really well.      If Katie marries Don, then Ali won't be in the story much and Don and Ali's kids (who we have kind of created already) won't exist.       If Ali and Don get married then Katie, who is one of the main characters, will be sad and die alone. She will also fade from the story.       Please help, give us an answer- Katie or Ali, and a reason for your answer. Thanks in advance!! Please!

"ADJUSTING TO MARRIED LIFE"         This couple has only been married for two weeks.  The husband, although very much in love, can't wait to go out into town and party with his old buddies.   He says to his new wife, "Honey, I'll be right back..."      "Where are you going coochy coo...?" asked the wife.   "I'm going to the bar, pretty face.  I'm going to have a   beer."      The wife says to him, "You want a beer, my love?"  Then she opens the door to the refrigerator and shows him 25 different kinds of beer brands from 12 different countries: Germany, Holland, Japan, India, etc.      The husband doesn't know what to do, and the only thing that he can think of saying is, "Yes, loolie loolie... but the bar... you know... the frozen glass..."      He doesn't get to finish the sentence, when thewife interrupts him by saying, "You want a frozen glass, puppy face?"   She takes a huge beer mug out of the freezer so frozen that she is getting the chills holding it.      The husband, looking a bit pale, says, "Yes, tootsie roll, but at   the bar they have those hors d'oeuvres that are really delicious... I won't be long.  I'll be right back. I promise. OK?"      "You want hors d'oeuvres, poochi pooh?" She opens the oven and takes out 15 dishes of different hors d'oeuvres: buffalo wings, nachos mushroom caps, chicken strips, etc.      "But sweet honey... at the bar... you know... the swearing, the   dirty words and all that..."      "You want dirty words, cutie pie?...   DRINK YOUR ******* BEER IN YOUR FROZEN ******* MUG AND EAT YOUR ******* DAMN SNACKS BECAUSE YOU AREN'T GOING ANYWHERE!! GOT IT ASSHOLE?!!"

20090306212252AA4FS67	Entertainment & Music;Music;Lyrics	Everyone's a critic, but are you any good at it?	Seriously, I've seen several people post lyrics looking for feedback, and yes the lyrics are relatively unimaginative, but so are most of the responses from people who think they have the authority to judge creativity. It's to the point that the replies are more cliche than the lyrical ideas when the only criticism is simply "It's so cliche." As the Flight of the Conchords would say. Why? Why? Be more constructive with your feedback!      So here's my question, do you do this? Has this been done to you? Are you one of the few worthwhile critics who can actually point out specific problems or at least show someone how not to be trite? Do such critics exist in this forum?

20090306200808AARL5xz	Entertainment & Music;Horoscopes	Ignoring a scorpio woman? good idea?	I'm a taurus and I like this scorpio woman. We have locked eyes with incredible intensity many times but we can't break the ice. I'm an above average good looking guy. She is not really my type but since we are polar opposites in the Zodiac I'm drawn to her and I know she is very drawn to me. For one month already we have being playing the intense eye gazing game but I'm tired of it. I have started ignoring her and not gazing at her anymore for about a week. I have noticed she is affected by it and she started doing the same thing. I can't really break the ice myself and she knows that and the reason so me breaking the ice is out of the question. Any thoughts? what will she do? we have ever said any words to each other. The feeling is just too intense and overwhelming from my side and her side also I know it. How should I approach it? women find me attractive. Should I let her see me talking to other women as well? I have my hands tied about myself breaking the ice and saying something to her. All she has to do is say one word to me and I will do the rest. Any good input people? Thank you.

20090306204324AA8L0iO	Entertainment & Music;Polls & Surveys	Ash's pikachu:  Level: 60 or 70 nature: Rash agree or disagree?	Pikachu cannot be level 100 even if we'd all like it to be. and besides, in the anime, (episode 9) one of the characters states that his pikachu should be at level 25 after being with it for 2 months, which indicates that levels come slower in the anime then in the games, and also that levels ARE present in the anime, just not the focal point.   My belief that Pikachu has a rash nature is for a couple of reasons:    1: Ash sometimes acts rashly and Pikachu has adopted many of his mannerisms.   2: Rash is a nature that increases special attack over special defense, and its clear that Pikachu's defenses are fragile since it has lost a few times, and would help to explain his high attack power.   3: Take away the R in rash and you got ash. I find that interesting   4: Although Pikachu seems naive sometimes, hes not really all that naive. Brave, yes, but a brave nature is terrible on a pikachu, and since pikachu is very speedy, I don't believe it would make sense for pikachu to be that fast and have a brave nature, even though he is an anomaly.       What i want to know is if anyone agrees or disagrees. If you disagree, please explain why.

20090306215153AAJDcJF	Entertainment & Music;Polls & Surveys	When many constantly question your orientation just because you're single, and it's REALLY ticking you off?	Should you just make up a story about having a boyfriend?      I'm a fourth year college student. I have been asked so many times why I don't I have a boyfriend by this point in my life, and honestly it's because I could never find a guy who is interested in me as a person and not me as another body. I have many goals (but--ironically--many of these goals are to learn more skills concerning crafts, cooking, gardening, etc.) and pursue them actively.      Other people don't ask initially, but they treat you differently after they know you're single. Then, later on, you learn that they asked someone else if you're homosexual. I know I'm not the most feminine-looking person out there: I enjoy things such as hiking and many times I'm miles away from dresses and perfume. And, just generally, I don't have a petite figure. But it's really irritating to be judged based on appearance.      So, I'm waiting for the right guy, I've heard there are some out there. But, I really am getting close to screaming at the next person who asks me if I'm lesbian just because I'm single. Just because I've waited for so long.      Any thoughts?

When i see a sharp or flat i use the nearest finger to play that key (treat them as accidental note). This way i can focus more on the melody and composition.    If i have to play chords, i may have to memorize the fingering for all the popular chords.   So i dont feel the need to learn fingering for scales other than C, to play melody.   Can you please justify the need to play scales in other keys.

20090227094636AAKICta	Entertainment & Music;Music;Rock and Pop	What are some of the worst songs put out during the 80s?	I admit it. I love the 80s, and I miss a lot of the music that was put out during that decade. However, I also remember that there was some really lousy stuff that was put out then.

20090227100254AALGDe5	Entertainment & Music;Comics & Animation	What is the extent of Orihime's power?	At first when I woke up to read this week's chapter of Bleach I figured when Ichigo was on the brink of death she would risk her life and be killed. Then I thought about her time reversal type of power and just pondered for a while. I have decided that theoretically she may be able to reverse things on such a scale no one has ever fathomed. Aizen figured her powers were limited to reverse small things but what if she has a Green Lantern type of power that is derived from her will. If she will something back into existence then why can't she will something to not exist at all or just reverse time according to here desire. I think its a trumph card for her and may be the key to killing Ulquiorra.
