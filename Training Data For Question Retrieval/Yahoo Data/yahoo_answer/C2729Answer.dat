gjwmDNNWaa	Well, my cats used to do that. I asked my vet and he said to make sure the litter box is always clean and fresh. If there is one room that she always goes in, put a littler box in that room. You might also be feeding her too much. Is the older one used to the younger one? My cats did that but not any more.|`|cbaed0814556c039d6513bbe51d35768aa	There may be a dominance issue, but it is more unlikely than likely considering that the mom was not encroached by a stranger, but is living with her own baby.  Females seem to get along better than males (but not always).  Perhaps there need to be more litter boxes.  Many cats are very festidious and most don't like to even poop in the same box they whiz in, they do if they have to, and again some won't accept the situation at all.  Major thing to try is to keep litter boxes ultra clean and provide 4 boxes for the two cats.  I have a multi cat household and I have one cat that will only use a hooded box, another that will not use the box if it has one urine spot in it or one turd-it will go outside, right outside the box-like it is leaving you a hint.  For that problem you get a kitty mat to go outside the box and you keep it really clean...ALL the time.  I have another cat that will only dump in one box and uses a different box for urination.  However, it may just be a protest because they don't get along.  Some cats don't all so well but usually most do.  If it personalities-go to Petco and buy a pheremone attomizer-it gives out happy pheremones to help getting along.  The first thing tho to try is cleaner boxes and more of them-4 boxes.  Be aware too there are some great ones out there at pet centers.  Some have cubbies at the end to put scoups in, some auto-clean, others help you to sift using a hidden screen, and still others-like mine have built-in into their construction antimicrobials that stop the growth of germs and mold etc in the box-healthier for your cats, and some of those-like mine can be purchased in jumbo size which all of the cats prefer, and some even have a high half hood almost, which helps kitties when they get too close to the edge and overspray or poop over the edge and the boxes are not expensive.  Mine were $10 each.  The most likely source of the problem is that cats are very clean and they need you to keep the litter cleaner and provide multiple boxes.  Pheremones will usually ease the attitude if that is it.  Some kitties poop about because of being nervous or upset but most because the box is not clean to their standards.  Unclean boxes can cause killing coccidia, urinary tract infections and a host of kitty diseases so keep them ultra clean or you may incur huge vet bills and even lose your kitty.  Kitty diseases can become fatal to a cat very quickly.  Their time is much faster than our time.  If it were they same they would live to be 100 too.  Lastly, if there is poop there is probably urine that is not in the box too, you just haven't smelled it yet, most likely...but maybe not.  And-anywhere kitties do their jobs once, they have good noses and are likely to do it again once it has started.  If you want to stop that, scrub the spots with white vinegar and never with bleach.  Bleach has amonia in it and so does urine, they won't know the difference and will go there again, so use white vinegar and then spray the spots with scat or a similar pet product that wards the animal away from those spots so they will go back to the litter boxes. Only if you have done all that and poop continues outside the box, which will be unlikely, then you have a habit to break or dissatisfaction.<br>  The habit can only be addressed by catching the culprit red handed so to speak and then you lock them in a very small pantry or bathroom with fresh food, water and litter daily...and very little room to poop anywhere but the box.  That generally takes about 2 weeks to sink in and form a new habit-2 weeks in the small room, but be very sure you are cleaning, watering and feeding daily.|`|KRXo2hJvaa	maybe you should follow them to see who is doing it? and i think that the mom wants her baby to grow up and leave her alone , so maybe your younger one is doing it coz her mom is not letting her stay in her territory, maybe you should consider putting a second litter box.<br>  |`|GMIEyImoaa	Maybe they don't want to share a litter box I have heard of this before.Fighting? maybe one is getting more attention then the other one,they do act like kids sometimes if you know what I mean.

4b045bed7aeb597819a17cafdaf98978aa	It has to be something to do with his digestive system.  I'm sorry I can't tell you what, exactly.  My Mom has two cats that would let out the most AWFUL ....um, gas...for about the first year of their lives (brother and sister cats, previously homeless found under a dumpster).  We assumed that their "systems" were a little messed up having been homeless.  They are now 7 years old and there is no rotten egg smell problem at all!  You mentioned yours had a cold and was vomiting, too....but has gotten better.  I would just keep an eye on him...make sure he's getting plenty to drink and eat, and that he is using the litter box enough.  You could call a vet for advice, and maybe if you don't see an improvement within the next few days...take him in  to be looked at.  Good luck!<br>  <br>  P.S.

iasOicRjaa	They don't ponder the meaning of life or anything but to put it simply yes they can think. Dogs are mostly reactive but do have some thought processes and are able to problem solve on the most primitive level...some are smarter than others. One of my dogs can jump the fence...the other couldn't jump the fence but figured out he CAN climb the tree and then jump the fence. Thats just one example...dogs learn to dig, to bark or do cute tricks to get a desired reaction etc. They also evaluate situations and think SAFE or UNSAFE but it doesn't go much beyond the simple stuff :-)|`|UyAGXNCsaa	Absolutely.  But not like humans do.  Dogs can read our "energy".  It's something I feel very strongly about.  I even tried experiments at home, which confirmed it.  Try thinking about going on a walk without the leash in hand, and see what your dog does.  When you're sick, your dog knows - how? Because of your energy.  Trust me, it's very true indeed.|`|mfXDUkRYaa	Dogs definitely have thoughts, otherwise they'd be zombies and never do anything. They understand people insofar as they can pick up things we say and do through consequence.|`|oChOlCqYaa	If you have ever seen a guide dog, herding dog, or any other working or service dog you wouldn't have to ask this. Many dogs have great problem-solving skills and are able to understand a great deal of human  non-verbal communication, as well as verbal commands, while they constantly monitor their surroundings. <br>  <br>  For example- I got Westley a new toy, a tug-a-jug. In only a short time, he figured out that to get the kibbles out of it easily, he could prop it up against a pile of clothes on the floor.

If its no longer there I'm sure you don't have to worry about it, out of sight out of mind. Its not likely it crawled out the holes, it probably fled the enclosure at the first opportunity, maybe even when you opened the window|`|Jl6a1fxzaa	See, spiders are actually Jewish ninjas who can bend their bodies to fit into severely small spaces, including the pores on your skin.  Just watch for any crumbs from bagels as that is the only sign that the spiders are about to attack.

H06PtiIAaa	like i told you in another answer.<br>  <br>  1 in per gallon rule isnt a rule more of a guidline, that is byfar out dated.<br>  <br>  because BECAUSE people dont understand that fish size is different from what they are now and what they can be.<br>  <br>  Also<br>  <br>  larger fish it doesnt work, as a 36 inch arowana in a 36 gallon tank... physically doesnt work.<br>  <br>  So stocking rules generally dont work.|`|h4wNRqf9aa	it's crap and has been since they came up with it in the 70's|`|BMri9tITaa	I find it to be a good general rule for fish under 3 inches long, more an approximation than anything else, which you can fudge a bit, especially for schooling fish, but over 3 inches, it's more just a bunch of research, research, research.<br>  <br>  That's how much you can fit; you still have to figure out if they can stand to be with each other in an enclosed space.|`|PXZ8jxiGaa	I don't believe in that rule, because larger fish need exponentially larger tanks, unlike small schools of fish. In general this rule is a good guideline for beginners though, so they don't horribly overstock their tanks, more experience people, should already know their fish's requirements.|`|ZYzhBhgJaa	I think it's a suitable guideline for beginners who are looking to get smaller, more peaceful fish. As long as the beginner understands that the guideline applies to the length the fish will be when full grown, not what they are now. The exact science of how many fish per tank is something you learn as you go, I did. When I got my 1st tank 11 yrs ago, that was what the petstore told me, that's what I went by, and my tanks were fine. As I started to get into other fish, like Oscars, African cichlids, etc, you learn that is not true. With larger or more agressive fish, they need more space, with smaller schooling fish, you can have a few more. I started off buying mollies, platys, guppys & neons, and for those fish, the rule suited me as a newby.|`|oJoYk2Ataa	It really depends on the body mass and waste produced. Some fish are bigger when compared to height or width/produce a lot more waste. 1 in/fish is like putting 4 oscars in a 55g tank o.O<br>  <br>  xDDDD

daefJTPGaa	Is he giving you dead things or toys?<br>  <br>  Your cat is probably feeling lonely or abandoned since your father left town. Cats don't like much change, and he probably is trying to get your attention by leaving you presents. Try giving him lots of exercise and attention until your father gets back; that should help reduce his loneliness and anxiety.<br>  <br>  Like I said, when a cat brings dead animals (or a toy) and leaves them for you they are like a gift. The cat is proving that he can catch the animals, sort of like a trophy. Just thank him for it and, if it's  dead animal, remember to dispose of the prey properly. If him bringing in dead animals becomes a real problem, consider letting him outside less.|`|AA11015395	My be the cat is trying very hard to make friends with you by butting the toys by your door the cat is asking you to please play, there is more ways to show a cat you love them and playing is number 1 on a cats mine, plus that's one of there ways of showing there love for you.Don't be mean by kicking the cats toys away from your door try playing with the cat. Cats have feeling too and they also hurt just like people. and they do become a part of our family there heart and soul comes with them.|`|iFJZ9fFVaa	He miss's him and wants to play-play.<br>  <br>  :D|`|b3ZLY5osaa	maybe he wants you to play with him, so cute though|`|d70af5b97c8e2c9b3cd22bb36a58c59caa	Your cat recognizes you as the "next in line" for chain of command.  In other words, with your father gone or away, your cat sees you as being the new alpha-male, or top-cat in the home.  Cats typically bring toys or dead animals to their owners or "masters" as a sign of respect, admiration, obediance, offoratory, or affection.  This is all your cat is doing, is subtely acknowledging you are in charge.|`|ExVhN1Uwaa	yeah it should be obvious that he wants you to play with him not just pet him. be lucky a cat wants to play. most of them will just ignore you untill they want food
H06PtiIAaa	way to many ifhs for a 20 gallon.<br>  <br>  Angelfish dont belong in a 20 gallon, they get large and need high tanks. at least 55 gallons.<br>  <br>  The 10 is overstocked, i wouldnt get that many danios, but it can be done with regular water changes and a good HOB filter.<br>  <br>  the 20 without hte angels is pushing it with the raphael cat that can get large.<br>  <br>  But cut the angelfis hfrom the 20 and it should be ok.|`|QxJVD1Flaa	10 gallon is stocked at the absolute max. <br>  <br>  the 20 gallon setup, would work, but 2-3 angels part would not.

You could have all but the angels, or 2 angels in a 20 gallon tank.|`|oJoYk2Ataa	10 Gallon:Male bettas are aggressive, bad idea to mix with your other fish. Seems a little bit overcrowded but should be fine if you take care of it :D<br>  <br>  20 Gallon: Angels grow pretty tall height-wise, most people recommend a 29 gallon for them. Also, they're cichlids and may be a bit aggressive to smaller fish like neon tetras.|`|Jis9ipcNaa	The ten gallon, heavens no! Maybe the cories because they like to school, but you want to 6 more fish to a ten gallon! I say nay. You're going to kill your bioload.

vXnRz8ggaa	A lot of people have issues with their dogs mounting each other. One thing you can do is to try having a water bottle around the house and every time he mounts her or even does something bad you can spray him with the water - make sure the bottle isn't on mist mode though, that doesn't do much. <br>  Good Luck. =)|`|3c49a0964bbe36e70dcf40e56a9d58d6aa	"Mounting" in animals is sometimes  a sign of dominance.  Your schnauzer is probably showing her that he's the alpha dog by doing that to her.  Unfortunately, I'm not sure how you would correct this behavior.  I would start by asking your vet for some advice or google the behavior and see what some other trainers are saying.|`|lTsDwY9Paa	He's not trying to mate, he's trying to show her that he's dominant over her. Leave them alone to figure it out. They're both fixed so nothing can happen. Also the crate should NEVER be used as punishment.|`|ft6hKc6Vaa	This is certainly a dominance assertion issue.  I agree completely with the person who said to leave them alone to figure it out between them (unless it turns into a full-blown fight, which it probably will not).  Strange as it may sound, females will also "hump" to show dominance.<br>  <br>  Once this little drama plays out between them, and they have clearly established between them just exactly who is higher in the "pack order" of your home, the humping will go away.  It is more a behavior to ESTABLISH dominance and not to constantly display it.|`|41c28e73f9b063aa3838e17f7834ec97aa	It could be a dominace issue.  If they are both altered it really isn't a problem, but you could always invest in a belly band for your male.
769068c691176f6c9fe4154f357e813caa	I'm so sorry you lost Brandon.  Please know that what you are feeling and going through is normal.  Your grieving process may take weeks, months or even years.  Take your mother up on her offer and go talk to her.  We mothers care more about our children than we do sleeping!!<br>  <br>  Also, one idea that might help you feel better is to create a free, virtual living memorial for Brandon.  Check out this site and see what you think.  <a href="http://www.peternity.com/index.php?action=showContent&contentId=6" rel="nofollow">http://www.peternity.com/index.php?actio...</a>  I know that it's helped me when I've lost a beloved furry family member.|`|nQdGGBN4aa	Brandon is now at the Rainbow Bridge where he will wait for you to join him.<br>  <br>  He is now what we call a GA - as in Guardian Angel.<br>  <br>  When we refer to a GA by name, we say it as Brandon(GA)<br>  <br>  The Rainbow Bridge is a wonderful place where he will be completely healthy, the kidney failure will be gone, he will have the strength and energy of a kitten.<br>  <br>  There will always be exactly the type of food he wants whenever he is hungry.<br>  <br>  There will be catnip all over the place and he can roll and roll in it to his heart's content.<br>  <br>  There are places where he can sleep in the sun or sit and watch birds at their bird feeders.<br>  <br>  He misses you but he knows that you will join him eventually.<br>  <br>  There are other cats to play with and feathers to chase and pounce on.<br>  <br>  His favorite toys are there and he has everything he wants - but for one thing -- You!<br>  <br>  There are humans there who will let him sleep on their laps and who will scratch his ears and rub his head.<br>  <br>  He knows he will see you again and is content to wait for  you.<br>  <br>  I know that the Rainbow Bridge is a wonderful place because my wife and I have 10 cats there <br>  <br>  ....... I'm starting to cry myself.....<br>  <br>  I bet that our Simon(GA) has meet Brandon and showed him around.<br>  <br>  Our Marco(GA) probably checked to see Brandon likes to play "chase me" and I know that our Tom(GA) met him when he arrived - Tom(GA) always rushed to the door to meet people when they came to our house.<br>  <br>  You should have seen him on Halloween. Every time the door bell rang he'd rush to the door and get on the chair next to the door and lean over to see who was at the door.<br>  <br>  I know all of this about the Rainbow Bridge because our GAs, particularly Simon(GA), often visit me in my dreams. People say they are only dreams but I know better - GAs are able to reach us while we dream and they visit quite often.<br>  <br>  You can read more about the Rainbow Bridge at our page about it at <a href="http://sugarcat_simon.home.att.net/rainbowb.html" rel="nofollow">http://sugarcat_simon.home.att.net/rainb...</a><br>  <br>  I know you hurt right now, I understand completely - Brandon was a part of your life since you were only 5 years old.<br>  <br>  I bet he was a great cat - right?<br>  <br>  When a cat gets sick and slowly declines there is at least some time to prepare for the end - but there really never is enough time to prepare for the loss of a good friend.<br>  <br>  When it happens suddenly it hits you so hard you think you'll never recover.<br>  <br>  You will! I promise. It will take a long time but one day you'll be able to think about some particular great time you two had together for at least a few minutes before the pain of your loss overwhelms you.<br>  <br>  I am serious when I say I know what you are going through.<br>  <br>  When Marco(GA) died - he was killed by a hit and run driver who left him laying in the middle of the road - I thought we thought we'd never recover from the crippling pain.<br>  <br>  But we did!<br>  <br>  I remember a couple of days after he was killed when I went to the store. I hadn't been anywhere since his death, this was the first time I'd been away from the house since he was killed.<br>  <br>  I remember stepping out of the car at the store and having an anxiety attack.<br>  <br>  My heart was pounding so hard that I thought anyone around me could hear it.<br>  <br>  I went into the store and there were all these people going about their day to day lives as though nothing had happened.<br>  <br>  I wanted to scream at them "Don't you know that Marco is gone!"<br>  <br>  I moved like I was in a trance, I got what I wanted, checked out, almost ran to the car, and drove home.<br>  <br>  Once I got inside I sat down and cried for a very long time.<br>  <br>  How could everyone be acting like nothing had happened? Why weren't they all in mourning for Marco(GA).<br>  <br>  Perhaps you could go in and talk to your mom for just a few minutes. <br>  <br>  Might it help if you slept in her bed with her tonight?<br>  <br>  I know that a 12 1/2 year old young lady is beyond the point where she runs to her mom's bed but perhaps just this once you could forget about being a grown up 12 1/2 years old and sleep with her - maybe?<br>  <br>  If not, look for something to do that might at least distract you for a while - did you finish you homework?<br>  <br>  Please believe it will get better. Day by day, week  by week, you'll be able to remember all of the good times with Brandon - and I bet you had a lot of them - without the pain of his loss hitting you right in the stomach.<br>  <br>  I should hear from one of GAs tonight, they always seem to know when they should be in touch with me. I'll have them look up Brandon(GA), if they haven't already, and ask them to make sure he has settled in and that he understands that he will see you again.<br>  <br>  It may be a long time but the Rainbow Bridge is a magical place and time can pass very quickly there.<br>  <br>  If I were with you right now, I'd tell you all about our GAs and have you tell me all about Brandon(GA)<br>  <br>  Like the time that Simon(GA) and I were playing with a piece of rope. Simon(GA) grabbed the end of it and took off down the hall at full speed. The rope was about 10 feet long and when he got as far as it would let him go he did a complete backwards somersault!<br>  <br>  He didn't get pulled to one side or another - he did a perfect back flip.<br>  <br>  My wife didn't see it and I have wished ever since that I had gotten it on video tape. You should have seen it.<br>  <br>  When Simon(GA) landed back on his feet, he turned and looked at me as though to say "Hey, I planned it that way, of course."<br>  <br>  Actually I think he was thinking "What the h... was that?"<br>  <br>  Then there was the time that Simon(GA) was sleeping next to me one morning. I woke up and reached down and scratched his head. He woke up and stretched out - problem was, his feet were against me and when he stretched out he pushed himself right off the bed.<br>  <br>  The look on his face as he disappeared over the side of the bed was priceless. His eyes were wide and you could almost hear him say "What...........?" as he went over the edge of the bed.<br>  <br>  He just managed to land on his feet. He jumped right back up on the bed and laid down next to me again as though nothing had happened.<br>  <br>  What funny things do you remember about Brandon(GA)? I bet you and he had some really great times.<br>  <br>  I can't make your pain go away but I hope you can make it through tonight, and then tomorrow and then each day as the pain gradually become less severe.<br>  <br>  It will never completely go away, look at me, Tom(GA) died on January 22, 2001 and I still cried when I told you about him earlier.<br>  <br>  Maybe you won't understand this right now but you will eventually -- there is a reason that it is good for the pain to never go away completely.<br>  <br>  Life being what it is, pain and love go hand in hand.<br>  <br>  You loved Brandon(GA) and his loss will always cause you pain. The pain will not be what it is today but it will always be there - a tiny bit.<br>  <br>  For without the pain of loss, love can never be true.<br>  <br>  To be able to think about Brandon without at least a little pain would mean that you've lost a bit of the love you have for him.<br>  <br>  Hey - here you are in pain and I'm going on about how it will never completely go away. Pretty stupid thing to say - right?<br>  <br>  You job for right now is to make it through tonight with as little pain as possible. The way to do that is to do something to keep you occupied, if just for a while.<br>  <br>  Go read about the Rainbow Bridge at the link I gave you above. Do a Google search on: Rainbow Bridge and read the other pages you find.<br>  <br>  Go read our site on feline diabetes at <a href="http://sugarcat_simon.home.att.net" rel="nofollow">http://sugarcat_simon.home.att.net</a> - it is at least something to do.<br>  <br>  Hey - like I asked before, did you do your homework? If not, that's something to keep you busy for a while.<br>  <br>  I wish I could erase your pain but that's not possible. All I really can do is tell you that the pain will ease and you'll be able to think more and more about him without the pain crippling you.<br>  <br>  Hope this helps a bit.<br>  <br>  Bob|`|GgNfqm5saa	do you have any friends, maybe you can talk to them. when i'm upset i just go to my friends they are always there for me.
OyNJTWaiaa	He most likely has caught his toe on something in the cage and bruised it. Unless he is having trouble standing or getting around the cage he should be fine.|`|GTKXq7A1aa	he got his toe caught<br>  its ok|`|T99QygpKaa	It could be a bruising, or it could be broken. It could also be that there is not enough blood flow getting to that part of his toe and as a result of this, it turns purple or blue..<br>  <br>  Can he use his toe? If so, then it is bruised. If he cant use it, then it might be broken.<br>  <br>  I would suggest taking him to an "Avian Vet" because if you go to a normal vet, they will just refer you to an avian vet in any case because normal vets do not specialize in birds.<br>  <br>  The vet will then be able to give you a proper diagnosis of what is wrong, and hopefully be able to solve the problem for you. Do not leave it untreated, because bruising, not enough blood flow, and a broken limb could cause gangreen if its left untreated for long enough in some cases (although not all)!<br>  <br>  Just relax, if you panic, you will make your bird nervous.

UE4WbmtQaa	The akita is a very acitve dog and will need lots of excercise and attention devoted to it. The akita is careful and very affectionate with its family. Sometimes spontaneous, it needs a firm, confident, consistent pack leader. Without it the dog will be very willful and may become very aggressive to other dogs and animals. It needs firm training as a puppy. The Akita is a first class guard dog. Japanese mothers would often leave their children in the family Akita's care. They are extremely faithful and thrive on firm leadership from their handlers. Though it should definitely be supervised with other household pets and children.|`|00ddc7f7cc561904db032288ec417cc6aa	They can be good with children if socialized at a young age. This is a powerful breed and needs a strong and firm pack leader. Training and socialization is a must for this breed even more if you often have guests and their dogs over to your home. Just like with any dog no young child should ever be left unsupervised even if one feels the dog is jus the most docile and gentle creature.  They do require daily exercise both physical and mental so they probably would be a good choice for an active household.  They aren’t really water dogs so whether one likes or enjoys swimming is probably based on that dog. They are highly intelligent but tend to bore easily  so any training sessions should be short and will require patients. <br>  <br>  Again they can be dominate they need a strong pack leader or they will step up to the plate and or try and dethrone you from the top position.  <br>  <br>  This are good loyal dogs who are protective of their family and they don’t typical bark unless they have a reason.

I love the breed but I do not recommend them to a lot of people.|`|NvtetB2laa	Akitas are generally good family dogs. They're not good around other dogs, especially same-sex ones. They tend to kill small animals. It takes patience to train one, since they get bored with repetition. They will chase a ball a few times and then ignore it, especially when they mature.<br>  <br>  An off-leash Akita in public is a very bad idea. They may get into fights, run off, or do something else undesirable. <br>  <br>  Sounds like you need another breed, like a Lab or Golden.|`|6098ebd9c2c175997bc815b09ad17e01aa	<a href="http://www.akitas.org/aktemp.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.akitas.org/aktemp.html</a>|`|hBiSNoE7aa	A lot of this depends on the way the puppy was raised and how you raise it. Plus the genetics of the parents: if they are good learners, your puppy would be too. If the parents have a bad temperament however, beware. Some behavior problems stem from genetic defects, generally, in dogs. My cousins have one and he is a strong energetic people-loving dog, but kind of a dufus. You should observe the puppies and interact with them before you pick one. If you get a full-grown dog, then have a temperament test performed by a behaviorist and ask lots of questions.

Keep them separated when you are not at home to watch them. Also,why do you let your cats outside? Most rescues discourage people from letting cats live outside because of the many dangers to outside cats.|`|769068c691176f6c9fe4154f357e813caa	This is not rabies.

UW9Trvrpaa	Dogs in general will get attached not to the person who it spends the most time with, but the person who cares about it the most. They will get attached to those who feed it, train it, spend time with it (talking, playing).|`|1WmDOPGtaa	Same as any dog: The person who feeds, trains, exercises, and grooms it.  In short, the person who puts the most into caring for the dog.  <br>  <br>  There are times when a dog will have an "absence makes the heart grow fonder mentality," and seem to cling to the person in the house who is there the least.

He was attached to me, but also really liked my mother, and when there was thunder, he liked anyone who could protect him from the terrible, booming terror. :o)<br>  <br>  A lot of it is training and environment.  When I first got my dog, he would not let anyone unfamiliar touch him, and would bite.  As time went on, and I made it clear to him that he was not the boss, and he learned to tolerate strangers.  <br>  Finally, he realized that my Papillion mix (who loved everyone) would get all the attention if he was aloof, so he became very friendly to everyone.
769068c691176f6c9fe4154f357e813caa	A cat's butt is very sensitive. There are a lot of nerve endings in that part of their body. Petting or scratching the cat there is very stimulating and your cat "leans into it" by raising his rump to get more of what feels so good.

Convicts are very aggressive and I've seen pictures of a few fish 3 times their size hiding at one side of a tank because a pair of convicts were protecting their fry :D|`|fkYJHmkhaa	My best suggestion would be to get a pair of German blue rams or apistogramma with a bunch of schooling fish like neons or glowlite tetras.  Thyere not huge fish but they can get to be about 3 inches long.  Theyre really pretty fish and are relatively peaceful for dwarf cichlids :)|`|T1LdAIabaa	If you want a large fish 1 angelfish would work in a 30g.  I dont think you would be able to put anything else in there.  angels get rather large and will eat any smaller fish<br>  <br>  maybe a ropefish|`|Ywr05G7Laa	ok maybe these arent big fishes fishes bt ull have alot of them every month ge platys they reproduce and have alot of babys they are livebreeders|`|MPQI8Bg3aa	Rainbow fish grow to be about 4 inches long, but are a nice peaceful fish. There are many different varieties all with different colors, but a similar body shape.
AA10288031	There can be several reasons that a hedgehog would bite you. You may have been bugging him or doing something that scared him, so he bit to protect himself. You might have had something on your fingers that smelled like food, so he was taking a nip to see if it tasted nice, too. Or he may have learned that biting gets him put back in his cage.<br>  For the first one, if your hedgehog's new to you, he might be scared because he doesn't know you and doesn't know that you're a friend. You may be going too fast with the bonding process. Try just holding him in your lap on a blanket, maybe with part of the blanket over him. Don't try touching him, just let him sit quietly and fall asleep if he wants to. He will slowly get to know your scent this way and start to relax around you. If you have a younger hedgehog, he may be quilling, which is painful. If you're trying to pet him, he may have bitten you because it hurts when you press down on his sore skin. Also, try to keep your fingers away from his nose/mouth while you're handling him so that he doesn't see something strange coming towards his face. <br>  For the second scenario, make sure that you wash your hands before you take your hedgehog out. If you're handfeeding treats, you may want to just put the treat down in front of the hedgehog instead of letting him take it from your fingers. They can't see well and he may mistake your finger for another treat.<br>  For the last one, make sure that you don't put your hedgehog back into his cage right after he's bitten you. If he does bite you again, blow gently into his face to discourage the behavior. Hopefully, he'll learn to stop biting soon.|`|44kEtDvIaa	You have to find the reason for it biting, and there will always be one.  Was he communicating?  Scared?  Hard bite, or just a little nip to get your attention?  They will test things with their mouths, so a small nip can be him checking you out.  You could have even had something like soap residue on your hands that triggered it.  Unless it's something that goes on all the time and is progressively getting worse, there shouldn't be anything to worry about.  See site below for more info and links on hedgehogs.
niztxto9aa	You should feed your snake an appropriate sized prey item once every 7-10 days. I let my snakes sit for about 24 hrs before handling them. If their is still a significant lump in their bodies, better make it 48 hrs.|`|Wn3LGHTvaa	Your snake will live longer if you don't handle it at all, except to remove it for cage cleaning.|`|80vFuZrqaa	my brother feeds his corn snake about once a week  and he does really great.and wait at least a day befor you handle the snake as it might make him sick.|`|UEMfqBpEaa	i feed mine about once every 8-9 days, usually he takes around 30 - 40 hours till i can touch him again, or just until you can't see the lump in it's stomach. also the temperature of the vivarium can alter the how long it needs to digest, if the tank is colder, it needs longer to digest.|`|yQIOXv5Yaa	he should be safe to handle after 3 days or so, maybe a little longer if you are unsure. as for the digestion Q, not sure on that...

OyNJTWaiaa	He may be ill, and if so cannot regulate his body temperature very well. Put a lamp next to the cage with a 25 to 40 watt globe in it for warmth so he can move towards the warmth if he needs it. Check his butt to see if he has poopy bottom, a sign of ill health, stress or not eating. Watch to see if her is eating well and not just pretending as some sick birds do.|`|CQww1c2daa	The budgie is scared right now.  Let him adjust to his new home and please don't pick him up for a while.  Keep him warm.|`|b3ZLY5osaa	id move him out of the garage, this is how i found my parakeet only he was in the middle of the street... and tried to bite my hand off... still does...
VY2T6hrbaa	I have my chickens in a chicken house in the back yard.  The house itself is 4 x 8 and the pen around it is 16 x 16.  I used 4 x 4 posts on each corner and at the midway points (every 8 feet).  Chicken wire is tacked to the posts.  I trimmed the whole thing out with 1 x 6's at the top and bottom.<br>  <br>  I don't want to have to clip my chicken's feathers so I ran string in rows across the top and then secured a bit of chicken wire on top of that just at the edges.  (They flew out a couple of times before I did that).<br>  <br>  My birds don't fly out.  Hawks cannot fly in.  Chickens don't go out.  Other animals don't go in.  I've been very happy with my 10 chickens.  They produce between 7 and 10 eggs a day (I have two roosters).  I give the eggs away to family and friends.<br>  <br>  P.S.<br>  Of course you don't have to have roosters to have eggs.  I just like them because they really do "cockle doodle do" in the morning!<br>  <br>  PSS<br>  if you do decide to clip the wings...make sure you only clip ONE side!  If you clip both sides they can still fly...use scissors to cut off the first row of wings.|`|twtWD7glaa	Just make a very secure run for the chick. Make sure it's got wire on the bottom too.. so a cat can't dig under. Just make sure it's covered with dirt or something inside so it's not walking on the wire.

oJoYk2Ataa	Craigslist is a nice place to give fish away ^^<br>  Just tell people you're giving free fish, post a picture, and say "Pick-up only" so it's more convenient for you :)<br>  <br>  You might be able to return it to some local fish stores too :D|`|d70af5b97c8e2c9b3cd22bb36a58c59caa	Your info is incomplete.  I'd post this on an online ad site, like hoobly, or craigslist, or some other like-mentioned site.  This will limit your responses to people closer by, so your fish will survive the trip.<br>  <br>  Congrats on raising fish so big, by the way!! Angels have a reputation for being fragile in some tanks!  I hope you find them a great home!|`|T1LdAIabaa	you might try craigslist or something of that nature.  It would be easier to find local people to help you out
769068c691176f6c9fe4154f357e813caa	Some cats deliver part of the litter and then go out of labor for up to 24 hours before delivering the remaining kittens. This could be due to a lack of privacy during delivery, or because the kittens were conceived at different matings (which means the kittens in a single litter could be fathered by different toms). Pauses in the delivery process are perfectly fine, but if your queen is in active labor and straining for more than 45 minutes without producing a kitten, you should call your veterinarian.|`|AA11459417	Don't worry.  Your cat isn't some kind of freak.  It's not unusual at all for kittens from the same litter to be born on different days.  The reason for this is that female cats can conceive kittens from more than one mating, which can happen several days apart.  Sometimes the kittens will have different fathers, but in your case, if you're sure that all of the kittens have the same father, your male cat obviously got to your female cat more than once.|`|70878cc978ee2e4a79b3b53284340f9caa	* Shakes head*  I am so tired of these kind of questions.Take the cat to the vet! She may still have a kitten in there and she could die. And get her spayed for God's sake! Take the male and get him neutered right now,and then get her spayed when the kittens are weaned.And don't let her out or let the male near her,because a cat can get pregnant again just a few days after it has given birth.|`|VkXQq2y2aa	Cats are weird in that they can get pregnant more than once. I've heard of a cat giving birth two weeks later!!
H06PtiIAaa	unfort you dont have any other options fish wise other than a betta fish.<br>  <br>  no other fish can live fully in a 2.5 gallon.. filter or not. <br>  <br>  Ghost shrimps are a good option if you dont want fish.|`|d70af5b97c8e2c9b3cd22bb36a58c59caa	A fancy guppy may be able to survive a small tank like that, or else a trio of neon tetras.|`|LHEwlNy8aa	Get one Dwarf Puffer (They are also called Pea Puffers, that's what mine were called) They require about that much per Puffer. They're VERY interesting, cute, and amusing. They prefer heavily planted tanks, Youtube "Cecelia The Dwarf Puffer" to see one of mine the day I brought them home. Do NOT put them with any fish besides an Otto Cat, they'll kill eachother. (Though I wouldn't put one in that small of a tank)|`|Fx9bxZ8aaa	your tank can only hold a betta in their.srry to say this but it is your only option for that tank.try getting a bigger tank.then you can have more fish.or if bettas don't seem attractive to you then you can get a nice one like a halfmoon or a delta.|`|PXZ8jxiGaa	Maybe you can get one or two danios, which are interesting small fish, but watch out they breed crazily|`|oJoYk2Ataa	Maybe try some small tropical fish like neon tetras, or maybe white cloud minnows if you don't have a heater. Make sure you google it or ask someone else though, not too sure if they'll work ^^|`|Ywr05G7Laa	oh maybe if you want more other little fishe you should get 2 platys male and female and then if u dnt want the babies just let them theyll get eaten so yeah the fish is livebreeder so the babies come out swimmin not in eggs good luck
fgxajTiBaa	It's called submissive urination. It usually happens as a result of being severely scolded when peeing/pooping in the house during potty training. The dog associates behaving submissively with urinating.<br>  <br>  The only thing you could do to help would be to not say anything when she pees just ignore it. When you catch her not peeing when she sees them reward her with a nice treat.|`|ixFbNr4taa	This is called Submissive Urination.   You can Google more articles using that term.<br>  <br>  Your dog - as you said - is excited and is trying to be submissive to what she sees as the dominant pack members (the males). <br>  <br>  Your task is to take the excitement and stress out of the situations that previously triggered submissive urination. Get cooperation from all members of the family. NONE of the men should interact with her during the training phase.  No petting, no rough-housing, no staring or prolonged eye contact.  When you first get home, you can anticipate that the dog will get excited and urinate so you need to minimize the excitement. Instead of an enthusiastic greeting to your dog, quietly walk in the door and go about your business. Let her outside to pee as usual, but without any fanfare. If you talk to her at all, just say "Hi Rover" in a calm, casual tone of voice. Don't make eye contact with her or pet her. After she settles down, very gently crouch down to her level presenting to her sideways (this makes you very non-threatening), then calmly and quietly praise her and tell her she's good. Be sure to tell your family and visitors to do the same.  Especially the men!!<br>  <br>  Do everything you can to boost your dog's confidence. As she becomes more confident, she may feel less of a need to display extreme submissive behavior. <br>  <br>  To increase her confidence - you should take her to obedience classes (only positive ones or clicker training ones -- nothing punishment oriented or he will get worse). Also - in small doses - take her to different places - parks, walks in your neighborhood, walk around your local mall or shopping center (if they allow dogs). You want to introduce her into Non-threatening situations.  Get some of your male friends to help you out.  (But only use the mature ones who can follow your instructions) - some of the younger boys/men might just undo all of your training efforts with one stupid move.<br>  <br>  GOOD LUCK!! Start those classes ASAP!!
AA11015395	Well number 1 she still feels a bond with her baby's even Theo they were taking from her she still has the mother in stink in her and she is caring that bond over to you because you to have that mother in stink and she can Sense that about you and you came back for her you didn't abandoned her cats are very smart just give her time she'll love you for ever.|`|xjYaHMGhaa	The kneeding is rather common, both my cats do it and they are affectionate cats. Being fixed tends to calm animals and give them nicer personalities and if she was already bonded then she is likely even more attached to you now. Be happy, there are alot of kitties who hate attention and those who seek it might be bothersome at times *like at two in the morning demanding you pet them* but they are a blessing.|`|17sFKCdIaa	when a cat is about to have kittens, she starts to get real motherly. she is pretending you are her kitten as weird as that sounds. also the gettin spayed thing could be it.|`|c1e9549af86c487364c948ec19681882aa	All cats, both males and females, knead from time to time, when they are getting comfortable or are happy in the spot they are in. This really has little to do with pregnancy. It is more of an instinct... baby kittens knead their paws on their mother's belly to get the milk flowing out of the teats when they feed. Adult cats do this because it makes them feel content and secure, much in the same way a child will suck his thumb or fingers. Your kitty is doing this because she feels very happy around you, and it is an affectionate gesture to you as well.|`|1RWdip75aa	She's most likely going through a false pregnancy. <br>  <br>  Kneading is very common, it's used for affection. When kittens are nursing they knead the mother's stomach to help the flow of milk.<br>  <br>  Pretty much just give her the loving she wants, she'll like it :)
n5VnN73raa	When you fill the tank with water the weight should hold it in place. However if you are nervous, you could turn the stand into a "table" then place the tank. It would just be a challenge to find something strong enough that is the right size. I think for the most part it should be fine without any other support. <br>  <br>  I have a 30 gallon stand, and have put a 20 gallon tank on it, it only touched 2 sides and did just fine. I know this isn't as dramatic of a difference but it still worked with only 2 touching sides.

Seriously he is showing you that he loves you, and thanking you for being his family.
uSOJoRTaaa	Russian Tortoise's love to dig and burrow; it's their thing.  Also, even though they don't swim, they don't mind a shallow pond to "bathe" in.  Doing this may cause them to poo, so don't be alarmed if that happens.  Having a good sized enclosure like you do is beneficial because they like to explore.  For the best entertainment, try a ramp or a log to climb over.  Tortoise's enjoy obstacles!  And leaving it outside like you are is also a good thing.  So it sounds like you're doing everything right, just perhaps add a log or other obstacle and you will have a happy tortoise with a long life!|`|80vFuZrqaa	go to a near by zoo and look at what they have|`|ag8DRqvEaa	Don't worry, tortoise are not social animals which means they dont need any attention or accompany at all.

KeevlZnTaa	Gliders are awake for the better part of the night. They bark weather they are alone or with another glider. I used to own gliders and they made a lot of noise at night barking, jumping around, etc. They were awake from around 11pm until around 6am, I am an insomniac so it didn't bother me too much, but when I did want to sleep it was difficult and they would wake me with their noise.<br>  <br>  You need to look and see if you can breeder in your area. Breeders are the best places to get a new pet.|`|44kEtDvIaa	Check site below.  Has links to pet classifieds.  Try US Freeads and go from there.

Sites cover all over the world.<br>  <br>  Also see the site for more info on gliders, including healthcare issues and handling.|`|NezRCqdNaa	1. They will make a lot of noise but not necessarily barking. The barking is usually when they really want attention (and you need to give it to them). They will chitter and chatter a lot. Make noise playing around. They can hiss and sneeze too. <br>  2. I would NOT order one from somewhere. Try to find a licensed breeder you can drive to. Or find an exotic, independent pet store owned by trustworthy, responsible and loving people. Those are the types of places I hear the best experiences from. Avoid pet stores in malls!<br>  <br>  P.S. Do A LOT of research before you even consider owning one. They are a huge responsibility and require lots of time, attention, special diets and are not good for inexperienced pet owners. It's like having a child.<br>  <br>  Also, it is not cruel to own a single sugar glider. But owning in pairs is much preferred because then they will have a friend to play with at night when you may not be available. They are social creatures and can actually die if they are neglected. <br>  Having a single glider just requires MUCH more attention than two. My lone glider is extremely healthy, happy and well-tempered! It helps that he was well-bonded from birth and enjoys meeting new people. He also is loved by other members of my household who can care for him when I'm not around. Most importantly, I am able to give him many many hours of love and play because I live a nocturnal schedule.<br>   I'm not recommending owning just one, I just feel the need to defend the practice against being called "extremely cruel." I find it really offensive and a generally ignorant statement. It all depends on the owner and I'm not the only one who feels this way.|`|8NSh1D4Maa	1. More because it will be distressed and bored.  However, it is also extremely cruel to keep only one.  They are very social animals and MUST be kept in pairs or groups.  <br>  2.  It is never ever a good idea to 'order' any sort of pet from anywhere.  Sugar gliders are very delicate and no one who is responsible would ship or otherwise transport them long distances.|`|7SyCZnM9aa	Sugar gliders are strictly nocturnal. Therefore they are always going to be active and awake at night. Most pet stores don't know much about exotics and breeders are in it just for money and usually inbreed their stock. Try a local exotics rescue, or look on <a href="http://www.petfinder.com." rel="nofollow">http://www.petfinder.com.</a> Shipping these guys would be cruel because they don't have much tolerance for heat and most cargo bays (where they will be placed) aren't air conditioned. So try rescuing locally.
OdDbR4Psaa	Which is why peace lily vases are horrible conditions for bettas to live in. They are only made for decoration, not the health of the betta.<br>  <br>  IF you cut the roots, it may help, or it may not and cause the plant to die, and decompose, and cause ammonia/nitrite poisoning and kill the fish too.<br>  <br>  AND if you hold it up with something, it will still stink. Stinking means that the water IS NOT CLEAN and the roots/plant are ROTTING!<br>  <br>  So please, for the sake of the poor little betta, take him out put it somewhere else with clean water and no plants (preferably a 2.5 gallon cycled and heated tank). And then the plant can have the vase all to himself.<br>  <br>  Remember, bettas are living creatures too and would appreciate a nice, clean space where they can swim around happily (which would be an actual tank)|`|00RgkZF8aa	A bigger tank.<br>  <br>  Bettas should NOT be housed in vases. They need a minimum of 2.5 gallons WITH a filter and heater.|`|1YNhKzeqaa	Get the betta out of there. Bettas do not belong in bowls, actually... no fish really belongs in a bowl, not even a goldfish.<br>  <br>  The peace lily roots are not whatsoever suitable food for your betta. Another danger is that your betta won't be able to reach the water's surface. They are a labyrinth fish, they can get their oxygen from the atmosphere with a special organ on the top of their head.<br>  <br>  Bettas are tropical fish, meaning they need their water to be 72-76 degrees fahrenheit, if they are not kept warm they will be lethargic and eat very little, they are cold blooded after all.<br>  <br>  Bettas need some swimming space, if they don't they could get bored and nip at their own fins (like some people chew their nails when bored, or some bird pluck their feathers). Also, provide him with some plants and decorations to help keep boredom at bay. DO NOT put a mirror in the tank. He will attack his reflection, and as entertaining as it may be for some people, your little betta could injure himself.<br>  <br>  Be sure the tank is on a level, sturdy surface that wont get bumped or jostled, as that can put stress on the fish, and he will be more susceptible to disease. Add some aquarium salt to the water too, NOT marine salt. Aquarium salt is for fresh water fish and will help your little guys stay healthy. Marine salt is for brackish and salt water fish, and is not what you need.<br>  <br>  Make sure you get a filter to maintain water quality, and be sure to set up the filter so there are no strong currents. Strong currents can tatter his fins.<br>  <br>  Good luck with your beta :D
K0uTjeWiaa	Read the answer to the previous question. All the cats can be on the same food if you feed them correctly, I answered about crf below this is abpout nutrition for your cats so this doesn't happen to them<br>   <br>   <br>  Nutrition since there are so many bad things out there is very important to your cat’s health<br>  Contrary to what you may have heard; dry foods are not a great thing to feed a cat. <br>  Please read the label on what you are feeding? What are the ingredients? Do you know what they mean? Is the first ingrediant a muscle meat like chicken or meal or other things?<br>  <a href="http://www.catinfo.org/#Learn_How_To_Read_a_Pet_Food_Ingredient_Label" rel="nofollow">http://www.catinfo.org/#Learn_How_To_Rea...</a><br>  <a href="http://iml.jou.ufl.edu/projects/Spring04/Perhach/PetFood/InterpretingLabels.htm" rel="nofollow">http://iml.jou.ufl.edu/projects/Spring04...</a><br>  Dry foods are the number 1 cause of diabetes in cats as well as being a huge contributing factor to kidney disease, obesity, crystals, u.t.i’s and a host of other problems. Food allergies are very common when feeding dry foods. Rashes, scabs behind the tail and on the chin are all symptoms<br>  The problems associated with Dry food is that they are loaded with grains and carbohydrates which many cats (carnivores) cannot process.  Also, Most of the moisture a cat needs is suppose to be in the food but in<br>  Dry, 95% of it is zapped out of dry foods in the processing. Another thing, most use horrible ingredients and don't use a muscle meat as the primary ingredient and use vegetable based protein versus animal. Not good for an animal that has to eat meat to survive.<br>  <a href="http://www.catinfo.org/#My_Cat_is_Doing_Just_Fine_on_Dry_Food" rel="nofollow">http://www.catinfo.org/#My_Cat_is_Doing_...</a><br>  You want to pick a canned food w/o gravy (gravy=carbs) that uses a muscle meat as the first ingredient and doesn't have corn at least in the first 3 ingredients if at all.   <br>   THE  BEST CAT FOODS CONTAIN NO GRAINS NO BYPOODUCTS NO MEAL<br>  Cats are meat eaters not cereal or rice eaters<br>   Fancy feast is a middle grade food with 9lives, friskies  whiskas lower grade canned and wellness and merrick upper grade human quality foods. I would rather feed a middle grade canned food then the top of the line dry food.<br>   Also, dry food is not proven to be better for teeth.

In vet school, the only classes offered on nutrition usually last a few weeks, and are taught by representatives from the pet food companies. Vet students may also receive free food for their own dogs and cats at home. They could get an Iams notebook, a Purina purse and some free pizza.  <a href="http://iml.jou.ufl.edu/projects/Spring04/Perhach/PetFood/Vets.htm" rel="nofollow">http://iml.jou.ufl.edu/projects/Spring04...</a>|`|tWzIsIH0aa	You could feed all 4 cats with the k/d diet, or if that is not an option [price, etc.] separate the one cat that needs the diet the most from the others. Isolate the one cat in a room with some fresh water and when that cat is done, put the bowl up somewhere so the other 3 cats don't get to it.<br>  <br>  Personally, I have a cat that had an Urinary Tract Infection. We switched from store brand cat food to Hill's. All of my cats were on the Veterinary Diet and now they're on regular Science Diet.|`|yyf5N7Ogaa	First, DO NOT put all the cats on k/d unless they all have kidney problems. It would really not be good for them. DUH!<br>  <br>  It is best to feed cats a set amount twice a day. Feed three cats in one room and one cat in another. I had an old cat on k/d for almost 2 years before she died. She wasn't thrilled about her diet but it kept her alive. I just fed her in the bathroom and the other cats in the kitchen.|`|lTsDwY9Paa	Why exactly does your cat have to be on special food? I have 6 cats, one eats a different food. I feed them 3 meals a day, they all know their own dishes and I only feed the amount that each needs for one meal.|`|SZdSFi1raa	if you don't let the graze on their food all day you can feed that cat in a closed room or you could ask the vet if the diet food would harm the other cats if not feed the diet food to all of them.|`|AA11736483	You have to separate them at feeding time. You should NOT feed the other cats K/D! It is potentially harmful to them (and needlessly expensive).|`|DtsxooZUaa	I had the same problem on a smaller scale. What I did is put my cats on schedule, so i can monitor their eating. The one who doesn't need special diet food gets feed first. (that way he is distracted) then I prepare the special kitten his food. <br>  <br>  It took a week or so for them to not pay attention to what the other had to eat. I would have to literally watch over them and correct them anytime they try to switch. i'd say hey and snap, then move them to their appropriate bowls. now I can be at a distance and when I correct them they will go to their correct food. <br>  <br>  It will take some time but nothing a few weeks of training and patience cant fix.|`|MJLPBeMSaa	I think others are right, you can talk to your vet about feeding all of the cats the k/d and I don't really want to get on my soapbox but if it's about price you really should be feeding your cats a premium cat food already so it can not be that much of a price difference.
oT71QN8Raa	It seems obvious that the she was very happy at her foster home, and this may make it harder for her to be comfortable around you.  You need to understand that in her eyes, you are not some wonderful human who took her away from a cage - you are horrible human for ripping her away from a foster home she adored and could be herself in.  It may take her a few days to get used to you and your wife, and to the other cat.  While she is getting used to you, make sure you and your wife are constantly talking softly and in a slightly high pitched voice (almost like how you would talk to an infant - not babytalk, but just as "perky").  Talk to the kitty, talk to her A LOT.  And don't go toward her and try to pet her without letting her come to you first.  Keep treats with you at all times the few next few days, so when/if she does come to you, you have a way to reward her other than petting.  She WILL trust you in time.<br>  <br>  EDIT:  You are completely right in not taking her out of her zone.  Don't force her to eat or drink right now.  She's just scared, its normal.  As long as she's eating/drinking at night, its fine that she doesn't come out during the day.  It won't take her long (talking matter of days, not weeks) for her to realize you are good people.  Just do what you are doing and let her be.  Keep talking to her if you have to walk by her or near her, let her know you are safe and will not harm her.  The talking to her habit will get her used to your voice.  She'll be alright.|`|AA11015395	Let her take the time she needs to come out, in the mean time put the sent on her from the other cat by brushing both cats with the same hair brush and make sure you play with both cats the same way and time don't give more time to one then the other and every now and then but her in the cat box just to show her its ok don't worrier about her hiding some cats hide more then others. That's ok because all cats are not the same there just like people.|`|V532HJHhaa	about 2-3 or 4 days because she has to get used to surroundings and the other cat so yeah  about 2-4 days. oh usually she will come out if you play with her and shake a feather on a Stick around|`|ZB524v05aa	I have alot of experience with cats as I've grown up with them and my mother always adopts strays.<br>  it's only been a few days.

FVD1tpLeaa	keep them combed every day|`|o93EwErKaa	The best detangling product I have ever come across for my Yorkies is Cowboy Magic Instant Detangler and Shine.  They have a website with a store locater.  Their products are usually sold at livestock feed stores.  A little of the product goes a long way.  It cuts grooming time down from 30 minutes daily to just a few minutes.  The tangles and matts just disappear and brush out with ease.  Continued use seems to change the texture of the hair so it doesn't matt and tangle so easily.  This is the best product ever and the only one I have ever used in 25 years that does what it says it is suppose to do.  It is pure silk protein so it doesn't make their coat oily.<br>  <br>  www.cowboymagic.com|`|PM23RDycaa	Well if you were brushing them EVERYday like you were supposed to this wouldn't have happened.<br>  <br>  Take them in to be groomed and given a puppy cut. After that brush them everyday or at least every other day.|`|kqa9VFrfaa	If the tangles are really bad be kind and get the hair clipped short, then as the hair grows back out keep them well brushed and combed. <br>  If U do not want to shave them down be very careful, and trim the knots out instead of combing, because that can really hurt. <br>  I used to be a professional groomer, and people would let their dogs go way too long at a stretch, so we always had to make that determination as to whether or not it would hurt the dog to be combed out more than if we shaved them down. Yorkies HAVE to be brushed on a regular basis.|`|18f339d2d88d8a05cc418425220b52e1aa	They are a high maintenance dogs.  They need to be combed out each day or even twice a day.  Then their monthly grooming costs to maintain the clip.<br>  <br>  You either pay a groomer to keep up the coat or your do it your self.  Grooming can be very expensive but they need a clip about every 5 to 6 weeks,  You can learn how to do it & not pay that price.  Some groomers will help you learn how to groom a Yorkie.  If you don't comb every day you may have to pay a mat charge on top of the regular charge.<br>  <br>  Most common folk keep them shorter due to the length being too hard to maintain.  That long flowing coat would pick up all kinds of stickers & twigs & leaves & mud & make the mats worse.  The coat picks up all kinds of stuff .  So daily grooming is pretty much a must.|`|tPGxPDvBaa	It is better to go to groomers at this point.  Since you aren't used to de-matting or clipping, the rate of an accident happening & being very painful for your dogs is high.

Suck it this time & go to groomers & let them advise you how to brush properly & which tools you should be using.|`|2c844fcf526bc2b90f16b7c425e11aa7aa	This is due to lack of grooming.

0B4plcLEaa	Hi, I breed parrotlets (and some other species) as a hobby. Parrotlets do have huge attitudes for such little birds! They are stubborn, strong-willed and highly opinionated. Kepp working on her with the fruits and veggies...parrotlets often will snub their noses at these but keep trying. In the wild parrotlets are ground foragers. They root around on the ground for seeds and berries and not many fruit is found on the ground...so this may have something to do with them not wanting to eat much of it. I have several breeding pairs. What I do and they seem to like is to put corn on the cob on the bottom of the cage. I cut it in half and put small sections of it in there on the bottom for them to forage for. Also I put whole grain toast or waffles in there. Strawberries cut in half or grapes, watermelon, or blueberries also seem to be favorites here. I put everything on a white paper plate and mix the millet in. It may just take her time to get used to it...she may never eat it at all. A lot of times if you consistantly offer fresh food though they will eventually try it. You are right though, parrotlets are extremely picky!!!<br>  I have noticed with breeding the little devils, that they can be quite nippy. I think hens are exspecially nippy. I get bit everyday when I go to feed my breeders...and even my little albino hen I held back as a pet, is nippy at times. I will always say "No bite" loudly and firmly as soon as she does it. This usually startles them and they stop what they are doing. If you shout in a loud stern voice every time she bites...she will learn what "no bite" means and she will understand it is bad. If you are holding her on your finger or arm when she goes to bite...while saying "no bite", knock her slightly off balance by shifting your arm or finger. Don't throw her in the floor, dropping her will cause her not to trust you. Birds HATE to be knocked off balance. If she associates her negative behavior to something she hates...she will eventually stop doing it. I also will sometimes grab their beaks between my thumb and index fingers and say "No Bite". I don't yank...I just let them know this is unacceptable. Over time she will learn that you will not tolerate the biting...she will still sometimes do it, all birds do. Parrotlets have a painful bite for such little beaks. They are like pitbulls of the parrot world, they lock on and don't want to let go.  Parrotlets also have a way of trying to rule the roost, they can easily be spoiled and turn into little demons who want to get the upper hand on their owners. Start your relationship off right by making known who is the "top-bird" in your home.  You will fall in love with that species. They are so smart and energetic and can be little snuggle bunnies. Parrotlets are really intelligent, you made an excellent choice!|`|Yr4eBnXlaa	I have two of these "monsters." :D<br>  <br>  I started out by soaking the seeds in fresh orange juice and sprinkling them over the fresh foods.  One of them ate it the other wanted nothing to do with it.<br>  <br>  So, instead I soak all their seed in warm water for 8 to 12 hours (enough to germinate the seed) then drain and rinse thoroughly, sprinkle on Nekton-S vitamin supplement and some avian specific probiotic and melted red palm oil (health food stores or online sellers - get the organic kind from Africa.)<br>  <br>  I also offer (and they both eat it) Harrison's High Potency pellet diet in the fine and super-fine size (mixed together.)  They both have discovered how good it is and will scream their heads off if they don't have a full dish of it every morning.

1omgPICKaa	Hi there, if you just got him yesterday, his behaviour is very normal. He will be very stressed and scared right now. He is in a strange place in a strange cage. It can take up to a few weeks for him to return to his normal self.<br>  <br>  Standing on one foot is a good sign, only birds who are healthy and feeling comfortable at that moment will do that. Birds do preen their feathers a lot, it is important for them to keep them in top shape. It is only a problem if he is plucking his feathers out.<br>  <br>  Is he weaned? Pet shops should never sell an unweaned bird, it is dangerous, unneccasary, and usually illegal. However, sometimes young weaned birds do enjoy having hand rearing mix for a little while longer, even if they don't need it. It does benefit some individuals.<br>  <br>  That's good that he is getting plenty of sleep, 12 hours is the ideal amount.<br>  <br>  Birds hit their beaks on things for many reasons... some do it when they feel playful, others may be showing off how tough they are.<br>  <br>  As for crest feathers... up means normal, neutral, at ease. Down flat means aggressive but it also goes down when they reach out to pick up something with their beak. Very straight up as far as it will go means very excited or alert.<br>  <br>  Sounds like your cockatiel is acting normal in its current situation. Nothing to worry about. :) Like I said, it may take a couple of weeks to settle down.<br>  <br>  I hope that helps. Congrats on your new bird. :)<br>  <br>  EDIT: Concerning the white dusty stuff that goes everywhere when your bird is preening... cockatiels are known to produce a lot of dander, which is what that is. It helps keep the feathers in good condition.<br>  <br>  Also, you may notice that there are feathers on your bird which are wrapped in a white wax-like substance... these are called pin feathers, which also contribute to the dust that your cockatiel produces when he preens and unravels them.|`|PVaD9GSbaa	give him some time to adjust to his new home. what you're describing are actually common behavior for cockatiels, and the "cleaning excessivly" is known as preening, which birds do when they are very comfortable.|`|44ZMz0jfaa	Id call your vet! Also google ways to tame birds|`|uobx1Gb5aa	i think that you should've done your research before getting a cocktiel. it sounds like a normal, scared bird. since you got it yesterday. just let it get used to its surroundings.<br>  Birds bite when scared- don't think that just because your cocktiels handfed it won't bite it needs to get used to you.<br>  also- WTF you hand feed it even though its  weaned ?!? I THINK  you need to read more books.<br>  anyway, birds spend most of their time cleaning themselves<br>  they bite cos you just got it yesterday<br>  and he bangs his beak against stuff cos he just had a good meal.<br>  <br>  also, don't let your bird stand on your shoulder yet, it'll make him feel dominant.<br>  <br>  ALSO, cockitiels can't just LIVE off seeds, go buy roudybush pellets and give it fresh vegtables and fruits everyday<br>  (iceberg lettuce doesn't do crap, dont' even think about feeding it to the bird unless you wanna deal with diarrhea or death.)<br>  <br>  <br>  EDIT*<br>  are you stupid ? how old are you, seriously.<br>  just cos the birds raised to be handfed doesn't mean they have to be handfed all their life ... and if the birds young and Still NEEDS to be handfed then you shouldn't even have it right now.<br>  you should have a unlimited supply of food left out for your bird, unless you want to starve it then I'd just give your bird to a more knowledgeable home.|`|Cfja6h4Kaa	If you just got him yesterday, he's probably just freaked out by the new environment. You should probably give him some time to settle in without handling him too much.  Call the pet store where you got him, and ask them for some suggestions.|`|QuduR6kdaa	It could be because he was hand raised and now he's in a cage too much.<br>  <br>  That's what has happened to a lot of the cockatiels I've seen.<br>  <br>  Hand raised birds really hate cages, but pet stores usually don't tell people that.|`|xBzBAv9waa	ugh|`|6tQ6nT1Naa	If you just got Casanova yesterday, then it is to early to determine normal behavior for your bird. For cockatiels in general, there is always a period of adjustment when they are taken into a new home. It may appear sweet and timid at first and as time passes it starts asserting its likes and dislikes (one way of showing unhappiness is biting). I wouldn't worry about the biting yet, he's young and still getting used to you. Just try to pay attention to what he likes and doesn't like. Biting is one way of letting you know.<br>  <br>  Did the breeder or store you bought him from tell you to continue hand feeding? Because a young bird shouldn't be sold until fully weaned. I would advise you ask your breeder/pet store when he was weaned and/or how much longer you should hand-feed.<br>  <br>  All birds stand on one foot at times (particularly when they are resting), this is completely normal. Also, they preen and groom themselves often. This is a must, to keep their feathers in good condition. Birds take bathes to keep clean at least once week (some like it every day). A shallow dish of water, large enough to spread his wings will do. If Casanova won't bathe in a dish of water, try misting with a water bottle. If you pay attention to your birds body language (i.e.. leaning away or running away, hissing or biting) you'll be able to determine how he likes it and how often.<br>  <br>  Cockatiels love attention, so the more time you spend with him and the more time you allow him out of the cage, the friendlier he'll be and the better it is for him.<br>  <br>  Usually with Cockatiels, if the crest of head feathers are up, they are excited, interested, or happy. Down, they may be scared or uncomfortable. I would recommend reading up on their body language. The more you understand their body language, the better you can understand Casanova's mood, likes & dislike, and the happier he'll be.<br>  <br>  Here are some good sites on Cockatiels with all of the "need to know" info, such as proper cage size and diet (they don't just eat seed, they need fresh vegetables & fruit daily as well as pellets, for good health ). It's a really good idea to read as much as you can, and continue to do research on good Cockatiel care...<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.cockatielcottage.net/" rel="nofollow">http://www.cockatielcottage.net/</a><br>  <a href="http://www.cockatielcottage.net/basics.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.cockatielcottage.net/basics.h...</a><br>  <a href="http://loveofbirds.com/" rel="nofollow">http://loveofbirds.com/</a><br>  <br>  <br>  Also, I recommend joining an online Cockatiel group. They can be a lot of help and a good source for advice. Here are a couple to choose from...<br>  <br>  <a href="http://pets.groups.yahoo.com/group/tielchatter/?v=1&t=search&ch=web&pub=groups&sec=group&slk=3">http://pets.groups.yahoo.com/group/tielc...</a><br>  <a href="http://pets.groups.yahoo.com/group/cockatielcastle/?v=1&t=search&ch=web&pub=groups&sec=group&slk=8">http://pets.groups.yahoo.com/group/cocka...</a><br>  <a href="http://pets.groups.yahoo.com/group/Cockatiels/?v=1&t=search&ch=web&pub=groups&sec=group&slk=6">http://pets.groups.yahoo.com/group/Cocka...</a><br>  <br>  Good luck!<br>  <br>  PS If you read up on the websites I have provided, you'll see that it's normal to have a lot of white dust/flakes or "feather dust" with Cockatiels.  Cockatiels, in particular, tend to shed much more feather dust (especially after preening) than most other species.  Do some research, and it will make a big difference in how well you take care of Casanova, and how happy & healthy he is!  :o)|`|DQkDQraOaa	Maybe he is having a hard time adjusting to his new home and surroundings.

They also require grooming on a regular basis, given how furry they are. Also they are VERY dependent on their human(s) and need more companionship than most dogs.<br>  <br>  All the places I have looked say that papillons are not good around young children because they play too rough with them and this tends to break bones in the puppies because the dogs are so fragile in bone structure.<br>  <br>  Best of Luck :)|`|1XLZdOcQaa	Here's a link that can help you a lot about the Papillon breed.

8cikAYp3aa	get out of the pet store  and go to the garden store!.  look for pre formed plastic ponds for gardens.  they come in a wide ranges of styles, sizes, shapes, depths.  Its very easy to cut a hole shaped like the pond in a piece of ply wood, seal it with poly eurathane  and build side walls to support it out of 2 x4  or landscape timbers.  Add a bit of a wall to the top and you have a build in basking area.

6yoCcGBWaa	You should do this with regular water changes and not with any chemical additions.  Test your replacement water for these parameters.  Then, find fish that thrive in these conditions.  It is so much easier to keep fish that prefer a higher pH and hardness, than to constantly monkey with chemistry.<br>  <br>  The pH up/down drops and powders are temporary remedies and will cause your fish more stress than living at a constant pH.|`|AA11901352	Ph is what ph is going to be.  Most fish are fine in a wide range of PH.  The key is to have a stable one.  If you NEED to lower the ph, the best way is to add bog woods to the tank, either drift  wood or peat moss to the filter.  This will naturally keep the PH lowered in the tank.  Remember adding chemicals are a temporary adjustment and will be pulled out of the tank once the water filters thru the carbon.<br>  <br>  Is your tap water high?  You can also purchase water for your tank or in come cases running the water thru a filter (like pure or britta) will also help.
f9fb186e1c82bf7349b1e14dcbb1bcc4aa	Call the guy who sold you the dog and ask him for help and more information. He is the one that sold you the dog, he knows what shots he sent you home with etc. <br>  <br>  You cannot take him out in public, but you can take him out in your backyard as long as other dogs don't go in there.. <br>  He is probably not eating good quality food, and he is a young puppy, probably stressed.. Very likely the pills you got were for worming him. I suspect the diarrhea is related to the worm infestation.|`|8a2XXsnzaa	shots and pills? ok, to inject them you do it under the skin, weird, you should take him to a vet for that, plus it is a puppy you have to be extra careful, give him puppy vitamins to stilmulate the apetite, feed him chicken breast and rice if he has diarrhea, get pee pads to train him inside the home. place them near the exit door, as he gts older he will know to go outside, because the pee pads are suppose to have a grassy scent aside from pee scent.

They don't get complete control of themselves until they are about 6 months old. Of course, you should still begin potty training early. A mistake lots of people make is in waiting for the puppy to go to the door or in some way tell you he needs to go out. He won't do this because he doesn't understand it yet. <br>  Do this: take the puppy outside to the spot you want him to potty, allow him to potty, then praise him and bring him directly back inside.<br>  Don't allow him to associate going outside with play just yet. <br>  He's a baby so expect some mistakes in the house. Don't rub his nose in it or any of those silly things. IF you see him do it, yell "NO!" loudly and take him outside. Whether he goes or not doesn't matter, he's probaby already finished anyway. <br>  Don't do anything unless you SEE him do it in the house. His attention span is about 5 seconds so unless you see him do it, he won't know what you're mad at him about.<br>  <br>  What shots and pills? If the puppy needs shots take him to a vet who knows what to do. Puppy shots don't cost that much.<br>  He shouldn't need any pills.<br>  Best of luck!|`|qqUvoC5uaa	What are the pills and shots for?<br>  The pup should already have had his shots and pre-going home vaccinations etc. done before he was given to you.<br>  <br>  If the pup is sick, maybe you should take him to the vet and let your vet handle the sickness instead of giving the pills and shots yourself. <br>  <br>  If he is normal and healthy, taking him outside should not be an issue as long as you stay within your yard (and you are with him) and no unvaccinated dogs come your way.|`|XagPxe7Faa	For starters, the breeder separated him from the mom and litter mates way too early.  Reputable breeders do not place Yorkie pups until they are around 12 weeks old.<br>  <br>  The pup should have been vaccinated BEFORE leaving the breeder.  (At least the first round of vaccinations.)  No, it is not normal for him to have runny poo.  It could be that he has worms or some form of intestinal parasite--very likely if he has not been vaccinated.  <br>  <br>  I would recommend taking him to have him check by your vet.  Take the pill/shots that the breeder gave you and have them confirm that is what he should be getting.<br>  <br>  Make sure that he is eating ample amounts several times per day and educate yourself on detecting the onset of hypogycemia and how to prevent it.  Yorkies are very prone to it, expecially when they are very small, young and adjusting to their new homes.|`|p7swtBYzaa	The guy gave you the shots and pills???<br>  Please take him to a vet to be checked out - puppies need a series of 3 vaccinations, several weeks apart, you shouldn't be doing this yourself.<br>  You can't take him out to a public area until he is fully vaccinated, puppies are susceptable to all sorts of diseases until then - parvo being a really bad one, so keep him where other dogs don't go.<br>  <br>  Liquid poop is not normal, he has diarrhea, could be nervous, could be worms -- you need to get a fecal done at the vets too.<br>  <br>  What pills?   Heartworm preventative?    Please, take him to the vet and get information on how to raise your puppy.<br>  <br>  Also, get the excellent book "Puppies for Dummies", silly title, but very informative - tells you all you need to know about puppies, their care and training.<br>  <br>  Crate training is the easiest and most sure way to potty train.   Until you get a crate and the information on how to do it, confine your puppy to an area where he can't do any damage.   Puppies really don't have much control over their elimination until they are about 6 months, so you need to baby-gate him somewhere with newspapers.<br>  You take him out within 10 minutes after he eats (feed at least twice a day, morning and night), every 2 hours if you can - somewhere safe not used by other dogs.<br>  <br>  Congratulations - I guess - you should have learned puppy care before you got this little fellow, but you have him now, so get him to the vet about that runny poop, puppies dehydrate quickly if they have diarrhea too long.<br>  <br>  Meanwhile, you can make some plain boiled rice, with a little lean chop meat or white meat, skinless, boneless chicken - that will help with the poop, but if it is worms, he needs to have a fecal to find out what kind and then given the right de-wormer.<br>  <br>  So much to learn - get a vet check for the pooch and get the book.   Good luck.|`|da189a0fdeada9df73b4c278f6ebd72aaa	I got a boxer puppy at 6 weeks old. I started to potty train her right away.I took her outside when she awoke from her naps, after she ate, and every couple of hours. She got the idea what to do right away.I did not wish to lay paper down for her to go potty, it creates problems later. Say a paper you want to keep is laid on the floor accidentally.You guessed it the puppy would not know the difference, also they get used to going potty in the house which is not a great thing either.|`|UW9Trvrpaa	Set some newspapers in one place at home. Try to train your puppy to go there.|`|017e2f37de007dc5c98d32b7e183c066aa	well first of all i agree i would carry him to the vet OR call the guy. i cant think of any shots that he should of sent you home with. if it is a miniature you have to be careful, yorkies are prone to have sugar problems just like a diabetic. some grow out of it and some don't. that could explain the loose bowel movements. if he is acting sluggish then there is a tube that you can buy from your local vet or pet store that will increase the sugar in their body. as far as carrying him out many yorkie breeders will tell you that as a precautionary because they are little and low to the ground. they have a weak immune system and get sick just like humans...a few more weeks and it should be warm enough for him to go out to eliminate....<br>  try placing newspaper or puppy pads where he goes in your house and slowly work your way to the door (an inch or two at a time....slowly!) so when he goes to the door you know he is looking for a place!  also dilute vinegar and water in a spray bottle to spray where he has already peed it covers up the smell and burns thier nose....he wont go to that place again...|`|XHkPiDssaa	I would crate train him now that he is a puppy. Get a crate and for now keep him in it most of the time. Take him out to pee, eat and a little bit of play. This will teach him to not pee in his crate. Then when he is used to his crate he can be left out longer and most likely will not go potty in the house. I would take him out every 1-2 hours as a puppy and then 2-3 as he gets older. As for the eating, my chihuahua was not a good eater when she was a puppy. I wet her dry food so it was easier to eat and sometimes even gave her wet food. Just as long as she was eating. Yorkies are generally small as puppies so they wont eat that much. But I would definitely recommend the crate training and do it while he his a puppy!

Most often, marking is an instinctual behavior. (It's more common to males than females, and almost always involves urination). Your dog uses this tactic to say, "This is my turf." The trigger can be anything from the arrival of a baby to the acquisition of a new vacuum cleaner. Sometimes, simply noticing a squirrel zip through the backyard is enough to prompt marking behavior. While excitement or fear can also stimulate your dog to deliberately urinate, the most common explanation is that he's just identifying his territory.<br>  <br>  Here's a link that can help you treat this problem. good luck!<br>  <a href="http://dogtime.com/marking-housesoiling.html" rel="nofollow">http://dogtime.com/marking-housesoiling....</a>|`|qqUvoC5uaa	First off GET HIM NEUTERED, that could very well solve the issue. <br>  Second, take him outside to relieve himself on a regular basis. <br>  <br>  Make sure you clean any area inside where he has urinated thoroughly so as to completely be rid of the scent. <br>  Make sure you are diligent with the training!|`|XHkPiDssaa	Crate train him.

Crate training teaches a puppy how tohld their pee. Puppies dont know how to hold it. Puppies wont pee where they sleep, unless they absolutely cannot hold it any longer. You will hav to catch him peeing everywere. When you catch him you should stomp on the floor and yell "HEY!NO!" (never use the name, they will eventually think that their nams mean somehing bad). stomp toward him and pick him up by the scruff of the neck (thats what the mother dog would do if the pup did something she doesn't like.) and put  him outside and wait till he pees.

You will be given a few names to check out.  Go with the person whom you like the best.  Many a good teacher has ruined a good student based on personality conflicts.
uobx1Gb5aa	what convinced my dad was " they can talk !"<br>  9 months later ... hes chirping and squaking at dawn, pooing everywhere ,lands on your head just to poop, will throw things off the counter to get your attention and will tease the hamsters / gerbils whenver theres a chance... and thats just ONE budgie<br>  i think your parents should WANT a bird to begin with as they need a area to fly around and play, they can't be cooped up in a cage their whole life- thats just cruel.<br>  <br>  why not just  get a job at a pet shop where you can take care of the animals.<br>  hah , i'm 15 too whats most important now are your grades and the coarses to take for a vet, take chem, bio, and physics. get math 12 and engloish 12 and start volunteering places where you interact not only with animals but with people as well.|`|lnf4c1tFaa	show them the rearserch u have done and tell your dad that he owes u for leaving the cage open|`|HGOUI26qaa	Well, if the parents wont let you have one, you might be out of luck.  If you begin to show more responsibility around the house, you will be amazed at what parents will let their kids do.  Parakeets are messy, but they do make good pets.  They are cleaner then dogs though....They really don't take that much to keep them happy.|`|7MzldDHYaa	Hey parents,you guys might not know a lot about parakeets but my mom didn`t eather!She had ME buy it and it turned out amazing! If you parents don`t try to take care of the keets,then it will go FINE! Please let your son/daughter get a pair of keets! I think he/she knows what they are talking about.Oh and BTW,you might know this but if you get two parakeets then they won`t pay much attention to you...so good luck getting the budgies!!!!
NbvTyN7saa	Ask around, many vets will neuter without having the need of a rabies shot etc..  Esp. check with the human societies.

Whoever said it should be illegal is right. How unnatural & gross for the cat, not to mention you should not be introducing a cotton swab into that part of thier bodies. God forbid they have an allergic reaction to the chemicals or materials. <br>  Vaccinations are BS and should not be a requirement for neutering but I think most vets (in my area) require it. Check with your local shelters as they may also do spaying/neutering for a reduced fee.<br>  Do some research on vaccinations & you'll find that for animals as well as people they are very dangerous because they compromise a very young immune system and cause serious health issues later in life. <br>  I have read about links between autism and vaccinations.|`|AA10607827	ewww to the q-tipping, i hope to god u dont really do that<br>  im pretty sure thats against the law to.|`|AA11015395	I never heard any thing about a male cat having to have shots be for being neutered that bull i pick up strays all the time around my area and we take them to a vet that helps strays to be fixed and this is done all in one day i keep a eye on them for 24 hours them put them back ware i took them from maybe you should find a new vet. call a few vets to find the one you need you can even call your loco aspa for help.|`|1e4385b333fdc39a5947962d4e029837aa	Male cats don't go in heat.

97cea69af418b36fa64d887915f51776aa	Hey, before you house any fish in such tank you have to rinse it several times and get a soft sponge and wash the tank with it with just water several times, dry it with a towel and let it sit in an insect free place for 2 days, then you need to go to the pet store (one that sells fish, aquariums and such) and buy an aquarium cleaner, i use the one called "Safe & Easy" and it's non-toxic to fresh and saltwater fish and can be used to cleans everything that concerns aquariums. I get mine from this place: <a href="http://www.petco.com/product/5932/Aquarium-Pharmaceuticals-Safe-and-Easy-Aquarium-Cleaner.aspx?CoreCat=OnSiteSearch" rel="nofollow">http://www.petco.com/product/5932/Aquari...</a><br>  <br>  Read the direction and clean the tank with a new smooth sponge and rinse it well after washing, dry it and let it stand for a day or two and you should be ready to start your aquarium again.<br>  <br>  Make sure you replace your broken filter(which i am glad you did), and while you go to the pet store make sure you buy some water conditioner, aquarium salt, new net, filter media, heater if you don't already have one and of course new fish food. Do not use old fish food because they have already lost their nutrients and became pretty much useless, so new fish food is strongly recommended.<br>  <br>  You should pretty much know how to set a tank up by now so i am not going to go through that long process again but please please please make sure you rinse the gravel, rocks, and ornaments several time before putting them in the tank otherwise dusk and other harmful things will be transferred to the tank.<br>  <br>  It's important for you to know that you should cycle your tank again since you haven't used it in while and the filter is new, there for i usually get about three guppies to help cycle my 30 gallon tank.<br>  <br>  As usually new set tank will get cloudy, don't freak it's normal it's cycling that's all just need to have water testing kits to test your water tested to make sure everything is normal, cycling takes anywhere from 3-6 weeks for a 30 gallon but it could be done faster by not overfeeding the guppies used for cycling, and by changing 15% of the water weekly while it's cloudy to help keep ammonia and these harmful things down. It's also been noticed that i heated tank will cycle faster so keep the heater around 77 degrees F. <br>  <br>  Keep changing 15% of the water weekly until you start seeing the tank clearing, if you notice it starts to clear do not change the water just let the filter run and it should eventually clear on it's own, note that if you change more than 15% while it's cycling, it will do nothing than just worsen and slow the cycling process.<br>  <br>  It's alright for at least one or two of the guppies to die depending on how good of a job you did at setting up the tank. Usually none should die if you follow directions carefully but that's not always the case so that's why you need to buy the healthiest guppies available at the store.<br>  <br>  Note that cycling will take a very long time if the filter is not as powerful as it should for a 30 gallon. A good filter for a 30 would be one that filters 150-200 gallon per hour, the more the better but don't go buy one that is too powerful otherwise some fish will not live in such strong current of water.<br>  <br>  After the water turns crystal clear test it again or take a sample to the store and they should usually test it for free or for very little price but usually done for free. I usually let the tank run again for one more week after it finished cycling just to be on the safe side. I know it's very hard to wait all these time but let me tell you that it's worth waiting trust me on that, lots of people rush to get fish and wonder why they have died so quick.<br>  <br>  Now it's time to add fish, and since you want angels i would stick with a pair and nothing else, i would recommend two females because the males will often fight for territories. I wouldn't recommend a couple (1  male and 1 female) because they can have up to 1000 fry(babies) and you will  and up needing a huge tank. <br>  <br>  It might sound foolish but note that these fish get about 7 inches each as you will see in the following link how big you can expect them to get: <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKNnqVK2Fy0" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKNnqVK2F...</a> and i have seen them get way bigger with proper care.<br>  <br>  Do not forget to change 25% of the water weekly after having the angels, now can keep the guppies in a different tank if possible, if not, you can donate it to the store you got them from for some store credit or something.<br>  <br>  Sorry if my answer is too long but i want you to be successful with your tank as well as your fish, take care and always change the filter  cartridge every months but never clean the entire filter the same day you do the water chance otherwise the beneficial bacterias will all die and it's not good at all.<br>  <br>  Take care i wish you the best experience ever, need more help just click on my display picture and shoot me an e-mail and expect a response within 24 hours. Good luck.|`|RXYZb6bsaa	if you rinse it out.  Id say hose it down and then drain it twice, i do that after using bleach|`|VXZLYJzSaa	No, the tank needs to be emptied, cleaned and refilled with fresh water, the filters sponges, carbon and any other media its had in it will need replacing in case it has absorbed any detergents which will break down the natural slime coat that cover the Angelfish as well as other problems which won't do the fish much good.<br>  <br>  Once the tank is cleaned, refilled with fresh water and allowed to dechlorinate and get back to normal temperature (about 24-27c for Angels) you will need to cycle it and then you can happily add Angelfish to your tank again.|`|fnLhqbDpaa	I agree with everything monk said but i wanted to add that I would scrub every inch of that tank (empty tank that is) inside and out with salt (common table salt will do) and a little water and then rinse it for like 5 minutes ..make sure to scrub everything that came in contact with the soap with the salt and throw out any filters because they are now useless<br>  <br>   I would also put all the gravel in a bucket with alot of salt and really move it around with your hand ..and then rinse it a ton of times (its easier for me to use a colander ..just put in a pound or so of gravel at a time pour salt on it ..swish it around with your hands and then rinse it very good.|`|QxJVD1Flaa	Your filter will not filter out the soap. Get rid of all the water and clean the tank thoroughly, then cycle it before adding fish. <br>  <br>  P.S. 2 angels is all you can have in a 30 gallon tank.|`|NZn3gt0Raa	I would dump everything, rinse it out rinse out the filter and everything. Anglefish die very easily, but goodluck.

rhoNcYE8aa	I agree with everything Toy Fox Terrier stated.<br>  <br>  I suggest that you browse breeder's websites who have their pedigrees posted.  If the dogs are champions, or extensive champion lines, you will find line breeding occures in all of them.  If done correctly, line breeding can have amazing results.  It can either double up on the good genes, or double up on the bad.  To sum it up, if you take the best of the best, and breed it to a certain relative who is also best of the best, you will get amazing results.  That's how dogs become champions.  All of these show dogs that we see on tv, have line breeding in their background.<br>  <br>  I have been a breeder for over 10 years of AKC Champion line hounds.   The most amazing dogs that I've owned, have been line bred.  It usually shows as Grandfather being bred to grandaughter, or something similar.  You don't want to go any closer than that, like brother to sister.|`|TBd9CeYeaa	inbreeding or linebreeding??<br>  <br>  <br>  inbreeding like a brother and sister not very good<br>  <br>  <br>  but linebreeding although sounds really sick like a second cuz!<br>  <br>  can be healthy and better if your trying to keep the bloodline<br>  stronger then a lot of outcrossing|`|72895a389b784432eea922187fc22a83aa	You end up with the animal equivalent of a red neck.<br>  <br>  Cheers<br>  <br>  Lisa|`|bIaywrBCaa	Thi gives a little info.

236ec04bbd4131ca8c28403df2b8717caa	Sounds like you're doing a great job with them.  As long as they don't fight you on your hikes, and you stop for breaks and offer them water and snacks from time to time, they should be ok.  And carrying them for part of the way when they're tired is good too.<br>  <br>  I have an 8 year old miniature dachshund that I take on hikes with me as well.  While I don't like anywhere near the mountains, there is a museum by us that has a park with a 5 mile, hilly hiking trail that goes around a lake.  I always take plenty of water with us, and offer her some periodically, and like you, I carry her for small parts of the hike when she's tired.  She always ends the hike on her own, and passes out in the car on the way home, but she loves the hikes.  <br>  <br>  If you're really unsure, you can always talk to your vet, but I'd say as long as they're loving their hikes and time spent with you and each other, keep it up!!  It's a great way to keep in shape, for you AND for them!|`|iLrp65oXaa	I have a chihuahua/ pomeranian mix and I routinely walk him for 1.5 hours at a time.

Rhodesian Ridgebacks are wonderful breeds for outdoor activities like that, so are boxers.|`|cY8DgJv5aa	Every dog is different.

And when they get into the wrong home, "bad things" tend to occur. Which usually results in blame for the dog. I really hate to see that with such a beautiful breed, so unless the person plans on being active, and doing another activity with their dog (herding, agility, flyball, disc, obedience, skijoring etc. etc.) I typically will refrain from saying the breed.<br>  <br>  Beagles on the other hand, I tend to promote. Simply because they are given a reputation as a "dumb" breed, which they most certainly are not. My beagle is extremely well behaved, and intelligent. And I really do like to share such an amiable, smart breed with the world you know?<br>  The few downsides to a beagle is that, like a border collie they need a little more exercise than some breeds, and that you need a good fenced yard. But other than that, I believe they are a relatively easy breed.|`|fOLO4TNhaa	I do to people that have own dogs before & to people that requirements fit my breed. <br>  <br>  If every single quality they are looking for & need, fit my breed why not tell them!? <br>  <br>  If the person does not provide the right or enough information, has not owned dogs before then no.<br>  <br>  But when answering those type of questions not to many people actually fit my breed but other breeds.

Tell me about your family and situation and I will help you find a dog that matches up.|`|uJES9DrYaa	I would not recommend my breed. 1. of all they are Doberman Pinschers and they need a firm hand and need an alpha all times, 2. they need lots of training, 3. they need time and alot of exercice<br>  if i do recomend a Doberman is to some one I know will be the alpha in the pack and has the time for it. I would never recomend a Dobe to the assholes around my neighbors as i live in dose bad parts of town and i am worried that my breed will land in the wrong hands just like pit bulls and Rottweiler's and GSD. you would not belive how many stray dogs are in my neighborhood, and how many times i have called animal control.|`|AlAqoQABaa	I have 2 pit bulls and a border collie. I rescue dogs who need homes but specialize in pit bulls. I would always recommend a pit bull who has been bred correctly and trained properly. They are truly great dogs. I would not,however, recommend a border collie because of their many quirks and intense need to work. I have only had one border collie, which we have discussed, so my experience wouldn't be enough to recommend them. I have owned, rehabilitated, and bred numerous pit bulls and have never had any problems with that breed.|`|BYL1tSGKaa	I own a mutt and a Pit Bull, I do recommend mutts but always from shelters. I usually tell them to talk to the people at the shelter so they can choose according to their lifestyle. Shelters have mutts and pure bred dogs.  <br>  If their LifeStyle seems to fit with them owning a Pit Bull then I have no problem suggesting a Pit Bull but if they are really laid back I will not suggest a Pit Bull.|`|uKOYK1Lvaa	Not unless I know the person, and really, truly believe that the dog will be happy and safe there.<br>  <br>  I am this way with most breeds, but especially with mine.<br>  <br>  I am the anti-breed(s), I make sure to relay all the bad FIRST and try to stop them there. Might be horrible, but I just want what's best for the dogs, and most people get my breeds for all the wrong reasons (namely because they are beautiful).|`|AA10712651	I always tell anyone that is interested in the breed of dog that I raise (Shih-tzu) to give it plenty of thought. They are high maintenance and can be very costly to keep them looking nice. If you don't have time or interest in learning the grooming (even if you have the money to keep them groomed there is a lot of maintenance in between groomings) look for another breed. Also Shih-tzu can often not be so good around small children. They are PEOPLE dogs  hence they don't do well if left alone long periods at a time. They are hard to housebreak, very stubborn. Time time time is what it takes with a Shih-tzu. I'm just as quick to tell people the bad as well as the good. Really don't want to see any of my puppies end up in a rescue. I hate to see anyone buy a dog without doing research on the breed. Just because they LOOK like something you would like to have doesn't mean that breed is suited for your life style. Just like me ..I love the looks of a blood hound. but........ they fling slobber, have to have a fenced area and can be very energetic ..need lots of exercise ....so doesn't fit my life style as much as I love the looks of them.|`|TBd9CeYeaa	i show my collies but the way i get recommended is by others who have got a puppy from me before or my vet cause he knows all my dogs and knows how well i care for them and knows when i have pups available cause the mother goes in to see him before and after she has them plus my puppies go to see him 5 time before going to their new homes <br>  <br>  also the show ring the other handlers and other breeders will know when they don't have any pups avilable and someone is asking but also by kids in the area how know your dogs and play with them start telling everyone once your dog has them  its called word of mouth<br>  <br>  and it can get out there but if the puppies are not strong and healthy <br>  it can be potty mouth<br>  <br>  once you become known as someone who cares and takes great care of the parents and puppies it will be easy to get recommended just ask you vet to recomment if any one is interested that what i do and its great cause if your vet recommend's someone to get a pup from you you know your vet thinks they are good enough and they take care of their pets cause they where at your vets witch means they take care of their pet|`|U4cYbkNQaa	My favorite breed is the Miniature pincher. I wouldn't recommend this dog to people who don't like barking and urinating all over the house. Yes, they are hard to house break, no matter what anyone says! They do however love you more than anything in the world and are very loyal.|`|B462BQYzaa	i ask them their needs and wants as well as their accomodations.  I don't go promoting the breed i love because i want everyone to have them, i only promote them to ppl who can handle them, provide for them, etc.|`|9aKp5OMNaa	because i have a pitbull i promote the breed to show them that they are one of the best breeds out there and that there not going to maul some one to death|`|zituIhQ2aa	absolutely not... takes a dedicated person with the right lifestyle for my breed

She needs medication from a vet.  Do not put anything into her eyes until a vet approves it.  Eye infections are very serious and nothing to mess around with.  Once her sight is gone, it's gone forever. Take a sick day tomorrow or go in late.

gjD8pndjaa	sidewinding?  not sure if thats what you're describing or not.  but thats just an improper gait.<br>  <br>  if thats not what you're talking about, I'm not sure.  could just be that they're walking so fast|`|1prFATCBaa	The "technical" term is sidewinding or crabbing- and it is, unfortunately, common in a lot of sporting and some herding and working breeds.<br>  <br>  It is generally caused by improper balance in the front and rear angulation combined with short backs:  <br>  <br>  The most common problem is dogs with straight shoulders and over angulated rears- the dogs have to move their rear's to the side to get them away from the front end, or they would interfere (hit) their front feet when they move.<br>  <br>  The more that breeders that breed for that over-angulated rear (because it looks flashy on the side movement), the fewer dogs you will see that move clean coming and going.<br>  <br>  Another thing you will begin to see with the overangulated rears and straight shoulders is sloping toplines== dogs running uphill!  (think of the "show shepherds"- who are an extreme of this)<br>  <br>  If breeders would go back to form follows function- and breed for dogs that are able to do what they are bred to do- rather than breed for dogs that can make it around the ring looking great- but would break down if asked to work for a living--we would see far less of this common movement issue.|`|O6SBsgO8aa	It's called side winding and is a common thing in some dogs. Not something you want in a show dog and it could be his breed.  Boarders also usually "hug" the ground when they work the field.|`|7fb9ba045d96cd607bd916c4c659256caa	My schnauzer does that when i walk him on a leash . I thought it was because he did not like the leash.|`|P8Q39vA4aa	Well its not just a herding dog thing cause my one of my weimaraners does it. Im not sure why she does it. she doesnt do it in the show ring only for walks sometimes.|`|hbj6vGE4aa	Hm, I have never heard it called side winding, but I have heard it called crabbing.  It is not a desirable trait to have, it means that there is a misbalance or disproportion somewhere.  But really, it only matters in conformation shows.  I am sure that a BC who had the tendancy to crab would be able to work just fine.<br>  <br>  ADD:  Man xtccwc, would you please judge my aussie?!  LOL!
5z0yPLcBaa	ITS HILARIOUS!!!!!! at night, go to a ranch that has cows, when the cows are sleeping, sneak up and push them over, some fall asleep standing!|`|puMZ0bgmaa	Yes cow tipping is a real thing.  You go out at night (this is so you don't get caught, it has nothing to do with the actual cow tipping) and find a cow sleeping standing up.  Push it over.  This is what "cow tipping" is.  Can all standing, sleeping cows be tipped?  No.  Will tipping a cow injure it?  No.<br>  <br>  Please note I don't endorse or approve of cow tipping, I am just answering this question.
280d96ad7b5e9ffad03a34a66cac5db0aa	Consider buying a car harness for her instead of a cage, if cages are what make her anxious.<br>  <br>  While she's in the car, provide a tasty bone like a Nylabone Healthy Edibles bone. (Avoid rawhide, pigs' ears or Greenies. They can't be digested.) You can also give her a Kong toy, stuffed with whatever she likes best. (Peanut butter, yogurt, kibble, treats, use your imagination.) <br>  <br>  Rub some lavender on her collar. It won't be a magic fix, but studies have shown that lavender does indeed have a calming effect on animals, including humans and dogs. For instance, babies in lavender-scented rooms tend to fuss less and sleep more soundly than babies without the scent. <br>  <br>  Purchase Rescue Remedy. I know several people who have used it successfully. It's a flower essence concoction, humans, dogs and cats can use it. It's harmless, but tends to help relax the user. <br>  <br>  Purchase a DAP collar or spray.

Over the counter tranquilizers and 'calming medicines' just doesn't settle well with me.  If I were you, I'd call the vets office and ask them to tell me specifically what I should buy or at least a few choices that they recommend for my exact breed of dog.<br>  <br>  **Hmmm....  That makes no sense to me.  A vet told you to look for a calming medication to help ease your dogs anxiety, but couldn't personally suggest anything.  Then what was the point of telling you to find something?  lol  If even a licensed veterinarian can't think of anything that would be safe for your dog, I wouldn't trust anything that anyone else suggests.  In all honesty, if you simply MUST bring your dog with you, then you may just have to deal with the crying.  I'd be too nervous to give her anything.  Another option you may have though is to have your dog sedated (at the vets office) prior to the trip.  She'll sleep most of the way there.

1prFATCBaa	Yes you can show both of them in the same class.  When you get your entry, however, take note of what your armband number is- then get to the show early enough to talk to the steward; the steward will have to ask permission of the judge to move one of your dogs so that you have at least two dogs between your dogs (trust me- you don't want your dogs going in back to back- you need at least 2- preferably 3- in between)<br>  <br>  You cannot show a female in season in ANY AKC obedience trial- that includes Rally.  Some trials will offer a refund with a Veterinarian certificate that your dog is in season-= some do not.  Check your premium list.  But DO NOT take your female in season to the show for any reason what so ever!<br>  <br>  Have Fun-- Rally is GREAT!!|`|P8Q39vA4aa	Um no in AKC obedience and rally you can not show a ***** in heat, in fact a ***** in heat can't be any where near the rings. If you do bring a ***** in heat near by you can be thrown out for breaking the rules. <br>  <br>  Yes you can show two dogs in the same obedience/ rally class just ask for them to be separated when you go get your numbers. So ask for one to be put later in the line up.
AA10570283	I would have to say the day that our cat Pickles chased my two aunts out of the house. See everyone was afraid of him because he was lets just say very mean. If he couldn't get a hold of you to bite he would chase you around the house and go for your ankles. One day my two aunts came over to visit and Pickles came into the kitchen and took after their ankles chasing them right out the back door. He was a very evil cat. Even the paper boy was afraid of him when he was outside.|`|AA10293793	let's see... we have just adopted 2 kittens that we found in the desert. one male and one female. the female is a daredevil if i ever so one - serious thrill issues there. they had just barely been wheaned when we found them and the female had a very interesting habit for the first few days. every time she got hungry she would try to find a nipple on her brother... i'm sure you can guess what she found instead.... but it never stopped her from trying :)|`|AA12091077	When our dogs were small (yes I know you said cat...

When my father woke she jumped from the bed and walked just a few steps in front of my dad, waiting for him to follow her. So my dad followed her and found our main door wide open.... :o) It was a topic for us for a long time of how intelligent she was. <br>  <br>  Enjoy your cat, they are good pets....

Aunque hay quienes los reùnen con otros peces de otras especies y se?alan no tener problemas con ello, el betta es agresivo y territorial por naturaleza.<br>  <br>  Es un pez de aguas templadas, se recomienda tenerlo a una temperatrua entre 24 y 28 grados centìgrados, temperaturas menores pueden causar que tu pez enferme o entre en un perìodo de poca actividad.<br>  <br>  Al ser un pez laberìtnido, respira oxìgeno del agua a travès de sus branquias pero principalmente resira oxìgeno aeròbico, es decir, del mismo aire como si fuera un animal pulmonado (pero no lo es)<br>  <br>  Esta particularidad permite que el betta viva en peceras sin oxigenaciòn y pràcticamente sin sistema de filtrado.<br>  <br>  Habràs observado que estos animalitos pueden vivir en espacios sumamante reducidos, lo cual no significa que sea lo ideal. Un tanque con al menos  de 6 a 10 litros es mejor. Tampoco necesitaràs una gran pecera pues adevertiràs que adoptarà un espacio para nadar y difìcilmente visitarà todo el espacio que le otorgues.<br>  <br>  Para su alimentaciòn es un pez con hàbitos mas bien carnìvoros, pero en las tienddas del ramo encontrarás alimento especìfico para esta especie. Te sugiero que no alimentes con hojuelitas pues suelen rechazarlas, lo mejor son pellets que son como peque?as grajeas las cuales aceptan con facilidad.<br>  <br>  De estos pellets bastaràn de 3 a 4 perlitas por la ma?ana y otras tantas por la tarde. No sobrealimentes para evitar contaminaciòn del agua y una posible congestiòn del pez que terminarà matàndolo.<br>  <br>  los cambios de agua no son muy exigentes, basta con cambiar el agua cada 8 o 15 dìas, eso sì... asegurate de utilizar agua libre de cloro.
pmrKsxHTaa	That happened with my 2 female cats too.  I read online that they can go into heat and it will last for up to a week, have one day off, then go into heat again.  Every cat is different, and the cycles wont stop until they breed or get fixed.  It sucks!  I just gave them plenty of attention and gave them toys to play with to distract them.  I just got them fixed, and it was so worth it.  Good luck!|`|70878cc978ee2e4a79b3b53284340f9caa	Yes,it's normal for females to be in heat off and on from March through September.

jTeDpBjlaa	A snake's body is it's arm. If he doesn't feel stable (like he might fall) he'll squeeze to hang on tightly. If you're sweatty (or sticky), he might feel like he's squeezing when he's simply STUCK to your skin, and is trying to crawl around. (I enjoy that with my boas! It's like a massage!)<br>  <br>  No, he's not trying to eat you. Snakes KNOW that you're too big for them to eat! <br>  <br>  As for the snake opening his mouth? They open their mouths ever so slightly to allow their tongues to come out (at least, most of mine do)<br>  <br>  If more than "just slightly" ... listen for any crackling (could be a respiratory infection). <br>  <br>  Snakes also yawn, like we do. They also will "yawn" to adjust their jaws, especially after eating.<br>  <br>  The snake could also be annoyed if not comfortable being held by you. (Is this a "new" snake? How long have you had this snake or any snake? You might just need to hang out and learn your snake's body language! :)<br>  <br>  Basically, I need more information.|`|pcvcMePXaa	umm it means you need to feed him maybe usually what they do to food he might think you taste good next time put some hot sauce on your arm for extra flavor he might like that|`|PTP8ptDbaa	he is unhappy and wants to "bite something!"|`|2Z7u3Fksaa	Ball Pythons like to squeeze tightly because they are trying to get more warm by using your body heat<br>  The fact that he opened his mouth a little bit just means he was readjusting his jaw<br>  no worries...|`|AA12116854	He's hungry? He's proabably trying to squeeze what he hopes is dinner (your arm) that he can squish dead and then swallow you. You need to get this dude something to eat.|`|Cn9WIJhgaa	Its trying to cut of oxygen and blood flow and then kill you, then eat you!|`|oUTb1zNkaa	I wouldn't worry about the squeezing, as long as he isn't hurting you, and he isn't hissing or S coiling. He's probably just trying to absorb your body heat. And opening his mouth is how he realigns his jaw. Or he could be yawning-Yes snakes do yawn, but the yawn usually lasts a little longer than jaw alignment.|`|uOV5a30Baa	well the squeezing is normal but when he opens his mouth he is saying that hey i am hungry and he wants food so i would try feeding him a lill more and see if that makes any difference at all|`|f8fd3947de524bc5d4cb84112a232456aa	that is how python get there food in the wild <br>  u should watch it with the python there not the best Animal to have|`|P0FKlVRGaa	it means it doesnt like how your treating it i dont think u should  hold it so much if u do but i hope i helped and i hope u find a solution|`|MnaIOnqraa	Nom nom nom nom nom|`|j0zhKhIEaa	thts weird ive never known a ball python trying to consrict you u should see a vet|`|0UkJKFRhaa	No, It is just natural. Just relax and let nature take its course.|`|LDWuRWTjaa	NOM! He's going to eat you in your sleep. :) Have fun!|`|ptKp7mBJaa	Does a hiss accompany the open mouth? Is there wheezing? How long have you had it and how much do you handle it?<br>  <br>  If he is hissing a bit and taking quick breaths while he squeezes you then it is defensive behavior. Since snakes have no arms they hold on with their whole body and squeeze a little if they think they are going to fall or be pulled of by something that may harm them. If he tends to tense up when you try to get him off it is because he is afraid.<br>  <br>  If his open mouth seems to be to facilitate his breathing or if there is a wheeze then it can be respiratory in which case you should consult a vet.<br>  <br>  If you just got the snake and have not held it much then it is just not used to being handled and is responding defensively. Over time as he gets used to being handled he should start to relax. Sometimes they even curl up and fall asleep in your arms:)|`|Kv1l9YKgaa	he wants to kill you....<br>  make sure to keep the lid on toghtly at night<br>  and dont let the ball python bite hahahahahahaha
fSxvrerTaa	Well depends. <br>  <br>  From my experience.<br>  <br>  I had two boys neutered at 6 months nearly on the dot and neither of them have sprayed. My white boy sometimes shakes his tail but nothing ever comes out.<br>  <br>  Now I have toms who have been neutered but way past the 6 month and they still spray even though they have been neutered. <br>  <br>  Ultimately it pry depends on the cat.|`|yyf5N7Ogaa	I don't know what planet some of these folks are living on, but NO, neutering the cat will in no way guarantee it will stop spraying. There is no operation that will make it stop spraying permanently. Neutering removes the sexual reason for marking but not the territorial reasons. <br>  <br>  Once a male cat has started spraying, it can be difficult to stop. That is why kittens are best neutered at an early age. Neutering the cat will often lessen the frequency of marking territory and sometimes will eventually stop it altogether. But there are no guarantees. Any other answer is totally bogus. <br>  <br>  If the cat can still pee, it can still mark territory.|`|avJsey6uaa	It all depends. It is always best to neuter a tom as SOON as they are old enough, at five months. Waiting too long is a bad idea, they usually have some pretty well-grounded habits. I'm actually not entirely sure if neutering stops their ability to spray. Both my male cats were unfortunately spayed too late. One tom was a year old, the other two, and they went right on peeing on everything, which saddens me because that means they can't come inside unless it's night and I lock them up in the room with the litter box, and even then they will still spray it they so like. It looks like they're spraying to me, when I catch them sniffing around a neighbor's tires, little imps. <br>  <br>  BUT I would not be hasty to generalize. Neutering is still a WONDERFUL option. Less homeless kittens in this world. And neutering is your best bet to make him stop spraying. I struck out when I hoped the neutering would reduce spraying, but that doesn't mean it won't work on yours. It all depends on the cat. My older one went right on spraying and fighting other cats, but no babies. My other went on spraying, but stopped fighting, and no babies. I'm very glad I neutered them.|`|AA11015395	Only if you make it very clear to the vet that he will no longer spray after hes neutered. because if they don't remove there testicles witch hold a sack that can still spray, most vets remove the testicles when neutering but i heard of a few that didn't and the cat still was able to spray so just make sure you tell the vet why your having your cat fixed you wont the spraying to stop.|`|AA11044762	I will agree with last answer NO there is no guarantee!!!!!!|`|O1owwVXIaa	yes, it will|`|bicAgoycaa	Spray yes ... but they will still "mark" their territory.

Cats are generally more solitary and are much less work. You don't have to take them for walks everyday, only have to clean the litter out (as opposed to letting a dog out and then having to walk around the backyard checking for poo), and you can leave them alone throughout the day without having to worry about a whole lot. Dogs, on the other hand, are generally much more social but are a lot more work. A dog needs to be exercised everyday and if you don't have the time for that or you are gone throughout much of the day, I would not recommend getting one since it is not fair to the animal. Whichever one you choose, you can spend much less than $2000 by going to a local shelter and saving an animal's life. You can go to Petfinder.com to see pets in your area. Also, if you consider a dog, get a breed that will be good in your housing situation. For example, if you live in an apartment, a husky isn't going to be the best breed since they are extremely active.|`|T4tM4NWKaa	get a dog. a shih tzu . they do not shed|`|WwTxboY9aa	Just want ot say that " made in glamourous USA " is talking crap about cats making crazy noises at midnight.....weirdo.|`|2nvTL4giaa	What is both?

If they are responsible breeders they would not place a dog they are not confident will successfully adapt to her new home.  if I was in your position I wouldn't be too worried.|`|bFzu835Aaa	It doesn't matter the age of the dog. People adopt older dogs from shelters all the time, if it didn't turn out to be a loving, loyal relationship people wouldn't continue to do so hundreds of times a day. <br>  <br>  If you take good care of the dog, treat it well, and give it time to form a bond, ANY dog regardless of age, breed, etc can form a strong loving bond with you. <br>  <br>  Aggression should be something you talk to the current owners about. If they're good breeders they should be breeding for temperament as well as looks and should be producing healthy (mentally and physically) well socialized dogs.

ijvHIgfnaa	Yep, probably because it is unaccustomed to your touch yet. It's still defensive, but after a few months of getting to know you, your hamster should be able to willingly crawl into your hand without biting. <br>  <br>  But don't try to pet your hamster when she's sleeping because her natural instinct is to bite others in order to protect herself. I've had my hamster for one and a half years, and the only time she bites me is if she can taste food on my finger and decides to start gnawing on it as well.|`|eCNrkHqiaa	yes because when they are older they will be used to being touched and will be tamer.|`|WW5h93nTaa	they might bite to protect themselves although there the easiest to tame|`|KLKcVwOQaa	yes they do and it is because they are Young and they want to show you that they are still able to protect them selves|`|EW7mVhlRaa	Yeah, they are just biting to protect themselves from danger and sort .

My buns do the same thing. They lift their rears but put their heads down. My little buck would sit there for a solid hour if you keep petting him.<br>  <br>  It doesn't have a thing to do with mating. It's normal behavior. I call it "crouching rabbit".<br>  <br>  <br>  If you want to find out the sex of your bun, you need to hold your bun firmly (supporting the back), flip the bunny over and gently press above the genital region. If it's a buck, you will be able to tell. If its a doe, you will be able to tell. That is, if the bun is not too young to tell.|`|Cp8Y0cHcaa	Could be a male or female, as both do that when they get excited.<br>  <br>  If your bunny is male and is 3 months and over, you can easily check without having to handle it to, as when it does lift up its tail in excitement, in males its very easy to see testicles. <br>  <br>  Or stretch it legs to see the testicles, older the male easier to tell the difference then to apply pressure to the area, which no bunny likes.<br>  <br>  Also males are allot more horny then females, they spray, hump, if its spraying, humping things, its a male.<br>  <br>  Females get aggressive instead, bite, growl, ect to show their hormone frustration|`|Idunjsxjaa	Depending on your rabbits age, it may be time to have your rabbit fixed!  Sexing your rabbit isn't hard.  I bought, what I thought was a female rabbit back in November.  A couple weeks ago I was lying on the floor playing with the rabbit and saw what female rabbits do no have!  :)  To make sure I wasn't seeing things, I wrapped my rabbit in a towel snugly!  Then I flipped the rabbit on it's back and opened the towel just a bit and sure enough, my rabbit is a boy.  This works in my favor because it's less expensive to fix a male than a female.  I've never encountered a rabbit that lifts it's rear end while being petted so my thought is it's hormone related.  My rabbit usually snuggles down to the floor when I pet him.

Pit bulls are good natured, loyal dogs when trained correctly. It is a good start that he is only 3 months. You could fix this problem with enough patience and time. Pit bulls can be stubborn at times and you will need to be consistent. if you do not want him to bit than he cannot bite period. if you play dominance games such as tug of war, stop, as this can increase his biting. You have to firmly establish yourself as a leader being assertive but not mean. A firm no and taking away what he is biting will work. if he is biting you or objects you cannot pick up and move than i would suggest a bitter apple or red pepper mix that can go on you and furniture. (test a small spot first.) The taste will discourage him from wanting to put his mouth on things. Start obedience training right away if you haven't already. Putting the dog into a sit or stay or distracting him with food or a toy will also work. Remember to be firm but not cruel. If you need further information please contact via email and i will help you. saryejade@aol.com|`|fTQmn5V3aa	Exercise your dog - this is a highly motivated athletic dog. You need to be taking that pup for five or six walks a day. Don't walk him until he's exhausted, but walk him until he's tired. Make your walks longer and longer each day as he grows, and incorporate running when his joints are strong enough.<br>  <br>  Make sure your dog has plenty of toys that he can safely chew on, and rotate them so he doesn't get bored. Kong and other companies make toys specifically for heavy-duty chewers. Some of these can be stuffed with peanut butter and/or treats to engage your dog's curiosity.<br>  <br>  DO NOT EVER put your hands in or near your dog's mouth in play. I've seen people let their pups "mouth" them when the pup is small, and then get angry when the no-longer-small dog bites them. Stupid. <br>  <br>  DO NOT EVER give your pup fuzzy things to chew/play with. Stupid.<br>  <br>  DO NOT EVER smack, hit, kick, or otherwise physically hurt your pup. These dogs have a strike response that makes cobras jealous - they can and will bite very, very fast.<br>  <br>  You have a high-maintenance dog. He requires far more attention and training than most pets out there. Get him into puppy obedience NOW, and follow up with basic and advanced obedience. Keep him active and occupied, treat him with firmness and respect, let him know that you are consistent and that you can be trusted, and you can have a wonderful companion.|`|8afEVrT2aa	He's still a puppy. He is going to bite things for awhile. He's teething. Get him a chew toy like a rubber toy, or a rawhide bone. Also, yelping loudly when he bites you lets him know that it hurts.

yLiOgVEYaa	sorry your kitty has a UTI. glad you caught it early and went to the vet :)<br>  my vet also recommended me to switch my 16yr old to wet food. she also has only ate dry food and didn't really like the wet. she just licked it a lot, but didn't eat it all. i've tried mixing the wet in with her dry. again, she just licks it. but i still mix it in for her. she seems to eat more and more of it. i know the wet food is good for them as it has more moisture for hydration and helps when they use the litter box for #2. as they get older the less they need to strain. (so my vet tells me) so, just keep trying is all i can tell you. that's what im doing :) good luck!|`|K0uTjeWiaa	Any wet foods will do fo that problem but if you want to feed healthy then you will learn about nutrition.

Food allergies are very common when feeding dry foods. Rashes, scabs behind the tail and on the chin are all symptoms<br>  The problems associated with Dry food is that they are loaded with grains and carbohydrates which many cats (carnivores) cannot process.  Also, Most of the moisture a cat needs is suppose to be in the food but in<br>  Dry, 95% of it is zapped out of dry foods in the processing. Another thing, most use horrible ingredients and don't use a muscle meat as the primary ingredient and use vegetable based protein versus animal.

Finally a vet with half a clue.<br>  <br>  Below are my suggestions for getting a cat to eat wet food.  <br>  <br>  Also, if the c/d is a no go I wouldn't worry too much.  But getting your cat onto canned food - any brand - IS important.  So look through the list provided and try any of them.  So long as you stick with one of these better quality, grainless (or at least containing no really bad grains) foods, your kitty will likely be just fine.<br>  <br>  Also avoid fishy foods.  <br>  <br>  1. Buy the best. See <a href="http://www.catinfo.org/commercialcannedfoods.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.catinfo.org/commercialcannedf...</a> for suggestions, and also see my blog on identifying good foods <a href="http://blog.360.yahoo.com/blog-ytgWjlI5er8IWP.paz_7JTvgf_5D?p=59.">http://blog.360.yahoo.com/blog-ytgWjlI5e...</a> Although you don't want to feed fishy foods more than 2-3 times per week (<a href="http://www.littlebigcat.com/index.php?action=library&act=show&item=whyfishisd..." rel="nofollow">http://www.littlebigcat.com/index.php?ac...</a> ), you might want to get a few. The stronger smell may be more appealing, and perhaps you could use it as a topping on other foods as well. <br>  <br>  2. Buy as many varieties as you can. Get different brands and different flavors. Also try different textures - some prefer mushy food, others prefer ones that are chunkier.  You just never know what's going to appeal to a cat.<br>  <br>  3. Offer a teaspoonful or so of the new food in a separate bowl at feeding time. Do this at every meal. The idea is that kitty will finally realize it's food and will give it a shot. By offering just a small amount, you'll avoid digestive upsets should he or she be willing to give it a try.<br>  <br>  4. If he tries any, note which brand/flavor it was. You may then want to focus on that brand or that flavor in other brands. But don't be fooled. The cat may eat it all up but then never want to eat it again. So before buying a case of a food that he seems to like, make sure he's going to continue going for it.<br>  <br>  5. You can try putting a smear of food on his nose or mouth. That'll cause him to lick it. If he likes it, he may try more.<br>  <br>  6. Bribes. Crush some kibble and sprinkle it over the top. Try fish or liver flakes, parmesan cheese, a drop of soy sauce, meaty baby food (with no added onion or garlic), whatever it takes.  CATNIP!  If your cat doesn't seem to go for any of these bribes, try dried catnip flakes.  Some have had success doing this.<br>  <br>  NOTE:  You can also try mixing dry and wet together, but if you do you should not leave the mixture down for longer than 1/2 hour or so.  The same is true if you're sprinkling the food with crushed kibble.  That's because when kibble gets wet it can turn into a bowl o' bacteria.  It's safe if eaten right away though.<br>  <br>  7. You can run the food (in a container of course) under hot or warm water or even nuke it for a few seconds to bring it to "mouse body temperature." This may also release the scent and that may draw the cat in.<br>  <br>  8. Don't try starving the cat into submission. That could ultimately be fatal. You may want to cut back a bit on the regular food so that hunger may encourage him to eat, but don't force the issue. As he starts eating more canned, you will decrease the amount of kibble he's getting. But just be sure that he gets enough to eat every day.<br>  <br>  Realize that you will waste food and money. Be patient and persistent. The results will be worth it!|`|AA11015395	the brand of dry food you feed your cat just try there wet food but don't take the dry food away completely give the cat both because the needs both and always make sure there is clean fresh water down each day and Alto of it keep trying till you find a wet food he likes even if you have to cook for him .have you try ed tuna in water our tuna you can even give him the water the tuna comes in|`|AA11044762	I work at a vet's office and they DO sell dry CD so try that also you can get the wet and dry and mix it together he may eat it better and if you want slowly put less and less dry if not I dont see a problem with just giving him dry CD|`|b9340e25c5c91b1731a01132aab4d92daa	Try some reduced sodium tuna mixed with it...juice too.

UTIs suck. My cat is 11, ate only dry food for the first 7 seven years of her life & also had to switch to wet food for health reasons. She is a very picky eater but made the switch just fine although it took some time. <br>  Since cats loathe change, you have to lull them into thinking nothing has changed. Don't put a large amount of wet food in with his dry. Start VERY slowly. Mix a tiny amount of the wet in with his dry food so he doesn't notice much and take baby steps until the ratio of wet-to-dry is reversed and, finally, there is only wet food in the bowl. Also don't try to make the change in just one day because that could cause digestive problems. 7-10 should work but some cats need more like 3 weeks.<br>  He will go along with it if you find a flavor he likes. (It shouldn't be too hard to find one as the food companies add fish oil to almost all types of wet food so the cats will like the taste.) <br>  And yes, I will take this opportunity to blast Hill's and most other commercial wet food. Cats have a very sophisticated alimentary system and need MEAT, not grain, yet most of these companies put a lot of cheap grains  and additives into their food. The best companies do not use animals by-products (including teeth & hair) and there are now a few that make grain-free food for cats (Evo/Innova, Wellness Formula & others).<br>  A vet's office is also a business, so of course they peddle certain products. It does not mean these products are superior.  It only means the vet gets a kickback. My cat's vet stocks Royal Canin, which, while fairly expensive, is pretty bad food.

e49180ed7f3e7b1742ab281bbccc8d17aa	I'm retired and I travel with my pets extensively.  I travel with 2 dogs, a cat and 4 finches.  One of the dogs sits on my lap (smaller than my purse), the other sleeps onn the floorboard of the passenger side.  My cat is in a travel kennel designed for a small to medium sized dog.  The birds are in a travel cage and shielded from sunlight with a light cotton terry towel.  <br>  <br>  First and foremost - have vaccination records of all your animals.  If any are on medications, have the medications in the original containers in the same place you keep all the animal records.  I have a small cloth bag that I keep tucked between the driver's seat and the console where I keep medications (including heartworm preventives, vaccination records, health certificates).  Keep a collar or harness on your pets with ID tags and current rabies tag.  For both dogs and cats (even if in a travel kennel), keep a long leash attached to the collar with the other end attached to the carrier or kennel.  Accidents happen.  I can't tell you how many times someone opened the car door and out ran their pet, frightened by lightening, a horn honking or trying to investigate the sound of another animal outside the vehicle.  I worked in a resort and heard about it time and time again.  Be ready and prepared for it. <br>  <br>  Also, there is the possibility that your car could be involved in an accident.  If the people are injured and have to be transported to a medical facility, it is so much easier for strangers to handle your pets if they are in travel kennels or already leashed.  It saves a lot of time, heartache and aggravation.<br>  <br>  When you stop for a meal or at a rest area, park in the shade with the windows (all of them) open about an inch to allow cross ventilation.  Have an extra key to the car door and leave the car running with the air conditioner on if the outside temperature is above 60 (sixty) degrees.  Even with the air conditioner on, leave all the windows open an inch.  Better still, take turns going inside so that at least one person is in the car with the pets.<br>  <br>  Outside temperature is below 60 (sixty) degrees?  Still park in the shade and leave all the windows open an inch.  Your animals need fresh air, cross-ventilation - even if you just have two cats in a carrier or kennel.  That car will still get uncomfortably hot if parked in direct sunlight and left with the windows closed for as little as 10 minutes.  <br>  <br>  As soon as you return to your car, check your pets.  Make sure they are not panting or panicked.  All rest stops should be time spent with your pets.  Let them out of the crate, let them roam around the car.  Offer them treats.  Do this when the car is in park and not moving.  1500 miles is a really long distance to stay in a crate if a car ride is something new to them.<br>  <br>  Lodging.  Most Howard Johnsons allow pets.  In fact, most motels allow pets.  Check this out along your route and make plans to stay where your pets are welcome.  Once you get settled inside the room, let the cats out to roam around.  Set up the little box and let them know where it is.  They'll love you for thinking of them.  <br>  <br>  Don't invite an accident!  If anyone needs to leave the room, make sure your cats are back in the crate or kennel before someone opens the motel room door - especially if the door opens to the outside.  Let them back out of the cage when the person has returned to the room and the door is again closed and locked.  <br>  <br>  If you are going to stay in any motel for more than one night, make sure your cats are secured in their crates in the room when you leave the room for meals or sightseeing.  That will keep them from escaping in an unfamiliar area when the housekeeper comes in to clean your room.  Don't rely on a "Do Not Disturb" sign.  Those can fall off the door or be blown off with even a gentle breeze.  Safety first - always.<br>  <br>  Don't get a crate or kennel or carrier just before the trip and put your cats in it just as you are getting ready to leave.  Let your cats discover it.  Leave it with the cage door standing open in the living room or bedroom or any room that your cats frequent.  Put a dish of food in the cage to lure them into it.  Let them discover it and see that it's not a bad place at all.  This will reduce the amount of stress your cats might endure on departure day.  <br>  <br>  Think of them as infants your are traveling with - always.  Only then will the experience be pleasant, trouble-free and enjoyable for all.|`|0b6691be66651a8e0f44ae92e9fce0a2aa	Hi there...here's a way to help your two cats adjust for long-distance road travelling with food, water, litterbox and stretch time.<br>  <br>  If your kitties are nervous while in a moving car here are some useful tips to help them become desensitized before leaving for your long journey.<br>  <br>  If you have a week to a few weeks before your trip the best solution is to begin a treat reward inside the travel crate before you place it into the car so begin feeding your cats now until you leave for your trip inside the crate fulltime. If kitties will not go into the crate begin by feeding them in front/around of the crate then gradually move the food dish into the crate...eventually when kitties are okay with eating in the crate gently close the door, but open it immediately while kitties are eating to help them acclimate to this. After kitties appears to be okay with eating inside the crate (sometimes it will happen within a couple days) you can begin with the next step...<br>  <br>  First take the kitties in the car (with crate and food dish) and sit quietly with them and the crate door opened and offer them delicious treats inside the crate, which rewards them for accepting the new environment. Do this several times throughout the day and when they are showing signs of being more comfortable then you can move onto the next step. The idea here is to help the cats learn to find the crates a secure and comfortable space since they will need to be secured there for lengths at time. <br>  <br>  Just start the car (no driving) and offer rewarding treats again in the crate/bed still with door opened and also closed. After a few times then start the car and move it back and forth in that little area again offer treats in the crate with door opened and closed (by the way, chicken baby food is usually is an excellent treat just make sure this is Gerbers "2nd" NOT 3rd as the ingredients Onion and Garlic are toxic to kitty). Again, when kitties shows sign of comfort then try a drive around the block once then several times gradually with the crate door closed this time. <br>  <br>  Make sure they can see you when you travel as they find comfort with their owner's familiar face and can easily hear your voice as well. If you don't have anyone traveling with you then place the crates on the front passenger seat and on the passenger floor or in the back seat facing one another if they are very bonded to one another to help minimize stress. Make it easy enough so that you safely drive and by being able to occasionally put your fingers through the holes to comfort both kitties with your touch too.<br>  <br>  Most cats sleep during road trips, however just remember to stop often enough to allow the cats to come out of the crates for a nice stretch and to use the litter box as most cats find it difficult to go while in a moving car. It's best to allow them to stay within the vehicle rather than take a chance on letting them go outside for a walk even on harness.  If anything startles them they may bolt away in the strange area and become lost.  Also it's safer to keep the cats resting in their travel crates rather than free roam your vehicle while you're in motion. The reason is that there has been several people who have had seriously dangerous accidents because the cats decided to hide under the foot petals. <br>  <br>  Keep a little dish of food in the crate(s) so they can snack when they feel hungry.  While letting them out for a stretch see if they'll also take in some water as well.  <br>  <br>  Keep in mind the above method is the healthiest so that you don't need to tranquilize the cats, which should be reserved as a last resort if the cats appear anxious in the final stages of the training. The method I described above is how zoo trainers teach their animals to be managed without sedation. <br>  <br>  I hope all of you will have a safe and happy long journey.|`|2257894b4b4b95756ccaf550397cc5faaa	The easyest way to travel with a cat is to get a med-large dog kennel, big enought to fit a small litter box and a blanket.  Not only will your cat feel safe in the kennel he'll also be safe.  You will always know where he is and wont have to worry about him escaping!  Most kennles come with food and water dishes that hang on the door, just keep a small amount of water in the water dish.  Good luck!!|`|51b8e9670dce48587fea2184894c851aaa	Make sure your cat will be welcome everywhere you plan to stop. Many hotels and motels allow pets, so do your homework first, and find out the rules, before planning your itinerary.<br>  You don't want to expose your cat to any more risks than necessary, so make sure his shots are current before travelling. It would be also be a good time to ask your veterinarian if she recommends a mild tranquilizer if your cat is particularly nervous about travelling. Be sure to bring a health certificate and proof of vaccination with you -- you may need both when travelling through some states.<br>  A 500 mile or more trip is not the occasion to test your cat's travelability. Accustom her to her carrier by letting her sleep in it, then take her on increasingly longer local drives well in advance of your trip. Make travel a fun occasion, with plenty of rewards, and your cat will soon be a seasoned veteran at travel.<br>  Invest in a good harness with securely attached ID tags. Include your name, address, phone number, as well as contact info for your vet. Leave your itinerary with your veterinarian in case they should receive a call that your cat has been found. Tattooing and microchipping are a plus. With his harness and a leash, you can take your cat out to stretch his legs on rest stops.|`|61f7e4f6e6d8d005d3d3804597387e57aa	The best thing to do is to take away food and water 8-10 hours before you pack up the cats and leave. I would give them a little bit of soft canned food on the drive - that way they are getting the food and water in one sitting. They are probably going to be a bit too nervous and out of sorts to drink water while driving, but after being in the car for 5-6 hours, they'll probably take a few bites of food. If you're driving straight through, they'll be okay with minimal food and water. Just make sure you feed them and give them water as soon as you arrive!<br>  <br>  There are also portable litterboxes you can buy. I would take them into the restroom at a rest stop and see if they'll use the litterbox in there.|`|b9afd847d6df2ee6f999e12aef74d34aaa	my cat is usually so traumatized by long trips, she won't eat, drink, poo, or pee until we get where we are going for the night. i bought some disposable litter boxes for the trip, you can find them at petsmart or petco.|`|952eba597ed3075133110e14f67d3815aa	i have a buddy who travels with her cats every six months to drive to texas she has gotten some small cat harnesses and puppy lines that she ties them up to so they can run a bit when she is out of car and they won't make a run for it. the harnesses stay on until she gets to her destination. she also uses med dog kennels. they get fed when she stops at a pet friendly hotel or motel. the kitty box i think she takes with her and lets them use it when she is out of car. not for sure on that one! good luck|`|AA10581563	I have moved a lot with both my cats.  Once to Alaska from California(2,500 miles), from Alaska to Arizona (2,800 miles), and then from California to Pennsylvania (2,300 miles).  <br>  <br>  If you are stopping every night then you do not have to worry about food, water, or bathroom needs while in the car.  Even if you try to give them food/water along the way they probably won't eat or drink.  As for bathroom...the same...they probably won't want to stop and use it until you are settled into a motel/hotel room for the night.  <br>  <br>  I would just keep the driving down to 8 hours a day, and keep the cats in a pet carrier.  Once you get to a motel fill a small litter box with a small amount of litter, and put out food and water.  They will hide at first, but will come out while you guys are sleeping and do all they need to do.  <br>  <br>  In the morning just dump the litter, put the cats back in the carrier, and pack up the cat box and food an start you next day drive.  Another tip is to eat breakfast near the motel/hotel you are staying in so you don't have to pack up the kitties until after breakfast.<br>  <br>  Good luck with the move, and thanks for being one of the few responsible people that actually take their pets with them when they move far away instead of dropping them at a shelter.|`|AA12387593	i just transported my 19 year old cat from Florida to Connecticut via Texas to visit my sister i just kept her in cat carrier till on the road each day once in route we would let her roam the car keeping litter box on floor of back seat food and water on other side then back in the carrier at motel use scoopable litter if they poop just scoop and through out at rest area or side of road if it stinks too much witch it may|`|ea25fd5d8208e433b895be879622a06caa	One thing depends on the type of auto you are traveling in. If there is enough room use two deep containers 1 for dry food 1 for shallow water. Keep the water fresh. You can place these in one side of the rear floorboard, preferably where the passenger can watch the bowls. Pet stores sell disposable litter pans that are small you could buy several of these and place one at a time in the other rear floor board. Keep a garbage bag handy for when they do the stinky. Or stop once per day put a litter pan outside for the stinky and dispose. Just remember have a leash and collar on your cat and a good grip before you open the doors. No matter how car calm they are this is going to be a long trip. LOL

Or a spray against snakes like people in the southern US have to use but I would make this warning that the ground absorbs it too and the rain moves it so do not let animals chew that grass or be exposed a long time to it and do not pick vegetables from a home garden once you have sprayed with anything like that.  It probably won't kill humans that way but it might and it definitely will absorb into garden plants to some degree which is not good for your health.

4a48f54a13a95076bd166b9128f8fdc9aa	You need to attach the puppies to her nipples. The puppies can't walk over to her and she might not be able to get to them. Take the puppies and stick them to her belly and they will usually figure it out from there. If she doesn't want to nurse them at all, keep trying. If not, you are going to have to run out asap and buy some puppy formula to use until you can get her to nurse them.<br>  <br>  Edited to add: It is best to have the puppies nurse between each puppy born. It actually helps the mom have more contractions and gets them out faster. Also, the puppies need the rich colostrum from their mother within the first 12 hours after birth, so make sure you get them to latch on. I touched each and every puppy after ours were born and even had to stimulate one to start breathing. Touching the puppies isn't harmful, just make sure you have clean hands. Especially in a situation like this, you are going to have to touch them to get them to latch on if they are not figuring it out for themselves.<br>  <br>  Also, squeeze your dogs nipple and make sure she actually is producing milk.|`|811316351e4db28757d4b5a70c9e6a87aa	Call ur Vet if she don't start nursing.

eb7b3f653ea0e97bafa2dd3ddf8e6ac8aa	If you get two animals at the same time, they would get along better because no one has established "seniority" of your household.  Of course, the younger the better as well.  Puppies and kitties haven't had a chance to learn that they're "different" and that they should "hate" each other.  They will just see each other as siblings.  Please consider a rescue animal or one from a shelter.  These animals may have previous issues as far as compatibility, but you can ask about their "social skills" and the caretakers should probably be able to give you info on how they interact with the other species.  Also, you can train them to get along, it just takes patience, which you should have anyway if you want to be a responsible pet owner.|`|60b03d4aacf8336f14fab0281a07d081aa	in order for a dog cat relationship,the dog has to be old(toy poodles,chuwawas, and beagles cant get that big).some species can get along while others cant.if i were you, just get 2 dogs because cats are more of a hassle, but if u wanna stick with dog cat thing, make em outside pets or have a place the cat,if smaller, can climb to and the dog cant reach(with walls so the cat cant attack) so the cat wont be attacked and the dog can be alone.good luck.|`|hQ0vBo6jaa	well, some cats and dogs get along but if you really want to make sure they will get along wait till your dog is around the age of 3|`|OUq8Wi9saa	the dog wont get lonely if u just get one (or at least thats what it is in my case), and also, if u r gonna get a cat and dog, get them as a kitten and as a puppy, that way they have the chance to grow up together and (hopefully) get to be friends! and about what type of small dog, i suggest toy fox terriers, or ne type of terrier. toy foxes r VERY little (and yes there is the chance that a cat probably would beat them up), and just normal terriers r kinda big kinda small. in between small dogs and medium sized dogs. and for that size, i wouldnt worry about the cat beating up the dog! there is also min pins. they r very yappy and annoying in general, but they r very small.<br>  hope that helped!

Eso de dejarlo solito a que camine junto a ti no creo que sea muy bueno pues nunca sabes cuando se va a ir corriendo y si la calle esta ahi cerca te lo pueden atropellar. Ademas hay varias zonas en donde te multan si no los traes con correa. <br>  Lo que si es que requiere de mucha paciencia!! MUCHA!  No va a suceder de la noche a la maniana pero si va a aprender. Cuando lo estes paseando y te empieza a jalar no lo jales tu tambien porque entonces se convierte en un juego de a ver quien jala mas fuerte. Lo que debes de hacer es pararte y dejar de caminar hasta que tu perro o se siente o te deje de jalar. Cuando lo haga, le dices "junto" o lo que quieras y asi solito va a aprender. Tambien lo puedes sobornar con bisquetitos de los que venden para perros.

AA11618088	SHe really shouldn't be left in a crate while you are at work - regardless of crate training status.  Remember, crates aren't babysitters and they aren't replacements for proper care.  Dogs really shouldn't be crated for more than 4-6 hours at a time, on a regular basis.  <br>  <br>  Yes, if you let her out of the crate when she cries, you will be reinforcing that behaviour.  Perhaps you can talk to your neighbors and let them know that you are doing your best in the situation and that it will all soon be over.  <br>  <br>  I'm also not sure that this dog is the best match for you.  Heelers bark and need A TON of exercise.  Being crated for 8+ hours during the day, and then another 8 or so at night, and living in a "quiet" apartment isn't exactly a great environment for the dog.  <br>  <br>  Potty training questions are asked on here dozens of times a day.  Use the search box to see if any of those techinques will work for you. <br>  <br>  And please be sure that you are giving this dog all that she needs.  I'd hate to see you give her up in 6 months when the barking continues and when she's going crazy from being crated too much without proper exercise and tasks.  <br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.cattledog.com/misc/intro.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.cattledog.com/misc/intro.html</a>|`|fqiwCpx9aa	Heelers need room to run for one.

The more you go to her and take her out when she cries the longer it is going to take for her to be quiet. Ignore her cries and if possible put her in the bathroom or another room that maybe your neighbors won't hear her as much. Let her go in and out of her crate when she is out playing and that will make her more comfortable with it too. It will probably take a week or 2 before she is quiet for most of the night except to go potty.|`|AA11110945	Try adding an old wind up clock in her crate, perhaps put it inside a stuffed toy.

I know its sounds really bad, and I would'nt do it to my puppy. But in your situation you really can't do anything, you can't physically make the dog stop. Your puppy would eventually accept being left alone if you just ignored it, but your neighbors have a problem with that. My puppy cried for nights, I had to put ear plugs on. After like 2 weeks of crying, I forgot she was their. She was so quiet. It sucks that your pup has to learn the hard way, but you have to use the collar if you want peace. I bet you though, after a few shocks she'll get it and stop, dogs are not dumb.<br>  <br>  Good luck with your situation!|`|vfzOKUUtaa	When you first put her in her crate make sure you sit with her next to her crate for a few minutes so she knows the crate is not a punishment but a good thing. Also go to your local pet store and buy a kongo toy. It is a hollow rubber toy that you put treats in. It helps to occupy their time because they really have to work to get the treat out. I put treats and peanut butter in mine and it works great. Ihave 3 dogs that are all crated when I am not home and as long as your dog knows it is not a punishment it is a great thing.|`|R4n1eSs6aa	why not take here to be trained????|`|fa388dc57dc34d378cb870ba5c7cea6caa	First you need to ask your self is the kennel for housing or restroom????you should try to leave the kennel down with the door open and let her freely go in and out of the kennel, prase her when she stays in for a while with the door being open. then try putting her in there for a while with the door closed. if she doesn't make a fuss about it let her out and rashe her  even give her a treat. then do it again and leave the room for 20-30 min. if she crys walk in a ignore her don't look at her. open the door but don't look or pay attention to her. grabb her and do it again, untill she understands she will not be in the kennel for ever and crying does not get her anywhere. if your trying to potty trian to go in the kennel.....<br>  go to wall mart and buy trainning padds for dogs, it's like a big diaper for the floor, they have some kinda sent in them that dogs pick up on. You'll have to try this training thing during the weekend. Now they have this spray stuff called "no go", it is a spray that has another kinda sent that dogs don't like so there for won't "go" in that area. But the affects of the spay are only good for up to 24hrs then you'd have to spray the spot again. okay......now put a pad in the crate/kennel then spray  the area the you don't want her to use the restroom. put your dog inside the kennel so she can get used to the idea and the sent. But don't close the door you don't want her to think this is a punishment, because it's not. Now your going to have to watch her and make sure she doesn't find somewhere else to go! you might be in this room for a while and you'll need to leave the kennel where ever you start this training process so she won't get confused, for about a week or two. trust me it works and it is a good thing to teach so when you go on vacation she isn't pooping and peeing everywhere. she'll know what and where her restroom is. ooohh yeah you need to change the padd after every use! good luck, let me know how it go's. :) ?|`|yVu5gfLmaa	you might see if the day care can get her used to it when she is there during the day.<br>  otherwise it sounds like she suffers from separation anxiety and there are ways of correcting that. but no quickies. i know you did not want to here that . the people at the daycare should be able to help you with the problem.

Sorry.|`|PBjuqnpiaa	Usually when spiders die they will just curl their legs in under themselves - they don't fall apart.<br>  I would say as the previous poster that what's happened here is that your spider has been attacked by the livefood it was given.  Crickets can do some very nasty damage - especially if the spider had just shed it's skin.  When the spiders first come out of shed their outer skeleton is very soft and will take a few days to harden up - the spider could've gone into shed and been in the process of shedding (they're extremely vulnerable at this time anyway as they flip onto their backs to shed) when the crickets had a go at it.|`|wfsaPcrTaa	Sounds like a wild one i found one time on the side of the road.....and i took this thing to a pet store where i knew that they sold these things....and they told me that i found this thing cuz it was mating time for this particular trantula....and that soon after they mate....they will autamaticaly die.....that is what they told me....good luck and sorry bout your spider.....i would ask a pet store or look it up on the web....take care

d69e91d3aedbfed80873d7058a2753d0aa	I have a pit mix up for adoption right now and let me tell you what.... I have so many people who call me wanting to know if she is a fighter, can she pack on weight, is she agressive, will she fight and bite on command... I even had her at the adoption site one weekend and young men were interested in her for thoose reasons... I had NO IDEA so many people wanted a pit for thoose reasons.  So when you ask a question like that in a forum like this you have to know that so many people out there are useing these dogs for fighting.  I live in the country and dog fighting is rampant out here... yes... dog fighting is stupid... and cruel and evil... but unfortunately there are stupid, evil people in this world who do things like that.  When I adopt out an animal I do a home inspection and get references and people think I am going overboard... but I HAVE to otherwise the dog/cat can end up being a fighter, a bait animal or a tester.  I hate it but it is a fact.  You may be in the minority with what you want for you animal, but the problems are widespread and in the majority.  Like the person said before, clear you question up and maybe you won't be accused of fighting your pit...  good luck.|`|B6Loic0raa	It's just people get the dogs for the wrong reasons.

Pero si tu canita tien al día sus vacunas y desparasitaciones, no tienen de que preocuparte, solo las recomendaciones de siempre lavarse las manitas antes de comer, después de ir al ba?o y después de jugar con el perrito. "Recuerda que las vacunas y desparasitantes económicos no son los mejores y que no solo expones a tu perro si no a todos los miembros de tu familia". Espero serte de ayuda.

Can't tell when it comes to mixed breed dogs.  IF both parents were bred to standard, you might be able to say that it's likely she'll be the size of either a lab or a pitbull.. But given that some one allowed to dogs to breed, and they shouldn't have, it's likely that neither parent is within standard. So you just plain can't even guess how big or small she might be.. She'll be dog sized..|`|6bf041ba53ac88a83e4de8bbb057a3baaa	Based on the breds I would say about 60 or more pounds when she is an adult.|`|945a44813af7f8723f57efa8d7194532aa	I estimate about 55 pounds.<br>  <br>  (Pit bulls are overbred and vary largely in size, from 30-80 lbs.)|`|Qb253GWHaa	This is unknown.

o0Oy7muGaa	Your male will LOVE your female if he is not fixed first!  His mission is to make babies!  Get him fixed first!  Ask you vet how long it will take for the hormones to wear off before introducing.  Animals are real big on scent, and they smell different after being fixed.  Do it first!!!  You should get fer fixed too!|`|261acc6eb4f0e0c39b9f7ba984093fe5aa	I have 7 chins and what I usually do is to put them in their pen (a rabbit run with a lid) and divide the area with a wire screen.  They can see and smell each other.  They are introduced and allowed to become familiar like this over a period of a couple of weeks then I will allow mixing under strict supervision.  It usually goes well but I have had a couple of bust ups so be vigilant!|`|sDOh1mgPaa	It's important to make sure they meet in a neutral area.  Whatever you do, don't put the male in the females cage, because females are very territorial, and it won't go well.  If they're in a neutral area then they can simply meet without having to protect anything.  Keep a close eye on them (obviously) in case they don't get along so hot.  <br>  <br>  A few things you can do before putting them all the way together would be to let them get accustomed to each other's scent.  A few ways to do this are to put their cages close together (but not so close that they can actually fight/hurt each other through the bars), or to even put them in each other's cages or dustbaths for a little while.  This will help in the initial introduction.  <br>  <br>  For more suggestions, check out some chin books at your local library.  Any basic chin care book should have a section on introductions.<br>  <br>  A male and female should be a good match.  Typically they are easier to house together than a pair of females, so that's good.<br>  <br>  Hope that helps.<br>  <br>  Good luck :)

5598bd1170afaaf3f964f480815cc0a6aa	Before you introduce the new kitten to your other cat, you should take her to the vet to be checked for FELV/FIV because you're cat may catch these if exposed.  So have the kitten checked over and start her vaccinations before introducing to your other cat.<br>  <br>  It may take them a while to get used to each other, but with time, love and patience, they should find a way to co-exist.|`|PeQ40WcWaa	Ah she just realises that the kitten is now a member of the household and she's showing the kitten who's boss. If the kitten is female, your older cat is more likely to be competitive and aggressive, but she should learn to be tolerant.<br>  <br>  Incidentally, how old is the kitten? If it's younger than 12 weeks and has not had all of its injections, please don't put it outside, even for a short while. It could pick up all kinds of diseases.<br>  <br>  Have you taken it to the vet yet to be checked over? You probably have! But if not, obviously that's the first thing you need to do.<br>  <br>  Other than that, try not to handle the kitten too much before stroking your cat - she will not like the smell on your hands. Make sure you give your older cat lots of extra attention and don't let the kitten share ANYTHING belonging to the older cat!<br>  <br>  Well done on being understanding with your cat though. Too many people get angry with their old cat and shut them out in favour of the new kitten - it's nice to see that you removed the kitten from the situation rather than shutting your older cat out!<br>  <br>  Things should improve in time hun.<br>  <br>  xx Emmie|`|AA10233136	that's normal for cats.  they're very territorial.  it takes time (up to a year!) for an old cat to accept a new one. just be patient.  you can't stop instinct.<br>  also, whenever you bring a new cat home, you should isolate it for a day or so (closed door) so they can sniff one another under the door and to make sure there aren't any medical issues that could be spread.<br>  be patient and show affection to both!|`|BRXddepwaa	they will come round in the end|`|s1vO8oLAaa	We had two cats already and took in a stray pregnant cat and they all seemed to get on ok at first but our first cat we owned started hissing growling and sulking all the time when the new cat was near at first we had to feed her seperate or she wouldnt eat it just takes time as now several weeks later they eat together tolerate each other and have occasionally touch noses your original cat will be defending her territory and it will take some time for her to get used to a new smell etc as long as they are not hurting each other they will be fine.

Syrians (also called golden, teddy bear, black bear, etc.) are larger and will usually fight as adults, so it's best to keep one per cage.  Dwarf hamsters are smaller and more social, so you can usually keep two together without issue.  They need a good sized cage with non-aromatic shavings.    The cage should be cleaned at least every other week.  They need daily feedings and fresh water.  They like having toys to chew and explore.  An exercise wheel lets them run in the cage.  Ones with a solid track are best since the hamster's feet can't slip through.  They need to be handled regularly to stay tame.|`|SW6fbDepaa	ok if you just got them you have to leave them alone for 1 to 2 dasys so they can get use to there new surroundings and they will sometimes not bite but a little nip itsd beacuse thats how they check out there surroundings belive me i have 3 i know alot about them|`|trbNJrJbaa	hamsters not hampsters lol..  depends what you want to no. pop down to your local pet superstore and get a book for ￡2.99 and it tells you everything! or search on google.

1yV9ZhxUaa	No one would be stupid enough to grant you custody of a puppy when they can sell it unless its a close friend or a family member of yours! So if I were you, I would reconsider some advice about adopting or purchasing one. <br>  <br>  Do not purchase a dog less than $300. Chances are that the dog is very sickly with numerous and various ailments in which are either incurable or require heavy medication which can leave a bang for your buck. The average cost for a dog can range from $300 all the way to $1000. Designer dogs ("tea cup") can cost over $1000. The best place to purchase a pet is from a breeder or an animal shelter because they are the ones who truly care about where the dog is going to receive a little TLC. The worst place to purchase a dog is from a pet shop or a dog mill because they don't give a rat ayss about the dog since they're so money-hungry. They allow their dogs to be sick because those veterinarian bills can be hefty especially if they own about 300 dogs in their factory. About 90% of those dogs are deathly sickly and all pet shop owners purchase dogs from pet mills since they're so cheap. But if you can't resist, make sure that the seller is a member of a dog owner organization such as the American Kennel Club and request that you can view and take the dog's medical history. Check to see if all the dog's vaccinations were taken and up-to-date, if its parents aren't sick, and get a veterinarian to substantiate the positive information and verify if the document is real. NEVER purchase a dog from across the shore, even if it is from a breeder or an animal shelter. In most cases, you end up with a poorly house trained dog, possibly sick, or with a look-alike, mix, or apparently the wrong dog you ordered.|`|00ddc7f7cc561904db032288ec417cc6aa	Check you local shelter I volunteer at my local dog shelter and a few weeks ago they had a very pretty Siberian Husky about 3 years old.

Willful, bold and sometimes temperamental. If it is properly introduced they usually get along with other dogs and household animals without any problems, but some of them seem to think they are much larger than they actually are and do not hesitate to attack much bigger dogs. It is an excellent watchdog with a resounding bark. Poms have a tendency to be reserved and bark at strangers excessively. Teach this dog early that it may bark a couple of times when the doorbell rings or when there are visitors, but then to keep quiet. Be very consistent about this. They are alert, curious and busy: one of the most independent of the Toy breeds. Poms have a delightful nature and do not cling to their handlers. Proud and happy, they are good at learning tricks, but need a firm hand. The Pomeranian must know the owner is the boss, or he will not listen. This breed may become too demanding if the owner allows it. Not recommended for very young children. Too much attention from children can make these dogs nervous and they may become snappish. However, they can get along well with older, well behaved children. It is a good companion for an elderly person. The Pom is a wonderful companion dog and show ring contender. The breed's docile temper and affectionate nature endear it to many. Its vivacity and spirit make it well-liked by persons who do not usually care for toy dogs. They may be picky eaters. <br>  Height, Weight<br>  Height: 7-12 inches (18-30 cm.) <br>  Weight: 3-7 pounds (1-3 kg.)|`|dcf8909376095b816585ce7cb1d59e43aa	I think you should go on puppyfind.com. When you search they give you the choice of size and upkeep so you can choose what your ready for. When they list the breeds it will show bars to indicate its size, grooming requirements, exersize requirements, its ability to be good with other dogs, and its watchdog ability. After you choose your breed, it will show a description of the animal including its country of origin, size, coat, character, temperament, care, training, and activity. You can now choose if this is the right breed for you. Finally, at the bottom of the dicription it will say <br>  (the breed) puppies for sale. You can then click on that and then choose a cute puppy for you. Once you find it you can email, call, or check out the website of the seller. And there you go. A cute dog that fits to your life style. Hope this helps. P.S ( I used it too) Named her ginger.|`|OiPNXmg7aa	Bassett hound!! also, all of the above are good too.

bcca81e3a01eecd371f088c347c05a2aaa	I disagree with wing clipping in many cases because flying is the best way birds exercise, especially caged house pets. If they're not flying, climbing and walking doesn't effectively make up for the lack of exercise they would get flying. This may lead to obesity or weak muscles. I agree with the answerer who said to actually lock your cat up when you want to take them out.<br>  <br>  If you want them to sit with you, gain their trust. It's a long process, but very rewarding in the end. The easiest way to get a "quick fix", I suppose, is to bribe them into realizing that sitting with you isn't so bad. Use treats and offer it to them to sit on your finger or shoulder and eat; don't just let them take it and run away. <br>  <br>  If you are to clip their wings, do a light clip (a couple of primaries and/or secondaries; have a vet show you a "light clip" first so you don't accidentally clip too far and potentially cause the birds to bleed to death) where they can still gain flight and break their own fall when they hit a surface. Never clip the wings crookedly because this will cause the birds to be off-balance walking as well as flying, and they'll drop like rocks, which can injure them horribly and bust their tiny internal organs.|`|3UuW8SnIaa	i think you should i have a cat and a bird and my birds wings are clipped they have never even seen each other. As for all the people who say clipping wings is wrong my friend though that until he parakeet broke a blood vessial from smashing into a wall but it is your decision not mine so go ahead and do what you feel is right|`|5p5udz1baa	If you are only going to take them out when you know someone isn't going to accidently let the cat in then clip them-I clipped my lovebirds wings but I had a bird friendly cat-good luck|`|AA10675944	IMO - I think it's bad enough that people keep pets in cages, and to clip their wings too..I just don't like it.  I know it doesn't physically hurt the birds, but don't do it.  How would you like for someone to chop the ends of your fingers off?  Try putting the cat in the bathroom for a little while and let your birds fly around your house with a little freedom and safe from the cats.|`|T7Q8T9rxaa	I believe trimming wings is cruel. To take something natural away from a bird. [my oppion]You can always buy harnesses and leashes. You put them on when you want to play with them and take them off when your done. Heres a site and hope this helps.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.mybirdstore.com/Feather_Tether_Leashes-Feather_Tether_Harness_and_Leash.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.mybirdstore.com/Feather_Tethe...</a><br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  Very safe site to order from.|`|jVyAhoI5aa	Lock the cat up in the bathroom (or wherever)  when you want the birds to come out of their cages. And yes, clip their wings.  Fully flighted budgies flying around do tend to look like little flying pizzas to cats and if they bang into a wall or land badly, they can injure or kill themselves.
313d75c7032312450349f7391773a4f0aa	Cool water probably would have been a good idea.  Birds like many other animals don't sweat so it would have helped lower his body temperature.|`|O3q8Qvivaa	I would not spash her, maybe get a plant mister and lightly mist the bird, not cooling it down too quickly. By now the bird is cooled off, right? So, moving it sounds like a good idea, also covering the half of the cage that faces the light might help. A low blowing fan facing away from the bird will keep the air circulating. Sorry your birdie got hot, I'm sure it was scary for you, glad he is okay now|`|AA10967352	i don't think splashing cool water is stupid... birds do it in birdbaths all the time|`|dNm1S3mXaa	Try putting a fan on her with a gentle breeze.That should do it.But don't keep it on her for a long time.Just until she cools off.dont put the fan to close to her.|`|ue8Dhe8Faa	definitly move her cage,get a spray bottle and spray her periodicly,you can also put a bowl of  water in her cage so she can bathe,my parrots get in the shower for about 20 min. a day if its real hot they go outside and get in the dogs kiddie pool birds love water all year round|`|ynkkVVX5aa	you did the right thing by moving her.

PBBdapCWaa	No doubt this is a bacterial bloom brought on by crowded conditions.  You didn't have the problem before because the fish were smaller and the tank was fairly new.  Cleaning out the tankand filter damaged the bactierial cycle in the tank that is needed for proper ammonia cycling.  I'll include a link at the bottom that explains this in good detail.  Be sure to follow the links to the next pages at the bottom, they will cover even more info that will help you with your tank.  While the water would probably clear if left alone, you would probably lose fish due to ammonia build up if you don't continue water changes.  The only real ways to avoid the problem and stop it from continuing would be 1) a larger tank for the goldfish or 2) smaller fish for your tank.  <br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.firsttankguide.net/" rel="nofollow">http://www.firsttankguide.net/</a><br>  <br>  Hope that helps!<br>  <br>  MM|`|86b135e0c5c7fa8152fab546e88b509caa	sounds like a bacterial bloom caused by overstocking/overfeeding/fish pooping<br>  replacing the filter won't have helped and would have removed all the good bacteria.<br>  <br>  1 gallon is far too small for goldfish, invest in a larger tank, about 30 gallons or larger for two goldfish.|`|AA11901352	Yes it is a bacterial bloom however you cleaning the entire tank is causing it.  Taking all the water out of the aquarium forces the tank to start the start up cycle all over again.<br>  <br>  Here is a good site to help you understand what goes on in your tank:<br>  <br>  <a href="http://freshaquarium.about.com/cs/biologicalcycle/a/nitrogencycle.htm" rel="nofollow">http://freshaquarium.about.com/cs/biolog...</a><br>  <br>  When doing a water change and cleaning the tank, once a week you should only remove 25% of the water, not the entire tank.  Using a gravel siphon to clean the rocks is the best way to go.<br>  <br>  You in short are over cleaning the tank.  Next water change, only remove 25% of the water.  Read the web page to understand why.  Also, you will need to get a test kit.  Since your tank is now cycling all over again, you are going to be getting ammonia spikes.  Smaller water changes will help to keep the ammonia levels down<br>  <br>  Feel free to email me.|`|9c63c266ffaeb04227f67753c79d6d31aa	Hi dude! Nothing to worry about.<br>  <br>  Sometimes the water gets cloudy after cleaning the tank. This is normal and feel easy. The fish inside try to explore more inside due to the change in temperature and hence start rummaging through the place atleast for a day or two.<br>  <br>  If the water looks fine when seen through the glass, then it must be the point stated above. In which case, you will have to stabilize and wait for a couple of days for water particles to settle between the gravels.<br>  <br>  Or, maybe that the gravels are not cleaned properly, or the filter is dirty itself.<br>  <br>  Neverthless, if the water itself is cloudy right from its origin then there is nothing you can do about it. You could try double filtering instead. Place two or more clothes stacked one on top of the other and pour the water through it. This should make the water a bit softer.<br>  <br>  Hope this helps.|`|cfa653dabe1dc96fa18de7bf5200eb5aaa	Your tank is way too small for goldfish. Not even one should have to live in such a tiny home. You can never keep it clean and you will never have healthy goldfish live in there. You would have to change all of the water every 4 hours day and night to keep them alive in there. When they die, rinse everything well and go get ONE betta. That would make a pretty good home for that fish, if you change the water every 5 days or so (all of it). Sorry I so wish the pet store you bought this from actually educated their employees before they let them loose to sell anyone anything. I wouldn't be surprized if the store in question was Petco. They even advertize their store with an employee holding a bowl with 2 goldfish in it. There is no such thing as a goldfish bowl, PERIOD. Goldfish need at least 10 gallons a peice, filter, heater and airator. Goldfish should never be kept in any tank smaller than 20 gallons. If you have the money get your fish a 20 gallon tank with filter (not undergravel a real filter), heater (75-80 degrees), airator with 2 good sized stones going. Anything less is just plain cruel to them. Its not your fault I blame the big pet store.|`|guPDmWe0aa	A bigger tank would certainly help.  Filters are OK as long as they are maintained.  Do you have gravel in the bottom?  If so do you have enough?  At least 25mm 1" is best, more can help stop clouding and algae problems.  Normally you should replace about 30% of the water every week or two but make sure it is treated to remove harmfull aditives in most tap water (see your local fish stockist for advice as this changes from area to area).|`|tRNGXTxEaa	Agree with the bacterial bloom. Your tank is way to small for any fish you may care to name, except possibly a bumble bee gobie. You should also try to avoid replacing all the water and filter material as this destroys the good bacteria that will have been cultivated during the cycling of the tank.<br>  <br>  visit www.wetwebmedia.com and research a little on goldfish, they have a long life 20+ years is an average lifespan, and they will reach a decent size,even fancy varieties such as ryui, pearlscales and black moors.<br>  <br>  when you come to change the filter pad/material, only remove half of it, as the old material will contain beneficial bacteria that will colonise the new media, thus activating it.<br>  <br>  good luck.
AhFhek9daa	Il faut les déloger de l'habitation au bon moment !<br>  Quand?<br>  Le meilleur moment est entre les mois d'octobre et mai . <br>  Il faut éviter de les chasser après le début de juin car les petits sont nés et ne peuvent pas encore  voler. Les mères chauves-souris tenteront constamment de revenir pour les rejoindre. Les chauves-souris quitteront les lieux pour leur habitat d'hiver au début de l'automne. Il est donc mieux d'attendre après septembre pour les étapes 2 et 3. <br>  Comment?<br>  1ère étape : Trouver par où elles entrent dans le batiment.<br>  Voici quelques indices à surveiller :<br>  taches noiratres et éclaboussures de selles au pourtour des points d'entrée à l'extérieur de labatisse; <br>  localisation des endroits d'où sortent les chauves-souris au crépuscule; <br>  2e étape: Bloquer les entrées<br>  Lorsque les accès sont localisés, ils doivent être bouchés à l'exception d'un ou deux. N'importe quel matériel peut être utilisé. La chauve-souris ne déloge pas ce qui bloque l'entrée de son dortoir. Elle cherchera plut?t un autre accès de 2 cm et plus pour s'y faufiler et retourner à son dortoir. <br>  3e étape: Laisser des sorties ouvertes<br>  Les ouvertures non obstruées servent de porte de sortie pour les chauves-souris qui sont encore dans le dortoir. Elles doivent rester libres pour la sortie mais inutilisables pour entrer. Un système unidirectionnel doit donc être placé sur l'ouverture. Du filet anti-oiseaux en polypropylène ou du grillage de nylon ou d'acier à mailles de 0,65 cm conviennent. Ils sont disponibles en quincaillerie ou en pépinière. Un morceau plus grand que l'ouverture est fixé sur les c?tés latéraux et supérieur de l'ouverture. La partie inférieure de ce morceau ne doit pas être fixée. Les chauves-souris restées à l'intérieur peuvent quitter le nid en se faufilant sous le grillage mais l'accès est impossible pour celles qui sont à l'extérieur. Lorsque toutes les chauves-souris sont sorties, les derniers accès doivent être condamnés définitivement. Il est suggéré de faire ces opérations le jour. <br>  <br>  Bon courage et ne les tuez pas, elle ont le droit de vivre quand meme et sont en effet protegees. Merci pour elles de tenir le bon raisonnement.|`|oOORjy3Faa	Achète-toi un chauve-chat.|`|CMipJLhhaa	en achetant des pieges a souris ou en adoptant des chauves chats

Todo due?o cuando su perrito se comporta mal debe saber como frenarlo, y si no lo sabe debe consultar PREVIAMENTE con algún criador o entrenador que le comente como es el manejo del perrito.

You should talk to a vet how you can get rid of Parvovirus in your home and garden so that this new dog doesn't catch parvo as well. Also, I wouldn't recommend another small dog if you have two disabled children and a newborn coming along.<br>  <br>  Check the RSPCA for senior dogs over 7 years of age. They usually cost around $100. Honestly, if you can't afford to buy a dog, you won't be able to afford one in the long run. I live in Victoria and if you can't afford a dog from a reputable breeder, the RSPCA is the next best place to go. Even if you don't want a senior, an adult goes for around $150 and pups for $220. If you decide to go with a breeder and spend an extra couple of hundred dollars ensuring the health and quality of your dog, <a href="http://www.dogzonline.com.au" rel="nofollow">http://www.dogzonline.com.au</a> is a fantastic place to find really good breeders in Australia (and Tassie). You might want to consider an Airedale Terrier, Whippet, Labrador Retriever or German Shepherd. Airedales run for around $1000+, Whippets for $500+, Labs are $750-$900 and German Shepherds go for $800-$1400. If they are too expensive, consider a Dalmatian or Golden Retriever. Dals are $500-$700 and Goldens are $400-$800.<br>  <br>  Edit: how can you not 'believe' in spending more than $100 on a dog that will be your lifelong companion? The RSPCA tests all the dogs to see what their temperament is like and would have introduced all the dogs there to cats, other dogs and children to see how they get along with them THEN they would post a description of the dog on the Internet, telling you what the dog gets along with/needs and what he doesn't. I'm spending $650 on my new Dalmatian puppy to ensure her health and quality and I feel like I'm doing the right thing. It might seem good now to spend $100 on a dog but what if he comes down with elbow dysplasia, requiring $2000 surgery? Either adopt from a shelter or find a good breeder - don't go bargain hunting for your new dog. If one of your children needed surgery, would you look around for the cheapest or would you find the best surgeon to operate? Buying a dog is no different.|`|trbNJrJbaa	maybe try web sites like freeads and stuff.. i dont thin kanyone will be giving away pups for free.. or try your local animal shelter or dogs home.
0d685c017cf7a74366a71e0aefe1307eaa	You need to contact your local vet for information. They will be glad to tell you what to feed the kittens. You need to get a bottle and some cat milk from the store and feed them. I am not sure how much but I know the vet will know. You have to take a warm wash cloth after feeding them and rub their little butts to produce a bowel movement. The mother does this with her tongue. I know gross. LOL. Also, you need to make sure they are warm. You can put a heating pad on low at the bottom of a box with towels on top and also put a clock underneath and a stuffed animal so they will think this is their mother. I feel so sorry for the little kittens. Be sure to feed them soon. I hope and pray the mother shows back up to take care of her babies.

Afterwards get a warm wet wash cloth and rub their tummys and bottoms with it to help them digest it and use the bathroom. Keep them in a warm area.<br>  <br>  Don't forget to spay and neuter mom and kittens when they are ready. ;D I'd also like to add if you find mom, keep her indoors. Females can get pregnant after 48 hours of giving birth, you're probably going to end up with a knocked up cat again. Once the kittens are weaned get them and mom fixed.

Or are you trying to teach him to be aggressive and bite?? You might very well be doing that.. If his biting is met with aggression, you are playing a game... He does't take you serious, he knows you don't know what you are doing..<br>  <br>  Be a respected leader, don't be an aggressive leader.. Teach him thru example, show him what you want, what you don't want.. and redirect his energy towards things that are acceptable, rather than beating him into submission..|`|811316351e4db28757d4b5a70c9e6a87aa	If ur dog is 1 of the smaller breeds they like to bite.

He bites, take him by the scruff (like his mother would do) and lift him from the ground.  Now in a hard, deep voice (not loud) say 'NO'.  If you shout the command is not effective.  Keep your tone threatening.  If it is a larger puppy, place your arms around him, hands on the his belly (so that when you lift he cannot brace himself against your chest) and lift.  Make sure you're holding him straight, don't let his butt drop lower or his front drop lower.  Keep all four feet off of the ground and hold him for several seconds and again in that same threatening voice use the 'NO'.  <br>  Remember not to shout or yell and no hitting.|`|dbf44b2d4b9b4b0f7045d0d83d7016faaa	bitter spray stuff didn't work in my situation, I had to use hot sauce...but you need just a VERY small amount.

A firm "no", and hot sauce on your finger in the dog's mouth should work.|`|1befb97566847aae4e9421f6ed8373a7aa	You can try rubbing Bitter Apple on your hands so when he bites he will get a nasty taste in his mouth. That is how I trained my dog not to nip at me.|`|SHglpIzlaa	It really works to buy your puppy a chew toy. I had to baby-sit a stubborn dog like that once, and it kept trying to bite me, but I gave it it's chew toy and it stopped. Now when I baby-sit it, it NEVER bites me!! It just runs everywhere looking for the toy. Also a good method is the hitting on the nose. Not really hitting, just tapping. It might not work now, but if the toy method doesn't work, as the puppy gets older try tapping it on the nose.

Sprinkle bicarb of soda over the area and leave overnight then sweep up the next morning. If the urine has sunk into the bottom of the closet and it is wood then you may never completely get rid of the smell. If it has a flooring which you can lift up then clean underneath with powder and apply bicarb there as well. You may have to do this a couple of times. febreze is good and so is neutrodol although they only really mask the smell. To stop the cat from urinating in there again apply a few drops of a citrus scent. Cats hate this and it will make the closet smell lovely.|`|trbNJrJbaa	you need to have the closet washed out fully! bleach the closet also put a drop of fabric conditioner in the solution and scrub it all down, get some frebreeze and spray the whole room, you might have to do this a few time. also the carpet in the bedroom get some shake and vac and hover it all up. hopefully it should be smelling nice again.|`|UunUONf8aa	urin gone and it comes with a black light so u can tell if you got it all....and lots of febreeze

C'est l'un des serpents les plus rapides du monde, capable de se déplacer entre 16 et 20 km/h, et certains spécimens ayant été mesurés à plus de 32 km/h.<br>  <br>  Il doit son nom à la coloration noire de l'intérieur de sa bouche. La couleur de sa peau varie du jaune-vert au gris métallique.<br>  <br>   Comportement  [modifier]<br>  Il n'arrive que rarement que le mamba noir morde un humain, mais il peut se montrer particulièrement agressif lorsqu'il se sent menacé ou lorsqu'il défend son territoire. Il commence par essayer d'impressionner son adversaire en adoptant une posture mena?ante, le corps dressé, le cou aplati, la gueule ouverte, en agitant sa langue et en émettant un cri strident. Puis il bondit soudainement sur sa victime et s'acharne sur elle en lui flanquant de nombreux coups de crochets.<br>  <br>  C'est un animal diurne qui apprécie les zones boisées ou rocheuses et chasse activement. Ses proies favorites sont des oiseaux et des rongeurs, même s'il ne dédaigne pas à l'occasion des ?ufs voire ses semblables. Lorsqu'il a trouvé une proie, il lui délivre une seule morsure et se replie, laissant le temps à la neurotoxine de son venin de la paralyser.<br>  <br>  <br>   Venin  [modifier]<br>  Le venin du mamba noir contient des neurotoxines et des cardiotoxines. Sa morsure inocule en général 100 à 120 mg de venin, mais cela peut aller jusqu'à 400 mg ; 10 à 15 mg de son venin étant mortel pour un humain adulte.<br>  <br>  La létalité de sa morsure dépend d'un certain nombre de facteurs, tels que la quantité de venin injecté et l'emplacement de la morsure. Cependant, si le venin atteint la circulation sanguine rapidement, les risques de mortalité augmentent drastiquement.<br>  <br>  Le premier sympt?me d'une morsure est une douleur locale dans la zone de la morsure, cependant moins douloureuse que celle des serpents disposant d'un venin chargé d'hémotoxines. Puis la victime sent des fourmillements à ses extrémités, cligne des yeux, sa vision se rétrécit, elle se met à transpirer et à saliver de manière excessive, puis perd le contr?le de ses muscles (d'abord la bouche et la langue). Si la victime ne re?oit pas de soins appropriés très rapidement, les sympt?mes progressent, et elle éprouve alors des nausées, perd son souffle, est confuse, a des problèmes pour respirer et se paralyse. Elle peut éventuellement être prise de convulsions, d'un arrêt respiratoire, d'un coma, ou mourir de la suffocation résultante de la paralysie des muscles respiratoires.<br>  <br>  Bien qu'avec un traitement il soit possible de soigner 99% des victimes, si la morsure n'est pas traitée, le taux de mortalité est de 100%. La paralysie causée par le venin n'est pas permanente, bien que la victime ait besoin de respirer artificiellement jusqu'à ce que son propre système immunitaire ait complètement nettoyé le sang de toute trace du venin.|`|44e2561c74f014cae24b3f93a312c74eaa	l homme avec sa langue fourchue|`|49aba6880c5af9c798c771ef283f17caaa	surtout en australie<br>  la vipère de la mort, le ta?pan ou le serpent tigre semblent être classés dans cette catégorie|`|8XKZ7Rc3aa	c est d abord le mocacin du mexique puis apres ca sera la viper du gAbon puis le naja ou cobra mais aussi plusieurs serpent arboricole les couleur vive sont generalement signe de danger.|`|AhFhek9daa	Le Taipan, il vit en Australie.<br>  Alors comme je vois que beaucoup persistent en affirmant que le cobra ou autre est le plus dangereux, voici une des nombreuses listses qui demontrera que le Taipan, moins connus du grand public certes, est les plus dangereux:<br>  List of Deadliest Snakes in the world as per their ranking : - <br>  1) Fierce Snake or Inland Taipan (Oxyuranus microlepidotus ), Australia.

These rare snakes are vitually unknown in collections outside of Australia.<br>  2) Australian Brown Snake (Pseudonaja textilis ), Australia. One 1/14,000 of an ounce of this vemon is enough to kill a person. <br>  3) Malayan Krait (Bungarus candidus ), Southeast Asia and Indonesia. 50% of the bites from this snake are fatal even with the use of antivenin treatment. <br>  4) Taipan (Oxyuranus scutellatus ), Australia.

Overdose will result in the symptoms of thyrotoxicosis which may include increased thirst, urination and hunger, hyperactivity, personality change, and reduced heat tolerance.<br>  <br>  If your pet has been put on Soloxine by your vet, it may be used on a long-term basis. Because this drug may have other affects, you may want to monitor your pet's health periodically. This may require periodic exams or blood tests to check thyroid levels.|`|AA10741751	I assume your dog has hyperthyroidism? The effects of levothyroxine sodium therapy are slow in being manifested.

Administer with caution to animals with clinically significant heart disease, hypertension or other complications for which a sharply increased metabolic rate might prove hazardous.<br>  <br>  Side Effects:<br>  There are no particular adverse reactions associated with levothyroxine sodium therapy at the recommended dosage levels.

In some cases they will even give their life to save yours if you love for puppy and you let him know, he'll def. love you back. Is not like human love that he'll show it thru hugs and kisses but, if you pay attention close enough you'll see that if you go out for a while and you come back home you'll see that your puppy has missed you if he runs to you as you walk thru the door wagging his tail wanting to be pet and excited to see you-- yeah he likes you! but if you just got him recently, you have to let him get use to you and your scent.

Really it doesn't.  Dogs don't think like humans do. They are pack animals. They see your sister as pack leader. They follow her and do things to please her. It's not that they don't like you.  It's that they just see you as a litter-mate or subordinate while your sister is the alpha in the home.  Usually it is Mom who's alpha, but somehow it turned out to be sister in your home. They probably like you.  But they only do things to please the Alpha, and they lick and follow the Alpha in the pack.  No matter how many dogs you buy this will happen until you take a higher position in the pack.  They are pack animals not humans.

I recently bought my girlfriend a German Shepherd Puppy, and he is now 7 months old.  She loves on him and cuddles with him and does everything she can, she even gives him leftovers which I rarely do.  However, I have done the training and the feeding and the walking.  So guess which one he follows.  He lays with me, he follows me, and he always wants to be with me.  Reason being.  I provide the food.  From a dogs point of veiw, I am the alpha and I provide the food, where as my girlfriend just gives him left overs.  I correct him when he is wrong, and I walk him and teach him.  Treating a dog like a "king" does not always give them the afection that they are requiring.  Piece of advice.  Ignore your dog.  I know, its hard, but stop fussing over him.  Take care of him, but do not fuss.  When you come home, do not acknowledge him, do not pet him, do not make eye contact, don't even say hello.  If he starts jumping on you, turn away.  If he comes up to you for affection, walk away.  Try this for a couple days, and see what happens.|`|trbNJrJbaa	dont worry it will like you aswell but has taken a shine to your sister. we have 3 cats 2 love me and dont like my fella and 1 loves my fella and hates me. dont worry, just try and give it as much attention and love as possible.|`|wPqNDeI2aa	maybe just relax you can let the dog know that you want to be loved so say good boy or other stuff to him more often so he gets the message.
fb5d8d49d6ca7655d710daac33cf9f05aa	Have you tried confining the cat in another room while the dog is fed, and giving him some special treat of his own to enjoy during that time, such as some yummy canned food?  What about feeding Milo outside, or on the porch?  <br>  <br>  You may want to try using a Feliway Comfort Zone diffuser and/or Feliway spray in the room where you feed the dog.  Feliway has calming pheromones to help reduce stress and territorial spraying.  You can find it at most vet clinics and pet supply stores.<br>  <br>  When you ruled out health issues at the vet, did the vet take a sample of Keyser's urine to test, or was it just a physical exam?  Sometimes stress will cause urinary infections in cats, and urine testing is the only way to truly rule out a physical problem.<br>  <br>  Is it possible that Milo may be bothering Keyser when he tries to use his litterbox?  He could be retaliating because of stress.  If so, putting Keyser's box where Milo can't get to it may help, and the Feliway can help with that a bit too.  How many boxes does Keyser have available to him?  Try adding a box - the stress of a new pet may sometimes bring out litterbox pickiness in cats who weren't previously picky...some cats prefer having one box to pee in and one to poop in, and some cats won't use a box that has been soiled at all.  Adding a litterbox should cover that possibility.<br>  <br>  You may also want to read the hints on this link:<br>  <a href="http://www.geocities.com/Heartland/Pointe/9352/litterboxhelp.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.geocities.com/Heartland/Point...</a>  (there's a section on spraying if you scroll down on the page).<br>  <br>  Hope this helps.|`|iBJe5j24aa	try putting its food near where the cat pees.

AA10859773	Unless your cat actually has kidney problems, you don't need to feed less protein.<br>  <br>  If anything, most commercial cat foods aren't high enough in protein!  <br>  <br>  Here is an article on the subject, with a snippet quoted below:<br>  <br>  You may have heard that restricting protein is recommended for cats in kidney failure. Although this has been the "standard" treatment for decades, as far as cats are concerned, it has always been--and remains--very controversial. ..... Research also shows that even very high protein diets do not make renal failure worse in cats......The real culprit is actually phosphorus, which meat contains in large amounts. The only way to restrict phosphorus is to restrict protein. Decreasing phosphorus intake (by restricting protein) can help some cats feel better, so it may be worth a try in a symptomatic cat. <br>  <br>  However, some studies have suggested that excessive restriction of protein may actually cause further damage to the kidneys and other organs, because there is not enough protein for normal body maintenance and repair. Experts say that these diets are not appropriate until the BUN (Blood Urea Nitrogen) is at least double what it should be normally (about 60-80 mg/dl). <br>  <br>  Furthermore, there is one big problem with using the protein-restricted commercial diets: many cats don't like them, and won't eat them. ....|`|kArnjho7aa	Hi<br>  <br>    You do NOT want to feed low protein food. Cats are carenivores and protein is what they need. There are no cat foods out there with too much protein. As a matter of fact.cats with kidney disease are recommended low protein foiods but vets are starting to learn that it isn't low protein they need but it's the quality of the protein that has been fed.. <br>   If you want to have a healthy cat, DON'T feed dry foods which are loaded with carbs and have the moisture zapped out  of it during the processing. Canned foods w/o gravy is what you should be feeding. Please read up|`|90fd6688b8cbf6f61a55e9d603c7d24eaa	Considering how much time, energy and money goes into the development of decent cat food, all you have to make sure of is that the dry food is made up of mainly meat and meat products. So many of the boxed brand in the supermarket are made of mainly cereal, artificial flavours and colourings.<br>  <br>  Kidney failure and disease can be caused by many things. <br>  <br>  As long as you feed your cat on good quality complete dry food, and you have water on offer all the time, you cat should remain in the peak of health.|`|trbNJrJbaa	i no that supermarkets own brands have very little of everything in it. its dried food with flavoring. maybe mix the food its up to you but thats what i was told.

La sal es necesaria para atenuar las infecciones parasitarias de la piel y mejorar el equilibrio osmótico del pez.<br>  <br>  Para iniciar el tratamiento se debe cambiar el agua del acuario. Aumentar la temperatura 3 grados y a?adir al agua 1 gramo de sal marina por litro (como máximo). El aumento de densidad se debe hacer de forma muy progresiva para que los peces se puedan adaptar. Después se inicia el tratamiento con verde de malaquita:<br>  <br>  <br>  Se prepara una solución de 0,1-0,2 mg. de verde de malaquita por litro de agua. <br>  Una dosis de este medicamento es igual a: 0,1-0,2 ml de la solución por cada 10 litros de agua del acuario. <br>  Se a?aden al agua del acuario tres dosis durante un periodo de siete días. <br>   <br>  suerte....|`|Ccy6bkTCaa	Pues esta muy raro yo creo que está moribundo????????|`|Qfu5piecaa	mmmm yo creo que es normal lo de lo rojo.... por que algunos betta macho tambien tienen rojo.. aun que pueden ser producto de hongos :S y si se va a fondo y le cuesta nadar es por que esta en las ultimas.... debe tener sus a?os cuando te lo vendieron <br>  ya que rara ves los peces se ponen de lado... hay `peces que hacen esto,... pero los betta no..<br>  mmm imposible que sea por la comida... por que si ya esta satisfecho ya no come mas y deja que la comida pase al fondo lo que lleva a producir enfermedades a tu pez<br>  bueno en fin<br>  investiga un poco en tu buscador favorito no cuesta tanto encontrar informacion sobre estos bonitos peces<br>  saludos|`|c691f6e39a0fca0fceed5c2fe9358e8caa	Amiga, lo mas seguro es q este sobre alimentado!!!!!!!!!!!<br>  <br>  Esta sobre alimentado y esto le causa q la vejiga natatoria se inflame y no pueda nadar!!!

No te preocupes no le pasara nada!!! Al contrario empesara a rebajar eso q tiene demas!!! Dejalo sin comer en las ma?anas y solo dale 1 bolita en la noche, pero es mejor q no le des nada al menos en un dia!!! <br>  <br>  Los bettas cuando estan saludables comen solo 2 veces al dia y las cantidades no son grandes!!!! Te recomiendo q le compres el alimento en pellets o bolitas q es mejor! Yo utilizo Bettabit y Hikari Bio Gold(es muy buena)! Le daras (cuando se mejore) 3 bolitas en la ma?ana y 2 en la tarde o viceversa!!!Tambien le puedes alternar con alimento vivo; larvas de mosquito o pulgas de agua! <br>  <br>  Lo del cambio de color puede ser natural, yo compre uno azul complreto y con las semanas le fue apareciendo unos desteyos de color rojo.<br>  La temperatura del agua debrera de estar entre 26 a 28C.!!! <br>  Y recuerda agregarle anticloro al agua, cuando hagas los cambios!!!<br>  <br>  Por favor, si haces lo q te recomende, podrias escribir para q nos digas como sigue tu pez??

FIqB1xcVaa	Do you have any other pets? <br>  <br>  If not, there probably won't be any problems. Leave her alone for a while and let her roam and explore the house on her own to get a feel for it. She'll be fine.|`|f8a3e1916a1358a55f2e47b7e870da88aa	how old is she?  is she spayed?  do you have other pets?  do you have other people living or frequently visiting you?  any children?  your question is hard to answer without more details.  but as for brining a new dog home.  make sure you have all of the basic needs she will require.  a crate, bowls, leash, collar, premium food, and a basic schedule to follow.  dogs thrive on routine and consistancy.  have ground rules for the dog.  don't let her get away with things that you don't want her to do because she is in a new home.  don't baby her.  every time you allow her to do something you don't like, it will take 3 times as long to correct it,  better to establish rules in the beggining.  be consitant, be loving and be patient.  make srue she is vet checked so you know of any obvious medical problems and follow your vets reccomendations.  any number of problems can occur.  most often it is going potty in the house.  get a crate and crate train her from the beggining.|`|b60b6e8062f11f6cf697468a2c93558aaa	I just recently adopted a Pom ~ and not knowing a whole lot of his back ground I basically had to start from scratch.   My husband and I had 2 other Pom's home so when we brought our new addition home I decided to let nature take its course.  We introduced the 3 and just left them alone and went about our business ~ in time they were running around the house playing, jumping and just having a good ole time.  We were very lucky, he fit in just fine ~ but I won't lie to you it has been a very long 6 months.   At first he was very skittish, any loud or unfamiliar noises scared him ~ he had some potty but it wasn't really anything difficult to deal with.  Today, he is healthy, happy and more comfortable in his new home but it is something we have to work on daily ~ when he gets scared he runs and hides under our bed ~ at first, I was running up and the stairs it seemed liked a hundred times a day to  assure him everything is okay, today I may run up there once or twice sometime none at all.  He is getting alot better and when my husband and I are just sitting around ~ he' a lover boy...<br>  Give your new pet time to explore her new surrounding ~ and when she is uncomfortable or scared, reassure her that your there and you love her...|`|K8t1lPXsaa	you dog will want to explore their new surroundings. it is best to let them pee before you let them inside. let them explore room to room unless you won't allow it in every room. make sure you allow it time to get used to it's living area as well as it's feeding area. submissive dogs may go into hiding for a while but that's ok for the first few days as long as she eats. don't force her out otherwise<br>  <br>  if you have other dogs it's best to introduce them outside of your home so their won't be any territorial interaction. never let them greet face to face. let them greet front to back. sniffing and light scratching is acceptable but no growling or barring teeth|`|OG0J4DSQaa	if u have another dog in yur home, make sure you let them meet each other in a mutual ground like a park to avoid fightings from the start since your existing pet will feel threatened.<br>  Let them like each other first b4 bringing your girl back.<br>  Start housebreaking training immediately when you bring her home.<br>  Start your usual routine immediately. e.g. time for walk, meals, play etc. This makes her feel more secure on what is happening in a new home.<br>  <br>  All the best!

K8t1lPXsaa	nope, not until it was older. train it to go on a newspaper/wee wee pads or litter box train it like a cat otherwise there will be messes. yorkies do not shed much at all the occasional hair when you're brushing and combing but that's it.|`|0xJZJggVaa	No they don't shed.<br>  <br>  They can be impossible to housebreak, even if you are home all day. I wouldn't suggest it.|`|ko7Mi9Fpaa	No its not fair to keep any dogs inside like that for that ammount of time without a potty. You will come home to accidents garenteed. its like asking you to not go for over 8 hours.<br>  <br>  Good news is you can litter train dogs just like cats. so u can have a doggy litter box inside for him/her
R1oT9OPtaa	I have 2 saints one is a short hair and one is a long hair, remember that when dogs pant they are cooling themselves. If you have a long haired Saint you should look into have her shaved, it will make her cooler, I had mine shaved at the groomers, its painless and will help her alot. If she is a short hair she should be shedding alot. St. Bernards are generally very large dogs and what may seem like alot of panting is generally normal. Also if she is laying down after playing or being outside she may just be trying to catch her breath. If this is your first St. Bernard you might want to see about getting a book on St. Bernard behavior, and what to expect. <br>  <br>  Also if she likes water (some dogs don't) take her in the back yard and spray her a little with the water hose.|`|cf9d7a4fc1fb2659abd7a7ad86d605ceaa	Put on a sweater, then a coat over that and YOU see how comfortable it is in the house!  That's what your St. Bernard is going through.  They are made for mountainous conditions and heavy snow!  (Remember the story of the St. Bernard with the flask of whiskey tied on his collar going out to rescue stranded travellers in the snow?)<br>  <br>  Get your dog to a groomer and have some of that heavy coat eliminated.  I had a big Newfoundland/Lab mix and he was hot all the time too.  Cold water wasn't enough and he was finally happy when I got some sense and took him to the groomers.  I also entered it as a recurring appointment on my computer calendar so every 4 months it reminded me to get his coat and nails trimmed.  Worked like a charm.|`|096e860e43223453c5e7f5e27b547ff2aa	Saint Bernards do over heat really easily, even at 50 degrees. Have you got her clipped? If not, take her to a groomer and get her underlayer of fur stripped, and get her clipped close. Have ample water available, maybe a 20litre bucket for a water dish. SB's are designed for heavy work in very cold conditions, like huskys and malamutes.|`|xhT9IVBPaa	Saint bernards get hot very eaisly because they have all that fur. So 72 is like 82 to a dog with a lot of fur. They only thing I could suggest is to just put a fan by the spot she always lays down at and it will cool her off. It's perfectly normal though.|`|xuceSTTnaa	Wet her pads (under her paws) and get her some water. Then get her in a cooler room. A dogs normal temp is 101.7, so 72 degrees is very hot. Quickly, heatstroke can be very deadly in dogs.
b054ac6fdf15a0b6695ec15d9dac3c77aa	ciao!!certo, è normalissimo, tipico poi è nel pit bull!<br>  non c'è alcun dubbio che il tuo cane abbia questo problema se è un cane di taglia grande. Infatti hanno una crescita molto accellerata rispetto alle altre razze(pensa un chihuahua che ha un anno per aumentare di peso di un paio di chili massimo, e un alano che in un anno e mezzo deve metterne su a decine e decine!), ma non omogenea(cresce prima un orecchio, poi l'altro, poi le zampe, poi la coda, poi il busto-sono messi a caso eh, ma rendono l'idea-) esattamente come nell'essere umano(nel periodo della pubertà si cresce tutti sfalsati, prima il naso, poi la bocca, ecc). In questo caso, come dicevo prima, come il pit bull, può essere che sia cresciuta prima la zampa e il tendine no(e quindi, avendo scarsa, se non nulla mobilità, lo fa zoppicare), ma non è da escludere anche che siano cresciute "meglio" prima le altre zampe, e che questa invece sia rimasta ancora gracile..se il tuo veterinario ha escluso patologie genetiche e malattie, non preoccuparti, è normale=) ciaooooo|`|AiHlyR8raa	cambia veterianario. Subito|`|Wg9DcLTqaa	Sì potrebbe succedere se in fase di cresita non è nutrito nel modo adeguato, specialmente se si tratta di un cane di grossa taglia. Potrebbe anche trattarsi di displasia all'anca o al gomito. Ti consiglio di portarlo al più presto dal veterinario|`|dXo88ea6aa	con quali zampe zoppica? gli hanno fatto una radiografia? comunque ti consiglio di andare da un altro veterinario!|`|okyFNKQxaa	No, non è possibile.. o meglio, innanzi tutto i cuccioli hanno una andatura abbastanza strana, molte volte sono poco coordinati.... a parte questo, il tuo cucciolo di rottweiler sarà da adulto un cane di taglia grande-gigante, per questo è importantissima l'alimentazione.... lui nell'arco di pochi mesi dovrà mettere su peso velocemente e aumentare la massa muscolare. Royal canin è un'ottima marca, lui dovrebbe mangiare il puppy large breed (quello per cuccioli di taglia grande). 2 pasti al giorno possono andare bene, io nei cuccioli in realtà ne faccio fare anche 3 o 4 (piccole dosi ma spesso), per poi passare da adulto a due pasti al giorno (mi raccomando mai un unico pasto tutto insieme in un cane di questa taglia e mole... si rischia la torsione di stomaco). Riguardo agli integratori, io in genere non li somministro perchè gli alimenti per cani sono già completi così. Assolutamente no ad integrazioni di calcio come consigliavano una volta, è stato dimostrato che l'eccesso di calcio può interferire con la corretta crescita oltre che con il metabolismo di alcune ghiandole...<br>  Sono d'accordo sul non farlo correre troppo... è pur sempre un cucciolo... tu faresti correre una maratona a un bambino? :)<br>  Se nonostante tutto continua a zoppicare ti consiglio di farlo vedere ad un ortopedico... i rottweiler, come molti altri cani, sono razze predisposte alla displasia del gomito e dell'anca (malformazioni ereditarie)... io in genere a tutti i cani di taglia grande e in particolare a certe razze, sia che zoppichino sia che no, intorno a sei mesi faccio delle lastre alle anche ed eventualmente ai gomiti, poichè se dovesse esserci qualche problema si può intervenire chirurgicamente a quell'età.. se passa troppo tempo poi non è più possibile. ciao|`|4NLIV8Z5aa	Che la crescita non sia armonica nei primi mesi di vita è normale...cioè, sono tanto buffi proprio per questo...quindi secondo me non ti devi preoccupare molto del fatto che per ora cresca solo in altezza...ad esempio il mio labrador all'inizio cresceva solo in lunghezza...sembrava un bassotto! Quello che secondo me è da considerare è la zoppia...come è già stato detto, si potrebbe trattare di displasia, ma di sicuro non dipende dal fatto che cresce in altezza, come ti è stato detto dal tuo veterinario...magari prova ad andare da un altro veterinario e prova a sentire cosa ti dice...io non mi fiderei tanto di quello che ti ha detto...anche perchè non è logico... e non farti problemi per il cibo! Royal canin è perfetto!|`|7QiGNw4Saa	Io credo di no. Se zoppica e non si è fatto male fagli fare delle lastre apposite per la displasia. Se è piccolo puoi far fare quelle preventive.<br>  I cuccioli in genere non crescono allo stesso modo, per un paio di mesi crescono in altezza, poi si staziona l'altezza e crescono come massa e poi ancora altezza e poi ancora massa.|`|jOQpwM5Aaa	non credo..se così fosse i cani da corsa come i levrieri, altissimi, non starebbero in piedi.<br>  corri dal veterinario!|`|2b9a8b972cbc70abba6ec6113ec410faaa	mi trovo daccordo con valyuma77 e l'unica cosa che aggiungo è consigliarti di contattare l'allevamento (?) dal quale proviene il cucciolo. se si tratta di un allevamento serio, i genitori del cucciolo dovrebbero appartenere all'allevatore o, quanto meno, egli dovrebbe essere a conoscenza di eventuali problemi che hanno manifestato i genitori (che sia l'anca o i gomiti, entrambi sono problemi ereditari...). auguri al cucciolo e mi raccomando, non mollare, a costo di consultare diversi veterinari.
LCN5rToxaa	Sicuramente i cani risentono dello spostamento da una zona a un altra perciò ci vorrà abbastanza tempo prima che si reintegri in una nuova situazione.Per farla ambientare alla vita in città potresti per le prime volte frequentare zone poco trafficate e portarla spesso in aree verdi. Gradualmente potresti cercare di portarla in città così che si abitui al traffico. Magari per le prime volte in città potresti tenerla in braccio. Speriamo che tutto si risolga in meglio.|`|5uD6sLdAaa	Si è normale....ora si trova in un altro ambiente e non capisce ancora dove l'avete portata....tu coccolala molto e portala in giro per casa tenendola in braccio....in quanto al tempo dipende....per il mio cucciolo sono bastati anche 4 giorni e lui veniva dall'ungheria....<br>  Ciau buona fortuna|`|PEtwIo4xaa	Tre mesi sono pochi, il cane si abituerà presto.

3NXmSvITaa	Mi sa che la paura è la tua a toccarlo. Se il cane è a casa tua e lo accudisci, lui sa che puo' fidarsi di te e quindi con un guinzaglio e un collare puoi portarlo dal piu' vicino veterinario. Se proprio hai paura, puoi comprare una museruola , ma non credo serva.Comunque, il cimurro, se preso in tempo, si puo' curare.|`|PEtwIo4xaa	Ciao, il cimurro è una malattia per la quale non esistono cure, però se diagnosticato in tempo può esserci qualche possibilità, vai subito dal veterinario!<br>  <br>  So che è contagioso, ma non ti vorrei dare informazioni sbagliate, cmq se coccoli il tuo cane non corri alcun rischio.|`|oiPbjryjaa	si nei cani adulti è più facile da curare se preso in tempo invece per i cuccioli è più difficile|`|7QiGNw4Saa	Ci sono poche possibilità di guarigione ed è contagiosissimo.

3suGBDKUaa	Ciao secondo me la tua gatta si comporta così perchè probabilmente non apprezza il cibo che le dai oppure magari è da troppo tempo che sta nella ciotola e quindi non le garba più. A volte i gatti di casa sono un po' viziati perchè vivono da pascià, certo un gatto di strada non rifiuterebbe mai del cibo!!!  Per quanto riguara il posacenere probabilmente non sopporta l'odore che sprigionano i mozziconi fumati e la cenere, se devo essere sincera la capisco perchè nemmeno io sopporto l'odore delle cicche nel posacenere, è davvero un odore fastidioso.|`|0Dx646J3aa	Per quanto riguarda il cibo quel comportamento può avere due interpretazioni: o è un gesto per proteggerlo oppure non è di suo gradimento.<br>  <br>  Per il fumo invece è un atteggiamento di intolleranza ed insofferenza verso l'odore.<br>  <br>  PS: occhio che il fumo passivo fa malissimo ai gatti,che hanno dei polmoni molto più piccoli dei nostri.|`|4AcDMdCMaa	A quanto pare è proprio una gatta antifumo!!! o meglio intollerante al fumo...invece i gesti del sotterrare le cose sono istintivi e sottolineano la volontà dell'animale di allontanare o meglio smaltire l'oggetto che non si gradisce più averlo tra i piedi...prova con un'altra marca...altro sapore...|`|5d141a533feb70869b16d72a8a0d6c99aa	ciao dottoressa,<br>  <br>  allora copre i croccantini perchè non sono di suo gusto, cambiaglieli..... <br>  il posacenere lo annusa perche avverte la nicotina e quando scopre che non gli piace fa di tutto perchè tu non fumi (ti vuole troppo bene così pensa alla salute di chi la accudisce)<br>  <br>  appena qualcuno si accende la siga e scappa? semplice avrà sbirciato sul pacchetto NUOCE GRAVEMENTE ALLA SALUTE e così piu intelligentemente del padrone se ne va!!!<br>  <br>  NON SPARGERE LA VOCE IN GIRO SE NO QUELLI DELLA MARLBORO ASSOLDANO UN KILLER<br>  <br>  hasta la vista!|`|AiHlyR8raa	Copre il cibo per nasconderlo in natura se arriva qualcun'altro glielo frega per le sigarette non ho idea, sicuramente gli da fastidio.|`|E0JfnayPaa	Complimenti, ha una micia stupenda! E intelligente, molto intelligente: infatti ti comunica che il cibo secco per lei non è cibo (lo copre) e che l'odore di fumo la disturba.<br>  Prova a darle poco cibo per volta, in modo che non prenda cattivi odori. E riguardo al fumo, accettate il suo consiglio ed evitate di fumare. Oppure, cercate di togliere l'odore di fumo dalle stanze prima possibile.|`|p31VYWW6aa	TUTTI I GATTI LO FANNO|`|rKKT7Cflaa	direi che il motivo è sempre da ricercare nel suo straordinario olfatto; il fumo ha un odore molto intenso e questo vale anche per la cenere (ovviamente per una gatta). Per quanto riguarda i croccantini, quelli sono rivoltanti anche per noi, per lei non dovrebbero essere fastidiosi, ma forse è così perchè non le piacciono. Io cambierei marca, lei non sembra apprezzarli molto. Comunque tutto questo conferma il fatto che è davvero molto intelligiente. <br>  <br>  Perchè non ce la descrivi? mi sta piacendo sempre più questa gatta psicotica..<br>  <br>  <br>  --------------------------<br>  <br>  <br>  davvero bellissima, grazie!|`|4O8zyCM9aa	sai xke scavano nei krokkantini? nn preokkuparti e normale! anke i miei gati lo fanno! e il loro istinto naturale scavare appena vedono qualkosa tipo la terra! prima di essere il tuo gatto e un felino! il posacenere? nn fa altro ke annusare ed annusare xke nn konosce qll odore e quindi lo deve scoprire...anke il gatto lo faceva e ho pensato una kosa un po avventaTA...FORSE XKE konfindeva l odore cn qll di un altro gatto!|<br>  xke scappa appena vede la siga?  forse il rumore dell accendino quando fa tik o la fiamma<br>  qualke brutta esperienza!|`|VPgoUUxLaa	Anche il mio gatto copre il cibo...di solito quando non gli piace o se è rimasto un po'troppo nella ciotola e si è seccato (le scatolette intendo), ad ogni modo segnala moooooooooooolto velatamente che non gli piace...salvo mangiarlo lo stesso se nessuno gliene mette di nuovo. Per la cenere, secondo me non ama l'odore e vuole che qualcuno la tolga. I gatti hanno l'olfatto sviluppatissimo, probabilmente le dà molto, molto fastidio. Più intelligente della maggior parte degli umani, trovo|`|dbEXGrahaa	Booooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo|`|lETNCVKYaa	che skizzata....assurdo...cmq penso lo faccia x coprire le tracce...cm qdo coprono i bisogni...magari le da fastidio l'odore|`|57357bb0829a8e656d4db1810684c6efaa	hai una gatta intelligente che pur non avendo la parola riesce a comunicare. La sigaretta è odiata dalla gatta, non perchè fa male alla salute, ma perchè l'odore pungente del fumo è amplificato molte volte dal naso felino e diventa per lei insopporabile.|`|IwtcsEAlaa	Credo che Ivan abbia ragione anche il mio cane quando i croccantini non sono di suo gradimento rovescia la ciotola... mentre per quanto riguarda il fumo solitamente inizia a starnutire!!!<br>  <br>  Ci@o|`|49cca780588fa28ef63925f17591a0b4aa	be lo fanno quasi tutti i gatti!|`|64h4W3sTaa	hahahahhahaa|`|SzU9t57Eaa	Per i croccantini bingo! Non gli piacciono. Prova quelli della IAMS, sono i più deliziosi. Per il posacenere gli da fastidio l'odore e lo stesso per il fumo. Hai mai provato a spruzzarti il deodorante e subito dopo abbracciare la tua gatta? I miei scappano come se fosse un veleno ultratoxico. Una soluzione sarebbe fumare fuori o meglio smettere completamente.|`|yRnYKWXIaa	Ho letto che i gatti con il fumo e sigarette non vanno molto d'accordo. Può darsi che la tua è molto esigente e non vuole che, dove vive lei... si fumi!!!! Ma che gatta che hai!!!

VbjNL45xaa	si, soffre d' auto...soprattutto alla sua tenera età...ad alcuni cani gli rimane il mal d' auto..col mio l'ho abituato pian piano..adesso lo adora!!!...all'inizio si deve abituarlo portandolo per un pò del tipo 20 minuti poi pausa aumentando il tempo di percorso in macchina...quando sarà più grande cmq dovrete fare spesso delle pause, facendolo scendere e bere poco...cmq evita di prendere male le curve e non farlo bere prima di viaggiare...assicurati che abbia già digerito e che faccia i bisognini prima di partire..:))...|`|AiHlyR8raa	Ci sono dei prodotti che l'aiutano un pò.

Il rumore, il movimento e soprattutto oggetti e le luci che scorrono a grande velocità dai finestrini possono causare ansia, nausea, stress. E’ possibile però insegnare a tutti i cani a viaggiare in automobile, e persino a trovarlo decisamente piacevole. <br>  E’ più facile con il cucciolo, per una questione di dimensioni! Quando prendete il cucciolo, dovete insegnargli ad affrontare tutte le situazioni che vivrà da adulto. Con l’automobile il trucco è semplice. Se è tranquillo, tenetelo davanti, sul sedile del passeggero. Accarezzatelo e rassicuratelo, fino a quando non si mette a dormire. Se siete in due, chiedete al vostro ospite umano di viaggiare dietro, con il cane sul sedile posteriore. Oppure davanti, con il cucciolo in mezzo ai piedi. NON tenete il cane in braccio mentre guidate! E’ pericoloso e inutile. <br>  Se cerca di venirvi in braccio, rimettetelo sul sedile senza sgridarlo. <br>  <br>  Se il cucciolo rimane tranquillo anche quando è da solo, potete abituarlo subito al trasportino. Mettetegli una copertina, chiudetelo nel trasportino e partite. Non fermatevi se piange. Sul sedile davanti può patire l’auto perché vede fuori dal finestrino, nel trasportino invece patirà un po’ la solitudine. Non dategli da mangiare e da bere prima di partire. Se vomita, pulite e non preoccupatevi. Succede, le prime volte.

A volte sembra che non ci sia una spiegazione ma ci può essere anche una piccola cosa, che a noi sembra innocua, che li fa innervosire. Anche il chiwawa potrebbe diventare aggressivo, solo che essendo più piccolo ha una bocca più piccola, fa meno danni.<br>  Questi cani sono pericolosi perchè hanno una grande forza nel mordere. Io non prenderei mai un cane del genere ma c'è a chi piacciono.|`|HcbjnnlOaa	tanto per dire quanto ti sbagli.. si stanno iniziando ad utilizzare i rottwailer come soccorritori negli incendi e per ricercare i dispersi..<br>  per la stessa ragione potremmo dire che tutti gli uomini sono assassini, solo perchè alcuni lo sono..<br>  la risposta potrà sembrare banale, ma a domanda banale.......|`|J1qiaO8Raa	il cane non è mai pericoloso (dipende poi dal temperamento di quest'ultimo)!!!! Sono i padroni che spesso trasmettono al cane la rabbia e l'aggressione verso il prossimo. Mi capita spesso di incontrare persone che portano a spasso i propri cani e quando mi vedono con le mie cagnoline,cambiano strada. Tengo a precisare che le mie sono due autentici angeli,non mordono nemmeno se gli togli il cibo dalla bocca. Molte persone hanno un comportamento a dir poco assurdo,e questo purtroppo si riversa sulle povere bestiole. Il fatto che poi i cani attacchino anche dei bambini è discutibile,bisogna pure vedere cosa fanno i suddetti bambini agli animali....un mese fa mi è capitato di vedere in un parco un bambino che tirava ripetutamente la coda ad un gatto e la madre non gli diceva nulla. Iniziamo a farci un esame di coscienza,non diamo addosso agli animali se si rivoltano in certi modi quando vengono infastiditi....torno cmq a dire che la colpa è dei padroni se il cane diventa pericoloso...oggigiorno non bisogna avere paura degli animali ma dell'uomo,basta vedere quello che accade tutti i giorni...|`|M6USqKv2aa	perchè il pericoloso magari sei tu?|`|21f33223ccb02e6da96287ceec03d732aa	quello ke dici e'una stupidata bestiale,il cane e'cattivo se tirato su in certo modo,hai mai visto cm allevano e addestrano i pitbull ai combattimenti?beh se lo vedessi nn diresti queste cose,totalmente diverso da cm lo cresce un amante degli animali credimi,e poi io ne avevo uno fino all'anno scorso e crescendo cn mia figlia di 1 anno e mezzo si faceva fare di tutto e nn la sfiorava.|`|6ca91cbad11e4c72a766fa995b369017aa	E' più cattivo un Pitbull o un Rottweiler?<br>  Non ditemi sono dei cani tenerissimi e affettuosi che non è vero, mio nonno aveva un Rottweiler e fin da cucciolo lo coccolava intensamente e gli voleva bene...è finita che un giorno è rimasto senza un dito...<br>  pochissimi cani sono teneri...non tutti...<br>  cmq tra i due qual'è il piu cattivo? <br>  <br>  premetto che questa domanda non mi piace, ma ti rispondo come padrona di un magnifico e BUONISSIMO rottweiler!!!<br>  <br>  io sono stanca di dover preoccuparmi di cio che pensa la gente di qst cane, sentirmi dire stai attenta che prima o poi ti si rivolterà contro, ti sbranerà, farà del male a te e ai tuoi cari!!oh nn stiamo parlando di serialkiller!!!<br>  sono cani e se ben addestrati possono essere piu buoni di un barboncino!!<br>  <br>  se non sfatiamo questo "mito" continueranno ad essere considerati cani pericolosi e aggressivi, ma ripeto, se ben educati sono degli animali magnifici!!<br>  <br>  certo avendo una stazza gigant non sono molto semplici da "domare" e sicuramente non sono adatti a tutte le persone, bisogna avere polso fermo..<br>  <br>  io amo il mio cane piu della mia vita, e nessuno potrà farmi cambiare idea sulla sua razza perche per me è la MIGLIORE, e ribadisco che non esistono cani CATTIVI, ma cani INEDUCATI...E qst per colpa degli INCOMPETENTI che prendono qst razze per fare SCENA!!<br>   <br>  qsta è una risosta degna di quello k cè scritto<br>  <br>  <a href="http://it.youtube.com/watch?v=OPQqy3s9lnI&watch_response" rel="nofollow">http://it.youtube.com/watch?v=OPQqy3s9ln...</a><br>  <br>  rfletteteci un pò sopra va...xkè esistono cani così pur essendo di una razza reputata "cattiva"???|`|7002f4f70961b264811510b91e24e18eaa	Nessun cane è pericoloso, tutto sta a come vengono addestrati.

I cani non sono cattivi sono i padroni che non sanno essere tali...|`|IKBb3oE8aa	ognuno di noi si associa ad un animale che ha le ns stesse caratteristiche. tale cane tale padrone. chi prende un rottwailer o un pittbull nn lo fa x insicurezza è invece l opposto. significa che ha un carattere forte e come un palestrato che si allena tt i giorni x far vedere i suoi addominali chi ha carattere dominanti a volte lo dimostra cosi. poi i cani diventano pericolosi se c è un eccesso di esuberanza. loro sono quello che noi vogliamo che siano. tt i cani sono intelligenti e fedeli al comando piccoli e grandi e se li lasciamo fare senza controllo o nn siamo in grado di gestirli qs è un altro discorso è meglio a quel punto nn prenderli ne piccoli ne grandi. li renderemmo delle armi pericolosissime!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!|`|Uox0Z2Toaa	Ritengo che gli animali domestici non siano mai pericolosi, semmai sono i loro padroni ad esserlo! Ho sempre avuto cani Dobermann e sono sempre stati affettuosissimi e dolcissimi con noi, nonostante fossero cani da guardia! Uno addirittura l'avevamo trovato abbandonato e il veterinario ci ha detto che probabilmente faceva i concorsi ma dato che gli mancava un dente l'hanno abbandonato... Questo sta a dimostrare quante persone veramente pericolose ci siano, altro che i cani!|`|Yabvlojsaa	ma prima di educare i cani, educhiamo i padroni!!! i cani non sono cattivi... io ho un dobermann di 5 anni... ed è un cane dolcissimo!!!!|`|cEe9JWgDaa	prima di tutto impara a scrivere i nomi delle razze...<br>  lo facciamo (prendere razze pericolose,dici tu e la tua ignoranza) x vedere quanta gente come te si fa i c..a..z..z..i suoi.|`|nkzVdqKcaa	Perchè non sono pericolosi?

Ho 5 amstaff, sai cosa sono? Se li incontri per strada e ti dico che sono amstaff e non pitbull tu inizi subito ad accarezzarli e fargli tante feste....ma tu non sai che l'amstaff deriva dal pit che tra l'altro si chiama American Pitbull Terrier ed è una vera e propria razza anche se non riconosciuta dall'enci e fci i colossi della cinofilia.<br>  Se tu prendi un APBT (un pit) da un allevamento serio scoprirai quanto siano socievole con l'uomo perchè il Pit quello con la P maiuscola non deve MAI e poi MAI dare addosso all'uomo. Nella vera selezione dei Pit vengono scartati i cani che mostrano aggressività verso gli esseri umani. Questo è il vero Pit. Poi si sa di cagnari in giro ce ne sono tanti perchè non basta avere un bel maschio ed una bella femmina e farli accoppiare ci vuole studio e criterio.<br>  Se ti chiedi perchè non deve dare addosso all'uomo prova a rispondere da solo: Per cosa venivano usati un tempo? Se mordevano l'uomo cosa accadeva?<br>  <br>  Sono felice che tanti di voi pensano che i cani pericolosi non esistono ma sono i padroni incapaci perchè questo vuol dire che nonostante la tele e i giornali cerchino di infangare sparando mezze verità la gente, voi ragazzi, riuscite a capire dove sta la verità.<br>  Per gestire un terrier di tipo bull ci vuole polso, coerenza e mai farsi sottomettere, il cane deve sempre capire quale è il suo posto all'interno del vostro branco altrimenti se comanda lui non lo controllate e soprattutto prendendo un cane di questi non pesate di andare tranquilli a passeggio per i viali in mezzo agli altri cani, ci vogliono mille occhi, non vanno d'accordo con i loro consimili soprattutto dello stesso sesso, il perchè si torna sempre lì, diamo uno sguardo al passato.<br>  Sono cani difficili da gestire ma sanno dare anche un amore immenso inimmaginabile, sono cani che non esiterebbero un attimo a dare la loro vita per il loro padrone, sono cani a cui non importa avere un giardino a loro basta stare con il padrone ed avere contatto fisico col padrone.|`|EfVmFfbdaa	Ma che domanda e'?nn e' che il rott.e' piu' o meno pericoloso di un altro cane.......e' la taglia che conta,la forza fisica.....se un cane di dieci chili,meticcio o no,ti azzanna una gamba,al massimo ti mettono dei punti,ma se lo fa uno di 50(indipendentemente dalla RAZZA),allora li,sono cavoli MOOOOLTO AMARI!!!!!!!percio',basta con le razze. PERICOLOSE......<br>  io pero' ti dico che, pur adorando i cani,propendo per quelli piccolini........BATTUFFFFOLOSI!!!!!!!|`|H4nbb7EWaa	prima di tutto non si dice "rotvailer" ma "ROTTWEILLER" e poi non sono assolutamente cani aggressivi!!!!!!! io ho un rottweiller e non è assolutamente aggressivo anzi!!!!!!!!!!<br>  tutto dipende da come vengono educati e come crescono... ricorda che anche un "barboncino" può essere aggressivo se cresciuto male!!!|`|QBooSQgCaa	guarda voglio risponderti francamente, nn sn i cani pericolosi ma i padroni che li addestrano ad essere aggressivi, io per esempio ho un rotvailer e nn ha mai fatto male a nessuno, in piu' e' un giocherellone!! ciao|`|rOt47bHXaa	I cani cattivi non esistono!! <br>  Se tu educhi male o non educhi proprio un animale, è ovvio che ci saranno ripercussioni differenti...se ti morde un pincher ti farà meno male di un pastore tedesco!!<br>  Ricordati che sta nell'intelligenza del padrone a far sì che l'animale si comporti bene in presenza di altri, se poi è l'uomo che è deficie**e e prende cani grandi e di carattere forte senza sapere a cosa va incontro, allora poco si può fare...

Il regroupe deux espèces: le Discus de Heckel (Symphysodon discus) et le Discus commun (Symphysodon aequifasciatus) dont toutes les sous-espèces n'ont pas encore été répertoriées. Ces espèces peuvent être élevées en aquarium.<br>  <br>  Seul le patron mélanique permet de différencier les espèces puisque les nombres d’écailles sur la ligne latérale se chevauchent pour les deux espèces. Celles-ci sont très semblables et peuvent être croisées entre elles. Les discus se caractérisent par leur forme en soucoupe et leurs couleurs qui varient dans des nuances de vert, de rouge et de bleu. La largeur et la longueur du poisson d’élevage est d'environ 20 à 25 cm<br>  <br>  Une caractéristique spécifique du discus est le soin avec lequel les parents élèvent leurs alevins. C'est un fait commun à tous les cichlidés mais il se manifeste d’une manière unique en son genre chez le discus : les parents sécrètent une substance qui suinte au travers des pores de leur peau pour nourrir leur progéniture; les deux premiers jours après l'éclosion, les petits se nourrissent de leur sac vitellin puis ils migrent sur le dos des parents et se nourrissent de cette substance pendant 7 à 10 jours. Dès que les petits sont suffisamment développés, ils se nourrissent de fa?on autonome. Il n’est pas rare de voir les jeunes s’agglutiner autour de leurs parents.<br>  <br>  Les discus sont des poissons grégaires, qui ne s’épanouissent qu’en groupe. Bien que d’un naturel calme, le discus est un cichlidé : la hiérarchie est omniprésente dans le groupe, elle se manifeste lors de l'accès à la nourriture, de la constitution des couples et des pontes. Chaque période de ponte fait l’objet de joutes qui peuvent être assez violentes.|`|MHJc93koaa	Une grosse galette ( de 3 à 8cm) qui vient d'Amazonie je crois.|`|btwZ9mmhaa	un poisson d'eau douce en forme de "disque"<br>  attention, il est assez fragile en aquarium

Gli uomini non si accorgono delle sofferenze che infliggono a questi poveri animali, partiamo dall'abbandono, ma dico, che lo prendete a fare un cucciolo se poi diventato grande o perchè scomodo, lo abbandonate? Su questo problema hanno provato di tutto, dalle campagne di sensibilizzazione agli spot in tv e poi che motivo c'è di lasciare un cane in mezzo all'autostrada, almeno lasciatelo nei pressi di un canile o di un veterinario così almeno non vengono investiti dalle auto. Il problema sta tutto nella mente umana che si considera superiore a tutto ma anche nella maturità mancata di alcuni che induce all'infantilismo e quindi porta a non rispettare gli impegni presi, come quello di avere un amico animale.<br>  Non so se lo stato sta applicando le nuove leggi sull'abbandono e sui maltrattamenti ma spero che coloro che commettono azioni ignobili come queste vengano divorati dalla coscienza e dai sensi di colpa.<br>  A proposito di maltrattamenti, ti lascio un sito dove puoi firmare una petizione contro le pellicce fabricate in cina, ci sono anche due filmati strazianti, uno è senza audio e l'altro con, e crudeli che fanno piangere perchè sono commesse delle attrocità incredibili perciò se sei molto sensibile te lo sconsglio ma ricordati di firmare la petizione.<br>  Il sito è: www.nonlosapevo.com<br>  ciao<br>  marta|`|z0P5w27Eaa	bhe io ti do perfettamente ragione <br>  quando io parto per le vacanze mi tocca vedere cuccioletti abbandonati <br>  io quando li vedo lì in mezzo al nulla da soli sensza cibo senza acqua senza niente mi fanno una tenerezza che voi neanche immagginate io farei di tutto pur di salvarli <br>  figuratevi io una volta stavo viaggiando con i miei genitori e mio fratello eravamo su una autostrada molto pericolosa ad un 'tratto vedo un cagnolino piccolissimo un pò più grande di un telecomando di una televisione di 5 pollici<br>  era stato abbandonato da una macchina che si trovava davanti a me io in quel momento avevo tanta rabbia dentro di me fino al punto (se potevo)di scendere dalla mia macchina e rincorrere la macchina che avevano abbandonato il cucciolo e dargli tante legnate in testa ma siccome nn potevo nn lo fatto e quindi sono scesa dalla macchina facendo fermare mio padre al centro della strada e ho preso il cucciolo e quando sono arrivata in una città siamo andati da un veterinaio che mio padre conosceva e l'abbiamo fatto visitare perfortuna era in ottime condizione e poi 'abbiamo portato in un canile e neanche il tempo di darlo che subito se  lo sono comprati<br>  io ora dico ma si può abbandonare un cane ???<br>  perchè i cani sono simili a delle persone perchè hanno un cuore e una vita davanti e poi anche perche è ingiusto abbandonare o maltrattare i cani e qualsiasi altro tipo di animale perche preima di comprarsi un animale uan persona ci deve pensare molto perchè gli animali sopratutto i cani hanno bisogno di affetto e di cure perciò hanno bisogno di molta attenzione <br>  ma santo signore esistono anche i canili!!! che sono fatti apposta per queste situazioni<br>  allora io dico nn abbandonati i cani perche hanno bisogno di voi e sopratutto del vostro affetto <br>  un bacione dalla vosrta cara amica|`|zx7cf9D1aa	io non potrei per nessuna cosa al mondo abbandonare il mio cane, ormai è uno della famiglia e mi viene il magone solamente pensare che un giorno morirà.<br>  quindi la gente che abbandona i cani per me è insensibile e dovrebbe morire in maniera straziate e soffrire almeno quanto lo fanno i cani separati dai padroni.<br>  ps alcuni cani non muoiono soltato di fame o schiacciati dalle macchine, ma anche di crepacuore.

lqlWZgLMaa	Get "Off" or spray what he chews with a vinegar solution. <br>  <br>  Buy him some chew toys & play with him more. <br>  <br>  It's quite normal, cats chew at that age cos they're bored. It's like their pre-teen/early teen years. He could also be losing his last few baby teeth that's why he's chewing.<br>   <br>  Tell him off if he's chewing things he shouldn't be, take the item away from him. Use a firm voice, cats understand tone not words. (Don't say, No, no.. in a baby/naggy voice. :-) even tho I catch myself doing that all the time.)<br>  <br>  He should stop that chewing soon.|`|PRG7OiTJaa	my cat bites chews claws boxes paper it is just want they do you could buy toys it could work but it did not for us|`|nAK82h6vaa	probaly bored. it has to do something.|`|BNFpkozpaa	Cats need to play and they love to hide inside and play with boxes.  If he doesn't have appropriate toys then he will start playing and chewing on things that belong to you.  He is still young, so think of him as a little kid.  He needs to be entertained.  Especially if you're not giving him much attention.  Give him toys and play with him more often and you will see a change in his behavior.  And let him play with the boxes.  Is he really hurting anything?|`|WpsPLKS7aa	It's natural for some cats to like to chew...   He's not being bad, he's just being a cat.   You'll just have to pick up the things that you don't want him to chew on.  And, make sure he has toys and things that he can chew on.|`|xvhTMwBNaa	have you bought him toys? my cat can play for hours with a little fake mouse. try a bunch of toys to distract him. there are also safe sprays you can buy from the pet store. spray them on the boxes or other things he chews and he will stay away from them.|`|2Axpy58daa	You could use the squirt bottle to squirt him any time you see him chew on something he is not supposed to, but this will only work when you are around.  I have a cat that did the same thing, more when he was younger, less when he got older.  I found out he had dental problems.  By the time he was 2 years old he really needed his teeth cleaned (mine always ate dry food)  I was finally able to afford the dental when he was 4 years old and they had to remove a molar.  Since then he does not really chew on anything any more.  It could be a behavior thing, or it could be a teething problem.  He might be chewing because his teeth hurt, that would need to be followed up with your veterinarian.|`|8e8e576dc50090db862d05826a00d89aaa	You didn't mention if it's a full grown or just a baby.  My cats do this too.  He's just trying to play with things.  I rec'd my cat because he ate all the feet off of the previous owners barbies! HA!   Try this stuff called Bitter apple, it works wonders, buy him some new toys and if this doesn't work, give him a box to chew on.   If he's only chewing boxes, you've got it lucky!|`|kdpQ52araa	I also have a cat, named Navy.  He is 2 years old and used to do the same thing!  Try to spray your cat with a water squirter every time he misbehaves.  He will get the point!  Hope this helps.
AA10552861	Try taking a warm wash cloth and wiping out the gunk, if it continues or gets worse call your vet to have her eyes checked, she may have contacted some kind of eye infection.|`|5d5d03879d88748bb42d13bf3c0010a5aa	Take a washcloth and soak it in warm water and clean it off her eyes. That gunk can cause pre-mature cataracts and/or blindness. But, if its REALLY just pouring from her eyes, she needs to see a vet, as this could be a bad eye infection, and she'd need drops to clear it|`|K8t1lPXsaa	if it's just regular eye gunk like little boogers then all you need to do is wet her face and comb it out with a fine flea comb. some dobs are more prone to this than others and it doesn't have to be allergies|`|YIiQVInGaa	Our dog had gunk on his right eye. It was glued shut with it. We wiped it of and it just came back. I think it is because of his food allergies. Anyways, we took him to the vet and found out that it was just a mild infection. Wait 2-3 days and see if it gets better. Wipe the goo out as soon as you see it. Our dog got paniky and peed when he couldn't open his eye! LOL! Best of luck with yuor dog.!|`|YJmGf4RLaa	take her to the vet.   could be allergies  or she could have picked up a URI at the kennel.   <br>  <br>  she is UTD  on everything?   I'm sure she is or they would not have boarded her.|`|3Q1I3uvmaa	Hmmm, it could be several things.  As some has said, it could be allergies.  All dogs/cats have eye discharge . . . but an excessive amount is NOT NORMAL!<br>  <br>  Since she just came home from the kennel this way, I would highly suspect it being something she picked up there!<br>  <br>  Is she coughing?  This would mean that most likely it is Kennel Cough, also known as Parainfluenza.  It is highly contagious and is spread by infected air they breathe.  It makes them ill and can turn into pneumonia.  It is easily curable with medications, but it's more serious if it goes into pneumonia.  (But I would have thought that the Kennel would have required her to be current on the Kennel Cough Vaccine.)<br>  <br>  Regardless, of all our knowledge we are sharing with you . . . You should contact your Veterinarian.  If it is as bad as you have described, I HIGHLY recommend making an appointment ASAP.<br>  <br>  In the meantime I would clean her eye with Saline Solution . . . used for contacts.  It is sterile, which is VERY important.  Use a clean cloth when you clean the next time.  (I DO NOT RECOMMEND USING A COTTON BALL, SINCE FIBERS FROM IT COULD GET INTO HER EYE & IRRITATE IT MORE!) As far as how often to clean . . . I would every time she has an accumulation of it in her eye.<br>  <br>  I hope that it is just something simple and she will be well soon!!!|`|AA11413045	I think that you should clean her eyes with kleenex (soft tissue paper) or with water and then with kleenex. If it continues, then you should take her to the doctor and he should give some eye drops for her, which should take care of it.<br>  <br>  I would like to add this to my comments....sorry to hear that u mentioned that it's disgusting....in my opinion it's not.....we sometimes have the same problem and we don't consider it disgusting for us then why should we think like that for our pets....afterall they are our kids (atleast one should raise them as his/her kid). Sorry, I didn't mean to sound rude or offend you but it just hurted me when I read that in your question.<br>  <br>  Arpita|`|WcMJ8u04aa	Do you have any kind of agreement that you can see a vet for free and that they will pay for anything wrong with the animal..I hope so!!   In the mean time use a cotton ball with warm water to clean it as often as needed.  You will have to see a vet...The dog probably needs antibiotic ointment for the eye..<br>  <br>  Dahrma|`|ko7Mi9Fpaa	Ok it could just be eye muck (just like people get when we sleep) but ti could eb an eye infection. Best to take her to the vet to check it out.<br>  <br>  My collie constantly gets eye muck, the vet told me its nothing to worry about, i just wipe it with a damp tissue. but its worth getting her check out just encase especailly since she has been in kennels.|`|qBaORER2aa	you might want to talk with the vet & see what's wrong,that might be a serious infection & you need to look upon that,so please do so ASAP. Good Luck & Best Wishes to you & your new puppy.|`|HPftG1EOaa	i got this stuff from the local pet store called pet tear stain remover works well

okyFNKQxaa	quando si trova un cucciolo probabilmente una delle prime cose da fare è trovargli subito na sistemazione, anche provvisoria. I canili spesso non li prendono perchè sono strapieni e accettano solo quelli feriti e malati (purtroppo questa è la realtà di roma). E' anche vero che un cucciolo denutrito rappresenta un'emergenza quindi in quel caso magari gli trovano un posto. Quando un mio cliente trova un cucciolo, io sconsiglio il canile tranne che se strettamente necessario... in canile ci sono anche molti cani malati e un cucciolo potrebbe rischiare di ammalarsi a sua volta. Non mi risulta che la protezione civile nè gli enti animalisti se ne curino, ma scaricano cmq la responsabilità sul canile di zona.  La cosa che si può fare per trovargli il più in fretta possibile una famiglia che lo adotti è mettere volantini in giro, sui giornali e far girare una mail tra gli amici.. che a loro volta la girano ad altri amici ed il cerchio si allarga.|`|6EkuRKJ0aa	Se e' un cucciolo si puo' solo portarlo al canile. Se invece il<br>  cane e' gia' grande io risalirei al proprietario tramite <br>  l'anagrafe canina e non esiterei a sporgere una bella<br>  denuncia al suo ex padrone (  incivile e meritevole di una <br>  bella sanzione ).   Ovviamente anche per il cane piu' grande<br>  la futura dimora sara' il canile in attesa di un padrone che<br>  realmente ama gli animali e che sappai donare tutto l'amore<br>  che meritano questi doni del Signore.|`|iRTXSw7zaa	Solitamente prima di passare al drastico rimedio "canile" se si ha la possibilità lo si tiene con sè sino a quando non gli si trova un padroncino altrimenti ci si può rivolgere ad un qualsiasi veterinario ( per legge sono obbligati a tenerli là dove la persona che lo trova non può occuparsene ) o ad un negozio di animali.|`|AiHlyR8raa	Lo puoi tenere e accudirlo. Dopo vai dal veterinario che ti dà i consigli giusti. Se non puoi tenerlo chiami i vigili urbani è dici che hai trovato un cagnolino  e dove l'hai trovato. Loro informano ulss sezione veterinaria che lo viene a prendere. Il cane viene tenuta nel canile sanitario una decina di giorni. Poi se non ha un padrone (cioe non ha micriochip o tatuaggi) e nessuno va prenderlo. Viene portato in un canile. Se è un cucciolo ha buone probabilità di esserre adottato. Se è vecchietto finisce i suoi giorni in una gabbia. Sperando che il canile non sia un lager.|`|F2gyPFgvaa	prenderlo e curarlo, oppure portarlo in qualche negozio di animali, così oltre a dargli da mangiare magari riescono anche a trovargli una casa, ciao|`|yBoHKCe0aa	boooooo|`|3NXmSvITaa	Se si ritrovano cuccioli abbandonati e siamo nell'impossibilita' di adottarli,deve essere fatta denuncia di ritrovamento presso i vigili urbani della citta' interessata. A loro volta i vigili contatteranno il canile di competenza che, per legge, a meno che non sia strapieno, ti invitera' a portare il cane ritrovato. Comunque la prassi è molto lunga e chi ritrova un cucciolo deve tenerlo a casa per giorni, poi ti ci affezioni e quando il canile ti chiama l'80% delle volte succede che decidi di tenerti il cucciolotto.|`|AHWv9miVaa	telefonare alla protezione animali..poi dovrebbero pensarci loro.|`|Fz077dGpaa	Se hai la possibilità di portarlo a casa ed accudirlo per qualche giorno è meglio. Dopodichè evitando le associazioni di protezione animali troppo grandi e famose che si occupano della tartaruga del Guatemala o del pinguino della Groenlandia, mentre alcune città d'Italia traboccano di randagi in pessime condizioni di salute, rivolgiti a qualche rifugio per animali abbandonati della tua zona. Prova a fare una ricerca su google. Sono dei rifugi gestiti da volontari, ma anche qui, nonostante la loro enorme buona volontà e il loro amore, non è che puoi ricavare tanto, visto che le loro risorse economiche sono piuttosto limitate e spesso i loro spazi sovraffollati.

Also if you have more than one cat get another litter box, some cats do not liek to share that space, and will try to do it other places in the house.|`|1ooPFFlsaa	Give it a litter box or put some newspaper in a bathrrom you don't normally use. Make sure there's no carpet. Whenever your kitty 'seems' like it has to go pee or even if you don't know, show it the place with the newspaper. Later on if you can, try watching it go outside, just in case it might run away. I have two cats, and it worked.|`|Z96p7qYhaa	OK breathe . . . . this will be relativley easy to fix but it will take a few days. First step is to wash every article she's peed on. Nature's Miracle (found at most retailers, pet stores, and maybe your supermarket) is an enzymatic cleaner. This means it breaks down the chemical scent marker that kitty leaves after you wash out the main pee that tells her it's OK to pee there again. If the pee has seeped into the mattress soak it down too. Remove all temptation for her - clothes in a closed hamper, closed closet, or tied trash bag, no access to your bed room when you aren't there.<br>  <br>  Next check out the littler box. Is it too high for her to easily get into when she needs to go? Is it dirty, full, and way gross? Is it a brand new box and still smells like plastic? (In which case wash it with dish soap, give it a bleach bath rinse rinse rinse rinse and let it air dry) Is the litter too deep? Does she even like the litter? Is the box in a loud or heavy traffic area? Is it in an out of the way place? Does the litter have a really heavy perfume-y smell? Most cats prefer unscented litter - the perfume smell is for people not cats.<br>  <br>  Finally check out kitty herself! Is she healthy? Indirectly watch her when she goes potty. Does she meow a lot? It may hurt her to go in her box so she thinks "hey this box is causing this!" (the smartest cat thinks on the level of a 2 yr old. Think like you're 2!) Is she drinking a lot of water? Too little? Is she still her kitty self? If you have not taken her in for a vet check-up, make an appt and go! Your vet can help with any other questions you may have. And don't over look the vet techs - chances are eveyone in the office has a pet or has had a similar problem and may give you some insight.<br>  <br>  One last thing! Cats are HUGE on smells! Next time you clean out the box and put fresh litter in (at least once a month for one kitty) take an article of clothing she has peed on, cut out the pee piece, and duct tape it to the bottom. Kitty will smell it and realize this is where she can go. Lots of praise and attention after she goes in her box wouldn't hurt either!|`|mM2nG87raa	Kitties peeing on the bed or on clothes is a sure sign that one of two things is wrong. Either the litter box is not kept clean enough to suit the cat or there is something about the litter box that deters the cat from using it. Now that the cat has started doing this it will be hard to get it to stop. The remedy is keeping the litter box cleaned out better, making sure the box is in a place the cat does think is spooky, keeping the bed(s) made when not in use, keeping clothes put away, and putting the clothes that need washing in the hamper or some other place the kitty can't get into.|`|04015e2c9787d3d2704d053be85a754faa	Is her litter box by an appliance? If so, she may be scared of it and doesn't have anywhere else to go. Make sure her litter box is in an area that has nothing by it to scare her.

K7Jk523vaa	i found this online....hope it helps! GOOD LUCK!<br>  <br>  If we find Giardia, how do we treat it? <br>  <br>  Here we go again; treatment is controversial too. There is a question about when to treat. If Giardia is found in a cat without symptoms, should we treat the animal? Since we should not know if G. cati can infect man, we often err on the side of caution and treat an asymptomatic-infected animal to prevent possible transmission to people.<br>  <br>  If we highly suspect infection with Giardia, but can not find the organism, should we treat anyway? This is often done. Because it is often difficult to detect Giardia in the feces of cats with diarrhea, if there are no other obvious causes of diarrhea, we often treat the animal for giardiasis.<br>  <br>  There are several treatments for giardiasis, although some of them have not been FDA-approved for that use in cats. Fenbendazole is an antiparasitic drug that kills some intestinal worms and can help control giardia. It may be used alone or with metronidazole. Metronidazole can kill some types of bacteria that could cause diarrhea. So if the diarrhea was caused by bacteria, and not Giardia, the bacteria can be killed and the symptoms eliminated. Unfortunately, metronidazole has some drawbacks. It has been found to be only 60-70% effective in eliminating Giardia from infected dogs, and probably is not 100% effective in cats, either. In some cats, it can cause vomiting, anorexia, and some neurological signs. It also can be toxic to the liver in some animals. It is suspected of being a teratogen (an agent that causes physical defects in the developing embryo), so it should not be used in pregnant animals. Finally, it has a very bitter taste and many animals resent taking it – especially cats.<br>  <br>  Quinacrine hydrochloride has been used in the past, but is not very effective and can cause side effects such as lethargy, vomiting, anorexia, and fever.<br>  <br>  Furazolidone has been used effectively in treating giardiasis in cats. It can cause vomiting and diarrhea and should not be used in pregnant cats.<br>  <br>  Now we come to yet another unknown. It is possible these treatments only remove the cysts from the feces, but do not kill all the Giardia in the intestine. This means even though the fecal exams after treatment may be negative, the organism is still present in the intestine. This is especially true of the older treatments. So treated animals could still be a source of infection for others.<br>  <br>  How can I prevent my pet from becoming infected with Giardia? <br>  <br>  The cysts can live several weeks to months outside the host in wet, cold environments. So lawns, parks, kennels, and other areas that may be contaminated with animal feces can be a source of infection for your pet. You should keep your pet away from areas contaminated by the feces of other animals. This is not always easy.<br>  <br>  As with other parasites of the digestive system, prevention of the spread of Giardia centers on testing and treating infected animals and using sanitary measures to reduce or kill the organisms in the environment. Solutions of Lysol, bleach, and quaternary ammonium compounds are effective against Giardia.<br>  <br>  How do I control Giardia in my cattery? <br>  <br>  Infection with Giardia can be a big problem in catteries, and a multi-faceted approach is needed.<br>  <br>  Treat Animals: Treat all nonpregnant animals. On the last day of treatment, move them to a holding facility while a clean area is established. When the animals are moved back to the clean area, treat them once again.<br>  <br>  Decontaminate the Environment: Establish a clean area. If possible, this can be the whole facility. Otherwise, create a few clean runs or cages, separate from the others. Remove all fecal material from the areas since the organic matter in feces can greatly decrease the effectiveness of many disinfectants. Steam clean the area. Quaternary ammonium disinfectants used according to manufacturer's directions or a 1:5 or 1:10 solution of bleach can usually kill the cysts within one minute. Allow the area to dry for several days before reintroducing the animals. These solutions can also be used to clean litterboxes. Rinse out very well and allow to dry before reusing. NOTE: Use extreme caution when using quaternary ammonium compounds and bleach solutions. Use proper ventilation, gloves, protective clothing and follow your veterinarian's recommendations.<br>  <br>  Clean the Animals: Cysts can remain stuck to the haircoats of infected animals. So before moving the treated animals to the clean area, they should be shampooed and rinsed well. Especially concentrate on the perianal area. <br>  <br>  Prevent Reintroduction of Giardia: Giardia can be brought into the cattery either by introducing an infected animal or on your shoes or boots. Any new animal should be quarantined from the rest of the animals and be treated and cleaned as described above. You should either use disposable shoe covers or clean shoes/boots and use a footbath containing quaternary ammonium compounds to prevent people from reintroducing Giardia.<br>  <br>  Remember, Giardia of cats may infect people, so good, personal hygiene should be used by adults when cleaning litter boxes or picking up the yard, and by children who may play with pets or in potentially contaminated areas.|`|22loNNsIaa	check here:|`|AA10859773	I don't know, but I just happened across an article about it.

They have such beautiful, soft skin. I was born in the year of the snake which is good. I know some people might think they are boring or some people might be creeped out by them but they really are such amazing creatures.<br>  <br>  I like cats too. My parents got our old cat, (who is know deceased due to old age) from a hardware store before they had me or my older brothers. What had happened was this little baby kitten, the size of a human hand had crawled in off the street and was so hungry it was trying to eat bugs.<br>  <br>  The people at the hardware store didn't know what to do with him and where asking people if they wanted a pet cat, so my parents took him home and not having any cat food feed him some tuna. When he was finished he looked up as if to ask for more, which is why we called him Oliver (You know, Oliver Twist the orphan). So, from my birth I had a cat and loved him very much.<br>  <br>  I might have said ferret before, but my memories of having a ferret is sad. He died recently, the vet expects it was from an infection. I know it was best for him to go to a vet for the proper care, but it still makes me sad thinking he died there all alone when I wish I could have been there with him.

The fondest memories are the memories of our runs and chasing rabbits in the open fields. The times just lounging and sleeping next to each other even when the wife disapproved. The sacrifices I made for you were all worth it and I have no regrets. Only the wish to do it all over again. You are going to a better place tomorrow, a place that will free you of the pain you are suffering. You have held on like a trooper and never ever complained. I hope I gave you all the love you needed and wanted. You surely gave it to me. I wish you have a good trip to dog heaven and I hope one day we will meet again. You have no idea how much I love you and I will never forget you. You will always be a part of me. You will be missed my "coco girl" and thought of always. I love you.<br>  <br>  Have a safe trip,|`|FIqB1xcVaa	Well, if it could be anything...I'd have to say a wolf. <br>  <br>  Wolves have been persecuted and given a bad reputation throughout history. "The Big Bad Wolf" in the fairytale of Red Riding Hood, and other myths and legends such as "werewolves" make these creatures seem brutish, no-good, and almost demonic in nature. <br>  <br>  They are shot by farmers for killing their livestock, and were stupidly removed from many national parks such as Yellowstone for decades, and then were reintroduced because the missing link in the food chain was harming the ecosystem. There are places in the U.S., even entire states (I believe Texas is one), that have been declared "wolf free" when there previously were many, many healthy and thriving packs of these creatures. <br>  <br>  For all their persecution, I find an inner beauty, strength, and honesty in wolves. They are always upfront animals: if they are angry, they show so. And yet, even if they fight with another pack member, there are no lasting grudges whatsoever. What happened, happened, and they consider it the past, move on, and forget it. <br>  <br>  Wolves are confident as well, yet secluded in nature. They try to avoid the smallest human and yet take a buffalo down without a second thought... <br>  <br>  When you look into a wolf's eyes, you see history in motion--the great struggle they've fought to stay alive in this unforgiving world. <br>  <br>  Anyway, without rambling on for longer, I like wolves best. :)|`|f7931085939634259f34eb4b5a5e49d9aa	Rabbit.

After my cat died my bf/s cat had a liter and I wanted one but couldnt decide which one to take. I pushed the 2 black ones away and was choosing between a tabby and black and white spotted one and they both didnt like to be touched and they freaked me out. So I decided to pick up a black one and he sat in my lap and starred into my eyes and he purred.I fell in love with him and chose him. Hes the sweetest cat you will ever meet and now I love black cats and have opened my eyes to their beauty.

krXQaZAfaa	Hi there, I am a Veterinarian Technician and a Dog Obediance Instructor specializing in puppies. I hope I can help you! <br>  <br>  First of all, congratulations on your new puppy! How exciting! Secondly, I do have two suggestions/strategies to help you stop your puppy from nipping! There are two different types of biting, agressive and play. It sounds as though the puppy is play biting. Please be aware if play biting is not stopped, it can lead to agressive/territorial biting even over something as silly as a sock they want to play with. I am also wondering if it is a quick bite or a clenched on bite, there are different ways to go about those. <br>  <br>  Anyways, luckily for you, it is not too late!! The first strategy I would like you to try is something littermates would teach each other when they were very young pups still with mom: Each time your puppy bites you I want you to let out that loud, earpiercing, yelp that I know you have heard from other dogs. That is how other dogs communicate to each other that the behavior is not acceptable. <br>  <br>  It is important that you DO NOT yell, hit, or bite your puppy back (trust me, I have seen EVERYTHING! It will create fear in your pup), instead let out a loud yelp. It might take a few times for your puppy to realize what your message is, but remember it is so so important to remain consistant! Don't yelp every other time she bites, yelp each and every time or you will leave your puppy confused as to why sometimes she can bite, and sometimes she can't. <br>  <br>  If that doesn't work (it really should if done consistantly!) then you can try to associate a word with a behavior and a consequence. Think when you try to teach your puppy to sit. You associate a word ("Sit!") with a behavior (when they actually it) with a consequence (a cookie, praise, rubs, etc. remember... consequences are not always bad! they are just a result o a choosed behavior!). So apply the whole sit concept to the biting. Your word could be as simple as "Ouch!" (say it sternly, you can use a louder voice, but don't yell) when she bites (behavior) and the consequence (as SOON as your puppy releases from the bite reward them with a cookie, praise, rub, etc. Again, it might take a few tries (ok, maybe a week, so again, stay consistant. <br>  <br>  If you feel like the cookies, praise, etc. are not working you could absolutely still use your word "Ouch!" and then immediately pick your puppy up (not in an angry way, just sternly) and put her into her crate for 1 minute. Go on doing your business as she is crated, ignore any barking, crying, eye contact. Then after the minute is up let her out and praise her! Each time you say "Ouch!" and place her in her crate she will associate the behavior (biting) with the consequence (crate). <br>  <br>  Dogs are smart and want to please, she will catch on! Just remember to stay calm and assertive!|`|EHurqS4zaa	Don't hit him, he will associate your hand with it and this will only make the nipping worse. You could try a spray bottle with tap water, and as you squirt the pup say NO NO firmly. My dog loves water, but this worked for me since she didn't like getting squirted in the face (just don't squirt his eyes). she doesn't nip anymore :)|`|12e5087b4f73416b1532466ae65c54abaa	How old is he? Puppies play biting in the litter.  This determines who's the "boss".  It also teaches them bite control.  So when the puppy nips you react as another puppy would: yelp "Owwwww" then turn around and ignore him until he comes back licking you to "apologize".  This will tell him he's biting too hard.<br>  Another issue will be dominance.  You want to always be the alpha dog, the pack leader in his mind, so not good to let him bite you.  To get that point across you flip him on his back and gently press his belly. Also play with him in that position, lay on his back and rub his belly for a while. This is the submissive position and will tell him you are his leader and he will always follow you.|`|593mNsrzaa	For the nipping try this. This method helped me allot. It has given me much better results than the many other methods I have tried. This was written for Corgi puppies but it applies to most all puppies.

Use a calm but sturdy voice, and also what worked for me was breath spray. Like Listerine Pocket Pack sprays. Spray them in there mouth so they can taste it and then they will stop becuase the taste is so strong. But it will not hurt them.|`|AA10246643	Clap your hands together to make a sharp noise, close to his ears and say very loud,  NO  BITE, over and over.It may take a while for him to catch on, but he`s still a puppy. In due time, he will learn. Good luck.|`|YVJFqfX2aa	First off, DO NOT slap at a puppy.  It'll make them hand shy and training will not be easy.<br>  When a puppy bites or nips, let them put your hand in their mouth.  Then using your thumb and forefinger, press down on the tongue and say in a gruff voice, "No Bite"!.  Do this anytime the puppy goes after your hand.  This will teach them that you mean business and at the same time, not make them afraid of you.  After you do that, offer them your hand again.  You'll get a lick or two, but no bites!

First to keep desiese out of the den. A rotting body will attract maggots, deseases and other nasty things that could make the live puppies ill. Another reason is because the den is hidden to protect the litter, but a rotting corspe is bound to smell strongly and attract predators. These are not the only reasons but this should give you a pretty good idea.|`|rQROgA0Qaa	Instinct. Dogs are domesticated wolves. When wolves give birth to stillborns (or their pups die later) they eat them. One reason is the protein and vital nutrients that the meat can give them...after all, they lost a lot to their puppies and need to regain their strength. There are other reasons too...but it's just instinct.

t7n3EY39aa	il gatto non dovrebbe pagare biglietto se nella sua gabbietta...piuttosto copri la gabbia durante lo spostamento, per sole 4 ora non credo avrà bisogno di mangiare, ma bere probabilmente sì.|`|a62906e1903512270fd18a5d5b4843c1aa	Mi pare che i gatti nn paghino il biglietto, comunque mettila in una gabbietta comoda x la sua taglia ,tienila coperta con un panno scuro così sta + tranquilla e lasciagli un pò d'acqua ,vedrai che 4 ore nn sono poi così lunghe. Buon viaggio ciao.|`|GzjPjQTNaa	Mettila nella gabbietta oscurata con un panno nero (se sono al buio i gatti hanno meno paura), non darle da mangiare ma solo poca poca acqua se fa molto caldo.<br>  Ma è strettamente necessario farle affrontare il viaggio?

Se si tratta di vacanze la mia sta tranquillamente da sola per un paio di settimane, basta darle 2 ciotolone tipo quelle per la pasta di acqua e crocchette (per l'acqua ci sono anche dei beverini che funzionano sul principio dei distributori d'acqua con un serbatoio ribaltato a testa in giù)|`|Yx73zECpaa	Mettila nella sua gabbietta e tienila digiuna più che per i bisogni ( i gatti trattengono molto) per evitare che soffra il treno.<br>  <br>  Però dalle da bere ogni tanto e se è tranquilla falle una carezzina dalla porta della cesta.|`|aGBA32MJaa	è un bel casino...allora i bisognini li dovrà trattenere per un po'....o sennò li farà nella sua gabbietta....<br>  Comunque mettila nella sua gabbietta con dei croccantini e dell'acqua( di importanza vitale con questo caldo).....l'idea del telo nero non è male, così almeno non si impaurisce e rimane traumatizzata ma forse c muore dal caldo lì dentro sennò XD....durante il viaggio dovrà soffrire x forsa un pokino, ma vedrai qnd arriverete sarà solo un po' fiacca e si riprenderà subito!!!!

5EcJr6IUaa	sai benissimo che il gatto non ha bisogno di molte cose perchè è particolarmente indipendente.<br>  ovvio che ha bisogno delle sue ciotole cibo.acqua e lettiera.<br>  scegli un punto della casa che preferisci e in cui può sentirsi tranquillo e posiziona li la sua cesta per dormire. al momento fagliela vedere e se li non gli andrà bene te lo farà capire perchè si coricherà altrove.<br>  per la lettiera non temere, basta che gliela faccia vedere e andrà da solo. <br>  anch'io adoro i gatti. ne ho una di 21 anni che adoro e mi occupo di altri 18 gatti che purtroppo non hanno casa e voglio a tutti un mondo di bene :-)|`|Ion6thxLaa	quando la mia gatta era piccola (ormai 9 anni fa) per i primi tempi l'abbiamo tenuta dentro casa e durante la notte miagolava sempre... per quanto riguarda i bisognini, era già abituata ad andare a farli nella lettiera, quindi non saprei consigliarti una tecnica precisa, mi dispiace... :-/ <br>  p.s. come lo chiamerai? fammi sapere.. ciao ciao|`|Wg9DcLTqaa	Solitamente i gatti a 4 mesi sono già abituati ad usare la lettiera. Se così non fosse, ti consiglio  i primi giorni di portarlo spesso nella lettiiera. Le cose che devi comperare prima sono: ciotole per acqua e cibo, lettiera, sabbietta, tiragraffi in modo che il gattino abbia un posto dove farsi le unghie.|`|AiHlyR8raa	Allora i consigli dati fin qui vanno bene. in più posso dirti che esite un prodotto che si chiama D.A.P. che riproduce gli ormoni della mamma gatta che allatta.

Prima di tutto concordo con l'idea di andare a prenderlo dopo le ferie, poichè i primi tempi è meglio far stare il cucciolo da solo il meno possibile. Prima del suo arrivo ti consiglio di comprare: ciotole (meglio non di plastica), crocchette e scatolette per cuccioli (ti consiglio royal canin kitten34 come crocchette e almo come scatolette), cassetta igienica (io la uso chiusa, se hai spazio in casa puoi anche prenderne due), sassi per la cassetta (ti consiglio vivamente di abituare da subito il micio al silicio perchè non fa odori ed è molto comodo), una cuccia, qualche gioco (palline, topini finti ecc...), spazzola per il pelo, tiragraffi (per abituarlo subito a non farsi le unghie su tende e divani). Non mi viene in mente altro. Per la cassetta generalmente se i micini hanno avuto la mamma hanno imparato da lei ad utilizzarla, inoltre il tuo avrà 4 mesi e dovrebbe essere già abituato. Nel caso non lo fosse, appena arrivate a casa mettilo nella cassetta con i sassetti dentro e magari muovi la sua zampina facendolo scavare. Se fa i bisogni fuori urla NOOO e mettilo subito nella cassetta, magari mettendoci anche i suoi bisogni. Se lo scopri dopo puoi usare anche repellenti oppure aceto sulla zona sporcata per dissuaderlo. In ogni caso i gatti imparano subito ad andare nella cassetta, non preoccuparti. All'inizio permettigli di esplorare l'ambiente e se hai intenzione di farlo vivere anche fuori aspetta uno o due mesi a farlo uscire. Per il resto, goditi il cucciolo!!!
K8t1lPXsaa	a havanese is not as commonly bred in most places in the us as lets say..a beagle. they are pricey and a well bred one from a good breeder most like won't be under $700. there personality is a lot like their cousins the maltese.<br>  <br>  they can be energetic but also reserved. most are generally one person dogs. that doesn't mean they don't like other people but they usually form a stronger bond with just one person. they require grooming like the maltese and you will need to brush and comb it often to avoid mats and tangles.<br>  <br>  i would recommend going to the akc website to get more info on them and they can refer you to a good breeder in your area <br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.akc.org/breeds/havanese/" rel="nofollow">http://www.akc.org/breeds/havanese/</a><br>  <br>  you may also be able to find a few shelter rescues on www.petfinder.com . most likely the majority of them will be havanese mixed though but if you are a willing to travel a little you can get a young purebred one|`|wUcKWB7Waa	My friend's parents in FL breed them!

She is a pure breed and could've been a show dog though. This is a answer I had for another question on the behavior of a havanese:<br>  <br>   My family got a dog called a havanese in Febuary. The havanese is in the same family as a maltese, bichon and more. They are a hypoallegenic breed. The get to about 13 pounds but still pretty little. They are really cute and they look real good with a puppy cut. Where it is still short but a little longer. Most people keep is long though. Our dog is about 10 pounds and she was born on X-mas. She barely ever barks and she is REALLY friendly.She goes nuts when she sees other people but calms down quick. She is Great. LOok up pictures of havanese and I guarantee you will fall in love with them. Everyone who comes to our house wants to take her home with them.

LPEO6AsCaa	It would be very difficult for you since your move so often.  You would have to apply for Non Profit status in each state and the comply with each states rules for that status.  <br>  I think it would be wonderful and your heart is in the right place but realisticly it would only work for you if you were in one place for a great number of years. <br>  Have you ever thought about being a foster home parent??  This is something you could do anywhere you went.|`|04015e2c9787d3d2704d053be85a754faa	Well if your rescuing animals off the street a problem comes up. If someone's dog say, ran away for a day or so and you picked it up and cared for it. Well what if the person looked all over and by the time they got word out, you were gone?
OqWjmJcJaa	If you want your rabbit to be left alone, whatever you do, don't get a beagle or a terrier of any kind. They were bred to hunt and chase (and sometimes kill) small mammals and will have a really hard time learning to leave the bunny alone, even when it's in its cage.<br>  Maybe one of the toy breeds like a Pomeranian, miniature poodle, something like that. If you want a little bigger dog, maybe a Sheltie (Shetland Sheepdog.) It may try to herd the rabbit, but probably would leave it be when it's caged.<br>  There are a lot of other good breeds but this is just what comes to mind off the top of my head.<br>  <br>  Whatever dog you decide to get, make sure you give it LOTS of exercise and attention when you are home.  It's normal for dogs to be able to adapt to their owners being gone at work for 8 hours or so, but if they don't get to run/play/exercise when their owners are home, they will get bored and restless and will become destructive and/or neurotic. That goes for ANY dog, not just the "high energy" breeds.|`|20244512d33d2e4edb6c55c4bcd03bbaaa	I have a mini dachshund and he is great, his name is oscar.|`|b39KDuxraa	I had a dog like Benji and it was really smart,  it was some kind of terrier and I hear a Jack Russell is a good little dog also.|`|K8t1lPXsaa	it sounds like you need a slightly older dog. you really shouldn't be gone that long when you have a young puppy. a dog about a year old should suit you and most of them are already house broken and utp. on shots. look into a rescue dog at www.petfinder.com|`|OG0J4DSQaa	can consider a poodle. <br>  b4 committing to any breed, talk to as many people about the nature of the breed and the committment before getting one.<br>  Also, consider adopting one and save a dog!|`|SEvhwIXQaa	Do a search for "dog breed information" and use one of the dog breed search engines.  It will ask you questions about your lifestyle and then recommend breeds to you.<br>  <br>  A few breeds I am familiar with that are great small breeds are pugs and pomeranians.  If you saw the movie MEN IN BLACK, the alien dog was a pug.  Pugs are cute and ugly at the same time, full of personality, good companions.  Pomeranians are the "rich snobs" of the doggie world - they are cute as a button and they know it!  They parade around like they own the world.  But they are content just sitting in your lap.  If you don't like much physical activity, they are great companion dogs.<br>  <br>  If you are high energy, a Jack Russel is an excellent choice.  I think you need to try a dog breed calculator (I vaguely remember one being at www.dogbreedinfo.com).  Also, when you are ready to adopt one, please consider getting a puppy/dog from a dog rescue group and save a life.  www.petfinder.com  Good luck.|`|H59CwDKgaa	ill suggest a chihuahua.when i was in dominican republic with my aunt she had a chihuahua and we were gone for lke 7 rs too.i suggest you buy lots of toys for ur dog and turn on the radio for some music.my dog is gonna get used to 7 hrs of seperation cause of school.i suggest you get the dog when ur still working so it can get used to you not being there and not start barking for you to come.i kinda got my puppy in vacation cause school doesnt start in 2 weeks.|`|pQC6vtyfaa	a Griffon Bruxellois is a GREAT small dog. they are not cheap but they are definately worth owning. think of the tan and black dog out of the movie " as good as it gets". i have had 3. they are very versatile. great with kids. can be as energetic or as lazy as you want them to be. they come in a few different colours with either a long or short coat.
c54e2f5c83bf1bd09e903f2739f1d4eaaa	First: read up on cycling your tank. You will kill fish if you don't cycle it. Read up on that by searching it on Google, or reading this article:<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.cichlid-forum.com/articles/fishless_cycling.php" rel="nofollow">http://www.cichlid-forum.com/articles/fi...</a><br>  <br>  Next, it's all up to your taste about sticking your tank. Don't get something of everything; most fish prefer larger groups of their own species. Corydoras catfish are amusing and very active bottom-level fish. They help clean food that falls to the bottom, but should be fed sinking bottomfeeder pellets. They should be in groups of 3 or more. They are sensitive to nitrate buildup and salt in their water.<br>  <br>  Tetras are also a common choice, as there are many colors and shapes to choose from and the shoal well. They are also very hardy fish that will tolerate a lot of conditions from temperature swings and ammonia spikes to different food. They are mostly mid-level to surface dwellers and prefer groups of 5 or more.<br>  <br>  Feeding should be by level, fish and amount eaten. Higher level fish should be fed floating food, like common tropical flakes, so as to not compete with bottom dwellers, and bottom level fish should be fed sinking foods, like bottom dweller pellets for the same reason. It may take you a bit, but carefully monitor how much the fish eat in the span of 2 or 3 minutes and adjust the amount you give them accordingly. A group of 4 or 5 Cory catfish will need one sinking bottom dweller pellet a day, for example, but if they compete with other aquiarium denizens, like Apple snails, there may need to be one in the morning and another at night to feed everyone evenly.<br>  <br>  Cleaning aquariums is actually easy if you keep a good 'cleanup crew' - usually snails. Three Apple snails will keep a 20 gallon tank fairly sparkling, with you only needing to do a 25% water change every week.<br>  <br>  Don't overstock your tank is another vital tip. A rule of thumb is one inch of fish per gallon, and one gallon per snail. Make sure that you know a fish's environmental and social needs before you add it - some fish need live plants to use as hiding places, others will tear up live plants and harrass your other fish.<br>  <br>  And, to top all this off, get a 5 gallon tank, fill it with cycled tank water. This is your hospital and quarrentine tank. ALWAYS quarrentine any new fish you get for at least 2 weeks in this tank. And, if one of your fish gets sick, you can move it to this smaller tank. It is a lot easier to treat a disease or parasite in a hospital tank than it is to treat all of your fish in your main tank.<br>  <br>  Good luck and welcome to fishkeeping!|`|04015e2c9787d3d2704d053be85a754faa	Well, goldfish are now out of the question. How about some nice guppies. They won't get the tank too dirty if you clean it well. Rule of thumb 1 fish=one gallon but with guppies you could probably do 2 fish= one gallon if they won't get too big. The only bad thing about guppies is your open to have too many too soon so maybe go with the one fish=one gallon in case you end up with a dillema.|`|BoGBfPH3aa	i like ballon mollys they are easy to care for and some water frogs. well sents you got a 20 gallon i would clean it all the way out at least every 2 months and just do hafe a water change the month inn between that i have a ten gallon and the people were i got my take told me to clean it once a month and chang hafe the water every 2 weeks. keeps its nice and clean. good luck|`|hAgDTT7Uaa	well i had a sucker and 2 gold fish in a 10 gallon before or maybe you could kinda have almost everything as long as they are a nice fish and are the same size as the suckers|`|cc24SZXPaa	Goldfish are OK, Molly's are easy fish but when you go to the store to buy more look for the same aggression level.  Some are community, semi- aggressive and aggressive you need to stay in the same grouping so the aggressive fish don't eat or beat up the more docile fish.|`|PBBdapCWaa	For information about setting up, cycling and maintaining your tank, I would like to refer you to the link in my profile.  There are several excellent articles there that will help a lot with getting you started.  In addition, you can ask questions and get feed back from knowledgeable aquarium keepers.<br>  <br>  To be honest, I would return the two algae eaters.  They really make poor aquarium fish as they get large, don't eat algae well and get quite mean as they get larger.<br>  <br>  Feel Free to email me if I can help.<br>  <br>  MM
LCN5rToxaa	Entrambi sono cani stupendi....però ci sono alcune differenze:<br>  Il Chihuahua è più un cane da vita in appartamento,che però ha bisogno di esercizio fisico.Ha tutto sommato poche esigenze:necessita di due piccoli pasti al giorno,uno al mattino e uno alla sera,i cibi secchi completi garantiscono tutti gli elementi nutritivi per una buona crescita,apprezza molto il pesce,meglio se bollito,il pelo va spazzolato con una spazzola di gomma,le chiazze di lacrime che si formano intorno agli occhi vanno pulite con una garzina imbevuta di camomilla,ha bisogno di un cappottino per l'inverno,fa la muta due volte l'anno ma non in modo eccessivo,vanno pulite le orecchie,spazzolare i denti e tagliare le unghie.<br>  <br>  Per quanto riguarda il Beagle...devo dire che è un cane che mi piace moltissimo,ma il mio preferito resta il Chihuahua.<br>  Il Beagle è anche lui un cane d'appartamento,ma ha bisogno di uscire spesso di casa.è molto testardo ma con un carattere allegro e vivace.Anche lui,come il Chihuahua ha poche cure:Il mantello va mantenuto in buono stato di pulizia:non è lungo e non richiede altro che un paio di spazzolate settimanali.Le orecchie vanno pulite tutti i giorni:sono soggette,infatti,a dolorose otiti.<br>  Ora però ti dico quello che preferisco:Il Chihuahua,che fra due mesi acquisterò presso un privato. A te la scelta.Ciao|`|4zjSRkajaa	nessuno dei due...e cmq dipende dallo spazio che hai in casa...il chihuahua è brutto...il beagle è simpaticissimo ma scatenatissimo...e quando cresce diventa un po' tozzo...|`|AiHlyR8raa	Attenta un cane ha bisogno di tante attenzioni il beagle è un cane molto forte un segugio perciò ha bisogno di tante attenzioni lunghe passeggiate ed impegno tanto tanto impegno.

Io ne ho avuti e sono stati due cani straordinari!|`|vvVE4tVDaa	E' come chiedere se è meglio una Matiz o un bulldozer.<br>  Non c'entrano nulla.<br>  Il chihuahua è un cagnetto di classe "toy", poco dannoso anche da cucciolo a causa delle ridotte dimensioni, che si affeziona moltissimo alle persone e richiede una partecipazione sempre "attiva" da parte dei proprietari. E' un giocattolino buffo, insomma.<br>  Il beagle è un cane da caccia, capace di dare grandi soddisfazioni ma anche di fare grandi disastri. La mia Jazzy ha un istinto irrefrenabile all'ululato, è legatissima al territorio e segue in modo preciso e puntuale qualsiasi traccia. Se è al guinzaglio e sente qualche odore, si mette a tirare come un trattore.<br>  Insomma: caratteri diversi, taglie diverse, pesi diversi, esigenze diverse...<br>  In entrambi i casi, però, è richiesta una cura elevata e un affetto sconfinato. Anche quando crescono.

Fallo visitare al tuo veterinario che potrà escludere che la sua tosse dipenda da altre cause (come ad esempio il cuore).. se il suo problema è davvero la trachea e il suo problema è così grave, si puo' intervenire chirurgicamente.|`|oiPbjryjaa	tende a soffocarsi come?con oggetti?sii più preciso..|`|AiHlyR8raa	Vai da un bravo veterinario.

S4t6OPPhaa	I gatti incominciano a fare le fusa da neonati, durante l'allattamento. I piccoli segnalano così alla madre che va tutto bene e che il latte sta giungendo a destinazione. Mamma gatta, che può starsene comodamente sdraiata e rilassata, risponde a sua volta ai gattini facendo le fusa, rassicurandoli della sua buona disposizione. Il fenomeno delle fusa tra gatti adulti deriva probabilmente da questo primo rapporto tra mamma gatta e i suoi cuccioli. Lo stesso vale per le fusa che il gatto adulto manifesta nei confronti dell'uomo, dimostrandogli gratitudine, amicizia o dichiarando il proprio bisogno d'affetto.<br>  Il rumore "doppio" che il gatto domestico riesce a produrre, inspirando ed espirando, lo caratterizza rispetto agli altri felini i quali sanno ruggire, ma non sono in grado di fare delle vere e proprie fusa.Ciao|`|c4f6ea51c611e4f2579483a73bba738eaa	Non solo i gatti, ma buona parte dei felini che, come ben sai, sono tutti predatori attenti e letali.<br>  <br>  Il che provoca in loro uno stato di perenne tensione anche nella zona collo-trachea, tensione che - se sciolta in uno stato di rilassamento - un po' come per il russare provoca un "tremolio" a bassa frequenza dei tessuti molli della zona interessata, dando luogo al "ronzìo" che noi definiamo "fusa".<br>  <br>  Buone cose, e a presto.<br>  <br>  .|`|dmRDQYVgaa	il gatto ha tanti modi x far capire alle persone che sta bene,sta in tranquillità e che la carezza che gli si sta facendo gli piace,e le fusa è il modo migliroe che puo percepire l'uomo,anche noi abbiamo tanti modi per dimostrare che siamo in tranquillità ecc...e poi sono gatti e ogni specie vivente su questa terra ha un proprio modo di vivere|`|yOcge6Zlaa	Ronronare per piacere: fare le fusa è una caratteristica tipica dei felini quando sono in relax e felici. Le fusa sono un suono a bassa frequenza prodotto nondalle corde vocali bensì da qualcosa che si trova nel torace. Di norma significano piacere e felicità. Mamma gatta fa le fusa quando   <br>   <br>  nascono i piccolo e quando iniziano a succhiare; i micetti le fanno quando si sentono al sicuro, al caldo e quando succhiano il latte della mamma. Tuttavia il gatto fa le fusa per calmarsi anche quando è nervoso e inquieto|`|AiHlyR8raa	Perchè è tranquillo e sisente molto bene, un pò come se ti grattano la schiena e tu fai mmmmm|`|B1xhw1QOaa	Le fusa costituiscono una misteriosa forma di comunicazione, sul cui significato gli etologi continuano ad interrogarsi senza avere ancora raggiunto una spiegazione definitiva.<br>  Rappresentano uno dei primi messaggi che la mamma invia ai propri piccoli: la gatta inizia a fare le fusa durante il parto e i cuccioli, appena nati, ne avvertono le vibrazioni. Sono proprio le fusa, insieme al calore del corpo materno, a guidarli verso il ventre per la prima poppata. <br>  Ma le fusa sono anche il modo con cui il gatto ci comunica i propri sentimenti.<br>  Non solo di felicità e di soddisfazione, come comunemente si crede, ma anche di noia e di sofferenza. Quante volte il gatto in difficoltà (es. dal veterinario) emette sonore fusa proprio per farsi coraggio. è evidente che hanno anche un potere rilassante! <br>  E non è tutto: se le ascoltiamo con attenzione, scopriremo che variano in intensità e in frequenza. Più sono irregolari, più il piacere del gatto è intenso.  Se sono uniformi e monotone, significa che il gatto manifesta segni di stanchezza o di noia.<br>  Il significato di questo comportamento è ancora sconosciuto (come molti altri aspetti del nostro piccolo amico, del resto), ma le ipotesi che si fanno sono davvero affascinanti. Nel suo libro “The tribe of tiger”, Elizabeth Marshall Thomas, riferisce un fatto curioso. La studiosa dice di avere incontrato in Africa una persona che era stata aggredito da un leone e che si era miracolosamente salvato. L’uomo, che era un missionario, raccontava come il leone lo avesse afferrato con le fauci ad una spalla e lo avesse portato nel folto della foresta. Ma affermava anche di non avere provato ne dolore ne paura ma di essere rimasto come ipnotizzato da una sorta di ronzio che proveniva dal corpo dell’animale. La Marshall Thomas conclude avanzando l’ipotesi che le vibrazioni delle fusa nei felini potrebbero provocare un rilascio di endorfine, cioè sostanze calmanti, capaci di fare rilassare la preda che in questo modo cesserebbe di lottare, abbandonandosi al suo destino. E le fusa potrebbero anche aiutare gli stessi felini nella guarigione dalle malattie. Un fatto straordinario, se si pensa che recenti studi hanno dimostrato come le fusa del gatto siano davvero terapeutiche, in grado di portare, con le loro vibrazioni, giovamento a chi soffre di dolori reumatici.|`|Df1Gqj46aa	perchè si rilassa...|`|EO4cM9Wraa	perché noi respiriamo?|`|FWy8uVUOaa	per dimostrare che prova affetto verso il proprio padrone.<br>  come il cane fa le feste, lecca...il gatto fa le fusa!<br>  è una dimostrazione di affetto.|`|b4cp2BR8aa	xkè è un gatto -.-|`|dk3M8u2Daa	il gatto ha degli ossetti in gola che quando prova piacere vibrano!!!|`|kk0W3Hrfaa	xkè è infastidito da qualkosa o qualkuno|`|1927964967626a5e16c6a05529fdb2deaa	per dimostrare affetto e far capire che è tranquillo|`|8353eb1bd11f8cb773806cf12ab1c807aa	perchè è contento e rilassato! adoro i mici che fanno le fusa!!!

Non che maschi e femmine insieme non vadano d'accordo ma potrebbero sorgere problemi nel periodo del calore in cui la femmina respingerebbe il maschio e bisognerebbe tenerli almeno una settimana separati. Se invece il tuo labrador è castrato o hai intenzione di sterilizzare il golden che prenderai va benissimo anche una femmina. <br>  In bocca al lupo!!<br>  Ciao

K8t1lPXsaa	dogs won't usually hurt puppies because they are young. they need to learn the pecking order of things which is where the growling comes from. this however in not acceptable behavior. don't allow your dogs to set the pecking order. set it for them. it's most fair to set it by the dog you got first down to the dog you got most recently. give the first dog attention then the second and the third. same goes for playing and giving treats until they get used to being around the new dog. also don't make them share toys when you first get a new dog this can incite agressive/territorial behavior. growling or lifting the lip should not be tolerated. playful barking and light pawing is ok and should be expected<br>  <br>  i have four dogs a rottie/shepherd mix, pit, husky and a yorkie. my rottie mix and pit got along like best friends when i first got my pit but when i rescued my husky there was a little tension that only took about a week or so to rid them of because my husky was still getting used to being around other dogs. <br>  <br>  they all wanted to show the yorkie who was boss because my yorkie has a spoiled nature. that's where i had to step in. they weren't allowed to play untill they laid down and were calm. too much rough housing and they had to lay down and relax again. now they all get along and they pretty much let my yorkie have his way over everything even though he just hit a year old a few weeks back|`|fdc238a041e621b4c0ba8feabf253058aa	Your dogs will establish a pecking order. Just give them time. If they don't like something the puppy does, they will growl or snap him/her. Sooner or later, he/she will learn the dominance order.|`|XW4Uq3bwaa	This Should not take to long but it really depends on the dogs i would watch them at first but then i would not worry about it. the first week to two weeks is the time when it is most likly going to happen ! Good Luck!|`|oks6Ythiaa	I have two dogs. They are both shitzus. When I first got my second dog, my first dog didn't like her at all. She would bark and her and scratch her a little bit. We thought they would never get used to each other, but they eventually did. It took them a few weeks, but now they can't be seperated. It always takes time for older dogs to get used to new puppies and vise versa. The older dogs think that the puppy will replace them, so just give it some time and let them be around each other,  but just watch them closley. Make sure you don't pay too much more attention to the puppy then the other dogs. I am sure the larger dogs will be fine with the puppy. Soon they will all be friends.... =)

zQiYKgMLaa	That really depends on what size tank you have.  Almost anything goes great with Plecos except other plecos in a small tank.<br>  <br>  If you have a tank that's 20gallons or less you're better off sticking with a school of tetras and/or corydoras Live bearers and dwarf gouramis work too.  If you have a 30" tank, you could get yourself a pair of Kribensis or Bolivian Rams. and stick them in a with a school of tetras or barbs.  Or you could go with some Brichardi cichlids.<br>  <br>  If your tank is 3' long, you could either go with the barbs, tetras or rainbows.  You could go with most of the Gouramis and semi aggressive fish.  OR you could start looking into the smaller cichlids like Convicts, Firemouths, Salvinis, Angelfish, certain Pike Cichlids, (some of the smaller Africans) etc...  Stay away from dwarfs and the Blue or Gold Rams as they tend to be very difficult to keep.<br>  <br>  If you have a 75, 90 or 110 you could go with some of the mid/larger cichlids (Oscars, Green Terrors, Jack Dempsey, Texas Cichlids, etc...)<br>  <br>  If you have a 125+ you could add even larger fish like Red Terrors, Red Devils,|`|90f0d5a46475f9e37a1bef9b82cb4f54aa	If you want truly easy to take care of breeds you should look at platies, mollies and cories.<br>  <br>  Cichlids are supposed to be hardy but in my experience they are very sensitive to chemical peaks in water.<br>  <br>  At least platies are bright and colourful and very active.  Mollies are a decent size and swordtails are interesting to look at.<br>  <br>  You don't sound very experienced so I wouldnt rec more exotic species.  You can safely and easily house platies, mollies, sword tails with cries, tetras and plecs.<br>  <br>  No, plecs require vegetative based SINKING foods.

Cxi1DNiMaa	I feed raw or cooked.  There is no science to be certain  that it is good or bad. We are approaching the emotional topic of raw feeding even though that wasn't your question.<br>  <br>  The issue of biotin absorption and possible salmonella infection are both issue. But I believe they concern is largely overstated.<br>  <br>  For Raw Eggs: An egg is one of the most efficient foods that can give fats and protein in their diet. This is also true for cooked egg. I've been feeding raw eggs for 2 1/2 years with no ill affects such as a salmonella infection. This gives an idea to the cleanliness of our food supply.   A raw diet includes diversity. Feeding the same foods every day would lead to deficiencies.  As in the wild, a dogs diet will vary by what is available to eat, and the dog likely doesn't get days of the same food. <br>  <br>  Cooked Eggs: You can be relieved of the issue of biotin absorption and salmonella. You have to cook it. One could be fooled into believing a cooked egg is safe, and give it everyday. A diet with variety is better than the same food daily.<br>  <br>  I feed my dogs twice a day to minimize the risk of bloat. Of those 14 feedings, they get a raw egg 2-3 times a week.  I also feed raw chicken, and that has a greater risk of salmonella than the egg. The dogs haven't been affected. <br>  <br>  If the concern about salmonella and poor biotin absorption concerns you, cook the egg.<br>  <br>  There is no data proving raw or cooked is better. You need to make that gut decision of what you are comfortable with. <br>  <br>  Regardless of what approach you take, good luck with your dog.|`|9CNbUvqxaa	Well, a boiled egg is much safer and yields the same benefit as a raw egg-it promotes shine to the coat(the white). The yellow gives additional protien. Good for any dog and any breed.<br>  Raw eggs aren't considered safe because of how they've been known to harbor bacteria and such, causing serious sickness or even death to your pet.|`|VOGX6orvaa	Yeah raw eggs are really good for dogs...all the protein will make his coat nice and shiny! And they say that humans can get sick from eating raw egg, but you don't have to worry about that with dogs because their immune systems are so much stronger than ours. I just wouldn't give him more than one at a time because it would probably give him diarrhea.|`|l86FRuhnaa	Is raw egg what?|`|2Pss68GOaa	Sorry, I'm going to disagree with the consensus.<br>  <br>  Don't ever feed your dog people food.  Once upon a time, it might have been fine, but dog's really do better with a totally balanced diet.  My old dog would always react with diarrhea whenever he got hold of people food.  My young pup who has yet to have discovered the pleasure of people food has lovely firm stools that are easy to pick up after.<br>  <br>  And once they get a taste for people food that leads to begging behaviour.  No thanks.<br>  <br>  Secondly, would you eat a raw egg yourself given concerns over Salmonella poisioning?  It's no different for your dog.  <br>  <br>  Your dog will get a shiny coat, etc. with good quality dog food.  Stick to that.<br>  <br>  Cheers!|`|Ymk9ruhGaa	Raw eggs Contain an enzyme called avidin, which decreases the absorption of biotin (a B vitamin). This can lead to skin and hair coat problems. Raw eggs may also contain Salmonella. <br>  So.... I although it may not hurt your dog, I personally would want to be on the safe side.  :)<br>  Hope that helped!!!|`|kVvV4bc2aa	Raw eggs are fine for any sized dog, actually they are very good for them with lots of protine and can also help with their coats.|`|AA10412922	Raw egg yolk,yes.The raw whites inhibit absorbtion of biotin,a b vit.|`|m81dfyOYaa	I'm not quite sure what your question is but I'm going to answer based on the assumption that you're asking if it's okay to feed dogs raw eggs.  I've been feeding my dogs raw eggs for 6 years without any ill effects. In fact everything I feed them is raw.  Both my dogs are sturdy and healthy. I 'll add an egg to a meal for the protein.  Some people will only feed the yolk because the white contains an enzyme called avidin which decreases the absorption of biotin (vitamin B). I don't fed enough eggs to worry about vitamin B deficiency.

Vk6s6VTAaa	Don't mind some of the other people here, there is indeed such thing as a teacup chihuahua, they are tiny chihuahuas and they're cute. But the ones I've seen are either very scared and shake around others or they are "vicious-like".  If you want a dog to play with and take on walks, get one that is a little bigger. Look under "toy dog" classifications and pick one from there. Teacup chihuahuas are very fragile, so maybe you should go for a more robust dog. |`|uVCgjvgAaa	It Depends on how you raise him or her. Teacup Chihuahuas require a lot of care. They are often especially breed from the runts of their parents litter. Feed them frequent, small meals b/c they cant store enough glucose to go long with out eating and r prone to getting hypoglycemia. Put a sweater on him or her before going out in cold wheather. Put a drop of baby oil in their eyes before giving them baths plus they get dry irritated eyes often anyway n u dont wanna make it worse with the soap (skip baths for short haired- just clean it with a damp cloth). SOCIALIZE the dog early to other dogs and people becasue these dogs r tiny and they become mean and easily frightened. |`|JaFbuUUWaa	There is no such thing as a teacup, if you buy one labeled 'teacup' chances are it won't be able to do much of anything, and it won't be healthy.<br>  <br>  Now a standard chihuahua is another story, they are only about 6 lbs, my Mom has 2, one is very playful and will fetch for hours, the other one, is a sucky baby and always just wants to cuddle, so it depends on the individual dog.|`|GYUEIZfEaa	Chihuahuas can be playful sometimes. They do like to challenge dogs who are bigger then them, so if you are taking it for a walk in the park i suggest you pick him/her up if him/her is starting to growls/bark at another dog. they can sometimes be snippy and not want to play, but then again a lot of dogs are like that! a dog is almost like a human, each one has a different personality! |`|Fi5WGgxeaa	There is no such thing as "teacup", the word was invented by puppy mills to charge more money from uneducated buyers.  It's a sad business to create sickly dogs for profit, I hope you won't support that abuse.|`|ocqR34O9aa	Ok, being a Chi breeder, I will set the record STRAIGHT.  No, there is no such thing as a "teacup".  As with any other breed in the world, there can be a runt of the litter.  Sometimes and NOT always, these pups can be sickly or have health issues even as adults.  However, with toy breeds there can also be litters of very tiny pups that only get to be 3 lbs or so when grown.  (These are a result of careful breeding and not from just breeding two tiny dogs together!)  This is what the general public refer to as "teacup".  <br>  First, when buying a pup make sure YOU weigh, or see the actual weight of the puppy.  A very general rule of thumb is to triple the weight at 8 weeks of age and double the weight at 12 weeks of age to get an approximate weight of the pup when it reaches adult age.  (I would be wary of anyone selling a "tiny" before a minimum of 12 weeks of age)  See the parents as well as the litter mates to make sure they are healthy dogs.  There is no question that there are unscrupulous breeders out there who will take your money by misrepresenting a pup as a tiny or "teacup".  But keep in mind that just like human children, there are no guarantees...some may grow bigger than expected.<br>  Second, yes, these tinies need special care.  They must eat well or they can develop hypoglycemia (low blood sugar).  Food should be left available for them all the time.  This means more difficulty house breaking, but they do very well with a litter box lined with newspaper.  They cannot tolerate drafts or cold weather.  A heavy blanket and/or heating pad solves this problem easily.  They do not do well with small children because they can be easily injured.  There is more, but if you search some breeder websites you can gather more info.<br>  Third, Chi's are often believed to be nasty little critters by people who have never had one or had a bad experience being around one.  Since they are so little they learn quickly to be defensive.  They need a lot of socialization or will become very possessive of their person and bark, growl and even bite anyone that comes near you.  They can be aggressive to other dogs but usually this is to "warn off" a bigger dog, again because of their little size.  <br>  I have had many different breeds of dogs in my lifetime, both big and little and I have yet to find a better toy breed than the Chi.  They are so loving and funny and have personalities and characteristics unlike any other small breed.  <br>  And last, I personally have two "tinies" that are 3 and 3 1/2 lbs.  They are 1 1/2 and 4 years old.  They still act like little puppies and are silly, sweet, playful and healthy as horses.  Over the years I have sold many "tinies" and have repeat customers who came back and purchased a second or even third one.  These pups make great little pets if you can provide the proper home, are very careful about where you purchase one and never buy sight unseen over the internet.           |`|VaYjl71Laa	they are sickly runts... and will cost a fortune in initial cost (total rip-off) and then later on a fortune in eventual inevitable vet bills.|`|b71b424fc067bf9c2eea3e5af4efb630aa	Teacup chihuahuas do not exist.<br>  <br>  They are a backyard breeder ploy to sell runts that they breed with other runts..  They are usually sickly, overpriced and dont live as long as a normal sized chihuahua.<br>  <br>

iNYaNMtqaa	The dog itself can cost from $300-$900 or more. IF you get it from a reputable breeder it will be in the higher end. From just some random person it would be less - but chances are the vet bills would be high.<br>  <br>  Total cost of owning a dog is much higher. First shopping trip for a crate, collar/leash, bowls, toys,grooming supplies, food, and ID tags run about $100-$300 dollars. First vet trip (a must when you get a puppy) includes shots if the breeder didn't already do them, flea/tick and heart worm prevention, any lab tests could be $30-$100 or more. Spay and neutering cost anywhere from $30-$100 or more depending. Licensing is about $20.<br>  <br>  After that, the annual cost is about $600 and up for grooming, vet visits, flea/tick and heart worm meds, boarding, and food. Training can cost $100 or more depending on the trainer.<br>  <br>  Good Luck!|`|K8t1lPXsaa	the price of dogs vary depending on the area you live in and where you get it from. the average price range is somewhere from 500-800 dollars|`|IwEBEifCaa	It depends on the breeder.

4sQHvKDeaa	Pit Bulls don't make good guard dogs because generally they are very friendly, and love strangers. My Pit Bull gets excited to see new people come over. BUT, to someone who doesn't know any better, someone who doesn't know that Pit Bulls are usually very friendly dogs, they can look quite intimidating, and that can be enough to keep unwanted people away. And for most dogs, reguardless of breed, if they felt their owner was truly in danger, they would try to protect them.<br>  <br>  And even though a well bred and well raised Pit Bull is friendly toward humans, they can have issues with dog aggression. But with excellent breeding, and early training and socialization a Lot of Pit Bulls love other dogs, and live harmoniously with other dogs. But you do have to socialize them very well from an early age to be sure they will get along with other dogs. And continue socialization throughout their life. If a male and female Pit Bull are raised together they should get along great. But you never want to leave two Pit Bulls alone together unattended because if an argument broke out, one of them could get Very injured. <br>  <br>  If you are interested in getting a Pit Bull, or Two... You need to do a LOT of research on the breed before you bring one home. And you need to be sure you are getting one for the right reasons, as a loving family companion. And you also need to decide if you want to get your dog from a rescue group, or from a breeder. If you get one from a breeder you need to know how to find a Responsible Breeder who breeds for excellent health and excellent temperaments.|`|MuD5oXQQaa	No, they usually perform very poorly as a guard dog.|`|uQfk8p7Laa	pitbulls can be used for property guards, family guard dogs or for personal protection.

They are way to human friendly....to any human, to be a naturally good guard dog. A male female mix is good, but with a pittie, there's a chance of them not getting along as they get older, and unfortunately they'll fight until they really hurt eachother, or worse. Chances are two dogs who grow up together will always be fine, but there's a possibility that won't happen. If you do decided to get two, make sure you get them fixed, lessening the chance of a problem.|`|4MCGZRQgaa	Pit Bulls make very poor guard dogs because they are naturally human and stranger friendly.

If you cannot afford a vet, call your local humane society or dog rescue right away and ask them to take her for needed medical treatment or if there is an assistance program for low-income folks.  There is no shame in doing so, on the contrary, if you really love her, you'll do what is best for HER and set your own feelings aside.

NWWRZHsKaa	If she is being let out at night, especially right after her litter was just borne, she will be out prowling for another male. And she will get pregnant again immediately! She may be already and that's why she is cuddling. You may want to lock her into a cage with her litter. Seems cruel, but we had a cat that had over 5 litters this way. She got pregnant every time we turned around and before we could get her fixed. We had kittens coming out of our ears. Also if this is her first litter, her instinct may not have fully kicked in yet and she may think it is time for her to stop feeding them. <br>  Precious, our cat did this, and we used to tell her " get in that box and feed your babies"!!! Like a dog, she listened, and would get back in with her babies. But every time she thought we were not looking she would try to get out and go prowl. Her "heat" out weighed her instinct to tend to the babies she already had. <br>  If she stops nursing all together, you may have to bottle feed the litter and ween them yourself. Lots of hard work. Defiantly get her fixed A.S.AP. and don't let her out anymore!<br>  Good luck, and God Bless!!!|`|AA10545541	i wouldn't let her out at night.  put them all in a room together and keep the door closed.  get a litter box.  i had a couple of feral cats that had kittens, brought them inside, and they used the litter box right away.<br>  <br>  try putting the kittens right at the nipples so the mom will remember to nurse them.. but make sure they are nursing.. kittens that are dehydrated can go downhill fast.|`|a58uXYrYaa	My cat had kittens about 2 months ago.  For the first week or so she was in the room consistently, nursing the kittens.  After the first week or so she was leaving the room more often- that's normal.  She will gradually not nurse as much, which is normal.  Just because she wants a break doesn't mean she's a bad mom.  That's just how they are.  Just make sure she IS nursing them though.  A couple times out of the day is all they need, especially when they get older.  When our kittens were about 3 to 4 weeks old, she was hardly in the room at all nursing.  Maybe twice a day.  All the other time she was just relaxing in the living room, sleeping, etc.  <br>  <br>  I think it's normal, so don't worry about it.  Just make sure she IS nursing though.  She will try to stop nursing when they are about 4 to 5 weeks old.<br>  <br>  Also, when they get teeth, take some kitten food, soak it in warm water, and let the kittens eat that to get used to eating regular kitten food.  <br>  <br>  Also, it's important that the mom cat is eating kitten food.  The reason is because kitten food has more calories, and the kittens are draining momma cat of all her energy, and she needs as much calories as possible.  Just to let you know.|`|aRAeqlzIaa	If you have taken extensive care of the kittens it could be that she disowned them- giving control of the kittens to you. Same happened to one of my cats. My little sister was around the kittens too much and her scent became permanently attached to the kittens. The sence of smell is above all in every animal except humans. You could rub the mom against the kittens, but the mother never helped her kittens again in my situation. Your family might have to take care of the kittens while they grow up. That was my case, though your's could be temporary. Hope they do ok...|`|TEIHD2AOaa	Don't let her out any more and if she still won't feed her kittens try tkaing a nipple and rubbing it on the babies mouth.

If you look into any 100 fish tanks with healthy fish in them you will find some with dead fish.|`|4SqspAAlaa	yeah i didn't like it either.
