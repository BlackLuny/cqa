OpL8P99naa	I'm assuming you have them in your closet. There are 2 common remedies. One is, of course, moth balls. They smell a little funny, but will chase them out of your clothes. If you want to keep them away from your porch lights though, I don't think they'd work because the evaporating moth ball chemical stays close to the ground (it's heavier than air). The second remedy is cedar blocks or shavings. Something in the cedar "bugs" them. Cedar mulch outside may help keep them away from your home while it is fresh.|`|944iJNAdaa	To eliminate all the moths in the world?  I don't think you could do that, there's quite a few and most of them do no harm.

If you decide to do it, pay a lot of attention to prepping(remove the drain and faucets for best results), note that you won't be able to use the tub for a few days, it's a fierce chemical in the paint so it's not a job for someone sensitive to chemicals, and you need very good ventilation while painting. You also need a very clean room. One dog hair or speck of lint really shows up in the paint and won't come out after it's cured.|`|qmBZueYdaa	yep. My grandmother does it every few years.

ACIp8lZqaa	Worst enemy during the first weeks is too much moisture.<br>  Really keep an eye on the soil. Right before it will dry out - water well. Do not keep it wet. Will set up a soil fungus and you will lose them real quick. Also dont keep foliage wet whenever possible - only water the soil.<br>  Soil temp about 65 for germination. Very tender and sensitive seedlings. Don't place near air / heat vents. Dont let them get too hot on the windowsill.<br>  For the price and the trouble I prefer just to buy some healthy ones later in the season.<br>  I do grow Marigolds , Zinnia from seed as they are not fussy.<br>  Good luck.|`|cbRc11zQaa	I prefer larger containers, such as margarine or yogurt cups. Poke or drill holes in the bottoms of the containers and place them on a tray so they can wick-up water that's poured into the tray (bottom watering) rather than watering the soil surface.<br>  Start seeds 6-8 weeks before the intended planting date (after the projected last frost date if you live in a cold-Winter area.) Cover each container with a small plastic bag to increase humidity and remove each bag as the seeds sprout.<br>  If using artificial light, it's best to locate the light source within inches of the tops of the plants.<br>  A small fan blowing gently on the plants for a few hours daily will help to prevent soil fungus problems and strengthen the plant stems.

dcd11iUwaa	sand it back with a wire brush and cover it with a good anti-rust/rust covering paint,<br>  should come up good.|`|f1006988bdbdd7ae5e5276623f046308aa	They have chain fence tighteners, i think called cable come-alongs if it needs to be tightened up a bit. You can rent them. Plus re paint with rustoleum spray paint.<br>  Maybe before painting take a wire brush to everything to knock off as much old paint and dirt as possible.|`|DxIQJ5m2aa	You will waste lots of paint if you spray paint. They make a special paint for chain link fences. They also make mittens that you can use. Put the mittens on and dip into the paint then just rub along the fence working from the top down. Saves time and money. Good luck.|`|7faa830a5f484403e6668e99c4253665aa	You might be able to use a pressure washer to blast the rust off of the fence. That is the good thing about aluminum fence - it doesn't rust.|`|mFkfJwLOaa	spray paint|`|8lwGjvQpaa	spray paint and chain link fence can be cut twist a peice out and twist a new peice in|`|dXrHoLMCaa	my neighbor did his fence.... or rather, had someone do it... they tightened it up, and painted it black.... it almost disappeared into the landscape!!.... nice job....
8apA3Rffaa	If the grout was a lighter color or have a whitish look to it, there is a product to help you there. Since its a darker color I ll assume it s  a grout dye not thoroughly mixed in. This sometimes happens when you get to the bottom of a bucket and get into a little spot that wasn t mixed and couldn t slake w/ the other grout. Since its a in certain spots I would dig the grout out ( yes you have to) so that your new grout will properly adhere to the new. vacuum the channel out well . Mix new grout well . It ll be easier this time to get it well mixed since  you won t need much at all. I d  try  this before I d stain the grout . Thats stain not a paint if you do have to go that route.  Once this is all done, wait 3 days and seal ( twice ) w/ a pentatrating sealer)Any questions you can e mail me thru my avatar and check my qualifications there  GL|`|grKtTRYtaa	No, no, no  You can paint it.  Go to home store and find grout paint.  It comes in several colors.  It is easy and fast to use but tedious.  You couldn't have more tile than I do.  Use small brush or toothbrush, alcohol for goofs.
fQgG62SRaa	Using a squirt bottle, spray apple cider vinegar into the carpets and upholstery. The vinegar will neutralize the other and it's own smell will disapate in a few hours|`|qm4Mbhwwaa	you could try cleaning it like you would your carpet it will pull out the smell and your car would be nice and clean and make shure you just use water or something that doesnt make you sick also make shure you have an extension cord lol
AA12092525	Yes, but it's not sudsy at all and it is more harsh than regular dish soap, wear some gloves if you do so.=)|`|nOVSf06Raa	I would use laundry detergent instead, the dishwasher needs a high temperature to dissolve and it's not appropriate to use as a regular detergent on top of that it is hard on hands you will have a burning sensation if you use it .|`|9440e28b2ef820fd5eab4d5cfc34217faa	If you do, wear gloves: I tried using dishwasher stuff to hand-wash once, and got a very nasty rash that could easily have become worse if I didn't watch out for it.|`|n560blqraa	Yes, I have done it when out of dishwashing liquid. It does seem to take longer to rinse the soap off though. It can leave a bit of a film on the cups and dishes.|`|zeTGmB3faa	If you are out of everything else, sure, or in a real bind use shampoo. Both need a lot of rinsing but neither will be harmful.
wKQbNvm9aa	No, this is one of those myths.  Plants manufacture their own sugar.  The stem (roots too) of the flower transports water and salts but not sugar.  The sugar could even have a detrimental effect if you use much as it makes it harder for the flower to absorb water.<br>  <br>  The mixture you get from the florist to keep the cut flowers alive does not contain sugar.|`|8786e426eb830d7eccdbed5c73b39ec7aa	Yes I beleive it does, but so does 1/2 an aspirin also cut the stems on an angle so more surface area is exposed and keep the water clean. also if you cut the stem under water and keep the stem end submerged when you put it in the vase, this will prevent an air bubble from going the stem and choking off the bud. use a really sharp knife|`|vkw45Jecaa	I have heard that putting a penney in the water helps buy putting Oxygen back in the water that build up on the penney. I hope this helps.

K5DiumrDaa	Of course, it uses - the suggestion above is useful, but i think you should read and learn more about wainscoting. Find an informational source about wainscoting from the web and you'll guess which wainscoting is more suitable for interior.|`|ILg4GMtLaa	I imagine a very dark wood stain on the wainscoting would be more in keeping with a gothic theme.|`|b1ece44eafe79f3b4fbe8bc579bb88a1aa	http://mariesmanordecorating.com/gothic/...    http://mariesmanor.fateback.com/Medievil...

Plums are so hardy, peaches, nectarines and apricots are routinely grafted onto plum rootstocks instead.   If you don't want a large plum tree, consider getting a species that's been grafted onto dwarfing or 1/2 dwarfing rootstock.
