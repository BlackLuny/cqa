These fans crave a different variety of snacks to go with their ballpark beers: dried squid or live octopus, anyone?      2. In the seventh inning, ushers hand out orange plastic bags for fans to clean up their trash. That's when the ballpark really comes alive: Fans attach the bags to their heads and sing songs for each player.      "It's ridiculous -- the energy," Royster said.      3. Win or lose, Giants fans cheer until their voices are hoarse. After a game -- even on the road -- fans form a phalanx from the locker room to the team bus. Everyone wants a piece of Royster.         My questions are as follows:      In #1, what does the word "anyone" mean in the context?      In #2, what does the sentence "It's ridiculous -- the energy." mean in the context?      In #3, what does the sentence "Everyone wants a piece of Royster." mean in the context?      Thank you.

You see, i created this abstract existance. All you see around me, is not mine, but i created it. It is not mine to tamper with as i see fit. It is for everyone, to be free. Noone is truely free anymore. Not unless they are here. Unbound from the shackles of modern life, advertising, media, government control. I am here to free you.      There is a war going on for your minds. Cover girl cutouts throw up pop-up ads Infecting victims with silicone shrapnel. No more shall your minds be poisened, will your thoughts be mummified, no more shall you cower in weakness to the irational thoughts of the government.      What i am, is what you can be, free. Ever wanted to Watch the sunset in Hawii, Ride a gondala in Venace, Have a 4 course meal in France and dessert in Belgium? How about all in one evening?      My world, can change to be whatever you want. Would u like to be famous, have people adore you and do anything for you? Have people fired and rehired again by the nod of your hat brim. Would you like to live in Multiple, giant, million dollar mansions, each with 3 swimming pools, 8 bedrooms and 4 purple billiards tables.      A simple home life? Wife and 2 kids, a stunning private home situated on Lake View Drive, 1 km from camp. The super structure of the house, twenty five ancient and weathered Red Rivergum trees - powerful and natural. The entrance side of the house is grand, castlelike and is interestingly faced with stones from the hills. The massive pivot door opens into the huge main room and instantly you see incredible views through the front of the house - which is completely open.      Or perhaps relaxing on the beach is more suited to you? Think of the most beautiful beach you've ever dreamt of. The shimmering expanse of endless white that caps the cruciendo of waves and cushions the tide coming in. The oceans eternal rhythm, beating on the shore. On your own island, you have the freedom to enjoy life. However you choose to live it.      Your world, the world you know in fact, consists of two parallel worlds: technology-driven Earth, where you reside, and my world. The transition between the worlds is only possible in dreams. I am able to controll this. I in fact, am in a coma. The reason you are watching me, is that i have choson you. For long enough, i have lived alone in this "perfect" place. I have choson you. Because i can see you. I see you are worthy of this life. I have always been able to visit this world, "My Real Home". In my dreams i could fulfill my hearts greatest desires. It was perfect. Now, that i cannot leave, and am on my own, it seems like a nightmare. Everything i want is at my fingertips, but it's hell without anyone to share it with. Now my one true desire, is to desire again.I do not anymore desire i just have.   I do not thurst for water, i do not feel my own hunger. I only ache, for companionship.      This is why i am calling out to you, I am willing, pleading to you to join me in my empty society. Only now i wish, that i had not jumped, headfirst. Into this dreamland. I wish i could be back, in the real world. I only hope some one is foolish enough to come to me. Can anyone hear me, do you bother to listen? How do i know you are even there anymore. Maybe My World is the reallest thing in all the verses. This means im alone forever.Will someone please answer my pleads, before im killed by my own imagination.

20090305065045AA0RMXD	Education & Reference;Primary & Secondary Education	Question on English Grammar: Which sentence is correct?	My nephew's composition about World War II was edited by his English teacher but I feel that the teacher had made a mistake. Please help to read the following options and tell me the correct answer with a clear explanation. Thank you.       This was what he wrote in (1) and the teacher's version in (2):      1) How I wish there WERE peace and harmony back then! If only there WERE peace and harmony, there would not be scenes of bloodshed!       2) How I wish there WAS peace and harmony back then! If only there WAS peace and harmony, there would not be scenes of bloodshed!       As you can see, his teacher changed the word 'WERE' to 'WAS'. Both my sister and I feel that it is incorrect to look at the 2 uncountable nouns of 'PEACE AND HARMONY' to determine the use of 'WAS' because the focus here is talking about 'peace and harmony' which HAD NEVER TAKEN PLACE during the Japanese Occupation and thus using "WERE" is more appropriate because it is just a wishful thinking on one's part or a hypothesis at most.          Now, tell me, is (1) our judgement or (2) the teacher's judgement correct?

20090305061437AAYWAsn	Education & Reference;Primary & Secondary Education	Should sex education be allowed in schools?	No, I'm not talking about abstinence education. I'm talking about sex education, teaching high school students that while abstinence is their best option, that there are still ways to be safe. I personally know 2 girls who have been pregnant at my high school this year one went full term and kept her child, the other is planning on doing the same, and I've heard about at least 3 others. This alone should tell you that abstinence education is not working, teenagers need to be informed of different ways to prevent themselves from getting pregnant or from getting someone else pregnant. Teenagers are going to have sex, its a fact of life, we will make bad decisions, and we will screw up on more then one occasion, but if there's is anyway an adult can prevent a teen from ruining their lives, is there really a good reason not to.

I've been having major problems with my bullying recently and it's starting to make me feel pretty depressed. Basically there is this little weiner kid at school, he's a real geek and no one likes him, me and my friends have been bullying him for the last few months but recently he's been ignoring us when we call him names and when we do the physical stuff like beating him up, nicking his stuff and egging his mum he acts like he doesn't even care, I really used to like it when he was getting really upset by it and saying he was going to leave school, it made me feel really big, but now I'm just feeling low all the time cos it doesn't feel like I'm really affecting him.   I need some advice, any other new ways that I could bully him (trust me he deserves it, he's really into pokemon and stuff) or any ways to make me feel better about it?   Cheers

20090305091218AALzfLm	Education & Reference;Words & Wordplay	Should I delete the word love from my vocabulary?	I hear the word love loses it's meaning when it is so overused for every feeling of joy toward anyone or anything. That word gets related to sex so often that it just becomes void of power. Maybe I should replace that word with "care" from now on. That way no one will get that word mixed up thinking I'm forgetting all about the compassion at the expense of the romance. There won't be that feeling that I am forgetting the people who care about me at the expense of someone I merely feel sexually attracted to so it won't be taken for granted that I really care for others as opposed to that being just a junk word like fine, okay, cool, that is part of everyday language to express lack of sadness or discomfort.

I am a freshman in college and am currently considering a biochemistry major, but I am not sure that is what I want to do with my life. I have always liked to solve things and have been very good at science in general. I can be very creative and enjoy designing things. I am also very good with computers. I have no idea what I want to do with my life though. I have considered architect, interior designer, biochemical researcher, forensic scientist (LOVED the course i took on it), doctor, veternarian, computer specialist... It's just so hard to choose because idk what any of these jobs entail.      - Does anyone know of any jobs that use all these skills?   - How did you choose what you wanted to do in life?   - If you are someone that has one of these jobs (forensic scientist, biochemist, doctor, computer speicalist, architect, interior designer), what is it like to work in that field?      Im just really confused and wish i knew more about what i wanted to do in life so i dont waste $50,000 a year at this private college I am attending. I am also pretty sure I am going to grad school so there will be requirements ik i will have to take at my undergraduate college.       Any advice would greatly be appreciated...

20090305083753AANLVOP	Education & Reference;Special Education	Autism Educational Methods. Why do we not have choices?	My son (8 years old) has been taught under two different educational approaches. When he was younger we tried Applied Behavioral Analysis (ABA) while we were living in SC. Between the ages of 6 and 8 we tried the TEACCH approach while we were living in NC. Out of the two, we liked TEACCH better. While I believe he did benefit from ABA in ways, I feel that he was more comfortable with TEACCH. We're back in SC now. His NC school sent a thick packet of his progress with advise on continuing his lessons. He's at a new school now and is not involded in any programs for ASD. I understand there's alot of  debate over which approaches are better. Personally, I believe it depends on a child's individual needs (what may work for one child may not work for another).  As far as getting my son involved in these classes? I was not informed of ABA by the school, a fellow parent told me about it. When we moved NC, an IEP team was gathered, options were offered and he was put in a classroom designed for his needs while learning by the TEACCH approach (I didn't have to push for it, like I did for ABA). I plan on asking for an IEP meeting soon. I am hoping to get my son started in TEACCH again, but I know it is going to be extremely difficult. We are not in a position to move again, nor do we really want to at present. I know there are teachers that have been trained in this approach in SC and TEACCH has expanded to some areas of SC. Any advise as to how we should plan this IEP would be greatly appreciated!

However due to the heat wave in Aus the job i took up is not going to pay as much as i first expected. Therefore my trip to Europe wont be as good and as long as i planned and i wont be able to do everything i orginally wanted to do. I dont want to go back to my original degree (plus its too late) but have been offered a bridging course into another degree starting mid year. I keep changing my mind about what i want to do (career wise) and im not 100% sure if i this bridging course is the career path way i want to take.. So im a little confused, do i take the bridging course, travel europe on a budget or just work for a year, which means more time wasted deciding what the hell i want to do in life.      If you were in that position what would u do???      thanks guys.

I belong to the second group – it′s a habit, not an addiction!      As a child I hated my ginger hair because it enticed people to touch them and to squish my cheeks %) Now we maintain healthy relationship.      Even though my father chose my name, Kristina, when he was alive he sometimes called me Rachel as no one else ever did. However, after his death I met several people who use this name. It′s weird.      I CAN′T speak hebrew. I can write, I can read, I know some basic word, but I CAN′T SPEAK. Omg :)      My memory was made to remember all these stupid things such as who said this or that, but what I often forget is where I put my keys and mobile phone.      I share with my twin one childhood experience. I remember me running, falling down and that I was crying so my mother put some powder on my knees. She thinks that it happened to her.      I would like to get rid of my tendency to do something else when I have to study.      I have the same problem as Orshee with blushing :D      I love dance and that′s why I tried to dance in a normal dance group sooo many times, but I always gave it up due to silly choreographies - sorry, I must mention Lacike ?The Gay Guy from Canalisation“!

I am currently a junior at one of the premier public schools in Los Angeles County. I have had a long history of serious medical issues that have kept me out of school for the majority of high school. I am just now starting to recover and I am wondering if my dreams of attending UCLA or USC are realistic. At times, I have missed months of school and each year my school deals with my situation differently, this year I was taken out of my 3 AP classes and am taking a precalc course online and the others through my high school.   My freshman gpa is around a 3.5   Sophomore gpa about 3.3   Junior gpa 4.0   I plan on taking 3 AP's next year and getting all A's   SAT score is a 2200 - 750 math, 700 writing, 750 reading   My time in school I have been very involved in debate and student council and some other clubs and community service organizations   I am just starting to volunteer at the UCLA children's hospital      My gpa my first 2 years is lower than what I would like and is only that low because of my medical problems, will colleges understand and partially excuse that? Or is that too low for UCLA and USC? Does my SAT make up for my relatively low gpa?    Thank you!
20090305100442AAlFsZW	Education & Reference;Other - Education	Born to be a(n) [insert profession]?	After you pay your loans or finish your doctorate in whatever field (personally, pharmacy), do you think it's a good move to keep going to school to learn what you personally want?      I love pharmacy and chemistry but there are a lot of things that I never learned in high school. I was wondering if anyone thought it was a good move in life to keep attending college and pursue your personal interests. Maybe graphic designing and learning other languages?      I wanted to try graphic designing because I just want to be able to do what a graphic designer does. However I don't really think I'd like to follow up and use that as my career. I'm already set on becoming a pharmacist. Financially, I could just save up that money and get ready for retirement right after I get my doctorate but then I'd retire with regrets, I suppose.

20090305094948AAuQUGO	Education & Reference;Home Schooling	Do you ever 'hide' the fact that you homeschool?	When my children were younger, and less likely to speak out for them selves, I would occasionally answer a question about why we were out and about during the day with "We got out early".  Not a lie, and not something I always did but when I did not want to deal with the questions/comments about homeschooling I would not volunteer that information.  Then I started thinking that the children might pick up on this and think that homeschooling was something to be ashamed of, so I ceased.  Now, I am certain to proudly tell everyone we homeschool, even when/if I do not want to answer their questions and hear their opinions.  Of course, at 11 and 8 they now speak for themselves too.      Likewise, I have recently started thinking that I should be more vocal about the fact that we DO homeschool, for the simple reason that othes need to see that it is an option they have, that we are NOT at home all day, etc.

My most recent involved someone telling me how they NEED to go to school to socialize (how original).  In the midst of giving all of my other standard replies, I compared it to Wal Mart.  If I go shopping at Wal Mart, does that mean I am socializing with the other two hundred or so people that are bound to be there because we are all in the same building, doing the same thing?  I   it may have gotten the point through.      What are some of yours?

20090305092649AAHkte3	Education & Reference;Higher Education (University +)	Is my Statement of Purpose good? Its for an art school.?	Could anyone here be so kind to read my draft and tell me if it's good?   It's my statement of purpose for Savannah School of Art and Design. Is there something I need to add or take away?         This will be the second time I apply to SCAD for the fashion design program, and there is no other school I would rather go to than yours. Last year, I was accepted, but was unable to attend due to unexpected financial problems in my family. I was faced with the difficult decision to stay home and help my family, which while I do not regret, did set back the goals I have. However, during the year I did not attend school, I was able to not only develop my fashion design skills, I also grew and developed as a person. Now I have seen how hard life is without a proper education, and I do not want that. My father does not support the idea of me attending an art school, and encourages me to remain in the work force and stay home to help the family. But I know I have so much to offer and I am more than motivated to succeed and become a fashion designer that one day, even my family can be proud of.       Realizing I would not be able to attend SCAD last year was very hard, as I know this is the school that can help me achieve my goals. But I wasn't going to stop pursuing my dreams. I got a full time job in order to bring money to my home, and whatever I had left, I saved in order to start working on a new portfolio. The first thing I bought when I had enough money was a sewing machine and fabric. I began experimenting with construction, and making patterns. I bought more fabrics, and worked on designs in my free time. I’m drawn to dramatic, artistic and innovative pieces, but have also started to think about the commercial and retail aspect of fashion. However, I need the proper education in order to learn construction and bring my visions to life. My ultimate goal is to create clothes that make women feel confident, powerful and beautiful; but at the same time, be fashion forward and bring innovation to the industry.       My artistic abilities will not be the only thing I can bring to your school. By my senior year, I was involved in seven different clubs. This included being a leader and taking many people’s views into consideration. I was the president of the Art Club, bringing art into the school with projects that helped students develop their art skills regardless of artistic abilities. Being on the tennis team helped me keep physically fit, while being in EDGE club, a Christian group, allowed me to strengthen my religious beliefs. Other groups I was part of were Photography Club, Yearbook and Teenage Republicans. The one club I am most proud of being a part of is the Student Council Association. In this club, I was able to make a change in the way the student body was represented. I worked hard so that diversity was not a problem in our school, but an asset.       If given the opportunity to attend SCAD, I will not take things for granted, and devote myself to being a valuable member to your school both in artistic achievements and community involvement. I have the motivation, drive and spirit to go far, but I need the opportunity to make my abilities reach full potential.

It is dangerous   to spurn the clothes you were born to wear   for the sake of fashion; dangerous   to use weapons and sharp instruments   you are not familiar with; dangerous   to disdain the plaster saints   before which your mother kneels   praying with embarrassing fervor   that you survive in the place you have chosen to live:   a bare, cold room with no pictures on the walls,   a forgetting place where she fears you will die   of loneliness and exposure.

20090305095149AAzr7ox	Education & Reference;Words & Wordplay	My sister's essay? Could you edit it to make it "sparkle" [is the word she used!?	The use of tobacco from the teens in the US is way too towering. The NHIS 2003 National Center for Health Statistics says that in the US 43.3% of the people are smokers, 19.2% women and 24.1% men. Why are the numbers up so high? I say because the pressure on the young teens is incredibly high. When our teens are pressured to use drugs they usually do not consider about how it will influence their life in the future, they are concerned about what others would think of them. If I were pressured to use tobacco, I would think about how is it going to affect my body, how is this going to affect my life, how will it affect others around me, how will I feel? If everyone would think about these questions, we would have this crisis off our shoulders.   If we were to stop selling tobacco products, we would have less cancer, sickness, and health issues. Although we would be taking away money from the tobacco companies and from the doctors that treat the tobacco users but, we would put the danger down of losing lives. If we make all tobacco products against the law, then we have another drug we have to keep others away from like crack/cocaine, marijuana, inhalants, ecstasy, methamphetamine/meth, LSD, and heroin. We would have more drug dealers and lawbreakers if this were to happen. Although we would have less lives at risk.   The American Lung Association said; that almost 6,000 teens under the age of 18 start smoking, 2,000 of these become regular smokers. If we were to take away tobacco products we would have those high numbers gone. Would that be nice?    How do we get our teens out of the atmosphere of tobacco use? One, they should have a good environment at home, a place where there is time with family and parents that are in touch with their children’s lives. Two, they should have a safe environment at school too. If the teachers know what the children are going through with friends, there would be less difficulty there. Third, when our teens are just out with their friends, they should feel okay saying “no” to their friends when tempted to use tobacco products.   The health of our new generation is at risk too. With Second-Hand-Smoke, children are not even smoking and the smokers are killing them. We have to stop this. How? We can start helping more people who smoke by setting up more treatment centers to help those who want to live a smoke-free life. We need to stop this addiction to nicotine. All these people are dying because they made wrong choice when they were young. We can talk to teenagers more about how treacherous this is.    What if everyone had a goal in life, to never use or be around anyone who is using tobacco products? Our world would have one more thing off its list of troubles. I have a goal in life. It is to NEVER use or touch tobacco products. I will not even be around with people who use tobacco, that way I will never have to worry about Second-Hand Smoke, or being tempted to use tobacco. We need a change.         thanks!!! :D

Now I checked this year that although i qualify for osap again, I also qualify for student loan from Alberta as well (ALIS).      So Im wondering, is it okay to apply to both places and recieve money from both sides or do my actions violate some sort of rules and regulations. I know i will accumulate a lot of loan but aside from that, i want to know the legality of the issue and the best possible way to go about it.      Also, BTW im talking about applying for 2009/2010 school year so I have not done anything yet.      Thanks

20090227064813AAg74py	Education & Reference;Other - Education	Does it bother anyone else that it seems most people on this site can't spell?	Seriously, I am not trying to be critical or judgmental.  It just seems like a large percentage of the questions and answers on this site (and quite a few others) are written in horribly poor English.  Just a ton of misspellings, missing letters, ridiculous punctuation, no punctuation, no capital letters, all capital letters and some of the most amazing run on sentences known to mankind (pun intended).  See, wasn't that typical of some of the sentences you see here?  Like I said, I'm certainly not perfect myself and I am not trying to poke fun, but there is a spell check option on the side as you are typing.  Does that bug anyone else?

20090305101917AATvb3j	Education & Reference;Homework Help	I need help with my maths?	We had to do a maths investigation and i've been ill which has given me more time but when i compared answers i'd done it all wrong so i need to redo mine but i don't really understand it. Could someone explain how to do a few shapes?      We had to find the area of 1,3,4,5,6,7 and 8 sided shapes when we had 1000m of fencing so it would be   Circle 1000m.   Triangle 3sides 333m per side   Square 4sides 250m   Pentagon 200m, Hexagon 167m, Septagon(?) 142m, Octagon 125m    The area had to be in m2(meteres squared)    The workings would be the shape split into triangles according to the number of side with 360degrees divided by the no. of sides. Split one of those so its right angled triangle with the length halved. then tan came into it which confused me and im not sure about Area= 1/2 *b*h does it mean 0.5 or half the number you get from tan? im confused   we did 2 in the lesson and the ones i've done are completly different, we got 481,430m2 for triangle and 62,500m2 for square i did pentagon got 68,810m2 and 1030,176 for hexagon which is what makes me think i went wrong.      Can someone explain it to me? Sorry if its hard to follow...
