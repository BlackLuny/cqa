20090308091548AA4CQJK	Health;Diseases & Conditions;Skin Conditions	I have a couple of acne medication questions?	My dermatologist prescribed me Minocycline, even though I told him that I would rather have safer, natural remedies for my mild to medium severity acne. Anyways, the Minocycline seems to have many bad side effects, so I don't want to take it for very long.    Would it be ok to take it for only two to three weeks and then quit, since my acne is mild to medium in severity? I would ask the dermatologist, but he never seems to listen to my concerns.    Also, I was wondering if when I get off the antibiotic my acne will be the same, better, or worse than after I started it.    I'd probably rather try proactive since it isn't so dangerous to use. Is it very effective?   I'm 17, if that makes any difference in your answer.       Thanks for the help : )

20090308091918AA1zgc4	Health;Women's Health	How can I get my doctor to take me seriously about endometriosis?	I am young, 17 to be percise.    I've exhibited a detailed history of dehabilitating periods since the time I was 11.    I've been experiencing immobilizing pain & just about every other classic symptom of the disease since I was very, very young.   I've tried just about every brand of birth control pills which I can't handle because they make me sick throughout the month,   but I'm constantly in a state of severe pain and I want treatment.   My gynecologist's answer to everything seems to be hormonal contraceptives so I'm going to my family physician to try and get a referral to a specialist in a larger city.       My question is,   what can I do to make my family doctor take me seriously about my illness?   What should I say to be more convincing?   I'm not very good with doctors, any help or advice would be greatly appreciated.   Thank you.      My ultimate goal is to have a laparoscopy performed.

Also intermittently if feels like the tube that runs from the ear to throat is cramping.      Does any of this make sense? I just as soon wait for this to go away than take it to the doctor.

20090308101001AATddFV	Health;Mental Health	Why I only remember bad and painful experiences?	I spend a lot of time by myself. I'm very shy and don't have friends. unfortunately my family members always blamed me as a child and adult for my shyness and blushing in public. At work, most of the time I do data entry and I think. At home, I am home alone and I think. I've met nice people that like me and say nice things to me. but, I only think about bad people and what bad things they told me. it is uncounciously. as soon as I realize, I stop it, after 10 mins I catch myself again.   why am I that way? is there anything I can do?   I'm on prozac already.   thanks.

20090308105833AAe5UA4	Health;Women's Health	Only girls should answer, unless you're a guy doctor..PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE read & answer if you have any ideas?	i am 14, soon to be 15. i had a uti in the beginning of january, it went away for about 2 weeks, after taking med. the doctor gave me. then symptoms started coming back. such as, urge to pee although little comes out, and that eventually changed into an urge to pee with pee actually coming out. i'd say i have to pee about every 15 min. but i try holding it, the best i can. i've had many cultures done on my urine. most came back normal, no glucose or anything like that, so it can't be diabetes. the doctor put me on a yeast infection med. (which made my symptoms worse, including burning) for about 2 days, until that test came back negative. he told me to stop taking it, and to continue taking a diff. med. i was on along with it, that is supposed to cure infections. it didn't seem to be helping. so i had another culture done on my urine, it came back with a sign of more bacteria. i was diagnosed with vaginosis about 3 weeks ago. i then finished my med. to treat infections. symptoms are still present. so my doctor had me go to the hospital for blood work (pregnancy test), negative. + that would be able to tell if i have an std, so i don't have that. ultrasounds on my bladder and kidneys, came back normal. a dye test on my bladder, with the insertion of a catheter. it was about a half hour procedure. that came back normal. ever since last week, i've been getting brown discharge, and i think i spotted some blood in it. also, i've lost my appetite. i can eat, but not much. i use to be able to eat a ton, never had problems. but now, i gag everytime i get done eating, even when i haven't eaten alot. i've lost 10 pounds according to the doctor, in the past month. i'm always tired, lazy, don't feel like getting up, because i'm so uncomfortable. and i get urine leakage sometimes. i get dizzy at times also, and i recently got a headache today, and it has yet to go away. so now, this coming wed. i have an appt. with a gynecologist, hoping to find out what is wrong with me. if anyone has any idea what this could be, please please please, answerrrr! i am so sick of having these problems. its driving me crazy. i don't even want to see my boyfriend, because i'm so uncomfortable, i would be cranky, and boring. it would be worthless.

20090308102633AATsoTw	Health;Women's Health	Anyone on Loestrin 24 or any kind of birth control?	Ok so I just got the brand new pack, never taken birth control before, and was planning on starting today Sunday. I am still on my period..so should I wait til next sunday? I think this is my last day though. Anyway, I am really confused about this whole thing, I have heard a lot of stuff of people who have taken birth control pills. If I take the pill for a couple of years (I just had my son Dec.30 and wanna wait for the 2nd) would it be harder to get pregnant again? And also, do you gain a lot of weight? The reason why I got on the pill instead was because my doctor said since I had heavy periods every month I couldn't get an IUD. I am not on medicaid anymore but if an IUD is better I would pay for it. What do you think?

My 12 year old son has had diarrreah, vomiting, nausea for about 6 weeks now.  We have taken him to several doctors and specialists and still no diagnosis.  They have run every test they could think of and still no answers.  He is now starting to feel better, but has lost over 35 pounds.  I am not too worried about that because he was a bit overweight.  Prior to this, he has had problems with SEVERE constipation for about the last 6-7 years.  I am really worried that the doctors are missing something.  The diarreah is subsiding and he will finally be able to get back to school.  He has been out since this started in mid January.  The only "diagnosis" they have given is that it is some type of "virus", but they aren't even sure about that.  Any help would be great!   PS - we have not traveled anywhere and his sister and everyone else in family is fine.

20090306230507AAsce6U	Health;Women's Health	Is emergency contraception seriously worth it in my case...?	Ok, I have been on the pill for almost three months now, and no, I'm not retarded, I'm very responsible; I have never missed a pill before!  I always remember to take it everyday in the same time frame like directed.  I'm not on antibiotics, and the only other medication I'm on is Lexapro and was told that it doesn't interfere with the pill's effectiveness.  There has been one time where my boyfriend didn't use a condom for like 10 seconds, and he didn't ejaculate, urinated beforehand, so no precum, at the time, I was a week into my active pills, second dispenser--this took place on Jan 31st.  About two weeks later, I have gotten a period during the week of my sugar pills, like I should, which lasted about 2 to 3 days, however, it was so f**king light, I freaked thinking it was implantation bleeding.  So for the past month, I've have taken four home pregnancy tests, two of them were after my period or "implantation bleeding"--all of them turned out negative.        Mind you that any other times we had sex, he used a condom correctly at all times.  Tonight we had sex and he still used a condom correctly only this time he actually came.  He didn't do it inside me; he pulled out of me on time and he knows his own body.  We even check the condom for any semen leakage, and none, still sealed tight.  This past week, I have been throwing up; and I thought it was morning sickness, so I took the fourth test and it was negative, so it's probably from stress or a stomach bug I caught.  Then, I was reading this in my insert packet:   "IF YOU HAVE VOMITING OR DIARRHEA,  for any reason, or IF YOU TAKE SOME MEDICINES, including some antibiotics, your pills may not work as well.  Use a back-up method (such as condoms, foam, or sponge) until you check with your doctor or clinic."   This was after the sex, so I'm like oh sh*t!  So, although he pulled out on time and the condom being on for the entire session, would it be necessary to go to planned parenthood tomorrow morning for emergency contraception?  Or am I being too paranoid?

20090306215429AA9Eh62	Health;Diet & Fitness	Help me lose some weight?	Okay, I use to exercise ALOT. And eat alot as well! I was 5 foot 2 inches and weighed around 102 pounds. But lately I've stopped fencing [the sport I did for about 10 hours a week, and it was intense] And began athletics at my school, which we basically just kept our bodies fit. It wasn't easy, we had to do miles, lunches, push ups and sit ups.For an hour a day, five times a week. It was less then my fencing, so i burned less carolires and gained some weight to 110 pounds, but I was still fit and i felt healthy. Now i've stopped athletics and all i do is walk for about 15 minutes a day. I'm still a student so I don't have much time to spare but is there anyway I could lose 5-10? It'd be freat if you gave my exercise routines or what to eat and what not to eat. Thanks! (:

And as much as I wish to find a person who understands me, I  always end up hearing people say they know how I'm feeling and they give me lame comments.

Yes it's true that we can have an amount of control in our life, but basically we have no control over our thoughts/our moods/our emotions. It as if someone or something else is 'playing' with our mind.       I would give anything not to be a slave to this illness. It limits my world!

20090306231622AAWzerX	Health;Men's Health	Very small red spot on penis?	Ok, for about 2 months now I have had these 2 VERY small red spots on the shaft of my penis. One is small than the other and they are right next to each other. I would say the larger one is only half a cm. They are located about 1/2 and inch below the head of my penis. They itch occasionally, there is no burning, or pain in the area. It is basically a tiny flat circle that occasionally itch's. I have had sex with multiple partners and I myself was tested about 2 years ago. Since then every person I have had sex with has been tested after sleeping with me and everything came back negative for them. Before I go get tested again I was just wondering if anyone knows what this could be. Its not going away but once it a while kind of fades and then comes back. It has not spread or grown whatsoever. Any advice would be greatly appreciated. Thank you.

I procrastinate alot and wait till the last day to do a huge project. i act on impulse very often. There is so much more. This has destroyed my life. I am labeled as "stupid", but i call myself lazy. i hate being called stupid or a dummy by my parents. I asked them if they can take me to be checked out but they say I'm just looking for an excuse.

I even created a plot, like when will this event happen, what am I going to do on that event..perfectly plotted.

I started taking it when I got a job and gained some belly weight. I'm getting rid of it. But i'm not sure if the weight is from working and the stress or if it's from the pills. Also, my boobs are bigger and I know it's because of the birth control. So has yaz ever done anything like these examples while taking it? Has it: made your hips bigger, breasts bigger, gained weight, what was your period like? how well did it help your acne and did it stay that way? I would also like the age to go along with it. Because growth and weight fluctuation can come at certain ages. Thanx:P

20090227104942AAhLJFz	Health;Diseases & Conditions;Other - Diseases	Burning sensation in stomach?	Ok so last night I all of a sudden felt very ill. (I was laying in bed, got hungry, went upstairs to make something then started feeling sick)      My mom thought it might have been something I ate.    I fell asleep for about an hour and woke up to an excruciating pain running through my stomach. Im going to try to explain it the best I can.      So it creeps up, I can feel the pain intensifying. the pain starts from my lower stomach, and moves up toward my chest (never did reach my chest though) but it feels like the pain is moving and while it moves it gets stronger. Then wen the pain goes away (its not constant) it goes away the same way it came, it feels like its slowly lowering while getting less intense. It kinda felt like a "roller coaster" like slowly creeping up then extreme then back down... When the pain hit its most intensity, it was unbelievable!!! Its a pain i've never felt before, Kinda like a burning sensation, but at the same time kinda like a sharp shooting pain... and I only got the pain maybe three times then it went away. Does anyone know what this could be? or experienced something similar? Like I said i've never experienced anything like this before in my life, I know what heart burn feels like, I know what gas feels like, I know what the stomach flu feels like etc.

20090227102206AANXBqH	Health;Diseases & Conditions;Other - Diseases	Thoughts? Stomach pain, weak, diarrhea, tired, fever, no appetite...second time around!?	Hey yahoo friends,    I was wondering if anyone had any idea as to what it might be. This is the second time I've had this in less than a month.  I started feeling sick very suddenly. Woke up very nauseas. Hot and cold stages. I threw up and had horrible diarrhea. I then started shaking uncontrollably when I went to school to take a test (had to take it). I needed a water bottle by my side at all times. My stomach was horribly loud with churns and gurgles. I mean LOUD! Diarrhea would not stop. Couldn't eat anything but knew I was hungry. Only had broth for a day or two then tried solid foods, which threw me way back and I was even worse. Doc gave me meds for diarrhea. It lasted about four days. A few weeks later (now) I woke up feeling the same way. No appetite, diarrhea, nausea, very very weak, very tired. The only thing that was different was that I got a fever (101 degrees). I couldn't eat anything, not even broth. For some reason, I was able to keep yogurt down a little later. I felt better in the morning. But then it came right back. Now I can hardly stand, can't lift anything, my stomach really hurts (dull all over pain). I have headaches too.       Is it the same thing? Any ideas? Is it just the flu coming back? Also...I've been under a ton of stress...just got married, work and school full time etc. Could that contribute? I don't want to pay a bunch for another doctor visit if its the same thing.

20090227101249AAnVQP1	Health;Dental	My tooth is stiff and sore, not my jaw, my tooth?	ok, so over this past weekend I had a toothache so bad that my lips would go numb. I went to the dentist who took an x-ray and saw nothing on the x-ray and then pushed on all my teeth and wow, it was pretty easy to pick out the one that hurt. He told me that it could be from a large filling on the side of the tooth and that teeth can expand and contract and if a tooth with that large of a filling is not capped it could cause fractures. He also said that it might be a sinus infection that has settled on that ONE tooth, but usually its a few teeth when that happens. I've been taking antibiotics and my tooth isn't causing my lips to go numb anymore but it HURTS to chew, its sore and stiff - like almost a feeling that I've got stuff stuck on either side of the tooth but there isn't anything there. I really don't want a root canal or extraction since i have no insurance but everyone I've ever spoken to that has had a tooth hurt from a sinus infection has told me that they've never felt this before. The filling is so old I don't even remember getting it and the gums around the tooth are a little bit swollen. I don't remember having sinus problems recently but then again, I'm one of those people who have chronic sinus issues so I might just not have even noticed anything was wrong.

OK, so this happened to me 3 times so far. and what happened, was this HORRIBLE worse than ache feeling was in my calf and i have NO idea what it is! like the three times it happened, i was sleeping, then i woke up all of a sudden, like right away, i wasn't tired when i felt that feeling. and this miserable  feeling was in both my calves. then it happened a second time and it was in my right one. then this time, it was in my left calf and then went back to sleep. when i woke up my butt, both my calves and part of my back w hurt when i walked, if that had anything to do with it. please help! and if there is any way to get rid of it. even if you at least know what it was. it definitely wasn't an ache, though cuz it felt like someone was squeezing the insides of my calf and twisting it.

But last night I went to bed around 2 because I was hanging out with friends watching a movie. Then I woke up around 4am with the WORST pain I have ever felt in my life. It was in my upper stomach, sorta close to where CPR chest compressions would be, and on the top sides. My forehead was burning up so I put a cool washcloth on it. I felt like I was gonna throw up but I never did. I ran to the bathroom a few time but when I got there I didn't feel sick anymore. I tried gas pills, hot tea, crackers, and a heating pad and nothing made the pain less. I started my period yesterday too.  But then I was reading up and they say that miscarriages start with bleeding. I didn't fall asleep til around 10 this morning and my phone rang a lot and I finally got up, but I'm so tired. My boyfriend's mom thinks I miscarried.  I'm scared.  Please tell me what you think.

20090227112434AA1e5qT	Health;Mental Health	What can I do about this 'depression'?	This is going to be long and I'd appreciate it if you read it and suggest anything, however I do appologise for the length.       Okay so I think I'm depressed and I know why because I have a few problems that are affecting me so much! I'm at a loss as to what to do!      Last year a family member died that I was close to and this has affected me so much, I have gone off the rails because of this and I have no idea how to get back on track. When he first died I became a selfish and angry being until we spreaded his ashes, the anger went away and most of the selfishness has gone. I can't explain how much this has hurt me; it's impossible to.   This problem has caused me to be very distant from other people although I do still try hard with people until recently I have kind of given up and I will explain why:   I am losing my friends, they do not seem to be bothering with me anymore, they have left me out and gone shopping without me on several occassions, I don't go out at the weekend anymore, I just don't feel important. When sitting with them at lunch and break, they do not make much eye contact with me and none of them will really speak to me apart from one who speaks to me the most and will make some effort. I don't know whether to stop hanging around with them or stay; the reason why I don't leave is because I am still attached to that one particular 'friend' who makes an effort with me even if it is just small.    I just feel like, if I were to get up and leave even if it was just to go to the loo then none of them would notice I was gone or notice I'd come back.       You probably think this is confusing, believe me it is!       Do you have any suggestions as to what to do? Oh yeah, I bottle things up, my family think I'm happy as Larry and I'm geussing my 'friends' think I'm better than I actually am, either that or they just don't care =S.      Thank you, advice is appreciated!!

I could even feel it...it was at least 1-2 inches and hard, lumpy and not painful.  My mom said she noticed it for a few weeks.   What possibly could this mass be?  We are scheduling a follow up appt with the surgeon as advised.        Additional details:  She has a history of breast cancer (triple negative) in 2006 with no metastasis and clean lymph nodes.  She also had a transverse colon resection surgery 2 months ago after a routine colonoscopy showed a mass.  The surgeon only had to remove 3 inches of the transverse colon (which is above the naval) during a laproscopic procedure.  The final pathology from the resection came back benign.  My mum is not sure if she noticed the new palpable mass before or after this surgery.      So my question is, what could the palpable mass be?  Cancer, scar tissue, other ????

I'm somewhat smaller than I would like to be as an 18-year old, and I've been working out on and off for about 9 months now. I work out in order to gain weight/muscle mass. I fluctuate with my consistency because college life in itself is inconsistent, but I aim for at least 2-3X a week, and when i do complete a significant workout, it is at least for 1 1/2 hours, often more. That's how long it takes for me to see/feel an effect the next day. I can deal with and actually feel very pleased with the day-after soreness of my workouts. The soreness is never significantly painful. But should I be aiming for that next-day soreness or is it really a bad thing? I've never had a trainer or anything, so I'm really looking for solid advice.

But this year, it's different. I loose more weight in the summer and fall and then when high school soccer ended, I started gaining on weight, but I play soccer outside of school on a team also. But this year, I gained like 20 pounds more than I weighed to start with. I'm now at 5'5 and 143 pounds. 5 months ago, I weighed in at 124 pounds, same height!  I play sports a lot of my time and go on the treadmill a few time a week. I just can't seem to keep the weight off. I've never weighed so much in my life. Now, I'm loosing a pound like on Monday, then gaining it back by Wednesday and maybe more. What do I do! I tend to eat a lot of junk, and little healthy.

I just got done talking with my orthodontist and oral surgeon and it is decided that I need upper jaw surgery and possible lower jaw surgery to correct my mild underbite.

I would appreciate any advice about this! I would also love to see before & after pictures of people that have gone through upper jaw surgery for an underbite.      Thank you!
