jV99kgWbaa	Puppies, like human babies, are rarely spot on time :)<br>  <br>  Birth often occurs at night. Make sure you have all the essentials to hand, just in case - nail scissors, a clean dry towel and an extra basket, so if the litter is a large one, there will be plenty of room for the newborn puppies.<br>  <br>  How do you know that the puppies are on their way? <br>  <br>  In the final week of pregnancy, begin taking your dog's temperature, rectally, twice a day. The first noticeable sign of labour is a drop in mum's temperature from 38.5o C to 37o C (though normal body temperature can vary slightly from dog to dog). This usually occurs 12 to 24 hours before birth. <br>  <br>  In the final stages, pregnant bitches will go off their food, may possibly vomit, and will probably scrabble at their bedding to prepare the nest for the imminent arrival of the puppies. Contractions are another obvious sign, during which she will tense and then relax as they pass. You can also expect mum to become very restless and unsettled and even begin to pant and shiver. <br>  <br>  The final sign is a discharge. This will often start out clear, change to a pale green and then to a dark green. This dark green means the placenta has become detached and the puppies are imminent. If your dog has not had any puppies within an hour of this discharge, contact your vet for assistance. <br>  <br>  The birth<br>  <br>  Puppies are usually born within 20 minutes of each other, but it's normal for dogs to 'take a rest' partway through delivery and they may not strain at all for up to two hours between pups. And if you see your dog straining hard, appearing unsettled and restless for over an hour, or taking longer than a four-hour break, consult your vet. <br>  <br>  Delivery<br>  <br>  Expect some puppies (probably half of them) to be born tail first. This is not abnormal for dogs. Mum will deal with them, licking each puppy to ensure the sac is cleaned from the face so they can breathe easily, and biting through the umbilical cord. <br>  <br>  If your dog is giving birth for the first time, she may need a little extra help and reassurance, so be ready to offer some soothing words. Occasionally, the mother will be in the middle of delivering the next puppy when the last needs help. If this occurs, remove the membrane the puppy is in, take a piece of heavy thread and tie a knot approximately one inch from where the cord attaches to the body. Then tie another knot a little further from the first and use clean scissors to cut the cord between the knots. Quickly dry the puppy against the grain of the hair, using a clean cloth (facecloths work well because they're big enough to cover the puppy but won't get in your way). Finally, vigorous rubbing with a warm cloth will dry and warm the pup and also stimulate it to take its first breath. Crying clears all the fluid from the puppy's airway. If you have a suction bulb, you can gently use it in each nostril. <br>  <br>  If labour lasts a long time, the mother may need to go to the toilet before or in between deliveries. Make sure you watch carefully in case she starts giving birth to the next pup at the same time.<br>  <br>  After the entire labour is over, get the mother something to eat and drink, and help her go outside (although that might be difficult). Remove and replace the soiled nest covers, then give the new family some time alone. <br>  <br>  However, if mum doesn't seem to be very interested in taking care of her puppies, particularly if this disinterest extends for more than an hour, you may need to take over - and consult your vet immediately. In occasional cases hand-rearing may be necessary, as a result of parental neglect or a mother's inability to produce milk.|`|PM23RDycaa	Go ask your breed mentor. Because a RESPONSIBLE and REPUTABLE breeder such as yourself is probably tired from having to find good homes for your dog's pups and working your well paying job to cover all this so it has just slipped your mind. After all you have spent YEARS learning before breeding your dog.<br>  <br>  I mean you aren't just some irresponsible pet owner/byb who let their dog get pregnant without know anything right?<br>  <br>  She's SIX days from her supposed due date. You should be on puppy watch at this point.  You SHOULD have already put in for off time so you can be with her 24/7 or someone else WHO knows what to do. You SHOULD be monitoring her temp. for dips below 100 that are steady. You SHOULD have a proper whelping box for her that she is ok with and watching for signs of nesting behavior, digging, pawing, etc.|`|AA10112346	Your vet that you have on speed dial that you have contacted about your situation the day you decided to breed.<br>  **************************************...<br>  It is called  sarcasm :D. <br>  And it doesnt matter, the dog was bred.sorry|`|9kTejB0uaa	Right, leaving aside how this happened ...... Gestation in the ****** is around 62/63 days.  Count back from the mating(s) and you will be able to estimate the due date.  It's the 24th Feb and if you think she's not due until March 1, it's a bit soon for her to be starting to whelp.  Has her temperature dropped, and stayed low?  If she's due to start within 48 hours, it will go down to around 98F and stay there.   Note her temperature will go DOWN, not up lol.  Sometimes their temperatures drop, but go back up again.  And this means whelping isn't imminent.<br>  <br>  She may not be eating (much?) because she's big and there's simply no room for food.  Offer smaller meals, more often.  Is she in pain?  Pregnant bitches often look uncomfortable towards the end of their pregnancy - it's hard work carrying a load of puppies, and at this point I always think why on earth did I do this to you!!  It might make you (or your dad!) think twice before you do this again actually!!<br>  <br>  Basically if you are AT ALL concerned, contact your vet!|`|fYcYPyR3aa	Her waters should break, and she'll start panting A LOT which is a sign the puppies are coming. It could be soon, our dog gave birth about 1 week before the vet said they were due, the vet also said there were 3-4 puppies and 10 came out!|`|c290b7856214fd8baaebf9e77a554dffaa	Ask her.|`|16XpYCBmaa	Dogs sometimes have there puppies a few days early. I would say she is going to have her puppies in the next 2 days since she already lost her apatite. She is also prolly starting to have contractions and that is why she looks depressed. Just be there for her and coach her threw it. The way you know they are close to delivering the puppies is because they keep walking around and won't sit still and keep laying around. I had 2 dogs that had puppies and they both did a good job. Everything should go well. Good Luck.|`|BkC0XjF5aa	when a dog goes in to labor it will be searching for a safe place to give birth, my dog kept walking back and forth and in circles, sheis anoutside dog we didnt even no she was pregnant fore sure, she dug a big hole under a tree that she gave birth in, she thought it was safer<br>  then any where else i guess|`|k59o2PZaaa	My dog got like that too a few days before she had her puppies. But right before she had them she went to the place we had set up for her. It was also obvious that she was in pain. Dogs are pretty independant when it comes to having puppies.|`|rXMTdUg4aa	It could be any day now. March 1st is an estimate. Look for restlessness and panting. Depressed and not eating does not sound right. You should take her to the vet and not breed your dog.|`|m6dfTLH4aa	i think your dog is close to giving birth. but see if she/he is throwing up.that is a sign of birth. just like my dog that died a long time ago.we kept one of her puppies.
vv2uk9hHaa	Cats, like humans, drink milk from their mother until they are weaned. Also like some humans, after that time they stop producing the enzymes necessary to digest lactose (the sugar in milk). Basically, they get lactose intolerant as they age. You'll probably hear lots of myths about milk giving cats worms.. that's a load of  bull*****.  Drinking milk is not dangerous for cats per say, but it could give older cats a bad tummy ache and diarrhea. A little bit once in a while is harmless though. I give my cats some butter, cream and cheese every once in a while. But only as an occasional treat.|`|V7pXzNKNaa	I don't think there's anything wrong with cats drinking milk. I give my cat a small petri dish of milk when she gets moody and she slurps it all away instantly. I mean, kittens are well-known to drink milk, based off of cartoons and such.|`|6KxBqnstaa	Belive it or not cats are lactose intolerant and should not drink milk. It causes GI upset in many of them causing diarrhea. They can take their mothers milk but not cows milk. :)  They have a cat milk product called sips for them|`|Ey5ew3G6aa	they can have milk, but not cow millk. i think that there is something bad in it..<br>  they can have goat milk though very good for llittle kittens|`|HUIo1fQaaa	The majority of cats are lactose intolerant and can not digest cow milk.  I have a cat the loves milk.  Occasionally, I will let him drink the left over milk in the cereal bowl.  My vet said it was okay as long as it is once in a while and it doesn't cause him diarrhea.  Obviously cat milk and cow milk are different.|`|AA10103759	No, they can't drink the same types of milk that we do as humans.  The milk that comes from mother cats is totally different than the milk that comes from cows.  They make some milk for cats for when they get older and need their nutrients.  Just like you wouldn't go and drink human milk, would you?|`|jUaSbfhJaa	Erm only lactose free. There is cat milk you can buy from your local store.<br>  If you are talking about a kitten drinking milk from it's milk then yes.|`|2f1374e471cdcbe573f1860b783fcecaaa	Milk will give them diarrhea. Really runny diarrhea.|`|yLiOgVEYaa	no. not a cow's milk. but yes they can drink milk from their mother cat.|`|q6PZfUM1aa	My cat always drank milk instead of water and he never got sick from it.|`|gyO7oZeOaa	yes but if they have 2 much of it they will get sick|`|H5iKQXtMaa	to much can give them diarea|`|61041143dddecfcc9398996d4da5b712aa	cats are lactose intolerant. if you give them cows milk it causes upset tummy in all forms.|`|0mb78CiWaa	Dairy is not healthy for cats.The milk from their mother was different than that of a cow.<br>  <br>   If you do want to feed a cat milk pet stores sell cat milk.|`|qydcoAbFaa	cow's milk can cause stomach discomfort, gas, diarrhea, and vomiting if given in large amounts.  Even if your cat doesn't have these symptoms, it makes the poop smellier than normal.

OrvTG44laa	I think it'd be best to get your mom used to dogs first.  Maybe go to a shelter and play with the dog you want to get.  Let her see that the dog is nice and sweet- assuming that's true.  Once she gets comfortable with the dog, it will be a lot easier to convince.  She also might star liking the dog, and she'll want to get it.<br>  Keep showing your responsible.  You have to let her know that you will take care of the dog.  <br>  Another thing to do would be showing her how dogs are good for kids.  Kids who grow up with dogs learn responsibility.  Dogs are famous for making people happy.|`|4puOUmLTaa	I think you should just respect her decision. I only say this because of the horrible circumstances.|`|PM23RDycaa	Oh yeah you are REALLY showing maturity and love for you mother by how you phrased this question. Your mother doesn't HAVE to GET OVER IT if she doesn't want to. She doesn't want a dog you aren't getting a dog and your father is standing by her decision. <br>  <br>  Grow up<br>  Get a good job<br>  Get your OWN place<br>  Get a dog<br>  <br>  No means No|`|aCqSF87Raa	Get over yourself and respect the fact that mom is terrified of dogs. Her feelings and fear is a TAD more important than the fact that you LOVE and WANT a doggy - it's entirely selfish and rude to expect her to just "get over" her lifelong fear of dogs.<br>  <br>  It's up to HER if she wants to work on her fears or not, and that should be done with the help of a qualified psychologist. Panic attacks and panic disorders are NOT to be taken lightly. <br>  <br>  Dad obviously understands that and respects that - try showing a little compassion for mom. Suggest psychological help if you want. But don't expect much - fear is not easy to overcome, especially if it stems from an actual event. <br>  <br>  Dogs should also be indoors where the entire family is - not in a "guest house" where you may or may not take proper care of it when you feel like going out. They need constant attention for potty training, manners, obedience, socialization, etc and that is near impossible to do when you do not live with the dog.<br>  <br>  You're fourteen, you have your whole life ahead of you. So get a job - you can't expect to pay for a dog without one - and wait until you get your own place after college.<br>  <br>  PS - Colleges don't allow dogs in the dorms, and most don't allow freshmen in apartments. Dog friendly apartments are also very hard to find AND very expensive. What then?<br>  <br>  PPS - Oh, they're handing out psychology degrees to 14-year-olds now.... didn't know that!<br>  <br>  PPPS - Reporting anyone for their supposedly "rude" answers won't change the facts. No one is going to just tell you what you want to hear, sorry!
iXijnCxOaa	It's not p.c. to breed dogs at all... The AnimalRightistas would like any breeding to halt and to eliminate contact between humans and animals.<br>  <br>  It's not p.c. to breed "purebred dogs"... it is more acceptable, however, to bred well-bred dogs.  Dogs that come from multiple generations of health tested ancestors, who have breeders that offer guarantees and who demand any dog they've produced be returned to them if it should need rehoming.  Dogs that come from generations of animals who meet the standard and thus will produce pups who will have known qualities.<br>  <br>  Too often the dogs that producemixed breed dogs are not health tested and are likely to produce health issues... and they do not breed true.|`|PM23RDycaa	Its not about being p.c. It's about whats right. There is NO reason to breed mutts other than to make money. Mutts have no standard no predictability to their offspring.<br>  <br>  Mutt breeders don't put any money, real time and effort into it. Reputable breeders of purebreds put their love, money, time, blood sweat and tears into breeding. They do it to improve/better the breed.|`|FdcWPp48aa	There is a whole lot more to consider then  pure breed or mix....<br>  <br>  When consideration to breed dogs, a person (breeder) should consider what can be gained by the mating.  Even when breeding pure breeds, health of generations must be insured, keeping the lines healthy and with good temperaments.  If someone wants to breed dogs, they should at the very least have two "GREAT" specimens.  They should be health tested for every disease that can be tested for as to insure the offspring the best success.  When people breed mixed or designer breeds, I have never seen them take two champion show dogs, that have all the health testing available for each breed to insure the offspring the best success.  They usually take a *****, mate with a dog to make a designer mutt that is appealing to people looking for a small dog that they can often purchase for much less than what a responsible Code of Ethics Breeder can sell their Champion titled and health/temperament tested pure breeds for.  So the market is there, and unscrupulous people and sometimes just nieve people will breed their pets to make a buck, without consideration for the life of the pups they bring into the world and the legacy that those pups may go on the breed more mixes.  The shelters are full of these dogs that people soon tire of because of health or temperament problems, or they just don't have time because the dog isn't a cute puppy any more and dump it.  So it really is a bigger problem than saying it is politically correct to breed purebred dogs vs designer mix breed dogs.|`|rXMTdUg4aa	P.C. or not... breeding is wrong.

I'm sure not, you'd chuck him out.<br>  <br>  Lock the dog outside. That will solve your problem|`|749K6Hysaa	I believe it's because he is not neutered. Male dogs have a natural instinct to mark they're territory. He is in your home now, new smells new place to mark his sent. They also continue to mark the same areas, you need to get a special urine cleaner that breaks down the enzymes. You should neuter them both. For health reasons and also to avoid behavior like this. I think your doing a great job as a pet owner and I encourage you to find information on male dogs and how to avoid behavior like this. Since you now have a new male puppy who has not reached adolescence.<br>  Here is a link to the ASPCA and the programs they offer, especially on low cost spay and neuter.<br>  <a href="http://www2.aspca.org/site/PageServer?pagename=aspcaprosn_sndatabase" rel="nofollow">http://www2.aspca.org/site/PageServer?pa...</a><br>  <br>  Good Luck :0)|`|8YGzqHgZaa	theres this new thing out and its like a pee pee pad or something like that and wen ur dog has to pee it goes on the thingy . its not a diaper or anything . you just lay it on the floor . it worked with my dog but all dogs r different . i think u should try it out . go on this web site <a href="http://www.pee-pads.com/" rel="nofollow">http://www.pee-pads.com/</a>
x0WZE0i4aa	Looks like you are doing the right thing getting them trapped and neutered, hope you are OK to have them back in your yard once they are done?  I should think you'll be able to borrow traps. Not much you can do about the noise in the meanwhile I think!<br>  <br>  One thing: don't clean the grill with bleach.  Bleach contains chemicals that are also found in cats urine, so putting it on something is likely to encourage cats to spray more.  What I've always been recommended is to wash first with a solution of biological washing powder, rinse and dry.  Then wipe down with surgical spirit.  This is supposed to dissolve all the smelly stuff so the cat can't smell it any more!<br>  <br>  Edit: guess you have it in hand by now, but  I wouldn't spray the grill with anything.  Basically any added smell may make the cat feel another cat sprayed over it and it needs a top up.  The idea is to totally remove the smell to their noses not just ours.|`|UNFxjNHkaa	oh no!  dont hose it down w/ bleach!  Cats LOVE bleach....! (seriously)|`|fRYQfvNaaa	You really should try to get someone to spay and neuter the cats, if you can't get it done from that foundation, i'm sure you can find a low cost clinic or even just post an ad on craigslist and see if anyone won't help.  I once had a vet answer my question and spay a stray female I found for free, he just took it in and said he found her if anyone asked.  Can't you try to put the girls in the garage/shed/basement/spare room for a night if you cant find a vet right now?|`|vv2uk9hHaa	We had a pregnant stray cat around here, brought her to the SPA and they basically told us they immediately euthanize the pregnant females. They don't want them giving birth and having to place even more kittens. I felt kinda bad about that, because I didn't know it beforehand and I thought they'd at least let the kittens live.. Anyways. Better that than living outside and suffering. You should get the cats to the SPA and whatever they do (either spay/neuter and release) or just euthanize, it'll be better than a few more generations of stray cats getting hit by cars, starving, etc.... it's kinder this way.|`|SergeFDbaa	call rspca and ask them to take them away if there a stray.cover the grill up with soemthing...|`|4TX26viFaa	Have you ever heard of TNR?  The shelter here does it for free--a neuter and spay project for strays and ferals.  They can't produce offspring, they don't spray  or go into heat anymore, and they live out their lives.  <br>  <br>  Call around if your shelter doesn't do TNR, contact any feline rescue in your area to ask where you can have this done.  It involves spay/neuter, microchipping, vaccinating, de-fleaing, de-worming and ear tipping.  I had 12 cats done in our area.|`|AA12398420	I do TNR for my community and it works great. It eliminates spraying, fighting, and unwanted kittens. The cats are healthier and happier. There are some places that will spay/neuter feral cats for free. So do a google search for feral cats in your area and you will find lots of info.<br>  Or just go to Alley Cat Allies for the info. <br>  When you feed you breed so do the humane thing by doing TNR. You will be very pleased with the results.
px27V5N9aa	1.  She should always be under the vet's care as she needs her vaccines of Pneumobort at 5, 7, and 9 months.<br>  30 days before she's due vaccinate her with all normal vaccines you give.  You will also want to worm her.<br>  If you are moving her across state lines she will need a health cert.  If you are just moving say..down the road a few miles I see no reason why she needs a check....UNLESS she's not had one her whole pregnancy.<br>  <br>  2.  If you are just moving her a short distance she will be fine.<br>  <br>  3.  They will remember her but they will re-establish the pecking order.<br>  <br>  4.  I know I'd want to have her foal in a stall so the foal could be imprinted by me and also ensure that they are safe/healthy/within reach.  I think it's better than leaving the mare to fend for herself out in the field.  <br>  <br>  congrats!!|`|UyKMwdrAaa	Beings she is 14 years old i would have a vet check her first.  It is safe to move them when they are that far along but it depends how many hours in the trailer how far u are going if she will have breaks for water etc.  If u take her away from the herd for 3 months she will have different smells on her and they probably won't recognize her at first so there will be a short adjustment time then they will accept her,  If u have coyotes around thick it is a good idea to keep her closer to u where u can keep an eye on her.  Even tho a mother horse is very protective of their colts coyotes can single them out and do some harm.  Our coyotes up here are not very afraid of a human and come right in close to our place.  They actually have killed 3 of our dogs so yeah they can do some damage.  Good Luck!

What ever don't put it on your chair or couch or bed , cause it will break it's legs do to it's weight ...Check up under pot belly pigs , or ask the people who sell them ..|`|pd5rERcfaa	Pigs are awesome.  But they are very social creatures that require a lot of space, so be prepared to get two pigs and make sure you have enough land for both of them.  Two sows is usually the best way to go.  Also make sure you have some good space for a wallow, as they will need lots of mud, especially in the summer.  I love pigs, they're so fun, and smart-make sure you have a secure fence.  I taught my pigs how to play fetch, they are so fun!|`|Ym6PCJRYaa	<a href="http://www.royaldandie.com/royal.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.royaldandie.com/royal.htm</a><br>  <br>  <br>  I have a pet skunk and I had to get a license for her first... otherwise they would have had to euthanize her.

Other contributing factors are poaching, climate change,  and invasive species. Sorry, but animals are not straying into cities as someone else said..humans are straying into their natural habitat and territory.  They have always been there..we have not!|`|AtiNu3Ovaa	Human stupidity.|`|2qgg2G8kaa	There are actually a few reasons why animals are being endangered of dying out. A lot of animals are straying into cities and towns because people are taking down their homes to build the cities and towns and they get run over or people kill them because they don't want them into their homes. Another reason is global warming. As the temperatures get hotter animals tend to die from over heating. People are also hunting/poaching the animals for sport, food, and skins/furs.
TC4lrRSraa	Wait wait wait....<br>  <br>  You want a fish that is sensitive so you can "tell when something in the water is wrong?"  o_0<br>  <br>  That is a horrible way to go. In fact, that probably won't even help you. <br>  <br>  Different fish can be sensitive to different things. just because 2 fish are both tropical doesn't mean they're going to both like a Ph of 7.2<br>  <br>  You need to get a water conditioning kit to test Ph and chemicals. A fish is not a good indicator for this.<br>  <br>  When introducing a fish, make sure it is compatible with other fish. Chiclids should ONLY be put with other Chiclids because they are aggressive. Bettas should NEVER have more than one male in a tank.<br>  <br>  Go to an aquatics store. They can help you set up and monitor your tank. PETCO offers free water testing and will help you with everything.|`|g5G83cFlaa	A great fish for you would be one with the words 'Aquarium Test Kit' written across the side of it.

If you don't want to go through the process of checking the water chemistry, Temperature etc for a fish tank then maybe a dog or cat would be easier, or the expense of finding a retailer that actually rents aquariums supplies maintenance for a monthly fee.|`|zqVDJxUIaa	Zebra Danios.<br>  <br>  These fish are extremely hardy, and easy to care for.Their small size, no more than two and half inches, and peaceful nature, make them well suited to a community aquarium.

The leopard variety is characterized by a copious sprinkling of black spots over the entire body. All varieties thrive in schools, and they will adapt to a wide range of water conditions.<br>  <br>  They should be provided with plenty of lighting and an open swimming space, together with some vegetation (although not absolutely necessary)<br>  <br>  pH: 6.5 - 7.0<br>  Hardness: 5-12 dGH<br>  Temperature: 64-74 F (18-24 C) <br>  <br>  My first fishies were Zebra Danios.<br>  They love to dart around, and if you have a few, you might even notice them breeding!<br>  <br>  Neon Tetras are not a good choice for beginners.

This should help lower your bed bug infestation, because they nest in bed frames and mattress's, so disinfecting those areas should help lower or kill the bed bugs altogether.<br>  <br>  Hope this helps

And when he pees on the floor spank him. Not hard, but enough to wear he feels it. He will eventually start peeing on the pads or outside,not on the floor.|`|mJQheYGbaa	He's probably missing you guys like crazy.  If he's being crated during those times, its not a "I really gotta go!" kind of pee, but a "Man I really miss them, and I'm really stressed out!" kind of pee.  To make things easier, tire him out before you crate him, and obviously try to make him use the facilities.  Don't make a big production about putting him in there or when you first take him out.  That's why dog's get anxious in our absence...Because that affection they seek is cut off.  If you don't slather him with affection before you put him in the crate, or immediately after you take him out, he won't associate the crate with your affection being cut off.  Also, leave a shirt in there that smells like you and put some music on quietly to get him to relax.  Give him a safe puppy kong or other safe toy to keep him busy if he's restless.  It's imperative that you don't raise the guy to get separation anxiety.<br>  <br>  As the owner of a 2 year old shepherd that I adopted from the shelter, I can tell you separation anxiety is a monster with bigger, older dogs.  Unless you want a grown up dog to display even more intense AND annoying symptoms of the same problem, nip this problem in the butt and learn how to precisely crate train your little pup.  Consider yourself lucky that you are only cleaning up little puppie puddles of pee and not big dog messes!  You have nothing but time on your side.  Just look up proper crate training tactics and start implementing them ASAP.  His anxious-ness will subside, AND he'll mature at a very quick rate, and his crate will be all the cleaner.  Also, you'll be preventing a full blown case of separation anxiety later on as your dog gets older.|`|1WmDOPGtaa	How old is your pup?  Regardless of age, if you truly want to get your pup house trained, crate training is probably your best bet (especially seeing as he already ignores the pee pads).  This means when you cannot be there with him, he is safely in his crate.  The crate should be large enough for him to stand, turn around, and lay down... but no bigger.  If the crate is too large, your dog can easily use one area to eliminate while resting comfortably in another.  There are many steps you can take to make the crate a happy place for your pup.  A quick web search will give you a wealth of info.|`|EAj7fHWnaa	don't worry. some puppies just don't no they need to hold it while in their crate. you are doing everything right. the ice cubes is a great idea. what i would suggest is maybe setting your alarm a few times during the night to take him outside to go potty. this is what I did with my puppy when i first started potty training. eventually he will understand and there will be no more messes in the crate. maybe when your gone for long periods of time you could have a neighbor or friend let him outside to go potty. your puppy will eventually be able to hold it until let out. like someone else said make sure the crate is not too large for him or else crate training won't work. Good Luck!
342b3711423c978836fa192cef3238d8aa	You'd be wise to take her to classes for a couple of reasons.  First, you'd have a qualified instructor to teach you how to train your puppy, but even more important than that, this puppy needs socializing.  In an obedience class she'd get that socializing she needs in a controlled environment while getting some training at the same time.<br>  <br>  As for her biting, that's something all puppies do but most have been taught bite inhibition before they're her age.  You've got to get everyone in your family to do it starting today because she's a large breed puppy and she should have been taught before now.<br>  <br>  Every time she bites, yelp "ouch!!" and turn away from her.  What she wants is your attention and you need to withdraw it.  Then give her back your hand and if she bites, repeat.  If she's a very persistent puppy, leave the room for a minute.  When you come back, interact with her again, remember lots of quiet praise when she shows self control and doesn't bite.|`|CkecSp4Uaa	Since it sounds like she is doing this mainly in an attempt to solicit attention the fastest way to stop it is to teach her that putting her mouth on you gets her the opposite of what she wants.  Totally ignore her.  Get up and walk out of the room.  Shut the door or put up a baby gate so that she can't follow you.  If you have to you can say "ah-ah" the instant she puts her teeth on you and physically remove her to a separate room or her crate.  And totally and completely ignore her for at least five minutes.<br>  <br>  It is ALWAYS best to take her to classes.  Even if you've trained a hundred dogs and know dozens of ways to teach all of the basic commands NOTHING beats the kinds of distractions and socialization that she will get from group classes.|`|hBiSNoE7aa	Your puppy "lacks complete discipline" because that is how dogs are born. They have to be taught the discipline by people. Are you sure she "wants her belly rubbed"? Rolling over is a behavior signal used by dogs when they are kind-of overwhelmed by a situation. So your puppy might even be signaling that she is overwhelmed, then you go and touch her belly which is considered by animals to be a vulnerable part of their body and she responds by snapping. I do not know if this is why she is snapping at you or not. But I would recommend to not touch her belly if she seems excited or aroused. If you want, try touching her belly when she is laying down in a relaxed position (not when she is fully asleep though!). If she still snaps, she just might not like her belly being touched and you should probably take her to the vet to rule out any medical problems.<br>  <br>  As far as training classes vs. doing it yourself:<br>  I would highly recommend classes, since it seems like you are a first time dog owner, plus it provides the puppy with crucial socialization and you can meet other dog owners and get great advice from the trainer. But just be careful. Dog trainers are not required to be certified. Do not let anyone tell you to do something to your dog that does not seem right or humane. There may even be free classes, ask around at your vet's or at the local animal shelters. If you do want to try to do it yourself, do some reading and watch some videos. And use lots of treats and be real positive and laid back. Good luck!|`|nBehRANyaa	It's best to go through at least one class with her so that you learn how to train her properly and she gets used to working around other dogs and people.<br>  <br>  For the biting & snapping, completely ignore her whenever she does it.  Get up and leave the room for a few minutes.  You want her to learn that biting or snapping equals *no* attention.  Praise her when she interacts with you nicely.  Make sure she's getting plenty of exercise, too.|`|1XLZdOcQaa	Mouthing and biting are natural, normal behaviors; all puppies do it. During teething (generally starting around four months), the urge to mouth is extra powerful because it feels good on your pups' tender gums.

Whenever she bites you keep your hand in her mouth and pull from her leash hard( don't worry you won't hurt her) at the same time say no. Keep doing this and also put your hand in her mouth and do the same thing again even though she stops biting it will keep her trained then you will see that she will learn not to bite.I hope it will work|`|SIFXeYuoaa	we had a puppy who did the very same thing. first thing- dont enforce it. when she tries to bite, a small but sharp rap on the nose with a few fingers wont hurt-sometimes that doesnt work, though.  there is this sour apple spray that dogs HATE, (tastes icky to them), but it does make your hand smell.   when all else fails try a spray bottle (on the spray setting NOT stream), and spray a mix of water and vinigar at her mouth when she tries to bite (it wont hurt her). but dont use 100% vinegar. we did that with our puppy, and he stopped biting.|`|C5YBD3F1aa	It is because she is starting to teeth because of all of those new, white jewels popping up in her mouth. ;) It is normal for puppies, just make sure to buy a TON of bones and heavy-duty toys, like kongs. <br>  <br>  And take obedience classes, you would never regret it. It won't stop the teething, but it would help with everything else. (:

K0uTjeWiaa	Treatment of Chronic Renal Failure<br>  <br>  If your cat is not in final stages, this is not want you want to do. You do not want to put your cat on the<br>  Vets low protein diet. There are simply so many better options out there than to hand the poor cat a low amount of poor quality protein - which often results in a poor appetite and muscle wasting since the body is now robbing its own muscle mass to feed itself a decent quality and amount of protein.<br>  . There are new thoughts on this and the thinking is it is not the amount of protein but the quality of protein that matters.<br>  The Merck veterinary manual [www.merckvetmanual.com] says that cats need "4 g of protein of high biologic value per kg body wt/day". That's about 7 calories from protein per pound body weight per day. If a cat isn't a good eater and consumes, say, 20 calories per pound per day, then 7/20 = 35% of calories can safely be from protein. It must be high quality protein, which means meat, fish, milk, and eggs, and not grain or soy. <br>  <br>  I am under the assumption that you have been feeding mostly dry foods. Many use a vegetable based protein instead of animal and that is part of the problem.. Your cat needs protein as it is a carnivore and cutting down on it will lead to other health issues and may cause faster degeneration.<br>  You want to cut down on phosphorous (no fish allowed now) <br>  <br>  The best way to do this is with a raw diet which you can make yourself or buy. (Making yourself is better) link provided at the bottom<br>  If you are unwilling to do that then something like the non fish flavors of Wellness or Merrick with NO grains are good alternatives. Wysong is also a good canned choice. This list gives a breakdown.

There is no cure for kidney disease, but you can manage symptoms if caught early.  The cats will need subcutaneous fluid therapy (frequency will be determined by vet).  That is something you can do yourself at home if you want.  Also there is special prescription food such as Hills k/d that is designed specifically for kidney disease.  The cat will need periodic blood/urine tests to check the progression of the disease.  I have seen some cats respond very well with treatment and live for years, others die very quickly. It is more common in older cats, but can happen at any age.|`|AA11736483	Yes. My siamese was diagnosed at 12 y/o with crf. We treated it for 5 years and she eventually died of other causes. <br>  <br>  Treating the crf was difficult at first because I didn't know what was involved. As time went on, it became routine and we managed it very well. <br>  <br>  I believe that the key factor in treating crf is to prevent any further kidney damage. This includes removing all toxins from the cats environment and feeding additive free foods. By doing this you can dramatically slow or halt progression of the disease.<br>  <br>  The first thing the vets suggest is feeding low protein food, however, most cats don't like the bland taste of this stuff and refuse to eat it. The last thing you want a sick cat to do is not eat properly. After reading the controversary about the benefits of the low protein diet, we decided instead to feed a high quality food, with minimal additives. This seemed to work well in our case.<br>  <br>  Maintaining hydration was an on and off problem. In CRF cats, this is common. It is important to keep a close eye on this, because if the cat gets dehydrated more kidney damage can occur and it also makes the cat feel lousy, which can affect its appetite. We learned how to give sub-q fluids at home when needed.<br>  <br>  We tried to limit medications to only what was absolutely needed. We kept lactulose on hand to control constipation and began to use Azodyl daily. Azodyl is not a medication - it is a supplement specifically for crf cats and seems to work well with 'low numbers' cats. We also supplemented B vitamins. Most crf cats have a B vitamin deficiency because their kidneys are not working properly and they don't concentrate their urine. Along with the excess peeing, the body passes these out too quickly. <br>  <br>  There are a lot of aspects to explore with crf and all cats are different, so the treatment methods may vary.  I suggest that you start by reading either one (or both) of the below sites dedicated to feline crf. These sites are pretty much the bible on treating crf. <br>  <br>  I will caution you about joining the yahoo crf groups, which some will point you to. A few of these groups can be very opinionated and/or resistant to change. They are controlled by staunch moderators who routinely dispense medical advice when they are not qualified to do so. In fact, some of their recommendations can be fatal.|`|8584e0329fb17c662606d5a6a8650ee2aa	I lost a cat to kidney failure a few years ago.  It is a common illness in very elderly cats and a pretty common cause of death in older cats.  It is irreversible but often can be controlled for some time, depending on the cat.  Basically my cat became thin over time and urine had a very strong odor.  My cat lived with it with treatment for a couple years.  Often subcutaneous fluids, special diet and other supportive care can keep your cat going for quite awhile.  Talk to your vet about your cat's prognosis - some cats do better than others and it depends on the cat and its overall health. My cat was about 16-17 years old when she got it and lived to 19 years old.|`|d3496b1eb0b2a2ec70adb2a7b6100d89aa	My cat started to develop renal insufficiency during the last two years of her life. Fortunately it never progressed to renal failure before she died, but it was something that had caused us considerable worry. Thankfully it was something that we were able to control with a special diet, increasing her fluid intake by providing her with a water fountain that circulated the water through a charcoal filter, and very regular vet visits to keep an eye on her creatinine levels.<br>  <br>  Unfortunately it's not a very uncommon problem for older cats and if left untreated, it can be fatal. My vet did give me a lot of information on what we might need to do for her if her kidneys failed. Some cats require subcutaneous fluids, which your vet will teach you how to administer an can be done at home. It's not pleasant for either you or your cat, but it can be a huge help in maintaining your cat's health. And kidney transplants are a possibility, but it's a difficult proposition for both you and the cat. A donor cat would provide the kidney and your cat would need to remain on anti-rejection medication for the rest of its life. You also would gain a new pet, as you would be required to give the donor cat a permanent home.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.petplace.com/cats/acute-renal-kidney-failure-in-cats/page1.aspx" rel="nofollow">http://www.petplace.com/cats/acute-renal...</a>|`|KEhEwGJuaa	I was told about 10 years ago that my cat Cricket had kidney failure. Because he nearly lost his mind every time I took him to the Vets for  his shots and tests I had to stop taking him.<br>  . When I say he nearly lost his mind because of fear,I mean just that.<br>  Now after 10 years he is still alive and and appears just fine. I cannot explain this and I know it is no help.|`|TdrgZwnoaa	Simple. The cat died and the vet took care of the body. It was the least he could do after I dropped $350.00 on a cat that he knew couldn't be saved right from the first visit.
x8Vgu6acaa	Your parents already told you how you can get one.  Just get good grades.  Taking care of a dog is much harder than getting good grades.  Talk to your parents and find out exactly what grades you will need in what classes for them to get a dog.  Then study like mad.|`|hBiSNoE7aa	Ask your friends and teachers for help in school. Maybe your parents want to see if you really want the dog, if they are you should try really hard. School is really important because it sets you up for success in life. What is it that you have trouble with in school? I had trouble too and I went to college and now I have a job and I learn all kinds of things. I think you can do anything you want to.|`|C5YBD3F1aa	Well, Beagles and Bassets are quite different, as Beagles are usually very easy to train and Bassets are not, and Bassets require a little more care. Research Bassets as much as possible, type a couple pages to your parents of why you deserve another dog, and give them all of the pros and cons to the breed. I can help you with this if you would like, I have been raised around Bassets and own four of my own right now, I am quite educated on the breed.<br>  <br>  Dedicate yourself to school work right now and keep your grades up for a while, then consider getting a dog. Dogs take a lot of time and concentration, and if you are already doing bad on your grades you could fall behind more... So just raise your grades and keep them steady, then talk your parents into getting one. Or, another option is to wait until summer break from school and ask to get a Basset Hound puppy then, so then you can get training done and over with by time you start school again you can concentrate on your school work, not going home and constantly having to keep an eye on your puppy. (I would suggest that you get a 3-5 month old puppy, they are easier and quicker to train because at about 5 months old Basset puppies suddenly click and pick things up.)<br>  <br>  Good luck! Basset Hounds are wonderful dogs, I would suggest them for any person that is willing to put a lot of time and patience into training them. Excellent, goofy, fun dogs! (:|`|Lnn8K57Kaa	look before i got my dog i had to proof my parents i was responsible so i did a bunch of research on my dog i picked out a name and i made a list of responsibilities that i had to watch out for and next thing you know i have a dog

QaXEkf1xaa	First off they are adjusted to their new home.....They will soon become comfortable and eat.... <br>  <br>  I have fire belly newts as well and they absolutely love bloodworms... I thaw them out and then place one of the end of a tooth pick... I do this while they are in the water... I gently move the worm in front of their heads so they smell this and then I let it fall to the water making sure that they see it... After that I just drop the rest into the water.  They are usually gone in about 10 mins but if they don't finish them then I clean the leftovers out|`|NzSA6dmyaa	hey the person above is right, just thought id add a caresheet as pet shops often try to sell you still like heaters and stuff that u dont need and can harm the animals, <a href="http://caudata.org/cc/species/Cynops/C_orientalis.shtml" rel="nofollow">http://caudata.org/cc/species/Cynops/C_o...</a>
RN1wGlWWaa	Something is genetically wrong if your kittens are only 2 lbs and 7 months old!  Normal kittens are about a pound per month of age; so a 7 month old would weigh about 7 lbs (give or take a pound).<br>  <br>  I would have your kittens checked out by a vet.  If they are female you may not be able to spay them and they certainly would have complications if they got pregnant including possible death.|`|0mb78CiWaa	They should weigh about 5-8 pounds. Take them to the vet. They may have a health issue or parasites.|`|HUIo1fQaaa	usually kittens weigh a pound a month until a year old so the average 7 month old cat weighs 7 pounds.  You should have taken them to the vet a long time ago (I'm assuming you haven't or you probably would have mentioned that).  I do own 2 cats that have dwarfism and even they weigh 5 pounds as adults.|`|PZM1TDf9aa	After a certain age, kittens grow like weeds. It is totally normal, and esp. on how big the mama and daddy were, she could grow more rapidly. And kittens need a lot of food in order to get the nourishment's they need.|`|pd5rERcfaa	It really depends on the breed.  Do you know what kind of kittens you have?  Also feel free to ask your vet about this, it could be a matter of worms or some thing like that.
3n60UxgQaa	Ich is a parasite.  If even one of your fish have it, it'll be best to treat the whole tank because chances are, it's floating around in your tank or on your fish.<br>  <br>  Ich is caused by poor water quality.  Having a heater certainly does help.<br>  I'd recommend you get a heater and raise the temperature to 83-84F and put some ich medicine in.<br>  <br>  At that temperature, the ich will become free swimming (detaches from your fish) and right into the medicated water.<br>  <br>  Aquarium salt wouldn't hurt either, if you haven't added any.  It helps with the prevention of ich.  It helps but won't solve the problem if it's there though. =]|`|g5G83cFlaa	Temperature fluctuations are BIG stressers for fish and they probably are they cause of the ich.  Get a thermometer and a heater, and yes treat the whole tank.<br>  <br>  If you have any plants in the tank, or intend to keep any in the future, do not add any salt.
qMO9S6kvaa	Dude!! DON'T do that to your Jack. I also have a 7 or 8 year old jack dempsey and that is just how they are. Please do not take your jack out of the water again, and or snap his jaw around. :(   poor fish.   Unless his jaw is stuck wide open in a O shape and its not opening and closing slightly. <br>  They just have big mouths and chompers. here is a link to some photos of my jack.<br>  Some times when i get lucky i get to watch my jack yawn, his mouth gets huge!! The two images below show him with his jaw closed a little more than usual. <br>  Make sure you are feeding him meat and vegies every few days. Skinned cooked peas are real good for fish. you can give him cooked or raw meat, however you must remove all food that is not devoured by your fish. It will cloud up your tank a bit if you dont.<br>  <br>  What size tank do you have? if you have him in a 55 or larger, i highly recommend getting a school of fish to eat all of the remains that flows out of jacks gills that he does not digest. I use the GIANT DANIOS. they can also eat whatever jack can but smaller pieces of course. These fish are usually fast enough so that a jack cannot catch them, and dont forget to buy a school of them, at least 6!!!! I buy my jack feeder gold fish for a bi weekly snack, he loves them!!!<br>  <br>  so please dont take your jack out again, as long as he is eating and not floating upside down or showing signs of illness, he is a happy, large mouthed fish with a big personality.

While I commend you for making an effort to keep the dogs separated during this time, the only way to prevent this from continuing to occur every 6 months or so is the get both dogs fixed.

5tOwHbSgaa	They are out at night or evening and dawn, when the red won't show up as much.  They are very good at hiding and also build dens under the ground.  By being very still and making themselves low to the ground, they can disappear surprisingly well. I don't know where you live, but many places, like Oklahoma and Texas, have red soil.  Then the red coat would blend in really well.<br>  Hope that helps.  Live well and do good.

When a dog bites a person it is a criminal act that the owner of the dog is liable for.  If someone were to report a bite the dog would be quarantined if appropriate vaccinations aren't given and/or the owner would be forced to put the dog down.  Not to mention a lovely fine billed to the owner.  It's harsh, but true.  Definitely find a reputable dog trainer in your area!

Simply ignore the dog when he is behaving in a undesirable manner.  He'll learn that when he does that he doesn't get the attention he craves.

fuKhqajCaa	Hola!!! Soy PMVZ.<br>  <br>  Sí, en algunas de las razas que tienen flecos sobre los ojos (Schnauzer, Pastor Inglés, entre otros muchos), no se recomienda cortárselos demasiado porque sí les ayuda a proteger sus ojos del polvo y la luz del sol. Sólo se recomienda que se les recorte un poco cuando ya este demasiado largo, pero no que deje al descubierto por completo sus ojos (es como quitarle sus lentes de sol a alguien que toda su vida los ha usado).<br>  Pero de ahí a que se queden ciegos o algo por el estilo, hay un abismo (sólo casos muy extremos). <br>  <br>  Espero haberte ayudado a aclarar tu duda.  ;)|`|6fb550117e5669e2b43ded94a7c57a37aa	Dai es verdad eso lo dijo el veterinario de la perrita de mi madre ya que ellos nacen así y es su naturaleza y medio de defenza o protección en la vista. Claro si es demasiado largo podrías cortarle un poquitin, pero no tanto, es decir destapandole completamente los ojitos. YA QUE COMO TE DIJE ANTERIORMENTE SI NACEN ASI, ES SU NATURALEZA.<br>  <br>  Saluditos y no dejes al perrito pelado jejej llevalo cada 5 meses al veterinario y a la peluqueria de perritos y te lo dejan precioso.|`|911374944db4b5d6de121f4a0f9bcc47aa	Es verdad,pues precisamente tienen ese pelaje para cubrir sus ojos del sol.|`|74FzHHGCaa	A ver los expertos.|`|SDHvDNGJaa	Si, es recomendable que no les tape sus ojos, para que puedan ver...<br>  Saludos!|`|a6e5cebd7aa59d24f9815f95febee89aaa	es pura mentira !!!!|`|3fc4bf1c3fb6db82f88d6d7d1a00f270aa	Es cierto,  el pelo les cuida sus ojos del sol.  Yo tengo schnauzzer y aunque les hacen su corte de pelo, les dejan fleco para protección de los ojos.|`|5sajtu2Maa	si pero es solo a algunos a otros les perjudica tener el pelo en la cara entonces si tienes uno mejor preguntale al veterinario!|`|aV21mScUaa	Depende de la raza, en los schnauzer como te han dicho el flequillose deja largo pero no es tanto una cuestion de proteccion ya que el color ***** del pelaje y los ojos de por si protegen del sol, es más una cuestion de estetica. <br>  En los shih tzu por ejemplo si bien no se les corta el pelo si se les ata sobre la cabeza para evitar que entre el contacto con los ojos y les ocasione ulceras por roce, por ese mismo motivo no se les corta ya que sino al crecer entran rapidamente en los ojos y pueden da?ar su cornea.|`|fec4fb91fc0326d126ea85f5ecbbe531aa	si es cierto uno de mis primos le corto el flequillo al suyo y en 2 días se enfermo terrible sus ojos estaban rojos,lo llevaron al veterinario y lamentablemente el perrito murió y su veterinario dijo que si querían volver a comprar un perro de flequillo largo no se lo cortaran ya que termináis igual que el anterior<br>  saludos!!!!!|`|lLnpwN6Yaa	Hola, al contrario, debe hacerseles un corte especial o se le recoge con una gomita en casos muy profusos para que además de poder ver correctamente los pelos no se introduzcan en los ojos causando conjuntivitis o se pegoteen con las secreciones propias y causen dermatitis húmedas en debajo de los ojos. En resumen, depende de como y cuanto. Slds.|`|lpXuA3LGaa	Vaya que cosas, yo creía que era por estetica, por ejemplo el perro que menciona Kary (Shnauzer) es un perro que lo he visto y me lo han pedido sin el pelo que lleva arriba de los ojos, la funcion de proteger los ojos es de las pesta?as así como en las personas, por ejemplo el Lhasa Apso en una de las razas que segun la estetica que le quieras dar llevara o no el pelo sobre los ojos, claro esta que es mejor dejarselos para que se vea mejor.|`|zZDt1EDqaa	pues eso depende de la raza, por ejemplo a los yorkshire terrier les da conjuntivitis si tienes constantemente el pelo sobre la cara (ya que entra al ojo)

El mito de que el gato es independiente, sólo obedece a su hábitat natural, pues ellos también han elegido estar contigo y por tanto, establecen una relación con el humano elegido, si tu no le gustaras, tan solo se irían. Como ellos se han quedado para compartir contigo, es normal que te extra?en y por eso no te aconsejo sacarlo de su casa. Si deben respetar sus horarios y ma?itas para que se sientan menos tristes.

TcgExs0iaa	Labs are very easy to train and eager to please their owner.  Your dog is motivated by food, so use that to your advantage instead of hitting him when he is bad reward him when he is good.  Has he had basic training....meaning does he know sit, down and stay?<br>  <br>  If so then start using some treats to reward him --- get him a dog bed or blanket in a spot away from the table.  Start having him go there and lay down and stay while you are eating.  Use the treats as rewards.  Use UH UH instead of no when he breaks a stay etc.  They seem to repsond better to that than NO.<br>  <br>  For the trash can...we have that issue with our 100 lb lean lab.  A few things that work besides moving the trash can to the garage or bathroom.  You can get this popper that you put on the lid...when he touches it it sounds a siren or snaps.  Usually that will work.  Petsmart has them online.<br>  <br>  I would NOT lock him in the kennel when he is naugty.  The kennel is his "den".  Use a half bath or something for time outs.  <br>  <br>  When he was a little pup did you allow him to nip?  If so, it will be hard to break but it can be done.  What I did was when my  labs would nip I would yelp and push my hand back in their mouth..now your dog is getting big, so that may not work as well.  When he nips yelp and then simply walk away or put him in the 1/2 bath for 5 minutes.  Every time.  Be consistent and you will train him.  You can also say No Bite when he nips and then put him in time out.  Eventually when you say no bite he will stop...give him a treat and praise him.  You might also spray some bitter apple spray on your daughter's pants and whatever else he is nipping at.<br>  <br>  He needs lots of stuff to chew on...kongs, cornstarch bones (Booda makes some good ones) etc.  Even give him one when he is on the dog mat while you are eating.  Kongs with a mix of frozen peanut butter and kibble will keep him entertained while you are eating.<br>  <br>  ANd lots of vigerous exercise...atleast an hour a day.  My motto is "A tired lab is a good lab".<br>  <br>  To keep him from begging, mooching never feed him other than from his bowl...even your daughter must understand that.  Labs love food...its their nature.  Most love the trashcan.<br>  <br>  Check into positive reinforcement training, including clicker training.  Your local Petsmart probably has a class and it would really help.|`|2BMUDtH6aa	Puppy training is simple. You need to claim the areas that you don't want your dog. the way you do this is to gently push the dog out of the area that is "yours" and stand your ground. don't allow the pooch to intimidate you. And you need to be consistent just like children they are going to see how much they can get away with. They need boundaries. A well exercised dog is too tired to get into mischief. make sure you walk or run the dog daily. I walk mine before dinner so she isn't a pest during dinner.<br>  As for the biting stop it now by claiming you child just like the dining room. and show your child how to claim their own area.  hope it helped.|`|faf9e51ca2493862319971e2688bd52aaa	don't smack him.. that doesn't do anything but make him either a) afraid of you, or b) angry/resentful towards you, or a combination of both.  dogs that are hit/smacked often end up having behavioral problems later in life. why in the world do you have a dog, anyway? you hit your dog and lock him in his cage.  i feel sorry for your poor doggie.. your lack of knowledge makes him miserable.|`|yIbtcH29aa	I recomend watching the shoow the dog whisper. your dog may be bitting because its bored take it on a walk in the morning first thing using rollerblades will help drain the dogs energy quicker . take your dog on a walk once per day in the morning. then you give food .  you will need to train him dont hit the dog when  he bites you bite the dog bacdk (not with your mouth and not hard .lol) bite him with your hands by  making a clawshaped  hand then just firmly touch him on the side of the neck.  you dont close you hand you just keep it open and just lightly touch him  with him and hold it  and say shh firmly. Ireally recomend wathcing the dog whisper look it up on the internet.|`|qEn157Ppaa	Sounds like he needs more exercise, so maybe someone can walk him while you are cooking dinner or play ball with him, this way when he  comes back he will be ready for a rest  in his crate. After dinner let him out.|`|3jA3kQNaaa	Well in the activity book for every season there's a dog training activity for $150. Stop ur daughter from eating so much or let her eat someplace where he can't get her food.Also put the trash where he can't get it. If u do this stuff maybe he'll get used to doing the right thing.  One more thing...maybe you should take your dog on a walk whenever u can to give him some excersize.
AA11061445	mollies have been known to tail nip ,unless you watch them i dont think you can say 100 percent which fish is doing it.<br>  is it not possible you have a disease in your tank possibly fin rot and that affects the tails to,check out each of your fish and see if they have any tail parts missing,|`|PBBdapCWaa	It's quite possible the danios are the bad guys here.  Look at your remain guppies to see if any have badly damaged fins.  Danios are known fin nippers and may well be killing the  guppies one at the time.<br>  <br>  MM|`|eBozBuraaa	this is pretty simple....actually all the other tankmates could be at fault. its pretty hard to just number them off.<br>  i assume the guppies you have are fancy. fancy guppies have really beautiful tails that not only attract buyers and breeders, but also other tankmates. (i've did a gupppy report so i kno a fair amount about this subject) <br>  their tails would attract their tankmates and so they would end up chasing them around and nipping / biting their tails off. its really common amoung fancy guppies. i think tho that mollies nad platies are mainly the ones biting the tails off  being a regular choice for being with guppies. frys are not affected until they get older b/c their tails are either too small or haven't shown their color. <br>  because of these beautiful tails, other tankmates would chase them leaving you with a *gasp* tailess guppy. <br>  anyways, being tailess isn't the only thing that is probably killing them. some would die w/o a tail but others are probably prone to infection. this infection includes fin rot. i actually had a guppy with half her tail nipped off. i put her in a hospital tank and some medication (its that blue dye thing...) and her tail grew back on. i'm not sure if it'll work with the entire tail ripped off,.<br>  so what's the best way to ensure this wouldn't happen again? its bascailly this: have only guppies. even though its only one type of fish, your aqurium would still look really pretty. (esp w/ those tails :D )  yea, i kno its harsh....esp. since guppies are known to be community fish, but its the problem with fancy tails. <br>  a book i'll recommand (its the only that i copied off of in my report) is Guppies Today: a complete and up-to-date guiede by Spender Glass. there are full colored pages as well as talking about problems such as this in more detail. (i have horrible memory :P)
6efb1915453e10ba302a119e6d5cbf7baa	If this has started suddenly (out of nowhere), then take your puppy to the vet because there could be a medical problem behind this behaviour.  Dogs who are in pain sometimes react "aggressively" when people come near them.<br>  <br>  If this has been ongoing for sometime, and is a behavioural/training issue, then you need to sign up for obedience classes.  It will give your puppy a chance to socialize with people and other dogs, in a controlled environment.  You'll learn how to administer commands and get good responses from your dog, and everyone will be much more comfortable with each other.|`|XEbe4Votaa	Seek a professional dog behaviorist out in your area for some help.  This can turn into a very dangerous situation if you are not taught how to deal with it for both you and the dog.<br>  <br>  Because we cannot see your dogs body language...or yours, it is very hard for us to help you in a forum like this.  You need trained person to help you learn how to help your dog.<br>  <br>  The people above who stated that if this is something your dog just started doing, you should go to the vet are exactly right.  If this just started suddenly, your dog is injured and needs to be checked out.|`|4UHrukFZaa	That is not a normal reaction for such a young dog; that means that something has already gone wrong in his introduction to people.<br>  <br>  Try to correct this by being very attentive from now on, making sure that each introduction to a new person is calm and positive. It is your responsibility to protect your puppy from people who, however well-meaning are too pushy, too noisy, etc. Be especially careful with children, who often treat puppies as toys!<br>  <br>  You also need to ensure that the pup has a place where he can go whenever he needs to, where he is left alone to sleep and rest. This is especially important if there are children in the house!! Puppies need a lot of rest and sleep every day. <br>  <br>  Also, do not take him on too long walks, too far away from the home. All new impressions in moderation, and all new contacts should be calm and with respect for the pup's right to take the initiative or to not want to be social right then.  <br>  <br>  Good luck!!|`|AZCtkVmtaa	le Your puppy needs to be socialized better. take him where he can see people from a distance and after he is calm reward him and move closer . Have people you know bring treats and goodies for him. Have them toss them to him while he is quiet on his leash . He will then learn that people are full of good things for him|`|p6Sjghuwaa	First you need to learn about triggers, thresholds, counter conditioning and desensitization. Do not force this dog to deal with things that scare it, it will only make the behavior worse. You need to work on changing how this dogs feels about people, that will change the behavior. Do NOT punish this behavior. A dog that is afraid is saying that it is afraid. Punishing for that confuses and only scares the dog more.<br>  PLEASE visit this site to learn about how to help your dog. It takes time patience and training. <br>  <br>  www.fearfuldogs.com|`|DxBhP8neaa	Try and get a professional to see the dog or a Vet, he could be in some kind of pain, something happened to cause it, a dog just doesn't turn like that, is he left outside with no socialization, is he mistreated, I will repeat, something happened|`|M82Rieetaa	just be patient. if u just got your dog it may not be use to you yet. let it come to you don't try to go and pet it if it doesn't want u 2. good luck!!:)

No me gusta usar collar de ahorque (de castigo) con mi perra aunque ella pesa 30 kgs. y yo 48, la manejo con la voz. Puedes probar, quizás te de resultado. Suerte|`|rBRqIj32aa	Hola, mira yo tengo un mastín napolitano y el lo usa desde cachorro ayuda para controlar al perro y para darle comandos (ordenes de entrenamiento)... es recomendable y barato. Pero debe saberse colocar, lo cual es muy sencillo, aunque casi nadie lo advierta: <br>  <br>  él collar tiene dos posiciones, una de ahogo permanente y una de ahogo temporal (mientas el perro hala) dependiendo del sentido (izquierda o derecha) hacia donde quede halando la argolla de donde se ajusta la correa o traílla. La argolla debe quedar hacia la derecha. Cuando le colocas el collar con la argolla hacia el lado izquierdo, el collar hace presión en el cuello y se cierra en un punto ahorcando al perro permanentemente. En cambio, con la argolla halando hacia la derecha el collar hace presión en el cuello solamente cuando el perro hala y se destempla cuando el perro deja de halar, con lo cual se hace un estímulo que le indica al perro que “si no hala no se ahoga” y por auto-conservación, dejará de halar.<br>  <br>  Ahora bien, se debe procurar que el collar de ahogo quede ubicado en la parte baja del cuello, en la inserción de éste con el pecho y no en la inserción del cuello con la cabeza, por que en este punto el perro se estrangula.<br>  <br>  Suert??<br>  XoXo|`|PuGfImrSaa	Sirve para que perros que son muy pesados y no obedecen no jalen a su due?o cuando los sacan a pasear, sinceramente a mi no me gusta usar ese collar ya que este collar va la cadena a traves de un aro que cuando el perro se jala esta aprieta y por lo tanto al sentir el perro que se ahoga deja de jalarse, si en verdad te importa lo que sienta tu mascota mejor entrenalo......... y si no me crees que lastima has la prueba pontelo y dile a alguien que sostenga de golpe la cadena mientras tu caminas y ahi me dices que se siente....<br>  saludos|`|TyaYdSAHaa	Aunque muchos entrenadores han decidido dejar de utilizarlo por ser un refuerzo negativo -te jalas, te ahogas-, creo que su uso correcto no debe de lastimar al perro y sí ayudar a controlarlo.<br>  <br>  El collar debe ir exactamente en la base de las orejas, detrás de ellas, y en el inicio del cuello, apenas donde termina la cabeza.<br>  <br>  Debes de pasear al perro manteniendo el collar en esta posición pero sin hacer tensión. En el momento en que tu perro se quera jalar o correr hacia algún lado, jala el collar hacia arriba, o hacia algún lado, nunca hacia atrás y combina el tirón con una orden.<br>  <br>  Después del tirón y de que tu perro reaccione, continúa caminando.

Which is fine for short journeys.|`|AA12106467	If you are using a plastic carrying cage such as what most people use for a cat, then I suggest using an actual rabbit carrying cage.  Rabbit carrying cages are made out of wire and have a metal pan underneath to catch any urine and poop.  You can fill the pan underneath halfway full with wood shavings or ground up corn cobs to absorb the urine.  <br>  <br>  Cat carriers aren't the best for rabbits.  First and foremost they are too big, allowing the rabbit to run around and potentially injure theirself during a trip.  Secondly, the floor is slick due to the plastic and that makes the rabbit even more prone to injury.  Third, they are hard to pull the rabbit out of.  And lastly, since the floor is solid any pee or poop will get on the rabbit and stain their fur if they go pee or poop in the carrier, causing a mess.<br>  <br>  A wire rabbit carrier gives your rabbit a non-slick surface, keeping them from sliding around.  It also is long, but narrow, not allowing them to turn around easily and possibly injure theirself.  And the wire floor with a pan underneath keeps your rabbit clean.  The top-opening cage door also makes it much easier to get your rabbit out. <br>  <br>  Below are three sites where you can get a rabbit carrier:<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.bassequipment.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.bassequipment.com</a><br>  <a href="http://www.klubertanz.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.klubertanz.com</a><br>  <a href="http://www.kwcages.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.kwcages.com</a><br>  <br>  It's best to put your rabbit in a carrier when taking it to the vet.  However, if you are going to hold it, it is best to pet it in between the eyes.  This will tend to calm your rabbit.
GaSK15Kpaa	Ok I have had both for my gorgeous hamster and here is what I thought.<br>  <br>  Wire Cage - I have the Hamster Heaven Metro it is amazing!<br>  Pros: Easy to clean, Fun tubes, Three Levels, Lots of floor space, Light and easy to carry, Big openings so its easy to get to your hammy, Easy to attach water bottle,More space for less money, Wires are good for climbing.<br>  Cons: Hammy may chew on bars (mine doesnt), Can be drafty in winter.<br>  <br>  Aquarium - I had the Arena Playstation 80.<br>  Pros: Keeps warmth in in Winter, No Bar Chewing, Nice view of hamster.<br>  Cons: Can overheat and cause heat stroke, Hard to clean, Hard to get to hammy because its an opening at the top, Heavy, Very Expensive and Smaller than Wire Cage, No climbing facilities, Hard to attach water bottle, One Level. <br>  <br>  Overall I would go for the Wire Cages - they are cheaper so you can get a bigger cage and they normally have levels and some have tubes. My hammy loves his.<br>  Hope this helps<br>  Luci|`|rchaTSI9aa	Pros of cage: 1.the rodent can climb on the bars (it's fun for them) 2.it's easy to add levels, water bottle, etc 3. it's easier to clean 4. it's not as heavy <br>  Pros of aquarium: it's harder for your rodent to escape 2. you can find pretty big aquariums 3. you can almost always see your hamster/ rat. <br>  <br>  Cons of cage: 1. easier to break 2. easier to escape 3. rodent can chew on the bars 4. you can't always see where your hamster/ rat is<br>  Cons of aquarium: 1. less air flow 2. harder to add levels, water bottle, etc. 3. harder to clean 4. heavier <br>  <br>  That's all that I can think of right now. Personally, though, I like wire cages the best (cage with bars). Hope I helped. ;)|`|GuOJIftAaa	Wire cage - If the proper size (Multi leveled) gives the animal plenty of room to climb. Proper air flow. Room to hang hammocks and toys. No build up of ammonia or other harmful odors. The only bad thing is they'll occasionally chew the wires and the cages are quite expensive. Mine can only hold 3 male rats and it was $100.<br>  <br>  Tank - There is NOTHING good about tanks for rodents. They're always 10 degrees hotter than the rest of the room. They hold in harmful odors. They don't allow for proper exercise. Leave aquariums to the fish and reptiles.<br>  <br>  Also, do not use cedar or pine bedding. They have harmful oils that can cause respiratory infections and death. And you must ALWAYS have at least 2 rats. They are very social creatures and no matter how much time you spend with them, they MUST have a rat friend! <br>  <br>  Just do your research before you purchase any animal.|`|5UQiaSq1aa	My advise is the tank. i have one for my hamster. With a cage, some hamsters/rats can escape easily. The good thing about a tank is that they are easy to clean, your pet can't escape, you will have plenty room, ect. The bad things are: You can't attach tubes, and you cant hang water bottles, but you can get one that sticks to the cage.|`|YorMkZYAaa	With a cage that is wired there is optimum ventilation for the rats which is ideal. An aquarium locks in too much bad oxygen and doesn't allow for much breathing. It can become quite smelly real fast with the ammonia from rat urine which is not healthy.<br>  <br>  If you only have one rat I suggest you get another one. Rats are very social, intelligent animals and fare much better in the company of their own kind. It's easy to own two rats and a lot more fun to play with and watch.
bFzu835Aaa	It doesn't help them grow faster. It just gives them the proper percentage of different nutrients they need to grow properly and to achieve their maximum potential.<br>  <br>  You can't really give the parents the hand feeding formula, they usually won't take it from a syringe unless they too were hand fed (and even then once they're weaned it's iffy) and just sprinkling it over the food often results in it just getting sifted to the bottom of their dish. <br>  <br>  You should be giving the parents a high quality pellet diet, with lots of fresh veggies and fruit and always allow access to a cuttle bone and mineral block. An all seed diet is not healthy.<br>   Some of the Kaytee nestlet food (basically the handfeeding formula in a pelleted form) can be supplemented to the parents (along with their regular high quality diet and fresh foods) to help keep up nutrition though.|`|FzFMoeSkaa	no it doesnt help them grow faster it just gives the the nutrients they need to grow stronger and healthier. why would you want them to grow faster anyway its amazing watching them grow i think its to fast as it is.|`|TWeUG8ukaa	I never heard of using it that way.<br>  <br>  If you have the experience or have someone show you, feed it to the babies with a feeding syringe which is sold in pet stores.

You don't want it to get worse.|`|3zv2bbolaa	Canines don't catch the human cold and vice versa. Your dog may be suffering from a bout of tracheobronchitis, better known as "kennel cough". If there are no complications, the run time can be anywhere from a week to four weeks, depending on the health of your dog.<br>  <br>  You should seek a vet to confirm diagnosis and allow him to prescribe any recommended antibiotics or drugs to ease the symptoms and allow the dog to rest more comfortably.<br>  <br>  ______________<br>  <br>  You can't eliminate KC based on not being around dogs.

I would take her to the vet asap.|`|HXt3R4cQaa	sometimes weeks or months even!|`|IZz6mkOFaa	it sounds like kennel cough and if so there is not cure the vet will just give you meds so a secondary infection will not step in.  With kennel cough it will take about a month to totally clear up.  Dogs do not get colds that is right but what kennel cough is , is an upper bronchial infection and no they do not have to have been in a kennel to get it,...<br>  Good Luck|`|94QUVulaaa	GSD's have alot of problems with this before a year of age.  Put your dog on a dog vitaman and keep your dog away from allergy prone things during the first year.  A cold will last no longer than 6 weeks, but with a GSD it is usually alergies because of their nose and over breading. Good luck

B6zl0AJDaa	My best friend keeps her horse in Woodside and currently it's running her $600.00/mo for a stall and a nice big turn out.<br>  <br>  Boarding out can run anywhere from $100.00/mo to $1,000.00/mo depending upon the area and the facility. IF you live in a populated city like San Francisco or Los Angeles, boarding close to home will more than likely run on the higher end. This provides stalls, cleaning, bedding and hay twice a day. <br>  <br>  The lower end, is probably out in the rual areas and can be with hay or without (You'd have to go out twice a day and feed your horse (s).<br>  <br>  I suggest that you call around to the boarding stables in your area and get rates and facilities (Does it have an arena, round pen, hot walker, wash rack, etc.).<br>  <br>  The costs of shavings vary from place to place. In LA right now, a 5 cubic yard bag of shavings runs $4.00 from the shavings company and can run as high as $7.00 in a tack store. You also need sand, decomposed granite and sweet lime to keep your stalls bedded correctly. The sand and dg you'll have to call and get pricing on.<br>  <br>  Then there's the additional costs:<br>  Hay in CA right now is running $18.95/bale for 3 strand alfafa which weighs 100LBs plus. Oat hay, runs a couple of bucks cheaper. Your horse will need between 5 and 7.5 bales a month, depending upon how easy a keeper your new horse is.<br>  <br>  Shoeing (Which can run anywhere from $50.00 for just shoes in the front and barefoot in the back on up.) Done about every 6 to 8 weeks.<br>  Trims: About $35.00 Once again done every 6 to 8 weeks.<br>  <br>  Grain: Depending upon how easy a keeper your horse is, a bag of grain will run you about $15.00 and bran about the same, once a month.<br>  <br>  Vet: Now normally without any accidents, once, twice a year for shots which run $40.00 per shot and the 'call charge' which can range depending upon your area from $40.00 all the way up to $250.00!<br>  <br>  Misc. Tack: This is the one that not only can get expensive, BUT addicting! You see something that your horse just MUST have! DO NOT go to ebay! This can be VERY costly and addicting, trust me on this I have a friend who's still paying off credit cards from ebay horsey things she bought.<br>  <br>  Having someone trailer or haul your horse with the cost of gas would probably be $2.00/mile nowadays...<br>  <br>  Okay, now you have your catagories, work up a spreadsheet for your area and then see if you can afford to own a horse.|`|RUzBDX6Jaa	OH MAN.<br>  yearly costs:<br>  deworming: 20 dollars a piece, around every 6-7 months must be done.<br>  Trims: 20 dollars a horse (all 4 hooves, barefoot) around every 4-6 months<br>  vaccinations: 30 dollars a vaccine (give or take) once yearly.<br>  teeth: for my horses, i have to get them done yearly, for most it is just once every few years.  its about 100 bucks a horse.<br>  vet checks/emergency calls: 100 bucks emergency calls, 50 bucks check over<br>  water (if you have to pay for it) is around 30 bucks a tank..?<br>  tack: around 700 for a saddle, 200 for a full bridle set (headstall, bit, reins) boots are around 40, girth/cinch around 25 dollars, stirrups around 45 bucks...<br>  gah.<br>  do i have to go on??!!<br>  EDIT<br>  you aren't considering buying a horse, are you?<br>  You said that you dont have horse experience!  dont get one.|`|qdtU1Q1Laa	-Monthly board cost anywhere between $200-$2,000 a month depending on where you live, what the barn has, and if your horse is in training. <br>  <br>  -Farrier cost range between $20-300+ depending on if your horse is barefoot, needs two shoes, four shoes, or special shoes and that is once ever 4-8 weeks.<br>  <br>  -Vet bills are also a lot as you need yearly vaccines, coggins, etc. It's usually $100+ for vet visits depending on what you need done.<br>  <br>  -Equine orthodontist is usually $80-$100+ depending if your horse has wolf teeth that need pulling, or if they need to be sedated.

Board in my area runs from $450 to $600 for full stall care. Field board is around $300 a month. The vet costs about $200 a year for regular shots. An infected scrape or puncture wound runs around $100 to $200. Expect to pay this a couple times a year. Major joint problems costs start at $500. At some point you will need supplements, whether for joints, hooves, daily dewormer or coat. These cost around $30 a month for each. Oral dewormers costs about $10 and you usually use them every two months. Farriers around me cost $80 for front shoes and trim in the back. I pay $175 because my horse needs 4 shoes and special shoes up front to keep him sound. You need to have a horses feet trimmed/shod every 4-6 weeks. You also need a horse dentist or to have your vet float the teeth. This is about $60 one to two times a year. I could go on costs really add up.|`|D0zrK0JCaa	ok it depends on where you live first. i live in california and board can be $700 a month. then you need shoeing, vet, tack, and etc. i would not  get a horse if you have not been around them for a while. if you don't know anything about a horse you WILL get hurt. but it sounds like you cont have anything for the horse i would guess for you to get everything you need it will be about $3-5000 . then you will need board which will very greatly from place to place, vet bills for shots and regular things, and shoes. shoeing will greatly change depending on your farrier i would get a good farrier. but if you don't know about horses and haven't been around them for a few years you will put you and your horses life at rick because you don't know what you are doing. Oh i hear this a lot "i know people around the place a board or something will help me" they can only do so much.<br>  please do your self a favor and don't get a horse.|`|Nh3ZDjwhaa	The horse itself can be FREE to 150k or more. Plus the horse payments are MORE than a car payment. <br>  Boarding can be up to 1000$. <br>  Mine is 385$ for my pony. <br>  I take lessons 1-2 a week which is 240$, up to 480$. <br>  The cost of tack in all about 1500$. <br>  Plus shows are SOOO expensive. About 300$ per show. <br>  Show clothes are up to 600$-3000$.<br>  Riding clothes are up to 300$. <br>  Shoeing costs 60$ x 6 = 360$ yearly (My pony doesnt need shoes)<br>  Vet costs about 150$ per visit.<br>  <br>  So in all about<br>  1480$ - one month, most expensive.<br>  Mine is 525$.<br>  AND any extras for me were 2500$ and Im going to do ALOT of shows which cost about 300$-1000$.<br>  Yearly the board cost is 6960$ or more for me(I didnt count the vet bills or shows) .<br>  So I would say about 8500$ are my yearly payments.<br>  But my parents pay for all that :)<br>  <br>  P.S I didnt even add up the treats and gas.<br>  I ride 5-6x a week.<br>  My parents pay 300$ on just treats.<br>  Gas Idk b/c my parents pay for that.<br>  You really need another account in the bank just for your horse costs.<br>  Good Luck! lol<br>  <br>  A pony I used to lease had to have cataract surgery which costs 4000$. So any surgeries are going to be extremely expensive and it might not even work. Soo really every year of costs varies.|`|ejj2N3uaaa	It really depends on your area and your "type" of horsekeeping. There are a lot of factors to consider.<br>  <br>  1)Are you keeping your horse at home or boarding? If you board, you're paying a monthly bill ranging from $150-$700 (give or take) depending on the location and quality of the barn. You may or may not be required to also pay farrier (anywhere from $30-$200 every six weeks), worming (every few months, usually), feed/hay (atrocious!), etc. If you keep your horse at home, you don't pay board, but you'll have to pay for maintenance of your property. That could mean just making sure the fence is okay and the run-in shed is safe...or it could mean paying huge bills for a fancy barn with electricity and hot water and the works. It really just depends on your situation.<br>  <br>  2)The horse itself is a factor. Some horses stay fat off of grass, go barefoot, never get sick, etc. Others require a special (read: expensive) diet, special footcare/shoes, joint injections, regular vet visits, special equipment, you name it. You can get off easy or not, depends on the horse.<br>  <br>  3) Tack/riding equipment costs money and it wears out. Horses can step on a rein and snap it in a second. Other stuff just wears out and has to be replaced every so often. That includes your riding attire (boots, etc.) as well as tack and other equipment--saddles, bridles, pads, brushes, horse blankets, buckets, etc.<br>  <br>  4) Training, lessons, and showing just add costs to that list if you intend to do any of that. <br>  <br>  The cost of the horse itself (to purchase it) is usually the cheapest part of owning a horse.|`|qW0tq6A2aa	OK THIS IS FOR ME PERSONALLY....<br>  <br>  i show my horses and i have them at a very nice show barn... so i have show expenses listed<br>  <br>  <br>  monthly board - 750 (although this is pretty high)<br>  farrier (every month) - 120 for all four shoes (you might be able to find someone lower as well, but this is a good estimate)<br>  supplements (optional unless your horse needs them)<br>  hay (50 dollars a month)<br>  <br>  for a new horse you are going to need:<br>  halter - a cheap halter will be about 20<br>  blankets (at least a sheet and a heavy and they should be turnout blankets) and blankets range from about 75-200 dollars? depending on quality... but remember in the horse world, you can ALWAYS find more expensive stuff, but its a lot harder to find cheaper stuff<br>  bridal (you'll need to buy a bit, reins and i think a nose band too)<br>  saddle (you don't get a full saddle, you'll need to buy leathers and irons too)<br>  saddle pads<br>  girth<br>  martingale/breast plate (optional)<br>  draw reins (optional)<br>  splint boots and/or bell boots (optional)<br>  shampoos and conditioners for bathing<br>  sweat scraper for bathing<br>  curries/brushes/hoof picks/combs for grooming<br>  a trunk to keep your supplies in<br>  creams in case he/she gets injured (optional)<br>  fly spray in the summer time (optional but highly recommended)<br>  cooler for riding in the winter (optional)<br>  fly sheet in the summer time (optional)<br>  cribbing strap (only if your horse cribs)<br>  <br>  if you are going to show your horse will cost you:<br>  braiding (for tail it is about 45 and for manes its about 30)<br>  trailering (unless you want to buy your own trailer and people tend to charge anywhere between $1-5 dollars per mile)<br>  clipping (you can buy your own clippers or someone can charge you to do it)<br>  show fees<br>  judging fees<br>  and if you want to be schooled before, you will pay a schooling fee (little warmup session with trainer)<br>  a show jacket for yourself<br>  a blouse for yourself<br>  <br>  if you want your horse to be trained you will need to pay for that too (our trainer charges $45 dollars every time he sits on a horse for however long... can be anywhere from 30 minutes to an hour)<br>  lessons<br>     a private will probably cost you anywhere between 30 and 60<br>     a group will probably cost you anywhere between 25 and 50<br>  <br>  riding apparel:<br>  helmet<br>  britches and boots or jeans and chaps (can be full length or half)<br>  spurs and crop (optional)<br>  gloves (optional)<br>  hairnet (small cost and optional)<br>  <br>  the vet bills can get kinda expensive too:<br>  you will need a coggins shot<br>  a rabies shot<br>  strangles shot<br>  rhino shot<br>  and any visit (prices vary so you're gonna want to call a vet)<br>  <br>  <br>  i didn't list all the prices because they vary so much buttt for most of your supplies you can look online<br>  i recommend smartpak.com (they have good, cheap prices) sstack, dover saddlery, and i'm sure you can find many others on google<br>  <br>  i think i got just about everything you need... i'm not trying to scare you out of getting a horse because i LOVE them myself... i'm just trying to let you know what you're in for...<br>  <br>  also check with the barn that you board at... many barns supply a lot of equipment that you can use everyday and borrow <br>  however, it is nice to have your own because barn equipment tends to be rather crappy and with grooming supplies i dont recommend "borrowing" because you dont know what horse it has been used on and many horses can have funguses|`|vfhKkiSKaa	I board at a stable down the road.  I pay $360/month for board, $12.00 every other month to cover worming and $40.00 every six weeks or so for a barefoot trim.<br>  <br>  Spring and fall shots run around $200-$300 per year.<br>  <br>  I would say I average about $5,000-$7,000 per year depending on how much I spend on "stuff".<br>  <br>  This would be just basic care and everyday expenses (treats, tack, etc).<br>  <br>  If he were to get sick or have any lameness issues that figure would drastically change.<br>  <br>  The most common ailments would be lameness and colic.  There is no way to give prices for any of this because it all depends on how bad the problem is.

You'll also have to get supplies, like grooming tools which can vary from $7.00-$25.00, and blankets can cost up to $70. If you dont have enough room for a horse, then boarding can cost a couple hundred dollars a month. It costs a lot, but its all worth it!|`|8QuASgEKaa	over here, it's about 100 dollars per month per horse for hay only. regular vet checkups 1-2 times per year range around 150 dollars per horse. farrier (trim and shoes all around) is about 95 dollars per horse every 8 weeks (2 months). then tack on vet bills for injuries/ illnesses, shows, gas money, extra misc stuff like new grooming supplies and new tack, plus board. <br>  <br>  so for a healthy horse with shoes all around not boarded, plus regular vet checkups w/ vaccinations... about 2150 thousand dollars per year per horse. not including water bills, shows, misc, ect.|`|HtDD1Banaa	The actual cost of buying a horse is usually pretty cheap, but it depends on where you buy it and what its breed is. It's usually only a few hundred dollars, especially if you adopt the horse. The most expensive part is the board of the horse. If you own a farm or have the land to take care of your horse, you obviously don't have to pay board. But, if you keep your horse at a barn/stable you generally pay monthly-usually $100 and up-and that can include feeding, bedding, general care. It will be your responsibility to ride the horse and pay for the vet and farrier-the person who takes care of their hoofs & shoes. The farrier's cost is like 20-35 dollars. The vet is like $100 and up. They need vaccinations and need to be wormed. They can also get dehydrated really easily and get colic, so they need a lot of care. It can be around $500 a month in total care.<br>  Hope that helps-srry its so long :)

He takes off in a big hurry. This trick was recommended to me by another cat owner who had success with it.

itiJVgRsaa	The reaseon for this is because cats have scent glands on their paws. when they scratch in front of their dish or something like that it is because she is marking her territory and saying "this is mine so don't touch it". not necessarily pawing fresh air, she is pawing the area where she eats .|`|hnfOU634aa	Its just a cat thing.

5PWzxw4Xaa	dog trainer 30 plus years -<br>  Thank you so much for the recipe.  I don't have time today to try it...but you can bet I will when I have time at the end of this week.  I did mark this question interesting...but besides that...I would like to thank you for taking the time to give this recipe out.  I have so many dogs that I deal with on a day in day out basis.  I plan to pass it on to the many families I work with as well.  Thank you again...you are kind.|`|RNqHUNgEaa	I have an easier recipe that's much better for dogs. Buy raw chicken livers, hearts, or gizzards. Then hand then to your dog. It's not natural for a dog to eat yoghurt and peanut butter, raw meat and organs are so much better for a dog than that.|`|G19tKe43aa	I ate them and i have to say they tasted like crap|`|Vk6s6VTAaa	THANKS!  Awesome!  My dog loves yogurt and pb, so I'm sure he'll love this!|`|Yyv4WQLiaa	im definately going to try this out, this receipe will be so handy in the summer when it starts getting hot out.|`|fFvXahMUaa	Wow, my dog loves them too!<br>  Where did you get that recipe?<br>  I marked it interesting!|`|HXt3R4cQaa	wow great recipe.... i will probely right it down.... later!

lTsDwY9Paa	go to akc.org and look on the breeders page
va8xvhthaa	Petfinder is a wonderful adoption site. They show you the animal that you like online, than you can go over to that shelter and see the animal yourself! You should try it! I'm sure you'll fall in love with a bunny sometime soon!|`|JIdDcTXGaa	check with your local SPCA/ASPCA (Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals) They can usually tell you where you can find animal specific rescues or you can check things like craigslist.com in the pet section. If you don't see what you want, put up a wanted ad. Maybe someone will have one they want to re-home or you can find a private breeder. My suggestion though is DO NOT get from a pet shop. They are usually not socialized enough. They are stuck in a cage and have VERY little human contact til they are purchased, which could be a month or more.
rLDf1gGGaa	Number 1 NO reptuable teacup breeders<br>  <br>  Let's start out by saying "THERE IS NO SUCH THING AS A "TEACUP" PUPPY".<br>  <br>  With that in mind, let me say this; It seems as though there is a plethora of people who are insistent on buying tiny puppies in the 2 to 4 pound range.  Also commonly referred to as a "Teacup puppy".<br>  <br>  The word "Teacup" has been used to merely describe the size of a puppy, meaning it is very small and will probably be under the standard size which is 4 to 7 pounds for the Toy Group, Yorkshire Terrier breed. We cannot imagine anyone wanting anything smaller than that!  Their bones are VERY fragile and can be broken by jumping off of a coach, falling off of a bed, being stepped on or worse.<br>  <br>  Many breeders, while tacking a whooping price on a puppy, "claim" to breed so called "teacups" as if they were a breed all their own. Don't be fooled! They are NOT a breed of their own.  <br>  <br>  If a breeder says they specialize in "teacups" RUN, RUN, RUN for the hills! Most "TEACUP" puppies are in reality, a premature puppy.<br>  <br>  Most females are bred on the ninth through the fifteenth day of their heat cycles. Eggs can be fertilized for up to 72 hours after any of these breeding's. Therefore, it is possible to have puppies conceived up to a week or so younger than the puppies first conceived in a litter.  However, when the first puppies conceived are mature and ready to be born, labor starts and all the puppies will be born, no matter when they were fertilized.  <br>  <br>  Some of the problems that may be encountered are both genetic and congenital in these tiny babies and the list is a long one.<br>  <br>  The risk of open fontanels (soft spot from the cranial bone not forming), portosystemic shunts (PSS- abnormal vessel that allows blood to bypass the liver. As a result the blood is not cleansed by one of the bodies filters: the liver.), hypoglycemia, cardiac problems, collapsing trachea, luxating patellas, Leggs Calves Perthes disease, seizures, hydroencephaly, blindness and digestive problems can be increased in these tiny babies.<br>  <br>  Problems such as respiratory problems can remain or worsen throughout their lives. These babies frequently are so fragile that they do not live more than a few years. There have been several tiny Yorkies as adults who still had open fontanels and their owners had to carry nourishment with them all the time. Their vets have felt it unsafe to give a full dose of vaccine so the puppies had to get several injections to be on the safe side.<br>  <br>  There is no such thing as a "tea cup" Yorkshire Terrier, Maltese, Poodle, or any other breed for that matter.  They simply do not exist. "Tea-cup" is just a marketing ploy given by unethical and unscrupulous breeders to drive up the price of their puppies!<br>  <br>  <br>  So called "Teacups" fetch anything from $1000 to $10,000! This is ridiculous and shameful! There are a lot of chronically, unhealthy puppies because unscrupulous breeders and puppy mills are inbreeding.  Some poor darlings only live for a very, very short time!<br>  <br>  They take the little teeny, tiny Yorkies and they breed 2 1/2 pounders with 3 pounders ... well, they’re playing with genetics. You should NEVER breed a female of any breed less than 5 pounds.<br>  <br>  PLEASE educate yourselves before buying a tiny puppy whether it is a Yorkie or any other breed.  You could be in for months or years of heartbreak not to mention staggering veterinarian bills!  <br>  <br>  DO YOUR HOMEWORK!!!  IF YOU WANT A HEALTHY PUPPY, DON'T FALL FOR THE TEACUP ACT!<br>  <br>  <br>  Avoiding the hype. Have you heard these phrases? Teacup Yorkies? Tiny Toy Yorkies? Extreme Tinies? Some breeders use these cutesy phrases as "marketing terms" for the different weights that Yorkies come in. All of these phrases are made-up. Yes, certainly, Yorkies come in different weights, but they do NOT come in different weight "varieties". Whether they weigh 4 pounds or 6 pounds or 8 pounds, they are called, simply, Yorkshire Terriers. Some are simply smaller or larger than others. The larger individuals are sturdier, so don't dismiss them as good pets.<br>  <br>  In fact, I do NOT recommend a Yorkshire Terrier under 4 pounds. These individuals are great risks in the health department. Their bones are extremely fragile. There is not enough room in their mouth for healthy teeth. Their internal organs are often weak and can fail suddenly. They tend to have great difficulty regulating their blood sugar and can suddenly fall into hypoglycemic comas.<br>  <br>  Responsible Yorkshire Terrier breeders never try to produce these tiny high-risk creatures. If a tiny one pops up in one of their litters, they do their best to find the best home that can keep it alive, yes, but they try hard NOT to produce them in the first place because it's not fair to the poor little creature.<br>  <br>      On the other hand, some breeders deliberately breed tiny high-risk Yorkies because they can sell them for high prices to unsuspecting owners, or to owners who selfishly demand that they "want" one because it's "adorable" or to satisfy their "mothering" instincts. Don't be one of these people. If you reward these irresponsible breeders by giving them your money, you are encouraging them to keep producing tiny, sickly, short-lived creatures. No, be a responsible buyer and stick with Yorkshire Terriers who will mature at 4 pounds and up, who have the best chance of living a normal healthy life. In this way, breeders will be motivated to produce these sizes. (These individuals, by the way, will weigh at least 2-3 pounds at 10-12 weeks old.)<br>  <br>  Reptuable dog breeder breed to AKC standard-TEACUPS are below AKC standard and AREN'T reconised by the AKC.<br>  <br>  Anyone who breed teacups or toy yorkshire terrier are irresponsible!

It's a marketing term used by unethical breeders to describe dogs bred to be extremely small with no regard to the dog's overall health--in short, no something no reputable breeder would ever do.<br>  <br>  I suggest that before you actively try to find a dog, you take the time to research the breed first.  It will enable you to determine if a dog you are considering is a quality representation of the breed.  Familiarize yourself with scams and red flags associated with bad breeders so that you know what to avoid in your search.  Educate yourself on the breeds specific issues that plague Yorkies so that you can discuss with breeders you consider how they have eliminated and tested for the issues within their programs.<br>  <br>  Attend some dog shows, handling classes and introduce yourself to breeders.  Also, visit ytca.org (the parent club for the breed) for a list of recommended breeders.|`|Cfk1kr8Daa	No reputable breeder will produce a toy or teacup anything.<br>   The Yorkshire Terrier Club and AKC have a published standard, and the miniaturized versions of that dog would not fit either one.<br>  <br>   Whenever anyone makes a point of producing a dog that is not within the standard of a breed, all other characteristics are abandoned in the selection process in order to get the size they want.  That includes all the genes that provide healthy, happy dogs that can reproduce by themselves normally.<br>  <br>    If you want a good dog, go to a good breeder.  They won't be  making anything otehr than standard Yorkies.|`|Bw18seFqaa	a reputable breeder does NOT breed "teacup" or "toy" yorkies.<br>  <br>  Yorkies come in ONE size only, which is already less than 7 pds.. a good breeder does not use scam labels like "teacup" on her dogs.<br>  <br>  try the yorkie club for a referral..<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.ytca.org/" rel="nofollow">http://www.ytca.org/</a>|`|gwUMipsUaa	You won't find a reputable breeder that breeds teacups.  <br>  <br>  But you can find plenty of Yorkies up for adoption here.  <a href="http://petfinder.com/" rel="nofollow">http://petfinder.com/</a>  Type in Yorkshire Terrier.<br>  <br>  There are certain breeds that do come in the Toy category that AKC recognizes.

GzV5dwz3aa	After going through college, vet school, and interning then you will be making a steady income, but you won't just jump in and start making a great six figure income. Any job requires staring at the bottom and working your way up. It is better to start out without your own practice because you wil get the experiene you need and be able to see how a vet practice is run. If then you decide that you want your own practice then you will not make as large of an income becuase you will be paying the taxes and your employees so you will make a smaller income, but you will be your own boss. As far as hours it depends on the shift you work. Sometimes you have to be the oncall emergency vet or sometimes you may be doing daily appointments. It all depends. Having a good base in all subjects is good to build upon. Vte school is very competitive and you want to have a good foundation in all subjects so you can stand out amongst your peers. Good luck!|`|5KKW7LMBaa	i hope i can help answer you question - though the other answer has given you some really good advice already!<br>  <br>  1) reclaiming the cost of study. i don't know where you are located but i have a debt for my science degree (not a vet science one though) and i guess it's just part of what you agree to when you study, it is one of the sacrifices you make. its hard to know when you will pay it off exactly (all depends on your other circumstances) but when you consider that you will graduate as a professional and will have a career with a guareenteed income i think you should manage your study bill fine. a lot of people have huge debts for cars and houses etc and have quite a fixed income because they have no professional qualifications or may not have the opportunity to advance in their job. so i think the investment in your career is well worth the cost of study. your college will end up paying for itself.<br>  <br>  2) working for someone else - good way to start a career, you continue to learn by working with other professionals and being exposed to a variety of work situations, you are part of a larger organisation with benefits of superannuation, health insurance etc etc, you get to work as a team, you can specialise and do further study, share shifts and workload with others, you can finish your day of work and go home without the worry of your own business 24/7! owing your own business - flexibility, acheivement, greater rewards but higher risks, be your own boss, build your business into your lifestyle, better financial gain (but higher risk and responsibility).<br>  <br>  3) should be standard holidays and working hours, might be more flexible at certain times of year and then busier at others (ie during foaling season or during an outbreak of disease or if you were part of a vet team attending certain competitions/racing events). every job has its burdens time wise. being stuck in an office 9-5pm mon-fri doesnt suit some people, getting up at 3am to deliver a foal but maybe getting to go home for lunch and have a sleep might not suit some people either. its all about your lifestyle and what you are prepared to compromise on and gain on.<br>  <br>  4) maths helps with all science stuff, and speaking from personal experience as someone who just spoke to their vet today having good communication skills as a vet really helps!!!!!!!!!! but as the other person said in the other reply, vet science is really competitive and you need some pretty solid grades to get in. if you are bright enough to get a place in college, you are bright enough to work hard even at the parts that are tough!!!!! (because even the most intelligent people have to knuckle down and just try their hardest and just study their butts off!!!)<br>  <br>  goodluck and follow your dreams.<br>  <br>  ps everyone wonders if they are just working all the time with no time to enjoy themselves... unless you are a retired millionaire hahaha.. just find a job that suits your personality, is financially rewarding and keeps you stimulated mentally! follow your dreams!!!!!!!

YnCUyvK7aa	Keep using the medicine.  It will take 10-14 days to be completely rid of it.  And keep using the medicine for at least 3-5 days after you stop seeing spots on any of the fish.<br>  <br>  It will help to raise the water temperature to 85 degrees, but do this a few degrees at a time so your fish acclimate to the temperature change.<br>  <br>  And lighting doesn't matter for ich, it's only necessary to turn off the lights when treating velvet which has a photosynthetic pigment it can use to make food.<br>  <br>  Here's a good source of information about dealing with ich.  <a href="http://www.badmanstropicalfish.com/forum/index.php/topic,1285.0.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.badmanstropicalfish.com/forum...</a>|`|gHKJmygoaa	You also need to raise the temp to 82 degrees fahrenheit because that will shorten the life span of the ick and cover the tank with a thick cloth or blanket. Light encourages the growth of ick, so depriving it of light until it is all gone will help [usually 1-3 weeks at least]. You're just going to have to slowly re-acclimate your fish to light by pulling the cloth back little by little every day after the ick is gone.|`|25CAIGfeaa	raise temp to 82 and keep adding the med.

3giaPYe8aa	First off the breed is called a Bulldog by the AKC, not an English Bulldog.  You do NOT want relatively affordable with this breed.  They are the #1 breed for heath issues and 87% of all Bulldogs have Hip Dysplasia.  Save your money and wait to find a responsible breeder or don't get one at all.  If you spend $2500-$3000.00 for your pup, you will be actually be saving thousands of $'s of medical bills in the long run.|`|Bw18seFqaa	an affordable bulldog is still expensive..  they are expensive to breed and often have health issues..  if you find a puppy being sold for "cheap", then the breeder is cutting corners on assuring healthy dogs..   it will cost you plenty in vet bills later.<br>  <br>  You are better off to save up and find a reputable breeder who does genetic health testing.. a pet quality will cost anywhere from $1500-2500 in that breed.|`|Ubs1HTnoaa	Check out petfinder.com or contact English Bulldog Rescue (<a href="http://www.englishbulldogrescue.net/)" rel="nofollow">http://www.englishbulldogrescue.net/)</a> to adopt a dog. Purebred puppies are often rescued from puppy mills and adopted out locally- if you are only interested in purebreds but want to adopt. If you do choose to go through a breeder, make sure it is someone reputable who is more concerned with bettering the breed than making money off dogs.|`|AA11244754	Have you tried the A.S.P.C.A?

NIPmV4uMaa	You could sell the tank to me... I'd buy it from you.<br>  <br>  <br>  If you haven't owned a reptile before, you definitely need to start with a "beginner" snake or lizard; one that is docile, easy to care for, and doesn't get too big. Whether or not you're afraid of larger snakes, you should only handle bigger snakes (I'm talking 7ft+) if you know what you are doing and have had experiance with other snakes.<br>  <br>  My first and altime favorite snake is the ball python. Here is a great caresheet: <a href="http://www.kingsnake.com/ballpythonguide/" rel="nofollow">http://www.kingsnake.com/ballpythonguide...</a><br>  They average out around 4ft and are pretty heavy bodied. They are also very docile if you handle on a regular basis, and rarely bite, though you should be prepared with some neosporin and bandages, as snakes do bite when they are afraid, and you cannot hold that against them.<br>  <br>  The only problem with BPs is that they often have eating problems. Last night, mine just ate for the first time in 3 months. This is why it is VERY important that you get a snake from a reputable breeder and not a petstore, as pet stores usually have their BPs imported directly from Africa, in which case they most often won't eat. Also, you should ask the breeder if you can see the snake eat a frozen/thawed rodent. If the snake eats a frozen/thawed rodent in front of you, there is little cause to worry.<br>  <br>  <br>  The cage you have would house a baby ball python for six months or so.<br>  <br>  A corn snake or a king snake are also good beginner snakes. Corn snakes would need a larger enclosure when they are older, but a small species of king snake would be ok in that for its entire life.|`|Ek92oEelaa	if i where you i wioul go for a ball python too they are very good pets you just have to make shur you hold theam alot or they can get mean.|`|qUGVYNItaa	it depends wheter your snake can collect farts with a milk jug or not
TM2uTrfXaa	You should get the kitten. Sounds like a perfect deal. Ignore the comment about a 8week kitten not being able to be potty trained as that is just not true. Kittens learn from momma and should be trained at that age. Enjoy your new Kitten!!!|`|oDVx7nSxaa	I'd be very, very cautious here. When something sounds too good to be true, it probably is.  A quality Persian from a reputable breeder will cost $500 and up, without breeding rights.  Persians from back-yard-breeders sell them for $200 and under.  The biggest difference is the health issues that you'll be faced with down the road.  Persians are prone to inherited diseases like PKD (polycystic kidney disease), heart disease, and blood clots called thrombosis.  Reputable breeders have their cats tested for PKD and don't breed from them, and will certify that they are free of it.  Same thing with the heart disease and blood clots - you are less likely to find them in in cats from a reputable breeder.   <br>  <br>  I'd ask a lot of questions, especially about their line being certified of PKD.  This can put a cat into early and terminal renal failure by age 3 or 4, and cats with the significant heart issues can rack up medical bills very quickly if they develop a heart murmur that requires treatment by a cardiologist (an echocardiogram generally is in the $500+ price range).  Your bargain price kitten may cost you dearly down the road, both in medical costs and in emotional costs.<br>  <br>  Just do your homework where the potential health issues are concerned - back yard breeders will often claim to be other than what they really are.|`|rLDf1gGGaa	Number 1; How can 8week old kitten be potty trainned? Sound like a deal too good to be true. White cats are Prone to deafness, particular blue eyed white cats-they are also sensitive to sunburn which leads to skin cancer.<br>  <br>   Number 2; That seems far too cheap for a persian, I rather support a shelter and pay abit more for it to be neutered and safe a life, then support irresponsible breeder.<br>  <br>  <br>  Number 3; Persian have some very special needs and needs lot of grooming<br>  <br>  Number 4; Yes, kittens in australia are now neutered/spayed as young as 6week old.More commonly down in other countries at 6months old.<br>  <br>  Kittens are NEVER potty trainned at 8week old<br>  <br>  Persian cats - Special Needs<br>  <br>  The long, beautiful coat demands constant grooming. Persians need daily brushing and regular baths (preferably monthly). If you fail to provide the necessary grooming, the coat is likely to mat and tangle, and professional help may be required.<br>  <br>  If you plan to show a Persian cat, seek advice from an experienced breeder who can teach you the tricks of the trade. Alternatively, buy one of the many professional books on the breed (seen to the right of this article).<br>  <br>  The special form of the face may sometimes cause eye drainage problems, which can create a build-up of residue. Owners should clean the eyes of such cats on a daily basis.<br>  <br>  A growing concern among cat owners in general and Persians in particular is PKD, which stands for Polycystic Kidney Disease, a genetic kidney disease that appears to be more common among Persians than other cats. In some tests, it was found that nearly 40% of Persian cats were carrying this disease.|`|hnfOU634aa	sounds like a pretty good deal if it really is a confirmed persian kitten.  You can't neuter a kitten that young so that is not surprising.  But kittens should absolutely be potty trained by that age.  If it wasn't potty trained I'd be concerened!|`|DQlZIzAFaa	haha, not confusing at all, but yes that's a crazy good deal, purebreds are typically like $500 or more<br>  <br>  EDIT: My kitten was potty-trained at 8 weeks, i had him since he was 6 weeks, that other poster doesn't know what he's talking about.|`|wIHlVT2Paa	no. give it for free along with a bowl of grapes|`|5UQiaSq1aa	GET THE KITTEN, that is a great deal. I was at a good dealing pet store, yet they were selling persian kittens for $400!!! Expecially if its potty trained. I would adopt it. How could you resist that cute little face. You'd have a new, loyal, sweet best friend in the house. You'd have company, and someone to cheer you up when you are sad or scared. All animals are known to calm people down, by stroking them, or petting them. They are a joy to have!!!
pSYzKDaDaa	Probably means you can't then, if your father says no.  But the best you can do is do a lot of research on caring and keeping that particular kind of animal and present it to your father to prove you know what the hell you're doing.  And try to be super responsible and patient because you won't change his mind overnight.
TkJn9gO0aa	Well you already have one of the species in the "Big 6" of the snake world (B. constrictor).<br>  <br>  Are you looking for larger snakes or longer snakes? For example, cornsnakes and kingsnakes are awesome Colubrids, but they are relatively small when compared to Indigo Sankes, Fox Snakes, Gopher/Pine/Bull Snakes, and Cribos.<br>  <br>  If you are looking at a larger boa or python then I suggest a Burmese Python. Reticulated Pythons can have nasty dispostions and can easily outgrow a Burmese. <br>  <br>  I would recommend staying away from Green Anacondas as they are somewhat more difficult to deal with as far as bites and letting go.<br>  <br>  You could look at Scrub Pythons but they are usually more expensive that the Burmese.<br>  <br>  African Rock Pythons are also more expensive than Burms, and can reach longer lengths.<br>  <br>  I would suggest looking at a Yellow Anaconda as they don't get nearly as long as the green anaconda.<br>  <br>  EDIT / ADDITIONAL DETAILS:<br>  <br>  As far as my experience, I really don't have much concerning the larger snakes as I'm more partial to Vipers and Colubrids(they take up less room LOL)<br>  <br>  All the Burmese Pythons I have dealt with have been puppy-dog "tame" and could be handled very well. They also weren't as "impulsive" when feeding came time around. <br>  <br>  Reticulated Pythons on the other hand have not done much for me as far as dispelling their notorious attitude problems that show up pretty consistently when they are concerned. I'll just say this, stay very clear during feeding. <br>  <br>  I have no experience at all woth African Rock Pythons, Olive Pythons, or Scrub Pythons.<br>  <br>  I used to work in a place with a 15 ft Green Anaconda. I would handle it all the time and nobody could understand why......I was new there. Then one day it bit me...and bit me good. The amount of blood was pretty intense for small pin-pricks. It  wasn't as nearly as bad as it looked. Since there was a tattoo parlor across the street, I thought it would be cool if they put some ink in the bite marks(perfect half-oval bite indention on by shoulder/back). <br>  <br>  I've never had any experience with Yellow Anacondas but I am looking to get one. They only get about 10-12 ft, so not too much different in length from larger  boa constrictor subspecies.<br>  <br>  I'll star this question and maybe Madsnakeman will see it....I think he has experience with some of the larger snakes|`|b88691c1425e641c73274dcb27f8a891aa	You should consider getting a Brazilian Rainbow Boa. They are beautiful snakes! :)|`|7h42S3lNaa	well i think (personally) That tree boas are pretty big are a beautiful.They are very color full and as you say one will get a glass room i bet doing one of the glass rooms with one of these would be a great display!
I38WF5aFaa	They look like buff orpingtons.  I don't know about the coughing or sneezing.  The eggs will be safe to eat unless one has a cracked shell.  Don't clip the wings unless there is a problem with them flying.  Most chickens are not very good flyers.  Its ok if the rooster eats the same feed as the hens. Commercial layer pellets are a complete feed.  You don't need to add grit or oyster shell to it.  I would shut the door at night.  Roosters have a lot more personality than hens.  Yours will get noisy when he reaches sexual maturity.  He will become quite annoying.|`|f0dXmrJiaa	ther buff cochins

JIdDcTXGaa	My advice, keep them in the house. If you are going to keep an animal like a guinea pig, keep them warm, 65 to 70 degrees, like with a human.
K6fasl6kaa	your only hope is to be sure they are not left unsupervised and the you assertively train missy that her behavior toward the little one is not tolerated.  your son may have to keep her on a leash while at your house to do this.  it's hard to get that message across because it's just natural puppy behavior.  good luck.
vfhKkiSKaa	A few weeks, about 3 or so.|`|GaL66jbQaa	about 2 weeks|`|fFvXahMUaa	If it grows to a big dog, normally 3 weeks.<br>  If it grows to a small doy 14-21 days.<br>  <br>  Hope that helped! :D|`|k9gC23apaa	I have new born pups as we speak !

f5a8d99afbb73cd0703df99b87996901aa	Soon after weaning the family unit breaks up and the cats become "just cats" to each other.  Mothers, sons, fathers, daughters, brothers, and sisters will mate. The best thing to do is have the cats fixed.  Inbred kittens can have all kinds of problems.|`|lTsDwY9Paa	No she will not know the male is her son and yes they will probably try to mate. Keep them separate especially since the male is injured. As soon as your cat is out of heat get her spayed. Any kittens from a mother son mating will most likely be sickly and might die.|`|8584e0329fb17c662606d5a6a8650ee2aa	They will absolutely mate.  Cats don't make that distinction at all.  Get these cats spayed and neutered.  Call your local humane society or SPCA and stop a cat overpopulation problem before it starts.|`|EqfWi7Ohaa	no it doesnt make a bit of difference - the cats will mate . The cats will have low slung ears and play the banjo(just kidding)
w1lh1INHaa	A catapult (pun intended) would be the obvious choice.<br>  <br>  But, do you want to put that kind of idea into a kindergartner's head?  That cats are evil and they should be shot up into trees?  Personally, I would be concerned that perhaps a child would think a real cat evil and think it okay to launch a cat into a tree, or something worse.|`|4aAhEK9daa	So you want to teach kindergarten kids to abuse animals?  That's a bit disturbing.  Use a trebuchet and launch yourself away from this child so an adult with a bit more common sense can help him write a story.|`|7AfEG5rWaa	maybe they feed him a bowl of some food that cats really like, but they lace it with really super potent bean and they put a candle behind him and he farts and it ignites and he rockets up to the top of the tree|`|EZkKZtGxaa	shove a jet pack on its back lol. umm put it into a connon and shoot it up there :D
A7XV2K3Paa	I think to some extent it will simply take time. I had a situation in which I lost my 18  year old, and my 14-year old when through a severe depression after the death of her dear companion. The vets had no suggestions for me besides Feliway (a phermone spray that can comfort). This did little for her. I did speak with a person familiar with holistics. She suggested that I try "Pet Calm" by Richard's Organics (mine was $8.99). I was desparate since she'd lost about 7-8 pounds in 2 weeks so I tried it. Within 24-hours, I had a different cat. She was eating and drinking again and acting MUCH more normal. I do believe it turned her around. I must warn you, however, it smells horrible and he won't like it, but it's worth it if it works. This may help. <br>  <br>  Another thing that may help - give your older cat TONS of extra attention and a few extra treats. He may be feeling replaced. Pick him up and cuddle him, seek him out, and make sure that he KNOWS that you love him. You will probably have to give him more attention than the young one for a time. Later, once he begins to respond, put one on each side of you and love them both. Think of it this way - what often happens with an older child when a new baby is introduced? It's similar. <br>  <br>  Here's one more thought. In the cat world, a neutered male is on the very bottom of the pecking order. Even a spayed female is higher up. Neutering the other may help. Best wishes.|`|fD1OLPk3aa	i got a new dog and my older dog didn't like it but after awhile he got used to it and it could be the neutering but it mite take time of mite not.|`|0WIebxFaaa	YOU CANT
5PWzxw4Xaa	dog trainer 30 plus yrs- Potty Training<br>  I put a harness on them, leash them with a retractable leash and stick the handle in my pocket. Scolding loudly or even too sternly can bring on confusion more than understanding.  Wherever I go they go...even when I have to go to the bathroom...or if someone else in the family is home they tuck her in their pocket.  This brings trust...you become a leader they can trust.  It also helps you to be able to “read” her signals.  Sometimes it is just a squat, sometimes they turn, other times they simply look up quickly then squat.  Amid the squat, scoop her up and talk sweetly saying, “go po-T outside” repeat it until you are outside.  Keep her on the leash so she does not lose her train of thought.  Keep repeating the command as if you are saying “don’t the flowers smell sweet today”...so it becomes a pleasant thing for her to hear thus she will be more likely to listen and learn.  If she poos inside accidently keep her near you and pick it up with a paper towel.  Squat down slowly and show it to her and say “go po-T outside”.  Then take her out with you to put it in “her spot”.  Do not give her the entire yard to go in until she has potty training down pat.  Let her collection stay for a few days so she gets that she has a designated area.  A lot of times they will continue to go in that area for a lifetime and it makes cleaning up a lot easier...no hunting.  After she goes outside kneel down and pet her saying all the “good po-T outside” ‘s that you can stand.  Over exaggerate your happiness. You can then scoop her up and hug her, rub her belly, clap softly when she finishes.  Remember to keep a cool head...don’t show anger or frustration because they will not respond positively to that.  You can do this...remember it takes time and consistency as well as love.  I am sure you will do a great job!|`|JsBb732Maa	<a href="http://www.midwesthomes4pets.com/Information/HowToCrateTrain.aspx" rel="nofollow">http://www.midwesthomes4pets.com/Informa...</a>  Crate training tips, hope it helps.|`|DE4tVLgiaa	If you find pee on the floor, stick your dog's nose in it, tell him bad dog, and then make him ring the bell by the door.

This mouse should be screened for intestinal parasites, infectious disease, diet issues, and bacterial overgrowth.  Diarrhea means food is not being absorbed and digested appropriately.

The stool will be bloody and runny with some mucus.  The poop smells like blood it does not smell like any kind of poop you have ever smelt. <br>  <br>  If your pup had parvo she would not be eating or drinking she would be very lethargic.

To get rid of these, you need get rid of bedding, use a bleach mix and soak water bowls, branches, and clean out cage with it.  When the cage is cleaned and aired out, use newspaper for your bedding for a while, those mites love to harvest in the shavings.  Then you need to soak your snake, I find it works best use a Rubbermaid container with snap able lid, drill hole in top and side of container for breathing purposes.  Get a towel soak in warm water and place snake in tub for 20-30 minutes.  This works very well when it come to shedding time.  You may have to repeat the bleaching every 2 weeks for a couple of months.|`|NIPmV4uMaa	Could you take some pictures and message me the links?

A7XV2K3Paa	I think I can help you with this one! My cats had the same problem. Anyway, I found that it was the food.  For a period of time, I tried a couple of different foods (samples). Some of the foods they would throw up right away. Others did well. Of course, switching foods can be tough on them too. You may also have a kitty with a sensitive stomach.  I currently am feeding Eagle Pack Holistic Select Chicken and Rice and Merrick canned foods. Merrick is rated very highly, and I've read next to no negatives. I have heard many negatives on Royal Canin. I strongly recommend that you do a little research - it is well worth the time. Also, keep in mind that there is no perfect food or one that fits all - every kitty is different. BUT- avoid corn, wheat and soy in foods as they can cause allergies and an array of illnesses in cats. (yes, I've done a lot of research)|`|fac19b1dbb2ff2df17b3984f0bd6c4b3aa	You need to vary this with canned food like SHEBA which is light as my black Persian is the same he cannot digest dry food very well.Sprinkle dry food on the tinned food but only a little bit you will see that an improvement will happen you can also try the sachets/pouches of cat food like Whiskers but do not give the beef variety as it tends to be harder for them to digest as it seems very rich.You can also try some boiled chicken shred it and give once a week as a treat the same with white cod flake it and give once a week for variety.|`|YxFDiEaCaa	My persian cat was sick at least once a day for a few weeks, the vet did numerous tests and could not find what the problem was so he gave me some "ZANTAC SYRUP" to give to him which stopped him from being sick, but he said your cat can't have this medicine forever.

Since they're worried about mess, offer to vacuum or pick up every day or so (if they KNOW you'll do it, they'll believe you when you say it...)<br>  <br>  Other than that - no means no.|`|gwUMipsUaa	I would advise you volunteer at your local shelter for at least six months.  If they still are against the idea, wait until you have your own place for a dog.|`|PM23RDycaa	You can't convince them that they want a dog. They either want on or they don't.

It would not be fair to take in an animal your parents do not want, it could easily be put up for re-homing as soon as you leave for Uni / first home (there is almost no chance of you being able to take a dog to either).  A middle aged dog would have a hard time finding a new home and it would not be fair.

I really would not suggest that.|`|MYEEK4dcaa	If you rinse the food to get all the syrup out, yes, the dogs can have canned fruit.  It is the syrup that isn't good for them.  Even if the fruit is "packed in water," it's still too sweet for them.  Dogs love sweets, though, so you may be tempted to leave the syrup on the fruit before giving it to them.  Please don't do that.  Because dogs don't brush their teeth twice a day like humans do, they can get cavities like humans do from too many sweets and not enough brushing.  And when dogs get cavities, the cavities aren't usually filled - the tooth is pulled.<br>  <br>  Good luck!<br>  <br>  Apacapacas|`|q2CPBbWnaa	Yea dogs can eat canned fruit, as long as its REAL fruit, they can eat it frozen or canned

nMe35c9Aaa	the best treats for your pets are always Natural ones. go to the grocery store and pick up some fruits and veggies, nut and Natural dried fruit like cranberries which will always be in the produce section. and if you go to an exotic pet store they usually have little bags of freeze dried meal worms and other bugs. sugar gliders really like these and they are a good source of protein for them. but fresh food is always best, dried and processed foods lose a lot of there natural nutrients.<br>  <br>   not to mention fresh food is much cheaper than those packets of stuff you get from the pet store. they are way over priced|`|44kEtDvIaa	Sunflower seeds and pecans make good treats.

Livebearers can handle brackish water.<br>  Bee gobies like to have a snail shell to make a cave out of. They will be protective of their cave and aggressive with each other.<br>  In my experience they are delicate fish, definitely not for beginners.|`|e27a0140d6c769e130a863ab1952f2b9aa	I do not think they get very big, at least I have not seen one that was very large, So going by the 1 inch of fish to a gallon of water, I would say that you could run 30 of the little guys in your tank without significant crowding.  You would have to alter that number if you wanted any other tank mates to share their water.  Keep in mind of 1 inch to a gallon and you will be fine.  If you over crowd a tank you are inviting disease to spread in your tank.|`|LPFGUjFAaa	i dont actually know how large bumblebee gobies get, but with fish i usaully let there be one inch worth of fish for each gallon of water.  so if a gobie is three inches long, you could have 5 of them.  if a gobie is five inches long, you could have three of them.|`|PlBHhU3Kaa	um well you can get more than 10 they are tiny little guys<br>  <br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.aquariacentral.com/forums/showthread.php?t=9508" rel="nofollow">http://www.aquariacentral.com/forums/sho...</a>|`|35f5a298a3b38c410ad01e492036c508aa	Two would be suffice.

l0ktQUnWaa	It could be a respiratory infection, best treated by a vet. What is the temperature, a Uro needs a basking spot of 110-130 degrees. Also, do not keep any water in the tank.

6yoCcGBWaa	Bird-safe Paints<br>  <br>  <br>  Pet birds can be hard on cages, often chewing, scratching or wearing the paint. They can ingest flakes of paint which can be harmful to their health. Pet birds can also be sensitive to fumes from new paint.<br>  <br>  If you want to repaint an older cage, here are a few tips.<br>  <br>  First, the wire should be scrubbed with a wire brush to remove any loose zinc flakes, and then sanded smooth by hand.<br>  <br>  In general, look for paints which:<br>  - do not contain lead, zinc or chromate<br>  - are "high adhesion", formulated to bond with the metal surface<br>  - are hard-wearing<br>  - are fast drying<br>  <br>  Another suggestion is to look on the back of the paint can and see if it is safe for a human baby. There usually is a picture of a mom holding a child's hand somewhere on the can.<br>  <br>  While painting, be sure to:<br>  - move bird to a separate room<br>  - work in a well-ventilated area<br>  - apply paint in a thin coat<br>  - if you're using a spray paint, be sure to hold a large piece of paper or cardboard behind the cage, moving it as you go, to act as a backdrop which catches the excess paint.<br>  <br>  When the job is done.....WAIT. If possible, give your freshly painted cage a week or longer before using. Solvent-based paints take time after initial drying to release the solvent vapours. NEVER cover a bird in a freshly painted cage.<br>  <br>  This tip to help minimize paint chewing by birds:<br>  Birds love to climb, and paint damage often occurs from birds' gripping the cage with their beak to assist them in climbing up the cage. Aviculturist Eb Cravens also once reported that, by wiring perches or appropriately-sized tree branches onto the inner sides of the wire enclosures, the birds will be encouraged to climb from place to place by gripping these with their beaks, so that they do not even touch the wire when climbing.<br>  <br>  A recommendation from Palace Cages:<br>  "Much of the cage industry today uses a "Powder Coat" system. They advertise it is easy to clean and super hard. It may be easier to clean but I don't use powder coat on my cages. The chip problem gets much worse with a very hard material. Powder coat is not paint. It is a thermoplastic. Chips will not break up and and be more likely to cause intestinal blockages. It is also difficult to repair. It is melted on to the cage at aprox. 300 degrees. Powder Coat can be less of a threat with some birds, but I don't recommend it for hook bills."|`|LkdZPgvjaa	You can, I've done it (for same reasons you have) and I used Rust-Oleum.  Never had any problem.|`|f1006988bdbdd7ae5e5276623f046308aa	1st you will need to sand a old cage a little to get the new paint to stick. 2nd use spray paint. Do not use anything that you have to apply with a brush, that never works when painting metal very well. About any decent spray paint should be ok, but make sure the birds are no where around when you do it. Preferably if you paint indoors, paint with a window slightly open.|`|7e5EYu0Daa	i don''t think so because the toxicity will eventually cause the bird to fall ill because they like to chew on their cage

b88691c1425e641c73274dcb27f8a891aa	If this is your first time owning a reptile, a snake more specifically, I would recommend starting off with either a Corn Snake or a Ball Python. They are both considered "beginner snakes" and are generally easy to take care of. Which ever you choose between the two is completely up to your taste, as Corn Snakes come in more colourful patterns and morphs than Ball Pythons do. <br>  Personally, I would recommend a corn snake because ball pythons are known to be picky eaters and sometimes go on hunger strikes for no good reason. Corn snakes are typically cheaper than ball pythons aswell. <br>  Before you go out and buy any snake, you should do a little research on the type of snake you think you want so that when you actually buy the snake, it will be well cared for. I have seen way too many people go out and impulse buy a snake, not knowing what they are getting themselves into and as a result, the snake ends up suffering.<br>  I also suggest staying AWAY from pet stores.

Now keep in mind, there's no such thing as a "tame" snake, or a "domesticated" snake, so while you may get a yellow rat snake that will live out all it's 20 - 25 years without offering to bite you once, you could get a red rat that bites you every time you go to pick it up... they're all individuals, and all generalizations are false.|`|2CbfO4jWaa	almost all north american rat snakes make good easy to keep and breed captives. the few that dont are the green rat and to a lesser extent the trans pecos rat. i would stay away from all asian rat snake species since they are typically aggressive and have VERY quirky feeding habits in my experience. but as "givemeananswernow" stated they are still all individuals.|`|44kEtDvIaa	If you're looking for a good first snake, check site below.

It's more interesting if I move it around and take it out sometimes then put it back in a week later.|`|cdq7Wvd6aa	I don't think that would be a good idea, it would probably just confuse it. Maybe you should buy it a friend? If you don't want to, if you spend lots of time with your Guinea pig you'll be great company for it. Some good Guinea pig toys (if you need ideas) are things like cardboard tubes with aren't very expensive, or if you have hay you can put fresh vegetables in there and they will have fun searching for it!|`|xarKlp0Oaa	My friend had 2 guinea pigs for about a year and one died. She noticed that the other one wasn't acting normal like usual so she put a mirror in the cage and it really helped almost instantly. I think you should put a mirror in with him. Hope I helped.

They are black and white-kinda look like they are wearing are tuxedo-hence the nickname.<br>  <br>  Calico-Is not a breed, again it is colour.<br>  <br>  Rather safe a life from a SHELTER, then buy a cat based on colour or breed.<br>  <br>  These are  some Breeds<br>  MaineCoon cat,Norwegian Forest Cat<br>  Siberian Forest cat,Turkish Van,<br>  Turkish Angora,Birman,Ragdoll,Ragamuffin<br>  Somali,Persian,Himalayan(Colourpoint longhair)<br>  Nebelung,Balinese,Javanese(Colourpoint Balinese)<br>  Tiffanie,Cymric,American Bobtail<br>  <br>  <a href="http://cats.about.com/od/felinegenetics/a/colorpatterns_2.htm" rel="nofollow">http://cats.about.com/od/felinegenetics/...</a><br>  <a href="http://www.messybeast.com/tricolours.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.messybeast.com/tricolours.htm</a><br>  <br>  Guess this is a pet peeve of mine, and I'd like to take this opportunity to set the record straight. A calico cat, my feline friends, is a color pattern found on numerous breeds of cats; it is not a breed by itself.<br>  <br>  Basically, a calico cat is a tri-colored cat of black, red(orange), and white. It can also be of a diluted version in blue (gray), cream, and white. Cats with these same colors, but without the white spotting gene, are called tortoiseshells, or torties, and blue-creams, respectively. The white can be in varying degrees. Cats with mostly color, and low amounts of white are sometimes referred to as "tortie and white" instead of calico. Calico cats with mostly a white background and patches of red and black are called "high white" calico cats. If the cat is all white, with only color patches on the head and tail, and no more than one patch on the body, it is a "van" calico cat.<br>  <br>  According to the world's largest cat registry, The Cat Fanciers' Association (CFA), there are actually 16 breeds that come in calico patterns. Amongst these breeds, you can have a large Maine Coon calico, or a Persian with its long flowing coat in calico cat colors, or a Scottish Fold, with it's turned down ears, can be a calico or tortie or blue-cream, in either long or short coats.<br>  <br>  And are all calico cats females? Well, the majority of them are. For very complicated genetic reasons, it takes two X chromosomes for a cat to be a tortoiseshell or calico cat. A male would have to possess two X and one Y chromosomes to be a calico cat. This can happen, but very rarely. According to a study at the College of Veterinary Medicine in Missouri, one out of 3,000 calico colored cats is male. This oddity occurs in humans, too. The males, in both cases, are usually sterile.|`|4aAhEK9daa	"Tuxedo" isn't a breed.  It actually isn't even a cat colour.  It's just a term some give cats that are mostly black with a bit of white on their chests resembling a tuxedo.  The official name for a cat of that colour is simply "Bicolor" Black and White.<br>  <br>  If you're asking which favourite COLOUR then mine would be Tortie since there's so many different variations - Tortie, Tortie and White, Dilute Tortie - and no two cats are alike.<br>  <br>  If you're asking breed - <br>  <br>  Well when I adopted Percy, my Persian, three years ago when he was 2 I quickly fell in love with the breed.  Adorable faces, cute round heads, big fat fluffy paws, so laidback and sweet and yet so playful.  I love how when he runs it's this swish of silky hair going back and forth.  <br>  <a href="http://www.ferretocious.com/cats/chanan/percy-10.jpg" rel="nofollow">http://www.ferretocious.com/cats/chanan/...</a><br>  <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kXOW3Rs0m_4" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kXOW3Rs0m...</a><br>  <br>  Then I adopted four year old Penny a year later from the shelter I volunteer with. She's an Exotic Shorthair with all the personality, sweetness and cute button nose of a Persian but instead of the long Persian coat she's wrapped up in this short, super plush coat.  She truly feels like a super squishy teddy bear.  Always by my side and wakes me every morning with a squeaky "MEH?" and purrs so loud it's a rumble.<br>  <a href="http://www.ferretocious.com/penelope/penelope-ta6.jpg" rel="nofollow">http://www.ferretocious.com/penelope/pen...</a><br>  <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tq-pjB7c4cI" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tq-pjB7c4...</a><br>  <br>  Then I met this beautiful Ragamuffin at the shelter I volunteer with.  Her coat was this crazy patchwork of colours and shaved into a lion cut by an idiotic former owner - who was going to euthanize her because she was peeing on things.  Ends up she'd been abused by the woman's child and it took a couple months for her to trust me.  Now she throws herself at my feet and her glorious coat has grown back in.  A true beauty - she's the #1 Household Pet in the Northwest with TICA and #7 in the world.  I named her Café Mocha Valencia because her coat has all the colours of my favourite coffee drink - the orange mocha.<br>  <a href="http://www.ferretocious.com/mocha/mocha-ta5.jpg" rel="nofollow">http://www.ferretocious.com/mocha/mocha-...</a><br>  <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5UD1CEtbllc" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5UD1CEtbl...</a><br>  <br>  So to answer your question - my favourite breed is what a t-shirt I have says:<br>  <br>  "RESCUED is my favorite breed!"<br>  <br>  There's SO many wonderful adult shelter cats at shelters - of particular breeds like mine and of no particular breed.

They are words used to describe what colors or patters they have in their fur. <br>  <br>  I love bengals because of their appearance and energetic personalities. Here's a picture: <a href="http://www.bengalcats.ca/images/bengal-cat-jumping.jpg" rel="nofollow">http://www.bengalcats.ca/images/bengal-c...</a><br>  <br>  <br>  More info:<br>  A domestic shorthaired cat (DSH) is a cat fancy term used to describe a shorthaired cat that does not have a pedigree or belong to a recognized cat breed. The domestic shorthair should not be confused with the American Shorthair, which is a Cat Fanciers' Association (CFA) recognized breed.<br>  <br>  Domestic shorthaired cats are characterized by a wide range of coloring and typically 'revert to type' after a few generations, which means they express their coats as a tabby. This can be any color or combination of colors. They also exhibit a wide range of physical characteristics and, as a result, domestic shorthaired cats in different countries tend to look different in body shape and size, as they are working from differing gene pools. DSH cats in Asia tend to have a build similar to a purebred Siamese cat or Tonkinese cat, while European and American varieties have a thicker, heavier build.<br>  <br>  <br>  Here's a list of breeds recognized by the Cat Fanciers' Association: Abyssinian, American Bobtail, American Curl, American Shorthair, American Wirehair, Balinese, Birman, Bombay, British Shorthair, Burmese, Chartreux, Colorpoint Shorthair, Cornish Rex, Devon Rex, Egyptian Mau, European Burmese, Exotic, Havana Brown, Japanese Bobtail, Javanese, Korat, LaPerm, Maine Coon, Manx, Norwegian Forest Cat, Ocicat, Oriental, Persian, RagaMuffin, Ragdoll, Russian Blue, Scottish Fold, Selkirk Rex, Siamese, Siberian, Singapura, Somali, Sphynx, Tonkinese, Turkish Angora, Turkish Van. <br>  <br>  Check out this link for the history, personality and physical characteristics of each breed: <a href="http://animal.discovery.com/breedselector/catselectorindex.do" rel="nofollow">http://animal.discovery.com/breedselecto...</a>|`|sayfQB2aaa	tuxedo is not a breed but they are very cute!<br>  Mine are:<br>  1.Ragdoll<br>  2.Singapura<br>  3.Birman<br>  4.Burmese|`|59Rd381caa	I think my favorite is a tabby cat.

Apisf1gAaa	That's actually better than tap water.  You NEED to dechlorinate Hermit Crab's water.  However, before you do it again, you need to look at what dechlorinator you're using in your fish tank.  If it has stress coat or slime coat, then you need to go out and get a new dechlorinator just for your hermit crabs, as these two "coat's" are designed to add slime to a fish's gills, thus helping them to breathe.  But seeing as hermit crabs have modified gills to breathe air, the slime will make it harder for them to breathe.  If you do have slime or stress coat in your dechlorinator, get your hermie's dechlorinator in the fish section--the one's marketed towards hermit crabs are typically horrible and don't do what needs to be done.|`|YAQA9qxCaa	hermit crabs can drink tap and distilled water but distilled is definitly the best|`|LTqIVRTNaa	That's fine it won't hert them,just don't use sink water.|`|8j7h1ayiaa	i dont think itll hurt them|`|RA3p25Qoaa	as long as the product does not add stress or slime coat it's fine to use.

Oddly enough " hermit crab salt" isn't the right stuff you'll need marine salt for salt water fish something like instant ocean. <br>  If you use sponges ditch them they're useless, block natural drinking and bathing not to mention they house bacteria.|`|UBpvtSevaa	Yes actually you use the same stuff to purify thier water.
AXhSdfpyaa	Syrian there sooo friendly i have two (not togather) Although ones ill right now :'( but there again he is 3 years old!!

My hamster was great! Easy to take care of and you can handle them alot with litlle or no problems.

They just make you smile and they love to explore.Having a hamster was a great experience everytime i took him out of the cage everything else that was bothering me seemed to fade away .|`|xarKlp0Oaa	I think you should get a teddy bear hamster because they are so cute and cuddly. I ended up starting with 2 hamsters and ended up with 7 hamster cages. Its wasn't funny then but it is now. My tip to you is 1 hamster is perfect. If you decide to get more than 1 get more cages. Hamsters Rock!|`|cdq7Wvd6aa	Okay, luckily for you i've a had a syrian (a male i think) and i have two dwarfs, both defiantly males and brothers. My first hamster, my syrian, Nev, was the friendliest hamster ever who never bit me, though when he was getting old he nipped a bit. So i don't think that males are necessarily less friendly than females. But syrians do have an appeal factor of being cute, fluffy and friendly.<br>         Dwarf hamsters are very cute too, though you need to get at least two of them because they get lonely and need company. They do bite and are less friendly than syrians, but i think they can be trained. If you go to www.animalloversweb.com it shows you a video of their baby dwarfs, and they have more videos on youtube, and their hamsters are very friendly, so i guess it's down to the handling.<br>         As to which one you should get, it's up to you. Syrians are friendly and if you only want one they are the ones to go for. But if you want you hamster to be a bit smaller and be able to have more than one, you should go for a dwarf, but be prepared to be bitten! But don't judge them on that, because i think they should be given the benefit of the doubt.<br>         Plus, you need to consider accommodation. Syrians are okay in bar cages or compartment ones mad of plastic. Dwarfs will be okay in a plastic compartment cage, mine are, but they are better suited to a glass tank. But don't ever put them in a wire cage because it is very likely that they will be able to squeeze through the bars and excape! They both eat the same stuff, though don't try and feed the dwarfs as much as a syrian, i think that is why mine got so big so quikly! I have found though that my dwarf hamsters love dog biscuits, which are actually good for their teeth to knaw on, and a bit of cooked meat for them every now and then as a tasty treat! But make sure you don't feed your masters human chocolate (u can buy hamster chocolate!!) crisps, salted nuts, onions or citrus fruit, and when you buy their sawdust, do not get cedar or pine because this can be fatal! It gives hamsters breathing problems. Sorry, that was quite long but i hope it helped. If you need more help, feel free to email me!|`|qz9WjNbgaa	Hamsters live only 1-2 years, max. Well usually. I went to the pet store, and I bought a male, long haired teddy bear hamster, and I had him for 4 whole years. I was surprised that he lived so long, but when we bought him, he was a very chocolaty color, and when he passed on he was a very light brown, mostly Grey.

Rw7gi86Naa	Here are some suggestions to your litter box problems:<br>  - Provide a box for each cat <br>  - Provide constant access to a box <br>  - Go back to previously used brand of litter and/or <br>  - Discontinue new disinfectant <br>  - Move box to where it was previously used <br>  - Eliminate new or frightening noise near litter box <br>  - Move food and water away from litter box <br>  - If cat is only going in one spot, put the litter box at the exact location and gradually move it back to where you want it at the rate of one foot per day <br>  - If there are several places, try putting dishes of cat food in those areas to discourage further elimination there <br>  - Experiment with different textures of litter, (cats prefer sandy litter) <br>  - Use a covered litter box for cats that stand in box but eliminate outside of it <br>  - Keep in mind that some cats are rather picky, and prefer to have two separate boxes, (one to pee in and one to poop in).<br>  <br>  Problems arise when your cat doesn't like or develops an aversion to the litter box that you have provided. There is absolutely no reason to expect every cat to like the same material, or even for one cat to prefer the same material over an entire life span. If your cat is having litter box problems then you will need to figure out how to make the litter box appealing to the cat. Here are a few options: <br>  1) Pain or illness can cause a cat to stop using the litter box. Cats are very adept at hiding illness, so if your cat is having litter box problems then the first thing you need to do is take the cat to a vet for a medical exam. <br>  2) If you aren't scooping the waste out of the litter every day then you need to start and start now. <br>  3) Perfumes or other odors can drive your cat away from the litter box. Scented litters are unacceptable to many cats, and the leftover scent from a cleaning product could also be a problem. Get rid of the perfumes, and scrub those cleaners away before giving the box back to the cat. Remember that cats have an acute sense of smell. <br>  4) Your cat may feel vulnerable when in the litter box. Is it in a noisy location, (such as next to the washing machine). Is it secure from little marauders like dogs and children, or even other cats? If the box is not semi-private, move it to a better location.<br>  5) Remember those preferences that we talked about earlier. You may need to offer several different types of litter before finding the right one. Strange but true, some cats will not use the same box for urine and feces, in which case you'll have to provide two boxes. The type of box could also be a problem. If the box has a cover, try removing it. <br>  6) Anxiety can lead to litter box lapses. Did some event scare your cat? This could be anything from a new couch to a new cat or even a new person in the house. If you suspect anxiety, confine the cat to a safe and secure place, (maybe a bed room) until the anxiety has passed. Cats seem to hang on to their emotions, so the anxiety could last much longer than the actual event. No need to rush, leave that safe haven available to the cat for as long as possible. <br>  7) If you have multiple cats, chances are you'll need multiple boxes, maybe even with different materials in them. <br>  There is one more important distinction that you'll need to make. Is the cat refusing to use the litter box, or is the cat spraying? Spraying is a territorial behavior and has nothing to do with disliking the box. For more information on litter box problems or spraying, consult with a trained behaviorist.<br>  <br>  Correcting the Problem <br>  The key to solving elimination problems is to make the litter box more attractive, and the area where the cat is soiling instead, unattractive. Sometimes, just cleaning the litter box more frequently or changing its location will correct the problem. Other times, you may need to experiment with different combinations of location and kitty litter to find a solution. You may even want to offer your cat the choice of several different boxes, each with different kinds of litter, to see which he or she prefers. At the same time, you must break the cat's habit of soiling in the new location. Be sure to clean the soiled area thoroughly with a pet odor remover to get rid of any urine scent -- or your cat may be attracted back to the same spot. It's important to keep the cat away from the area. Try covering the spot with carpet runner, prickly side up, or use a device that delivers a harmless static shock or that produces a loud noise when the cat comes near, to help redirect kitty to his litter box. Adding a room deodorizer with a scent the cat finds offensive - such as a strong citrus or floral - can also keep the cat away from the area. <br>  <br>  When to See the Vet <br>  If your cat continues to eliminate outside of the litter box, a trip to the vet is in order to check for health problems. No behavior techniques will help a cat with a problem that requires the attention of a veterinarian. <br>  Urinary tract infections are a common cause of litter box probl|`|bG3dLab6aa	You should put the litter box where your cat wants to go.<br>  <br>  At first your cat will be very confused.<br>  <br>  If you put it where he wants to go, he will be more comfortable. If you have to move the box several times, you'll just have to do it.<br>  <br>  Now, he may not like the litter. Some cats are picky about the litter (smell, feel, size, etc)<br>  <br>  Do you have any other pets? If you have another cat(s), the other cats might be bullying him.<br>  <br>  Also, he may have worms or parasites. You may need to take him to the vet.|`|Z0odTlyQaa	Some questions to ask yourself:<br>  <br>  Is the house messy? Cats often use the bathroom outside their box if they are unhappy with their surroundings (piles of clothes on the floor, etc)<br>  <br>  Is the litter box in an easy to get to, yet private place?<br>  <br>  Is it the litter? We changed our litter one time and the cat went all over the house, we changed it back and everything went back to normal<br>  <br>  Hope this helps!|`|DQlZIzAFaa	he might not like the scent of the litter you bought, might not feel comfortable there, or it might not be clean enough for him.|`|K119R72Caa	my cat does that too. Is he old?? When cats do that I read they're trying to tell you something is wrong with then.

Neutering has nothing to do with it.
lMYuPrhIaa	The vet will do what is called a fecal. You can bring in your own sample of stool, or they will get a sample.

They would be in his poop   Take a poo sample to your vet this way you don't get charged for the visit just the test  . If he does it on site you'll know in a day. There are different types I had a pup before who was born with them they came out and looked like spaghetti extremely gross!!|`|GSf09ALBaa	What you are describing sounds more like he needs a better quality of food.  <br>  <br>  There is a chance he does have worms.  The best thing you can do is take a fresh fecal sample into your vet.  Often, they will run it for you without seeing the dog.  That way you will know for sure if this voracious appetite has anything to do with worms.|`|Um8osMNuaa	Signs your dog has worms are dragging his bottom along the floor, scratching and nibbling at his bottom, any worms or eggs in the poo, small white flecks around his anus that resemble grains of rice are tapeworm eggs. Loss of weight, as the worms take all the nutrients out of the food.<br>  Some dogs are greedy, so increased appetite isn't always an indication of worms, although if the dog is also losing weight, then it is.<br>  The vet can test a poo sample for worms, this way they can determine if the dog has worms and also what type.<br>  l very much doubt your dog got the worms at the vets. They can be easily picked up from coming into contact with poo that contains eggs, contact with a dog that has worms, worm eggs can also lay dormant on the ground for up to one year and can infect your dog upon contact. They get tapeworms from fleas, so if your dog has fleas he will ingest them while grooming and will have adult tape worm hatch in his intestines.<br>  lt's simple to treat, worming tablets from the vet will kill all the worms, then regular worming will keep your dog protected if he comes into contact with them again.<br>  <br>  Eating poo isn't a sign of worms.<br>  lt can be a sign that your dogs food is lacking essentail nutrients, a change in diet can help.<br>  lt's also done because they like it, you need to call him away from any poo and offer him a treat instead, this worked with my puppy.<br>  <br>  l worm all three of my dogs every 3 months to make sure they are protected from worms.
47juxg0Yaa	I wrote an essay/project about keeping Guinea pigs, which included <br>  <br>  - Various cages/equipment and prices<br>  - How to care for Guinea Pigs (How often clean out etc.)<br>  - A list of suitable nearby breeders.<br>  - A solid promise that you are responsible enough to care for it. <br>  <br>  If your mum has a problem with you going away and leaving it ask a neighbour or friend if they could offer to look after a Guinea pig for a week if the time arises. If not there are small animal kennels.<br>  <br>  Also if you have an exam or something similar coming up, then make a deal with your Mum that if you achieve a certain grade, you can have a Guinea Pig. Tell her what a good incentive this will be. If your birthday is coming up the same thing can be done.<br>  <br>  Finally, rant on about it for a long time. If you whine a lot now then forget about it, she will probably definatly not get you one. If you continue to beg and plead or to bring it into conversation, she will remember it when the next special occasion arises!<br>  <br>  Good luck, and if you do get one, please dont get it from a pet shop.|`|6Btmg7Tcaa	Firstly guinea pigs should be kept in pairs, so you should get two not one. <br>  Secondly I'm with your Mum on this one. You have a dog, be grateful for that, I grew up with no pets at all, i wasn't even allowed to have a fish! When I got my own place the first thing I did was get a dog, oh boy was that a shock to the system. <br>  vets bills? ridiculous. If something happens to your guinea pig are you prepared to pay the bill? Probably not, hence why Mum wont let you have one or two, she'd be the one pikcing up the tab.<br>  Food. Again are you paying? They have to eat y'know.<br>  Housing. Are you paying for a good hutch and run for the garden? They have to be sturdy because a guinea pig will chew anything. They dont come cheap. <br>  And then you do have the holiday issue. Every year my husband and I would argue about where our dog would go, I wouldn't put her in kennels and never did. But what would you do with your guinea pig? can you afford to pay someone to care for him/her?<br>  And then theres the issue of when they die. do you have any idea of the grief it causes when a pet dies? When I lost my dog two years ago it nearly killed me, and to this day I still feel the pain of her loss. I will never EVER have another pet for that reason.<br>  <br>  You madam have no idea what its like to have an animal of your own. They cost a fortune, not good in todays society, they cause no end of problems and if your Mum says no, be grateful for your dog, hug him, play with him and enjoy him, because its going to kill you when he dies.

And I mean a HUGE pond, roughly 1000 gallons, 1500 would be better. <br>  <br>  Since it is just around the corner from spring I'd say if you get started on your pond and aquascaping [this is all assuming you are in a non-freezing climate] it now it would be ready in a few months for those fish. <br>  <br>  You might consider putting half of them up for adoption, but please don't release them into the wild. Only a domesticated pond is safe for them.|`|h4wNRqf9aa	they dont stay babies<br>  <br>  <br>  1500 gallons is not a HUGE pond, but it's a good start<br>  single tail goldfish are pond fish for a reason|`|DU7iO8EHaa	It will fit fine.

DHsZSU3vaa	First you need to have a heater in your tank at all times to about 78 degrees (depends on your fish). If your draining the tank when your cleaning remember to unplug the heater if your draining more water then the size of your heater (It will burn out).Next put fish in a clean bowl or bucket with there own tank water. Next add clean water and plug heater back on wait till heater reaches a good temp and add fish.|`|a47cAPypaa	Boil a kettle & mix with the cold water to achieve the required temperature.|`|3bf821ff353c216ffc93ff7a91b60828aa	Just move the lever on the tap water to warm.|`|r4Ggo4jJaa	huh? use the hot and cold knobs on your faucet.|`|bDPVRtCNaa	Many people pour hot water into their buckets and wait until the temperature lowers to match their tank. <br>  <br>  I use a drip system.

ld2vmypNaa	pretty much what Kame says.<br>  <br>  'Austinsturtlepage.com'  for all info and care on all turtles!!!<br>  <br>  They need clean water or they will get sick.

That's why it's important to keep that water clean! Feeding her in a separate bowl will help to keep it cleaner. Leave her in the feeding bowl for an hour and she'll likely poop in it (meaning less poop in the tank). Lie feede minnows and greens are OK to put into the tank though. Also the filter should be rated for 2 to 3 times the water she's in. So if you have her in a 10 gallon tank, for example, the filter needs to be rated for at least 20 gallons or it will not clean good enough.|`|LTqIVRTNaa	Yep alittle gross but yes they do,but you don't catch them doing it everyday.|`|9O5Y1Kavaa	yeah pretty much

CIxnKFQwaa	you can keep the puppies in a fence that is inside and the lab out of the fence thing that what i do|`|vDWHHuGkaa	Does your lab know any commands, like "leave it"?  I would use basic commands.  Also, I would give the lab a firm verbal correction, saying "no" and block the behavior with my body, placing myself between the lab and the pups he is barking at.  Wait until the lab is submissive, calm, and backs off before you change your position.  Make sure your lab knows that this behavior is unwanted.  Once your lab has calmed down, distract him/her with treats.  Reward the lab for quit calm behavior around the puppies and make a connection of "when the puppies are near I get a treat."  This should tell the lab that the puppies are rewarding to be around.  Work your way up to the puppies being rewarding.  Do not get frustrated, try your best to stay calm.  <br>  <br>  Good Luck :)|`|nBehRANyaa	You shouldn't be giving away puppies until they are at least 8-10 weeks old.  Also, they should be kept separated from other dogs until they are a bit older.|`|PM23RDycaa	Please tell me I am not reading this right and that you have already given away TWO four week old puppies already.

He shouldn't have been around the pups at this point to begin with.<br>  <br>  Keep them separated until they are older. By then he may have calmed down to accept them. And if you intend to have FOUR dogs you need to check your local laws to see if that is in fact legal. Most places have limits on the number of animals you can have in your household.<br>  <br>  ADD: And I hope you know how LUCKY you are that your five yr old dog safely delivered that many puppies. Have her spayed she is officially too old to be breeding.|`|746YLjISaa	First you need to have your yorkie spayed so she dosent have anymore puppies. Then you need to give 6 ot the 7 puppies away,, then you need to introduce the puppy you decide to keep to your lab like this: take the dogs to a wide open field with not very many distractons and you can walk your lab and your mom can walk the pup, then have your mom go to one end of the feild and you to the other, and slowly walk towards each other and if your lab barks or starts growling and the pup turn aroud and go the other way then after about 7 steps turn around and kepp going towards the pup, if succussful you lab will eventually stop barking and you be able to get close enough for them to sniff each other and properly be introduced. After this take them home and take them outside with each other ON LEASHES and do the same thing, then move inside your house with the exercise and eventually the dogs will tolerate each other. This will take alot of patience, dont get frustrated, your dog can sence it. Good Luck!

hC4Z8HIbaa	You will either want to buy a Ferret Nation or Critter Nation. They can be a little expensive, but they are huge (a double unit cage can hold up to 12 rats) and they both come with 4 full doors that open like cabinet doors, giving you full access to the inside of the cage. The only difference with the FN and CN is that the CN has 1/2" bar spacing while the FN has 1" bar spacing. Because the CN has more bars, it uses more metal and is therefore a bit more expensive than the FN. I definetly recommend either of these cages to rat owners. They are by far the most easy rat cages to clean.<br>  <br>  Edit to comment on things that have been mentioned: I currently have my rats in a Ferret Nation, and none my rats have ever escaped. Generally the rule of thumb is that if the rat can fit its head thru, it can get the rest of its body thru. Both of my boys are too big to get their head thru the bars of the FN and other ferret cages I have kept them in. This is not the case for all rats, however. The makers of the FN decided to come out with the CN because of the popularity of the FN in the rat community, but a slight disappointment in the fact that the cage could not house babies or small females. If you are unsure of the size of the rats you may be getting, get the CN. If you already know that you have or will be getting rather large or fat rats, the FN should be fine.|`|PUbR3tHKaa	Critter Nation, and those links are already posted, or any of the martins cages.  I do not like any cages with plastic shelving.  They get stinky really quickly!  Ferret cages have openings too large for ratties, they can escape and run around.  The R680 by martins cages is really nice.  Link posted below.  :0) The cage just lifts up, the tray below is easy to empty and clean, and then you can clean the body of the cage every week or so.|`|pk8Oemycaa	Never get a farret cage for a rat.

Please don't support these irresponsible breeders by lining their pockets with your money. If you want a mixed breed/mutt look no further than your local shelter. Instead of getting scammed, you can adopt a mix (possibly even the type you were looking for!) for far cheaper... and save a life doing so.<br>  <br>  Read:<br>  <a href="http://home.comcast.net/~NoPuppyMillsVA/Poo-dogs___Designer_Mutts/poo-dogs___designer_mutts.html" rel="nofollow">http://home.comcast.net/~NoPuppyMillsVA/...</a> (Poo-dogs & Designer Mutts)<br>  <a href="http://www.showdog-magazine.com/Articles/DesignerMutts.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.showdog-magazine.com/Articles...</a> (Designer Mutts)<br>  <br>  <br>  Darksong~|`|f66ce5d864eadcad29348fd4a9871771aa	a "whoodle" is a mutt..... theres thousands of them in the pounds.|`|PM23RDycaa	No its NOT a cute name.

9kceDOTraa	Depends on tank size really.  You must take into account that Jardini by comparison to South American Arowana are much higher aggressive, and generally do not dwell up in the tank like their South American relatives.  I've been keeping a Malaysian Golden Jardini in my 180 with my Africans for over a year now and I have to say he tends to bully my larger Haps from time to time.  Being Africans though, they don't take it for a long time and bite back, and he appears to get the message.  <br>  <br>  Now you take a big slow moving South American cichlid like that Parrot, odds are, the Jardini is going to bully that one around and the Parrot will be at a bad disadvantage to defend itself, and will either A end up dead by stress, or B take to the lower part of the tank and with cover and life a rather sheltered miserable life.|`|h4wNRqf9aa	"king kong parrot" as in blood parrot cichlid?<br>  <br>  <br>  the aro would quickly kill the parrot|`|25CAIGfeaa	yea but u need a huge tank!

65baadde1a27b20964ccb07ad83092e0aa	Your fish should be ok with the temp at 80 no higher.  Anyways parasites are tricky they can take a long time to get rid of all of them.  I have treated ich in my tank but it took 16 days to fully rid the tank of the ich.  <br>  <br>  You need to treat for the full 14 -17 days doing water changes before you does the fish with treatment will help too.  The more water changes the more parasites you are getting up of the water lowering your load.  I personally like to use coppersafe for parasites. Coppersafe works on all external parasites even fluke. If you use this stuff it is a good idea to get a copper test kit to make sure you do not over dose. <br>  <br>  Keep treating them do more water changes make sure to clean the gravel. Ich is easy to cure but can take a few tries  or even a month to get rid of fully in a large tank with many fish. If you have a small tank with only one fish you can knock ich out in a week.  other wise it takes more time.|`|3bf821ff353c216ffc93ff7a91b60828aa	Ich is brought on by stress.  Since you re-started your tank about a month ago(?), and had broken it down and cleaned it, your tank is going through a new cycle process.  Poor water quality, which occurs during the cycle, causes stress on the fish.  Breaking down your tank again, and recleaning it will not help.  It will only make everything worse, because your tank will go through and restart another cycle process.  See link for info on that if you're not familiar with it:<br>  <br>  <a href="http://freshaquarium.about.com/cs/biologicalcycle/a/nitrogencycle.htm" rel="nofollow">http://freshaquarium.about.com/cs/biolog...</a><br>  <br>  Also, it's a good idea to treat for ich for about 21 days to be sure the parasite is killed off.  Or, for at least 4 or 5 days after the last spot is seen on the fish.  Drop your water level down about 1/2-1 inch below the filter output.  Then raise your temp back up to about 82-84°F.  Dropping the water level will increase the surface agitation in the tank, allowing more oxygen into the water.  Or, you could add an air stone, just have it close to the surface so it agitates the water surface.  <br>  <br>  My suggestion would be to monitor your ammonia and nitrite levels and make sure they're at 0 ppm, nitrates under 20 ppm.  If not, then daily water changes until the tank finishes cycling and they get to those levels.|`|25CAIGfeaa	wait for 2 weeks. i will take a while. keep up what ur doing

It would probably free up some space in the room you keep them in. Or, you could buy another female that seems to be shy, too, so they get along. I wouldn't suggest putting a rather aggressive leopard gecko in with her, or one that's bigger. They would probably compete for the food, and the bigger one would win. I guess if you hand-fed the shyer one, it would be okay to put in another, slightly more aggressive female in with her.|`|LJ9hyvg2aa	Dont house two leos together if they are more than 10 grams form each others weight.

Pits genetic makeup lets them tolerate pain far longer than most any other breed of dog.  This is crucial in the sense of using them as fighting dogs but can be very distressing when they get hurt as our human loving pets.  They rarely react to pain in the way of whining etc.  <br>  <br>  My Pit fell in a hole and was limping on her leg for 2 days.  Then she was fine.  I also almost suffocated her once.  The back window of my truck was half down, she was in the back seat, I rolled it up not checking where she was, caught her neck, she defecated, scared the hell out of me and never screamed.  She also has fallen flat on her head on the concrete.  Not a sound.  Gets up like it never happened.<br>  <br>  Worries the heck out of me.<br>  <br>  So, keep that in mind.

They run so hard sometimes, they often get common sprains in the back legs from turning and sheer force. They will run on all fours but when they walk or trot they will lift and walk on three. Unless your pit starts to really get bad, I would hold off on the vet because usually your dog will not let the vet stretch the leg out and when they take x-rays they are usually negative ( based on the symptoms you stated ). The only thing I could do was start stop playing fetch with her (which she hates stopping) and let it heal naturally. A couple of times she whined to play again and I gave in and the sprain came back a couple of times. I would just let your Pit rest as much as possible until you see the limp fully go away. Best of luck!

Now I'm sure the vet gave you a low residue food to help "settle" his stomach, which that is all it will do, and you're right Hill's is very expensive food yet it's crap also, as it too is full of corn, wheat, soy and filler foods that really don't do your dog any good either, even though the diarrhea stopped as it did with my dog.<br>  <br>  If you have a sensitive stomach dog I highly recommend Pinnacle Trout and Sweet Potato or Duck and Potato.  This was the only food that my Weimaraner did great on.  She also has a sensitive stomach getting gastroenteritis a lot even on certain "so called" good quality foods.  Pinnacle she got no diarrhea, and she did great on it.  Pinnacle is 100% allergen and grain free.  It's the only food aside from the Low Residue food that really stopped her diarrhea.<br>  <br>  Also a couple of scoops of 100% pure canned pumpkin will help clear up the diarrhea.<br>  <br>  Make sure you aren't feeding him human foods as that won't help him at all, also check the "treats" your giving sometimes it's not the dog food but the treats themselves.<br>  <br>  My dog ended up in the vets over a chicken fillet treat didn't agree with her at all.<br>  <br>  Good luck|`|746YLjISaa	He might be allergic to the gluten in the food, the Hills probably dosent have gluten, if it dosent find a food without gluten and change him to it, if he stops having diarrhea you have found the problem. If it does have gluten ask your vet to do allergie test on him and it may find the culpret. Good Luck!|`|WYItM0YTaa	We feed our puppy Blue Buffalo|`|Fvuq2Nwiaa	My god my puppy had nearly the same thing! He is 5 and 1/2 month old and has had chronic loose stools (forming cow pies) to a few severe spouts of diarrhea, squirting. He was tested for worms, giardia, cociadia, all negative.<br>  They thought it may be a bacterial infection so they treated that. As soon as he was off the antibiotics (which firm the stool) it started up again. She did not want to even test for IBS or pancreitis.She said if he had these he would NOT feel well and he is very energetic, play full and happy.  I tried prebiots, probiotics nothing worked ecept for adding ALLOT of pumpkin pure to his food which is full of fiber.  Until someone suggested here on YA! that her friends live by Nutramin living clay. It is a calcium montmorillonite clay.  It is high in essential macro, micro and trace mineral elements. It actually detoxifies their system, helps their gums and teeth, strengthens bones and joints, aids digestion and metablism, helps the immune system. I started doing research on this and it is amazing. They actually give it to astronauts while they are in space to prevent bone loss. <br>  My Pete has been on it for 3 days and his stools look great. FINALLY!!! <br>  It has been on the earth for millions of years and is GREAT for humans too. The human brand is called Terramin. The only difference is the size of the granules. Which are tasteless. I just sprinkle it over the top of my boy's dry dog food kibble.<br>  I knew it was not his food because he has always been on high quality food. Tried California Natural and Eagle Pack Holistic. Had tried 2 different ones with no success. But as soon as I started him on this WOOM so much better.<br>  <br>  If it sounds interesting to you their website is www.calearthminerals.com and more information on the benefites for dogs AND humans google montmorillonite clay.<br>  <br>  You still want to have him on a good quality dog food. I have my pup now on Dick Van Pattens Natural Balance.<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  Good luck :-)|`|vDWHHuGkaa	Our dog has a super sensitive stomach.  When he gets diarrhea we feed him boiled chicken and rice.  I saw someone else mention the diet of chicken and rice.  I highly recommend that you do that until your dog has a firm stool.  Then begin slowly mixing the chicken and rice with your dog food for a couple of days increasing the dog food to chicken mixture ratio each day.  We have a lab shepherd mix and our vet told us to feed him large breed pet food.  Tons of people say negative things about Purina, but we like it.  He eats Purina's Pro Plan for Large Breeds.  Our vet calls it the "best of the worst," but we feel safe with Purina after all the dog food scares out there.
K0HlQFobaa	Both make fabulous companions!<br>  Anyway, all the labs I've ever met are energy bombs (which may be a good or bad thing), and they're generally easy to please and quite friendly.<br>  Golden retrievers are less sprightly and more mellow, but tend to get arthritis later (and a LOT of it). They've also got plenty of hair and might need a brushing or bath more often, but it might be worth it since they're probably less likely to chew all your stuff up than a lab. <br>  Otherwise, consider a shelter mutt! There are SO MANY in need of loving homes, and they're WAY less likely to have health problems than purebreds. Maybe you can find a lab-retriever mix (ha ha!).|`|nlWJS5qWaa	either one is a great choice. Im a avid lab lover and if i didnt have labs I would have a golden retriever. I think they are pretty much the same. they are both very loving and compassionate. as for destructive thats not a question of breed but of age.    :)<br>  but most of all you need to have 2 dogs that feel like family. let your german shepard help pick out the new member of the family. introduce your dog to perspective pups and see how they get along.  good luck!!|`|VVA3nDTtaa	I have a lab retriever mix and she's always playful and has a lot of energy.<br>  <br>  Both have a lot of energy and both are friendly but a retriever is more friendly but not much.|`|aU2yDd8qaa	My lab puppy is a mischievous little bugger but I love him to bits.<br>  <br>  Labs and golden retrievers share a lot of qualities, but I think you'd be best off with a golden retriever.|`|MrWTixSLaa	i have had two labs...it seems that we always have to have one in the house...i love them and they are really sweet...very friendly....go with the lab...they are great dogs you cant go wrong with one...good luck choosing...im sure that they are both good choicess<br>  <br>  btw...golden retrivers have lots of fur and shed more<br>          labs have hip problems|`|ojwxqO3Jaa	you are always able to train a dog your self,but a golden retriever is less distructive and the lab has more energy <br>  me , i would choose the lab and any dog can get along with others it depends what type of additude it has|`|vkLD7EjUaa	Retriever!!

Factors significantly associated with an increased risk of GDV were increasing age, having a first-degree relative with a history of GDV, having a faster speed of eating, and having a raised feeding bowl. Approximately 20 and 52% of cases of GDV among the large breed and giant breed dogs, respectively, were attributed to having a raised feed bowl.

7hmG9Xu8aa	Los perros marcan su territorio eso se sabe....<br>  Puede ser una etapa hormonal la razón de su comportamiento. Igual te doy unos trukitos:<br>  <br>  1. Trata de sacarlo lo más ke puedas o si no de rutina y ke se habitue.<br>  <br>  2. Hay productos en el mercado parecidos a un perfume, esos lo rocias en una parte donde kieres ke el haga sus necesidades (Preferiblemente en un periodico) para ke se habitue a hacerlo hay y no en toda la casa. Entonces, vas a ponerlo a oler ahí y se?alale ke ahi es donde lo debe hacer.<br>  <br>  3. Si hace bien lo anterior festejaselo dale algun premio (galletas o algo).<br>  <br>  4. Cada vez que lo haga donde no lo debe hacer rega?alo, que es se de cuenta ke lo ke hizo estuvo mal. Dejalo amarrado con su correa en su casa o algún sitio, dejalo encerrado en una habitación... o algo con tal ke vea ke ese es su castigo. Habla con tus hijos y tus familiares ke en el periodo ke este casigado no lo consientan, pues el creera ke lo ke hizo estuvo bien.<br>  <br>  5. Esto ultimo podria ser tambien una razon, talvez cuando el hace algo malo, le hablan de una manera, suve, lo consienten o simplemente no le hacen ver ke estuvo mal. No digo tampoko ke le hablen de una manera ke lo ponga super nerviosos, sabiendose ke esa raza es nerviosa por naturaleza.<br>  <br>  6. Si nada de lo anterior te funciona, busca a un experto, ya sea un entrenador o a el veterinario para ver si es algo hormonal que lo esté afectando y ke el te diga ke debes hacer...<br>  <br>  Espero ke te sirva... Suerte! :D|`|SDHvDNGJaa	Los perros suelen marcar su territorio. Seguramente está en una etapa hormonal activa. Por eso se comporta así.

Espero te sirva de ayuda.<br>  <br>  Cuando estás presente, al despertarse o luego de comer, tu perrita olfateará el piso o dará vueltas en círculos.<br>  <br>  En ese momento, llévala encima de un papel periódico y cuando haga sus necesidades, prémiala.<br>  <br>  Cuando lo haga en otro lugar, simplemente repriéndela con rotundo "no" con voz grave y llévala encima del periódico. Limpia bien toda la zona en donde orinó o defecó ya que tienen olfato más potente y si lo huelen lo volverán a hacer. En la veterinaria encontrarás elimina olores para perros. los trapos que uses colócalos en su ba?o, para que los use.<br>  <br>  Cuando tu te vayas por unas pocas horas, dejala en una jaula lo suficientemente grande como para que se acueste, se siente o se pare, pero no tan grande como para que orine en un lado y duerma en el otro.<br>  <br>  Cuando vuelvas, llévala a su ba?o y prémiala si hace sus necesidades.<br>  <br>  El ba?o debe estar relativamente alejado del lugar que come y duerme, porque los perros son bastante limpios y no ensucian el lugar donde viven.<br>  <br>  Lo mejor es que cuando esté vacunado, en vez de llevarlo a los periódicos, lo lleves afuera, porque si se acostumbra demasiado, terminará usando como ba?o todos los periódicos de la casa.<br>  <br>  Recuerda que si defeca en la calle, colabora para tener una ciudad más limpia recogiendo la bostita de tu perrita. Actualmente en veterinarias hay muchas palas especiales para esto de forma que no te dé tanto asco.<br>  <br>  Consejito: No debes reprender a tu cachorrita con violencia, como por ejemplo pegarle con un diario, o refregarle el hocico en sus heces, pues te tendrá miedo y no querrá acercarse a tí, sino que es probable que huya. Simplemente cuando haga algo incorrecto debes decirle (no gritarle) "no" con voz firme, seria y grave.

entiendo porque a mi me pasava lo mismo lamentablemente con pegarles no se gana nada aciendoles torturas como las que mencionan aqui no para nada tampoco esta situacion es normal para ellos ya que pertenecen a si instinto natural de perros ,yo me arreglo de esta manera practica para que nadie este sufriendo en la casa tengo un jaulon de perro si no tenes compralo de acuerdo a la medida de tu perro ese va a ser su cuarto de ahora en mas buscale un lugar de la casa que sea bien y no moleste para este paso siguiente yo por ej tengo una puerta ventana que da al patio trasero de mi casa pone tu perrito aqui en la noche para que duerma si nunca estubo en un lugar serrado puede ser que no le guste las primeras noches pero si yora asercate sin sacarlo y hablale con autoridad y decile ahi te vas a quedar hasta maniana que nos levantemos ok al dia siguiente despues de tomar tu desayuno sacalo y dale tambien el de el, cuando termina si no lo podes sacar a dar su paseo de la maniana pone su jaula en el patio con la puertita avierta si tenes el ventanal y no hay peligros por donde tu vives pone la jaula con la puertita asia fuera y todo lo demas que quede por dentro de la casa entendes corre la ventana como para que le quede justo a la jaula bueno dejale su agua no mucha asi no carga tanto liquido inesesario en el patio cuando lleges en la tarde saludalo ofresele un snack no se si dispondras de algo que le sirva para esta merienda hay muchas clases en las tiendas para animalitos entonses mientras el se entretiene descansas un poco luego lo sacas a dar su paseo que se de el gusto de aser pipi a todo la cuadra de tu casa y no te olvides de llevar una bolcitas que no estamos en navidad para dejar regalitos jee cuando entren a la casa dale el gusto de andar un rato por dentro si no te molesta con los chicos a los cuales tambien le tenes que enseniar las nuevas reglas para que aprendan a coperar luego  de 30 a  40 min esta bien no le des tiempo a que se aburra y ande buscando sus rastros luego como ya es la noche pones su jaula dentro le das agua pero no mucha y si le queres dar cena se la podes dar pero moderado y lo guardas en su jaula hasta el otro dia los dias de lluvia no lo dejes en el patio ellos se asustan mucho de los truenos porque les repercute en el timpano demaciado fuerte dale de comer sacalo a aser pipi un ratito como para que heche dos o tres meaditas y lo guardas hasta que regresan le hablan y le disen quedate aqui tranquilo hoy no te quedas en el patio porque esta lloviendo y no quiero que te enfermes quisas el primer dia el este desconsertado pero veras que pronto se acostumbra a sus nuevas reglas y como el solito va a dejar ponerse su collar y cadena para los paseos de la tarde y solito se va a gurdar en su jaula cuando menos pienses .esto lo hemplee yo con mi perrito el cual vino con tres anios a vivir con nosotros y fue la unica manera de que pudimos convivir en paz todos incluido el  y no fue nesesario castrarlo para que minimizara esta situacion no dudes en hablarle a tu perro que todos en la casa se acostumbren a aserlo mas si las reglas van a cambiar de ahora en mas ellos no hablan pero entienden y asumen muy bien cuando una regla es pareja tanto para el duenio como para ellos y ya no luches contra su instinto que no vas a ganar nada  ok chau espero te sirva  solo poniendo esto en practica de ahora en mas es como solito veras los buenos resultados  , lamentablemente si vives en apto quisas no tengas un  patio pues tendras que enseniarle que se quede dentro de su jaula con su aguita esta mas poquita que si estuviera en un patio porque no aria mucho desgaste ficico y el jaulon tendrias que comprarselo mas grande a su medida para que pueda moverse un poco y dejalo frente a la tele encendida asi al

unica solucion es que cuando lo haga lo castigues de alguna manera ejemplo: dejarlo en el patio un rato sin entrar.  ?a orinado dentro desde que lo tienen? si la respuesta en no haz lo que te dije  <br>   (castigarlo) por que de seguro que es algo hormonal y  se le pasara, si la respuesta es si castigalo tambien y si no te funciona la unica opcion es dejarlo afuera y que tus hijos jueguen con el

XmHEYD9Waa	Outlook doesn't look good as parvo is an extremely aggressive virus that can last up to two weeks in your dog without aggressive medication.  You'll want to consult with your vet.  Simply state that hospitalization is not an option and you'd like to rehab him at home.  They should be able to give you some help and ideas.  Also there are non-profit agencies like the ASPCA and the like who could provide some aide, but with parvo, he could be gone tomorrow, so time is crucial.<br>  <br>  If you choose to go the route alone, keep the dog warm in one area of your house, as it's extremely contagious and you don't want any other unvaccinated animals in your house to come in contact with him.  Always wash with bleach (or use gloves) after coming in contact with him or anything he's touched.<br>  <br>  Also, parvo causes extreme vomitting and diahrrea, so keeping him hydrated with lots of fluids is essential to helping his body fight the virus.  I knew someone who kept their dog alive for two weeks on pedialite and protein shakes.  You'll need to administer with a syringe if he's too far along to eat on his own.  <br>  <br>  Even with expensive veterinary treatment, parvo is major stuff and not all animals pull through. If it's an adult dog, the chances are better than if it's a puppy.|`|Sh6u3qfAaa	Talk to the Vet, the SPCA, and the Humane Society. Sometimes there are organizations that will help pay for treatment.|`|AA11825964	You can call your local humane society and they will help! No money needed.|`|11f52b5555601bd3cbe45afd1ebee97daa	Your pet should be seen right away. Parvo can kill, not just your dog but other dogs. If a Parvo puppy gets in contact with a healthy puppy, the Parvo virus can be transmitted to the healthy puppy. I work in a vet. practice and Parvo cases are kept in isolation for normally a week but each case is different. If you can not afford to help your puppy you need to bring him/her into your local a.s.p.c.a. You should call local vets and see if any are willing to help you make payment arrangements. If you have a local vet hospital with an emergency room you should take him/her there to at least get some fluids. A vet really needs to see your pet, no home care will work. Your pet needs medical attention. Good Luck to you and your puppy. I hope everything works out.|`|9e8847baf678615e443237bc1ee116b5aa	You should consider giving your dog to the SPCA. They will take care of the dog and find it a good home that will be able to financially care for the dog and give it what you cannot provide.<br>  Don't be selfish and keep your puppy simply because you don't want to give him up. He needs to be treated for the Parvo, he could die from the illness and it's a long road to recovery.<br>  Dogs are like children, they are expensive and need regular care and medical attention which can be very costly. If you are unable to afford the Parvo treatment now, what will you do if your dog gets hit by a car or develops a disease?|`|gDlRf6Jvaa	you can try going to the a.s.p.c.a they might be able to help you. Or you can also go to a local vet and ask if you can make payment arrangements with them. My rottweiller died of Parvo 10 years ago, so I know exactly what you are going through. For future references they now carry a vaccine for the Parvo disease. If you can't afford a vet for the shot you can go to petmeds.com and order them cheap and administer them yourself or even ebay has them. But for now good luck and hurry up to a vet it is very fatal.|`|52f629a2511efd682b377f3c51e77360aa	The vet will help you treat at home.|`|gGFzAb56aa	Call around try to get the money. call animal shelters and aspca<br>  <br>  How old is your dog? how much does it weight?<br>  <br>  You have to try to keep fluids down him. Use pedalight, gatera, or broth. <br>  <br>  You have to try to get the thoughing up to stop! Try some pepto, BUT you have to know how much he weighs, old,because you do not want to make it worse. <br>  <br>  You have to keep him warm, and in a quit place. So  if he does go into shock he will not suffer as bad.<br>  <br>  There is really no way of treating this at home, he needs meds for through up, he need fluids, he have to be on antibiotics to prevent a 2 infection.  There is also something you can give them that keeps the virus form spreading to bad, only if you get it in time. "before he gets to the point he can not keep anything down"<br>  <br>  He will DIE if you do not get any help for him. Also Parvo lives a long time in your house and in your  yard! 6months to a year. They say Bleach will kill it, but we had it and used bleach and it did  not kill it!
hIyjdXr9aa	To answer your direct question, a good website to buy fish supplies from is <a href="http://petguys.com/fish-stuff.html" rel="nofollow">http://petguys.com/fish-stuff.html</a>  Their salt mixes are cheaper sold than any of my local fish stores, and they sell all the little extra things you'll need for the aquarium, like heaters and medicines and decorations etc.  <br>  <br>  To answer your indirect question, You might want to reconsider the five gallon tank size.  Sea horses are delicate, and it's easier to maintain stable aquarium levels with a larger tank.  The website I link to below says that a twenty gallon tank with live rock in it has worked better for them and not only do their seahorses stay alive, they also breed. <br>  <br>  Here is the website.  It talks about dwarf seahorse keeping and all of the supplies you will need to buy to successfully keep them. For some of the products, it even links you to the page where you can buy them cheapest.  <a href="http://home.pacbell.net/powerfx/html/setupdetail.htm" rel="nofollow">http://home.pacbell.net/powerfx/html/set...</a>   There are a lot of good pictures on that website, too. :)  Good luck with your seahorses and don't forget to cycle your tank before you put them in.<br>  <br>  Update:  After doing more research, I encountered a website that encourages you to keep your seahorses in smaller containers, not large ones.  Website:  <a href="http://www.syngnathid.org/articles/dwarfKeeping.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.syngnathid.org/articles/dwarf...</a>  I think that this person is genuinely trying to help you with this advice, but that the first website I listed was better because in my own experience larger less stocked tanks are stabler than smaller overstocked tanks.  This is the person from the first website's reasoning for using a twenty gallon tank instead of a small bowl:  <br>  <br>  "I  also added larger Cell-Pore sculpted rocks to the main tank for added bacteria colonies.  This is almost over-kill for the 20-gallon tank but it will definitely be very stable with the included power head for proper water circulation..  Currently, I am preparing to lace the 20 gallon tank with some Amphipods (Grammarus) and algae from my six gallon.  Hopefully, the tank will fill up with algae and Amphipods (Grammarus), which will provide a natural live food source for my horses.  I think the trick to my method will be in keeping the Amphipods (Grammarus) one step ahead of the horses.  That is why I am using such a large tank for dwarf horses.  My theory is that if I place a reasonable number of horses in the tank (6-8) then they won't be able to eat the Amphipods (Grammarus) down.  The tank is so large that the Amphipods (Grammarus) will be able to reproduce and fill the tank at a rate that will allow constant grazing for the horses.  If this works out well then only an occasional treat of brine shrimp will be required.  I will also keep my six-gallon working as it is now - for the Amphipods (Grammarus) in case I need more for the horses.<br>  <br>     I know many people recommend small tanks for the dwarfs for fear that their food will dissipate in the tank and be hard to find for the dwarfs.  I think this only applies when the tank is relatively empty of food and then the food is added a couple of times throughout the day.  Then it stands to reasons that the food would dissipate throughout the tank.  But in nature the horses are constantly grazing the grass beds looking for the small creatures that live within the green algae leaves.  I am trying to recreate this and hopefully the amount of Amphipods (Grammarus) will be large enough to provide the desired effect.  Also, I must mention that I am planning to feed the Amphipods (Grammarus) daily with an invertebrate particle liquid mix.  I will squirt a small amount in the tank every day.  With the six gallon I used yeast, and fish fry liquid food with great success so I think the only think that is important is to feed the Amphipods (Grammarus) with health food so that the horses will get the nutrients second hand."|`|KnypnLfxaa	I got mine at petsmart for $30.00.<br>  Good deal.|`|zzaN4wG3aa	There is a list of online stores here: <a href="http://www.aquariu.ms/onlinestores" rel="nofollow">http://www.aquariu.ms/onlinestores</a><br>   I have found big al's generally has the best prices.
yTdQUqVRaa	Those tanks are really too small for a betta to be completely happy and healthy. They need at least 2.5 gallons.<br>  <br>  Flaring occasionally can be fine. Flaring constantly can lead to stress. I'd imagine in that tiny tank, they'd flare constantly.<br>  <br>  I have two male bettas in a divided 10 gallon tank with a perforated divider that has lots of plants on each side of the divider to minimize their view of each other. I've also tried a 5 gallon divided tank with great success, so dividing can work so long as you try and minimize the stress factor for each fish.|`|CuGT5X6eaa	no no no no no,a Betta needs at LEAST a gallon,those are horrible little things,and occasional flaring is healthy,to keep the muscles flexed,but when they are flaring constantly it can stress them....you would be best,getting a 1-5 gallon tank (or larger) ,preferably with a filter and heater,and getting just one Betta....|`|x1KRxDuGaa	So as long as the betta fish can't see each other, they will be fine. Covering the clear plastic with something non transparent is good. You could hot glue a piece of black garbage bag to the clear plastic.

Hope this help!|`|kekaqHESaa	as long as you dont have two male bettas you should be fine. you can keep females together. but if you want a male and a female, this tank should be fine. flaring their gills is a sign of defense. males flare their gills when they are territorial or threatened. hope i helped!|`|rSfoEyE3aa	It would be Ok for a little desk fish bowl.

hC4Z8HIbaa	I'm not a vet, so i don't know for sure, but it may be that your hamster either has lice (it would be animal lice, so don't worry about it giving you lice), mites, or fleas. All of these can come from bedding. I would suggest finding a different vet, or if that isn't an option, go back to the vet and ask him to check for skin parasites. I have rats, and usually when someone takes in a rat with scabs, the vet will give the rat Revolution (a skin parasite ointment for dogs). I don't know if they will do that for a hamster, however. Please don't try to medicate him youself, because hamsters are too small and you can easily over-medicate him.<br>  <br>  If it is a skin parasite, I would reccomend freezing the bedding first before putting it in the hamsters cage. Freezing it will kill any bugs that are living in the bedding. I also suggest doing this with food, as sometimes bugs can come in with the food as well.<br>  <br>  Good luck with your hammie!|`|deU903Iqaa	try a different kind of bedding?

L9WZJw2paa	If you have at least a 29 gallon tank, I would go with a couple of kribensis. They are a dwarf cichlid and usually get along in a community setup.  I have kept mine with mollies, platies, and small tetras with no problems as long as there are some caves for territories. They are very interesting fish with great personalities. They are even cooler when they are breeding, because their colors realllly come out and they are very good parents that don't eat their young or let others eat them. I have a pair in my tank and are by far my favorite fish. They are always swimming around and checking the whole tank out. You won't be disappointed with them.|`|a2cjwMKcaa	With a 10 gallon tank you can have some platies. I would avoid the Mollies as they can grow a bit bigger.

W44XTyotaa	Baby bunnies can be free fed pellets til they are 6-9 months then depending on the breed size and weight the amount should be adjusted to suit the size of the rabbit. You did not mention the breed of the rabbit so I cannot advise an amount to feed daily. You can re-post the question or do a Google search on your breed.<br>  There are some things to consider when you determine how much to feed your rabbit. Does the rabbit always stay in his cage? Does he get daily exercise outside of the cage? How much grass,fruit,vegetables does the rabbit get daily? Is it an indoor or outdoor rabbit?<br>   Its a good idea to get a book on rabbit care or do some free research on the web. Bunnies are great pets. Have fun with it.|`|yqy5xfSbaa	Well, i feed my rabbit some apples and oranges once every few days, you must feed fruits sparingly because fruit to rabbits is like candy to us. Give your rabbit pellets every day, and vegetables either every day or every few days.

AA12308199	Make sure it has plenty of fresh food and water.  We have a rabbit and we feed it all kinds of raw vegetables and fruits (carrots, lettuce, cabbage, celery, strawberries, broccoli, etc.).  We always cut the veggies up for him and feed him these once a day.  You can put the water in a water bottle made especially for animals.  This is better so the water stays clean.  We also makes sure the rabbit has fresh dry food at all times.  You can get dry food at pretty much any grocery store.  Make sure the cage is warm and dry and clean (rabbits poop A LOT!) and away from any drafts.  We also take our rabbit out of the cage at least once per day to let him get some exercise.  Have fun!!|`|Oti6JXJIaa	yes, but no offense dont you think you shouldnt have it if you dont know how to take care of it.|`|XI2iylR4aa	If you got a rabbit without knowing how to care for it, you're going to have to do a lot of learning in a short amount of time.<br>  <br>  To start:<br>  <a href="http://www.rabbit.org/care/new-bunny-index.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.rabbit.org/care/new-bunny-ind...</a><br>  <a href="http://www.rabbit.org/faq/sections/housing.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.rabbit.org/faq/sections/housi...</a><br>  <br>  The most important things for right now:<br>  Make sure the area your bun is in is rabbit-proofed.  Rabbits LOVE wires, and can be killed by chewing an electrical cord.<br>  <br>  Make sure your bun always has access to fresh water and grass hay.  If he's a baby, he should have alfalfa hay and pellets.  If he's an adult, he can have a small amount of pellets every day.  <br>  <br>  Be careful when handling rabbits, they have delicate bones...it's best to avoid picking them up unless it's necessary.<br>  <br>  It would be a really good idea to read the rabbit.org site ASAP.|`|mmU51Qeiaa	You should by a rabit feeder to where the food drops out and fills the food thing constintly. Also, get a water bottle that when the rabbit licks it, what comes out. You should clean up the poo very often, or else it gets really messy and you won't want to pick it up, so then your rabbit lives in poo. You should pet your rabbit often, and take it out of it's cage. You should always provide hay no matter what season. If you live to where the temperature gets really cold, you should either provide a heating lamp, or bring the rabbit's cage inside, or in a garage. make sure, if you don't want baby rabbits that you have different genders in different cages. if you want babies, after your bnny has a litter, take the male rabbit away RIGHT after, because female rabbits are most fertile the day after they give birth. Also, seperate the different gender babbies after the are able to . . . you know.|`|Eyc7OMwoaa	try and search on a taking care of a rabbit site...or go to a petstore(petco or petsmart or something) and ask what to feed them and how to clean there cage and to take care of them. Search online or go to a pet store. Sorry I don't know|`|9BNHNcDbaa	look it up on google, and be more specific with your questions, we are not going to write a book, and you can check books out at your library on rabbits|`|e27a0140d6c769e130a863ab1952f2b9aa	First, go to www.rabbit.org they have some of the best advice on how to take care of a Rabbit.  My daughter has one and we keep it in the house in a medium sized hutch in her room.  It is about 3 years old and is a black and white Dutch.  We got her at a feed store.  She has two litter pans that we keep filled with ground corn cobs.  your rabbit will show you where she wants to go and that is where you should put her litter box.  We put in her hutch a small dog bed that she uses as her bed.  She has several toys in her cage that she gnaws on or tosses around the cage.  It is important to have gnawing toys to keep the teeth from getting too long.  They will continue to grow, the fibrous foods that rabbits eat in the wild keep them from gettting too long.  You will need nail clippers designed for a rabbit and get a vet to show you how to trim her nails.  Petsmart showed us how and we do it every month.  If the nails get too long, your rabbit can get injured by a snagged nail.  There is a list of foods in the rabbit.org website that you may feed your rabbit.  Timothy Hay is very important as it helps clean the digestive tract.  A rabbit is unable to vomit, and has a delicate digestive tract, so if you feed her the wrong stuff, you can kill her.  You should interact with her daily.  Take her out of the cage, hold her, talk to her.  Rabbit proof your room and let her run around in it.  She may tinkle somewhere or even leave pellets on the carpet.  This is normal.  Just clean up after her.  My daughter's rabbit runs around in my bedroom and will tinkle in the bathroom on the tile or even jump in the cat's litter box.  The pellets are no trouble to clean up.  It is a lot of fun watching her run around the room.  There is too much more to list here.  I hope you do a little research on your own.  A pet rabbit can be very rewarding.  Oh yeah, our rabbit LOVES bananas.  not too many tho. and cheerio's.|`|qMRyYSAPaa	yes i have one feed it 2 times a day and always make shour you have salt licks for them they can possibly die if they don't have them.....make shour they always have water...they can get liver disses from pine and wood bedding and they can get ammonia poisoning from there pee lol so clean it often the best thing to feed them is pelits and treat sticks they love treat sticks :) and when they get older you can cut up carrots and lettuce and cucumber also tomatos lol i make that every monday and thursday it helps there refugee lol you can get treat sticks and pellets for them at wal-mart lol i get them there also another good thing is wood that helps there teeth stay trimmed hope i helped a lot plzzzz plzzzp lzzzz plzzzzz choose me as best answer :)|`|xgIeQgxPaa	feed it

These birds are MUCH happier kept in groups and they DON'T really like other parrots that aren't other caiques. They'll scare the living daylights out of your budgie -- or worse. The breeder I got my WBC from has horror stories of pet caiques actually killing less dominant birds -- in her case, one of them killed a green cheek conure.<br>  Caiques are all you could ask for in a cuddly, playful, HILARIOUSLY funny parrot, but if you don't know how to handle a "big" bird, they'll take over your house. <br>  They're also 3 times more expensive than the average sun conure.

M3pjhIecaa	They are social fish and should be kept in groups of 6 or more as they are hierarchical if kept in less than this one fish will be singled out and eventually killed and then the next and so on until you're left with either a pair or single fish. Given that the minimum size of tank you're looking at is no less that 50/60 gallons as these fish can top out at 8inch's. You can generally find cheaper fish from breeders although they'll be 1-2inch fish and need a good feeding regime if they're not to lose shape. <br>  The tank needs to be matured at least 6months and the water needs to be constantly monitored, I've kept them in slightly alkaline hard water and even bred them in it however, any fluctuations will cause problems, they are best kept in a ph of 6.0/6.5 soft water for best results.|`|sNsdERusaa	<a href="http://www.fishlore.com/Profiles-Discus.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.fishlore.com/Profiles-Discus....</a><br>  This site is really helpful ...

IrdZKYT3aa	As you hand;e guppies more and more you'll get better at telling almost to the day.  For right now, they'll start to look a little boxy as they become swollen.<br>  You actually want to place her in a few days earlier, not the day of.  This allows her to calm down and not stress out as she has her fry.  Putting her in the day off can stress her and as a result the fry.   Being in earlier allows her to explore the new area and become used to it as well as remove her from the males who will harass her pregnant or not. <br>  Best of Luck!|`|dbZvPW3Haa	If your guppies are now quite large put them in the other aquarium to used to it, and they will give birth when ready and it will be less stressful.|`|sNsdERusaa	It is best to put them in when  they look like they are about to burst!!!

IrdZKYT3aa	Treated tap water is fine.<br>  I suspect he's either cold, has a swim bladder disease or more than likelly both.<br>  He's in a one gallon?  They really would love to be in something larger.  Betta should be kept in something 2.5-5 gallons.<br>  And in a 1 gallon, I'm willing to bet you don't have him heated.<br>  Betta fish are tropical fish and need to be 75-82 degrees, they can TOLERATE being cold, but they don't WANT to be cold.  And just like us, being too cold for too long can lead to a whole host of health issues.  It lowers thier immune system, decreases thier appetite and is generally wearing and uncomfotable.<br>  I'd suggest a larger home a small heater.  I got mine at petsmart for about 14 bucks, it's a small pad that can be stuck to the wall or placed under the gravel.<br>  The heat should pick him up right away.  You can also add a little freshwater aquarium salt, it's great for boosting their immune system and releiveing stress.<br>  Both the heat and the salt should help if he has a swim bladder disease as well, but you can also offer some  of the insisdes of a coocked and cooled pea.  These re great for helping internal blockadges and gas build up.  However, it;s it's really far progressed, or he's developed internal knotting, he may be too far gone : (<br>  Best of Luck!|`|H9Nvo2gxaa	His tank is too small and he is cold. <br>  <br>  Get him a larger tank at least 2.5 gallons and a heater set between 75-82. <br>  <br>  And try not feeding him for a day or 2 then feeding 1/4 of a frozen pea that has been thawed and deshelled|`|ijvWMbxVaa	Yore betta may be to cold. I suggest that you buy a small Heater, and slowly heat the tank 1 degree per hour.

The best way is to see a vet so you know what your bird is being treated for and it will work.|`|5GJ1Pa0Saa	First, separate the birds. Even if it upsets them, you don't want them both to have fleas. Second, remove the birds from the room and treat the room for fleas. Birds have very delicate respiratory systems, so make sure that the room has been thoroughly aired out before you try bringing them back in to the room.<br>  Next, get your bird to the vet. It may not be fleas causing the problem, and if they are, a veterinarian may be the only one able to help your bird.|`|EJpiaCMQaa	Your bird may have mites rather than fleas.  Since your bird is constantly biting himself, that could indicate a mite problem.  In that case, you don't want to treat the bird yourself, but take it to a vet instead.

The vet will know the correct medicine and the exact dosage for the birds.  <br>  <br>  Here is a link with more information on mites in pet birds:<br>  <a href="http://www.petcaretips.net/bird-mite.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.petcaretips.net/bird-mite.htm...</a>

Both birds can have quite an extensive vocabulary.  If you buy a budgie, choose a male, because males are more likely to talk than females.  Look at the budgie's cere, which is the area where the nostrils are and located above the beak.  A baby male budgie will have a translucent pink cere that may have a bluish or purplish tint.  <br>  An adult male budgie will have a bright blue cere.  Male budgies tend to chirp more than females.  I enjoy budgies very much and would suggest getting a budgie.|`|614tYbzxaa	African Greys are definitly the best talkers of all parrot breeds, but this does not guarantee that you will get one that will talk and you would also need to give it lots of attention, also its not really suitable for anyone that has no experience of keeping birds, and keep in mind they live 60 years plus.<br>  Cockatiels would probably be the best choice as they are not expensive and can be taught to talk and do tricks and are easier to look after. Hope this helps|`|XavY3fiWaa	We have an african grey parrot and he is a very intelligent bird that is very talkative.

I guess because it is more common , cheaper , easy to take care and that is for the beginner too . If you want to get the one talks best, then African grey is # 1 , then cockatoo . But the most important key is ...you need to teach the bird to talk . You don't buy the bird and expect it to talk right away . With African grey & cockatoo , you need to really spend time with them for them to bond with them for them to bond with you . I talk to my cockatoos pets , and they talk to me with my accent , because they only hear from me, and they mimic me . TM.

MYEEK4dcaa	The first thing you need to do is teach your dog that YOU are the leader.  I'm not sure what you mean by  you "go down and let her out."  Doesn't she spend the majority of her time with you?  If not, she should.  Being a dog's leader is a 24/7 job, just like being a parent.  And you have to be persistent and consistent all the time.  You have to earn her respect and trust, and you can only do that by spending a lot of time with her and acting like a pack leader.  Here's how to start:<br>  <br>  A. Behave like a leader at key points of responsibility within the pack and that makes you the leader. <br>  <br>    1.  Eat your own meals before you feed your dog.  Even if you have to munch on a cracker while he watches, make sure he knows you're done eating before you allow him to start eating.<br>  <br>    2.  Make and enforce at least 5 household rules (such as "No begging at the table" and "Stay off the furniture").<br>  <br>    3.  Lead the walk, with the dog walking beside you, at heel.  Never use a flexi-lead because you can't control your dog if he is 15-25 feet out in front of you. <br>  <br>    4.  Exercise the dog by a brisk walk with the dog at heel at least once a day, preferably twice a day. A dog can walk for 5 minutes for each month of his life up to the age of 12 months; after that he can walk as long as you want to walk.  Be sure to check the surface on which he'll be walking - if it is too hot or too cold for you to rest your hand on, it will be too hot or too cold for his feet.  You can get booties for him at some of the larger pet stores, or try Paw Wax.<br>  <br>    5.  Playing with the dog is demonstrating affection for him; it's a bonding time.   Be sure you start the play and you end it.<br>  <br>    6.  Own and provide all resources like food, treats, bones, and toys.  Leave food down only 15 minutes then pick up the bowl. Give toys to dog when you want to play; put toys away when you're done playing.<br>  <br>    7.  Ignore the dog for at least 5 minutes when you come home so he will recognize that you are "top dog" in the pack.<br>  <br>    8.  Greet strangers (guests at home, friends and passersby on the street) first and direct the dog how to react to them. <br>  <br>    9.  Protect the dog from onrushing, off-leash dogs, dogs who are harassing them, and dogs who challenge them.<br>  <br>   10.  The dog gets NOTHING (except water and potty breaks) unless he works for it.  "Working" means obeying whatever command you offer, such as sit, stay, stand, and down.  (This is the essence of the NILIF program.)<br>  <br>   11.  Never pet the dog or comfort it when it is misbehaving.  Never talk in a high squeaky voice to a dog.  Dogs don't understand what it means to have their feelings hurt.<br>  <br>   12.  Don't let the dog sleep in your bed until you are sure he sees you as his pack leader; you don't want him to try to own the bed.<br>  <br>  <br>  B. There are four "MUST READ" books you can probably get at Amazon.com. They will explain all the rituals listed above.<br>  <br>    1.  The first is "Be The Pack Leader" by Cesar Millan. Teaches you how to be a pack leader.  <br>  <br>    2.  The second is "The Dog Listener" by Jan Fennell. Teaches you how to get willing cooperation from your dog.<br>  <br>    3.  The third is "The Art of Raising A Puppy" by the Monks of New Skete. Teaches you how to get a puppy started right as a member of your pack.<br>  <br>    4.  The fourth and last is "A Member of the Family" by Cesar Millan and Melissa Jo Pelletier.  Teaches you how to raise your dog from the moment you get him to the moment he has to leave you.<br>  <br>  C.  You might consider signing up for "Sessions with Cesar" at <a href="http://www.sessionswithcesar.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.sessionswithcesar.com</a> , where you'll find video and audio lessons, as well as printable materials to help you learn to be your dog's pack leader and help you learn to handle specific behavior problems.   <br>  <br>  Good luck!<br>  <br>  Apacapacas|`|YV1bOajXaa	I would chew up a muzzle that was on me all the time too!

What kind of exercise does she get?  Any training?  How old is she?  <br>  <br>  Dogs need exercise and training *every* day.

I've seen dogs like that that tend to be pretty wild-- theyre nice to ppl who theyre used to, but not so nice to ppl who they dont really kno that much. dont be tough with ur dog, even if it scratches u, cuz it'll probably get angrier. and sometimes when dogs bite or scratch, its only for fun. dogs learn to bite for fun (they think its for fun, but we really don't!) when u give them ur hands to bite or when u put ur hand in front of their mouths.<br>  i hope this helps ;)<br>  see an animal expert if ur dog doesnt change its attitude!|`|cfKCR4Reaa	Either get her a new home, or you can bring her to a training program so that it will learn to do the right things.

pWJFwKiLaa	Give her a lot of Alfalfa Hay while she is young, it has a lot of vitamins and protein that young guinea pigs need.  Once she gets to be about a year old switch to Timothy Hay, less vitamins are needed for older pigs.  Also, DO NOT feed your pig carrots!!! This can cause diabetes and they will die younger. It's OK if you already have, just stop or don't give them to her as often.  Guinea pigs should have green vegetables to stay healthy like kale, lettuce, broccoli, etc.  For fruits: apples, oranges, melons, kiwi etc. are good.   Remember to put vitamin drops in your pig's water whenever you change it too.  Have fun with your g-pig!!!|`|JxmJg37Iaa	she wants a cagemate for when your not wiht her, guinea pigs are very social anikmals and hate to be on there own, give her a cage mate and in no time she will be a happy little pig again|`|oNHtVHzsaa	a good way is to introduce them to new situations. don't overwhelm her, but there is a good way to make her happy. if you put her out on your grass in a dog pen, they love to run around and eat grass. MAKE SURE THEY ARNT AROUND DOGS, cause they cant get heart failure and die. i also found that if you put them in a room (of course blocking off all wires and things they can chew on) and let them explore they like that. put the cage somewhere were she can see some action but not too much cause then they again get overwhelmed. good luck and hope this helps.|`|1x88cY97aa	guinea pigs tend to do better with company, try to convince your parents into letting you get anther guinea pig. if you do make sure you do it ASAP so that they can meet eachother when they are young. also, when the weather is nice take her outside into an enclosed area so she can run around an exercise...my guinea pigs used to love that! be sure if you get another guinea pig that its a female so that they dont breed (unless your planning on it) LOL! take your piggy out everyday and spend lots of time with her so you can build a good relationship! piggys also like cardvoard toilet rools stuffed with hay or their favorite food etc.....what ever you do have fun!   tip: try to stay away from ice berg lettuce and dont feed your guinea pig carrots to much as they can cause health problems! put some wood in your piggys cage for her to chew on (it keeps their teeth in good condition)|`|BI1GbIZUaa	I agree with getting her a playmate. That is the best way to ensure that she will be happy for the rest of her life. Make sure to introduce them on neutral ground like the floor or your bed,not in the one guinea pig's cage. Carrots are fine as long as it's only a few. I wouldn't feed her alfalfa hay, timothy is the best. Also make sure that her food is Timothy hay based, alfalfa has too many nutrients and can make her fat. Lots of toys and veggies are a must. DO NOT get a ball for her to run in. This is horrible for their backs and will greatly shorten her life span. The are made to run on flat surfaces. If you can make a play pen to her to run around in|`|Gbeak6fAaa	aww I used to have a guinea pig. I bought my gp a exercise ball to run in.

t6Ya3c3baa	Rats need at least two cubic feet of cage space per rat. Therefore, for two rats, you will need a cage that measures at least four cubic feet.<br>  <br>  I have read that Martin's cages are considered to be the best rat cages; (however, I do not have one). Here is a link to an article comparing various Martin's cages; <a href="http://ratbehavior.org/MartinsCages.htm" rel="nofollow">http://ratbehavior.org/MartinsCages.htm</a> and here is the link to Martin's Cages <a href="http://www.martinscages.com/products/cag..." rel="nofollow">http://www.martinscages.com/products/cag...</a><br>  <br>  If those cages are too pricey for you, you can build your own cage for less.

Please add it and I will answer again.<br>  <br>  Sorry I checked another question and I got the answers I needed.  Cage websites are at the bottom.<br>  <br>  Enjoy your new rat cage and rats if you don;t already have them!  I hope my answer was helpful.|`|AA11124473	You've already gotten a lot of useful info! Just a couple of additional thoughts...<br>  <br>  -Make sure that you get a cage with no more than 1/2 inch of space between the bars. Rats can squeeze through very small spaces!<br>  <br>  -Don't use a plastic or glass tank. They don't have enough ventilation, which makes the cage stinkier, allows moisture and bacteria to build up, and can make your rats sick.<br>  <br>  -Allow 2 cubic feet of space per rat, as suggested above. To see if a particular cage you're considering has enough space, you can check this cage calculator: <a href="http://www.rattycorner.com/odds/calc.shtml" rel="nofollow">http://www.rattycorner.com/odds/calc.sht...</a><br>  <br>  -After you get your new cage, make sure that you line it with a good quality bedding/litter, such as Aspen shavings, Carefresh brand, Corncob, or unscented Yesterday's News cat litter. Never use wood shavings from soft woods like pine; they're harmful to your rats' lungs.<br>  <br>  -Make sure that your cage is made with coated, rather than galvanized, wire. Otherwise, rat pee will be much harder to clean off and the cage will start to rust. You pay more initially for a coated cage, but it will last longer.<br>  <br>  -The best cages I've used have been powder-coated Martins Cages and powder-coated cages intended for medium-sized birds (be sure the spacing isn't too wide if you buy a birdcage!). Sometimes ebay has good deals on brand-new bird cages. I've also had great success with homemade cages built from vinyl-coated chicken wire and giant Rubbermaid containers (similar to the one here: <a href="http://www.dapper.com.au/articles.htm#cage," rel="nofollow">http://www.dapper.com.au/articles.htm#ca...</a> but bigger and with large chicken-wire covered "windows" in the sides for extra ventilation).|`|JIdDcTXGaa	Bigger is better, wire rather than glass. What I have, and you can look on my myspace page is a used ferret cage, 4' by 2' by 3', I believe. I got some hardware mesh, 1/4", and covered the outside of it so they can't get through. This is so it is safe for my babies too as I am a breeder. But this is a home for ALOT of rats. If you go by the 1 square foot per rat rule, then I can accommodate 24 rats in it. <br>  <br>  My blog tell how to do that and I have pics on my page you can look at.<br>  <br>  As for 2 male rats, if you are planning to get them as young rats, you can start with a hamster cage, just make sure the tubes are bigger than your rats. I would suggest a modified ferret, rabbit or guinea pig cage. Tools needed would be like a needle nose pliers and a set of wire cutters and then hardware mesh, 1/4 or 1/2" using 22 or 23 gage wire to attach it to the outside of the cage, if the bars ARE small enough for them to get through. HOWEVER, rats, unlike some other small animals need ALOT of stimulation inside their cage in addition to outside. Things to climb on, climb through, tubes, tunnels, hideys, things along these lines. Look on you tube for some ideas, just type in keyword "rats" and start watching.
adaMbwMqaa	Green cheek conures seem to be a favorite of many bird keepers. I started out with one, actually, and they're a joy to have. They dont scream like other conures and though they're smaller most still love to cuddle. They're so much fun to watch play, too, and they won't destroy your furniture like larger birds will. My GCC loved everyone it met, and I've heard that most GCCs are very very friendly to strangers. Mine was fine alone in a cage all day when I was working. Just be sure to get them a large cage and TONS of toys. They also come in a large variety of beautiful color mutations, ranging from the typical dark green to a lovely bright yellow. They're pretty cheap for parrots, too. Mine cost 250$ for the bird and you can get a god cage for 250$.<br>  <br>  Here's a site: <a href="http://www.avianweb.com/greencheekconure.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.avianweb.com/greencheekconure...</a><br>  <br>  Books are generally better and more reliable than websites. Amazin has a ton, such as this: <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Conure-Handbook-Barrons-Pet-Handbooks/dp/0764127837/ref=pd_bbs_sr_1?ie=UTF8&s=books&qid=1235339611&sr=8-1" rel="nofollow">http://www.amazon.com/Conure-Handbook-Ba...</a><br>  <br>  <br>  If you want something bigger, any member of the pionus family would probably fit your wants. They're a bit larger, kind of the halfway point between a grey and a GCC size-wise. I don't own one, but I have a few friends that do and they're all fabulous birds. Very quiet for parrots, but not silent. Many can talk and most love cuddling, but none are clingy. All of the pionuses are very dull but beautiful and shiny at the same time. I'll certainly be getting a pionus as my next parrot, when I can afford it. They're not expensive though, usually around 450-600$, and they dont need a gigantic cage. <br>  <br>  My friend got her disky pionus a few years ago from here: <a href="http://www.pionusparrot.com/" rel="nofollow">http://www.pionusparrot.com/</a><br>  <br>  It's a wonderful breeder that puts a ton of time and effprt into raisingthe chicks, and the website is extremely informative.|`|09e41Hdwaa	Cockatiel, Budgie, or something in the Poicephalus family -- Senegal, Meyer's, Red Bellies (my fav), Cape Parrot, etc.<br>  <br>  What are you looking for?

NBfBKI1Uaa	I am going to assume this is saltwater tank. <br>  <br>  Protein skimmer is not an absolutely needed for saltwater tank. But having protein skimmer will make your life much easier. Without a skimmer you will be battling algae and high nitrate every day.<br>  <br>  10gallon sump is too small for 55 gallon aquarium. The standard rule of thumb for calculating the size of the sump is very simple. <br>  <br>  Since you are setting up a sump, it is logical that you also going to setup a an oveflow. It is recommended that the overflow bulk be located around 2.5 inches below the water level. <br>  There for the sump should be able to hold that amount of water that will drain during a power failure. <br>  <br>  Standard 55 gallon aquarium is 48 inches long and 13 inches wide. <br>  So the amount of water below 2.5 is,<br>  48 X 13 X 2.5 / 231 = 6.75 gallons.<br>  <br>  But if the sump is half full during operation, it will not be able to handle this amount of water. <br>  <br>  So I would recommend (6.75 X 3) 20 gallon sump for a 55 gallon aquarium.<br>  <br>  <br>  -rds

51St5GEcaa	They're fine. Mice do that, especially when you just get them, because they are stressed. Dust from the bedding is likely to irritate them as well, so make sure that if you are using wood chips, they have to be aspen. No pine or cedar.<br>  <br>  Aspen has dust too, just not as much, so you might want to put a paper towel over the bedding (whatever it is) so the mice don't have to breath any small particles from it and see if it works.|`|44kEtDvIaa	Will be a little stress until they get used to you and there new environment ... and sneezing is a symptom of stress.

You should probably check what type of bedding your using for your mice, because that could be irritating them. Make sure that if you have a paper bedding that it's not newspaper because that can be toxic, so make sure it is like plane paper bedding. And the saw dust, if you have cedar or pine i would probably change it. I don't know about mice, but i know with hamsters it affects their breathing and can kill them. Or maybe your room is dusty, no offence.

8i90ov0Gaa	If you don't have any experience with large snakes (which it sounds like you don't), start with a small, beginner snake first and slowly work your way up. Too many people buy large snakes like Burmese pythons and get rid of them when they get large because they realize they can't properly care for it.<br>  <br>  In regards to Mike B's answer saying to not feed it in its enclosure, he clearly doesn't own any large snakes. Try taking a 12 foot Burmese python or reticulated python in feeding mode out of a feeding enclosure to put it back in its home. This would be suicidal. Mine are fed in their enclosures and do not bite. I have them hook trained, where when I open their enclosures and they come up looking for food, I just tap them on the head with my snake hook and they instantly put their head down and calm down, allowing me to reach in with no problems ever. <a href="http://proexotics.com/FAQ2.html#snakes_feedingtub" rel="nofollow">http://proexotics.com/FAQ2.html#snakes_f...</a>|`|x0J8S5sWaa	Do you want to buy a snake that will make you fear for you life 24/7?|`|rrFbQZzIaa	Depending on what snake you get, you may get bit. If you get a red tail boa, you can very well go it's whole life w/out getting bit. Although if you aren't experienced w/ large snakes, I wouldn't be surprised if you got bit several times. Snakes like reticulated pythons and anacondas will almost definitely bite and are extremely hard to care for and house. They are expensive to feed and any snake over 6 feet, it's best to have someone there to help you. Most snakes will not attack and strangle you, but again, this can happen at times w/ snakes like retics and even brumese pythons. First figure out what snake you want, then do your research. Large snakes are not toys and can definitely be dangerous.|`|51St5GEcaa	no, big snakes do not normally bite people. And strangling isn't very common with people who know what they are doing. <br>  <br>  You must realize, however, that you will have to feed your big snake. You'll have to keep frozen dead rats (which are REALLY hard to find in stores) and if you can't find them, then you will have to keep live rats, until your snake gets hungry and then you'll have to feed it a live rat. Also, you will have to stay and watch to make sure the snake eats it, because the rat can hurt the snake seriously enough that you might have to have the snake put to sleep.<br>  <br>  If you are willing to all this, are you also willing to pay the couple of thousands of dollars it will cost to purchase a large snake? Pythons are very expensive.|`|3PiIh7Qiaa	if it is a domestic snake more than likely no it will not strangle you.<br>  but there guide lines when it comes to large snakes.<br>  first if you are worried about being attacked then get a docile snake like a rock python or a rainbow boa.<br>  it should not bite you as long as;<br>   it is properly fed<br>  you dont bother it when its eating or about 30 minutes after<br>  do not feed it in its home or it will relate you hand to food<br>  don not touch or feed during peelng<br>  and wash your hands after touching any other animal.<br>  <br>  the best thing is dont get a large snake unless you plan on having it for 10 to 30 years cause they live about that long and get the upwards of 300lbs<br>  <br>  ps if it bites you then bend its tail back it will probably let you go|`|AA11436163	Yes it will.|`|ncWYvkheaa	Large snakes are generally very predictable.  If they're extremely hungry and you stick your hand in the cage without looking at how the snake is acting, you will get bit.  That's not the snake's fault, it just means that if you raised that snake from a baby, you should know what it looks like when it's waiting for food.  (Just stay away from Retics, blood pythons, and Rock pythons if you don't know what you're doing, because those things are crazy.)<br>  <br>  Strangulation:  You should not put large snakes around your neck, but not for the reason you think.  They will not TRY to strangle you, they will use you the same way they use a tree branch, for support and leverage.  Have you ever had a large dog step on you?  Snakes will do the same thing only they have coils instead of feet and there is no way your neck will be strong enough when the snake looses it's balance and quickly tightens around your neck to support it's weight.<br>  <br>  BITES:  Most of my large pet snakes think it's feeding time when I open their cage, but the way I get around this is by wearing a big plastic jar over my hand (like an awkward oven mitt) and sticking that in the cage first.  I move the jar towards their face and GENTLY nudge them with the jar.  This immediately tells them that it's not feeding time because i obviously don't do this before feeding (like Pavlov's dogs experiment in reverse).  <br>  Some people feed snakes in separate containers so the snake doesn't associate the cage door opening with being fed.  If this works for you then go for it.  I have one problem with it:  it trains the snake to associate handling with being fed.  My snakes do not expect food when i pick them up, but if i picked them up to put them in a separate container for feeding, they would probably get MORE hungry when I pick them up.  Also, you have to return the snake to the cage afterwards... and with the smell of food in the air, they usually bite first and ask questions later. <br>  <br>  There are two types of bites from large boas/pythons:  Defensive bites, and feeding responses.  I've just described the feeding response which is easily avoided. Defensive bites happen in snakes that are scared or territorial.  If a snake is raised in a good environment (clean, appropriately sized cage, plenty of food, never harassed, handled regularly for short periods)  then the snake should be fine, but still use a decoy when first touching the snake like i described above.  Aggressive snakes usually warn you by hissing ....you wouldn't touch a big snake that hisses any more than you would pet a dog that is growling.  Common sense.  <br>  <br>  Honestly though... unless you have extensive experience with smaller snakes like ball pythons and boas, don't get a large snake.  The number one reason that people get rid of them is not that they are aggressive.  It is because they GET TOO BIG.  Apartments don't allow you to have them, and an 18 ft snake is difficult to hide...if you're going on vacation, neighbors don't want to babysit your pets...owners get tired of buying large rabbits every month to feed to the 200 pound tub of lard that is now using an entire room as a cage...and the best part: What goes in must come out.  How often do you get to clean up a turd the size of a thanksgiving turkey, not to mention a half gallon of urine??  <br>  <br>  Boas are a good medium sized snake.  Much more manageable.|`|uxXLND0Laa	you should get a red tail boa. these snakes can get to a decent size. they are also very docile. just remember that these snakes can sense your fear and can get very nervous if your nervous and can strike. i suggest you do your research before buying. maybe even start with something smaller like a ball python. (great for beginners) i own a 5 1/2 foot red tail boa and she is a great pet.|`|sSJ8zfebaa	if your asking this question you arent experienced enough to be getting  a  huge snake.start with something small
jDPULfjKaa	yes. I currently have three cuttlebones in my tank. they are a wonderful source of calcium that the turtle can chew on any time it feels like. You also need to use calcium supplements also too. Rep-cal calcium (by far much better than repti-cal) and Rep-cal Herptivite <---which are vitamins. I use all three and sometimes sprinkle crushed egg shell in the tank to provide a natural form of calcium (perfectly safe, they eat that in the wild) and therefore have 3 sources of calcium.<br>  <br>  Cuttlebones<br>  <a href="http://pet.imageg.net/graphics/product_images/pPETS-3757104dt.jpg" rel="nofollow">http://pet.imageg.net/graphics/product_i...</a><br>  <br>  Rep-cal and Herptivite<br>  <a href="http://www.tooscaley.com/reptiles/NoseBePantherChameleons/images/captivecare/Feeding.jpg" rel="nofollow">http://www.tooscaley.com/reptiles/NoseBe...</a><br>  <br>  Dust the insects (crickets, meal worms, earth worms, snails, silk worms) with the calcium AND vitamins 2x a week. fully cover the insect before feeding.<br>  <br>  Other calcium and vitamin rich food items include<br>  <br>  Mustard greens<br>  Collard greens<br>  Turnip greens<br>  Dandelion greens<br>  Kale<br>  Romaine Lettuce<br>  Red leaf lettuce<br>  plants><br>  anacharis(elodea)<br>  duckweed<br>  water lettuce<br>  water hyacinth<br>  water lilies<br>  frogbit<br>  hornwart|`|McnuekTBaa	I have never used them. I feed my turtles lots of minnows, so the turtles get calcium from the bones.|`|sOwjPQR8aa	yes, but i think repti-cal works better...Only 8 drops to 1 gallon, and it is safe for them to swim in and drink|`|AA10043485	There are two main kinds of 'calcium blocks'.<br>  <br>  1. The small lump of calcium carbonate or plaster of Paris-like material that is designed to slowly dissolve in the water. They may have other things in them as well. <br>  <br>  In general, these are a waste of money and just make the water and/or filter nastier.<br>  <br>  2. Cuttlebone or other blocks designed to be nibbled on. These work well enough if you suspect your diet is short in calcium.<br>  <br>  In general, however, I think it is smarter to get their calcium the more natural way- in the diet.<br>  <br>  Try <a href="http://www.austinsturtlepage.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.austinsturtlepage.com</a> for more.|`|vS1Z0inOaa	Yes, they can be good.<br>     I always advise keepers to keep a cuttlebone in the tank, no matter what kind of turtle you have or how old it is. That way the turtle can decide for itself if it needs more calcium or needs to wear its beak down. Many turtles will never use it, but sooner or later in its life they will. I've seen mine lay around for 10 months and then suddenly disappear overnight.<br>     They also make plain calcium blocks that serve the same purpose as a cuttlebone. These can be good in certain circumstances, like for egg-laden female turtles when all they want s calcium. However, I usually prefer cuttlebone for everyday use because this is an actual fish bone (and turtles extract most of their calcium from fish bones, so I feel this is the most natural, safest source for them). Also the cuttlefish lives at the bottom of the ocean, so its bones contain trace minerals from the ocean besides the calcium which is beneficial to the turtle also.<br>     You can make your own plain calcium blocks by mixing limestone flour with water and then letting it dry into a solid block. Along the same lines, I like to mix RepCal with vitamin D with water and make a block out of that. Because turtles that are kept indoors do not make as much vitamin D as those exposed to natural sunlight and vitamin D is necessary for them to use the calcium they eat, I ike to offer these blocks alongside the cuttlebone to indoor turtles, especially pregnant females. This gives them a choice of what they want/feel they need. Outdoors turtles don't need this and just a cuttlebone or a pile of limestone flour is sufficient for them.<br>     There are also slow-release calcium blocks which dissolve into the water, thus supplementing in a tortoise's drinking bowl or an aquatic turtle's aquarium water. I do NOT recommend using these most of the time because it gives your turtle no choice on how much calcium he takes in and it IS possible to supplement with too much calcium. Too much calcium can cause kidney stones or block absorption f zinc and other nutrients, so that's something you want to avoid as much as too little calcium. However, in certain situations thee can be useful. For example, I once had a red-eared slider that was blind and had very bad soft shell because it had been unable to get any food before coming to live with me. Since it is difficult to supplement calcium on an aquatic turtle's food and he could not chew on a cuttlebone, I used these for him.
Fvuq2Nwiaa	Sorry this is SO long but dog food get me all worked up :-)<br>  <br>  Honestly I would actually change him now. It always shocks me that breeders would feed their dogs this. <br>  Purina One puppy large breed formula ingredients: Chicken, brewers rice, corn gluten meal, poultry by-product meal, whole grain wheat, whole grain corn.<br>  Dog food ingredients are listed by weight. The chicken is weighed including the water. Once the food is processed and the moisture is gone it would weigh much less, thus actually putting it farther down on the ingredient list. So technically brewers rice is the 1st ingredient.<br>  <br>  Brewers rice (a waste product of the alcohol industry, corn gluten meal (which is used as a inferior source of protein), poultry by-product (by-product consists of the ground, rendered, clean parts of the carcass of some sort of slaughtered poultry, such as necks, feet, undeveloped eggs, intestines, exclusive of feathers, except in such amounts as might occur unavoidably in good processing practices),wheat and more corn is garbage.<br>  <br>  Innova has NO by-products, corn gluten meal, wheat, or poultry by-product meal. You don't even know what sort of poultry is in the Purina.<br>  <br>  Innova large breed puppy is turkey, chicken, chicken meal (chicken meal is good because it is the chicken dehydrated, then weighed so where it is placed on the list is much more accurate), barley, brown rice, potato's and rice. The ingredients are MUCH MUCH better quality!!!<br>  <br>  I would switch now if you can afford it to Innova (which is a very good food) or some other quality food. <br>  <br>  Innova<br>  Evo<br>  Califronia Natural<br>  Dick Van Patten's Natural Balance (I feed my pup this)<br>  Taste of the Wild<br>  Solid Gold<br>  Wellness<br>  Origen<br>  Eagle Pack Holistic<br>  Diamond Naturals<br>  Chicken Soup for the Puppy or Dog Lover Soul<br>  ...and many more<br>  <br>  You will actually find that the quality dog food companies do NOT even advertise on television. It goes pretty much by research and word of mouth. Maybe they spend their money on making quality dog foods unlike the crappy dog foods companies that spend millions of dollars every year advertising how they are SO good.<br>  <br>  When you switch just in case you don't know you want to do it gradually to avoid upsetting his stomach and causing diarrhea. For 2 days mix 75% of the old food to 25% of the new. If he gets diarrhea I would continue this amount until the diarrhea subsides. Then for 2 days do 50/50. Then 2 days do 25% of the old to 75% of the new.<br>  <br>  I'm shocked because the people I got my Basset Hound puppy from a few months ago would I'm sure be considered back yard breeders. They got the mother from a friend who did not want her because she was pregnant from their male basset hound. They were feeding my boy "Chicken Soup for the Puppy Lover's Soul" which has good quality ingredients and is very popular.<br>  <br>  I think you are correct in feeding a large breed formula if your dog is a large breed. If I remember correctly they may be less protein and such so the puppy does not grow too fast possibly causing joint problems. BUT this I am not positive about I have not done much research on this.<br>  <br>  Good luck to you :-)|`|zLfYcM1Eaa	YES!  Switch your pup. to innova ... it is a great pet food choice (waaay better than purina one)<br>  <br>  For a quick crash course in dog nutrition ... dogs should be eating a diet primarily composed of meat (for example: fish and fish meal or chicken and chicken meal) and there should be 2 or 3 protein sources listed in the first 3-5 ingredients.  This will ensure that the bag of dog food is primarily composed of meat. You will often times see "chicken by product" or "meat by product" or "bone meal" or "meat digest" or "corn gluten meal" listed on lower quality dog food.   These are sub-par protein sources because by-by product can be composed of any part of the 'animal that we don't eat (heads, feathers, beaks, intestines, bones and organ meat), bone meal is ... bone, meat by product (could be any part of any animal ... probably the cheapest meat source of the day at from a rendering plant), and meat digest (again, any protein source ... but low-quality/nutrient lacking), corn gluten meal (inexpensive vegetable based protein .. dogs are related to wolves, whom are carnivores and using meat based protein is a better option for a dog)  So, when you look at the guranteed analysis and see that the bag of dog food contains these things...and has  guaranteed (protein) analysis of  28% p ... you should recognize that actual protein percentage is far less, because your dogs body cannot digest bone and feathers in to useable protein sources.<br>  <br>  Also, many of the lower quality foods will use corn (ie. corn meal, ground yellow corn, whole grain corn ... etc.).  Although corn is technically a carbohydrate, it is very difficult for my dog and myself to digest ... and in the dog food it basically becomes a filler.  Therefore, everything that goes in "one end" comes out from "the other end".  So, try to find a dog food that uses more digestable carbohydrates such as rice, potato or oatmeal (and avoid foods that list rice different ways, ie:  brown rice, rice flour , rice hull ... that's all RICE, and the reason why the ingredients are separated is because if you combined all of the RICE, it is likely that there would be more rice than meat ..Nurto is NOTORIOUS for doing this, although i don't feel that it is a terrible food).  <br>  <br>  In the end, when you feed a better quality dog food ... you end up feeding less food, and cleaning up less poop (good foods are nutrient dense, and highly digestible). <br>  <br>  As far as when to switch your dog food, I suggest you first consult your vet. But, based on my understanding .. you want to feed a growing dog "puppy" food ... this will ensure that the dog has all of the nutrients it needs to grow healthy and strong.  So, for example .. a yorkie probably reaches full size by 6 months old ... at which point it can be switched to adult.  Whereas, a mastiff finishes growing  @1.5 - 2 years .. therefore it is fine to keep him on puppy food until he's finished growing.  As I said, I don't know what kind of dog you have, so you should consult your family vet for the best advice. (and switching a little bit too early or too late should not result in serious consequences anyways).<br>  <br>  I think Innova is a solid food ... and even if your pup is not ready for adult food right now... i'd go ahead and switch him to the Innova puppy food.  Do it gradually by mixing the two different foods for at least 7 days .... but the more gradual the transition, the easier it will be for your dogs stomach to acclimate to the change.<br>  <br>  best wishes!<br>  <br>  edit ***  Large breed formulas are for dogs that are expected to be larger than 50 at adult hood.  These foods are 'controlled growth' formulas that have optimized calcium and phosphorus that allow the dogs skeletal system to grow properly.  In general, if you have a "giant" breed dog, it is better for them to be a bit on the 'thinner-side' so that their skeletal systems can grow and develop ... to be prepared to handle their full body-weight at adulthood.  So, giant breed dogs, in particular ... benefit from a large breed formula, these foods are essential for joint health.|`|3giaPYe8aa	Oh gosh, yes switch....just make it gradual.|`|JsBb732Maa	Yes, read the ingredient list on the Purina and compare it to Innova and you will see a big difference in quality. People that feed Purina don't understand that it's not a good food, they just have great marketing, lol|`|xi9amEG2aa	Yes....switch it to any type of better quality dog food.  It doesn't need to be Innova (although it is a good food)...but there are a lot of better quality dog foods out there.  They are more expensive, but if you really loved your dog, you wouldn't feed them by-products that come from unknown animals. <br>  <br>  I recently asked a question about switching my dogs food and here are some other foods that were recommended.....<br>  <br>  Innova<br>  Timberwolf Organics<br>  Solid Gold<br>  Natural Balance<br>  Orijen<br>  Halo<br>  Wellness<br>  Wysong<br>  The Honest Kitchen<br>  <br>  I chose to switch my dog from one of the Dad's Healthy Lifestyles to Wellness Core (original formula).<br>  <br>  There is also this site....  <a href="http://www.dogfoodanalysis.com/dog_food_reviews/" rel="nofollow">http://www.dogfoodanalysis.com/dog_food_...</a>  You would want the 4, 5, and 6 starred dog foods from those lists.  The more stars it has, the better the food.  <br>  <br>  Whenever you switch the food over, don't just let him finish up what he has and then just give him the new food all at once.  You need to do it gradually.  If you keep it in a big container of some sort...mix in a little bit of the new food...give him some, then a few days later...mix in a little more.  Keep doing that until his food is completely the new food.  If you do it all at once, the dog could get sick.  Also, some dogs don't like certain types of food, so I would suggest buying maybe the smallest bag available...like 4 lbs or 5 lbs, which ever it may be.  That way, if he picks out the new food, you don't lose 30 bucks or more on say 20 lbs of food.<br>  <br>  Good luck!  :)|`|lB732Tiyaa	personally all my dogs get feed Royal Canin, specific to each breed. Although it's a bit pricier than the stuff you can pick up at Wal-Mart, it is really good for them. They have been on it since they were pups, then switched to adult food when they were around 1 and a half years old.|`|TRganQA4aa	I would feed him Innova Large Breed Puppy food - way better for him - then go to Innova when he is a year to a year and a half.|`|qzPZf2XPaa	Your breeder doesn't know what they are talking about.<br>  Go buy some Innova or EVO now and gradually change it.<br>  Purina... That's junk food that'll kill your dog slowly.
1zn2yKjJaa	If your puppy is doing fine than dont worry about it. Purina is a good brand, my puppy eats the same thing. Switching your puppies food can cause problems with thier bowel movements, so if you do switch, mix the two together slowly putting in a little more of the new and less of the old until you have all new food. Do this over a couple days. Very slowly. Anyways, Puppies are like babies and they are going to sleep a lot.|`|8584e0329fb17c662606d5a6a8650ee2aa	Your puppy at 6 weeks is too young to be away from its mother - 8 weeks is bare minimum, so your breeder is not a good one to take advice from.  Talk to your vet about caring for such a young puppy that should not yet be away from mom and litter.|`|AA11244754	Purina is a good quality dog food stay on the puppy food and please be sure that you are giving your puppy the dry because that is a lot better for their little teeth that are still hardening.|`|GaL66jbQaa	I would switch! Purina has to many fillers like grain and gluten which can cause skin problems and allergies later.  Honestly I would never buy from a breeder that feeds purina.|`|426c98c5e6499e1f282c417b905cea60aa	The puppy is too young, whether you want to believe it or not, therefore making the breeder not "amazing".  Are the parents registered? show proven champions? health checked for hips and elbow dysplasia and genetic eye disease?  At 6 weeks old a pup still needs to be with it's mom and siblings, no matter how independent it seems.<br>  <br>  Back to point, switch the food.|`|lTsDwY9Paa	Definitely switch, your dog will live a longer, happier, healthier life because of it. Innova is a higher quality than Blue Buffalo, so I'd go with that. Remember to switch him over slowly by mixing the new food in with the old for a week or two so he doesn't get an upset stomach.

During that stage some (much) of the life on it dies off and rots in/on the rock.Some places cycle it for you so you can put it in a stocked tank.<br>  As for what you will see, it will depend on the rock, and your tank-especially lighting. With the right conditions, you may see macroalgae, small corals or polyps,sponges, lots of copopods and amphipods.  Bristle worms. All od which are good to have. You can also get some crabs and a few other things as well.<br>  The thing to do, is to go to your tank at night, when the lights have been out for an hours or more, and peek in with a flashlight. many of the critters are nocturnal.

97cea69af418b36fa64d887915f51776aa	Hello, first of all congratulations on you pregnant platies. Every fish has it's own personality and it's hard to tell for sure when they will have the babies (fry) for sure. Some gets really huge and others do not. I have took a video of one of my female platy when she was only three days away from giving birth, so take a look:<br>  <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5GrKfuZTSU4" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5GrKfuZTS...</a> <br>  <br>  <br>  If your platy looks like that you need to place her either in a separate tank or in a breeding box called Lee's Multi-Purpose 3-Way Breeders and it looks like this:<a href="http://www.petco.com/product/7449/Lee-s-Multi-Purpose-3-Way-Breeders.aspx" rel="nofollow">http://www.petco.com/product/7449/Lee-s-...</a><br>  You should place her there as soon as possible and feed her as usual so that she doesn't get stressed out by being bothered my other fish.<br>  <br>  I would strongly recommend that breeding box because platies do eat their fry as soon as they are born, but if you manage to get that breeding box the fry (babies) will be safe from the mothers reach because there's a separator that keeps the babies from mother as soon as they are born....You should remove the mother from that box as soon as she is finished (she will look really skinny)<br>  <br>  I have a video of my platy (the pregnant one) when she had fry, so that you can see how the fry are kept in that breeding box: <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mM0Uo-a22uU" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mM0Uo-a22...</a><br>  Note that it took my platy 28 days after mating to have babies<br>  <br>  You should buy a food for the fry called "first bite" : <a href="http://www.petco.com/product/10906/Hikari-First-Bites.aspx" rel="nofollow">http://www.petco.com/product/10906/Hikar...</a> and feed them it three times a day, for about 3-4 weeks and then you can crush some flakes in a ziplock bag into small pieces and feed them. After about 1 month and a weeks you can move them into another tank (not the same as their parents or other big fish) so that they will have more room to grow....When you notice that they are about half of the size of their parents, you can put them in that tank if you like, but note that they do breed like crazy so i would recommend keeping the male from female once they get big if you don't want more babies, but if you do, just leave them all there....Well i talked about but this is really all you need to know, good luck and don't forget that platies fry need a heater just in-case you don't have one and keep it around 77 degrees Fahrenheit|`|ZynsCbudaa	lol dont worry, SOME of us know that. She will prolly give birth any day now!! You know to give them baby brine shrimp, and when they get big enough, you can give them flake food and put them in witht he parents!! Congrats and good luck.|`|JDvf6oIUaa	Fish lay eggs...they don't give birth...soo she may be over fed or have something else wrong with her.|`|uGt4eJUyaa	I'd say she'll give birth anytime....but careful she eats her babies
09e41Hdwaa	Since you just got it you should give it a week or two to settle in.  It still has to get used to you and its new environment.  Right now I would sit near the cage and talk to it, maybe read out loud to it, and give it lots of yummy treats.  After a few weeks start teaching it to get used to your hand and to step up.  You don't want to overwhelm it!|`|Gr6Xe1gGaa	Give your parakeet more time to settle into its new environment. About a week. Here are a few tips you will need to talk to your parakeet in a clam voice so your budgie/parakeet can know you are a nice person and will not hurt it. If you want your parakeet to really perch on your finger and not bite you, you will have to get your parakeet to like your hand. Everytime you change your parakeets food and water do it slowly and quietly not fast and loud. Try putting your hand in the birds with a treat. That treat can be spray millet (a healthy treat that all pet birds should love you can but it at a pet store). At first your parakeet will be a little scared of it, but it will soon get used to it and eat from your hand. Do that for about 10 minutes a day. Parakeets need interaction for about 30 minutes to an hour a day for it to like you. For more information and all the information about parakeet try looking this book at your local library or bookstore. The book is called, "Your Happy Healthy Parakeet 2nd Edition. Or you can ask an avian vet, a breeder or a worker at a pet store that know about birds. I hope this helps.

I love the dynamic that the stripes give my tanks, I love how they school together. I also love that they are smaller for a semi aggressive fish, but not easily intimidated. If I put my hand in the tank, to clean the glass, or whatever, they swim right up to see what I'm doing. When I put my face up to the glass, they all school right up to the glass to look at me. I have 8, most websites say to keep at least 6, I have found 8 to be a good number. They are less aggressive when there is more of them. I also have them in with a rainbow shark, some rosy barbs & opaline gouramis, but my tank is a 46.

The little teeth on the larger claw seem to imply age. The more teeth, the older the hermit crab. Of course, size is another factor. Jumbo hermit crabs (softball size and larger) are estimated to be between 15 and 50 years old.

I've never really researched this, so I have no idea how true this is, but that's what I've heard.  Also, generally (and this isn't always the case), the larger it is, the older it is.  Jumbo crabs are all old (no crab is born that big), but some crabs grow at such a miniscule rate each molting cycle that a small can be older than a medium, but the medium grew faster.
Apisf1gAaa	No, please don't. All paint is toxic to hermit crabs. "Non-Toxic" is non-toxic paint for us, who have much larger and complicated digestive systems. It is toxic for them, although it will not immediately kill them, it will slowly kill them.  The paint WILL chip and the hermit crabs WILL eat it.<br>  <br>  Please, please, please just stick to all-natural shells and don't buy "fancy" hermit crabs. They force the hermit crabs into the shells, so they're often too small, and the crabs are waaay stressed out. Also, the paint chips and the crabs will eat the chips and that's toxic.<br>  <br>  Please remember that hermit crabs are living, breathing creatures, and not art projects. Don't do anything to them along those lines that you wouldn't do to your dog (you wouldn't paint him or stick rhinestones on him, would you?). There are plenty of other ways to be creative when dealing with hermit crabs, like personalizing your tank with home-made toys, like homemade cocohuts, hand-knit climbing hemp rope (the rope needs to be hemp or all-natural), and similar things.|`|r0u26SYGaa	if you want to kill your hermit crabs go ahead: but when they die After a few years you will say that the don't live long and that they make bad pets. so i wouldn't recommend it. they eat everything they walk and go on: they were eating part of my moss vine! so the answer in no|`|OAzJPUkHaa	No, the paint itself is harmful for the crabs to ingest.

Apisf1gAaa	It's really simple...  Feed them your leftovers!!  They eat fruits, veggies, meat, and seafood.  Give them slices of apple, pieces of cooked, non-seasoned, non-salted meats, and the like.  Some people get a freeze-dryer and freeze-dry their food to make their own "kibble."  You can also buy "kibble" from places like the crabbage patch, and the happy hermit crab (i've included links in my sources).  Although I've never bought there, I know they're reputable sources.    I usually just stick to good old fresh food.<br>  <br>  Mine enjoy:<br>  - Apples<br>  - Bananas<br>  - Potato<br>  - Turkey<br>  - Olives<br>  - Honey<br>  - Blood worms<br>  - Spinach<br>  - Shrimp<br>  <br>  And just a suggestion: If your hermies don't seem to interested in whatever you serve them, try serving it again to them at a later date. What you think they didn't like (hell, what THEY think they didn't like) they might love the second time around. Hermies are odd like that. Mine didn't like bananas the first time, but the second time I gave it to them like a month later they couldn't get enough...<br>  <br>  And here are some other suggestions:<br>  Hermit Crab Food Favorites<br>  Hermit crabs enjoy certain foods that are high in nutrients and can also satisfy them with a certain taste.

AA10534526	I had a Three Spot Gourami that got along fine with my 9 danios.<br>  <br>  Ah sorry but I don't know about the snail with this three spot, I've never had a snail with one before.<br>  <br>  Edit: Sparkling Gourami is also a extremely peaceful fish and gets to be about1.5 in. Most gourami are peaceful when kept one species at a time. Pearl Gourami is a beautiful choice too, and gets to be about 5 inches. Just keep them singly or they may fight sometimes. I have a flame dwarf gourami and it's beautiful and never messes with any other fish in the tank.|`|KAjFbpyAaa	a dwarf or honey,sunset dwarf would be best. They might pick at the snail though. Most kinds should work because of the size of the tank but I would only recommend one gourami per tank
bDPVRtCNaa	1. Yes. It is okay to house similarly sized frogs together. <br>  2. I would house only three. They are large bodied frogs and would appreciate the room.<br>  3. Very difficult. In breeding season the males will develop pads on their thumbs, but otherwise the males and females are identical. Both males and females will call.<br>  4. The tfh Tree Frogs book by Devin Edmonds describes the breeding process, and if you plan on breeding I recommend you buy this book.<br>  <br>  ~You may house males and females together without them breeding. A pair has to be specially conditioned to breed, and the pair is moved to a rain chamber to spawn. Odds are you won't know whether or not you have males or females. Behavior can sometimes show which you have: where and how they call are helpful cues. A male will call longer, while a female will give a few quick croaks.|`|bFzu835Aaa	--Yes they can be housed together<br>  --I would keep it to 2-3, they can get big and enjoy their space<br>  --It's actually rather difficult to sex them<br>  --Breeding requires a bit of special care and a much larger tank<br>  <br>  <br>  Yes you can normally house males and females together without an issue. The only time problems usually arise with these guys is when you try to house too many in too small a tank.|`|pspRQ9KAaa	I would Say up to 4 for a 40 gallon tank. Yes, they can be housed together. WTFs are actually social animals. I dont know about sexing WTFs. Its fairly easy to breed them, and no you cant really house them together without them breeding or fighting.
SiPZHrn4aa	I personally have two of the animals on that list - the crested gecko and the fire skink.<br>  <br>  Amphibians are great, but you cannot hold them really ever.  That is something you will have to keep in mind.  They are still fabulous and magnificent animals either way.  Out of the two you listed, I much prefer horned (pac man) frogs.  Fantasy frogs are my favorite pac mans, but I do like Argentines too.<br>  <br>  I personally like geckos more than any other reptiles and amphibians, but fire skinks are great too.<br>  <br>  Crested geckos have a very calm and low-key deameanor.  They will sit in your hand and hang out with you.  They require a large and tall terrrarium with lots of plants, vines, and branches.  They are nocturnal and won't be seen much during the day.  They can be fed off of a specially formulated meal replacement powder called Crested Gecko Diet (or CGD).<br>  <br>  Fire skinks are a large robust lizard that love to burrow.  These terrestrial African lizards will need at least a 20 gallon long terrarium.  They are active during the day and will pop in and out of the dirt and bask in UV lights.  Insects and pureed fruits (baby food) will make a good diet for these lizards.  They can be nice, they can be mean, you have a much better chance of getting a nice one if you get a captive bred.<br>  <br>  <br>  All the animals you listed are great - hardy, beautiful, and unique.|`|ybf1g89jaa	None.

AA12106467	If you are going to put your rabbit on the ground then alfalfa, timothy, and red or white clover would be good grasses to plant.  Alfalfa and clover are higher in protein and timothy is higher in fiber.  Both of which a rabbit needs.<br>  <br>  Be careful though of putting a rabbit cage directly on the ground, that makes it easier for predators to get your rabbit by digging under the cage like a raccoon, dog, skunk, or coyote.|`|NleWQOqyaa	common grass out in your lawn........just as long as there are no pesticides in/on it, my rabbit likes alfalfa. or timothey hay, or reg.hay|`|8C1a8uhpaa	alfalfa! also, hay is good, just make sure it isn't like, cow hay, good quality hay they looove.

They're quite beautiful and very intelligent. They usually live to 2 years and are very easy to take care off. All you have to buy are marbles, live plants, food (pellets/flakes), treats (bloodworms), conditioner, and general medication. All that probably costs less than 15 dollars at Petsmart. Of course, that's just the bare minimum.<br>  <br>  What separates them from other fishes are their intelligence and playfulness. However, you can only keep one in your tank. If you wanted more than one fish, betta fish get along well with:<br>  <br>  Gravel Cleaners<br>  1. Corydoras Catfish – These fishes are perfect option for unfiltered tanks as like betta these fishes also swim up for a guzzle of air. They will also keep your gravel clean by separating and excavating around for additional food and other things. In view of the fact that these fishes prefer company, the most excellent thing will be to have groups of three corys. If three is not possible, then it should be at least in the group of two. Don't forget to place some caves or other hideouts for these cats.<br>  <br>  2. African Dwarf Frogs – These companions are again great gravel cleaners. African Dwarf frogs are actually underwater amphibians. At frequent intervals they swim up to the surface of water for guzzle of air, and also don't require any filter. You have to provide it with a cave or a rock in which it can make hole and a floating plant. They will time and again hang still at the surface, for no matter what reason, or move stealthily in around the decoration.<br>  <br>  3. Ghost Shrimp– They are used as a companion mostly because they are a fun to watch. However, betta used to eat them most of the times. You can't put salt or medications in these tanks. These shrimps are the perfect choice for the betta fish owners with small tanks.<br>  <br>  Algae Eaters<br>  1. Otocinclus - these small wall suckers are wonderful for taking away algae from your tank walls, plants and decorations. Extremely calm and attractive, and will also guzzle air if you don't have a filter in your tank. Bettas can create problem for them, if they are feeling tired of something, so make available a hidey hole. Oto Cats prefer the company of their own kind, but won't hang around if they are alone.<br>  <br>  2. Chinese Algae Eaters– These were very attractive initially, they get violent when they grow-up. They also become quite big.<br>  <br>  3. Livebearers– They will throw away algae, although this isn't truly their specialty.<br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|qUGVYNItaa	bettas definitely. they are cheap, but most of the time dont get along with other fish. Maybe try tetras or guppies. I know betta are cheap, but never put more than 3 in a tank. If you put in more than one beta, or at all, put alot of hollow logs or plants. betta like to fight , so other bettas or fish need hiding spots.|`|a1wly9wRaa	Some kind of tetra would be good. They need to be in small schools of 6 or more.|`|dR8B5AfIaa	any kind but not to big and make the tank pretty and colorful hope that helped:)

Y5WJWnvbaa	Firstly they will expect your horse to be turned out in a manner appropriate to the class you have entered into.<br>  <br>  If you are showing in a general cob class, the standard is a hogged mane, a banged and pulled tail [bandaged before competing], and clean fetlocks, whiskers and ears. <br>  <br>  If you are showing a native cob, Section D etc, the mane should be pulled to a reasonable length, whiskers and ears still trimmed, fetlocks left in a natural state, and the tail should be lightly pulled, banged and bandaged.<br>  <br>  You also need to make sure you have on appropriate attire - both you, and your horse. A good bridle, with wide, flat cheekpieces and a plain noseband is required for cobs, and you yourself should be dressed in smartly.<br>  <br>  When walking out with the rest of the class, they will be looking to see if your horse is well-behaved, and what it's gait is like against the others in the ring.<br>  <br>  When standing for the judge before you do your individual walk and trot out, the judge will closely examine conformation. With a cob, they are looking for a good amount of bone below the knee, a good girth [but not fat!], a well-rounded crest, an apple-shaped rear end, a good size eye and nostrils, and good shoulders.<br>  <br>  They will also check for injuries, such as splints etc.<br>  <br>  When walking/trotting out, they are looking for straight action - no dishing etc.<br>  <br>  As you trot out, try to run as fast as you can, whilst still maintaining a good trot, so they judge can see fully what the action [in cobs, knee action especially] is like.<br>  <br>  I hope this has given you a rough idea!|`|RUzBDX6Jaa	You have to smile at the judge while they examine your horse.  That's a big thing. And you have to ALWAYS be facing them while you are halted.  and, just good grooming, a nice halter, and the right clothing on your part, and clipped (preferably full body) and just looking GOOD.|`|EghHVkHEaa	Do you mean halter show?|`|sLhwyMw9aa	1st make sure to enter a in hand cob class, or if there is not one of them then a condition in hand class. <br>  Make sure that your horse is turned out to the very best a freshly hogged mane and a good pulled tail, you can put quarter markers on to show off the cobs rear end, tidy the  fetlock hair up and use chalk to whiten any white socks use a small amount of baby oil around its eyes and nostrils and make sure his private areas are clean,<br>  The judge will be looking for conformation, condition, you will have to walk the horse away from the judge and turn on the turn go into a very brisk trot back to the judge the judge will have a feel of your horses legs and check it from the back  {hocks} and ask its age and breeding.practise the trot up at home and get a friend to run there hands over the horse.<br>  you need to be smartly turned out with a hard hat on show jacket boots and jodphurs. hope this helps you happy showing and always remember if you don't do well another day a different judge :)|`|RgDdC8vbaa	Judges look for how well you and your horse work together, they want to see you and your horse cleaned up very very very well, every little thing counts, even your how precise your horses clipping job counts. They want to see your horse listen to what you say and do it when you ask them to and that they do it well, if you have a pattern they expect you to complete every aspect of it so study it well and be very precise, your horse should follow along side you you at walk and trot and you should drag him or have to hold him back, i am assuming you will have to set his body up for inspection so make sure he can do it well and fast.|`|3a1e378691e31e4af23432441a473407aa	Good behaviour, leading up, turning and halting nice and square.<br>  <br>  Conformation, whether your youngster comes up to the standards of the breed.<br>  <br>  Nice turn out.  At two years and with a mane, you may or may not plait.  It depends on his breed.  If it is a Welsh Cob which naturally has a long thick mane, and it is in good condition, you may want to leave it free, or do a running plait.<br>  <br>  Turn out of the handler.<br>  <br>  You might do well to take your fella to a few shows without competing beforehand and let him experience the sights and sounds and smells of a show.  If he did not have these experiences he might explode on first outing!|`|wKCgaoZVaa	Hi, just another note to add : no matter how much its used in shows, it is cruel to the horse to cut the whiskers and hair inside the ears. The hair inside the ears protects them from getting flies and dust in them, and the whiskers are a vital part for horses to feel around them, so chopping them off makes it so unnatural.<br>  <br>  Hope this helps =)

You say you feed him a few baby carrotts but still I would reduce this to one or maybe even just half a carrot as this seems the cause. Do you find that it smells? Another important thing is that you check that the poop isn't getting stuck to it's feet or *private* area as this could lead to maggots ! Not nice LOL,  so it's also important that you clean his hutch regulaly. Also reduce the amount of hay to around half a hand full per day and don't feed him TOO much food or fresh fruit or veg. Hope this helps. Have fun with your bunny! X
H0fXySX9aa	In its native habitat, the keyhole cichlid is a stream-dweller found in areas of reduced water flow and abundant cover in the form of fallen branches, leaves and sometimes flooded terrestrial vegetation. In the aquarium, it is a relatively easy habitat to simulate. Start with a layer of sand or fine gravel, and add a number of small twigs and several smaller pieces of driftwood. Plants are optional, but an aquarium with a mixture of wood pieces and plants tends to look more pleasing than one without them. Add the plants in groupings, being sure to leave a number of open areas for the cichlids to explore and forage. Lighting can be relatively modest, assuming the needs of any plants used in the aquarium are met.<br>  <br>  Filtration need not be anything overly complicated or particularly powerful. Although keyhole cichlids can grow to 5 inches, food intake and subsequent waste generation are modest. I’d suggest an appropriately sized hang-on-the-back power filter or canister filter, depending on your preference and perhaps a simple air-driven box filter for added insurance (if the power filter stops working for some reason). Perhaps more important than the type of filter you decide to use (as long as it is sized correctly) is a schedule of regular water changes. I’d suggest that for a 48-gallon with the bioload I suggest below, you change about 50 percent of the water every seven to 10 days. The only other maintenance items I’d specifically suggest you keep an eye on are things like temperature (should be between 78 and 83 degrees Fahrenheit.) and pH (ideally between 6.0 and 7.0). As for the number of fish, you could start out with a group of six young keyhole cichlids. However, as they grow and pair off, I’d suggest reducing that number down to a maximum of four. Add to that a small group of more surface-oriented species like silver hatchetfish (Gasteropelecus sternicla) or perhaps a few mid-water species like the larger Hyphessobrycon species, such as bleeding heart tetras or lemon tetras, and you’d have an interesting aquarium and one perfectly suited to the keyhole cichlids. Best of luck with them|`|65baadde1a27b20964ccb07ad83092e0aa	I have 2 and they are great peaceful fish.  They get along with each other and any other peaceful fish. Mine are sick right now its a long story but they are hardy fish for the most part.  I highly recommend them if these little guys don't make it I will definitely get another pair.<br>  <br>  You can keep to male together no problem. if you have a male and female they are easy to spawn. they are not colorful they look like racoons to me.  but what they lack in color they make up for in personality,   When mine were feeling better they would come right up to my face every time I went over to say hi.  I love them. <br>  <br>  Mine are doing better I'm keeping my figures crossed.

You should feel lucky that you even get to be around horses, some people aren't as privileged as to do so. Maybe you should just do only one, practice really hard until you are good enough to really benefit from showing. Be sure you actually have the skills to win something before you spend all that money.|`|3wIZiZA5aa	I understand your situation. My dad is like that also. The best thing to do is not bug him about it for the next week or so. Then, one weekend morning, get up before he does, make breakfast, coffee, etc. and serve him breakfast in bed. Basically, be a suck up. When he's done eating, start up a conversation. Generally slip in the horse shows into the conversation, and ask him nicely if you can go to both. Point out good reasons why to go to the shows, e.g. they build confidence, get me out of my comfort zone, meet new ppl, a new experience, ect. DON'T be whiney or roll your eyes or anything if he says no. Just say ok Dad, that's fine, and walk off, but be nice about it. It will show your dad that your mature enough to accept his answer, and maybe, just maybe, he will reconsider his answer. <br>  <br>  Hope this Helps!|`|4884c661c8938910239d7729a16fc338aa	Offer to pay or help pay for one of the shows.

dd29142df42d00c2832dc987bcd6b003aa	Broody hens are set to incubate eggs not always their own,sometimes even eggs of other types of poultry ,you put the eggs in a safe & convenient place with a layer of soft hay under the eggs,& place the hen so she sees where she  needs to settle down for the next few weeks,some broody hens are very docile & even walk right to the eggs & set themselves to incubate,others need to be persuaded a bit,while  still others just will not take to new / strange surroundings.<br>  In India where i live many village folk,cover a setting hen with a loosely woven roomy wide basket,moving it away when the hen needs to leave the nest box ,after a few days she gets the idea & stays  put over the eggs. All depends on the hens temprament you should be prepared to take a few risks along the way .|`|K5IOSGXAaa	If you disturb the nest she will most likely abandon it. You can try to move it right in front of her so she sees you doing it, and then she may not abandon it, but it is a very slim chance.|`|AA11853243	If you move her you will disturb her and she may reject her eggs. I would suggest that you try to make where she is as safe as possible and let her finish. The only alternative is to take her eggs and let her start over.|`|tcvQwTa5aa	I have moved hens and their eggs before and everything was fine.I guess you'll just have to take your chances.I've also had a hen decide to sit on a pile of fertile duck eggs(from the ducks we have of course)and she sat on them and hatched them and was walking aound with baby ducks like they were her own.She would even take them to the pond to swim after dark,maybe she was just going along with them on that)It was the cutest thing!

Just don't leave them alone together without you there. Now that your dog as had cats around for awhile i really wouldn't worry about him.

GK57zwmSaa	Its way to early to be able to tell if the dog is pregnate. If you weren't planing on these puppies you can get your dog spayed which is way to terminate if it is possible she may be preagnate. Start doing lots of research if this is the first litter for your dog there are chances of things going wrong. There are many information websites available. I would call your vet and they too can help you on the right path. Signs to watch for are and increase in food intake, as well as they can get morning sickness just like humans they do tend to become big sucks to one person as well. You've got alot ahead of you if your expecting puppies good luck!|`|guVczXfUaa	If a vet can't tell if she's pregnant, then all of us out here on answers surely won't know.  You'll just have to be patient, and ask your vet both what to look for and when to start looking.  He/she can tell you how soon is early enough to tell, and what signs would give indication.<br>  <br>  I'm sorry, I have to add:<br>  SPAY YOUR DOG!!!|`|AA11244754	research it using your search bar yourself|`|PM23RDycaa	Yes its too early to tell. Have her spayed and don't worry about it.

But thinking it must be something harm full to animals :)    Try taking it off and go to another shelter, there are lots of them out there you just have to look around.  You could also try asking on Craig's list for a puppy.  I'm sure someone out there has puppies they want to give away.|`|8C1a8uhpaa	1 they are idiots for turning you down because of that...just because you like a sports player doesn't mean you are going to try to fight the mutt you get at the humane society. Thats like saying someone is going to run around making sex tapes because they bought Paris Hilton perfume or something.<br>  #2 you are not going to find a cheap dog anywhere. Dogs are just not cheap pets. No pet is a cheap pet. Dogs require a lot of money in vet bills, food, toys, damage control etc. They need vaccines, check ups, and emergency vet visits. Also you still have to pay an $80 pet placement fee if you adopt a dog. <br>  <br>  My advice? If you still want a dog, look in the newspaper, and get one. or craigslist. Beware though, make sure the place you are getting it from is reputable otherwise you might end up with a sickly pup. But please dont get a dog if you can't afford to pay $1200 and up vet bills. It'll only lead to trouble. If you are getting the dog for security reasons, get an alarm system, it'll save you money on your house insurance, and be less expensive in the long run. (I'm just trying to cover all the bases, I'm not saying you are getting a dog for security reasons) Also if you want a cheap pet, adopt a cat or something, cats are nice, not all of them are as aloof as people think. Good Luck!|`|QDQwKbM6aa	You could look in the newspaper they should have some listings<br>  <br>  Good luck!  :]|`|F3LBgfvwaa	If you're "on a low budget" maybe it's not a good idea to have a dog!

And a very Strong filter. <br>  <br>  You can only put 4 goldfish in your 50 gallon without it being VERY overstocked|`|Nzb5QmNXaa	As Elizabeth said, you really need to do research on your fish before you buy them. They are not called comic goldfish. They are either common or comet that you bought. I'm assuming they are the feeder goldfish you bought. Those fish get a foot long EACH. For just one goldfish you need 35 gallons and 10 gallons for each additional goldfish. That means that you need at least a 425 gallon tank for 40 comet goldfish. This variety of goldfish usually is put into ponds like koi fish.<br>  <br>  The reason your fish die every time you do a water change is for the following reasons:<br>  <br>  Your tank is vastly overcrowded. As in an elephant in a room the size of a watermelon.<br>  <br>  You aren't changing the water often enough. With such an overcrowded tank, you should be doing 50% water changes 4 times a day at least. You need to use a water conditioner/declorinator every single time that you do a water change. They will continue to die if you do not do enough water changes without treating the water.<br>  <br>  Waiting "until they get older" is stupid. Sorry to say, but you are only killing your fish. They will all become stunted. This means that their outsides will stop growing while their insides keep growing. It would be like having all your insides squished into a two-year old.<br>  <br>  Either rehome your fish or get a pond/425 gallon + tank. If you need more help with fishkeeping, go to tetra-fish.com/forums|`|QDQwKbM6aa	In the first place you shouldn't have too many fish or they get over crowded and die. If you do have that many fish buy a big enough tank so the fish have room.<br>  <br>  Good luck! :]|`|iZeDcrASaa	make sure you de-chrolinate tap water, and dont take out 80 percent but 20percent and also add a filter if you havent got one
c15rWijuaa	You would start by contacting the shelter, or rescue that has the pet. They will be able to tell you whether or not they do adoption out of area or state or how far they adopt out to. <br>  <br>  It can differ greatly from organization to organization. I know of some that will only adopt to people within the city and are hard pressed to adopt to someone in another city, even if it's the next on over. Others would be happy to adopt to you and work with you to find a way to get the pet to you. Some even driving to meet you half way. Though I will tell you, any rescue organization will require you to pick up the dog in person. THEY WILL NOT SHIP ONE TO YOU. SO be prepared to do traveling if you really want this pet.<br>  <br>  After you find out what their adoption policies are, you will usually fill out an application, be approved (filling out the application doesn't guarantee you the pet, they can deny you), usually pass a home inspection, some will require that if you have any other pets that they and this new pet meet and that they get along before being approved and after all that, if things check out, you fill out the adoption papers and you get to take your new family member home. There is always an adoption fee, usually averaging out around $100-$150, some even reaching $250-$300.|`|TSc8OE4vaa	It depends on the rescue.  Most won't let you adopt it, some might let you drive out to adopt it.  None will ship the pet to you.|`|Bw18seFqaa	depends on the rescue..  some will only adopt to people within the area..  some will make arrangements to adopt out of state.<br>  <br>  Contact the rescue.|`|24CFl7sjaa	I think it all depends if they can find someone willing to home check in your area, some have more volunteer helpers in lots of areas who are willing to do this. You would still have to collect yourself though as it would be unreasonable to expect them to bear the cost of shipping the animal to you and they would want to meet you anyway.|`|3fcf101a2615a631d556e32ec980eae0aa	You would have to contact whatever shelter has that animal and ask what their policies are.  Many shelters will not adopt outside a set radius of their area...but some will.  Just going to have to call and ask.|`|bJh1MesQaa	You have to pay to ship it. Sometimes the humane society will ship it for free.|`|PkK6pAkwaa	Contact the rescue or shelter listed at the bottom of the page. Be aware that some shelters and rescues have policies in place to only allow adoptions to people in the immediate area.

Drop 20 or 30 or so feeder guppies or small goldfish or minnows they maybe a bit fast for babies at first just drop in the tank and watch them disappear in a few days!|`|vS1Z0inOaa	I don't really recommend doing that. I have a recipe which works really well, but it's for force feeding sick turtles. Basically all it is is pureed greens, canned salmon, little dog food, carrots, alfalfa, and calcium with vitamin D all mixed together. Works good as a base and if you must have it, I can send you the recipe. However, it sinks to the bottom and turtles only look for food that either floats on the surface or moves in the water, which is why I use it for force feeding only. Also I'm sure your map turtle will enjoy eating real greens and live minnows much more than the pureed equivalent. The processed turtle food should never make up more than 15% of his diet anyway, and you really don't need to give it to him at all as long as he's getting those minnows and a good variety of greens and has a cuttlebone to chew on.
TWeUG8ukaa	Should have no problems breeding them just as long as you have a male and female pair.  They are excellent parents.  Do not touch the eggs or the babies.  Be prepare to hand feed the babies just in case they do not feed them.  <br>  <br>  Society Finches are great foster parents.  Some breeders keep societies on hand in case some other birds are bad parents.<br>  <br>  Society Finches multiply without assistance. <br>  <br>  I started with two about a year and half ago and now currently own 6 but gave two away.  Within 4 years, my sister in law has over 14 of there birds.<br>  <br>  The male sings.  The female doesn't.  <br>  <br>  Do you have any bedding in the nest?|`|xzCNdoJ0aa	Pucnh a cat dog thing in the face dawg for shizzel my na sizzle
TJBFBRZuaa	Not to worry; mother guinea pigs will not reget their babies if handled. Regarding the lotion... was it heavily scented? If so, that may be the problem. Try gently rubbing some of the bedding onto the babies and see if that helps. After that, just wait it out. The mother will eventually realize that these are her babies and will allow them to nurse again. Don't worry, they won't die from lack of milk. Good luck!|`|oNHtVHzsaa	i would think she might be scared that you picked up the babies. she may think that they are not hers. try not to pick up the babies and let her take care of it. it also may have been the scent on your hands. you could have changed the scent on them and changed her thoughts. im pretty sure she will go back to being their mother. good luck
PM23RDycaa	If you want a good pedigree purebred dog start showing your female in the show ring and then you will find a good stud to pair her up with. If she's not registered, not a show or work dog and hasn't had the proper genetic clearances she doesn't need to be bred.

2CbfO4jWaa	i feel that some of my captives DEFINITELY remember negative experiences (for instance a ball of mine gets defensive whenever my daughter is around thanks to a very bad handling experience years ago.) snakes will also remember how they escaped from an enclosure and will do it over and over again in even faster times(remembering how they got out? maybe that explains the faster escape times?) also i have a large white sided black rat that will never again eat rats since it got a bad bite from 1 in the past. (again remembering the bad experience maybe?)<br>  <br>  p.s.  "i do feed her in a separate tank because i have heard that they will always think its time to feed every time you open the tank and my strike you(if fed in housing tank).".....................this is just newbie b.s. just feed your snake in its enclosure and just make sure that when your taking it out for what ever, you let it know that its not feeding time by taping it on nose with some newspaper or something. feeding in a separate container associates handling with feeding and that is when you get bit. but what do i know? im just a monitor guy!hahahaha!<br>  <br>  i figured "chopper" would enjoy this tid bit from a k.s.forum. kinda relates since its about snake behavior and intelligence (ability to learn and choose): <br>  <br>  <br>  Posted by: FR at Thu Dec 25 10:08:25 2008  [ Report Abuse ] [ Email Message ]<br>  <br>  Your perfect, you think animals are only parts that work, no brain, no thoughts, no learning, nothing more then parts. Your a biologist. <br>  <br>  All I got to say is, good thing there are ethlogist, you know, those who specialist in behavior. Those that think in a little different way. Those that think animals actually BEHAVE. <br>  <br>  <br>  I will take back the part about you being a biologist or scientists. Because if you were, you would have asked about the situations I stated. U know, about finding snakes in groups. If you did, I would have stated that the simple Pat answer you state, you know, thermoregulation bit, is huey. As those animals had the exact same choices ALL over the area they are in. <br>  <br>  Instead, they attract to eachother for reasons OTHER THEN mechanical. A biologist would ask questions, not just state NAIVE come backs. <br>  <br>  Anyone with a brain can tell snakes do have different personalities. They and inherent knowledge(instint) they have learning knowledge. And they do make decisions. They do make choices, both for biological reasons and behavioral reasons. <br>  <br>  So while you think your responce was effective, it was not, its very naive. Try again. Try asking questions instead of popping off. hahahahahahahahaha Cheers|`|8i90ov0Gaa	No, they have a poor memory. Their brains are very simple and not developed like those of mammals and birds. As for feeding in a separate tank, that is a beginner practice and a myth that it makes them less aggressive. No biologists, zoo keepers, or breeders feed their snakes in separate enclosures. If you feed them in a separate enclosure, every time you get them out to handle them, they think it's feeding time and are more likely to bite. I feed all of my 150 snakes in their enclosures and never get bitten, because soon as I get them out, they know it's not feeding time and calm down. If they're a little feisty, I just use a snake hook and they instantly calm down. Also, I use feeding tongs so they never see my hand during feeding time anyway. Here's a link that says a separate enclosure for feeding is a waste of time: <a href="http://proexotics.com/FAQ2.html#snakes_feedingtub" rel="nofollow">http://proexotics.com/FAQ2.html#snakes_f...</a>|`|TkJn9gO0aa	Hahahaha! <br>  <br>  I'll make it a Triumvirate and agree with "Madsnakeman's" and "VARANID's" advice/insight.<br>  <br>  The only reason for feeding in a different cage that "holds water" in my opinion is to eliminate the risk of impaction...............but then, what the crap are you using as a substrate to be worried about ingestion and why is it being used? <br>  <br>  Snakes do have poor memories(when compared to specialized orders like mammals, but are able to "learn" quickly through association by simple culling out bad/fruitless information and using what worked/works.<br>  <br>  By feeding in a separate enclosure you are directly handling the snake prior to offering it food..........that sounds a lot like associative learning doesn't it?<br>  <br>  Even the most stubborn Reticulated Python will quickly realize that once its door/lid opens it is not feeding time by simply poking it(annoying it) with a snake hook or snake or a ball point stick. <br>  <br>  In fact, if the snake hasn't actually been fed yet, they are fairly easy to snap out of the feeding response. By feeding in a different enclosure, you HAVE to handle that snake yet again -Feeding Response set on "MAX".|`|RZrbejeLaa	Of course, like the first time they climbed a tree, went for  swim, lied out in the warm sun, and stuff like that.<br>  <br>  But seriously, snakes have excellent memories. Indigo snakes will travel many miles during breeding season, and yet every year I found the same three in less than a half acre space. I had pics and sketches of their head colorations for identification.<br>  <br>  Also, I had a yellow rat snake for over ten years. My brother was never able to hold her, but I was never bitten by her. She escaped once for three months. My brother found her coming from inside the sofa and she struck at him, but I went over and picked her up without a problem.<br>  <br>  Another incident was when one of my ball pythons was nipped on the nose by a rat. Even though I had fed her live rats for about two years before that, she never took a live rat again, she just tucked her head under her body and cowered. I had to go back to feeding her large mice and fresh killed rats.<br>  <br>  Just because animals may have small or simple brains, doesn't mean that they are not capable of certain abilities, in this case memorizing. I don't care what the "scientists" say, I have been dealing with snakes for almost thirty years.|`|AA11068019	They have a good memory and are extremely inquisitive

I would recommend you do that rather than going to a pet store because those are captive-born and healthier. The ones in a pet store are usually collected from the wild, extremely stressed out, and ill or carrying huge parasite loads. However, I cannot really suggest one place without knowing what kind of turtle you're wanting, and that' for you to say. What are you looking for in a turtle? Do you want a small one, a big one, one that lives in water, a box turtle, or a tortoise? Please do some research and tell me what you're wanting, and then I can help you decide on a specific kind and locate a breeder or rescue organization.

XurYYreBaa	It's not typical rat behavior but it's not really abnormal either.  1 or 2 of our rats have done this, especially when relatively young. Some rats even eat their own droppings in order to get nutrients that weren't absorbed the 1st time around.<br>  Maybe your rat is moving things around in order to get used to her new home. She could also be bored & simply playing with her poop.  Give her plenty of toys & attention.  Also, she'll be much happier if you adopt another female rat as a companion.|`|1YtcGLHraa	yes i think you really need another rat they get depressed then they will stop eating until tyhey starve to death unless you play with her 24/7 and it isnt bad tht shes doing this she is probably just getting things situated in her cage|`|a075ibDMaa	Shes probably bored and her "raisins" are like toys.

97cea69af418b36fa64d887915f51776aa	Breeding guppies is like the easiest thing to do because you don't have to do anything special at all, just make sure that your water changes are up to date and the everything is healthy. As long as you have males and females, they will breed without you doing anything at all it's that simple. Your major problem is those semi-aggressive fish you have, because if the females have the fry(babies) those fish are the ones that will eat them all, there for you will need to buy a breeding net to put those babies in there until they get big enough to not fit in any of your fish mouth. Note that even the guppies can eat their young when they are very small but will not harm them once they get too big to fit in their mouth, on the other hand the semi-aggressive one will chase, kill and eat the babies, so it's better to have the breeding net and another tank that is aorund 5 gallons to raise those fry. I have always used a baby food call "first bite" <a href="http://www.petco.com/product/10906/Hikari-First-Bites.aspx?CoreCat=OnSiteSearch" rel="nofollow">http://www.petco.com/product/10906/Hikar...</a> i feed them three times a day, and make sure that their water stays always clean. Once the get a little bigger you can crush flakes in a ziplock bag and feed it to them.|`|IrdZKYT3aa	Sounds like your tank is over stocked right now.  I'd stop were you are.<br>  What fish do you have specifically?  What are the semi aggressive?<br>  A guppy is slow moving, and their long tail fins are like a red cape before the bull.  They can't and shouldn't be housed with semi aggressive fish.<br>  As for breeding it's best to have 2-3 females for every male.  Males are a bit obsessive, harassing females pregnant or not.  Having multiple females allows them some down time from the male.  This relieves their stress and helps them to have healthy fry.<br>  Best of Luck!
IrdZKYT3aa	In a one gallon, nothing, your betta won't even be happy in there : (<br>  <br>  In a larger tank, you can heat it, a one gallon can;t be reliability heated.  Betta are tropical fish, they prefer their temps around 76-80 degrees.  They can TOLERATE being cold, but don;t WANT to be cold, and just like us, being to cold for too long can lead to a whole host of health issues.<br>  <br>  In a larger tank, with a heater and a filter betta get along fantastically with shrimp, otto cats and most sucker fish, cory cats, rasbora and platy's.  Most bottom feeders do fins with the betta's.<br>  Things to avoid are male guppy, molly, tetra, barbs, gourami, angel fish and other semi aggressive fish.  The betta will move slower than most fish and their long fins make them a target for aggressive fish.  Barbs, tetra and angel fish are fin nippers, a  danger for the males fins.  Gourami are a close cousin of the betta, and they will often fisht like two male betta.  Long fins, like that of the male guppy often incite the male betta's attack response, resulting in ripped fins.<br>  Goldfish are a bad idea as well.  They produce so much watse they risk the betta's heath, thier fins will blacken and shrival as they are burned from the goldfishs waste.  Also, water temps are too different for them to be truly happy.<br>  But it can also depend on the individual males personality and temperment, some just don't do well with other fish while others could care less.<br>  <br>  As for plants, live is always better, as long as you are prepared to handle them. Nothing spoils the water faster than poorly cared for plants.<br>  Plastic is a bad idea for betta as well, as they can tear thier fins, I found this out the hard way.  Instead, look into silk plants, they are safe for the betta and look pretty realistic!<br>  <br>  Best of Luck!|`|MpTZjdLJaa	depends what size<br>  ill go for a 10 gallon<br>  neon tetras because those are less active fish and are less likely to bother your betta<br>  get plastic plants becaue in my opinion, they look better and are easy to keep<br>  get ghost shrimp and snails and bammm, awesome tank|`|AA10534526	Crabs are generally brackish so I think you'll have the rule those out. Live plants are the best, just go to your local fish store and ask then what a good plant would be depending on their selection. Remember to wash your plants before you add them to the tank. Mollies, swords, platies and Rasboras will all do fine with your betta. Of course it's depending on the size of your tank.<br>  <br>  One gallon isn't enough even for a betta. I would plan of moving up before you add any fish. Bettas need at least 2.5 gallons and that's alone. Try 10 gallons if you want to add more fish.<br>  <br>  Edit: And while plastic plants may look cooler sometimes, go for live plants. It'll make your betta happier. Of course wait before you have a bigger tank to add any fish.|`|MPQI8Bg3aa	What size tank do you have? That makes a big difference in what you can add to the tank...

This is a must pre purchase, they were poisoned to be captured and a lot die in transit to the pet shop because arsenic has that effect.<br>  <br>  Next, they don't eat flakes, these guys are pure veggies.

39a2d5e9bc3c417cbdc5ba33cb6386bbaa	You will need to have at least a 10 gallon tank to have more than just a betta.  But pretty much any peaceful community fish can live with them as long as they don't look similar to bettas... i.e. bright colors and long flowing fins like guppies.  A lot of times it's not the betta that picks on other tank mates, faster swimming tank mates pick on the betta and nip its fins.  So you just have to watch out for that and make sure there's plants and places for the betta to hide if it wants to.<br>  <a href="http://www.peteducation.com/article.cfm?c=16+1918&aid=2200" rel="nofollow">http://www.peteducation.com/article.cfm?...</a>|`|hFU31zm7aa	well loaches but u need a good 20 gallon tank or so or you can have guppies make sure they r duller colors so the betta wont mistake it for a enemy and kill it if its a female it can live with groups of 4 i know i sound crazy for doing it but watch them for a few days to make sure its ok females are less aggressive anyway|`|dbZvPW3Haa	you can have many do not put gourami or paradise fish in. tetras, swordtails, platties there are many more.|`|a1wly9wRaa	Many of different fish just don't put any fish with large fins in.
MYEEK4dcaa	All dog breeds can get along with all other dog breeds.  All can be taught to get along well with most other animals.  They can live with cats, for example, and birds and gerbils and hamsters.  They will still want to chase strange cats, birds, and squirrels, though.  <br>  <br>  The secret is in socialization starting from a very young age.  If you can, don't take a dog away from its mother and siblings until it's 10 weeks old. By staying with his family past 8 weeks of age, the puppy learns things like bite inhibition - makes it less likely that the dog will be a biter.  <br>  <br>  When you bring the dog home, if he's under 4 months of age, make sure you get him all his shots, especially parvo.  (it's a virus).  When he's got all his shots, you can take him for nice long walks.  Before then, keep him socialized by having your friends, whose dogs you KNOW don't have parvo, bring their dogs to your yard to play.  The puppy will get to socialize with other dogs and other people than his own family, and that will help him understand that other dogs are no threat to him - and that if they ARE a threat, it's your job to protect him, not his job to protect you.<br>  <br>  But don't take your dog anywhere that there might be dogs you don't know (like a dog park) until he's had all his puppy shots.  This is important if you want your puppy to be healthy.<br>  <br>  Remember, the key is socialization starting from a very early age.   <br>  <br>  Good luck!<br>  <br>  Apacapacas|`|XNBMzuxbaa	Pretty much all breeds as long as they are introduced to people at a young age.<br>  I have a Boston Terrier and she is a real sweety.

In the wild, hamsters would travel miles every night in search of food, and some hamsters in captivity have been reported to run up to 8 km per night on their exercise wheels. Hamsters need lots of exercise and most pet hamsters love to use exercise wheels.<br>  <br>  The best kind of hamster wheel has a solid surface (not rungs) that either attaches to the side of the cage or is free standing without side supports than span the wheel opening. The common wire wheel that looks like a ladder wrapped into a circle with side bars for support is not the best choice as it can cause injuries.<br>  <br>  Keeping in mind hamsters are nocturnal and generally use their wheel a lot at night, you definitely want a quiet wheel. This is especially true if you share your room with a hamster! A squirt of vegetable oil is a safe option for greasing squeaky wheels.<br>  <br>  I can't find any absolute recommendations for minimum sizes of exercise wheels. Most marketed for hamsters will be suitable, keeping in mind that the smaller wheels are best suited to dwarf hamsters only, and larger hamster wheels should be used for Syrian (golden, teddy bear, etc) hamsters. Get the largest hamster wheel that you can, since a wheel that is too large shouldn't pose problems, but a wheel that is too small will be uncomfortable for your hamster.<br>  <br>  The run-about balls for exercise outside of the cage are popular, but given the amount of running most hamsters like to do won't really provide sufficient exercise on their own. As a novelty or additional means of exercise they are fine, though. These are available as a simple ball, a wheel shape that propels a car frame and other novelty shapes. There is also now a track system that you can set up to keep your hamster's movements in a run-about contained. Be careful not to leave a hamster in one of these balls for too long or they may overheat (15-20 minutes at a time is plenty), and never use them around stairs that the hamster could tumble down.|`|v3dN1sSaaa	when both of my hamsters started getting older they stopped using there wheel i have tried everything to get them to go into there wheels but they just wont and i don't know why 1 of my hamsters is pretty normal sized but the other one is getting a bit chubby, they still go into there ball but not there wheel and im just thinking its because they are getting older so i wouldn't worry about it good luck and have fun with your furry friend|`|oNHtVHzsaa	make sure your wheel is working and functioning well. it is possible that your hamster is just getting older and is moving a little slower. you also need to watch the diet of your hamster. feed it once a day and they will get used to a schedule (feed same time each day) and they will eat less. when you try to pick up your hamster, make sure you gentle and scoop her up and make her feel safe in your hands. sometimes they just don't want to go out cause they may have to go to the bathroom or wants to eat. don't be to pushy. good luck and hope this helps.
nBehRANyaa	Depends on the dog.  When I was a kid, we had intact family dogs and several litters.

Q.Q|`|cdq7Wvd6aa	They are most likey nervouse and frightened after the move and are too scared to come out. I don't think guinea pigs sleepmuch, like rabbits, so make sue they are moving and breathing in there! Watch them closely, and put the water and some tasty food that they will reall like right infront. If they still havn't eaten anything by tomorow, it's probably best if you call a vet. Hope your guinea pigs settle in soon!|`|TJBFBRZuaa	First off, congrats on buying two, especially brothers! They will live much happier lives with a companion :)<br>  Cavies are also natural prey animals, so naturally they are going to be frightened at a new change of scenery. Give them time to adjust to their new cage and home; guineas need at least 24 hours to become adjusted, and even then they should not be handled until they are calm. <br>  In order to lure them from their igloo, give them little pieces of lettuce or other treats and place them around the cage, with a lot in the food bowl and under the water (so that they know where they are).<br>  After this, your pigs will adjust much quicker. Just make sure they are in a quiet, non-drafty area so that they can get as comfortable in their new home as possible. Good luck!|`|iN63vSKRaa	Ditto to all in the previous answer....also make sure there aren't  loud noises to keep them scared.<br>  Make sure there's no draft and that they have a big enough cage to move comfortably in.

Girls are better together, males if raised from babies together, are fine also.<br>  Good luck, they are great and fun pets!|`|9jDhGjkJaa	dont worry, its normal, they will come out sooner or later. just make sure your cage is at least 10.5 square feet, and not on the floor, cause u will look like a giant for them. guinea pigs are shy, but the more time u spend with them the more trust will they have towards u|`|mzWV7VG3aa	Give it some time and I they'll probably come out.if they don't, consult a Vet.

il9Tdmchaa	We have a meyers parrot which is smaller than a sun conure(which we also have) the parrot fits your needs but you want to make sure to get a young one so you can train it the way you want. A sun conure is beautiful but can be extremely loud and because they can be a bit aggressive if not handled every day and given a lot of attention I don't think it would be a good choice to go with your other bird.|`|7HEZhx46aa	Consider a green cheek conure. They're not too big, not too expensive, relatively quiet compared to sun conures, nowhere NEAR as strong willed as a caique and they're affectionate and cuddly IF you get one from a reputable breeder that properly socializes their birds.<br>  A green cheek will also get along with a budgie MUCH easier than a caique.|`|qeOlkRM0aa	The first thing that pops in my head that fits your description is a hand fed male cockatiel. Lots of personality, likes (small) toys, get along with Budgies, not overly noisy and surprisingly sociable. They are amazingly sweet, and IMO grossly under appreciated. They are <$100<br>  Some of the Conures can be nice, the green cheek, red bellied, black capped, they are MUCH quieter than Sunnys, but they have their moments too. They can be  handful at times. Conure range from $300-$800.<br>  Another possibility, is a Pionus parrot.There are various species of them-blue head, bronze wing, a few others. They are about the size of Caiques and are relatively quiet. They are about $500-$600.<br>  <br>  IMO, your best bet is the right cockatiel. The thing to do, if possible, is to go to a breeder, and check out what they have and handle some birds. See how they react to you. See which ones run from you, and which ones run to you. Let the bird pick you.|`|rGxHfixeaa	How about a parotlet??  They're about the same size as your Budgie so you wont have to worry about your Budgie being injured by a much larger beak.

TiFDMWoEaa	As everyone else has said, you can't force rabbits to bond. I've been working with domestic animals for 20 years, and in my experience, rabbits are one of the most difficult to bond. They are extremely territorial--of their space, their toys, their food, even their humans--and they have a strict hierarchy. Even the twin lops I have now have dominants fights now and then. If your boys just have occasional scuffles, that's probably as good as it's gonna get. If they're not drawing blood, I wouldn't worry about it too much. If they're actually hurting each other, you may want to keep them apart.|`|m32Oq4cfaa	They probably won't be.  Just like most people, they might get on each others nerves from time to time.  As long as they're not fighting full force then they're fine.|`|v1tePj44aa	You don't. I have never seen bucks---even neutered, get along perfectly. My does don't even get along!

Soap and rinsing the bottle out and using a brush will help remove some of the algae and bacteria in the bottle helping the algae to grow, but the algae will normally grow back in no time fast.  Algae is never good to have in your rabbit's waterer.  That's one reason why I tend to like bowls better, they are easier to clean out.<br>  <br>  But the best way to clean your water bottle out is to mix about 1 part regular bleach with about 3 to 4 parts water, then fill your water bottle completely full with the mixture.  The chlorine from the bleach will kill the algae just like it keeps a swimming pool clean.  It's probably good to have an extra water bottle on hand anyhow.  Use the extra water bottle to water your rabbit with while you let the dirty one soak over-night.  The next day, empty the water bottle to about half, recap it, then shake it vigorously.  This will loosen and dispell the dead algae in it.  Use a brush or a kitchen sprayer with hot water if it won't come out.  Then rinse the bottle and let it set out to dry.  If it is summer then let it sit out in the sun.  The sun's rays are a good disinfectant.<br>  <br>  The other methods I saw remove most of the algae and bacteria, but they don't really kill it.  The bleach and sun will kill the algae and bacteria.<br>  <br>  Make sure to empty and refill the water bottle daily.  Fresh water will make it so you don't have algae build up in the bottle as easily.  <br>  <br>  One old rabbit veterinarian I knew recommended to even put 1 teaspoon of bleach per 1 gallon of water to mix your rabbit's drinking water.  This is supposed to kill the bacteria and algae in the water.  Clean water is vital to keeping your rabbit healthy.  If you use a syringe, 5cc's equals about 1 teaspoon.  If you do that your rabbit bottle should never get algae in it.
GOypfDoqaa	It is just like the filter on a fish tank. Hope I helped.|`|ldPd4mmSaa	i own the same waterfall you want to buy....its not very noisy at all, and if your putting it in a vivarium you really wont notice it at all.<br>  <br>  just remember to keep topping up the water every other day and clean it once a week
mDz7a6BBaa	Dont use regular table salt.. Buy the ones in the pet store.|`|gQongGHUaa	woooohhh hold on.  table salt doesnt make water saltwater.  you need to get aquarium salt for reef tanks from your local fish store.  you dont sound ready to keep these kinds of pets.  i would release him back into the creek before you kill him.  something like this needs a well established aquarium with live food to feed on and at least 30 gallons of water.  i doubt you have these requirments.|`|qeOlkRM0aa	The people answering your question are not stupid.<br>  Table salt won't work. You will kill that crab.|`|00RgkZF8aa	No of course not.<br>  <br>  You have to return the crab back to the river you found it it, taking creatures from the wild is inhumane and it may be illegal in your area.

a2cjwMKcaa	You dont NEED to have a protien skimmer, but they make the tank easier to look after.<br>  <br>  The idea is that they remove stray organic material before it breaks down and pollutes the water. This means less ammonia etc going into the system, therefore less nitrate buildup. So with a skimmer you can keep more fish, or do less water changes.<br>  <br>  But if your tank is only lightly stocked, and you are happy to change a bit more water, then you can successfully run a marine tank without one.<br>  <br>  Ian|`|SZOMVGBRaa	You don't need it if all you have in the tank is the sand and fish and some fake corals. If your gonna have a reef system though you will need one yes. A 30 gallon protein skimmer shouldn't be that much, just buy a name Brand and not a Store brand. Good Luck|`|qeOlkRM0aa	You don't NEED one, but it will make your life a lot easier. I strongly recommend them for beginners. It will pull out the dissolved organics out of the water. It will also add oxygen to the tank. For most people, I consider them the most important equipment they can buy-and going cheap usually doesn't help.<br>  I've has tanks without them, but its much harder to do.|`|h4wNRqf9aa	no... it's a good thing to have but not NECESSARY...<br>  <br>  <br>  good never equals cheap... the least i'd look at spending on a skimmer for a 30-40 gallon tank would be about $120 US|`|GOypfDoqaa	No it is not neccasary.
GLsCVPCuaa	as long as you follow the feeding directions on the bag you will be fine..my dogs would eat the whole bag if i allowed them..dogs in the wild love to gorge themselves, so even though you may think the dog is still hungry, shes fine...you are feeding her less now because the food you switched from (eukanuba) is crap and Canidae is great..less fillers and crap in the food means your dog doesnt need to eat as much daily, should begin to have smaller stools, and a healthier appearance.|`|IZz6mkOFaa	dogs do not act to food like humans...most of the time they are hungry in fact.  A dogs digestive system is to gorge and starve...gorge and starve.  That is how they have evolved.   Just follow the directions on the dog food...and maybe give her some green beans...to go with it..altho she probably will still think she is starving..At least you will know if she is not feeling good...she wont want to eat.  <br>  Good luck|`|yp0GQz5Laa	The only real way to know is to monitor her feces and her weight.  Make sure that her ribs don't start sticking out, and if her feces is thin, then it's probably more than enough. Personally, I would go ahead and start feeding her a little more and watch her feces to make sure it isn't too thin.  If it gets thin, then cut back to the one cup. That's the best way to tell.|`|AoSeHXeQaa	Just watch her weight.  If she starts to drop weight, then she is not getting enough, and you need to increase her food.|`|CkecSp4Uaa	Some dogs just don't know when to stop eating.  It doesn't mean that they aren't getting enough food, it just means that they don't have an "off" button.  The fact that she is eating half as much could make her feel less full or satiated.  Calorie-dense foods are not always filling.  In fact, the more calories there are crammed into each oz of a particular food the less filling it usually is...just look at the difference between salad and chocolate.  There's not a whole lot of calories in 1 oz of salad but it can still make a nice little appetizer.  On the other hand 1 oz of chocolate can have nearly as many calories as a small meal but it's hardly a bite and certainly not going to make you feel full.<br>  <br>  Don't increase the amount of food you are feeding her unless she looks like she is loosing weight.  You might try splitting the feeding up into smaller meals or putting part of her food in an interactive toy such as a kong so that it takes her longer to eat it (and will help her feel more full).  You can also try adding some canned pumpkin (not pumpkin pie filling, just the plain pumpkin) or low-sodium/fresh green beans to her bowl to help her feel more full without adding a lot of calories.|`|GSf09ALBaa	I have the same problem right now.  So what I am doing is lessening the food slowly.  A complete drop if half the food I think is too much.  I will be feeding less each week until I get to the recommended amount. <br>  <br>  And also, bear in mind these guidelines that are set by the dog food company are generalized.  Your dog may very well need a bit more even though it is a denser and more complete food.

b88691c1425e641c73274dcb27f8a891aa	I would suggest something like a Corn Snake. They can live happily in a 20 gallon LONG tank. They are very friendly and docile and are generally active in their tanks (minus times of digestion or in shedding mode). <br>  Feeding live mice is strongly discouraged by many snake keepers. If you get a corn snake, it will do fine eating frozen/thawed mice that you can buy from mostly any pet store, or reptile shop.<br>  <br>  Good luck with your decision and hopefully new snake.<br>  If you have any more questions, you can email me at m.goulbourne28@hotmail.com

Check their website for your state and city. At that age Parvovirus (very contagious) or a bad case of worms would could make him ill (they can be passed from mother's milk). It sounds yukky but check his feces for worms and make certain that anywhere he has a bowel movement. Look for things that look like little grains of rice (tape worms) or long strands of spaghetti (roundworms). If his stool is liquid, awful smell, and possibly bloody, it is most likely Parvo. Only a vet has the meds to correct.

And yes, you should let the shelter know you are interested in adopting.  And if they do take the dog, go there every day and visit him.<br>  <br>  They will have to charge the people with animal cruelty and neglect.

Its freezing rain (I live just south of Cincy), snowing, raining, sleeting, and its dropping a degree every hour. <br>  <br>  If the Animal Control agents decide that this is a case of cruelty, they would hold the animal until the couple has a set trial date.

aCqSF87Raa	Dogs tend to bond closest to those who do the most for them or those who are the "pack leader" of the household. My last dog, who passed away from cancer in 2006, would be the same way: adored and followed my mom but ignored or tolerated me and dad. <br>  <br>  My mom got the most love out of that dog, lol, because she fed and took care of her.<br>  <br>  So maybe you could have your daughter start doing some little things with the dog: a biggie is food. Whoever provides the food is high up in the dog's mind. So if your daughter helps out by filling the food bowl or providing water, the dog may change a bit.<br>  <br>  Have your daughter offer treats or toys from time to time to coax the dog in with her. But keep in mind that if the dog doesn't want to be there, he/she shouldn't really be forced. The dog could just be more comfortable with you for no reason we can figure out.

And maybe he wasn't growling directly at you but at something that he thought my hurt you that was very close to you and that is why it looked like he was growling at you to scare it away.  But when he started acting more like himself again could have been when whatever it was went away.  I think that he was afraid that whatever it was that he might have scared off was going to come back that is why he was so skiddish and why it took so long for you to get him to calm down enough to actually go to sleep.

Titles, have both had relevant genetic and health tests done, and you have a breeding mentor... then no. <br>  <br>  Breeding is not something to play around with and you could very well lose your female to whelping complications: it is expensive and time consuming, and with the economy the way it is very few people would be interested in buying or adopting the puppies.<br>  <br>  FYI one litter from her could produce over 60,000 dogs in the next six years (providing every pup has or fathers "one litter" before death or being fixed.)

This is the only difference.<br>  <br>  tortoises tend to not have webbed feet but turtles do, because they swim. <br>  <br>  Think of it this way. Sea turtles are just as big as Galapagos Tortoises, but they are different because the sea turtle lives in the sea, so it is a bit flatter, and has legs like fins.

ZH4N6Xdtaa	I am answering from the UK but hopefully will give an idea:<br>  <br>  Rabbit ￡26 (but ideally you should have 2 as they prefer to live in pairs)<br>  <br>  Cage ￡80 for a large cage specifically desigened for rabbits. Most cages come with a bottle, house and food bowl. But if it doesn't then you are looking at ￡15 for all of that.<br>  <br>  Bedding ￡10 for a giant bag that lasts a month<br>  <br>  Pellets ￡4 for a bag that will last about 2 weeks<br>  <br>  Hay ￡4 for a bag that will last about 2 weeks<br>  <br>  Toys range from ￡3 to ￡15<br>  <br>  So to set up you are looking at nearly ￡130 with 1 rabbit.<br>  <br>  <br>  But then you also need to consider the longterm costs, my bunnies cost me about ￡40 a month (for 2)<br>  Every 6 months they need 2 vaccinations which cost ￡30 each, this is for VHD and Mixomotisis which are very common and deadly diseases for rabbits (if they get these diseases your bunny will die and it is very painful and horrible!)<br>  <br>  So per year I spend on 1 rabbit ￡360.<br>  <br>  Then you should also get your bunny netered once they are 6 months old which costs ￡70.<br>  <br>  And on top of all that you need to be prepared for emergencies and vet bills! My bunny had snuffles (a cold which can be deadly) last month and it cost me ￡60 to sort out.

Teacup is a marketing term used by unethical breeders to describe dogs bred to be extremely small with no regard to the overall health of the animal. These are the types of breeders you should avoid at all costs.<br>  <br>  I would suggest that before you actively try to find a dog, you take the time to edcuate yourself on the breed first. It will help you in the long run, both during your search for a dog and after you have gotten one.<br>  <br>  Furthermore, dogs are not cheap because breeding ethically is not cheap.  Breeders have costs invested that they have to cover where they can.  If your funds are limited, checking with a shelter or rescue is your best option.  In all honesty, expecting a pup for little to know money is generally veiwed as pretty rude by breeders--it's like saying to you, the dog is not worth the time, efforts, and money they have invested in it.|`|YsMbKwTwaa	Oh you go to the tea store, some times they have cute little puppy designs on the cups.

nFcl0BOsaa	Whining -- never reward with attention, no matter if the attention is negative or positive. <br>  <br>  Sit: When you have something for the dog (food, toy, treat), let him know and then just stand there until he stops pacing around, wagging his tail and everything and just sits down waiting. All dogs will eventually sit down when they are waiting for something, simply because it is easier than standing. The instant his rear hits the floor, you say "sit" and then give the food. Do it consistently for a few days and he will know exactly what sit means. <br>  <br>  So training is figuring out how to voluntarily obtain a behavior you like, and then immediately associate that behavior with a command word and a reward. Conditioning a behavior can take as many as 30-40 reps, especially if the behavior is not normally one of the dog's strong suits.  (The reward does not always need to be a treat, it can be praise -- "what a good boy!".) But  "speak" and "quiet" can be taught in a similar way. There are times he will bark spontaneously -- or you can encourage him to bark -- and the instant he does, you say "speak!", and give a reward. Wait until he understands this, and then you can teach him what quiet means: You will wait for a break in barking, and at that pause you will say "quiet" and reward the behavior.<br>  <br>  Some behavior modification is accomplished by eliminating the benefits he gets from the behavior. If he jumps up on you, walk toward him so that he doesn't gain space on you. At the same time, his balance is affected which he will not care for. Although you may bump into him, that is not really the goal. The goal is to simply deny him your personal space. Alternatively, you can turn your back on him, denying him any attention for the behavior. <br>  <br>  If he is mouthy, you should let out a high-pitched yelp "OW!" when his teeth touch your skin. Turn around and go find something else to do, ignoring him for several minutes.  This will teach him to be more reserved with his mouth, something you will probably appreciate when he is bigger and stronger.<br>  <br>  Training is a lifelong process. At about 8 months old or so, his attention span will be well developed and it is an excellent time to have your first refresher courses, going over all that he learned as a young puppy.  Between 8 weeks and 16 weeks is a crucial time for socialization. As soon as he is vaccinated, he should be exposed to new situations. interaction with other dogs (gentle), cats, all types of people including children, the mailman, etc. If you don't know families with young children, you can often find them in parks. Ask people to give your puppy a treat, to tell him to sit, and then give him another treat. This will help teach him not to jump on OTHER people. <br>  <br>  Housetraining:<br>  <br>  Rule of thumb: The hours he can be crated is equal to his age in months plus one.  You may want to position yourself outside the crate, and hold a treat through one of the vents in the side of the crate to lure the pup to walk into the crate voluntarily. Treat for going in the crate = crate is a good place to be.  Put him in his crate for naps and when you can't supervise him. <br>  <br>  When he isn't in the crate, confine him to one large uncarpeted room until he has been taught that indoors is living space, and the place to eliminate is outdoors.  Take him out to eliminate every hour, and also immediately after he wakes up, after a play session, or after a meal. Do not pick him up to take him out to toilet. Leash him if he will not walk out on your encouragement alone.<br>  <br>  EDIT: I highly recommend you search the web for sites dedicated to raising/training a dog. Buy a good training book. After he is vaccinated but before the age of 16 weeks, begin socializing your pup. Take him to meet other dogs. Puppy classes would be great for this. Allow other people especially children to handle him. Ask the mailman to give him a treat and tell him to sit, and then give him another treat.      <br>  <br>  Please never, ever hit your Pit Bull, not even a "nose tap". It will cause them to lose their trust in you, and you do not want to lose the trust of a powerful breed that already tends to be stubborn.  There is a "watch me" command used to get a dog's attention.  <br>  <br>  Take charge of the activities do you with him. Do not encourage him to get your attention in any way when he wants to play. He is a dog, not a human. Develop a routine for everything so he knows he can count on it -- but everything -- playtime, walks, training sessions -- starts and ends with you.|`|WadeWRahaa	petsmart has personal pet trainers|`|5PWzxw4Xaa	dog trainer 30 plus yrs- Potty Training<br>  I put a harness on them, leash them with a retractable leash and stick the handle in my pocket. Scolding loudly or even too sternly can bring on confusion more than understanding.  Wherever I go they go...even when I have to go to the bathroom...or if someone else in the family is home they tuck her in their pocket.  This brings trust...you become a leader they can trust.  It also helps you to be able to “read” her signals.  Sometimes it is just a squat, sometimes they turn, other times they simply look up quickly then squat.  Amid the squat, scoop her up and talk sweetly saying, “go po-T outside” repeat it until you are outside.  Keep her on the leash so she does not lose her train of thought.  Keep repeating the command as if you are saying “don’t the flowers smell sweet today”...so it becomes a pleasant thing for her to hear thus she will be more likely to listen and learn.  If she poos inside accidently keep her near you and pick it up with a paper towel.  Squat down slowly and show it to her and say “go po-T outside”.  Then take her out with you to put it in “her spot”.  Do not give her the entire yard to go in until she has potty training down pat.  Let her collection stay for a few days so she gets that she has a designated area.  A lot of times they will continue to go in that area for a lifetime and it makes cleaning up a lot easier...no hunting.  After she goes outside kneel down and pet her saying all the “good po-T outside” ‘s that you can stand.  Over exaggerate your happiness. You can then scoop her up and hug her, rub her belly, clap softly when she finishes.  Remember to keep a cool head...don’t show anger or frustration because they will not respond positively to that.  You can do this...remember it takes time and consistency as well as love.  <br>  <br>  Training on Bark Control:<br>  This is one I have to deal with a lot...but it's more the owners that make it work or fail. I have a small yorkie. Since I have had her as a pup I have quietly had to "stay on her' about "no bark". She just lets out what most people would not even call a bark now...it's more of a quiet, umph noise. This is usually to tell me she is unhappy about something and if I let it go it will escalate into yappping. Like you I believe this is an annoying sound...I mean it can be cute when they are puppies but when they go out to potty and do nothing but bark the entire time...the neighbors get mad and sometimes they just are so busy yapping outside that they come in a potty inside the house. <br>  I tell the owners to keep them on a leash/leash handle inside pocket. The first bark -- leash is pulled up/sit position/no,no,no bark --- if it does not stop tap nose-it's more just to keep attention diverted to you so you don't tap real hard...added with the long "shhhhhh" sound with more "no,no,no bard" keep repeating this until the dog is quiet. After about 3-4 days it starts happening...but you have to keep up with it. People allow their dogs bad habits then get mad at the dog when it is our job to help them "maintain" good behavior. This is hard to stop and most people will/do not stay consistent enough for the amount of time it takes to make happen. I have had dogs completely trained and in 2 weeks time when I go back for a "check up" the dog is back to their normal behavior as before trained. If they would just say a stern "no bark, no, no, no" when the umph starts it would end... but they don't. I allow barking when it's appropriate - a stranger comes to the door, excitement when her dog friend first pops through the door as a surprise...there is a big difference between just yapping and barking for a reason...you will see what I mean when you start watching for the difference.  I believe every dog should have a voice...but like people they must learn when and where to use it.  <br>  Starting early is such a wise choice.  Many people with large dogs stop me and ask why she isn’t “going off” I simply reply “because like your dog she knows it’s not necessary”.  They also “go off” when nervous, when they know you have the upper hand and will “take care of them” they are more at ease. <br>  <br>  Dog Training on no Jumping up or <br>                          jumping on you while you're on the Furniture:<br>  When you see your dog about to "pounce"  or “leap”- they usually squat down and although cute...this is the time to stop it. Bring your hand up as to block, say a firm "no, no, no, easy" repeat it 2x. Next get him into a "sit" position.  Repeat “no jump--down”  2x.  If he persists and try’s again say and do the commands in the same patient yet stern voice.  Again the more you show emotional upset, the more they just do not hear you. Just keep being consistent and do this as many times as it takes to keep him down.  You can divert the attention by throwing a toy or even teaching the command “Where’s your toy?”  This will teach him when he wants your attention to play, how to get it properly.  If he does not know th|`|4oeBAHANaa	you don't...<br>  pit bulls are awfull dogs that attack and kill inocent people and animals.|`|4dXcZhuTaa	animal planet can actually help yo they have a show that teaches you i'm sure the information is on their online site too =)<br>  hope that helps|`|MYEEK4dcaa	BEFORE you can start training your dog, you need to help him see you as the pack leader.  He WILL get aggressive if that doesn't happen FIRST.  Being a pack leader is a 24/7 job, though.  It's like being a parent:  you're never, ever off-duty.  Pit Bulls are trained exactly like every other dog is trained. In an obedience class, preferably.  You don't need specialized knowledge to raise one.  What you DO need is his absolute respect and trust.  He'll love you because dogs sort of automatically do that with their humans, but love is not the same as respect and trust.  Here's how you can be your dog's pack leader first and foremost:<br>  <br>  A. Behave like a leader at key points of responsibility within the pack and that makes you the leader. <br>  <br>    1.  Eat your own meals before you feed your dog.  Even if you have to munch on a cracker while he watches, make sure he knows you're done eating before you allow him to start eating.<br>  <br>    2.  Make and enforce at least 5 household rules (such as "No begging at the table" and "Stay off the furniture").<br>  <br>    3.  Lead the walk, with the dog walking beside you, at heel.  Never use a flexi-lead because you can't control your dog if he is 15-25 feet out in front of you. <br>  <br>    4.  Exercise the dog by a brisk walk with the dog at heel at least once a day, preferably twice a day. A dog can walk for 5 minutes for each month of his life up to the age of 12 months; after that he can walk as long as you want to walk.  Be sure to check the surface on which he'll be walking - if it is too hot or too cold for you to rest your hand on, it will be too hot or too cold for his feet.  You can get booties for him at some of the larger pet stores, or try Paw Wax.<br>  <br>    5.  Playing with the dog is demonstrating affection for him; it's a bonding time.   Be sure you start the play and you end it.<br>  <br>    6.  Own and provide all resources like food, treats, bones, and toys.  Leave food down only 15 minutes then pick up the bowl. Give toys to dog when you want to play; put toys away when you're done playing.<br>  <br>    7.  Ignore the dog for at least 5 minutes when you come home so he will recognize that you are "top dog" in the pack.<br>  <br>    8.  Greet strangers (guests at home, friends and passersby on the street) first and direct the dog how to react to them. <br>  <br>    9.  Protect the dog from onrushing, off-leash dogs, dogs who are harassing them, and dogs who challenge them.<br>  <br>   10.  The dog gets NOTHING (except water and potty breaks) unless he works for it.  "Working" means obeying whatever command you offer, such as sit, stay, stand, and down.  (This is the essence of the NILIF program.)<br>  <br>   11.  Never pet the dog or comfort it when it is misbehaving.  Never talk in a high squeaky voice to a dog.  Dogs don't understand what it means to have their feelings hurt.<br>  <br>   12.  Don't let the dog sleep in your bed until you are sure he sees you as his pack leader; you don't want him to try to own the bed.<br>  <br>  <br>  B. There are four "MUST READ" books you can probably get at Amazon.com. They will explain all the rituals listed above.<br>  <br>    1.  The first is "The Dog Whisperer" by Cesar Millan. Teaches you how to be a pack leader.  <br>  <br>    2.  The second is "The Dog Listener" by Jan Fennell. Teaches you how to get willing cooperation from your dog.<br>  <br>    3.  The third is "The Art of Raising A Puppy" by the Monks of New Skete. Teaches you how to get a puppy started right as a member of your pack.<br>  <br>    4.

There is a reason there isn't breed specific general training on most sites, that is a silly idea. I will give you this, with the amount of bad press the bully breeds get it is a good idea to have a well trained pet that can be an example of the best the bully breeds can be. That said, you don't need "breed specific" training techniques ... just consistent training.|`|AyFgGoq4aa	All i can say is that... dogs are tuff. When we got my dog he didn't even know how to walk on a leash! He was that bad. So, we took him to this place called Best Friends and they had training classes. My dog got the hang of it like that. I'm sure your dog will to. You just need to be patient. If there's not a store called Best Friends where you are then look for it on google.

The main thing with a pit is to keep them calm. My male is 4 years old and I still put him in a kennel at night, it seems to keep him quiet at night and helps to make him easier for me to handle on the morning walk. <br>  I swear, I think he can understand as much as a 4 year old!!|`|5eSSAT69aa	my neighbor  trains his pit bull with chains. it seemsto work very well.|`|XWx0ocRWaa	I got my pit bull after she was already 1 1/2 years old.. I taught her to sit with treats. Buy treats and keep them in your pocket, say sit and push his butt down. With patience and repetition he should associate the treats with the command. I've learned pit-bulls have a tremendous amount of energy and mature at about 3 years so you might need patience with hyperness/chewing/teething for quite some time. The whining is probably because he's a puppy and try not to let him realize that barking will get your attention because then he will do it for everything. I haven't been able to leave my dog in the house overnight without waking up to something being chewed to destruction but every dog is different. I've been told that exercise daily can help to avoid behavior problems by allowing them to release built up energy. As for the crates, dogs seem to like crates as a place of relaxation, this is a place of sanctuary and should not be associated with any bad experiences. They are great dogs just misunderstood, on a similar note do not leave your dog alone with other dogs because they seem to play rough and other dogs may feel threatened. Good Luck
qdtU1Q1Laa	14hh is quite short. I'd recommend looking at a horse of at least 14.3hh. <br>  <br>  Hope this helps.|`|RUzBDX6Jaa	How old are you?  If you have a long time of growing left, i suggest getting at least a 15hh horse.  I bought a 14hh pony when I was around your height, but now i'm 5'7" so I suggest against a pony at the moment.|`|I55JNnvpaa	definetly not big. if anything small, but I think that it would do you well. If you can ride it, and it respond... why not?|`|NIlgYM4saa	I think it sounds like an ideal size for you if you don't think you'll grow anymore|`|Czh1fbQgaa	Thats probably too small. I'd go with 14.2 to 15.2.|`|sbB0TpGXaa	.2 is two inches.  Most adults prefer horses between 14.2 and 15.2 hands for trail riding.  Any shorter and you get too wet every time you cross water.  Any taller and you have to duck too much to get under limbs.<br>  <br>  One thing to consider.  Are you done growing?  If not then you will probably want a slightly taller horse.  If you are the 14.0 will probably do as long as it really is 14.0.  A LOT of horses are not even close to being as tall as their owners think.<br>  <br>  Most western saddles weigh in at between 15 and 25 pounds.  Older ones with a wooden tree tend to be heavier though.  English saddles tend to be lighter in the 12 to 20 pound range.|`|wDrvsdEHaa	I think that you should consider a horse. I am 5'1 and my horse is 15.3-16hh and 5 years old but acts like shes 15 lol. A horse would last you longer so in a few years time you will still be able to ride it rather than having to sell it because you grew to big. It all depends on how you feel about it and if you want a pony, fine, go ahead and get a pony but you have to run the risk of you getting to tall to ride it (if you haven't finished growing). Up to you =)|`|ecf159d9c2d48432e189d0cac81882e2aa	My friend is your size and has a 14.2 hand horse and it's about the perfect size for her. <br>  <br>  For your purpose, just trail riding, etc. I think a 14 hand horse would be fine, but I would definitely NOT go any smaller then that. <br>  <br>  <br>  And a "bombproof" horse for only $350 sounds pretty sketchy to me, make sure you get vet checks, second opinions from a trainer and all that. :) <br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|Nh3ZDjwhaa	If your only riding him around the house and on trails then thats fine. And as long as your weight is under 170 with tack then thats fine. I own a 14.1hh appaloosa pony and Im 4'9. I show him and jump him. Im also done growing and only weigh 95-97 pounds. With the tack it would be 125pounds so Im fine. People say I look perfect on my pony so I think over 5' is too tall for a 14hh pony. But I would still definitely go with a 15hh horse since western saddles weigh more.|`|kwhfazx7aa	Hi,<br>  Whether a horse is the right size for you also depends on the build of the horse.  A good guild is that when seated on the horse your foot should not hand lower than the girth or girth region.  Ideally your foot should finish a couple of inches shorter.  Get someone who knows i.e. riding instructor to look at you on the horse.<br>  After that it's how you fell.<br>  Good luck. (For your height and weight 14hh sounds fine).|`|wjJjthHvaa	What's the pony's build like?  If he's stocky and stout enough, you'd be just fine.  Most ponies that are built like small propane tanks (and barrels) are usually wide enough to take up a rider's leg, so that it isn't dangling.<br>  <br>  I'll be honest with you, if you like this pony, and he suits you ... go for it!  Especially if you're just trail riding.  There's so many advantages to riding a smaller horse (or a large pony) out on the trails.  I've been able to squeak under low branches that a larger horse would have gotten a rider stuck under.  I have found that the only real drawback to riding a smaller horse is when you get to a closed gate, and everyone expects you to get off and open it. ;)<br>  <br>  I'm a trail rider by choice (did showing when i was a kid) but decided that going out and exploring was the most fun thing to do on horseback.  When I was shopping for a horse, I didn't bother to look at horses over 15 hands because I knew what I wanted in a horse.  Turns out, my Haflinger gelding was all of 14.1 hands and built like a small tank.  He really is quite amazing. He looks small, but rides like a big horse and has tons of presence.  And I'm not a small person.  I'm 5'6" and weigh around 140.  Add the fact that my legs are where most of my height is, and that I can put my arm over my boy's withers, and he almost seems too small at first glance.<br>  <br>  But he's a Haffie, and they were bred to be all around weight-carriers for their size.  He falls into that same category as a Norwegian Fjord and Icelandic, and the British native ponies.  To put it aptly and to borrow from Shakespeare "though they be but little, they are fierce."  There is a growing trend, both here in the US, and in the U.K. and just about anywhere to for adults to ride smaller horses (or larger ponies)  Some people compete with their horses, others just go trail riding and hacking.  There are advantages to having a smaller mount as a trail horse.<br>  <br>  Anyway, here's a couple pictures of me and the golden boy from a barn playday.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v197/dreamswept/MightyMitch/91408-44.jpg" rel="nofollow">http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v197/d...</a><br>  <a href="http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v197/dreamswept/MightyMitch/91408-13.jpg" rel="nofollow">http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v197/d...</a><br>  <a href="http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v197/dreamswept/MightyMitch/91408-46.jpg" rel="nofollow">http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v197/d...</a><br>  <br>  As you can see, 5'6' me fits very nicely on 14.1 hand him.<br>  <br>  Do get a vet check on any prospective purchase, and make sure that he's been measured accurately.  You can certainly fit nicely on a stout 14 hand pony (and let's be honest, 14.2 or 14.3 is only 2 or 3 inches taller, it's not enough to make a real difference in any case ... you can barely see the difference) but anything smaller than 14 hands might not suit you as well.  I almost trialed a 13.3 hand pony who turned out to be 13.1, but I wouldn't have known unless his owner accurately measured him for me.  Too small for me.  I'll stick with my Haflinger, thanks.<br>  <br>  ... and as an adult, I'm keeping the pony as long as I'm able, and if I have to give him up (which I'd avoid at all costs) it won't be because I'd ever outgrow him.|`|8QuASgEKaa	sounds good to me... weight wise. is this horse good for you in skill level? if you are an inexperienced rider you definitely don't want a hotter horse. and if you're a really experienced rider (20 some years experience ect.) then you might want a little bit of a hotter horse that you can handle so that you don't get bored with a push button.|`|KuBDXQTlaa	It depends, but you might want something that's more around 14.2 or 14.3, but if you think its a good size, go for it!|`|K4bJgTF4aa	don't go with ponies if you are not finished growing.|`|4ZcLC6fSaa	If you are growing still and are younger don't get him, you will soon outgrow him leaving him either to just a pasture mate or you will have to sell him and try to buy a horse you can ride. I suggest getting a full sized horse and being able to keep him for a long time. That is unless you really really want this pony then it's up to you. Just remember that you don't want to hurt him so be careful.|`|hJjTs5a5aa	Personally I would go with a little taller horse I am 5'4" and I own a 14.3 hand horse and he is perfect he's not to small that I have to worry about outgrowing him and he's not so big that he's intimidating, another thing is how old are you, and are you done growing, If this horse is stocky and has a bigger build then you might be all right but If he is of slight build you may want to look for some thing bigger a good horse classifieds sight is www.horsetopia.com hope that helps!
4dntstR9aa	Please read the link down below.<br>  Personally I think its a lot of repetition - you have to TRAIN him to know that its only OK to pee outside - you have to repeat yourself a 1000 times, maybe more before they catch on.

Do not change the pad the minute they use it, and you need to praise when they gone on it. If they smell the urine or feces they tend go back and use it again. They need to become used to using the pads, until you begin to train them to just go outside. You can keep the food and water bowls close by to so it's all in the same vicinity.<br>  <br>  Hope this helps.|`|IEsudy2xaa	the puppy training pads has a scent that will encourage it to go there but for a while you will have to keep lifting him or her on to it as for the food when they are hungry or thirsty just keep the dishes close by and he or she will find them all the best

(Iceberg and cabbage are bad for them, any other leafy greens will do) for vitamin A that they need at least 4 to 5 times a week..<br>  They love grapes and strawberries and squash, cut up in bite size pieces and drop in the tank.<br>  <br>  Aquatic Turtles are a life long commitment.<br>  <br>  Remember 10 gallons for every inch of turtle. <br>  You need a heater...set at 80 degrees. If water is cold they will stop eating! <br>  Sliders, westerns, cooters , midland, painted, map, yellow bellied all are basically the same and require the same basic care. <br>  They NEED calcium and protein they get it from the fish meat and the fish bones.

BI1GbIZUaa	They do not eat the same things. Their main diet should be specifically for a guinea pig or for a rabbit. Guinea pigs need vitamin c in their diet while rabbits don't. If a guinea pig doesn't have vitamin c through it's food it will get sick so buy different food for each. They will both love fresh veggies and treats, those they can share. They should NOT live together. Rabbits have very strong legs and one kick can kill your guinea pig. Guinea pigs are also social animals i would try to get two they can play with each other. Get the biggest cages that you have space for. Both animals will be happier with more space. They aren't too much work, you need some time every day to feed and change their water. Other then that you just have to clean their cage out, twice a week is what I do. Spend the money up front for a large easy to clean cage. Food is not very expensive and lettuce/veggies are really cheap. I use aspen shavings. A huge bag costs $13 and lasts me 3 weeks for one large guinea pig cage. You will also need hay for both animals. A large bag goes for $14 and that should last you almost a month for both animals. In all I would budget a couple hundred dollars up front and monthly about $40|`|ZH4N6Xdtaa	ok this is a little bit worrying as pets take alot of time and effort to care for especially if you have more than 1!<br>  <br>  no they dont eat the same things, you will need to buy guinea pig pellets and rabbit pellets to ensure they get all the nutrition they need but you will also have to feed them hay and things like carrots too which can be same BUT THEY MUST HAVE PELLETS!<br>  <br>  DO NOT HOUSE THEM TOGETHER! common mistake by people, rabbits will grow alot bigger than the g pig, they will fight and the rabbit wont stop until the g pig is dead!<br>  <br>  They do stink especially while they are young because they will wee in several places, they pooh alot, and the cage/hutch will stink if it is not cleaned out thouroughly at least 1 a week (2/3 times a week while they are young)<br>  <br>  your rabbit needs to be able to stand on his hind legs when fully grown in his cage and they need to be able to lie down stretched out, the cage should be at 4 times the length of their fully grown body. Most rabbits once fully grown will be as large as  small dog!<br>  <br>  Yes all pets are hard work! daily feeding, cleaning, play time, tidying up after them, supervising them when they are out the cage. I spend at least 4 hours a day looking after my 2 house rabbits.<br>  <br>  I dont know what your budget is but it will cost about $40 a month each to look after the rabbit and g pig. Then you also need to consider vet costs. A rabbit needs vaccinations from 2 common deadly diseases VHD and Mixomotosis every 6 months which cost $30 each. Plus you should also get your rabbit netered which will help them to live happier, longer and healthier lives which costs $60.<br>  <br>  You also need to ensure you can afford vet bills when there are emergencies, my bunny had snuffles (a cold) which can be deadly this cost me $80 last month to sort out.<br>  <br>  Both pets are sociable and are happier to live with a companion so I would suggest it would be easier and more cost effective if you got 2 rabbits or 2 guinea pigs, not one of each. (and get the same sex!)|`|tT256JQRaa	1) they dont eat the same thing - sure, the fruit and veg - but the commercial food for each is harmful to the other one.<br>  <br>  2) no you cannot house them together. rabbits can seriously injure and even kill pigs, as well as the food issue.<br>  <br>  3) anything stinks if you dont clean it out... but they dont really stink themselves like some hamsters and ferrets<br>  <br>  4) they probably wouldnt outright right, but as said above, rabbits tend to kick out and can kill your piggie no problem at all, but if the pig was in a bad mood he could cause some pretty bad damage too<br>  <br>  5) you'll need two cages - if you go to the petstore you'll find them especially suited for them. i'd say a 3ft by 2ft minumum for each, and remember that bigger is better<br>  <br>  6) they arent really a lot of work - changing food & water and playing with them once a day, and cleaning them out once a week - more high mantainance than some pets but much much less than others<br>  <br>  7) yeah sure... depends how big your budget is...<br>  you can buy stuff in bulk (like the hay, bedding and woodshavings), the food lasts quite a long time and doesnt cost much, and you can grow your own veggies for them, or if you buy them for yourself, then just share :D<br>  it should cost less than ￡15 a week to keep both of them<br>  <br>  8) they are both great loving and quite smart pets, but personally i prefer guinea pigs - they just seem to have more personality<br>  <br>  9) any breed really - they all have pretty much the same care requirements, besides the giant breeds of rabbits, that will need bigger houses obviously, and the long haired guinea pigs, that will need regular brushing|`|SwlJJaT5aa	Hi sorry, I only know about guinea pigs, but a few about them being together.<br>  <br>  1. No, a guinea pig would die eating rabbit food.<br>  <br>  2. NO! The guinea pig would die easily!<br>  <br>  3. YES, a rabbit stinks in the first place, and adding on another animal will just add on more of the horrible smell.<br>  <br>  4.

A rabbit- Unknown<br>  <br>  6. Yes, cause guinea pigs want lots of snuggle time with you and will literally squeak at you when they see you for attention (or food).<br>  <br>  7. Maybe, but a guinea pig cage is always at least 30, and rabbit cages are usually larger.<br>  <br>  8. Guinea pigs are GREAT to have, rabbits idk but they tend to thrash or kick when you lift 'em out of the cage, but I've heard good things about them!|`|Z1nBkxmraa	1.)depending like they both eat fruit and veggies but, you should really get books for each of them and read up on what to feed them<br>  <br>  2. Ok i know everyone is saying no to this but if u get them both while they are babies and buy a play pen and put them together for an hour a day and let them get used to one another u may unless they fight then separate them.<br>  <br>  3.If you clean them they won't they are very easily managed.<br>  <br>  4.Depending on if you let them get used to one another or not if you don't then more then likely yes they will.<br>  <br>  5. They make special cages for both of them for guinea pigs i prefer multiple floors it makes it so much easier and lets them move around more.<br>  <br>  6.As long as u feed them, water them, and clean them they are really quite simple to take care of.<br>  <br>  7.That depends on how low a budget you are talking about I say you need at least 30 dollars on each a month.<br>  <br>  8.I think they are both wonderful and all but rabbits are just cuties in my personal opinion.<br>  <br>  9.Ok now the breed question all of them are quite alright but you really want a short haired one if your not gonna speed a lot of money on them.|`|HScrvIygaa	Well I have two guinea pigs and one rabbit so I shall answer the questions the best I can according to what I do and know =]<br>  <br>  1. I feed my rabbit a different dryed food to my guinea pigs. I give my guinea pigs a bowl of veg each day and my rabbit just a little bit of veg (they don't need as much veg as guinea pigs because otherwise they can get diarea) =/.<br>  <br>  2. It is ok to house some rabbits and guinea pigs together, but some might not get on. Mine are in seperate runs and hutches, but when I put them together they get on fine and dont seem to be interested in each other really.<br>  <br>  3. If you clean there hutch out once every week then they shall not smell =] Otherwise yes they can tend to smell if they are left longer than that. You will find that the rabbit it cleaner (well mine is anyway) (poo's in one corner and stuff, bless him lol). They don't often need a wash themselves because they keep themselves clean. But you can sometimes, =].<br>  <br>  4. I have two girl guinea pigs and they don't fight, I have heard that two boy guiena pigs might tend to fight. And my guinea pigs don't fight with the rabbit either.<br>  <br>  5. Ermm big another lol mine are pretty big really, my dad made them =]<br>  <br>  6. not really, just as long as you make sure they get lots of love, the correct care (food, clean water, cleaning there hutch out etc) i'm sure you will be great! =]<br>  <br>  7. yes<br>  <br>  8. Yes!!! Hehe so sweet, I love my Burny (the rabbit) and Daisy and Dandelion (the guinea pigs).<br>  <br>  9. Ermm the smooth fured guinea pigs (can't remember the name now) are alot easier than the ones with long hair! And floppy eared rabbits and easy to handle.<br>  <br>  Oh yeh and I also give them a bit more fresh hay every day to eat and to be warm and comfortable. I also move there runs, every weekish to fresh grass =]<br>  <br>  hope this helped xxxxxxx
wLgGD63raa	Since you just got him or her today, you need to leave it alone, because it is just trying to adjust to its new home. Don't try to handle him/her right now, it'll warm up to you when it feels safe and comfortable. Get some mealworms and put them in a dish and leave them in for it to eat. Don't hover over the tank to watch it and try and make sure it eats.<br>  <br>  I suggest if you have them in the same tank, separate them so you can make sure it's the weakling that is eating and not your other gecko.|`|pf5G6ssJaa	its ok|`|qUGVYNItaa	"she" hates you|`|SsrX9DBYaa	well baby leos are genrerally pretty skinny if you find that your new leos weight isnt normal, i would definelty buy the wax worms, i dont know how much they sell at once, but it is worth  your geckos health, you seem to know how to care for your leopard geckos. to clarify why your gecko is jumpy, she s just a baby and has never been in this situation, give her time. hopefully ur gecko is not cold, if she has  correct temps and heating, she'll be fine.. if you are still  iffy about buying the wax worms because of the bulk size they come in, i would feed  your new leopard gecko, as many crickets as she wil eat in 5  minutes.  it would be good. if you could feed your baby leopard gecko a wax worm once a week or so, only because she is so skinny.|`|k9gC23apaa	Geckos are one of the easiest reptiles to take care of. Make sure you have the right set up for him. Geckos don't necessarily need a large tank.  They will do fine in a 10-20 gallon tank.  They need a pretty hot environment.  I recommend a to place a heat lamp on on side of the tank and also on that side use an under the tank heater.  Place the geckos cave on the warm side.  On the opposite side, place a shallow water dish.  Do NOT use CALCI SAND for its bedding, the gecko is too small, if ingested can and will cause a blockage.  As a baby I recommend Alfalfa Meal (its a small rabbit pellet looking bedding) . Much safer for the little guy ! As the gecko is larger in size you can change the bedding to calci sand.  Feed, crickets are good for the little guy.  Wax worms are good as well, but they are really fatty, so you don't want to feed all the time, but more as a treat.  Mealworms are another thing you can feed this little guy.  And both the meal worms and wax worms last longer if kept in the fridge.  Good Luck !!

That can also be used as training time.  There are pee pads like diapers that dogs can wear, those are available at any pet supplies place.  But he sounds like he needs really basic training first. As a dog owner you need to be doing this with him.|`|AA11244754	you need to exercise him like crazy and train him (including house breaking)|`|3C3EIFtraa	Have you had a chance to talk to the vet about this problem yet?  When my adult dog started peeing in the house it turned out that he had a bladder infection.  <br>  <br>  Also, how old is your dog?  Males who have not been neutered will sometimes pee to scent mark the house as their property.  This is something your vet should also be consulted about.    <br>  <br>  Has your dog ever been house trained?  You should work very hard to reward him when he does pee outside. (lots of treats and excited praise). <br>  It would also be a very good idea to make sure your dog gets at least two long walks a day so he never pees in the house because he is overly excited.  Obedience training will also help, as this will keep him from getting bored and looking for ways to entertain himself.  <br>  <br>  Good luck and don't give up!
JsBb732Maa	They are the same dog, the AKC changed the name but I have a JRT I bought before the change so he's registered as a JRT then after the name change he was shown as a Parson Russel Terrier.|`|0mb78CiWaa	The Parson Russell Terrier is a true working foxhunter, possessing a ready attitude, alertness, confidence, and great strength and endurance. Today, many Parsons are also found working in stables and exhibiting at agility and obedience trials. The breed’s weatherproof coat can be broken (wire-haired) or smooth and is white, white with black or tan markings or tri-color.<br>  <br>  Named for the respected huntsman Rev. John Russell, the Parson Russell Terrier was first bred in the south of England in the mid-1800s to hunt red fox. Traditionally, the Parson followed the fox underground to flush him out for the hunter. Authorities claim that after Rev. Russell’s death some of his bloodlines were crossed with the Welsh Corgi and other terrier breeds, creating a different type dog, the "Jack Russell Terrier." The parent club for the breed requested a name change from Jack Russell to Parson Russell Terrier.<br>  <br>  Outgoing and friendly, the Parson is tenacious in the field and affectionate in the home. No matter the venue, the breed is filled with energy, so he requires regular exercise and attention. Although good with children, he does not tolerate rough handling from toddlers. The Parson is a clean breed and does not need frequent bathing, but the broken coat may need to be hand stripped.<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  The Jack Russell is a happy, bold, energetic dog; they are extremely loyal, intelligent and assertive. Their greatest attribute is their working ability, closely followed by their excellent qualities as a companion. A Jack Russell can be equally contented bolting a fox or chasing a toy in your living room, or equally adept at killing a sock in the living room or a rat in your barn. Their funny antics will continually amuse you, their intelligence seems to know no bounds and their assertive nature and boundless energy can at times be overwhelming.<br>  <br>  <br>  The unique personality of this feisty little terrier is capturing the hearts of many, but they are not a dog for everyone.<br>  <br>  A Hunting Dog<br>  While adaptable to a variety of environments, they are first and foremost bred to be hunting dogs. City or apartment living, or a confined or sedate lifestyle, do not meet the needs of a Jack Russell. These little dogs require what may seem to be an extraordinary amount of human attention, outdoor activity, exercise, discipline and an understanding and acceptance of their hunting nature.  They have been known to train their owners more often than not.<br>  <br>  Jack Russells can be very aggressive with other dogs, and in fact more than two should never be kept together unattended. There have been many instances of terriers being hurt, even killed, by their fellow terriers; even young pups over the age of eight weeks must be carefully monitored. It is imperative that prospective Jack Russell owners understand this part of the terrier's nature. Special facilities and handing are absolutely necessary when owning a Jack Russell, and especially when owning two or more Jack Russells. Their natural hunting instinct also brings out aggression towards other small animals such as cats, gerbils, guinea pigs, etc.<br>  <br>  It is said that the courage of the Jack Russell is never in doubt; surely a true statement, as they have often been known to take on an adversary twice (or more) their size. They require firm, consistent, responsible handing; they are very intelligent, determined and bold (sometimes to the point of abandon, which could be fatal).<br>  <br>  While outdoor activity and exercise is essential, the Jack Russell should never be permitted to roam unattended, even in the most remote country setting. The Jack Russell is, above all, a hunting dog - and will go to ground at every given opportunity, to any quarry - they are afraid of nothing. Many a Jack Russell has been known to stay in an active earth for days, even weeks, without food or water because of the strong instinct bred into them to stay with their quarry. It can be very frightening experience to lose your terrier and an impossible situation to the untrained owner inexperienced in earthwork; the results could be tragic.<br>  <br>  <br>  The Jack Russell can make a terrific family pet, and gets along well with well behaved children. One of the Jack Russell's most surprising qualities is a kind and gentle nature. He is usually friendly with small children, provided the child understands how to properly handle the terrier. Having the natural assertive terrier characteristics, however, the Jack Russell will not put up with even unintended abusive nature from a child. This should be carefully considered, particularly with children under the age of six.<br>  <br>  The Jack Russell has been a popular breed in England for many years, and is now attracting a variety of followers with varied interests in this country and other countries around the world. The JRTCA strongly encourages all those interested in the breed to thoroughly study all aspects of the Jack Russell, its special characteristics and needs, and to make a careful evaluat|`|8584e0329fb17c662606d5a6a8650ee2aa	It's a bit a matter of semantics.  AKC uses Parson Russell Terrier as the name for the type of Jack Russell terrier bred to meet the AKC conformation standard.  Many JRT breeders were more interested in the working qualities of the dog and not meeting the AKC standard and have kept the traditional name and are not concerned with AKC registration.|`|tsnpv9whaa	Ita actually the same dog!

Never buy a puppy sight unseen off a website.  You are guaranteed a puppy mill dog or a scammer.  Contact the National Breed Club through AKC and get in contact with legitimate breeders in your area through them.  Or look for a nice lab in a shelter - there are tons of them.<br>  <br>  Find the breed club through www.akc.org|`|AA11244754	most humane societies and A.S.P.C.A.'s have puppies that are available to good homes and they are so in need of a loving forever home.|`|plsx63Ioaa	In my opinion I wouldn't go to a website. You have no idea if you've hooked up with  a puppy mill!!!!All those people want is the money and they don't care about how those animals are taken care of.And you have to worry about in-breeding which can cause genetic defects later on. If you can't find a breeder near you where you can go to see the conditions that the dogs have been living in, I suggest the pound. A dog that has been abandoned would be so grateful for a good home. And who knows,you just might find that Labrador you want.!!Good luck whatever you do.             Thanks Trish|`|0g3oaBeOaa	I suggest looking in local newspapers for ads with Labrador puppies for sale from reliable breeders. Or you can also look at local shelters (it is almost that time of year when they become busy).<br>  Buying a puppy online is too risky. You could get scammed, the puppy could be from a mill (meaning a sick puppy), etc. <br>  If you do find a website, make sure that the person is a reliable breeder. Call and speak with them, schedule an appointment with them to view the facilities and the dogs. Petfinder is a good website to look for dogs that are looking for a good home.<br>  Just please be aware of online scams and puppy mills. In the long run, the research will make both you and your new puppy happy. :)|`|0a068969824f98b1da05200ede17d217aa	Please, please , PLEASE got to a shelter.

w1lh1INHaa	Yes, my cats have a veterinarian.  Two, in fact.<br>  <br>  No, it is not okay not to take a cat to a vet.  It needs altering, check ups, and at least some vaccinations.<br>  <br>  Not many of us do have money these days.  But, there is always a way to find it, even if it means eating dry cereal for a month.  There are shelters and other organizations to help with vet bills.|`|35f126768433fb7bc9a5037cf6657dbcaa	i don't have money either, but my vet isn't expensive a typical visit costs about 20 dollars...for the health of my cat i can afford the vet.<br>  save a little each week if you have to or tell the vet that you'll pay it out. but your pet must have veterinary care to atleast some degree. (shots and spaying/neutering anyway)|`|SOxdyWQOaa	no|`|f5a8d99afbb73cd0703df99b87996901aa	At some point in every cat's life there will be a reason to see a vet.  Rabies vaccines are required by law in most states and your cat has to be spayed/neutered in order to prevent pregnancy and diseases of the reproductive tract. It is also illegal to have a sick pet and not seek medical care for it. If you can't afford vet care for your pet, you have no business having one.|`|lTsDwY9Paa	All 6 of my cats go to the vet once a year for check ups and annual shots. The dogs go twice a year because they need Bordetella twice a year to go to doggy day care.|`|AA10475412	My cat goes to the vet only for his rabies shot.|`|HtDD1Banaa	Cats have to be brought to a veterinarian because they need yearly shots (vacinations) to protect them from diseases and also need their health checked. It's also important to get your cat spayed/neutered because you don't want a bunch of kittens running around. If you don't have any money you really shouldn't own a cat, they can be very expensive and need proper vet care. Just contact an animal shelter, like the SPCA and see if they'll accept your cat...good luck|`|8584e0329fb17c662606d5a6a8650ee2aa	If you can't afford a vet, you can't afford a cat.  Cats needs preventative health care, vaccinations, spaying and neutering like any pet.|`|EqfWi7Ohaa	no- there are usually low cost spay and neuter clinics also there are clinics for low cost vaccinations - check with your local ASPCA|`|nb9Ky2Draa	eww gross, my cat doesnt have vd
LAXxaxAZaa	Don't brush it! That's one of the worst things you can do to a tail. You'll thin it out and those hairs will take forever to grow back. My mare's tail touches the ground, too. I pick the shavings and tangles out by hand and I keep it in a loose braid. The braid will make it short enough that he won't step on it. If you want you can keep it in a tail bag, just make sure you don't tie it too tightly.<br>  <br>  <br>  EDIT -- Those tail bags work great : ]|`|Xobbmd7Saa	Just cut off a few inches like 3 or 4. It will grow back. Colts rear and play and if they step on it, they could rip it out or fall on their backs and hurt themselves. After you trim it, wash it out and put it in a tail bag.|`|B6zl0AJDaa	I've used tail bags for decades on horses who I've allowed to grow their tails nice and long without issue.  Just wash it, use conditioner then braid it up nicely and put it in a bag.  Laser sheen works wonders for keeping it tangle free.|`|QpN1OJ2aaa	dont cut it!!! you can get  a tail bag so it dosnt get dirty and tangled|`|1kSRPadaaa	he could stand on i and rip it all out, just trim it a bit. it will also make it look thicker|`|ejj2N3uaaa	My sister's WP horse has a super long tail as well. We just braid it and leave it in the braid for weeks at a time--it makes it shorter so it doesn't get stepped on, but it keeps it from getting tangled/torn as well. If braiding doesn't work (if it stills drags the ground after it's braided), try a tail bag. Take it out every so often and carefully comb it out (use a conditioner or show sheen or something to detangle it first), but basically just leave it alone, either braided or in a bag :). Just make sure you check it periodically so that if there is a problem (like a knot forming) you can get it out before it gets too serious.|`|K4bJgTF4aa	trim it, dont brush it.  finger through it with tons of show sheen. brushing it only pulls hairs out and they take a long time to grow back.|`|D0zrK0JCaa	ok since he is so young i would do a trim to about his pasterns so when he gets to breeding age it will have grown out again and it will be all long and flowy. good luck|`|BI1GbIZUaa	I wouldn't trim it it's great that it's so long. Also please don't leave it braided or in a tail bag all the time. Tails are made for swishing and in a bag or braided will be uncomfortable for your horse. Also it can cause the hair to break off at the top and not grow back. It's ok for short periods of time if it's really muddy. To keep tangles out I suggest show sheen. My horse moved to a new barn and within a week his entire tail was full of burrs. I had to comb them all out. To keep it from happening again i spray it with show sheen. It's silicone based so it doesn't wash out with every rain. Since I've just had to keep it sprayed with show sheen and run my fingers through it every once in awhile. You won't have to brush it out regularly.|`|ecf159d9c2d48432e189d0cac81882e2aa	"Fold" it up so it's off the ground, and wrap it in VetWrap. <br>  It will help keep it from getting tangled and dirty. It basically is the same as getting a tailbag, but it might be hard to find a tail bag small enough for a mini. :) <br>  <br>  Just make sure you don't wrap the hair that is over the tail bone, start the wrap underneath it.<br>  <br>  Edit: The tail bags with the strings on the end are good. Just make sure it's not too tight and not on the bone. You might have trouble finding one small enough for your mini. If the tail bag or strings drag on the ground he could step on it and pull it off. It's happened to me before. :)|`|qW0tq6A2aa	you should def trim it.... since he's only 10 months old, more will DEFINITELY grow back... however, if you don't trim it, it will only get longer and this is actually a safety hazard... if he backs up he can step up on it and RIP a chunk of his tail out... i've seen it happen many times before, or if he rears at anytime (which is highly likely given that he is a colt) he can easily rip it out too.... ripping a chunk of tail out is not only extremely painful for him and slightly traumatizing, but it will thin his tail as well and could take an extremely long time (if not never) to grow back... just trim it.. or at least keep it in a tail bag, but it will only continue to grow longer... eventually when he reaches maturity it will stop, but as we both know, that won't be for a while....<br>  <br>  not to mention, do you really want it dragging along on the ground? and if you're worried about tangles, i have a suggestion... DON'T use horse conditioner... i have yet to find one that is good and isn't extremely overpriced... get a conditioner that you really like that works on your own hair and use it... i personally love pantene pro-v conditioner... i use it on my horses and wash it right out and take a brush (not a comb... they take too long and are too painful) and i can literally brush straight through the tail without having to spray any detangler on it... pantene is cheaper than any decent horse conditioner and you're not going to have to buy detangler on top of it.
Nzb5QmNXaa	You can leave the skin on. They will eat the insides first, but they love to eat all of it. You can freeze slices or blanch them (boil water and then put the veggie in for 10 to 30 seconds). They also like zucchini.<br>  <br>  Yay for feeding your pleco veggies.

NIPmV4uMaa	Yes, PetCo's feeders are just as good as any other feeders. It's just your snake. My BP doesn't take f/t either. You may have to use live mice. ALWAYS ALWAYS ALWAYS ALWAYS supervise your snake while there is a live rodent in the enclosure.<br>  Here is what may happen if you leave a rodent alone with a snake: <a href="http://ball-pythons.net/forums/showthread.php?t=80904&highlight=perspective" rel="nofollow">http://ball-pythons.net/forums/showthrea...</a><br>  <br>  There are some "tricks" to get a ball python to eat f/t, but they don't always work:<br>  <a href="http://www.anapsid.org/ballfeed.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.anapsid.org/ballfeed.html</a><br>  <br>  Sometimes a BP just won't eat. Last night, mine ate for the first time in 3 months. I ran around the house screaming. Anyways, it is common that they fast during the breeding season (winter).

BUT, if your snake starts losing weight, you should take it to a vet.|`|ZciTIyuCaa	I've tried feeding my Ball Python Frozen/thawed mice, it just wont touch 'em.<br>  <br>  Try feeding it live feeder mice from any pet store that sells them, that's pretty much your only option for a picky snake.<br>  <br>  If he doesn't eat those then you may need to take it to a vet, a snake that doesn't eat will eventually die. Although, they can go months without eating and live, it's not in particularly good for their health.|`|qUGVYNItaa	did you try fried mice? it tastes like fried rice to snakes.
Nzb5QmNXaa	There are a few possible reasons.<br>  <br>  First, 40ppm for nitrate is fine. Don't let it get any higher though because it will become toxic after 40ppm. Are you using a gravel siphon when you clean the tank? It will help with the decaying food.<br>  <br>  Second, when you cleaned the filter, did you change the filter or rinse it off completely? If so, this would be the reason. If your test kit says you have no ammonia, then the cloudiness is a bacteria bloom. It won't harm your fish. It should clear within the week. Don't do a water change until it clears.<br>  <br>  If it's not cleared up in 10 days, then do a water change and test your water again. It could be something else if it doesn't clear up. I'm 98% sure that it is just a bacteria bloom. I can't be 100% sure without seeing the tank personally (which is impossible).|`|OjXvYEZDaa	Ah maybe it was tapwater you have rinsed filter that made cloudly. so Now you know you have to clean filter with the tank water that you took out while u are water changing. BTW, I just saw your video, the tank looks bigger than 20 gallon?|`|2DHnQZ4xaa	Clean or replace your filter.|`|zzaN4wG3aa	It's not that noticeable, but it is clearly bad enough for you to post here.  There are really only 4 causes:<br>  1) bacterial bloom - generally part of cycling<br>  2) algae bloom - generally more green in color<br>  3) suspended "dust" from the substrate.  <br>  4) suspended air that will fizz out<br>  <br>  based on what you said above, I would suspect #1 - I know it'sw a mature tank, but a sudden additional bio load (such as decomposing shrimp pellets) can cause a mini-cycle.  It's been my experience that there is nitrite spike associated with this kind of cloudiness.|`|DU7iO8EHaa	If you have a 20 gallon filter that fits your tank. You should either get two of  them or a Rena Smartfilter for 30 gallons. That should keep your nitrates down.|`|hKfVit0Laa	simple add more water and make sure your filter is reaching the water|`|39a2d5e9bc3c417cbdc5ba33cb6386bbaa	Maybe you could upgrade your filter if nitrate won't come down at all and you are a little overstocked.  That would help, just make sure you put the old filter cartridge in there if you do get a new one so you don't start the cycle over again.  I assume you know that you should always see nitrates in your tank, but it would be good to bring it down some.. 40 is really the highest it should go.  The only thing I can think of is to change the carbon out of your filter and put some new carbon in.<br>  <br>  Oh yeah the rinsing in tap water could've killed off enough bacteria to cause a bacteria bloom later.  Just keep an eye on the water parameters and keep doing water changes.  And remember, only rinse your filter in your old tank water after a water change!
Um8osMNuaa	They eat poo for a few different reasons.<br>  lt can be a learnt behaviour from the b*tch who will eat the pups faeces to keep their sleeping area clean.

How to stop it, i do know.<br>  <br>  We have several beagles, we hunt with them.  Every few years we will get a dog that will do this.  Like any undesirable action that a dog does, and you want stopped, i find there are 2 ways to do it.<br>  <br>  1: The long way.  When the dog wants to eat the feces, scold it quickly, and turn it away from the feces.  Do this every time and you should be able to remove the behavior in a few weeks/months.<br>  <br>  2: The short way.  There is a saying that "a good *** whooping will make an elephant mind".  This works on dogs as well.  A favorite way, although sometimes expensive, is to get a training collar (sometimes known as a shock collar) and use it on the dog.  When the dog goes to eat the feces, shock them (following instructions included w/ the collar) and do this every time.  This same process can be used to stop a dog from anything, and even more (such as getting a dog to come when you call it, ETC.)  Other methods include a reed, rolled up news paper, or a swift kick to the rear.  Even a slight poke to the area just in front of the hip bone is uncomfortable.  Try it on yourself, just above the hip bone, its not fun, but it works.  If the dog associates pain w/ eating feces, then it wont do it any more.<br>  <br>  Simple Pavlov's salivating dogs stuff.|`|riCfCxjEaa	Go into any park loaded with ducks and geese and for your dogs, it's like walking into a Chinese Buffet!  That's good stuff as far as they are concerned!  I would start working on the "Leave It" command which is a command you use when there is something your dog is never going to get.  Start in your home by putting a dry crunchy treat down on the floor.  Have something way better, like bits of cheese, cooked hot dog, chicken, the softer and smellier the better.  Put your dog on leash and walk near the biscuit but not quite near enough that your dog can grab it.  When he starts to go for it, quickly put the yummy treat near his nose, call his name to get his attention and say "leave it" one time then treat him when he turns away from the hard biscuit and turns toward you.  He must never get the biscuit because that will be his reward.  As he learns the "leave it" command you can up the treat on the ground, eventually working up to something as good as goose poop but your reward has to be better as well like cheese or something.  This is a great thing for dogs to learn so practice up!  Especially when a chicken bone or something gets dropped on the ground!

ks2z4po8aa	You've gotten very good responses and links from the other posters so, by all means, do your research and deal responsibly and only with ethical hobby breeders that health-screen their dogs... The best place to actually meet breeders is by attending local dog shows (which are generally free to the public or charge a modest entry fee): <a href="http://www.infodog.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.infodog.com</a> <br>  <br>  I've been around French Bulldogs since 1992... The first Frenchie we got lived to be 14 and never spent a day in the hospital... She was healthy her entire life, had zero allergies, and was perfectly alright and able to walk up until the last 2 weeks of her life when she was diagnosed with lymphoma... If a French Bulldog lives beyond 12 or 13 years, every day is a "gift"... I presently have 4 French Bulldogs ranging in age from an 11-week-old puppy through 7 years of age... They're all in good health, thankfully... Am blessed to have met a terrific breeder that has consistently produced exceptional dogs... None of them have spinal or osteo problems... None of them have ever had to undergo corrective surgeries for elongated soft palates or pinched stenotic nares... And none of them have any allergies... They go to the vet once a year for thorough check-ups and vaccinations, and that's all... <br>  <br>  To maintain my dogs healthy, I feed them a blend of top-notch foood, 1000 mgs of fish oil and 200 I/Us of Vitamin E daily, bathe them regularly in Tom's of Maine All-Natural Glycerin Soap, clean their ears regularly, and maintain a clean and eco-friendly / "green" home.<br>  <br>  Good luck in your endeavors : )|`|GaL66jbQaa	You significantly increase your chances of a healthy dog if you go to a good breeder.  Generally frenchies are healthier.|`|3giaPYe8aa	I have a 6 year old Bulldog.  The breed is not called an English Bulldog, it is registered with the AKC as Bulldog.  I did NOT get my dog from a reputable breeder.  I purchased/re-homed her from an ad in the paper for the low, low price of $1,100.00 when she was 5 months old.  We found out that she originally was bred at a Mennonite puppy mill.  She is severely dysplastic and was diagnosed at 6 months old when she was spayed.  If I would have went to a responsible breeder and paid $2500.00, I would have much less of a chance that she would have this problem to the degree that it is. 87% of all Bulldogs have Hip Dysplasia, but when it is mild, most dogs can live much more comfortably than my girl. (She is on 2 medications and a prescription dog food, for life)  Believe me, if I would have spent more money up front for a well bred Bulldog, I would have saved thousands of $'s in medical bills over the years.  So, along with the HD, 2 bad knees and arthritis,  things could actually be worse as we have no skin or eye problems. (Breathing issues are a *given* especially in the heat and cold)  If you want to keep a Bulldog healthy, you first must purchase a healthy pup, and than learn about all their special needs, including keeping any excess weight off of them.|`|rLDf1gGGaa	Again it depends on the breed and the parents and the way you care for it and give it exercise. <br>  <br>  Thinking about buying a puppy? If you buy a dog over the Internet, at a pet store or through a newspaper ad, your new pooch may very well be from a puppy mill—a mass dog breeding operation. Protect yourself from scams and don't be fooled into buying an overpriced, possibly sick puppy. <br>  <br>  French Bulldog-10-12years life expectancy<br>  Temperament:   This hilarious little dog makes a wonderful playmate and is very affectionate. Alert and clingy, this breed does require lots of human attention to thrive. This is not a kennel breed and should always be kept in a family environment. Given proper socialization the French Bulldog can do well with other dogs, but should not be around small children, as they do not tolerate rough play.<br>  <br>  French Bulldogs are prone to eye and respiratory problems. If too overweight, the French Bulldog  may have trouble breathing, because of a swollen abdomen. They may wheeze, snore and be gassy. It is said breed can not swim because of his physique, so be very careful around swimming pools, however some French Bulldog owners have reported that their dogs can indeed swim. Sometimes bitches must deliver by Cesarean section because of the puppies' large heads. Potential purchasers should be aware that these are high maintenance dogs and you can expect your vet bills can be big.<br>  <br>  Frenchies are sensitive to temperature extremes. Overheating this dog may cause heat stroke. They prefer cooler climates. This breed is good for apartment life. They can be fairly active indoors and will do okay without a yard.<br>  <br>  English Bulldog-8years life expectancy<br>  Temperament:   The English Bulldog can display dominating behavior and requires a firm handler to show him his place. Great for a loving family, the English Bulldog gives a lot of love and attention, and expects it in return. This breed has been used as a guard dog, and does exceptionally well given the correct training.<br>  <br>  Breathing problems; some have small windpipes as well. Also poor eyesight, very susceptible to heat stroke in warm weather or hot rooms and cars. Very cold sensitive. Puppies often delivered by caesarian section because of their broad heads. Its digestive system is very active and may be offensive to people with sensitive noses. Susceptible to skin infections. Also hip and knee problems.<br>  <br>  The English Bulldog is good for apartment life. They are very inactive indoors and will do okay without a yard. This breed is an indoor dog. Bulldogs do best in temperate climates as the breed can chill easily in cold weather and have trouble cooling off in very hot weather.
40IUKsC2aa	you could try that <br>  or if you want drill 2 holes on the cage so you could tie the water bottle|`|1YtcGLHraa	ok i had the same prob this is what i done first take the cage lid off and cover it with cardbored so you can cut a hole in it to put a water bottle in. a bowl isnt tht good of an idea because they will tip it over alot, poop/pee in it, and walk in it  if they walk in it they will get wet tali and tht isnt good|`|BI1GbIZUaa	I would use a shallow water dish so that he can't drown. Make sure to check it often so if it gets dirty you can change it. Or hang a tiny tube water bottle from the ceiling low enough for him to get to it. You can also give him lots of lettuce because that has a high water content in it.|`|GaSK15Kpaa	Hi<br>  Bowls of water arent that good because food, poo and wee can all get in and infect it. <br>  The jar lid might work. but you can get a water bottle with a suction on it so that u attach it to the side or you could just attach some adhesive sticky stuff to a normal water bottle and stick it on.<br>  <br>  Luci|`|mD4od8xRaa	How small a hamster are we talking about?Plastic cages are not recommended at all for a hamster. Even at a young age,they may chew through their cage if you use a plastic cage.<br>  <br>  It is not a good idea to place a bowl of water in your hamster cage as,besides from the possibility that your hamster may drown,it may spill in the cage and soil the bedding of your hamster,which isn't very hygienic and may cause certain problems and diseases.<br>  <br>  But if you really cannot do what I suggest you do(buy metal wired cage and a water bottle),then you may place a bowl of water ONLY in certain conditions:<br>  1.the bowl should only cover up a small space in the cage.<br>  2.the bowl should be filled only with shallow amount of water.Place in only the amount of water your hamster will need for a day.|`|5UQiaSq1aa	It should be fine, as long as the bowl is shallow. Also, what I have is a water bottle that is suctioned cup to the tank wall. It basically is stuck there, and then to refill it, all you have to do is press this button, and the water bottle comes off so you can refill it. I got mine for my hamster at petsmart. Your hamster sounds cute by the way...:-)|`|JIdDcTXGaa	I don't think you have to really worry about it drowning. It will, however, but things in it to soak up the water, like lab blocks, bedding, paper, etc. This is a natural instinct so water does not spread to the nest. It is safe to put a water bowl in the cage, but you will need to clean it out every few hours to get out any stuff it may put in there. While I was setting up my mouse cage I put a bowl in it until I could locate the water bottle for the cage, which was the next day. I had 4 babies and mama drinking out of it at once, when I got them home. The babies would perch on the side of the bowl while mama was outside the bowl. I got them shortly after their eyes opened but they were still nursing.<br>  <br>  Hope this helps|`|k9gC23apaa	Get a new cage.  Hamster, not a big brain on them.  Unless you want your hamster to commit suicide and drown himself, I would highly recommend a new cage.|`|WHlabsvxaa	be careful it needs a more little thing like a small bowl like a bottle cap <br>  that pig but nor to pig.|`|GK57zwmSaa	I would use something like a jar lid that will hold very little water and you'll have no worries|`|Czh1fbQgaa	Water bowl is a bad idea. Get a bottle w/ suction cups.|`|tT256JQRaa	yes you can - as said above though, only a little jar lid, as you dont want him drowning - you'll have to change it regularly though as if its kept on woodshavings, them hammy will kick all the shavings into the water :(<br>  i did this when my water bottle broke, and the hamster was fine :)<br>  <br>  you can also get bottles like this (i had one for my gerbil) <a href="http://www.petcentreonline.co.uk/ecommerce/ProdImages/84672070.gif" rel="nofollow">http://www.petcentreonline.co.uk/ecommer...</a> that come with suckers on the back, as well as that front part, do you can stick it to a plastic cage as well as a wire cage<br>  you'll have to watch him, and maybe dip his nose in really gently just to let him know its there - careful not to drown him though haha
3C3EIFtraa	I totally disagree with the comment made above.  If your dog stops whining when you give her attention then she is not in pain.  I think she is very smart, and has realized that you will pay attention to her whenever she cries.  <br>  <br>  In order to solve this problem you are going to have to ignore her when she cries.  When she whines, turn your back on her, and when she stops crying, then reward her with your attention!   You should also make sure that you are always the one to initiate play time.  Don't let her decide when you have to play with her.  You are the boss, not her!  <br>  <br>  Also, if your dog is tired she will be less likely to need your constant affection.  So make sure you are taking her for lots of walks.  It would be great if she could go somewhere secure and play off leash with other dogs too.  This really helps get the energy out!|`|hxXaB5kFaa	Your dog isn't a big baby. You are more of an ignorent parent to the dog.<br>  You think your dog is just an animal that won't suck it up?<br>  NOT AT ALL!<br>  Your dog is crying about something that I don't know of.<br>  It's your role to figure it out and help her stop.<br>  The dog is an animal, not a toy.|`|B8Gwxo1laa	A bit spoiled. eh? :) If you want to break her of this you're going to have to ignore it. Many times.|`|sCnksozaaa	yup|`|5SmX1oLlaa	she sounds like she has anxiety issues she needs a lot more exercise maybe. maybe let her run about and hour at a dog park if you have one and let all that excess energy relieve it's self.|`|rxNnj5MQaa	Yeha, he's a baby...<br>  <br>  Or he's in pain|`|umEgRb7Vaa	Your dog would drive me crazy.|`|1neMZoRLaa	heh, cute, that's for sure<br>  <br>  your dog probably  is a baby

I have the SAM (small animal module) Jungle cage (second one ordered, just waiting for arrival) and a plastic cage, I believe it the SAM country club or health club or something. They are all stack-able, so we have them stacked and when we change the litter, we change the cage set up, change the tubes, just to give them a change. They are loving how it is now, side by side this time. It's going to be interesting when we get the new cage because we are getting new tubes and such too.

t6UkxbBNaa	you don't need to take them to a vet every time you buy a new one! just quarantine them (keep them in a different building not in the next room, a virus doesn't know what a door is) for 2 weeks them you can put them in with your herd. join the ARBA they are a great organization and will help you with breeding and caring for rabbits. Join your nation breed club too, they can give your more breed specific help! EVERY BREEDER NO MATTER HOW LONG THEY'VE BRED ALWAYS HAVE QUESTIONS!! Don't sell to pet stores your rabbitry will be tagged as a rabbit mill. Go to shows in your local area, Showing is ALOTTTT of fun!!!!!! Rabbits are totally awesome!! You also need to get a tattooer (the EZ-TATT is the quickest) it may sound cruel but every breeder does it. Keep pedigrees of your rabbits!!! if you have any questions email me at haretastic@aol.com|`|znGpjsGjaa	The first step if you live in the USA is to join the ARBA. This organization has helped hundred of people get started in breeding rabbits.  ARBA-  <a href="http://www.arba.net" rel="nofollow">http://www.arba.net</a><br>  <br>   You also have to consider why you want to breed rabbits. As rabbit breeding is more of a hobby than a career. You will never earn a living from breeding rabbits.<br>  <br>  A good place to start is at an ARBA rabbit show. Go there and just observe for the first show and talk to breeders especially of the <br>  breed(s) you are considering. Perhaps even find a mentor in your breed. ARBA breeders love to help other people get started in the "rabbit habit"|`|lpiMi3s3aa	First, take them to a vet see if there verified or any diseases then decide, can I afford this. Make sure you no how to breed if don't ask local vet. Do you got space? p.s are you selling them?
3BMBZtDxaa	Have you tried a head collar? Those things work wonders for larger dogs! The reason why the harness didn't work is because a harness goes around the strongest point on the dogs body-their chest! So when you think it'll be a helpful training device, it's really giving your dog the advantage. Chain collars usually don't help because you cannot praise the dog for the correct thing, so simply as soon as you take it off, he continues pulling. Or, he ignores the choke collar itself and pulls anyways. A head collar goes around their head so when they pull, the head is turned towards you so it becomes near impossible to pull. They go for about $15 I believe. Anyways, use it with your dog on every walk. If he pulls, let him pull. The head collar will do it's job. Once he stops, reward him. Since he is very treat motivated, I'm not sure you want to use food. Because then he'll think that every time he stops pulling he'll get food, so he'll purposely pull so you'll give him a treat. Instead, tell him "good boy" or give him a pat on the head so he recognizes that you want him to stop pulling, but won't think you'll give him a treat everytime he stops pulling.<br>  <br>  Also, you can try the circles again. I think you may have quit before it took full effect. How long has he pulled on walks? I'm assuming he's in his adult years if he's having this much of a problem, so that's a long time! It may take you up to an hour of walking in ovals before he'll stop. Try putting on the head collar and doing this exercise again. Everytime he pulls, dig your heels in and turn quickly. Now that you have control of his head, he's forced to follow. That's a rule, the body follows where the head goes. So just do this over and over and over again. He'll eventually wear out and go with you. Once he does, you can praise him (excluding treats) and continue on your walk. I suggest you do this AFTER he's had some hard exercise so he will be more tired so it'll take less time.<br>  <br>  A dog becomes stubborn when they're clever. That's why I seriously ask people if they truly want an intellegent dog. Sometimes, this will work against you, such as in your situation. This is cured when you don't give up. Get him on a leash and bring him into a confined room. That way if he gets away, he can't leave the room. Do not bring treats with you. Have him focus on you and tell him the sit command. If he doesn't listen, fold your arms and think "big". You'd be surprised! Dogs respond well to energy, which you can generate by thoughts. When you're scared or unconfident, your dog will feed off that. But when you fold your arms, stand tall, (don't be threatening, just big), and think "big", he'll get a message that you're an authority figure. Wait for him to respond. It may take you sitting there for 20 minutes, but you must wait. At some point, this dog will sit. After 20 minutes of standing in the same position, I know you'll want to be sitting! Have him on the leash so if he tries to move or leave, you can keep him there. As soon as he sits, give him a pat on the head and let him go. Ten minutes later, bring him back and repeat the exercise. I suggest you do this on a day where you have nothing to do, because it'll most likely take you a little while. Do this as often as possible. The reward for sitting should be allowing him to go and do whatever he wants. Or, you could even let him out into the backyard for some play time. Whatever it is, make it pleasurable but without a treat. Also, during this time, only say the command once or twice. Don't continually repeat it. The dog will only get things mixed up, and he'll most likely shut you out. A dog gets it's sense of smell first, then sight, and then touch. So while humans respond extremely well to hearing, dogs don't. So you cannot just repeat the command praying for him to obey, you can only say it once and wait for him to do his job. It'll make training go a lot faster!<br>  <br>  A stubborn dog is fixed by a stubborn owner! Remember that. And stick to what I told you and he should be doing a lot better!<br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|5PWzxw4Xaa	Dog Trainer - Teaching a Dog To Sit<br>  <br>  I do not use food to entice good behavior.  I have them on a leash without any lead what so ever.  I use a harness not a collar. (my preference-neck jerking is not good for a dog)<br>  I tug the leash say the word sit in a stern and serious manner.  I take one hand under the chin to keep his attention directed at me while the other hand pushes the rump in a sit position.  I continue doing this over and over and while in the sit position say “good sit...nice job” this is repeated several times.  Lift your hand off the rump...he will probably stand up immediately at first then do it all over again.  Spend about 10 min. doing this, take about a 30 min. brake and do it again...do this as often as you like.  If you have a 1/2 day, full day, just the one time.  Do it when you get home from work/school, do it before and after dinner, before bed....you get the picture.  After the sit command is learned then you can go on to leash training...or mix it up a little..your choice.  Do what works for you and your dog.<br>  When taking a dog out for a walk first off you need to be the pack leader.  SInce your dog does not fully understand this yet here is how you teach them.  Never give a dog full lead when on a walk when they do not have the social skills to handle that kind of freedom.  It is not fair to the dog to assume he will just act socially acceptable...they do not know what we do not teach.  This being said, potty your dog outside in your yard before you leave.  Then put on the harness/leash.  Do not give your dog any more lead than what will keep them in a heel position.  Walk and chronically tell your dog “nice walk..good job...stay with me...nice work Buster (name of your dog)”  When the leash is being strained by a overly vigorous dog...just give it a tug, put him in a sit position with a stern, but not loud command.  This just helps them to get back some self control.  Remember that when a stew is being made we say “mmmm that smells good” while a dog can smell each and every ingredient put in the stew.  So while outside there are an abundance of smells that will bring on excitability.  This doesn’t mean your dog is out of control or stupid...it means there is a lot out there that dogs face (in the excite mental side) that we just do not see or think about.  Once we are aware of these it is easier to show a bit more grace/boundaries needed.  If your dog has to go potty do not let him any more than his body length away from you.  That way you are out of “shot” but he is not too far so you do not lose control.  You can start with leash training even in your own back yard to keep his attention span a little easier before going out if you like.  It does help push the process on a little faster and since it's familiar territory he won't be so high strung with new smells, sounds or people.  <br>  I hope this helps somehow.|`|MuczO57Laa	Take him to a trainer that what i did its only cost about 100 a month its kinda cheep.Or say the trick over and over and when he dose it right reward him wit a treat he'll get the hang of it<br>  Hope i hlped :)|`|gAP0pCMxaa	I use a headcollar on my dog, it isn't anything like a muzzle, just a helpful device that stops the dog being so strong!<br>  Keep going with the training!<br>  Good Luck|`|nBehRANyaa	Your best bet is to go to a beginning obedience class.|`|AVsh5aJUaa	when train dogs you have to be consistent and do not give up ....when walking your dog keep the choke collar on and keep her close when your dog pull the choker should automatically close do not jerk or pull yourself ... the dog will eventually learn that if they do not pull the chain want get ti also take away the food when training petting and hugging will be the reward. now with sitting their is a little indentation in the back between the hind legs when you take your index finger and say sit it sometimes work if all else fails look at the dog whisper on bravo if you have cable
veDvtYhJaa	The key word in your question is "rescued".  St. Bernards tend to be calm and not aggressive.  The same is true for Great Pyrenees.<br>  THEREFORE<br>  You need to see if you can find out anything about her history before you rescued her.  You need to join a support group, and so I'll include a link to an excellent Pyr group here at Yahoo for you to join.  <br>  <br>  The reason you need to join a group is that you have not given us enough information about her for us to adequately answer your question.  You gave her age, which is good.  You didn't explain anything about what you see as aggressive reactions on her part, and what events appear to have triggered this response.  You didn't say if she appears aggressive to humans or to animals.  You didn't tell us anything about her background.  <br>  <br>  Most rescues come with emotional "baggage".  The reasons why the dog ended up in rescue are likely to tell us much about what has caused her to act the way she does.<br>  <br>  I'd expect a rescue to be extremely shy at first.  If she has reason to be unsure how she'll be treated, she'll be shy until she understands that you love her and will treat her well.  <br>  <br>  Without knowing how she's acting and something about her background, no explanation given here as to why she might be shy has little chance of being accurate <br>  <br>  You may need to ask your vet for a referral to an animal behaviorist for help on how to deal with her.  She's a big dog, so you don't want her to be aggressive. <br>  <br>  I'll give you some links to websites that help you know how to be alpha pack leader, as she'll need you to be a good, loving, strong pack leader.  Also, two basic training sites.  I'll add three on animal behavior that may help you understand how dogs think and react Good Luck. -!-|`|0k2y3bNgaa	Abused probably.<br>  Although, I have a dog who lived with 35 other dogs till she was five, and is EXTREMELY shy since she got like no human contact.

I had the same problem with my Mastiff and she eventually had to be euthanized after much heartbreak, many medications, professionals, and training techniques. You NEED to get to a behaviorist- not a trainer immediately. Hopefully she doesn't get worse but please be prepared for the possibility. Do not mess around with this, she's a big dog and this can progress very quickly. I swore that my dog would never actually threaten someone- just run away, then she started lunging, then nipping, then biting, and finally going for the throat. She was my baby girl and I had so much love invested in her as well as time and 10,000 dollars and none of it worked. I wish I had seen a behaviorist first and not tried going to puppy classes/veterinarians. <br>  <br>  I wish you all the luck in the world and please please please see a behaviorist so you don't lose her like I did.<br>  <br>  <br>  Add: Riley was not abused. She was just not socialized from a young age. Some dogs also inherit a fear gene that causes this. Don't listen to them about Petsmart, we went there first and the girl was wonderful but they are not trained to deal with this and won't allow you to come in if she's a "little aggressive."

You've got to show her how loving, and nice people can be, and I promise she'll love you to death. :] If you got her from a shelter, her previous owners might have verbally and physically abused her, and like I said, you've just got to love her with ALL your heart, and soon she'll become less shy, and more your best friend. <br>  <br>  Hope I helped, and enjoy your new dog! :]|`|AVsh5aJUaa	number one You got her from a rescue place so she might have been abused and also let her know you will not hurt her and be very careful when letting her know she did wrong.

Buy a book or visit the library and read up on what you need to take care of a turtle. Make sure you pay attention to things like how big the turtle will grow (which will determine it's living habitat), what to feed him, what kind of an environment he/she will need, the type of accommodations you'll need to make to cater to his/her life, etc.<br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|0k2y3bNgaa	My 3rd grade teacher had a turtle, and let me tell you to STOCK UP ON HAND SANITIZER.

I38WF5aFaa	I have been using different types of electronic training collars on my dogs for 15 years with multiple dogs.  For a couple years I was an installing dealer for one brand of the electronic fences.   Most dogs are ready to be trained with electronics at about 5 months old.  Younger dogs don't have the ability to associate the shock with why it happened.  When the dog is mature enough to pay attention for more than a few minutes he is old enough for your fence. <br>  <br>   An electronic fence is not a physical barrier but is a tool to train your dog to stay in your yard.  The best electronic fence is no better than the training that you do to teach your dog how it works.  Some dogs will be so determined to leave their yard that they will go through despite the shock.  That can be true no matter how well the dog is trained.  When I was selling and installing underground fences there was only one dog I could not keep contained.  It was one of my own dogs.  He would stop and hesitate at the boundary,  then walk through whimpering all the way across.   <br>  A few dogs will react so strongly to the correction that it would be cruel to keep using electronic trainers with them.  These dogs are exceptions to the norm.  For most dogs electronic training collars are a humane and effective training tool.<br>  <br>  I know this goes beyond answering your question.  After reading the other answers I thought others here needed the information.|`|WYItM0YTaa	We have one of those invisible fences and have gotten two new puppies.They are almost 5 months old and they each now have a collar. The olders dogs have also sort of trained them where the bondaries are.|`|bJh1MesQaa	NEVER use a shock collar. It is abuse. Some dogs have even died from them. It can make them have a heart attack. Either get a fence or get your lazy butt up and put the dog on a leash.

How would you like that?<br>  It's abuse.<br>  You're puppies could die from it.<br>  Get a normal fence. And buy a normal collar.<br>  <br>  Edit -<br>  You may call me ignorant, but at least I am not abusing my animals. I treat them well and I know that there is NO reason to shock them. I really don't care how little it shocks them, it still shocks them. I would much rather have a leash on me, then have a shock collar on me. It may be just a small shock, but it is still enough to make a dog freak out.<br>  <br>  Honestly, I don't care what you and that other ignorant guy down there say. It would be a LOT easier, less abusive, and cheaper, to buy a normal fence to keep your dogs in. There is no excuse for using them. It's sad how horrible some people on this planet are. Maybe you get some kind of sick humor out of seeing these animals being shocked..who knows. I hope one of those dogs snaps and bites you though.|`|y0cbLn0Yaa	Firstly, regardless of breed, how do you keep your dogs safe from other dogs which may wander into your yard?  Now, as they are Pit bulls which usually have very high prey drives, how do you keep other dogs / cats / animals safe which may wander into the yard?  Would a little child be safe if they wandered into the yard?<br>  <br>  These are a few of the reasons why I dislike an invisible fence on its own.  <br>  <br>  As far as your question as to the age a puppy can wear a shock collar.  In normal cases I would say never as there are more humane and effective ways of training a dog, albeit not so quick.<br>  <br>  I would certainly not subject a puppy to shock treatment before they are mentally mature, well socialised and confident.  Depending on the breed this may not happen before 2 or 3 years of age.<br>  <br>  I won't waste my time with going through all the data of the negative effects that these types of fences can have on a dog as you are already using one successfully with your other dogs, however, not all dogs are the same and where it might be successful with one dog, another dog may be traumatised by these fences.<br>  <br>  Edit:  Quite honestly, I think that you are the ignorant one.  I have actually done quite a bit of research into these types of fences as a fencing option and what I learnt made me realise that I could not, in good conscience, subject my much loved dogs to the potential trauma caused by these fences.  I'm not sure why you can't have a traditional fence, but for me, no traditional fence = no dog.  We have bought a property recently and, believe me, the dog was very high on the list of considerations when buying it.

Some vets like to neuter males as early as 6 months; others think you should wait until he's 18-24 months old.  Here's why:  <br>  <br>  The younger you neuter a male, the younger his personality will be all his life.  If you give his mind and body time to grow, he'll be a more mature dog because his hormones will help him grow mentally as well as physically.  If you want a dog who will behave like a puppy for most of his life, (in the sense of being playful, not in the sense of nibbling, whining at night, messing in the house, etc.), then get him spayed earlier - at about 6 months.<br>  <br>  But it will be yours and your vet's decision, because your vet will know your dog better after one examination than any of us will know about him, no matter how many questions and answers are posted to this list.<br>  <br>  Good luck!<br>  <br>  Apacapacas|`|8584e0329fb17c662606d5a6a8650ee2aa	Yep, he's old enough and its fine.

The rabbit owners worst fear is Pasturella or Bordatella, "Snuffles".  This concerns those with more than one rabbit enough to sometimes euthanize the sick rabbit to save the others.  <br>  <br>  Now days, especially if you have a single rabbit or your rabbit will never be around others, most people opt for a round of meds from the vet.  There are just better meds available now days due to animal health research and development of medicines.  The Pasturella may not ever go away 100% and the rabbit usually never gets back to its former healthy self entirely but can live a perfectly happy life.  You would just never want to breed that animal as it can pass on its "hidden" illness to its offspring.<br>  <br>  FYI, most rabbits, if tested by a vet for Pasturella will test positive, so testing may do your and your rabbit no good.  It is better to look for the visible syptoms and treat if appropriate.<br>  <br>  Signs of "Snuffles" are sneezing out white snot.  If he's blowing snot, you've got a problem.  Ask your rabbit experienced vet for info about treating.<br>  <br>  Now, I had a rabbit that I brought to a show and was quite surprised to see him sneeze three or four times and then blow out whitish boogers.  My thoughts went right to snuffles.  However, I did not see or hear him sneeze after that until two weeks later (with no snot).  I took him to the vet and we did not find any trouble.  I suspect it was a small piece of hay irritating his nose and he just had to get it out.  We concluded he did not have Snuffles.<br>  <br>  So look at each rabbit separately.  Look at the circumstances surrounding the sneezing.  Have you changed hays?  Does he sneeze only when you clean his cage?  Or is it frequent?  Is there snot?  Does he look "not quite himself"?<br>  <br>  I can't tell your why your particular rabbit is sneezing but know that when a rabbit does sneeze, it is worth investigating.  <br>  <br>  Best wishes.|`|UXAaAYn5aa	Rabbits, like humans can be allergic or can have respiratory infections.  Knowing the difference is the important issue.<br>  <br>  House dust, perfume, fabric softener, room fresheners, cigarette smoke, pot pouri and many more things found in every house can cause rabbits to become allergic.   Products used for bedding or litter like pine, cedar, or clay litters can also be the culprit.|`|C75EsUXRaa	Well you got me stumped I have kept 3 houserabbits over a period of 7 years and I ain't ever heard any sneeze, somethings not right I would go talk to the vet,|`|nuc5DBD8aa	Why do you sneeze?<br>  It's the same thing i think. :)|`|2faae7b556bae8292adc7e81ca55ca8aaa	they sneeze because theyre cold|`|kJZtiS8Kaa	It could be a cold, infection or Allergy.<br>  Have you changed the bedding recently, or if they are indoor rabbits, have you used any cleaning products around them, is there a lot of dust in the room etc.<br>  If in doubt I would go for a Health Check especially if your rabbits Vaccinations are not up to date.|`|QSwvN2lqaa	Usually pets are sneezing from the same reason as humans.

6RILqhzEaa	Yes, I have a cat that had ringworm. He was the only one out of my 5 cats, and I did not get the ringworm. I did not give my cat drugs, but I did try some nasty prescription topical crap but ended up throwing it away. I consulted with a holistic veterinarian and worked on getting my cats into excellent health by using diet, supplements and herbs. I also used an herbal topical solution. My cat got over the ringworm within 2 months and has not had ringworm or any other skin problems since, nor have any of the other cats.<br>  <br>  Not all animals or people get ringworm, and it is due to the immune system. The immune system of people and animals that succumb to ringworm is weak due to poor nutrition, or otherwise compromised by an underlying disease. You need to make sure both pets' immune systems are in top notch shape. Make sure both are eating a top quality diet, and if possible consult with a holistic veterinarian for supplements and/herbs to help the immune systems. <br>  <br>  It's very difficult to kill ringworm spores, but I'd quit spraying that Lysol all over the place. It can make your pets sick and is not killing those spores. The best way is to kill ringworm spores is to use a bleach solution at a 1:10 (bleach:water) ratio on the hard surfaces. This is a very strong solution, and impractical to use on every surface, but you want to be careful with it around your pets. You must vacuum your carpets, other flooring and furniture daily and throw away the bag after each time. There is also a product called Health Guard Laundry additive that is supposed to kill fungal spores, is safe for pets, and also has a residual action. Honestly I'm not sure how effective it is against ringworm (I've heard mixed reports) but I used it to wash all my cats' blankets and beds, and sprayed it on the carpets before I vacuumed, on the hardwood floors when I cleaned them, and on curtains and furniture. Like I said, only 1 in 5 of my cats got the ringworm.<br>  <br>  Keeping the cat and dog seperated is probably not going to help the situation much because ringworm spores are actually present almost everywhere in the environment anyway. However, it is a good idea not to let them sleep together, or use each others bedding and grooming tools while there is an active case of ringworm. <br>  <br>  As for the treatments, Griseofulvin is commonly used but can produce side effects and can be very toxic for cats. Side effects include nausea, fever, lethargy, diarrhoea, anaemia.  In rare cases Griseofulvin can cause  bone marrow suppression & also liver disease in cats. Itraconazole (Sporanox) is supposed to be considerably safer, but more expensive because it needs to be prepared by a compounding pharmacy, but if your cat needs to be treated again with drugs I'd go for the Itraconazole. I opted not to use any of these drugs on my cat because I wasn't willing to chance the serious side effects, but if I ever have to use them it would be the Itraconazole. <br>  <br>  It has also been suggested that the flea treatment, Program (lufenuron), has an anti ringworm effect, and that animals on this treatment are less likely to get ringworm. However there are no officially accepted studies to support this.<br>  <br>  Ringworm usually runs about a 6 week or so course, and most animals just naturally get over it if there immune systems can recognize and fight it so the best thing to do for your pets is to make sure they have a top quality diet. Raw or semi raw is probably the best.|`|9WMgb4phaa	Well go by what your vet said but it is not just your dog that can get it you can also get it!!|`|EJv2EBAMaa	You should try keeping the cat and dog separated as best as you can until the ringworm is gone.

They can do a biobsy on it to find out what it is.|`|lPK7Lh4gaa	a growth it could be cancer it could be harmless but being that it is by the eye you should take it to the vet to make sure it wont get bigger and cause your dog to loose its eye|`|FRb3JVgfaa	it may be cancer go to the vet

You cant force him to love or trust anyone, maybe he just wants to be a stray, but you can be there for him, proved him with love and care and he will come to you when he is comfortable with you but it can take for ever! Good luck and best wishes your way!|`|f5a8d99afbb73cd0703df99b87996901aa	If you want to keep the kitten, you need to catch it and bring it inside.  Set up a small room in the house (preferably one with no beds or sofas to hide under).  Put water, litter box, and toys in the room but no food.  At feeding time bring in a bowl of yummy wet food and put it on the floor. Sit down a few feet away and be quiet.  If the kitten doesn't come to eat soon, take the food and leave.  Go back in a few minutes and try again.  Each time the kitten eats sit closer to the food next time. Within a couple of days you should be able to pet the kitten while it eats.  Never try to grab the kitten, just reach slowly to pet him.  This method has always worked for me when dealing with a scared cat.  As the kitty gets friendlier, you can let it out of the room into the house.|`|PSaaCGeAaa	Do you have the cat indoors now?  If so, I went though the same thing with one of mine when we brought her in.  I would just go to her when she was laying down and sit near her.  I did that that for a few day, than started petting her, letting her sniff my hand before I touched her.  As she got more use to me, I would pick her up and put her on my lap.  She is very independent and refuses to sit on anyone lap when they put her there, so I gave up and continued with the petting and being near her.  Now, she comes up to me for pets and even lays on my stomach when I lay down for bed.  It's just a matter of time and trying.  See what the cat likes, what makes him/her run and what they can tolerate and work on that.|`|O32XXZr1aa	Leave it to itself and give it its own space.  Let it come to you for food and it will depend on you and trust you more as time goes by.|`|A7XV2K3Paa	I did something similar to that of Pretty Kitty. I just kept encouraging it with food and gradually moved closer. Eventually, we made friends. But it took time.
