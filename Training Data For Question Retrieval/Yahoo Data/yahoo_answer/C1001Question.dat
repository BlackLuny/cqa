I put together this potential line-up being that wally z's and snow's contracts come off the books after this season, freeing up about 20 million towards signing a few role players on short contracts to help them go from good to great.   Let me know what you think.      pg - Mo Williams   sg - Delonte West   sf - Lebron James   pf - Ben Wallace   c - Zydrunas Ilgauskas      pg - Daniel Gibson   sg - Raja Bell - 5 million    sf - Matt Barnes - 1.2 million   pf - Anderson Verajao   c - Marcus Camby - 7.6 million      they may have to trade for Bell being that he is under contract until 2010 and im not sure his contract is player or team negotiable after this season. But i really like Bell, and he would be a perfect fit for Cleveland, he can hit the outside shot and he plays defense.

A friend of mines is really stressed out about this. He is a junior in high school and he is 5"11. He is East Indian (India) and he believes that his race may prevent him from playing football. My friend has a passion for football but the thing is that he lives in a town down South where he has to go to a school (magnet school) which does not have any sports at all. All of the schools around the area that offer sports are full of gangs and hicks (who would of course beat him up for being Indian).       My friend has taken the SAT and received a 2040 on it out of 2400. He has good grades. He is now worried about the football and he wanted me to ask for some help. This summer he is looking for some football camps (there are none in the area he lives in).      He desperately wants to be Quarterback and here is what he has to offer      40 yd dash time = 4.8   He can throw 57 yds at most   He has good grades and is intelligent.

20090222233253AAeoV0b	Sports;Wrestling	What are some of the things you DONT LIKE about Ric Flair?	Everyone goes on and on about how they love him and his great matches and how he's the greatest of all time. I'm in the mood to hear some NEGATIVE things about Flair, things that you don't like about him. I have a few right off the top of my head, and feel free to dispute my list if you want, but have valid reasons:      1) The 'Flair Flop'. I've ALWAYS hated this spot. It's as phoney as the Canadian Destroyer. I saw Piper slap Flair one time, and then he did this spot. It looked awful. When someone slaps you, I'm sorry, but you dont fall down belly first. Hell, generally dont fall down at all.      2) The way he trashed Mick Foley in his book. Mick is a good, hardworking, genuinely nice guy, who put his body on the line for the fans entertainment and often raised the bar for OUR entertainment. Flair writes Foley off as a glorified stuntman who couldn't draw a dime if he didn't do his hardcore spots.      3) He says Bret Hart was repetitive. Oh please. Like Flair wasnt. Chop here. Chop there. Chop everywhere. Upsidedown backflip in the corner, runs to the other side of the ring, gets bealed off by the babyface. EVERY top star has there few signature moves, but I think Flair was a guy who abused this, and Bret at least would sometimes throw in twists and turns WHILE doing his signature moves.      4) The fact hes quite rude as a panelist on the 'Legends of Wrestling Roundtable' on WWE 24/7 if you've ever seen it. He comes across as a bitter old man putting down WCW to the 10th degree and writing off Scott Hall as an untalented performer. He pisses and moans about how he was put in crappy angles, yet he went through with them. Someone with his star power ALWAYS had the ability to say 'No, I'm not going to do this'. Just because he didnt feel he was treated with respect in WCW, he trashes the promotion as a WHOLE, when WCW at times was a GREAT promotion that I was throughly entertained by.      These are just a few reasons of what I dont like about the guy. Lets hear yours.

Sub-.500: ('89 Dodgers, '91 Reds, '98 Marlins, '07 Cardinals)      Above-.500 ('96 Braves, '02 Diamondbacks, '04 Marlins)         Here's a list of 8 critical patterns they'd have to beat defy expectations:      1) Be the 1st NL team since 1975-1976 to win consecutive WS titles (Reds.      2) Be the 1st NL team since to win more than one World Series who's won at least one division title since 1983 (ironically, a year the Phillies loss the WS).      3) Be the 1st NL team since 1995-1996 to be in back-to-back World Series (Braves).      4) Be 1st Defending NL Pennant winner in 4 years to make postseason in following season.       5) Be the 1st NL team to make it passed NLDS in consecutive years since 2005-06 (Cardinals).      6) Be the 1st NL team to win make the postseason 3 years in a row since 2004-06 (Cardinals).      7) Not end up sub-.500, like 4 of 7 previous NL World Series (57%) and end up in postseason, which 5 of 7 haven't been able to do ('96 Braves, '02 D'Backs are only teams).      8) Not make John Kruk look stupid (that's not easy). Kruk said they'd win back-to-back World Series. He's an ex-Phillie who ended his Phillies stint with a bad taste (gave up people like Torre and now regrets it). He's the only reporter who predicted this on baseball tonight.

20090222235402AAIh9pb	Sports;Outdoor Recreation;Hunting	Is it safe to fire a muzzle-loader thats been stored for 2 months?	I have a muzzle-loader which I loaded new out of the box 2 months ago. I poured in the powder, and then shoved the bullet in. Since then, it has been stored in a garage, and exposed to warm, humid temperatures (about 75-80o) as well as about 20-30of.    I have not primed it yet - but was wondering if its safe to fire after priming. If not, how can I make sure it will fire properly. Is there a way to 'empty' it safely? I would rather not 'fire' out the bad shot, as I am afraid it could blow up in my hand or something.       Any advice or suggestions would be greatly apprecaited!!

But anyway, in the movie he is in a boat standing and shoots 3 men with a .22 bolt actions rifle from 200 meters away with a popbottle suppressor! i know a pop bottle can muffle the sound of a shot some but thats not my question.   i know 200 meters is a fair distance for a .22, but is it nessisarily lethal from that far?   wont it loose a lot of energy in the flight path?   This isnt one of those, "What can a bullet do to a person" questions.   Im just curious if it can be lethal or not. the movie got me wondering.   Any enlightenment?   Thanks    Ghost

20070326015914AAlUNaD	Sports;Football (Soccer);Mexican Football (Soccer)	Soy Mexicano y se que Argentina es superior a nosotros en historia y jugadores. Porque  no  ver  la  realidad?	Soy Mexicano, y me encanta el fútbol. Los Mexicanos sabemos que Argentina como selección, sus equipos y sus jugadores son superiores a nosotros en materia de fútbol, que han ganado un sin fin de copas a la pureba está que Boca pasó a ser el equipo con más trofeos a nivel internacional, algo realmente inalcanzable para el mediocre nivel de fútbol que han demostrado nuestro TRI y nuestros equipos. Esto es sin duda una autocrítica, ya que muchos de mis compatriotas confunden dinero con fútbol y prestigio y esto no es así, es verdad que pagamos muy bien, pero es incomparable a la cantidad de copas ganadas por equipos Argentinos, y aunque nos duela, hemos ganado partidos, hemos hecho fuerza en otros, pero no ganamos campeonatos internacionales de peso y perdemos en definiciones importantes. Desde el 93 jugamos la copa América y a posteriori la Libertadores y seguimos SIN GANAR NADA. COMPATRIOTAS REFLEXIONEMOS POR EL BIEN DE MEXICO, ESTAMOS INFLADOS

20070706142224AAm0k9M	Sports;Basketball	Latest on KG sweepstake: you can rule out Phx because they are not going to move Amare ...?	Chicago is not interested in mortgaging their young players to acquire 32 yr old superstar so the Lakers are still very much interested in pursueing KG to say the least. I have communicated with Laker team reporter who covers the team on a full time basis and travels with the team saying that the Lakers want KG so bad that they have basically left all the Laker players on the table for Kevin McHale to choose from, put together a package in exchange for KG, except Kobe.  McHale is holding out as long as he can because McHale still believes that he can get a better deal with other team in return for KG, with that in mind GS is still looking to trade multiple players to get KG and at the same time the Dallas Mavericks are in serious discussion possibily sending Devin Harris, Jason Terry and Josh Howard to Minnesota for KG. As soon as KG is moved out of Minnesota, Lakers will then concentrate on Jermaine O'Neil. Any thoughts on this Laker fans?

20070516154615AARMDKx	Sports;Basketball	If boris diaw has never gotten a technical in 4 years in NBA, isn't that enough to give him benefit of doubt?	4 years in the league, not one technical.  Guy says he has never been in a fight in his life.  Look at the guy, he seems like one of the nicest guys in the NBA.  D'Antoni claims there is no way boris would ever fight.       Isn't this enough to give him the benefit of the doubt about his intent? When he left the bench raja hadn't even rushed robert horry.  He was going to check on nash, our leader that the players absolutely adore and would take a bullet for.      The joke of this is that he left the bench before the altercation. Its gross to think that if james jones punched elson when elson stood up, bowen and duncan would be suspended because of the altercation.  Nice rule NBA, all anyone has to do is look to foul a leader of a team flagrantly, and if anyone moves a few feet onto the court, punch someone in the face.  Seems like a solid rule.
