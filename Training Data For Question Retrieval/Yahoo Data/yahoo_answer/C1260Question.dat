Astronomy can only look back to when the universe was 380,000 years old and about 3000K because:   a. at the Big Bang the universe was too hot and dense for electromagnetic radiation to survive.   b. the temperature of the cosmic microwave background radiation was too smooth (isotropic)   c. the universe was full of ionized gas that was not yet transparent to light   d. when the strong force separated from the other forces, inflation caused space to increase in size rapidly.   e. photons were not produced until the era of recombination.      Also, I'm just curious, is it impossible to see beyond the cosmic light horizon because any light from beyond the horizon has not had time to travel all the way to us?      Thank yooou.

20090226222338AAulGbc	Science & Mathematics;Other - Science	Ok i need help with my science work!!?	When a scientist asks a question, the search for the answer to that question leads to a hypothesis. To test that hypothesis, a scientist will design an experiment. When designing an experiment you need to consider the following.   ? The variable being tested   ?The variable being recorded,   ?Other variables that need to be the same all the time during the experiment.      A scientist wants to determine if the time it takes a certain amount of salt to dissolve changes with a change in temperature. The experiment is set with two test tubes half full of 25 degreesC water.   Answer the following questions regarding the variables in this experiment.   1. What are the variables being tested? _____________   2. Which variable is easier to change? This will be the independent variable.___________   3. Which variable will be the independent variable? _________   4. List the other variables you need to consider. The list is started for you---name four additional variables.   ? Size of the test tube ?____________________   ?Amount of water ?____________________   ?____________________ ?____________________   INSTRUCTIONS~~   Place the steps of the experiment in order. Write 1 in the blank next to the step that comes first,2 in the space next to the step that comes second, and so on. 5.___ Add 10g of salt to the water in each test tube. Do not shake the tubes. 6.___ As you add the salt, start a timer. Record the time it takes all of the salt to dissolve in the water. 7.___ Empty the test tubes. Completely clean and dry the tubes.

En effet, comme tous les mamiferes (il me semble), les males ont des tétons. Ceci prouve que soit l'homme est une modification des femmes soit l'inverse. Bref, les tétons de l'homme sont ils les vestiges de seins disparus au cours de l'évolution?    Si oui, cela suppose que les mammiferes ont pour origine une espèce unique, qui était asexuée, comme certaines especes dont un seul individu est autofécondable (grenouilles je crois).     De meme, si cela était vrai pourquoi l'évolution aurait elle conservée ce caractère devenu inutile (peut etre pour le c?té  érogène...)     Ceci ne modifierait il pas la théorie de l'evolution de notre ami darwin?   voilà, c tout!! (dois aussi mettre cette question dans la reubrique biologie?)   à bient?t et un grand merci!!

20080401034858AAd4n4m	Science & Mathematics;Mathematics	Challenging Math problems Part 3?	7. Consider an infinite chessboard, with numbers in each square. Initially all of the numbers are 0, except for a single 1 on a black square. Go through a series of steps: at every step, replace each number with the sum of its four neighbors (all numbers get replaced simultaneously).       After n steps, what is the sum of all the numbers on the board? What number is in the position of the original 1?    Give as precise a description as you can of the arrangement of numbers on the board after n steps. (Even if you know the answer, you may find it hard to state clearly. Do your best: this is part of the challenge of the problem.)       8. Amy, Brian, and CoScott are playing a game, with Dana as the judge. Dana puts eight stickers (four red and four blue) in a bowl, then draws two at random for each player and sticks them to their foreheads. Each player can see both of the other players' stickers, but not his or her own or the two left in the bowl. Dana then asks Amy whether she knows the colors of her stickers. If Amy does not, Dana asks Brian whether he knows his colors, then CoScott, then Amy again, then Brian again, and so on. The game ends if one of the players can logically deduce his or her colors. What is the probability that the game ends on one of Amy's turns? Brian's? CoScott's? What is the probability that it never ends at all?

Gravity takes over with superdense suns and they can end up imploding inwards creating black holes.The forces in these suns must be astronomically minute compared to what was in that initial big bang state. So how could this big bang exist never mind expand with that amount of gravity crushing it?   It obviously did...so am I missing something blatantly obvious

20070116171502AAGeS8H	Science & Mathematics;Mathematics	Math question? anyone willing to try?	You invest $200. After on year, the total of the investment is $208.80. Solve the formula A=P+Prt where A is the total of the investment, P is the principal (amount invested), r is the annuall simple interest rate, and t is the time in years, for r. Find the annual simple interest rate. How much money would your investment have if you leave it in for another two years with the same interest rate? Explain your answer.
20070218164138AAim9Hm	Science & Mathematics;Mathematics	Math issues???	1. The Partrick County 4-H club has $300 to spend on tress for the clubs orchard. the club votes to plant both apple tress and pear tress. If pear tress cost $30 each and apple trees cost $20 each, the cost can modeled by the equation 20x+30y=300, where x is the number of apple trees and y is the number of pear trees. Write this equation in slope intercept form and interpret the meaning of the slope.   2. determine whether the lines are parallel, perpendicular, or neither. explain.   y-x=-10     and     y-4=x+5   3. Which of the following equations represents a line l that goes through (2,1) and has slope -3? Is the answer: y=-3x+3?   4. Find the sum of two numbers is 36 and their difference is 10. Find the numbers?   5. Describe a system of a linear equalitites for which there are many solutions?   6. The diagonal of a square measures 10 inches. What is the legnght of the sides?
