0e9ed4ee6c6cda74865fe8549561650aaa	I don't know how old or young you are, so take my suggestions with a grain of salt.  I'll try to be generic.  My husband and I went to Bogota, Columbia this past year so we've got some firsthand experience.     Bring capris, tank tops, light summer skirts and a summer dress or two.  Shorts are ok, but you'll look like more like a tourist.  If you're staying at a resort, you're fine wearing shorts and t-shirts, but you may want to 'class up' when you're going somewhere, especially during the carnival.  Nice sandals (with a heel) are great, but no flip flops or tennis shoes, really, unless you're 'touristing'.       Funny sidenote: most of the locals (under about 40 or so) are dressed incredibly scantily...I don't know your personal preference - you may be fine dressing like that too, but it's pretty easy to tell the tourists from the regulars.  You'll see lots of women who really shouldn't be wearing what they're wearing with the bodies they've got, but it's the culture down there.      For your husband, nice shorts or khakis and a polo/button up shirt are probably going to be the standard.  Men have a much easier time of it, don't they!!!???  :)      Enjoy your trip!  Hope this helps.

51899793bc12412f537da4caf7e6d3bfaa	A bikini wax is a method of removing pubic hair to, obstensibly, create a cleaner hair line when wearing a swimsuit.  It entails a professional esthetician applying heated specialty wax to the area, applying pellon or muslin over the wax, and removing the hair by tugging the strip of pellon or musin against the hair growth, removing the hair by the root.  It is uncomfortable but the hair generally takes 3-4 weeks to grow back.  By the way, in order to assure a good wax, hair must be at least 1/4" long.  If hair is too long, the esthetician may elect to trim or clip the hair.  If you are planning a bikini wax to use with a bikini, have the process performed at least a week before you plan to "expose" the area, as many people experience prolonged redness, and red pimply type bumps for several days post-wax.  If you are using Retin-A, Differin or any other type of oral acne medication, do NOT have a bikini wax - or any other type of waxing service - as you skin will be too thin and is not conducive to waxing services.|`|0bd75c85ad128e3c1dec52c93f960215aa	SOMETHING SOOOO PAINFUL......NEVER GET IT DONE..WHATEVER THEY TELL YOU.|`|7faac35574bae471c2e62a67fd0c857faa	It is when they wax the exposed pubic hair once you have put in your Bikini.|`|AA11468975	what is it? it's PAINFUL!|`|1EX9pIyIaa	a bikini wax is removing hair from the pubic region, mainly to have the bikini line neat and fuzz free.  warm wax adheres to hair and once it cools a bit, the strip of wax is quickly removed on the opposite direction of hair growth, removing hair from its roots.

GL hun|`|dwvj9fKEaa	Have you tried using one of the new hybrid products, specifically designed for use between "shampoo days", such as the routine you described?    These relatively new products, called Cleansing Conditioners might be the answer  you're looking for.  They do not contain detergents or sudsing /foaming agents. You could think of them as cleansing cream or lotion for the scalp and hair, similiar in function to those used on the face.     Soap can have the same drying effect on facial skin that daily shampoo use may produce on dry or chemically treated hair types.      Here is a description of the type of product  you should find, sold at professional beauty supply stores, nationwide:    Cleansing Conditioner cleanses the hair & scalp without any detergents or sodium laurel sulfate, therefore not stripping the scalp or hair of its natural oils.      Cleansing Conditioner can be used as often as necessary. Due to its rich dense nature it is formulated to strengthen & rehydrate the hair. This product is a universal cleanser, but due to its moisturizing properties it performs amazingly well on dry, heat-damaged, color-treated, medium to coarse, wavy to curly and ethnic hair.    Directions for use:Rinse hair thoroughly.   Apply 20-30 pumps -- more for longer and thicker hair -- (10 in the crown, 10 at the nape) of Cleansing Conditioner to your palms and rub together. Apply to your scalp first, massaging vigorously for 1-3 minutes.   Add a splash of water; this will create a creamy consistency to work through the hair. This product has no detergents or sodium laurel sulfate, so it will not lather.      Add 10-15 pumps of Cleansing Conditioner through the ends of the hair.  Comb Cleansing Conditioner through hair, and leave on at least 3-5 minutes -- the longer the better for maximum conditioning.   Rinse thoroughly for 1-2 minutes, massaging scalp and running fingers through to the ends.   Repeat if necessary.    I would love to know about your experience with this product, if you decide to try it!  I am quite curious as to the results on different hair types.  Good luck, and I hope this helps!  Good hair days are the best!  We deserve to have as many of them as we can...
Us6FBBQYaa	You're not too young, and as long as your school has no rules against it, I'd say it's ok. I started in 5th grade at like 10. Ask your mom if it would be ok to use one thing at a time, until she feels it's ok for you to use it. Like, start off with lip gloss and maybe a little shadow, liner, or mascara, then work your way up to a full face. Go somewhere where you can learn to apply it properly, and not look like a clown, such as a M.A.C. make-up counter. Could be that your mom doesn't want you growing up too fast, but I think at 12, it's time for you to start practicing and gaining some make-up experience!|`|AA11301969	Well, it depends on your reasons for wanting to wear the makeup and her overall personality.     Are you wearing it to be like other people at school? Are you wearing it because of celebrities? Are you wanting to wear it because your skin needs an extra glow?    The most important things abour wearing makeup at your age is 1) taking care of your skin so you don't end up looking 40 when you are 20 and 2) making your makeup look natural so that you don't look like you're playing dress up or something.    Talk to your mother about why you want to wear makeup. Ask her if there is some sort of middle ground you can both agree on such as you can wear colored lip gloss and powder to start. Maybe the two of you can go to a makeup counter somwhere to learn how to make your makeup look really natural and minimal.

Skip makeup till you hit college, it doesn't make you look you pretty but it sure does add on the extra unwanted expense.|`|96cb6714e1d667e51acb06f072df9f67aa	I think you should ask her if you can wear a tinted moisteriser to school because it is very suttle but still gives you a glow!!!|`|9D6muecCaa	I think you should wait til your 13, cause then your a teenager.|`|f7b94bc8f45e778855c0c809630aff1caa	persuade your mom to let you only wear neutral, pretty looking make up that's not too heavy, like a little eye shadow and some cover up and lip gloss. lay low n the eyeliner, and don't wear midnight or black liquid colors. wear pencil browns and charcoal Greys. they look great!!! as for your age- as long as you don't wear heavy, nasty clown make-up, try some if you feel your ready.|`|X5nG0siNaa	I ACTUALLY STARTED WEARING MAKEUP AROUND THAT SAME AGE AND MOM FLIPPED.

RNskuDzBaa	Two words: Hell. Yeah. As a young(ish) mom, I know it's not politically correct, but I think tattoos, Bettie Paige bangs, and pencil skirts work right into my wardrobe. Along with my Crocs and khakis, there are things I like I just don't think should be excluded from everyday dressing. Have fun with it!

gDlp4hBhaa	take accutane ma if u got serious acne. trust me it help like no other. 100% clear for good in a few months|`|CurMR0ZGaa	I find that almost every person in my family used ProActiv. Every single one had skin that went from broken out, to broken out, dry, and irritated. Don't use ProActiv. It's a waste of time. Instead, use sonething natural. I would really recommend Burt's Bees. burtsbees.com. Most of their products are 100% natural. They are gentle on the skin, and using the right products will clear acne in a matter of days. Check out the website, write down the products that you think will work for you, look up which stores carry those products, and try them out. Burt's Bees products are a bit expensive, but let me tell you, every product is worth every penny. I haven't been dissatisfied with any of their products, and I've used almost all of them. My whole face was broken out for what felt like forever. I don't have a single blemish anymore. It also worked for my family and friends!! Good luck!|`|bdaaf7db7ead880f0214eeaac30951fbaa	Just wash your face with a cleanser that works for your skin every day and every night. You might need a dermatologist. Too much grease on your face can cause breakouts too because it clogs your pores. If your face feels dry, use a good moisturizer.|`|tS45PaQMaa	ProActiv...it always works for me!|`|aqJX3hhraa	Wash your skin every night especialy if you wear makeup because say you don't wash it once you get home and go to bed your skin will absorb the powder, dirt, oil that has accumulated on your face during the day in the mornings just rince you face with water unless Its hot for some reason and your skin is oily wash your face but very gently because you dont want to overwash your face either.    Drink water Its been said so many times and really does work wonders it has to be done consistently and not drinking water 2 days and stop because you cant see results .

AA11751757	i didn't have any luck with it. i am now using dermologica and it works better
154dzJ1Faa	Yes.  Many salons offer this service.  Ask around, or look in the phone book.  They input a pic of you with your hair pulled back, and then put on different styles, and colours, to see what would look good.  It's very slick and fun!  You might have to look in another town, if there aren't any in yours.    Also, talk to a qualified hair colourist about this.  There may be other factors about the condition of your hair that may recommend not doing it.  They are best to know how best to get the colour you want.

BFRPPsLoaa	No te preocupes, lo del plomo es cierto, pero no slo los labiales lo tienen, tambin la cermica y cristaleria, como la taza y el vaso en dnde tomas caf y agua, respectivamente, algunos dulces, estos productos y muchos ms, contienen plomo en cantidades permitidas por las autoridades correspondientes, aunque en el caso de los labiales, el plomo se genera de manera natural, no es artificial y la FDA no tiene establecida alguna cantidad especfica como permitida.

If you have wide feet I'm assuming your legs are quite built. There's a type of shoes that are high (not heels) like platforms and they tie half way up the leg. If you ever see these types TRY THEM. These shoes not only look sexy but they cut down how big your feet and calves look.  Just a suggestion, good luck!|`|AA12256418	I have that prob too! I just don't wear heels. I cannot find any!

uav4gxqwaa	Lightening hair is permanent.  Only go blond if you're willing to keep it up.  It grows out fast.  I'd recommend getting highlights first to see if you like it.  You can add more highlights gradually and it'll look more natural.|`|AA11873699	I you sure your not already blonde? I hardly could read your spelling!!!|`|AXcToLZhaa	cutie pie is rude!! and no the roots will show.|`|HQKYXXOHaa	I don't think so...Bleach is super hard on hair, and your roots growing in will just be too noticeable.

eFSQ1F0Raa	you will ahve to have your roots touched up if you dont want them to show much about every month  the dye shouldnt bother your hair much... it might make it a lil dry but as long as you use a good mousturizing conditio9ner you should be fine and when you do your root dye jobs only do the new roots.. dont do the whole head of hair again  bleach on the other hand ruins your hair  after about 3 or 4 bleachings (sometimes before) you will notice your hair thinner and break easily  and no you cant take it out  the dye - if it is black you could try dying it lighter but because it is the darkest... it is very likely it wont work  the bleach- no youd have to dye your hair darker dye adds color to your hair whereas bleach actually stripps the color right from your hair|`|AA10462593	no you can't remove it..yes you need to keep doing it and 3rd it makes you look too hard or harsh..no one is born with black hair and bleached bangs..All hair has multiple colors..the only way to get rid of it completely is hair cuts and then you have the root growth until it grows out.|`|AA11769963	I pretty much agree with the first answer.  If you tint (dye) your hair, you will have to touch up the roots every 4-6 weeks.  Usually, you'd put the color on the roots for about 20 minutes, then put color on the ends after that for about 5 minutes to freshen up the color (it will fade a little over time).  Bleaching is more complicated and is much harder on your hair.  With the bleaching, you would just touch up the roots.  Depending on your natural color, the time you process the bleach may vary.  If you have dark hair, it will take longer to process.  If you don't process it long enough, you will end up with orange, not blonde hair.  You also need to take into account your ethnicity.  There are different methods used for ethnic hair.  If you decide to go with the black tint, by personal experience, it is very difficult to get out of the hair if you change your mind.  When I  was in college, I dyed my hair black, (from a natural dark blonde) then got tired of it.  My mother, who's been a hairdresser for 35 years first tried to use bleach to get it out.  Then, she used a professional dye-solvent, because the bleach didn't completely work.  After that, she had to re-tint or dye my hair a more natural color, because it still wasn't right after the dye solvent.      My advice:  If you have dark hair, beware bleaching the front unless you have a professional that has the right products.  Bleach is hard on the hair.  If you decide to go black, be sure you want to keep it for a while.  It's tough to go a lighter color again.  It might look cool for a while, but make sure its what you want, and not just what your sister wants.  I love experimenting with hair color.  I haven't seen my natural color in over 10 years.  I've been experimenting with various shades of red lately, which are a problem all their own.  You can always try to recolor it, and if that doesn't work, cut it.  It will always grow back, and then you can try something else.|`|lKMfJvaSaa	my tips is don't go for hair bleach, it spoils your hair growth , just go for hair colour with good quality product.     and also for hair care and skin care just in

3KQpFHEBaa	I understand you are really looking for answers, however I have to say that I love your hair colour the way it is.  If anything just get a few platinum blond streaks through the crown.|`|AA11116264	hmm, well, i bet a bright teal or aqua would look awesome.|`|HCm8ekItaa	y try 2 hide ur face? keyword "try" cuz we can still c it ne way.......that's weird.........bright  orange|`|HSqoRQTuaa	I would get green, purple, or blue tips of the hair. Maybe a blue streak on either side would be good. I really like your purple hair, too. Im thinking of dieing my hair also, and Im ganna get a lime green streak and a black one right next to eachother on one side. It would also be cool to have blue fade into indigo, or green fade into blue as it is going down.|`|6G9RIDfwaa	don't do purple it will be too dark  pink would look best but I guess you could do aqua that would be nice to|`|j5IZseJCaa	blue or pink|`|zwQK2umLaa	Add some highlights girl.|`|bqyiDngcaa	you're hair is gorgeous   i'd get pink highlights but only the two front strips in the front ;D

AA10788734	try using biosilk on your hair when you get out of the shower. I have been using BioSilk Silk Therapy for years, and my only hope is that this product is never discontinued. If I ever hear of that happening, I will have to hoard as much of it as I can find, as my hair will truly suffer without it.    What Is It?    BioSilk Silk Therapy is a colorless liquid, thick like syrup, with a slightly oily feel to it. It is designed to add moisture to hair or skin. The ingredients on the bottle are indecipherable to me - a whole bunch of long chemical names, but according to the website, the product contains concentrated silk, fortified with botanicals and Vitamin E, with added sunscreen. It has a slightly perfumed scent to it. Nothing heavy, or fruity, just a light, pleasant smell. The ingredients list "parfum" as the fragrance - admittedly not too helpful, if one is allergic to certain fragrances.    How Do I Apply It?    This product can be used on wet hair or dry hair. I use it every single time I wash my hair, after towel-drying. To apply, I pour approximately a dime-sized dollop into my hand. Most people, I think, would want to use less. I rub the product between my hands, then rub my hands through my hair. I make certain to get underneath, and to especially coat the ends. I try very hard not to get too much in any one spot, as that spot will appear visibly oily if I do so. When I use it on wet hair, my hands are completely free of the product after application. When used on dry hair, I end up with excess. That's when I take advantage of the fact that the product is also designed for skincare, and rub the excess on my dry elbows. Since the product is oily, if I want to wash the excess off my hands, plain water won't really do it. It takes a drop of soap.    The Results    Thanks to this product, my hair is less frizzy, feels softer and smoother, and smells nice. It has a nice shine to it. It does not look greasy, nor does it feel greasy (as long as I don't make the mistake of getting too much product in any one spot). I can easily slip a comb through my hair, and my fingers no longer get "stuck in a rat's nest".I'm truly thrilled with the results from this product.|`|mqlzkJ54aa	Most of the time hair gets frizzy because it's dry or damaged.|`|2D8y8Fohaa	As we get older the texture of hair changes. Plus if you dry your hair alot without using a product it gets very dead and im guessing since you have curly hair you use a straightner which damages hair alot! Try using a heat protector when drying your hair like ( Redken heat glide) it protects hair from heat. And make sure you always use a protecten when and if you straighten your hair!:) Good luck|`|SjnSeoq2aa	Did you start to color or bleach your hair?  If so this may be why....|`|9x1nnlVxaa	Try using lots of conditioner after shampooing and a leave-in conditioner will help too and perhaps now again, a trip to the salon for a deep-conditioning treatment. Also cut back on your hair's exposure to the heat and the amount of hair products you use.|`|hztGUgN1aa	Beat an egg in a cup of milk.When it foams, rub it into the scalp.Leave it on for 5 minutes. Rinse the hair thoroughly with water.Carry out this routine twice a week for excellent results for dry damaged hair. Check out  http://solutionsfordryhair.blogspot.com/ for more info.|`|liOTJH8Laa	i put lotion on my hands and run my fingers through my hair it works|`|jsIFZrf2aa	Firstly, if you have curly or frizzy hair... DON'T BRUSH IT, it will make it worse!  Instead, rub some serum into your hands and rub your fingers through it to detangle it...    Invest in a good quality shampoo and conditioner as well as treatments, if you can afford it... you are better off buying from a salon rather then cheap supermarket rubbish...    Try and use products that will hydrate your hair...

JOKcfwppaa	Most people put on their lotion immediately before tanning, in fact, most manufactures suggest it.    If I were you, and if I had the time, I would shower after working out and apply your lotion at the salon. If you don't have time, I'd skip the shower, but still apply the lotion right before you tan.     If you put it on before exercising you'll likely sweat most of it off and if you are using a bronzer you'll likely end up streaking.|`|GYTDAOdTaa	Most tanning beds have a private room or changing area attatched or next to the bed, and they give you about 10 minutes to get ready, during that time you are supposed to get undressed and put on your lotion. If you are soaked in sweat from the gym I would dry off a little beforehand.|`|SEB3Jr5uaa	toafter you work out .. you might sweat it off .. and it might be better shower before|`|pbVTmnYjaa	Always put it on directly before tanning. Otherwise it can sweat off, streak, or rub off on clothing|`|NhCHmOfMaa	shower and then put the lotion on. I think tanning lotion is best right before you get in it.

En el caso de ella, ella era alrgica a los detergentes y eso haca que su piel fuese muy delicada que con casi nada comenzaba a sangrar fcilmente.    Lo que te puedo recomendar es: PRIMERO, ir a donde un Dermatlogo y le planteas esto mismo que nos ests diciendo a nosotros y, SEGUNDO, cuando yo tengo heridas y quemaduras o rasgu?os en la piel, sea dnde sea, yo me aplico sobre la piel baba del cristal de zbila, es un anti-inflamatorio y cicatrizante.    De la mata de zbila (aloe vera), le cortas una penca u hoja que ella tiene, la dejas en un lugar donde nadie la toque y la dejas ah a que ella sangre (para que bote todo el lquido amarillo y hediondo que ella tiene) al da siguiente, tomas la penca de zbila y con un cuchillo de plstico (que no sea de metal) le quitas la cscara verde a la hoja. Adentro encontrars el cristal de zbila, es semiduro y transparente y tiene una baba pegajosa igualmente transparente.     sta baba es la que te vas a aplicar sobre la parte afectada de tu piel y la dejas secar, se te forma como una escamas de baba de zbila en la piel, ??Es normal!!.    sta baba sirve para ayudarla a cicatrizar y desinflamar, PERO NO DEJES DE IR AL DERMATLOGO, l te puede recetar otros medicamentos que pueden ayudarte.    ?Saludos y suerte!.      ...

CmBLtpEqaa	i have a cowlick, one on each side of my head. get front bangs, or semi front bangs, and when you brush them, brush them upward to kinda fluff them over the cowlick, then you can straighten them in stuff. it'll take about a week to train your cowlick, but its much worth it. :]    edit: front bangs as in french bangs.  like straight across your head.  yes it works. :]|`|AA12118274	I have the same.

I recommend letting it be natural for a few days, get a deep conditioner and let it air dry without straightening or blow drying. But I really don't see anything wring with it.

The tannin in tea bags has been shown to reduce swelling and discoloration, and cucumber slices have long been used to reduce puffiness and refresh the appearance of skin around the eyes. Lie down, preferably in the morning, and leave fresh cucumber slices or cool, damp caffeinated tea bags (you can refrigerate them overnight so theyll be ready) over your eyes for about 10-15 minutes.

43ZsGHwsaa	It varies from person to person. It didn't make me break out at all, but I've heard it does  for others before it gets better. Don't give up on it until you've used it for a few months, it sometimes takes time to work, but it does!|`|9wSjCIsTaa	i used Proactive for 6 months day & night & i messed up my skin like no other!  i use to just have 1 or 2 bumps but it really brought the acne out & now I just found something to tame it haha.

I still use it now whenever i have a break out.. It is awesome stuff...|`|nR9CYaHHaa	It is normal to break out more when first starting to use it.    I used to use proactiv but it wasnt strong enough.    The dermatologist said that with the perscribed product, things would get worst but then better. it took 6 weeks to get better but my skin is clear now using Ziana|`|sXSgijXnaa	Well, sometimes someones skin is rather oily or dry.

9f8f7d03ac16ef9e4130e46479df10daaa	Hang it outside in the shade and protected from bird droppings, vandals, sunlight, and rain (if it doesn't snow where you live). If 2 or 3 days doesn't do it, then you can dry clean it yourself in your mom's clothes dryer. They sell home dry cleaning kits in the grocery stores and probably at Wal-Mart. Follow the package directions and it should get the smell out. There is always Frebreeze spray too, if you want to "mask" the smell. But if the dress is velvet or expensive, you may want to just spring for a professional job at a reputable cleaners. Another option that might work would be to hang it in a small bathroom and burn a few sticks of good quality incense - something you really like the smell of because it will leave the incense smell on the dress.|`|2409abf61c12d04404f01653f0bff9caaa	You can try to buy the Dryel starter kit, which is an at-home dry cleaner.

IKCfT9tnaa	don't do it till you've been everywhere you want to go...your list may change!|`|AA10254768	The amount for a tattoo depends on the artist you go to. Your best option would be to look into different artists/studios in your area and contact them to get a quote. Remember- you get what you pay for so go with a quality artist   = ) |`|W30MOowuaa	It's going to depend on the shop you go to, and the size of your tattoo. A 3 inch tattoo could run between 45 to 65 bucks give or take some. |`|votsoxeGaa	Too much. =(|`|0mhcCyE5aa	I do not know - btw what are your three fav places?|`|cjIugf4yaa	Well, my tattoo which is about one inch by 3 inches cost 80 dollars. She said normally she would of charged about 115 dollars for the size, etc...but, I was in a group so she gave us a discount. |`|fP3zJK66aa	When I got mine done they charged by the hour.  I think it took about 45 mins to get mine done and she charged about $90 an hour.  Think the best tattooist in that shop was charging around $125 an hour.  So depending on how good the artist is, its gonna cost you differents amounts.

This will not dry your hands like acetones or nail polish removers will do.    Baby oil. That's right. Baby oil. If you do not have that, try cooking oil.    Works for me.

WHY? With a bigger bust, no matter what, you can't hide it, its gonna be sexy still. Smaller bust, you would want to show a little more. And its also sexy. :D

f1bdd8f3dd409cdd71223c7d68e40664aa	The best way to handle it would be with a dry shampoo.  You can purchase them at Sally's. You  powder your scalp with the dry shampoo, it absorbs excess oils and then it's simply brushed out. They were once reserved for people in hospitals or bed bound but many professional lines now carry a dry shampoo as well because they're becoming so much more mainstream.   It is along the same lines of the "baby powder" concept but the baby powder can leave a white residue where the dry shampoo will not.|`|72hMibsVaa	get a good hair dryer, get up an extra 30 minutes early, take a shower, wash your hair, and blow dry it.     |`|NlaVawVhaa	There is a new product by KMS called makeover spray, sold by professional stylists. Biolage also makes a wet spray for oily scalp called cool mint , you could use it the night before when you wash your hair. My daughter has the same trouble, even when she washes her hair in the morning it is oily by noon. Hope this helps you.|`|JlNKUH5Taa	sprinkle a little bit of cornstarch or baking soda into it (over the sink or bathtub), rub it in and then brush it out completely and shake your head to make sure it is all removed. Corn starch absorbs the oil and baking soda cuts it. Try washing your hair with shampoo only every few days for a couple weeks until your scalp regulates its oil production. Some people can get oily hair from washing away all their own natural oil too often. Mild shampoos with tea tree oil can help also.|`|KJqXNBDhaa	put a small bit of babypowder on your roots and brush it on. To cover up the smell of baby powder, you can either put a small amout of purfume, or some of that hair scent stuff (you can get it at a beauty store).  If its still a litle oily , put your hair in a very tight ponytail (that way it doesnt look oily). Try washing your hair less often and use a milder shampoo, because most shampoos and washing your hair too much strips your hair of its natural oils, unco ering the gross texture. The best mild shampoo is Kiel's, or Burnts Bees shampoo. Try using less conditioner (or no conditioner) or organic shampoo. you can also try dry shampoo, but babypowder works best.|`|fd950f791be3fe3e715dd5b3ac689d92aa	no u must take a shower|`|9d191EOVaa	get baby powder or parfume powder and brush a bit of it in quikly but not to much.|`|tWlcrlOdaa	there's no way to avoid washing it. unless your have some sort of hair condition. |`|7kHDbiWaaa	i agree with whoever said to try dry shampoo.      also, you should try one of those clarifying shampoos when you DO shower to get the oil out.  neutrogena brand works best, ive found.      it might be your conditioner that makes your hair oily.  try switching brands, or skippping it (once).|`|N1pQEcS4aa	A little bit of baby powder or the rock star stuff from bedhead......that stuff rocks....also KMS has this stuff called beach hair..spray it in there and voila....the oil is gone......I swear by it|`|4sW8MFxCaa	babypowder.babypowder.babypowder.
lkDouqK2aa	you can have them done in a lot of beauty salons in chesterfield so i would imagine the same for sheff, ring round a few
oJzMMRO3aa	Yes, you can get a perm with big curls.. They call it a body wave ( I think) The use larger curlers ( obviously). The perm  would be really cool if you have really fine hair. It will add much body to it and look 300% fuller .. especially if you use a product that will keep it uplifted and frizz free all day and that is possible. I would try it if I were you.. : )|`|h9xSKgiJaa	yea its called a body perm cuz it gives your hair more body and it doenst look so curly|`|zu32Go8paa	what?|`|ZcbhxUeZaa	Simple answer: DO NOT GET A PERM    They ruin your hair! Not to mention when they grow out they look extremely silly - so even if you are happy with the initial results, your hair will be fried and you will have perm roots. Also, curly perms tend to frizz out. Not good.    I recommend a good conditioner, some volumising root spray and a professional ceramic 2 inch curling iron (the ones from salons may cost a little more, but they are worth every dollar).|`|kHHSAEF5aa	shure use big rollers ,root perm this fromm the roots out and perm in orange rollers .r u going to a salon or doing it ? If salon be care full to make shure they know what you want big curls ask for a root perm there fullness body with big curls if they don't know what one is then dont go there! |`|f1bdd8f3dd409cdd71223c7d68e40664aa	No.  The larger rods will simply leave a wave.  The look you want can only be achieved by using an iron or hot rollers.
a3BYDqLOaa	 you should have it chemically straightened first. Wait about 2 weeks and then have it colored. The reason you want to do the coloring last is that today's hair colors are nourishing so if there is any damage from the straightener the color will help the condition of your hair. Also depending on the brand of straightener used it may lighten your hair slightly. I hope this helps!|`|tgFfqulXaa	darker dyes actually strengthen the hair so i would do it a week or so after u chemicaly straighten it|`|f1bdd8f3dd409cdd71223c7d68e40664aa	Straighten it first then do the color.  If you did the color first, the relaxer would simply fade the color.  Wait at least one week, two if possible for the best results.|`|kHHSAEF5aa	if you dye first then straighten you will lose allot of color , vise verse if you straighten first you then dye you will lose some of that straightening not as bad though I would dye last.  you can do it all at once providing you have healthy hair . prepair this with using protein leave in spray bio loge to get healthy hair .biologe has this. vit E, D also is great for the hair. |`|GqvAXWNcaa	Dye it then straighten.

qQr5D3qbaa	I had dyed my hair black for 3 years after i had my daughter.  I tried to bleach it and i burnt it all off.  So i went back to black just to hide some of the damage.  I read about this stuff on Folica.com called color fix.  I can't remember who the manufacturer is but you can search for it on Folica.  I worked really well.  I just wish i had used it the first time and not bleached my hair.  I had very little damage or breakage, but it does smell really bad.  It took me about a week to get the entire smell out of my bathroom, but it was well worth it.  You can go on Folica and there are alot of before and after photos as well as reviews.  Also to help the brassy color after wards, you can dye your hair over with an ash based color.  You can also use pantenes Silver expressions shampoo.  It is purple based and helps neutralizes the red tones in the hair.  I keep a bottle around and use it for a couple days or so after each hair dye.  Good Luck.|`|eRveqo7caa	you could use a milder peroxide (which is what they most often use in salons combined with a bleach) peroxides usually come from 10% to 50% using a 10% or 20% would lighten your black or dark brown hair a lighter shade then you could use a toner to get exactly what you were going for.    or just wait for your natural hair colour to grow in...|`|kBQp7Wv9aa	I had black for several years and when I finally decided I wanted it out I spent a lot of money at a salon to get it lightened, then going in every couple of months to get highlights in. It works really well; as long as you're patient and ready for a little breakage.|`|ujeSLqxAaa	I find when people try and do their own hair they can get into some serious trouble that then costs a fortune in corrective color to fix or damages the hair.  I am so sorry to hear about your last experience at the salon.  It should never cause you pain and when you go to a salon you should get the results you want.  Look for a nice local boutique that is popular in the city.  Let them know what you are trying to do and they should be able to help you.  Avoid chains like super cuts or great clips as they don't specialize in requests such as these.  Good luck, let us know how it turns out.|`|ro3X9fs3aa	first off never ever ever put black on ur hair again , black never comes off , u can do brown/dark brown but never black , unless u want to keep ur hair black for a very long time than ok , but other than that do not , so now u have dark brown , the best way is to wait , if u remove the color ur hair wont be able to take that and might actually brake off, u dont want that , so just be patient and wait , or u can get some highlights to make it lighter but it still ur choice of what u would like to do, im just telling u from my own experience , not good :(
x8VmRaZZaa	I use cucumber to soothe my skin. I drink 8 - 10 glasses of water|`|OgQOVsxPaa	Well, for skin:    I use Amie skin products (purely for young skin)  http://www.amieskincare.com/    -Once a week a use an Amie face mask.  -Every morning, I splash cold water on my face, then gently massage Amie purifying facial wash in, then rinse with warm water. I then apply Amie matt-finish moisturiser.  -If I have tired looking eyes, I use an old technique. I shove a spoon in the freezer, then hold over my eyes. Makes you feel fresh!    -Before I go to bed, I wash my face and pat dry.   -I then use a water-based Evian moisturiser. It is really light and refreshing.  -For my lips, overnight, I put on Johnson's 'Moon Care' lip balm.    I never wear any makeup, occasionally I wear mascara and eye shadow/liner, and a light coat of lip gloss.    -For hair, I was about once every 3 days, as I have perfect healthy hair and it never gets greasy.  -I use a Charles Worthington paddle brush.  -I use Andrew Collinge conditioner, and herbal essences shampoo.    Throughout the day I carry around Palmer's coco butter lip balm, which is great. In the mornings, I put on Blistex daily lip treatment.    I think that's it!    :)|`|oThKwCw4aa	I take a multivitamin capsule everyday and my hair is really amazing...|`|b87PkQLlaa	uhh wow haha youre high maintance! i like to mac make up!!!|`|baGMCqhGaa	well, for makeup i use bare minerals, it looks so natural and is worthm the money. i also use chocolate eyeliner instead of black because it doesnt look as harsh. i apply eyeliner on the uppper and lower lash line about 2/3 of the way in from ther outside and then smudge it.
3VizNJV8aa	well head and shoulders doesn't work or selsun blue either.  i use Dawn dish detergent every 2 or 3 nights and wash my hair in it twice.  my mom also buys me Fish Oil pills that give you vitamins for your scalp so it doesnt get flaky.  also, try to have a monthly scratch like go thru your hair and gently scrap up the dandruff.  then use tea tree oil and sleep in it (put a towel over your pillow!) then wake up and shower  i have been doing this for awhile now and my hair looks ALOT better  i'm not as shy about my hair.    P.S.-be sure to take 2 vitamins every night (dont chew cuz they're nasty!) and after about 2 weeks if you've seen an improvement from all this, then just take 1 a night|`|GB858dS0aa	selsun blue|`|nvYt8FV7aa	Use Head & Shoulders!|`|JGeglWJ9aa	head and shoulders....no doubt about it|`|5f4df7a0d6349251e2eb823b66ee0625aa	There are a lot of shampoos and conditioners you can try like selsun blue, neutrogena has a shampoo specifically for dandruff.

Brush hair with a copper infused brush every day to like minimize the flaky scalp.
SRo6mw9Faa	believe when i say i know how to do this. you will need a chair, a spoon, milk, a bowl, and some captain crunch. go to a place with lots of people and take your chair and then eat a bowl of captain crunch. do that or something spontaneous that you would usually do only in front of other people trust me when i say eating a bowl of captain crunch in front of a crowd is no different then eating at a restaurant. its the same concept. anyway if you think its embarrassing you going to miss out on a lot of fast food. i tell you to do this because humility is one of the best way to grow confidence.|`|pXnoIJHzaa	Have good posture , speak loudly , look people in the eyes when your talking to them|`|Q8No6oe0aa	i would start by finding things about urself that u are happy with, not things that u keep wishing u could change. sounds stupid but it helped me  i used to be really unconfident but now sometimes i can look in the mirror and be relatively happy|`|hbtCPs5qaa	one of the most effective one in my case was-   standing in front of a mirror possibly bathroon coz noone can disturb, then telling your self repeatedly - that you are perfect, yes i mean perfect. God made me and I am just absolutely perfect. i accept myself.   that's it. for me as well, as simple as it sounds, it's hard to believe this as we are in pressurized society.   and there is always like some sense of competition going on.   if you say you are good or better or even the best, it would always have this little truth behind it that there are other ppl around as you are compairing yourself, but with who? being the best among any group of ppl, it is only momentarily as someone soon take over....    so Avoid sense of competition. this is hardest thing for me to do as i grew up in family which tends to compare things...and Gosh, its one of the worst thing you can do to your potential.

ug4KmQEuaa	Clinique has a great lengthening mascara.|`|AA12229839	i use diorshow and i love it. everyone comments about how my lashes look fake because of length, but natural because they're touchable.|`|AuL6U51caa	I love to try out different mascara, and have found great success w/ Loreal Double Extend. The base coat lengthens & defines your lashes dramatically without looking overdone, then the top coat darkens the long lashes. It works great.

2kMuXxfgaa	Try hair removing cream, or wax. I know wax can be painful but it takes weeks to come back and no itchy mess. You can also purchase lotion or some sort of cream that causes the hair to grow back in a longer period of time.

QA3qpa2jaa	If you want a natural, at-home, inexpensive method, try this website, it worked for me:    http://www.earthclinic.com/CURES/moles.h...    Good luck!|`|OwLcbnTvaa	You can get them cut out at the doctors, for relatively cheap, my dad got a whole bunch cut out on his back.|`|0i8XxXG9aa	The only way i know of is laser treatment. You'd have to see a doctor/dermatologist for this. Also, the treatment can cause scarring as th laser works by burning out what makes them visable, so sometimes it scars. Lastly, it hurts to have it done -it's meant to feel like little pin pricks over and over -nothing major.    They obviously bother you since you posted about them, but maybe learning to live with them could be better? Alternatively you could use makeup to cover them. A dermatologist could prescribe specialist make up that's long lasting and covers well and is matched to your skin tone. (at least in england they can)|`|ZHf8mIitaa	See a dermatologist.|`|JDQ2cAy0aa	If you really want ot get rid of them, see a dermatologist and see if they can remove it for you. Be warned, it might be painful like cutting them off, or it could be a cinch and maybe frozen or they could possibly use a lazer to get rid of it..I have no clue look it up.

If you like your hair down, wear it down. It's simple.|`|2kMuXxfgaa	Perhaps you need to feel comfortable with your hair being down in order to erase the thought of "trying" to look pretty or like a "beauty queen". Hair down can usually mean plenty of things such as carefree or laid back.Flaunting could be another reason, if your hair is thick and is hard to handle when fully down then that could be another reason and there are plenty of styles then only leaving it down. Otherwise try it one day and see if it works for you.|`|itmO3yk2aa	every girl should look pretty  i like to wear my hair down, so i do it  you should just wear it how you want

When the sun hits it, it is smoky gorgeous. I also have brown eyes and ivory skin, and naturally brown hair.     Go for it.

h91Zbay1aa	I don't rate the kits if I'm honest. The lashes aren't as flexible as say the dylash brand. The tweezers don't work any better than regular tweezers. All they're used for is to hold the lashes whilst attaching.     xxx
2VP2ACkDaa	EWWW!!!! i hate them|`|k1LkC9Bnaa	My friend just asked me the exact same thing! I think if you wear it appropriately like you say you do now, then its just a scarf. The controversy is less with the scarf and more with the ignorant people who make it out to be more than a piece of cloth. Many arabs wear it on their head because it simply it protects them from desert climate and represents ancient mesopotamian activities/custom, but that isn't the only way to wear it. Don't worry and wear what you like!|`|FA0POUMhaa	Being Jewish, I find it repulsive that it would become a fashion trend. Do you like to wear it just for the controversy? There are many other scarves out there (Burberry anyone?) that are just as warm and functional and don't stand for what the kaffiyeh scarves do.

Id say that if its from the 70's though it might have changed slightly in appearance  , and scent as perfumes are constantly changing slighly to improve the smell    
XgSRmF0gaa	I think if Luke was alive he might say to you "thanks sis but please don't scar your beautiful skin because of me"    I am sure you are a very thoughtful person, hence the need to somehow justify to yourself that you need to get this ugly tattoo (I don't think your brother was ugly, just tattoos). Are you trying to prove to your still grieving mum that you care or are you thinking about getting this tattoo because your friends are getting them?    I don't want to sound mean but ........... you never knew your brother so you weren't close to him. I am not saying you should ignore the fact that your mum lost a son. I am just saying there are more appropriate tributes you could make to a brother you never knew.    Good luck with your choice. Before you make your decision, take a look at some old tattoos and not just the fresh ones your friends are fascinated by.    |`|9d1QdLvGaa	You could put a verse from a poem read at his funeral, a kangaroo ((ausralia day)), His initials, You could get Beloved brother and his initals or something in that area, his date of birth or death.. You could get the number 2 scince he died when he was 2.. ohh u could get a blue 2 scince he was a boy.. you could get a phrase that he said constantly like my brother always called the movie 101 dalmations movie dog.

A scroll with his DOB & DOD, or the OZ flag with these dates (that would be orginal!!)|`|jBWR9t4uaa	you could put his birthdate.   or  you could write his name is Chinese letters |`|PMPeYN8Vaa	you could get a tiny heart next to his birthday - to the day he passed :( 
AA11287657	Unfortunately these gloves and "hair removal creams" are really no better than using a razor - they only "shave the hair off" the surface of the skin like a razor does.  So you'll find the hair growing back just as quick and thicker and stronger as it does with shaving.  If you only have a few hairs - it's best to pluck them - use some ice to numb area first if you don't like plucking.  Otherwise use a "Nads" product - a gel that does the same as wax (removes hair from root) but you don't have to heat it like was - just apply straight from jar - you can buy it from supermarkets.|`|IkV24Qcmaa	I went to a beauty convention in Brentwood not long ago and she used the mitt on my mate on her leg and it felt so so smooth! You can use it anywhere on your body. Only down side is, it doesnt take the hair from the root so chances are your hairs will grow back faster :-S
AA11287657	I have very sensitive skin, to the point where a lot of the time it is raw in places.  These things help:-  Drink lots of water.  Never use soap to wash! Use either Sorblelene Cream with NO ADDITIVES such as colour, fragrance etc. or search our helath food shops etc. for similar thing.  Use a moisturiser with NO ADDITIVES twice daily at least.  Never go in the sun without wearing a sunscreen with NO ADDITIVES.  Find a completely natural washing detergent for your clothes.  If you do all these things regularly and still experinece problems gp to your doctor - I do when My skin is very bad (I make it worse by picking at it - another thing you shouldn't do!) and she prescibes an antibacterial cream that is heavenly relief .  PS. Don't be fooled by most of the creams, etc. out their that say they are "natural, organic, etc. etc." - you have to read ALL the small writing on the back - the ingredients etc. to see what's really in it.  It also it may be an idea to talk to your doctor about the possibility of whether any foods you eat or medications you take may be affecting your skin.  Hope it gets better for you!|`|e1DLlitKaa	have you ever tried Natio? it's an Australian brand, it uss natural plant extracts and i've heard that it can be used on sensitive skin.
W9GFv2VMaa	dont get it wet for about 2 days. some people say dont expose it to light etc. but its about what you want.  the savalon thing you got right. not everyone gets cracking.  my tattooist told me its gonna get proper itchy but it didnt, peeled a bit and thats it.|`|wtjzAwp5aa	I've had lots of tattoos from different places and the aftercare advice is always different. I find the best thing is to use savlon until it starts to scab then just keep it clean and moisturised.    Try not to over wash it or it will get sore and whatever you do don't be   tempted to pick the scabs off!    The clearest tattoo I've got is the one on my spine that I couldn't reach to do anything with anyway.    Oh also, don't let it soak in the bath, have a shower or a quick dip but no falling asleep in the tub.  |`|w05TELqAaa	You could have used the "Search for questions" bit for this - look, it's ^ up there ^ right in the middle of the screen.  To repeat an earlier answer, I've heard so many bizarre after-care suggestions over the years: haemorrhoid cream, salty water, moisturiser... I have quite a few tats and, without exception, the ones that healed the quickest are the ones I can't see and can't reach. Leave it alone and let your body do its thing. Keep it clean, keep it out of the sun, and be patient.|`|bNllesmMaa	You are ment to wash the tattoo under running water for a few seconds, this will NOT damage the tattoo at all.  Clean it with some soap, and then use Bepanthen to help it from not cracking.  Bepanthen is used by all professional highly recognised tattoo artists in England.  Do not pick at the tattoo, as you are at risk of pulling out the ink then.|`|AA12284245	the whole idea of not getting it wet is so the scab doesnt get soggy so gently cleaning it twice a day is fine aslong as you patt it dry before putting the cream on it. baths are a no no but a quick shower is fine . after the first week the scab gets dryer and flakier so a bit more cream helps and about the third week youl notice the scab coming off and i found that the more cream i appled the easier it was because the scab just rubbed off when i was rubbing the cream in . as long as your gentle with in and avoid scratchind or rubbind at it youll be fine    |`|mwZ65245aa	no you are not supposed to get it wet it will fade the color your supposed to avoid water and sunligght and let the scab come off itself and you have to constantly put unscented lotion on it|`|6b0a0984954dc8df8aa9cb35fc1d6934aa	The tattoo will dry and start to scab.This is normal.Avoid sunlight ,swimming pools for about a week.Use mild mousturising creams,soap and water and most importantly do not pick the scabs off.It will take a couple of weeks for the scabs to fall off on their own.|`|EIOHbmHkaa	NO ****ing mate the best thing is Preparation H for hemorroids. Put it on as much as possible and it stops it cracking and gives it a bit of waterproof. Works a charm! Trust me honest. I've got 3 my husband has 30 + and the only one he used savlon on looked not so good for a while.|`|uFJVsGl6aa	you have to put on a.d on your tattoo fist thing noting but a,d o.k thta well make it form cracking and when it get to pealing lets it come off on its own not peal it off when you take a bath that when it fall by it self have any more question hit me up at asscubano@yahoo.com on myspace |`|UxFJ4gcJaa	Only wash it twice a day with gentle hand washing soap, but keep it moisturized with ointment.

I have these sponge curlers that you wrap around your hair and sleep on them. They turn out as PERFECT curls. But i'm guessing you don't have them. So use markers, hair spray a small section , and wrap it around the marker, open it up & press it down so it is secure. and hair spray again. the smaller the marker, the smaller & tighter the curls, if you don't have time to do this, i suggest you just braid your hair , not tight tho, that will make very tight waves.

9wkGR8nlaa	I'm pretty sure those tablets are supposed to be digested in order for the body to absorb the Vitamin E.  I don't think the hair will be able to absorb it that way, as it is not structured for that purpose (the Vitamin E TABLET).|`|AA11386158	Yes you can. It's good for your hair and skin.

AA12229839	if your hair is really light brown you could go to a drugstore and use a kit.. like loreal preference. it's recommended to go within 3 shades of your natural color, so very light brown could easily turn into medium blonde. look at the side of the box, it has pictures of what your natural color will look like with the dye. there are some brands, like perfect 10 (which has low ammonia) and herbal essences (which has no ammonia) but all have peroxide. do not use a bleach kit on your hair. use a blonde hair-dying kit.|`|Z0DmVnxNaa	I would not do it all at once. Like... do more light highlights first. Then wait a month or so and THEN dye it blonde. I think that will work better... Use Garnier hairdye. its good stuff & under $10    Good Luck!|`|2ziEx5GEaa	I'd say bleach is the answer, BUT those girls you saw with orange and yellow hair clearly did not know what they were doing, have someone who knows what they're doing help you or go to a professional.|`|hmlggYi6aa	Bleach your hair, then dye it blond.The developer in the hair die can only lighten to a certain amount.Be sure to use a good dye.|`|aXUrVUyPaa	You CAN lighten your hair using a HiLift series hair color, but has to be at a level 9 already to have this lift enough to get your at a blonde.  The only way to make your hair this color blonde, especially if you are starting at a light brown color, is to use bleach.  Your hair won't turn out orange or yellow if you go to a stylist who knows what they are doing and uses a toner after lightening it.  Have your stylist either do a full foil slice on your hair(this lightens the most amount of hair, having about 60% of hair lightened).  This will give you the blonde results you want while still looking fairly natural.

It brings out the blue in your eyes. :-)|`|f1958dce4135a2864bf4bbbc09a66a86aa	There are shampoos and conditioners that are made with a small amount of dye in them so that over time your hair color changes. My hair did the same thing, it happens a lot with blonds. There are also some hair products that help to sun bleach your hair. You brush it in and then go out in the sun, over time it makes your hair lighter. With most blonds though their hair naturally does this already. My hair gets a lot lighter on its own over the summer simply because it is getting more direct sunlight.   |`|uZP5SHd9aa	Try mixing lemon juice and water in a spray bottle and spraying it on your hair before you go out in the sun.

f1958dce4135a2864bf4bbbc09a66a86aa	It depends, brown hair is a dominant gene to red which means it has a greater chance of being passed on and expressed in your children. However, if you are heterozygous (Which means you carry a recessive gene) for brown then that increases the chances the chances of her hair coming through (depending on what your parents look like).   If both of your parents have brown hair then this is how your kids may turn out:  B=brown  b=red  you=BB  her=bb  BB+bb=Bb; Bb; Bb; Bb    Using that then all of the kids would turn out to have brown hair, but its pretty much a guessing game. Sexual reproduction is just about as random as you can get. |`|1s5PHN80aa	Usually dark brown. Dark hair is a dominant gene apposed to red hair. But you can never really know, people are different for many different reasons.|`|pMi0xTOtaa	, We just learned this in science! Brown is a dominat color.|`|91gLoX6taa	it would be right in between!
AA12229839	i think your hair is absolutely gorgeous! so definitely do not cut it. try styling it differently each day, curling it with a ceramic iron monday, braiding it tuesday, half pony wednesday, hot rollers thursday, straight friday.. or whatever tickles your fancy. most importantly, do not make a hair-length-altering decision because your friends talk you into it :)|`|NBUBGSJKaa	I like your hair.  I think that it would be better if it was a little more out of your eyes; they're so pretty.  Side swept bangs might help that.  A little shorter would suit your face well.  Don't get too short (2-4 inches below your chin is about right)  Try just spicing it up a bit.  Straightened hair is great, but not for every day.  Pony tails, messy buns, curls, ringlets, waves, braids, half ponies, buns, just blow dried straight, etc.  Try a different one every day.  If you need to practice a style, do it on Saturday morning or Friday night.  That way, you can always rinse it out!  Good luck and happy hair.|`|txr9qPZQaa	http://img257.imageshack.us/img257/7282/...

Maybe all of your friends are just jelous that you look like nancy drew. lol
lxAP3n3vaa	heey, wow that really sucks, you poor thing...i don't think i'd last. most schools have rules like that but don't enforce them.     maybe try a good pre-foundation skin primer and then apply your foundation. skin primers are really good and they allow your foundation and other make-up to just glide over your skin, which will get rid off those dry flaky bits that sometimes appear after your make-up is on. you could also try mineral foundation, which looks really natural. i also hear trublend is really good and you can't see it even close up.    you could paint your nails with a light pink and clear nail polish on top or a french manicure, but make sure your nails aren't too long. you can get acrylics as well (once again not too long). they look nice and clean. or you could always just go clear with glitter, or without.    the nose piercing...you could always just take it out at school and wear it once you get home or leave school. you can also purchase small clear studs that aren't very noticeable at all. if you can't find those, and you don't want to leave it out, then make sure you are wearing a small less noticeable stud.     hope this helps and good luck with all this and your new school =)|`|UuCblv3Caa	Trublend by Covergirl.

It's not like one of our nuns will walk up to us and touch our face to make sure were not wearing cover-up. You'll be fine just don't do anything drastic. |`|jCWAYgaMaa	Tinted moisturizer for your face, followed by translucent (pretty much colorless) powder, if you want powder. Mascara should be fine, as long as you keep it clear, black, or brown. Burt's Bees lips products are amazing and very natural.   As for nail polish, clear with glitter would probably be fine, as long as it was just sort of sprinkled in looking, instead of all glitter all over.   I'm not sure who makes them, but clear nose studs are definitely  available. If that won't work, just wear the nose ring after school. |`|I1eNscocaa	 you could  wear true blend foundation or mineral powder as make up. wear natural colors as close to your skin colour as possible. light gloss lip gloss maby? as for the nose stud, what i did was buy these studs that are see through. they are hard to find but its good as no one can tell you are wearing one [ i used them so my mother dearest didn't find out when i got my nose done and they work].|`|FAr8ALwQaa	believe me, i go to a school which is meant to be hell strict with no makeup and no more than one piercing in each ear but they dont really enforce it and ive never heard a teacher tell a student to take their makeup off. i wear mineral powder foundation stuff, its a bit less obvious because it doesnt give you those lines down the side of your face where the makeup finishes and your neck starts but it still works. just try and tone down the mascara and eyeliner, and you should be fine becase no one really notices. you could try wearing nailpolish, the worse they could do is make you take it off (i always wear a ligh pink that you cant really see from far away but it still looks nice).    with the nose piercing, a few chicks in my year have them and they just wear small studs, or get the clear ones or put that flesh coloured tape over them. if you've had the piercing for a while then it shoudnt closeup after six hours or however long your school day is, you can just wear it at night and on the weekends.    good luck, i know it sucks but theres ways around it. if your school is anything like mine no one gives a sh!t!|`|L4SSw0Ahaa	mineral foundation works well and so does mixing a dab of foundation in with a moisturizer and applying it with a makeup sponge.     you can curl your eyelashes with an eyelash curler to define your eyes a bit .. you may be able to get by with even a swipe of mascara (one that only lengthens will look more natural than one that thickens your lashes)     you could do a subtle french manicure for your nails .. don't do it with really long nails, but on short nails it will look polished but not overdone. even a couple coats of clear nailpolish will look better than nothing    |`|uly3aFqtaa	I have my makeup really subtle pretty much everyday. My school allows makeup and everything, but I just don't like the whole cake-face thing.    I use makeup sponges to apply my makeup. They're like $3 for a pack of 12 that come in all different shapes [from the $2 shop]. Theyre just normal sponges that you dip into liquid foundation, and dab on [dont rub or it'll just move around the foundation rather than keeping it in one place].  Start under your eyes and dab around in semi-circles. Please stand nice and close to a mirror because it'll look smooth from far away but it'll still be only half-rubbed in close up! I mix my foundation with a moisturiser [not one that turns white when you rub it in! I have Clean and Clear moisturiser].  Blend at your jawline, and I have found that picking a foundation LIGHTER than my skintone by a few shades is much better. Remember, you can always even it out with a REALLY subtle powder.    The best thing to do to make it look like you're wearing less makeup is to apply LESS on your whole nose. Because your nose is right in the middle of your face, people usually focus on that before your skin itself.    When all liquid foundation has been applied, get a cotton tip and remove the foundation from the crease of your nose [it usually tends to cake up there a little bit, which is a dead giveaway].    There's no need for mascara! Just curl your eyelashes using a curler [they can be tricky to use at first, but you'll get the hang of it!].     Dont use eyeshadow either. Just use the foundation all over your eyelids and BLEND WELL!    I love Rimmel Recover Perfect Skin foundation. They come in numbers [ 1 is foundation,  2 is illuminating [not good for a no-makeup effect cause its quite shimmery and pinkish], and I dont know what  3 is!]. I have  1 which is SO good. Just dont apply too much or it'll rub off while you apply it!    It sounds really weird, but my skin almost looks aslight greeny-yellow colour! I thought that I would always have to wear makeup to cover it, but I have found that splashing cool water on my face in the morning makes my skin nice and pink which is really good :]  Just dont use REALLY cold water [or really hot water] cause it can burst little capillaries in your skin [theyre teeny tiny little veins that cant be fixed once broken. It's not serious but they are noticeable].    As for your lips, use a chapstick. You'll feel 'naked' without all your makeup, but really, you wont look any different from anyone else at the school.    With your nails, just buff them! Buy a nail buffer [A few dollars from a $2 shop] and theyll shine as much as wearing clear nail polish. It wont look like your wearing polish though, so you'll get away with it and it looks really pretty :]    Good luck :]|`|k4DYGtxBaa	bare minerals is ahmazing! i use it and i got it from ulta  as for nail polish you could use glitter nail polish, thats probly the only thing you could wear with out it getting noticed.   as for the piercing i really dont know, i guess just put it back in when you get home from school everyday.|`|b9a25e0d3e644235a89b321fd895e151aa	you could try wearing makeup that is close to your skin color to hide that you are wearing makeup (like a natural shade) but this might still not work.     I suggest you have your parents buy you skin acne products, they actually work, but might take sometime to work. We are all self conscious about how we look but do not think about it too much, as I am sure the other students at your school are not perfect either.|`|QLitPd92aa	Well my suggestion is dont wear your nose piercing at school but wear it at home if you don't want your hole to close up. Cover up your blotchy face with foundation and powder(since its a natural color) and don't wear eyeshadow but mascara is ok since most people have naturally dark eyelashes|`|XD2j8BNUaa	you can try clear nail polish, or the kind that match the color of your nail. :D and there is also rice mineral makeup, you can hardly see it and it doesnt count as makeup sorta. its makeup, but you just cant tell. so that means it cant be seen! :D the nose piercing, has to be taken off. unless you want to paint it the same exact color of your skin and hope nobody notices. :D|`|JaGbP9m1aa	My school is really strict and doesn't allow makeup but you know what?

The grade level and specific curriculum a student is involved in can drastically affect what might be an appropriate, well-groomed look.  [edit]  Elementary School    Elementary school students have very active days that often include outdoor activities, recess, and energetic games inside and outside the classroom. Therefore, an elementary student needs a hair style that wont restrict their participation in activities but will still stay put all day. There are many types of haircuts for boys that are perfect for younger students, and both ponytails and pigtails are excellent options for girls. Girls who dont want their hair put up may prefer head bands or other simple accessories that are easy for small hands to manage.  [edit]  Junior High    Junior high students are just starting to discover their personal style in terms of fashion, hair styles, and behavior, and it can be difficult to find just the right school styles for these tweens. The fun, carefree styles that were perfect in elementary school are too young for junior high, but the more elaborate, intensive looks of high school are just a shade too difficult. Great back to school looks for junior high students may include layers for texture and volume without too much bulk, and most medium hair styles are both trendy and easy for middle school students to manage. Girls may appreciate more elaborate hair accessories such as claws and decorative hair pins, but most boys will only want a style that is quick and easy to do without bothering with it throughout the day.  [edit]  High School  Athletes need easy styles.  Athletes need easy styles.    High school students tend to exhibit the widest range of hair styles based on what they will be doing each day. Students with gym classes or after school sports will need styles that are quick and easy to manage or that can easily be converted into no-nonsense looks for athletic participation. Many high school students are also interested in fast hair styles that may let them sleep in a bit longer each day, especially if they work after school jobs that may keep them up late. Students involved in lab science classes such as chemistry, physics, or biology will need hair styles that can be safely worn around chemicals, flames, and other laboratory equipment.    At the same time, many high school students are pushing the boundaries of new hair styles to find ways to express themselves and their beliefs. Many parents may find these hair styles alarming or questionable, but there is no harm in letting students try new looks to find just what suits them.    Popular hair styles for high school students include:        * Bob or short hair styles: Quick and easy, shorter looks are trendy and manageable.      * Hair styles with bangs or fringes: These are easy to do looks that help frame the face and emphasize the eyes.      * Sedu hair styles: The sleek, straight look is a popular trend among teens.      * Emo and scene hair styles: These styles are layered with meaning and are an intimate form of personal expression many teens embrace.     [edit]  College    College students not only want to be trendy when creating their back to school look, but they also want to be sophisticated and taken seriously. Particularly if a student has an internship or may be applying for professional jobs, a well-groomed hair cut is essential. Gone are the days of radical teen styles, and many college students opt for versatile yet easy looks that can be professional and stylish without requiring hours of time that may be better spent working or studying.

wUYHyhSZaa	Get a toothbrush & spread the bristles apart.   Find whatever conditioner you have and put a pea sized amount on the toothbrush.   Get a eyelash curler and squeeze the top lashes for about 5-7 seconds.   Slowly brush your eyelashes until there are no clumps of conditioner on them.   Wait 1 minute, then rinse the toothbrush with water.   Brush your eyelashes with water.   Now wait for them to grow!   It may take about 2 weeks to see a difference.         Tips: Doing this for 3 days makes eyelashes longer.   Doing this for at least a week makes eyelashes thicker.   The eyelash curler also makes your lashes grow upwards if you squeeze hard enough each time.         WarningsDO NOT ever use shampoo, this will just hurt your eyes.   DO NOT brush really fast or hard.   New, nice toothbrushes will not help|`|qsUBsxmEaa	lengthening mascara|`|IxIxPUnnaa	curl them with a eyelash culer and thne put some good mascara on    and/or get fake eyelashes|`|anMuljVgaa	One of the best eyelash treatments on the market is the TALIKA Lipocils Eyelash Conditioning Gel.

Visit www.kristybeauty.com to purchase or for more information|`|kwtOcp5maa	you can either use a really good mascara to make your eye lashes look longer, it would look better if you curled them with the clippers.

It's like this comb with black gucky stuff that girls put on their eye lashes to make them longer. I know that long eye lashes come off as aesthetically pleasing but to me they are a pain.    I'm a guy and my eye lashes are longer than girls that do wear mascara. My eye lashes are always falling out and veiwing things like binoculars and microscopes are a real pain. Sometimes my eyelashes even hit my glasses.    but yeah look into mascara.

Curly hair tends to be more  flyaway, dry and course.  A smoothing balm generally contains more moisturizing properties and will compact the cuticle to keep it from "fuzzing" up.

Apply it to your hair and leave it on for 10-15 minutes then shampoo it off.  For future reference when you wash your hair you should let the warm water run through it for several minutes prior to attempting to add shampoo.  Many hairsprays contain a high level of glucose or sugar and if you don't allow it to soften up before adding shampoo to it, it becomes sticky and forms a buildup.  If you run the warm water through your hair  first,(Until you feel it start to get slick) it will shampoo right out.|`|2iT9TEcxaa	You need to buy "Clarifying Shampoo"  & use a moisturizing conditioner until you can run your fingers through your hair.

If you want to get technical, the fringe at the jawline will actually bring your heart shaped face into what is considered the"perfect face shape" the oval shaped face. But I think you could really pull it off as you have a great face for short hair, your style of dress is funky and out of the box...your cut should be too!

XNFi5Zkqaa	when you take medium brown hair and try to dye it blue with out bleach it just tints your hair blue, it doesnt "result in a greenish color", it just hardly shows.    bleach first then dye, some bleaches can be mixed into dye so you only have to treat your hair once, dont do that with semi or demi permanent dye it'll eat the dye    EDIT: and as for semi vs demi neither last very long, demi i believe is said to last longer but from my experiences and those of friends of mine, neither last long at all|`|CY81laJVaa	demi lasts 4-6 months,  semi is 4-6 weeks normally.|`|IAWNayfvaa	Using demi or semi on brown unbleached hair will most likely do nothing to the hair. You might get a faded tint of blue. Your going to have to use bleach. Then a semi perm color (demi doesn't last as long as semi). Trust me on this one. I've got hot pink streaks. Bleach sucks, keep it off your scalp. Oh and I promise, the blue will fad quickly and you will need to use the semi blue rinse several times to keep the color. Like once a week. But the bottle will usually last until you decide your over the blue...unless you have alot of hair. And the other downside of doing this at all is the root touch up. |`|f1bdd8f3dd409cdd71223c7d68e40664aa	A semi permanent haircolor is simply a stain.  It contains no developer.  Some examples of this would be Manic Panic, Jazzing, Cellophanes. It will last approximately 10 shampoos. A demi permanent color is mixed with a low volume developer (5vol) and has the ability to make hair darker or change the tone only.  It cannot make the hair lighter.   If she attempts to color her hair blue over her natural color will not be vibrant because there's too much pigment underneath, that's the reason for decolorizing.
f1bdd8f3dd409cdd71223c7d68e40664aa	I think what you're wanting is 100% human, Remy hair with the cuticle intact.  Virgin hair is rarely sold commercially as it needs to be colored before retailing.  If you purchase it in it's virgin form, YOU would need to color it before installation.  The best hair that I could recommend is the Bliss (Cuticle intact) hair from Doctoredlocks.com    It's the best hair I could recommend to someone who is not a licensed cosmetologist and a certified extension specialist.  |`|yrQFXxcXaa	I can cut some of mine out & sell you it I am a virgin : )|`|FDImJ5DQaa	Are you onabout wigs or something else? lol sorry but i dont get it, probs an american thing or something?

AA10639728	Im a nursing student, and itching around a cut or wound can sometimes indicate infection. Is it red too? try putting neosporin or bacitracin around the piercing (you can buy it over the counter anywhere-walmart, cvs etc). But as long as you dont itch it excessively, it should heal fine with or without medicine. |`|f1bdd8f3dd409cdd71223c7d68e40664aa	It means it's healing.  |`|gu1xI2Poaa	I'm not a body piercing expert, but usually when a cut, wound, etc., is itching it indicates the healing process.  |`|grWiAxWXaa	it's healing silly.... that's what happens.

fvre0o9laa	Depends on the handbag you're making what fabrics and interfacing you'll need.    May I suggest you might want to try some of the Lazy Girl bag designs?  You'll get a good pattern with materials specified, very good directions, and if you get really stuck, Joan's been known to have some advice.  The patterns are engineered to go together very well.  http://www.lazygirldesigns.com/ and she's got a few freebies, too.    Kwiksew also has a freebie clutch purse pattern with good instructions:  http://www.kwiksew.com/Projects.cfm -- it's an easy place to learn piping.    At least as a beginner, my suggestions are to cut and sew as precisely as you can, using a good pattern.  Precision is really the key to nice bags.|`|3L9bRmOqaa	The material you used could be thin and also what kind of sewing needle did you use when making the bag?  If you have a needle that is too thick, the stiching will make the fabric tear or have that tear.  I use a mid-weight material like canvas or denim when making tote bags (a bag with some weight to it).  Remember, use the appropriate sewing needle for your machine based on the fabric you use.    Like yourself, I just started out making bags myself.  My mother-in-law sews her own clothes and bags and this was the advice I was given by her.|`|cHSiyWlZaa	You can use upholstery weight fabric and get a really cool look.  Check sites like ebay for unique fabric finds.  I have bought several times from http://www.designerfabricstudio.com for my home decorating projects, but I am sure there are fabrics that could suit apparel and accessory design as well.  You probably want to avoid using cheap crafting fabrics like the kinds you find at Joann's because they will just make your handbags look like a cheap homemade thing.  It is all about the quality of the fabric, you can really tell the difference.
tfmBqCkdaa	You could go with spider bites, one labret, a septum (but you would have to take out your nose) or an eyebrow. I usually hate eyebrows, but you really work it. You could get your tongue pierced, or your bridge. I think personally you should go with like, multiple. Like angel-bites and a septum, or a bridge and a septum. snakebites, monroe, and a septum. septum and snakebites. You could really go with tunnels or what you call "gauges" for a new look. Dahlia piercing maybe?|`|tlLoQUsuaa	whoa,  i love your hair & makeup.  i'm pretty sure you could pull off any piercing you wanted.  but, i'd go with the eyebrow.  it'd look amazing on you!|`|STjfxYfDaa	Seems like the only face piercing you have left is your eyebrow so go for that..

2ZsRAxkuaa	Uk 12/14ish? I'm one for curves, actual curves, rather than flabby bits.  But it really depends on the persons body shape.

Besides, everyone has different taste.    Girls who have a great *** or great legs, for instance, are going to use a larger pants size than a skinny girl. So it all depends on what you like personally, thin, chubby, toned, whatever.|`|BGNdKvXzaa	There is no perfect size for any woman.  Unlike for men, whom women think should all be at least 6'0" in height, men do not establish perfect heights, weights, or dress size for women.  The average dress size in America is 14, which the fashionistas, who for the most part are gay men and anorexic females, have decided is abominable.      But we normal, sane men reject such reasoning as ridiculous and bad for a woman's health. Be whatever size you are.  Just stay healthy.|`|tkKUyE1maa	it depends on the occasion.|`|EPTaL9Ajaa	It depends on the person and how confident she is in that size.|`|zThTF9Slaa	The size that fits her.    Don't be so narrow minded as to think that a dress size makes a woman 'perfect'.    Australian size 16...|`|KLAyxOLVaa	I would say UK size 10/12 as that is when women look the most healthy..

fzvFGmelaa	I'm about to do work experience, and it doesn't matter where you work, what job your doing or how posh it is, they don't pay you. They're having to pay someone more to supervise you etc and it's not an actual job, they're just taking you in for the week.   However, if they think you're good enough they may ask you to get a part time job there on the weekends maybe, THEN they will pay you.|`|o1fgTGzzaa	don't think they will pay you, as it would cost them a bit taking time to teach you things!    you may get free things, like hair cuts or products.    i know certain places which would ask you to pay them for work experience!
kG9oI68eaa	OKay first of all its not an implant.  However, after your nose job your nose has packing in it which means you can't breath through it.  Your face get very swollen for about a week and there is lots of bruising under your eyes.  It is definitely painful but once you get the packing out after a week it is such a relief.  You can finally breathh.  But it is still sensitive for a month or two.  You can swim after you get the packing out but you just have to be careful. And yes it hurts to put on shirts that go over the head. Email me if you have nay other questions, I got one and dont regret it at all.|`|Ztdw7nrLaa	I haven't done a nose job, but I saw what my friend went through.  As far as I know you ain't allowed to do any kind of sports for like 2 weeks.  And you can't rub your nose or anything... (or well, as much as you can) So, I guess it's gonna be unlucky to catch a cold right after a nose surgery...  Also you can't put on a make up for 2 weeks...  But after 2 weeks, you can almost do anything ( I think you still can't do some "heavy" sports for awhile, but you can put on make up blah blah)  Just consult a plastic surgeon or ask someone who has done the surgery. Those know the best.    ~~~~~~~~~~~

Simple but cute.|`|j3DqJ2BBaa	NO WAY its like a grannys dress or part of an old curtain|`|kPmzj4Rcaa	Either black tights, and a black cami top with a black cardi bangles and necklaces :], or a white top, with a light pink cardi, and pearls.  xx|`|LeoazSyAaa	ewwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwww...  thtas so ewwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwww...|`|j5yR7aBmaa	Plain white vest top with a pearl necklace.

A plain white vest with a black cropped cardigan on top.   Pearly/pinky beads would look cute too, and maybe a matching chunky bracelet.
TrZcOcEwaa	I would just get like a halter neck bikini but not the string one, maybe one with plenty of padding and support so you know its going to stay put. Boy shorts are very cool I would try and get a bikini that was the same colour so it matches and yeah thats fine wearing a top over, you can always take it off if you want too. Hope eveything goes okay.|`|3B6p9zEiaa	Get a nice tankini... Its like a singlet top at the top with bikini bottoms (cossie material), and you can still wear boardies with em... make sure they are above the knee though.. I don't think it looks nice when girls wear long board shorts.. What exactly is it that your'e self conscious about?? its easier to help with if we know.|`|1RiZUdADaa	Are you wearing a bikini because the other girls will be too?  If you are...a longer halter top with normal bottoms, stay away from the tie sides! The longer halters usually come just above the belly button but not too high. I would actually suggest that you wear boy shorts with this top as well. Since your self-conscious this will make you look nice without trying to look too old for your age!|`|Nzc7t6KEaa	1. They're boardshorts, not boyshorts.  2. This really wasn't worth asking. Just go buy one you like and wear it.|`|shMZBv7zaa	how about trying a tankini. the top kinda looks like a tank top and the bottom is well you know like a bikini bottom. if you don't like showing your legs, you could buy one of those skirt thingys.|`|BIwTZoJuaa	Do not imitate others and just wear what u feel confortable in. Iadvice u to wear boy short or as u used to wear and do not get older before time and believe me u 'll be nice|`|MVsQ2xjIaa	you can get a tankini which is like a tank top (in bikini material) and the bottom. That way you won't show your chest nor belly if you don't feel at ease with classmates.  There are one piece bathsuit that are really cute and pretty too, just go through the different stores and get an idea of what theya re sailing and which you prefer the most|`|EsVjwKPAaa	if you're comfortable, then wear it... but if you're not, then don't.|`|HQ7q2we1aa	wear what you're most comfortable wearing. good luck.
tHg6Wg8jaa	my daughter is making her holy communion too this year, i have found a great website   http://www.communionangels.co.uk/|`|59AiKKuCaa	my cousin did her communion when she was 13. she just wore a white babydoll style dress from h&m. on her picturess she didnt look too out of place. just dont over dress your child haha.
bU3mvdxIaa	it would only look bad @$$ if you get really long spikes so it really looks like fangs.  It is doable, if you have the right face for it and use the right rings.  Can't say it would work for you, as I haven't seen you but it could definitely be cool.|`|TdGbIDH8aa	I think they are totally cute :)  I've wanted to do that for a while XD  Do it ?|`|iF92Q2f3aa	Both look pathetic and unaesthetic, and together they would be more than doubly so, due to synergy.|`|X40Ww89qaa	hilarious|`|czAbrzcUaa	They look kinda cute on her but it depends if it would suit you.  Snake bites look waaaaay better than angel bites.  (:|`|9xgGd9praa	I think they look quite cute, I'm not a a fan of lip piercing/snakebites, but the Monroes look nice.|`|7XIyslo5aa	"Angel bites" are lush. I had mine done and loved them.

If you really wanna get them both then do it.. who knows you just might be one of those people who actually can pull it off ;)

m32WmvP1aa	13 maybe 14|`|n99NOgHJaa	I am going to guess 13. You have a younger looking face. And yah just seems right. I know this one person who looks like she is 14 but really is 20. ( she is medium height,pale skin blond hair and blue eyes) And she dresses like a 20year old but people think she is her 23 year old sisters kid ! My point is it really can be hard to guess some ones age just based on looks !|`|0XdkbEtFaa	id say 14 possibly 15 because of the way you dress and the fact you asked this question|`|e33d8d3e0ec2509a9d2f30e691a5c124aa	12 or 13 there all the same style|`|tg89r7ZJaa	you look like your 15 because of your face it looks like a young girl and your hair and clothes the way you ware them...|`|iuQ2DBoyaa	maybe 12 or 13. Mostly because you have a young looking face, the way your cheek bones are shaped they make you look younger then you might be. ( which can be a good thing ) Also Your eyebrows are a bit bushy so they just (to me ) make you look younger. Good luck on your report.!!!|`|O57Ky6D0aa	I'd say about 14 because of your clothes and the way you style your hair!|`|ri7psS2Paa	10 and a half|`|RnCmQtUbaa	i think you look about fourteen. fifteen tops. you look like you're at the age where you're finding your own style and creating your own look (which btw, i really like). You don't look mature enough to be 16...I can't picture you driving quite yet. you also seem like you're somewhat small and you may still be growing.|`|wj1dd6NMaa	I'd say you were between 14 and 15  As I can see your hair and makeup  makes you appear older but you  still have quite a young face.|`|QmWzBERjaa	You look like your 13 or 14.  (:|`|bY2lCUERaa	14-15  your hair is so young looking the way it is cut.  and the bright colored clothing/rainbow colors make you look even younger.  hope that helps.. =]  peace|`|BQY6itt6aa	im gonna say 15 or 16 , because you said its a life skills project - and that just sounds like something that a high schooler would have to do|`|AA10414585	Post your pic on here, it a bunch of different people guess your age and it gives you the average...  http://howoldareyou.net|`|ctYrxVCoaa	13-17 :D wide range, but kids change like hell at this age xD

Now about the haircut, hmmm i need you to post a picture of you for me so i can see what i can work with to find something thats you.

H7ecdHDyaa	Well you could take a 2-4 inch iron curler and curl your hair and take two pieces of your hair and take a pretty barret and have it hold there.  Or you could just let your hair curly    Hmm, you could also straighten it and crimp it to make it look fun  You could buy some colored extensions and put them in your hair:P    Something you, and sometimes you have to try something new!|`|1nmCpqsWaa	http://www.teenidols4you.com/blink/Actor...|`|6Zf8K3PAaa	i have this problem too!   i straighten my hair some days-  i curl it other in like different ways  i scrunch or make spiral curls-  i make two braids  and i got bangs cut  with some layers-  it looks pretty cool(:  good luck. xx|`|e33d8d3e0ec2509a9d2f30e691a5c124aa	Braids, fish tail|`|baGMCqhGaa	i have layers and long side swept bangs. i use a flat iron every morning and flip the ends under. it looks great and lasts all day.|`|7w7Q12fFaa	Check out these!!!  1.http://www.hairstyles53.com/wp-content/u...  2.http://i204.photobucket.com/albums/bb15/...  3.http://z.about.com/d/beauty/1/5/X/g/prom...|`|xRvfXWdnaa	-A Ponytail with the pump in the front    -Curls    -Straight out with a bang

It has no personality, too bland, boring colors.|`|vJRMmgd6aa	hmm i dont like the colors but i love the design|`|Toz7gyuhaa	Personally, I don't like it much but it would probably be fine in a room without other patterns.    However, if you're not sure about it either, maybe you shouldn't get it? If you have things in your home that you really love and make you happy to look at and/or use, I think that makes you feel better all round. :-D|`|OfUje9r8aa	its nice bit pricey tho!|`|cGRyDCpQaa	I love the design but hate the colors... might look different when the room is all put together though.|`|YzKRUniLaa	its kind of that 70's look from the 90's|`|IrY6w2X2aa	I like it! lovely colours. depends what style the room is in which you are putting it in.|`|QlUNyK4Paa	its cute.|`|nDxcdgCgaa	its alrite, the sheep skin ones are better rif u dont like that kinda thing get fake sheep skin|`|WuEcETAlaa	i likeee it :) xx|`|wj1dd6NMaa	The patterns okay I guess but  It might be nicer if the background  wasn't brown.

4CyXKudJaa	Yes, lots of people find short hair attractive, Alyssa Milano had hair that short and look how many guys are into her... and look at how many guys are into Hallie Berry too. You got nothing to worry about, lol, seriously! It depends mostly on the shape of your face and the style in which it is cut. Try rough it up a little, especially around the face. A little like this:    http://www.myhaircuts.com/shorthaircuts2...    Yours might be shorter, but you get the idea =)|`|DlNiU2kKaa	Short hair isn't ugly but it depends how it is cut.

Look for styles that are banded around the midriff and can be tied in back and around the neck. This style will give you some lift and will allow you to make adjustments for a personal fit.      * Look for one-piece swimsuits with some structure in the bust, such as soft foam cups or at least, a shelf bra. Straight cut bust styles such as a classic tank can look clean and sporty. Wide shoulder straps will also be much more comfortable than thin, spaghetti straps.      * Avoid strapless bandeau tops and those tiny, tri-tops that offer minimal coverage. Again, make sure to get a suit where you can order the top and bottom sizes separately.|`|QmWzBERjaa	All the guy at my school would go crazy over you. Haha.

Donate clothes you haven't worn in years - don't keep it in hopes you'll fit into them someday    2. Clothes that are too worn for donation, throw away or keep a few as "at home comfort clothes"    3. Buy 2-3 new clothing item to update that you have - don't buy an entire wardrobe ful at once - you want to have a bit of stuff as new seasons of clothes comes out to get a variety of styles and colours    Doing this will allow you to bit by bit change your wardrobe without breaking your bank.  And as time passes and you get more items, donate the older clothes you don't wear.      Pick out some nice skirts, dress pants, blouse, blazer/wrap seaters or cardigans     A nice tank top or dressier top is nice to have - wear it with a cardigan or wrap sweater during the day and take it off and add some extra jewelry/make up for a night out with friends or for a party that's easy to put together when you don't have time to stop at home and change    It's all about layering - not too much that you feel bulky, but enough that you can take off/put on something to change the look or style when you're pressed for time.    Hope that helps.|`|WU4rofutaa	Why don't u try wearing sari to college!!|`|7QTXV0Jkaa	Jeans n tops are the best for college since they are more comfy!|`|7qLDe5braa	A long term and valuable advice, that too free of cost -                          very simple, donate all but 2 of ur clothes to poor most likely to slumdogs (may b they can become millionaires in the process).  u will b having only 2 clothes to wear, since u wont use same cloth on consecutive days so u wud alter them. This wud reduce ur stress and confusion of selection hence u can concentrate 2wards something constructive and more importantly save the public from such torturous questions.  wont dat b gr8?????????  :)|`|GwYJNwHWaa	mix n match is the most easy thing 2 do. as it is nowadays colour combinations are the most weirdest n contrast so anything goes with everything.  also layering is quite in so if u hv dresses - teem them with skinny jeans n tees, it luks gr8.  accessories also make a big impression, big chunky belts, non matching bags and glares make the look complete..  hope i helped!|`|uoCNYm1Waa	Stop worrying about which clothes to wear to college.

CtHi5L78aa	honestly not going to cost you under 1,000 and thats cheap   and only for half a headso if you want them long or more than one color and if you want a full head its going to be way more than that its not worth it it ruins hair so just grow it i know it sucks but its not worth it and permanent is only about 6  months,

dPsaYMOvaa	I swear by GHD. Not only do they last forever (had mine 3 years and still works like new) they are durable, light and easily portable. You can also curl and wave with them. They straighten hair really well and quickly and it keeps straight, unlike some others.|`|zkR4IUa8aa	GHD! It's fantastic.|`|2diobki7aa	I say the Sedu. I have one, and it works great. I bought it from folica.com, and it cost me about $115. BUT it got to my house by the next day! =] I've had my Sedu over a year now, and it's the best straightener I've ever used.

DQOIf98faa	Vaseline doesn't make them grow but it helps to condition your eyelashes. So in the end it aids in the process of growth.|`|Tj94JEMJaa	vaseline don't work, curling them or putting on volume mascara will help!|`|XV7QHjPFaa	Putting anything on your eyelashes won't make them grow any longer. The reason your eyelashes are the way they are is by the thickness/weight of your lashes and the strength of your hair follicles. If you make your lashes any heavier/longer, they will fall out. Of course they'll regrow, but it will look odd while they are growing out.|`|HCudI2O8aa	Vaseline?! no not true! theres only 3 ways your eyelashes will appear longer, mascara, simply curling them, or fake lashes. all those other methods are false. and please DON'T try trimming your lashes. My friend had an awful experience!!! Good Luck! :]

Piercings, tattoos, and random hair colors have all been around for a long time, so I don't think anything "new" will pop out and fall under that category of however those are categorized.
X95BHGDcaa	Hey there!  There are many fun, new ways to do your hair especially if it is medium length.     ->One way is to do wavy curls with a pretty, feminine headband.  If you're hair is naturally curly/messy wavy like mine, you can easily define them my scrunching a golf-ball size amount of Herbal Essences Totally Twisted Curl Boosting Mousse into damp hair.  Towel dry your hair thoroughly before scrunching the mousse in.  Then, blow dry your hair with a diffuser.  Place your feminine headband in decoratively to finish off the look.    ->Another way is curling your hair with your straightener.  Clamp the flat-iron down near the end of a two in section of hair, and wind your hair around it twice in a spiral shape.  Hold it in place for about 10 seconds, then slide the iron slowly from the spiral.  Once you have gone all the way around your head, finish it off with a light mist of hairspray.    ->Lastly, you can do a pretty ponytail.  Pull your hair messily back into a high ponytail.  It doesn't really matter if there are bunches of lumps or anything, it will still look put together.  Finish this look off with a pretty clib or hairband to tie your hair up with.    Hope I helped!|`|zY6WXobEaa	okay for a perfect do all ya have to do are these easy steps...  1. put the top layer of your hair in a very very loose ponytail (loose i mean seriously loose like an inch from the end of your hair)  2. then twist the ponytail inward(it kinda feels the way a shell looks on the outside when your twisting it)    3. clip it on the inside with a small/medium sized clip  4. The End now you have a movie star bump!!!|`|2404nDvSaa	ditto|`|VKLdqnpBaa	loose/messy bun  half up half down  twists  two braids  sock bun  bump

4nKP3cWGaa	Uh .. like 99% of the world has that. It just happens when you sit funny. Get up and walk around your house and it'll be gone in no time.|`|aV0QmAOtaa	It's def. your belly. Maybe you don't notice it or maybe it's just the way you sit. I don't have a big belly or anything, but that happens to me too after sitting a certain way after a while.

oX9hnJV1aa	I know one person who has tried it.... didn't work..I spent 12 hours doing a cover-up and had plenty of time / opportunity to see how effective three sessions were...... nada! I think a loing time ago they called this stuff.... "Snake Oil". There is another kind of snake oil fading cream called "Tat-B-Gone" years ago I called one of my longtime suppliers in NY and asked him about it.... he hung up on me! No kidding! A few hours later I got my answer... the stuff is "injected" like tattoo ink.. it hardens and binds with some of the pigment and eventually works it way out of the skin like splinters and glass do... he was NOT impressed. Havent heard whether or not it actually works tho.  Best of luck...|`|YXXvhDLWaa	From what I've heard all wrecking balm does is lighten the skin around it. Laser surgery is the only way to really get rid of a tattoo|`|kclpa0Abaa	Nope.    Get something done over it or laser it off.

I tried that once and got casseroled.|`|AOBEkqzXaa	Like most places, they would probably require you either exchange it for something of the same price OR get the refund with an Aero gift card. I doubt they would hand you cash.|`|pp8xZebGaa	If it still has the tags, then yes. You just cant get cash for it.|`|uKSsXz2iaa	No!|`|ePUfgfwRaa	yes, they will let you exchange your clothes with tags but you just can't get your money back. Hope that helps =]

I don't have one but I know a girl who does and she hates it.|`|AA11285960	big booties are good if your waist is small (which it sounds like yours is).

VG2NYjTbaa	I can't wait for my sweet 16, I'm only 15 though. haha. :)   When you said it would be a full moon, I immediately thought silver or white! Honestly any pale color would look gorgeous with the light. Maybe even something like lavender? :) I say go for a short dress! But I've always had problems with looking for long dresses because I can never find the perfect length.. so it's really your decision. But I would check the  weather forecast before hand.   I would also leave your hair down, and curled. That would look stunning.  something like this :   http://www.blog-city.info/en/img4/4878_5...    Ashley's hair. I know she's not the best example, but I do happen to like her hair in that picture. :)
YOVsbP4daa	Get a VOIP system for the internet. I know I developed a stutter from playing online games and only communicating via typing, but once I joined a group that used VOIP (voice over IP), I regained speaking confidence =)|`|B4a6tWmcaa	start practicing in a mirror think about questions people ask often and respond to them by talking to yourself...read articles on communicating|`|3seIFRNVaa	Hmm.. Perhaps you could try reading a book out loud.. That should help with your speech problem. As for the girl issue. they aren't as scary as you think. Just talk to people weither its someone in the grocery store or the cute girl you sit next to.. Everyone is just a person.. nothing more and nothing less.. theres nothing to fear. so go out there with a smile on your face. its infectious. I bet you anything people will smile back.. Hope some of these tips help!
RdRsQsiQaa	Mmm... The White Stripes     Anyways, the facial hair will suit you very well!  & the hair will too.  Of course, it'll take a while to grow it out but in the end, it would look very cute & sexy.|`|AcKNABixaa	at first sight i was thinking, that u look more attractive in ur own photo...  but after i changed my mind...  because u are young,and long hairs will not put u 2much age, it will only make u more sexy, hot and "wild"... ur hairs is naturally dark, so u will look much better than that man...  100% do this, im shure u will look great!!!!|`|afkygHMgaa	Yes.....very hot|`|QFrPpfr0aa	Go for it (:  It'd look hott.  |`|4UQegWk0aa	No, you're hot enough as you are.    That facial hair isn't a good idea for anyone, but it's worse for you. It makes you look like speedy gonzales.    As I said, you look hot as you are.
bITTzzcVaa	I dont suggest you getting it on your lower back because there are about 758,934,247,901,239 other girls who have a tatto on their lower back. Its commonly known as the "tramp stamp" so unless you want that title, choose a different location.    Once you design one, print it out in the ACTUAL size you want it to be on your body. Bring it to the tattoo place, they will transfer it or sketch up a replica and use that. They usually dont charge extra for that unless its a pretty big tattoo then they might charge you for the amount of time it took to sketch.     For example, my small breast cancer ribbon tattoo was designed by me and it didnt cost any more than a normal tattoo. But my husbands tattoo that he designed required a few hours of work so the sketch time for his tattoo was included in the hourly cost.    If you get it on your lower back, you WILL regret it when you see a nasty girl with one in the same place. TRUST ME|`|VNMkhFXiaa	can you put up an image of the tatoo design u have so far?|`|0hJacvb9aa	well im 13 and 2 out of my 3 tattoos have been drawn by myself.  and no, it shouldn't cost more then normal tattoos.  just make sure that's what you want. take a few days overlooking it and correcting mistakes that you didn't notice before.  or else when you look at your tattoo you'll be like "huh, when was that there? or, i should have fixed that"  and make sure you go to a good and experienced artist, my second tat was on my wrist of the outline of 3 birds, and it could have been better. but dont get me wrong, i still love it.|`|dukLaAb0aa	It is not possible for a 13 year old to get a tatto as it is illegal for anyone under 18 to get a tattoo done :l (unless it was in your dream).  Anyway i agree with Hillary it is know as the tramp stamp.... what about accross your sholders (if it has to be on your back).  Anyway it will not cost you more if you take in your design,  They will scetch it out and if you want anything to be improved or changed they will do it for no extra cost :l  But remember a tattoo is for life so think about it hard before you do get it, depending on where you get it , It may affect you getting a job D:  Anyway i have designed my own its a heart (a relistic one not any of this   It would be a top sleeve if i do get it done the gy at the tatto parlor said it will cost from 900-2000 depending on how long it takes to e inked :o  but yeah i dont think i will get it done as i will be in the air force within this year and the tatto will affect my application gravely D:    Good luck with the tatto :D|`|piIixlJdaa	your 13 and you have 3 tattoos wtf??

I'd also try the big department stores debenhams, selfridges etc.. because they have such a wide  range of stuff. Someone mentioned TK Maxx, which is a good idea too (a couple of my friends got really nice dresses from there for our prom) as they change their stock so often you are likely to end up with the same dress as someone else.

If you had to pay more then the little kids would be paid more, so the primark wouldn'tnecessarilyy need to close, just charge more.|`|ApygviDDaa	The problem with primark.. is that everbody buys from there making us more similar.,. i buy my essential things from the like: hairbands, tights, socks and plain tops.. and sometimes jeans.. but if you buy things that are really individual to primark or that are realy noticiable that you have seen in there then you know its from primark.|`|QJN8JfgDaa	primark always have cheap, decent clothes. But I wonder why that is(cheap labour costs for primark)|`|kPmzj4Rcaa	I don't buy from primark, i think it's cheap and it's tacky - and if those kids are making them, it's not right. I think that if everyone did stop buying from primark, the children wouldn't die 'cause maybe some action would then be taken, if people realized what happened :].|`|fzzhIsRVaa	im not too keen on Primark clothes , although i love there summer dresses , summer shoes , jewellery , bags , knickers , and also their basic tees. i dont reallly like the fit of the jeans or the tops.  but yeahh i love primark ;)|`|0798e85ae83031c2f06413c87fd4fc79aa	Good Q !!    I work in this industry.... so have a slightly better insight than most.    Most of the comments are totally correct - many other big retailers use similar sources.  Kids in these so-called third world countries are exploited to get garments made cheaper, and therefore can be sold to the public at cheaper prices.    Primark got caught.  The others are lucky.    Child Labour is a very touchy subject.... but what are the options ?    Yes, i totally agree, that the use of child labour should be banned.  All of the clothing that i manufacture comes from fully regulated factories, that do not employ any under-age workers.  But what are the options for the children in the factories that use them.  If they are forced out of work, where do they go ?  Begging in the streets to feed themselves ?  Or worse.... child prostitution ? God forbid.    It is ETHICALLY wrong to use children as labour.  But the bigger question is.... is it MORALLY wrong ?    These kids have a job, and are bringing in money to poor families, in countries where their Governments cannot / will not help them.    This is a debate that has been around for many years, and will continue to be around for many years to come.    Good Question though.|`|cVeFGVNVaa	for those who says primark is cheap and tacky lol bet u couldnt look as good as i realli take ya snob selves to top shop river island bt that **** will onli jus shrink in the wash. primark thumbs up going magaluf in july and they already have a wicked cheap selection of holiday clothes. id model primark clothes oh i do.|`|05c4dc40d8d1266511243907a84331c7aa	I didn't know they got kids to make their clothes.They're a handy shop though and in this economic climate I don't have the choice to be fussy!|`|CQ9e1X1caa	Every as its own Industry has its own world, some fashion industry has mass production of factories and people pay loads for it,  Primark industry has a very low key industry, based in 3rd world countries. They make a living which seems low to us but thats their industry, without the factory where hey make clothes the small society does not have any source of money to live.  But yes i do agree with the factors that children and women are paid less than a few Pounds everytime, and i do believe that some apeals can help with their standards of working to improve their lifestyles.  I wouldnt stop shopping at Primark, especially during ressession where cuts in jobs are increasing and people need basic clothes. Cheap clothes, save money, survive credit crunch.    That my opinion :) hope i helped.
idhcqr5Daa	Burn 2 or 3 cigarettes. If you are not a smoker, please do not start. Even if you do smoke, DON'T SMOKE THE CIGARETTES. Burn the cigarettes without exposing yourself to the smoke, or get the ashes from an ashtray.   Collect the ashes in the ashtray and separate them from the cigarette butt.   Get a cotton ball or disc and make it slightly wet.   Dip the cotton into the cigarette ashes.   Rub the areas of the skin that have hair dye stains.   Clean your face with water and/or cleanser.   But before trying cigarette ashes, try using some Purell. Just rub the purell into the stains and wipe off. Works wonders. For areas close to your eyes, use a q-tip.   Or you could rub honey all over your face, and leave it there for 2 hours, then rinse with extra virgin olive oil, it does wonders and it smoothes your skin.   8. You also could rub some make-up remover like New liquid Almay.    Just put some make-up remover on a q-tip and apply to stained area   9. If all else fails, nail polish remover/ rubbing alcohol works!    It can dry out your face, and give you flaky skin.   This method comes from a very well-known hairdressing salon, but don't tell anyone. Picky salon clients might never come back. If you are a hairdresser, hide the ashes!   Use preventative measures, apply a thin layer of vasoline around your face at the hair line before coloring. Or, for less mess, buy a barrier product like Repelle Hair Color Stain Shield in the consumer market or any of a number of barrier lotions at beauty supply stores.   If ashes aren't your thing, try spraying some hairspray(the one from the can bottle) on your skin and rubbing it away with a soft cloth before it has time to dry. Careful not to get any in your eyes.   Smoking is not good for your health.   honey is sticky so it may stick to stuff so be careful.   don't get ashes in your eyes, its very painful   Lotions work too: just rub lotion on you face before you colour your hair and afterwards: this helps too when you made stains on your skin with nail polish     x0x0_LEi|`|SetyQexoaa	Use a color stain remover. Which also can be applied to the skin before coloring to prevent this problem, and before you shampoo the color out  next time use a little bit of the color that's on your hair and rub all areas of skin where the color has come in contact with. The rule of color is (color removes color).|`|5PVFXry8aa	Rubbing alcohol works really well!|`|DsgNMpEsaa	Usually I just shower. For me it takes about 3 showers. :]|`|R3NbFHqkaa	baby oil!|`|vwoqIUR6aa	use a little soap and warm water on a wash cloth, rub gently, you could also moisturize your skin with some oil and wash your face.|`|zzPOffFtaa	aw haha been there.    Vaseline all over the places that it needs it then rub with soap and water.   And next time you dye your hair put vaseline all over around your forehead, neck and ears and then if you get any on you it will just rub right off. :]

Jessica Simpson is also in the D range and hers are natural... so its more of ... fake vs. real because if yours are not natural then of course they will look like the first 2.     If your looking to get a boob job and your a small girl i would stick maybe to a c cup. C implants usually look the most natural.|`|dAK8dS4kaa	Well I want Jessica Simpson..I think medium is good. Just the right size.

I think it used to be that models starved themselves to get the "heroine-sheek" look, but nowadays models prefer to eat and exercise, especially the Victoria Secret models. You can tell that they eat and exercise because they actually have cleavage instead of AA boobs.

07b1ac6e5ed7918e645f06b4a299eaa6aa	It depends on the quality of the hair, the type of extensions you get, how well you keep it up and who puts them in.  1 ALWAYS go to a reputable hair stylist who is experienced in hair extension.  Don't be cheap and let your girl 'round the way do them!   2 If you can afford it, opt for sew in styles.  Your hair is braided in plaits and the extensions are sewed in by "tracks".  It lasts longer, looks better, and is much better for your hair than glue.   3 Again, if you can afford it ALWAYS (I repeat) Always get human hair.  It is much easier to maintain and is styled exactly as you would your own hair (heat, wash, etc) synthetic hair will burn when heat is applied to it.  Also synthetic hair will tangle and actually cut through your own hair making it easy to break and fall out.  4 always wrap your hair up at night with some type of satin wrap, bonnet, etc.  This is true even for your own hair minus the extensions.  Cotton is the enemy of African American (even Caucasian!) hair at night.  It cause the hair to break and fall out.  Buy a satin pillow case to sleep on at night as well!     But to simply answer your initial question...if all these protocols are followed you can make your tracks/extensions last up to 2 1/2 months while still maintaining a healthy head of "natural" hair underneath!  Happy hair days!|`|AA10813849	don't keep it in for too long because your hair needs to breathe, especially if you plan on growing out your hair  if your just putting a full weave, i suggest no more than two weeks or else it will start to look sloppy looking and it will look stupid|`|AA10925719	Well don't mess them up when they are in your head. But I really don't think tracks are the solution. Because that glue in your hair is not good for your scalp.      I think you should let your natural hair grow first. Becasue over 10,000 people are becoming bald  Just because they put tracks, weave in their heads.  So good Luck And think about putting that in your head.  This goes for all women, Girls. You don't need tracks to   make  you feel beautiful.|`|AA10380051	I met a lady yesterday who belived that dirt helped your hair grow. And she just kept putting tracks in dirty hair. I think it's your personal perference about how long you keep your tracts in, when your hair begins to itch or your tracts start lookin raggidy its tiem to go. If you already have nice hair i don't see the point of adding them extensions. Basically tou are trying to look like a white woman with long straight hair while they are hating on us but trying to look like us from getting them tans. You are also patronizing the Asians by buying these produx from them do lets try to keep it natural.|`|4dda09f2b5e7b9fc9b4344b4736f7815aa	you can leave them in for up to 3 months, but u can start seeing the re-growth pretty bad after 6 weeks, thats when i took mine out they started to look untidy

9z0dzBjAaa	do you tease your hair often?  i have that problem to when i do! or do the knots happen in the morning or when you wake up?     To get the knots out just put conditioner on your hair, let it sit, then start to comb it out gently with a wide tooth comb.    FIRST - stop brushing your hair all the time! It can be damaging! Only brush after shower (preferably when your hair is dry so hair isn't likely to snap and break off)...    SECOND - find a good conditioner. Redken, Aveda,  products like these are good for your hair.    THIRD - Find a detangler, spray it in your hair before you comb it in the morning.    FOURTH - get a WIDE tooth comb. DON'T .. i repeat.. DON'T get those paddle brushes.. you know, the round ones? Get the wide tooth combs because it helps with knots and tangles.    FIFTH - once a week, put olive oil in your hair for 15 minutes, then rinse with shampoo, and conditioner. It'll help your hair to be silky, shiny, and less knotty.|`|n2hgJlPtaa	ok take the knot and put alot of conditioner on it soak it k leave it n and very gently try and brusr through it it will come out sooner or later if not you might have to cut it out.|`|LMITI1I3aa	use a hunk of conditioner!|`|gd04gY55aa	try detangaling spray  lots of conditioner  and comb it     and if that doesnt work then i guess cut it|`|AA11282101	i feel your pain.. literally. ive had that problem before, the best thing to do and this is what works for me as im tenderheaded too, i get in the shower, wash and then condition my hair, and work the knots out with my fingers starting at the base. then rinse out the conditioner and re condition. oh, and maybe put your hair in a ponytail at night? thats what i do also. i can brush my hair alot and it still happens every now and then. try using a smoother like gariner fructis(not sure of spelling) spray conditioner. or using a sraighting iron hepls smooth it out too.|`|eJsR7BZvaa	Put a big glob of conditioner on your hair and start combing it out gently with a medium-tooth comb. Stick the prongs of the comb into the knot and GENTLY pull downward. Comb from the bottom of the knot to the top. Have patience and relax. It'll come loose.  Good luck!|`|iHub3X6Gaa	Scissors ;0)|`|lYgFyjw0aa	conditioner & a comb.|`|FqcvXnybaa	take a shower then try.
KZGGozvTaa	OMG! They are so sexy! I love the stiletto heels! Where did you get them?     As for scaring the boys it depends if your already tall... some might find you a little bit intimidating with your killer heels, lol     But in my opinion you look gorgeous! You totally rock them!|`|HasE11Wfaa	I don't think so. . You look like you're 5"4' or so and probably stand 5"8" in heels.  Boys usually get intimidated by tall women.  I'm about 5"11" and I wear 5 to 6 inch heels.  I stand about 6"2 to 6"3.  I do find some guys get intimidated by me|`|c5jiUDm2aa	lol, depends who you're going to kill with them.  Seriously, they look great.
jWmnSXlLaa	It depends on your body shape. I bought a few pair and got home and realized I looked like a fat cow. They made my legs look huge.
aOYZ7kcMaa	Because when your sunburn is red it means that your skin is irritated and hot. It then goes into a tan because the skin cells are dead from sun exposure. After a while your tan usually fades and this is because your cells are being renewed and they are healthy.  Some parts of your body are more sensitive to UV than others so this is why some parts of your body tan easier than others.
fE1KEqCsaa	Get an ice cube and hold it to the spot/blemish/pimple for a few seconds until the swelling and size has gone down.    Avoid touching your face a lot and touching the pimple.|`|0PsnnVb6aa	avoid touching your face anywhere and especially the pimples...wash your face with cold water and avoid oil for some days...|`|W86sginbaa	a good diet rich in fruits, green veggies, milk products will help....have lots of water...don't get constipated!  Work out if you can...fr 20 min 4 days a week! cut on oily and junk food.  lead a healthy and happy life! Enjoy!|`|7eb7aaeaeb2605f8c5386e9f16f71e85aa	Your skin quality depends to a large extent on diet and lifestyle. Ensure to have four to five helpings of fresh fruits and vegetables each day. Exercise regularly for at least thirty minutes. Ensure to keep your skin clean throughout the day by splashing cold water three to four times a day.

idhcqr5Daa	Choose where you are going to shave your legs--in the bathtub, where only your legs will get wet, or during a shower.      For the bathtub, turn on the bath water to a comfortable temperature. Spread a towel out on the side of the bathtub where you will sit.   Shave during the shower if you are pressed for time and once you are comfortable shaving your legs. Although you are standing up, the water rubs the hairs straight off so you can see where there are still hairs.      Make sure the water is not too hot.Wet a sharp razor and your legs with warm, not hot, water. Heat will relax the hair follicles, making them easier to shave.      Lather well.Lather shaving gel or soap on your legs, front and back, lather it as far up as you want to shave. You can also use soap, but shaving cream is a better idea!      Be careful with the razor.Slide the razor down your legs very lightly to avoid ingrown hairs. Be sure to go slow if this is your first time. If you go too fast with an unsteady hand, you will be sure to get cuts and nicks on your legs. Rinse the razor between strokes. Repeat. Start at the front of your leg and slowly work around, going back over the area more than once to make sure you don't leave any hairs behind. Put on more gel if necessary.   Rinse your razor for next time, or else it'll soon be useless. To keep your razor clean and sharp, store it in a cup of hydrogen peroxide.   Pat dry with a towel.   Apply lotion to your legs to moisturize and ward off razor burn.   The first few times you shave, go very easy with the pressure until you get used to exactly what it takes. If you press too hard, you'll cut yourself, so be easy. Start out light, and when/if you realize it's not working, you can press a little harder.   Take special care when shaving the knees.   Wash out the tub when you're done - don't leave a hairy mess behind.   Don't use an electric razor when starting out. You will get nicks and razor burns.   You'll get best results with a new, sharp razor - change them frequently.   Rubbing an ice cube on your legs right after shaving will make them as smooth as glass.   If you want smooth legs but can't get to a shower/tub, try covering your legs with a thick coat of lotion and then shaving it off for a very smooth shave. Rinse out the lotion and hair from the razor in a cup of water or wipe it on a cloth.   Once you've been shaving for a while, a razor with built in shave bars is a great way to shave armpits and legs, minus the shave gel! This is a great way to save money as well.   Conditioner is a great replacement for shaving cream/gel because it moisturizes while you shave, so no need for lotion after.   Use razors meant for women, even though you have to replace them more often. Men have much coarser hair than women, so using a men's razor is a bad idea.   If you are uneasy about razors or are worried about getting "nicked", you could go out and purchase Nair or Veet. (These require razorless blades, leave your legs smoother and last a lot longer than regular shaving.)   Do not shave dry.   Go around bruises and cuts, and be light, as to avoid nicks and razor burns.   Be light on the knees, ankles, shins, and other "bony" parts of your body to avoid cutting the top layer of skin.   If you have sensitive skin you just want to use a gentle soap instead of shaving gel to avoid irritation    x0x0_LEi|`|04a4824f734643fd0c6adefd032a1af8aa	maybe you need more meat, it may be veins.
qQqC2cHIaa	Interesting question with a mysterious answer.  If it seems as if everyone is using the same colours, it's because they are!  Colour forecasts are released by the Pantone company two to three years in advance and everyone in the design field subscribes to their service.  This includes graphic designers, interior designers, architects, fashion designers, fabric and textile designers.  Pantone has a huge research department and they scour all the trend setting centers of the world, from couture fashion to underground street graphics to find colours that are appealing.  They quantify and standardize the colour and give it a unique number. Many in the design field follow their colour number system.  Why?  because then things match and it's easy to communicate a colour.  If I need zippers and button to match the wool I'm using for a coat, rather than say I need three hundred button in pale teal that shades closer to blue but lighter I say I need three hundred buttons in pantone 18-4545 dusty teal.    Also, in design school you learn about colour and colour theory.  Designers: fashion, graphic, industrial, interior -all know how to mix colours from the basic three primaries plus black and white tints and shades, warm and cold tones.  By playing with mixing sometimes someone hits on something new and has fabrics or plastics or paint or whatever made in this colour.  Then everyone copies it.    colour in design is quite complex.    Pantone's colour of the year 2009 is mimosa: http://www.pantone.com/pages/pantone/pan...  here's the main site: http://www.pantone.com/pages/pantone/ind...|`|rE5JEJ92aa	Those people are just rich ugmos that act as if they know what they are talking about.

They aren't too OTT at all.    Instead of the plain white jumper, I think you should wear a graphic t-shirt under them. The grey cardi will make the outfit seem more casual, so that's good.    Also agree that brown boots won't go (brown+black=:/). Black pumps or black boots would look fine though.    Hope i helped! xx|`|JUvVUlq8aa	That sounds fine.  and get some of them flats.  and maybe with a long cardigan - they do them in there, i saw them when i was in oxford.  also, add a big bag and your done.    and, you can then make it a night outfit by adding heels and a silky blouse, and swap the big bag for a clutch!

SKII has an airbrush foundation (which is about 65)     I also heard Christian Dior recently brought out a really good foundation called sth Nude.It's be worth checking it out.    *****TIP: only put foundation on the areas of your face that need coverage (eg eneven skin tone,redness etc), this way you'll more natural & not so cakey, which gives a more radiant look.|`|646fe42a895447edfec28e3ca8106fa2aa	Chanel liquid foundation is amazing and looks very natural.|`|5589fbd695adfa2721fe85c5288a8fb9aa	there is a stage/film foundation from Kryolan its really nice and gives a flawless look     http://www.fxsupply.com/kryolan_catalog/...     the liquid one is the one i use!|`|yRihCgxaaa	Use vasaline before you apply foundation.|`|o0Luxonpaa	mineral make up lasts all day x|`|PSWFAVthaa	Rimmel Mousse|`|o9CAQMaYaa	estee lauder double wear foundation, u can get a colour match if u go to the counter and free samples, it last for 16 hours!|`|e4bfc4b7ae9cb835e6e24d9e4a6b9004aa	I use L'oreal Infallible foundation, it lasts ups to 16 hours, isn't very expensive and works a treat.

f7fa5ed1dd3bdd7594932db93b423b39aa	I have never had weave either but I know a thing or two about it.  If your hair is a good length then you should get weave that is like the same length as your hair and use it for thickness.  It should definitely look natural (same color) and if you should curl it with loose curls so it's not straight and dull looking.  I fyou can you should have your own hair in the front as like a swooping bang.  My cousin did that and hers looked very natural.  Our family that we haven't seen in a while thought it was her real hair.

Most of them are used by spraying the section of hair you have in your hand to straighten, then you run the straigtner through it. It always sizzles, and I'm sure it's terrible for your hair, but hey that's what irons are all about. It works really well, and makes your hair set perfectly and when you're finished, if you run a brush through it, a good spray will keep your hair really soft.

Tommy Hilfiger is more preppy than classic.  Preppy clothes tend to be expensive.  If you are looking for preppy clothes, try: Ralph Lauren, Tommy Hilfiger, Pringle of Scotland, Lacoste, J.

If it is 4 or under, then you basically just chop that number off. If it is five to nine, then you make the first decimal one higher then cut the second off.

Anyway , I had a yellow undertone when I was younger , I started using Fair and Lovely 2 times a day and every week I use honey and sugar as a scrub. It makes the skin glow .. and now replacing the yellow tone , I have a pinkish tone. It will help .. try it. An if you want to get rid of bacteria , use lemon juice. Very natural and works.

Also one extra note, I've read that on the real bag the seam is never right on the LV.  That is, they never break up the LV logo where the canvas is sewn together or on the edge.  And it's totally real for the upside down lettering on the speedy bag.   I go by the overall look of the person holding the bag too.|`|AA11585663	kimtraut does have a good answer but it does sound a lot like my other answers when I answered several similar questions like these. To add to "her" answer. The LV can somtimes be cut off because of the design of the bag. And yes LV bags do have upside down LV's. But I don't know why people use this to answer these kinds of questions because only a few bags actually follow this. Speedy, Keepall, and Papillon. These are more but those are the popular ones. I reall don't feel like typing my answer again because I have answer a question like thise about 50 times. Just look for a question that's like this I most likely answered if with great detail.

3a15a185741af8118978069daa9d695daa	First, it sounds like an infection babe. To know for sure, go to a cosmetologist, preferably a nail tech. Cosmetologist are trained to see if that might be an infection ( it's in our books babe!) If it is, talk to your doctor about treatment options. There are many different products that might help you. However, it may be a lack of vitamins. As silly as it may sound, prenatal vitamins are awsome for this sort of thing. There is also another vitamin product called Hair, Skin, and Nails that should be close to the prenatal vitamins. It works just as well. You may need to see your doc and have some blood tests done though to see if you are getting the proper vitamins in you diet. As for the strenghening part, try buying some Sally Hanson's Strong as Nails nail polish. It's just a clear coat, but will help keep your nails strong. Make sure to take it off every 2 to 3 days though. A lot of people have trouble with yellowing if you leave nail polish on your nails for too long.

Good luck Kim and wish long, shiny and lovely hair.|`|6be2cbfbb2702efaaac53f193f81f26eaa	No.  When you braid your hair, it is easier for you to tell how much your hair has grown.  This makes you think that it goes faster but is not the case.     Hair growth has to do with the health of you hair follicles.  They are located in the skin of your head.|`|AA10323420	No, it's not true.  Vitamin E is good for your hair, and vitamin fortified shampoos, but there is not much one can do to make their hair grow faster than normal.|`|AA11126575	yes it can with your natural hair. and make sure your hair is not braided tight.  any type of natural due is best for your hair|`|62d5b59b7fcd3c6cc47e82670d4588e3aa	It isn't good for your hair! lol your hair will go in split ends!

AA10841601	They are not only slutty, but low class as well.  They require people to have serious ink and piercings.  If you have those, then look at the name and what the producers regard you as:  someone who believes in her own self-destruction.  While I am sure that's not how you see yourself, being around or near people who would promote you as someone like that is certainly not a good thing for you.    But if the money is good, and you can get over the stigma, well then, hey, go for it.  Just remember that these producers are not your friends, and that the title of their product is your best evidence of that.|`|0d90f8bcb599aeb99a715d23db525934aa	never heard about it??...send me some info|`|AA11182656	Why?

It could be a good starting point for a modeling career.  But then again, if you think those pictures may come back to haunt you you might want to reconsider.

I've used it after doing flattops that wouldn't stand up and after they weren't going anywhere.    I work at a Regis salon and know you can get it there (at all Regis company salons...Mia and Maxx, Master Cuts, Trade Secrets, Super Cuts.....) I believe it's $17.95.  It'll last forever    I like the American Crew products...there's a wide assortment so you can go for light hold to stiff hold.  They're about $16.95  Same stores    Both products smell like boy so you don't have to smell like a girl (all flowery)    Hope I helped you    By the way...if you buy at a salon, they are guaranteed so you can return them if you find you don't like them.

I'm the one who told you to try hair wax, scultping gel, or scultping wax, etc.     Different products use different names. Just look in the hair product aisle at wal-mart, target, meijers, sally's beauty salon, k-mart, or any typical big store. If you can't find something for a man, it's ok to use a product for womens hair. They do have lots of products out for men now though.     Be careful around cigarettes or flames if you start using hair products. They usually are very flammable.     Prices should range from $.99 to $5.00 and up. Go with the mid range $3 - $5 product. You want something that will stiffen your hair, mold it, or mold it and stay soft. They come in all styles that range from making your hair stiff as a board, to manageable yet still soft. Use a blow dryer to blow the damp hair back away from your forehead (or in the direction you want it to go) while you have the hair gel/wax in it. This helps set it in place.     Then spritz some hairspray on for extra holding power if you need it.|`|43c3a16e0d07b3839c6fc241979f1349aa	paul mitchell wax works is amazing. definitely the best that i've encountered. o...and its about $15 and it can be purchased at any beauty supply and some drug stores! :)
53969a0cb23a6348a0354399347b8b7baa	Stretch marks don't just come from having kids or being fat. They can be hereditary. You get them as your muscles stretch or shrink. Many things cause them.  There is no way to cure them. You can help prevent them. Tryputting cocoa butter on after you shower to lock in moisture. This helping the elasticity of your skin.  For existing stretch marks and scars of any kind, there is an inexpencive over the counter product called Mederma. It works great for lightening up the red marks to a faint white.     However, stretch marks aren't something you should worry about. But if you are, try simple things, don't waste money on expencive things promising magical results. My dermatologist said there is NOTHING perscribed or over the counter that cures existing stretch marks completely. Prevention is the only cure. He said remember this: "Your a real women and all women have flaws. Be happy in your skin. Just remember the butts you see on the covers of magazines are airbrushed. Those girls have them too!

Sobre a cirurgia, j me informei com um mdico dermatologista que disse que a sudorese ir se intensificar em outras regi?es. Para falar a verdade prefiro ficar assim mesmo, j pensou como seria come?ar a suar da mesma forma na rea das ndegas, costas, seios, rosto...???? Seria muito pior!!!  Boa sorte pra voc e se conseguir resolver o problema me avise por favor!!

99b688e76b75f46b8a5d14d59066d8b5aa	Try some natural remedies that you  can make at home. For example, lemon juice lightens your skin. You can try rubbing a half of a lemon on your face twice a week and keep it on for 15 minutes then wash it off. Also, you can try Oxy-Bleach which you should be able to get at any departmental store. It helps lighten skin as you bleach, PLUS it lightens your facial hair if you have any.    Also, for tans, you can rub a slice of tomato on your tan, but this you got to do for an entire month, everyday, and though it works, I personally don't like it coz I don't like tomatoes.    Remember, be patient, coz these are natural remedies, and it takes time to work.    Also, look at other natural recipes at http://www.beauty-tips.com  Hope it helps.  GoodLuck!|`|9005fecd3443236300a712a04af60cc9aa	i dont know your race but regardless sun damage shows up years later.i would guess you havent been using sun screen faithfully.what you need to do and this is the best (other than laser and other expensive in office treatment)is get Retin A or tretinoin .its the same thing. Retin A is just a brand name.i ll advise you to get a dermatologists opinion first.( use a good sunscreen in conjuntion from now onwards even for one minute of sun exposure).what this Retin A will do is remove all the damaged skin and make your skin behave healthy.your skin will be so radiant you wont believe it.it will work on the hyperpigmentaion you are concerned about beautifully but you have to be very patient.i should mention its very drying.quite unpleasant in the begining but its worth it.its also used for wrinkles and acne.this is not a cosmetic its a drug it really does what its specified for.its a prescription but you can get it on the net with no prescription avoid it if you are pregnant or planning to get pregnant.go see a doctor skin lighteners like kojic acid and hydroquinone will lighten the skin but they wont treat it  and if you do not use a sunscreen with either of these you will notice you'll get dark and end up even darker than you originally were.so the most important thing for you to understand is that sunsreen is very important in order to get maximum positive results with all these products even Retin A.  I HOPE I'VE BEEN OF SOME HELP  GOOD LUCK|`|AA10280974	sweetie i think its just apart of you growing up. i remember 2years ago and there are many things on me that never looked the way they do today...    maybe if you try something like a complexion brightening cream that will do the trick, there are many brands out their and i know that Julique has one. good luck.

The idea of a cute cut on curly hair is ideal   You may want the roots back black with a frosted look streak of blond or auburn red   small rinse Barbie streaks that you can rinse out of the black and change.  You sound young and the Indian Mohawk is a shocker and you need to conform to the system not rock it.  In school you will be a outcast or distraction... You want to be social but not with more problems....Wait until college or you are on your own to find yourself and try things.|`|be7895ca5ab49ec5e52356fc36500c6eaa	i wouldn't go for a mohawk with curly hair, itll be more trouble than its worth. maybe a brown undertone wtih some red highlights. but black is VERY HARD to get rid of. i had to professionally strip my hair, it cost like 200 bucks, and even then the black didnt really come out. i still have problems with my hair actually taking the color.

You might get breast cancer.|`|2bfde9659efa5b0ae5d12aab6a92051eaa	Go get a consultant, perhaps at Victoria's Secret. Tell them and they could possibly give you some sugg.estions. Go try out a few sizes and see which one best fits you.    I don't know if that's true or not, but wouldn't you feel uncomfortable wearing bras when going to sleep? (That is, if you have tight bras on.)|`|2d36feed1c7bc190b8b9ea387a6bfb56aa	Check out Victoria's Secrets they can measure you and help you find one that fits.|`|AA11018224	Tight is right! Look for  a Bra  that fits closely on your body even with the back band in it's loosest hook position.The Bra will relax with wear and the warmth of your skin around  your  breast.so think SNUG-it will retain  the support you want.Best selection for you is  contemporary styling with non flattering reduction of up to 1 to 1/3.4 inches. See  Bali at Macy's or nearest your lingerie store.|`|d43bd3da63498714beb1bacfc220c4f1aa	You should always wear the proper under garments.  Go to VS they have Fitting Specialist to help you out.|`|376c69408d33c2e86f522dd2dce3f3ffaa	If there is a Victoria's Secret nearby, they do free bra fittings, If not try a 34 C because if you go up in a band size, sometimes you go down in a cup size and vice versa. And you don't need to wear a bra to bed- if you want to go right ahead. And sports bras with padded cups are very comfortable!|`|5d7d33daba4860d8d79944bac7b1b45baa	Yes, it is true that your breast sag as a product of aging. However, it's not a good idea to wear your bra to bed.    1) If you wear a bra at bed all the time, you risk the chance that the underwire, or bottom hem, of your bra will leave crease mark under your breast. It will look like a permenant tan line.    2) Some studies have shown, you may want to research this a bit, that leaving your breast bound in bra for long periods of time could be a pre-cursor for cyst, or lumps of tissue in your breast could form. Normally cyst and lumps of tissue are not medical emergencies, however they could lead to later complications.    If you want to prevent your breast from sagging then only thing I can think of is changing your diet so that they stay perky and firm.     To get the proper fit for a bra you can go to the lingerie section of a department store and have one of the attendants measure. Or have a friend or family member help you out.    Good luck!|`|3dbb77554d0f54f119429066a16e2623aa	Your not going to get breat cancer from wearing a bra at night... ignore that above response.    You should deffinatly go to VS or a department store and get your correct size.  Once you do that, you'll find that your bras are much more comfortable, even so that you can sleep in them.    The only reason I would suggest not sleeping in them is because it will cause them to stretch and lose their shape.  But they do make bras without underwires that should be better for sleeping.    Also... don't worry about your boobs sagging so much that you have to wear a bra to bed, that's just too extreme.  Plus, you're not a big enough cup size to worry that much either.

I did the home jobs and they seemed to really wreck my hair. They can let you pick the color and do a good job for you.|`|cafe5d7a1ed1fd9bc0a60dd6447c2712aa	Well, you may have to bleach it to get it that red. Red hair color is very hard to get to stay in the hair. The molecules are very big and don't like to fit in the hair. So they usually just stick on the outside and stain the hair.Thats why you get the fading so fast.The reason you turn orange is cuz the hair isn't light enough. Some stylist or people at home see the orange and freak but it needs to stay longer and it will lighten past the orange.  I hope this helps, cheap isn't always the best way to go.

First of all, if I were you I would get one entire outfit for the first day of school. and later in the school year wear them throughout. I read CosmoGirl, Seventeen, and teen People and read that skinny jeans are really in at this point. IDK if skinny jeans would look good on everybody...but if they don't settle on a regular pair of jeans. (Or cropped pants, or a pair of beige pants.) American Eagle has awesome jeans that are great with sizes....they have short or long or regular style, so if you have trouble with pants being too long, you can get a shorter inseam. Kohl's has cheaper jeans with a smaller selection but cute anyways.    As for a shirt, I guess you would like to dress sorta semi dressy. A pretty Victorian shirt or puffy sleeved printed shirt would be nice. Go to the store Forever 21 (aka Gadzooks in some states.) and you will find a large selection of adorable casual or dressy shirts for not too expensive. Wet Seal has nice back to school tops as well.    As for shoes, it matters how comfy you want to be. If I were you, I'd get a nice pair of flats. You can find nice casual or dressy flats at a department store. Also, you can find nice but more expensive ones at American Eagle, Delias , or Old Navy. (Payless has cute ones too!) If you want to get pumps nice ones are at Old Navy, Kohl's, and Payless. Kitten heels are appropriate for only the first day, which you can get at most shoe stores. Flip Flops are a comfy and casual footwear which you can choose also. (Cute ones at Department Stores, Kohl's, American Eagle, Delias, and Old Navy.)    Purse: Anywhere! Forever 21 has great ones and so does Old Navy.     Make-Up: Go light. Only wear a little make-up! Mascara (if you want), Lip Gloss, and a concealer if you want to hide blemishes. Target, and Walgreen's have good make-up selections. (Blush is cute too!) Accentuate your best features....if you have pretty eyes wear alot of eye make-up.        Hope I helped!|`|376da73d77f4ab3a2907c5b76e1a8e95aa	ok, I would go to kohl's for jeans.  They have a varity and practically any kind you could ever imagine.  As for the tops i would go to Macy's.  They have some super cute, trendy tops.  For shoes go to Rackroom Shoes.  They are having a sale until Sept. 11.  Buy one pair, get second 50% off. what is in style for hair right now is shoulder length hair with side bangs.  Very hott. sounds like you are a summer in make up.  Stick with light colors like light brown. ( And lay of the eye liner.  some people just don't know when to quit and it looks stupid.)|`|0ee4fbdbde0660909f72f3d821190713aa	one get a paper bag  two get bib over hauls  three get some undies  fourshoe's  five honey get all the war paint you can your going to need it  six oh get some nice stuff for those trips home for more money|`|AA12094221	Well, what face and body shape do you have?

They are more expensive but totally worth it - I had a cheap one & my hair would be in a ponytail within an hour but I splurged & got a good one which works awesome!      If you have natural wave use a mousse or gel & just scrunch it in your hair after a shower & hairspray it afterwards - this is a super easy do for summer.  There are also products at the salon (like Sleek n' Shine) which tames the hair & gets rids of the static & fly aways.  Good luck!|`|AA12352510	u can press u hair then curl it later|`|AA12134055	try combing it straight with a hair dryer and them using hair spray to keep it in place.|`|ee5fa5d997357912696706ddd9611088aa	Have you tried conditioner?I don't mean that in a rude way, just curious.

3a15a185741af8118978069daa9d695daa	Ethnic hair doesn't grow as fast as others. Yes, sometimes they have weaves or extensions braided in. Sometimes it is natural too. Best thing to do is ask. Most are very open about their hair, most that I've known and met anyway. I work with a girl that is really good at that stuff, but I'm not great at it. I stick to nails and hair cuts and colors and stuff. Thanks!|`|AA10378447	Some women, and even (gasp!) white women, wear extensions in their hair.

Some people do add in hair and some have long gorgeous locks like muah.  Depending on how small you want braids is about how much they cost. I never pay over $100 and they normally last a couple of weeks.|`|1a2e82b09148f8be7ae3693af3aca706aa	it depends on your genetics .not all African American girls have the same kind of hair and some African American girls are blessed with naturally long and curly hair.If it is not their hair it is a thing called weave which in a salon is sewn-in  or glued in and can cost from $80 to close to $160.sometimes when braided it is most likely extensions.|`|11b78e63a4419c25087022d1cda97fcfaa	it is preference
AA10866063	Shampoo, then condition. Proper shampooing is the first step to a healthy scalp and manageable hair, but don't use a conditioning shampoo. Two-in-one products that combine shampoo and conditioner really can't do a good job of either cleansing or conditioning. After all, how can a product effectively remove and add substances at the same time?     Instead, use a gentle shampoo to cleanse, then follow with a conditioner specifically geared for dry hair every time you shampoo. Don't worry about shampooing too often. Today's gentle shampoos are designed for frequent use.     Deep-condition regularly. To fill nicks and chips in the hair's damaged outer layer and restore shine, deep-condition. Depending on the condition of your hair, once a week or once every few weeks is all that is needed. Consisting of various combinations of natural and synthetic ingredients (including proteins, polymers or other additives), deep conditioners don't "feed" your hair; they just fill in defects and coat the hair shaft, resulting in a smooth, flat surface that will reflect light and restore shine to your hair.     For maximum effectiveness apply a deep conditioner before you shampoo. Gently work the conditioner into your hair with your fingertips and allow it to be absorbed for a few minutes. Then shampoo and follow with your regular conditioner.     Pat your hair dry. Hair dryers and blowers--and even vigorous towel-drying--can rough up the outer layer of hair cells. So whenever possible, pat or gently squeeze your hair dry with a towel and avoid rough handling.    Use thermal styling conditioners. If you must blow-dry your hair, spray it with a thermal conditioner such as HeatSafe before you plug in your dryer. HeatSafe combines four different types of moisturizers designed to both treat and prevent dry hair.     Protect your tresses. To prevent the sun from drying your hair or exacerbating hair that's already dry, mist your hair with a sunscreen made for hair before you hit the beach or head for the pool. Or wear a hat whenever you're out in the sun.     Good luck. :)|`|AA10174754	oiling is necessary and a good conditioner too...  try this home remedy Castor oil+coconut oil+olive oil and massage it on hairs....leave it overnight and wash you hairs with a good shampoo and conditiner.oiling your hairs are good remedie...  you can use aloe vera gel as a condtioner too|`|d81f57c7bba15af76da61ed8d234c703aa	Get a deep conditioner or hair mask.  Pantene makes a good moisturizing mask.  Put it on towel dried hair, wrap in a towel, leave on for about 20 minutes and rinse.|`|87cf5a54ce94b92fe70448969fcfaf5eaa	Regular salon treatments, and using conditioner everytime you wash your hair. Don't wash your hair daily and don't blowdry because it totally parches your hair. Use a good leave-in conditioner after you wash your hair. I have a little trick for dry hair: Use a small amount of extra virgin olive oil or virgin coconut oil and rub it on the driest patches of your hair (not on your scalp though). It works really fine and can be found in your kitchen...easy!|`|20db085ac4a14f21d011ad71e9d2c4f6aa	Put avocado and coconut oil on your hair. I know it sounds gross, but it really works. If you mix one avocado with about a cup of coconut oil and spread it onto your hair, it will become soft fromt he avocado and shiny from the coconut oil. Let it sit on your hair for about an hour atleast, but if you have more time let it sit for a couple hours. Rinse out with cool water, and then wash and condition as normal. Use shampoo, but do not use quite as much as you would normally. I hope this helps! Good luck, Sweetie, I hope you get great hair! It's gotten me far!|`|8538fdb7d6b8371b5eb58868a61fd253aa	First ,get your hair cut every 6 weeks, that's when split ends start to develop.  Second, get salon deep heating treatments every month.  Third, try to keep you hair from being exposed to the "elements" as much as possible.  If you swim in a pool, get your hair wet first, then  after you are finished swimming, rinse you hair then go wash it and put an extra deep conditioner on it for awhile, then rinse.  Sometimes the "at home" remedies work on your hair,  but they are mostly temporary fixes.  You really need to have a healthy cut to start ,I would say about 3-5 inches depending on how bad your hair is and then keep a routine going to the salon.  You hair will grow prettier and believe it or not if you wash you hair upside down and get your hair cut every 6 weeks it will grow faster.|`|c6c8da6a69c8d7da1c3119fd34dca93baa	conditioner?|`|bd1a5371adfaccf86df9f75cf051b7fbaa	ok my question is if your hair is naturally dry or if it from chemicals.(dying or perming)  Naturally dry-you just need good hair products (NOT PANTENE)  from the salon (professional products)  Chemically dry- need to go to your stylist and have a conditioning treatment about 3 times a month to start and as your hair gets better typically you would only need it once a month after that|`|AA11554374	First of all I guess you never Oil your hair. You should do it regularly. It will give lustre to your hair.  Use Coconut oil mixed with luke warm olive oil and rub it nicely in to your hair and scalpbefore going to bed. Leave it overnigth and in the morning wash it with Luke warm water and use a nice conditioner.  Repeat these activities atleast once a week and see the difference.|`|d4f1d9e40a3a3d380e25e4a9410d7f7caa	go to the salon and have a regular hot oil. if it's expensive for you,then buy a bottle of hot oil and just apply it to your hair before taking a bath and rap it with a towel or shower cap and rinse it after 15 mins. don't put a shampoo after rinsing.okey? and do it every once a week.|`|fc78f8ef9aa5fa46f9bf6c3e3887f40daa	Maybe u should try suave shampoo and conditioner that might work.

The fabric also has to be ironed while you are making the dress (fold-overs ironed in, creases, etc) so be sure to use steam to keep your fabrics looking good.|`|70a0fc39412e8858bb16eff94ded2af3aa	u wear a champanered whine dress lets see v neck and ankle length with  crested diamonds by your chest its a lil wrinkle and it shows write wear it ends with a flower a rose and  fringes look hot with sparkles it has too look hot  stick with  the red scarlett lipstick and maybeline mascara get brownish eyeshadow and blush and acsecirize with rubys , diamonds, or roses stick with it|`|AA11464583	I am looking...

No importa que no sea grande asi como las bubis es ralativo a la complexion de un hombre.    Y no nos gusta o al menos a mi que se la pasen agarrandaselo y moviendoselo y puajjjj.

Si absorbes menos lpidos, pues entonces es posible que disminuyas tu peso.   Debe ser prescrito por un mdico porque hay que regular el tiempo de tratamiento, los alimentos que debes ingerir para no tener problemas de desnutricin, la dosis y la alimentacin para que no vayas a ingerir muchas caloras en otros alimentos.   La eficacia a largo plazo disminuye (como en 2 a?os).  Los inconvenientes son diarreas, formacin de gases, y en general disconfort intestinal.  El tomar ste producto es equivalente a tener una dieta baja en grasas, lo cual creo yo, es mejor.

A veces los criterios esteticos nos son externamente impuestos por los medios de comunicacion masiva, y algunos estan fuera de la realidad (no todas las mujeres tienen el abdomen plano, ni todos los hombres tenemos musculos hipertroficos y piel dorada), pero el cuerpo humano es universal y cada parte es esencial en el conjunto (bueno, algunos medicos creen que la apendice no sirve para nada y te la sacan cuando te da apendicitis, pero eso es tema para otra conversacion).

Apply the same shadow under your lower lash line with a fine shadow brush and smudge lightly so it is blended. After this line your inner eyelids with a black pencil, Its the same basis for everyone regardless of skin colour, just experiment to find out which eyeshadow colours suit you!|`|AA11431483	Try not to over load your brush, gently do small layers slowly and dont go to mad with it.|`|AA11018224	There is even more you can do with year around without  applying  make up!Wear a sun glass to feel coll,mysterious and more attractive to opposite sex.To help prevent cataracts and macular degeneration.|`|98513249452daf7f384fd52826294647aa	i just now found this on youtube.com its a video on how to do the smokey eye effect  http://youtube.com/watch?v=776RKSnZJ7o  watch it....|`|5aa774b3d049f713916e4e99a68b337daa	Hi - there's a really good pallete from Bourgeois. It has 3 colours in it - white, light grey and black. Each colour has a little shimmer to it. It would look great with your skin colour. Put the light grey all over the lid. Put a little of the white in the centre of the lid and in the corner of your eye (next to your nose), and the black at the edge of your eye, round the socket and under your lashes. Blend really well. Wear black eyeliner at bottom of eye; liquid black eyeliner next to top lashes, and most importantly lots of black mascara! It'll look even better if your eyebrows are nicely shaped/defined with pencil if necessary.   Have fun!|`|32d84488133174884ebeed608d96877baa	I use two great roducts for smookey eyes...  The Clinique eye pencil with a brush for smookey effect is great!!! You have it in every color! Then there is this smookey eye set from Manhatten (sorry if it isn't spelled corectly) it contains two shades (one darker one lighter) and a special creamy shadow (darker color) for the smookey effect..also a great aplicator!!!  As for the colors of the make up...here is one article i found:    How to Select Eye Makeup That Complements Asian Coloring    For many years, Asian beauties defined their eyes with black and brown eye pencils. The modern era offers a subtle twist on these beauty staples and invites experimentation with other shades and mediums.  Steps       1. Remember your options. Pencil liners, liquid liners and shadows, alone or in combination, will add definition and sophistication to your eyes.     2. Look for modern shades of brown and black. You're sure to find an espresso with a subtle shimmer or a coal with a glint of sparkle.     3. Go for the color. Asian eyes look stunning in shades of plum, raisin and gray.     4. Consider shadow compacts that offer a gradation of color, if you wish to give your eyes depth. Start with the darker shade at the lash line, finishing with the lightest shade near the brow.     5. Wear black or dark gray mascara. Curl your lashes to open up your eyes, and consider adding a few false lashes at the outside ends for a sexy wink.    Tips & Warnings        * Have a makeup artist do your eyes to get an idea of what application and color scheme suit your eye shape and makeup needs. Most local department store makeup counters offer free sessions.      * Wear long-wearing and waterproof formulas in the summer to avoid running liners or streaking mascaras.      * Experiment with softer colors in the warmer months - just remember that your eye and hair color may be too deep to support the palest pastel shades.      * Always keep a steady hand when curling eyelashes to avoid pulling lashes out.      * Never apply false eyelash glue directly to your eye.

There are so many ways a professional can get ur hair to do that is hard at home.

e1733f0034319099436fd8da8e8ac7f9aa	lovely boots by the way. Personally, with a rockish-looking dress, i think it would look cool.

If I were you, I would wear higher boots (up as far as your knee) with lots of laces, especially since you said it was a 'rockish' looking dress. However, if the dress is longer (past your knees) I would suggest trashing the boot idea, and going with something simpler, as not to take the attention away from your dress.|`|AA12064167	TOTALLY, that would be really hip and cool, i say go for it girl!!

I would recommend products you can purchase at your local salon.  Red kin and Bio loge have some good products.  Cut off the ends of your hair-you don't really have to take any length just a trim.  There is a product made by Samey-called shining glaze (I think that's the name-it's in a green spray bottle-like hairspray comes in.) Or Bio loge Milk Shine- they  really makes your hair shine.  I would also recommend to get some of those cheap plastic bags -like hairdressers use and at night, and using a good conditioner-wet your hair at night-apply the conditioner and put on the plastic cap (you can buy these at Walmart), and sleep with it on.  Then the next morning, wash it out.  Another idea is to buy some VO5 Hair Dressing.  You just need about a dimes worth and you can put it on your hair-wet or dry.  It's been around for a long time and I believe the reason for it is because it works. Be careful to just use a DAB of it or your hair can look greasy.|`|d5521cdcd5476c363ef36ef861d71e58aa	do Hot oil massages /Henna on hair---    check the links below for natural homemade beauty tips to:Hot oil massages /Henna on hair  http://geebal.blogspot.com    Read...Free Beauty tips on....natural and homemade methods to:  Skincare/Acne-pimple cure/Blemishes/Whiteheads/Blackheads/     Wrinkles/Freckles/Steaming/herbal recipe for skin  Haircare/Dandruff/Hairloss/ Hot oil massages   Henna on hair/Splitends/Oilyhair/Dryhair    Nailcare/Manicure/Pedicure      Eye care/Darkcircles/Puffiness/eyebags   Herbal tips/Herbal recipe   http://geebal.blogspot.com      Free beauty tips on Makeup/Hairstyles & photo gallery/     hair highlighting/Weightloss /Hairremoval/ etc...     http://geebal.blogspot.com

882f8a9eeec0f0f004bf504cfed2d056aa	What you need to do is simply control the muscles around your mouth better.  This is very important to maintaining a properly balanced smile.  Too much and you have gums, too little and you just plain look silly.  I am sorry to hear that you hate your smile.  I just think that you are probably pulling back on your lips and surrounding muscles too much.  Just try to control it, but in a relaxed fashion, and you should be just fine.  Whatever you do, keep smiling!  Good luck!|`|AA11018224	Just standing in  front of mirror and practice yourself.Teeth without Gum just like a blank place.The way you smile it's depends.First of all open your mouth not so wide.Try to laugh something and watch yourself how the smile looks.Thereafter open your full lips and smile  again,watch it and finally open wide your full mouth and laugh like a mad and I mean watch it,,,watch for your smile.Before you smile  open your mouth allow your  pointer finger to hold one cheeks and other hand's pointer finger  to hold another cheek,now  hold  stretch your both cheeks  way from each other, do it again and again for at least 20 times in 5minutes.This is your exercise to show the expression of your face.I hope within one week your smile may definitely improve just like a Britney spear laughing while singing and dancing.|`|1886a7845db3822ea66b19a243469812aa	Dear Gum-Hater Smile-Lover,  Most people are very conscious of the way they look. Would you really want to cover your mouth with your hand everytime you thought something was funny? This eventually will lead to more extreme cases such as avoiding social events. Dont worry about your teeth gum showing. Its may not seem that natural but it is. Your gums could be receeding and that mean that your teeth and the teeth roots both show. Then your teeth are more likely to rot. Now consider the grossness of that. I bet you smile alot, this is a really good thing. I know its an old thing to say but this is so true. "Dont worry, be happy." "Dont Worry" about how you look when you smile and "Be Happy" that you have teeth. And keep smiling.

AA11398555	First of all, if you have relaxed hair I would be extremely careful about any permanent dye you put in your hair.  Black hair dye is one of the hardest colors to penetrate, if at all.  If you succeed, which I doubt, but should you try the white strip, you will probably loose the white strip because of bleach damage.  I would suggest if you really want this look, you might try leaving the hair you want the strip on out.  (away from the black dyed hair) and just go lighter, not white.  Trying to get a white strip on relaxed hair is risky.  Or you could just dye your hair black (I prefer semi-permanent dyes on relaxed hair, it is safer) and just have a white piece of hair (weave or whatever) placed where you want it.  Don't be so quick to get this look, you might regret the outcome. Good Luck..|`|AA11503396	yes. try Bigen hair color. it colors the hair pretty well and doesn't have any chemicals in it.|`|d3f349e34ea1d3f87fed59cd46738f1baa	WELL...    1. I don't know how great that would look in the first place.    2. It will obviously damage your hair. Any chemical will do that.    3. It will at some point fade and not be white, it'll turn creamish at some point because it will begin to blend with your natural hair color.    and....  most importantlyyyyyyyy.............    DO WHAT YOU LIKE.  Gotta take a chance on everything, right?  A little advice on the way always helps though.

Hopefully, you can use this:  Believe it or not....an over the counter medicine used to calm minor indigestion is great for blocking oil and sweat. I'll go a step further to say that by adding this ingredient to a persons daily morning ritual could aid in the prevention of pimples. In the past, I've recommended a three step process that includes Milk of Magnesia that has totally changed the quality of many peoples appearance; but I won't discuss it here. I'm not a doctor or anyone medical or in professional skin care or makeup application.. but it does work. If you decide to try it, wash your face in the morning and use the Milk of Magnesia as a moisturizer applying a reasonable amount and do not wash off or as a mask then simply remove Milk of Magnesia mask by splashing water on your face and using your hands (no wash cloth) until VISIBLE traces of the Milk of Magnesia are gone. I guarantee you'll find less or "NO" oily or sweaty breakthroughs. But beware of the soaps etc., that you are using also they could be the cause of your oily skin as well. F.Y.I. Milk of Magnesia has been around for over 50 yrs....it is used to coat the stomach .. much like TUMS to prevent stomach pains caused by acid indigestion. It's called "MILK" because its a white chalky liquid that resembles milk. Check it out I really believe that you'll be glad you did.
AA10175450	I agree therapy is the way to go.    However, if you are reluctant to seek therapy or feel you are in a situation that doesn't allow it, I would suggest you try to reduce your cutting a bit at a time. Wean yourself from the addiction to it. When you feel like cutting, get out a notebook and write out your feelings, what is motivating you to cut, why you want to stop, how you are feeling. Feel proud of yourself for every time you don't do it. Reward yourself. Remember how good you feel when you are able to resist. When you do cut, remember how bad you feel the next time you feel the desire.    Be strong. Find something to feel good about. Love yourself.|`|98001cca1e05fd02dc65bfdccdd024dbaa	First, of all, the first step in getting help is admitting you have a problem, so you are definitely on the right path. Secondly, you have to ask for help. People who usually cut, do it to rid themselves of psychological pains. You need to talk to a counselor or get some help for a therapist. Good Luck! If you stay focused, you can get through it.|`|c9c23a7a91ba166cb81c18e48b6c9917aa	You suffer internally and have no understanding of how or why you internalize severe depression. If indeed you understood then it would be easier to identify and suppress. However, the inability to understand it leaves you little choice but to internalize instead of offering outward verbal expression. This internalization manifests itself in a series of self mutilations which in a sense expresses your frustration in a physical way rather than a verbal way. Unfortunately those around you who witness this can only see the frustration externally and not the cause of it internally thereby leaving them totally helpless and you without any cure. It is of course very disturbing to the  people who see what you are doing but even though you are attracting much attention to the problem there is little to nothing that they can do. So in a sense you are just wasting your time and spinning your wheels going nowhere with that behavior. Only you can effect a change along with the help of a behavioral specialist. I truly understand the isolation that you feel and can also only urge you to look inside of yourself to seek out, identify, and put a halt to the pain that you are experiencing. Remember that you alone hold the key to the lock as you probably already know. Most likely you have had unsuccessful therapy sessions in the past. Still you must continue to seek help in understanding what the problem is and what to do about it.  You are an independent individual free to make choices in the world that affect your life. Life is but a canvass on which we paint our dreams and some of us have to try harder to become a good artist. Get some drawing paper and transfer your thoughts to paper using pencils instead of blood. You may be surprised at what you start to see emerging from within.  What was once internalized will be there in front of you to explore and analyze.

3666ecf9e574860d46127d421d705876aa	That depends, are we talking a dozen hairs or more than you can count? If it's the former trim away (I do it myself sometimes), but if it it's the latter then you probably need a haircut. I don't know what your hair looks like but you could easily make it an uneven mess if you keep snipping at it. Also, split ends usually keep splitting & destroy the hair shaft. You might get the ones you can see split on the ends, but you could have hundreds more that have split almost all the way up the shaft & will fall out prematurely. A 1 to 3 inch cut (depending on how long your hair is) is the only way to get rid of badly split ends. After the cut get a good conditioner & comb it through your hair to lay the cuticle flat. Don't comb your hair again after you rinse & don't rub a towel through your hair - gently squeeze the the excess water from your hair with a towel. Get a trim every 2 to 3 months & you won't have a problem again!|`|d4755ea2521e3cc7f34cc06cb6444ce3aa	That's actually a good solution to split ends. Keep it up! =)|`|AA10194042	nope .. that's wat u should do|`|f034231ab201d7bba835872152f1d95caa	Split ends may mean you have a Vitamin A deficiency.|`|99cc312a8edbce380c6fc60641319b73aa	no you're not doing any damage, it actually helps your hair more|`|8c0b550635f22156b6969caf14953f55aa	That's actually the only way to rid of split ends! What you're doing is very good and healthy for your hair. Split ends are damaged hair. Keep on doing what you're doing.|`|d411a620ed6d0cd319061a1c4bdbf13eaa	Split ends are dead hair, the more you remove, the more your hair is capable of growing. Good job!|`|203c7130e7ae5ec30b60dde276fb521baa	Absolutely not! Take sections of your hair (small ones) and twist gently into a rope like shape. Keep holding the end and extend it as far as your hair will go (not tugging in any way.) Now you will see all your split ends sticking out screaming to be trimmed! By all means cut away. If left un-trimmed....they will continue to split and tangle causing you to brush out those tangles causing more and more split and snapped ends!    Trim away friend!|`|2fe1a1bce753265d11346cfb5d260c08aa	Actually, trimming your hair is good.  Instead of trimming the split ends here and there, just get a haircut.  Trim an inch off.     Or maybe what you're doing is combing your hair while it's wet.  I think that also causes split ends.|`|019e103ac591072b4fab9fee21c21a83aa	no ,but please moisturize your hair with a good conditioner and your split ends will cease. The best conditioners are usually found at the beauty salons.|`|99b688e76b75f46b8a5d14d59066d8b5aa	Trim all the splits you can see. Get regular haircuts as well. This will remove them, minimize them, and promote new hair to grow!    GoodLuck!

2c12fe5510155794419f20cd6b787caaaa	Yes they are exactly the same. If you can afford it, just buy human hair. Toyokalon hair is just less shiny. No you can't apply heat either, the hair will melt.    Maintenance of Toyokalon hair:   Fill a basin with lukewarm water, add a small amount of mild shampoo and swish the wig gently in basin.     Rinse throughly in cool water.     Shake out and drip dry.     Do not brush while wet - this can permanently damage the fiber.     Do not use curling irons or other heating appliances.     No setting is necessary as curls will snap back into position when hair is completely dry.     Brush into desired style only after wig is completely dry.|`|AA11455037	yes,one in the same...I don,t know about the iron,if its good for synthetic ,then it wouls work on toyokalon|`|AA11018224	Some wigs are made 100% of toyokalon and some are 50% natural + 50% toyokalon.Some wigs are 100% natural.Yes you can use hair curling iron on wigs made of  toyokalon.Jewish peoples use only 100% natural hair wigs or those who can afford it.

Good Luck|`|99b688e76b75f46b8a5d14d59066d8b5aa	Try Olive Oil in your hair once a week. Make it warm before you massage it in.    Also, beer is great to give volume, wash your hair with beer after shampoo. It will give it a more fuller feel.    A beaten egg (with yolk and all) with a little yogurt (for dry hair - optional) is good too. Apply 30 minutes before wash and then your usual shampoo conditioner. This recipe is by far one of the best, as long as you can manage to get the egg smell out... Maybe you need to shampoo rinse and repeat 2-3times.     GoodLuck!|`|5eb814c398153d5bf53777dee7b11b54aa	There are some cute hairstyles for short hair.  Have it short and flip it out.

afda96cbf9dd97f6ee7e81957d649dcbaa	If you want casual you could wear it with jeans, and a black tanktop underneath or something like that.  To dress it up it would also be cute with a pencil skirt.  It's very cute though.  I would stick to wearing a solid color tank top underneath it though becuase a peice on it's own and you don't want anything too distracting.|`|98001cca1e05fd02dc65bfdccdd024dbaa	you could wear a gray skirt with a white button up, or dress it down with jeans and a plain white t-shirt.|`|acf35e9a14ab43302a0cfb7209403478aa	first of all how cute! i would suggest a tank under it black or white (whatever goes best-kinda hard to tell) with some nice dress pants. it shouldn't be difficult to figure out how to wear it just go with whatever looks best!    its cute you really can't go wrong.|`|AA11878509	You should where like a light blue tank top underneath the jacket.Then wear faded jeans with and a cute necklace to tie it to together.    nice name almost like mine, lol
AA11137897	Well, I think I know what you are talking about. I went to the 100 yen shop in Japan and they have rough wash cloths. But honestly, they just remind me of the cheap wash cloths you can get from any dollar store in the states. Just feel around for the cheapest washcloths in department stores, I bet you will find one quickly.

9e2f599e0171b38485001ddf56bffa2eaa	Yeah, they do tend to run small. They seem to be making their clothes smaller and smaller so that littler kids can wear them, even though most of the people that shop there are like 13-18-ish. Definetely dont be ashamed if you cant fit into their clothes cuz they run almost 2 sizes smaller than most places it seems. And yeah, jeans do seem to fit differently.|`|81853bb1499c0ba1c3cc5eea0b54c6c6aa	I think they run boring and they make you look like a prepubescent teenager that has no personal style and just follows what everyone else wears.|`|98001cca1e05fd02dc65bfdccdd024dbaa	Yea, they run really small.

Its rediculous.|`|aa8b2a68c2a058186749dd6e1dd7f1eaaa	i know that their sizes do tend to run small and that their pants are made for people with little or no curves (they're made for the really tall and skinny type ppl), so, if they're not super skinny, then that's probly why they don't fit in them (not saying they're fat, i promise). but i'm not sure about the consistency...sorry =/|`|a05c55f22af735bc3e28137734af5c72aa	I shop at Hollister a lot and I have to agree with you because I've bought one size of Hollister jeans that are kinda loose in the waist and tight on the legs and then I have another pair (the same size) and are extremely tight in the waist and loose in the legs..... I think they make different "shapes" instead of regular different "sizes" to fit all types of people... and when a new style comes out just pray its the shape and size that will fit you... They should just change the tags in the back of the pants and say "Shape  32" or something|`|c178981b5b65aa5c946dfca53b95a9b7aa	haha yeah sorta. i like really skinny and i already fit a medium at there stores but at ae i only fit an xs. lol|`|c6ad334b493db8e2b0510d9fc69fd7d3aa	ya they do.  all hollister clothes are small  and tight. but don't be assamed   of that. i mean everyone knows  that hollister clothes have different  clothes size standards.

xSqAe2t3aa	You'll have to bleach it again. If you put blonde colour on it now, it won't change at all - except to maybe make it MORE ginger. To strip the colour out and get your hair to a blonde, it has to go through all the darker tones. It's inevitably going to go a bit ginger, the shade depending on how dark your hair started off as. Just bleach it again to lift the ginger to blonde, then put an ash colour on. I don't know what lightener you used, but I would recommend Schwartzkopf Live XXL in Ice or Absolute Platinum, that's what worked for me.|`|sLYKaYaRaa	have you tried a product called gringal

The problem with these products & even lemon juice & salt water is if you do achieve your desired lift of colour the damage would be the same as if you had bleached it. All these products & methods are very drying so I think your best bet is to pay your hairstylist a visit & ask about going lighter. Bleach is not the only way you can go blonde professionally. Ask your stylist about High-lift colours & an alternative to bleach.|`|ly5ZcXzMaa	act dumb .   on second thoughts stay as you are !|`|pmEDld6Zaa	well there are a bunch of different things you can do,  you can use sun in spray which naturally lightens your hair, you can use lemon juice, there are a lot of different products|`|Xq8nStTfaa	lmfao ^ i'm w/ /// him|`|1fUWIR8maa	Try Sunsilk Blonde Shampoo And Conditioner  It Works!|`|922ba573578ae815b5ea980b948c3e22aa	Lemon juice, and lots of it, in a spray bottle.

YwD0sIBqaa	I would tend towards a colour where you are not trying to cover up the orange, such as a medium brown (which will end up quite golden) or a darker reddy brown OR a dark natural brown.    Recently I thought it would be a good idea to bleach my hair from dark brown, so that I could colour it bright pink. Turned out to be a horrible idea, but when I attempted to bleach the pink out it ended up an orange that vast amounts of toner would not fix.  So I then opted for a light ash brown, thinking that it would counteract the effect of the golden orange colour, but the result was not a pretty sight and looked like an extrememly fake brown with green undertones. Following this, I proceeded to dye it a dark brown, which though permanent, has faded now to a light natural brown and looks much better whilst also aiding in the condition of my hair.    So if I were to do it again (which I probably will knowing how often my hair changes) I would probably go straight to a darker brown. Though if this is not an option try a light brown with golden tones.... BUT NOT BEIGE OR ASH!!!|`|GqiDGMlEaa	black black black....sorry i like black|`|6lygPOO4aa	if you have orange hair you really do want to cancel it by using a colour that will neutralize the colour like a violet or ash base stick with the same level though so you have something similiar as far as lightness it will only change the shade.  If you want to go for something all together different try a copper or a red since you already have the base of that with the orange.  Colour doesn't lift colour so you can't make it lighter than it already is.  You can change the shade or go darker.  It is still tricky if you are using over the counter colour though.  Good luck!|`|7a38d36f6ffa83b00941b3b0c0a13aacaa	go for a regular brown color.........the sun will lighten the color|`|99b688e76b75f46b8a5d14d59066d8b5aa	Try a brown. If you like golden brown, go ahead. If you want something a bit different, try copper brown.     Don't try anything too extreme, you don't want to have to do it again.    Good luck!

AA10476282	Horseradish is noted as a skin treatment, to remove spots and blemishes from the skin. Use 4 ounces freshly-grated horseradish, 1 quart buttermilk (dairy products used externally are okay), and 4 ounces glycerine. Place all in a half-gallon jar and shake well. Let stand overnight in a cool place. Shake well again and strain through a fine strainer. Bottle and keep cold, in the fridge. Then at night wash the areas on your face you want to treat, such as spots, discolorations, freckles, blackheads, scuff, or any skin blemish. Rub the horseradish lotion into the desired spot until the skin tingles with warmth. Wipe of the surplus and go to bed. This will stimulate the skin and bleach out unwanted discolorations. It is superior to any skin product on the market, according to Dr. Shook.|`|GS6dEDDFaa	make up make up make up|`|9289604e1e3dfc88e76f3971e3a9904eaa	Try sleeping with a shea butter or cacao butter lotion on the affected areas.|`|VqJOccGaaa	u mean like those dark blemishes right?Well i have a natural remedy to share which works effectively for me.This is to help the blemish to peel off.U mix salt with warm wate(really must be warm)r and dab it with cotton onto the blemish for about 2 mins just hold onto it.Keep doing it.

I work at Macy's and I'm doing a lot of the back work and i deal with a lot of boxes and its pretty manual. I didnt wear a lot of rings or watches, bracelets just because I'm afraid of scratching them up, breaking them or something. I do although wear earrings all the time. I didnt really think theres an accessory that you cant wear to work. Unless we are talking about an eyebrow pierceing or something like that i think thats a major no no. Other than that i think that its cute and stylish to show off a bit of bling bling.|`|8911c80abbc48473f697e51a069ac75eaa	It depends on where you work and the impression you want to give. Normally I would suggest nothing, a single pin, a demure necklace (like a solitaire - something small), a simple bracelet, or small, non-dangling earrings. Wearing large ornaments, multiple large rings or something worse like a huge gold name pendant tells everyone you care more about appearance than your job. Normally people who are very low class wear lots of jewelry or fancy clothes - look at it this way, the more you show off the more youre telling everyone how unimportant you are. Again, what do you do? By the way, if you are a nurse or your job involves using a computer: avoid long done up nails  think about the message you are sending. The general workplace rule is: try to look like everyone else.

db3a022b3b356f2d6d93ef2a50ef9cb5aa	Well, I have that same problem! But, I use Pantene Pro-V shampoo, and it really helps it smooth down! I also have a HAIR STRAIGHTENER that I use all the time. If you don't already have a hair straightener, they sell them at Wal-Mart for like $10!!!! If that doesn't work, go to a hair salon and ask them what products will work best for your hair.  Hope that works!|`|46b280af3228ed855e1f73a074d31a97aa	One of the problems could be lack of moisture.  Try using shampoo less frequently, and incorporate more conditioner and a weekly deep conditioner.    You could also use some of the frizz serums they have, like John Frieda's Frizz Ease. Just DO NOT heat style with any kind of silicone products in your hair, it will fry it even more.    Also, if you have curls, try scrunching your hair with paper towels instead of regular towels, it will define it more with less frizz.    Try not to heat style (blow dryers, diffusers, straighteners curling irons, etc.) too often because this will further damage your hair and cause more split ends. If you do need to dry hair, try using a diffuser about 6" away from the hair.    Another good thing to use is 100% Virgin Coconut Oil. It makes your hair more moisturized. You can buy it at Indian grocery stores and a good brand to try is called "Parachute".|`|myL1RSgpaa	use "frizz ease" by john frieda.  it's not just a serum--now there is a whole product line, including shampoo and conditioner.  it's available anywhere, wal-greens, target, wal-mart, etc.    the link is listed below to find out more info.|`|AA10813118	sun silk has good stuff/ but you dont have to get the shampoo and conditioner/ just get the leave in cream    and keep your hair in a ponytail most of the time to keep in together/ but not all the time because when you take it out  you will be able to see the line where your pony was    hair straiteners work sometimes but they could cause your hair to break and it will look frizzier    i have the same problem|`|VCQvNkw9aa	I used to like Frizz Ease Serum by John Freida until I discovered Zero Frizz Serum.  It's just as cheap if not cheaper, and it works very well.  If your hair is shoulder length or shorter you need only about the size of the dime.  You put it in while your hair is wet, then blowdry it.  Follow up with a straight iron if needed and be careful NOT to put it anywhere near your roots or your hair will be greasy.  If your hair is longer than shoulder length use about as much as the size of a quarter.|`|yTCEJRC9aa	John Frieda frizz ease serum is a miracle|`|ZhiYghZ1aa	"none of ur frizzness by herbal essenses" its awsum and works ah-mazing|`|S4YvFLJ0aa	you style it in easy but transforming styles and use different shampoos such as sunsilk and john freida products. just incase you are looking for styling tips, heres a few:    buy those soft curlers and sleep in them. it is soooo easy and you save so much time in the morning. you just take them out and only brush the top of your hair otherwise you brush right through the curls. then use hairspray, not mousse. ive found that a great brand of hairspray is matrix hairspray. and for looser, messier curls, you separate each curl in two. it is a more casual, less shirley temple look.  then for waves, sleep in braids. (the number depending on how wavy you want your hair. i would probably recommend about eight or so) then you just take them out in the morning and just brush the top of your hair. you can use hairspray, but i usually dont need it, but then again, my hair holds waves really well......  and if you shower in the morning, scrunch your hair with mousse and it looks pretty good but might get a little frizzy.    and as for just regular hairstyles, i would try sidebangs or whispy bangs instead of thick ones......dont know about the cut i might have to see the shape of your face, sry....  you can also do buns, because they are pretty in, or low pigtails, but you might be a little old for them, but my sister in college looks cute in them so i dont know.....  as for hairbands, very cute and in!!! definitely!!!  u could wear your hair half-up, leaving your bangs down.....    hope i helped!!! good luck!!!|`|8P8q7wlhaa	straighten it.

yghcGbK5aa	Here you go! I have already gotten like a million best answers for this, and my friends call this hair crack. So, don't pass this up!      FOR THICK AND THIN HAIR    1. Warm up some olive oil in the microwave (not too hot, luke warm, and the purer the olive oil the better.)    2. Apply it all over your hair. Apply it to dry hair. Especially pay attention to the ends.     3. Wrap your hair with plastic wrap. (This is because it does get a little drippy sometimes).    4. Place a towel around your neck. (Same reason as above.)    5. Leave in for an hour.    6. Shampoo and condition it out. (Make sure not to slip in the shower, that stuff is slippery.    THIS IS FOR PEOPLE WHO HAVE THIN HAIR    Use coconut oil, and do the same as above. (It's not as drippy as olive oil though.) Coconut oil isn't really great for people with thick hair. It tends to make thick hair a little tangled and little greasy. So people with thin hair only!    Do this either once a week or every other week.     I have gotten so many people hooked on this, it should be illegal.     Definetly do this and tell me how it works!|`|QZYiURz6aa	apply a mixtue of egg yolk and henna for abt an hour and wash it completely. do this twice a week. condition with coconut oil and wash with traditional soapnut powder. stay away from all shampoos and conditioners sold in markets.|`|5bd7477de56faa57123c368de593ae4aaa	use olive oil every second day with luke warm water|`|n1KcXyuuaa	you can't avoid hair from falling out 100 hair strands fall out each day when you shampoo and brush or anything else that you do with your hair.
