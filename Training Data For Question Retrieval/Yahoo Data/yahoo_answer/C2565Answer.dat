Have you only done this once, have there been any problems after wards? Does the car still shift in and out of gear easily?

If so, don't worry about it just try to come to a complete stop before putting in drive or park.|`|1sOWpQR2aa	You can mess up your transmission if you do this a lot.

m0fCTwwYaa	I varies from place to place, but it usually is around that time frame. Most of the rules you see are not the decision of the company but required by the insurance company the FBO uses.<br>  It all depends on the insurance carriers - and what they allowed the FBO or company to do. Some require currency in the past 30 days, some require it in 60. I have seen seen a place allow longer periods of 60 days of currency lapses. Even 60 days between flights is stretching it, in my mind.<br>  No company in their right mind would allow you to return a year later and rent an aircraft. They have no way of verifying your currency. By requiring you to complete a currency flight with an instructor is not just to line their pocket with your money. It's to protect them, their aircraft, their insurance coverage, and most importantly, you.|`|aBJDqwq6aa	Yes.<br>  Most of the currency rules are due to the FBO's insurance policies. Same goes for PIC time required in certain aircraft.<br>  <br>  I've rented from FBO's which required a rental within the last 90 days, as well as one which had no such policy, as long as I was current.<br>  A month seems fairly short.<br>  <br>  Yeah, if you only rented at a place once a year, you'd probably need a checkout every time.|`|o5KbZk1saa	At our FBO it is based on the number of hours you have and is set by our insurance company not us.<br>  If you have less than 150 hours you must have your card signed monthly.<br>  If you have over 150 hours you are good for 90 days.<br>  So i am sure that it varies from place to place.<br>  <br>  regards<br>  <br>  Russ

"MIKE" is one of the people scammers love. He can't tell this whole thing is phony.|`|biMINS1Eaa	Well, if you list it on ebay and complete a transaction, you will have something to fall back on if the transaction goes awry.  You should have any specific details you want fulfilled listed specifically in the auction so that if it is not the way you wanted it, there is written proof in the auction that it was supposed to be this way.  Ebay doesn't actually handle the money, you would have to go through paypal or a money order, but paypal will make sure there is a clean transaction, and if you complete the order through ebay, you can send a money order with some sort of tracking or confirmation that can confirm you are sending it which would give you some peace of mind.  It is pretty safe, but make sure specifics are listed in the auction so that you do not get a product that is less than your standards.  By the way, it does sound very sketchy...almost too good to be true.

Fr6GdIQ3aa	You probably live in NY - or some equally crappy state that has a terrible ticketing process - Your best bet is to always go to court to fight your ticket. 9 times out of 10 the officer who issued your ticket doesnt show up and the judge will either reduce the penalty or revoke it entirely. Lost of times they keep the fine but remove the points. Just be sure you have either a reason for their "mis-reading" or just hold your ground and say you were only going "73 TOPS - HONEST!"<br>  <br>  I know for new drivers, just about any ticket can become a license suspension for 30, 60, or 90 days depending on the situation & ticket. But you can also bring your parents and they can fight for you to keep your license since you need it to "Get to your job every afternoon" or "Commute to community college" a lot of times Judges can sympathize with parents who cant haul their kids around 24/7 to their important things.<br>  <br>  You'll pay in the $200-250 range for 20-25mph over the limit.<br>  <br>  The licensed insurance agent above is not being very nice. In all honesty, she probably wants you to take the fine and the points so that her dirty insurance company can take more money from you.<br>  <br>  But I agree, if you still get the ticket, even after court, and after paying the fine... you should take a driver's safety course to remove the points! Probably costs $50.00 and a Saturday though.|`|LuqZXXyBaa	Instead of pleading not guilty and "seeing how it goes" why not just plead guilty and take the defensive driving course offered to you by the court. This will remove the points from your license. Your license should not be suspended as this was your first offense. I'm not sure where you live but driving 20 miles over the limit is criminal driving in most states and you can loose your license for that.

That means you won't be able to give your subs as much power as you would in the correct enclosure.<br>  <br>  Taking away internal volume is fairly easy.  All you have to do is add some dense material inside the enclosure.  For this case you will need to take away around 0.7 cubic foot per chamber.  It may be less if you include subwoofer displacement.  So add some dense material like MDF or something else.  <br>  <br>  Good Luck!!!

ozYxyOvLaa	Chrome is a sharp appearance on black surfaced cars. It would look extremely sharp. The question is, is it stainless steel that is polished and buffed to a mirror finish or is it anadized aluminum, or is it die cast that is chrome plated. Those are the common trim types. I work at a custom chrome plating shop. We charge to polish and buff stainless steel $12-15 a foot.

Go out on the freeway & pay attention to the mile markers to see how far off it is.<br>  For example, if you go exactly ten miles & your odometer says you only went 9 miles, that means your speedometer is off by 10%; which  means that when your speedometer SAYS you're going 70, you're ACTUALLY going 77.

Pretty much all 88-00 Civics can be swapped with stronger motors (B,H, K) with pretty much all the same steps. Some will need additional wiring (if using a VTec motor, then you will need to add VTec wires usually pressure, ground, and signal/power). A b-series or newere d-series vtec will be by far the easiest. For your car, being that it is a DPFI (Dual point injection), you will first need to convert to MPFI (Multi point injection). After that you can then swap a new motor in. If you are just looking for a replacement, get a D-series single cam and drop it right in. If you want a stronger motor but a somewhat simple swap get a b-series. You can find them in 90-01 Integras. There are b18a1/b17a1/B18b1 and b18c1/c5. The a1/b1 is a non-vtec dual cam motor. The b1 has about 10 more hp than the a1. The b17a1 is a somewhat hard to find motor, but is pretty strong. The b17a1 is a dual cam vtec. The b18c1/c5 is a dual cam vtec motor. All motors will swap in fairly simply with the right parts. You wil essentially need the b-series engine/tranny mounts, and a b-series linkage. If you are using a VTec motor, you will to add the wires for vtec to work correctly. You will also need the ecu of that engine to run correctly or a chipped ecu for the motor. Your car is an Pre-OBD/OBD-0, so you will need an OBD0 ecu ('91 and older) or a jumper harness to jump your ecu connectors from obd0 to obd1. You will also need the b-series axles and half shaft/intermediate shaft including the b-series tranny. If i'm not mistaken you will also need to upgrade your DX hubs/knuckles to Si ones so the alxes will fit. Also will need an obd0 distributor and alternator if using your factory engine harness. Everything else will pretty much bolt up. If you want more power, you can do an H-series swap (motor from a 92+ Honda Prelude), but that will have some cutting and rewelding of the frame which may scare some people. You can also do an H2B swap which is an H-series motor paired up with a b-series tranny. You will need a custom adapter plate for the motor/tranny combo, but it will bolt up like a b-series swap, including still being able to use the b-series axles. An h2b to some is comparable to the infamous k-series swap. The k-swap will need the most fabrication by far as it is a cable driven tranny, as well as the whole motor is backwards compared to other honda motors. Best bang for your buck would be a b18b1 swap or an OEM replacement. Good luck!

The a/c on the other hand could be several different things, as simple as a $2.00 relay or condenser, maybe com presser or something as simple as the serpentine belt which works the pulley's on the water pump and compressor.

3d77869d9f11316a3774dff59717fc1caa	If you don't understand cars too well and can't afford a good mech, might be time to park it for a while. You have to determine what the motor is lacking, you need compression, fuel delivery, spark, and a healthy computer or PCM. You state the motor runs well when it runs, so you can assume the motor is in good enough condition to have compression. Check for fuel pressure at the fuel rail port just below the oil fill cap. You will need a gauge for this that screws onto the fitting after you remove the cap. You need about 35 psi to run. Check the spark output at every plug wire, spark plug end to ground. Needs to be strong and consistent. Normally on these cars, it's either the fuel pump, the ignition module, or the crank sensor.|`|00f73eca1a6198a977b56a5103cd4dcdaa	many things... my mother went throught the same thing with it stalling out?<br>  if thats what your going though: when it shuts off put it in park, THEN take the key out of the "on" position then try to start it again.<br>  <br>  <br>  if it doesnt work could be:<br>  alternator<br>  starter<br>  battery<br>  ignition<br>  you could just need a tune up.<br>  spark plugs?<br>  <br>  anything along those lines...<br>  <br>  i hope i helped you <br>  <br>  good luck :)|`|xRUZkFU9aa	Definitely check the battery!

ecOyy2PGaa	I think almost all cheap cars look the same and are horrible... a lot of people like them... by example, chevrolet optra, chevrolet corsa, and similar cars of toyota and volskwagen. <br>  <br>  I thinks its not really difficult to make a beautiful car and sell it at low prices, but the reason it never happens its because the industry dont want to do that.<br>  <br>  I guess they set the price of their cars according to what the car looks like too, so its not only a matter of cost or materials its a matter of perception and prestige.<br>  <br>  Besides the cheap cars mentioned above, there are the American cars, what ugly designs,... on the top of the ugliest designs there you have GENERAL MOTORS, with squared lines, its huge cars look like a box. But anyways americans love them. <br>  <br>  Proof of the poor design of general motors I think is that they are the dream of gangsters, and hip hop singers, (people with a bad sense of style)<br>  <br>  And the second proof is that the newborn russian car industry is practicing their designs with that general motors style, for one reason, because its easier to do some squared card rather than a lamborghini, what a mistake!<br>  <br>  Anyways, european cars are the best in design, <br>  Lamborghini reventon<br>  Ferrari Enzo<br>  KTM X-BOW<br>  McLaren F1<br>  Bugatti Veyron<br>  Ferrari 360 Spider<br>  Ferrari Zobin<br>  Mitsibushi Eclipse (Japan)<br>  Jaguar<br>  Bmw<br>  Peugeot<br>  Citroen<br>  Mercedes Benz<br>  etc....<br>  <br>  Not only European or Japanese cars are better in design than their american counterparts, but they are just better in everything... for almost 2 years in a row, magazines like consumer reports, have reported that... safety, performance, etc, american cars, are inferior in everything<br>  <br>  For making things worse for americans, it happens that russian trucks are one of the best in the paris dakar rally...|`|mWZ9BXIdaa	Yep, pretty much everything since early 2000.

You probably couldn't even measure a change in rear wheel horsepower by using premium over midgrade or even the 87 octane fuel.  You may notice a placebo effect in HP, however.<br>  <br>  Octane is the resistance to detonation.  If you have high resistance to detonation, you will have higher cylinder temperatures, so chances are, you'll be more prone to overheating with premium than with lower grade fuel.  <br>  <br>  Should you begin to detonate with a lower grade fuel, the Knock Sensors in your engine will tell the Powertrain Control Module, which will tell the ignition system to retard the ignition timing.  This will produce some reduction in power, but also save your engine.  This is all done "transparently" to the user.  If you are curious to know if you are running with retarded spark, plug a Tech1 into your ALDL and look at the engine parameters on the readout...  It will tell you the "total advance" It should be around 32* BTDC.  If it's in the teens, you've got problems.  <br>  <br>  Hope this helps,|`|RiQA4Epraa	yupp<br>  the V8s need premium<br>  the V6s need regular<br>  <br>  if you didnt want to pay more for gas, why would you even buy a V8 in the first place?|`|1xkc6Ktmaa	If it doesn't have engine modifications it's probably ok to run low octane gas. But id the engine temperatures rise too high you will begin to have problems. If there have been modifications to the engine you will quite possibly need to run high octane.|`|64d33b21525c267f9af9181ffa2d6014aa	The car was designed to run on 91-93 octane.  Reserve cooling and aluminum heads help deter detonation, but at 10.4:1 compression running 87 octane will invariably retard the timing.  It won't hurt anything, but it may be down on power and the fuel mileage may even suffer a bit.  I've heard of people that ran 87 in LT1 cars all the time with no issues and other that have said that their cars are way down on power and dropped 5-6 mpg.  Some motors respond differently.  Try running a tank of 87 in it and see how it performs.

If you're going to be biking a lot, I would suggest picking up<br>  Glenn's Complete Bicycle Repair Manual (a wonderful classic that i always recommend) or the Park Blue Book (which covers some newer items that Glenn's doesn't.  Otherwise, you'll either need to compensate when you're shifting (don't shift too far or it will happen again) or you'll have to bring it somewhere to tune it up.

UXAjzdl2aa	yes, i have seen pull pal, and i was shocked to see how much it is. with that said, you can always use a boat anchor, i ve done it, but let me give you an safety advice; also applies to pullpal, and any other device when pulled straight towards you;<br>  Please be careful, as these things could brake, come undone, and you will have a missal fly towards you. use a rope with no metal hooks on it, <br>  and if you have the choice, always, have this device or anchor positioned at a slight angle from your truck ( don't have it directly in front or directly behind you) if something does fly off, it will hit your truck at an angle, and it could be less damaging.|`|O4tp5yqyaa	Google pull pal<br>  the other old timer trick is to bury your spare after you tie off to it.

Do this test in a quiet place...if you hear nothing the pump is gone. If the pump works you will hear a distinct high pitched metallic humming for several seconds.<br>  <br>  Most likely it is the throttle position sensor that is shot.  A quick look at Forums for this car suggest the throttle position sensor is a more common failure.<br>  <br>  Also possible is a Mass Air Flow sensor failure, but normally a check engine light will come on if that is the case.<br>  <br>  All of these are simple fixes, that can use salvage parts (worth checking new prices though, sometimes they're  pretty close) and should cost no more than a couple hours labour.<br>  <br>  I recommend strongly that you do a little more online checking with more details of your problem though, as chances are you can get an exact diagnosis before heading to the mechanic's.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.ford-forums.com/ford-tempo/" rel="nofollow">http://www.ford-forums.com/ford-tempo/</a><br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.2carpros.com/makes/ford/tempo.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.2carpros.com/makes/ford/tempo...</a><br>  <br>  <a href="http://fordforum.com/forum/archive/index.php/f-39.html" rel="nofollow">http://fordforum.com/forum/archive/index...</a><br>  <br>  You seem to have your hands full, good luck!

AA12071655	Sport-tuned suspension - there are a lot of different settings in a suspension as well as different parts that can be used to achieve certain goals. The easiest way to look at is that a suspension is a compromise between handling and ride comfort: the more one goes in one direction, the less is available in the other direction. Sport-tuned means the suspension is set up more for performance than ride comfort. This generally equates to much better handling at the cost of some ride roughness.<br>  <br>  An aerodynamic front air dam is a chunk of body in the front, under the bumper. It is designed to use the force of the air to force the front end down, thus increasing traction. However, it is mostly a marketing tool - for such devices (including rear air dams, or spoilers) to have any actual effect the vehicle has to be traveling well above the legal speed limit. Looks cool though and it does have ducting that forces cool air onto the brakes which is a good thing.|`|addaf7237cf3d32190cfc96546e98709aa	Sport-tuned suspension means it is less comfortable, but handles better.<br>  <br>  Aerodynamic Front Air dam is for aerodynamics.

XLXncQu9aa	The government is partially to blame for this, but the sole responsibility is on the hospital itself.  Government should have a limited role.  The hospital should encourage the safety overall and place those kinds of markings in front of the hospital.  Its a shame that patients are endangered when crossing in hospital establishments.  The zebra crossing has the purpose of alerting drivers that pedestrians are crossing and should be given the right of way and the time to cross safely.  Without the markings drivers would not be aware.  So it should be encouraged but more so by the hospital officials.

All for around $2000 to $3000.  For $5000, you can get a whole WRX engine and ECU swap so I would just save up for that.  Not only will you have more power at that point but the potential for more is endless from there. Until then, just work on the suspension.
gstBWswfaa	You will have no problems with that system, Your alternator is probably around a 120 amp "v6 im guessing" which is what i have powering my 4 banger at 1000 watts RMS<br>  your v6 should be able to handel that easily or with a very small light dimming problem... its not THAT much power.|`|Ig3W5YZnaa	duralast|`|RQ7utEMBaa	HO alternator is the best option.

AA10789216	I think the original equipment tires were rated at 112 mph.

tfC8BQXOaa	Between $250 and $2500. If you want more precise, you need your social and all that crap!|`|f2b602340ec1c3f14c6da18edee430f0aa	Depends on where you live, your driving record, and how much coverage you want.|`|814lhxgiaa	It all depends on your driving history, how long you have had your license. You get discounts if you are in school and get about a 2.75 gpa and also get a discount if you have taken a safe driving class. Car insurance companies run  your social security to prove who you are and to see your credit history. If you have a much lower credit number due to bad credit cards, etc your rate will be higher. My suggestion would be to go to several different sites and get quotes. When they run your social it doesn't effect anything on your credit. I used to have progressive and it was $382 a month with a $500 deductible, So i tried www.Safeco.com and It went from $382 to $175.  So basically just look around and they need your numbers to prove who you are. Also you can get quotes form many sites without your Social number, but when you make an actual policy they will need it and in turn your rate could go higher or lower depending on your credit. Hope this makes sense? Good luck!

"you get what you pay for". Although, me and my brother have had several touchscreen dvd players and several brands from pyle to pioneer.

I was actually at walmart last night and they have made some nice upgrades and the pyle design is alot better than it used to be. They are up-to-date and look alot nicer than the previous models. Although they are sporting a new price tag of 600 dollars. For that kind of money you might as well throw 100-200 with it and go ahead and get a nicer brand like pioneer.

VC7PyH53aa	Have a 2000. Had it since it was new. Currently have about 110k miles on it. It's been a great car, runs great, plenty of power, comfortable on long trips, dependable.<br>  <br>  Downside - repairs are little pricey. 2000's and I believe 01's had alot of problems with ignition coils. One of mine failed around 50k miles. Makes the car run bad. Nissan usually doesn't just replace one because more than likely another will also fail. They replace all six. It costs apprx. $600.00 to $800.00 for the coils and installation. <br>  Check the car you're buying to see if the coils have been replaced.<br>  Also, problems with the O2 sensors. That's another pricey repair.<br>  I had to have two replaced, it was somewhere around $500.00.<br>  None of the problems are show stoppers, they won't keep the car from running but will keep the car from passing an emissions test. <br>  <br>  Another thing -- premium gas is recommended. It will run on regular but not as well and it will ping. You can get away most of the time with mid-grade but you won't get maximum performance. When gas was 4 bucks a gallon the premium cost was about .40 - .50 more per gallon than regular.<br>  <br>  <br>  It's been about 3 yrs since I had the sensors replaced and I've had nothing go wrong with the car.

AA12095978	Yes, any "leak" in a brake system automatically <br>  1) allows fluid to leak out<br>  and<br>  2) allows air into the system.<br>  the air in the lines eventually start to travel and can easily reach the master cylinder and cause braking issues.<br>  <br>  you just said the solution.. cut the lines, go get a compression sleeve and nut, and buy a piece of tubing from plumbing or autoparts store and a connector union for compression and plug yourself back in!<br>  then as a precaution..

Off-hand, I would say no. Many "chevy's" are really made by another company, like Suzuki, or Isuzu. Then, they are cheapened down to make more profit. When it comes to GM, profit is the most important thing. If you happen to get quality, safety, and efficiency, you are lucky. Many "Chevy's" were engineered so poorly that they reside in junk yards all acroos the country. the "x", "j" cars are good cases in point. If you want a "good" car, you are better off with a Honda or Toyota. Most of them are made in this country with American labor in American plants. Nobady can figure out where most GM cars come from. Some are made in Mexico (to save money), Hungary (to save money) and China (to save money). When the best you can get from a GM car is a 5 year warranty, I would say that even GM doesn't believe they are "good" cars. Buying American doesn't mean the same thing it used to, believe me. See J.D. Powers or Consumer Reports for better answers. If you ask me, GM sold the USA out a long time ago!!!|`|b299edc40bfec7da51e76575d6b08d9daa	yes they do, maintenance is the key

8GDBr2U9aa	You are assuming the dealer was aware of this. When buying a used car, it's up to the buyer to perform their due diligence and make sure the vehicle is appropriate BEFORE buying it. After you've bought it, it's too late. Driving and inspecting a car before the purchase is your only protection against problems like this.|`|Ihi0lR1Taa	They can't tell you anything they don't know.  They can't know that the car was in an accident if it wasn't reported by insurance or a police report.  The cars that they sell come from auctions and trade ins.  The only way they could know all about the car history is if they were the only owner of the cars they sell.  The only history they have on the vehicles they sell is what comes from the CarFax type reports.  Check CarFax.  If the CarFax report says that the car was in an accident then the dealer must have known about it.<br>  <br>  And in Arizona they are not required to tell you the history of the vehicle.   You, as a consumer can ask but they don't have to provide that information.  <br>  <br>  You did good by getting the car inspected first.  Many people make the mistake of not doing that.|`|v7XIFyHFaa	No.  It's perfectly legal.  The dealer is only required to tell you the car has been in an accident if you ask them.  If you do not ask, they do not have to tell you.  Now if you ask them and they lie to you it is illegal.|`|420WrT5uaa	the car is sold "as is"<br>  <br>  i dont think you can do anything about it , you should check the car before buying it<br>  <br>  good luck though|`|62cdabc33de92fc0cab4f5016db9f9bcaa	next time car-fax...and ask the DMV for any reports|`|3MTYGEbWaa	Dealers don't always know the condition of the cars they sell.

You apparently had the car inspected after the sale. The right time is BEFORE the sale.
gOQ5mZ7Xaa	Technically all of those cars are decent tuners/drifters. American muscle has been beginning to bring in the numbers now compared to the traditional Jap tuner, but the easiest and best car to drift with is an AE86 Toyota Corolla/Sprinter with the 4AGZE Supercharged engine. Nice and light, but the 4AGZE is Toyota's racing engine. Pretty high-revving, lots of torque. This car is the most popular for beginner drifters but it's a weapon when used in the right hands. Also Manual is better than Auto for drifting or any type of motorsport in particular. The Sprinter, being such a popular drifter, also has loads of parts available for you to chuck on it to make it handle better and go quicker. Out of your list the Nissan 240SX is the most popular that I have seen, the Mustang was born a natural drifter, the Supra (especially twin turbo) is a weapon for drag but not really drift, the Eclipse is not really that strong or that good handling (AWD lets it down for drifting), and the RX7 not only looks the shiz (although that WBK is going to be costing you more than the car itself, better off looking at RE Amemiya bits), the 13B Twin Turbo is a beast when fed the right parts.<br>  <br>  AWD is also starting to rise up in the D1 drift scene. Team Orange used to have two WRXs in the team but now theres an MY07 Subaru WRX STi and a Mitsubishi Lancer Evolution IX (both AWD), and they're doing pretty sweet.<br>  <br>  And finally any model Nissan Skyline is a great drifter (Especially R32 GT-R with it's ATTESA AWD system that only puts the power to the front wheels when it needs it). The RWD ones you'll find are easier to drift being RWD (duh), but there are loads of people that shoe-horn in an RB26DETT to get some extra power of it.|`|AA10346371	For drifting you want something with lots of power and rear wheel drive, preferably something with a V8.  Then you screw up the rear suspension and put on hard compound rear tires so the rear end gets poor traction.<br>  <br>  Drifting on the street is pointless.  You are putting innocent bystanders at risk.<br>  <br>  Instead of building a pointless drifting car, why not go see what your local race track has to offer.<br>  <br>  On a race track you can go as fast as you want without putting innocent bystanders at risk.<br>  <br>  You will have no trouble with the law.<br>  <br>  You will be on a track with a bunch or your friends with similar equipment and abilities.  Drifting on the street is not competitive. The person with the biggest checkbook will have the best car.  <br>  <br>  There will be a rule book so there will be a level playing field and your equipment will be safe.  There will be regular inspections to make sure no one is cheating.<br>  <br>  There will be prize money to help you with your expenses.  Drifting on the street doesn't pay anything.<br>  <br>  There will be an ambulance on site to take care of you when you crash.  Help will arrive in seconds.  If you were to crash while drifting you could die before help arrives.<br>  <br>  Who knows, you may even get some fans.<br>  <br>  You might want to checkout the local race track before you start building your car.  You can get a copy of the rule book to make sure you are making your modifications correctly.  Or you may want to buy a used race car for your first car.  This car should already be legal. You could use this one until you learn the ropes.|`|KAkiPY3kaa	Go with the RX-7... second or third gen... and never pass up a skyline.

I have an '08 Elantra and I have the same sensor.  If you have the GLS model, your tires need to be at about 38 pounds of air.  It is actually required by law that all 2008 and newer models have a Tire Pressure Sensor.  There is a sensor in each wheel that monitors your air pressure in your tires.  If you get low enough the light will go on.  Just put some air in your tires and it will go off.

If you hear a firm click, go to step 9 if you have an on-starter solenoid; go to steps 10 and 11 if you have a remote-mounted solenoid. If you hear a weak click or repeated click sounds, go to the next step. <br>  Step6Unplug the small control circuit wire at the solenoid terminal. If there are two small wires, disconnect the one marked with an S, otherwise check the wiring diagram for your particular vehicle to locate this wire. <br>  Step7Connect a jumper wire to the battery positive terminal. As you bring the other jumper wire’s end in touch with the solenoid’s control circuit terminal you should hear a solid click; if you do not hear any sounds or hear a weak or chattering sound, make sure the solenoid is properly grounded and there is no corrosion or other substance preventing a good ground. Repeat the test. If you still don’t hear a solid click, replace the solenoid. <br>  Step8Unplug the small control circuit wire at the solenoid terminal. Ask your assistant to turn the key to start. Using a voltmeter, test for voltage at the control circuit wire. If the meter reads 0 volts, there is an open in that part of the circuit preventing the solenoid from operating the starter. Locate and fix the open. <br>  Step9Ask your assistant to turn the key to start. Check for a voltage drop between the solenoid's battery terminal and the starter motor strap. The voltage drop should be no more than 0.2 volts, otherwise replace the solenoid. Make sure the battery cable is well connected to the solenoid. Remember, this step is only for an on-starter solenoid.

Gas in the gastrointestinal tract has only two sources. It is either swallowed air or it is produced by bacteria that normally inhabit the intestines, primarily the colon. Swallowed air is rarely the cause of excessive flatulence. The usual source is the production of excessive gas by intestinal bacteria. The bacteria produce the gas (hydrogen and/or methane) when they digest foods, primarily sugars and polysaccharides (e.g., starch, cellulose), that have not been digested during passage through the small intestine. Sugars that are commonly poorly digested (maldigested) and malabsorbed are lactose, sorbitol, and fructose. Lactose is the sugar in milk. The absence of the enzyme lactase in the lining of the intestines, which is a genetic trait, causes the maldigestion. Lactase is important because it breaks apart the lactose so that it can be absorbed. Sorbitol is a commonly used sweetener in low calorie foods. Fructose is a commonly used sweetener in all types of candies and drinks.<br>  <br>  Starches are another common source of intestinal gas. Starches are polysaccharides that are produced by plants and are composed of long chains of sugars. Common sources of different types of starch include wheat, oats, potatoes, corn, and rice. Rice is the most easily digested starch and little undigested rice starch reaches the colon and the colonic bacteria. Accordingly, the consumption of rice produces little gas. In contrast, the starches in wheat, oats, potatoes, and, to a lesser extent, corn, all reach the colon and the bacteria in substantial amounts. These starches, therefore, result in the production of appreciable amounts of gas.<br>  <br>  The starch in whole grains produces more gas than the starch in refined (purified) grains. Thus, more gas is formed after eating foods made with whole wheat flour than with refined wheat flour. This difference in gas production probably occurs because the fiber present in the whole grain flour slows the digestion of starch as it travels through the small intestine. Much of this fiber is removed during the processing of whole grains into refined flour. Finally, certain fruits and vegetables, for example, cabbage, also contain poorly digested starches that reach the colon and result in the formation of gas.<br>  <br>  Most vegetables and fruits contain cellulose, another type of polysaccharide that is not digested at all as it passes through the small intestine. However, unlike sugars and other starches, cellulose is used only very slowly by colonic bacteria. Therefore, the production of gas after the consumption of fruits and vegetables usually is not great unless the fruits and vegetables also contain sugars or polysaccharides other than cellulose.<br>  <br>  Small amounts of air are continuously being swallowed and bacteria are constantly producing gas. Contractions of the intestinal muscles normally propel the gas through the intestines and cause the gas to be expelled. Flatulence (passing intestinal gas) prevents gas from accumulating in the intestines. However, there are two other ways in which gas can escape the intestine. First, it can be absorbed across the lining of the intestine into the blood. The gas then travels in the blood and ultimately is excreted in the breath. Second, gas can be removed and used by certain types of bacteria within the intestine. In fact, most of the gas that is formed by bacteria in the intestines is removed by other bacteria in the intestines. (Thank goodness!)|`|MgE20ylkaa	you could change your diet and eat and drink slower. When you drink especially carbonated drinks, don't gulp it down for this causes more air to enter your stomach. Also try avoiding foods that can most likely cause gas, like dairy products (milk, cheese), onions, cabbage, apples, corn etc. Try eating bananas, eggs, and rice, to name a few. Also, if none of that works, try over-the-counter meds like gas-x or something similar to that :)|`|kIpDDVc9aa	Try not to eat too much fibre (for example, beans).

The harness will fit in the white and black adapter i see coming from the car and on the other end of the harness will be all the wire for power, speaker positive negative etc. you just connect the wire with the wire coming out of the radio. make sure you connect the right wires together there should be direction on the radio and the harness will have it written on it. <br>  <br>  when your done it should look something like this <br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.team-integra.net/images/BAEC1978-D3A7-4405-AB2D-2761DC15A96D/articles/morningz/g3headunit/15_harness.jpg" rel="nofollow">http://www.team-integra.net/images/BAEC1...</a><br>   the big white adapter will fit in the car and the little white adapter will fit in the radio.<br>  this is just an example your may look a little different depending on the car|`|1xkc6Ktmaa	You should be able to get a harness for your vehicle that will allow you to wire in a new stereo.

If you are looking at sport bikes you'll notice the physical size from at 600-750-1000 isn't going to change significantly but you really don't need more than the power from a 600 especially if you are at the point you need to be asking this question.  <br>  I mostly ride an 1100 goldwing, but have riden a bike as small as a 250 rebel, You'll notice you feel more stable and comfortable on a 600+.  Have a look at something like an older Honda CB750.  They are reliable, inexpensive and an all around decent bike to start on<br>  <br>  For the dirt bike you could ride anything 230cc and up.|`|O8rqfq3Daa	If i was you I would go with a Harley-Davidson dresser, Electra glide classic, roadking, fat boy, etc...

There are exceptions though. If you are in Australia you are required by law to have a registered vehicle off-road for third party insurance reasons. Initially I could not understand this but it does make sense that if you crash into someone and injure them or damage their property then your third party insurance can cover the accident. Bike wise it needs to be registered and like a lot of riders in O.Z they remove their blinkers and top mount their number plate on their rear guard to prevent it getting ripped off when riding.<br>  <br>  There is the case of riding occasionally on the road to get to where you need to go. I think within reason if you weren't riding miles and miles along a back road where you could be a hindrance to traffic then it would be O.K but if you want to ride using the road for transport reasons with your unregistered bike then this might pose some problems.<br>  <br>  I hope this helps.<br>  <br>  <br>  Troy

HZ7CNcbWaa	Current laser speed detectors are only active for the fraction of a second that a police officer "lases" your vehicle.  This only happens if s/he decides you might be speeding and pulls the gun's trigger to check.  Unless the copper is in the act of checking your speed, the radar detector has nothing to detect.<br>  <br>  Even if the officer is checking your speed, a laser beam is very narrow, and is still likely to go undetected.  So at best the most high tech laser detectors will maybe let you know you've already been caught<br>  <br>  Most likely, these guys see you driving a reasonable speed while approaching their traps, so they never "lase" your vehicle. Hence your detector is working fine, just nothing to detect!|`|AA11264416	well cops don't have their radar gun on all the time, if the gun isn't on then its no signal for your radar detector to detect, if its all state troopers then they're guns could have some kind of block built in so the radar detector doesn't pick up the signal, i used to have a Cobra radar detector and it did go off if a cop was near sometimes but most of the time it went off there was no cop in sight and it's also gone off in the same spot everytime i passed it so it seemed like it was picking up some kind of signal from an automatic door because the spot it between 2 stores both with automatic doors so i got rid of the radar detector<br>  <br>  roger - every radar detector i've seen is a radar/laser detector, plus he's talking about the speed radar guns|`|b337f264d9542116059d28a7e5433cc3aa	I think you've answered your own question there.<br>  <br>  <br>  You have a RADAR detector.<br>  <br>  They have a LASER speed gun.<br>  <br>  Two different systems.

Also, I was in your situation once (trying to convince the parents), just use this: the whole reason why you drive is so that you could be independent, that's why you need a car.  With a car, you would not only be independent, but you will also begin to acclimate to adulthood and the responsibilities that come with it.

AEdF3k3xaa	i read the other answers and they don't answer your question that great.. the answer is yes. it does increase your horsepower. Mufflers, catalytic converters, and pipes all just create resistance. Thats why drag cars are always running open headers... to get the most power. i have 1 cat and 1 muffler on my car and lots of pipes.. i dumped my exhaust right after the cat (don't wanna attract too much police) and my car is a lot more powerful. Hope i helped!|`|k10O80XYaa	only if the headers are tuned for that car. other than that its only noise. length of exhaust and headers flow can give more horsepower.|`|2S2Wfiykaa	yes,the better the flow of exhaust, the better your horse power.not much tho....|`|AA12261615	they only help you on an engine designed to run wide open on a race track,if your running a street machine with open headers and stock engine chances are you may see or feel a decrease in horse power,it will sound like its producing more ,but in reality it wont help it to run open headers on it,good luck.|`|7HDWtqhOaa	No not really and you would need a dyno to prove it. But you need a way for the pulse signal not to get sucked back up the header. you also need to equal out both right and left head exhaust banks, you also need a little presure in the system so the engine and headers can"push" the exhaust out<br>  For driving you need system, notice a stock car dosen't use open headers<br>  For drag racing yes, quarter mile you see open headers unless that class requires mufflers

a919ffaf7b39c58d58f4680cb8cc3324aa	As always the tire load and inflation sticker in the door is correct.  The problem is you have the wrong sized tires on your truck.  <br>  <br>  The correct size for your truck is "P235/75R15 XL 108S".  These are considered an "Extra Load Range" that feature a higher maximum load carrying capacity and a higher maximum inflation pressure than the Standard Load Range P235/75R15 105S sized tires that were incorrectly fitted to your truck.<br>  <br>  On a standard load tire the maximum load is 2,028 pounds at 35 psi and maximum inflation will be either 35 or 44 psi depending on brand and model.  Most newer tire models can go to 44 psi but you gain nothing above 35 psi.<br>  <br>  An Extra Load tire has a higher maximum load carrying capacity of 2,183 pounds at 41 psi and a higher maximum inflation limit that usually 50 or 51 psi depending on brand and model.  <br>  <br>  Given that your current tires have insufficient load carrying capacity and insufficient maximum inflation pressure for the vehicle I would recommed replacing them.|`|mwu6aJuyaa	Sounds like you don't have the right tires for your truck. A tire doesn't care what type of vehicle it's on, it's just a tire. So the manufacturer of the tire will put on the maximum PSI for that tire. So that should be the upper most limit you follow.<br>  <br>  That being said, because a tire can be on many different vehicles, each vehicle has a pressure rating that is specific to that car's attributes. based on suspension, weight distribution and geometry, the car manufacturer has calculated (for the tire size designed for the vehicle) what the pressure should be to ensure that the contact patch on the ground is the right size. If you inflate more than that, your contact patch will be too small and could affect performance. Likewise, less pressure will result in the same. So your truck's rating should be what you use. Based on all the specs of the truck, the tires should be infalted to manufacturer specs. however you tires are not rated to go that high. Get tires made for your truck|`|6rIp7yIZaa	Sounds like you are on the wrong scale or your tyre was all ready damaged it takes allot of pressure for a tyre to bulge and if it did bulge out you could have done damage to the tyre. Also if it says 41 on the door and max 36 on the tyre you have the wrong tyres on your car / truck I would go with 28 psi for any rims 18 - 20 inch but the bigger the tyre the less pressure required.<br>  <br>  Get it checked out in a shop the tyres can make the difference between life and death .|`|62cdabc33de92fc0cab4f5016db9f9bcaa	the cars psi is only listed for weight reasons due to the gross vehicle weight. the tire psi is what that tire can hold before bulging. call a tire company or a dealership that serves your make and model and ask if the right tires are on your truck. I wouldn't race around though. be safe and good luck<br>  <br>  dicky|`|ym5pfnyIaa	That's a hard call. If the tire's are the factory one's I'd stick with what the doorjam sticker says, but if they are new one's I'd go with what the tire's say. I think your best choice would be to ask a mechanic or a trustworthy friend.|`|iwVUl4Jkaa	ok, first of all, your most likely running radial tires. they WILL bulge out from the bottom no matter how much air you put in it. 2nd, NEVER over inflate the tires. go with whats on the sidewall. 3rd, the CORRECT way to make sure they are inflated properly is  NEVER inflate them when they are hot. they WILL be hot AND increase by 4 pounds after the first 3 minutes or the first mile, which ever comes first. to correct them, pump them up to 40 pounds, drop them down to 20 pounds and re inflate them to their max. inflation that's ON THE SIDEWALL. this is the ONLY way you'll get the CORRECT pressure in them.

VEIkVDtIaa	if the window lock switch is 'off' and the three other windows don't work then the problem is with the window lock switch and not with the other switches.  your dealer is guessing.<br>  <br>  I'm sure you've tried the window lock switch in both positions(?) up and down(?) typically that is the only thing that will prevent the other windows from working.<br>  <br>  the windows operate on a multiplex system from the driver's main switch to each of the other three windows over a LAN system.  each of the other three switches has a unique address so if there where a problem with an output only the one with the bad address would not respond.  if the main switch were not working then the driver's door window wouldn't open either.<br>  <br>  the only thing in common is the lock switch for the window that opens the circuit to the other windows.  if that switch is burnt out (open circuit) it wouldn't matter what position the switch were in; it simply would disable the other three windows.  I'm sure the window lock switch is your problem<br>  <br>  the switch is called the "Main Switch" and should be replaceable separately from the master switch on the driver's door panel<br>  <br>  hope that helps
XxpyRC6vaa	You should also consider that such a car may be expensive to insure. Check your insurance rates before buying one, for example here - autoinsurance.maclenet.com|`|mAZi1eH7aa	A little high priced for a 2000. But they are a good car with a very good reputation. If the warranty is thrown in and the mileage is very low, it may be worth it.
3DnMYAjzaa	Thats alot of miles. Depends on whether or not they were highway or city miles, and how well maintained it was.|`|c11fee07c98ac2e271f2ab5acd400781aa	Not too many miles at all.<br>  <br>  The car doesn't know it has that many miles on it nor does it know how old it is.<br>  <br>  If the car has been taken care of and your mechanic's inspection turns out fine, drive it until it rusts away...|`|3MTYGEbWaa	It's not the mileage that is important. It's the actual condition of the car, as determined by a mechanic's inspection. Some cars with 150,000 miles are in great condition and will go another 150K. Others with only 50K miles that have been driven hard and improperly maintained are junk. Mustangs with stick shifts are particularly susceptible to have been driven hard and not maintained properly.|`|hLOYwnsUaa	That's not too bad. The average amount of miles put on a car is 15,000 miles a year. That times 3 years old.. Means it should have around 45,000 on it. But that is okay too.  I'd say get it..|`|GP1KPyekaa	depends what the price is . that is alot of miles for an 06 but if the price is under 10 k i'd say grab it

The diplomatic plate that your link shows would take maximum Taka 4000/-, for 2-plates (front & rear).<br>  <br>  Since you want to buy the frontal only, the price would be halved. You can show them the design of your choice and they would gladly comply, but that may entail some extra money.<br>  <br>  PS. There are many such shops making License Plates located on Int'l Airport Road at Chairman Bari, Banani (near Dhaka Cantonment Banani entrance gate). Scout these and make your choice.<br>  <br>  Happy driving!
4biGrjPkaa	No, leave it alone. The kits will tell you all sorts of nonsense, they make little difference and invalidate your warranty. The little 1.4 is built for economy not speed, trade it in for a 2.0 HDI if you want a faster diesel!!|`|ALxvsSWiaa	I know its stating the obvious, but why not simply buy a 1.6 diesel? The kit will invalidate your insurance. It's in the same league insurance wise as go faster wheels, or a loud exhaust that will make you go quicker, apparantly.

b2J1bY3Zaa	AIDS|`|HFrsH9MRaa	Sometimes, the oil pressure light will come on if the idle speed of the engine is too low. If it is coming on while you are driving, then you may have a problem. The first suspect is a clogged up oil pressure relief valve. Do an engine oil flush and follow with a change to a good synthetic oil, like Mobil One. If you had your radiator flushed, I hope you have the good sense to use a better ant-freeze than Dex-Cool. There is a major lawsuit pending against GM for the chemicals in the coolant that over time may dissolve intake manifolds and gaskets. If I were you, I would only be using Mercedes Benz coolant in this car. It is tried and true, and will last for over 100,000 miles with no clotting problems or meltdown issues. As far as your light problem, perhaps you should clean out your throttle body and idle air control valve. It makes a BIG difference what kind of oil you changed the oil with. If it was shop oil or bulk oil, I would be suspect. Good Luck!!!

Check that the idler bearing and the water pump bearing roll smoothly. Either one may of binded up. Also. When you install the belt DON'T USE VISE GRIPS TO HOLD IT IN PLACE.

B3YJTO0naa	-Drivers licenses are done by the states. Every state has slightly different rules, but generally you have to take a written test first. Assuming you are over 18 and have experience driving you can then take the behind the wheel test (if not you have to get an instructional permit first). The driving part of the test includes general driving on city streets, parrallel parking, and 90 degree backing. It is scored by points. Generally if you can parallel park within about 6 inches of the curb, and back the car into a parking spot, the rest of the test is easy and you should pass. After you pass you get a temporary paper lisence you can use imeadiately and they send you your real liscence in a few weeks. You can check with the DMV for the state you are living in for specific information.
8pSr5c1laa	i dont know about your state but in sc at 15 you read the little handbook and go apply for your permit and if you get it then you can drive as long as a parent or gaurdian is with you. then you take a drivers ed course so when 6 months after having your permit you can go apply for your restricted or conditional liscense.

B3YJTO0naa	-I would look at the Ford Taurus X, the GMC Acadia, the Mazda 5, and the Toyota Highlander Hybrid. The Highlander gets considerably better gas mileage but it also costs a lot more. Of the others the Mazda 5 is the smallest but still has 3 rows. It gets pretty good gas mileage and is pretty inexpensive. The Taurus X, and Acadia are larger, more comfortable, and more expensive.|`|1nZsKMUOaa	Here are three good choices:<br>  <br>  - Ford Mustang V6 for "Power"<br>  - Honda Accord Sedan LX 5-spd MT for "Fashion"<br>  - Honda Civic Sedan EX 5-spd MT w/ navigation system for "Navigation"<br>  <br>  I hope that helped  :)|`|7f3559ac6e13d1f4904fbf38bd395141aa	Some sort of wagon, with a third row, or a mini SUV, or crossover vehicle.

mCAxacfQaa	If you got it through a dealership you can call them and ask them for the info they keep your info when you buy it. Everything except for the mileage (kilometers done).<br>  <br>  Otherwise the specs for the engine and power should be online and you should have the registration number and date when you bought it on the paperwork you got from the seller.<br>  <br>  The mileage for a bike like that should be a well educated guess since I don't think that kind of bike monitors that.|`|LKB8oSfaaa	How about take your bike off of Ebay, and post it on Craigslist. "www.craigslist.com" That way you wont have to fill in all that info. You post what you want to say,how much you expect to get and what you know about it. Put a couple of pictures up there and submit. Wait for your responses by email, or leave your phone number for people to contact you.|`|YupMCYHlaa	Much of the model information can be found at bikez.com, just enter the model number.

Take it on the lease expiration date and get a ride home. The dealer just does not want another car he can't sell on the lot. Most dealers are in dire straights right now. Lots of unsold inventory and no one to buy it.|`|2ee9ba3f8fa52a8c3bd583c6f12f11b8aa	Perhaps the dealer went out of business.

EhyT1GnHaa	It would probably be cheaper to get 2 used doors  and get them repainted, cause if you put new handles in the door's not to sure how the shaved one's were done could be lot's of work, and also you would still have to paint the door's anyway|`|4MtR8MLpaa	That is interesting. Do they have to just be there or do they have to be functional as well?<br>  <br>  Yes they can be reinstalled. I'd go to a junk yard to get the parts and while there I would measure or make a template for the size and location of the hole in the door. Really all you do is to undo all that the guy did to shave them. Fortunately it is a lot easier to make a hole then to create a plug, weld it, grind smooth, and then refinish the paint.

ewbuVeTTaa	If you want a car, I'd do what others have said: Save your money till you have enough to buy cash. If working overtime is an option at your job, use it. If not, if your schedule allows for it and if you have the stamina, work two or more jobs if you can. If you can't work two jobs or more, I'd save for six months. <br>  <br>  $200 a month isn't a lot of money to save, but in six months, that can net $1200, enough to buy a beater car like a 1990s era Toyota Corolla in decent, not perfect shape, a 1990s era Honda Civic or Accord in again, in decent, not perfect shape, you might also find a used Volvo 240, 740, or 760 for $1200. <br>  <br>  Be advised that $1200 is not going to get you a car that needs nothing, you will be making minor or medium repairs to it, which can be anything from new brakes to at worst a new head gasket, transmission or even an engine. That is the risk you take buying any car used. <br>  <br>  That money can buy some bargains if you know where to look and shop around.  <br>  <br>  I would avoid dealers that promise buy here, pay here or we finance everyone. While that is another way to get a car the intrerest rate you'd pay, the total loan amount would far exceed what you can afford and would damage your credit further.<br>  <br>  I would be looking on craigslist, ebay, the local paper classifieds, autotrader, or even the thrifty nickel or equivalent in your area and shop around.

The only thing that I think may possibly be a problem would be if the tire has a different speed rating.  Tires with different speed ratings have different handling characteristics even though they are the same size.
RbsRpcIyaa	Not to lecture, but...<br>  <br>  If you can't afford it with cash, then you probably can't afford it. There are some agencies that do finance exotics, but most do indeed require a pretty substantial downpayment and excellent credit, plus they want to make sure you have the assets to cover the cost of the car in case of anything wrong happening. <br>  <br>  I'm assuming you're 21-22 based on your screen name. If that's the case, insurance alone (and you don't call Geico for insurance on a Lambo) is going to be as much if not more than your payment would be. <br>  <br>  Upkeep and maintenance on a Lambo will run you $35-40K per year. <br>  <br>  There's a reason that only the super-rich drive them.|`|RWjvcCYoaa	It depends on the strength of your credit, your bank account, investment portfolio and the security of your present job.

Also when people pick their nose-YUK!|`|31Ttgqlbaa	Mine is when people stay in the left lane on the interstate while not passing and won't speed up or get over when I'm behind them. And also, when I'm in the right lane, they drive or approach the side of my car in the left lane for mile upon mile. I say if you're going to pass me then pass me or get behind me. And then when I approach slow moving traffic ahead, I'm forced to slow down so they can FINALLY pass me. I believe traffic on the interstate should keep right except to pass. I also don't like drivers who pass me and then slow down when they get back in the right lane. If drivers are not going to go faster than my speed, then don't pass me. <br>  <br>  And if I'm on a 2 lane road, I don't mind being passed, but when someone passes me and then turns off ahead within a mile, then I don't see a point in passing me in the first place. Just to get home 10 seconds sooner?<br>  <br>  I don't like drivers who hit the brakes hard because the traffic light turns yellow in front of them when they could safely continue through. If a driver has to stop hard for a traffic light, then you're close enough to go through. The only exception is if they are going slow (20 mph), then stopping is fine. But when you're going 45 mph, then why stop so quickly when they can easily go through during that 3 second window of the yellow light.<br>  <br>  I don't like drivers who brake while going down a hill.<br>  <br>  Drivers who pull out in front of me going slow. If they speed up after pulling out, then it doesn't usually bother me. But I don't like to brake hard for someone who pulled out in front of me when I look in my rear view mirror and don't see anybody behind me. Couldn't wait another few seconds?<br>  <br>  I don't like being cut off on the interstate. If people make lane changes in front of me going close to my speed, then that's fine. But I don't like to brake for someone who moved in front of me in my lane, which is when my speed was at least 10 miles faster than theirs.<br>  <br>  I also don't like drivers who don't use a turn signal to turn when I'm behind them. It's like I'm invisible to them.|`|0b508e8a46ceb076d498c94707fa4b1aaa	I hate it when people get right up on your bumper and stay on you while driving 70 miles an hour.

FwnwOEQ7aa	To decide whether or not to open an insurance claim in regards to rate increase is going to depend on how long your daughter has been driving. If she is a new driver and you have the money to repair the vehicle on you own I definately would. Claims remain chargable on the moving violations reports for 3 years, so especially if she doesn't have many years driving exp (less than 3-4) I would reccomend avoiding the claim at all costs! <br>  <br>  I know we purchase insurance to avoid paying $2K out of pocket but I can cofidently say that you will prob end up paying more than that on insurance premium in the next 3 years with a new driver carrying an accident. <br>  <br>  Be careful though because if you dont report the accident to the DMV and the other driver does you can get your license suspended!

The best thing to do for your car is to use ONLY synthetic oil, and change the spark plugs using Bosch Platinum or Nippondenso Iridium.

However, there are many brand with much higher performance, like Ferrari, Lamborghini, Maserati, and Porsche.<br>  <br>  If you're after a good, durable SUV, the best two would be Jeep and Land Rover (assuming Ronge Ranger means Land Rover's Range Rover models). Ford, Nissan, Toyota, and Volkswagen also make good off-roaders.<br>  <br>  If you want luxury, BMW and Audi are at the top again. However, there are several brands that are even better, like Bentley, Jaguar, Lexus, Maybach, Mercedes-Benz, and Rolls-Royce.<br>  <br>  If you want a good cheap car, then Hyundai and Saturn are your best bets. Of course, you can find a Ford, Kia, or Suzuki for just as little, and sometimes it's a better car for the price.<br>  <br>  If you want a van, then I'd say either Dodge or Honda, which make two of the top-scoring minivans. Of course, there are other good minivans out there too, from Hyundai, Kia, and Toyota.<br>  <br>  If you want a truck, then it's Dodge and Nissan in this list. However, the Chevrolets, Fords, GMCs, and Toyotas are rated higher for fullsize trucks, and the Toyotas are rated higher in compact pickups.<br>  <br>  If you're after reliability, the best would be Honda and Hyundai. But, Ford, Subaru, and Toyota are all more reliable than those two.<br>  <br>  It would help if you narrowed it down a little more. Also, work on your spelling. I think Ronge Ranger is Land Rover's Range Rover models, and I'm assuming Misobechi is actually Mitsubishi, or possibly Mitsuoka (not entirely positive on that one). Also, Audi and Nissan have only one "i", Chrysler has an "h" as the second letter, and BMW is all capitals.<br>  <br>  I hope this has answered your question. If you have any more, please feel free to ask.|`|b299edc40bfec7da51e76575d6b08d9daa	you didn't list Chevy my first choice but I guess Dodge and you can't go wrong with a beamer

Buyers could choose from standard and extended wheelbases, and three- and four-door bodies. The three-door body disappeared in 2000, while only the long-wheelbase model was available in 2005. Seven-passenger "modular" seating with individually removable chairs was standard, while eight-passenger capacity and middle-row captain's chairs were optional.<br>  <br>  Standard features included antilock brakes, front side airbags (starting in 1998), a tilt steering wheel and an acceptable quota of cupholders and storage bins. Traction control, a power-sliding door, rear seat audio and climate controls, and a load-leveling suspension were options. As its life progressed, features like leather seating, rear parking assist, OnStar and satellite radio became available. A Warner Bros. special edition featuring special badges and a VHS entertainment system (later DVD) was offered from 2000-'03. Although initially satisfied with Venture's fit and finish, we eventually saw it as increasingly cheap and as just one area where Chevy's minivan was being outclassed by a new generation of competition.<br>  <br>  The Venture's safety was also put into question by the IIHS' frontal offset crash test, which slapped a poor rating on the minivan's Pontiac Trans Sport clone. Although it did just fine in the NHTSA's full-frontal crash test, other minivans at the time did better at handling the added structural stresses of an offset collision. However, the Venture was the first minivan to offer front side airbags as standard equipment, while standard antilock brakes and optional all-wheel-drive improved traction.<br>  <br>  During its first few years on sale in the late-1990s, the Venture was our top pick in the minivan segment. But once the next millennium dawned, so did other, more attractive family haulers ? particularly those from foreign manufacturers. Although a well-equipped Venture could present a good bargain, it would be a wise idea to shop newer minivan designs that have better safety ratings.

I have owned three Hondas and they are extremely reliable cars.  The Accords are roomier, but the Civics are a little sportier and will be less expensive.

knd9yvPSaa	One of the major reasons given for implementing modern roundabouts (which aren't the same as the traffic circles that went in places like DC and New York back in the 60s and 70s) instead of standard intersections is improved safety.  Because of the way the approaches to the circle are shaped, there's fewer ways to crash at a circle than at a 4-way or T-intersection.  At a traffic circle you can sideswipe another car or you can rear-end another car, but that's pretty much it.  At a 4-way or T-intersection, you can rear-end another car, you can sideswipe another car, and most importantly you can broadside another car and have a right-angle crash or you can have a head-on crash (with someone turning left from the opposite direction).  Those last two categories are completely eliminated at a traffic circle, since there's no way that vehicles' paths can cross in that manner.  Since those are generally the most severe sorts of crashes with the highest speed differentials, traffic circles' lower rates of overall crashes are due to having physically prevented the majority of severe (injury and fatality) crashes from happening.  Arizona's DOT has a nice webpage, <a href="http://www.azdot.gov/CCPartnerships/Roundabouts/index.asp," rel="nofollow">http://www.azdot.gov/CCPartnerships/Roun...</a> that has a pair of graphics showing why this is.  And there's been a few studies (one's summarized by the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety at <a href="http://www.iihs.org/externaldata/srdata/docs/sr3505.pdf)" rel="nofollow">http://www.iihs.org/externaldata/srdata/...</a> that have found this is the case in the real world.<br>  <br>  There's also said to be advantages due to being able to constantly keep traffic flowing, but that's going to depend in part on the volume of traffic and the number of lanes involved.  Basically, a roundabout's a collection of right-turn-only intersections: turn right to get into the circle, turn right to get out of the circle.  And as we all know, when you do a right-turn you only have to stop long enough to make sure there isn't another car barreling down on you from the left and there isn't someone you'll hit as soon as you make the turn.  That is to say, you only have to stop in order to yield, otherwise you don't have to stop at all.  That's the case at roundabouts, which are controlled by yield signs (ok, a few places have been putting in signalized roundabouts in recent years, but that's not good engineering and they shouldn't be doing it).  So, with a roundabout there's never any of those annoying "There was nobody around but the light was red so I had to stop anyway" situations.<br>  <br>  That's not to say a roundabout's always appropriate.  Near the top of a hill or on a steep incline the topography makes them a bad idea, and you don't want to stick one in the middle of a system of coordinated signals (those are signals that are timed together) since that will mean the roundabout gets cars in thick clumps instead of a steady flow, and roundabouts don't do as well with clumps.  Also, if  you have very high pedestrian volumes, they don't do so well.  With low or medium volumes, they can be a good thing because they give pedestrians all the safety benefits of one-way intersections (cars are only coming from one direction instead of two), but too many pedestrians can gum up the works.|`|5XYlHv6Paa	The benefits are that you can drive around them for hours if you're so inclined.

That vehicle is fuel injected. If there is any air present, it will be gone after a few ignition cycles.

Modern sport bikes are frequently totaled just because of bodywork damage from dropping the bike.<br>   Have a knowledgeable mechanic inspect the bike before you buy it.

That may be why the seller is selling it?|`|PJq4ugEqaa	It may say it's totalled but it might have just had some damage to the plastic enclousures around the bike, insurance companies can call any bike totaled even with a little crack in the headlight. Go for it if it's for a cheap price. Don't buy it for retail

Go for it!|`|EGKeYd0Waa	i started with a honda rancher 350 es 4x4 for me the 350 is a minimum and 4 wheel drive is a necessity in my terrain i am 14 now and have moved up to a Honda rincon 700 which now when i ride the rancher it feels like riding a little kid bike and the suspension sucks on it because it only has one shock on the axle. so i highly suggest get something with 4x4 and nothing older than an 05 o4 pushing it|`|eYtgcHwkaa	yea, you'll be fine|`|19210ea4297045e16871c0f3287825d1aa	get it!
ttbXQEJ8aa	Yes you can, but it is much better to use a 1/2 amp trickle charger.|`|09658fd4d02a5d3573ab00d1116b0c86aa	yes, dont let it charge more than 24 hours tho.. also check the distilled water in all the cells before charging|`|687852ecae21fabd1dfd4f89a2eefd48aa	You bet.  I would prefer an automatic charger, (one that has a meter on it - they will automatically scale back to 0 when the battery is charged).<br>  <br>  If you use a manual charger - you must watch it closely or you can ruin it.<br>  <br>  A full charge on a 12v is 12.66V  if you have a digital meter to test it.<br>  <br>  Make sure the battery is full, (liquid must cover the lead plates in the battery)  If not - add only water, (distilled or de-mineralized only - never tap water).<br>  <br>  If the bike is unused for a time - disconnect the neg terminal.  Charge every 30 days.  If it becomes run down - do not start it to charge it  -  It takes a hundred miles to fully charge it.  Let the charger do it for pennies and you can tell, by the meter, when it is charged.|`|eYtgcHwkaa	yes, check it frequently while charging and keep a jug of distilled water handy. Make sure the battery is topped off with distilled water, not tap water, before charging|`|AA11259435	Most motorcycle chargers i've seen go up to 2 amp. You should be fine, but be sure not to overcharge it

gstBWswfaa	honestly i dont even want to answer this....<br>  Why did you pick hifonics POS subwoofers?<br>  they are SUCHHHHHH ****...|`|bADgVLswaa	One large mono block amp capable of handling a 1.66ohm mono load. All the subs wired individually to produce an 8ohm load(both voice coils wired in series), then wired parallel to the amp to produce a 1.66ohm mono load. Kicker amps produce great sound and speaker control (damping factor) and can handle the ohm load with great power output.|`|nD2PwaBLaa	I would buy an one ohm stable 1000w peak amp. it will give you roughly 500-600 rms at one ohm.
msxoY6ERaa	um... a lot like 8-12 liters why would the tranny be dry tho? i suggest just getting like 2 quarts and putting some in and checking it and so on untill it works good. and make sure its the right kind. there are several kinds.

mCbhjcLuaa	I have some snake oil that will fix that.<br>  You probably have worn out spark plugs and or wires, the snake oil juice just aggravated a preexisting problem.|`|HFrsH9MRaa	NEED MORE INFO!!!!!!! What kind of car, year, model, mileage. How do you expect to get a decent answer without any details???? How do you know the gas was bad?? I assume this is a V6 engine. The Seafoam won't hurt anything. It usually helps things out. You might have another type of problem, like a bad fuel hose, or return hose or bad vapor cannister hose. All these things can affect idle. Locate and clean your throttle body and plate, and idle air control valve. If you are smart, you will install a set of Bosch Platinum or Nippondenso Iridium plugs in this engine. They will improve throttle response and improve your MPG's. Also, try to de-sludge your engine and use ONLY  a good synthetic, like Mobil One. Power wash your engine and keep it clean. Good Luck!!!|`|904b98e3003123549fac56c6334846a5aa	Yes it can.
PP5f53YUaa	flywheel bolts could be loose  been there done that|`|f5ibT3WNaa	You shouldn't be able to turn the flywheel over by hand. You could have something broke in the engine catching.|`|0OZ9dsUjaa	Maybe the starter was not the problem, maybe there is something else wrong. what was the car doing before you changed the alternator?|`|yzZchHHTaa	Have to check for spark, could be a crank/cam sensor, ignition module. coil, plugs, wires.  Then check for proper fuel pressure/volume.
AA11823124	The alternator is an external accessory turned by a belt that is attached to the crank pulley. It has no effect on the internal engine timing, nor will it have any affect on the car starting, short of the fact that tha battery may not get charged.<br>  Have your battery load tested after being charged. I think that installing a new starter just reduced the amount of current required to turn over the engine. Pull the battery out and take it an auto parts store to get recharged and tested. They usually do it for free or just a few dollars.|`|f5ibT3WNaa	No you cannot throw your engine off by turning it by hand.|`|cJSxv5n3aa	no, the timing is linked between the cam and crank, turning the alternator will not affect it.|`|PP5f53YUaa	NO it won't change your timing.  You might need a new battery|`|Y2rEAB1raa	No, plain and simple.

I've seen them go well over twenty grand.|`|3ZU7eqULaa	I would give you two answers: <br>  <br>  If you are not going to keep this car for more than 5 years than buy it because after that time problems will be coming up, since "pontiac" does not make that long reliable cars.<br>  <br>  If you are going to keep it for a longer time(7-10) years than buy a 2008 altima, 2009 Scion tC, 2008 honda civic all very reliable car brands.

I've heard of not being able to RENT a car at 18, but buying should be okay.  Of course, in New York,,it's hard to be sure of anything.|`|yuXGsNUCaa	I'm not sure what the age requirement is for some states, but yes, as long as you have a drivers license and the money or a good credit rating in case you can't fully buy the car and have to pay for it monthly then yes you should be able to buy a car. I'd suggest a second hand car so your insurance won't be so high.|`|GsSRY7quaa	you can buy a car at 18, but if you are buying from a dealership, you will need a good down payment and maybe a cosigner. do you have any credit history? this will be important too if buying from a dealership. it would be helpful for you to have a parent assist you on this.  David|`|5XYlHv6Paa	That's only for renting. You can buy, you just might need a cosigner for your loan. Actually, if you want to pay a lower interest rate, you will definitely need a cosigner.|`|QBQKxsNtaa	yes you can buy a car|`|rELSr3Oaaa	Of course you can. If you have the cash or can get financing of course.<br>  <br>  I think the person that told you you can't until 25 must have been thinking of car rentals. Only a few rental agencies will rent to a person under 25 and the ones that do, charge a bit more for under 25 drivers.|`|Y2rEAB1raa	At 18 you can enter into a contract. So yes, you should be able to buy one, unless your state has funny laws.
4Pe8yZnuaa	You have four options:<br>  <br>  1) Sell it. If the sale price is less than what you owe, you have to pay the bank the difference.<br>  <br>  2) Request a re-write of the loan from the lender.  The problem with this option is that people generally do this to reduce their monthly payments.  The only way to do this is to extend the term of the loan.<br>  <br>  3) Do a transfer of equity.  Find someone willing to take over your loan.  They would have to be approved by the lender and you would remain on the loan as a co-signer.<br>  <br>  4) The least desireable:  Give the car back to the bank.  This would be a repo.  It will ruin your credit, and make it very difficult to get another car loan in the foreseeable future. You would also be responsible for the balance of your loan after the car is sold at auction.|`|5XYlHv6Paa	If your car is worth more than $13,000, sell it. If it's now, how much less than 13 is it worth? You are going to have to decide if you want to sell the car, and still pay a loan for a car you don't even own. At least there won't be any insurance payments as well. You can also try to negotiate with your bank different terms for the loan.
9lZdDU2Vaa	Dear friend i don't know why you have sold your Unicorn bike?and i don't know about your maintenance . In this 150 cc category, it is the best in performance as well as mileage, stability,road grip,speed and safety.and for your kind information i my self is crazy about motor bikes and i changed many motorcycles in my life time and finally i bought unicorn and started to use it and realised gradually that this is the right bike for me  to settle down and using it day today with the millage of 62.5 KM/Lr and i have satisfied with its power, stability,road grip and its over all performance.Thank you and please go ahead and purchase new Unicorn and enjoy with what all i mentioned and  experience  about it...... more.......and ... more....Thank you.<br>  (kindly note  this is purely my own experience and not for any kind of commercials, thank you once again to all)|`|ed1f0410c6d854ef3f963ebeefee3ceeaa	The best in the category is Honda Unicorn but you already got rid of it. Per my opinion you should go for Suzuki 150 GS, the only bike in the segment with 6 gears, great combination of power & performance and most smooth ride with good fuel efficiency.|`|t1EK524faa	u say u want a better performing bike than the unicorn.....try the yamaha r15.its got the looks .it has a decent mileage of 42-45km pl.and as far as i know its the only 150cc bike in india which gives u 17bhp.(the 500cc royal enfields give u 20bhp.they r heavy and r suited to highways only)the weight of the r15 is a surprising 131kg only.its lighter than the pulsar 150!!!just have a look at it and u will know.<br>  <br>  but its the price which is driving back the customers (a whopping 1,20,000rs/-)if u want to go in for a cheaper alternative try the yamaha fz16.it doesnt have the looks of the r15 but has the same 150cc engine and the power is tuned down to15bhp which gives a mileage of 45-47 kmpl (slighty greater than the r15's ).the price of the fz16 is only 65,000 only!go to nearest yamaha dealer ,have a look at these bikes and test ride them.happy buying!!!!<br>  <br>  if u have any other doubts just email me.|`|XdBY3w1Taa	To know about various bikes, their performance, features, price etc...<br>  just refer here<br>  <a href="http://www.indiareviewchannel.com/products/Index.aspx?CategoryId=17" rel="nofollow">http://www.indiareviewchannel.com/produc...</a>|`|AA12081898	i would say definetely it has to be <br>  YAMAHA r15<br>  it's damn good lightweight and also has good mileage little less than unicorn but good|`|FQiqtP33aa	Hi,<br>  <br>  the relation says that higher the CC lower the mileage.<br>  <br>  however in ur case Pulsar would be a better option. 5 gears, low maintenance mileage 60-70 kmpl.

Those red and whites are rca outputs they go to the amp. The 17 watt rms from that head unit won't budge the sub. It will only overheat the voicecoil and ruin the sub. It has to move to stay cool. Don't even think about doing that|`|uL5772kCaa	Umm. dont wire it to your head unit. Its a dual voice coil, and if you bridge it, you are most likely going to fry ur head unit.

Secondly, Jags are notorious for having problems with high repair costs...again can you afford this? <br>  <br>  You are to be commended for working hard and saving a sizable sum for a car, but don't blow it by making a bonehead decision on a poorly made luxury car.  Get yourself a good reliable (and sporty) car.  Remember, smart rich people drive reliable used cars, not expensive lemons.|`|WaBijclZaa	How much have you set aside to pay for repairs? There's a reason that Jaguar's don't retain a high resale value.|`|QeMiIL15aa	Trust me since I buy a lot of pre-owned cars.

r9H8AXIsaa	"Tow a lot" is a clue.<br>  You should get Ford's Towing guide to help you assess if you are overloading the transmission.  Do you have a towing package (ie: trans cooler and a heavier built transmission?  What loads are being towed, does it match the truck's rating?  Are you running larger than stock tires without changing the rear end ratio?    Those are a few factors that will fry a transmission.<br>  <br>  Maybe you should have bought a F350.

If the same thing that happened to the first tranny is the exact same as with the second one, then there is either a problem with who your getting the tranny from in the first place.

If its a re-man then there is something wrong with the people that are rebuilding it, and if its from a yard i would consider taking it to a REAL re-man shop so you can evaluate what is going on with it, they might be able to tell you why its doing that, maybe you need to put a more power full tranny in it.

xc8bnpCvaa	It depends:<br>  If you want a half done job (like Maaco) is will cost you about $500.00 but all they do is tape up the window and handles and spray it all over. Ok if you are going with the same color, terrible if you are going with a different color (none of your interior parts, door jams etc will be painted) <br>  If you want a QUALITY job, you are looking at several thousand dollars. It will still depend on if you go with a generic black paint code or the Mercury black paint code. A good paint job will consist of pretty much complete tear down of the vehicle, priming and painting. <br>  Then you have the cost of clear coat, body work (cause you do not want to drop $3000.00 on a paint job and not have the dents, dings and deep scratches fixed.. etc..<br>  Most of your automotive paints are at least $400 per gallon and up!
