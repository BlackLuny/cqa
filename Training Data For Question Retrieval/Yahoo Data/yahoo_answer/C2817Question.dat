20090203152445AA93mvg	Dining Out;Other - Dining Out	Question for RESTAURANT SERVERS (Cheesecake Factory): If you share a table w/another server, who gets the tip?	There have been plenty of times where I have dined and my main server just so coincidentally is going on his or her break time. Therefore, we are given a "replacement" server. (This happens more often at Cheesecake Factory, more than 5 times. I don't mind, I'm just wondering where the tip goes to.)  Many times the replacement server is better than the main server is, because we usually stay long enough for the main server to come back from his or her break - so we get to experience both.      This happens to be quite often, and I've always wondered who gets the tip left on the table? Do they split it, or does it go to the main server since it was his/her table in the first place? Usually, since the replacement server does a better job, I'd like to tip him/her - but not the main one.      Does anyone know how this works?
