20090223112808AAq1yc3	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	Has anyone else heard of Mary Worth?	This past weekend my girlfriend went to a small part at a friends house.  Around midnight there were about 8 people left and the host told us this story about a woman named Mary Worth who had killed herself after being disfigured in a car crash.  Legend said that if chanted her name into a mirror she would appear.  We decided to try it.  We all crammed into their pathroom.  We all huddled around the mirror and starting repeating "Mary Worth, Mary Worth, I believe in Mary Worth". About the seventh time we said it one of the girls that was in front of the mirror started screaming and trying to push her way back away from the mirror.  We turned on the lights and found this girl huddled in the corner screaming. She turned her around to see what the problem and saw these long fingernail scratches running down her right cheek. I will never forget her face as long as I live!!

20090223113155AAr0Q7o	Society & Culture;Cultures & Groups;Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, and Transgendered	Can someone who comes off as really  really nice be self-centered please explain?	I used to have a best friend who I thought was the nicest person in the world. but she did things that made me think otherwise, like she never called me unless i called her first, we never hung out unless i asked first when we did we had a so much fun though. she seemed like she never made the effort to see me or call. But i am kinda confused because she told me some of her deepest secrets because she said she trust me, i'm not sure if she was just using me as a her venting machine when we did hang out, shes a very talkative person. She tells me things on how she uses her boyfriend because  shes afraid of being alone. BUt other times she says she just perfers to be alone even though she is so social with every one she meets. she doesn't have a lot of friends but  its not because she s anti social everybody thinks shes really cool and nice. I am really confused. What do you think of this person?
20090223113329AA3DiP4	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	Still Confused about Wicca?	ok, so i've read so many different views on this, im having a hard time coming to a conclusion. I am interested in Wicca, just trying to learn its roots.    1. So Gardner didnt make the whole thing up, just his gardnerian wicca?    2. Did he just bring the pagan practices to the public eye back in the 50's?   3. If you call yourself a "Wiccan" you dont necessarily follow Gardner, (although you can), but it just means someone who follows ancient traditions, rituals etc.?

20090223113815AAyOakh	Society & Culture;Languages	What should i do? please help!?	I have this neighbor and our parents are friends.  I dont like her and my mom knows that. she is in my grade (9thh) and we met when i moved into our neighborhood when i was in the fifth grade. when i first met her, i didnt like her and she has clung to me for 5 years! i am absolutely sick of it ! So last week i told her i needed space and I felt like I had a shadow.  so i came back to school today, and i didnt get the space that i asked for. she hangs around me and my friends all the time and they dont like her either. she copies everything I do and say and wear and how i act !! so today at lunch see sat with me, she hung out with me and my friends in the morning and followed me in the hallway.  she has no other friends but I dont want to lead her on thinking she could become friends with my friends when i know it is never going to happen because they dont like her. i also feel that if she broke off from me, she could maybe become herself and stop copying me. and today on the ride home from school, she sat next to me yet she talked to the girl next to her, not even to me! i want to tell her againt that i need space but I dont know what is going to be effective on her to make her understand that i NEED SPACE! should i feel bad? i just dont know what to say or do !

20090223114024AAQMIkB	Society & Culture;Other - Society & Culture	I just want some opinions on this?	Ok, I'm "white", a mixture of Scottish, Irish, English, Native American, German and French.  I have lived in NY my entire life, very culturally diverse.  I'm not racist, at least I would not consider myself to be.  I HATE the word n*gger and I get offended when people use that term.  I also get offended when African Americans use the term n*gga to describe their friends.  I can understand why they use the term, it has such a deep meaning and it seems to me like they use the word to lessen the pain and suffering of what the word actually means to them.  I hate when people (non African Americans, usually) try to justify their use of the word stating that it means "lower class people" or w/e in the dictionary.  We all know that this word is offensive, especially to the African American community, why do we still use it?  Is there any other word that we can replace it with that doesn't have such an offensive background?   Also, why do people lower themselves to the point where they would fit the dictionary description of the word?  Not just talking about African Americans, because we all know that there are some low class people in any ethnicity.  It disturbs me that people would resort to lying, cheating, stealing, shooting, drug dealing, and dropping out of school and being uneducated.  There are so many opportunities in this world for everyone to achieve, not saying that it's easy.  I'm "white" and female and there are still a LOT of obstacles that are put in my way.  I just wanted to vent and see what other people have to say.

Do you really know of or have even heard of anyone mistaking their church for a Jewish synagogue AND STAYING. Is there really someone that was looking for a shul and mistakenly walked into a Messianic temple and said" WOW, This is just what I've been looking for. I Can be Jewish and have Christmas too!!"?      I am not defending them. The policy of my rabbi and friends is simply to ignore them. I am not saying that we should stop specifying that they are not any part of Judaism in our posts, but is the anger really called for. Do you really think they are a credible threat?

I was uncomfortable with it being in, and it bothered me when I slept. I wound up taking it out because of the pain, it was also crooked. I want to have it re-done but I'm scared it's going to hurt. I've asked people who have had it done, and they said the clamp hurts a little, but that's it. Does it really hurt that bad? Also, GUYS, do you think a belly piercing makes a girl slutty or what?

Since you are you in your body and not someone else's, you ever wonder that you may be the only real living conscious being in this planet and that everything else, including your friend, parents are nothing but decoy to make you think you're not alone but in fact you are?      Another way of looking at my question is, what if some Greater Power placed you here but needed to make you think you have a life so it created other living things around you to build cars, computers, buildings, so on and so on....  Otherwise, if you were entirely alone here on this planet then you would die prematurely from loneliness...Right?      So what do you think?

For me its scary to live in this day and age, in a world power, and see how people use religion to their benefit.Specially the ones that make a very nice living out of it.  I believe in God, and I consider myself spiritual. However, I know God gave me free will to act on my own and experience my own consequences.

20090223115529AAZVwbX	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	I'm re-posting this question because the older they are the less answers you get.?	3 Questions:      1.) When God said "Indeed! the man has become like one of us, knowing good and evil!" Who is the "us" he is referring to? More Gods? Angels? Is there more than one God?      2.) Eve bore Cain and Abel with the help of the Lord not Adam. Then when Adam was 130 years old he became father of a son in his own likeness, Seth. Was Seth conceived with Eve? Furthermore, these were all men. When did the first lady come about?       3.) If Adam and Eve were the first two humans and they had children wouldn't that mean incest? Isn't that wrong? They walked among God would he allow such behavior?      I'm asking such serious questions because I'm confused. The bible confuses me. There are just too many loop-holes. Too much that seems wrong. Is there chapters left out? The bible has many versions. Who's to say that whoever had the bible thousands of years ago didn't change the text to their liking? Something this old had to be tampered with by man. I'm trying to decide whether or not to switch from Baptist to Scientology. I feel if God said we have become as he then their are powers that we simply do not know how to master and I want to learn! Not to challenge him but to enlighten myself as much as possible. Please help me. Thank you.   46 minutes ago - 4 days left to answer.    Additional Details   I'd like to add the bible I have say's in Genesis Chapter 4, 1, "The man knew Eve his wife, and she conceived and bore Cain, saying, "I have given birth to a man-child with the help of the Lord."       Now when it say's he knew her does that mean sex?      Or when she says I have given birth with the help of the Lord does that mean he did her the same as Mary?      You see, this is all confusing and the more you read it the harder it becomes. It's seems so real but then so mythical.      I for one believe it has been changed many many times by the rulers of the world during those times. Also, who invented the 365 day year? How do we really know how old they were? How do we really know how old we are? Man has had a hand in everything and a book this old is just like word of mouth. It changes with whoever is telling the story. Also, when did he invent dinasours and the other planets. Was man meant to go the moon? All this makes my head hurt but I still believe in him. CONFUSING!!!   15 minutes ago      Also in Revelations when it says those who practice black magic will be sent to hell, what does that mean? Does magic really exist? If so, that some scary stuff. I feel if it says it then it must be true right? Some people don't believe in magic but the bible speaks of it. I know there is much more to the bible people but I'm just speaking on the things that don't make since to me and I'm just asking for help. Don't jump down my throat. I pray to one God, the Alpha and Omega. I just think man had a lot to do with what has been added and deleted from the holy text. If you read something over and over again you too will make it fit to your liking but take it for what it's worth. I need a collection of facts and opinions.   9 minutes ago

20090223120740AAFjNrj	Society & Culture;Cultures & Groups;Other - Cultures & Groups	What are the best and worst cities in the U.S. to live in?	I currently live in DC. I go to college in Arlington, VA. This is ok, it's coming up and it's looking beautiful now. It so hard to buy a house here though.      I would rather live in New York City, because it's a faster city and I'm in the Fashion industry.       I would never ever ever ever ever ever, live in the city of Detroit. I apologize in advance for anyone who lives there or has lived their. But I find Detroit a very depressing and sad city. I visited some family there twice and I hated it. Detroit has a lot abandoned houses and impoverished areas. It's breaks my heart to see that there are some many people suffering here. The city is slowly becoming a ghost town. I would never live in the state of Michigan, I've encountered so much Racism/segregation here. I've visited the suburbs of Detroit and 92% of the residents are White, while in the inner-city 84% of the residents are Black. It because of the whole "White Flight" thing in the 1960s. The Whites wanted to move far away from the Blacks. In these mostly White suburbs, I've gotten some weird stares and some racist remarks. I was so shocked. Detroit used to beautiful according to my grandma, it has so much potential to be a great city. But it looks like it's never gonna comeback because people are living the area in droves. I really want to help the people in the city, but I'm so afraid of going back. The people there didn't even smile, they looked at me like I was crazy because I looked "too happy"       http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A8dz40AOO...     http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hUWVVclOT...     http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snsyzaojS...     http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nga2_XK3k...     http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHr2mLQZU...

20090223081005AAe3kR8	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	The abomination of desolation spoken of by Daniel the prophet. What is it, when biblically analyzed?

Solomon says a false balance is an abomination; and the LORD hates six things, but seven things are an abomination to the LORD; the 7th being sowing discord(strife, contention, division) among brethren.       So, using only the biblical clues, what do you think it is?   (never mind what commentaries say, nor what Wiki says)

20090223074250AAAYGwe	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	Does Allah punish or reward Muslims who knowingly lie about Islam to defend and/or promote it?	I'm vaguely familiar with the concept of Islamic al-taqiyya ("covering or concealing") and I'm wondering if Allah promises rewards in paradise for those who blatantly deny certain truths about Islam, and intentionally misrepresent it for the sake of propaganda.      For example, one of the latest "scientific miracles" being advertised by Muslims worldwide is that the Qur'an describes the Earth as egg-shaped. This hoax has been exposed (dahaha refers to the spread out nest of an ostrich, not the ostrich egg) yet so many Muslims appear to either be completely unaware of this intentional mistranslation, or insist that it's true.      Based on that example, what will Allah have in store for those who fake scientific miracles and such for their obligatory attempts to proselytize innocently ignorant non-Muslims?

20090223054504AAISdaX	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	How come in the beginning all the apostle were even, but then after Constantine, only the Pope had power?	Gal 2:9-10    9 and when James, Cephas, and John, who seemed to be pillars, perceived the grace that had been given to me, they gave me and Barnabas the right hand of fellowship, that we should go to the Gentiles and they to the circumcised. 10 They desired only that we should remember the poor, the very thing which I also was eager to do.         When Paul came on the scene, he said that all three apostles seemed to be pillars, meaning that they were equal. And they also gave Paul the right hand of fellowship.       So how come in the beginning, it was more "theys", but now it's more "the Pope said" and not "them", being the Pope and Bishops?

You may say in your heart, ‘How will we know the word which the LORD has not spoken?’ When a prophet speaks in the name of the LORD, if the thing does not come about or come true, that is the thing which the LORD has not spoken. The prophet has spoken it presumptuously; you shall not be afraid of him.” —Deuteronomy 18:20-22      Would it be fair to say that as JW has made many false prophecies could this verse be aimed at the JW organisation?

Focus on the Family was having an "ex gay" conference in North Carolina recently and LGBT activists protested against it because Focus on the Family's "Love Won Out" was trying to convince gays to change to straight.      But just take a look at Love Won Out's mission statement:   "Non profit organization dedicated to helping gays getting rid of unwanted sexual desires."      What does LWO's mission of helping gays get rid of "unwanted" sexual desires have ANYTHING to do with trying to convince gay people to change to straight? I mean, so many gay people do not hold their sexuality as "unwanted" so LWO is really going against their own mission statement, aren't they???

I've always been an atheist and a while ago I saw a quote on Wikipedia from Seth Green that really to me sums the truth of what religion is.      "God is, to me, pretty much an idea. God is, to me, pretty much a myth created over time to deny the idea that we're all responsible for our own actions"      To me it really speaks out. All these wars going on, and it's often religion that's the cause. Don't get me wrong, I believe in the ten commandments, we should be nice, not steal, and treat everyone fairly etc but I think religion can be used as a weapon.

For example, in a Christian worldview, animals are not human, and therefore would not have rights and shouldn't be as protected? Fetuses, though lacking in cognition compared to animals, are human and therefore have rights, including the right to life?      What then, are we to do with God? The trinity is called three persons, yet only one is human.  Likewise, a unitarian conception of God involves one person, but no humans.      How can God the Father or God the Holy Spirit be persons, in this worldview, if neither are human?

20090223062522AAWfqpC	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	What thoughts have you on this?	I was speaking with a Christan, who told me that he knew God was real because when He became a Christian, his finances were fixed, his marriage better, and his health improved. I told him that was great, however, when I stopped believing in God, My finances improved my marriage was better, My children behaved better, and My health improved, because I realized i had to take care of these things there was no God to do it for me. He then told me that that was the Devil making things better so it would affirm my denial of God. Using the same argument I told him that it could be someone Else's Devil giving you your happiness to affirm your belief in the wrong God. He bid me farewell as he decided the arguments he had could all be turned that way. So, to the question. Why would any God, hold you to belief in Him/Her/Them as absolute truth, when the arguments for them can be turned against them? Why do they offer no absolute proof if following and belief in them is so important?

20090223074256AAjO9aw	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	If Jesus came to earth to visit (question on personality)...?	... do you think I could call him "The J-Man" and he would be OK with it? Or would he get mad and smite me?      More generally, what do you think he would be like to hang out with when he is not doing religious stuff?       Would he be relaxed and humerus, cracking jokes?    Did he like going for walks and stuff?   Into socialising and going out?    Maybe he would only talk about serious stuff and stay at home and study books if you wanted to do something different?   Perhaps it would be kinda pressurised cos you would be worried about disappointing him and getting the smackdown      I'm basically trying to get a feel as to what it was like for his buddies back in the day. I don't know if there are any clues in the bible as to his personality as a buddy was like but I'm guessing he at least must have been pretty charismatic to get followers and get popular.

It was okay at first as I know they were just teasing, but it's gone on for two years now and i'm sick of it. Every single day someone has to call me 'Emo' at least 5 times.       I asked them what makes them think i'm an 'Emo' and they just say that it's what i wear, how i act and how i walk... okay, how does the way i walk make me Emo? And i know there's the 'Emo style' with the heavy eyeliner, big side fringe, skinny fit jeans, tight tees, but i don't wear eyeliner, i don't wear any make up to be honest, only on Halloween! I have some skinnies, and a side fringe but i don't usually wear tight tees...      Another thing is because I listen to My Chemical Romance a lot, as they are my favourite band and Green Day which come under the music genre Emo, they think i'm the stereotype 'Emo'.       Another thing they do is go 'Show me your wrists, Emo!'. I don't slit my wrists or cause any self harm at all. And not all Emos do. My cousin was one, she said it herself, but she never caused any self harm.      What can I do? Please help!

20090223120726AAnC0wg	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	Silly question; I know, but I need to know: How does one go about becoming a member of a church?	Family-wise, my paternal grandmother was southern Episcopalian, my maternal grandmother is a non-practicing Church of England Anglican-Protestant (or something like that). My sister is Catholic by marriage but only goes once a year. No one else in my family goes to church and the closest I've come having a religous "experience" inside a church was by default because the town church was also our school bus stop. Those services included a lot of yelling and stomping and I didn't like that, so at least I know that "quiet devotion" is more my speed. Also, is it appropriate to "try-on" different religions? Can anyone recommend some good books on each? I'm single and don't know if it's right for me to enter church without having some established family or friend association. I just don't know how to do it. Also, how does one "choose" a religion? Could I go to Temple or "Mosque" if I wanted to? To Saturday night Catholic Mass on Saturday and one of the Protestant-based services on Sunday to try out? If I've offended the sensibilities of anyone I apologize. I know religion is a deeply personal issue for many; but as for me, I keep saying I'll go but I end up stuck at the door. I just want to be able to say I made a thoughtful and informed choice but don't know where to begin. Will I get strange looks for walking in solo? Gotta tell ya: that's the scariest part. I've had some personal tragedies happen in my life of late, and I feel that I need more answers than what I've been able to come up with on my own. And is that bad? (To be one of those people who turns to religion as a last resort)? I don't feel I'm doing that, either. Because I've honestly felt very deeply that it was a choice I'd want to make if I only knew how to follow-thru on the seemingly simple promise I make to myself every Jan 1st: That I'll begin attending church.

I'm in the process of applying for internships with literary agencies, which are generally small and personal companies with fewer than ten employees. Consequently, they all call each other by first name.      I've been in email correspondence with the intern director over the past week or so, discussing the possibility of a cross-country move for this internship in NYC (definitely no problem for me), and every time I have started my emails with Ms. ______ and signed my full name. She always addresses me by first name and signs with her first name only, no tag line or contact info or anything. So it's a rather informal email style.      Is there a point at which I can refer to her by first name when emailing, or should I continue to refer to her as Ms. _____? She's been very open and friendly, and I can't tell if I should continue to address her formally or follow her example.      Advice? Thanks!

Okay so I have know my best friend for around 3 years and since High School I feel we have drifted. We had a fight a few weeks ago but we got through it, but I still as if we’re no longer best friends because we are drifting apart she also has another best friend who she sees way more often than me and there much closer than we are. We have no classes together and we hardly ever see each other at school at all.    And I have met this other girl we have lots in common, we like the same music, we like doing the same thing, we even hate the same teachers. Lol. I think we can be pretty close if we bond more, however she hangs out with these other girls who are not so popular, not saying that I am because I’m not. But the people she hangs out with I don’t really like expect a few which who I’m friends with. And I think we could be friends even more if you understand me. Though I miss my best friend we just ain’t that close and I to be honest don’t wanna always have to be the one who make the effort to see her and to go out r just hang out with her. We only have like one sleepover in a blue moon and the other girl and her spend all the time together. :/      Do you think me and my best friend have drifted?

All the rest of the world writes dates so: day/month/year.    Americans write month/day/year.    Sometimes it's even year/day/month or is it year/month/day. Sometimes I'm completely bamboozled.   The natural progression of things goes from smallest to largest.      Is the world out of sync with America or is America out of sync with the rest of us?      I'd also like to know why they assign global importance to their sports such as  "Baseball World Series".        OK, it's a good game and I have enjoyed watching but apart from the Caribbean and Japan, who else plays it as a national sport?    Not even a fraction of those who watch the "World Cup", i.e. football (Americans, that's  soccer) would even know what the "World Series" was.

20090223112825AAw5byx	Society & Culture;Languages	How would you rate Hugh Grant's English pronunciation?	I'm a Korean learner of the English language, especially British English.   I often use DVDs to improve my English listening skills.   And the DVDs include mainly romantic comedy films, starring "Hugh Grant".   For example, "Notting Hill", "About a Boy" , "Music and Lyrics" and "Love Actually" are my favourite audiovisual materials of English education.   Of course, I also see another kind of films like "Billy Elliot" to get used to the northern accent.   I think Hugh Grant's pronunciation is very clear and helpful to improve foreigners' English.   How would you rate his pronunciation from your native speaker's point of view?

20090223111105AAdXUwK	Society & Culture;Etiquette	Is it just me, or are there more and more parents that.....?	Is it just me, or are there more and more parents that have adopted the theory that if you ignore bad behavior it will go away? I see and hear more and more children acting unruly in public these days, with parents that just seen to ignore the fact that their child is misbehaving. Once more the parents are astonished when others are bothered by the ill acting child. It just really bothers me, as I was not allowed to misbehave in public, and was disciplined when I did so. Am I just too old-school, or have some of the new generation of parents been brain washed to believe that disciplining your children will some how give them complexes when they are older, or will make the child love them less?       Looking forward to seeing what you all think.

We send them gifts and money for various occasions and only hear from his daughter, not his two sons.  She usually sends a quick myspace message telling us thank you and how much she loves the gifts.  But the boys never respond.  I can assure you they accept and use the gifts.        It irks the crap out of both of us, and my mother in law, who gets the same icy feeling from the boys.  They are way too old to be so rude.

20090223114845AAtIzS6	Society & Culture;Other - Society & Culture	Can you hate yourself and love others?	Sometimes I really hate myself for my ability to hurt others or anger people even if I don't mean to or want to: like bumping into them or accidentally poking them in the eye or breaking something or forgetting to do the dishes or even losing things. Some of this gets to me and stresses me out like math tests or being told by those I enjoy spending time with that they are too busy for me or being corrected about my hygiene. So for these reasons I hate myself and talk down to myself that I'm trashy when I'm depressed, yet when others are around I try my best to make sure they are okay and so they tell me I'm so kind. My psychology teacher told me you can't give what you don't have, so I wonder what it is called when you have self-hate but you care about the safety of others. I guess a good example of that would be co-dependency which I learned is quite a self-destructive way of thinking and behaving so I guess that's not love then, huh? It's confusing sometimes. But yeah I have a tendency to hate myself, while having deep concern for others. I'll check on others, but if others express concern for me (weight, grooming, hygeine, academics, safety) then I'll get mad and assume they hate me and are just looking for something to pin me on and find fault with me so I can feel guilty. Maybe that's a illogical way of thinking, but that's how I am sometimes.That might explain why I am a loner and keep myself from others so I can be alone at times and handle everything alone.

He came out for the first time to anybody two days ago. He said he thought he was gay for a long time until he was with me. He is bisexual.      Aside from all the trust issues we have right now, I know we can get through them because I completely understand how hard it was to come out and I know how much he had to trust me to come out.      He says the majority of the porn he watches is gay porn. He wants to try and stop watching porn. Still, I have just one question plaguing my mind. Will he be emotionally faithful when I cannot satisfy the gay side of him? Will I be able to give him everything he wants physically, emotionally, and mentally when I cannot be everything a guy can be?      Please understand that until I can understand from that point of view, my sexual relationship with him will be on hold.

20090223115832AAEQraD	Society & Culture;Cultures & Groups;Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, and Transgendered	Is there a simple explanation as to why I cannot maintain friendships?	Six months after starting Sixth Form, I've realised I have a problem. I thought it would clear up once I had settled in after a couple months, but it's getting more and more noticeable. Some may not consider it much of a problem, but I feel as though I simply cannot create/maintain friendships with guys. I'm generally fine if I am in a mixed group, emphasis on mixed, and there are plenty of guys who I am friendly with, and will chat with briefly before running out of conversation. However, this conversation never seems to be turned into anything closer to a real friendship. I know I'm capable of having guys friends though as my best friend and several other close friends are guys, although saying that, I've known them for ages (since way before I realised I was gay, if that makes any difference). I know that stereotypically, gay guys tend to have way many more female friends than male, but I feel so strange with no real guy friends, I mean, I consider myself quite a confident person.      I sometimes wonder if it has much to do with the guys in my year not making much effort to be friends with me if they're aware I'm gay (I'm not obvious, but you wouldn't believe how fast word goes round in our school) or whether it's just some psychological block on my part. Either way, I hate it, and I'm scared that this will be the case at University too, and even beyond that.      Please could someone perhaps shed some light on a possible reason for this, and maybe a solution or two? Maybe I'm missing something obvious, and I need someone to make me realise this.      Any help is greatly appreciated.      Thanks in advance,   Simon.

But if you’re friends with a girl (not in a relationship) will she be comfortable with you putting your arm round her, holding her hand or giving them a hug? Some times my friends that are girls will give me a kiss on the cheek, etc so is it OK to do that to them too?      I notice girls that are friends do this all the time, obviously, men friends don’t, so us guys don’t know the etiquette on this, other than if you’re dating them! It seems like a nice thing to do, even if there’s nothing in it.      So would they view it as OK?      Thanks

SO ANYWAY we were doing homework together the other day and i saw that my name was written all over one of her pieces of paper. like doodled all over it like a hundred times. and i think when she saw me looking she kind of tried to tuck it back in the binder but it was too late, i'd already seen it.   plus she always invites me to go to yoga with her and tries to give me a massage afterwards! i know this sounds really creepy but she's not a creepy person really, she's pretty nice... just a little strange sometimes...   also, a lot of my other friends have told me that they see her staring at me all the time, and that she acts like she is in love with me.   i used to just get mad at them when they said that, and i didn't believe them, i figured that they were just picking on her for being bi or something.   but now i'm not sure! what do you think of this? what should i do if she does like me that way??? she's a pretty nice person, i dont want to hurt her feelings...

And before the bible there was an Egyptian legend about a god named Horace who was like Jesus in many ways (born of a virgin, walked on water, healed the sick). What makes Christianity true? And why is it good to believe in something with no evidence to support it, is blind faith a good thing or is it just stupid?

After reading history, i realize that the people of Palestine where unwanted by all nations. That is why they are stuck in Israel fighting.      So is it not logical to send all Palestinians away with given citizen ship to different countries that would aid them to a better life.       Instead of giving them a reason to rejoice in losing their homes, they had nothing but pain, sorrow, hunger, and etc.       Would it have been the right thing to do for the ones that suffer. Then they would probably been glad to leave. This is another mistake that was made.

Since no one in his time could teach Jesus except God (via his ways) - how do we know that Jesus was not referring to God in this context instead of how it has become???

20090223124831AAAF9q2	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	Atheists, do you think the story of Ananias and Sapphira depicts a cultic murder?	1Now a man named Ananias, together with his wife Sapphira, also sold a piece of property. 2With his wife's full knowledge he kept back part of the money for himself, but brought the rest and put it at the apostles' feet.     3Then Peter said, "Ananias, how is it that Satan has so filled your heart that you have lied to the Holy Spirit and have kept for yourself some of the money you received for the land? 4Didn't it belong to you before it was sold? And after it was sold, wasn't the money at your disposal? What made you think of doing such a thing? You have not lied to men but to God."        5When Ananias heard this, he fell down and died. And great fear seized all who heard what had happened. 6Then the young men came forward, wrapped up his body, and carried him out and buried him.        7About three hours later his wife came in, not knowing what had happened. 8Peter asked her, "Tell me, is this the price you and Ananias got for the land?"          "Yes," she said, "that is the price."        9Peter said to her, "How could you agree to test the Spirit of the Lord? Look! The feet of the men who buried your husband are at the door, and they will carry you out also."        10At that moment she fell down at his feet and died. Then the young men came in and, finding her dead, carried her out and buried her beside her husband.

I thought she was a decent person, until I talked to her. She doesn't stop talking, and it's about nonsense. You see, I'm not the type of person who will blatantly tell her to shut up. I just can't do that. And ignoring her isn't making matters any better. Any ideas on how to solve my problem?

Last night, my 10 month old daughter, who is normally a very well behaved baby, did not want to go to sleep.  She cried for well over 30 minutes, I made several visits to her.  She would stop crying when I picked her up and slap my shaved head because she likes the sound (I put her on my shoulders alot and she loves the sound of slapping my skull lol) she also pulled my shirt and while near the wall reached for it to scratch it so she could hear the noise it made.  She would then proceed wailing once I placed her back in her crib.  As I held her in my arms, kicking and pushing away from me, flailing any way she could...I had a revelation of sorts.  For a split second, I felt like I understood how God feels, me being in God's place for educational purposes and me being in my child's place.  We kick and scream and sin and fight Him every step of the way, and He calmly holds us keeping us from falling.  Anyone had any similar revelations?

Trouble is - he's VERY not expressive. He's on this medication for anxiety disorders that flattens him out emotionally.

He says thing flatly in overly simple language (like if I called him crying about something he'd say, "that sucks,") and it really hurts me.    It makes me want to put myself in dangerous situations, maybe drink too much or walk alone at night, etc. just to try to get a reaction out of him. I know that this is not healthy. I want to learn to just deal with his flatness but I have a history of being abused by guys who are very flat right before they strike, so it makes it really hard to get used to.      What do you think? Can he change? Can I? Or should I call this thing off before it hurts either one of us more??

Why does Daniel 9:24-27 prove or not prove that Jesus Christ really existed and was God?  To me this seems to be one of the strongest verses to prove that Jesus truly existed and was more than a man, although the NT still has too many errors and contradictions (no apologies to anyone).  The OT is not perfect either...       Dan 9:21 while I was still speaking in prayer, then the man Gabriel, whom I had seen in the vision previously, came to me in {my} extreme weariness about the time of the evening offering.           Dan 9:22 He gave {me} instruction and talked with me and said, "O Daniel, I have now come forth to give you insight with understanding.           Dan 9:23 "At the beginning of your supplications the command was issued, and I have come to tell {you,} for you are highly esteemed; so give heed to the message and gain understanding of the vision.           Dan 9:24 "Seventy weeks have been decreed for your people and your holy city, to finish the transgression, to make an end of sin, to make atonement for iniquity, to bring in everlasting righteousness, to seal up vision and prophecy and to anoint the most holy {place.}           Dan 9:25 "So you are to know and discern {that} from the issuing of a decree to restore and rebuild Jerusalem until Messiah the Prince {there will be} seven weeks and sixty-two weeks; it will be built again, with plaza and moat, even in times of distress.           Dan 9:26 "Then after the sixty-two weeks the Messiah will be cut off and have nothing, and the people of the prince who is to come will destroy the city and the sanctuary. And its end {will come} with a flood; even to the end there will be war; desolations are determined.           Dan 9:27 "And he will make a firm covenant with the many for one week, but in the middle of the week he will put a stop to sacrifice and grain offering; and on the wing of abominations {will come} one who makes desolate, even until a complete destruction, one that is decreed, is poured out on the one who makes desolate."

How do I go about getting my memories back?      Here is just some reasons why i think I was him      1. My names is James last intital R. Just like king James when he signed documents as James R.   2. my mother name is Mary just like Mary queen of scotts.    3. my mother and I both look like the portraits of the Stuart monarchies   4. I am currently living in the colony chartered by king James in 1606 in north Carolina in the queen city (Charlotte)   5. Ive had two people acuse me of writting the bible. One was my friend who was drunk the other was another friend who i was was possoed by a demon    6. I don't feel attracted to women as much I would like, sort of like king James. I never had sex with a guy in this lifetime, but they say I was a Tibetan monk before i was king James and in that lifetime i was gay (supposedly homosexuality runs rampant in those monasteries and is considered normal.)    7. I feel closely attached to saint Germain who was rumored to be Francis bacon.    8. About three or 4 people have said i was the king including a reiki master, a psychic, and a hypnotherapist.      Anyway I don't know if this is true but just looking for answers that's all.         James R.

20090223141534AAs0V96	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	Why do genetics even matter in the "is homosexuality is a choice" argument?	Okay, I always hear people (always Christians) say that there's no proof for a gay gene, therefor homosexuality is a choice.  I'm wondering why genetic evidence matters.      Say there's a murder committed.  There is absolutely no DNA or genetic evidence at the scene of the crime.  Lets also say that it happened in a very public area in broad daylight.  Twenty-five reliable witnesses saw the entire thing.  They saw the assailant draw the gun, point it at the victim, and shoot the victim fifteen times.  All the witnesses told the same story, no contradictions.  Would DNA evidence be necessary for a conviction?  No jury in the world would actually acquit the murderer because there was no DNA.  Twenty-five eyewitnesses is much more than enough proof of guilt.      So when every gay/bi person in the world (not to mention straight people) say that they didn't chose to be that way, why is some gene necessary for people to believe us?  That's a completely irrational assertion!  So why on Earth do people cling to this gene thing?      I put this here, because the R&S section is where the people are who use this argument.  If I post it in the LGBT section I'll just be preaching to the choir.

I am taking my little charge to Church with me Wednesday   (shes 9 ) and while she has somewhat of a basic idea of Lent, shes not really keen on the sacrifice.   She doesn't understand what its for only that her friends are giving up Candy.        I told her she didn't HAVE to give up something, that instead she can help more around the house, or make a good effort to make friends with the new Catholic little girl who had moved to our town recently.      She also doesn't understand that if she can't keep her  "sacrifice"  that me or her parents were going to be terribly angry with her and she would be punished.....I let her know that we will remind her of her promise but it was her own business between herself and God.      I just get the feeling that she feels more obligated than actually interested and I don't like her growing into the idea that religion is a hastle rather than a faith

20090223134019AANigc4	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	Why do people say there's no such thing as a "Christian Jew" or "Buddhist Jew" etc?	Now, first of all- let me say, I don't get the whole "Jews for Jesus" thing.  The religions seem to contradictory to be married like that.        BUT, I've always understood and been taught that once someone is Jewish, they're Jewish forever.  So if you're born Jewish, You're still considered a Jew by the Jewish community regardless of what choices you make in your life.  If you convert to Judaism, you're a Jew forever, even if you practice another religion later on.  My Rabbi at a conservative synagogue confirmed this- He says if your mother is Jewish, or if you convert, you're Jewish forever, period.        So, doesn't that mean that technically someone could be considered Jewish AND Christian, or Buddhist, etc?        Thanks in advance.  I'd like to get a clear understanding of this.

20090223142146AA5WB7o	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	If karma exists, can you believe that karma will take revenge / balance things out eventually?	You've always wanted revenge. They've done something bad to you. You do nothing and believe that things will balance eventually and that the person will eventually suffer for what they've done. So there is no need for revenge, karma will do it's thing...      But isn't wanting revenge a bad thing in the first place and that all that will be is a reoccurring effect of balancing the good / bad until someone forgives or thinks that whatever bad they have done, you will never take revenge. They won't even believe that because they've done something bad something, then they will eventually get what they deserve (a balancing effect).      Perhaps we should just hope even good things happen to the person you wanted to really take revenge upon. But you can't really lie and say that, you have to really want to to really want/hope from the good of your heart. Only then will good things happen to you and them no matter what. Am I confusing?

20090223135707AAfsmiA	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	How to Convince my Parents to Let me Get Baptized as a Methodist?	I'm 14. My parents are Catholic. Being a Catholic wasn't a really a big deal. I never learned about other religions until I went to a different church with my sister. You see when my sister moved in with her husband she changed from a Catholic to a Christian. They go to a Methodist church. I stayed there for the summer and went to the church more. I realized that I'm not a Catholic and that I'm a Methodist. But my parents won't let me get baptized until I'm out of the house. I want to be baptized sooner since I'm always talking about how I'm Methodist but since I'm not baptized I feel like I'm lying about my religion. I took communion for the first time at the Methodist church and it felt so weird. The pastor knows my situation and he told me that as long as I believe in the religion I don't have to be baptized yet. The pastor knows anything and everything about me. The majority of the reason is because I'm semi- dating his son (long story short his son doesn't want to deal with a long distance relationship). He knows that I believe and follow the Methodist religion and that the church has had such an awesome influence on me. i promised them that as soon as I can I'm getting baptized at their church. They understand that it will probably be 4 years from now but I want to be baptized sooner. So how can I convince my parents to let me get baptized sooner?

20090223122916AA9upEu	Society & Culture;Cultures & Groups;Other - Cultures & Groups	What does women empowerment mean to you?	To me, it meant women should fight for equal rights as men.  Not physically, but mentally as it doesn't take a man's physical nature to land him a job, career or position of power.  This Chris Brown and Rihanna story brought to my attention that some men use women embracing women empowerment as an excuse to why it's ok to hit them if they want to fight.  Keep in mind, having equal rights, violence doesn't land men opportunity(aside from physical techniques that are taught for self defense).  Instead violence has consequences for both men and women.  What does women empowerment mean to you?

20090223144111AAwLjkc	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	I recently discovered I was right about my argument before, but does anyone still disagree with me?	My recent argument:      An opinion is a person's thought that comes to mind in which when you express it you use an adjective (most of the time), describe the values of something (importance of something), describe religious or personal beliefs using the words "I believe" or show an interest for something. It has been proven that you cannot say that an opinion is right or wrong, true or false, or correct or disprove an opinion because it is your personal thought. If it was disproven (which it cannot be disproven), every living thing would be the same in every way possible and it would change history around. We might not be here as I speak if this happened, but it cannot happen.    Some examples to reconsider disagreeing with me: On a test, saying something is easy when another person thinks opposite. Telling a girl to her face that she is ugly when she thinks the opposite. Saying (this would hurt my feelings) that Jesus was not the Messiah when that is that contradicts the Bible's teachings. Telling someone that they aren't cool because they have opposite interests. Last example, saying that the Big Bang Theory disproves God creating the world when since you can't disprove God, you can't disprove aything he did, so therefore, science is incorrect (also see the word "theory" in it).   When someone tells their opinion without saying the words "In my opinion" first (to me specifically), I feel as though the person is telling me that everyone thinks the same as them and everyone SHOULD think the same as them. That insults me because that tells me that everyone in the world is the same in every way possible. I wouldn't understand why at any time to dislike a person that is different. Everyone is entitled to their own opninion, and they don't have to follow along with others. If they do, that will contradict the fact that everyone excluding identical twins are genetically different.   I also have an opinion that it is illogical to tell an opinion to someone's face in which they might get insulted. To add to that, I think it is illogical to jump to a conclusion without having any proof. To link these two concepts together, let's just say I told my friend I beat a video game, and since I am not good at lying, I'm not lying. He says, "No you didn't." I would tell him that he isn't using common sense, and he wasn't there so he can't jump to a conclusion like that. Just because someone finds something ridiculous doesn't mean they can jump to conclusions without knowing information. Instead of him saying "No you didn't," he should've pre-planned saying "I don't believe you," instead of jumping to the conclusion. In my opinion, the better choice of words is to say you don't believe them, NOT jump to conclusions like that.   A pet peeve I have is when people should use the word "should". If someone in my 8th grade class asked how to pronounce the word "a", and the English teacher says "You 'should' know that by now. That is the most ridiculous thing I've ever heard in my life. You have detention after school now." Even though he is not talking to me, it still insults me because I believe the word "should" to be a very strong and not nice word.   If anyone disagrees with me, that is fine. I don't know you personally, but maybe you would reconsider due to various examples and long amounts of typing space I took up. I would go ballistic and constantly be repeating myself over and over again, but oh well. I know I am right and that I am not trying to offend anyone. I really suck at lying, I haven't done it since I was 4 years old and I didn't know what lyingh was then. Oh and by the way, don't just look at one aspect of this argument and give an answer on one aspect. PAY ATTENTION TO ALL THE ASPECTS AND GIVE AN ANSWER FOR EACH ONE PLEASE! I AM CURIOUS TO HEAR SOMETHING FOR EACH PART OF THE ARGUMENT!      I am adding some detail:      No matter what you do to support your opinion, it won't change into correct or incorrect. If you agree, make an experiment, take a survey, or other things I can't think of, it doesn't change. An answer in my previous question said that someone asks him in his opinion, who will win the super bowl and he says the Steelers, and they won. Just a little message for that answer- that is a GUESS, not an opinion. You put yourself in the incorrectly worded position. And, finally, the "I am right"- straight from the dictionary-      opinion- belief or conclusion based on what one thinks rather than on what is proven or known to be true      The dictionary agrees with my argument, and since this is a correctable argument, the dictionary points out that I am right. Macmillan Dictionary for Students is the name of the dictionary. Anyone still disagree?

There would be room in the prisons since all the pot smokers would be out of prison. And then we would implent a three strike system nation wide for the marijuana smokers again.

In the Bible (King James Version) John 4:16 says:      "Jesus saith unto him, I am the way, the truth, and the life: no man cometh unto the Father, but by me."      I do not believe in God, but I am a good person. Does this mean that if I live my life being the best person I can and hardly ever sin, but I don't believe in God, I deserve to burn in Hell? What if there is another person who sins their entire life, but they believe in God and repent, do they deserve to go to Heaven even though I was a better person? I ask that because someone I've known for years told me today that unless I believe in God, I will burn in Hell. This person has also told me I am one of the nicest people she knows. It just gets me angry that someone that close to me thinks I should burn in Hell because I do not agree with her religious beliefs. What do you think of this Bible verse? Please do not answer this question if you're going to give me crap about my beliefs, I just want your honest opinion of this Bible verse...

Also whats funny is one day i was laying on the couch and he was sitting on the side and all of a sudden he was "playing a joke" like he was going to body slam me and he just gentle came crashing down and his dog came and jumped on us. So we just ended up laying there for like 5 minutes. He can be really awesum and kind when its just us. But at school he's different. Way different. Im not sure how to explain it. But like he seems to act like he likes girls and he avoids me sometimes. It's like he's a normal straight guy. I even herd him say he has nothing against gays. Any ideas?
20090426220232AAHwNpl	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	Christians! Why are you so amused that we can't prove that God does not exist?	It really shouldn't, you know. It should worry you.      In order to "prove" anything about anything - that thing MUST actually exist. The idea of "proof" becomes nonsensical otherwise.      Therefore - the fact that we cannot possibly offer you that evidence - and are happy to admit it - does suggest that he, indeed, does not exist.      If something actually exists, you should be able to find enough evidence to make a positive statement about it.      We can't. For a very good reason.      The fact that you, also, can provide no evidence only adds to our assertion.      (PS: Please don't fall into the wind, gravity, love etc trap. No, we can't see these things - we can see their effects, though).

This  a difficult situation because these people are the same field as a family member. We are going to have a gathering at house. Should I excuse myself from the event and say I do not feel well. I am trying to let the situation get under my skin.
