My boyfriend is Puerto Rican and black but used to his mom cookin classic spanish dishes. I would really love to get back to my culture and to please my man. Any classic or just delicious dishes would be greatly appreciated.
20090203140134AA1fPbW	Food & Drink;Vegetarian & Vegan	Is it wrong to eat meat?	I am a philosophy student in my second year of A-levels. A little while ago, we were having discussions on eating meat. I do eat meat, and was arguing for it. But, the more I argued, the more I realised it's wrong to kill animals to eat it. These are the reasons why it's wrong:      1) We've been doing it for a long time.   A:This doesn't mean it is the right thing to do. We used to believe slavery was right for a long time, before we questioned it. Just because it had been going on for so long didn't make slavery right.      2) We're more intelligent.   A: Yes, but this still doesn't make it right. Using this argument means it should be perfectly acceptable to eat people with mental disabilities, but it is obviously not. It is speciest.      3) We breed animals to eat.   A: Again, true but this again does nor make it right.   Imagine aliens come to our planet, who are much more advanced than us, and tell us they are going to eat us. We protest saying it's not fair, but they simply say, 'but you eat the lower species on your planet'.    We then argue that we breed them for this. They reply; 'we've been breeding you for years. You've obviously not known about it until now'.   Animals do not know they are being bred for food.      I do not want to give it up, but it is hypocritical of me to carry on eating it, as I do not believe it is right. Should I therefore become a vegitarian?

20090225020726AAwB8t0	Food & Drink;Vegetarian & Vegan	Eating meat, dairy, egg, honey etc occasionally when under pressure is still vegan?	By the definition of veganism.   [T]he word "veganism" denotes a philosophy and way of living which seeks to exclude — as far as is possible and practical — all forms of exploitation of, and cruelty to, animals for food, clothing or any other purpose; and by extension, promotes the development and use of animal-free alternatives for the benefit of humans, animals and the environment. In dietary terms it denotes the practice of dispensing with all products derived wholly or partly from animals.      The little bit there "as far as is possible and practical" would mean it's okay. I know that I don't but I just feel frustrated when the vegan police come out in full force because someone once gave into peer pressure, a craving or made a mistake.   Do you think we need to change the definition to make "the vegan police" happy or should we all just remind ourselves these "accidents" are okay?   THANKS!

20090225022230AAyFg62	Food & Drink;Other - Food & Drink	What do I do if I ate raw chicken from a restaurant?Now I'm starting to get sick out my backend. I'm scared.?	My son asked me to order a pizza from a known pizza place. I ordered the pizza and I ordered the  mild buffalo wings(red in color). Once they were delivered we began to watch a show on tv and talking with my son. I noticed they were nice and meaty. I ate approx 6 before before i noticed some where red to the bone and closer look and saw what i was eating were extremely raw to the bone. I stopped eating them and no longer ate any more. Within a hour my stomach began to cramp some. It's now 7hours later and I woke from a sound sleep to run to the bathroom with diarrhea and continued cramping. I'm scared. What do I do? aside from making sure i have a good supply of toilet paper. What is gonna happen and who do i call? i.e. hosp. dept of health, the restaurant. Or am I just over reacting. How soon will this pass? I'm not throwing up at this time but feeling nauseous with pain. Please advise me? I'm  a little scared, this has never happen to me. Thanks.
