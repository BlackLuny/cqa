20090307183925AAPPL1e	Pets;Dogs	Is your spouse an animal lover too?	I'm sad to say that while my fiance does love pets he doesn't share the same enthusiasm as I do for them.   I recently (yesterday lol) opted to take home an 8(?)yr old cat that was scheduled for a euthanasia.    -Let's just say my fiance wasn't completely thrilled with the idea of me having two puppies(rescued both) and now a cat when I told him. lol.      (He knew what he was getting into-I work at a vet clinic-and while he is away if I can save a animal I will!)      Does your spouse share the same love for animals like you have?

I would be thankful that they are being given a second chance, if possible. I would be furious that a pet has been hurt in any way.      It they have been abandoned, I still wouldn't be happy, but thankful that they have been rescued.      Do others feel the same way?

20090307193121AA0jcI0	Pets;Horses	How has the market economy effected your "horse economy?"?	A common theme on YA is how the horse economy has fallen. Most specifically, the horse sale end of things. I live in Bucks County, PA. It is more of an upper end area that concentrates mostly in hunter/jumpers and eventing. People are not selling their horses as quickly as they would have a year ago, but they ARE selling and for good prices too. How is the current economy effecting your area? Are horses really going for next to nothing? Have feed prices increased? Tack prices? Just curious.

20090307192129AAbLyQK	Pets;Rodents	I want to get two hamsters?	Me and my older sister want to have 2 hamsters, one to keep the other company. but the person at the pet shop said that if i get the one i wanted mostly(male panda hamster) i couldn't (or shouldn't) get a female. and if i got another boy, they would fight and it would be a waste of money cuz i'd have to bring one back.  ive read some advice on here, and now ppl are telling me that the males are LESS likely to fight.       We just bought this really high-tech cage the holds AT LEAST 2 hamsters. its full of tubes and wheels and stuff like that. so if i did get another, would they have enough room to play without irritating each other? anyway, my 2 main q are:      1: Can i get one more hamster to keep Koda(hamster #1) company or was the person at the store lying?   2: will they REALLY try to hurt each other?      Thanks!

20090227100040AAdcKyU	Pets;Other - Pets	HELP!! What are the consequences about my rabbit being in a shed that was on fire?	In the winter we keep my rabbit in a shed heated with a paraffin stove.    My dad maintains the stove, making sure it is topped up etc.   We have since moved the rabbit out of the shed and back outdoors.       But i went into the shed today, and I saw there had been a fire!! EVERYTHING covered in black soot, walls, ceiling.. windows flowerpots... Now for some reason my dad did not tell me about this fire......Anyway, My rabbit was in her hutch while the fire was burning (presumably then, my dad put it out, and moved the rabbit hutch outdoors again) My rabbit seems perfectly normal, this is surprising as there was a good layer of soot on her hutch and food bowl upon closer inspection.       Do you think she will be alright?!      Also, why would my dad not tell me about this?!?!?   What should I say to him when he gets home, should I be angry?

20090227101843AAKDzg8	Pets;Dogs	How do i stop food and toy aggression?	we have 2 dogs 2 yr old doberman mix(female spayed) and 5-6ish month old aussie mix(male neutered). the pup is a great dog when its just those two with the toys.  When we first got him we feed him out of our hands, stuck our hands in his food, and pet him. So he would get used to people by his food and hes great with people touching him or his food.  We started to feed him in his cage and the dobie would lay next to his cage while he ate and then started to lay half in his cage( she is 70+# and to big for his cage) with him when he was eating, she would even stick her nose in his food. He was perfectly fine with that. wag his tail and lick her muzzle.   I took him home with me last weekend and he met my parents dogs (male and female terrier mixes both fixed) and feeding time he jumped at the sides of the cage growling when they walked by they showed no interest in him or his food they were walking to another room.  he was very aggressive with toys and feeding time, He growled and snapped at them when they looked at any toy near him. This only happened the first night after that he was fine and would drink out of the bowl of water at the same time. This also happened when we took him to a friends house to play with her lab pup.  when he did this we said no and removed him from the area and took the toy from all of them.  it was a tennis ball mostly.   He met my friends adult lab(male neutered) and was fine sharing his toys with the lab no growling or aggression.  I would like to stop this and resolve it before it gets any worse,  any suggestions?    I talked to a trainer and she said it would go away on its own the more hes with them and the more time he spends with other dogs that hes not familiar with.   We have been trying to socialize him as much as possible but he caught kennel cough at the animal shelter before we got him so we tried to keep him away from other dogs as much as possible till we were sure he was healthy again.

I decided against pet insurance and thought it would be good to have a credit card specifically for pet use (like Vet visits, supplies, etc.).

I am aware of that option (obviously) but I'm looking for a card that will give me pet-specific rewards before I do that. (Visa gave double rewards and discounts for Vet visits and stuff like that.)

They often do no research, no testing, no vet visits. I was just wondering, what would you guys do or say if it was a friend or a cousin doing this? Would you verbally berate them (which sometimes they deserve) or would you kind of passively offer your disagreement with their decision to breed? I have a cousin who has been breeding his labs for profit (like there aren't enough around), and I think he's going about it irresponsibly. But I don't want to cause a lot of drama in the family, since I don't know him especially well and he wouldn't listen to me anyway.       What would you all do?

It shrunk and then swelled the week of the neuter, I brought the dog back 2 times and the Vet told me that he needed to wear a collar because he was licking his incision.  So I did. Finally the incision closed after 10 days. But now, a whole month later, I noticed the area of the incision was red. The incision was closed but the skin was reddish/pink. Now it's a bump and his scrotum is swollen again. The vet is not open until Monday at 8am. If I phone them, they may not tell me to come in, so I am just going to show up. But in the meantime, I'm wondering if this is serious. :(   Here's a photo I just took:    http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3656/3336...

20090307202725AAwabUb	Pets;Dogs	Help with neighbor's dog? Legal recourse?	Hi everyone,      I live in Michigan and am wondering if anyone can help me with my neighbor's dog?      We live in a semi-rural area and our neighbors have a roaming dog and an electric fence (supposedly) that hasn't worked in the five years we've lived here.      I'm a dog owner and lover myself, but my dog stays on my property SUPERVISED.      Their dog comes onto our property constantly. He chases my livestock. If I am riding my horse his owners will let him out of their house and he will come barreling at my fence barking and growling.      My fence is 15 ft from the property line. He urinates on my fruit trees which are just on the other side of the fence.       I have come home to see him ripping apart a wild rabbit on my front lawn.      Thankfully he seems to prefer my other neighbors lawn for leaving his poop (though they are as happy as I am about it all ) :P      We have tried talking to the owners several times, both politely and not. The owners blow us off and swear their dog never leaves their yard. They just like drama and talking to them isn't working.      The dog is over here at least once or twice a week, and any time I try to ride my horse. He interferes with the enjoyment of my property.      Do I/my neighbors have any sort of legal recourse? What do I do if I have children visiting and he comes into my yard barking and growling like he does with me?       I don't think he's a mean dog at heart, his owners are just irresponsible jerks.      And again, if I can be a responsible dog owner, I don't understand their refusal to respect others property.

20090307201751AAOICeJ	Pets;Cats	Why haven't people gotten the word about spaying and neutering their cats?	I see question after question, after question about pregnant cats - is my cat is pregnant, what should I do with my pregnant cat, my cat just had kittens, etc.      Why don't people understand that the responsible thing to do is have cats spayed or neutered?      So called Kitten Season is starting and I know that there will be more and more questions about pregnant cats.      How in the world do we get the word out to all of these people before they let their cats have kittens?      I know that this is a universal problem but there must be some way to make people understand the necessity of spaying or neutering their cats.      Yeah - I am preaching to the choir but it has just got me going right now.

Once i scared him because he was coming on a side of the door and he was on the other and i scared him because i was scared. The only time he likes to snuggle is when i come from school, and that lasts like 3 minutes. i try to get him to  sleep with me by pounce treats. He comes for the treats and goes. or rarely, he goes about  like 1/2  a foot away.        How do i make him love me?   I dont want him to live a life like a alley cat where he cant trust anyone.

20090307201838AALpHvB	Pets;Dogs	Potty training with new puppy?	I have one 8 month old Red Heeler and just got a 20 week old Blue Heeler from a shelter because they were going to put her down. Anyways, they keep chasing each other around whenever I let them out to go to the bathroom, and I have no idea how to get them to stop so the younger one can have a chance to find a place to pee. She peed in the house once already, and I don't want to have to clean it up again.   Anyways, here's what I've tried:   Putting the younger one on the chain outside for a little while (we don't have a fence yet) so she had some alone time to pee.   I've sat outside with both dogs and held the older dog (Ozzie) so the younger one wouldn't get chased/herded around the yard.   Sat outside while Ozzie was inside and Luna (the younger one) was outside.      But, with everything Luna just wants to play with Ozzie... so... I have no idea what to do. Please help! Potty training was so easy with just one dog!!!      Thanks!

20090307201619AAYF0h7	Pets;Cats	Cat pee problem [female]?	Ok. I am starting to have a little problem. I have 6 cats. 1 of those 6 is not mine and is living with my uncle in the basement. We keep her seperate from the rest.   It started a while back when one of my cats would pee on things when she got mad and just to clear this out of the way, all of the cats are females and all but 2 are spayed. Well, one of my cats we got from outside many years ago. She never peed on anything but eventually joined in this freak-show with the rest of them and started to Pee on stuff when they became mad. It became still after a while and they stopped peeing as often...   But then it started with my cat, shadow.   The two who would pee on things when they were mad are Pie and Binx.   Shadow would pee on my clothes that I had laying on the floor because I dont do laundry until Fridays-Sundays. I didn't notice it one day until i picked up a shirt, put it on, and it smelled aweful. I was feeling horrendous and took a shower all that day because of it but lord! Come to find, all my clothes in that area had pee on them.   I at first thought she did this because she was mad or had a urinary track infection. This can't be the case because We have lots of litter boxes all in the house and she should be able to make it so cross off "can't make it to the litter box" on the list and cross off "urinary track infection" since they all got checked out by the doctor. Last one on the list is "mad" and Its the only reason I can find they are peeing.   So, Shadow developed this habit not from binx or pie I think because she is scared of our giant dog downstairs and is trapped upstairs with me. So I feel like she pees in my room because of it and outside my door in the corner when I get home or when she's trapped outside my door at night.   So I decided to get a kitty litter box and set it in the corner she pee's in all the time to hopefully fix this.   No, it didn't. She peed on my clothes, in the bathroom, and all over the damn place BUT the kitty litter box. What the heck?   so I am not sure what exactly to do. I was so pissed off that I took my cat and shut her in the bathroom but that's when she peed in the bathroom.   I don't want to have to get rid of her because we rescue animals, and I love her, but how can I make HER stop peeing all over the freaking place? She only does it in my room and now it's starting to drift to the steps. It's god aweful and I feel emberresed when people come over because of the smell..although I do try to clean it the best of my ability and use this special "cat pee cleaner" stuff that gets rid of the smell.   I recently have also been using a potty training spray too but that's no help.   What can I do? Should I try a different litter? I need help because My mom is ready to give her away and I dont want that to happen. Help please

I turned around to a noise (not by him) and saw him staggering towards me. He couldn't control his back legs and his back was arched really high. He never whined or yelped in pain, and he still wagged his tail when we talked to him. My husband thought it was a charley horse so he massaged both sides of his back legs, and then I held him and massaged his back. After awhile he was able to walk like normal again. What happened?  There was nothing eaten today that could have harmed him if he found any on the floor. He doesn't really get table scraps (none at all today) He doesn't chew on things.  Any clues?

It's been bugging me ever since because I still don't know what it is. The pictures aren't very good because I was taking them through a window with a screen.

It may be something else, though.    http://i367.photobucket.com/albums/oo111...     http://i367.photobucket.com/albums/oo111...     http://i367.photobucket.com/albums/oo111...     http://i367.photobucket.com/albums/oo111...     http://i367.photobucket.com/albums/oo111...

20090307212324AAqXT0M	Pets;Dogs	Is anyone sick of seeing more and more "designer" puppies?	I think the "designer" dog problem is getting way out of hand and is getting worse and worse. There are more adds for these puppies then anything else and there are thousands of them everywhere you turn.       People are getting the idea that they can cross anything now, give it a fancy name....and there you go $$$!! They are calling them "rare" and "unique colors", and even "healthier" and completly "hypoallergenic".       The worse part is, they are taking away so many chances for mixed breeds in the shelters to find homes, and steering people away from buying registered purebreds....why buy a registered purebred when you can get a fancy combination puppy for $2000s...which alot will end up in shelters anyways!      What are your opinions on this?   Do you think its becoming a problem?   Will it only get worse?

I came home one morning and found an egg on their cage, and then by the end of the week it was 4. I put their cage in a secluded area, and make sure they have plenty of nesting materials, and fresh food & water, but I never see her or her mate actually sitting on the eggs. Are they supposed to sit on the eggs? If so, why would they not be sitting on them, and will they hatch without being sat on? At 2 weeks is there a way to find out if they are fertilized? They do guard them like crazy, the parents are pets, and used to be affectionate, but now when we reach in the cage to give them food or water, they bite.

20090307210728AANqkRs	Pets;Dogs	Good playmate for my bullie?	What is a good breed that would be able the rough play with my English Bulldog puppy?  She is 4 months old.  I want to make sure she develops into a well rounded and socialized dog.  We are thinking of getting another puppy or dog to become her sibling but what would be a good breed that could handle to rough play style?  She isn't aggressive at all she just tends to throw her weight around.  If anyone has a bulldog they know what I mean.  She is a bully.  She bullies her way through anything just about.  She is a klutz too.  I don't want a breed that either could get hurt when they are playing. I appreciate you help.
20090307214202AAsqJkt	Pets;Horses	Choosing a good first horse?	My mother and I are looking to get a first horse, my mother has ridden horses when she was younger, but I've only ridden a few times. We have a place to board it and someone who would teach us how to care for it and such.      We're looking for a larger horse, something that would be good for a slightly large green rider. We'd go for an older horse, but we need a little help in selecting a breed(s) to look at, as a starting point.      We don't want something as large as a Clydesdale, but something larger than an average horse  you be nice.      We're not going to do anything more than going trail riding for pleasure, so we don't want a breed that is very 'spirited', so to say; a breed that can be called lazy would be perfectly fine for us!      Also, we live in Quebec, Canada, so a breed that can tolerate cold well is a must!      I hope this is enough information and I welcome any info given, thank you!

I've seen at least 20 different purebreeds and tons of mixes.  I like watching the little guys interact with each other and their owners to get a better idea of what kind of dog I want.  Are there any dog owners out there who would find it weird for a person to watch you play with your dog if they were upfront about their reasoning? Or would it seem too freaky?
20090307215121AAMEzur	Pets;Dogs	Angry 3 month old staffie. Please help!?	My partner and I have had our staffordshire bull terrier since he was 6 weeks old, and has always been very bitty and slightly agro, but settles down after a while.    We got him de sexed about 11 days ago, and he had to wear one of those "cones" around his head. We got the stitches and cone off him yesterday, but now he seems to be more angry. His biting a lot harder than usual and is more aggressive as well.   I know staffies can be quite aggressive when they are puppies, but its gotten worse after yesterday (when the stitches were taken out, and the cone was taken off) Could they be related?      Any help would be greatly appreciate,      Thanks.

20090307222914AAWPZGm	Pets;Cats	Why is my cat like this?	I have 4 dogs (2 female and 2 male) and a male cat. He gets along with all of them except one. One of my dogs were a runt when he was born, and we believe he might have a few mental issues (Nothing serious, just sometimes his eyes are strange. Guess it's like a lazy eye? :P), not sure if this would contribute to my cat's behavior. My cat protects himself against the dogs... either growling or pawing at one of them, but with this dog he acts differnt. Either rubbing against him, following him, or acting aggressive for no reason. I know this sounds strange, a cat acting dominant to a dog, but it's true.

First off, can they be housed in a large sterlite or rubber maid tub? If so, what should their home consist off? Do they smell like turtles do? Just tell me about your experience with them if any. (:

20090307210723AAtpuud	Pets;Horses	I need a bit for my green 10 y/o paint mare.?	She's a very sweet little mare and at one time or another she was very well trained, however, she's been a companion horse for the past 3 years. She tends to tank on the bit and is very very stiff. Though I know the stiffness will subside with time and training, the tanking needs to stop now. It is becoming a bolting hazard in any gate quicker than the trot. I'm riding in a D-ring snaffle but I think I need something a  little stronger with a bit more leverage as I am not one play a continuous game of tug o war with her. She has a bit of a temper and If you fight with her to long, it does lead to light rearing which is a habit I would really rather not have her learn, however let go on the pressure and she'll immediately take off. Any advice on a bit that she would respect and let me ride with light hands?
20090307212111AAO4lON	Pets;Horses	Need a bit for my 10 y/o Paint mare?	She's a very sweet little mare on the ground, and at one time or another she was very well trained, however, she's been a companion horse for the past 3 years. I'm riding her in a D-ring snaffle, she's very very stiff. Though I know the stiffness will subside with time... She also tanks on me quite a lot. This needs to stop now. She doesn't respect the bit I currently have and I'm not going to go around playing a game of tug o war with her. If you fight with her to long, she starts doing some light rearing, if you give her her head to try and stop the tanking she simply bolts. She ignores all half halts entirely and I'd really rather her not pick up rearing as her new habit. I'm thinking I need a slightly stronger bit with a little more leverage. Something she'll respect that will still let me ride with light hands.

20090307220831AAVdcki	Pets;Cats	Will my cats ever get along?	I have a 6 year old neutered male, who has lived with another cat at least twice before (an older female each time). We just got a new cat, who is a 11 month old spayed female, and she is very aggressive!      She growls and hisses and screams at him, and when she is free to roam her first move is to try and attack him. We've been keeping them separated and trying to entice them with food and treats near each other, but I can't tell if there is any progress being made.      I'm not sure what to do, my poor boy is so confused lately, and they both hate being cooped up in another room while their humans are elsewhere. I'm not sure what to do when it turns out the NEW cat is so aggressive, usually I've heard it's the resident cat that has the issues.      Any help/advice would be welcome! Will she ever learn to get along with him? Or are we going to have to give her back?

20090227112356AA9tWzv	Pets;Rodents	Question about ear mites in rat?	Hello, I work in a pet store, and one sweet heart of a rat now has ear mites.  I did not work the past few days, and when I returned, I found she'd tore herself up pretty badly in an effort to scratch the insane itch.  I recognized the rust brown spots in her ear immediately.   I took her to the vet, they cleaned her up (she'd scratched herself pretty  badly) and medicated her.  She's now in isolation.   My question is, how do they get ear mites?   Were do they come from?   I am in charge of the carefresh bedding changes (it's a paper pulp used on the rats, guinea pigs and chinchilla's) so I know that is done at least once a week, and is done well.  The whole cage is scrubbed down and everything is fresh.  I do not, however, handle the aspen bedding (wood chips used for mice and hamsters).    She's also alone.  I call her a little girl, when reality is she's full grown and is housed alone.  So she has not contact with the incoming baby rats.   Could it have still been spread?  No one else in the store is currently showing signs.   Thanks : )
20090307230724AAvZaGT	Pets;Horses	Selling my arabian filly for a haflinger?	im having a really hard time deciding if i should find a new home for my arabian filly, shes really sweet but A LOT to handle and im only 16!! i was supposed to get a filly that me and my mom could break together and my mom can handle her pretty well but she thinks she is to much for us. we only got her because the person desperatly needed to get her a home due to money issues. Now my friend offered me a really bombproof haflinger. my mom has broken horses before so we could definitly finsihing breaking this one. i think this would be a perfect horse for me to break because although i have lots of horse experience arabs are a little to much for me. my mom really wants me to get the haflinger and sell my arab because she doesnt trust her since she has kicked us 2 times already and flees a lot. its hard though because i really love her but at the same time i think it would be best for all of us. so my questions are 1. do you think id be making the right choice selling her? and 2. are haflingers good horses? i want a horse that is calmr then an arab but i dont want one that will be really lazy either lol   somthing in between would be nice, is a haflinger good for stuff like jumos,barrels,etc???   thanks (:

I have a horse that can't really be ridden at the moment ( long story) so I'm lunging her but the problem I have is with walk/halt transitions - she won't do them, she just keeps walking until I actually go out to her and halt her. She does it fine if she's walked in hand but not on the lunge.   It's not just me - I have had a friend ( with more lunging experience than I have) lunge her and she got the same result. All other transitions are fine it's just this one.   Is repetition the key or do I need to introduce another strategy ?

20090227115959AA0DLV1	Pets;Cats	My cat was hit by a car...I think.?	this morning I opened the door for my outdoor/indoor cat, lobster. he didn't show up. I shook his food bag, but he didn't come running like he usually does. after worrying a little bit, I notice in the distance something laying on the side of the road right in front of our lawn. my boyfriend told me it was lobster. I wasn't sure if it was because lobster has a mother, who is much bigger but identical to him. I put out some food just in case it wasn't him...      however, while I went to school, my dad picked up the remains and set it aside the house to be buried. when I got home my dad told me that when he picked up the cat, it was nearly twice the size of lobster and twice the weight. also, the food I left out was all gone. this leads me to believe my cat is still alive (but ran away) and the dead one is the mother.      but to make sure, I want to know what happens to an animal after it gets hit; does it swell? and even if it does, is it possible for it to get that big?

My shiba inu (spitz) dog 1 1/2 year old male found a baby rat walking on a wall and jumped up to see it. He and the rats faced each other and sniffed, touched each other's noses. After about 30 seconds I pulled my dog away in case the rat bit him or my dog grabbed the cute little rat. The rat seemed so friendly that I thought it was someone's pet that got away. Have you guys experienced your dog with a baby rat or similar and what is usually the outcome? I know that some terriers would rip them to pieces. My dog would probably play with him till the rat got tired or bit him. Wish I had a camera.

20090227114755AAkApEF	Pets;Dogs	A big choice about dog training school.....need some input please?	I always second guess every decision I make.  I have asked questions on here before about dog behavior problems and most people are mean.  However they recommended training. So I looked into different ones.  I finally picked one because I needed a lot of help with my dog.  It is odd because my area does not offer training and I never see anyone walking there dogs and training is a little taboo here or not known about.  My vet could not even provide me with a trainer reference.  So this is all new to me.        OK  there are two schools that caught my eye.  I went with the one farther away and most expensive lol...   I met the people and had a great feeling about them.  However I have never taken a dog to training before.     The trainer had experience 15 years and starts with treats then takes them away.  He said he uses confidence building with toys and games.  The owner and the trainer met me at the door which I thought was impressive and answered a lot of questions I had.  I stayed for about an hour or more talking with them.  The facility was nice and I feel I am paying for it though.  My dog's room even has a TV.  I got a tour of the facility and it has a spa, cafe, swimming pool and agility course.  The owner personally owns many dogs the same breed as mine.  I got to see the dogs in action somewhat.  The trainer took my dog and worked with him while talking to us.  He told me he would learn about five commands along with basic behavior.  They said he needed at least two weeks there but a month was the best.  It will cost over $2000 for the month.  He gets at least one hour training each day and I payed for fetch and play 30 minutes and he will go outside 4 times a day to use the restroom.  I took my other dog with me that doesn't have many behavior problems and they said they could do a lot with him in a week.  (He is older and has trouble on the leash).  They said they both could stay in the same room for 24 dollars more a day but that doesn't include the training.     The other facility is where I actually bought the dog from.  The price is cheaper and they learn 11 commands but the off leash commands are not guaranteed and I understand that.  The commands are basically the same as the main five he is learning but a little more detailed such as a sit stay and a down stay.  Plus they learn some hand signals.  The use positive behavior method without treats.  They said that is what they were taught in school to do since the dog isn't always hungry.  They also use a choke collar.  However the other trainer also showed me one that he may use to train him with.  It had triangle like metal things on it.  So I guess they are about the same with that part.  But the one I bought him at is not a nice facility.  I have seen it and I am sure it would be good enough for a dog though.  However they sold me my dog when he was 5 weeks old and I understand that it wasn't a good thing to do now.  This facility provides training of more commands for a much cheaper price.  They even offer protection classes and also train police dogs.  The facility he is in does not do that for insurance reasons they said.     So I am wondering if I should go with the one he is in and if he should stay for just two weeks and let my dog join him next week.  Or let him stay the month and pray it is worth it and let my dog join him later. ...Or go and get him sooner and take him to the other place for private training or to stay there.  I have no dog trainers in my area so they said it would be good to leave him there instead of driving an hour and half each week for lessons.  I have a pretty open schedule though.     My dog has been there 4 days.     I am just confused and don't want to get ripped off and I don't want my dog to be unhappy and I don't want to be unhappy.     Any advice?      Here are the links.        http://www.uptownhounds.com/        http://www.chaparralk-9.com/

The microchip is DATAMARS, but where can i internationally register them?

20090307231409AAf53Tg	Pets;Dogs	My dog barks at aboriginies?	Hi, please note this is NOT a racist question I just need assistance please. I live in Australia and we have a three month old pup. Over here the aboriginies hang around in groups together and walk slowly down the roads in groups. When they walk past our place, our dog barks frantically at them. Now whenever we are out, and she sees anyone that is black she starts barking at them!!      It is really embarrasing for me, because I don't want people to think I have trained her to bark at black people. She doesn't bark at white people unless they come onto our property or something.      Unforunately I am not in a position to try 'introducing' her to anyone with dark skin, as I am not friends with any ofthe aboriginies and I don't know what to do, can anyone help?      Thanks

20090307224547AAS8yUv	Pets;Cats	Cat has tumor in nose. Will I have to put him down?	Unfortunately, my 8 year old male cat has been diagnosed with cancer. It started with a growth in the right upper side of his mouth. We took him to the vet and had it removed, but just a few weeks later it had spread inside his right nostril, which is now blocked.       He only breathe through one nostril, he used to be fat but now he's all skinny cause he hardly eats anything anymore, and I can no longer hear his sweet little meow.... he looks miserable.      The only thing we can do is keep giving him pills to slow the growth down. We cant afford to pay for another surgery and the tumor will just grow back anyway. Sadly, I feel as if putting him to sleep is the best choice because I don't think any cat should have to live like this.   I don't know what to do, I love him so much and he's trying so hard to pull through.

I would like to have at least 2 more main ideas about dog fighting. Can you think of any?????

I am sick of the pee stains ,the smell of the pee all in the house and him not going in the proper spots      We keep him in a crate 10-13 hrs. of the day (a lot i know but its either that or he destorys the house and we cant afford to hire someone to watch after him, walk him, take him out to pee and poo.)      As soon as we get home we let him out with his buddy a toy poodle ...( the poodle does his bussiness when we say *Go Pee Pee* .... he was trained somehow before we got him and the old owner threw in some trained tricks too lol)       We let schnau-tzu outside then when we let him in he comes straight  in and pees inside ... right after we just let him out!!!!( thing is we let them out 30 mins at a time!!!) ohhhh it makes me so mad... he was just outside!!!!..      Anyway.... is there anyway to fix this...
