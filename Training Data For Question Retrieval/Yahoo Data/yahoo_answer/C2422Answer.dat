QYPrM3GPaa	This is not a paradox, because winning and loosing can happen at the same time and be the same thing.  Often, loosing something immediately can be a strategy to winning something long term.<br>  <br>  Ever hear the old saying, "I shall run away to come and fight another day?"<br>  <br>  Sometimes, in order to gain something, you have to loose something - or visa versa, you have to gain something in order to loose it.  As in - gaining knowledge in order to loose ignorance.  You see, all losses are not always non-beneficial.  Loosing an addiction or habit, for example, can be beneficial.<br>  <br>  There are times during war, when an army must retreat if it is to survive and replenish itself and become viable again.  So there have been times in history when an army withdraws (it is called a Strategic Withdrawl), when for political, economic or military reasons, it is smart to do so).  Then, the enemy is drawn into the vortex, into the vacuum, only later to be surrounded by the army that retreated, captured and vanquished.  So what appeared to be a "loss" turned out to be a strategically planned "win."<br>  <br>  Most likely, in your life, there have been times, when you have had to back off, rather than stand up because the consequences could have been disasterous.  You had to "loose" that in order to "win" your {safety, freedom, save face, retain pride, honor, dignity, etc}.  There is nothing shameful about loosing in order to win - sometimes, it is the only right thing to do, and the only workable alternative.<br>  <br>  Just remember one piece of advise, there is always a THIRD answer to every paradox:  BOTH answers may be true simultaneously! Or FALSE simultaneously.|`|yUudoO1Raa	To lose a toe in an accident means you have your toe.<br>  To die means to live.<br>  To get sick means to get healthy.<br>  <br>  Paradoxes have solutions that render them non-paradoxes. Some paradoxes are so difficult that philosophers or mathematicians spend centuries trying to solve them, but it doesn't mean they don't have solutions.<br>  <br>  And it doesn't mean that your example and mine are not ridiculous.|`|MIw3GCJyaa	Depends what the consequences are.

74edcf791dc4861c0fa85ec65b26f4e3aa	Yes, but I think the real problem is not that you're "tired of reading" but that you're tired of *what* you're reading.  If you read a lot in one genre-- mystery or fantasy or whatever-- the novelty starts to wear off.  The first time you meet a wizard it can be thrilling; even then tenth time.  By the 39th time, it's "Okay, been here, done that." Or a conspiracy book-- there are only so many variations and you start spotting the patterns.<br>  <br>  Best thing to do is to take a break.  Read something very different, maybe a non-fiction book about someone or something you might find interesting.  Try a graphic novel, or a funny book of essays. You might find something else good to read for awhile. Give the authors and editors time to freshen up their ideas before you go back to your preferred genre.|`|B8Gwxo1laa	I have always gone through reading spurts. Sometimes I'm at the library twice in one week, going through 2-3 books. Then for no reason that I can tell, I might not pick up a book for months.|`|11034de0d130c6ac4418af83607e0faeaa	I'll never get tired of reading!<br>  <br>  No, I have been like that lately too.. just haven't found any books that are that terribly interesting...|`|2mXXpuq3aa	Yes.  Take a break from it then start a new book.|`|4XYjZNWeaa	since reading torchwood and twilight books, i can never finish a decent book due to the fact they are  either boring , or they just don't have enough horror or action in them.<br>  I think what everyone needs is a fresh new author with a great story that could be developed like Harry potter books and twilight books<br>  <br>  x|`|IFnrRtMQaa	Yess, I get what you mean, But I think it's just a fact of choosing more interesting books. <br>  Example - I used to be reading lots and lots in the way you've described with books such as Harry Potter and Twilight. But now whatever book I pick up, I just seem to find it boring.. However, If I go back to pick up a Harry Potter/Twilight book, I'll end up reading it just how I used to.<br>  So Infact it's just about the books that interest you.<br>  xx|`|NzVwqpW5aa	Yes, I got to a time where I thought I wasn't reading anything new, just the same ideas in a different setting, and since I feel I know whats going to happen, I get impatient for the author to get to the point. So, reading became more of a trial than a pleasure.|`|5wg7tKc6aa	I love to read, but I find it difficult to commit, or concentrate on books that hardly interest me.  So it's rare I stumble upon an all nighter read.|`|cMMud1usaa	Yes I'm afraid it has happened to me before. I think I might be that I have grown bored of reading, but I'm not really sure. I have a whole bunch of books in my house that I haven't finished yet but are very interesting. On the other hand I have a few books that I finished also. The thing is, I think you are starting out too heavy. If you can't seem to finish a book, then put it down and get something that is light and funny. Something short with a predictable plot. You need to give your brain a little rest. Thats how it kinda works with me. I read some manga which is not really a book, and funny books that don't take a toll on the brain. Try that. Start out small and grow until you feel comfortable. You just need to refresh yourself and then look for something that catches your interest. <br>  And if that doesn't work for you, don't worry. It hasn't fully worked for me yet either. Its sort of in and out for me. Sometimes I eat books like crackers, other times they make my head hurt. <br>  <br>  Here's a website, maybe you've heard of it, where you can get some light predictable stories. They're based off of other shows and stuff, you'll figure it out.<br>  www.fanfiction.net <br>  <br>  Good luck on your literary quest!<br>  Haahaha, that sounds so weird and stupid.|`|AA10700407	there are times when I can't read enough and times when I can't be bothered.  mostly I want to read because it's a great book.  keep looking and you'll find more to enjoy.|`|6lkNOFNlaa	It's probably just because you haven't found a good enough book.

These include:<br>  ***Mind Reading<br>  ***Mind Controlling or mentally communicating with others, including the ability to overload another's mind causing pain, memory loss, change, or enhancement, lack of consciousness, vegetative state or death after having created a psionic link into that person's mind.<br>  ***Reading emotions<br>  ***Controlling emotions<br>  ***Rapid Learning<br>  ***Psychometry, or Knowing something about an item's history (or the owner's history) by touching it, or the a1bility to relate details about the past or future condition of an object, person or location, usually by being in close contact with it.<br>  ***Seeing underwater<br>  ***Seeing in the dark<br>  ***The ability to heal themselves or others (often at an accelerated pace)<br>  ***Breathing underwater<br>  ***The ability to jump or bounce really high<br>  ***The Power to Eat Anything and Everything.<br>  ***Becoming invisible<br>  ***The ability to become "unnoticable"  This is in many ways better then being invisible, though the concept is similar.  Invisible people can't be seen when looked at.  Unnoticable people cause people's eyes to slide right over them so they aren't seen, even though they are visible.  The advantage is that unnoticble people don't leave footprints in mud or snow, and they are silent, whereas invisible people can give themselves away through footprints or loud noises.<br>  ***Partial or full Shapeshifting or the power to transfigure themselves and other people/things<br>  ***Talking to animals<br>  ***Super Strength<br>  ***Super Speed<br>  ***The ability to fly, or the ability to lift off the ground, to ride air currents or to fly self-propelled through the air.<br>  ***The ability to make magical shields<br>  ***The ability to control technology<br>  ***Teleportation<br>  ***Being able to build anything (like forge)<br>  ***Super Flexibility (like elastagirl from the incredibles) or the ability to stretch, deform, expand or contract one's body into any form they can imagine.<br>  ***The ability to turn partially or completely into a liquid.<br>  ***Ability to draw energy from surroundings (or themselves) and project it at enemies<br>  ***Telekinesis or the ability to control and manipulate inanimate objects<br>  ***The ability to control the weather (Storms and lightening when angry, wind when scared, rain when sad, sunny when happy, etc.)  this is closely related to the next one:<br>  ***Causing Natural Disasters (earthquake or a meteor strike, tornado or hurricane)<br>  ***Mimicry (voice mimicry, or the ability to mimic others' powers or skills)<br>  ***Color Changing, the ability to change the colors of things around you to confuse people or create camoflague for yourself<br>  ***Scrying, or knowing/seeing the future or flashes of the past.<br>  ***Ability to generate acid, poison, gas, or some lethal or harmful substance<br>  ***Power derived through objects: a magic sword, magic jewel, magic jewelry, seven league boots, magic armor, magic wand, etc.<br>  ***Slipperiness: There are quite a number of heroes and villains whose superpower is to be hard to hold onto or “nearly frictionless<br>  ***Ability to duplicate themselves or create the illusion of duplication<br>  ***Here's a silly one: the the power to control your hair as an extra limb, like medusa used her snake hair to attack people<br>  ***The ability to sense lies, danger, poison, trechary, fear, alterior motives, etc.<br>  ***Echolocation, or the ability to determine location of items in the environment by use of reflected sound waves, whether generated by the character or ambient sound. Also known as sonar or radar sense.<br>  ***Invunerability, or the ability to not be hurt by flesh wounds, or illness, or to be immune to one or more forms of physical damage.<br>  ***Adaptation, which can be temporary or permanent<br>  ***Explosion and Regeneration (the ability to explode and then reform)<br>  ***Superhuman reflexes or endurance<br>  ***Superhuman Senses, or the ability to see, smell, taste, feel and/or hear more than a normal human.<br>  ***Night or Xray or Laser or Telescopic Vision<br>  ***Tracking-the ability to track something or someone successfully.<br>  ***The ability to petrify (freeze) or free someone who has been petrified<br>  ***Ability to create or manipulate darkness, often by mentally accessing a dimension of dark energy  OR Ability to control, generate or absorb photons (particles of light).<br>  ***Ability to disintegrate matter through touch or through beams<br>  ***Gravity manipulation<br>  ***Ability to transform into any substance touched/exposed to/imagined<br>  ***Immortality, or the ability to live forever. This may be complete immortality encompassing invulnerability, partial invulnerability to all but specific events (i.e., decapitation or exposure to a specific chemical such as kryptonite), or simply an inability to age normally<br>  ***Ability to phase through solid matter without harm<br>  ***Ability to affect the flow of time by slowing, accelerating, reversing, or stopping it.<br>  ***Timetravel<br>  ***Ability to increase or decrease one's size<br>  ***Temperature control or the ability to reduce the kinetic energy of atoms and thus increse or reduce temperature, can be used to control, generate, or absorb ice or fire<br>  <br>  <br>  As you can see there are many different types of power, some just variations of the same idea.

DiRI58buaa	Plato liked the realm of the "ideal forms".  He believed that our world is just a cheap imitation and the way to real truth was by perceiving the true forms of everything.  Now art is a cheap imitation of our world.  So Art to Plato is a cheap imitation of a cheap imitation.  Seeing as Plato thought that the virtuous man was the happiest man and that virtue is knowledge, he had a problem with art being frivolous and a step in the wrong direction.
irQMTt5maa	I like the style of the excerpt you've included in your answer, and I understand that the romance genre tends to be full of dramatic descriptions, but I agree with other answerers that it seems like you're trying to fit a lot of information in via them... for example, the 'dusty uncurtained window' is atmospheric, but the way it's added on to the end makes the sentence seem rather like a list. <br>  <br>  If I were to edit this, I'd change 'love-lit', which is a pretty and poetic phrase but sounds a little over-the-top in prose IMHO, to a single word which similarly describes her eyes and the emotions they convey... how about 'lambent'? It can mean either 'luminous, softly twinkling or radiant', or 'flickering or moving lightly over a surface', both of which could possibly apply in that context. I'm sure you can think of a better word to suggest the atmosphere you're aiming to create, though.<br>  <br>  Also, I was a little confused by this sentence: '....until at last he drew her to him and she clung to him, and felt the shudder as a sob broke from deep within him as she started to cry.'

It's not quite clear.<br>  <br>  Thanks for posting it though, I enjoyed reading it, and good luck with writing the rest of it!|`|lhrQNbZQaa	i thought it was slightly naff when i first read the question, but its quite nice the way you've used it in your story.<br>  good for you, writing a novel!!!|`|02JUswskaa	Adjectives rarely add anything to your writing, and will always give you away as a new writer. Remove them and you'll usually find your work has more impact.<br>  <br>  "She had turned to him,smiling; her face illuminated by the light filtering through the dusty, uncurtained window. They gazed at each other, absorbing each flicker in the other's eyes, until he drew her to him and they embraced...."<br>  <br>  I left 'dusty' and 'uncurtained' because I feel they add to the setting.<br>  <br>  Admittedly, doing this can be painful as it alters your intended rhythm, but it's a necessary step. Remember, less is often more. <br>  <br>  At the moment your writing is a little 'flowery'.<br>  <br>  However, you do have a very good imagination and a bent for words, and of course that's an essential quality in any writer. But you do need to write 'tighter', and create your rhythm and mood through such devises as word choice, sentence structure and subject matter etc.<br>  <br>  Well done. I sense a spark there.|`|OjQxKGC0aa	It is naff, but I'm sure you knew it or you wouldn't have asked. The rest is very good. <br>  <br>  The rule is simple: write with concrete nouns and active verbs; avoid adjectives and adverbs. "Love-lit" is an adjective. Cut it. The rest of the paragraph will be stronger without it. <br>  <br>  Overall, good job!|`|PkXJRfaBaa	Yeah, it is a bit cliché. How about deep, endless eyes?
5e66f381627bd428c703e558425a21ceaa	to guess:<br>  <br>  the tendency of the media to portray all women in a certain way and all men in a certain way.

I have Voldemort's wand, and I carved so many. I have brooms. I cried when I finished. I don't know what I'm going to do either. I have had that consolation of the new movies, but soon that'll be gone. :( But I am still excited|`|YE0bd74Iaa	I'm really excited because i love this series.

(A sophistic argument is one that is overly complex and designed to confuse a subject into compliance. Religious dogma is a prime example.)<br>  <br>  That being said, I think that the challenge to each of us individually is to overcome our social conditioning and create a web of belief that's structured on facts not tradition.

cMMud1usaa	I see, well Im going to try and get you some good stuff:<br>  <br>  Companions of the Night by Vivian Vande Velde<br>  Short, but sweet. Nicely detailed events and characters. It doesn't have a convential ending though.<br>  <br>  Got Fangs<br>  Circus of the Darned<br>  by Katie Maxwell<br>  These 2 are connected and are really good. Its not really a vampire story in a sense, but does have a vampire in it. Its like, there are other (funny) stuff going on in the plot besides vampire things.<br>  <br>  Suck it Up by Brian Meehl<br>  This is another out of the ordinary one. Its not like twilight, but it is really good. Its about boy who is turned into a vampire and he goes to a secret school to learn how to use his vampire powers. The book starts when he graduates, right? So he's, like, chosen by the people to be the first vampire to come out of the closet. Like, he has to prove to the world that vampire exists. So he gets a PR person and becomes like this celebrity and such and such. And theres some romance on the side also.<br>  <br>  And my favorite:<br>  Jessica's Guide to Dating on the Dark Side by Beth Fantaskey<br>  Its great! If you like Twilight, then you'll like this. It also has the high school girl, and the hot vampire but this one is reeeeallly funny and has a better more developed plot. You'll love it, cause its not your typical vampire romance story.<br>  <br>  Non-vampire thingies<br>  Demon Envy by Erin Lynn<br>  Its like, this girl and there's a demon instead of a vampire and they have to do stuff. I'm tired of writing summaries. <br>  <br>  Cindy Ella by I forgot the name<br>  A girl and she likes the popular guy and stuff happens again and you know, the end. <br>  <br>  There was another vampire one, but I can't seem to find it. I think its called Vampireville or town or something. Someone mentioned it already i think.<br>  <br>  Good luck on your quest for thingies.

Similar to space exploration in its infancy although much more of a gamble.<br>  <br>  Their money allowed Columbus to sail into uncharted waters.

pod9nzo7aa	I reckon it shows that nothing is black and white. Everyone see's vampires and think they are evil but in Twilight they are more misunderstood.

But no one is really writing that kind of thing anymore.   Some post modern authors (Thomas Pynchon, Tom Robbins) acknowledge the influence of the beat authors on their work.
iT9S20zvaa	If you liked The Goose Girl, I would definitely recommend Sherwood Smith.  There are two books by this author that fit your criteria (and that I've read).  One is actually a set of two books that can come together; Crown Duel and Court Duel.  This one contains romance (especially in the second book), intrigue, assumptions about identities (not necessarily mistaken identity), and many secrets.  The second recommendation by Sherwood Smith is called A Posse of Princesses (I know...the title...and if you look it up online, the cover...both are horrible, though the book is not.).  This one has secrets, romances, etc.<br>  <br>  Robin McKinley has two books (companion novels that can be read in any order): The Hero and the Crown and The Blue Sword.  The first follows a girl as she sets out to slay a dragon.  The second is about a girl who finds herself after being kidnapped by some desert nomads.  Both contain romance and some action.  One important note about Robin McKinley: she can get a little long-winded when it comes to descriptions.  You have to be patient (if you dislike descriptions) until you reach the good parts.<br>  <br>  The Seer and the Sword by Victoria Hanley contains secret plots, betrayals, romance, etc.  I read this a long, long time ago.  It also has two companion novels; one is called The Healer's Keep, which is alright.  The other I won't mention because it wasn't very good.<br>  <br>  All of the above recommendations fall into a fantasy category.<br>  <br>  For a contemporary read, see below.<br>  --The Only Alien on the Planet by Kristin D. Randle; this one does have one secret and romance.  It's about a girl who decides to help a mute boy.<br>  --The Dark Secrets series by Elizabeth Chandler can be read in any order.  Books in the series: Legacy of Lies, No Time to Die, and Don't Tell.  They contain mystery, romance, some secrets, some supernatural happenings, etc.  <br>  <br>  I hope you find something you enjoy.|`|EDXh0tk9aa	Ender's Game, Orson Scott Card.<br>  .<br>  Nomadin and NiDemon by Shawn Cormier<br>  <br>  Elfshadow by Elaine Cunningham <br>  Dune, Frank Herbert.<br>  <br>  The Warrior Heir, The Wizard Heir, The Dragon Heir by Cinda Williams Chima<br>  <br>  Her Majesty's Wizard by Christopher Stasheff|`|ed1a76b6f16bcbd0d88b32d769c7491baa	Did you finish the goose girl series:<br>  2)Enna Burning, 3)River Secrets<br>  Also from the same author is A Book of a Thousand Days by Shannon Hale <br>  Another vampire series is Vampire Kisses by Ellen Schreiber<br>  There are 6 books in this series
AA10015648	I know you're not joking :) <br>  <br>  Before the series was over, a lot of us wondered if he would be revealed as a vampire, but JKRowling said no, he wasn't. In 2004, a fan asked her <br>  <br>  Megan: Is there a link between Snape and vampires?<br>  JK Rowling replies -> Erm... I don't think so.<br>  <br>  If you're ever looking for info on what JKR has said about anything, just check out <a href="http://www.accio-quote.org" rel="nofollow">http://www.accio-quote.org</a> :D<br>  <a href="http://www.accio-quote.org/articles/2004/0304-wbd.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.accio-quote.org/articles/2004...</a><br>  <br>  But yeah, a lot of us, before the series was over, thought that it might be revealed that he's a vampire. He's always described as bat-like, and you know how he set the essay about Werewolves, to try and get someone to realize that Lupin was a werewolf? Well, right after that, Lupin set an essay about vampires! A lot of us thought he was trying to retaliate, to get people to recognize that Snape was a vampire. Anything that made people think "he couldn't be a vampire" was answered with "well, he's a potions master, he could make a potion that made his teeth normal, or make it so he can withstand sunlight"|`|tJUvzzm0aa	JKR "doesn't think" there is a link between Snape and vampires.

I don't think so.|`|hecLfcedaa	I hate Twilight too, but Eragon's okay. Just should've left it as a book though. Yeah the last book was so cool. A little weird and sooo many people die but a fantastic way to wrap it up. I think snape is just a really good wizard. He wasn't a vampire. Nowhere in the books did it incline that. But one little thing bugged me about the story. That bit about why snape worked for dumbledore was so corny.|`|y5HeFW03aa	You're such a joker...
0KXCAm0baa	Finny denies the reality of the war. That brings Finny and Gene closer together. <br>  <br>  Leper lives in a dream world.<br>  <br>  Finny has trouble admitting to that there are evil people in the world. <br>  <br>  Gene has trouble admitting that he had a darkness in his own soul. Not only pushing Finny from a tree, but his resentment about some people and things there. <br>  <br>  <br>  Hope that helps.

bjdSPiZCaa	wel i think it would b kinda different if the vampires were teens(like 14 or 15) and they were all girls goin 2 a rich pravite school but no one knew what they were...then an evil group of vampires come to their town and start attacking poeple..so they have 2 let out their secert and save the people of the town and drive the other vampires out! There should b 4 charaters and their names should b McKenize,Chelsie,Shelbi, and Autumn! McKenize has powers to control people and is very strong.

Those whom the creatures "mark" as special enter the House of Night school where they will either become vampyres themselves, or, if their body rejects the change, die. To Zoey, being marked is truly a blessing, though she's scared at first. She has never fit into the human world and has always felt she is destined for something else. Her grandmother, a descendant of the Cherokee, has always supported her emotionally, and it is she who takes the girl to her new school. But even there the teen stands apart from the others. Her mark from the Goddess Nyx is a special one, showing that her powers are very strong for one so young.

With growing tension within her pack and her lack of control over her own abilities, she wonders if her boy will love her, or more importantly, if he will survive loving her.

RzbRRUOdaa	You  have a fat chance, Jeff!<br>  <br>  It's good to know that young as you are, you already know your passion.  Go for it and don't stop until you finish that book.  The path to publishing wouldn't be an easy way but the challenges make the journey more meaningful.<br>  <br>  I'm a writer myself and am following several sites that help me with what I do.  Here's a site that could help you with your publishing journey:<br>  <a href="http://selfpublishingjourney.wordpress.com/" rel="nofollow">http://selfpublishingjourney.wordpress.c...</a><br>  <br>  I hope you find this answer helpful.|`|5478d54ea53fcef0ef93502a7e237c89aa	I'd say your chances are slim to none.  How many 14 year old authors do you know of?   It's hard for anyone. I'll bet you haven't even written this novel yet, have you?  Live a little, keep writing, finish your education, and someday you may have something to say to the world.  Be patient.  Writing is NOT a romantic way to make a living.  Only the most famous authors succeed at that---J.K. Rowling, Stephenie Meyer and Stephen King are exceptions.|`|UaCqYFKnaa	You have a 100% chance of getting published! Just like every body else! :)<br>  <br>  If you are looking for self-publishing companies to publish your book, I know of a few companies that practically holds court to everything a book needs from getting you your copyright, size preferences, book cover design customization, layout consultation, copyediting and even marketing – at affordable costs. <br>  <br>  Self-publishing entirely means that you get to retain full control of your book’s production and that it gives you the option to publish your work and claim authority of the photos that you have chosen to be published.<br>   <br>  Publishing is synonymous to getting that copyright for protecting your book which is why it is highly important to publish it.<br>  <br>  You can get free information sent to your mail here and even try to check the quality of their brochure because it is the same as how they publish books. The cost to publish is also listed in detail and in depth.<br>  <br>  I hope I helped.|`|piRLZ9uiaa	Im fourteen and i would like to publish my novel im writing but really? I don't know if i will be able to. I mean JK Rowling got rejected three times.

That sounds implausible.|`|e4tvh1d2aa	you are what you think you are if what you what you think you are is a thinking thing.<br>  say that three times fast.<br>  lol<br>  no, but seriously, you are a thinking mind with a physical extension. that is what you are.<br>  just think about anything related to you, and you will see that all of the things that you associate to "I" are merly thoughts and thought patterns that again at a  nuts and bolts level only chemical and electrical reactions. that are interpreted by the mind/brain.<br>  it is then re interpreted back so that we can comprehend it.<br>  <br>  it is like a computer.<br>  all events on it are electrical, but it is interpreted and reproduced on the monitor.<br>  the monitor is our mind and we can alter the image by adjusting our contrast and brightness.<br>  or in our minds case our background, heritage and chosen moral values.

XfWo7AXhaa	So I have no idea how you can get published, but I want to say WOW. I got goosebumps just reading the preface!<br>  I didn't read all the chapters you had posted, but I got half way through the first one, when she suggests they stay.  I really like the idea of the story, and I like how you start out kind of in the middle of the story line.  This is definitely something I would buy...<br>  The only critiques I would give would be a few punctuation things...like when you wrote two, obviously strong men....I think there should be another comma after strong, because obviously strong is kind an aside, or more a description, and should be set off with commas, if that makes sense...<br>  <br>  Good Luck with Everything!<br>  <br>  <3<br>  Jackie|`|joyEEEMLaa	It sounds like "the daughters of the moon" by Lynne Ewing.

f9Bzd9QZaa	I couldn't find mention of the Hippocratic Oath, but Hippocratic face is alluded to in Henry V, act ii, scene iii, according to this article:
X9vsoxB2aa	Believe in what you believe in. Not what someone else said, "how it's supposed to be". I believe in myself and my own abilities. I need not rely on a higher power to guide me through life, for i am my own rock, my own sword and shield.

IvrZyjrPaa	I do not think your allowing him into your home was because, as you say, you were too civilized. A spark was breathed upon and within your heart you felt its warmth.  You give us no other reasons as to why you let him stay. Had he no other place to go, knowing that you would not turn him away.  You do not say that he had long been forgotten,  that you held lingering thoughts about him.  I would have liked to have heard what your heart was not saying, not knowing seems to make this poem lack something that was meant to be written.  The word civilized should I feel be replaced with sympathetic  For this reader the poem is unfinished.    Robert.|`|0sEspN5baa	I like the first stanza  using b words -  especially the  bearing and the baring -  Begging and baring/bearing  (this brought a visual of turbaned  'beggars' on the streets  of many overcrowded  cities or countries, as well as the  visual and understanding that  men are sometimes  referred to as 'bears' - as  in either a teddy bear or  at the worst a brute bear,  and they love to bear gifts  to buy more time, and generally  bare other things quite more  willingly than their hearts, and  usually only a show of heart to  get a foot back in the door.....)    Such an interesting picture  in the second stanza:  the sipping of the tea in  opposition to the desert  man craving sweet water  ----just a really great juxtaposition  visual, all that lovely warm liquidity  and then the dry sandy craving  face to face....    The 3rd grouping of three lines  is almost or IS a Haiku all by  itself of stunning simplicity  (that one may be my favorite)  and visual as well, the way the  length of the lines overlap cause  them to look like steps...and of  course, what is coming are the  steps yet to be taken in this  mini movie.....    and the 2 line clincher   about fair dinkum  regarding 'trust' (the locking of the door)  ---take that, you rascally varmint!

SupWrLRIaa	To reference three pre-Meyer authors who did this as well, we can turn to Stephen King, Ray Bradbury, and Mark Twain. If pressed we could also turn to The Divine Comedy and Paradise Lost, although these were slightly longer. Short prologues almost always appear at the beginning of nonfiction works on history, as well.<br>  <br>  I fear this is another case of Meyer having done the same thing as everyone else and getting credit from her age-market because she is simply so ubiquitous as to overwhelm.|`|KCxbbPmjaa	first of all, Meyer's prologues are like little tasters into the book's climax, to make the reader buy the book and make her more money (not that she needs it). and it works. other wannabe authors might mimic it to try and entice readers to buy their books.<br>  <br>  me? i use it to show and insight to a mysterious group of characters that will be met later on, so the reader can try and link it to someone.|`|LCho6a5zaa	I do actually agree with you. I am also very inspired by Stephenie Meyer and her works (by the way thanks again for enlightening me on the actual "big deal", I suppose you could say, about just downloading the books online. Don't worry I will never think to do that again, not that I ever actually did, thanks to you, thanks again [:). She is a brilliant author and extremely creative. I think that many "young people" as you put it are inspired by her creativity. They want to be creative and write a hit as well, so when they try to be creative Twilight just comes to their mind... subconsiously I guess you could say. And they may copy her without even thinking about it. I think that it is wrong to copy styles, but good to get.. inspiration. Some people just don't know the difference. Hope I helped, good question.<br>  <br>  P.S. Yes, I get it now, thanks again (:

However, the Protestantism wasn't uniform--there were still Catholics who suffered many civil penalties for their refusal to conform to the Church of England, as well as many Dissenters who felt that the Church of England retained far too many vestiges of Roman Catholicism.|`|d04ae6ff8e12fe20d1db30d24b4bc806aa	Officially, The Church of England (Anglican).

Well, at least not die an "untimely death" before 200-300 years of age.  Also, perhaps, just perhaps, the future will finally persuade people that their god(s) had nothing to do with creation and that Darwin was right.

i0J7K5Txaa	To be completely honest and this is in no way a post to "shoot down" your dream of being an actor.<br>  <br>  Your 14, you should just enjoy what time you have as a teenager.  All to often you hear of child actors in their older years because they never got to be a kid it reflects on their course of actions in the future.<br>  <br>  I say this with the most positive intentions: LEARN WHO YOU ARE BEFORE YOU TRY TO PLAY SOME ONE YOUR NOT!<br>  <br>  Not to mention life lessons you will learn (I think the most dramatic ones of all happen around that time in a persons life) will help you more then anything. <br>  <br>  You can always tell a good actor has had some kind of experience in the roll he/she is playing because they have had it or something like it happen outside of the silver screen opposed to some one that took a few classes, scored a lucky roll, and is now making the watcher want to fall in to a comma.|`|Y8kjVeLyaa	I advise you to study hard...and when you are 17 you can audition for three year accredited Drama School courses...at the end of one of these then you are showcased in front of an audience of top agents....the school MUST be one of the accredited ones though...so R.A.D.A., Drama Centre, Lamda, Central School of Speech and Drama....there are more but these are the best...have a look online at their prospectuses....as for an agent now well it would be hard unless you live in London or Manchester....where do you live...then I will advise further.|`|LP7ox8cKaa	casting couch|`|Mig6O93Naa	investigate Stagecoach.  plan to apply to the National Youth Theatre when you can.|`|6nVDPBVsaa	Many people have a chance to become an actor/actress, i live in south west Wales and i've just applied to an agency this year! London is obviously a great place with an array of different drama schools to attend. It will take years to perfect anybodies acting ability and you need good experience. You don't have to apply for the expensive Drama Schools that cost hundreds or thousands. I attend one that only costs ￡65 for 10 weeks and you learn drama, singing and dancing. As you turn 16 your fees will go through the roof and you'll access many more opportunities for auditions. Getting a part with Disney isn't certain as you'll be given what your agent tells you and not vice versa. I would start searching for various drama schools now so you'll be experienced enough when your 16. I'm not advising you to move to London but to search more local areas as i'm sure you'll find something. If you don't get parts don't worry, i'm sure there's many other opportunities and i do warn that it will be a rocky road. Age or height isn't compulsory for parts but they'll obviously look into age groups and so on. Learning other languages isn't important too but you never know what you might get.<br>  <br>  Hope i've helped and Good luck!|`|S01zIagOaa	First, you are young so you have lots of time to develop as an actress. Second, getting an agent or landing on Disney is not where a career starts as it seems you already know. Continue with your workshops and your general education. Apply to Universities with strong theater, entertainment or even gaming media departments. Building a successful career is not a one step process, it will take many, many years and there will be plenty of ups and downs along the way.<br>  <br>  Don't be fooled by the saying, "The business is looking for fresh faces", it sort of is and it sort of is not. At any given time there are too many actors for too few jobs. Especially in this economic environment. "Fresh faces" really translates into new and naive people to throw at the wall and see who sticks around or at least repeatedly gets up after being knocked down. In the meantime those would be actors have to invest in themselves as a business for many years to come before any real return will be seen. <br>  <br>  It would be worth your while to visit a few contemporary bookstores in the U.K. or even Amazon and research the business of being or becoming a working teen or adult actor. <br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|69hve8btaa	there are MANY MANY MANY MANY MANY MANY MANY questions on this topic, search around a bit, instead of wasting ur points on asking these kinds of questions!!!<br>  <br>  HAVE FUN~
d4Uz4FqZaa	I think it's a really good book. I love all the the series. The theme of the book is unique. Then, James Patterson made the book looks as if we are included in the situation itself. So, it looks like the flock is real. Moreover, I like the message that is given in book four. Although people don't like it much, the fourth book had ever been my favorite one. I personally want James Patterson would have never stopped this series.|`|FAUPZeSxaa	I read all of them and I think that they are great.  But I also thought that at times the plot could get confusing and annoying.  Sometimes James Patterson would write something that went back on what had been said before.  Like that time that with Angel betraying them and with Jeb telling them that it had all been a dream.  It also can get predictable, sometimes you know that the Erasers are going to try to kill them or that they are going to escape and that Jeb isn't really dead since they emphasize his death so many times.|`|1OjZoHlkaa	I read them all last year in about a week and thought they were brilliant.

OdoLSDlXaa	Of course, not all things, but everything we do.  Thoughts lead to feelings, feelings to actions, actions to sin or grace.  People don't understand that even belief in Jesus is of the mind.  The sum of all our actions tell the contents of our minds and where our priorities lie. <br>  <br>  The idea leads to Milton who wrote, The mind is it's own place and in itself can make a heaven of hell, a hell of heaven.  So perhaps heaven and hell are in the perceptions.  Some will see Jesus returning as a savior with light and others will perceive the same thing as wrath and fire.|`|1ZJxdMQNaa	Well, as a non-dualist, I would say that heaven and hell are one and the same thing and that you would have to be real hung up on the idea of living an after-life for your mind to always end up focusing on heaven or hell; not everyone thinks dualistically like that, so I would say, it depends on the individual, but overall, no, not categorically.|`|xhpAiWPvaa	all things in the mind begin upon birth<br>  <br>  There is no man in this world throughout history who has been to hell or heaven so to assume there is one or the other you need proof.<br>  <br>  Like a judge judging people everyday will they go to hell cause the bible says dont judge people|`|DNCpCjqjaa	I slightly agree because things you think about usually turn into actions, and actions can either be good or bad, deciding whether or not you go to heaven or hell.  But anything can be forgiven if you ask God for forgiveness.|`|QydVDaXRaa	I wouldn't, because I don't believe in heaven or hell.  I believe that we are all responsible for our actions notwithstanding any forgiveness we feel we may get for them.|`|a9c1dd6670c1521e3428d2a3364911b1aa	Well ya. But we all fall short of Gods kingdom.

DLS60sVBaa	We do because we're curious - and if we're able to map out the thorough course of the passing of time then we're able to engineer present problems more effectively. Besides, it's debatable whether humans really 'didn't exist' at that time... as in, humans didn't just magically appear out of nowhere 4 million years ago or such, so if you think that the primeval 'ancestors' (probably bacteria) have ultimately evolved into the present animal kingdom then we WERE kind of there at the beginning. Of course though, 'we' as a pronoun is flawed just like we can't say we were there during the stone age, even though life did exist.    I-Eye-E: anthropocentric because the subject was 'we' in your question.|`|7WybdnLjaa	It's part of our nature - the drive that pushes us to ask the questions and find the answers.

[add] I am curious to know why you think Humans are unlikely to understand the origins of the universe?  We have barely begun to explore beyond Earth's atmosphere, in the grand scheme of things.  Your pessimism as to our capability seems to be based on a lack of knowledge, which is precisely what the quest for understanding the universe, and its origins is all about.|`|EQQFisd8aa	If we stop to think, then we shall die of boredom. So that is why sometimes we have to go the extra mile.  We are also all gifted differently.so if those who are gifted that way stop to do the Research, then we shall not balance.  This is to a certain extent inevitable, how?, it will give us the opportunity to Develop in one way or another.    Take for example, if man did not understand how the force of gravity worked, then we would not have flown to other countries nor have power that is produced by water to light at night.    I also do believe that all that man is doing is being directed by the supper natural power or God, only that some are misconceptions hence end up with negative impact, like bombs, nuclear weapons et.c.I do believe that, that is why supper natural power or God gave us brains higher than those of other mammals.    Thanks for asking dear|`|dTNKdXHNaa	"Those who control the past controls the future." -(I kinda forgot who said that)    but first, it is possible to understand the origin. this is the assumption of the topic. It is possible for humans to understand the origin. And the assumption has been proven true so far as we uncovered and pieced together stuff like dinosaurs that existed way before our time.     second, why. We attempt to understand the origin because it will help us shape our future.   1st) If there was really a God and he was the origin. and we found out one day that there really is a God and He was the one that created us. Then by understanding that, we will learn to trust the Bible and whatsnot and all go to heaven and not do bad things, which is a plus point for all mankind =)    2nd) If we followed Darwin's theory and ended up with evolution, then by understanding the whole concept of how the animals mutated into more intellegent beings(i.e. humans). Scientists, by understanding that origin will know what are the exact elements involved and how to create life on earth. They will also hold the knowledge of Mutation and by doing a manual add-on, all of humans can start having wings and fly just by an injection of a pill.Wouldn't that be another plus point?    Thus no matter what are the different theories human has come up with, we still try to understand those theories by constanting proving or disproving them so that we can find out the reason why we exist and what we can and were meant to do in the future.    "Those who control the past, controls the future" indeed.|`|fTarSlgraa	Scientists are driven to constantly improve our knowledge of our natural world both past and present. And with that knowledge we can make predictions for the future, test those predictions, if they are true the we can add that to our collective knowledge. The question of our origin is not the goal of our quest for knowledge but it is a byproduct.
EVIRRBxmaa	Depends.    After WW I peoples attitudes went different directions. For example, you have those who were distruaught with what man had done during the Great war and became existentialist. An example would be Hemingway's "Lost Generation" and T.S. Eliot's "The Wasteland". In France you had the surrealists such as Satre, Camus and Beauvoir.    At the same time, in the US, you had escapist and more optimistic writers like Zane Grey. You may also want to google the "Harlem Renaissance"  for more information.

draNVjbkaa	Casablancas, Barbizon, and JRP are all SCAMS!      Schools like John Casablancas, JRP, and Barbizon exist because there are a lot of suckers trying to get into acting and for the money. They think that going to one school will be the answer and it's not. It's these schools that give them and feed off of those false promises.    JRP-Banks on the name of a very famous and DEAD agent. They say that Lucille Ball, John Wayne, and many other famous actors went to the school, when NONE of them did! So you see, they use bait and switch tactics.    John Casablancas-The franchises have been known for unethical business practices and really have nothing to do with the founder's original intentions.    Barbizon-It was legit back in the 70s and 80s. Now these franchises have been known for unethical business practices and false promises.    These schools are OVERPRICED and DON'T provide the caliber training that more affordable schools like Howard Fine Studios, Beverly Hills Playhouse, Stella Adler, William Esper Studios, Tom Todoroff, Joanne Baron/D.W.

If you want serious training, the best thing you could do is find a good college with a theater program. If that's not feasible for you, look for a good community theater around you and see if they offer classes.

0c91b79437b0e602213a070c2fc739d0aa	Try seeing if there is a Jane's Book on line.  Jane's covers all sorts of weaponry.    Consider that in WW I, field artillery was pretty much a hit or miss situation and the explosives used were not very efficient/effective.  Today's arty is computerized and can drop a round within less than a meter of the intended target.  The computers can even triangulate from where enemy fire is coming and then allows for pin point accuracy.    Aircraft of WW I were generally of spruce wood and Irish linen with all sorts of drag wires that slowed the ship down even further.  Most engines were piston type and  the cylinders spun around the crankshaft.  With no valve covers, they flung oil everywhere.  Most did not have adjustable throttle controls and instead used a "blip switch" which cut the power to the spark plugs but did not shut off fuel flow to the cylinders.  With that set up, the unburnt fuel  was splashed against the fuselage making the aircraft a potential bomb.    Modern aircraft can fly three times the speed of sound and use laser guidance to place the ordinance within a couple of inches of the intended target.|`|olahi6esaa	Americans think they are awesome but get bogged down, while British troops quietly go about their jobs and defeat their enemy|`|3hLrUGcBaa	You need to remember differences AND similarities. The main reason for war is often the same - terrorism or fear of military progress i.e. Naval competition contributed to WW1 and the USA intervened in Iraq as they believed they had weapons of mass destruction. Theres alwasy a short-term 'spark' to set war off too, which is often on a similar basis. In WW1 it was the assassination of Franz Ferdinand, in WW2 it was Nazis marching into Poland, and with Afghanistan recently it was 9/11. Theres often a dictator involved too - in WW1 it was Tsar Nicholas II and the Kaiser, in WW2 there was Mussolini and Hitler, and recently wve had Saddam Hussein.    Hope this helps.

QlB3VXWraa	Go for it. J.K. Rowling gave it a go and it worked out pretty well for her.<br>  <br>  Incidentally, the story line you describe reminds me of a very good novel called "The Clan of the Cave Bear" by Jean Auel. It's about a little girl in prehistoric times who loses her tribe to an earthquake and gets adopted by a clan of Neandrathals. It's one of my all time favorite stories and I think you might like it too. It's the first book in a series and in a later episode she raised a wolf cub and when it grew up it saved her life.|`|DW7J8huQaa	If it is something you will enjoy doing, then you should write it!<br>  <br>  If you are asking if you should write it based on plot, I don't know.

Screaming, laughing, crying.  Learn ANYTHING +++, even juggling.  It is a long, hard, tough, and thankless job, with the most atrocious working hours, under the worst possible conditions.

It's only an issue if you totally want to erase dad from history and legally remove that name forever. But since both names appear, nothing says he has to use both.

I think that, if your macro are amazing and stunning... if people start wondering what it is and how you achieved it, then go for the macro!|`|UXQ22qeVaa	Because of the tech today I have seen people less exited about LEP because they just think "ho nice computer effect" they don't pay attention as much as before because they see a faked thing...

JjRhlOg5aa	Ahhhh.  The old "what is the meaning of life" question.  How long is a piece of string?  The answer differs. One person will say that we exist to reproduce. Another might say we exist to "serve god". I personally dont believe either of these, i think that we came into existence through pure evolution. We started out as fungi. We developed into more complex beings. Apes, cavemen.....the story of evolution, and now we are where we are today. To me, we exist to evolve. In a few million years people will be more complex and more powerful than we are now. We might have superbrains, or all be telepathic or even have telekinesis.

Judged by the sins and good we have done in our lives takes us to which one of the 7 heavens or hell.  God created us for a reason.  Everything happens for a reason.  I think you should research about Islam, it helps you understand the world.  And I do hope that one day you will be interested in Islam.  It's the most perfected religion, it protects you from all harm and wrong.  Good luck in your life.  xx

gW0nD5cEaa	The only times in history that many Jews have killed a lot of other people were wars in ancient times when they fought against neighboring tribes and since the founding of Israel when they are again at war with neighboring areas, like other Arab countries or the Palestinians who lived in Israel before it was a country.    Many 'Christians' especially in the past believed the old "Jews killed Jesus" thing. It is not accurate, some Jewish authorities in the Temple in Jerusalem conspired with some Roman authorities to have him crucified. All Jews at the time were not involved, a small number and that was 2000 years ago. But for centuries, many, including churches used that as an excuse for antisemitism, despite the fact Jesus himself was Jewish.     More Jews have been killed by Christians than the other way around.     I do not understand most antisemitism. Many people who are antisemitic can be irrational about it, just as some people who hate other groups have no real solid reason, it is just something they have heard or something they believe, but have nothing to back it up.     There are and have been down through history bad Jewish people, it is inevitable. There have been Jewish people for 5,000 years. There are bound to be some very bad, as well as very good people in that time, and a lot of ordinary people who are a little of both, like with any other group.|`|RAfiFIc0aa	I do not understand what you are trying to ask.

However, not all Jews are Israeli and not all Israelis are Jewish.|`|xfqHi1tRaa	First, your question really doesn't make much sense.  Are you referring to the nation of Israel? And the other middle eastern countries hating them?  Israel HAS been to war -- usually when its borders or people were threatened. They also tend to win. It is a very defensive country -- with good reason as the Jewish people have been persecuted for centuries. However, many Israelis are NOT "nicest, kindest" people either. They are very aggressive toward their neighbors and would prefer the "best defense is a great offense" type of life. So, Israel is not totally innocent either. Often it overreacts to various incidents.|`|AA11586960	the Israelis are the nicest kindest people in the world and only want to be left in peace to practice their own way of life without interference     the y are Tolerant people     but you keep killing their people then you fill them with a great resolve     and they WILL kick Butt    I am a Christian

0cf4Qja5aa	Earnest Flat the choreographer for Carol Brunette Show and the Broadway Musical "Sugar Babies" once told me that "it's in the gesture of the hands". Note: the rapper artists of today.    If you're interested in experiencing idleness thru a literary experienc reference Samuel Beckett's "Waiting for Godot"  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Waiting_for...    To represent idleness; make first hand observation of the elderly and study by reading some of the effects of arthritis suffering, dementia, palsies etc. etc.    The particular shaking of the hand while reaching out for a glass or while drinking from a glass is interesting, the head and eyes in observation of their own hands, studying their own hands while waiting for something waiting for someone could also be very effective.    warm thoughts.

Ow3O7h4caa	Hi GG    If it is a question of money or wanting to purchase the most for your money, get a Takamine. I know Gibson is good but Takamine make a fine instrument, good sound, very good action, nice finish and good re-sale value if you decide to sell it.  They are reliable, well set up and durable. Here is a link    http://www.takamine.com/?fa=series&sid=3...    You can also check Luna guitars. They are slightly smaller but the sound is pretty impressive. THis guitar is inexpensive, ladies love them, and they have a beautiful action and an original finish to match anybody's personality. Don't let it fool you, they look like toys but are definitely not and I can match them to guitar 3 times their price.    Good Luck..... Oh....forget Yamaha guitar but they do make a nice motorcycle.    http://www.lunaguitars.com/|`|ac0d4c45bf78507770b21657ff6f8f59aa	What are you asking--preferences for you or for others?    While your question is incomplete I'd prefer Gibsons over the other two choices.|`|AA11228933	All makes try to have a variety of neck widths. Gibson was known for a wide neck while Fender, Takamine,Yamaha and also had a narrow neck. The narrow neck is popular due to the demand by people with smaller hands.The wide neck can be useful however for those that want to avoid touching other strings while they depress the individual string. Those that want the beefier neck can condition their fingering to adjust to the spatial differences simply through spending the time getting used to it.

Jz15JG6baa	At the start of the book, Mrs Bennet wants Mr Bennet to become acquainted with the new tenant of Netherfield Hall (i.e Mr Bingley) because she thinks there is a strong possibility that he will marry one of their five daughters (oldest to youngest: Jane, Elizabeth, Mary, Kitty and Lydia).  She urges Mr Bennet to pay a call upon Mr Bingley, something that he is quite unwilling to do, but he does it eventually because she nags him, lol!  Hope this helps!  By the way, you should read it - it's a fantastic book once you get used to the language and the way it is written.  Good luck!|`|DvToP5h7aa	Mrs. Bennet's Timeline in the Story     ?

Read it or watch the 6 hour BBC special with Colin Firth and Jennifer something or other.
DvToP5h7aa	Mr. Bennet is sarcastic, witty, and insightful. The man is frequently a bemused spectator in the midst of unpleasant situations  namely, his marriage  but he always has some pithy comment or observation to voice. Elizabeth inherits both his sense of humor and his ability to make light of awful situations.    Fortunately, Elizabeth failed to inherit his less desirable qualities: poor judgment and laziness come to mind. We dont care how pretty Mrs. Bennet was, he should have noticed that she was a bad fit for him from the start. And seriously, not saving money for his daughters futures? Poor judgment call and laziness. Rather than take a proactive role in his family life, Mr. Bennet prefers to hide out in his library and dodge responsibility.    OK, pause. We have to try and make one last stand in defense of Mr. Bennet. The man actually really likes his family, as evinced by his desire to "have the family circle whole again." He also warns Elizabeth against marrying someone she doesnt care for or respect, and he really does make an effort to secure his daughters futures  remember, he was one of the first men to call on Mr. Bingley when the man arrived at Netherfield.    http://www.shmoop.com/character/literatu...

He moans about having to visit Mr Bingley and he makes jokes and comments about his wife's silly attitude but at the end of the day he does what she wants for a quiet life.  He loves his daughters (Lizzy is his favourite) but thinks the 3 youngest are very silly.  He sort of lets them all get away with anything, though, as long as it doesn't affect him.  Sadly, once Lydia runs away with Wickham, he realises that his daughters actions reflect on him badly and he resolves to be more of a disciplinarian with the younger, unmarried girls.|`|EH7G8voyaa	Quiet and reserved compared to his maniac wife and a few of his children.

Perhaps, if stronger rivets had been used, some of the plates would have held together??<br>  <br>  Titanic's rudder met the mandated dimensional requirements in place at the time, but the stern and the rudder were modeled off of another ship.  The rudder given to the ship was long and thin, which works well for cruising.  However, a short, square rudder works better for manuvering, which is what Titanic needed.  Also, the long, thin rudder worked fine on the other ship, but because Titanic was so much longer, the rudder was severly inadequate.  <br>  <br>  Another factor in the disaster was the speed at which Titanic was traveling.  Perhaps the rudder would have been adequate had the iceberg been spotted sooner, and there was more room between it and bow.  Perhaps if the ship had been moving at a slower speed, the turn could have been made?<br>  <br>  We'll never fully know...and parts of the disaster and the story will remain a mystery forever.|`|d89qNyb6aa	It hit an iceberg.<br>  <br>  On the night of Sunday, 14 April 1912, the temperature had dropped to near freezing and the ocean was calm. The moon was not visible and the sky was clear. Captain Smith, in response to iceberg warnings received via wireless over the preceding few days, altered the Titanic's course slightly to the south. That Sunday at 13:45,[a] a message from the steamer Amerika warned that large icebergs lay in the Titanic's path, but as Jack Phillips and Harold Bride, the Marconi wireless radio operators, were employed by Marconi [21] and paid to relay messages to and from the passengers,[22] they were not focused on relaying such "non-essential" ice messages to the bridge.[23] Later that evening, another report of numerous large icebergs, this time from the Mesaba, also failed to reach the bridge.<br>  <br>  At 23:40 while sailing about 400 miles south of the Grand Banks of Newfoundland, lookouts Fredrick Fleet and Reginald Lee spotted a large iceberg directly ahead of the ship. Fleet sounded the ship's bell three times and telephoned the bridge exclaiming, "Iceberg, right ahead!". First Officer Murdoch gave the order "hard-a-starboard", using the traditional tiller order for an abrupt turn to port (left), and the engines to be put in full reverse (although a survivor from the engine room testified that, as he recalled, the indicator of the telegraph had moved to "stop", and only after the impact).[24][25] A collision was inevitable and the iceberg brushed the ship's starboard side, buckling the hull in several places and popping out rivets below the waterline over a length of 299 ft (90 m). As seawater filled the forward compartments, the watertight doors shut. However, while the ship could stay afloat with four flooded compartments, five were filling with water. The five water-filled compartments weighed down the ship so that the tops of the forward watertight bulkheads fell below the ship's waterline, allowing water to pour into additional compartments. Captain Smith, alerted by the jolt of the impact, arrived on the bridge and ordered a full stop. Shortly after midnight on 15 April, following an inspection by the ship's officers and Thomas Andrews, the lifeboats were ordered to be readied and a distress call was sent out.<br>  <br>   <br>  Photograph of an iceberg in the vicinity of the RMS Titanic's sinking taken on 15 April 1912 by the chief steward of the liner Prinz Adelbert who stated the berg had red anti-fouling paint of the kind found on the hull from below Titanic's waterline.Wireless operators Jack Phillips and Harold Bride were busy sending out CQD, the international distress signal. Several ships responded, including Mount Temple, Frankfurt and Titanic's sister ship, Olympic, but none was close enough to make it in time.[26] The closest ship to respond was Cunard Line's Carpathia 58 mi (93 km) away, which could arrive in an estimated four hours—too late to rescue all of Titanic's passengers. The only land–based location that received the distress call from Titanic was a wireless station at Cape Race, Newfoundland.[26]<br>  <br>  From the bridge, the lights of a nearby ship could be seen off the port side. Not responding to wireless, Fourth Officer Boxhall and Quartermaster Rowe attempted signalling the ship with a Morse lamp and later with distress rockets, but the ship never appeared to respond.[27] The Californian, which was nearby and stopped for the night because of ice, also saw lights in the distance. The Californian's wireless was turned off, and the wireless operator had gone to bed for the night. Just before he went to bed at around 23:00 the Californian's radio operator attempted to warn the Titanic that there was ice ahead, but he was cut off by an exhausted Jack Phillips, who snapped, "Shut up, shut up, I am busy; I am working Cape Race".[28] When the Californian's officers first saw the ship, they tried signalling her with their Morse lamp, but also never appeared to receive a response. Later, they noticed the Titanic's distress signals over the lights and informed Captain Stanley Lord. Even though there was much discussion about the mysterious ship, which to the officers on duty appeared to be moving away, the Californian did not wake her wireless operator until morning.[27]<br>   <br>  Sinking of the Titanic by Henry Reuterdahl, drawn based on radio descriptions.The first lifeboat launched was Lifeboat 7 on the starboard side with 28 people on board out of a capacity of 65. It was lowered at around 00:40 as believed by the British Inquiry[29]. Lifeboat 5 was launched two to three minutes later. The Titanic carried 20 lifeboats with a total capacity of 1,178 persons.

It is clear that it did strike an iceburg, but the mechanism for the failure is now disputed somewhat.<br>  <br>  Apparently, the iceburg did not tear a gash in the structure, as is widely theorized.  Instead, it appears the seams under the water line buckled and separated due to the force of the impact and the inferior quality of rivets used in the ship's construction.  The ship quite literally came apart around the site of the impact.|`|AA10015648	Because it hit an iceberg, of course!

In that she had water tight compartments closed by water tight doors.  Very much as they are built today.<br>  Unfortunately the water tight integrity only went up to deck 5, 5 above the keel line.  When the ship struck the iceberg a 300ftgash was ripped in the side causing water to flood in.  The influx of water caused the ship to sink so that the incoming water flooded over the 5 deck water tight integrity.  This accelerated the problem and the rest is history.<br>  Rivets and plating is the way that ships were built in those days. Rather than welding 2 sheets of steel together they were drilled at close intervals and hot rivets inserted into the holes.  The rivets were them hammered shut forcing the two plates together.

William's father, Big Bill, remarries a grief counselor named Willow, and Will spends the following decades in love with Louisa (Lulu, as she prefers to be called), his new stepsister. They are close throughout adolescence, but after a summer at cheerleading camp, Lulu returns home distant and hostile, leaving Will to pine for her in solitary desperation. Will finally appears to be on the path to normalcy in the early 1990s when he lucks into a radio talk-show hosting gig, but the stroke of good fortune is short-lived, as he discovers things about Lulu he'd rather not know.

4cc767b496173b3227cf5f9f17efd2b5aa	Your question already contains the answer, but I'll respond anyway. Oftentimes, people use stereotypes as a way to put order to their world. It matters not that over time, some stereotypes evolve, but some show a remarkable resiliency to the tests of time.<br>  Given that humanity has this tendency, perhaps in the best case scenario, it offers up a lesson in the concept of healthy dialogue to promote a more dynamic perspective to counter static and vestigial beliefs.|`|6t76bgS3aa	I think there is some truth to them.

Dk8ro0a1aa	Julia this is beautiful and very thought provoking. I would like to add my advice to the wonderful advice already offered here. The soothing flow of your poem is somewhat disrupted in the line "The galaxy, of which are billions that are yet to be founded". Considered eliminating the words "that are", then reread it and see if expressed the same for you. I would love to see more of your pieces. Helpfully my suggestion has been as helpful as the others.<br>  <br>  TT|`|nE5eqyWeaa	I'm not sure all the comparisons you're doing actually lead anywhere, comparing and contrasting and then the quick question doesn't feel like enough.<br>  <br>  Explore it further and see what happens; perhaps start from the bottom up?|`|GExKoh1Gaa	your poem is imaginative and creative..therefore good in this respect but it needs some structure..<br>  but the last line is a bit too long,|`|XjYy1k5Xaa	It is repetitive.

Find a more descriptive word or delete it.<br>  <br>  "The earth, a planet in a galaxy"<br>  <br>  You repeat words and phrases but I see that it is for reason, stylish on your part.  (I get it)<br>  <br>  Last 3 lines you over use the words 'more' and 'much'.  Could you maybe rework that and let a "bomb explode inside your head" let a very creative descriptive word replace them.  (The quote is from another poet to me as advice on wordage)<br>  <br>  Your idea here is pure and simple yet beauty.<br>  <br>  Keep writing and sharing, that is how you will grow.  (Always save your original works when you re-write them!)<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.rhymezone.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.rhymezone.com</a> <br>  helpful website when you get stuck on a word or phrase!|`|02c048e10733ab7f5a7f2b2faf444d62aa	I see where you are going with this, and I have a couple of pointers.  You are trying to build from a scale on a fish to universes within universes...and that takes careful construction to work.  Make sure that you don't backtrack in your poem.  Go from the scale, to the fish, to the ocean, to the planet, to the solar system, to the galaxy, to the universe.  It will build in the reader's mind one on top of the other and create the grand scale that you seek.<br>  <br>  It is a good start, and sounds like it will be a lot of fun when its done.

You can also sell the boards on the internet,<br>  by h|`|8cf66894663c74e69b5ed17db7228d97aa	There are also many great acrylic paints out there that can be used on wood,glass and tile-they would work great. Or-check out the paint pens you can buy. Sharpies would work too-but would fade after a while-even with clear coat. Be sure to use a non yellowing clear coat-you could buy a spray-check out what Krylon has-they are a great company and you can find it in Home Depot, Lowes, Jo Anns Crafts etc.|`|PTdy6TWRaa	If you paint directly onto the boards then each one will be a one-of-a-kind creation. It will take quite a bit of time to produce each board that way. If that's the way you want to go then first sand the board to remove any glazing. This will help your paint adhere properly. Then paint your design using acrylic or enamel paint. When it's dry give it a clear coat.<br>  <br>  Rather than producing pieces this way one at a time I would suggest that you print your artwork on water-slide paper or on an adhesive paper and then apply the art to the board. In this way you can take the time to create a great piece of artwork and then use it on other boards as many times as you like. <br>  <br>  There are many specialty papers like this available for printing at home on an inkjet or laser printer. A friend of mine who designs and creates custom longboards and snowboards has used materials and methods like these to apply artwork to his boards. I have done the same but on furniture.<br>  <br>  If you use water-slide or an adhesive paper to apply your artwork to the board you will still need to spray over it with a clear coat to give it some added durability and waterproofing.
N86vHKxtaa	Organized crime.  To get, transport and sell alcohol required a sophisticated criminal network with the willing populace (buyers) turning a blind eye to the facts and to overpay to get it.  Much like the trade today in illegal drugs-- after all, if no one was willing to pay stupid money to buy them, no one would risk the consequences to sell them.  Prohibition helped establish "professional" criminals who have since moved on to other illegal activities.<br>  <br>  We still debate the control of alcohol consumption in the form of underage drinking, how late a bar can be open and on what days, who can sell what kind of alcohol, etc.  For example, it used to be the law that you could not sell/serve alcohol in the city of Philadelphia on Sunday so many new bars and restaurants were established on City Line Avenue just across the street from "Philadelphia" to circumvent the restriction.  In Virginia, the state maintains a monopoly on the sale of distilled spirits but even a grocery store can sell beer and wine.<br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|6K1D6Azmaa	Prohibition was about alcohol. The prohibition of anything else would need to be qualified so people understood it. <br>  <br>  If you want to talk about prohibition of other things, that would be a completely different subject requiring a lot more research.<br>  <br>  The biggest influence of Prohibition nowadays is the bizarre patchwork of liquor laws we have in different states. I don't think any other effect remains on society, except for the near-universal acceptance that prohibition of alcohol doesn't work. ?

ScaAyzKHaa	The Goths applied for foederati status because they were fleeing the Hunnic invasion. Foederati were colonies of non-Romans who were resettled within the Empire, and in exchange for the benefits of living in the Empire, worked and provided services for Rome (like military service, which they could use to get citizenship for themselves and their families). Rome agreed, and everything was good until Goths arrived, and it became clear the Romans didn't have a clue what they were doing. They were completely disorganized, didn't have enough supplies, and to top it all off, the men in charge of the humanitarian/resettlement efforts used the chaos to kidnap Gothic women and children for slavery, and withheld humanitarian supplies to create a black market for them (and remember, these supplies were supposed to be given to the Goths *for free*). <br>  <br>  After the awful river crossing, the Goths were kept in this condition for some time, because the corrupt Romans were keeping them from their resettlement land to draw out the supplies' black market even more. Finally they got everyone moving, but when they arrived at a Roman city, the gates were shut against them and the townspeople refused to sell them supplies. This was the last straw, and Goths rose up against the Romans, sacking Adrianople. They finally accepted peace with the Romans in 382 and settled down on their land. Years later, in the 390s, a Goth decided to follow the ancient Roman tradition of seizing power. Rome retaliated by massacring at least 30,000 Gothic civilians (families of soldiers, soldiers who had *not* been involved in the new uprising). This was the spark that drove Goths to Alaric (the Goth who had seized the throne), and led to the sack of Rome. <br>  <br>  There wasn't a German 'invasion;' they were invited in.|`|y9vqyqeNaa	Well the fall of the Roman Empire was actually a gradual process over two centuries. It started when Marcus Aurelius was emperor and a giant plague struck. <br>  <br>  Then came a series of very corrupt emperors. Commodus was so bad that the Roman Senate expunged any record of his existence upon his death. <br>  <br>  Septimius Severus and Caracalla maxed out the empire by fighting expensive wars throughout the empire.<br>  <br>  After Caracalla, there were 26 emperors over the next 50 years in the third century, only two of whom died of natural causes.<br>  <br>  Diocletian and Constantine gave the empire a reprieve, but after Constantine died, the empire continued to spiral down. It was finally sacked by the Visigoths in 410 AD.
SupWrLRIaa	Your teacher sucks . . . hard. I have to ask myself, when I read essay topic assignments like this, how people can claim that teachers deserve MORE pay. If they make more than minimum wage for this stuff there is a problem.<br>  <br>  Anyway, moving along . . .<br>  <br>  You could, perhaps, examine the philosophical origins of it. I don't know what level of school you are at, but if you have access to a good library you could probably find a decent amount of background on it. Where it came from I truly don't know, but that is the value of research.<br>  <br>  You could also examine different societies, take a broader viewpoint on it. Most of your classmates will probably choose something localized, like the sibling relationship, but to take two different peoples that are similar and break them down into component concepts would be really interesting, I think. <br>  <br>  It is usually a good idea to try and avoid what everyone else is writing. If your teacher reads yours 10th and it is the 8th about the same basic thing they are unlikely to look on it favorably unless it is much better than the first 7.

Iwk92vqyaa	I would say that would mostly depend on your target readers and what language you want the book printed in.<br>  To find out more about this, I strongly recommend you buy or study at a public library (ask the reference librarian) --where you can also copy for free any relevant pages-- (still, take notes)... the first section in the current edition of The Writer's Market: <br>  'How to Publish.' <br>  <br>  Once you know that section very thoroughly, then you'll know how to proceed. I also recommend you get an agent. To find reputable agents or publishers, once you've done the needed 'homework,' you'll also see several links in that book regarding who might be interested in what and just how to contact them.<br>  <br>  Be absolutely sure you follow all guidelines, tips and sources you'll find in The Writer's Market. If you like to do everything online, it's there too, but for a (relatively inexpensive) membership fee to see it all: a good source because it is constantly updated. <a href="http://www.writersmarket.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.writersmarket.com</a> Just take a look, first.<br>  <br>  Advise also against any vanity press, now called 'self-publication,' since many practitioners don't even deliver the little they have to offer, and you would have to have lots of time, money and connections to promote an unedited book yourself.<br>  <br>  Sounds like a good subject, to me. Very timely and of interest. <br>  Even if it's incomplete, you can read in the book mentioned about 'book proposals' and proceed that way. No copyright; it's already yours if you put your name and a date in every header and always keep a copy at home, even when/if asked for one. This holds true even as you work. [Copyright is what you later sell to editors and publishers, per agreement.]<br>  Best of luck in this interesting endeavor.|`|8iW1gpkNaa	I think whoever will actually publish the book would be the one to go with.

HkXYGAOdaa	The one thing I am critical of the medieval times is European expansions overseas to gain power and to built empires.  Civilized, lawful men, illegally invading sovereign nations.  That's why it's "medieval"|`|4qT0TfMZaa	Glad I didn't live then...too much disease and far too much social instability back then!|`|NYU37jfGaa	I don't think 'dark' is correct at all, and in any case I think it was only ever used to describe the early medieval period (the first few hundred years after the fall of the roman empire).  Most people nowadays seem to refer to this as the early medieval period.<br>  <br>  I think like all eras in history there were good and bad things, but the middle ages produced some wonderful things.  Fantastic architecture for instance, the fabulous cathedrals and castles that still amaze wherever you go in Europe.  Wonderful music, that is still being played in our churches today.  Some marvellous works of literature like Chaucher's Canterbury Tales and Boccacchio's Decameron.  Some wonderful art too, like the fantastic illuminated manuscripts that have survived.  The medieval mystery plays, which still have the power to charm when you see them performed today.<br>  <br>  There were bad things in medieval times, wars, a harsh penal code, a very un-equal society with the ruling class holding most of the power.  But all of those things are true of most eras of history, none of them are unique to the middle ages.  and in fact the lower classes, the peasants, seem to have actually been rather better off in medieval times under the manorial system, than they became later, when enclosures of land made many of them homeless and jobless.<br>  <br>  For a really interesting look at medieval life, I recommned Frances and Joseph Gies's books, which are really good.|`|12VQ4ETcaa	The Dark Ages happened before the medieval period, also known as the Middle Ages.<br>  <br>  The Middle Ages were a time when Europe opened to exploration of other parts of the world, increased education, and a blossoming of art and culture.

Plus, the intonation goes out if you change your tuning.|`|W1h3w5gdaa	Yes, tune the 6th (E) string to the 4th (D) string. It's one octave lower, but you should be able to hear it.<br>  <br>  As far as tuning down, assuming you mean a 1/2 step rather than a full step, you can tune the 6th string to the 5th string fretted at fret 6, which will give you E-flat.  Then, tune the rest of the guitar to the 6th string.<br>  <br>  Be forewarned that re-tuning all your strings will alter your neck tension, as was mentioned. What wasn't really explained is that, by the time you've tuned string 1, strings 6 - 2 will have gone sharp on you because of reduced tension on the neck.<br>  <br>  So, it can be done, but it's pain in the rear. Tuners are definitely the way to go.|`|b0a427e82d04cfce8eff5752cd2f985daa	For drop D tuning, I tune the 6th string against the 4th, it's one or two octaves lower.

Print is less distinctive than cursive, for reasons not fully understood, and is therefore declined for most important things (opening bank accounts, taking out loans, etc.). <br>  <br>  I personally use cursive for everything unless forced to do otherwise because it is much faster for me.

But i would think so if her brothers are named that!|`|ZUlnZvaWaa	Of course! You didn't think that was maybe the one tidbit of originality she used when she wrote the book, did you? You can't expect much from a "romance" novel written for low teens, she must be intentionally trying to dumb it down from what I can tell. Oh, and making the biggest prick the one the dumb girl goes for? Well, at least that is like real life.|`|BzMQejGxaa	It's really weird, considering she's writing and thinking as Bella whose love interest is named after and based on her real life brother?    Creepy much? That's such a childish thing to do- I did that when I was about 8.|`|GFzDwIk6aa	Yes, she did name them after her brothers because they helped her in writing the series.  There aren't any other Twilight characters named after people she knows, but the name Isabella was the name Stephenie was saving for her daughter. She figured she was never going to have a daughter, so she used it for the character.
XqrjFYgIaa	I'm not sure if you are, but it sounds like you might be. As for myself, I'm pretty sure I am. I find myself trying to live up to the hero-thinker myth that was created by such greats as Nietzsche. Sadly and interestingly, it's gotten me into trouble lately in my relationships, especially because friends and my partner are complaining that I'm living among the clouds (of ideas), instead of being grounded. It's kind of jolted me to examine the reasons why I'm drawn toward abstract thinking; what am I getting out of it? Am I using it as a defense mechanism to feel profound and important, unique and independent? Am I hiding behind the genius of others because I can't stand on the genius of myself? The criticisms of others are making me doubt myself..whatever I am, I just want to be authentic to it.<br>  <br>  So if your being reflective of life is genuine and you're not using it as a crutch to escape some harsh self- and world-truths, then I think you will ultimately be ok. You've got to get lost to get to where you're going!|`|G7LUOfIkaa	It's just who you are.

Or the fact that both succeeded?|`|c12ff2f01aee1d7228df9c10d0d77908aa	As stated, the common factor is Communism.  Both countries, at this period of time, would have been unable to resist the American army, if it were not for the aid of the Soviet Union, or at least Communist Russia (Cuba) and Communist China (Vietnam).  <br>  <br>  America was not willing to go to war with Russia or China.  However, its policy at the time was to stop the spread of world Communism.  America and the Soviet Union therefore invested advisors, arms and money into countries that were sympathetic to their cause.  America did the same for the local resistance fighters in Afghanistan in order to undermine Soviet occupation.<br>  <br>  With Vietnam, America proped up the ailing democratic government, even though the leader was viewed as corupt and disliked by the populous.<br>  <br>  Both communist leaders did not want war with America.  If anything, they wanted to foster peacfull relations.  Ho Chi Minh was originally an American trained and armed resistance fighter during WWII.  US officers were present at his inorgaration, where they star spangled banner was played in the background.  Uncle Ho was very keen to foster a strong relationship with the US.  Unfortunately, the US foreign policy towards communist countries shut the door on this.<br>  <br>  Fidel Castro simply wanted indipendance from unfair trading policies imposed upon his country by America.  Originally, communism was not his aim.  However, finding his revolution facing pressure from America, he found that he was virtually pushed into closer ties and the military aid that he needed, with the Soviet Union.<br>  <br>  So the common factors are:<br>  <br>  Disasterous American foreign policy.<br>  <br>  Military and financial backing from the Soviet Union/China.<br>  <br>  Luck|`|AA11705909	There was nothing going on in Cuba, Fidel was in charge and the country was at peace.

A wonderful quote by Abbe Huvelin says, "Without the experience of suffering a man’s nature remains shallow.

HkXYGAOdaa	Having conquered most of the world does not make a god.|`|AA10729675	As usual, the Romans borrowed deification of a prince or of an emperor from the Greeks. Those Greeks had been almost forced to do that: 1- in Egypt because the Pharaohs did that, 2- in Persia, because it was by then a trend, 3- all over the Hellenistic Macedonian territories from a peer-pressure phenomenon.  The Romans did not have to believe he was a god, and even when he was deified after his death, they still did not have to believe it, just pretend they did. I do not know if Augustus declared himself to be a god.  I do not think so.  He was the "father of the land", "the Pontifex Maximus" (= the Highest Priest, not unlike the Pope).  But he never said he was a god, and never said he was an emperor.  In fact, he chose carefully the term "princeps" because it only means "the first Head", so he was at the head of the country.  Nonetheless, whether they believed he was a god or not, they had to worship him.|`|8e9a28782c8446395b12f275754b4b76aa	Augustus was not considered a god until after his death. It was an Egyptian custom to deify their pharaohs, but the concept was alien to Romans. Therefore, emperors and other important figures were not considered gods in life, only in death. This started to change during the later empire, with people declaring themselves gods left and right. A few emperors did so earlier (Caligula, Nero, perhaps Domitian), but they were generally hated for it and assassinated in short order.

tyjY3usaaa	The main characters are the Bennet clan i.e: Mr and Mrs Bennet and their 5 daughters: Lizzie, Jane, Kitty, Lydia and Mary. Also the social superior to these characters are the new arrivals to the neighbourhood, Mr Bingley, his two snobby sisters and his friend the one and only MR DARCY!   The story is a classic tale of love, social class and a few good misunderstandings. Basically, boy meets girl, the two personalities clash, each have prejudices against one another but throughout the course of the story they each come to realise how wrong they have been and in a totally gripping finish they finally come together in what has got to be one of the best books ever written...|`|mBW9W1Tyaa	mr darcy  the bennett family:  elizabeth  jane  mum  dad  and some more i think|`|m3rt9x8Caa	The story is about love basically about Mr Darcy who falls in love with Elizabeth (Lizzy)    Characters are -    Elizabeth Bennet  Fitzwilliam Darcy  Mr Bennet  Mrs Bennet  Jane Bennet  Mary Bennet  Lydia Bennet  Catherine (Kitty) Bennet  Mr Gardiner (Mrs Bennet's brother)  Mrs Gardiner  Charles Bingley  Caroline Bingley  George Wickham (married Lydia)  William Collins (Mr Bennet's cousin)  Charlotte Lucas (neighbour of the Bennet's)  Lady Catherine De Bourgh (Darcy's widowed aunt)|`|5b478a242969ee67691fa226064cfcd6aa	The story is based on the Bennet family and their attempts to marry their daughters off to rich nobles. The two elders daughters Jane and Lizzy both meet with rich men (Mr Bingley and Mr Darcy) with whom they both (eventually) fall in love. On the way though, the prejudices of the men's families as well as the men's own pride interferes with the relationships and lead them to initally reject the girls. There are also other factors (such as a certain relation of Mr Bennet's and one of their younger sisters) which cause problems for them.    This is a very readable and quite a comical story. The best way to learn the full story is to read it for yourself. There are all sorts of twists and turns to the story.    The BBC have done a brilliant version of this on video and DVD. If you really can't stand reading the book, the original adaptation is the best one to watch.|`|tLpppqJuaa	Do your own homework.

YA36FUf1aa	Yes, you're spot on. I was just discussing this yesterday, funily enough, and my conclusion was that countries like America will always remain the wealthiest and most powerful ones because they have a habit of ensuring that the poorer countries which essentially prop up the walls of capitalism stay loyal to them. This means that the USA (and also UK, France etc and increasingly China, especially in Africa) threaten countries and bully them into installing puppet regimes which will not upset the current equilibrium. This ensures that the traditonally wealthy countries will maintain their position but sadly, it also holds back any development in countries which have incredible potential.<br>  <br>  Ironically, the USA itself would not have become wealthy if it had allowed Britain to continue with this kind of intimidation centuries ago. It's massive hypocrisy for America to behave like this, although it is wrong for any country.|`|gd0oBfOhaa	No duh it's imperialism, all the major countries own their own "empires".

North Korea wouldn't fall into this category since they are far too easily swayed by the Chinese.  Another Rogue state would be Pakistan.|`|zLqAIKWiaa	Imperialism is a direct result from the military industrial complex. There are many reasons for this and one of the main is that since the MI complex has grown so large and employs so many people they can direct U.S policies out of fear of losing all the jobs and GDP the MI complex creates. Now we have a problem of what to do with all these weapons that are only getting stored in warehouses. Well usually we decide to use them for any number of illegitimate reasons. Thats why the US has been at constant war since WWII.|`|AA11304025	certainly, it is a form of commercial imperialism.

That is WAY to simplistic an answer.  3rd World countries have many individual problems that interfere with their development.  They often poor, small, with few resources, little education, with unstable political situations, civil strife (even if not violent, they may have automatic disagreements between tribes, say).<br>    The USA pours millions and millions of millions of dollars into 3rd world countries each year for assistance programs.

After watching the movie and going home, Kyle begins to feel and see killer ants everywhere. While in bed, killer ants crawl to him. Scared and shaky, the Frightmaster is in Kyle's head and says, "They're just figments of your imagination, like me. But, then, you always did have too much imagination."<br>  <br>  "Smoke<br>  Katie's parents died in a house that was on fire. She wakes up in her grandparents home. She never met her Grandfather, and she only met her Grandmother when she was 6. Her memory is blurry. She asks her grandparents if she can go back to the house and find their ghosts, to say she loved them since the last thing she said to them was that she hated them, because they wouldn't let her spend the night at a friend's house. Her grandparents refuse. Katie then sneaks out of the house and goes to her old house. There is a heavy scent of burnt roses. She finds her parents' ghosts and tells them she loves them. They spend a sad and touching moment. Her grandparents arrive, revealing they too are ghosts and so is Katie. Her memory becomes clear and remembers that her grandfather died before she was born, and her grandmother died when she was 6."<br>  <br>  "The Caller<br>  A girl name Lindsay has a beautiful ring given from her Aunt Margaret, who died. Lindsay had pretended to like her Aunt because she only wanted her ring. When Lindsay gets a call from an unknown caller, who says it's her Aunt Margaret, Lindsay tells the caller she never liked her, she just wanted her ring, then hangs up. While Lindsay's at her friend's house, Missy, she gets another call from her Aunt Margaret who says she's coming back to get her ring. When Lindsay hears footsteps behind a door, she thinks it's Margaret. While the door is still closed, Missy says she's on the other side, laughing at Lindsay. Mad at Missy, Lindsay opens the door, but it's revealed that Margaret is standing outside the door."<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Dare-Scared-Thirteen-Stories-Thrill/dp/0812626885/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&s=books&qid=1235150374&sr=1-1" rel="nofollow">http://www.amazon.com/Dare-Scared-Thirte...</a><br>  [$14 at Amazon]|`|79YQAbSRaa	I think it's Dare to be Scared by Robert san Souci
TAIlyvgyaa	It's in my nature to be the 'shout and thereby hasten the end' type, but that doesn't necessarily make it better.<br>  <br>  Good question.|`|FHdF0ZJLaa	I know nothing about the book so I'm not sure if it's talking about actual death or metaphorical.<br>  <br>  If actual death then I'd say hope springs eternal - if I can draw something out longer with the possibility of having it *not* end in death, then I'd do so. Once one is dead there is no hope of anything further, but while life exists one can hope for a better ending than death in a certain situation.|`|kF4M4asnaa	If death was inevitable, I'd rather shout and go out quickly, with a bang.<br>  <br>  If death wasn't inevitable, I'd do whatever it takes to buy myself more time.
WbRuTjmFaa	I dunno.. <br>  I like it..<br>  The sentiment is easily read<br>  You can take a piece and rework it forever <br>  and it may never be finished, but this one I think is your best.|`|S9bEtVCSaa	I like the message, but I'm not feelin the flow.<br>  Maybe less "I." <br>  Hmmm - not sure.|`|nE5eqyWeaa	Love poem:<br>  <br>  Gold  by Donald Hall  <br>   <br>  Pale gold of the walls, gold<br>  of the centers of daisies, yellow roses<br>  pressing from a clear bowl. All day<br>  we lay on the bed, my hand<br>  stroking the deep<br>  gold of your thighs and your back.<br>  We slept and woke<br>  entering the golden room together,<br>  lay down in it breathing <br>  quickly, then<br>  slowly again,<br>  caressing and dozing, your hand sleepily<br>  touching my hair now.<br>  <br>  We made in those days<br>  tiny identical rooms inside our bodies<br>  which the men who uncover our graves <br>  will find in a thousand years,<br>  shining and whole. <br>  <br>  Do you see how Mr. Hall uses the very specific to add imagery and tension? Try it, show us deep longing/perfect essence. Use language in ways that haven't been used before. This makes poetry.|`|bfP8tjPKaa	whoa, thats deep.<br>  I am a journalist, and I really like this poem, great word choice, you put feeling into your work, I like it!!!! =)|`|SlWf8lmQaa	Good but somewhere the flow is missing|`|0jlG2clBaa	Its nice..not bad<br>  but an experienced writer like you shudn't write like this|`|6UKichdAaa	where's the emotion!? I like to write poetry but I'm not deep so I write silly sort of. However my friend wrote an amazing piece of poetry that gave me a wierd lonesome sleepy type feeling. I wish this poem actually touched my heart. Seems like a poem that would have no effect even if read in a quiet dark room|`|ZHrR3BQKaa	Like two lovers being separated.
xv0ovZ63aa	Meaningful and expressive! It was a terrific poem expressing the beauty of living life with all you've got. It's optimistic although most people would think it's sad because it deals with death. I actually think it is quite a hopeful message.<br>  <br>  Keep writing! =)|`|WbRuTjmFaa	I like <br>  It has a musical quality.<br>  it works.|`|yJCLcFVwaa	This is a very good poem.|`|t6N64bBYaa	"than going down standing tall" idk it just doesn't really flow neither does the other than part. <br>  <br>  try the word "rather" instead of than for than resiginging to your fate<br>  it's coming along quite nicely otherwise|`|9Zjk9dRqaa	yea one has to fight till the very end ones there you can rest but you'll be more happy in the after life.|`|41519dcd613e198147ae134a0f6e6e78aa	Very good Sunny,  Keep it up,|`|PsloJxSeaa	i like the poem a lot|`|h1Abd6plaa	I think the poem is great..

The "Malthusian Point" (described and named after Thomas Malthus) is reached in a society when the number of people who have to be fed exceeds the resources needed to feed them.  The result can be: 1) uprisings of the have-nots against the haves; 2) forced emigration (making people leave);  3) killing despised minorities; 4) starvation and death; etc.

8MaRk2AZaa	hey yeah I used to like the same books as you, I especially loved redwall and Eragon too! Anyway I'd say you'd like the Sabriel series By Garth Nix, they're really good and I got into them after I was reading a lot of Redwall and Eragon and they're good for the plane because you can get into them pretty easily and you wont put it down. They're really enjoyable.<br>  <br>  You also said that you like Historical Fiction and I wouldn't say that I read a lot of it, but a really great series are the Emperor series by conn iggulden, the first one is "The Gates Of Rome" and they're about Caesar and they're pretty good historically (got me through my latin history exams last summer and I got an A while i was at it lol) but they're as enjoyable as a fantasy book, and contain as much adventure and stuff but its real! So i would really recommend them! He's writing a series about Ghengis Khan at the moment if that would interest you more anyway!|`|XZBJNwi1aa	Try the Deptford Mice Trilogy by Robin Jarvis<br>  <a href="http://www.robinjarvis.com/deptfordhome.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.robinjarvis.com/deptfordhome....</a><br>  <br>  Anything by Tamora Pierce and the Studies Series by Maria V.

I never really knew so much about dragons before reading that fantastic book by Donn Kushner, and wish everyone who likes dragons could read it.<br>  <br>  For fantasy without dragons, but with just about everything else, you may want a long and extremely interesting book by Susanna Clarke "Jonathan Strange and Mr Norrell." <br>  She is said, by the time she wrote her second book "The Ladies of Grace Adieu and Other Stories"...<br>  ...as a writer who not only won both a Hugo and Best Fantasy for her first novel (the long one, also short-listed for the Man Booker Prize and more)...<br>   <br>  ..."to show influence from Jane Austen, Bram Stoker and Sir Arthur Conan Doyle." <br>  Quite an interesting mix, and it shows, even in the no-period after "Mr" in the title above. <br>  Fantastic fantasy.

yUudoO1Raa	There are two kinds of fear: fear of having to feel physical pain, as when you are in the hands of a torturer. I don't anyone who could not fear that, or the fear of being beheaded by an Islamofascist.<br>  <br>  The other kind of fear is the one we have when we are not spiritually healthy. I don't mean religiously--I'm an atheist.<br>  <br>  But if you are familiar with Atlas Shrugged, there is that scene near the end where Galt is lying on the torture table, in excruciating pain from the machine--when it suddenly breaks and he is free of it.<br>  <br>  What does he do then? He tells his captors how to fix the machine, because he has no fear of what their machine can do to his spirit, to his principles, to his integrity. <br>  <br>  His very point in helping his captors was to show them they do whatever they wanted and he was not afraid to see it through to the end.|`|hOmSKJtdaa	Define superhuman.<br>  Super usually means "above" or "better", so would being perfect make you above or better than someone else?

Kind of like Dr. Spock in the original Star Trek television series of the 60s.  <br>  <br>  I agree with Gene Roddenberry in that sense that to be have no emotion at all both in personal feeling and with others is to not be a human being at all.

Fear is not a universal character trait.  Some fear is instinct, and some is learned behavior, but there are extremes on both ends of the spectrum with both kinds of fear.  By the same token that there are people who fear too much, there are people who have lost their natural instinct to be afraid.<br>  <br>  In both cases, these are people who need help.|`|DZO82OC9aa	ok,<br>      If people think that they have no fears, they will be fine,then enjoy drinking or eating with friends and friends. <br>      But, Natural Disasters?- GREAT HARM people will get BIG FEAR VERY STRONG FEAR. <br>      Do you know what I mean?

oAkhoCQ6aa	Philosophy has had a long history of being hijacked by people who either don't understand what they are talking about or are trying to introduce their psuedoscience into the study of reality.Often when I walk into a used book store I see the philosophy section crammed with new age books by well-intended but otherwise mis-informed book sellers who really ought to know better. <br>  <br>  Metaphysics originated with Aristotle when he wrote a book called Physics. Aristotle was terribly concerned with the natural world and sometimes is called the first scientist due to his preoccupation with it. Later he wrote a book that dealt with more eternal concepts rather than the state of nature. He had trouble titling it, so his copier suggested Meta (after)-physics. Philosophers have been stuck with this misnomer ever-after.<br>  Metaphysics is a sub-discipline in the study of philosophy along with Epistimology (How can we know?), Ethics (What is morality?) and Political philosophy. Metaphysics is indeed the study of What is Real, or the nature of reality. A question like "What is Time or the True nature of Time?" is a good example of a metaphysical question. How can we really know what time it is, is an example of an epistimological question. <br>  So to answer your question, New age is expressly NOT philosophy. It is more akin to religion, in that it require belief and faith for its tenets. In other words, "I believe if I stick this crystal up my **** it will cure my constipation." Philosophy does not hinge on belief or faith but on logic, reason, proofs of arguments, and evidence from the natural world if needed. Philsophy goes hand in hand often with science. And like science, philosophy is often at odds, even an anathama to, religion - and since new age is closer to religion, that puts philosophy at odds with it. <br>  Philosopy, and thus metaphysics, is a stance, a constant vigilant search for truth and for answers to the meaning of life. New age, by contrast, is already an answer, not a search for them. It doesn't present theories, proofs, or logic. Those are the tenets of philosophy, and new age need not apply.|`|8395f464f951baf847594ae5b8585b9aaa	I teach Metaphysics so I have a great understanding. New Age thinking has hijacked the Metaphysical world. THEY ARE NOT OF TRUE METAPHYSICS. Metaphysics is a latin word and means "meta- mind and physics - science. It is the science of the mind. It is how & why we think. It is the tools we can use to gain control of our lives and not let our lives control us.|`|Rt4bJfVAaa	Yes I was confused with this concept as well.  It did not surprise me that the New Age has hijacked such a field.  Added this to my folder as well thanks to the answers you received.   <br>  <br>  Later|`|FmbwIbtzaa	I think if we are looking for beginnings it could be found that  the Hindus had a religion of metaphysics. It could be that metaphysics is the real introduction to the intelligent comprehension of cosmic meanings and universe interrelationships, cosmic reality.<br>  <br>  While the highest phase of Brahmanism was hardly a religion, it was truly one of the most noble reaches of the mortal mind into the domains of philosophy and metaphysics. Having started out to discover final reality, the Indian mind did not stop until it had speculated about almost every phase of theology excepting the essential dual concept of religion: the existence of the Universal Father of all universe creatures and the fact of the ascending experience in the universe of these very creatures as they seek to attain the eternal Father, who has commanded them to be perfect, even as he is perfect. Page 1030-1<br>  <br>  The Greeks sought for the solace of the soul in deep thinking--philosophy and metaphysics. They turned from the contemplation of self-preservation--salvation--to self-realization and self-understanding.<br>  <br>  Science ends its reason-search in the hypothesis of a First Cause. Religion does not stop in its flight of faith until it is sure of a God of salvation. The discriminating study of science logically suggests the reality and existence of an Absolute. Religion believes unreservedly in the existence and reality of a God who fosters personality survival. What metaphysics fails utterly in doing, and what even philosophy fails partially in doing, revelation does; that is, affirms that this First Cause of science and religion's God of salvation are one and the same Deity. Page 1106-6|`|AA11564934	It sounds to me like you want Ontology.<br>  <br>  yes, metaphysics has been taken over by new-age wackiness.  They are bascially synonymous.|`|HORACAnlaa	Real metaphysics has nothing what-so-ever to do with New Age nonsensical ramblings of the great unwashed masses. The vulgar masses of New Age movement basically used the word metaphysics as a substitute for supernatural. Real metaphysics really begins with Plato, who never used the word, and fully become a subject of Philosophy after Aristotle (who has one work titled "Metaphysics" but I don't think he actually used the word -- his works, basically his notes to lectures, were titled after his death). Meta means after, hence metaphysics means after physics. It's after physics because it's those principles of existence that are implied in the study of physics; in other words, it concerns existence itself not existents of existence.

She was named Miracle because rumor was to believe that she was born from her mother, who was hit by an ambulance, and gave birth from a dead body. Her grandmother, Gigi, a psychic, taught her to believe in auras and mystical spirits. Then, out of nowhere, her father suddenly disappeared, or shall I say, "melted." <br>  Miracle and Gigi moved to her Granddaddy Opal house because they weren't accepted among people. They thought they would melt if they trusted them. <br>  Miracle then starts to find out what had happened to her father. She tries to figure out the pieces of information of what had happened. She once "burned" herself trying to figure it out. She landed in the hospital where a doctor tried to force her to learn more about the truth about her self.

Being the single parent of a four year old girl has given him a reason to recover and paramedic school has given him the means.

When Rob realizes that a traffic accident victim was actually murdered he enlists the help of Deputy Coroner Anna Drake. As the two investigate they discover that the crime of the city has its roots in the beautiful mountains. They become targets and race to stop the killer before more of their informants, or they and their families die.

KADDz1EPaa	Sir Samuel White Baker (1821-1893) was an English explorer, author, and administrator who explored the Upper Nile and discovered Lake Albert. He also sought to suppress the slave trade in the southern Sudan. <br>  <br>  <br>  Samuel Baker was born in London on June 8, 1821. He was a large man with prodigious energy and great bravery and determination. A firm believer in the economic potential of the tropics, he went to manage his family's plantations in Mauritius in 1844 and later established his own estates in Ceylon. The plantations in Ceylon prospered, and he returned to England with his family. After his first wife, Henrietta, died in 1855, Baker traveled in the Crimea, Asia Minor, and the Balkans. In 1860 he married Florence Ninian von Sass, a young and beautiful Hungarian, and the following year he arrived in Cairo determined to seek the source of the River Nile. <br>  <br>  Traveling up the Nile to Berber, Baker spent a year wandering along the Atbara River and the Blue Nile, hunting and learning Arabic before returning to Khartoum, from which he and his wife launched an expedition up the White Nile in December 1862. Arriving at Gondokoro, the Bakers met the British explorers John Hanning Speke and James Augustus Grant, who had reached Lake Victoria and the Nile from the East African coast. In 1863-1864 Baker and his wife discovered and explored the eastern shore of Lake Albert, visited Kamrasi, the ruler of Bunyoro, and after many delays returned to London, where Baker wrote an extremely popular book about his explorations and the horrors of the Sudanese slave trade. <br>  <br>  In the spring of 1869 Baker was approached by Ismail, the khedive of Egypt, to lead an Egyptian expedition to the Upper Nile to extend Egyptian control to Lake Victoria, to claim the territory for Egypt, and to end the slave trade. Baker was consequently appointed governor general of Equatoria Province and sailed up the Nile with a large expedition of 1200 troops, the most expensive expedition to penetrate Africa. <br>  <br>  Baker had agreed to serve for 4 years. Unfortunately, the first year was wasted breaking through the great swamps of the Nile, whose sudd formations provide an almost impenetrable barrier to navigation. Baker reached Gondokoro in 1870 and spent the second year organizing his men and establishing stations in Equatoria. <br>  <br>  Frustrated at every turn, he began to employ increasing force to pacify the people and acquire supplies for his troops and followers. Although these raids alienated important tribes, Baker continued to push south into Bunyoro in 1872, where he was again forced to fight, this time against Kabarega, who had succeeded Kamrasi as ruler. Like most African leaders who had to deal with Baker and his forces, Kabarega refused to trust the intruders, and Baker possessed neither the tact nor the tolerance to allay his fears. <br>  <br>  Nevertheless, when Baker retired to England and fame and fortune in 1873, he had struck the first blow against the Nilotic slave trade and had laid the foundations for colonial rule in the southern Sudan. He died in Devonshire on Dec. 30, 1893. <br>  by italian

The next line ends with "Hill" just like the second line (B). So, up to this point, the rhyme scheme is ABCB.  You just keep going like that until you're done with all the lines. <br>  <br>  Yes, it does count as a rhyme if it's the same word.|`|yyIVrngcaa	it's obvious...the pattern is the end word of every two sentences ryhme..<br>  ex. hill, hill, sand, hand, face, face, shade, said, cries, cries<br>  <br>  you get the point|`|5ZwuIVPdaa	do ur own homework!!!!|`|qwvijKexaa	idk|`|pJZz5HVIaa	The poet is using a rhyme scheme ababcdcd ... but is substituting other echoes for the rhyme, including repeated words, assonance (repeated vowels), consonance (repeated consonants) and near rhymes. This sort of subtitution is common in modern poetry.<br>  <br>  Serena is correct, but in poetry writing circles repeat words (or lines) are often written as upper case letters, and rhymes in lower case, so the first eight tlines would read:<br>  <br>  aBaBcded<br>  <br>  Was there ever message sweeter <br>  Than that one from Malvern Hill,<br>  From a grim old fellow,-you remember?<br>  Dying in the dark at Malvern Hill. <br>  With his rough face turned a little, <br>  On, a heap of scarlet sand,<br>  They found him, just within the thicket,<br>  With a picture in his hand ...<br>  <br>  I don't think there is a standard method of marking echoes other than rhyme and repeated words.

Economic issues.  The South allowed slavery.  When new states joined the union, the North wanted them to be free and the South wanted them to allow slavery.  The North felt that slave labor led to unfair economic competition.  Also, the North was industrial and the South was agricultural.<br>  <br>  2. Political issues.  The South was in favor of states' rights and the North wanted a stronger federal government.  Southern states did not feel the federal government had the right to force them to end slavery, but they were also concerned about the idea in principle.<br>  <br>  I support the North.
R5UIMBvcaa	I think he's quietly skeptical.  The fact that he refers to the mother and son as "old-believers" suggests that he doesn't share their beliefs, that maybe he considers them superstitious.   It also says something about him (reinforces the image of him as skeptical, or maybe just unimaginative) that he's still willing to spend a night in their house after hearing the story of the bones.  The last two lines suggest that all he believed of the story was the husband's name.  After all, the preceding two lines show that the woman was unable to produce any evidence of human bones in the house.   So it seems that the speaker went away with simply a good story to tell to his friends, maybe wondering what had put it into his hostess's head.  <br>  <br>  (And then one day maybe someone hearing it said, "Toffile Lajway? Ayuh, he used to live over toward _____.  And there WAS a fellow over that way that used to whistle 'The Minstrel Boy" as he walked long the road, but no one rightly knows what became of him.")
sc4BtGxGaa	If judging by the people I j have had to deal with at some stores, the ability to run the cash register and sneer at people is all that is needed.  No musical knowledge whatsoever!  I can remember going into music stores in Boston, and having people with a life-long passion that amounted to a graduate degree in music, who knew EVERYTHING I could possibly ask for - and were instructive and pleasant.  <br>  <br>  Owners now are lucky to get someone who shows up sober, does not steal, and does not QUIT.  Actually knowing something about music?  Seldom considered.  They will want to pay you minimum wage, NOT hire you full-time ( no benefits to pay, that way) and generally NOT appreciate you. I speak from family experience - many people treat their employees like expendable bodies, and then wonder why their business suffers.  If you can find a nice FAMILY owned business - perhaps you will fare better.<br>  <br>  You probably are a wonderful young person, and would be an ASSET to any business - but I wonder if they will really appreciate you.

Do you mean Greek sports in Ancient Greece?<br>  <br>  The other sports like running and javelin throwing etc. were taking place only during the big games (Olympic, Delphic, later on Ptolemeia, etc.)  Wrestling could be done any time anywhere.  The Greeks added to it other skills and sports and called it pancration.  so, you had the Palli or just wrestling, the Pygmachia (boxing) and the Pancration = Boxing and wrestling.  And they exported it to China! Yes!  Alexander had conquered Bactria and Sogdiana (now Afghanistan and Chinese Turkmenistan) and from there, they taught it to the merchants and it went to China.  But they also had internal esorteric gymnic exercises that they called esoteriki gymnastiki which we find in some Chinese movements.  You had the Kourkos or knife of the Cavalry called Kouraka in Burma and kachadao in Chinese.  <br>  all this was done on the Silk Road going to Xi'an then the capital city of the Chinese emperors, and of the best silk ever made.

FAFIRBAuaa	Acoustic Guitar: <br>  In all types of guitars the sound is produced by the vibration of the strings. However, because the strings can only displace a small amount of air, the volume of the sound needs to be increased in order to be heard. In an acoustic guitar, this is accomplished by using a soundboard and a resonant cavity, the sound box. The body of the guitar is hollow. The vibrating strings drive the soundboard through the bridge, making it vibrate. The soundboard has a larger surface area and thus displaces a larger volume of air, producing a much louder sound than the strings alone.<br>  See it here: <a href="http://www.milkmanblues.com/images/614ce.jpg" rel="nofollow">http://www.milkmanblues.com/images/614ce...</a><br>  <br>  Classic Guitar<br>  These are typically strung with nylon strings, played in a seated position and are used to play a diversity of musical styles including classical music. The classical guitar's wide, flat neck allows the musician to play scales, arpeggios and certain chord forms more easily and with less adjacent string interference than on other styles of guitar.<br>  Classical guitars are sometimes referred to as classic guitars. <br>  See it here: <a href="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/e/e8/Classical_Guitar_two_views.jpg" rel="nofollow">http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/co...</a><br>  <br>  Hence classical guitar is also a type of acoustic guitar.|`|0AUPrCMZaa	side note: don't ever put steel strings, on a classical guitar.  you will bow the neck and probably rip out the tail piece.

Classical guitars use nylon strings with less tension, while acoustic mainly use metal wound strings.<br>  The tone you get from each is different, classical gives you a more mellow tone, and is easier to fret, whereas acoustic gives a sharper tone that is harder to fret.

Here's a brief synopsis.<br>  Murder in the Mountains<br>  <br>  Rob Allen lost his youth and his leg in Iraq. Being the single parent of a four year old girl has given him a reason to recover and paramedic school has given him the means. A disciplinary transfer has displaced him from his native Manhattan into the secluded mountains of northern Pennsylvania. His fears of boredom are quickly replaced by a struggle for survival. When Rob realizes that a traffic accident victim was actually murdered he enlists the help of Deputy Coroner Anna Drake. As the two investigate they discover that the crime of the city has its roots in the beautiful mountains. They become targets and race to stop the killer before more of their informants, or they and their families die.|`|f4a530a8e70966510447e8a372ccffacaa	The subject matter was pretty heavy, but I read "Thirteen Reasons Why" about a girl who had committed suicide and sent a series of cassette tapes to people she felt had contributed to her decision.

I relate the main character from White Darkness to myself (if you're only looking for books that are called 'teen fiction'.)     Nonfiction books are in my opinion more helpful for advice; you know they're not just saying something pretty but useless. For how to look at life, read The True History of the Elephant Man. It says almost nothing directly; it's the whole of the thing that makes a message.|`|AA11111233	Flowers for Algernon, by Daniel Keyes.

Oh, and for some reason, I understood Hermione from Harry Potter (JK Rowling) because, more often than not, I excel at school although not to the extent that Hermione does!    Books that have really given my advice are the Noughts and Crosses Series by Malorie Blackman as they gave me a real insight to what it's like for a coloured person living in a white country, or vice versa. They also made me think about inequality and racism in the world, and provided a suitable way from me to go from 'the kid who knows nothing about the world and doesn't care' to 'the teenager is learning about the world with ethusiasm'....    So, yeah. hope I helped    sdj  x
n6wUwJ1maa	My parents obtained an 'L S Lowry' pencil sketch a couple of years back. They took it to the Lowry Museum in Salford, Manchester to see if it was genuine. I think they waited about half a day for the decision. Apparently, Lowry is one of the more frequently forged artists - perhaps because the style is easy to imitate. Anyway, the decision was that the sketch might, or might not, be genuine, which didn't really help. I guess a painting would be easier for them to give an opinion on because with painting there are different brush strokes and techniques to help.    I'm certain that if yours is genuine, it would be worth a significant amount. As for the paperweight, I imagine the Lowry Museum could help with that too.

zHuqakJsaa	Holes, by Louis Sachar  There's a Boy in the Girl's bathroom, by Louis Sachar  Small Steps, by Louis Sachar  Skellig, by David Almond  Private Peaceful, by Michael Morpurgo  The Boy in the Striped Pyjamas, by John Boyne  Shadow of the Minotaur, by Alan Gibbons  Boy: Tales of Childhood, by Roald Dahl  Goodnight Mr Tom, by Michelle Magorian    Without knowing whether you're looking for books for a boy or a girl it's hard to write a really extensive list, but most the above should suit boys and girls.    For girls, I'd also recommend classics such as:  Charlotte's Web, by E.B. White  Little Women, by Louisa May Alcott    Girls also seem to love anything by Jacqueline Wilson.    If you're wanting to get started on the classics, there are some great illustrated versions and child-friendly language versions.  These can be a great stepping stone on the path to reading a whole classic novel properly.    Happy reading!|`|kAqjxDHaaa	Harry Potter books would be a good choice.

(Lauren has always known she was adopted but when a little research turns up the possibility that she was snatched from an American family as a baby, suddenly Lauren's life seems like a sham. How can she find her biological parents? And are her adoptive parents really responsible for kidnapping her? She manages to wangle a trip across the Atlantic where she runs away to try and find the truth. But the circumstances of her disappearance are murky and Lauren's kidnappers are still at large and willing to do anything to keep her silent...)    If its for a boy Harry Potter?    Another series I love is "Inkheart" it is a wonderful triology. It is great for boys and girls of all ages. Enchanting.  (Meggie is the daughter of a revered bookbinder called Mo whose peaceful existence is one night shattered by the arrival of Dustfinger--a shadowy man with a mysterious link to Mo's past. Mo and Meggie are soon on the move, running from something that threatens everything they hold dear. But the past inevitably catches up with them and Mo is forced to reveal to his daughter for the first time his terrible secret. He has the ability, or curse, to breathe life into any story he reads and make the characters come alive. Just such a character, the sinister Capricorn, is after Mo to ensure that he stays alive and is never returned to the pages from which he was sprung. And, of course, he'll stop at nothing to guarantee success.)|`|ocD3kv5oaa	Harry Potter?

kTlbsuKZaa	Usually I write for a month on and month off, that is because I'm not n a hurry, an that way I don't get blockages. Another point of view is that a force higher than yourself, commonly called 'the muse' is trying to bring you to the attention of the muse itself. Generally this is because the muse, as a separate identity, is a better sounding board than you by yourself or you ad other people who try to be helpful but who have no clue what a writer goes through.  I generally get outs of blocks by writing  parody of my own work This shows up the faults.|`|XZBJNwi1aa	Write about having writer's block.

Keep your mind off the subject matter, play football, swing a cat, keep your mind off what you are writing for a day or two, and, never stare at a white blank computer screen, that will give you writers block as well, instead, write what comes into your brain, roughly, even if it's not spelled correctly, or some bits don't sound right, then, you can mould and shape your work into something you like; a bit like a piece of clay, you constantly shape the clay to get something you want, but, before it was a master piece, it was a lump of unshaped clay waiting to be moulded... if you get my meaning.|`|PRgf7M6zaa	Well one way is just to sit down and struggle to get out any words you can.

siTibEIGaa	well if you have the key, you just tune it to whatever you like. A lot of modern rock drummers for instance, may tune one kick to a "D", and another to"F", because those are common keys in rock music. With the toms, I would tune them to a consonant sounding interval so your fills have a more melodic quality to them. Hope this helps.
WlRrHYl2aa	thats an interesting point. i never thought about that. im pretty sure it's just the prolougue, or maybe alice is telling it from Bella's view. im only on eclipse, so i haven't read breaking dawn yet when she.. oh dont wanna spoil it for ppl who are on twilight. my friend spoiled it for me. i can ask my friend who researches twilight in her spare time. ( some people have no life  ) and post it as a question. ok bye. good question :)|`|3fYRi1y4aa	I dont think that she can.  Good question tho.  I do think that There should be another book after Breaking Dawn that goes on further with their lives as they are left off.  I would like to know how a certain couples (not Edward and Bella) life goes on.  I dont want to spoil it but if you have read if you know what Im talking about.|`|jL9myhmqaa	nope....do yourself a favor and stop reading such trashy books|`|l854IXBgaa	No she can't.  I think Bella was looking back on it all when she wrote that.  But that's just my opinion.|`|i2MlcE84aa	She can't see the future, the dreams are the author's way of foreshadowing. (alluding to what will happen later in the book.)|`|vNDV3BMEaa	No, these are just prologues...  Basically, Meyer writes the book then chooses a small piece that she thinks would grab the readers attention and make him/her want to read the whole book rather than just the first chapter. This is then put at the front of the book, to do it's job. In some cases, the author will write a small piece that doesn't come into the actual book, but is related to it.  Think of it more as Meyer rearranging the story, rather than Bella telling it. It's just the way it's laid out on paper, not necessarily exactly the order it happened    As for the dreams on Isle Esme - the dreams Bella has feature a immortal child on a pile of dead bodies. Later on in the book, Renesmee can grow and change, unlike the immortal children and she also never leaves Bella. Bella is only having the dreams because she is thinking of the immortal children, not referring to her future daughter.        I know I probably didn't do a good job of explaining, but I hope I helped anyways    sdj x|`|5t0DYU6Baa	No.    They're not for Bella but for the reader.  They're like little hints that tell the reader what to expect later on and to create suspension.      That's what a prologue is.  It tells the reader what the rest of the passage/book etc is about.      And what do you mean "that exact thing later came true"?  Was Renesmee sitting on top of the bodies of her loved ones?  No.  The dreams were included in the book to create suspense.  Too many good things were happening at once, Meyer had to do something to provide intrigue and suspense in the book.    Stop analyzing the book so deeply.  I love it as well and I enjoyed reading it but if I start analyzing it I will start noticing more and more plot holes.  Stephenie Meyer has managed to write an amazing saga of vampire romance, but in my opinion, she screwed up in the last book.|`|kebzJDkJaa	twilight is gay|`|W0qNkROpaa	They're prologues, not dreams.

Not all of the dreams in the beginning of the book "come true"  They are basically Bella's wants or fears.  Sometimes they happen, but they usually don't.|`|lGF9GpI1aa	No she can't. Bella can protect herself and others from her mind being read.    Those parts are just prologues to get you interested in the book.|`|8SDg4Xy9aa	No she cant, their just little foreshadowing tid bits that you see happen later in the book.|`|bBsO0W3raa	No, Bella cannot see the future. There is not always a dream that foreshadows the future. In the 4th book the dream was of a Boy vampire child. Also in the second book the dream is of Bella becoming old n Edward is with her. In the first book she's just dreaming about Edward and calling out to him.     If you are talking about the prologue, it is just Bella telling it from the future.    The literary device is just a way to pick up some excitement. There is no future telling ability.      If you would like to ask Stephenie Meyer a question go onto her website and contact her.|`|ZUlnZvaWaa	It is just Stephanies crappy and inconsistent writing style bleeding through.|`|JwnHKTabaa	Nope, it's just her talking from a certain point in the book

If you believe in a God, which to me is some power in the Universe greater than myself, present your issue to God.  I emphasize you do not need to adopt a belief that is is wholly in line with the Judeo-Christian belief.  Do waste any time in figuring out what God is.  Just make a choice to belief or not.  After you have formed the question, sit quietly and meditate on it.  If you don't know how to meditate, just sit quietly and concentrate on your breath.  If a stray thought comes into your mind, acknowledge it and let it go.  As for affirmations or quotes, when I'm out-of-tune with the world, I repeat the Serenity Prayer over and over until I feel calm.

In that one you could express your feelings on the question I have.  " are we all connected to everybody who has ever lived or are we connected to all that ever will be in our own existence.  One way or the other ,Does this happen at the very first heartbeat , in the womb?    Perhaps, the poem is saying exactly that. but in the womb, she is not alone, she is already a part of all her ancestors and those in her blood line to come.  A little confused, I am, Perhaps you should have said She feels alone or She seems alone instead of she's(she is) alone. It would show the writer's insight.  If you wish to write something with few words. Say what you mean.Pick and choose your words with diligence.  she's evermore.... evermore, like forever, or is it her last name? "evermore" is too broad to mean anything  sorry for being so hard.

Anyway, its written quite well apart from the lack of paragraphs and editting, but I found it a little boring and all over the place for saying its the first chapter.|`|GFzDwIk6aa	Quite interesting. Well written.
1TPGdaXJaa	I agree with your principle that in some cases of psychotic dramas their behavior is seen as logical - to the person who is doing it. What I am trying to say is that I don't think that a person sees themself as crazy, even when committing a brutal act of violence, even the rest of us may see them as being insane.    I think that a persons perception on life, and everything it entails, is created partially by their inheritance (of both the mind and genetically) as well as the factors that have shaped their environment throughout their life. Sometimes these can become completely skewed - and the person may lack the influence in their life that would reveal the moral wrongness to what they are doing.    So, when someone is committing some brutal act of violence, I believe that at that moment they have a perception on the situation, created by the factors mentioned above, that make it "make sense" at that time.|`|ofCRTXw9aa	I think for SOME criminals, they are looking for love. But I took a psychology course and we found a couple of criminals with actual differences in their brains. Some people just have something that makes violence appealing to them. & some people, just feel nothing. They feel like violence is the closest they can get to feeling anything.|`|PEVkrOVVaa	Since when has killing other and terrorizing been substitutes for love?  These things happen because there was no love, or no money, and the inner most thought "why should they have what I don't", and let them feel how I feel.  There is jealousy, greed and hatred behind all these wars, which are totally self centered, cause if they were not, they would not kill innocent people to prove a point (or what ever the hell they try to prove when they blow up innocent people).  It is hardly a misunderstanding, rather it is not wanting to understand or tolerate ideas, culture, religions that are different from oneself.|`|1tccQF3gaa	It can't be excused by the fact we don't understand because we blatantly do!|`|ZwECcnh1aa	Wow, I never thought Id hear anyone else say that. I think in a way we are all looking for love, and at times we dont even know it. Its like Jesus said, "forgive them for they know not what they do". Because we all live subjective lives, it can be hard to see the impact we have on others, or the amount of pain we cause without even realizing it. If you find out that a murderer was abused as a child, and never fully resolved his pain, it can be understood why he commited his crime. Somebody who is lost, hurt and confused is likely to exercise these emotions externally.

Yes, I sometimes feel "old" when I see the answers from (obviously) young people, but I won't let it deter me, because I know I also have some experience in life and other "qualifications" and I know that even when my answers are not what some of them want or they're not acceptable to some, there will be some others who will value them (Best Answers!)

In this book, Crichton recounts his experiences and examines the insights he gained into life as a result. He tells about attending Harvard Medical School, climbing Mt.

Just because there's a dragon, elves, dwarves, and other mythical creatures in it doesn't mean it's not a good book.  And after you read that one there are Eldest and Brisingr.

m1dzVuAtaa	Europeans and American Indians failed to "Get Along," as you say, due to a number of reasons...    The Primary of those is Greed. Europeans arrived in the New World with the belief that all the land they discovered was also entitled to them. They "discovered" the land, therefore it belonged to them. And in this time period, Land equated power and freedom from an oppressive ruling class. The more land a European owned, the more prosperous he was, especially if he could mine precious minerals from the ground, like Gold.     Europeans were also very comfortable with subordinating other cultures, as they already had African slaves. When they perceived the lifestyle of the Natives in the New World to be "primitive," just as they saw Africans as primitive, then they felt no remorse in trying to dominate and exploit them for their own purposes. European logic states that "Might makes Right," and since they had guns and horses and other tools for violence, they were within their rights to crush the Native people and steal their land.     Another factor is Religion. Many groups of Europeans (a vague term) were taught that Christianity was the supreme religion, the only RIGHT religion in existance. That meant that all other religions were inferior and "wrong," and that Christians had the right to show savage, unsaved people the error of their ways. And they believed that they could do that through force and intimidation.  America was certainly not the first place they'd done such. So while Europeans were passing judgement on Native Americans as Savages, they also saw their religion as a sin and something to be wiped out. Add to this the fact that the Church taught settlers that they had a "Divine Right"  -- known later as Manifest Destiny -- to the land in the New World. It was their God-Given "right" to settle on it and use it as they pleased, whether it kept the native people from being able to survive or not.|`|8e9a28782c8446395b12f275754b4b76aa	Religion.|`|V60mZea1aa	The Indians saw them as intruders and killed them .

They tried to take their land away and impose their religion. The Natives opposed both.|`|xQwU590Laa	The Europeans/colonists saw that the Natives had a sparse population, and much land, and they wanted most of it for themselves.  The Natives wanted to keep the land they had.     While usually the USA tried to prevent settlers from moving into Indian lands, they could not afford to put enough soldiers on the frontiers to prevent them from moving into lands they had no right to.  They then had no Choice but to support them when fighting started.
TlLA1DVoaa	You don't have to do much! It is already really good!!     My only suggestions...    line 1: Maybe change "on" to "this way" or "this path" or "my path"  line 2: Replacing "I think of you" to "Thinking of you" would help it flow better  line 14: Maybe change "comprehend" to a word with only two syllables, if you can find one  line 21: maybe put a comma between "flipped" and "turned"  line 26: Change "has gotta" to "must". It's more concise.    Remember, these are just my opinions...you're the poet. However, I do think that some of those little things would improve the poem.    Other than that, I think that it's really good! I hope that you give it to the person it was written for!!!

f2986b83c8bb87ba5ae96c4ebf250e51aa	I could be sarcastic and say "He became the emperor," but that wouldn't answer your question.    His family tree was filled with murderers and perverts, his mother among them.  She committed incest with him on a regular basis in order to maintain her control of him.  She had married her uncle, Claudius, and fed him toadstools to clear the way for her son to become emperor.  Agrippina was no Mother Teresa.    Okay, so he had a lot of baggage, but the first few years of his reign weren't too bad.  Then he suffered some illness (possibly lead poisoning--the instability of many of the Roman emperors, it has been speculated, was due to the use of lead pipes in the aqueducts and fountains), and apparently began to behave quite erratically afterward.      For one thing, he became obsessed with Greek culture--not necessarily a bad thing in itself--and fancied himself quite the performer.  He also develped paranoia on a grand scale.  He was certain that the intellectual men of Rome were plotting against him (and they probably were), and caused many of them to opt for suicide, leaving him large bequests in their wills in order to, they hoped, leave a little something for their heirs.    No one really knows for certain just what started the fire of Rome.  Speculation has included such theories as arson by radical Christians, who wanted to hurry up Christ's return (many in the first century believed that this was imminenent), to a smuggled, unattended cookstove in one of the tenements in the Suburra, to  spontaneous combustion in a grain storehouse.  Nero might have been a pretty unpleasant fellow in a thousand ways, but since he was out of town at the time, I doubt that he was the incindiary.    So much has been written of how Christians suffered in the aftermath that I'll only say that there were some real refinements in cruelty practiced.  However, there  is an interesting novel, The Flames of Rome, that builds on newer scholarship--just remember, it IS fiction, not fact.     After that, Nero behaved like your average rock star a couple millennia later.  He made a tour of Greece, taking part in poetic competitions that he invariably won.  I wonder why.    Finally, his misgovernment got to the point where someting had to be done.  I don't think many really cared about his buffoonery, but state business was beeing seriously neglected, so he was deposed.    Nero then fled, but was pursued.  When his enemies were closing in, he took the expected way out--suicide.  His last words were, supposedly, "What an artist is perishing with me!"    Ah, well.  Had he been born in another time and situation, he might have been simply your garden variety wacko, but it wasn't his fate to be just the neighborhood looney tune.|`|AA10729675	Like he really ordered Rome to be set in fire, so he could sing with his lyre as if he were in front of burning Troy.    Like he then accused the Christians, who at the time were underground people and a real mob of their own.  Although we try to depict them as saints, they were not.  Like he killed a lot of people in the arena, mostly Christians.  Not that Nero went into the arena, but there were gladiator fights more than ever, and he had lions, tigers, snakes, elephants trample over the innocent Christians, or devour them.  etc...  Like he poisoned his own mother.  Like he really did a lot of bad things.  No, every emperor did not do that at all.  The games in the arena, ok because the people of Rome wanted games and bread.  But all the other crimes, no.  Except Domitian and the emperors who were against the Christians.  Otherwise, there was no reason to commit such crimes.|`|kZeu2Dyzaa	Primarily he was known to persecute anyone who was a Christian.    Documents suggest that he was responsible for the fire and that it was set in order to be used to "prove" how dangerous the Christians were (he framed them for it).    He was also an unfeeling tyrant who was most likely a sociopath.|`|AA6Aq94vaa	Largely he was corrupt, incompetent and insane.    Rome did burn during his reign but he didn't burn it himself, likely it was an accident. He did nothing to slow the fire, but I'm not sure there was a whole lot he could do.   More importantly he over abused his power, especially when it came to money. He took funds out of other areas to build pleasure palaces for himself. He also ignored the needs of the empire so he could focus on himself. He also overtaxed the populace.  Some people claim he persecuted the Christians, but actually he didn't care about them (or anyone else for that matter) Many Romans did blame the Christians for the fire, but it is really unclear if Nero had anything to do with that.    Nero ended up getting commiting suicide after the Senate ordered his death and after his guards abandoned him due to a combination of being treated cruelly by the emporor and changing politics in Rome.|`|AA11442722	Primarily it was the draining of the treasury, the abuse of power against powerful Romans.  Nero ignored the existing power structures and killed anybody he even thought might oppose him. His policies were oppressive and Nero morbidly self absorbed. His ego was too big even for Rome. He was clearly insane as well.     Nero's role in the burning of Rome is unclear but the leading theory is that Nero wanted the land and when it burned he got to build the lavish buildings he wanted to build. The fire spread well beyond the intended area but Nero had no concern for anybody but himself and tales that he sat there and revelled in the blaze probably has some truth to it.

I grew up in a school system that taught U.S. history as nothing but memorization of facts and dates.  We forget that history is the story of people who hoped, loved, and experience many of the same things we do.  U.S. history might also seem boring to you since that is what American schools (understandably) teach, and they don't do a good job of presenting the "other" side of the story.|`|0hSpsSByaa	Different people have different interests, but history was always my favorite subject and US history in particular.

Perhaps if you visited a Civil War re-enactment later this spring or summer, we could spur more interest in ya.

Ya don't know what you're missing - especially when the artillery opens!  Those ain't toys, and yes, that's real gunpowder we shoot 'em with.    Go see the movie "Gettysburg" - those thousands of soldiers aren't paid movie extras, those are US!  Damn, but we had fun helping make that flick!

Or you can concentrate on a specific topic like the struggle of african americans from slavery to segregation to the civil tights struggle to where we are today with an african american president. Often recent history seems ordinary just because we are so familiar with it, but we are living history today that we will tell our grandchildren about years from now!!!|`|AA11442722	It's you LOL.  Rome and Greece have rather similar histories as much of our culture is influenced by those two cultures. We were not as brutal as we conquered other lands but that is mostly a byproduct of the times the US was born. Which were gentler times.     Much of the world finds our brief history fascinating. Cowboys and Indians are a world wide icon. The space program, our Constitution inspiring several other revolutions and becoming the basis of almost every Constitution in the world. In fact the very idea of having a Constitution was an American invention really.     The US civil war introduced modern warfare to the world. Had European generals studied the US Civil war they could have avoided many of the mistakes made in WW I.     The gangsters and prohibition. Who cannot be fascinated by them?     Whatever you say about the wars with Native tribes boring isn't a good description. Heros on both sides. Betrayals, massecres, honorable men, it's all there.     The various regions and their special history such as the Appalachians and the fueds, wars and culture. Texas and it's revolt from Mexico. Alaska and it's unique history.     The clipper ships and their contributions.     The US military contributions to the world such as putting an end to the Tripoli pirates, our involvement in the world wars, etc.     All history is boring if you just memorize dates and names. American history though for as short a time as the US has existed is packed full of events like no other nation before. The US has accomplished more in it's short history than most nations with ten times the history.      Yes it's easier to digest a world in simpler times. When nations were not expected to uphold the standards the US has been held too. The Greeks and Romans could be downright brutal at times. That's glossed over in history. The complexities and manuvers lost in history so too will be much of our history. 1,000 years from now Truman who? Will be people's reaction to that period of time. The Korean war will be mostly forgotten. Nam probably barely a footnote. Recent history is always full of events that in the long term will be meaningless. US history is mostly recent history.|`|nE9BaUWIaa	Yes, it's confined to just one country.|`|xfqHi1tRaa	While I ended up with a degree in history, I also hated the high school version.     Generally the textbooks are crap and many times the teachers are just coaches that need a teaching job. Not a great combination!     Then, as a junior in high school, I discovered a class called "Humanities". It too was history, but focused on the stories and the people -- with a high emphasis on the arts. That's when I discovered how great and interesting it really was.     Don't get me wrong, there ARE some great high school history teachers out there -- many of them are teaching AP and/or college classes so they only get the better students, but until the expectations of high school history change, it may continue to be boring. Remember, ALL students are required to take US history, and that will affect the class as well.    Often world history (or other specialized areas) are electives, therefore the kids want to be there and the classes tend to be more interesting.    For the record though -- I still don't care much for Colonial America -- there are other more interesting periods for me.|`|Zu0Qt8fjaa	Meh, all I ever done about American history is the revolution where you stopped being part of my great nation (yeah thats right :D).  I did History for my GCSE and all we do about is NAZIS, which gets suprisingly boring after a while...|`|AA11586960	the way to make history more interesting is to look at what they don't teach    who cares about some stupid apple of the bloke with wooden teeth     try looking at all the aspects of the war in 1812 where the us Declared on what is known as Canada and lost and how generous the Vanquishers were     or the sacrifices at the Alamo and was MacArthur such a great leader or was he just the best available     and here is a doosy research Eisenhower     do a web search "Eisenhower's Death camps"     did Patton order his troops to kill POW'S and did they ???    your History is very interesting if you look outside the Square     i found historic movies Like the Longest day food for thought  you have the Basics of who what and where look further who got off the beach first who had the Greatest losses and Why     ask why the US military took their Racism to the UK and put up signs WHITES ONLY in london and under who's authority  ????    these are some of the things conveniently not mentioned      and why Eisenhower was promoted to a 5 star not for his exploits in war   read what congress said about the Promotions     here is a clue Montgomery was promoted and Knighted By the King for a job well done in North Africa not to out rank Eisenhower he already did that monty before D Day was a general on promotion to Field Marshal  a 6 star so before promotion was a 5 star Eisenhower was a 5 star from Dec 1944 then went back to a 3 star because peace the US military convert all their 5 stars back to their true level 3 stars     congress said will we will promote in any field of conflict  to ensure US military holds the senior position irrelevant  of his qualifications or Experiences the US must be in charge ask WHY    as you can see my interest the Truth and WW2

5ca2593ad3e428e83b65ed58e617b120aa	Yes and Yes.<br>  <br>  We pray as a family.  We pray out loud in our home over meals as well as prayers before we start our scripture studies in the morning and have family prayer together in the evening.  And when we travel, we pray before we start our trip.<br>  <br>  We pray together as a couple.  We thank our Heavenly Father for how he has blessed us that we are both in good health, that we strive to continue to be good parents, and bless us for hearts that are willing to improve in the areas that we need to.  It has been the most spirtual experience praying beside my Husband on bended knee.<br>  <br>  And we all pray singly.  Sometimes I pray out loud or sometimes I pray privately.  It depends on what is going on in the house hold.  Is it quite?  Peaceful?  Or can I hear the kids playing in the other room?  Etc.<br>  <br>  People should pray for the right reasons not just when they are in a time of need or stress.  They should be thankful for the peaceful times as well.|`|uyQXdKLiaa	Religion isn't the opium of the masses, it's the placebo of the masses.|`|Rt4bJfVAaa	Well I look at other things that are obvious and people take for granted.<br>  <br>  For example Man lives on earth he did not create.  It is an earth with climate conditions and can provide us food and housing that we have intelligently harnassed to provide for our needs.  Many people in Western countries can go to the stores and buy what they need.  We have cars and public transportation that can get us to our appointed times for our convenience.  I say the intelligence God gave man enabled man to create all these things to benefit one another.<br>  <br>  We exist in physical bodies (some say which evolved but I do not) that enable us to function intelligently.  No man created such a body for us with all the vital organs like the brain, heart, lungs, kidneys, arms, legs eetc to exist in.   I say God provided us this provision.  <br>  <br>  When one looks in the medical field Jesus Christ when he was here 2,000 years ago or more healed people just as doctors do today.  Since He is the creator and made man perfect with Adam and Eve he wants man to be healthy and intelligent.  Since the time of Jesus Christ the knowledge and technology of man has come to perhaps even duplicate and do more than what Jesus Christ did.   In fact if we were a time traveler and told those people what we take for granted daily in medical advances they might have you stoned but surely the unbeliving public would call you looney tunes or even blasphemous.  At the most stoned to death.<br>  <br>  What I am saying is God has done so many things for us that we take for granted.  It is so obvious that we overlook it.  But as a believer in God I tend to look at the total picture.  I do not get bound by a single event or issue and say God cannot possibly exist because of that one incident.  God is too big for that.  And the mind of man can certainly expand itself or be understanding enough to see a larger picture than what it appears to be.<br>  <br>  God does help people out even when people cannot see it.  I do pray out loud alone or with others depending on the circumstance.  God does answer me but not in the ways I understand.  But who can understand the mind or will of God any way? <br>  <br>  Just personal opinon for what it's worth.|`|AA10217752	When I'm alone I don't pray out loud. When I'm with someone, or some people, yes, I pray out loud (this happens mostly before a meal).<br>  <br>  As to the question why would God help someone who doesn't ask for help, those who don't ask for help are usually the ones who are really in need of help. They don't ask because they think it's a sign of weakness, but really, they need all the help they can get. If I were God, I would definitely help those who don't ask. (It doesn't mean either that I will ignore those who are vocal about asking for help.)|`|fDHOKkjdaa	You just answered the question. He simply wouldn't.

He was just snuffling along, investigating interesting smells, burying bones only to dig them up again, and looking out for lady dogs, when – bam – the symbolic structure of the book picks him up and decrees he has to die. Why? What did poor Tim the Dog ever do to get infected with rabies and be gunned down like, well, a dog?<br>  <br>  For starters, there’s his name. It may seem odd to give an animal the last name of the family it belongs to, but it’s apparently common practice in Maycomb – Judge Taylor’s pooch gets the same treatment. But more interestingly, it allows the dog’s name to sound suspiciously like that of another character. Tim Johnson…Tom Robinson? Coincidence? Perhaps. But Scout’s memory of her father shooting the dog does pop up more than once in situations involving Tom, and doesn’t get mentioned otherwise.<br>  <br>  For example, after Scout turns away the lynch mob, her memory of Atticus in front of the jail merges with her memory of him shooting the dog.<br>  <br>  I was very tired, and was drifting into sleep when the memory of Atticus calmly folding his newspaper and pushing back his hat became Atticus standing in the middle of an empty waiting street, pushing up his glasses. The full meaning of the night's events hit me and I began crying. (16.3)<br>  <br>  But why does Scout associate the two images? Perhaps they’re both examples of Atticus doing tough things he doesn’t want to do. Or of Atticus facing off with a mindless threat. (He does later refer to the men in the lynch mob as "animals" [16.22]).

Before the incident, the children (Jem and Souut) did not think much of their father. Atticus had married late and he was old, nearly fifty. Thus, he did not do things most dads did and Scout was not impressed--she had nothing to brag about to her classmates. In chapter 10, Scout mentioned that" He did not drive a dump truck for the country, he was not a sheriff.....". Aditionally, Scout also ironically remarked that " he never went hunting, he did not play poker or fish or drink or...only sat in the living room and read."(For some reason, she would have liked it if her father was involved in such "vices") To put it simply, she was not impressed with Atticus.<br>  <br>   However after the mad dog incident, in which Atticus killed the rabid dog,Tim Johnson, with one shot, the children had a totally different impression of Atticus. Jem and Scout were stunned--they never knew that Atticus was a talented "rifleman" and possesed such an ability. This incident was the start of the children's growing respect of Atticus, which reaches its peak in the Tom Robinson trial. It also goes to show Atticus' humility--He never mentioned that he could shoot to Jem and Scout. He did not brag about it but instead felt that "there was nothing to be proud of".<br>  <br>  For the symbols and meaning part, look up on one of the most crucial phrase of the book, "Shoot all the bluejays.....but remember, its a sin to kill a mockingbird." The mocking bird refers to a vulnerable or innocent person, like BOO Radley and Tom Robinson.

It was instantly successful and has become a classic of modern American fiction. The novel is loosely based on the author's observations of her family and neighbors, as well as on an event that occurred near her hometown in 1936, when she was 10 years old.<br>  <br>  The novel is renowned for its warmth and humor, despite dealing with serious issues of rape and racial inequality. The narrator's father, Atticus Finch, has served as a moral hero for many readers and as a model of integrity for lawyers. One critic explained the novel's impact by writing, "In the twentieth century, To Kill a Mockingbird is probably the most widely read book dealing with race in America, and its protagonist, Atticus Finch, the most enduring fictional image of racial heroism."<br>  <br>  These links should give you detailed and excellent answers to this and other questions :<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.bookrags.com/To_Kill_a_Mockin..." rel="nofollow">http://www.bookrags.com/To_Kill_a_Mockin...</a><br>  <a href="http://www.bookrags.com/notes/tkm/" rel="nofollow">http://www.bookrags.com/notes/tkm/</a><br>  <a href="http://www.sparknotes.com/lit/mocking/" rel="nofollow">http://www.sparknotes.com/lit/mocking/</a><br>  <a href="http://www.cliffsnotes.com/WileyCDA/LitN..." rel="nofollow">http://www.cliffsnotes.com/WileyCDA/LitN...</a><br>  <a href="http://www.novelguide.com/tokillamocking..." rel="nofollow">http://www.novelguide.com/tokillamocking...</a><br>  <a href="http://www.pinkmonkey.com/booknotes/monk..." rel="nofollow">http://www.pinkmonkey.com/booknotes/monk...</a><br>  <a href="http://www.gradesaver.com/ClassicNotes/T..." rel="nofollow">http://www.gradesaver.com/ClassicNotes/T...</a><br>  <a href="http://www.pinkmonkey.com/booknotes/barr..." rel="nofollow">http://www.pinkmonkey.com/booknotes/barr...</a><br>  <a href="http://www.bookwolf.com/Free_Booknotes/T..." rel="nofollow">http://www.bookwolf.com/Free_Booknotes/T...</a><br>  <a href="http://www.awerty.com/tokill2.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.awerty.com/tokill2.html</a>

Like paper rounds or a small saturday job, then if you pay half it wouldn't be so much of a worry. But if she just says no, then tell her like " Just let me start, and see how i get on. If it isint working then i will stop". You cant really say much more, but once you ask her why she is refusing against it then work at that. If it is because you have too much other things around then say you can manage and that you could get yourself to the gym without her having the trouble of driving you.

Use the mom in the photos such as have her hold the baby to her chest with her head on the babies head while it's sleeping and have the mom close her eyes. Use your zoom lense so you can place the baby anywhere and only get the baby not the bed/room/car seat. Try to schedule the session for after feeding, after napping, during sleeping. Dressed and undressed. Two month olds don't do much including smile or laugh so whatever you do isn't going to be easy to capture. They are also still fairly ruddy skinned which is why I suggested B & W film. Daylight would be great so early or morning or late afternoon. Good Luck.

WshwHtk9aa	Try reading other books to study them.    Most good writers read. Most do so for pleasure, sure, but all of them do it to learn from one another. Maybe your "ideas" are better, but is your sentence structure? Is your ability to map our a plot arc or balance half a dozen subplots? What about your pace and flow for paragraph and chapter length? Can you write dialogue better than Twain or Faulkner? Can you write description better than Poe or Wolfe?     If you don't want to read for ideas, then read for technique. You don't become an architect without studying pre-existing buildings. You don't become a theoretical astrophysicist without studying basic algebra. You don't become a jet pilot without first studying flight mechanics. And you don't become a truly gifted, successful writer without studying the writings of others than came before.   Even Stephanie Meyer, who seems to have just up and become a writer overnight with wild success on her first ever book actually got a degree in English Literature in college. That means that she spent at least four years reading, analyzing, and studying story and story-telling techniques before ever putting out her own work.|`|lGF9GpI1aa	I am exactly the same as you! I am actually writing my own story right now. I hate reading too. Book reports and reading assignments are my least favorite things. I actually think that you can be a good writer without reading. For one thing, when you read a book, you are more likely to adopt the author's writing habits. It is better to write like yourself. The more that you read the more of a chance you will kinda copy someone else's story by mistake.|`|JcEsMfL3aa	Yes just read a small interesting book with about 3 chapters then try maybe 5 and so on do not force just read. Like me i only like animal books either wise i will not read it what do you like then look with a book with it in and i know you will be a great author.|`|9iWqc5CNaa	You don't have to be a reader to write good stories, as long as you have the passion, creativity and imagination. Inspiration is also an important part in writing, and you don't have to look at books for inspiration-it can be drawn from your own experiences and surroundings.The story comes from you, from your own thoughts and imagination.|`|TfAkWLigaa	Their are many amazing short stories around, and i don't mean the kind of short stories you get shown in class at school but professional, interesting and very enthralling short stories about many different issues and genres. Just search around for something that you feel you would enjoy and im sure you would be able to sit and read it, maybe chapter at a time or a couple of paragrahs.   hope this helped.        PS: To be fair, if you really aspire to be a writer then nothing should stand in your way.   good luck x|`|BzMQejGxaa	Unlikely.    If you don't read, your vocabulary and writing style won't grow. A good idea does not make a good novel. It is how that idea is presented and explored and shown to the reader that makes a good novel.    I'm buzzing with ideas too when I read, it seems. Read short fast-paced books and work on your concentration.    Anyway, if you hate reading, surely you won't read your own work?    Write down your ideas by the way, and come back to them once you've read a bit more.

rOY2J0UAaa	In the late 300s Campanian mercenaries hired by the Greeks seized the town of Messana on the straights separating Sicily from Italy. These mercenaries called themselves Mamertines (derived from the Oscan name for Mars the god of war). They used the town as a base for raiding nearby towns. The Mamertines were hostile to Pyrrhus (he might have restored order in Sicily). After his departure, they were attacked by Hiero, tyrant of Syracuse. They asked for and received a Carthaginian garrison. Some of the Mamertines thought better of this, and requested Roman assistance against the Carthaginians. When the Romans eventuallly agreed to protect the Mamertines, war with Carthage resulted.|`|1hvrQYWiaa	In Sicily, the cities of Messana and Syracuse were at war. Separate factions in Messana asked Rome and Carthage for help.The Carthaginians arrived first, but were driven out by the Romans.The Carthaginians then allied with Syracuse, thus starting war with Rome
LaNHQp6daa	My favorite was Eclipse, followed by New Moon. And Yes, I knew it was the ending but I still wanted more! I loved the series and I couldn't believe it was over. That's weird because I thought of the same thing also...maybe since the two of them are different they will live to be about the same age? lol. So I liked Eclipse because, for me it had a little bit of everything, action, romance, suspense and a good amount of time between Jacob and Edward! =D|`|ZB0ITe2Oaa	I like Twilight, the first book. To me it just seems more original, and to be honest, I liked James. :)  It could also be because there aren't werewolves yet; however, werewolves are still kind of cool.|`|ewd9n2lRaa	My favorite was Twilight (Book 1).|`|kktoXldiaa	My favorite book was breaking dawn. It was just a great book,the wedding,bella getting pregnant and everything! I think thats probly going to be the best twilight movie out of the whole series.|`|X7GrfPjKaa	Breaking Dawn, definitely. But I thought it had quite a weak ending.|`|szvDqLo7aa	I loved them all but I would have to say Twilight and Eclipse were my favorites. Twilight because it gives you the basis for Edward's and Bella's relationship. You really get to know the characters. Eclipse because Edward and Bella have to rebuild their relationship. I think it is very realistic that Bella is in love with two guys and she has to choose. Of course, there was no real competition and she knew who she would end up with, but it's a problem that every day girls have to face all the time.|`|gRAqTQBPaa	I enjoyed basically all of them, but I particually enjoyed New Moon and Breaking Dawn. Breaking Dawn was facinating, but it had its boring moments. New Moon was depressing at the beginning, but once you read when Edward returned, it was magical. Also, I almost threw my copy of New moon against the wall when Edward was saying his goodbyes in the woods by Bellas house, when Bella says, 'You..don't..want..me?' you could tell she was devestated. Then, when you turned the page, it was right there on the page, Edwards response saying, 'No'. That is when i trully hated the book, until the end.       Listen to the song, When It Rains by Paramore.  Its one of my favorite songs otherwise, but if you listen to the lyrics, it reminds me of the part in New Moon when Bella is running to find Edward and it starts to rain. Listen to the lyrics, its cativating,  vvvvv this is the website exactly.    http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7G1daExcu...|`|95M9WTqoaa	i loved breaking dawn then twilight  new moon and eclipse are tied for me  i just loved in breaking dawn how it ended  i loved hearing of her transformation and how they interacted together after.|`|gu3GAFC9aa	Twilight|`|4F1CYR2Waa	DAH ONE WHERE I LEFT.

AA10729675	Mesopotamians were inventors.  They needed to: necessity is mother of invention.  They were a very pessimistic nation.  Their religion was awfully pessimistic.  So they turned their eyes toward the planet and became the most famous astrologers of their time (only 5th c. B.C.), then they became true astronomers.  They also had the best pharmacopoeia that existed.  They wanted to fight against disease.  They wanted to do whatever they could to really live.  They started with magics but that developed into science.  They invented a system of numeration; they invented a weight system, sexagesimal.  They may be the inventors of algebra.  They liked calculating.  Since after death everything was so grim, they worked hard in their life and they codified everything including their laws (Hammurabi was not the first one to have a codified system of laws).  Their rivers sometimes did not yield enough water for their land to be fertile.  They had a miserable life sometimes so they worked hard.  They invented the calendar, maybe to record their misery, who knows?|`|E0PQQaNjaa	They had consistent good soil - therefore good crops, were in an excellent place for weather, trade, and food. Therefore they had enough necessitites secured to have time to invent things. Also, because they began intricate trading both with themselves and their neighbors, they needed to record things: taxes, trade agreenebts, laws, etc. Thus, written records are invented: the first written documents were financial. From there, it just made sense to write down laws *Hammurabi's Code* and so forth. This created an exchange of ideas, a stable social systme and voila! People keep inventing!

AA11586196	A good choice would be "A Small, Good Thing" by Raymond Carver. Carver was a master of minimalism and brevity is an important concept to teach young writers. Another good choice would be "Everything That Rises Must Converge" by Flannery O'Connor. Dialogue can be a tricky thing to master, and O'Connor's use of it in this story is a great example. My final reccomendation is "The Things They Carried" by Tim O'Brien. This is a great example of storycraft. Use this story to teach style and voice. As you can tell, I like to keep my examples more contemporary. Not that older works aren't good, but these three stories are great examples of how you would like to teach your class to write. Good luck!|`|WhUV9k6Jaa	Some favorite short stories:    The Short Happy Life of Francis McComber by Ernest Hemingway  Bartleby the Scrivener by Herman Melville  The Pit and the Pendulum by Edgar Allen Poe  Araby by James Joyce|`|jUoYw3BOaa	Wow, I agree with all these answers. Particulary "The Lottery," "Perfect Day for Bananafish," "The Things They Carried," "Araby," "Bartleby the Scrivener." All of these are excellent choices! In fact, check out Salinger's "Nine Stories;" it's a compilation of his short stories including the Bananafish one, and they all relate back to his theme on wartime America.    Besides those, "Where Are You Going, Where Have You Been?" by Joyce Carol Oates is one of my favorites, very easy to read, and about a young girl of about 13 losing her innocence. Another one, "The Yellow Wallpaper," by Charlotte Perkins Gilman, this story has haunted me for a long time since I've read it in college. And my final pick.... dun-dun-duuuunn...... drumroll....... "The Swimmer," by John Cheever. Complex, but short, and a LOT to analyze and discuss in it.     Also, any of the Flannery O' Connor short stories are great.     I've never read these two either, but my friends have recommended them to me and taught them in high school, so they can't be too difficult either: "Bullet in the Brain"- about a man who kills himself, and "Bernice Bobs Her Hair" by F. Scott Fitzgerald.    Good luck to you!|`|vFF5vwqsaa	I have to agree with Araby, that is a great one    Anything in Dubliners by Joyce  Drown by Junot Diaz  Anything by F. Scott Fitzgerald is great  The Separation by John Updike  Even if you buy America's Best Short stories of 2008, you will find a lot there.|`|suxCcXkAaa	I was an English major and had to read a ton of short stories. I loved "The Sphinx Without a Secret" by Oscar Wilde, "A Perfect Day for Bananafish" by J.D. Salinger, a multitude of Raymond Carver stories for style...there are two I don't know the authors of, but you could probably find--"The Ones Who Walk Away From Omelas" (creepy but really sad and thought-provoking), and "An Occurence at Owl Creek Bridge." I also loved "The Yellow Wallpaper," and Poe's "Cask of Amontilliado." Shirley Jackson's "The Lottery" is pretty suspenseful and scary as well, and studied quite often in college classes. Here are some really great studying resources for the latter three stories:    http://www.shmoop.com/intro/literature/e...    http://www.shmoop.com/intro/literature/s...    http://www.shmoop.com/intro/literature/c...

However, as was also the custom of the region, the adolescent bride was to spend much time at her parents' house, and away from her husband. In 1885, when Gandhi was 15, the couple's first child was born, but survived only a few days; Gandhi's father, Karamchand Gandhi, had died earlier that year. Mohandas and Kasturbai had four more children, all sons: Harilal, born in 1888; Manilal, born in 1892; Ramdas, born in 1897; and Devdas, born in 1900.|`|AA10729675	His wife's name was Kasturba Kapadian.

AA11898755	The color theory concept is referred to as "simultaneous constrast." When complimentary colors (colors which are opposite each other on a color wheel) are placed adjacent to, next to,  each other they are each made more intense and can even be made to seem to vibrate in the eye. Using bright colors and positioning them next to their compliments is a means of intensifying the visual impact of the imagery. An interesting sidebar is that if complimentary colors are mixed together they have the opposite effect by turning to a grey.|`|And9dyrwaa	black is opposite to white  Yellow is opposite purple,   blue opposite orange.  like that it varies  when we look upon the standard color wheel    http://www.color-wheel-pro.com/color-the...|`|T2C6hqaAaa	Your teacher must mean complimentary colours, like yellow and purple, red and green.

7HBKzJSHaa	Don't pay attention to the other person who answered, he makes no sense.    For instants, Portugal's colonies lasted from the early 1400's 100 years before any other european country, to the 1990's, long after any other colonial country.    Portugal in the 16th century had control over ALL of Africa, much of what is now Brazil, control over the Persian Gulf, Zanzibar, Hormuz, several cities in India like Bombay, Calcutta, Goa, also in Malaysia, Indonesia, Celebes, several commercial outposts in China including Macau and even created the major outpost of Nagasaki since the portuguese were the first europeans ever to arrive in Japan and even in Korea.    Portugal had a Commercial Empire, FAR greater than that of Spain which was limited to the Americas and later the Philippines.    Spain ruled with an iron fist and specialized on the exploitation of gold and the annihilation of the Inca Empire by force, while Portugal traded african gold and european goods like textiles for the asian spices, chinese porcelains and silk.    Portugal effectively created Globalization by exploring, discovering and controlling alone the Sea Route to Asia since 1488 to at least the late 1600's when the Dutch and English followed the portuguese footsteps and began to took over.    Despite that Portugal remained a colonial power and still maintained several countries in Africa, Cape Verde, Guinea-Bissau, Angola, S.Tome and Principe and Mozambique until 1975, the territories in India of Daman, Diu and Goa until the 1960's and Macau in China until 1999.|`|idfDPhiWaa	You don't have a CLUE what you are talking about, do you?  All you know are the buzz words and nothing else or you would know that PORTUGAL had NOTHING to do with Spanish colonial rule in the 16th century.. THE 1500'S that is and the Spains rule in the 1500's was limited to MEXICO and PERU and by the end of the 16th century, the Portugese had pretty much left the world stage of "colonial rule".    I really HATE these buzz word questions you people ask and try not to show you don't know what you are talking about so you hope we will supply the parts you have never bothered to read about.

o3sYIdOzaa	"The President and Mrs. Roosevelt were leaders in the effort to help the German Jews fleeing political persecution. Mrs. Roosevelt was a founder of the International Rescue Committee in 1933 which brought intellectuals, labor leaders, and political figures fleeing Hitler to sanctuary in the United States. President Roosevelt made a public point of inviting many of them to the White House. In 1936, in response to the Nazi confiscation of personal assets as a precondition to Jewish emigration, Roosevelt greatly modified Hoover's ruling regarding financial sponsorship for refugees thereby allowing a substantially greater number of visas to be issued. As a result, the United States accepted twice as many Jewish refugees than did the rest of the world put together. As Professor Weinberg has stated, Roosevelt acted in the face of strong and politically damaging criticism for what was generally considered a pro-Jewish attitude by him personally and by his Administration.<br>  <br>  Hitler's policy never wavered in trying to force the Jews to leave Germany. After the Anschluss in Austria, Roosevelt, on March 25, 1938, called an international conference on the refugee crisis. Austria's 185,000 Jews were now in jeopardy. The conference met in Evian, France. <br>  <br>  By the end of 1938, Kristallnacht had happened. Its impact on the Jews of Germany and Austria was overwhelming. The German Jews at last understood the barbarism of the Nazis--and that Hitler was totally in power. America's reaction to Kristallnacht was stronger than any of the democracies. Roosevelt recalled his Ambassador from Germany. For the first time since the First World War an American president had summoned home an ambassador to a major power under such circumstances. At his press conference then, Roosevelt said: "I myself can scarcely believe that such things could occur in a 20th century civilization." He extended the visitors' visas of all Germans and Austrians in the United States who felt threatened. The reaction of Americans in opinion polls showed overwhelming anger and disgust with the Nazis and sympathy for the Jews. Roosevelt remained the target of the hardcore anti-Semites in America. He welcomed them as enemies and in brilliant maneuvering, he isolated them from mainstream America and essentially equated their anti-Semitism with treason and the destruction of both the national interest and national defense. Recognizing the inertia, frequent hostility, and sometime anti-Semitism in the State Department, he entrusted Sumner Welles, the Undersecretary of State and a person totally sympathetic to Jewish needs, to be his instrument of action. President Kennedy, a generation later, commented to friends that he would order something to happen at the State Department--and frequently nothing would happen. Roosevelt understood as Kennedy and every President learns that there is a bureaucracy in government that can limit the possibilities of executive action.<br>  <br>  There was an attitude that there were many sanctuaries available in the world besides the United States, so the Department, controlled by an elite and very conservative officialdom, was quite prepared to make Congressional attitudes the guide for their administration of immigration procedures rather than the attitudes of the White House. Congress looked at the turmoil in Germany as a European problem in which it did not want America to be involved. Nevertheless, between 1933 and 1941, 35 percent of all immigrants to America under quota guidelines were Jewish. After Kristallnacht, Jewish immigrants were more than one-half of all immigrants admitted to the U.S. Of course, there were other countries of refuge--many of them preferred by German Jews who--like everyone else did not foresee the Nazi madness of conquest and extermination--and who wanted to stay in Europe. Public opinion everywhere in the democracies was repelled by the Nazi persecution. Great Britain, for example, after Kristallnacht granted immigration visas essentially without limit. In the first six months of 1939, 91,780 German and Austrian Jews were admitted to England, often as a temporary port en route to the Dominions or other parts of the Empire.<br>  <br>  Roosevelt from the beginning saw the larger threat of the Nazis. Hitler wanted to present Germany as the champion of a universal struggle against the Jews. Roosevelt would not let him. The President understood that he had to explain the vital interest that all Americans had in stopping Hitler in terms of their own security, at the same time protecting Jews from being isolated as the sole cause of the inevitable confrontation. He pressured the Europeans to respond to Hitler. His speech in 1937 calling for the quarantine of the aggressors was met with political hostility at home and abroad. He was constantly seeking havens for the refugees in other countries knowing that he did not have the power to change the quota system of our own country. His critics refuse to acknowledge limitations on presidential power but clearly the President could not unilaterally command an increase in quotas. In fact, his Congressional leaders, including Representative Dickstein who chaired the House subcommittee on immigration, warned him that reactionary forces in the Congress might well use any attempt to increase the quotas as an opportunity to reduce them. Faulting FDR for not using his political power to urge changes in immigration laws when he knew he could not win--or worse, that the isolationists would work to reduce the quotas, does not make much sense.<br>  <br>  Seventy-two percent of all German Jews had emigrated before further emigration became impossible with the beginning of the war. Eighty-three percent of all German Jews under 21 emigrated. There are many reasons why the others did not get out--some were too old to leave, some believed it their religious duty to stay, some were in concentration camps and prisons, some just did not know what to do. Emigres were plundered of virtually all of their assets, and not until Jews faced the reality of terrorism and imprisonment were many of them prepared to give up their family's wealth and everything that they had worked for all of their lives.<br>  <br>  The prisoners of Hitler could only be saved by the total, unconditional surrender of Nazi Germany--and that was a task that required four years and the unprecedented mobilization of all of the resources, human and material, of Great Britain, the Soviet Union and the United States.<br>  <br>  The critics of America and President Roosevelt say the news of the annihilation of Europe's Jews was deliberately kept secret so that our people would not know about it--and if Americans had been aware of the Final Solution, they would have insisted on doing more than what was done. They suggest that anti-Semitism in the State Department--or elsewhere or everywhere in our government and in our country--determined that the news of the extermination process be kept secret. That is totally untrue. President Roosevelt, Winston Churchill, General Eisenhower, General Marshall, the intelligence services of the Allied nations, every Jewish leader, the Jewish communities in America, in Britain, in Palestine, and yes, anyone who had a radio or newspaper knew that Jews in colossal numbers were being murdered. They may have received the news with disbelief. There was no precedent for it in human history. But the general information of the genocide was broadly available to anyone who would read or listen. The Riegner telegram in August, 1942, was not even the first knowledge that a Death Camp later to become known as Auschwitz with its gas chambers and ghastly crematoria had been built--but Auschwitz, like every extermination camp, was treated as a top secret project by the Nazis. We publicized what we knew but the Nazis tried to keep as much information as possible away from everybody. As Martin Gilbert points out, the details and even the name of Auschwitz were not confirmed until the escape of two prisoners in April, 1944--two years after its murderous processes had begun. The names, locations and procedures of the death camps may not have been known--some not until the end of the war--but the fact of the genocide and the Nazi determination to carry it out were not in doubt."|`|qDSvOOwBaa	Correct answers but some important points are missing. The Wannsee conference In January 20th 1942 held in that Berlin suburb was the official beginning of the Final Solution. It was headed bySS-Lieutenant General Reinhard Heydrich, Chief of the Security Police and Security Service. Heydrich carefully mastered plan was in part the main reason so many died-and the reason it simply was not believed by so many. Few thought at that time anything as logistically challenging could ever actually be carried out.  <br>  The British have always outclassed everyone in the spooky/spy game of intelligence-especially the Americans-they still do-but their failure to believe the operatives in place cost so many lives that could have been prevented.<br>  Modern day intelligence failures such as 9/11, The Tokyo subway bombings,SS Cole pale in comparison to the blunders by British and American military commands for not believing the spy's they had trained. <br>  Both governments knew of the conference and the plan-they just could not believe the Nazi's were prepared to carry it out. <br>  <br>  They were wrong. <br>  <br>  s_e_s|`|60b0d42c3c92dec6d976704c90ee8eb5aa	It would require a book to source the real beginnings of why the US got involved in WW2...but the Japanese Bombing of Pearl Harbour was the final catalyst.

The activities that fall under the name holocaust began as early as 1933.  The US was informed along the way by news reporters, escapees, and German emigrants.<br>  <br>  The US didn't receive "first hand" information until 1945 when the US Army advanced far enough into Europe o occupy some of the camps.  The Soviets had occupied some of the camps earlier, but most of their reports were discounted.<br>  <br>  I'm not sure what you mean by the president reacting.  The US had been committed to the complete destruction of the German armed forces and the removal of Hitler and the Nazi party before the facts of the holocaust were widely known.  The knowledge of the holocaust had no affect on US policy whatsoever during the course of the war.|`|3QsPl1uLaa	There was never a single date. As you can imagine there was all sorts of information being spread around. Lots of it was not true.Many of the top allied leaders could not believe anything that aweful could happen.  What happened in the death camps was  closely guarded  information. Only a very limited number  of Germans worked there. The camps were very isolated. It was only after the camps were over-run by the allies that the trus extent of the killing was uncovered.|`|Rti4kgreaa	Ah yes, I remember this. World War II. <br>  <br>  Well, he was made chancellor of Germany in 1933. I'm guessing the US was informed of what he was doing around 1936 or 1937, because fo a while they gave in to his demands in order to try to appease him. When Hitler invaded Poland in 1939, however, they realized there WAS no appeasing him . That's when the US jumped in and became part of the war.<br>  <br>  I'm a freshman in college, by the way.

mzRSO802aa	Generally speaking more female babies are born than male and there are usually 5% to 8% more women in the world than men.  If you mean quantities of people then women would be dominate.  There has generally always been more women than men in the world.

SKCu5wigaa	To understand the relevance of the storming of the Bastille, first you must have some background knowledge as to what was occurring in France at that time.  In 1774 Louis XVI and Marie Antoinette assumed their roles as the chief monarchs of the country. Marie was nicknamed "Madame Deficit" by the citizens because her lavish spending on jewelry (The Diamond Necklace Affair), gold, etc. caused France to enter an economic depression. The average citizen(lower class made up around 98% of the population, the other 2% comprised of nobility and royalty) consumed approx. 2 pounds of bread per day; due to this, bread riots and the stockpiling of flour became increasingly popular and eventually declared illegal. The monarchs are the main reason behind the storming of the Bastille, though not the only one(I'm not going to elaborate on the others--you get the idea). Tired of the lack of food and seeing the demise of their country, the citizens of Paris took it upon themselves to fix things. On 14 July 1789 the storming of the Bastille occurred. Though the main purpose of the Bastille was to serve as a prison, gunpowder and other arms were being stored there as well. At the time of the storming, Bernard de Launay was the commander of the garrison stationed at the Bastille. Seizing these weapons, the citizens of Paris then dragged de Launay and his soldiers through Paris. He was supposed to be escorted to the Hotel de Ville(not the kind of Hotel you're probably thinking of, this is an administration building) by Pierre-Augustin Hulin, but he was assaulted by crowd on the way there. The angered citizens beat him, stabbed him with their bayonets, shot him, and then lynched him along with other soldiers that were at the Bastille. His head was then sawed off by Mathieu Jouve Jourdan, fixed to a pike, and paraded through the streets by the crowd. The citizens stormed the Bastille to show their anger towards King Louis, to show that they were capable of revolt. Though it is only one of many events that led up to the French Revolution, which occured from 1789-1799, it paved the way for other important events such as the women's March of Versailles, Reign of Terror, Marat's assassination, etc., to occur. Personally, i find the French Revolution to be quite interesting.

j5Apt8hWaa	1) make sure you are using your camera set at its highest resolution.  2) make sure you have your white balance set correctly  3) if you are shooting in mixed lighting, you will either have to shoot using RAW+JPEG (you can do your rough edit (sort) using JPEG before processing the RAW image files) or shoot at night and light only using light sources of one kind (flash or incandescent) and/or "paint with light" to fill in the shadow areas    Shooting interior architectural shots is a rather advanced process.  Most architectural photographers use incident light meters to meter all the important features of the shot and then light as necessary ... I have used up to 20 different lamps with various light modifiers to correctly light the insides of buildings.  When I used to use a 4x5 view camera, the exposures could be as long as 20 minutes, while my assistant, dressed in black, danced around adding light to various dark corners to get an even exposure.    As you can see, shooting interiors is not a matter of "press the shutter and let Kodak do the rest".  It is very much like dodging and burning ... a skill learned in the darkroom when taking classes in traditional photography.

shVgCizBaa	Is Hitler still popular in Germany?  We hear about how bad he is here but does he have the same status as Lincoln or anyone like our presidents?No -----------Read this link  http://www.spiegel.de/international/0,15...         ------------Excerps:Why Germans Can Never Escape Hitler's Shadow The message of the debate is clear: For us Germans, whether we like it or not, the past is always present. One only has to take a look at a German bookshop these days. The shelves are overflowing with new publications on every imaginable aspect of the Nazi period. Newspapers and TV channels are running dozens of documentaries on World War II. The conflict cost about 60 million lives and obviously it still haunts us. Only in the 1960s, did rebellious teenagers like me start to question their parents and grandparents: What were you doing between 1933 and 1945? What did you know about the killing of the Jews? We did not accept the collective amnesia regarding the Nazi crimes. We also refused to buy the popular legend of an evil demon called Hitler who single-handedly seduced and betrayed an innocent German people who knew nothing about the atrocities the Wehrmacht and the SS committed.     In the 1970s, young teachers introduced the Nazi period into the school curriculum and historians began more intensely documenting and researching the rise of the Nazis. The American TV series "Holocaust" also had a strong impact. Then, on May 8, 1985, President Richard von Weizsaecker -- once a Wehrmacht officer -- gave a historical speech to the German parliament in which he declared the day the "Deutsche Reich" submitted to an unconditional capitulation a "Tag der Befreiung," a "day of liberation" for Germans.And unfortunately, on the fringes of German society -- particularly in the impoverished former East Germany -- anti-Semitism and neo-Nazism still exist and at the moment seem to be thriving. Last year, neo-Nazi parties won parliamentary seats in two German states and party heads have unabashedly declared their desire to win federal representation in 2006 elections. It is hard to understand how such self-declared nationalists can actually defend Hitler -- a fanatic who transformed Germany into an immoral police state and ultimately brought the nation to its knees and forced it to bear decades of occupation. Still, they do and this shows that even now, the debate on the Nazi period is not always terribly rational. The past is present    As a boy I loved to play in bombed out villas in Berlin and even today when I look out of my kitchen window I can still see a house with a bombed-out back wing where tiles from blasted-out bathrooms still stick on the wall. This house is certainly an anomaly, as most of Berlin has been rebuilt. But it will take many more years until all traces of the past completely disappear.     Meanwhile, my 11-year-old son has started to ask me about the Nazis. While we were living in London, his schoolmates sometimes greeted him mockingly with a "Heil Hitler." Although he was born almost 50 years after the "Fuehrer" shot himself in his bunker, he, too, can't escape history. That is not something I regret. http://www.spiegel.de/international/0,15...|`|kacLYFrHaa	For the most part absolutely not. In recent years  (can't remember if it was last year or 2007) there's been a news story about a recall of wooden Santa souvenir statues in Germany because they were felt to look too much like Hitler. The German government cracks down heavily on anything to do with him and only allows limited material to pass as long as it deals with him in historical content and does not paint him in any kind of a heroic or nobel light.    However, there are some in Germany just as there are here who would like upon him much like folks here might look upon Lincoln. These folks are Neo-Nazis which are supposed to be illegal in Germany. Which means there are actually more Neo-Nazis here than there are in Germany.|`|nE5eqyWeaa	No. Try to do some research.|`|u4LLFhORaa	no don't even mention his name there  you might get killed  hitler is the most hated person ever in germany  hell no not any where like lincoln this country loved lincoln hitler is not liked at all they hate him|`|DhYEudj7aa	Are you serious?

If you are mildly interested in Chinese mythology stuff you can read the dragon stories by Laurence Yep as well.|`|8asG4WCwaa	Dragon Riders of Pern series by Anne McCaffrey has over 20 books to read :-)  My daughter has exhausted her allowance on them lol    http://www.fantasyliterature.net/mccaffr...

So if I were in the market for a new violin, I would personally go to a reputable brick-n-mortar violin shop to try out instruments in person.     Having said that, I've heard nothing but good things about Shar Music, so if I *were* going to buy a violin over the Internet, I would consider buying from them.

One thing you might wanna keep in mind is that, This is something you would really really love to be, Because being good looking enough will not guarantee that you will succeed in the modeling world. It's a lots of hard work and rejection that you will have to face before you can amount to something. Being said that, Good Luck
w7USF5wDaa	I've found a couple actually, unfortunately they were not books that I actually wanted to read to I left them for someone else to find.  One I found in a phone booth outside a restaurant and the other was in the lobby of a hospital on the table with the magazines.  <br>  <br>  I think your ideas are all good.  I think the more unusual the place the better because then even if people don't know about Bookcrossing they still might take the book because it's obvious that someone purposely left it there, it wasn't left accidentally by someone who may be back any moment to retrieve it.<br>  <br>  Cheers.

In a romance there is a clear and concise form.  Boy meets girl or girl meets boy.  They either like each other right off or they can't stand each other.  Something comes up that puts them farther apart (if they like each other whether emotionally, physically or mentally) or something throws them together (if they are at odds already so they have a chance to get to know each other then something outside of them comes up).  In the end they have to resolve the issue to come together.  Simple.<br>  ---  When I started writing I had a character who was wholly unto herself.  I knew what she looked like, how she dressed, then where she worked, what her life was like.  Each day more and more of her personality came to me.  Almost a quarter way into writing she finally meets the 'hero' of the novel.  That is considered a long time but for me she was the important element.<br>  ---  The more time they had together or apart I began to get a feel for him, the type of guy she imagined she would end up with and how different from that he was.  Her own prejudices kept her from being with him right off.  The plot, climax and all that came as I built the story from these two people.  I had no ending in mind except that I hoped they ended up together.  The story picked up momentum and before it was published I had about 200 pages that had to be ripped out of the original manuscript.  After nearly seven years of writing it was incredibly long.<br>  ---  I write not because I expected to be published or because I had a particular story to tell or the perfect plot or even the perfect novel.  What I told was a story of a stronger more unique version of who I am or at least imagine I want to be.  The fun part was I could be so many things and have the perfect guy in the perfect setting but even in romances there is no perfect and even that was fun.<br>  <br>  ---  Give yourself time.  Take on other writing challenges while you wait to hone your craft and skill.  In public shool I joined the 'storytelling contest' and won, then I worked on my High School yearbook, newspaper and literary magazine.  I wrote stage plays while in college, then a television script then a movie script in addition to my thesis paper.  I joined Forensic speaking team (which isn't debate but public speaking, poetry, philosophy, speeches etc.) then I worked as an intern with a music public relations firm writing publicity announcements for entertainers.  I did resume writing and then speech writing, I learned how to ghostwrite and then did handheld camera work for awhile.<br>  ---  All of those experiences helped me to perfect my writing and my style and find my 'voice'.  I also think I was passionate about finding someone when I began writing and since I couldn't I created the romance I wanted.  <br>  ---  Every piece of writing has a formula.  A structure in which to write in.  Learn the structure, stay within it and if you have the skills to write well your story will take you outside of the format and allow you to stay with the theory of writing.  Write well.|`|pfU1dCAaaa	Yes, I have one.....<br>  <br>  An is only used before a word beginning with a vowel... so... don't use "an novel" for one!! :D:D:D lol... anyway.... I like anything to do with heartbreak! :D:D|`|ZuWD3SVfaa	If you ar finding yourself in a bit of a block I have been there done that, just try writing anything and everything. Carry a notebook around with you and write down anything that you see or notice. Sometimes just sitting there writing about nothing can help you out.<br>  Only you know what you are good at writing about and where you can take things, just try and relax and just let whatever comes to mind come out, I have 100's of note books filled with random lines I like to a few paragraphs of utter rubbish.|`|67f7a9562eea0008ccdd2892a04062f7aa	Welll, I don't really have the answer myself......<br>  <br>  All I can tell you is to just pay attention to your everyday life, and take notes when something strikes you. Sooner or later, the little pilot light in your head will re-light itself, just as soon as somone says, or does something, or you see something that triggers it. <br>  <br>  I'm working on a new idea myself, and running into the same problem. It's difficult to come up with something good that hasn't already been done.<br>  <br>  Keep working on it and be patient. It'll happen when it's time.<br>  <br>  Good Luck
9Zfk1neoaa	could be, but then formation of a shadow requires an object to be there. so you can see which you should not. conclusions cannot be seen but they are drawn and painted form the images.|`|juG7X5gyaa	Could it be that we don't exist at any time except when someone acknowledges us?  Could it be that we are in the WRONG dimension, and other's are in the right one?  Who knows!|`|pDptioSNaa	Or, maybe.... we clearly see the exact truth, find it unpalatable, and cover it up with philo blah.|`|459MOxHfaa	Its possible that we cannot view the world for what it really is. <br>  <br>  Platos cave anyone?|`|eezP5wQ2aa	...being confident and responsible for all my choices and actions in life...NO...|`|Up6ANLQeaa	It could well be....
