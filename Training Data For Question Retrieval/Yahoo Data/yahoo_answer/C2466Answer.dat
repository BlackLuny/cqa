4RQh0kXlaa	Well if you're looking at cost, I think guitar might be cheapest. In my experience, a beginner guitar is cheaper than a violin or cello. <br>  Difficulty-wise, I play guitar and viola, and used to play a little cello, and I found guitar was easiest to pick up. <br>  <br>  As for lessons, guitar is probably harder to find lessons for because since it's so common, a lot of people pretend to know what they're talking about and teach it when they shouldn't. Violin and cello are usually a bit more professional, but also more expensive. For choosing a good teacher, for guitar I'd go to a store and see if there is any sort of board, and you can get employee recommendation. Same with violin and cello. At the violin store I go to, there's a big board with lots of cards for lessons. You can call up the teachers and find out how long they've been playing, how qualified, etc.<br>  <br>  Hope this helped and good luck! :)|`|b5wIdYHMaa	Learning how to play the guitar is a great thing to do, however finding somewhere decent to learn it is difficult as reading mags and tabs will only go so far.

4659cbae6885038116d1989320b6a54faa	Do you mean where it was printed/published?<br>  <br>  I think they only show country of origin now-a-days.<br>  <br>  _
VltYJmqZaa	Ha ha : ).  Everyone has their own likes and dislikes, so I don't think it really matters that much = ).  But here's what I think....<br>  <br>  Well, I do what you mean about the under-developed characters.  It's obvious that Meyers put a lot more effort into her characters' physical features than into their motives and personalities.  The plot is pretty basic too ~ girl falls in love with vampire in neighborhood.  There's not much else.  On the otherhand, not everyone wants to read a psychological thriller.  <br>  <br>  I read the first Twilight book and liked it.  I normally hate romances and I prefer strong female characters (I personally do not consider Bella to be a strong character), but I loved Meyer's descriptive writing and her whole vampire theme was cool.  I don't like everything about the book, but it's something light-hearted to pick up on a rainy day.  The movie was good too and had a lot of humor in it, at least I thought it did.<br>  <br>  Please stop trying to stir up trouble : ).  Just respect peoples' opinions and politely listen to their ideas.  I personally found it extremely interesting how you said the books were anti-feminist ~ it's something I haven't considered before.  You have a lot of good points, just try to express yourself in a way that won't turn things into such a heated discussion.|`|iRRjCPWaaa	i think that the reason most people like it is because they feal like either<br>  A. they can realate to the main charector<br>  or<br>  B. They want to live the life of the main charector<br>  <br>  I personaly like it, but thats just because i like anything at all about vampires. So when this book came out i happily read it. its probably my least favorite vampire book (im using my friends email in case you can see what her email is lol) but i do think most people are only reading it because its popular and because they are jelous of bella|`|86oPkfzOaa	I don't know why it's popular, but really I do like it.

cxDbdhELaa	Let's face it, philosophy does not warrant subcategories because it does not receive enough traffic.|`|yOK32PM9aa	Good question.  I suspect that it is due to the fact that academic ethics - the philosophy of morality - is distinct from the form of applied practical ethics which sits more comfortably with Law.  And rightly or wrongly most people tend to have more contact and see more value in the latter conception.|`|d76540548b78851b2b0db3441e66ae54aa	It may be because Y!A isn't well organized, among other things. You're right about politics and government not being ethical.|`|AA11488628	because ethics and philosophy are not the same thing. and ethics should be in it's own category. ethics are pretty much right and wrong past the point that the law sees it. everything else is just personal principles.|`|HORACAnlaa	Agreed but why doesn't have YA have subsections for all the branches of philosophy? I would imagine they don't feel there is a demand for it. They could be wrong but since we all pay nothing for this service I'll go with their decision.|`|d7c8ecd624fbbc0797b1502ba6682e8baa	You can. There just isn't a special category. There is just philosophy. While they could have Philosophy>Ontology, Philosophy>Epistemology, Philosophy> Ethics, etc., there just aren't enough questions asked in this category to make the screen move very fast as it is. <br>  <br>  Politics is generally defined as the institutionalization of ethics. While I agree it is not, and has generally become merely a system for pushing economic interests, that is what it's supposed to be. Maybe that's the kind of question needed in the Politics section; Why has politics become about economics instead of ethics, it's original purpose?|`|y8bFwXZEaa	Bigcherr is wrong. Ethics is the 3rd branch of philosophy, politics being the 4th. Ethics is not "beyond" the law; the law is codified ethics.<br>  <br>  But ethics under philosophy requires an understanding of metaphysics and epistemology, the first 2 branches.<br>  <br>  Ethics under law does not require either, necessarily, at least not for an answer.|`|dlGP3iZ6aa	The problem is that we can add an infinite number of subcategories to any of the subcategories.  We can add to "philosophy" the subcategories "ethics", "epistemology", "metaphysics", etc.  By doing this, though, anyone with an interest in philosophy would have to look up three or more categories just find questions that they might be able to answer.  By having "philosophy" as the final subcategory, we ensure that anyone with an interest in philosophy will be able to find questions that appeal to them under a single sub-category.  Perhaps if we had an philosophy-only "Answers" website, we could have subcategories, but it doesn't make sense to do it on a website like this, when most people (let's be honest) that visit here aren't really all that familiar with the different branches of philosophy that exist.<br>  <br>  As a student of philosophy, I'm perfectly happy, and relieved, that there is only a single philosophy category on this site.  Honestly, we're lucky there is a website like this were the public can ask philosophical questions and learn things from those who are well-versed in the discipline.<br>  <br>  It is also true that some questions can fit under more than one category.  I agree that it should be possible to cross-list a question under more than one category.  <br>  <br>  Cheers.

ceBTTCPwaa	"That Evening Sun" is a short story by the American author William Faulkner, published in 1931 on the collection These 13, which included Faulkner's most anthologized story, "A Rose for Emily." "That Evening Sun" is a dark portrait of white Southerners' indifference to the crippling fears of one of their African-American employees, Nancy. The story is narrated by Quentin Compson, one of Faulkner's most memorable characters, and concerns the reactions of him and his two siblings, Caddy and Jason, to an adult world that they do not fully understand. The African-American washerwoman, Nancy, fears that her common-law husband Jesus is seeking to murder her because she is pregnant with a white man's child. The title is taken from a blues song by William Christopher Handy, although there is no mention of this in the story.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.bookrags.com/That_Evening_Sun" rel="nofollow">http://www.bookrags.com/That_Evening_Sun</a> : Includes That Evening Sun summary, character analysis, themes, style, historical context, critical overview, essays, media adaptations, compare and contrast, topics for further study, and sources.
ceBTTCPwaa	"Babylon Revisited" is a short story by F. Scott Fitzgerald, first published in the The Saturday Evening Post on February 21, 1931, and had many parallels to Fitzgerald's own life, both personal and historical. “Babylon Revisited” is widely considered to be the apex of F. Scott Fitzgerald’s short stories, of which there are more than a hundred. It was later adapted into a movie called The Last Time I Saw Paris.<br>  <br>  "Family quarrels are bitter things. They don't go according to any rules. They're not like aches or wounds; they're more like splits in the skin that won't heal because there's not enough material."<br>  <br>  In “Babylon Revisited” Fitzgerald explores the experiences of scarcity and abundance, primarily in Charlie’s ordeals after the crash which are juxtaposed with his memories of life during the boom. Charlie’s suggestion that there is not “enough material” to bridge the gap that has developed between himself and Marion parallels his experience of emotional and spiritual scarcity during the boom. Now, during the depression, although Charlie is doing well financially, he has lost is wife and his daughter. He believes that Marion’s lack of compassion, and perhaps understanding, for him that prevents her from being able to heal their rift. If there were just more love and tolerance between them, he implies, they could reconcile, and the custody of Honoria would not be an issue. Marion is described as cold and angry, and it is clear that Charlie believes that it is this scarcity of warmth and compassion on her part that is to blame for his problems. However, the imagery of a split in the skin that is unable to heal implies scarcity on both sides, and Charlie is unable to see this.<br>  <br>  "I heard that you lost a lot in the crash." "I did," and he added grimly, "but I lost everything I wanted in the boom." "Selling short." "Something like that."<br>  <br>  This conversation between Paul the barman and Charlie serves as a double entendre, representing both the economic and emotional loss that Charlie experienced during the late 1920’s. Paul is speaking merely in economic terms, but Charlie is not—their conversation exists in parallel, and while Charlie understands Paul’s meaning, it is clear that Paul does not grasp what Charlie is referring to. The period before the stock market crash was incredibly prosperous, even for working men like Paul. Paul’s ideas of loss center solely around finances, and the only possible loss he can imagine would be due to the riskiest form of stock trading, namely, short selling. For Charlie, however, the loss he refers to is not financial, it is the emotional burden he bears from the death of his wife and the loss of his daughter. These tragic events occur near the end of the boom, and consume Charlie in a way that his monetary losses do not. For Charlie has been able to recover from his financial defeats, but is still searching for a solution to his spiritual and familial mistakes.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Babylon_Revisited" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Babylon_Rev...</a><br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.bookrags.com/Babylon_Revisited" rel="nofollow">http://www.bookrags.com/Babylon_Revisite...</a> : Includes Babylon Revisited summary, character analysis, themes, style, historical context, critical overview, essays, media adaptations, compare and contrast, topics for further study, and sources.
GqJVk2kYaa	Sounds like a terrible book
AA10515207	Regardless of the genre the character has to be believable. If she's action oriented, you wouldn't have her swoon if a good looking guy asked her out. She should be someone the reader can identify w/--the qualities of a Boy Scout (I know--wrong gender, but you'll see my point)that are admirable, but she needs a fatal flaw--sarcastic, speaks w/o thinking, rescuer of tiny kittens. The female reader should want to BE her. Gets along w/ the guys, but isn't slutty. Should have a core group of friends. I always get a kick when the strong female character caves before a doting mother. You know the kind--phone calls @ inopportune times, drops in w/ casseroles, has a key to her daughter's place & lets herself in to clean or cook. Oh, some love interest, but no wild love scenes where their tongues tickle each other's tonsils.

GywOmWfIaa	I believe that you can learn all you need to know about writing from just a few books if you have the talent to do so already at your fingertips.  If you are interested in writing screenplays, I would take a look at the material Syd Field has published.  He also has a video that walks you through the basic three Act structure.  After that, it's really just a matter of getting the terminology and structure down.  You would do well to purchase a copy of Final Draft or similar software as it makes the formatting chore much easier.<br>  <br>  That said, and hopefully no offense taken here, but I would like to point out there are several grammatical errors in your question above.  You can't always rely on a spellchecker so it couldn't hurt you to pick up a copy of Strunk & White's before embarking headlong into writing.|`|xixgmkGVaa	Well, yes. Try, if you're in high school, creative writing. And try paying attention in English class. My thought to you is good luck with what you're doing. Personally i don't want to make scripts, because they're harder to construct. I prefer writing plain ol' stories.|`|77fd84059103615e02f6df19b4f87772aa	Want to know the best way to become a writer? Read and write. Classes can help, but they wont make you a good writer, just like reading alone won't automatically make you Stephen King. <br>  <br>  Just read and write, and you'll get better. Trust me. ^_^

ugiUyhOwaa	When you say metaphor, it is a direct comparison between two different objects but connected with a same characteristic. Maybe it is a personification because love was given there a pair of eyes, which only belongs to animated objects (except plants).<br>  <br>  Hope I helped!|`|Y1wsj6Liaa	i don't think so<br>  <br>  i think metaphors compare the literal thing mentioned in the poem with something else kind of. sorry bad explanation.<br>  <br>  i don't really see a comparison here though, like at all...|`|AdE3qInBaa	No i think that is personification because it gives an object a human trait.

a9wRfuuSaa	You might like Dean Koontz, who writes similar to King, but not with as much horror. He also writes across a lot of different genres including supernatural, sci-fi, thrillers, horror and usually includes good doses of humor.<br>  <br>  I would also recommend the books of Thomas Harris, particularly Silence of the Lambs. The book is at least as good as the movie, if not better, so if you enjoyed the movie, then read the book<br>  <br>  If you like Grisham, you might also enjoy many of the books of James Patterson, such as the Alex Cross series, the Women's Murder Club, Where the Wind Blows, The Jester and many more. <br>  <br>  You should also read some of Michael Crichton's books, particularly Jurassic Park, Timeline and Prey. <br>  <br>  You might also like books by Nelson DeMille, Steve Berry and Dan Brown.|`|AA10515207	I highly recommend Richard North Patterson (The Exile--about an American lawyer who defends a former lover who is Muslim & is accused of assassinating a high-ranking Israeli official visiting San Francisco. Great explanations of the conflict in the Middle East. Also, The Race about an American presidential race).<br>  <br>  Douglas Preston & Lincoln Childs. Stephen King has nothing on these two co-authors. Their books w/ FBI Special Agent Teddy Pendergast are great. Read The Relic first. They made it into a movie, but it didn't do the book justice.<br>  <br>  Daniel Silva 's books involve espionage & art. The main character is Gabriel Allon who is an art restorer, but does intelligence work for the Israelis. Almost all his books have international settings. I can only remember 2 titles: The Confessor & A Death in Venice.<br>  <br>  For medical thrillers/mysteries avoid Patricia Cornwell but do read Kathy Reichs. Her character Temperance Brennan is a forensic investigator dividing her time between Charlotte NC & Montreal. Unlike Cornwell Reichs has the real credentials. Three of her books are Death du Jour, Bones to Ashes, & Devil bones.<br>  <br>  Sorry I can't give you any suggestions about poetry. I think it's great you're starting your own library.

Their affair is illegal, erotic, passionate and dangerous – a vicious meeting of minds and bodies. But when Mr Carr’s wife discovers the affair he has to choose between them and moves to another city with his family.<br>  Sarah is devastated and from that day on her life is defined by a series of meaningless, self-abasing sexual encounters, hoping with each man that she will experience the same delicious feelings she had with Mr Carr.

DrY7Volbaa	Have you ever thought that maybe your talent has nothing to do with acting or singing or being "famous"? Maybe your talent refers to the way you listen to your friends when they need it, or the way you tell jokes, or baking cookies, or anything else that to you seems totally unimportant and uninteresting, but for the rest of the world might be the most unique and special ability?<br>  I know you're probably influenced by the media and/or peers, especially at this age and have a different view that I do. But trust me, being an actress or a singer has nothing special nowadays( unless you want to be an opera singer, which I doubt). If you insist, you can do what many Romanian "singers" do: playback. But is it worth it?<br>  I say you do exactly what you feel attracted to at the moment and stop worrying about being "talented" or not. You're still very young and, fortunately or maybe not, real talent is not something you create, you must be born with it.
AA11635601	Unless the fire is in the books already, you should be able to extinguish it without wetting the books.  But assume you can't.  Then you have three choices.

That said, experienced firefighters woudl hit the fire and not the books, unless it was the books themselves that were on fire.<br>  <br>  It doesn't take much water to put out a fire - rookies fill a swimming pool, but experienceds use short bursts, like an assault rifle set for three round bursts.|`|1e4622c41080edcef755ae0f3f517e48aa	The options you present are using the hose which will probably destroy the books, or do nothing which will probably allow them to be destroyed by fire.

AA11114869	Many times I have asked myself such questions and I've never been able to answer them to my own satisfaction.  <br>  And now today, on my birthday, I find that I am compelled to consider  them yet again...<br>  <br>  Perhaps my ongoing uncertainty with these questions lies in my view that, as far as the 'meaning of Life' is concerned, - no one really knows anything about it,... and no one ever will, - or maybe it just lies in  that having no answer to them is what allows me to finally close my eyes at night, - and sleep.<br>  <br>  That said, 'bosbannen', I must tell you that I do have those nights...<br>  ... when I am awakened by sounds and images recalled from my past, - those which I can now only hear and see in my nightmares.<br>  It is on those nights that I will just lie awake for a while,... sometimes for a very long while, - wondering whether or not I was justified in my past actions, - wondering if I am, or ever was, a good man, - wondering if either is even possible.<br>  <br>  However, the thought that usually allows me finally go back to sleep is this:<br>  ---...If I have a soul then it IS what I've already made of it...--<br>  <br>  In this,... I do not believe there is a God and, by default, I believe I have no soul.  If this is true then I guess I lucked out; so be it...<br>  If there is, however unlikely, a God, - then I am surely Hellbound, as I do not believe the actions of my Life would qualify my allowance into Heaven.<br>  <br>  So, to any atheists who may read this:<br>  I hope that you're right...;-)<br>  <br>  And to the many theists out there who may read this:<br>  Though I don't cleave to the notion of there being a God I would, nonetheless, gladly accept a kind thought on behalf of a damned soul;...<br>  ... not so much that it might be allowed entrance into Heaven, as I'd never ask for that which I have not earned.<br>  Pray, instead, that I may face my Judgment quickly,...<br>  ... so that I might have some strength left at that moment when I must take my rightful place - in Hell.<br>  -|`|FoIxsunVaa	Open any coffin and get the real deal.|`|2hAuIg5baa	we become worm and maggot poop!|`|AA11488628	ok so we have  soul. it is our energy force. when we die this energy force is released and then jumps the plains of existence into another plain. which one it is drawn to depends on what your life and you decisions have done to it. it would put it on a different frequency if you are going to heaven or to hell. there is also those souls who are earth bound who do not leave this plain because they fear what will happen to them. they are not strong enough to jump plains or are angry enough to force not going. <br>  all of this is based on scientific facts along with my personal religious feelings. i do think that you can come back again to have a second chance or even a 100th chance but that it is a gift given by God. when we die we forget all that had came before. we return to the original life (energy)  force that i call God. and yes i do go to church occasionally and no it is not some nut church it is just your run of the mill non denominational church with the Bible and all that. i just do not believe that all of the other religions can be entirely wrong they share so much in their beliefs and faith that really i just think most of the differences are cultural not religious.  we could all get along about that if we wanted to.|`|d0945a07b59dce3ca7393bc610216aa9aa	I'll be back this way again.

lvyEnAtAaa	First, they are not socially more advanced.  Their society is openly racist.  All non Japanese are gaijin, and openly sneered at in ways that would shame any American.  They are sexist as well to a degree that indicates their moral backwardness.<br>  <br>  As for their technical base, it was rebuilt for them by the Allies after we were forced to bomb them flat to get a peace.  To their credit, they have not allowed their corporate infrastructure to decay the way American capitalists have.  As a consequence their plants are up to date and their production is superior.<br>  <br>  Now for the argument that the USA "won the war".  I am sorry, but we did not.  The Allies won the war collectively, and we were a major player.  Nonetheless, we did not join the struggle until the war had been two years fighting.  Canada, Great Britain and the Soviets fought longer and equally as hard.<br>  <br>  We didn't win because of superior technology.  We won because we were not alone.  The entire world eventually was required to put down the aggressive work of three nations.  We did have much superior tech, but we won on numbers.<br>  <br>  That is something we should remember when some fool starts talking about America going it alone.  Those who do that find themselves on the losing side.|`|xQwU590Laa	The US has better technology... it just does not have the manufactoring abiltiy it use to have.

No nation has ever done this after a war before.<br>  <br>  But your premise is flawed.  Japan does a lot of things well.  They embrace new technology.  But almost all of the technology that is so evident in Japan was invented in the US.  <br>  <br>  What has been the main factor in Japan's progress is the close relationship between the government and industry.  Goals are set and strategy is followed, and the results are evident.  BUT, there is a big downside.  Innovation is virtually non-existent in Japan, and their economy has been stagnant for years.|`|qDSvOOwBaa	I would agree with Candy's answer and also point out that their schools are far, far superior in practically every way.

65a553e7501b92ac04dd8ce788c6fe5caa	It almost seems as though you have two separate stories here, Chris's and Sam's. The biggest question is how do they know each other. For example, did they attend the same school? How long did they know one another? Is Chris aware of Sam's situation, and if so, how does she know? Perhaps the biggest question is why Chris cares so much about Sam? Is he the little brother that she wishes she had?<br>  <br>  I think that once you explain how they know each other and why Chris would care so much about Sam, you have the beginnings of a great plot.|`|GFzDwIk6aa	Firstly, I'd advise you make the characters a bit closer to your age.

If you are still short on ideas, check around the web for forums your readers would like.

Om7OhWRUaa	I think you underestimate the importance of having something to legitimize our morality. If it is merely a practical set of rules for preserving the species, and has no trace of transcendental authority, I fear how people will behave when they find out.<br>  <br>  I'm not a believer myself, but I think that it's facile to say that religion is simply bad. Religion is a manifestation of man's desire for meaning in his life. When you take that away, what is he left with? And please don't tell me that we should "make our own meaning", because people have no idea what they're talking about when they say that - if there really is no objective meaning to existence as a whole, what is the significance of any "meaning" made up by one person? It is at best a pretty delusion. Unfortunately, that seems to be what people want nowadays.|`|AA12280291	I am in total agreement with you about this...the Ten Commandments aren't commandments at all...They were meant to show us that since we are made in the likeness of God, then when we BECOME more Committed to NOT committing adultery, or stealing, or lying, etc., then we are becoming more Christ-like...<br>  But, yes I agree with you, religion has ruined alot of people's thinking and convictions.|`|2guyJOWJaa	There's alot more, for you logical-limited minds, "evidence" God exists then the Divine Command Theory, the Resurrection of Jesus Christ being the biggest one, which has also been proven by yes athiests to have been real.<br>  <br>  <br>  And what your asking, to "grow out of" religion, will not move us forward, infact it will do the opposite,...we are already falling in morals now and religions are still heavily used, though slowly decreasing. If you took religion out of the picture, it would end everything. Life is balanced between a force of Good and Evil, Light and Dark, Right and Wrong, however you choose to interpret it, if you take out one, we fall out of balance and go into complete chaos. Think the world is bad now? Take the Good out of life and see how bad it gets then.<br>  <br>  <br>  Point is life is a journey for all of us, on this journey many obstacles are placed in our wayto prebent us from making it to the end. Your purpose is to make it past these obstacles, whether you choose to take the Right way or the Easy way, is on you, but let the rest of the world make their own choice.<br>  <br>  So no, I do not agree, whats holding us back is those who limit themselves and God to only what they can comprehend, to just what they can see, not what actually exists, but in the end, those who have faith are not afraid of the next life, its the ones who do not believe that fear death|`|d265DZbHaa	Bit by bit people of all religions will have to be educated to survive in the modern world.

zcxOK5u0aa	"School of Athens", also known as "Philosophy", is a fresco created in 1509-11 in the Stanza della Segnatura at the Vatican.  It is viewed through a "trompe l'oeil" (literally, a trick of the eye) arch in which one sees Aristotle and Plato.  The latter holds his book "Timaeus", and seems to be focusing to heaven as his philosophical muse.  <br>  <br>  Apollo, the god of sunlight, music and poetry, is one of the figures in the wall niche as in Minerva, the goddess of wisdom.  The two philosophers are surrounded by other thinkers of the day - mathmeticians, geographers, astronomers - who, with Aristotle and Plato, are debating and honing their philosophies.

saYkDVGlaa	Your lighting setup will not give you this image.  You can see by the catch lights in the eyes, the photographer used two light sources and from the shape, I would guess used soft boxes.  The even light across the image is a result of this.  The hand seems more blown out because it's simply closer to the light source than the face.  The solid black could have been enhanced in photoshop, but, I'm betting it was because the subject was close to it and the broad lighting did not have the distance to fall off resulting in a more gray tone.  A setup that may give you something like this, place your lighting directly below your lens, and then use your camera flash on a high power setting.  This could give you the dual direction lighting, eliminating facial shadows even if it is vertical instead of horizontal.|`|LVpyaf48aa	from the shadows on the left side of the face and the blown out whites on the hand holding the camera it looks like it was done with one or two lights just to the left of the camera. no soft box or umbrella. use a snoot or barn doors to limit light falling on the background.<br>  <br>  and yes... photoshop helps!

AA11898755	whew....Mexico is not one of the most stable places to get a dancing gig. The major resort cities are safer, travel outside of them is not wise. Never go ANYWHERE without a group (no less than 4 for sure). Kidnapping is a common means of raising cash. Drug cartels are increasingly in control of seaside resorts - Cancun, Playa Maya, etc -capable of blackmailing police chiefs and security heads, and worse in the inland cities. Frankly, as a parent I'd want to know first that there was no other place my child could have "a wonderful opportunity" without the threat of beheading! Sorry not to be comforting...but its a real threat.<br>  Is the company providing the entertainers a US company? Who provides the security and acts as chaperone?

That does not mean that the qualities of life, which are not seen, just felt in their actions, are unbelievable. On the other hand, there is a teaching that encompasses both believing, and not believing, and both seeing and not seeing. I have translated it into functional language in the LDK.<br>  Life Decryption Key<br>  Short Version<br>  By Generalist 02-09<br>  <br>   Life often looks like a secret puzzle or an encrypted message, especially when we are facing problems. We need to decrypt the message and make some decisions.<br>  The first is to decide if we want to control our lives, or want to rely on an outside force. The second is whether we believe that causes produce effects.<br>  <br>  The question naturally occurs, “What are the right causes to optimize life for oneself and others?” The causes must be one’s decisions based on clarity, That means dumping the guesses and agendas and focusing on what is verifiably pragmatic<br>  <br>  Please write down all the words of intangibles that attach to life such as love, imagination, dreams, life, hope, fear, hate etc. Then write down all the words that relate to the tangible aspects of life. The list of tangibles and intangibles is endless in English. However, the inseparability of tangible and intangible aspects is summed up in the Japanese words Myoho.  Why use Japanese words? The concept originated in Japan and can’t be expressed so succinctly in another language.<br>  <br>  Write down all the words for causes you can think of and effects those causes can have. They are all summed up in the words Renge-Causes simultaneously produce effects like the flower and the seed of the lotus.<br>  <br>  Everything is always changing. Write down all the words that come to mind about things changing-Clouds, faces, butterflies, concepts, memories and on and on. They are all summed up in the Japanese word Kyo. Because everything is always changing, no one is stuck where shehe is. <br>  <br>  <br>  The three words Myoho Renge Kyo include every aspect of life and exclude nothing. <br>  <br>  This formulation, used with focused intention, serves as a life decryption key to enable anyone to see the relationships that exist between good concepts and harmful ones<br>  The way to use it is to add the shortened Sanskrit verb for focusing intention and create Nam Myoho Renge Kyo. This is spoken repeatedly with the palms pressed together to close the energy circle and focuses the mind-brain-body on the essential realities. It releases delusions and limitations as reliably as vitamin C cures scurvy.<br>  <br>  Since we each have our unique paths and desires, there is no prescription for what people should focus on when they use the tool.  It is all available. The human mind has vast possibilities to explore once we resolve the confusion. There is no intent to move anyone to think in a certain way. There is definite intention to help human beings to think more effectively in ways that improve their individual and collective lives.<br>  <br>  Source:<br>  <a href="http://www.sgi-usa.org." rel="nofollow">http://www.sgi-usa.org.</a> Or<br>  <a href="http://www.SGI.org" rel="nofollow">http://www.SGI.org</a> <br>   Caveat; SGI does not use the term life decryption key.

Some really cynical people refuse to believe anything without first having proof, visual or otherwise. Like when people say "I will believe God when I see him" lol! They refuse to take that leap of faith.<br>  <br>  I do not believe in God, but I am not a cynic. It's not the lack of evidence of him, I just don't believe in Him for personal reasons. But I used to believe in Santa Clause- most kids do. They take that leap of faith. But i suppose this argument has to be taken with a pinch of salt. I mean, a kid's proof of Santa Clause would be the presents he leaves in their stockings, so I suppose there is a sort of evidence on a basic level. But I believe children in general have this amazing capacity to believe in ideas that adults would not, on account of them being "unrealistic."<br>  <br>  I think cynicism comes with age. It is sad but true. I'm not saying this about all adults, but the majority yes.<br>  <br>  I think it is quite sad really. I worry that in the future, there will be no faith.

tfsNIX4uaa	Whenever I read work as full as this is with descriptive language, I find it hard to be critical of any creative turn the verses take.  What we have to remember about the creative process is that very few verbal stones are left unturned when it comes to where the writing mind chooses to take us.  Any work(well done) encourages us to willfully suspend our disbelief and take that journey into the imagination. I was pretty well drawn into the mix with the notion of from the beginning of "dark times referring to plague dogs".

cFiOTJ7jaa	Oh, I do love a good creative challenge like this one. You've sucked me in, you devil. So here's a few ideas:<br>  <br>  Name: Sessanta <br>  <br>  Reason: The Online Oxford English Dictionary offers no less than sixty definitions for 'time'. SIXTY definitions?! Hmmm... sixty definitions, sixty seconds, sixty minutes... that's rather appropriate. So take the Italian for sixty and, lo and behold, you get 'sessanta'! <br>  (It might well have been 'sestig' (Afrikaans), 'sechzig' (German), 'hatvan' (Hungarian), 'seksti' (Norwegian) or even 'sextio' (Swedish)... but 'sessanta' sounds best, don't you think?!)<br>  <br>  - - - -<br>  <br>  Name: Pilgrim<br>  <br>  Reason: A more personal one - the surname of the main character of my favourite book about time... or maybe even my favourite book of all time... 'Slaughterhouse 5'. It opens: 'LISTEN: Billy Pilgrim has become unstuck in time'. <br>  But also, who needs to know the time more than someone on a pilgrimage, on a journey away from home? And can we not all be considered pilgrims in time?<br>  <br>  - - - -<br>  <br>  Name: Vigil<br>  <br>  Reason: The word 'watch', of course, not only means the time-pieces produced by our hypothetical watch company, but to observe things as well, to pay attention. In fact, the OED's first definition for 'watch' is wakefulness or vigil, the latter meaning to remain awake when others are asleep. I like that. Watches never "sleep", reassuringly marking time while we slip off into timelessness...  And if we all took a little more time to observe, we might just be better off.<br>  <br>  - - - -<br>  <br>  Name: Carpusentry<br>  <br>  Reason: A merge of 'carpus' - the group of eight bones that make up the wrist, and 'sentry' - a guard on watch-duty. In other words, wrist-watch! Get it! Wristwatch! Oh my god, I'm so funny.<br>  <br>  - - - -<br>  <br>  Name: Space<br>  <br>  Reason: Nothing more than a little but frequent reminder that time is indeed inseperable from space. Are you not measuring time spatially? Does a watch not translate time into space?<br>  And a sly tribute to Einstein and his model of space-time.<br>  <br>  - - - -<br>  <br>  Name: Neighbourhood<br>  <br>  Reason: Neighbourhood watch. Get it! Neighbourhood watch! I'm on fire.<br>  <br>  - - - -<br>  <br>  Name: Clock-bee<br>  <br>  Reason: Apparantly, it's a kind of insect. The Common Dor or Shardborne Beetle, since you asked. We've already got the company symbol sorted out for that one!|`|AA10283947	The problem with watches these days is that many brand names jump onto the bandwagon using their name which not necessarily relates to the quality of the mechanism within the watch.<br>  So to give a name to a watch you would need to consider the market to which the product is addressed i.e. if it were for the mass pleb route then a name of a sportsman might fit the bill.<br>  To aim for the top class market where the watch is not produced by any other than a watch maker, then, a classic type of logo would be better i.e. something after the Greek or Roman Gods, or anything to associate with classic discovery like the Rosetta stone,Darwin,Newton, or minerals or star names.<br>  Failing all the above then a scan through a Latin dictionary should reveal a classic choice of names bering in mind that the shorter the name the easier it is to fit onto the watch facia dial.|`|nM7xmhgiaa	TempusFugit|`|0047572b741498da2d839902d6863185aa	SOLO<br>  because one wrist and one watch for each person.|`|GyBeE7ofaa	Heidegger|`|BXMHgiK5aa	Probably SOLIDARITY<br>  I don't know why though lol x|`|x4dKcHreaa	Reflexiv....to remind me (of something) every time I look at it.|`|6qsTmMQaaa	I would probably name it MINUTIME, because it's a combination of "minute" and "time".

There's three of them out, and the red one is the first one...just called Diary of a Wimpy Kid, followed by Roderick Rules (blue) and The Last Straw (green).  I work in the library at my daughters' elementary school and these book are huge with that group.  Its a journal/diary written by a boy.<br>  <br>  If you want myth and legend for his age try Percy Jackson and the Olympians by Rick Riordan.  First one is the Lightning Thief.  About a young boy, I think he's 11 or 12, who finds out he is the son of a mortal and Poseidon.  It's full of action and humor and very appealing to that age group.<br>  <br>  The Pendragon series by D.J. MacHale is also good, but they are kind of slow to start and finish with a bang.  The first one is The Merchant of Death.  About traveling to other worlds to keep "Halla" in balance.<br>  <br>  If he liked Harry Potter, the Septimus Heap books by Angie Sage are good.  There's 4 so far and the first one is called Magyk.  A young orphan boy discovers he is a magician.<br>  <br>  Fable Haven by Brandon Mull.  About a brother and sister who discover their grandparents are the keepers of a wildlife refuge, but instead of wildlife, its magical creaturs. <br>  <br>  Deltora Quest by Emily Rodda.   The books are a bit smaller than the others i mentioned, but you can get one volume that has the entire series in it.  A magical belt that is the secret to the king's power whose jewels have been scattered throughout the realm and the heroes have to recover them to put the rightful king back into power.<br>  <br>  If all else fails, a Barnes and Noble or Borders gift card is always an option.<br>  <br>  A lot of it depends on his reading level, but these are all suitable for 3-5 grade.<br>  <br>  Hope this helps :)|`|pT30trt6aa	Narnia(the Lion the withc and the wardrobe...)its preety good<br>  or <br>  Fantastic Mr Fox-Roald Dahl (not a mystery....just really funny)or you could try James and the Giant Peach-Roald Dahl<br>  Even books by Enid Blyton...Famous Five Series,The wishing Chair series...The FAraway Tree series(really cool stuff)<br>  <br>  or if want somehting kinda spooky(for a tenyear old) try the goosebump series-R.L stine|`|2bnUDwBxaa	The City of Ember<br>  The Giver<br>  The Thief Lord<br>  Inkheart<br>  Dragon Rider<br>  The Dark Is Rising<br>  A Tale of Time City<br>  The Witches<br>  I Am Mordred|`|cYGTus2waa	Narnia.

Of course, that is if he hasn't read it and he very possibly could have. Another great book with myths in it is the Percy Jackson series, which is about a boy who's mom is normal and dad is the sea god which would change his life after he gets his powers. There are four of them and I would start him off with either the first or second book.( The second is easier.) I think both of these books are better than the Harry Potter books, which are probably too big for him and get confusing. Any book by Andrew Clements are interesting as well, especially as its more of a real story. By that I mean its more believable.

1e03893bd2eeaafdc3ef879d2d82dfc1aa	According to The Times (of London) ... in 2007 over 7,000,000 people visited Da Vinci's Mona Lisa ... which hangs in the Louvre in Paris.  <br>  <br>  According to UNESCO statistics, in 2004 ... 319,100 people (by ticket count) visited Da Vinci's Last Supper.  Moreover, I note that only twenty people at a time may visit this painting which is in the refrectory (dining hall) of a convent at Santa Maria delle Grazie in Milan.  As visitors are strictly limited and can stay for up to 15 minutes ... this keeps the number of potential visitors on the low side. <br>  <br>  While the years are different, I think it's fair for one to assume that the Mona Lisa is far more often visited ... and thereby more famous. <br>  <br>  Certainly fewer people know Da Vinci's Last Supper than know the Mona Lisa (also know as La Gioconda).  The Mona Lisa is an attraction in and of itself ... but as for the Last Supper ... while many are familar with it ... were it not for the Da Vinci Code ... I think even fewer people would be seeking it out.<br>  <br>  Hope this helps you.|`|AA11660242	The Mona Lisa is definitely more famous.|`|Vvahm0uKaa	The mona Lisa is deffo more popular.<br>  Most people would never have heard of the last supper.<br>  Everyone will know of the Mona Lisa because it's that famous|`|aAGcYAsNaa	The Mona Lisa is small (about 20X30 inches) and accessible, hanging in the Louvre... where it's seen by MANY MANY tourists who buy books, post cards, and talk to their friends, spreading the word. It has been well-conserved, and has appeared in almost every classic review of Western visual art. The Last Supper, on the other hand, is a big mural (that doesn't copy well in most books) on a wall in a refectory attached to a convent... not quite the same foot-traffic as the Louvre. The Mona Lisa has generated a lot of speculation, which only adds to its fame. In addition, there have been many spin-offs (Nat'l Lampoon's Mona Monkey, the "DaVinci Toad" portrait...) Finally, any lesson on western "Art" or "Civilization" is going to feature DaVinci somewhere. Easier to maintain cultural neutrality by citing Mona Lisa rather than the Last Supper.|`|bpo78l7oaa	The Mona Lisa. A lot of people don't even know that The Last Supper is but Da Vinci... or that it even exists. But everybody know about the Mona Lisa.
dlGP3iZ6aa	Descartes's goal is to use his "Method of Doubt" to arrive at one truth that cannot be doubted.  I'm assuming you are familar with his argument, so I'll list a few possible issues:<br>  <br>  1) Descartes never doubts the capacity of language to reflect the nature of reality.  He relies on linguistic concepts in order to carry out his method of doubt, but assumes that his concepts are reliable;<br>  2) Descartes never doubts the reliability of logic.  One way to defend Descartes here is to say that for him logic and mathematics are basically the same thing, and that he does doubt mathematics.  However, Descartes was influenced by Scholastic philosophy, which treats logic as a pure inquiry that does not rely on mathematics.  So, he can still be charged on these grounds;<br>  3) Descartes assumes that the mind can be affirmed without reference to the body.  Much contemporary epistemology now claims that consciousness IS essentially embodied, and that mind-body dualism is outdated.<br>  4) Husserl's objection: Descartes arrives at the "I think", but does not go the extra step to say that the "I think" must always have an object.  For Husserl, consciousness is always conscious "of" something.  To think is to think "of" something, to desire is to desire something, etc.  In other words, "intentionality" is absent in Descartes;<br>  5) Descartes assumes that the self is an enduring substance.  Isn't the self always changing? <br>  6) Descartes holds that what we see in the world is a product of "intellection".  This means that when I see a table, for instance, I see only what the mind tells me I see.  This implies that for Descartes we do not have direct access to reality, that we never see things as they really are--only what the mind tells us they are; <br>  7) Descartes affirms a separation between mind and brain, and for this reason fails to understand the true nature of consciousness.<br>  <br>  There are many other possible criticisms.  These are just the ones that come to mind.|`|AA11564934	If you are setting out to prove the self, u can;t assume the self in your very first statement (I think).<br>  <br>  he should have said thought exists.|`|yOK32PM9aa	I thought you'd be back!

86815d1eba351063bef37ade6adaf5e3aa	The previous answers are childish bollocks. Lincoln did not believe in slavery and expected/hoped it would die out by itself. In that respect he was not an active abolitionist but was against slavery. He also is on record as considering the slavery issue as a nuisance and a distraction from the real issues behind the civil war. But was he a racist? By the standards of 2009 almost certainly yes, but who is to say that by the standards of 150 years in the future we wouldn't be considered racist too?|`|AA10344737	No.<br>  <br>  Lincoln was a racist that used the liberation of slaves as a political pawn to change the morality of the war and to keep England out (they would have helped the south, whom they had a comfy cotton trade with).<br>  <br>  Lincoln didn't care two cents about blacks.|`|pjwdOfLxaa	Yes he was, it was because of that he was assassinated.|`|c62bede4b148ea87fc523aa3f86eab76aa	zoer is right, lincoln was not an abolitionist.

LEp7IFdvaa	Although you have a few poetic lines, what you've really created is a story in prose...a good story perhaps, but still prose.  Poetic narrative and poetic prose are close cousins and there is sometimes a fine line between them...this time you landed on the side of prose.  Be careful of using cliches (Morpheus's arms)...it's difficult sometimes because you're looking for a familiar phrase...but if the phrase has become too familiar, it is also cliche.  Still, there are elements in your story that could easily find themselves in a poem...keep writing.

s5yZNq3iaa	Advice on ballet shoes:<br>  Pointe shoes:<br>  - Your pointe shoe should fit snugly but not too tightly, if you plan to wear toe pads.<br>  - The box: Toes must not overlap each other inside the box.<br>  - The vamp: The demi-pointe position must be easily reached.<br>  - The sole: The choice of the shank depends on the strength of the foot and the dancer's experience.<br>  <br>  Going onto pointe must be easy and the ankle must get support inside the pointe shoe.<br>  - The quarter: In a demi-plié position, the back of the shoe must not be tight to the heel.<br>  - The crown: some free space is necessary between the knot and the foot. <br>  Soft ballet shoes: <br>  - A soft ballet shoe with the right fitting, gives your foot total freedom in flexed and stretched positions. <br>  - The front of the foot must be tightly fitted as if in a glove. However, the toes must be able to properly spread out the shoe so that the dancer can feel support on the floor.<br>  - The ideal soft ballet shoe must be nimble at the back of the heel.<br>  - Soles of soft ballet shoes are either split or full :<br>  - Full soles are helpful to give strength to your foot as well as to work on your arch.<br>  - Split-soles hug your foot in its exact shape and are recommended for performances and exams.<br>  Leather ballet shoes are more resistant and will last longer. They are recommended for beginners for their support to the ankle.<br>  Canvas ballet shoes bring optimum suppleness and are easy to maintain in good condition.<br>  <br>  <br>  Oh and help on comfort for them <br>  There are several ways of protecting your toes: <br>  - Silicone or foam toe cushions (available at Repetto's)<br>  - Untreated carded cotton (available in pharmacies)<br>  - Tissue rolled up flat around toes.<br>  - In case of intensive use, tape each toe.<br>  <br>  Before the class:<br>  - It is recommended to cut your nails straight and put the seams of the tights on the edge of your toes.<br>  <br>  During the class:<br>  - If you feel any tension or pain, no need to take your tights off to protect your toes. Repetto has especially made tights with a hole under the foot to allow immediate treatment.<br>  After the class:<br>  - Put some baby powder between toes to avoid humidity.<br>  - Avoid extended foot baths, as they soften the skin.<br>  <br>  <br>  Hope I helped xxx|`|id1Miha4aa	Alright, firstly there is the ballet shoe. It was originally made out of leather, but can also be made of canvas. It has an inner layer of canvas. <br>  Pointe shoes have a silk outer layer, and a canvas one underneath that. Pointe shoes were originally made of wood, however that is when they were first invented. Now they are made of something like paper mache.<br>  Tap shoes have metal, or linoleum on the ball and heel of the shoe. Tap shoes were originated in Africa, or African people when they came to America.<br>  Modern dance is usually danced with bare feet, or "dance paws" which are nude fabrics that go over the ball of your foot.

kf1rqH3Baa	Most of his newer books are not horror, exactly, but you should read Phantoms and Midnight, two of my favorites that I read when I was thirteen.  Phantoms is the reason he became known for horror.  Also try Dragon Tears.  Darkfall, The Bad Place, and Watchers are all great too.|`|a9wRfuuSaa	I would start with Watchers or Odd Thomas. These are more sci-fi or supernatural thrillers with a touch of horror, but are my favorites of his books that I have read. I like that he includes good doses of humor in most of his books - no matter what is going on he is able to lighten the mood.<br>  <br>  I would also recommend Life Expectancy, False Memory, The Husband and The Good Guy.<br>  <br>  In Odd We Trust (mentioned by another answerer) is a graphic novel version of the original book. I would read the book rather than the graphic novel. <br>  <br>  For horror, try titles such as The Bad Place or Fear Nothing.|`|0hXqrdGDaa	You can try "In Odd We Trust". It sounds like a good book and it also has three or four books to follow-up on the story. Here's the synopsis...<br>  <br>  “Meet a young man named Odd . . . who helps the dead get even."<br>  <br>  From the infinite imagination of #1 New York Times bestselling author Dean Koontz comes the suspenseful graphic-novel debut of a natural-born hero with a supernatural twist.<br>  <br>  Odd Thomas is a regular nineteen-year-old with an unusual gift: the ability to see the lingering spirits of the dead. To Odd, it’s not such a big deal. And most folks in sleepy Pico Mundo, California, are much more interested in the irresistible pancakes Odd whips up at the local diner. Still, communing with the dead can be useful. Because while some spirits only want a little company . . . others want justice. <br>  <br>  When the sad specter of a very frightened boy finds its way to him, Odd vows to root out the evil suddenly infecting the sunny streets of Pico Mundo. But even with his exceptional ability–plus the local police and his pistol-packing girlfriend, Stormy, backing him–is Odd any match for a faceless stalker who’s always a step ahead . . . and determined to kill again?|`|gLwCCr0Naa	Dean Koontz is my favorite author.  The first book of his I read and that hooked me was "Lightning."  I have read most of his books and loved them all but one.  I think it was "Demon Seed."  WARNING:  His books can be addictive!  If you don't like one, try a couple more as he covers a lot of subjects.|`|jk9yr5pvaa	"Intensity", is the first Dean Koontz book I read, and that hooked me.Once you start any of his books, you won't want to put it down until you're finished.

AA10729675	I am French.  In France, Napoleon is a hero.  Yes he did what he did in Russia.  Yes also, Alexander the Great did what he did in Bactria.  There are places where people lose their souls.  Napoleon, for me is a hero, a very good person, who started out of nothing and all alone could re-establish France as a super-power.  He also is the reason behind the Rosetta Stone and the first archaeological work both in Egypt and in Italy.  English speaking people read about Napoleon in English texts at first written by British, the enemies of Napoleon.  Of course, those texts are portraying him as evil.<br>  So did the Greeks toward Alexander whom they did not call "the Great".  Only the Romans had enough objectivity to understand the amplitude of Alexander's exploits and called him "the Great".<br>  Napoleon instituted free and mandatory schooling for all children.<br>  He separated quite peacefully the Church and the State.<br>  He created the Bank of France. <br>  He created a currency.<br>  He made a new code of Laws.  He allowed divorce.<br>  He beautified France.<br>  As he could not have children with his first wife, he divorced her and his second wife, an aristocrat from Austria, despised him. cheated on him, did not let him see their child.  Napoleon cried in exile because all he could see was a bust of his son.<br>  Napoleon was capable of emotions, and humanity.<br>  But of course, that is my French point of view.|`|tqg3qZzSaa	Napoleon is one of the greatest people in history. His actions can be seen as both good and bad depending on which country you come from and what your views are, but at heart Napoleon was simply a human. As with many leaders throughout history, Napoleon is critically judged on every actions he made.<br>  <br>  The answer above me gives good detail on what he accomplished in France, of course he also was a force of good in other countries as well. In Italy he is considered the father of Italian unity, as he was the first leader to begin the process of consolidating the minor Italian kingdoms. Napoleon also played a major role in German history, he caused the Holy Roman Empire to be dissolved and in its place created the Confederation of the Rhine. He consolidated the sprawling "empire" of petty principalities and church controlled land into a far more efficient system. Also indirectly contributing to the rise of German nationalism. Napoleon also tried to export many ideas of the French Revolution such as equality before the law and separation of church and state. In Spain his reforms could of greatly improved the country, unfortunately the British decided that Spain would become a bloody battlefield to further their attempt to destroy the French empire and restore the hated Bourbons. One other international contribution was the Louisiana purchase, this sale more than doubled the size of the U.S. and forver ensured its survival and expansion.<br>  <br>  So yes Napoleon was a force of good and a hero in my book. The worst thing I believe he can be accused of is being overly ambitious at times.

If you get blinking lights, odds are you will not get a great pic.  If it is a little dark and you have editting software, like photoshop elemenst, you can lighten the picture in post process.|`|YupMCYHlaa	To get droplets of water you need something -really- fast, like 1/2000.  I don't know how fast the D40 goes.  The way this is usually done is with a flash.  The duration of the flash is much shorter than the shutter, so it freezes action much better.  You've seen those pictures of a bullet going through a tomato, where the bullet is stopped, those are done with a flash.<br>  <br>  With the shutter you are limited to how wide your aperture is.  Every step you speed up the shutter you have to open the aperture one stop, and F/4 is not great.  So you'll have to use a high ASA speed, which gives you a grainy, noisy picture.<br>  <br>  Many flashes today are automatic, they have a photo sensor on them and they stop flashing when they receive a certain amount of light back from the subject.  These are the kind you use for the trick shots, because it shortens the flash duration even more if you are close up (like a bullet through a tomato or water drops).|`|i5OVORXgaa	To compesate for the light loss you can use a wider aperture, use a higher ISO, or both (too high of an ISO will result in a grainy image).
ZmdIlkpQaa	My understanding is that Stalin signed to buy time.  It was evident that Hitler would eventually turn on the Soviet Union, but by signing the pact, he was able to get the Eastern portion of Poland, and to buy time with which to ramp up aircraft and tank production and to reorganize his military's officers corps.  The Officer Corps had been badly broken by purges Stalin had initiated in the early 1930's, and time was required to patch up the damage done.|`|RehgySLCaa	They say that Stalin was obsessed with Hitler. kind of like a fan boy.

Hitler also imported machines from Russia which helped Russia's economy.

Derrida argues that writing has often been considered to be derived from speech, and he says that this attitude has been reflected in many philosophic and scientific investigations of the origin of language. He says that the tendency to consider writing as an expression of speech has led to the assumption that speech is closer than writing to the truth or logos of meaning and representation. He explains that the development of language occurs through an interplay of speech and writing and that because of this interplay, neither speech nor writing may properly be described as being more important to the development of language.|`|d7c8ecd624fbbc0797b1502ba6682e8baa	That he is under the illusion that thought requires language.

When no one understands the Chief, McMurphy interacts with him. He invites Chief to play basketball; taking lengths to engage him and bring him out of his solitude.

The goals of believing in supernaturalism, such as heaven, are not available to living beings, and after death we have no means of corroborating the truth.<br>  <br>  Idealism, therefore, seeks such "truths" as can be corroborated and attained as a goal in Aristotle's concept of "Man qua man." Man "qua man" is the idea that there is an ideal of what man is, and that it is our goal to seek it and then to live it.<br>  <br>  Living as if "the real reality" was anywhere but on earth or in the physical universe, or that we know nothing but "phenomena" because (Kant's) noumena is the only reality, is not ideal.<br>  <br>  But I think calling reality "idealism" is putting the cart before the horse.

ac0d4c45bf78507770b21657ff6f8f59aa	As with anything you purchase and intend to maintain, you must have expenses in doing so.<br>  <br>  1. If your computer tuner works then keep using it. Otherwise, buy a tuner to keep in the case in the event you travel to play.<br>  <br>  2.  Medium gauge strings produce the best tonal delivery. Many guitarists use light gauged strings for bending and to allay sore fingertips. Try a set of light and then medium gauges to see which suits you best.<br>  <br>  3.  Buy your strings at a local music store. Most reputable stores will install the strings at no charge. Ask if you can watch so you can learn how to do the task.<br>  <br>  4.  While at the music store, buy a bottle of guitar polish and some soft cloths. Fender, Gibson, and Martin put out quality polishes. Ordinarily, a soft, warmly moist cloth is best to wipe away smudges from your guitar, following up with a dry, clean cloth.<br>  <br>  5. If your fretboard is rosewood ask the guitar technician what you should do to keep it in shape. This calls for quality fretboard oil and OOOO steel wool.<br>  <br>  Congratulations on your new purchase! I wish you success in learning the joys of guitar playing. If you aren't considering professional lessons, get a copy of Hal Leonard's Beginning Guitar Method Book One. Inside are instructions in tuning, care, basic chords, and basic music theory with exercises. It's a great book for the beginner!|`|g2QUNwZzaa	changing acoustic strings is easy as pie. i always do it myself. but i've been doing it for 12 years....<br>  <br>  you dont really need anything except the guitar and the strings. i dont even use a pick. even when im playing electric and heavy.<br>  <br>  and yes, lighter gauge is better for soft and mellow (the thin string, high E, should be about .10 or .11, and the big string, low E, .46 or .48)<br>  <br>  change the strings about every 6 months. but buy extras because the thinner strings snap alot. its a very small margin between properly tuning the high E and tightening it too much for it to snap. especially lighter guages, they snap easier than thicker strings.<br>  <br>  i also think tuners are a waste of money. if ur at home u can just search "guitar tuner" and find one online for free. after awhile u'll be able to tune it without a tuner. i rarely use one of these either. an easy way to remember is the string underneath should sound the same as the string above on the 5th fret. except the second string, B, which sounds like the 4th fret on the 3rd string G.<br>  <br>  edit<br>  tbh, my guitar never sounds in tune, but i experiment with different tunings to get different sound. but thats too advanced for you right now. ignore these last 3 sentences|`|xhgA65M9aa	well yes you probably will need a spare set of guitar strings incase the ones you have now break, although ive had my guitar for over 3 years and mine are fine. you will need a cloth to keep it clean and that is basically it. you will have to learn from someone else ( a guitar teacher) how to replace the strings properly and how to keep them in tune. you can buy electronical tuners, use ones on the internet or play and E keyboard note and start to tune your string from that|`|AA10236778	Do you play or are you learning? If you are learning you may want to get some lessons on DVD even if you are taking lessons from a pro. Depending on how much you play, I would change the strings once a year, most are cheap, between $5-$20. You can change strings yourself easily. Some quality wood cleaner/polish to keep it beautiful. New strings will have to be tuned several times before they hold tune for an extended time period. Good luck and happy playing!|`|BwUSAXxqaa	Nice choice.<br>  <br>  You should change the strings when they snap, obviously, but generally every month or so to keep them nice. The gauges are more personal preference than anything else, but a lighter gauge allows more bending of the strings etc. It will also give a lighter sound. Lighter strings snap more. Stock up on spares. You do not want to leave strings on too long. Up to six months or so would be a maximum in my opinion. Otherwise they get dull and the sound of your guitar will be fairly shabby.<br>  <br>  You can change the strings yourself, and will soon pick this up. There are many tutorials on how to do this on YouTube and other similar sites. When changing the strings, wipe down the neck with a soft cloth (something like chamois works well).<br>  <br>  You may also want to buy a light oil such as Dr. Stringfellow Lemon Oil. This should be applied to the neck every couple of months to keep the wood clean and soft. It will also make the sound of the guitar crisper as it stops the frets from gunking up. Instructions on how to apply are on the bottle. If I remember correctly, you apply it to the next, leave for a couple of minutes, then wipe away with a chamois.<br>  <br>  Other than this, you should be OK.<br>  <br>  Hope this helps, enjoy playing.

0HAn67yZaa	jonas Name Meaning and History<br>  English, German, French, Jewish (Ashkenazic), Lithuanian, Czech and Slovak (Joná?), and Hungarian (Jónás): from a medieval personal name, which comes from the Hebrew male personal name Yona, meaning ‘dove’. In the book of the Bible which bears his name, Jonah was appointed by God to preach repentance to the city of Nineveh, but tried to flee instead to Tarshish. On the voyage to Tarshish, a great storm blew up, and Jonah was thrown overboard by his shipmates to appease God’s wrath, swallowed by a great fish, and delivered by it on the shores of Nineveh. This story exercised a powerful hold on the popular imagination in medieval Europe, and the personal name was a relatively common choice. The Hebrew name and its reflexes in other languages (for example Yiddish Yoyne) have been popular Jewish personal names for generations. There are also saints, martyrs, and bishops called Jonas venerated in the Orthodox Church. Ionas is found as a Greek family name. <br>  Jewish (Ashkenazic): respelling of Yonis, with Yiddish possessive -s. <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  and i have read that they have cherokee native american in them.|`|q9BItD25aa	Jonas is an English name , but they could be a mix of anything.|`|T2isnQNKaa	jonas is an english last name but i think i heard that they were something like french, italian and cherokee|`|sU60NqWWaa	my guess is they are of Greek heritage.
j5Apt8hWaa	The process you mention is an experiment in a physics class as a demonstration. <br>  <br>  On a camera, a polarizing filter is used to reduce reflections when shooting in sunlight and also to increase the blue in the sky when shooting 90 degrees to the suns arc.<br>  <br>  If you shoot indoors, a polarizing filter can only be effective when using light that has also been polarized.|`|AA10275004	when light comes out of the sun  it's waves are in all sorts of different directions like a circle where it can be turned in any direction.<br>  <br>  Some objects, particularly shiny objects refelct to much light and wash out any detail of the thing your looking at. somewhat like looking at the sun in a piece of tinfoil-- all you would see is a giant burst of light but not really any tinfoil.  This is a problem when you need to see something underneath all that glare. As in looking at a lake on sunny day you see the blue sky on the lake but nothing really below the water line.  The way that is combattted is to remove most of thoe light rays which are coming in at any particular direction on that circle of direction I mentioned in the first part.  It's a little more complicated but the basic idea is what angle the light is coming in will give a certain angle back at 90 degrees,  The polarizer has micro lines in it that remove all the angles of light hitting it but one, that angle is 90 degrees to the object where the sun should be hitting it.  I know it's confusing but it works.<br>  <br>  In photography we use polarizing lenses to get rid of haze in the air and to darken skies.  When darkening skies wee are removing all those crazy angles that are creating to much light, the light that is left is less of course and in return it makes skies darker. In photographs people are attracted to darker skies, it makes clouds pop right out  and everything seem much more dramatic.

But when he meets the hauntingly pale, steely-eyed Joshua York, he is certain. For York doesn't care that the icy winter of 1857 has wiped out all but one of Marsh's dilapidated fleet. Nor does he care that he won't earn back his investment in a decade. York has his own reasons for wanting to traverse the powerful Mississippi. And they are to be none of Marsh's concern, no matter how bizarre, arbitrary, or capricious his actions may prove. Marsh meant to turn down York's offer. It was too full of secrets that spelled danger. But the promise of both gold and a grand new boat that could make history crushed his resolve, coupled with the terrible force of York's mesmerizing gaze. Not until the maiden voyage of his new sidewheeler Fevre Dream would Marsh realize he had joined a mission both more sinister, and perhaps more noble, than his most fantastic nightmare...and mankind's most impossible dream. Here is the spellbinding tale of a vampire's quest to unite his race with humanity, of a garrulous riverman's dream of immortality, and of the undying legends of the steamboat era and a majestic, ancient river.<br>  <br>  I also like the Anita Blake series by Laurell Hamilton (though it does lean a little toward the romantic side).|`|cgz85foTaa	Let Me In by John Ajvide Lindqvist<br>  The Vampire Chronicles by Anne Rice<br>  'Salem's Lot by Stephen King<br>  Fevre Dream by George R.

ArmKXfffaa	Elpenor.<br>  <br>  Here is the episode (there are other translations but all tell exactly the same story):<br>  <br>  "The first ghost that came was that of my comrade Elpenor, for he had not yet been laid beneath the earth. We had left his body unwaked and unburied in Circe's house, for we had had too much else to do. I was very sorry for him, and cried when I saw him: 'Elpenor,' said I, 'how did you come down here into this gloom and darkness? You have got here on foot quicker than I have with my ship.'<br>  <br>  "'Sir,' he answered with a groan, 'it was all bad luck, and my own unspeakable drunkenness. I was lying asleep on the top of Circe's house, and never thought of coming down again by the great staircase but fell right off the roof and broke my neck, so my soul came down to the house of Hades. And now I beseech you by all those whom you have left behind you, though they are not here, by your wife, by the father who brought you up when you were a child, and by Telemachus who is the one hope of your house, do what I shall now ask you. I know that when you leave this limbo you will again hold your ship for the Aeaean island. Do not go thence leaving me unwaked and unburied behind you, or I may bring heaven's anger upon you; but burn me with whatever armour I have, build a barrow for me on the sea shore, that may tell people in days to come what a poor unlucky fellow I was, and plant over my grave the oar I used to row with when I was yet alive and with my messmates.' And I said, 'My poor fellow, I will do all that you have asked of me.'<br>  <br>  "Thus, then, did we sit and hold sad talk with one another, I on the one side of the trench with my sword held over the blood, and the ghost of my comrade saying all this to me from the other side.'
BLMh0dG6aa	In either case its helpful to know the background, for instance when I write in period war pieces doing research on ballista’s, trebuchet, forts, etc, allows me much more creative freedom to navigate, and much more confidence in creating the appearance of chaotic battles.<br>  <br>  Also intercutting between battles which you may first design one at a time may make it seem more chaotic, e.g. several fights happening in the same field of battle, all in ignorance of each other, [properly interspersed may give both energy and a chaotic feel, as well as numerous creative possibilities in interweaving the related threads back together.<br>  <br>  However:<br>  <br>  DON'T CONFUSE GIVING THE APPEARANCE OF CHAOS TO THE READER WITH THINGS SEEMING CHAOTIC TO YOU WHILE WRITING.|`|pbw7chpyaa	Add smell.<br>  <br>  I was reading a novel today and they said something along the lines of "we stepped off the plane and the smell of dung and gasoline hit us..."  It did a good job of telling the third world in brief.  So add the smell of those freshly dead bad guys.  Then again, James Bond always was about sanitized violence, the guys he kills never crap themselves while trying to get their intestines back in their bellies.|`|VltYJmqZaa	COOOL!  Here are some ideas that may help:<br>  <br>  * Try playing music or a song that makes you think of a warzone ~ something fast, loud, and epic sounding.  Then turn it off and try jotting down random sentences off the top of your head. Snowflakes can turn into avalanches sometimes for writers : ).  <br>  <br>  * Read battle scenes from books or watch a favorite scene from a movie.  Don't be afraid to have fun and get into it.  Fight-scenes are supposed to be creative, interesting and exciting!<br>  <br>  * It sounds like you have something already written so maybe go back through it and make sure the majority of the sentences are short and succint.  If you are in the middle of a life and death struggle, you don't have time to notice a lot of detailed description- so its okay for sentences to be kind of choppy.  <br>  <br>  Also, make sure the words reflect the characters inner state of mind.  Your character will see everything in a different light when they are in a perilous situation.  For example, if an opponent has a rose pinned to their jacket maybe he might think it looked the color of blood, where he probably wouldn't see a flower as being threatening in another circumstance.  The eerie atmosphere surrounding your characters before a fight can help make it a really explosive, tense battle later on.   <br>  <br>  Lastly, James Bond is going to first notice the possible dangers in the situation as well as the things he could use to his advantage.  If an opponent is tall, maybe he's try to force that enemy into an environment where his height would be a hinderance to him.  If your villain is really well-developed and experienced in fighting, he or she will be thinking the same kind of things about James Bond.  <br>  <br>  Sorry for rambling ~ I'm addicted to writing battle scenes!  Good luck with your fanfiction!|`|LNSEdqzUaa	One cant really help if we do not know what you have already got.<br>  <br>  How ever just by saying what all the soldiers on both sides are doing, combined with vivid descriptions of the destruction and its after effects (fire, rubble etc) should be enough. You do not really want to over do it or it will look like it is trying too hard.

HkXYGAOdaa	Have you jotted down ideas, "working on it', for a while?  If so, then it should be easy for you to start writing it.  Don't worry about the first draft; you can always revise.  Just keep on writing.  Write 10-15 pages per day; it'll take you about 40 or so days to write.  Then you can read it, annotate it, and revise it if necessary.<br>  <br>  Good luck.|`|QlB3VXWraa	About 12 years for Jean Auel. About 12 days for Stephen King. It's different for everybody.|`|UmoO78vCaa	depends on the author. it can take from a few months to a few years. and i would aim for maybe two or three pages  day, and if you can do more- great!|`|njppcqO8aa	it could take from a few weeks to a few years. write as much as you can that's good in one day.|`|QGU7JAIUaa	I would say try to aim to write about ten pages a day. If you do that it would probobly be finished within quite a few months.|`|isZ8eb98aa	How ever long it takes. It really depends on how committed to the story you are, and it changes per person..<br>  <br>  -Tila.|`|bc7a76cc6fa79014e1defaf1b86dea41aa	My first book I ever wrote had 26 chapters and they were all about 18-20 pages a piece so i'd say it had around 500 pages maybe. It took me 4 years to write it and even then I still wasn't finish. I've gone back and edited it many times. Also along the way of writing it I took breaks, got writer's block, got other ideas and started different stories that I worked on for a little while. It's been 6 years and only 2 of my 10 stories are completed and both of which still have yet to be fully edited and deemed ready to be published.|`|862f8e3d565cf11bb982e86b1a4dcdefaa	It all depends on the person. Some people write extremely fast, some write extremely slow. It all depends on you.<br>  <br>  But if you're serious about writing it, I would shoot for at least 500-1000 words a day. I know it doesn't seem like much, but it is an easy goal to hit, and once you hit it, generally, at least for me, you get so pumped that you feel like writing even more.<br>  <br>  Give yourself breather days though. Don't write if you have to force yourself to.|`|p7At4cyvaa	example: Stephany Myere wrote Twilight in 2 days, when she was at home with her kids on a snow day. <br>  <br>  my book that i am writing im on my 20th day & already have 344 pages. with size 9 text:)<br>  <br>  <br>  shouldn't take long if you make time for everything. <br>  <br>  tips to plan: time is always first<br>  pages is 2nd<br>  title<br>  topic<br>  && then time for research!!!!!!<br>  <br>  <br>  hope this helped..|`|5wg7tKc6aa	Depends on your level of committment, and how many times you plan on revising, and perfecting it.

Some write only when truly inspired, some write every day. Totally subjective. Some people take ages getting everything just right, some write loosely.|`|WMZPZr8Oaa	Write as much as possible daily.

JdYVmsNaaa	I was just telling a story on <I>'s question about a time when I was ever-so-slightly turned around on a mountain side during a storm, and a wild dog escorted me to a storm shelter. However, I left off the ending to the story, because one can hardly blame dog for this part. <br>  <br>  There we were, soaked and muddy, relieved at our good fortune, and just starting to breathe easier. My sister was carrying a backpack, and rummaged through it to produce a granola bar. No sooner had she opened the wrapper, than a pair of bees came to investigate. We quickly dispatched them, but moments later, there were a half-dozen more upon us. <br>  <br>  Giving up on killing them all, we threw the granola bar away from ourselves, but it was too late--the entire roof was coming down on us in an angry buzzing wave.  With haste, we retreated back into the storm, and ran a back down the trail (as fast our unstoppable laughter would allow us). My last name's not Griswold, but given my vacation history, that would be fitting. <br>  <br>  My point is, we humans carry on obsessing over our appearances and identities, our romances and rejections, our rescues and our ejections, our peace and our wars. We play out our little dramas and think ourselves so important.<br>   <br>  Swat a fly, step on an ant, tell yourself they're tiny; tell yourself they don't even have individual minds. Tell yourself whatever you like. It doesn't matter. Whatever becomes of Humanity, it is certain insects will get the last laugh.|`|AA11488628	i'd start laughing. then i would lay back down and wake up again in the real world. it is not uncommon to dream you are waking up and to find yourself in an odd world that looks like the real world but there is something off like people wanting to give insects a sense of humor. it would be interesting though to hear of a science fiction novel with this premise though.|`|AA10246871	Damn, Darwinal beat me to the Kafka reference.<br>  <br>  That was all I had...|`|cL0aHkYEaa	Oh my god...is this an earmark in a current piece of legislation?

ZW24GerXaa	Dark High Noon is code name for Midnight Sun. Stephanie Meyer said she wont start writing Midnight Sun again until she stops hearing about it or seeing things about it. so someone came up with the idea to call it Dark High Noon for a codename whenever we wanted to talk about it. that way, we could talk about it without Stephanie knowing and then she could start the books again. click the link below to find out more info.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://twilightersanonymous.com/twilighters-anonymous-staff-responds-midnight-sun-dark-high-noon-project.html" rel="nofollow">http://twilightersanonymous.com/twilight...</a><br>  <br>  I hope this helps!|`|S4W7FojCaa	It's code name for Midnight Sun because Meyer doesn't want to hear the words Midnight Sun...something like that. <br>  <br>  I am not obsessed though.|`|TZTJRrM4aa	Simply means Midnight Sun. Fans just suggested not to say Midnight Sun, because it would hurt Stephanie or something lame like that|`|fEL7NNBeaa	'Dark High Noon' is the fan code name for 'Midnight Sun'<br>  when Midnight sun wasn't supposed to be leaked onto the internet, any fans who wanted to talk about it on fan sites and didn't want Stephenie or any of her people to find out so 'they didn't get upset' or something ( :p ) they were talking about it, discussed 'Dark High Noon'.<br>  i thinkk (: but i'm not some crazed Twilight fan, little sister is :p x|`|VhRjAxduaa	Well that's stupid and so is Twilight.|`|X8VLOImraa	is it not some kind of code name for midnight sun? :-P
vlCWp7sSaa	I think that is can swing both ways. Sorry fan girls, you might end up hating me after I say this. It is a good influence because it did get a large population of teenagers to read. I have to admit people who rarely ever read picked it up and enjoyed it. Plus, the sex didn't happen until they got married. Unfortunately, they got married at a very young age, or well  Bella did.<br>  <br>   After I read the book and watched the movie, I moved on to a new book. For some people- they didn't. I knew girls who nearly "obsessed" about it! One of my friends drove to Chicago just to see Robert Pattinson! The conversation about it never ends. The first thing that comes out her mouth is "Robert Pattinson is so hot." It gets exhausting! Someone please talk about something new! Sorry gals-  he's a fictional character and he will remain a fictional character.|`|Q6x1gSlKaa	i would say bad for a few reasons. <br>  1.it makes you think that you have to have your entire world revolve around one person, and god forbid anything happens to them, you have to go try and off yourself. (and i know she wasn't actually trying to kill herself but it was close enough).<br>  2.you should ignore your friends<br>  3.get married and have sex with the first person you fall in "love" with<br>  4. lust>love (they hardly know each other and their like "oh, i love you so much")<br>  a few more that i cant think of right now.<br>  <br>  but apart from that it did get a lot of girls reading, to bad it wasn't something better.<br>  <br>  EDIT- 5. not to use prtection of you ARE having sex.|`|fMzl8d4Zaa	the best!!!!<br>  <br>  Thanks for the <br>  |¨¨¨¨¨¨¨¨¨¨¨¨¨¨¨¨¨¨¨¨¨¨¨¨¨¨¨¨¨---<br>  |--------?--2 Points--?------|||"|""\__<br>  |__________________|||_|___|)<<br>  !(@)'(@)""""**!(@)(@)****!(@)|`|KtS7SUDWaa	Bad influence. Girls obsessing over some fictional guy and having their own fantasies about having their own Eddiekins. Edward however has all the characteristics of an abusive boyfriend. Bella and Edwards "love" is as fake as it will ever get. Who falls in love with a guy they don't know after a few hours? Edward watches Bella in her sleep and stalks her and girls start thinking that's so awesome of how he's so over protective of her. Bella is also a bad role model. In New Moon she gives up on life and goes into depression just because a guy dumped her. Boohoo. That is no reason to go suicidal and start jumping off cliffs. Personally, i think the books are sexist and give a horrible message to girls out there. Im 15 by the way. :)|`|xdInBhLRaa	I think it was an overall good experience, I was 17 when I read them, and it turn me some cult or anything lol. Just was an enjoyable book to read to pass the time.|`|9rEOY77raa	i think it's a bad influence because it makes preteen and teenage girls think they're reading real books|`|jqS0LQ01aa	im a teenage girl & it is a good influence. there's nothing bad in the series except for the occasional vampire violence but come on, we're teenage girls, i think we can handle that. ummm...yea, it's a good influence bcuz Bella doesnt do drugs or anything or that nature, she wouldnt have sex with Edward until after they were married, she doesnt do anything wrong. so yeeeaaa, theyre a good influence & great books =]|`|60S4vsBPaa	i think its a good story. any amount of violence involved isnt realyl bad, if you think of the history children are taught (i.e. the world wars and all that). <br>  <br>  if anything, the main character tries to keep the peace between the feuding characters (werewolves and vampires and humans), regardless of who they are. there can be some good lessons to be learned from the books, like 'it doesnt matter what you are, but what you do'. the Cullens are a very good example of that.|`|ftEYzAIEaa	i think its a great influence on everyone, it helps that stephanie meyer is an LDS and has values herself, and people will look up to her for that. Im lds as well and to read these books that have no swearing, drugs, sex before marriage is rare to come by in books, and the way she delivers them in the series is remarkable :)|`|hCG4HXEZaa	good because many girls can probally relate to it(not the whole vampire thing)<br>  bad because bella get really depressed over edward in the 2nd book and i suppose you could say that was a bad example of what to do after a break up|`|nqLGVMicaa	Guess it's a good influence because Bella and Edward don't have Sex before wedding and noone takes drugs and it sells high morals like treating your parents good and so on.|`|aucfmr07aa	good influence. they save their virtue and dont do anything wrong of bad. its all very soft and squishy. first love and all innocence. etc.<br>  enjoy reading!|`|sErY4py0aa	Good<br>  1. No one drinks or does drugs or anything close<br>  2. They wait for marriage to have sex<br>  3. And the worse curses in the books are Damn and Hell<br>  So It's a good influence!
i9orREV5aa	Charlie's answer is pretty darn good. You are probably just feeling a little self conscious. It happens to the best of us. To get over this feeling you need to stay in the moment and commit fully to the scene. If you don't believe it, the audience won't believe it.<br>  <br>  As actor's we have what is called a "third eye". It's the part of us that is constantly watching and judging us. You need to train your "third eye" to talk to you after the performance not during it. If you are judging yourself during the performance just keep going back to the text and focus on what your character is trying to say. Make eye contact with the other actors and use them to help pull you back into the scene.<br>  <br>  Recommended reading: Uta Hagen's "Respect for Acting", it's the actor's bible for many professionals.|`|yZ3CC9dVaa	People will take you seriously if you act with sincerity. I'm sure you're probably just worried. You will stop wondering what the audeince are thinking with time.<br>  <br>  But try reading some on Stanislavskis work. he had theories such as:<br>  "Units and objectives"<br>  "Emotion memory"<br>  "Circles of concentration"<br>  <br>  They are really great to get into character if your doing a naturalistic/realistic scene. Look the  up on google. I highly recommend.
nOFvdF9yaa	Yea, I have to agree with this concept since I'm another witness of this! Tough I had no fixed "aim in life" in my earlier days & my parents were too confused more or less. After school, when I was at college, my parents as well as I came to a decision...which means, I fixed an "aim in life" what is, in a way, "a parallel track" upon which one's life runs smoothly towards the destiny. I never thought that there could be so many invisible tracks indeed! Then the revolution happened in my country & a liberation war was there; the whole generation's life derailed perhaps including mine. I had to change my so-called 'aim in life' & had chosen absolutely opposite track-------a track I never ever imagined or never knew before. But it was there! That's why I do believe that there are several hidden tracks beside the visible, known parallel tracks of life.|`|1aa8b20a9151f0263c0e250dfc8c3448aa	That's an interesting concept...<br>  <br>  But, I would think life is more quantum...there are infinite possibilities, infinite number of tracks that run hither and yon, but all in a general 'forward' direction (the direction of time)...|`|cxDbdhELaa	Yes, we are always in danger of being derailed...worse yet, diverted to an errant track when we didn't even realize it's happened.|`|HORACAnlaa	A found once was I send onto the errand track called philosophy that I never could get back.|`|yOK32PM9aa	It is true in the sense that it is a metaphor or an analogy.  If it is useful, then it has truth.  But it is not the sort of proposition that is capable of proof or disproof.|`|XhrAjcilaa	I've actually had discussions with my friends about this.<br>  <br>  Changing tracks doesn't have to be a bad thing. Think of all the new sights you'll see. Your new track might intersect with someone else's who you might have never known.<br>  <br>  You can also argue that you're leaving a track before you reach a destination that would have been amazing, or that the new track might be one that your train breaks down on.<br>  <br>  Only the person who clear-headidly contemplates and then reaches the decision to change tracks can be assured that they made the right choice.
AA10832514	One of my ancestors was a slave owner.  He was a politician in Louisiana in the 1800's and while I was doing my genealogy, I found him.  I actually saw the images of the slave records online and they were chililng.  There were no names, period.  Just male and female.  It was a very sad moment for me to see that human beings were treated so badly.  Even my animals have names when my veterinarian keeps their records.<br>  <br>  So, a sad story about nameless slaves.  I know many of them took the former owner's names, but if it were I who had to choose, I would never have taken the enslaver's name.<br>  <br>  BTW, funny that you like Robert Downey Jr.  My name is F. Robert Downs Jr. HAH!|`|GZn5VNlSaa	Most were given by their slave masters. Most slaves were only called by their first name or any given name the master wanted to call them.<br>  They had no identity, they weren't consider full humans, i think there were consider 3/4s of a man, so that just goes to show they didn't have much to answer for.<br>  Williams and Smith are very British names that were certainly given to slaves.|`|Rf2r23sYaa	You'd have to trace each family to know. Some are slave names. Some are names chosen by the family itself. Also, there were free African people in the US and UK so they might have names like that too.|`|5cSD8mcZaa	I have heard as much, but then I live in the south.

This is a different book then the mini series. My son is a teen and im in my early 30's we really enjoyed the book, now my buddy and his son is reading it. This is the authors and first book of a series of three. My son found on the internet they are making a comic book character out of the Novel. <br>  <br>  from the website:<br>  <br>  Description:<br>  <br>       The story starts in Roma, Italy with a faithful priest of the Vatican, Abel, who has been in hiding for 20 years. His twin brother, Cain, a sinful genius who should have been dead years ago from cancer, finally finds him. He puts a threat on Abel’s life if he doesn’t find a hidden treasure of the Knights Templar's. The key to the secret is within the walls of the Vatican. A mysterious treasure hunt begins with Abel’s mentor, Father Mark. They embark on a twistful journey, finding out more than they should and a secret so great that the church itself does not know. The plot thickens as Abel wakes up on an island in the middle of nowhere where human cloning and human/animal mutations are performed and tested by Cain. Abel finds himself having to make the hardest decision based on his faith and the need for vengeance that tugs on his soul. Templar, one of the original nine Knight’s Templar’s, is found frozen in ice and is brought back to life, but not a life that God gave him, instead one of an abomination of man, due to Cain’s sinister ideas. With a remarkable historical run of excitement and gripping tales based on the bible, the battle begins between good and evil. Violence erupts as the stage for the Armageddon begins. As Templar gathers his team to battle evil, the Nephilim and Cain, the fallen angels raise their own armies...<br>  <br>  Back of book:<br>         “...Tracers zoomed by Templar just before one slammed dead center into his chest, sending him reeling head over heels 30 feet into the air. Landing on his back, he finally slid to a rest in the snow.  The 50 cal. went silent as everyone focused on the motionless body lying just outside the gates. Abel held his breath as he watched Templar lying there. Abel zoomed in on Templar’s chest to see the damage. What he saw blew his mind away; the wound was actually mending itself rapidly right before his eyes. Within seconds the injury was gone and the 50 cal. round slid off his chest...”<br>  <br>   <br>      Frozen and hidden by God over 700 years ago, Templar is now awakened to an unfamiliar world on the brink of annihilation. Already made perfect and powerful by God, his body has now been dramatically altered and endowed with mans’ greatest technologies.  He will need all the help he can get since his new assignment includes keeping mankind from destroying the world before God brings in the last judgment!<br>  Content copyright 2009.

He writes a similar style to King, but is more supernatural in nature than straight out horror, but he does write a lot of different styles that include a lot of the elements you are looking for. <br>  <br>  I would recommend starting with Odd Thomas, Watchers, Life Expectancy. For something a little darker, try The Bad Place or some of his older titles which tend to be a little more along the lines of horror. I also enjoyed The Husband and The Good Guy.<br>  <a href="http://www.fantasticfiction.co.uk/k/dean-r-koontz/" rel="nofollow">http://www.fantasticfiction.co.uk/k/dean...</a><br>  <br>  I also have enjoyed the Pendergast series by Douglas Preston and Lincoln Child. These are mystery/thrillers with some supernatural or slightly horror elements and I think the relationship between Pendergast and his arch-nemesis who also happens to be his brother is well done. This doesn't appear until the third or fourth book though.<br>  <a href="http://www.fantasticfiction.co.uk/p/douglas-j-preston/" rel="nofollow">http://www.fantasticfiction.co.uk/p/doug...</a><br>  <br>  If you haven't already read it, I would also recommend Silence of the Lambs by Thomas Harris. It is as good as, if not better than the movie and should be right up your road.<br>  <br>  If you like action/adventure, then I would also recommend the books of Matthew Reilly. Start with Ice Station or Seven Deadly Wonders, which are the first books in their respective series. If you like science fiction, then also try Contest.|`|gAWWyDLhaa	<a href="http://www.whatshouldireadnext.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.whatshouldireadnext.com</a>

My answer is the same.|`|yOK32PM9aa	Because it is the supreme example of setting your own selfish interests above those of another being who demands equal respect with you.|`|XhrAjcilaa	Because the only thing you're taking into consideration when killing someone are your own thoughts and feelings. You are completely disregarding the feelings, emotions, and relationships of the both the person you're killing and everyone they deal with in their everyday life.<br>  <br>  Anyone, not blinded by the rage of coming home to find your daughter being raped, who makes the conscious decision that their own desires surpass those of many others, is more than a killer; they're a monster.|`|fe37gfRvaa	'i can feel it in my hearth' is not a stupid childish answer. it would actually feel horrible to kill someone (no matter who are you). given the ammount of soldiers all around the world haunted by nightmares.

No, seriously.<br>  <br>  You may have asked this question before and people told you they thought it was wrong.  So that's one reason:  killing people makes other people mad at you.<br>  <br>  You may have been reading a law book and found it in there.  So that's another reason:  indiscriminately killing people will bring social justice down upon you and perhaps interfere with a well-functioning society.<br>  <br>  Perhaps a guru, psychologist, or priest told you.  In this regard, they are generally coming from the same place:  killing people can sometimes interfere with your spiritual progress and mental health.<br>  <br>  If you're paying really close attention, you'll note loopholes in most of those, however.  Perhaps.  May.  Can.  Religions have (and do) advocate killing, governments regularly do, and arguably if you don't kill SOMETHING you're going to have trouble finding food to eat.  It's not entirely cut-and-dried.|`|dwLqreuvaa	To us humans killing is wrong<br>  <br>  But generally speaking, killing is the way of life. Since our society is so develloped killing is looked down on. Eternally ending someones life is probably the most horrible thing you can do<br>  <br>  However, nature is based on life and death.<br>  <br>  Killing, dying, birth, so forth. I think it is MORALLY wrong, but it pretty much is what life is all about. <br>  <br>  I do not approove of killing in any way whatsoever :P|`|AA11488628	because if it was not wrong people would have to worry about being killed all the time and the world would drop into chaos as the paranoia would take over. people want to live, they want to fill safe and to do that we have to trust that most people are not out to kill us. that they have something keeping them from just waking up one morning and saying "i don't think my neighbor deserves to live anymore, he hasn't returned the lawnmower he borrowed two days ago" and then just walking into your house and killing you. it is the sanctity of human life and the belief that most (or all) people deserve to live that makes killing considered wrong. even when you know that if you hadn't killed them they would have killed you and everyone you love it still takes a piece of you and you always carry around that loss of having to take another persons life. ask police people and soldiers. they did what they had to do or what they were told to do but it still leaves scars that can never be taken away. that is why murder is wrong.|`|VPh0LR5Taa	killing is wrong because it is morally wrong and we should treat all human beings with respect, it is not our right to take away life, I feel this goes against our nature, as surely we are meant to create rather than destroy.|`|hQ95u9OLaa	Your question demands some answers that I'm not capable of answering.

The effect is named for Tinker Bell, the fairy in the play Peter Pan who is revived from near death by the belief of the audience.<br>  <br>  Some cases of the Tinkerbell effect include:<br>  <br>      * monetary system<br>      * the value of a nation's money in a fiat system<br>      * civil society<br>      * the "rule of law"<br>  <br>  This also applies when establishing what is wrong and right in a society. So, killing is wrong simply because most people agree that it is.|`|150ffcb711824f9fc3252407402a28adaa	Theoretically, killing is not always wrong and it is only judged right or wrong based on  the usefulness of the act. If a kill brings more benefit than mental, emotional and physical pain, it is right. However, there is hardly any case in history that proves this - even the death penalty for hard criminals doesn't really produce anything useful, just a waste of life, men-power and budgets. Basically, killing is wrong most of all because it almost always brings more grief and anger than it benefits the killer.|`|aA0Mcivaaa	If the only way to save your own life was by killing, I'd consider it acceptable.<br>  <br>  <br>  Killiing (a human) is wrong because you're prematurely ending theirr  existence (usually causing pain) and causing others pain while doing so.  You are removing potential paths of action and lives from the future.  It is not your place to determine when someone else's life should end.<br>  <br>  No one has the right to take it upon themselves to take another person's life. Only God can create life, so all life belongs to Him. Therefore, only God has the right to take life. Read The Ten Commandments, one of which is "Thou Shalt Not Kill". The life of a person is precious is so many ways, and to take that life destroys, and forever changes the lives of all who loved that person. It is also against the law to take another person's life|`|2KFf4iXcaa	Technically it is because the masses have deemed "cos it just is"<br>  <br>  Please let me elaborate. The answers that have so far been given have mostly been like this. I don't think that they are wrong at all i greatly agree. Nowhere in the universe is there a rulebook. Life is a blank slate. <br>  <br>  People have deemed killing to be wrong. Since there is no rulebook apart from the holy texts, what is stopping us from writing the rules ourselves? Through history there has been justified killings, back to the Viking days of the blood feud and in more modern times the death penalty. A killing is wrong because we the people have elected governments which hold this to be true. These governments have made it law, on the authority of the people. <br>  <br>  Its a bit of a lame duck answer, but in all honesty of my own opinion, i believe that to be true|`|DFwvcUnhaa	Who said killing was wrong? If you're referring to sixth commandment "though shalt not kill" the original hebrew text actually means "though shalt not murder". Justifiable homicide is condoned worldwide. Slaughtering food animals is necessary as long as we eat meat, who in their right mind would depend on road kill? I've killed a rabid dog. I don't think that was wrong. I've dispatched two of my own dogs, both dying of cancer and unable to eat or even get up anymore.<br>  (I couldn't afford to have the vet give them a shot.) One of the hardest things I've ever had to do.|`|5mb1bnvxaa	coz it just is <br>  i can feel it in my heart,,,<br>  <br>  <br>  ok, i'm just messing with you... I feel it is wrong 1st because it says in the bible that it is wrong, but if you don't believe in the bible, then that's probably a "stupid, childish answer" for you too. So my 2nd reason is that you didn't create that life, it's not your's to take away... It's God's judgement on when someone dies or lives... That's what I think...|`|vKOnv7WZaa	because your taking someone else's life. no consequence should be killing someone. you can put them in prison and make them wish they were dead. but don't take their life away. people want to live life to the fullest because, after death they don't know what is to come. killing is selfish, because their not putting themselves in the victim's shoes.|`|Y7pmpyokaa	I believe that only who gave life is the only who can take it. I don't see myself ending such a huge thing called life of another. I think it's injustice. I'm even sorry i don't have such great answer for your question. Excuse me.|`|Xzdyz8Kiaa	I do not kill because of the Sixth Commandment listed in the Bible.<br>  <br>  Those that do not believe in God and cross me fail to realize their life has been spared due to the very bible they do not believe in.|`|ebLbJWlFaa	"What do you mean 'why'?

Ow3O7h4caa	One of the best exercise for pull-offs and hammer-ons and to strengthen the endurance is this one played on every string.<br>  Ex..<br>  <br>  Put index on 5th fret 1st string, pluck the string only once. Hold the note.<br>  Now, hammer the 6th fret with middle finger . Hold it .  Now pull your finger dowward. (pull-off)<br>  Now, hammer the 7th fret with the middle finger. Hold it. Pull -off <br>  Now  , hammer the 8th fret with gthe pinky. Hold it. Pull-off<br>  Now, hammer the 7th fret with the middle finger. Hold it. Pull -off <br>  now, hammer the 6th fret with middle finger . Hold it .  Now pull-off.<br>  <br>  I explained it slow so you can comprehend. This is how it is played.<br>  <br>  1-2-1-3-1-4-1-3-1-2 . Do this on all strings.<br>  <br>  Once you mastered this correctly, you will have strengthened all your fingers equally .<br>  <br>  If you want more dexterity, do this fingering with alternate-picking.<br>  <br>  1-2-1-2-3-2-3-4 and backward 4-3-4-3-2-3-2-1<br>  <br>  If you want to practicing your slides, this exercise will help you especially when doing long riff and tying 2 or 3 scales together across the fingerboard.<br>  <br>  1-2-3-4_4 and 4-3-2-1_1<br>  <br>  The underscore means to slide to the nex fret going up, and then, slide with the index going down. Here, you alternate pick only the first 4 note and not the slide.<br>  <br>  Good Luck.|`|577076a28e3180e6d74e269d0d346d57aa	Practice doing them. Only way. You have to have you finger fretting a note behind the note you are pulling off, so you pull of the string and the other note fretted takes over. It's really not that difficult - I suspect you might be doing them wrong.<br>  <br>  <br>  One exercise is to start on the low E, alternate pick it 4 times. On each pick, hammer onto the fret, and keep ALL frets held down. Just keep hammering onto the next fret each time. Alternate pick four more times, and on each pick, pull off. Repeat on the A string, then the D, then G, etc. Go back down from the high E to the low E, doing the exercise again, and then, start at the 1st fret instead of the 0 fret and repeat the process.

There are a few flaws in your plot though, for 1. cops don't go after assasins, they write parking tickets. The girl should be in the cia/fbi, I think cia is the one that deals with problems out of the country. Something alonge those lines, but not a cop. A cop could never catch a top assasin. Another is this guy is a good guy right? He kills people that deserve to die, so why would he be able to do that, but then take out a ton of innocent people just because his family was killed? And wouldn't he go after the people who killed his family before anyone else? <br>  For the meaning behind your book, I think follow your head/heart is over-rated and cliche. It should come down to wether she can justify him killing people, wether or not they are good or bad. Lastly, I hope you've been to Italy, because describing a good setting in a country you've never been to would be hard.

I've been dancing for a long time, and not only will your legs get toned and muscular, but so will your arms and abs.<br>  I recommend taking ballet first, but I think it can get boring sometimes.

Really, any form of dance is great exercise, but ballet is supposed to build up your leg muscles. <br>  <br>  But caution: if ballet isn't done correctly, it can seriously hurt your body. You should plan on receiving training from a trained professional. Ballet dancers have great skill, but they work hard to achieve it.|`|rrpTvQVkaa	I'm 16 now and have been doing Ballet since I was three. That's perfect if you want to tone your legs because that is exactly what Ballet will do for you. It will mostly muscle up your calf muscles but it also strengthens your knees and ankles.

CxeirMvpaa	There are a couple of things you can do including: stretching, nutrition and breathing.<br>  <br>  Stretching: (Most Important)<br>  2-4 times per day-- morning, night, before and after class:<br>  1) take thirty seconds to stretch out each of you calves<br>  2) take another 30 seconds to stretch and/or massage your feet (with tennis ball or by hand)<br>  <br>  Nutrition:<br>  Replace electrolytes.  Muscle cramping can be caused by low levels of electrolytes (Sodium, Potassium, Magnesium, Calcium and others).  Food is the best source of electrolytes, but since many dancers restrict calories while neglecting to eat nutrient dense foods they can become nutrient deficient.  <br>  <br>  If this is the case for you focus on cutting out processed foods and getting more dark green veggies and berries into your diet and/or take a mineral and multivitamin supplement.  Sports drinks are another option, but not the healthiest choice.<br>  <br>  Breathing:<br>  Low oxygen levels can lead to muscle cramping.  Be sure to breath deep into your belly.  Maintaining alignment during ballet sometimes causes dancers to restrict their breathing.<br>  <br>  Finally, your foot may simply need to take a break (have you increased  your number of classes lately?).  Consider skipping one class and spend the time massaging and stretching your feet, calves and legs.  If none of this works check with a physician to be sure you are injury free.|`|gXB8snqEaa	make sure you eat lots of potassium, stretch before, during, after class, roll your foot on something round (the bottom of a barre, a hard water bottle)|`|vA9b1bOPaa	i have the same problem all the time. cramps are easiest to get when your body is low on potassium. the easiest way to stop cramping, eat a banana!<br>  good luck|`|Kc3VDgusaa	When I get cramps I usually roll my feet on the end of the barre where the round part is. Or you can get one of those massagy ball things those feel very nice on cramped feet.|`|dDPEnNMBaa	Unfortunately foot cramps are a good thing it means that you are pointing your foot correctly and that you are really working your muscles. I find that flexing it as much as I can and slowly rolling through to a pointed foot helps but if it doesn't I massage it out of my foot like the ball does!|`|VQLJrTKCaa	nope there is no way that i know of. my friends get it a lot (i'm assuming you're talking about your arch cramping up) but i rarely ever have it happen to me. it's a sign that you are working your arch hard, or if you don't get it often (but still have a fully pointed foot), that you have a strong arch.

aA0Mcivaaa	a prima facie duty is a duty that is binding (obligatory) other things equal, that is, unless it is overridden or trumped by another duty or duties. Another way of putting it is that where there is a prima facie duty to do something, there is at least a fairly strong presumption in favor of doing it...duties are.....<br>  fidelity<br>  harm prevention<br>  benefience<br>  self improvement<br>  justice<br>  respect for freedom<br>  care  <br>  non parasitism.....<br>  reparation<br>  gratitude<br>  non injury<br>  <br>  <br>  If you are carrying a heavy load into a building and a passer by holds the door open for you, you can see immediately that an expression of gratitude is in order. (You are directly applying the relevant prima facie duty where it is applicable and discovering your actual duty in the circumstances.) <br>  <br>  If you are an able-bodied passer-by not carrying anything yourself and you notice someone trying to carry a heavy load into a building, you might see immediately that you ought to hold the door open for him or her. (You would be directly applying the prima facie duty of beneficence.) <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  I enjoyed researching this.  I learnd a lot... thanks|`|rhndIQoWaa	It might help to think of prima facie duties vs. proper moral duties.  A proper moral duty is an absolute obligation that one has to do the right thing at all times.  Ross criticized this absolute obligation because he believed that one's moral duties were dependent on the surrounding factors.  So while a proper moral duty may seem extremely important in one situation, it may lose its absoluteness in another.  That is where prima facie duties come into play.  A prima facie duty is a conditional moral duty, and one's obligation to fulfill that moral duty depends on the situation one is in.<br>  <br>  One prima facie duty is fidelity (keeping promises, agreements, loyalty) and another is nonmaleficence (duty not to injure others).  Both of these prima facie duties you should try to fulfill the best you can, however, there are circumstances when that is not possible.  For example, you promise your friend to lend you her car and keep it a secret.  Later on you somehow find out that your friend used your car to kidnap someone.  Your prima facie duty of nonmaleficence trumps your prima facie duty of fidelity in this case because it is obviously more important to keep someone from harm than to keep a secret.

Look at the benches, roof supports, light fixtures, decorative trim, etc. The shapes of those objects will form letters.

d7c8ecd624fbbc0797b1502ba6682e8baa	A dire need. What people don't seem to realize is that fields are grounded in philosophy. When any new field of inquiry is founded, it is primarily a philosophical issue to decide the subject matter, scope and means of interpreting data within that field. As the field develops, philosophy is needed to evaluate any necessary corrections, additions, etc., to the existing methodology. This is why, for instance, we have a "philosophy of science". To make the point clear, think of the highest degree one can receive in most fields - a PhD., a "doctor of philosophy".|`|VPh0LR5Taa	Someone who can't get a job.|`|ot6OJ7JWaa	One who thinks the deeper questions, instead of living a shallow, questionless life.|`|ql5xUxXqaa	Agreed.<br>  They are either professors or jobless.

Try to access the muscles just above your quads. It will probably be difficult at first, but those are the muscles that actually flex the hip. Also, just an image to explore, think about the back of the leg lifting (your hamstrings.) This isn't was is actually happening, but I find that it helps me just to think that way.

ZmdIlkpQaa	There's been only some simulated (perhaps) hanky-panky between them once, in an episode where they were undercover (haha) pretending to be a married pair opf professional assassins.  In the end, it seems unlikely that there will be a scripted romance between them, just as the previous romances between Abbie and Tim and Gibbs and Jenny never panned out and are refered to only tangentally.  The program is not a soap opera, and the writers and producers have clearly decided that romantic entanglements between the main characters would detract from the message and the popularity of the program.<br>  <br>  I suggest writing some fan fic, however, as I think there's a lot of potential for humor and surprises in such a relationship.|`|S01zIagOaa	No they do not. Since Season 7 hasn't happened yet, it means there are no scripts yet and therefore no one, not even the producers/writers know whether they will take the relationship to a conclusive direction. <br>  <br>  That's how they keep you watching.

kacLYFrHaa	Well the most obvious similarities are the discovery of gold and the fact that miners arrived in droves hoping to make their fortunes. The most obvious difference is location. But of course these are the most obvious people would immediately think of.<br>  <br>  Another similarity is that towns tended to spring up around where the miners based their operations. That's not to say that the miners necessarily lived in the towns themselves. The towns would have been near enough to the gold fields that new miners to those fields would pass through the town on the way to the fields. While in the town they'd be likely to purchase the equipment and supplies they'd need in the fields. Then once they had set up at the spot they would be mining for gold they'd be likely to return to the town every now and again to get new supplies. If they managed to find any gold they'd also have to return to the town to have an assayer to test the quality of the gold and confirm it really was gold and not pyrite. Not everyone knows the difference between pyrite, or fool's gold as it is also known due to it's appearance to gold, and gold so the miner's couldn't make the claim that the place they found a gold-like substance was actually a claim if it was not confirmed to be gold. <br>  <br>  Another similarity was the fear of claim jumpers. Claim jumpers were other miners who would move in to a miners claim, especially if it were bearing cold, to take the gold out from under the person to discover the gold. They could get a little gold either from actual mining themselves in an area that really didn't produce enough could to support staking a claim to it or through other methods such as stealing it or purchasing it and then use it as "proof" they were the first to find the gold there and thus stake a claim before the rightful discoverer coukld do so.

I am 15 years old I reside in a dazzling planet called surge. My planet has buildings floating in the thin air like a surfboard floating on water.<br>  It has hover busses skimming form building to building like a frog hopping from lily pad to lily pad. I live the normal lifestyle of a normal adult here in surge in the year 9009. Did you know that in 2009, for example no one was an adult18 years old!? I think that’s a really long time to become an adult. Well, it would be for a mortal. On surge top medical scientists have figured out the way to live forever. All you he to do is take 3 shots when a patient is 21-years-old (unless, of course, he/she wanted to top aging sooner). I have luminous lime green hair and glowing lime green hair to match. Of course, I wasn’t born that way. Once you are an adult you can change anything imaginable. Such as your status on superpowers, if you don’t have them you can buy them. If you don’t like your sister all you have to do is change the fact that se is your sister.<br>  <br>   Surge is the only planet in the galaxy that’s not ruled by a government. We sergians can take care of ourselves much better than humans did before they grew extinct. Although we can decide for our selves what is wrong and what is right. <br>   Surge is mostly huge neon city’s. We have no actual climate here. The weather is on your own eyes, and your thoughts control your climate. When you think happy thoughts you will likely feel warmth in the air.for example, there may be times when you are walking down the street wearing drenched clothing; that person is probably thinking sad thoughts. Also, there is no day in Surge, for me that is, because I am I night owl. I do not sleep (due to a surgery I had that takes them chemical out of my body that makes me tired.) because I think I have more fun, important, things to do. In my eyes all I see is darkness.<br>  <br>  From hearing this I bet your would like  to know my daily (or should I say nightly) schedule. Well, here it is(it comes in this order. There is no such thing as time to me because I have already had my shots. I don’t age):<br>  Usually I swim on Neptune.<br>  Then I explore the planets. I haven’t explored all 186 of them yet. But I don’t have a time limit.<br>  Then I go back to my hover house and talk to friends, hang out, as they used to say.<br>  <br>   I live in a normal hover house like most people. It has about nine bedrooms. My houses color vary depending on my moods. If I am jovial my house will be bright green or yell, may be pink. If I am sad it is blue. If I’m angry its red and so on. Everything in my house hovers.<br>  <br>   I am usually transported by my hover car. Sometimes I just take my hover board because I love the feeling of being alone and thinking about everything while my hair is peacefully blowing in the soft breeze behind me.<br>  <br>  I hope you like my planet. <br>  <br>  By:<br>          Amari Glitch <br>  (Krysti Womack)

Even though I am still hyped about the DVD and New Moon movie. The ending of the last book drove me nuts and I can't wait to find out what happens next.<br>  <br>  The Morganville Vampire series—This series is pure amazingness. Love, Love, Love it! It’s really at a tie with House of Night with amazingness.<br>   <br>  Vampire Academy series--I just finished this and I can't wait for the next one! It was awesome and totally made me cry like a million time and make me angry. It sure does keep you on your toes.<br>  <br>  Evermore by Alyson Noel- Very interesting. I could not put it down!<br>  <br>  Evernight by Claudia Gray- very awesome vampire books…very very addicting and I cannot wait for the next. It’s like a WAY better version of Twilight.<br>  <br>  Society of S—This book is very interesting. I believe it may be an adult book, but I’m not sure. It’s about a thirteen year old girl, but her vocabulary and English is advanced. It’s a good read though.<br>  <br>  Peeps—very interesting (in a guys point of view.)<br>  <br>  Vampire Kisses—This series begins sort of slow for my liking, but I really began to like it. <br>  <br>  Someone Like You by Sarah Dessen—awesome book!<br>  <br>  The Gallagher Girls series is interesting...It's about a girl that goes to spy school. The first book is "I'd tell you I love you, but then I'd have to kill you".<br>  <br>  The two books I actually enjoyed reading in school were Speak and Holes. Speak is a really good book.<br>  <br>  A few other books I have read recently and enjoyed are: Kissing Kate, The Bermudez Triangle, and Empress of the World.<br>  <br>  Vampire Chronicles by Anne Rice.<br>  <br>  Some series that others have told me to read that are in the Young Adult/ Supernatural genre are: The Mortal Instruments series, Darkest Powers series,  Maxium Ride, The Vampire Diaries, The Uglies series, Chronicles of Narnia, Blue Bloods, Sookie Stackhouse series, and Sweep series.<br>  <br>  <br>  Then these more classical books: anything Jane Austen, To Kill a Mockingbird, Wuthering Heights, Great Expectations, Jane Eyre, Little Women, Odyssey, The Scarlet Letter, and Treasure Island.

40c85b996c134163f45223b2c362cd80aa	Historians refer to three kinds of sources:<br>  <br>  Primary sources - archeological finds and records left by the Norse themselves.<br>  <br>  Secondary sources - what other people wrote about the Norse.  This includes things like the Anglo-Saxon Chronicles, the Irish Annals, Frankish histories, and the writings of Ibn Faladan (who took a trip from Baghdad up the Volga river to visit a Ruser viking tribe).  It also included things the decendents of the Norse wrote after the end of the Viking Age.<br>  <br>  Tertiary sources - things people have written about or based on either the primary or secondary sources.  This includes all the books written about the Viking Age in the 20th century.<br>  <br>  As to which sources to trust, a good rule of thumb is look at how much the various sources agree with each other.  Then you have to look at potential bias (in the secondary sources).  For instance Faladan describes the Norse as being "dirty" because they washed their faces in basins of water.  However, he was a Arab who considered the only "clean" water to be running water.  English sources record the same behaviour but then described the Norse as being "vain" because they washed more frequently than the English did.  Finally the Norse records talk about the importance of being well groomed.  It's possible they give an "ideal" that not everyone lived up to, but putting the three together we can safely conclude that the Norse washed their faces frequently (the thing all three agree on) and suppose from that that they were careful about their appearance in general.  When you add to this the number of grooming implements (like tweezers, small sissors, earspoons, etc) found in Norse archeological sites (a primary source), this supposition becomes even more solid.<br>  <br>  I hope this helps.|`|oBmLIDHtaa	There is a ton of evidence to support the existence of vikings, including (but not limited to) the remains of viking ships, armor/helmets, and weapons.|`|V9qmbFQOaa	There are so many great websites and books.

40c85b996c134163f45223b2c362cd80aa	I would say there are three:<br>  <br>  1) Dumb, brutal barbarians<br>  <br>  2) Brave, courageous adventurers<br>  <br>  3) Complex, civilized society<br>  <br>  <br>  The first is a common stereotype based on a un-filtered reading of certain medieval sources written by either the Norsemen's (a better term than "viking") enemies or the targets of their raids.  For example the famous prayer, "From the fury of the North Men, Lord protect us!"<br>  <br>  The second is the highly romanticized view popularized in the 19th century when the Norse sagas where being re-discovered and translated.  This view glosses over both a lot of the dark side of Norse culture and it's conflicts.<br>  <br>  The third is the more scholarly view prevalent today.  It is based on a centuries's worth of examination of the archelogical evidence and also a closer reading of the Sagas and other documents (poetry, treaties, legal texts, etc.) left the the Norse from the Viking Age (late 8th-mid 11th centuries).

YupMCYHlaa	Yes, monologists were very common in Vaudeville, leading up to the more recent tradition of stand-up comedy.  Usually they were character monologues, delivered in a comical accent or dialect.  There were Germans, Swedes, blacks, Jews, Southerners, and country hicks who came to the big city and were amazed at common things.  Of course stereotypes were more popular back then.<br>  <br>  Did you ever hear of Uncle Josh?  He was played by a guy named Cal Stewart.  He made dozens, maybe hundreds of records back in the early years of the 20th century. He was a hick from a town called Pumpkin Center somewhere in New England.<br>  <br>  Also Will Rogers was famous for monologues.  He was in the Ziegfeld Follies, and he would dress as a cowboy and twirl a rope while he talked, but he could also do just a speech.  Later, he would set an alarm clock for 45 minutes and just begin, and he'd talk off the top of his head until the clock went off.

ceBTTCPwaa	The Grapes of Wrath is a novel published in 1939 and written by John Steinbeck, who was awarded the Pulitzer Prize and the Nobel Prize for Literature. It is frequently read in American high school and college literature classes. A celebrated Hollywood film version, starring Henry Fonda and directed by John Ford, was made in 1940; however, the endings of the book and the movie differ greatly.<br>  <br>  Steinbeck wrote The Grapes of Wrath at his home, 16250 Greenwood Lane, in what is now Monte Sereno, California. Set during the Great Depression, the novel focuses on a poor family of sharecroppers, the Joads, driven from their home by drought, economic hardship, and changes in the agriculture industry. In a nearly hopeless situation, they set out for California's Central Valley along with thousands of other "Okies" in search of land, jobs, and dignity.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.sparknotes.com/lit/grapesofwr..." rel="nofollow">http://www.sparknotes.com/lit/grapesofwr...</a><br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.novelguide.com/TheGrapesofWra..." rel="nofollow">http://www.novelguide.com/TheGrapesofWra...</a><br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.cliffsnotes.com/WileyCDA/LitN..." rel="nofollow">http://www.cliffsnotes.com/WileyCDA/LitN...</a><br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.novelguide.com/TheGrapesofWra..." rel="nofollow">http://www.novelguide.com/TheGrapesofWra...</a><br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.pinkmonkey.com/booknotes/monk..." rel="nofollow">http://www.pinkmonkey.com/booknotes/monk...</a><br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.gradesaver.com/ClassicNotes/T..." rel="nofollow">http://www.gradesaver.com/ClassicNotes/T...</a><br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.pinkmonkey.com/booknotes/barr..." rel="nofollow">http://www.pinkmonkey.com/booknotes/barr...</a><br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.bookwolf.com/Free_Booknotes/G..." rel="nofollow">http://www.bookwolf.com/Free_Booknotes/G...</a><br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.awerty.com/grapes2.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.awerty.com/grapes2.html</a>|`|xJoMSkI5aa	On a broader scale, it's important that the action takes place during the Great Depression. Accordingly, the people that populate this novella are mostly all poor and desperate for work. Because of the poverty and general tough times caused by the Depression, the characters have good reason to be suspicious and distrusting of each other, feeling that there isn't enough food, money, and work to go around.<br>  <br>  If you wanted to think creatively, this air of distrust and isolation is central to the American Depression and seems to be a set piece in this work. The friendship between Lennie and George seems all the more remarkable set against this backdrop, and the end of the friendship means that distrust and isolation will be certain to crush whatever happiness either of them might have had.<br>  <br>  From Shmoop/Of MIce and Men|`|vlCWp7sSaa	The general theme of the book is that they really do not have a home, and that they dream of having a home one day.

OhWmu0R3aa	During the reign of Edward VI the Henrician Reformation was carried through to its logical conclusion when the English Church adopted protestantism with the introduction of the First Book of Common Prayer (1549), compiled by Thomas Cranmer, Archbishop of Canterbury.<br>  <br>  To continue the succession of a protestant crown, Edward willed the throne to Lady Jane Grey, the granddaughter of Henry VIII's sister and fellow protestant, when he discovered he was dying. However, this was at the connivance of the Duke of Northumberland (the Lord Protector) who was Lady Jane Grey's father-in-law. She was proclaimed queen on Edward's death, but Northumberland's scheme fell flat when neither the Lords or Commons would accept her and declared for the rightful heir, Mary, a catholic. Jane, her husband and Northumberland were all executed.

Maycomb is suffering through the Great Depression, but Atticus is a prominent lawyer and the Finch family is reasonably well off in comparison to the rest of society. One summer, Jem and Scout befriend a boy named Dill, who has come to live in their neighborhood for the summer, and the trio acts out stories together. Eventually, Dill becomes fascinated with the spooky house on their street called the Radley Place. The house is owned by Mr. Nathan Radley, whose brother, Arthur (nicknamed Boo), has lived there for years without venturing outside.<br>   <br>  <br>  Scout goes to school for the first time that fall and detests it. She and Jem find gifts apparently left for them in a knothole of a tree on the Radley property. Dill returns the following summer, and he, Scout, and Jem begin to act out the story of Boo Radley. Atticus puts a stop to their antics, urging the children to try to see life from another person's perspective before making judgments. But, on Dill's last night in Maycomb for the summer, the three sneak onto the Radley property, where Nathan Radley shoots at them. Jem loses his pants in the ensuing escape. When he returns for them, he finds them mended and hung over the fence. The next winter, Jem and Scout find more presents in the tree, presumably left by the mysterious Boo. Nathan Radley eventually plugs the knothole with cement. Shortly thereafter, a fire breaks out in another neighbor's house, and during the fire someone slips a blanket on Scout's shoulders as she watches the blaze. Convinced that Boo did it, Jem tells Atticus about the mended pants and the presents.<br>   <br>  To the consternation of Maycomb's racist white community, Atticus agrees to defend a black man named Tom Robinson, who has been accused of raping a white woman. Because of Atticus's decision, Jem and Scout are subjected to abuse from other children, even when they celebrate Christmas at the family compound on Finch's Landing. Calpurnia, the Finches' black cook, takes them to the local black church, where the warm and close-knit community largely embraces the children.<br>   <br>  Atticus's sister, Alexandra, comes to live with the Finches the next summer. Dill, who is supposed to live with his “new father” in another town, runs away and comes to Maycomb. Tom Robinson's trial begins, and when the accused man is placed in the local jail, a mob gathers to lynch him. Atticus faces the mob down the night before the trial. Jem and Scout, who have sneaked out of the house, soon join him. Scout recognizes one of the men, and her polite questioning about his son shames him into dispersing the mob.<br>   <br>  At the trial itself, the children sit in the “colored balcony” with the town's black citizens. Atticus provides clear evidence that the accusers, Mayella Ewell and her father, Bob, are lying: in fact, Mayella propositioned Tom Robinson, was caught by her father, and then accused Tom of rape to cover her shame and guilt. Atticus provides impressive evidence that the marks on Mayella's face are from wounds that her father inflicted; upon discovering her with Tom, he called her a whore and beat her. Yet, despite the significant evidence pointing to Tom's innocence, the all-white jury convicts him. The innocent Tom later tries to escape from prison and is shot to death. In the aftermath of the trial, Jem's faith in justice is badly shaken, and he lapses into despondency and doubt.<br>   <br>  Despite the verdict, Bob Ewell feels that Atticus and the judge have made a fool out of him, and he vows revenge. He menaces Tom Robinson's widow, tries to break into the judge's house, and finally attacks Jem and Scout as they walk home from a Halloween party. Boo Radley intervenes, however, saving the children and stabbing Ewell fatally during the struggle. Boo carries the wounded Jem back to Atticus's house, where the sheriff, in order to protect Boo, insists that Ewell tripped over a tree root and fell on his own knife. After sitting with Scout for a while, Boo disappears once more into the Radley house.<br>   <br>  <br>  Later, Scout feels as though she can finally imagine what life is like for Boo. He has become a human being to her at last. With this realization, Scout embraces her father's advice to practice sympathy and understanding and demonstrates that her experiences with hatred and prejudice will not sully her faith in human goodness.<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  *Its all on sparknotes.

A lot of people copy without verifying. The information can be useful as clues only as to where to get the documentation.<br>  <br>  Right before Christmas of 2008, I found out I was dead. So was my sister and my brother-in-law. We died in New Jersey. Since the only time my sister and I were ever in New Jersey is when our family drove through it coming from New York in 1957. It was the same year Hurricane Audrey hit in our part of the world. Hey! we had been dead for 51 years. It says so on the internet. It has to be right if it is on the internet!<br>  <br>  I found out that family on both sides married and died in New Jersey. Since my ancestry is mostly southern American colonial with some exceptions and those exceptions came in through southern ports, I was surprised.<br>  <br>  This tree would have been accepted by any genealogy website. You can make up an entirely fictitious family tree and it will be accepted. You disagree with something someone has on one of your family members, the websites will tell you that it is between you and the other subscriber.<br>  <br>  Now the best for the total amount of records online isn't free but your public library might have a subscription to it. That is Ancestry.Com. Still be careful about the information in their family trees.<br>  <br>  CyndisList.com is a website with links to many other websites, some free and some not. Many people involved in genealogy find it helpful.<br>  <br>  Not all records are online but the ones you will find will save you time and money traveling to courthouses, libraries etc.<br>  <br>  However your first free source is your own family. Get information from them. Tape your senior members if they will let you. People who do this state they go back and listen to the tape again after doing research and hear things they didn't hear the first time around. I am not saying they won't be confused or wrong on some things.<br>  <br>  Find out if anybody in your family has any old family bibles. Ask to see and make copies of birth, marriage and death certificates. Depending on the religious faith, baptismal, first communion, confirmation and marriage certificates from their church can be helpful.<br>  <br>  A good free source is a Family History Center at a Latter Day Saints(Mormon) Church. They have records on people all over the world, not just Mormons. In Salt Lake City, they have the world's largest genealogical collection. Their FHCs can order microfilm for you to view at a nominal fee.<br>  <br>  They won't try to convert you, at least they haven't done so to me or anyone else that I know. Just call the nearest Mormon Church or visit their free website, FamilySearch.org, to get their hours for the general public.<br>  <br>  Rootsweb and FamilySearch.org are 2 free sites but remember verify information in family trees with documents/records. If you don't you don't know whether it is accurate or not.|`|31e3aeeef48254ed515aa846df344c44aa	As Ted and that angelic person person said, your local library MAY have subscriptions to the databases you need, that you can use from their internet-enabled computers.

The emperors oversaw much of the GREATS (government, religion, economy, arts + architecture, technology, society) and made the decisions that related to those topics. <br>  The emperors basically where the difference between a successful China and a dying China. <br>  Hope it helps!

lGS54cfxaa	It sounds like something I would read. As for my opinion on a name, I would have something simple like “Labeled.” Of course, that's only an example. You could come up with a million of other names, and some you'll find a perfect one that both matches and is brilliant. But, yes, I would definitely read it.<br>  <br>  And I would definitely start before the beginning so that people understand that this private school is different. Start with her in class and telling her classmates (not just a select few friends because that would contradict your story) before it that she's going to be going to another school.<br>  <br>  If this helps, I had a friend who transferred from private to public. When he told people in his old school about it, a lot of the girls wanted to go out with him only because of he would be going to public, and the people at the public wanted to know him pretty well so that they got an idea of what his old school was like.|`|Nngdk0izaa	That's a cool plot; I'd read it! Your plot just explains how things are to some kids going to public schools in real life, and some people can actually relate to the main character in that kind of book you're in the process of making. The title Labeling and Grouping just reminds me of how packages are divided into different airplanes...|`|AA12257579	im not good with titles (i write songs and some stories) so save that until you finish writing. or leave it untitled. OMG, "UNTITLED" should be the title. think about it, that's the thing she strives for is a high school society that is untitled. no cliques and all that.<br>  <br>  name the girl after someone you respect, a friend, yourself, a name you like, whatever.<br>  <br>  plot suggestion that i think would be cool but you don't need to follow- in her infinite moping around about how much public school sucks, she should meet up with her private school friends (after she's started the book club) and realizes that they've changed too and they're not the people she thought they were. the whole conformity/ labeling deal applies to everyone.<br>  <br>  great idea, good luck!|`|l9Xg8Dv4aa	Sure! Go for it! Remember to bring in characters that support the story. The plain girl who has been cast out of the "cliques" avoided by the " Jocks" and teased by the " cheer leaders"<br>  She befriends your Star character, bring in a few bullies, Have a Football Captain who finally comes to the realization that this is actually a good idea.......and so on, however you want to work it.|`|EEbIKHTMaa	Well, everyone likes a feelgood story but I'd be careful to give my heroine a flaw or two, otherwise she will come across as a saint, and completely unbelievable.  Not to mention irritating.  Maybe have her act like a bit of brat at home, in reaction to the general stress the lack of money is causing her family.  Maybe her focus on changing her new school means she neglects her old friends.  Something anyway.|`|hxcg0Rlkaa	It actually sounds quite interesting to me. I think I would give it a try! Good luck.|`|Dj7C8yO5aa	no. this sounds soo overdone.|`|lzYgTtN6aa	I think it sounds really interesting. Add lots of adventure and mischief into it and it should be a good book for pre-teens. You made it unique in the way you made the girl from private school nice and trying to help everyone. Usually, people would see the girl from the private school as a b*tchy, mean, spoiled, bitter person who would look down on everyone else. You made her different. That's good. Good luck on your book =)|`|9YUmSw62aa	that sounds interesting.<br>  i would read it.<br>  girls name Rogue its a beutiful name.it means some1 seperate from the herd/someone whos set apart from normal order so it kinda suits.<br>  try making it very emotional in everyway.<br>  good luck.<br>  xox<br>  <br>  oh and javis suggestion about "omg untitled" is great|`|LXWWbZNAaa	i think it sounds pretty good|`|elOFZo1uaa	I personally don't like books like that but lots of people do so it's a good plot. The only thing that's wrong with it is that no school is like that. I've gone to private school all my life and some private schools are worse with labeling people than public schools. People are not all friends with each other and accepting no matter where you go. Maybe you could make it so that the people are MORE accepting and there aren't so many cliques or something. But a school where everyone's friends and accepts you for who you are just doesn't exist. That'd be great if it did but it doesn't. Sorry.
xoJZ3sqZaa	i've sung this song during a solo recital, and everyone seemed to enjoy it:)<br>  My advice to you, is that you listen to this song ALOT. there may be versions of this song available on itunes, if you have an ipod, or just sing it to yourself all of the time. What i do is practice everyday, and since I go to a preforming arts school, I practice there. but if you don't go to that kind of school, just stick with this: 'practice makes permanent!' Play the song on an instrument, sing it, listen to it everyday. it will pay off when you know it by heart:) hope this helps:)|`|ThuTSU2Uaa	just try different tones till u get the song....thants wat i do .....:-)|`|c14440593e2981ac6b4f5caac868376baa	If you can sing it correctly by ear, or know someone who can, tape record them and play it repeatedly. I learned it in piano class, but have never sung it.|`|F9e0lY50aa	read the lyrics over and over and over and over again....then start singing it to yourself over and over and over again :)
l9Xg8Dv4aa	Not to worry! All of that would be discussed with you , by the acceptance Editor,after acceptance by the Magazine.<br>   Most magazines want "First North American Rights" This only means that they want to be assured that you have not and will not sell the right of publishing to another magazine until they do.<br>  Some want " All rights" which means the right to publish now belongs to them and no one else, including you!<br>  They will normally return those rights after a year, but you just make sure you understand-they will let you know!, what to expect after they accept.

But he is also very caring and loving. <br>  <br>  -Edward Cullen_<br>  <br>  <br>  I love how she is such a klutz  and how she hates blood, is makes her ill but she wants to be a vampire.

He is a great friend and also is very brave even though he is always afraid lol.<br>  <br>  -Ron Weasley-<br>  <br>  <br>  He is hot and sexy lol. He has a great character. He is a badboy 'asshole' who makes fun of everyone. But it is hilarious how he talks down on people but then runs away crying haha. Very amusing. I honestly think that if his father was not such a bad guy he would of been a good guy.<br>  <br>  -Draco Malfoy-<br>  <br>  <br>  They are hilarious, they are cute, they finish each other sentences, they give this movie/book such fun and enjoyment. Their good guys<br>  <br>  -The Weasley Twins-<br>  <br>  <br>  He is such a b.a.s.t.a.r.d. lmfao and you can never tell if he is good or bad because he has that attitude that he does not give a crap about you. He can kill someone with just a glare but then he is a hero and saves people even though he hates them.<br>  <br>  -Professor Snape-<br>  <br>  <br>  He is such a hypocrite! A prejudice jerk. Very cruel and uncaring. But its funny because when he is at Hogwarts he is polite to his elders and puts on a great act, trying to make them think he is good, when he just killed someone haha.<br>  <br>  -Tom Riddle-<br>  <br>  <br>  She knows what she wants, even if people hate her, make fun of her, make her cry or try to kill her.

They rename it "Animal Farm"<br>  Then, the Pigs, the self-proclaimed rulers, set up some laws about how the animals should conduct themselves. The rules center around not being like a human.<br>  Over time, the pigs become more and more human-like. Eventually, it gets to a point where they are drinking alcohol, wearing clothes, and sleeping in beds (all of which were forbidden by the laws.)<br>  Then, the pigs meet with the humans to discuss trade. The pigs are so human-like that they are almost indistinguishable from the humans themselves.|`|aAernkJkaa	Animal farm was an allegory which means extended metaphor. It was symbolizing the russian revolution. It started out with Old Major who was a symbol for Karl Marx telling the animals that he had a vision where one day the animals would run the farm and they would all be equal. At the beginning of chapter 2 Old Major dies and the animals drive out the humans. They make seven commandments that they are all supposed to live by. After awhile the pigs Napolean who is a symbol of Joseph Stalin, Snowball who is a symbol for Trotsky, and Squealer who is a symbol for Lenin. After the animals are attacked by people trying to get there farm back, Napolean takes over and drives out Snowball. Napolean starts using Squealer to lie to the animals so that everyone will do anything Napolean says and he changes the commandments. If anything goes wrong the use Snowball as a scapegoat or someone who everything is blamed on. By the end of  the book, the pigs have learned to act exactly as humans do and it shows that animalism which is a symbol for communism never works.|`|c8lBbWtQaa	Its a parody on communism about all people being equal but Really only paying lipservice to this. The animals represent the people you need to work out why he gave the different animals the roles he did, Of course it makes you realise that we are not really equal at all & that for all its high Ideals communism is fatally flawed. the book starts out with humans being in charge & treating their workforce badly [the animals] the animals fight back [revolution]  & win the farm they run it as a co-op & its fine at first but the clever pigs want more & end up being just like the humans [despotic & greedy]. Its a social commentary book written long before communisn collapsed in Russia it warns & informs You'll need to work that out too.|`|8wjz4HxCaa	I think it's about a bunch of cows and chickens who take over the world and start eating people sandwiches.|`|lWHoATFNaa	lol this is quite lucky as ive just done this book in english<br>  <br>  the book is basically tells the story of the russian revloution in 1918 (about). It is about animals who live on a far run by mr jones and would like to run the farm for themselves, in a society where all the animals are equal. animalism (representing communism) is formed. this is what happened in the russian revolution, as the russian people wanted freedom from the rulers who were the tsars and wanted to adopt communism. the following events (in the book) are very like the rest of the revoloution.<br>  <br>  ill leave you a "cast list" so you may be able to understand it more<br>  Old major- karl marx(founder of communism)/ lenin<br>  boxer- the russian workers<br>  moses- religion<br>  napoleon- stalin (thats what i think it is, but dont quote me on that but im pretty sure)<br>  snowball- the other candidate for ruling russia<br>  squealer- propaganda<br>  molly (the one of the horses)- the people who owned alot before the revolution and didnt want to give up their position in society for communism<br>  <br>  thats all i can remember, if you need any more email me and ill see if i can get the rest, the internet would be good, or ask an english teacher if you are at school<br>  <br>  hope that helps<br>  :)|`|H4XCEapNaa	to me animal farm symbolized a sort of tug of war between right and wrong or good and evil like from the start all the animals agreed that the farmer had to go but once they got that job done they couldn't agree on anything. then once the main pig(cant remember name srry)died tha antagonist(other pig) took over and nothing was fair|`|GCaYebCdaa	it probably about a farm with a lonlely animal who want to be specal

4c2b4b3698607bc95dd331438404d7e8aa	One of the greatest classics ever written in the English language. Need I say more? Okay, Elizabeth is a poor girl aged 20 from a good family, bright, beautiful and intelligent. A visitor to a neighbour's home, Mr Darcy, who is good-looking and rich but very proud and obsessed with his own great social position, falls in love with her against his will. He tells her to her face that although she is not worthy of him, he wants her anyway. She tells him to stick his moneybags where the sun don't shine.<br>  <br>  The main plot deals with how the two of them find each other through many twists and turns of the story and how their characters alter subtly to enable this to happen. There are many subplots, mainly involving the romances of two of Elizabeth's sisters (lovely Jane and shallow Lydia - both get the man they deserve) and her friend Charlotte, who is forced to marry a stupid man for money.<br>  <br>  It is a pure joy and delight to read. Go ahead, you'll LOVE it!|`|BzWQap1Haa	Yes, Pride and Prejudice is a good book.  The story shows the class distinctions of society in Victorian England and the roles/options open to women (as well as men).  Marriage is on everyone's minds because in the genteel classes this is the best most successful option for ensuring a woman's future.   The book is filled with descriptions of clothes, balls, dances, homes, gardens and rituals (tea, dinner, conversation, etc.)<br>  <br>  The story centers on the Bennet family -- esp. Elizabeth and Jane, the two eldest daughters -- and their adventures, mishaps and decisions about who to trust and who to shun.<br>  <br>  There is a happy ending for those who deserve it.  Everyone learns something and remain true to their natures in the process.<br>  <br>  Hope this helps.|`|O2VZL8Praa	Hard to start but once you get used to the language it is FABULOUS.<br>  <br>  Misunderstandings, deceit, betrayal, friendship, and awe-inspiring romance and enduring love.
cgz85foTaa	The Giver by Lois Lowry<br>  Labyrinth by Kate Mosse<br>  American Gods by Neil Gaiman|`|WYrYptMbaa	The Outsiders is one of my favorite books too! if you like it you might also like other books by S.E. Hinton such as,<br>  Taming the Star Runner<br>  Rumble Fish<br>  TEX<br>  That was then, this is now.<br>  <br>  and you might be a bit old for this, but one of my favorites has always been Number the Stars by Lois Laury (or something like that)<br>  Also I suggest Hemingway, Poe, and Shakespeare.|`|y8cXzvpxaa	you should read Tenderness by Robert Cormier... it's not what you would call "romantic" but there was love involved... just in the most unlikely situation.... it's also a bit disturbing.<br>  <br>  let me just tell you a brief summary.<br>  Eric is a 18 and is a psychopath... he's intelligent and sharp minded but has an insatiable addiction for "tenderness" which he finds in a woman's body. you can kind of guess what happens from there right?<br>  <br>  a 15 year old girl named Lori has a mind problem of her own. She becomes fixated to people where she desperately needs to kiss them or get them to fall in love with her. She happens to be fixated on Eric.<br>  <br>  but Eric doesnt see Lori like he does in other girls. She's different and far from his type. Yet he is drawn to her differently than the others. That takes him on an emotional rollercoaster on what to do with her and how he feels...<br>  <br>  it's disturbing but honest. i think you might like it. i didnt think i would at first but now i find that i really like the book. mostly for it's theme.|`|bVcjFYRLaa	I think you should read the Percy Jackson series it is great and very adventureous|`|Dj7C8yO5aa	ummm the catcher in the rye?<br>  <br>  lol i hated twilight too. wayyy too cheesy.
EEbIKHTMaa	I think you've got a good start there and it has the potential to develop into something interesting, but it could do with some editing, especially in the dream section.<br>  <br>  Firstly, I'd either change the way you're describing the forest sounds "pounded", "twittered wildly" etc, or change the first sentence of the second paragraph.  Apart from the fact that you haven't been describing how the atmosphere LOOKED, but rather how it sounded, the words "calm and peaceful" bear no relation to the scene you've described.  Either the forest is bombarding her with sound or it is peaceful.  Its a discrepancy that pulled me right out of the story.<br>  <br>  Secondly, don't explain everything to the reader.  Instead of writing "Slowly, so as not to disturb anything unwelcoming, she crept over to a large oak", write "Slowly, she crept over to a large oak".  We already know she's scared of something in the forest cause you told us in the previous paragraph.  The words "slowly" and "crept" are enough to reinforce that.  <br>  <br>  Same thing with "which was inflicted" and "that she had some time to relax and settle her nerves".  We can get this from the context.<br>  <br>  Too many explanations from an author will just bore the reader; they're constant reminders that the author is there, when actually, we'd just like to know what the character is doing, please.<br>  <br>  Hope that's helpful :)|`|p7At4cyvaa	wow i love this. you should really think of becomming a writer, i would read it.|`|4e01ea3c043d72bb0dcd6600971480b9aa	and this dream seemed to be one of those.<br>  <br>  <br>  that should be....them.<br>  <br>  I would cut out 'however' and 'bode' .  however is for an office report or such like and not literature/fiction and bode is old fashioned. I liked it once I got past the dream, that didn't seem as good a standard as the rest, writing wise.|`|ipln31mOaa	Omg thats amazing . !!!<br>  I'd love to be able to write like that .

4vbovQKJaa	Most publishers don't accept unsolicited manuscripts.  If you're going to do the work and do all that mailing, consider sending some to a few agents, unless you're prepared to do all the contractual negotiations yourself.  I like www.agentquery.com - it lists agents by genre.<br>  <br>  But don't get your hopes up - most submissions never get looked at.  In fact, most get returned unopened.  And those that get opened and read, get ripped apart.  Just be prepared for rejection and criticism.<br>  <br>  EDIT:  With self-publications, you'd pay for every copy you print.  You'd also have to market and sell them yourself, which would be ridiculously time consuming for an individual.  Also, with online books, most publishers wouldn't touch anything that's been posted on the internet.  Why would they pay good money for something that people can read for free online?  You're really doing yourself a disservice by posting online.|`|6GXSNJt5aa	Maybe you should  consider self-publishing.

First off, if you wrote this it is amazing!! In ZAP! there is a character that does have EXTREMELY long monologues. Like they are longer than yours. ALl you might want to do is cut out the unnecessary parts and add lots of emotion so that your audience will actually want to sit and listen to all the stuff you want to tell them because once again if you wrote this it is VERY good.<br>  <br>  You should write scripts,<br>  <br>  <br>  Hope this Helps,<br>  <br>  <br>  misspositive15 :)
Aoq9FDy4aa	actually i dont necessarily agree with that view point.. that it is the actions of others or the in action of some individuals that cause total strangers to go on killing sprees, or do bad things.<br>  <br>  i've been trying to promote and gather material for a theory i have been formulating for some time about the actual ecosystem of society... basing it on the idea that an ecosystem doesn't have to be made up of a bunch of different species but can exist in the same basic primal format in one species serving as both predator and prey, host cell and virus, parasite, herbavore, plant, etc.<br>  <br>  that being said i take the view point that society has not made killers, it has caste the mold of killers in a poor light. we are ok about policemen killing bad guys, we are ok with war, we are ok with other people killing people in self defense, in some places we are ok with killing people who have a terminal illiness, in other places we are ok with killing gay people, people of another religion, etc. society does not make the killer, the aggressor, the predator. society makes the label and formulates an opinion on how the individual should percieve the actions of violence. <br>  <br>  i think in some ways going back to my theory that yes, we are born with a certian predisposition torward certain actions. we havent certain abilities and talents and weakness given to us. due to our placing in society and the stimulation of others i think that too does have an effect on what we ultimately do.<br>  <br>  let me see if i cant explain it a little better. you know how they say that rapists were typically abused themselves? well... in my opinion that is how the caste breeds. if you will its like a virus.  its how it breeds. that species of humanity might be necessary, to whatever... create a balance in our population or whatever, so this is how that thing goes on. there are certain people that are born with (i dont want to say flaw) a certain predisposition... like they have an x chromosone buried in their psyche, and as long as they don't find that person with the same x chromosone to activate that side of their personality it will lay dormant...but you know if someone does... that sort of person is born... again... reborn.... activated... mutated... whatever you want to see it as. as a result you get rapist, you get serial killer, you get conartist, you get martyr, you get ceo corporate bastard, you get wife beater, you get the victimized wife, you get normal people who become more.<br>  <br>  it is a personal philosophy of mine that we have no choice in the actions of ourselves, no true consciousness or independence, but due to our sensory awareness are unfortunately bound to accountability of any action we take or dont take. the best most people can do is kinda steer the boat. we're all going down the river. the course has already been plotted. the best anyone really can do is sink their boat, or try like hell to manage the rapids, waterfalls, whirlpools, and shallows in search of tranquil calm waters.|`|GOKlnTfbaa	No it's not. Without society people would still kill each other for material gain like food or something or women. Naturally animals in the wild will fight to the death for sex or cannabalism.|`|1XDlgaQsaa	of course some people are just born this way|`|ohgvcV9Qaa	never in the history of men was ever a perfect society, you have to realize the there are just too many people and there are some that think that human value doesn't matter, there is not much we can do about this. perhaps we are connected somehow but that's only because we choose to be part of the society. today's age is the same as before, human value is just an obstacle for the greater means. serial killers are tragic but they are as likely as someone getting killed by a falling coconut, crime is different, war is different too.|`|pexxZB8Daa	yes society makes people bad by excluding them, i mean, even hitler was ok until society sort of isolated him which screwed him up!|`|U5nwTswfaa	Yes.<br>  <br>  There are a few natural born killers out there, but they actually have a physical problem with their brains.<br>  Most killers are the product of their environments. Poor parenting skills, the breakdown of extended families and ultra easy access to mass communication technology all combine to create these out of kilter individuals. The biggest problem in my opinion is the latter. Certain pervasive ideas can group together into a highly "contagious" constructs called memes. From the point of view of the evolution of society, different memes types are more successful in different environments. The idea of altruism is a group of memes that are successful in small, low density societies where there is little horizontal communication.<br>  Horizontal transmission is where information is transmitted between members on the same generation. Vertical transmission means transmission from parents to children.<br>  Where there is more population density, more aggressive, self-serving memes are more prevalent due to the increase in horizontal transmission. They learn more from their peers than they do from their parents. The bigger the city, the more violence there is. TV and the internet are the worst offenders, unfortunately, in shaping young peoples' attitudes as these technologies have effectively made the whole world one massive population.

uYz8ipcJaa	Well..... real ones are made out of rice paper and a framework of wood, usually bamboo...<br>  <br>  OK, you probably don't have enough budget to buy expensive rice paper or bamboo or have a safe enough setting for using real fire.<br>  <br>  But they're pretty simple in making.  Just slim, lightweight wooden bars jointed and glued together for framework, (you can make circular or cylindrical ones, but that's tricky, so just make an upright rectangle shaped one) with paper glued onto them to cover the entire thing, except for the top and bottom, perhaps.  I think you could make cheap fakes with balsa wood and tissue paper or some paper that is rough and half-transparant like that... which are lightweight and are relatively cheaper.<br>  <br>  Use your imagination to put together the wood and put a lightbulb or something in it...<br>  <br>  If you want to make one authentic-style, it'll cost you a lot of time, so rule it out.  Lantern-making is a serious craft in Japan and are very, very expensive $$$ because a lot of time and skill goes into it.  That's why even Japanese people usually have fakes, if they still have such an obsolete thing like a lantern nowadays, for special traditional events or weddings or something.<br>  <br>  Warning: Paper is easy to rip.<br>  No-brainer, but yes, you have to remind some people of that sometimes.

gb1BGP8xaa	This is the source.  Jew:<br>  Middle English Jeu, from Old French giu, from Latin Idaeus, from Greek Ioudaios, from Aramaic yhudy, from Hebrew yh?d?, inhabitant of Judah, from yh?da, Judah; see Judah2.<br>  <br>  It would be very difficult for anyone to trace their ancestry that far back. Their simply aren't the records.|`|rVhrVyRGaa	The Jewish ethnonym in Hebrew is "Yehudim" (plural<br>   of "Yehudi"),origin of the English word "Jew". The Hebrew name is derived from the region name Judah (Yehudah) .Originally the name referred to the territory alloted to the tribe descended from Judah, the fourth son of the patriarch Jacob (Numbers). Judah was both one of the twelve sons of Jacob and ONE of the Twelve tribes of Israel (Genesis)--not necessarily the RULING tribe.<br>    Judah's mother, Leah, named him Yehudah to "praise God" for giving her so many sons.<br>     Thereafter Judah vouchsafes the Jewish monarchy, and the Israelite kings David and Solomon derive their lineage from Judah. In Hebrew, the name "Judah" contains the four letters of the Tetragrammaton — the special, holy, and ineffable name of the Jewish God (YHWH<br>   for "Yahweh").<br>     In the Book of Esther, we find the earliest reference of the word "Jew" being used. The name appears in the Bible in a verb form, in Esther<br>   8:17 --"Many of the people of the land "mityahadim - became Yehudim/Judeans/Jews" because the fear of the Yehudim fell on them."<br>      Also in Esther we find that the name "Jew" is given to a man from the tribe of Benjamin, in Esther 2:5-6--"There was a man, a Yehudi (Judean/Jewish man) in Shushan the capital, whose name was Mordecai, the son of Jair, the son of Shimei, the son of Kish, a Benjamite; who had been exiled from Jerusalem with the exile that was exiled with Jeconiah, king of Judah, which Nebuchadnezzar, king of Babylon, had exiled."<br>     The Middle English word Jew is from the Old French giu, earlier juieu, from the Latin *Iudaeus and the Latin word simply means "Judaean, from the land of Judea". In the Old English the word is attested as early as 1000 AD  in various forms, such as *Iudeas, Gyu, Giu, *Iuu, *Iuw, *Iew. (*--these are capital i's , not lower case L's, by the way.)<br>  <br>   ("Jew" is not a "perversion" of the word Ju because for something to be a perversion, it has to be "a violation or a change to something worse; an action of turning aside from truth; or unnatural acts, acts contrary to nature, bestial, abominable, and detestable." )|`|o3sYIdOzaa	The European royal families often claimed that their lineage had been recorded back to Biblical characters.  From Jesus back the lineages are recorded in the bible.  If they actually kept track of all those Biblical characters, perhaps they could have also done that afterwords, probably not, but who knows.  Royals claimed divine right to rule from this real or imagined lineage.  The problem with the Biblical line is that it doesn't actually go back far enough to have reached the time of the actual first homo sapiens on Earth, let alone their predecessors, who were  actually in Africa, according to mitochondrial DNA studies.  They do go back to Judah, but not all Jews were from the tribe of Judah, although their homeland was called Judaea.

Initially established during the Preclassic period (c. 2000 BC to 250 AD), many Mayan cities reached their highest state development during the Classic period (c. 250 AD to 900 AD), and continued throughout the Postclassic period until the arrival of the Spanish.

Rt4bJfVAaa	As a fellow student of life and before the internet I went out of my way to find reference books on topics like these.

And that each term by itself has meaning but when put together has more meaning.  And when placing them indifferent settings can create another meaning.<br>  <br>  Actually when looking at your link Bertrand Russell said it well.

Mankind would never ask "what next" - we would be trapped in the 'why it happened' and not ask the question 'why we can't'.<br>  If man learns from the past, (as we try to do) why should we waste time staying in the past.

Move onward, upward and further, question and keep questioning - for without questions there would be no learning and no philosophical/physical moving forward. <br>  <br>  That is the problem with some regions - they argue to stay in the past, but creativity speaking - mankind is not an animal that stays there, we must always travel forward - it is intrinsic to our nature to move on to survive.|`|360c66240ece2cffefc507bfa04c3addaa	“Those who do not learn from history are doomed to repeat it”.

Which is to say, it's a free time activity.  Wallowing in self-pity about miserable childhood etc something to do on a rainy Sunday afternoon, but not actually relevant to the task in hand on a Monday morning.<br>  <br>  Looking back, when making decisions, is a big fat mistake. It's called 'taking your baggage with you into the future' and the trick to life is to get rid of the baggage and stride unencumbered into the future.  Baggage mutates one's options and damages outcomes.  <br>  <br>  But you have to look back to offload the baggage.... hmm.<br>  <br>  I think it is probably a statement made in the context of decision making, no - of positive decision making.  Look to future outcomes and make best decisions based on the future: do NOT make decisions based on past bad experiences because that's a negative mindset with a guaranteed negative outcome.  EG you stick salt in a cake at the outset, it does not matter what else you put in the cake to 'counteract' the salt, the cake is doomed.<br>  <br>  Bother, already have to edit.  <br>  <br>  To deal with your baggage, you look at it, learn from it, and do something called 'internalise' the lesson.  This means that you do not have to take the memory with you, you are now taking a diamond: a jewel of understanding about human nature with you.  This is a 'now' item in your bag of tricks:  it means that your next decision will automatically take into account this jewel of understanding you have in your bag of tricks.  There is no looking back required because you are using an item you possess now to aid a decision you are making now.  <br>  <br>  if we resolve and internalise life's lessons as we go (the aim of the good philosopher) then this looking back is only a free time reminiscence activity.  We have internalised all of what we need to know and we take it with us as a body of knowledge/understanding, not as hangups and bad memories.|`|X86thFjvaa	I think sometimes its good to look back for remembrance.

d23fa6d2e917deab830cd8e653b1ed51aa	Her diary begins in September 1991 as she writes about how summer is concluding and that she is about to start school. In the days ahead, she writes about her back-to-school shopping, the music videos she watched, her favorite pizza, etc.<br>  <br>  Then the war erupts. Unlike Anne Frank, Zlata rides out the war in their apartment. She constantly battles the cold and hunger as she describes shells pouring over. But nothing is more saddening than the loss of her friends and loved ones. <br>  <br>  Her entries went from writing about herself to reports about death, the massacre, no electricity or gas, etc. For the sake of her parents, Zlata had to be strong. She continued to go to summer school despite the shooting and her mother continued to go to work.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zlata_Filipovi%C4%87" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zlata_Filip...</a><br>  <a href="http://www.nps.gov/archive/manz/ed_zlatas_diary.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.nps.gov/archive/manz/ed_zlata...</a><br>  <a href="http://search.barnesandnoble.com/booksearch/isbnInquiry.asp?r=1&ISBN=9780143036876&ourl=Zlatas%2DDiary%2FZlata%2DFilipovic" rel="nofollow">http://search.barnesandnoble.com/booksea...</a>|`|STIciLTeaa	Zlata Filipovic was just eleven years old when war came to Sarajevo in the spring of 1992. Zlata's diary, which she nicknamed, Mimmy, evolved from a fun and frivolous slice of preteen life complete with references to skiing trips, birthday parties, secret talks at sleepovers, pop music and fashion to a living testimony to some of the darkest times in recent history, the Bosnian War.<br>  <br>  Zlata, the only child of Malik, a lawyer, and Alica, a chemist, earned near-perfect grades in school, had loads of friends, and played piano beautifully. She lived close to her grandparents. She wanted to join Madonna's fan club. Zlata and her family were educated, cultured Bosnians who intermingled with Serbs, Croats and Muslims. Zlata never says which she is in her story <br>  <br>  During the war, Zlata and her family lose everything. Zlata's mother's place of work is destroyed. Zlata can't go to school with any regularity. The Pibi orangeade and sweet treats that Zlata so adores are near impossible to get. Instead, she almost forgets what fruit and vegetables taste like. Gas, electricity and safety are also sacrificed. Friends leave Sarajevo in exodus and move all over Europe. Some of Zlata's acquaintances are murdered horribly, innocent children caught in the crossfire of someone else's war.<br>  <br>  Sarajevo itself transforms from an educated center of culture to a medieval backwater in which survival becomes very difficult. Even the Olympic Stadium lies in ruins. Zlata contemplates suicide but tries to be strong - especially for her mother, who seems to be coming apart at the seams. She admits she is a child "without a childhood" who only wants peace for Christmas in 1993.<br>  <br>  Despite the cycle of devastation and death, the neighborhood becomes a bit of a family. There are good people who look out for the children and make sure that Zlata has an occasional chocolate bar, some clothes to fit her growing frame and birthday presents. The new "family" celebrates the holidays and birthdays and marriages that still occur.<br>  <br>  Luckily, her diary is published during her lifetime. In fact, it is published during the war and becomes her family's ticket out of Bosnia-Herzegovina. Zlata has a happy ending, happier than some of her friends and relations. <br>  <br>  Zlata's Diary is a poignant record of a childhood lost to war, a truly inspirational yet profoundly sad work that, much like the author, has a wisdom well beyond its years.

Something along those lines...|`|Dj7C8yO5aa	its not really in the books. its probably just something that jk rowling made up about him but didnt feel the need to put it in the books.|`|X9XbaBNkaa	I think it was J K Rowling who said it in an interview - I dont think it is actually in black and white in any of the books|`|SpHbrSFLaa	yeah i wanna know too... i was wondering..|`|JZCbAR4Yaa	I read the book and never picked up on it either. I think it was a read between the lines kind of thing. And maybe JK just wanted even more publicity and controversy so she decided that it would work if he was gay.<br>  I have nothing against homosexuality, but for me, stating Dumbledore's sexuality one way or another didn't add anything to the novel or story.<br>  <br>  <br>  good girl gone vampire: I'm wondering when it was decided that liking knitting patterns meant you were gay...  :-P|`|pRn1h2Hlaa	Grindlewald.it was extremely obvious to me.why do you think dumbledore never killed him but had him locked away?

wh8H1eCXaa	Just like the last poster said, have fun with it!  Rather than thinking of it as just an assignment, think of your project as working for an actual client or business you have interest in.<br>  <br>  For example, in a design class I took, we had to design a logo that incorporated bees.  We were free to choose the type of business we were designing for, and I chose to do it for a dance studio.  I called this imaginary dance studio "The Dance Hive," and I thought of different ways I could make the words "Dance Hive" look sleek and urban, while keeping to the theme of bees.  I ended up making the text look like parts of a honeycomb using a simple hexagon shape.<br>  <br>  Anyway, think of a place or a business that interests you, and use a theme like your favorite animal.  Gather pictures of your theme to get ideas on shapes and patterns.  Then use descriptive words that describe the place or business that interests you.  Use those words to define your type style more.  It would be even better to think of a name of the business and picture how its sign would look.  Be sure to brainstorm and sketch a lot and pick out the ideas that you like the best.<br>  <br>  Good luck with your assignment!  Sounds fun!|`|AA10570173	A classic idea to do with text is to make an object out of text. In other words, you could start with the outline of the object, but file it with text, using words that all relate to the object. A step up from that is to make the object just out of the words, no outline at all, so the shape, shows nothing but those words. You don't have to make sentences, or have the text follow in straight lines, it can go any which way and be different sizes.<br>  <br>  What you might want to start with is to make a mind map. Think of a favorite subject or a thing you like. Write that down on a piece of paper (it doesn't have to be any special paper, just a blank sheet), in the middle. Now let your mind just free associate off that. Each time you think of a word or phrase directly related to that first word, write it down, circle it and make an arrow going from the main/first word to that new word or phrase. If that new word or phrase makes you think of another word or phrase, write that down near the one that made you think of the new one, circle it, then make another arrow going from the  word that sent you in this direction. Keep doing this, just letting your mind go. Now you have a whole bunch of related words or phrases, make your shape of the first item using these. You can also just make words lists, starting with the main word, and then just writing down all the other words and phrases that occur to you (the mind mapping is just a neat way to see how thing relate, in fact you can draw your arrows in more than one direction if you see multiple relationships.) <br>  <br>  Have some fun with this, really.

Kc3VDgusaa	It is really not a good idea for you to have a friend push down your splits. In doing this they could tear your hamstring and then you will take much longer to get your splits down. I forced my splits and tore my hamstring and they are still not flat.<br>  <br>  Instead try oversplits. This is when you put your front leg up onn a gymnastics mat or a chair and go down into your split and hold it there for about 30 secs. do this twice on each side then do your splits on the floor.<br>  <br>  Wall stretches with friends, have a friend lift your leg up while you are standing against a wall make sure your hips are alligned and they are not going to hurt you by going too high. My friend has been doing this for six months and can touch the wall with her leg! good luck I hope I helped!! :}|`|Dob2OhIYaa	i would say yes, it is bad, if you get pushed too hard or your accidentally stretch too far you can easily tear a hamstring which is bad, <br>  to get them just stretch every day until you get them <br>  for your other splits it all depends on how close you are but i would say defiantly yes, because all of last summer i stretched out and at the end i was able to do left and right splits for dance center splits , in my opinion, are much harder to get but after a couple months ive gotten so close now, you just will have to stretch out every day so you can get them<br>  but remember to always warm up, and never over stretch|`|E6tkzPsbaa	I know how badly you want your splits, but that is pretty dangerous. You could tear muscles and believe me, that's no fun. If you would like to get your splits then (I know this saying really does get annoying), practice makes perfect. Practice each split every single, solitary night and hold all of them for at least two minutes each. I give you my best of hopes and wishes! Good luck!|`|11NSsAN7aa	if they push you 4 inches to the floor and you have never gone below 4 before that it probably is, otherwise no|`|GDMrzpIDaa	The best way to get your splits is to sit in them for 30 seconds then sit in a straddle for 30 seconds. Do this repeatedly and you will probably get a lot farther down. It worked for me! The most important part of going into the splits is to relax, if you relax your muscles will be able to stretch better. Don't let any one push you down. Pushing all of your body weight down on your already stretched out muscles could lead a) to over stretching or b) to tearing your muscles. <br>  It really depends where you are in your center/left splits. I think that if you have long and relaxed stretching sessions (for about fifteen-twenty minutes) every day, no matter how far away you are, you will get your splits in about 6 months. Remember, when you stretch, you have to make sure to stretch everything contributing to your splits. Loosen up your hips (squatting works well), stretch your hamstrings, and calves too. Stretching all of these will help you to get down completely. <br>  Some easy and effective ways to help you stretch for your splits:<br>  -Go down into your splits and put some pillows in between your legs (under your body) this helps you to relax and helps you get down to the splits<br>  -Put your front foot up on a raised surface while you are in the splits. Your body weight will help to bring you down into the splits<br>  -Put your legs into 'Butterfly' position while you lay on your stomach. Try to make your feet touch the ground while keeping your pelvis on the ground. Don't have anyone push your feet down, this could hurt you.<br>  Okay. So remember, stretching is supposed to feel calming and relaxing. It might feel warm (this is always good) but it should NOT hurt. Good luck!|`|G9YT2Ficaa	No, it's not a good idea. My ballet teacher used to push me down when I was younger and I ended up with a horrible hip because of it. 6 months is plenty of time, try leaning over and stretching over it, and trying to touch your toe. That should help a lot.|`|TVoC9vWvaa	It's only bad if they apply so much pressure it hurts your hamstring. That's exactly what happened to my older sister while we tried doing the splits.|`|EfBMzCjaaa	if someone GENTLY pushes you and does it SLOWLY then its all good but dont get shoved down|`|m33uUyRYaa	its not bad but if it starts to hurt too bad tell them to stop

I can understand that he left Bella because he thought that would be best for her. So, I don't know why you Jacob fans hate Edward so much...<br>  <br>  Anyways, I wasn't that happy with the movie. I believe that because the story was so WONDERFUL, the movie just couldn't live up to the expectations. <br>  <br>  So, ya, I loved the story...not so much the movie, and my favorite character in the book is "Edward"...DUH!!!!<br>  <br>  SMILES!!!|`|86oPkfzOaa	I like all the Cullens that are between the physical ages of 17-20 [so Edward, Alice, Jasper, Rosalie, and Emmett].

He is mistaken.  He has made a prediction about the future and he was wrong.  His nose will not grow.|`|ot6OJ7JWaa	Oh, my god! Best question that I've EVER read!<br>  You, my dear, are my new best friend. <br>  I love paradoxes.|`|sbuY0Twpaa	lol grow then shrink? I dunno :P|`|ha6CUuFKaa	The answer to this question really depends on the magical properties of Pinocchio's nose; there are several different things that could happen:<br>  <br>  If Pinocchio's nose doesn't respond to the truth values of future predictions, then nothing will happen. But this is boring.<br>  <br>  If his nose does respond to future events,  then we need to know several more things:<br>  <br>  1. Is there a delay between when he tells the lie and when his nose starts growing?<br>  <br>  2. When his lie is no longer a lie, does his nose continue growing to its full length, stop growing, or shrink back down to how it was?<br>  <br>  3. When something that wasn't a lie before becomes a lie, does his nose start growing again? <br>  <br>  4. If something that was true before becomes a lie, will his nose register that as a whole new lie, will only respond once, or will it continue responding only until it reaches a given length?<br>  <br>  There are lots of cases here, and lots of boring ones where nothing happens. So, for the sake of argument lets say that his noes has the ability to detect a change in the truth value of  one of this statements and respond. Lets look at a few of the more interesting cases:<br>  <br>  If there is no delay, and his nose shrinks down to its original size after something he said becomes true, nothing will happen. However, if there is a delay, his nose will oscillate back and forth between growing and shrinking either once or for the rest of his life depending on 4 (that's what you get for dicking around with forces beyond your comprehension). <br>  <br>  But that's not the worst of it...<br>  <br>  As we know, after telling four lies, Pinocchio's nose becomes a tree, and after five, it even has little critters in it. If his nose does not shrink down after something he said becomes the truth, things start to become pretty hairy for our little Pinocchio.<br>  <br>  If his nose responds instantly, it will grow smoothly, but at only half its normal speed. If there is a delay, it will start and stop. If he's lucky, his nose will stop growing after it reaches a certain length, or after a certain amount of time has passed. However, if he's unlucky, and his nose registers every change in truth value as a separate and independent lie, his nose will continue to grow, whether at only half speed, or in small pulses. It will slowly morph into a tree, with small critters in it at first, but eventually mythical creatures, and finally even dragons! It will continue to grow and grow, and as it does it will take root. <br>  <br>  The blue fairy, as we've seen can make Pinocchio's nose disappear when he's not actively engaged in lying. However it is unknown whether she can do this while it is currently growing. If this is not the case, she will be forced to step in and disenchant Pinocchio before the nose-tree becomes  the size of  a planet starts ripping apart continents. <br>  <br>  A sad fate perhaps, but an important lesson to us all<br>  <br>  Rest in Peace, Pinocchio|`|ohgvcV9Qaa	that's not telling a truth or lying its simply describing. so every time he describes something he either tells a truth or a lie? i don't think so.

Begin with a diary entry of a girl alive during a war (wichever war your writing about). That way people will understand it more. And put a little more of how the charecters are feeling in there.

And in the first line, say "Doro moved from the leather..."

9iElNpSSaa	I have found that the Mitchell Lurie reeds are the most consistent reeds for students.  The best Mitchell Lurie reed will not produce as full a tone as the best Vandoren, but they are comparable.  Also, you will get a much higher percentage of reeds that you can actually play on with the Mitchell Luries.<br>  <br>  Ultimately, you need to find the reed that works best with your mouthpiece.  It may turn out that the Ricos play well with your setup.  Some people also like the Rico Grand Concert reeds.  The Gonzalez reeds are also pretty consistent and are a good alternative to the Vandoren V12s.<br>  <br>  If you want to be adventurous, try the synthetic reeds made by Guy Legere.  They are excellent, and remarkably consistent.  They are more expensive than cane reeds but they last a very long time if you take care of them.  The tone they produce is the same as what you will get with cane reeds, but usually better because they are more consistent.  Unfortunately, many people frown upon synthetic reeds, but they do so unfairly.  Some of the best clarinetists in the world are now playing on them and sound great with them.  In my own experience, I switched to Legeres a few years ago, and no one has ever noticed a difference in my sound.  Also, you don’t have to soak them or adjust them or do anything to them.  You just play them!<br>  <br>  If you are playing a traditional Vandoren 3, the Legere standard cut 3 would probably work best.<br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|35GfsJ3Paa	Try Vandoren V12s. They are slightly more expensive but much better. Also, the tops are less rounded and they fit most mouthpieces better. <br>  <br>  Personally, every teacher/music director/clarinet instructor I've ever had has forbidden the use of Rico Royals past middle school. Other reeds are much better made, harder, and last longer. <br>  <br>  You might also try Alexander and Mitchell Laurie reeds.<br>  <br>  Make sure that you get a 3 or 3.5 and some Wet n' Dry sandpaper, grade 400 or 600. Sandpaper helps you fix unbalances (reeds that are harder on the right side or the left side), warping, and unresponsiveness (hard to get to tongue cleanly), and shaving down reeds that are too hard. I recommend <a href="http://home.comcast.net/~czrzbz/clarinet/reeds.html" rel="nofollow">http://home.comcast.net/~czrzbz/clarinet...</a> for more on how to care for reeds.<br>  <br>  I always buy at least 6 boxes of reeds at once - that way, I can let the reeds age for a couple of months before using them (saves on shipping, too!). Aged cane plays better and lasts longer, and is less prone to warping than green/new cane.

But I could probably help you add more poetic devices in there without changing the poem.<br>  <br>  "slowly i slip further into the dark" could be changed to "the dark-- it swallows me (or pulls you in or drags you in)" for personification.<br>  <br>  "but wake up facing the truth as ugly as it is..." could be changed to "the ugly truth stares me in the face..."<br>  <br>  I hope I helped you.

You carefully draw on the screen with the oil pastel and then pull your ink across it, wherever you've drawn you should have a clear area. Keep in mind that you need to be gentle when drawing on the screen so as not to damage it, but press hard enough so that you fully block the screen. The difficult part with this method is that you can't remove the pastel with water and soap, you have to use solvent (either turpentine or mineral spirits) Being as how you can't flush solvents down the drain, you have to dispose of them properly and carefully, it makes this technique a bit difficult if you don't have the right surroundings. <br>  <br>  So, that in mind, heres a few other similar options: speedball screen filler, you can paint it onto your screen and wash it out chemical free<br>  caran d'ache or chalk pastels can be used to make positive images on a silk screen as well, you draw on the screen with the crayon or pastel and then pull a clear ink over the drawing. The pigment of the crayon/pastel will carry through the screen with the clear ink to create a print. Its a very fun and organic way to print, I've had a lot of success using this particular method.|`|ngujdeYAaa	Why don't you just use Lacquer Film.  Its a colored film with a plastic backing.  You can place it over art work and still see the artwork behind the film.  With the film side up and the plastic side down you can take a exacto knife and lightly cut the film without piercing the plastic backing.  So lets say your art work is a girl in a red dress, black shoes, and a white hat. You can sut out a outline around her dress which will be the film for your red screen, then cut out her hat with a new piece of lacquer film this will be the white screen,...and so forth.  When all the pieces are cut Remove the film from the plastic backing by peeling it away.  This will allow the ink to flow through this area.  Lay down the film on a paper towel.  Get a rag and some lacquer chemical and tamp the rag.  You will place the screen on top of the cut piece of film and wipe the top of the screen over the film with the lacquered rag.  Then immediately blot the chemical dry.  Allow this to dry when done . Then simply pull away the films plastic backing.  Tape out around the film with tape so that ink does not pass through there and you got your image.  Simple.
df4e65aa2655a8c5857b92c1f5135b4faa	First I'd definatley recommend The Donovan Legacy by Nora. There are four books to this series (Captivated, Entranced, Charmed, and Enchanted). They are all about modern day witches, so that fits perfectly for what you are looking for.<br>  Otherwise I'd recommend the Circle Trilogy by Nora as well (not exactly witchcraft, but sort of). Morrigan's Cross, Dance of the Gods & Valley of Silence...<br>  <br>  I can't really think of other authors at the moment with similar storylines, but definately check out the above series if you haven't already!

It's wider than the sky, deeper than the sea, and the weight of God.<br>  <br>  We can comprehend more than the sky can carry. Where it has limits, we don't. We can see deeper than what's beneath the sea. Where it has a bottom, our thought continues. And we carry the judgement of God, equal in weight as we share these ideals together. This is all due to our imagination and creativity our mind possesses. Hope that helps.|`|tfsNIX4uaa	It could be that this poem is addressing the issue of the imagination and how vast it can be .

draNVjbkaa	Getting into voice over acting is a hefty investment. Largely because you have to invest thousands of dollars in putting together a demo reel that shows your range as a voice actor. There are different types of voiceovers. Commercials are the biggest chunk. Then there are promo, narrative, foreign language, audiobook, and animation. <br>  <br>  Before forking over thousands of dollars to get your reel, get a lot of training before. Good training consists of proper vocal exercises and warmup, proper diction in American standard English, breaking down a VO script into phrases, and being able to make that script come to life and not just some regular read. Improv is also highly recommended as well for you want to be able to loosen up and use your imagination when you're in that isolation chamber (recording booth).<br>  <br>  If I had to recommend a book, I think The Art of Voice Acting, 3rd edition by James R. Alburger is a good place to start. He also gives recommendations for other Voiceover resources as well. <br>  <br>  Here's a great Voice Acting resource site:<br>  <a href="http://voiceacting.com" rel="nofollow">http://voiceacting.com</a>|`|Whj6KC6Jaa	idk what voice acting it, but seriously--take a class. they will help you get a good start and something to put on your resume. or join the drama club/drama class/school play.<br>  <br>  answer mine?<br>  <a href="http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;_ylt=AuhdZl1HYZ_WCm.vq6kuj4Hsy6IX;_ylv=3?qid=20090304134728AAYyQZK">http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;...</a>

Ow3O7h4caa	What you need to do is to use the rosin that came with your violin and rub it on the hair of the bow. That will prevent the slide from sliding side to side and grip the string . That will produce sound.|`|577076a28e3180e6d74e269d0d346d57aa	Rosin.|`|oGdUIrwBaa	I must congratulate you on your courage to buy an instrument without knowing how to play it. The bow shouldn't be the problem, you have to make sure that you always play perpendicular to the string, and play between the bridge and the fingerboard. The bridge I assume you know is that wooden slit with holes in it that pushes the stings up. The second thing is make sure that you do not tighten the bow too much or too little. I recommend a finger's length is the best. <br>  <br>  That's pretty much how you would learn as a beginner. The tuning would only be learned through books or the internet. But good luck!|`|VSsYyhgqaa	Rosin- quite a bit, at first. A few minutes' worth of rosining, at least. It helps if you scratch the top of the rosin with something sharp, like a paperclip (I always keep one in my case). This helps to loosen the dust so it can be applied more easily. You'll need to keep using it, a few strokes each time you play or whenever your bow isn't drawing the sound you want it to. If there's any confusion, don't be afraid to take it to the violin shop, they'll be happy to show you. Don't worry, it's a mistake any beginner could have made:)|`|B3cpzHDZaa	you need to put rosin on.  if the bow is new, you need to use quite a bit of rosin the first time.  run the rosin up and down the hair of the bow.  if the bow still doesn't work then, use sandpaper to scratch the surface of the rosin to allow it to stick to the hair of the bow better.  when there is enough rosin on the bow, it will be able to make noise when you draw it across the string.|`|kVZoeh9paa	All you need to do is put the rosin on the bow hair. The insturment should have come with it and if not you need to go buy some.

Wjc3Lc9Zaa	Esme is known to have a strong ability to "love passionately"<br>  <br>  :]|`|S4W7FojCaa	Just be yourself.|`|nEhDpDMVaa	Here is some info about Esme. Hope it helps.<br>  <br>  Esme Cullen (born Esme Anne Platt and later Esme Anne Evenson) is Carlisle Cullen's wife and the adoptive mother of Edward, Rosalie, Emmett, Alice, and Jasper. She enjoys restoring old houses and her physical age is 26. She has no special power, but has a strong ability to love passionately. Esme is described as being 5 ft 6 in (1.7 m) with caramel-colored hair; she also has a heart-shaped face with dimples, and her figure is slender, but rounded and soft. Esme was born in the late 1800s, living in Columbus, Ohio, where she was treated at the age of 16 by Carlisle after breaking her leg when climbing a tree. She married Charles Evenson, but was abused by him. After finding out she was pregnant, she ran away and gave birth to a son, who subsequently died a few days later. Grief stricken by his death, Esme attempted to kill herself by jumping off a cliff. Presumed dead, she was brought to a morgue. Carlisle, who remembered treating her years before, was able to sense her heartbeat and transformed her into a vampire. Esme fell in love and married Carlisle soon after. She loves her adoptive children as much as she did her own son, but still grieves that she is unable to bear children.<br>  <br>  Esme is present throughout the entire Twilight series, revealing her past to Bella during the Cullens' baseball game in Twilight. Esme treats Bella as her own daughter, comforting her after several traumatic events. In Breaking Dawn, it is revealed that Esme owns a South American island named "Isle Esme" that was purchased for her by Carlisle, and where Edward and Bella spend their honeymoon.|`|sEMVoJccaa	first off be true to who you really are. second off be nice and helpful to those around you and take care of them as if they were family|`|ehF2XiMbaa	Everyone has an "Esme" inside.

It decentralized the nation's banking system, allowing state-chartered banks to operate with more autonomy. It contributed to an expansion of the money supply and easier access to credit. But it also left the nation's banking system, and its money supply, without any sort of national oversight or coordination.

Her father left, her stepfather just died, and her mother’s pretty much checked out. Now Zara’s living with her grandmother in sleepy, cold Maine so that she stays “safe.” Zara doesn’t think she’s in danger; she thinks her mother can’t deal.  Wrong. Turns out that guy she sees everywhere, the one leaving trails of gold glitter, isn’t a figment of her imagination. He’s a pixie—and not the cute, lovable kind with wings. He’s the kind who has dreadful, uncontrollable needs. And he’s trailing Zara<br>   <br>  Evermore by Alyson Noel-<br>  <br>  Since a horrible accident claimed the lives of her family, sixteen-year-old Ever can see auras, hear people’s thoughts, and know a person’s life story by touch.

Susannah is a mediator, a contact point for the dead who can't (or won't) make it to the other side. The family home is a beautiful old house harbouring its own resident unsettled spirit, which has set up residence in Susannah's bedroom.

Jeb, a sympathetic scientist, helped them escape and, since then, they've been living on their own. The Erasers have orders to kill them so the world will never find out they exist.

If the book has a companion website, say a textbook that also has a website you can log into, the website will usually have its own, unique ISBN, as well, though rarely will you see or deal with it as a customer. Likewise, ISBNs go on a lot of technical resources (again, say you have a textbook and a video DVD that came with it - often the DVD will have its own ISBN number). Likewise, each edition of a book will usually have its own ISBN (again, say that there is a textbook that is customized for a state - a NY biology book and a similar, but slightly different CA biology book - each will have their own ISBN number).<br>  <br>  In fact, according to ISBN.org (a great resource):<br>  <a href="http://www.isbn.org/standards/home/isbn/us/isbnqa.asp" rel="nofollow">http://www.isbn.org/standards/home/isbn/...</a><br>  *Who is eligible for an ISBN?*<br>  The ISBN Agency assigns ISBNs at the direct request of publishers, e-book publishers, audio cassette and video producers, software producers and museums and associations with publishing programs.<br>  <br>  Also, each part of the code means something:<br>      The four parts of an ISBN are as follows: <br>      Group or country identifier which identifies a national or geographic grouping of publishers; <br>      Publisher identifier which identifies a particular publisher within a group; <br>      Title identifier which identifies a particular title or edition of a title; <br>      Check digit is the single digit at the end of the ISBN which validates the ISBN.<br>  But yeah, it is basically just an internationally recognized tracking, cataloging, and monitoring system.<br>  (This is why you often see hyphens in the number, it is breaking out each section of the code into these four areas. it is also why books by the same publisher begin with the same ISBN numbers and differentiate only at the end.)|`|TU1FeRW8aa	The International Standard Book Number, or ISBN, is a unique, numeric commercial book identifier based upon the 9-digit Standard Book Numbering (SBN) code created by Gordon Foster, now Emeritus Professor of Statistics at Trinity College, Dublin, for the booksellers and stationers W.H.

PzHgW0rUaa	Bella is thrown an eighteenth birthday party by Alice and Edward and the rest of their vampire family. While unwrapping a gift, she gets a paper cut. Edward's brother Jasper, although attempting a non-human diet, is overwhelmed by the scent of blood and tries to attack Bella. In an attempt to keep her safe from the world of vampires, Edward leaves the town of Forks, Washington with his family. Bella becomes severely depressed and seeks comfort with Jacob Black, an old family friend who eases her pain over losing Edward.<br>  <br>  Bella and Jacob develop a close friendship, and Bella soon discovers that placing herself in dangerous situations stimulates hallucinations of Edward's voice. Bella thus begins seeking out dangerous behavior, such as riding a motorcycle, to trigger the illusions. Meanwhile, Bella finds out that Jacob is a werewolf. He and his fellow werewolves begin to protect Bella from the pursuit of the vampire Victoria, who seeks revenge for the death of her mate, James, who was killed by the Cullens in Twilight.<br>  <br>  After Bella attempts cliff-diving, she gets caught in a riptide and is rescued by Jacob. Meanwhile, Alice Cullen, Edward's prophetic vampire sister, has a vision of Bella jumping off the cliff. Presuming that Bella is dead, Alice rushes to Forks to check on Charlie Swan, Bella's father. At the same time, Edward is mistakenly informed by his sister Rosalie that Bella has died. Desperate over her supposed death, Edward flees to Italy to provoke the Volturi, peace-keeping vampires who would be able to kill him.<br>  <br>  Bella and Alice rush to Italy to save Edward, and succeed in stopping him before it is too late. Before they leave Italy, the Volturi tell them that Bella, a human who knows of the existence of vampires, must either be killed or changed into a vampire herself. After they return to Forks, Edward explains to Bella that he only left in order to protect her, and she forgives him. The book ends with the Cullens voting in favor of Bella being changed into a vampire after her graduation, much to Edward's dismay.<br>  <br>  Hope that sums it up|`|xN29zstYaa	Twilight is about a girl named Bella  who moves to her dad's house in Forks, Washington.  She thinks she's going to  hate it, but she ends  up falling in  love with one of the most inhumanly hot guys  in the school(edward cullen).   He ends up being a vampire, but she doesn't  care.  Bad guys come, try to kill her, hot  guy stops him. The end.<br>  <br>  New Moon is about Edward leaving Bella for her own good. She gets very depressed and eventually goes to  see a kid named jacob.  Bella goes cliff diving  and almost drowns.   Edward thinks she  died so  he  goes to kill  himself.  She saves him they  get back together.  The End<br>  <br>  You should read  the books though,  they are extremely good  and some of the best books iv'e ever read.|`|Dfz0nJuTaa	In my opinion, it's probably my least favourite book in the series, as much of it is slow moving.<br>  Basically, Edward leaves Bella in an effort to protect her from getting mixed up in a world of vampires, and Bella is left in a zombie state from te shock. As she slowly becomes herself again with the help of Jacob, their friendship grows and Jake falls in love with her. Then, just when things start to return to normal, Alice shows up to tell Bella that Edward is trying to kill himself. They fly to Italy together and narrowly escape death, but end up bringing Edward back to Forks. <br>  You should read it though, because all Stephanie Meyer's books are amazing.|`|TV9iXOlgaa	well, u asked for a "brief" explanation but since I'm more than "just" bored, i'll give u more than a brief (i know it might annoy the hell out of u but like i care) and... SPOILER ALERT for those who haven't read the book...<br>  It goes like this: the Cullens give Bella a birthday party and Bella stupidly gives herself a paper cut while opening one of her presents and Jasper goes after her cause she got a drop of blood out of the cut. And Edward over-thinks things and the Cullens decide to leave Forks.<br>  And so Bella becomes a "zombie" (as her dad calls it, not literally). So one day, she decides to break her promise (she had promised Edward that she wouldn't do anything reckless or stupid).<br>  She gets two motorcycles that don't work for free and takes them to Jacob Black (the guy she met on the beach at La Push in Twilight) so that he can make them good again. <br>  And then, Jacob falls in love with her (ironic!). But they more or less get apart when Jacob becomes a werewolf (read Twilight? No? Great!). But he isn't allowed to tell her about it.<br>  Then, another day, when Jacob's busy running around as a giant russet wolf (she doesn't know about it anyway), she goes to find the meadow she had gone to with Edward once (in Twilight). And there, she meets the evil vampire Laurent (Twilight-related. better read Twilight before New Moon, though. email me if u want PDF (no one's going to come and arrest u for it, though) copies of the Twilight series :] ) and he tries to kill her. <br>  Right there, the wolves come and kill him.<br>  After the incident (that same night) Jacob sneaks into her house and tries to tell her everything. So, she guesses his secret and they get back together (even MORE ironic!).<br>  And, (sigh, i'm getting bored of typing) once, when Jacob's busy as a wolf again (but this time she knows what he's doing) Bella decides to go cliff-diving. In the background, Alice, her beloved vampire and member of the Cullen family, sees her do this and thinks she's committing suicide. So she comes to Forks in an effort to make things better for Charlie (Bella's dad) and sees that she's alive, after all. She doesn't realize till much later that she can't see werewolves. (The Cullens know all about the incident, (not the part that bella's alive. but no one cares enough for her. And Rosalie tells Edward about it in an effort to get him to come back home. he hears the news and goes off to Italy to the Volturi (the vampire royal family) and asks them to kill him.) Bella's incredibly happy to see her and gets her to stay at her house. And when Alice comes to know about what edward was doing, she and Bella go off to Italy to get him to come back.<br>  THE END<br>  (i took tons out of the end coz i'm running out of time)|`|AA11703549	Ed leaves bella because he romantically thinks thats best for her. She goes crazy and starts hearing his voice all over the place. Meanwhile Jacob Black develops a long, hard crush on her and becomes a werewolf. Then Bella gets word through Alice that Ed is about to try and kill himself, so she rushes halfway across the world to Italy to stop him. yadda, yadda, yadda they kiss and make up. Ed comes back, Jacob hates Ed. Ed makes Bella promise to marry him. The End.|`|MRpSUNNhaa	I have no idea(:|`|AD2e5hLqaa	First off you really should read the book because it was amazing it was my favorite book throught out the whole series.  I never got tired of it, it was that good I've read it like 5 times!<br>  <br>  Well anyway this is what it is about:<br>  In new moon everything is going good with bella and edward until bella's 18th birthday. The cullens throw her a party(well alice does) and thats when all disaster happens.  Bella gets cut and she bleeds a bit and Jasper(who is new to the veggie vamp thing) tries to attack her.  Well four days later Edward leaves her because he thinks he is doing what is best for her he is trying to put his love for her aside so she can be without the danger that he brings.  So she leaves but she doesnt know why she thinks he doesnt love her anymore.  She becomes depressed (thats how much she loved him) for about 6 months and then she starts hanging around Jacob (meanwhile these past 6 months she hasnt talked to her friends and is zombie like).  Jacob makes things more bearable for bella and she starts to become herself again.  Then Jacob goes throught the whole cant see bella because im becoming a warewolf thing but she finds out eventually (During this time Jacob has been falling in love with Bella).  Bella is also having hallucinations that she hears Edward voice but only when she does something stupid or dangerous.  Also do you remeber Victoria from the first book well she's back and is trying to kill Bella but Jacobs warewolf pack has been stoping her(because thats what they do).  So then Bella decides to jump off a cliff(recreational purposes seen jacob do it)  and she nearly drowns but jacob saves her.  (harry clearwater charlies friend dies on this day and its really hard on charlie) Alice of course with her being able to see the future sees bella jumping and thinks she is trying to kill herself so she comes back to forks to see how she can help.  Then by Rosalie Edward finds out what Bella supposedly did (kill herself) and he goes to Italy to the Voulturie to have himself killed.

Q6mMKYxZaa	If he really is your best friend, than he will understand if you get the part.  I hope that, if you are honestly his friend too, if he gets the part, you will be genuinely happy for him.<br>  Chances are good, if you are the best actor, that you will get the part, but be sure to ask the director or someone in charge what they think of a female lead.  <br>  If you can hit the notes that they ask for, and sound good, you really don't have anything to worry about.<br>  you just need to understand that if he is really your friend, he would want what's best for you, nothing more, nothing less.<br>  <br>  Bonne chance, break a leg!<br>  I hope you do well, and I'm sure that everything will turn out just fine.|`|Ic3hceIOaa	Let fate happen. Try out and if you get it great! Encourage him to get more work done so he has experience. If you get it be supportive no matter what, try doing backstage stuff or be a techie. Don't say your horrible just because he got the part either, he (as you said) probably fit the part better. Break a leg!|`|ZBtl6k0zaa	just try out and if you make it and your friend doesn't tell your friend it's ok . because a musical should not get in the way of friends!
DIlNnjf8aa	* The oldest ears of popcorn ever found were discovered in the Bat Cave of west central New Mexico in 1948 and 1950. Ranging from smaller than a penny to about 2 inches, the oldest Bat Cave ears are about 4,000 years old.<br>  <br>      * Popcorn was integral to early 16th century Aztec Indian ceremonies. Bernardino de Sahagun writes: "And also a number of young women danced, having so vowed, a popcorn dance. As thick as tassels of maize were their popcorn garlands. And these they placed upon (the girls') heads."
Ic3hceIOaa	There are a lot of choices, you can try checking out a play book at the library or bookstore. Like Great Monologues for Young Actors, Vol. 1 or Great Monologues in Dialect for Young Actors There is one that's really funny monologue if you can find it called Drowned Out by Robert Patrick, or look on one of these sites:<br>  <a href="http://www.whysanity.net/monos/" rel="nofollow">http://www.whysanity.net/monos/</a><br>  <a href="http://www.stagepage.info/monologs/Winquest.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.stagepage.info/monologs/Winqu...</a><br>  <a href="http://www.artsonthemove.co.uk/resources/scripts/scriptswomen.php" rel="nofollow">http://www.artsonthemove.co.uk/resources...</a><br>  <a href="http://www.whysanity.net/monos/others.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.whysanity.net/monos/others.ht...</a>|`|SezOZE0haa	Are you needing a real monologue or can it be a dramatic interp piece where you play more than one role?<br>  <br>  Try the confrontation scene between mother and daughter in the wonderful old play, The Bad Seed by Maxwell Anderson.  VERY dramatic.<br>  <br>  If it must be a solo, take a look at Tennessee William's play, Cat on a Hot Tin Roof. There is a scene where Maggie is talking to her husband (who is offstage taking a shower).  It's a great scene. Drama and humor and gives you a great chance to move around the stage and even use a southern accent.
MYkqiYSzaa	Hey:......<br>  <br>     You could get by with as little as 100 watts.  But, that would all depend on WHERE you place the amp.  A big big mistake I see a lot of novice bass players make is on small combo amps, they still want them on the ground.  Well, ive yet to see ankles or shins with ears! <br>  <br>       Depending on the size of the stage, ive played out with as little as 100 watts with a single 15.  The amp is placed on a homemade stand which is very portable that brings it up to about chest high on me and has a slight tiltback angle on the stand.  On these particular gigs, our guitar player is using 2- 20 watt Roctron Rampage amps that are also mic'd, and his homemade stands are also quite high.  Face it, some of these clubs have very small stages, and the more volume on stage makes for very hard hearing of everyone else.  Thats why we have these custom made stands. <br>  <br>      As far as an 18" speaker for bass rigs, you dont see a lot of them anymore.  An 18" speaker has to move a LOT of air, and also requires a lot of power.    It is nice to have a few rigs laying around for all occasions, and over the years ive been able to acquire them.  My smallest I play out with is a 100 Peavey with a single 15, and my big rig is a QSC 2400 watt power amp, an Ampeg 2 channel tube preamp, and 2 Ampeg 8X10 cabs.  I also have inbetween rigs.  If at all possible, I would suggest something along the lines of a 300 watter with a couple of 10's.  Either head and cab, or combo.  When you do get on somewhat bigger stages, that usually means bigger club, and more horsepower out front.  At times, that can be kinda difficult with a 100 watt rig.  Or... you can always do like Geddy does from Rush.  Preamp to F.O.H.... then.... in ear monitors!<br>  <br>  <br>     Hope this has helped.. and KEEP PLAYIN!|`|S0KbFkCPaa	Probably the best amps should be at least 20 inches long and at least 15 inches deep. Marshall-brand amplifiers would be best...I had seen them in most indie punk bands....and those who do not do heavy metal.|`|LQG4yI6uaa	In terms of power you probably want something that is 350W or more - it takes quite a bit of power to bring out the bass guitar without distortion. In terms of a speaker or speaker cabinet, you probably want something like a cabinet with an 18" and a 10" or maybe 4 10" speakers... most bass players have something like two cabinets - one with an 18" and one with 4 10"s. Good brands for bass amps are Mesa, Peavey, Ampeg, SWR, Trace Elliott, Fender.

c06f9e62b2e3de70492245a069ccbf6aaa	UK answer.<br>  Here in the UK in order to find a specific grave without having to pay a search fee, you have to have a date of death, without a  death date here in Nottingham the search fee is ￡25:00, this varies around the country. If you have a death certificate for the person at least that  will tell you where they died, from there it's guess work. Best thing to do is phone the council office for the city or town and ask for the local cemeteries list then just work your way through them.<br>   Here in Nottingham, graves are left alone until they reach 100 yrs old.<br>  Hope this helps.|`|GPrw1JZkaa	If you know the cemetery go there and there should be an office /hut place there they have a book of all the graves|`|RkfIPD7Iaa	If you know what cemetery they were buried in, you can go there and ask to see their records.

Well, not my name... some damn name you gave me. But they were chanting for me. I was in magazines. You think I ever dreamed that'd happen? I was born two pounds, one-and-a-half ounces. Daddy used to tell me I'd fight my way into this world, and I'd fight my way out. That's all I wanna do, Frankie. I just don't wanna fight you to do it. I got what I needed. I got it all. Don't let 'em keep taking it away from me. Don't let me lie here 'till I can't hear those people chanting no more."<br>  <br>  My god its amazing!
