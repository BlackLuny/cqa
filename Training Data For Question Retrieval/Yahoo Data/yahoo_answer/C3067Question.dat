20090304131152AAV0wlB	Local Businesses;United States;New York City	I need to rent a Hall in NJ, preferably Bergen County or nearby for CHEAP, but nothing TACKY!!?	I need a hall, white or beige walls, and NO paneling. I need to seat 100 people and room for a small group to perform a cappella 50's music, and/or room for a dancefloor. I need it to be in or around bergen county- Rockland county is ok, but south-western area, and Passaic county is ok too. I either need a CHEAP hall, or a restaurant with a dancefloor area, that will make the food too. I have a VERY limited budget, and this is my fiance's first marriage so he wants a nice party. We are having a 50's theme, but PLEASE some suggestions! Thanks!!!

20090304133848AAcbIxh	Local Businesses;United Kingdom;London	I want to start up a small course (classroom based) in London. Teaching people how to setup a basic website?	The course will focus on using WordPress as a CMS. Users will be guided through registering a domain name, registering with a hosting provider that supports Fantastico (a script installer, to make WordPress installation really straightforward) and finally how to install and run a WordPress website.      I'm unemployed , living in London and have no idea where to start or who to approach for premises, advice etc.. I'd need somewhere fully kitted out with ready to go pc's and a network (with internet access) connection for each workstation, plus an overhead projector connected to a tutors pc.      I've taught lessons before, when I used to be a lecturer of IT in Bromley. But have since lost touch with my old contacts and really only want to do this part time , to help pay bills and keep me going until I can start my Psychology Degree in September.      Any help, support or even offers of partnership would be totally appreciated.      Many thanks,   Lee      PS,   I have zero startup capital, so would need to get payments up front or at least have access to a classroom willing to accept late payments.
