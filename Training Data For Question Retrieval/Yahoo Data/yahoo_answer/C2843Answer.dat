SxI38HILaa	the pros arwe smaller staff and lower cost but then you have the added cost of paper products for take out. the cons are it can be ruff to get up and going
RWEyZZXWaa	Nope, worked at both McD's and BK never saw that.  That kind of crap usually happens in fine dining.  You know your local top dollar steak house.  If they drop a 16 oz. Kobe T-bone on the floor and that sucker cost them $46/lb. that's not going in the trash!<br>  So think about that for a bit.|`|AA11828439	You really need to stop listening to idiotic rumors. Every restaurant undergoes Health Department screenings. The ratings are posted outside the door.|`|ZpDvYoakaa	Depends on which Ronald McDonald is working. If its my uncle, then pretty dirty because he is a potty mouth. If it is a shorter guy named Steve, then I would just stay out of there because he is a pig and says stuff to all the kids.|`|GHd84xipaa	McDonalds like all other restaurants they have to pass health inspections.so i say they are pretty clean.|`|ZuQUU50Gaa	nobody really knows|`|gLXzVbm8aa	i had seen a picture of a chicken head fried with the chicken nuggets|`|SCiY5JESaa	I SAW ONE DROPPED IN THE MOP BUCKET, PULLED OUT AND GRILLED STILL THAT WAS 20 YEARS AGO, IM SURE THEY STILL DO THAT FOR MINMUM WAGE,THEY SHOULD RAISE THE WAGE TO WORK THERE BECAUSE  THE FRANCHISE REALLY RAKES IT IN|`|pueeMH6gaa	Let me put it this way, I heard they have a sign in their staff bathroom that says "washing your hands take valuable time.

We keep ours very clean.|`|cjLwIpSsaa	yeah it si really dirty there there is ketchup on the floor<br>  and a hole bunch of stuff all over!!!!    :(|`|X3cCC7H7aa	depends on the restaurant employees and the manager. Don't listen to these fools talking about health department checks. The health department only shows up if they get several legit complaints. They also do a SCHEDULED walk through every couple of years. Its pretty easy to clean up if u have several days notice. <br>  <br>  The worst things i have ever seen in a fast food joint are:<br>  1.) I saw someone spit in the mayo<br>  2.) someone played floor hockey (kicked across the dirty floor) buns and rolls<br>  3.) I saw someone put a slice of cheese down their pants then grill it on a hamburger<br>  4.) someone after a 8 hour shift swept the floor then used the material in an omellete.|`|LXP2agOYaa	they passed their health inspections they got like a 100,94,88 on it
mvKDbb2uaa	Yes.  The Shake Shack inside Madison Square Park is fun.  When you go there, keep in mind that it's only really a take-out window and it's outdoor seating.  So, if the weather is bad you'll have to tough it out on a bench or find someplace warm to sit.<br>  <br>  * John's Pizzeria<br>  * Lombardi's<br>  * Grey's Papaya for hotdogs<br>  <br>  There are tons of places to eat.  Wherever you end up, there'll be some place good.|`|bQraDPLUaa	Well there are tons, but the very first thing I thought of was Shake Shack - everyone loves the Shack Burger but I think the 'Shroom Burger is a Must Eat. Its 2 portobello stuffed with muenster and cheddar cheese then deep fried and served on a potato bun with leaf lettuce, tiny tomatoes, shack sauce, chopped onions, and pickles.

Brooklyn is also a great place to find great inexpensive food. there's: <br>  <br>  Black Betty it's on 366 metropolitan ave <br>  also Planet Thai on 133 North 7th street. these places in Brooklyn are only 15 minutes (or less) from Manhattan. you won't be disappointed.|`|kbxkkOYVaa	FAST FOOD:<br>  Nathan's<br>  McDonalds<br>  Wendy's<br>  Burger King<br>  K.F.C<br>  Popeyes<br>  White Castle<br>  RESTUARANTS:<br>  Red Lobster<br>  Little French Town<br>  Malibu Waves<br>  Johnny's Pizzaria<br>  L and B's (pizza)|`|QrPgKtl4aa	da nico's for italian, that's on mullberry st. in little italy. great!!!!!! cheap and fun.|`|93C2PZetaa	John's pizza is amazing!

nxeQFPEfaa	I order a bowl of zuppa toscana soup with fresh grated cheese...dip my breadsticks in the alfredo dipping sauce, have water with that and then when my portabello ravioli comes out I get a glass of house blush wine. Delicious :) I even usually get another bowl of soup because I can't stop myself!|`|ozWi3TJlaa	When they have it, I love their Chicken Marsala...it's stuffed with cheesy mashed potatoes.
