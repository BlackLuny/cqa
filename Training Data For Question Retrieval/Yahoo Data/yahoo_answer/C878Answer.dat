I applaud you for your awareness and desire to deliver like you would if you worked for a business that was not run by your family. My brother worked for my dad for a while, and I think he took advantage of the situation.<br>  <br>  Here's what I would do.  Sit down with your boss (aka Dad) and tell him that you want to deliver like you would for any other employer.  Agree with him what your job responsibilities are, how your job performance will objectively be measured and when he will do an evaluation of your performance.  Insist that your pay be tied to the performance of the business and how well he thinks you have met your performance goals.   Deliver more than he expects!  <br>  <br>  Best of luck!

0CnW95saaa	To be honest...you can do anything.<br>  <br>  What you need to consider it to make real money is to multiply your time.  If you're going to mow lawns, the best way is to schedule yourself 100 lawns to be mowed at a certain price (say $15 a 1/4 acre per mowing.) and get others your age who need cash to go mow those lawns for you at a rate of $10-$11 per mowing).  If you do nothing else you'll make $400-$500 per mowing schedule just for being a good scheduler.  Plus you'll make 5 other guys your age pretty happy to make $200 or so each.<br>  <br>  Same can go with babysitting...or some other service oriented business that most 15-year olds do.<br>  <br>  Whatever you decide...multiply your time by being the boss, getting all the business and spreading it among friends.  <br>  <br>  The final word on this is: Integrity.

0CnW95saaa	As a former loan officer...the highest FICO necessary for any loan was 720.  Most loans are prime if you are 680 or better.  As long as your Loan To Value isn't ridiculous (like 95% or over 100%) then you're fine.<br>  <br>  If I were you, I'd see what I could do to make sure it was 720 or better.|`|jVeEfJnkaa	It honestly depends what is on your credit report.  Your debt ratio also along with current spending with your credit cards and any new loans.  Are you consolidating your bills?  Are you trying to get cash out?  There are a number of things that lenders consider such as are you going 110% ltv for the refinance or less?  What will your debt ratio be after you refinance?  700 credit score actually is pretty good if there isn't something really negative on it.  Keep in mind that the number of inquiries on your credit report further lowers your score too.    <br>  <br>  There are so many things that a lender considers and a lender also has to show a tangible benefit just for approving the loan.  This means, at least 10k cash out, changing from an arm loan to a fixed, dropping monthly payments at least 100.00 with the refinance.   Ask a lot of questions before you refinance such as points you will pay too.  Lenders in most states will charge up to 4 points (4% of the loan) just for financing in addition to an appraisal or home value estimate (electronic valuation without an appraiser coming into your home)  and tax assessed valuation is only good in Kansas with most lenders.  <br>  <br>  So an answer to your question is best asked to your lender because of all the factors involved.  In the company I work for, 700 credit score is typically A credit with interest/apr being the lowest offered.<br>  <br>  Good Luck!|`|8zdE8Ic5aa	No, it shouldn't.  If your loan to value is under 95%, you should be able to get a 5.875% interest rate on a 30 year fixed (if that is what you want).  I am closing refi's with that rate right now with borrowers who have 700 or over.  Irregardless of whether your score is a 780 or 700, I'd be able to get you the same rate so, in your case, it works out.<br>  I am a personal mortgage consultant and a member of the National Assocation of Responsible Loan Officers.  If you have any other questions that you would like to ask regarding your refinance, please feel free to visit my website at www.vegasloansbytami.com|`|SbY4zGPIaa	It doesn't....You would get the same rates if you were 780 or 640.....700 and above is A credit, and B credit is 620 and up....lots of people don't know that......|`|r5v3Ctqaaa	Typically, 700 is the benchmark used for A+ credit, and you would get the best rate available on a loan with an 80% LTV. IF you are looking for a 100% loan, or a stand alone second with a CLTV of 100%, then some lenders would prefer a 720 FICO or better to be able to get the best rate, but this would only affect the second loan, not the first. <br>  ALso, if you were providing full documentation, you would get better rate than going Stated Income, unless if the loan was under 70% LTV, then it wouldn't matter, Hope this answered all your questions, if not, you can find out more info about loans and credit on my website at: www.mtg-cafe.com

0Ei3ePJzaa	I answered a similar question, yesterday, by a young man who was very volatile in berating people for their response to rational argument.    When I was a teenager, I was so angry at everything, would argue black was white and used to say horrible things.  I could never admit my faults and saying sorry would have been like admitting I was wrong.    I did turn a corner, after my first child at 25, whether it was my hormones, or the fact that I was too busy to get angry, or that I someone to make me smile most of the time - it finally stopped.    There is an end in sight.  However, if you are much older, they don't call the song "Sorry seems to be the hardest word" for nothing!  We are fearful that our apology will be thrown back in our faces - I can totally see where you are coming from.    Try to relax, try to take deep breaths and count to ten, but, if you can't, perhaps you should talk to a professional about it - it may just help.|`|e08eab35a22f0c6bf7f5ba2c6c22c1f9aa	you have a high dignity but think of it this way, if you feel wrong say sorry but with dignity if not explain your point of view and don;t feel sorry.|`|AA12050428	I don't think you do genuinely think you are wrong, you must feel very certain of your own opinion.

LYHJ8gqFaa	I have experience using both...I would compare it to a convience store.  You go to the payroll service for the convienece...they take care of everything.  Or you canuse the software, which is easy but you have to take time out of your day to do it OR pay someone to come in and do it.  We used a company called AllStaffing.  They did a great job, we submitted the hours for each employee and they cut the checks and sent them to us.  With 6 employees though it might be a better idea to do it yourself.
Qqz0H2hEaa	If it is a co- mortgage then FHA would even allow you to buy this on one of their loans at 3.5% down.    But you should figure the loan payments with all the costs. I think what you are quoting for payments is only the principal and interest.  You will also need to have money for property taxes and homeowners insurance.  (besides other costs of home ownership)|`|8yQYmxVOaa	You would have to re mortgage the home in order to have them off the mortgage and have it in your name only. You will not improve your credit that much in 6 months in order to do that. Very generous and nice of them add to that the fact that you want to drop to one income which will make it unaffordable for to by the banks standards. At $36000 a year you cannot afford a 130K home along with all the responsibility that comes with it lose part of that income and you will be in the foreclosure ranks. Don't forget to add taxes and insurance to the payment|`|687852ecae21fabd1dfd4f89a2eefd48aa	Normally this would be a very good gesture however,  with the economy in shambles and daily layoffs and job terminations - it may not be a good idea.

Unless your parents are living in the home and it is their primary residents they will not get 4.75%. If your parents state that it is their primary residents and its not then it is Mtg fraud. If you have a low credit score, having a co-signer with a high score will not help you.  This is because lenders go by the borrower with the lowest score when doing a qualification or approval.    A co-signer will not compensate for poor credit. Also the only way to get your parents off the loan would be to refi and do it all over again.|`|1c674c32f70abbba9b74d0e568421553aa	you will not have the same rate. who knows what it will me in a year.

They bought what they couldn't afford.|`|2aa50f1e98c6ed8d4839912a33e5565daa	Now is a very fantastic time to buy a home, but be sure to look at your own finances, and make sure things are stable (and will remain so).    There's a tax credit that can give $7500 if you buy a home before June this year.  Right now, you have to pay it back over 15 years, at 500 a year on your taxes.   If the current stimulus bill passes, it will not need to be payed back (if you live there for 3 years).  So now *is* a great time to invest in a home.    I think your parents and in-laws could help in 2 ways:  1- Help you and your fiance with the down payment.  This is really where most new home buyers need the most help.  2- Help co-sign (or get a low interest rate).  It is a huge sign of trust on their part to do this. If you don't feel comfortable letting them do this, just allow them to give you some assistance on the down payment.

sI3krJULaa	On the state returns, your AGI is calculated using only the income earned in whatever state you're working on.  So, for federal, your AGI would be calculated using all of your income ($38), but on your CA return, you would calculate your AGI using just the $4, and on the NV return, you'd use the $34.    So in other words, your Federal return includes all income earned everywhere in AGI, and your state returns include only the income you earned in that specific state, so that if you added up all of the income on your various state returns, you'd end up with the total you have on your federal return.    Hope that helps. :0)

n3Cgzfxgaa	i'm sitting far away in london as i write this & option 3 smells like a rip off even from here.  to be fair you dont say what you get for your money, but i'd expect something substantial for that kind of money.  as you know education in our generation has morphed into a multi billion dollar global industry, much of it very worthwhile, some less so.  If you really want to consider option 3 i would suggest approaching the organisation who runs the course and say that you are interested but you feel that the asking price is out of step with the current economic climate, and have a lower offer in mind that you can afford yet still compensates them adequately for their skill, costs, etc.  remember its a barista course, not training for an MD & even great baristas arent exactly on a get rich quick scheme. these courses have become highly fashionable & were to a certain extent symptomatic of the long period of economic prosperity that has just come to a rather abrupt end.    regards option 1 you dont mention costs, but i assume that it is more than option 3?  again, be careful, it sounds as though it might be too general and touch on too many issues at a superficial level only.  a vsat amount of information help and support on how to run a small business can be pieced together from trawling the web    option 2: i think right idea, but it needs modification.  i dont know much about the specific economic conditions where you live, but my guess is that if they are anything like 'average' that they wont be as bouyant as they were.  that said, i still think your best bet is to obtain work at the cafe that is regarded as the best in your area.  if you pester them long enough/put your name on a waiting list/whatever i think you will eventually find yourself with paid employment there.  in my experience the people who run the best cafes recognise quality in all aspects of their business, and are prepared to pay for it.  the places who run sweatshops, focus on cost to the extreme with no regard for quality and jump at the chance to have staff for 'free' are usually a commericial failure sooner or later.  places like that dont have a good vibe, you dont attract the best staff (unsurprisingly), and so they always struggle.    so in summary, the best place to learn is in the cauldron of commercial reality.  it might sound a bit harsh, but those who can do, those who cant teach.  u/fort it is true all over the world.  we still need teachers and they make a very valuable contribution to society.  i just think that if you want to eventually run, then own a cafe yourself the best place to learn is at the most successful place you can find.  take a bit of time & you will need to be persistent.  paying thousands of dollars for a barista course does not seem like a wise investment to me, particularly at the moment.  you might also be able to find someone who is a good barista that you could engage in a skill swap with, at least to get started. i.e. barista teaches you how to become a barista, you teach them something in return; its an idea anyway.    ps - i'm not anti-education, i am a qualified lawyer and accountant, but i do think some of the prices asked for some courses have lost touch with reality.  at some point you must measure the value of the course against your potential earnings, right?

Because the credit card company has already losing revenue by giving you a 0% APR credit card offer it could try to compensate with a higher APR after the intro period expires.

What are other fees and benefits of the credit card?<br>  <br>  0% APR coupled with a high annual fees and other charges could wipe out the savings you intend by taking a 0% APR credit card. Also ensure the APR on cash advances, purchases, and balance transfer. If a 0% APR credit card offer tries to compensate for the loss in revenue by charging exorbitant APRs on other services its better to avoid it. Knowing about the different features and benefits is also helpful.<br>  <br>  The idea is not to get ripped off by the credit card companies and get maximum benefits on the 0% APR credit card.

You must pretend to be more intelligent than all of them by allowing them to give you diverse opinion about how a problem could be solved and then summarize and give them the solution they love most.<br>  4. Every money collected from them and all expenditure incerred even the bank balances must be made open to them at an agreed time.<br>  5. You must follow the constitution to the letter.<br>  6.

If your debt to income is more than fifty percent, you will probably not qualify.  Also, they take into acount any credit on your cards you have not used.  So if you have a card that has $3000 on it but you have a limit of $6000, they take that in account since that is credit that is still available to you.|`|uX05dLDwaa	There is only one way to find out, that is to apply.

The reason being that it offers a low 2.99% Fixed APR for LIFE on balances transferred within 3 months. That is an offer which few credit card companies can match. With this excellent balance transfer rate the Advanta Life-of-Balance Platinum Card offers Up to 6% Cash Back or Travel Rewards. The credit card has No annual fee, and the reward program has no limits on earnings. On the whole a good credit card to transfer the balances.

I say don't apply for a WaMu credit card. Once they run the credit check it will drop your FICA score by several points rather they approve your or not. The 0% rate is just for a short time then the rate will increase. If you are late with a payment it can go as high as 23.99% according to the statment I have in front of me. Then if they do approve you it may not be enough to transfer the $8400. Continue paying as your are. Try to get whom ever you are indebit with to lower your interest rate.

Then you will know what you need to do or not do.  It also stops you being exploited, and lets the employer know that you know what you need to be doing.  If they don't write it down, at least ask them, and stick to it.

If you lease from an individual property owner, getting out of it can be as easy as just talking to your landlord.

Either way, if you have a good enough lawyer, you can get out of any apartment lease.|`|48RjJrxnaa	Yes.  You signed a contract saying that you would be financially responsible with 2 other people.  The owner doesn't care if your situation changed.   You might be lucky and the owner may work with you to get out of it or find some one to take over the lease.  Best of luck to you.|`|sGYl7971aa	Did every one of you sign the lease?

51a6d6928f591b718bc15d0453872e8daa	I have personally just completed a program back in April 2008 so I know first hand the effects before and after<br>  <br>  When you are first enrolled a notation will be on your credit report that states somethng like, "payments arranged thru debt management plan" so while you're in the program the creditors that have accepted this arrangement will tell you not to open any new credit while in the program as a condition of them reducing your interest rate, and eliminating some fees --  being in a program has no effect on your credit score!  I personally was able to obtain to get a car while in the program but my interest rate was high but not due to the program it was due to my my neglience in paying some bills on time thus is the reason I enrolled in the program in the first place <br>  <br>  It took me 3 years to pay my debt off so after I was done the notation was removed from my report and it show that all my accounts have been paid but to potential creditors viewing my file they will not know it was thru a program since there is no notation...since then I am a better manager of my credit and have been able to get 2 credit cards with decent limits of $1,000 and $2,000.....before the program my score was low 500's now it is 670 and improving as I pay bills on time and use my credit cards sparingly<br>  <br>  Since you don't want more credit that'll be good since you're in the program because if you get new credit while in the program the creditors you have enrolled can drop you and have the original terms of your debt in place....so in sum to answer your question it will not have an effect as far as score but rather the effect of not being able to obtain credit!  |`|L4rlu2BDaa	Your best option is to negotiate with your creditors yourself, write them a letter. Always keep a copy for yourself, as well as all and any replies and send letters recorded if possible. Also make sure they have all the appropriate details, account numbers, names on the agreements etc. Write in the letter that your currently having difficulty keeping up with the repayments of the loan or credit cards and wish to come to an agreement with them for a reduced payment plan, you can also ask if they would be willing to freeze the interest. Most companies will now accept these requests because there more interested in getting back the money they lent you then squeezing you for more interest, you defaulting and it resulting in them having to sell the debt for a quarter of what its worth to a debt collection agency.Once you have the basic letter written out (use the same letter for each company just change the details) sit down with all your monthly bills for the last 3 months, everything from mortgage or rent to even the smallest of things such as magazine subscriptions. Work out from all the bills you currently pay at the average rate over the 3 months how much money you have going out. Then prioritise them with rent, council tax, gas, electric and water being most important, and work your way down the list. See if there's any thing there you could get rid of or find a cheaper deal on. If you have internet, cable and telephone with different companies look into a bundle which can save you ￡20-￡30 a month. virgin media do great deals. see if there's anything else there you can cut out for a while. Now you have everything listed, write how much you need for each, don't do the debts quite yet though but everything else. How much do you have left over a month? Now take a cut for yourself, leaving yourself with nothing each month will make your more likely to overspend when your mums birthday comes around and you haven't any spare cash to buy anything, so you dip into the bills pot and you forget to put it back and the bank charges you ￡35 for not enough funds to clear a direct debit. So make sure you take a slice for yourself, just so you have a bit of spare cash. After you have your cut, see how many debts you have and share the amount between them according to priority. for example if you have 3 debts, 2 credit cards and a loan. take the most expensive credit card and give it 40% of what money you have to pay off your debts, and 25% to the other credit card and 15% to the loan. leave the other 10% forbargainingg. Once you have your amounts, fill in the blanks on your letters. Start off with the credit card, state that you can reasonably afford to pay what ever the 40% is each month. do the same for the other debts and wait for a responce, they may not accept your first offer so use the other 10% you have left to up it a bit but never go over what you can afford. If they ask for ￡50 instead of the ￡40 you offered, offer ￡42 using the extra 10%bargainingg money. if they still decline, don't go any higher write a letter back asking for a company of your original credit agreement as you wish to take any further matters up with a solicitor and watch how fast they accept your offer. do this for them all, once everything is ok. Set a date for payments using a standing order, keep all letters sent back and forth in case further down the line they decide theywantt to up the payment and you could use these in court if they try anything on.|`|b217c37cf583bbd373500c267afbc847aa	I'm afraid so. A debt management plan is one step short of bankruptcy and it going to badly damage your credit report.

If you entered into one then you're basically telling creditors that you can't afford repayments. However, it's a better step to take than getting into out of control debt and declaring bankruptcy. The "damage" on your credit report would be better if you entered into a debt management plan as opposed to going bankrupt which could happen if you're struggling.|`|e0b62552bbf10bf0f752d89981afac86aa	your debt management company will negotiate payments you can afford under certain terms.

In other words, I would evaluate your cost and time and compare that to what you might receive when compared to others.  Also, study what kinds of figurines or carvings people tend to buy.  Can you make similiar items or unique items that no one has thought of making?  For instance, I collect bird and apple figurines, and when I try to purchase these items off of eBay, I always have competitors trying to outbid me.  Therefore, I would watch online auctions and evaluate what you have to offer accordingly.  Good luck!|`|17bafe1fbe6fa3fcc046bb928984229eaa	What's a lot of money to you?

But, I imagine there would be a lot of competition.  Look around and see what's out there, what's selling, and the prices that people are charging.  If you can keep your costs low and undercut the competition, you could conceivably make a lot of money.  Also, you'll need a good advertising strategy.

So we are considering paying our MR dues only so it does not go faster.<br>  <br>  If your property is part of a Mello-Roos or Assessment District, your property may be subject to an accelerated foreclosure lien. This can result in additional interest, penalties, collection costs and legal fees if you don't pay your tax bill on time.

Or, you should contact the District and attempt to pay that portion of your bill separately to avoid any accelerated foreclosure action. <br>  <br>  the only thing I cannot figure out is if the unpaid taxes go on your credit report or not since they do get paid, just by the lender. |`|AA10408967	they file a lein against your property.  depending on the county, they will begin auctioning yourproperty aftersome peopr of time,I thinkg between 90 days and 2 years.|`|SZ5NZ9uaaa	If the loan is foreclosed, the taxes would be due by the mortgage holder as well as the property.|`|umOYW4yYaa	they send you to detroit|`|InbUOjKIaa	you get shanked by the mob, you get your stuff stolen and the will probably kneecap you. |`|2N6oTOLQaa	The home will be foreclosed.

You gave up your right to sell the property when you gave her the deed.<br>  <br>  However, check with the title company and make sure it is in her name.

Her wording is short, polite and you get your information. |`|AkUZVboKaa	Call and simply ask if a decision has been made since your interview last week.  If it is a retail job, I would say to show enthusiasm for their product and your "one" call will show that you are good at selling yourself which helps when selling client products.   Let them know that you know that your interview was just last week, but that you believe you are the best person for the position because you love to service clients in the retail industry.   Remember that customer service is number one and say that as well in your call.

You should just take it as a learning experience and you will do better at your next interview!|`|F35vMJkCaa	Sure I have. I bet most people have. Rejection is hard to take in life. Be it job interviews, dating - lots of things.<br>  <br>  I was reading this on web site about job interviews:<br>  "Repeated rejections can sap your energy and leave you feeling angry, frustrated and less confident than you were when you started applying for jobs.

Been there - done that!!<br>  <br>   |`|Cd5iL6Elaa	yeah i felt terrible but just think of something funny about it, ie, the guy that interviewed me sounded like peter kay and i was distracted and kept thinking he was going to say 'tinternet'. dont worry about it don't let it get to you, theres bound to be plenty of other places that want to take you on for all sorts of different skills you have.|`|AA10025168	Of course, but I wouldn't let it get to me. I felt that the position wasn't right for me. I was thinking about good things about me. Just say to yourself that it is the company's loss and not yours. That is what I did every rejection I had.|`|WaI693jHaa	Quite a few times, but you learn something new every time, so don't worry.<br>  <br>  There's a job out there that is made for you, and you are just made for some company out there.<br>  <br>  Now think about what you learnt in the interview, i.e. where you did well and where you didn't do so well, and it will work next time!|`|KtdlJbrOaa	Yes, but I just take that as the job was not meant for me.  In my case, I was right, & now have a job I really enjoy.  Good luck!|`|8JfVY6m0aa	once...but the woman was obviously a fool lol <br>  don't let it get you down, interview experience is valuble and the next interview you get you'll be better. |`|fb0319752815c0e125149b667bb593e3aa	Of course I have. Actually, when I was jobless in the first half of this year, I went to 3 interviews and I didn't get any job. I did feel bad, that's understandable, but it just wasn't meant to be. |`|AA11238296	Yes i have but i think it was because the woman who interviewed me looked like a man and i found it rather distracting<br>  <br>  Dont feel down, plenty more fish in the sea and all that. |`|a4HrgXZlaa	No but because im quite nervous im sure i will do in the future. Things will work out for you though mate, everyone experiences rejection in their life. I hope it's just made your more determined to go out there and fight back!
AA11554087	Post Office offer a fair exchange rate|`|b217c37cf583bbd373500c267afbc847aa	Take the number of pounds you have and multiply it by the exchange rate. That should give you the number of dollars you will get from your pounds!|`|XOnk1rBcaa	Travelex.|`|VIdOMprwaa	(1) It depends on the amounts we are talking about. Given you're asking the question here - lets assume it's not that much (less than ￡5000).<br>  (2) It depends on what you want to do with the $USD once you hold them. How long do you intend to keep the sum for?<br>  (3) If you just want to hold cash...then just search for good rates at the time on google (you'll find all you need right there)<br>  (4) If you want to hold for any period of time....look into getting a $USD bank account with your local bank. They can open one up for you and you can transfer $USD in/out etc.<br>  <br>  You might be waiting some time for a 1.6 rate though!!!<br>  Good luck<br>  <br>  PS.  Don't follow the advice from Kevin above.....do you really think that your bank doesn't have a special exchange rate for foreign currency transactions through an ATM? Think again!  Getting some cash out this way is fine when on holiday...but not clever for frequency or any reasonable sums.|`|utMcsTlUaa	Whenever traveling abroad, the cheapest way to transfer is to not carry any of the foreign money with you until you get there. Then, once here, use a credit card or ATM card to get cash or buy things, as these have the best exchange rate since no companies are looking for profit.

Although I do this myself as well as the planting and picking of the food once it is grown, gee my bones are getting tired of this. Perhaps some other middle aged workers are getting tired and they would appreciate some assistance in this regard. So young people, do you know anyone out there with a garden? Go ask them if you can pick some weeds for them and I bet they'd cry or hug you. Do it for free. Do not charge them. You will get some hard working skills, you'll feel so good about yourself, you'll help us older workers that are now growing tired, and probably the person would give you a few dollars for helping them out. And maybe they know some other people that need this type of service.<br>  <br>  Animal Care - Like animals? Put up an ad in the grocery store that you will babysit their dog or their cat when they go on a vacation, or when they are unable to sit with their dog. You'd pet them and give their animal a lot of loving attention, you'd take their dog or cat outside and put it on a leash. you'd feed and water the animal. You could even sleep overnight and sit and keep their animal company. Now I know someone who actually does all of this and gets paid. Now not everyone would be able to have the time to do this for quality time or do it well. Some may have to do what most of us do, go unlock the friend or neighbor's dog. Let the dog or cat outside. Let the dog or cat inside. Feed and water the cat or the dog. Sit on a chair or a couch and play with the animal, pet them, talk to them, etc. Maybe you'd have a half hour or so to talk to them. Then you'd have to go home as you have a lot to do.<br>  <br>  Dog Cutting Hair Stylers - Like dogs? My dog needs her hair clipped although she hates it and so do I. Still I take the scissors and cut her hair and her mats of when it is necessary. Many people start doing this and then have later their very own business AT HOME!!

AA12257018	If I understand your question properly, you want to buy a property and you're looking for an exit strategy? Right?<br>  <br>  If so, avoid rent-to-own as an investor because unless your option fee is less than 1.5 times the monthly rent and no monthly payments contribute to the price of the home, you'll have a hard time evicting the tennant if they stop paying (at least in California). <br>  <br>  Don't rent, use a lease instead. The difference is rent is a monthly contract where a lease is usually for a year or more. You'll have more control of your tenants with a lease than with a monthly rental.<br>  <br>  Now all options you have listed are for a buy and hold strategy. Ideally, you want to make sure that the property has a positive cash flow with a steady appreciation value.<br>  <br>  Hopefully that answers your question. If you're a foreign investor, I do short term investing in which I buy properties at a discount(usually from the lender) and resell them. Let me know if you want to get involved and you have at least 50k to invest.  <br>  <br>  Regards|`|b173c4a610bfd7a580c6a883ffcb93bbaa	Renting / Leasing is always a temporary thing while you build up your credit to get an actual decent mortgage to own a home.<br>  Unless you do some kind of a bad deal, purchasing a home is really the only decent option. <br>  <br>  When you calculate your expenses ratio of renting versus owning you will find out that after only 3 years your gains in favor to owning is like 200% versus renting. Yes even taking into account paying home owners taxes and insurances.<br>  <br>  As for Seller-financing (your 3rd option) is a very viable choice as it gives you ownership after a (long) period of time but it does have some majors con. <br>  1- You are tied to one home and you can only sell it and make a profit at the end of the period you agreed with the owners. And usually it's more than 5 years. That can be pretty bad for most people.<br>  2- You are basically paying the owners the same you would do to a bank but for some crazy interest rate like 9+%<br>  <br>  The only pro is that home owners are more lenient than mortgages cie and banks to let you start this transaction, they don't really care about your credit, they don't care about your income as long as you pay their monthly due on time.<br>  <br>  However It is a way better option than renting or leasing.<br>  <br>  This is a vast and complex subject and i tried to answer it with simples and short answers but you might want to check this  with your local realtor to help you find more suitable options.<br>  <br>  If you are in Florida, contact me I might be able to help you.|`|AA10923152	Well for leasing and renting the pro's are that you can kinda move anytime if you don't like the house and you don't have to pay for maintenance. As for rent-to-own, it depends on the person and contracts and what type of agreement you have. You can do one that makes u rent for 3 yrs or whatever before you can buy or after 3 yrs of renting it's a lower buying price. In that scenario you would have to deal with the landlord for the 3 yr period. The cons of renting and leasing is that you have nothing to show for the money you've spent at the end of your renting period. You can get slum lords that wont fix things and that will take your deposit by making up things that are wrong and those sorts of things.

Then take the best one but make sure you have a contract so they can't change the price on you.|`|AA10923152	well some deals can be made with suppliers based on projected sales for a year. A lot of suppliers will cut new business a deal and see what they will do. Most deals will run for a year or 2 but then if you're numbers still aren't cutting it they will re-evaluate your discount with them. Be agressive and try to get the best discount possible because it will make a huge difference when it comes to being competitive. And let them know that too. If you get a discount of 20% off retail but yet your competitor is getting 30% he can cut your profits right out if it becomes a bidding situation or if someone goes back and forth to get the best price. So your best chance of being competitive in the market is to start with the same discount or close to that of your competitors.
AA10923152	Well the marketing is kind of obvious. They have to market to consumers about the airline. Even though everyone knows like United or AA it's still necessary for them to keep their name out there in front of people. Everyone knows McDonald's but yet they still spend at least $1million in advertising every year. The marketing works on buying advertising in markets all over the US and even globally as well as putting out their own flyers and publications and buy space in news prints and magazines. The goal of marketing is to make thier airline number 1 in peoples minds when they think of flying. Sales i'm not as sure on. I'm sure most of the sales are counter or online but the sales reps might be in more contact with travel agencies trying to get them to book more on their flights

What is taking place is fascinating and often unexpected (See 'Relevant Current and Associated Works').<br>  <br>  The main report 'Co-operatives: Causes of Failure, Guidelines for Success' is based on these studies. Its conclusions and recommendations are entirely relevant and cover fundamental and practical problems of co-ops and mutual societies, of members, of direction, management and control (See 'Relevant Current and Associated Works').<br>  <br>  !|`|AA10923152	Can't Remember SH*T

Cuando las sociedades más opulentas de la Humanidad llegan a un grado elevado de acumulado material, es decir, de riquezas, se inicia un proceso de decadencia debido al peso mismo de ese acumulado. Pero ese acumulado no es siempre el resultado de su propio desarrollo económico sino de procesos de avasallamiento, conquistas y saqueos a otros pueblos, pueblos que, por su debilidad, han perdido gran parte de su acumulado a manos del poderoso que los invadió, les robó sus riquezas y los puso bajo su dominio militar para sostener lo económicamente obtenido mediante la violencia.........<br>  La Historia de la Humanidad ha sido ese trajinar en su proceso evolutivo de miles de a?os en los que ha conocido innumerables acontecimientos de todo orden: desde lo más execrable del ser humano hasta lo más sublime del mismo; porque en la Historia del ser humano la diversidad de sus manifestaciones es infinita; y lo mejor de ese ser está aún por venir, sin embargo de lo cual ya se ha dado como una anticipación de su condición de tal.<br>  Los Estados Unidos de Norteamérica, como otros imperios que hemos conocido en la Historia, ha logrado un nivel de desarrollo no solo por sí mismo, como país y sociedad, sino por lo que a otros pueblos ha arrebatado en su ya larga historia de intervenciones y guerras colonialistas; además, a esa nación han llegado millones de personas de todas las condiciones humanas y han aportado a su desarrollo, en forma importante, sin que ello sea notoriamente destacado. Sin embargo, la casta dominante en esta nación es la que se apropia y usufructúa ese acumulado y con él prosigue ese proceso de enriquecimiento a costa de otros pueblos como actualmente lo hace con los países árabes y en particular con Iraq, pero todo cae por su propìo peso y este país no está exento de la Ley de Causa y Efecto la que se ve venir.<br>  Lamento mucho por mis amigos que viven en este gran país y también por los norteamericanos inocentes que son muchos, pero esto es parte de esas profesías y ojalá todo cambie para bien de todos|`|SDHvDNGJaa	Que mas da,  con que los Bush se hallan llenado de petróleo jugando a la guerra y destruyendo ciudades históricas, el mundo no hace nada, nada, nada...

Think about how bad you need this job to take care of you and the baby and just relax a little.  When you feel like youre going to say something crazy, just step outside of yourself and remember that you want to stop being crabby.  If you slip up and say something crazy, just stop talking, change the subject, or pretend you were just joking.

Good luck.|`|be1cae5db2f57740061ac3e82e7f4e5eaa	Is staying at your current job your only option due to your pregnancy?  I'd make sure to keep the negative talk to a minimum.  It could be used against you.  Since you're pregnant, you want to be able to keep your income and your sanity.  Too much stress will not be good for the baby!  <br>  <br>  A few months ago, I left a very stressful job that I hated.  I don't regret my decision, but now I'm in a situation that can have it's ups and downs.  I took a pay cut and have fewer benefits, but my stress level is down.  Nothing's perfect.<br>  <br>  If the job is too hard for you maybe you need extra training or some other way to make things easier.  Is it just that the workload is heavy?  Or are there things you don't understand(or haven't been explained to you properly...that's a common problem).  Ask for help if you need it.  <br>  <br>  Bitching about coworkers can be fun, but it's hardly productive.  Just don't put yourself in a position where you could be disciplined for what you're saying or seriously make someone angry with you.  Enemies at work are not fun.  It's hard enough to do a full time job without having to worry about office politics.<br>  <br>  Good luck...maybe start looking for another job?

I think after awhile the past negative talk, will go to the back of their minds.  <br>  If you work there for a long time, possibly the negative things you have talked about might be forgotten.  It really depends on the type of people you work with.  <br>  Also remember co-workers can suck you into a conversation...for what reason?  <br>  It could be to see how loyal you are?  It could be to feel you out about a position that might be opening?   There can NEVER be a good reason for LISTENING to others speak negatives either.  <br>  Talking bad about others can really look bad for you.  <br>  Besides when you realize what you have done, in talking bad about someone...your heart hurts.   <br>  Also keep in mind, when you talk about someone else, many times you don't know the whole situation.   <br>  So unless you have walked a mile in someone else's shoes...please try as hard as you can not to be unkind in front of or behind the person's face. <br>  Be patient about your job.   You might be surprised at a wonderful opportunity that will come knocking....just be patient. <br>  Good things come to those who wait. <br>  "Never let anyone come to you without coming away better and happier.  Everyone should see goodness in your face, in your eyes in your smile."  I think that's by Mother Teresa.<br>  If you do happen to slip and talk negatively, just forgive yourself & if the situation warrants, apologize to the person you said it to.  <br>  The best way to replace a bad habit, is to REPLACE it with a good one !!!  <br>  Good luck !!!
c5650156c96d9280bb32f1aa20fe3890aa	Blatant Honesty and A Smile, confidence. They will ask things like, why do you want to work here? Etc. For younger people once you have an interview just tell them you are available all the time and you pretty much have the job.<br>  <br>  An example of multi - tasking? Have you ever done 2 things at once? Watched kids and done homework at the same time?|`|28144eb29fc234a2e2c879b5109675a4aa	If  you have done 2 things at one time, that is multi-tasking. <br>  The word may be overwhelming.  I bet you have multi-tasked  many times and didn't even know it. <br>  Have you cooked more than one item at one time?  Have you ever answered the phone while continuing to do something else? Talked on the phone, while being on the computer?  <br>  That's all multi-tasking.  <br>  <br>  Just be  yourself.  Honestly answer any questions and<br>  have questions of your own to ask the interviewer.  After all you will be taking time out of your life to work for them.  You have the right to ask questions also.   Like the hours, what's expected of you,  benefits...that sort of thing.   Asking a few questions also shows you can think for yourself.  Which will be expected in the job you are interviewing for.  <br>  Be kind, courteous and respectful.  But not too much over the top.  <br>  Go in with an attitude of "I know I can do this"  "I can learn anything"  "I love being around people"  <br>  Before and as you are going to the interview, give yourself positive thoughts.  <br>  They will expect you to be a little nervous.  That's normal. <br>  If you weren't a little nervous, they might not think you were serious about the job interview.    If you were too relaxed, they might think you would be that way with your job.  That maybe you wouldn't take your job seriously.  <br>  Go in prepared...take a resume if they asked for it, dress FOR the interview etc.   All of this tells them you are organized and want the job.  Being organized is something you will also need in the job.  Show them that you are by having everything you need, when you go to the interview. <br>  Hope this helps !!!  GOOD LUCK !!! You'll do fine !!!|`|AA12037799	Places like Starbucks want people that are confident, do not tell him your nervous, he'll know anyways.  Make sure you maintain eye contact and SMILE>

fad51c51188b6f48156d0c00cd838d8caa	Very good question, but I am afraid no simple answer. First of all it depends on how much money you want to send and secondly what kind of bank account you have, otherwise you will waste lot of money on exchange rates and commissions.<br>  <br>  1. try Western Union, they will send up to 1 lac Rupees charging you ￡9.99,c heck their site for most recent update<br>  <br>  2, I am afraid gone are the days of money laundering, where you could go to local agent and he will send money to India with minimum hassle.<br>  <br>  3. I have an overseas NRI account with Bank of Punjab, I remit money whenever I am going to India through my HSBC Branch in London and it takes 2 days and I pay no commission, but you can open this NRI/NRE account in India or with ICICI on line.<br>  Otherwise if it is less than ￡ 2000, I will just take it as cash|`|AA11604736	that will depend on the time period for which u r coming back to india. if u r just coming for a vacation and going back in sometime, then get travellers cheques, or u can get a few pounds and then get them converted on the day  u think u'll get the best exchange rate.<br>  <br>  if u r coming back for good, then u can just convert all the money in a bank draft, and deposit it in ur account here. only, it will be converted on the particular day's exchange rate, as rupees.
