Last night, Gordon Brown turned to the Queen and said:   "As I'm the Prime Minister, I'm thinking of changing how my great country is referred to, and I'm thinking that it should be a Kingdom."   The Queen replied, "I'm sorry Mr. Brown, but to be a Kingdom, you have to have a King in charge - and you're not a King.   "Gordon Brown thought a while and then said: "How about a Principality then?"    To which the Queen replied, "Again, to be a Principality you have to be a Prince - and you're not a Prince, Mr. Brown."   Brown thought long and hard and came up with "How about an Empire then?"   The Queen, getting a little annoyed by now, replied : "Sorry again, Mr. Brown,but to be an Empire you must have an Emperor in charge and you are not an Emperor."Before Brown could utter another word,         The Queen said: "I think you're doing quite nicely as a Country."

It was between 1993-1998.   All I can remember is part of the chorus;       "I just shot a man, I'm going to Disneyland."      I have attempted to look up bands from that time period on several sites, including Rolling Stone Magazine, and nothing comes up.      Any help would be appreciated. Thanks!

20090205090931AAyAXJ0	Entertainment & Music;Jokes & Riddles	Are all Banks the same?	A lady died this past January, and HSBC bank billed her for February and March for their annual service charges on her credit card, and   then added late fees and interest on the monthly charge the balance had been ￡0.00, now is somewhere around ￡60.00.        A family member placed a call to the HSBC Bank:        Family Member:     'I am calling to tell you that she died in January.'        HSBC:     'The account was never closed and the late fees and charges still apply.'        Family Member:     'Maybe, you should turn it over to collections.'        HSBC:    'Since it is two months past due, it already has been.'        Family Member:    'So, what will they do when they find out she is dead?'        HSBC:    'Either report her account to the frauds division or report her to the credit bureau, maybe both!'        Family Member:    'Do you think God will be mad at her?'        HSBC:    'Excuse me?'        Family Member:    'Did you just get what I was telling you . . . The part about her being dead?'        HSBC:     'Sir, you'll have to speak to my supervisor.'        Supervisor gets on the phone:                  Family Member:    'I'm calling to tell you, she died in January.'        HSBC:    'The account was never closed and the late fees and charges still apply.'        Family Member:    'You mean you want to collect from her estate?'        HSBC:    (Stammer) 'Are you her lawyer?'        Family Member:    'No, I'm her great nephew.'     (Lawyer info given)        HSBC:    'Could you fax us a certificate of death?'        Family Member:    'Sure.'    ( fax number is given )        After they get the fax:        HSBC:    'Our system just isn't set up for death. I don't know what more I can do to help.'        Family Member:    'Well, if you figure it out, great! If not, you could just keep billing  her. I don't think she will care.'        HSBC:    'Well, the late fees and charges do still apply.'        Family Member:    'Would you like her new billing address?'        HSBC:    'That might help.'        Family Member:    ' Rookwood Municipal Cemetery , 124 Centenary Rd, Basingstoke. Plot Number 1049.'        HSBC:    'Sir, that's a cemetery!'        Family Member:    'Well, what the **** do you do with dead people on your planet?'
20090205092114AA1v782	Entertainment & Music;Jokes & Riddles	Now!hear's an Oldie but Goodie, do you like it?	A refuse collector is going along a   street picking up the wheelie bins and emptying them into his dustcart. He goes   to one house where the bin hasn't been left out, so he has a quick look for it, goes round the back of the house, but still can't see it. So, against the rules of the refuse collector's code but in the spirit of kindness, he knocks on the door.         There's no answer.      Being a kindly and conscientious bloke, he knocks again - much harder.      Eventually a Japanese bloke comes to the door.              'Harro!' says the Japanese chappie.      'Gidday, mate! Where's ya bin?' asks the collector      'I bin on toiret' explains the Japanese bloke, a bit perplexed.      Realising the little foreign fellow had misunderstood him, the   bin man smiles and tries again.      'No mate, where's your dust bin?'.      'I dust been to toiret, I toll you!'' says the Japanese man -   still perplexed.      'Listen,' says the collector.      'You're misunderstanding me. Where's your wheelie bin?'              'Ok. Ok 'replies the Japanese man with a sheepish grin.              ' I wheelie bin havin sex wirra wife's sister.........!'

A man was sitting in the bar at Heathrow and noticed a really beautiful woman sitting next to him.He thought to himself.    'Wow, she's so gorgeous she must be an air hostess. I wonder which airline she works for.'  Hoping to find out, he leaned towards her and uttered the Delta Airline slogan. 'Love to fly and it shows?'  She gave him a blank, confused stare and he thought to himself. 'Well, she obviously doesn't work ! for Delta.'    A moment later, another slogan popped into his head. So he leaned towards her again and said, 'Something special in the air?'  She gave him the same confused look. He mentally scratched Singapore Airlines off his list.  He thought 'Perhaps she works for Thai Airways...'and said 'Smooth as silk?'  This time, the woman turned on him and said, 'What the f**k do you want?'    The man smiled, slumped back in his chair and said. 'Ahhhhh, Ryanair!'

20090205091549AAo2QOJ	Entertainment & Music;Music;Rock and Pop	Buying Tickets on Ticketmaster.com, flipping them to StubHub.com for Profit?	Basically what I have learned that people, in more recent instances such as the Bruce Springsteen Tour, are buying tickets at face value on ticketmaster.com and selling them after they sell out on websites like stubhub.com for a higher price.  Now I for one am completely against this because Bruce Springsteen tickets went on sale this past Monday morning and they were all sold out at 1130 am or so.  Because of the alleged activity, I will be forced to pay 300 to 400 for decent seats at Mellon arena in Pittsburgh.  Now obviously I don't know how many people just bought the tickets for resale, but I have to wonder.     Yahoo just posted this article today...       http://new.music.yahoo.com/blogs/stopthe...       It explains Bruce's Outrage and potential lawsuit.      My question is should something be done to prevent this sort of behavior?  Will Ticketmaster increase prices? Or may be they won't provide the ticket until a few days to a week or so before a concert making room for only serious buyers and not people looking for a quick profit.      Let me know what you think..      thanks       Frank

I have tried both the built-in microphone and I tried plugging in my own microphone into the 1/8" audio input. In all of these instances, whenever I play it back the sound wavers in and out.      I have an HP G60-120US notebook with Windows Vista 32-bit OS, 3GB RAM, and an AMD Turion Dual-Core RM-70 2GHz processor.

I just sort of play along with it because I don't want to hurt her feelings or anything but Its honestly getting to the point where it's downright annoying and awkward.

20090205040825AAIwdqD	Entertainment & Music;Polls & Surveys	How would you feel if historians wrote about you after you died like they do about George Washington?	It seems like historians are always poking around and reading people's letters and diaries and things like that and then writing all about their personal life.  Not people like you and me but major historical figures.  If I were to become president one day (I know that's not going to happen but anyway) I don't want them reading my texts and instant messages and emails and stuff ... because it's not all flowery and beautiful, I would sound like a sex obsessed jerk who swears a lot ... I know this happens after people die usually, but I still would like to be remembered well.

20090204221707AAd41Ux	Entertainment & Music;Polls & Surveys	Can I get your opinion on this?	Why don't people read comics? I asked earlier but I asked in the wrong place, comics & animation where they do read them. People run to the theaters to watch the superhero movies, tuned in to watch the first season of Heroes. Super heroes have always been a big part of American pop culture. I know people who love movies like A History of Violence, Ghost World, American Splendor, and Road To Perdition but think comics are immature, they're based on comics.      Also horror films and novels have borrowed from comics alot, just ask Stephen King and George A. Romero.

I leave the pharmacy and I'm driving back and he's not on his corner anymore so I think "oh well" and keep driving, then I see this scuzzy man in a denim jacket, pull over, and hand him a ten. He looks at me weird and says "thank you sweetie" and I roll away feeling pretty darn good about myself.      Then I turn the next corner and lo and behold, there's the homeless man with the sign..

The 1st golfer gets up and drives the ball right into the water. He walks toward the ball and when he gets to the water hazard the water parts in front of him. He walks up to the ball and pitches it right onto the green.   The 2nd golfer does the exact same thing, except the ball stays on top of the water. He walks on water right up to the ball, and pitches it right onto the green.   The 3rd golfer also hits the ball into the water, but this time a fish jumps up and grabs the ball in its mouth. Then an eagel flies down grabbing the fish (that still has the ball in its mouth) and proceedes to fly away.  When the eagle is flying over the green, a bolt of lightning strikes the eagle, which drops the fish. The fish lands right next to the hole, opens its mouth, and the ball rolls into the hole. Hole in one.   Then Moses looks at Jesus and says,"I hate playing golf with your dad."

20081016043140AAkRRJX	Entertainment & Music;Jokes & Riddles	Do you know that (need stars pls)?	The largest cell in the human body is the female egg and the smallest is the male sperm.      It takes the food seven seconds to get from your mouth to your stomach.       One human hair can support 3 kg (6 lb).      The average man's penis is three times the length of his thumb.      Human thighbones are stronger than concrete.      A woman's heart beats faster than a man's.      There are about one trillion bacteria on each of your feet.      Women blink twice as often as men.      The average person's skin weighs twice as much as the brain.      Your body uses 300 muscles to balance itself when you are standing still.      If saliva cannot dissolve something, you cannot taste it.      Men who read this are probably still busy checking their thumbs!!   loolll

Pur avendo finito i miei limiti risposte per oggi ( e quindi non posso ricambiare e mettere le stelline agli altri, ma lo faccio domani), posso ancora fare una domanda.      Queste sono toste. Se riuscirete, siete proprio bravi ,a soprattutto avete acume:      1) Di quanti chili aumenterebbe il peso della terra se, attorno all'equatore, lungo 40.000 km, fosse costruito un muro massiccio, alto 6 metri e largo 3 metri? Il calcolo deve venir compiuto in base al peso di 3 tonnellate per metro cubo di muto. NON sarà necessario. considerare il fatto che una gran parte del muro corre nel mare.      2) Quando la guardia forestale andò nel bosco, le si fecero incontro 7 vecchine, ciascune delle uali portava 7 gabbie contenenti 7 fringuelli. Ogni fringuello aveva 7 piccoli. Quante vecchine, quante gabbie, quanti fringuelli e quanti piccoli andarono nella foresta?      Attenti al trabocchetto!  Perchè ci sta!

I'm conducting a survey on patient satisfaction on the NHS. I'll be grateful for all answers to the question no matter how short; user providing most in depth answers will get the points. Feel free to add anything extra you have to say about the NHS, I will include all in my analysis. The minimum I need to get from internet users is 10 participants. Here are the questions:   Age? Sex? What are important attributes in a doctor/nurse? Do you see any health professionals other than a doctor, if so how often? (e.g. pharmacist, optician etc.) What is it that makes a good experience of health care? Do you feel that your doctor takes your ideas and concerns into account and includes you in the decision making progress? Give the current state of the NHS a mark out of 10: 10 being fantastic, 1 dismal.      THANKS IN ADVANCE!!!! :)
20090205094348AAg9p1u	Entertainment & Music;Horoscopes	Why does Sagittarius always question the relationship they're in even though it's going great?	I'm a sagittarius female, and it always seems that when I ever fall into a relationship I second guess everything! In the courting and dating stages I am completely alright. When I first met my boyfriend, I felt completely comfortable with wanting a commitment with him, and I wanted to have deep feelings for him.       Now, after the commitment has been made, I feel so unsure of things. I wonder if we're going too fast, I worry about our pasts, or if we're right for each other; maybe the grass is greener somewhere else? Then I realized, it's completely characteristic of how I've been in relationships previous to this one. I feel so much closer to this man, and I feel like we're great together, yet, nothing's changed lol.      I'm curious to see what you guys think. Oh yeah, he's a Leo if anyone is wondering...

20090205045554AAihpWx	Entertainment & Music;Polls & Surveys	Do you know how wonderous Banana is?	This is interesting.   After reading this, you'll never look at a banana in the same way again.      Bananas contain three natural sugars - sucrose, fructose and glucose combined with fiber. A banana gives an instant, sustained and substantial boost of energy      Research has proven that just two bananas provide enough energy for a strenuous 90-minute workout No wonder the banana is the number one fruit with the world's leading athletes.      But energy isn't the only way a banana can help us keep fit. It can also help overcome or prevent a substantial number of illnesses and conditions, making it a must to add to our daily diet.      DEPRESSION: According to a recent survey undertaken by MIND amongst people suffering from depression, many felt much better after eating a banana. This is because bananas contain tryptophan, a type of protein that the body converts into serotonin, known to make you relax, improve your mood and generally make you feel happier.      PMS: Forget the pills - eat a banana. The vitamin B6 it contains regulates blood glucose levels, which can affect your mood.      ANEMIA: High in iron, bananas can stimulate the production of hemoglobin in the blood and so helps in cases of anemia.      BLOOD PRESSURE: This unique tropical fruit is extremely high in potassium yet low in salt, making it perfect to beat blood pressure. So much so, the US Food and Drug Administration has just allowed the banana industry to make official claims for the fruit's ability to reduce the risk of blood pressure and stroke.      BRAIN POWER: 200 students at a Twickenham (Middlesex) school ( England ) were helped through their exams this year by eating bananas at breakfast, break, and lunch in a bid to boost their brain power.. Research has shown that the potassium-packed fruit can assist learning by making pupils more alert.      CONSTIPATION: High in fiber, including bananas in the diet can help restore normal bowel action, helping to overcome the problem without resorting to laxatives.      HANGOVERS: One of the quickest ways of curing a hangover is to make a banana milkshake, sweetened with honey. The banana calms the stomach and, with the help of the honey, builds up depleted blood sugar levels, while the milk soothes and re-hydrates your system.      HEARTBURN: Bananas have a natural antacid effect in the body, so if you suffer from heartburn, try eating a banana for soothing relief.      MORNING SICKNESS: Snacking on bananas between meals helps to keep blood sugar levels up and avoid morning sickness.      MOSQUITO BITE: Before reaching for the insect bite cream, try rubbing the affected area with the inside of a banana skin. Many people find it amazingly successful at reducing swelling and irritation.      NERVES: Bananas are high in B vitamins that help calm the nervous system.      Overweight and at work? Studies at the Institute of Psychology in Austria found pressure at work leads to gorging on comfort food like chocolate and chips. Looking at 5,000 hospital patients, researchers found the most obese were more likely to be in high-pressure jobs. The report concluded that, to avoid panic-induced food cravings, we need to control our blood sugar levels by snacking on high carbohydrate foods every two hours to keep levels steady.      ULCERS: The banana is used as the dietary food against intestinal disorders because of its soft texture and smoothness. It is the only raw fruit that can be eaten without distress in over-chronicler cases. It also neutralizes over-acidity and reduces irritation by coating the lining of the stomach.      TEMPERATURE CONTROL: Many other cultures see bananas as a 'cooling' fruit that can lower both the physical and emotional temperature of expectant mothers. In Thailand , for example, pregnant women eat bananas to ensure their baby is born with a cool temperature.      SEASONAL AFFECTIVE DISORDER (SAD): Bananas can help SAD sufferers because they contain the natural mood enhancer tryptophan.      SMOKING AND TOBACCO USE: Bananas can also help people trying to give up smoking. The B6, B12 they contain, as well as the potassium and magnesium found in them, help the body recover from the effects of nicotine withdrawal.      STRESS: Potassium is a vital mineral, which helps normalize the heartbeat, sends oxygen to the brain and regulates your body's water balance. When we are stressed, our metabolic rate rises, thereby reducing our potassium levels. These can be rebalanced with the help of a high-potassium banana snack.      STROKES: According to research in The New England Journal of Medicine, eating bananas as part of a regular diet can cut the risk of death by strokes by as much as 40%!      WARTS: Those keen on natural alternatives swear that if you want to kill off a wart, take a piece of banana skin and place it on the wart, with the yellow side out. Carefully hold the skin in place with a plaster or surgical tape!      So, a banana really is a natural remedy for many ills. When you compare it to an apple, it has four

20090205101817AA1UxYX	Entertainment & Music;Movies	I just saw the Wrestler. What did you think?	I thought it was a pretty good movie. It gave a unique inside look at what really goes on in the world of professional wrestling. I didn't really like how he was able to just walk right back in his daughters life with ease and then she suddenly shuns him forever a couple days later. But I guess there's a whole background story that the movie doesn't touch on (What happened to the mother, how many times has the Randy done this before.... ect). I thought the ending could have been a little better, but I guess it's just human nature to want a happy ending and closure. I think the whole point of this movie was to show that Randy was just a F*** up that really only knew how to do one thing; Wrestle. I think you can relate this to a lot of people in all aspects of life. What did you think???

It somehow strikes me as strange to realize that the punk generation is reaching that age. I admit that I had a strange thought when Joey Ramone died a month before his 50th birthday that it would have been strange to have Joey in his 50's. I'm not saying that it would be better if they all died young, I'm just asking if it makes anyone else feel old that they can join AARP.

20090205101048AAu6XuA	Entertainment & Music;Music;Rock and Pop	Got a favorite live radio interview/performance? (free to download show of the week)?	This is week 8 of the Wire and String show of the week, if you missed the first few, there are links on my profile. I am going to try to post one free to download show a week, ideally from a different band every week. I am going to aim for Thursdays. I hope to include various genres and try to get shows of good sound quality (but might make the occasional exception for a classic show).      This weeks show:   Toubab Krewe December 22, 2006       http://www.archive.org/details/toubab200...       They blend blues rock with west african music, playing partly on traditional west african instruments.       This one is the second radio show I have posted, the first being Beirut. I think radio interviews with live performance can be such a great way to get introduced to a band. You hear them talk and get to know what they are all about, you hear them play and find of if they can actually play live, and generally the recordings are very clean and well mixed.      MQ: Name a band that you either discovered from a radio interview/performance or gained a lot of respect for from a radio interview/performance (bonus if you can give a link to that broadcast so the rest of us can hear)      MQ2: How do you like the show?

The other night I was invited out for a night with the 'girls.'       I told my husband that I would be home by midnight, 'I promise!'       Well, the hours passed and the white wines went down way too easily.       Around 3 a.m., a bit loaded, I headed for home.          Just as I got in the door, the cuckoo clock in the hallway started up and cuckooed 3 times.          Quickly, realizing my husband would probably wake up, I cuckooed another 9 times.       I was really proud of myself for coming up with such a quick-witted solution, in order to escape a possible conflict with him.             (Even when totally smashed... 3 cuckoos plus 9 cuckoos     totals = 12 cuckoos = MIDNIGHT!)       The next morning my husband asked me what time I got in, I told him 'MIDNIGHT'... he didn't seem pissed off in the least.       Phew, just thinking I had got away with that one, he then said 'We need a new cuckoo clock.'      When I asked him why, he said,    'Well, last night our clock cuckooed three times, then said 'oh ****', cuckooed 4 more times,    cleared its throat, cuckooed another three times, giggled,    cuckooed twice more, and then tripped over the coffee table and farted.

20090205112929AASCrK0	Entertainment & Music;Jokes & Riddles	Twilight Riddle: Question # 72?	I am completely stuck on Question # 72 on the Twilight Riddle. At first I thought well cell phone and the clue thing at the top is a reference to a quote said by Jacob when h was talking about vampires "leeches" so I tried that and it did not work. Then I tried typing in Embry Call because of his last name and all but that isn't right, either. And then I asked what T9 was and my friend Rachel told me so I went back to clues in the Forum and they talked about T9 and what came before it which was "normal alpha" and an Alpha is the pack leader with the Indians so I tried that and guess what!? It did not work! Please, help! I have spent the past three hours on this one and I still do not have it figured out yet:   (A picture of a cell phone)   7|1 2|1 2|3 4|3 3|3 4|3 2|3 6|2 6|3 7|3 8|1 4|2 9|1 3|2 7|4 8|1 8|1 7|3 8|2 7|4 8|1.

20090205104552AAcXf7W	Entertainment & Music;Jokes & Riddles	This joke is a bit rude. Read if you dare?	Two women friends had gone for a girl's night out.    Both were very faithful and loving wives, however    They had gotten over-enthusiastic on the Bacardi    Breezers.    Incredibly drunk and walking home they needed to    Pee, so they stopped in the cemetery.    One of them had nothing to wipe with so she thought    She would take off her panties and use them.    Her friend however was wearing a rather expensive    Pair of panties and did not want to ruin them.    She was lucky enough to squat down next to a grave    That had a wreath with a ribbon on it, so she    Proceeded to wipe with that.    After the girls did their business they proceeded to    Go home.    The next day one of the woman's husband was concerned    That his normally sweet and innocent wife was still in bed hung over,  so he phoned the other husband and said:    'These girl nights have got to stop! I'm starting to suspect the worst.     My wife came home with no panties!!'    'That's nothing' said the other husband,    'Mine came back with a card stuck to her bum that    Said..    'From all of us at the Fire Station.    We'll never forget you.''

20090205102112AAC76mw	Entertainment & Music;Television;Comedy	What is the name of this cartoon ?	There's this show I used to watch in the 90's.    It was a show about some typical kids group in a school, and they had some sort of magic thing by which they could change the environment of the school, or the school was magic or something.    Then for example the theme of the episode would be jungle and all the lockers would be hanged with vines and there would be tree's and bushes in all the hallways.    Or the theme would be old egypt and the school would turn into a pyramid with traps and everything.    Or the theme would be sea, and the hallways would be filled with water and sea animals.    Then at the end of the episode the school would always turn back to normal and they would return to the classes.       That's everything I remember about it. I believe that it was educational in the same way the magic school bus was, it was in that same era I believe. But it definitely was another show than the magic school bus! Well.... Does this sound familiar to anyone ? Can anyone help me ?

20090202200449AAJCsOl	Entertainment & Music;Television;Reality Television	Ideas for my reality show skit?	In drama, we're doing reality show plays. My group decided that we're going to do a Wipeout-based play. There will be two hosts-me and this other girl-and two pairs of guys. We already decided that one group wil have absolutely no idea whats going on, and the other team does everything fairly.    One thing we're doing is an obstacle course (just a line of chairs that you jump over). One group jumps over it, and the other group just looks at it and goes around to the finish line.    So if you could give me any funny ideas to use in it. Other challenges, or things to say would be great. Maybe even a surprise ending!

A man absolutely hated his wife's cat and decided to get rid of him one day by driving him 20 blocks from his home and leaving him at the park.    As he was getting home, the cat was walking up the driveway.    The next day he decided to drive the cat 40 blocks away. He put the beast out and headed home.    Driving back up his driveway, there was the cat!    He kept taking the cat further and further and the cat would always beat him home. At last he decided to drive a few miles away, turn right, then left, past the bridge, then right again and another right until he reached what he thought was a safe distance from his home and left the cat there.    Hours later the man calls home to his wife: "Jen, is the cat there?"    "Yes," the wife answers, "why do you ask?"    Frustrated, the man answered, "Put that son of a bi*ch on the phone, I'm lost and need directions!"

20090219121332AAP4pEg	Entertainment & Music;Movies	Please help me remember this movie...?	Two women, childhood  friends, reunite. One of them  is married. The other is a  succesful writer. When she  arrives at the other's home, she says something to upset the other, who was hiding outside to surprise her friend, and begins to cry. The succesful one is greeted (at a college maybe) with much cheering. The married one is jealous. Eventually the married one reveals she has written a book. Then later she becomes a succesful writer, perhaps more so than the first, she writes trashy novels but the other writes intellectual books. There is some sort of love affair that results in the two fighting. There is also another girl involved, i think the charge of one of the friends. At the end of the movie the two friends are sitting on a couch and saying something like "we'll always be friends".      Jealousy is a theme in the movie.      I believe the movie was in black-and-white.
