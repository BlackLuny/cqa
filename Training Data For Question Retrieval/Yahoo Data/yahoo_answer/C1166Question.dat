I'll be headed off to college soon and after A LOT of saving I'll be buying an entirely new wardrobe. I hope to double major in theater/drama and accounting. I LOVE the bohemian look but when going over pictures and stores it seems like it may not be mature enough for a serious college student. I'm afraid of looking way too young, childish, and immature in college because I'm graduating high school at sixteen and I'll enter college at seventeen and I want to be taken seriousy. However, it seems that I might be able to get away with it being a drama major. WHAT DO YOU THINK?
20090310032235AAuYTS8	Beauty & Style;Skin & Body;Other - Skin & Body	>>>teenage acne help?	Ok so im 15, and i have somewhat bad acne. Of course its made me have low confidence. I've tried these products: Clinique(too pricy), Proactiv(too pricy in alaska), Clearasil, and currently im using Clean & Clear its not working very well. The other products didnt really help at all, except Proactiv it worked the first time I used it but its too expensive when shipped to alaska for some reason and then i used Clearasil and my face got worse, then went back to Proactiv and it didnt help at all. Clean & Clear isnt really helping either. I really want my face to clear up. People say drink lots of water and stay away from dairy products, but its not that easy, i like my dairy :) Can any recommend an acne cleanser that actually clears and smooths my skin, is inexpensive and can also clear/fade acne marks?   Thanks guys!

20090309135100AA2UDsH	Beauty & Style;Other - Beauty & Style	Does this sound like a good way to convince my parents to...?	get my bellybutton pierced? i'd like your honest opinions and i need to know if there's anything i should add. this is a letter i'm going to present them tonight.         Dear Mom & Dad,      We've had this conversation before, and your immediate answer was no. But I have been   thinking about this for quite a long time now. I have thought of the responsibilties, consequences, and what kind    of decision I'm making. I have done research   on this and I think we need to have a serious and mature talk before we decide anything. I want to get my bellybutton pierced.      Now in your mind, I know for SURE you're saying, "Oh god, never!" And I know all of the reasons why you think this.            1.You guys were raised during a time when tattoos and piercings were only seen on criminals and gang members. Apparently, these people got those piercings to act tough. I understand where you guys are coming from. You care about me and love me and you don’t want me to look like one of these trashy people with a million piercings on their bodies.      2.You think tattoos and piercings will interfere with my older adult life. You’ve said this to me before; you think when I go for job interviews or a very business-like place, people will see the piercing and think it’s inappropriate. But think about this – do I EVER wear belly shirts? The only time you would ever see my piercing is during the summer, when I’m wearing a bathing suit. But that’s it. Only 3 months out of the year and it’s not inappropriate during the summer.          Of course, I know your big question is…why do I want one?      As a growing teenager, a piercing to me, is like a new shirt or a new hairstyle. I want one because I think it’s a really cute accessory and it fits my personality. I can understand your reasoning for not letting me get this, but if you think about it, it’s my body. If I want a cute little gem on my stomach just for a pretty accessory, and not to attract random perverts, it’s my decision. I can understand if it was like a nose, eyebrow, or lip piercing, but it’s nothing like that. I can always hide it underneath my shirt, unlike a facial piercing. As I’m growing up, I think I should be able to make more of my decisions and able to express myself in the way I want. This is no rebellious piercing, it is just a cute accessory that I think would be really fun to add to my outfits in the summer. I can also switch it up as much as I want after the 8 weeks of healing, so I can get different belly rings, like hearts or stars. And, they won’t be inappropriate or dramatic. =)         *I know the responsibilities.*      1.I will take so much care of this piercing. I will clean it two times a day, as needed, and wait the 8 weeks it needs to heal.    2.I think this should be incentive- if all my grades are 85 or higher by the end of the year, [NOT including gym or health!] then you can allow me to get my bellybutton pierced.    3.The piercing is most likely $30-40. But, I’m going to save my money so that I can get the piercing done before this summer, and I will find a reliable place to get it done at.

I don't know if this will help, but if I dye most of it black, I'm going to get black extensions.

The problem is aren't their levels for spray tanning like level one and level two spray tanning? Should I get a level one since I'm pale or get a level 2 because I'm pale or would that make me look orange?
