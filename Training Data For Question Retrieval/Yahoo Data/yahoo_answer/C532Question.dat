20090222191918AApHGR7	Health;Women's Health	What is going on with me? This has never happened...?	What is going on with me? This has never happened...?   I am studying abroad and have not had sex since jan 3rd, however, it was unprotected. I got my period normal time the first month I was here. But it was short, usally 5-6 days, lasted only 3 and lighter. But still cramps and all, a normal feeling period. Well I have been waiting for my period and it is 8 days late...but i have been experiencing milky brown tinged discharge.. I don't understand..I have been regular 28 day cycle for the past 10 years, since I started my periods. Never late...never weird periods, and I am in a foreign country but have been through a lot more stress...I did think of pregnancy as a possible situation but that would make me 8 weeks pregnant, no symptoms, nothing...so..I highly doubt that..   So..does this sound familiar to anyone?? Any help or advice woudl be great.

For the past 2 months I've tracked everything I've been eating and how many calories are in it. Now that I cut out junk food and only eat good stuff like non-processed foods, whole wheats, plenty of fruits and even more veggies, I've found that I can eat filling things without getting too many calories. Not all days, but some, I find that I'm full just eating 800 cals a day... Is this necessarily bad? I'm not going hungry or anything, and I don't want to force myself to eat more just because it's the "recommended" amount.

20090222175952AAcaFkR	Health;Alternative Medicine	A few questions about e?	So, I have a few questions about E. I rolled for the first time last night, blew a little less then 1 pill (me and my buddy, both first time rolling, took off a little powder and made a small 'line' for our other friend who had no e or bud.) They were red armanis. Anyway, I felt the effects almost immediatley and it gradually went up. Definiteally the funnest drug I've ever done.    However, my 3rd friend dropped his and it took about an hour to kick in but when he got to his peak it was a lot more intense, and I think his high lasted longer. So should I drop it next time then? I'm planning on taking 2 next friday.      Also, from an FAQ I read it says: "When someone takes MDMA there is a period of time where he/she gradually comes up. The speed with which this process happens is affected by many variables, including method of ingestion, how the pill was pressed, the user's metabolism, and whether or not the user has eaten." So does that mean that I shouldn't eat before dropping them?      And also, if I piss when I'm rolling will it get the drug(s) out of my system and make me come down faster?

20090222173946AAkCxdD	Health;Diseases & Conditions;STDs	I am not sure if its Herpes or not... scared?	I had a blood test that came out negative 3 months ago for HSV, but for some reason I don't trust that they really checked (paranoia). Last week I noticed a blister inside my mouth parallel to my teeth. I talked to a nurse who said its probably Herpes, which got me really down. I have done nothing to cause anything since my blood test, even avoid people. The blister popped an hour after getting it (absolutely an accident, I did not even try anything), it did not hurt much at all, just a slight sting after the pop. Its been 10 days and no scabbing happened, I know that not all fever blisters scab, but they almost usually do, and there are tiny non painful blisters but smaller than the one i had, on the other side of my mouth that are always there. But about 9 days ago I accidentally splashed soda in my eye, and now I am scared I contracted herpes ocular, no real redness, or vision impairment, but my eyelid hurts like its been punched, after I took a shower yesterday. It does not hurt at all unless I clench my eyelid, but even if I clench, the pain so small it's almost nothing. What do you think?

My boobs are too big for my bra, but it's not like they're being squished or anything, just that my bra doesn't cover nearly enough of my boob. It ends JUST after my nipple, so I have to adjust my bra quite frequently, because if it moves the slightest bit, my nipple will be exposed (kind of. Exposed under my shirt... But it feels uncomfortable.) So it's not like they're too large going FORWARD, but SIDEWAYS... Y'know? And it's not the shape of the bra, either, because it used to fit. :p So do I upgrade to a 36B or a 34C? Or perhaps even a 36C?

20090222175955AAeMFl8	Health;Mental Health	I could use some help...depressing/hard times?	Okay, I know this is VERY long, but I REALLY need the help: Everything goes wrong ALL the time. It's seriously annoying. Right when my life is good, PLUMP, something bad happens. I can't go a week without something bad happening. Today, I needed a USB cable for my camera, but of COURSE the cable wasn't the right one. Earlier I had to go to a university library to get books, but OF COURSE my mom can't drive (never learned) so I had no way of getting there, and then I find out the library isn't open on weekends (when I COULD go). I always mess up some way. And, when I have a week off, it always goes by FAST. It's like God wants me to be miserable. Also, I feel like I can't do anything and that's probably how God wanted it to be (can't swim, can't ride a bike, can't even tie my shoes and I feel like I'm good for nothing). In addition, I'm always so lonely cuz of course, on top of all these other problems, God had to make me super shy. I only have two friends that both have special needs. School's always a drag, depressing. I'm anti-social. Also, I feel dumb because I was the only person in the class who didn't finish a lab for science and got a 0 on it. Additionally, when my history class went to go check out books at the beginning of the year, I forgot my ID card so I couldn't get a book. I tried to go get a book and they didn't have any left so they gave me the book in CD-Rom form. But my teacher marks off points occasionally if we don't have our books, so of course that's points down the drain because of the stupid library. It's like never open anymore. But what has me really ticked is my friend. He always expects me to do everything for him cuz he's lazy. Well, his family takes me to school everyday and he keeps asking if we can cancel them giving me rides. I have no other f-ing way to get to school, and I tried to tell him that. He has special needs and he probably can't understand and I don't wanna be mean to him. He keeps asking me if my other friend can take me to school, but she already said she couldn't. And he keeps repeating himself all the time. I know he can't help it, but it gets annoying. Also, my uncle works at the school we go to, so my friend wanted me to go with him, too. However, he's a teacher so he has to be up there early and I can't get up early enough for him to take me. I feel like God is striking down all the happy in my life. In 2006, my father passed away and I had so much fun with him (I rarely ever have any fun anymore). So now most of the time I sit on the computer alone in my room. =( I have suicide thoughts, and I know one day I'm going to commit suicide (I just know it, life isn't going well at all). That's all I'm saying. So, can you please help? Give some advice or something? I know most of you probably won't bother to read such long detail, but I really could use help! I'm 15 in high school (sophomore).

So about a month ago my acne was going away and leaving scars, didnt matter if i popped the pimple or not.   I have seen the doctor and he gave me bio oil to make them go away (in 3 months) but nothing to prevent scarring.   So here are my questions:      How come scarring is happening?   Could it be something in the products im using. (Tereseptic mainly)   If so what are these ingredients that could be causing scarring?   What could i do when i wake up to make them not as noticeable?(like when i shower you can see them way worse)      Please help me!   Thanks

I just went to a "Free Pap Smear" day at my local cancer clinic and, ofcourse, got myself a free Pap Smear, for fun. Lo and behold, I get my results and I am faced with this:      Low-grade sqamous intraepithelial lesion (LSIL) encompassing: human papilloma virus (HPV) / mild dysplasia / CIN1.      WHAT THE HELL DOES ALL THIS MEAN? Initially, when I saw the ENTIRE thing, I was like, "damn, i have like 4 STD's (AAAHHHH)!" but after doing a little research, I find out that I just have one? Idk, I just know, I'm confused and scared that I'm gonna die! SOON! I mean, when I read LESIONS, I'm thinking open wounds on my insides, and HPV, I automatically thought of me getting cervical cancer.      I did learn a couple good things about this, that it could clear up on its own. I'm a pretty healthy person and hopes this is so. But will the HPV clear up or will the LSIL clear up or what... IDK! I just need someones help! I'm not scheduled to go to the gyno for another 2 - 3 months, I feel like, I'll be dead and gone from this virus by then.      I just need help, and some encouraging words... this is so embarrassing, but I know if i don't talk about it, I wont know about it.

Ok, last year me and my buddies were having a camp fire and it was on the beach.  we love to play with fire so before this camp fire ( the previous camp fire)  we braught rubbing alchahol and spit it onto a burning stick and BOOM thers a burst of fire, man that was fun.       so back at the previous camp fire, a buddy said try brining ammonia next time, i didnt think it was a good idea, so i just braught one bottle.      we tried pooring just a little bit onto the fire and it acted like water lightly putting it out.  so we didnt use that and just had a good fire.      that night i used the ammonia to put out the fire, and leaned over the fire and pored it onto it, getting tons of the fumes into my lungs,  i immidialtly  jumped back and started coughing, i didnt know it was that strong.  and now a year later i feel light effects from it.         What did it do?

I've been drinking water and some vitamin tea and my mom is at the store getting more stuff, including some vegetables that she uses for juicing (carrots, apples, roots-sounds gross but it's extremely healthy and it helps so much due to the high vitamin content) also a powder drink mix called emergen-c (high in vitamin c which also helps)      I also had a really bad nosebleed yesterday that took about an hour to stop so now I can't take aspirin since it's a blood thinner.

20090222185149AAo2Eub	Health;Diseases & Conditions;Other - Diseases	I need serious help, immediately (answers may save my life)?	Hayy..im a 16 year old girl who started her period when she was 14. I've been on my period for nearly four weeks and nothing seems to be working. I don't know if my problem is hereditary but it may be because my mother didn't start hers until she was 16. Although I am a virgin, the doctor put me on oral contraceptives to try to regulate my period but they didn't help. The doctors are taking their sweet time with helping me and my parents are losing time at work because I am growing very weak and sick.I am very anemic and don't know what to do..I'm also having severe back pains..I know pregnancy isn't the problem because I have never had sex and won't be until marriage..if you can, please answer this question immediately. thanks

And please don't say that i should visit a doctor... i know that, but do u have any ideas of wat might be causing this so when i do visit a doctor i'm aware of them?

Last Thursday I got sent to two different Psyche Wards, the first one said it's not my fault for feeling like this, and sent me to another place because they don't treat children, only evaluate them. The second one had me wait for an hour than 5 different doctors came and talked to me. They decided I was safe to go home, when on my out I was thinking I wanna die, I wish I had a bottle of sleeping pills, anything I could O.D. on. They sent me home because them and everyone else (except the first doctor) think I'm just trying to scare my mom and dad into letting me switch schools. When that is far what is going on. I'm not that shallow. I just don't know what to do. My parents don't take me seriously, the second Psyche Ward didn't. I know one of these days soon I'm gonna end it all. Because what'll happen is I'll be really depressed and I'll 'happen' to have a full bottle of pills and I'll kill myself. They realy don't take me seriously and won't believe me. How can I handle this?

He has always had trouble sleeping and still does. He is living on his own and is losing weight. A couple days ago he said he thinks he's been depressed the last week. He constantly says things like he has no feelings and he's numb. He doesn't seem to know anything and he keeps saying it's him not me. He's very negative for the most part. Also his is father was diagnosed with severe depression. So I finally bring it to his attention today and told him that I think that he is suffering from depression and maybe that's why it's getting in the way of our relationship. He laughed it off like I was crazy. Here's the thing he's a police officer and he said that he would know if he was depressed since he is the "Mental Health representative." Something has changed in my husband and I cant' reach him. Could it just be me or is it likely that I am right?? Opinions please.....

I dont know exactly what he takes but it bothers me that he does take it.  I have tried to ignor it and we have talked about it before, but we dont get anywhere because he only sees his side(supplements) and i only see my side of not taking any.  Im not really educated about them.  Why do guys have to take protein shakes? Work out supplements/pills? Why get big fast when you can do it naturally? Do most of them make you have "roid rage effect"? I am not sure why i feel so against them.  I feel like guys may not know their own strength then i get hurt.        I dont want him to not take them because of me, its his life and i want him to make the decison on his own, I just want to understand why.

20090222183518AA6bFO9	Health;Mental Health	Christian woman w/crippling anxiety and guilt?	I guess I need some reassurance that other people go through this. For about a year now, I have been feeling guilty and scared constantly. Once I lay one thing to rest, another situation pops up and I am creating my own hell. I just feel as if almost everything I do is wrong and I feel like if I don't witness to people constantly, then I have lost favor with God. (I know that the way I am feeling is not biblical) I can't seem to internalize once and for all that I am saved by God's grace through faith in His Son, not by works. I always hear this little voice telling me that I am not doing enough. I guess because I am a control freak, I can't let go and let Him take over. I am being beaten down, Some days, it is hard to function mentally. I read my Bible every day and pray constantly, but I continue to be afflicted. I KNOW that God will get me through this, but I feel as if I am being a horrible example to those around me right now. I want to glorify Him, but it is as if my selfish desires and self-righteousness always win. How can I find Christian fellowship without leaving my home?   Having said all of this, I would rather go through this with God, than live life without Him.   Please, no discouraging anti-Christian answers, it's not nice to kick people while they are down.

Here's the problem, as we were engaging, she shouted things like deeper, harder, and so on. Me being the loyal guy i am, i obeyed. But i noticed the blood on the condom, which caused me to stop. I made her aware of what was happening and she said its nothing and to keep doing her. I was reluctant at first, but she said it was ok to keep going. Anyway, i gave her a call today to see how she was doing, SHE WAS PISSED. She explained to me that the blood hadn't stopped yet. I said i asked you did you want me to stop last night and you said don't worry about it. She tells me i should never listen to a woman during sex! Granted, i'm average , but i don't think an average penis could cause this kind of damage. Dudes, please help me, its really bothering me and i can't stop thinking about it. O yeah,  she wasn't on her period either!!!!!

20090222191231AA9NoXT	Health;Mental Health	Hyperactivity to the extreme...?	Ok, I get hyper all the time and everyone thinks it's so cute and adorable and I can't stand it. I literally get scared when I'm hyper because I can't control myself, I'm racing at what seems to be a thousand miles an hour, I can't pay attention, I get the jitters, I'm so uncontrollable. I'm 18 years old, so it's not like I'm one of those "wild children" or anything who will grow out of it, I've only been like this for maybe 2-3 years. I eat healthier than anyone I know, I don't drink soda/juice/definitely not energy drinks, all I drink is water, I exercise more than the average person, I get enough sleep every night. I really can't think of anything that would make me hyper, but I am. Other times I get a slight depression, but I don't think about suicide, I don't harm myself or anything, the only thing that scares me about my personality is my hyperactivity. It's really scaring me. Any ideas of what it could be? Help?

20090222203407AAMJQM6	Health;Mental Health	The nightmares haunt me?	I'm in therapy for depression. It's difficult for me to let things go and move on with my life. One of the problems I have is caused by my nightmares. Once I have one, I can be stressed about it all day or even for the week.      A recent one I had was when I snapped at my neighbor's dog. I was outside doing yard work and it pestered me. I ended up beating it with the shovel. I then dragged it into the woods and tried to bury it without getting caught. Another one was when I was driving and someone cut me off on the highway. I then proceeded to run them off the road doing the pit maneuver like police officers do in high speed chases.  It bothers me because I am not a violent person and would never do anything like this.       But the one I had last night was about my grandmother dying. It just made me really sad and I've been dwelling on it all day. I work in a cemetery and have worked as a funeral director's assistant: I realize death happens and have seen it many times. It's just like I'm being paranoid about it.       Any suggestion what to do? It's like I have these dreams just to torturer myself even more and have found a way to do so even in a subconscious state.

I'm not purchasing my own groceries right now, which is why I need to save some money - I don't think anyone else should have to pay for my choices.  I probably won't be able to purchase much organic produce, so is it still worthwhile to go raw?        From what I've read, most advocate organic, but that just isn't a viable option right now.  I don't exactly buy all of the purported benefits of the diet, but I do think that it is extremely healthy (or can be).  What are your thoughts on organic vs. not?

20090222205432AAs6SOA	Health;Mental Health	Hate my job...what can I/do I do?	I recently got a new job and have been there for only 3 months. At first the job seemed great and perfect but now I've come to terms with the fact that I hate to do what I do.      I've been searching the internet using the search terms, "I hate my job" and have gotten some pretty interesting websites and insights from people. The only problem with most of those websites is that they are geared for people who hate their jobs because of management or co-workers, but never actually because of their work.      My job is basically to talk to people all day long for 10 hours. Most people are alright but it's that 1 person in the whole day that can really hurt you mentally and physically, especially if you're brand new to the whole "mass" customer service scene.      Now I'm not complaining about my co-workers because they are great and management is alright, nothing to complain about there either, and most everybody there is just so polite. Of course, every work place has its share of fake people but it's only limited to about .01% of the workforce there.      I guess my question is, what are some of the things that those in the customer service field, such as collectors or phone reps, do to not let these miserable customers bother you. I try my best every night/morning to try and convince myself that it's only temporary, that I'm going to school for something better, that I need the job because of money issues -- but none of it seems to work; I always resort to being miserable the next day until I get into the grove of things and start smiling and talking with my co-workers at the end of the day.      I fall asleep every night dreading waking up the next morning to go to work (the long, chaotic drive there does not make things any better for me to start with in the morning).      I feel like I was never meant for customer service; I've always been too polite with people and at the end feel as if I waste my time with them since they apparently don't even notice that I'm genuinely trying to be helpful and friendly with them; it feels like everything that I do, I do in vein. The majority of the people I speak with on a daily basis don't seem to realize that you're just like them, you just have a job to do. They also don't seem to realize that behind that voice is a human being, just like them, who will take offense to anything that they will take offense to.      What the heck do I do. I know life is tough and I deal with it the best I can. I suppose I just need a little bit of advice/motivation to keep me going until I get myself to the career of my choice.      Thanks for all the advice/help you can give. I appreciate it. :)

I'm thinking about drinking my 8oz before I leave to school. I thought about taking a sport's bottle with me to school with 16oz of the stuff so i can drink the first 8oz about 30 minutes before I start and the other 8 after I'm done. Only problem with that is that the water will be at room temperature by the time I start to drink it 4 hours after I leave home. Any suggestions on when I should drink the protein shake?

20090222193830AANJRC8	Health;Diseases & Conditions;STDs	Can my girlfriend and I contract HIV via these methods? (Sexual content- mature answers are appreciated.)?	My girlfriend works as a nursing assistant at a facility where elderly people in rehabilitation / resting.       Last night (21 hours ago) , one of her patients, however, is HIV positive. From what my girlfriend told me, all she did was help turn her around from time to time, touching the patient's skin/clothes with latex gloves on.      Sidenotes:      The patient makes sure to cover her mouth while coughing with a personal face towel.      My girlfriend makes sure to wash her own hands and face frequently every day at work, and makes sure to follow all proper CNA procedures while handling patients.         1. Is my girlfriend able to contact the HIV virus via touching the patient's skin with latex gloves on?         (Another part of the question, with some mature content, please forgive me.)      The next day (today) after work, I came over to my girlfriend's house. By then, she's showered and cleaned up, brushed her teeth and all, before greeting me at the door. Later on during the day, we did some sexual things- we kissed tongue to tongue... and then engaged in oral sex (my penis was inside her mouth.)      Other info: both my girlfriend an I were both tested for any STD's and diseases, and all came out negative.      Also... we have been doing oral sex for over a month now... (i apologize for anything sounding crude or embarassing.)         2. Now, if in case she has a possibility of contracting HIV from touching her patient, would that put me at risk of catching HIV as well, considering the information- and additional information- mentioned above?      Thank you so much for your time, and have a good day.

20090222212358AA74lff	Health;Diet & Fitness	How do you ever truly love yourself?	I've come to the conclusion that the reason I don't have many close friends nor ever been in a relationship at 21, is because of my inability to love myself. Part of the reason I can't love myself is because I haven't figured out who I am yet. For instance, I'm studying economics and business in college, but I know deep down, that these aren't my true passions. Basically I haven't found what I want out of life. I then tell myself that life has no meaning anyway, so nothing really matters.   Anyway, I realize that I do have some good traits...like I can be extremely funny at times and I'm easy to talk to. I then start thinking that maybe I am a decent person, just trying to find my way in life like everyone else and that I shouldn't be so hard on myself. But when it comes down to it, I don't know who I am or what I would like to be...so how can I truly love myself? Maybe I should just love that I'm trying to find myself..?

He is good looking- but when he doesnt shower he just looks like a dirty drug addict or something. He used to get mad but now I just get him in the shower really wuick- Ill say something like "Wow, you had a long day at work, let me start the shower and some food for you" He still gets an attitude even then.       When I tell him its gross he says "the people in France/Europe dont shower everyday" But even if he would just shower every other day, I'd be much happier.       He also doesnt brush his teeth more than once a day, and he never washes his face. (And he smokes, as do I- but I brush my teeth 5-6 ttimes a day)       What can I do to make him shower, I tried having sex with hinm right after he gets out of the shower- (like maybe he would take a hint) But it didnt work.

20090222213722AArj9tJ	Health;Mental Health	Self-harm - How do I stop so I don't lose the only person who cares?	My life is crazy stressful since I started college and I get overwhelmed often. Cutting was my outlet for several months. It gave me a sense of control over my own life again. In high school I was in charge of several clubs and things. I liked it, I did well. Anyway, make a long story short, my fiance caught me several times with cuts on my arm. He didn't react well at all. This last time, he told me he couldn't marry someone who did this to herself because it hurt him too much to know that I was hurting myself. He said if I keep doing it he'll cut me out of his life. I know he sounds harsh, but it's one of those tough love situations. I can't lose him. I feel like he's the only one who actually gives half a sh!t about me anymore - my family's a whole nother sob story. Anyway, if anyone has dealt with quitting self-harm and has some advice, please share. People who've never experienced the numbing ecstasy of cutting don't understand and I wouldn't expect them to. I didn't understand why anyone would cut until I tried it. Then I found out that it's almost like a drug. It's the quickest, easiest way out to a moment of calm so as soon as you feel bad, you look for something sharp. At any rate, if you have any advice on how to stop, let me know please.      Also, I really don't want to hear any sympathy or the like. I didn't ever do it for attention - I tried pretty hard to hide it. And, I really don't want some a$$holes telling me I'm stupid and looking for attention either. So please, if that's all you have to offer, move on to the next question.   Thanks to those who can offer help.

He prescribed me darvocet and soma and told me to keep taking vicodin. I woke up to go into work (I work overnights) and I was in severe pain. I took another Darvocet, Soma, and Vicodin. 30 minutes pass and Im still in horrible pain. I cried the whole way to work and when I got there they sent me home to rest. I took another darvocet and Im still in a lot of pain. My discharge papers say go back to the ER if I get worse or am in severe pain. My question is if I go back is there anything they can do for me besides a pain injection? Im in a sling but is there a cast or splint they could use for my shoulder? Also is there a stronger pain medication I can take until I see an orthopedic surgeon? Thank you.

20090222211822AALIvuL	Health;Diseases & Conditions;Heart Diseases	Concerns about heart health.?	All right, first of all, I want to preface this by saying I have severe OCD (Pure-O) and I often catch intrusive thoughts and can't rid my head of them for a long, long time. Usually I'll notice one symptom of something, start Googling and then from there things usually get worse for me. I've done this in the past, so I'm not overly alarmed, but at the same time I'm still very concerned.      I've had issues with an eating disorder (anorexia) on and off for about 6 years. It's never really been a major issue except for on a couple of occasions where my weight dipped down into the 100-teens, but it only stayed that way very briefly. Mostly, I restrict moderately and over-exercise. But, really, aside from keeping myself about 10-15 pounds under my normal weight in the past 1 1/2 years (165 normal around 150 or so right now), it's been in check.      Lately, however, I've started having a lot of concerns. It started with some really disabling heart palpitations and an increased heart rate. The obsession and anxiety from it got so bad that I was eventually hospitalized.      I'm a compulsive e.r. visitor and in the time all this has been going on I've had 3-4 EKGs (ECGs) performed, chest x-rays, a sonogram and I've had several doctors listen to my heart. Additionally, I had my vitals checked regularly at the psych ward and everything turned out a-okay. I know I'm probably worrying here way too much (as I have a penchant to do) but I can't shake the concern. It's gotten to the point where I'm mostly bed-ridden, can't walk around without feeling anxious, or being overly aware of my heart rate and feel short of breath, shaky and scared. I also have been compulsively checking my heart rate and it's generally in the 70s-80s range but when I get up and walk around it reaches 90s-102. I know stress can contribute to a lot of this, but I just cannot get rid of this fear.      Is there anyway that any of the diagnostic tests performed could've missed anything? I know it's unlikely, but I'm not that well-versed in cardiology tests and such. Please help my anxieties! I feel stupid asking my doctor, but at the same time I'm genuinely concerned.
