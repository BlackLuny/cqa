20090128211032AAdMmhM	Business & Finance;Careers & Employment;Law & Legal	Legal Advice - Final paycheck?	Hi all,   I need some help on my situation.   The story went like this. I quit my job on 10/20/2008 and had given a verbal notice to my employer on 10/10/2008. On my last day, the employer told me to write a resignation letter. However, the employer did not pay my final paycheck on that day. After a few weeks, I still did not receive it so I filed a claim. He finally paid me on 11/10/2008. Now we both received the letter to go to the conference. I'm afraid that he will lie and tell the officer that I did not give him the proper notice even though all of my friends in the company that I gave him the notice way before my last day. What should I say when I go to the conference because I don't really want to mention my friends and bring trouble to them?      Another story is that when I worked for the employer, he bought some work-related stuffs (total to around $20 bucks) and gave it to me. He did not mention I would have to return them and he did not say anything on my last day either. Now from what I know, he is pissed for having to go to the conference and filed a police report stating that I stole the stuffs . I am in total shock. Can you please give me some advice to deal with this situation?      Thank you

20090128212614AA5FBbJ	Business & Finance;Personal Finance	Should I have my friend do my income tax return or a professional accountant?	Hi,      A friend of mine started doing income tax return last year. He does it for a couple of his friends, and charges them.      I am 20. I have always had my income tax return done through my dad who pays an accountant who does it for our whole family.      This coming tax return season, I'd rather my dad doesn't see what I made. This is because I think he will make me pay for more things, which isn't wrong, but because I know he will never ask my sister to pay for these things, it bothers me that I should.      (I am also female) Yes, I make more than my sister, but I have also worked longer in retail, this is why I've landed a better paying job, after all the years I've worked while going to school.      Do you think it makes sense to pay my friend to do my tax return (he has a bit of experience)? Would his experience be sufficient? Or do you think I will get a lot less back than from a professional accountant, and I should pay for my own professional accoutant. I have no idea how to do income tax and how complicated it is!      Thanks

In this case, this means that i sold 50% of my company against boosting its capital, i got nothing for my self, is this technically correct and possible?

[my answer to that is the irs is asking for "tips" on alleged fraud, not evidence]   Do yourself a big favor. Forget about it.    This is not something the IRS really like to hear.

20090128222158AAOZVAr	Business & Finance;Taxes;United States	I need advice concerning properties and property taxes?	So I own two properties that have a store on the first floor and apartments on the second floor. In the past year, I extended the first floors of both properties without extending the second floors. The problem however is that now they are both classified as tax class 4 properties as opposed to tax class 1 because over half the area is now for business.       The difference is that tax class 1 properties are charged a tax rate of 15.746% is applied to 6% of the "market value" while tax class 4 are charged a tax rate of 11.306% is applied to 45% of the "market value". The increase is huge. The way it works is that the cost will steadily progress to the full value in a 5 year period. So in 5 years, I will be paying more than 5 times what I paid last year.      I've considered building upward to increase residential area, extending the second floors, or just selling one of the properties. The cons of building upward are that it costs a lot and will take a long time; the pros are two new apartments to collect rent. The cons of extending the second floor is that it will still cost a lot but not as much and the rent will not be increased by a lot. The cons of selling one is that I will lose money from buying the property, extending it, and then selling it.       I would like to hear more opinions. If you have any other ideas, please feel free to say them.

20090128220302AAoTEfp	Business & Finance;Careers & Employment;Technology	I don't know what career in technology to choose. PLEASE PLEASE help me out : ( THANKS?	I have a keen interest in learning about new technologies and would love to be a part of something to do with technology. The only problem is that I don’t know what college major to pick. I’ve thought about computer science and have even gone to my friend’s computer science courses and find them REALLY boring. I don’t know about engineering either, it’s just too complicated and math oriented. I just know that I want a unique career in technology which will give me the opportunity to make some good money. I don’t want to go into software engineering, interactive media and graphic design though. Whenever I hear about new technologies such as cyborg, I get really excited. I love to build things. Someday I want to create something really great. I highly doubt engineering is for me since I never really got good grades in math all throughout high school. I also didn’t take chemistry or physics or anything in high school. Chemistry, physics and math doesn’t really interest me much, but I still want to do something that has to do with technology. Please suggest something to me. Thanks so much.

The letter looked absolutely legitimate that's what freaked me out so bad, but when i contacted the State Department of Revenue here in Indiana, they told me I had no outstanding tax liability, i even got an e-mail confirmation.  It was weird though cause the letter stated that I could not renew my liquor license because I owed outstanding tax liabilities and that I had a missing return from 1999.  I didn't even work in 1999, I was having a child and I was unemployed.  Weird huh.....Now of course, I can't find the original letter, but I filed my taxes anyway so I guess we will see what happens.  At least I have the attachment the DOR sent with their e-mail to me today saying that I owe no taxes.  I saved it of course.  I just don't understand how the DOR could make a mistake?

20090128223959AAb1isJ	Business & Finance;Credit	652 credit score for a 21 year old - Good or Bad?	I am just curious, I have a credit score of 652 (For some reason I only got 1 of 3 scores, so I assume it's the important/combined score). I know that 652 isn't great but is it good considering the fact that I'm only 21 and have only been using ONE credit card for two years. I have had an apartment with a roommate for 4 months but it took just about 4 months for me to get the report I ordered so it might not be on their that I've been independent. Shipping error, plus forwarding from old address, plus being too nervous to open it and letting it sit around for a month. So I'm basically just wondering is 652 a good score for an average 21 year old. Someone else asked if 652 is a good score, but they were asking in terms of getting financing for a house, which I have to assume means they're older, also they earn more money annually. Mine is a lil different. Any answer would be appreciated. Thanks.

20090129001457AA61Wt7	Business & Finance;Careers & Employment;Other - Careers & Employment	Does my bf have a good chance of getting a job?	He's been trying since Sept 08. He got 5 interviews in office/business/communications/bank but he didn't get any of the jobs. One was even just seasonal. One paid only $12/hr. He doesn't have any education except some university & high school graduation. But he has been working since then for only 1 or 2 trading companies (long time employee). I don't think it's his personality or being unprepared. He always complains about how workers do a bad job & he can do better. I really do often see it (like a teller couldn't even count money). When he speaks, he's very knowledgeable & confident. He's also very nice & dresses to impress. He really tries hard.       He keeps trying for government jobs, assistant managers, & other jobs that pay $20/hr or more. I think he should try for jobs that pay $10-12. I think even 15 is pushing it. Now he's looking for an assistant manager job in the restaurant industry. It's not asking for ANY experience in restaurants. But I think people who have restaurant experience will get chosen over him. He should just become a waiter if he's really in need of money. Do you think he can get the manager job?       He also keeps searching for jobs online. He only applies if he can find it online. I think that's not the way to go if you just want a job PERIOD. He also wants to go back to school but all programs are in progress already, which is why he's doing the job search. Should he keep searching for jobs the way he has done so far? Should he aim lower? I just don't want him to spend a whole year searching for a job. I think he's losing the jobs to people who have degrees. What do you think? Is it really all about "who you know, not what you know" when it comes to getting a job? And finally, he's only told 1 or 2 employers that he's been doing his own business. But does having your own business make you less of a potential?      Please answer all questions for best answer. But do whatever u can just to help out.
20090128232448AASrLGx	Business & Finance;Renting & Real Estate	Real Estate Investments - Properties Insurance Dilemma/ISSUE!?	Hi,   6 months ago I stopped working for a company I used to work for. The problem is I got a Great Discount from an insurance company BASED on the fact I am working for this big company.    Now I am a little worried that if I call the insurance company to tell them i am no longer an employee there, there will be penalty for telling them about it only now! How should I tell them about it? I have/had no claim by the way and the insurance is for real estate properties (rental Business). I just don't want them to update I lied or something and then i will not be able to get insurance at all, not even from other companies or at least not for a good price - that is my main concern. Is it better to come to their office to explain the situation instead of calling!? Any advice how to avoid negative consequences in this case would be highly appreciated! THANKS.

20090129011449AAnxvO3	Business & Finance;Insurance	Deceased uncle left house to my kids but died in 2003 in NJ, we're in Co and want to know about the will.?	So, he was always supposed to have left his house-formerly their Grandparents house to my children. This was their father's brother. We were in good standing with each other and I don't think anything would have changed but after a fire and a wrongful blaming of my daughter we left Mt and were not in contact with him anymore beyond 2000. I'm not entirely sure that he died but from what little information I can find by scouring the internet, I found something saying that a person with his name in the approximate area and address had died in 2003. Well, if he left the house to my kids and he died before we could ever reunite-how do I find out how to get the house for them or at least the money from the house for my kids? What happens in a case like this and how do you find out the info you need from Colorado to New Jersey without making the trek over there? That was always the plan and I don't think he changed it but it is possible. Still my daughter and song are entitled to the money/home if that is the case so what should I do to find out if there is a will and to help them make their claim as it were? I hope this made sense and I gladly appreciate any help you can offer in this unusual circumstance.
20090129010257AA38t2C	Business & Finance;Taxes;United States	What does it take to get those $1,000-2,000 tax returns?	You know how you see all those advertisements for Turbotax and how you can maximize your refund? Sometimes showing up to $2,600? How much would you have to make? How much is the highest a single person can make? Here's the entire reason for this question:      Last year for my taxes I was still in college and graduated in the Spring, I got into full time work and the highest my return would give me is: $427.00 fed and $213.00 state + the $300 tax rebate. For 2008 I made a little under $20,400.00 and my taxes are not at all what I expected them to be: $303 fed and $35 state. I don't know much about taxes obviously but I had it in my mind that this years returns would be far more and I REALLY didn't expect my state to be next to nothing. I got used to making what I thought was the most you could get-$215 for state, now it's $35?       In any case, what does it take to get decent money back?  I'm sorely disappointed, I thought my taxes would be more after getting into full time work-even though I've since lost that work in Nov. So does anyone know how much you'd have to earn to get good returns?  And also what's the max for a single person on Fed & state? Thanks for any insight.

20090129021905AAiPAoT	Business & Finance;Careers & Employment;Other - Careers & Employment	I finished year 10 last year, I was going to do a tafe course this year but...?	Today I realized this course (which goes all year) is only english and maths. This is the equivalent of year 11 btw. I'm disappointed because I really thought I would be able to do more subjects. I absolutely hate maths, although I am good at it. The guy there said this course was for people who "wanted to brush up on their english and math skills."   I know its good to have an education and more qualifications behind you, but the course I originally wanted to do isn't being held.   I want to be a musician/model, my back up plan is to be a sound engineer or manager.   I don't think there is any point doing a whole year of english and maths if this is what I want to do, and I'm already good at both.   My plan is to get a second job, work pretty much 24/7 for either a semester or whole year, then really decide on a course I want to do at tafe [if i haven't started my modeling career by then..]   If modeling doesn't work out I will have music to fall back on and vice versa.   Do you think this is good?

20090129030618AApyPpl	Business & Finance;Credit	Joint Mortgage Application?	Hi people.      My boyfriend and I are going to start looking at buying a house together later this year.      He has very good credit rating, but 3 years ago I got into a dispute with my old university about some tuition fees and they took out a CCJ against me.       I eventually paid the CCJ, two months after it was issued against me. It now shows that it is satisfied on my credit report, and the amount of the CCJ was ￡743.      Other than that, I have a good credit history, no missed payments on my credit card or bank loan and I am in a stable, well paid job.      I am worried that when we come to get a mortgage, I won't be able to get one because of my CCJ three years ago and therefore my boyfriend and I won't be able to buy a house together.      Does anyone know how easy or hard this will be?

And.. should be stripped of that power?	7 years is just too damn long to answer to some power you can't even see. I really think the credit bureaus need to go bye bye...and the 7 year b/s has to go too.   1 hour ago - 3 days left to answer.    Additional Details   1 hour ago      It should be ONE company, Government run and your past history runs like your checking account ledger...a company can look up anytime they want and if you have paid your debts on time for the last 2 years then so be it..but they go by a score that is unrealistic in this day and age..it should go by your recent history not what you did 6 1/2 years ago. And btw did you know that if you pay off a bill 5 years into the 7 years it starts the whole 7 years all over again? Do you really think this is fair to people who want to do the right thing..or a mort co. makes you pay an outstanding bill to give you a mortgage and therefore makes your credit actually worse....again because it starts the 7 years ALL over again.

Im pregnant so i can smell things very strongly, but i know its just not me being pregnant and smelling her, my husband also smells her too.      Its a smell like a garbage dump and like shes been wearing the same clothes for a month non-stop.         Is there anything I can do?

Unfortunately, several years ago I fell behind on my car note and loss my car. The company tried to take me to court but I filed  a Chptr 13 bankruptcy. After paying them a total of $10, 014 for a car that was only financed at $7,000 and only actually worth $3,500.  They still say I owe them $5,000. ('95 Ford Contour-come on!) My Chptr 13 was dismissed because I lost my job. This was 5 yrs ago. A few days ago I checked my checking account balance and notice that I was negative $96.13. So I called the bank and found out that the financing company for the car got a judgment against me to garnish my bank account. They took every dime I had! All $2.14 of it! LOL! I could not believe this. Like I said I am a college student and I don't work (kids and can't find a job) I rely on child support and student loans to make it- plus  I Iive on campus. How is it that they are able to do this? Can someone take all the money you have like that and leave you to become possibly homeless? I am afraid that they will take all of my school money that is drect deposited into my account and my Monthly child support. Is there anything I can do short of filing Chptr 7 bankruptcy to keep them from making me and my kids homeless?

Below is a list of the things which will require updating.     1.  Application Form: Most of you have changed jobs since you moved in and the information which we have is obsolete.     2.  Security Deposit:  Each year, tenants are required to pay an amount equal to their yearly increase since their move-in date.  Before we sell the building, we will collect this amount so that your security deposit will reflect your current rent.  (In either case, this amount is due when you are notified.)                        3.  Unpaid fees or charges:  Repairs for damage within your apartment will be due thirty days' from notification; otherwise, it will be deducted from your Security Deposit prior to the transfer.

But I would be lying if we weren't feeling very worried about his future on our return.  He will not have a penny, we are unsure whether to try and sign him on on Monday before we leave on the Thursday or to wait until our return.

For the last few weeks NatWest have been advertising their financial advice on television and radio claiming that they can help us manage our money better.      Natwest is owned by Royal Bank of Scotland, who last week announced the biggest loss ever by a British company.

20090129035717AAEwJXD	Business & Finance;Credit	My wife has a credit card solely in her name.  A lawyer called me yesterday and said they can sue me.?	The lawyer told me they can garnish my wages and take property away even though my name is not on the credit card.  We have not received any kind of letter from this lawyer.  The credit that is owed is from over a year ago which we thought was paid. The lawyer said that most of what is owed on it now is interest and late payments. We have never received a bill or a call from the credit card company in over a year. Am I responsible for this debt? Can the lawyer take my personal property? I live in the state of Connecticut.

20090129034635AAJDt6m	Business & Finance;Other - Business & Finance	Why are people calling a stimulus rebate a "handout"?	I think a hadout is giving money to foodstamps.  Medicaid, so why is it so bad to give the taxpayers a lil rebate check. They gave corporate america 700 Bill something dollars and we don't even really know what they are doing with it besides handing out billion dollar bonus. Giving people who paid taxes a rebate check is not a hand out and will end up stimulating the economy instead of giving money to greedy CEOs to mismanage it.
