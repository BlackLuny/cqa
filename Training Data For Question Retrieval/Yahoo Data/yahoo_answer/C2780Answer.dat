The meats are weird - the steak is rubbery, and the chicken has a texture like it was frozen and then microwaved.  Also, the portions are getting smaller and smaller.

BA3mGlTyaa	I wasn't able to find any figures for Britain but I can tell you that Hawaii is the largest SPAM consumers in the United States.  We look it so much over here that we have a SPAM Festival every April or so, I think it is April but you might want to check it out.  The flavor was an acquired flavor from WWII when the service members introduce the product to Hawaii and since then it has been history.  Also with the Spam Musubi an hot item; a slice of Spam, rice block, and then tied with a nora wrapper, helps with the consumption of Spam here to.  http://www.spamjamhawaii.com/    It is so popular that the local McDonald's offer a Spam breakfast plate, that should tell you something.      Just another local,    www.hawaii-vacation-adventures-oahu.co...|`|22a6171dbf228d985a61502855bebebfaa	My guess is Hawaii. I've been to both several times, and never had Spam in Britain.

4604flr2aa	I don't recall exact amounts but I clearly remember tipping well above and beyon what is expected in two cases:    One at a Olive Garden restaurant.  We had a waiter that was very nice, very attentive and we already would have given him a decent tip at the end of our meal based on that alone.  BUT the table behind us had some real JERKS and they were being downright RUDE to this man, treating him like he was an idiot.  And no matter how terrible they became with him, he was very polite with them and never lost his cool.  He still managed to smile and say "yes sir" and "yes maam" to them.  We left a HUGE tip and I even wrote a note on our receipt that we noticed the horrible customers behind us and that he in no way deserved to be treated like that but he handled it like a pro!      The second time we left a big tip was at a Pizza Hut in Canada.  I don't even know how much money we left but we were about to drive back over the border into the US and so we just left all of our Canadian money on the table.  LoL  I know it was a lot.... especially because the waiter came running out to our vehicle as we were pulling away and he was smiling and jumping up and down, waving his arms and yelling "thank you!!!!!"  LoL  Made us feel good just to do something randomly nice for someone....|`|EpCuEvvdaa	the biggest was    50   for a group of us as it was a birthday and they did specal thing and we created our own menu|`|GdXOjRNmaa	I ate a $21. meal (total), gave the waitress two 20 dollard bills & told her to keep the change. Why? Because the service was good, she looked like she was a hard worker... & some dumb moron sitting at a table next to me was giving her a really hard time & she didn't deserve that at all!|`|PxJXJKCpaa	50%.  She was great even tho she was really busy.  She even took time out to sit with us and laugh with us.|`|doL0RZN8aa	like $20 it was good service|`|ljFBfguRaa	If the service is outstanding and I get a hook-up (free drink, etc.) I'll tip 50%. For good service 30%, and for average 20%. I'm a server, so I know how hard it can be!|`|a1XEf8lKaa	biggest and best tip was to Get out of the business before its too late|`|Zs9ardfVaa	it wasn't me but my parents gave a $20.00 tip to a waiter  in Domician Republic. the service was the best we ever had. the waiter would come around to our table every five minutes and get us more water|`|U3DK6ngEaa	As a waitress or waitor, which i was for a long time in a high class, expensive place, prioritizing is key to be great! Listening to each person! I seem to be harsh on waitor(s) because I have been there myself and have a high expectation. At the same time I'm understanding when things go wrong because it's not always their fault.     The biggest tip I have ever given was 170. The resturaunt was crashing in primetime dinner. The wait was insaine!     There were trays of food being dropped on customers, I think I counted 4 dropped in the hour and half I was there.    Managers seemed they couldn't keep up with the amount of tables that needed to be appoligized to and were probibly giving away meals left and right!    Waitors looked like they wanted to cry, and some were.    1) In the midst of all this my waitress remained calm   2) Got our entire order right.   3) Told us our food took a little long because the kitchen almost sent it out wrong but she caught it before it went out, which, wow! Most people would just blame it on the kitchen or not pay attention to their food before it comes out but she did!   4) She attended to us in a mannerly time.  5) Always kept our glasses full.  6) A table next to us grabbed her arm, yanked her over and screamed in her face their food was cold ( I don't even think it was her table)  but she was friendly to the very rude man and continued to be friendly to us the entire time the resturaunt fell apart.   ~~~~SHE WAS GREAT!!!~~~~~  ~~~~~~$170 EARNED!~~~~~~~|`|2pq3y2ghaa	Tip- Don't wear white laces in black shoes..|`|alAtUXvyaa	biggest tip was like 60 percent the cost of the food, and i did it because nobody ever tips me at my job (movie theater) and its really frustrating when youre running around all day getting food for people and they dont tip. so i ALWAYS tip a lot.  o.0|`|3ebc425dfc34d77aab552c551168acc9aa	A regular gave me a $2500 tip (in the form of a check)-he had been having a hard time, was lonely, and needed to talk.  I paid attention to him, gave him good service, and geniunely cared.  I remembered what he liked to drink, I remembered things he talked about and would ask him about them...I asked him questions & let him talk and made him feel like someone gave a crap.  He was very generous in return, obviously.|`|ULL3oIOeaa	biggest tip $9 my steak was underdone so i told them it was underdone i was alone at my table so they gave me 8 free apple pies  the pies were $10 each|`|iKDhHNX2aa	My husband and I were at a small, out of the way restaurant in Lake Tahoe.  It was a sunny and beautiful day and although no one was sitting at the outdoor tables, we asked to be seated outdoors.  Our waiter rushed to clean up the outdoor area, was the most attentive waiter we've ever had----even added his own personal touches to the plating to make everything "special".       Bill was $75.00 --- we gave the waiter a $100 tip.   Hands down the best service we've ever had.|`|gcwG5a0Gaa	i gave a korean restaurant $250|`|Gj3B81gQaa	i want to say six dollars........and because the bartender didnt charge me for my strawberry limeade and i got a free refill as well!!!!!!!!!!

Hopefully, I helped a little.|`|JnLoHaoAaa	Average amount of tables about 60   Average dining time for lunch is about 35-55 minutes and for dinner about 50-over an hour|`|doL0RZN8aa	i would say about 20|`|WGJIwanHaa	20
nFakIvgoaa	I have never eaten there, but a lot of people I work with swear by Bottega Italian Restaurant  2242 Highland Ave South  Birmingham, AL 35205  (205) 933-2001    War Eagle & Happy Eating!|`|8cDd70dSaa	Have you been to Petrucelli's? It's by the intersection of 119 and 280 near Inverness. They have good food there. If that doesn't work for you, you could always go to Carrabba's, Macaroni Grill, Olive Garden, etc.
LkDgsxGbaa	I was at I-Hop, during an off peak hour, and we were the only table in the restaurant.  It took the server 20 minutes to greet us and another 5 min. to receive our drinks.  We waited another 10 min. and the server never appeared.  We could see her talking to the cooks and laughing.  There were two other servers as well.  We walked and left nothing.  We didn't pay for the drinks and it was very wise of the staff not to pursue us for payment.  I have been a server for 25 years and I am a great tipper.  I don't agree with posters who state that you should still leave a small percentage for terrible service.  LEAVE NOTHING!  You should always let mgmt. know the problem and explain to your server why they were left nothing.  If I can tell the server is trying their best or that the restaurant is packed or understaffed I take that into consideration.  As long as the server is friendly I will let alot slide.  I have received service that was prompt and correct, but the server had a very nasty attitude and in that situation I will leave nothing.  I have had slow service and incorrect orders, yet the server was friendly and trying their best and I have tipped very well.  I try to be very aware of my dining surroundings and take many things into consideration.  Some things are out of the server's control.  There is never an excuse for unwarranted, rude service.|`|LiVfS4Zxaa	Can't really say, but once in Turkey we were at a really nice resort in Antalya. The dining area was overcrowding a bit so the waiter actually said , "for five euros, no problem!" he'd get us a table, champagne cooler and waiter service (it was a kind of buffet). We were amazed he had the cheek to ask for money, but gave him the euros anyway|`|gcwG5a0Gaa	gave a restaurant $2 and i recommend them a decorator Company|`|Gj3B81gQaa	i must say that the smallest tip was nothing.......and what warranted the lousy tip was bad service and no respect|`|pqLY2nKSaa	Not too long ago I went to Cool Hand Luke's and received terrible service. We were with a party of six, and I didn't get my drink until a good twenty minutes after everyone else, and it was just a water. Then someone ordered coconut shrimp, well they were given cold fried shrimp with coconut thrown on top. When they informed the waitress, she snapped back saying she didn't make it so it wasn't her fault. All night she was very short with us and acted like it was an inconvenience to serve us. My family is full of very friendly people, so it wasn't like they were difficult or rude at all. When we recurved the bill it was $100.97 and we paid with a credit car. On the tip line we wrote $.03 to make it an even $101 and so she knew were unhappy with her service and not cheap customers who don't tip.|`|vykIXhblaa	I left a waitress a penny once, this way she knew that I didn't forget to tip, I wanted to tip but she was terrible.  Oh and I left it tails side up.  Her attitude and unwillingness to accommodate our needs warranted this bad tip.|`|ULL3oIOeaa	my smallest tip was a penny i wanted 2 pay more but the waitress was nasty the whole place was nasty i went 2 waffle house and i saw 5 cockroaches and one was in my food i  said ewww asked the waitress did you wash your hands she said no i said your sick then she spit in my food i said ewwwww and left and i told everybody what had happened and soon the place went out of business|`|f2J7jhlraa	i left a penny at one resttaurant because i was ordering for my dad and  this was a favorite rest. of his so wed been there often but everything i ordered for him the waitress kept telling me i couldnt afford it. so i guess i couldnt afford to leave her a tip_but then again she didnt deserve one.i dont like paying for bad attitudes. i think if you work with public you should have a good attitude or quit.|`|4MxCAm6gaa	I tip universally 20 to 25% for good service. Lousy service requires about 18 cents|`|qbzBrJbhaa	I gave negative dollars.  We ordered a pizza and it came out nasty, then a waiter never came back to refil our water or give us a check. we left a 10 dollar bill which wasn't even enough to cover the pizza and walked out.|`|731762ff5b663deba6422ffbee7b6ebcaa	Once I left a $1 tip for a table of 4 at a Chinese restaurant.      They were really rushing us, and about 40 minutes into the meal, the manager took out a microphone and made an announcement that the restaurant was closed, and all diners should leave.  (They had never told us it was near closing time when we came in).    As we were leaving the manager came up to me with the dollar bill, and said: "What? You only leave one dollar?"  I snatched it out of his hand and said: "If you're not happy with it, I'll just take it back."  We were both pretty angry, and cursed each other out.  I thing I was right to get angry, but probably wouldn't approach the situation quite the same way the next time.    I'm usually a good tipper because I have worked in restaurants before.  But I expect to at least be treated courteously.|`|ljFBfguRaa	I leave 10% for bad service|`|PxJXJKCpaa	Nothing, but then I'm a really good tipper.  What warranted it was the fact that we only got water, chips and salsa.  We never got menus or was waited on after that.  We ate the chips and left.|`|JnLoHaoAaa	I tip zero. The service was absolutely horrible, everything from no silverware, wrong food, food coming out at different times, no pre-bussing, no refills and on top of that the server was extremely rude and not very nice or polie at all|`|OLAtwLV6aa	The worse tip I ever left was a dollar on like a 30 $$ bill and I was a waitress at the time myself so you know the service was terrible it was at TGIFridays ( enough said I KNOW ) so anyway the service was terrible it was lunch we were the only people in the section and the server only came to the table once to take orders and drop off drinks I had to wave him down to get my bill after waiting for a good 20mins then while stand there to pay the bill he past me like 4 times  ( I like to hand my money to the server and not just leave it lying on the table) I could have walked out on the bill seriously! that was one of the worst tip I ever left
0JcMDnFpaa	Depends what you are in the mood for.  La fiesta is AWESOME Mexican.  There is also Stonewood Grill.  These are both in Port Orange.  In Daytona, there is a ton down International Speedway Blvd.  From Carrabbas to Outback, it's all on that road.  Another great place, if you love sushi is Ronin. It's also on the same road, just further East.

U3DK6ngEaa	OMG NOOOO!!! Vegas is the one place in the world you do not want to give your underage friend a drink!!     Most all bars anyway are 21 and up. The ones that are not are not on the strip.     There are too many under-covers there that WILL catch her drinking if she somehow does get into a club. Please don't risk it! Not only will she get a ticket for underage drinking but you will get a ticket for contributing to a minor... BLAH! You don't want to ruin you time there if you get one of those! Take someone older this year and maybe next time she can come. You won't be able to do too much parting if she goes.     If she does go, take some bottles so she can drink before you go out anywhere!    Also, this is baaadddd but I used to sneak a flask of liquor in my purse into bars, order a soda or juice, go to the bathroom and in the stall pour the alcohol in my drink. SNEAKY!!! hahaha!     Be carefull and have fun in VEGAS!!! WHOO HOOO!!|`|22a6171dbf228d985a61502855bebebfaa	She can go in, but if she sips from your drinks she's in violation of state liquor laws. Both you and she could be fined. Your friend for underage drinking and you for supplying it to her.|`|AA11397003	NO, NO  AND no
b2938a13192fed60597e4f746b8425edaa	Ruth's Chris Steakhouse
lNsr26oIaa	The Gumbo Shop is right in the heart of the quarter and has delicious Shrimp Creole and local favorites. The cups of Gumbo or Creole are large and only $5. Regular entrees start at about $8 to $21.      Napoleon House has a fantastic Muffaletta. Half serves one person and costs $6.25. You can get a 1/4 for $3.75 and add a side for next to nothing.     Bourbon House has reasonable (pricey side of reasonable) lunch entrees that are very good. This place is owned by the Brennan's. Soup is $7, Po-boys (which are delicious) are $10, entrees go from $14-$21 on the lunch menu.     Muriel's (next to St. Louis Cathedral in Jackson Square has the best Creme Brulee. The restaurant is lush and the wait-staff is wonderful. Legend has it that they have their own resident ghost too (hey...when in New Orleans...). You can split a dessert for $3 a piece and the lunch menu is not too pricey.       Enjoy your trip.|`|gjteVB2Daa	We like Jimmy Buffet's Margaritaville and across the street is a hole in the wall place that has the best po boys in N.O.  It is like a grocery store but has tables or you can take them out and dine along the river.|`|SqPVrEaCaa	mothers restaurant   galatores   Brennen's  vincents italian restaurant    too many to name|`|AA10506154	I know it's a chain, but I just have to tell you, Bubba Gump in New Orleans was not that great... I went to Bubba Gump in Hawaii and Orlando, Fl, and I love it, but the one in New Orleans did not impress me. I just want to tell you so that you won't even consider it, or get suckered in by a friend.|`|n1D90COxaa	K- Paul's, don't know the address, but check out the web site K-.Paul's.com....enjoy..|`|0d98b44d962e705484337a48e0b25b85aa	You can find many hole in the wall places in New Orleans that are good. But some of the better known ones are worth it. My favorites are   Commander's Palace, and Mr. B's.   There are also places like Rio Mar, Landry's,& Mike Anderson's  Don't forget to get your 6 pack of Dixie Beer longnecks, or try Abita Beer.|`|V3HVvdyvaa	mothers restaurant is very good and reasonable,  galatores is good  Brennen's  vincents italian restaurant  some of these are not in the quarter but they still are new orleans|`|DEev3JdHaa	po boys at mother's are yummie. i don't care for the debris add on though. there are lots of opportunities to eat oysters. cafe du monde for benigets and coffee is fab and cheap and u get to sit outdoors and soak up the atmosphere.|`|A5dZgGufaa	he asked for inexpensive.
