eFowEpbLaa	All solicited means is that they only except material that they ask for or material that is referred to them. Most labels have some sort of filteration system by which they accept demos. A "filter" would be someone like an entertainment lawyer, a proven manager, or a producer. If you want your stuff to reach the head A&R guy, get one of these people to help you. Otherwise, make as much noise as possible on your own and hope that somebody notices.

Some think his wife Courtney had him killed, others think that he killed himself because he couldn't deal with her anymore and the pressures of fame. He really just wanted to have a simple life, but she wanted all the fancy extras that come with having money. Some think he was in a severe depression and just couldn't escape. He also suffered from debilitating stomach pain (why he became a heroin addict, to deal with the pain) which could have led him to just give up.|`|aMtfWfrHaa	I believe that he was mentally unstable from being on drugs, and something to do with the music industry.|`|EYVGPTbCaa	Wow you're spoiled... or maybe not, maybe you did some one in a million thing that deserved it... maybe.

KLNLfYQeaa	they originally said they'd only pick one person then that person would pick who they wanted to be with. But since Trevor and Rebekah are the 2 finalists, who knows.     If it's Trevor, he'll have to pick whichever one he likes more, probably the one he said "I love you" to.   If Rebekah [or however] she'll obviously pick the one who her son likes, which was Vicky, leaving Rikki to be alone, or pick Trevor, if he wants her.    Honestly, none of the people were appealing to me, but if I had to choose I'd probably pick Trevor. He had an accepting [yet conservative] family and it seemed like his heart was in it more. It'll be a tough decision if he has to pick between the two.|`|7lZnHiYZaa	I think its one for each.. so they'll really be two winners.|`|AA11403695	the guys seem lame.

wvsQ9SBcaa	I take shorter showers.   Unplug devices not in use.   Use eco-friendly cleaning products  Recycle, but the people downstairs just take it.   My car does really well on gas.   I bought eco friendly shopping bags to cut back on plastic bags  I volunteer for various clean up the environment programs.   I try to car-pool as much as possible.   I try to do my laundry all at once and use the larger washers that supposedly save on energy.   I pick up my dog's poop and fling at my nasty neighbors.. jk.. but I really should.   Hrmm.. .I'm sure I do other stuff.       PS - Flush the toilet every time! LoL|`|2ieiGIhTaa	Recycle  Compost  CFL bulbs  Wash in cold  drive a Honda  Eat a Republican now and then.|`|XnCeN07Uaa	i try to smoke weed..when i can      man|`|f7qVtYfaaa	yes i do try to reduce my energy usage , like now i do not heat the house to a maximum|`|xnBbmCkCaa	Actually, no. And you know what is really messed up, is I don't care about the people that are inhabiting the earth when we die. I won't be around to see it, so what do I care. Hey, it's not my fault that everybody is polluting the ozone layer. Remember, I'm just one person, out of millions, so what difference does one person out of millions and millions make: pretty much none. That is why I don't care about "living green."

hrsyPUwTaa	Did I inspire this question with my last answer?         Answer...Yes.    Because raising a child is the most important thing you can do in life... you are responsible for their life while they are in your care.      Why should we have to have a license to fish, but not raise kids?     Question  1 on the test.... When is it okay to shake your baby?       That should eliminate 25% of the DA's out there.        To the person below me... I don't believe anyone ever said if you had kids without having a license we'd kill it. I think then it goes down a path.. get a licence or adopt your child out to a couple who is seen as fit to raise a child.  At least that is how I see it.     Drug babies with unfit parents will then have a home with a familily who will try to do what is best for them... instead of a couple of cracked out parents who lock their kid in a closet or back room so they can get high undistrubed. 6 hours later they might actually remember where their child is and that they haven't been able to eat or drink and have unrinated and/or crapped themselves... if you don't think that happens you're fooling yourself.|`|fUKWTjjiaa	so what are you a nazi? or a commie?  of course lets make abortion legal too, oh wait it is. Assholes I wish you were never born either, put yourself in their shoes as the child.|`|rwodna0waa	I think there should be some sort of screening process. You should have to pass a psych evaluation at the very least. Some people just don't need or deserve kids. Like the people that kill their kids or abuse them in other horrific ways.|`|qRtYPAUwaa	agree.  I agree with you completely.|`|MZ1c2n32aa	I do know what you mean, and I agree with you, teenagers now a days have babies at 12 or 11 and have kids and can't take care of them and then the babies they have, have a horrible life, so I agree with you some people should have a license to have kids.|`|nvydVWPnaa	no, because babies are not considered objects or something that you gain  a liscence would mean that you are allowed to have a child  and no one can rate you on how much of a good parent you would be|`|EytUZvyiaa	You make an excellent point, but no.|`|I6Zjj15zaa	There are many people who should not procreate. We have to have a license to drive because they want us to be able to show a proficiency so we can keep others and ourselves safe. So Yes we should have a license if we want children because that proves that we have shown a proficiency in taking care of and supporting a child. Not sure if this makes total sense but here it is.|`|51dff71b1a9e764ae4aa42218cfb19d3aa	Oh man I have been saying this for years!!!!  Yes at least a vetting format of some kind, save a lot of bother in the long run, such a  good idea|`|bEqBVsbsaa	I think they should.  You can pop out as many kids as you want, but you can't  guarantee that the parents will take care of the kids.|`|AA11609168	no.....nazi.   It sounds to me like you do not like freedom.....|`|3MDKEQgEaa	NO YOU SHOULD NOT HAVE A LICENSE! seriously!

Government is nosey anyway! I don't like them! -_-|`|Kj8J3clpaa	yes u should. or abortion should be illegal, that will deter people|`|kzkrll3Xaa	yes, otherwise contraception should be enforced.|`|KuPJO5B1aa	In china yes|`|AA10269742	i agree|`|nEBDfgCOaa	isnt that what social security numbers are for

4Xt5aNoGaa	I've been a Blue October fan for many years now. Justin Furstenfeld (lead singer) has inspired me in terms of writing music and the ability to express myself through writing.     I've also seen Blue October multiple times live. In my opinion they are the number one band for live music and performance. An example/sample of this would be there "Argue with a Tree" CD/DVD, this is 2+ hours of pure genius. If you haven't, I'd check that out as soon as possible.     As far as my favorite song, I couldn't possibly limit it to one song. I personally prefer their older material, but all of their songs are pure genius in my eyes. My favorites would have to include: "Black Orchid", "The 21st", "Tomorrow", "Sweet and Somber Pigeon Wings", "HRSA", "Drop", "Schizophrenia", "Conversations via Radio (Do You Ever Wonder)", "Quiet Mind", "Come in Closer", "Amazing", "Let it Go", and "Kangaroo Cry."|`|K4Nt8kZPaa	They're pretty good...I like the song "Hate Me"|`|9AAGosuiaa	great answer Miles!!!    Righteous selection, LOVED hearing them at the Cafe :)  glad you posted them today  another terrific share miss Sabby  Thanks for sharing and for getting another song stuck inside these ears...|`|e53807be9e34b50fae02ba7c73274c6baa	I really like them and am surprised they never got the respect they deserve.     "Into the Ocean" is my favorite song by them.|`|DaH0rOghaa	I do love them there song Into The Ocean is my favorite I'm just a normal boy  That sank when I fell overboard  My ship would leave the country  But I'd rather swim ashore   I love that part|`|DbtS5jzEaa	WOW!!    I LOVE Blue October!!    They are one of my favorite bands...seriously! They have an honest about them that is hard to find in many bands....as Justin (lead Singer) is a recovering alcoholic/drug addict and has Bipolar, his lyrics blow me away whenever I hear them    My favorite song is Hate Me.....it's such a true song and I for one can relate to it in many ways in which I shouldn't be able to.    they blow me AWAY thanks for mentioning them Sabrina :)|`|ab1c9b81d36c3691f0d575d773009489aa	I like Blue October...they're really good and original.     favorite song... "Into the Ocean"|`|ETFaQiTzaa	:)  I told you I'd answer!    I really like them.  I wouldn't say I'm familiar enough to love them, but I really do like them.  Their lyrics can be so depressing, though.  And just the idea behind "Hate Me"--of a mother finding her son overdosing, hits me hard.    My favorite song they sing is:  "The Answer."    "I have this post-dramatic thing, I've got this tattoo of a ring..."    And I heard "Calling You" for the first time last night.  It was great!|`|cUjcn2lsaa	They're not bad, honestly! :D|`|ePEu6hMxaa	they're oohk,i have theyre CD and my favorite song is X Amount Of Words..|`|CRuxWsi0aa	They kinda have a bad rep but I really like them. My favorite songs of theirs are Hate Me and Ugly Side.|`|GHeqcovHaa	I love them, too! Just listening to their music makes me feel so calm! Lol. My favorite song is also "Calling You," also. And I love "Hate Me" and "Into the Ocean" They rock!|`|YbmklSzGaa	I LOVE Blue October.    Favorite song by them: Into The Ocean|`|wLxmn2xtaa	Oo, I really liked what I heard! My favorite song was "Into the Ocean." I like the vocals a lot and the soft, sporadic string part fit so well. Excellent stuff, thank you! And they are from my state, cool. Thanks for sharing :D|`|chlGzFQlaa	My favourite is Hate Me because thats pretty much the only single of theirs I've heard. They are an excellent band though from what I've heard, and I'll probably get an album of theirs during the weekend.|`|kPcdvW4paa	i only have one song on my ipod. its hate me and i don't really listen to it anymore|`|d00cGs5raa	They're not bad.  I'm not a crack head about them, but they're alright.  They have a few songs that I like.  I like the song Overweight and Into the Ocean.  Those are my favorite songs.  However, Hate Me has a whole phone tape kind of thing at the beginning and end where they keep on saying my name (Justin), so it's kind of cool listening to it cause it's like she left her message on my answering machine.
AaVK8HeCaa	That was pretty awesome!!!  You didn't even have to tell me what tune it went to, the tune just poured out from the words...  The only thing that I thought was wrong with it was the second to last line of the first verse...  "I'd like to fly" sounds to me like a nerd sniffling,"I would so very much like to fly, indeed," or something.  Try "I wanna get out and fly" or something along those lines.

y8WBcehmaa	it's beyond competitive, but journalism is what you'd need, and you might want to minor in something like marketing or advertising to give yourself an advantage. But I feel i should warn you that journalists and magazines are not doing well in today's economy. They are being laid off by the 100s, so you might want to pursue a career that is more stable.|`|LgvkgsOtaa	Journalism major, you can get internships like she did.|`|aN6Ftkqlaa	you should definitely major in journalism and probably minor in fashion history ! =D Devil Wears Prada is my favorite movie!!|`|hLswVIG5aa	I have a friend with that same dream!!

1kfTm6Svaa	Get an electric, its alot easier to learn on than an acoustic. Also get an amp that has distortion on it, because those are the coolest kind. In the way of guitar brands i would reccomend a bc rich. They're cheap, they sound greay and they look really cool. The other things you'll need are a chromatic tuner and a cord for your amp. And also a case if you want to take your guitar places. Traveling without one is a bad idea. If you have more questions you can ask me again.    ps a good guitar tab site (a tab is like sheet music in case you didn't know) is ultimate-guitar.com    hopefully this will help!!!|`|l0QxY4pKaa	For the first timer the ideal guitar to buy is a second hand acoustic guitar. The reason I say this is     The lower cost  You are not that concerned with the sound quality just yet  You will be assaulting you guitar and learning through your mistakes. Best to make them on a second hand guitar.    If you decide start your musical journey on an Electric guitar you will have to shell out for an electric Guitar, electric leads and Amplifier. If you also need guitar effects like distortion, delay you will also have to invest in a processor.     A good started kit would be the Fender Squire and a Marshall 10/15W Amp for practice purposes.    Depending on the path you choose you should buy   1. Acoustic Guitar, Set of Strings, Set of Plectrums    2. Electric Guitar, Amplifier, 1 Lead, Set of Strings, Set of Plectrums,     3. Electric Guitar, Amplifier, Processor, 2 Leads, Set of Strings, Set of Plectrums    You can buy a standard size acoustic guitar if you are not a kid. The size of the sound box will determine the quality and volume of the acoustic guitar.    Hope this helps!  Check out this site it will be of great help to you   http://www.4guysformusic.com  (Check the Music Tutorial)|`|Gdcy9CeSaa	It doesnt matter what kind of guitar you get at first.  Electric and acoustic are just about the same. One is cheaper, but thats your choice. Just dont get confused with bass guitars.  Those are totally different than electrics.  As for amps, since your just starting, I would go out and buy some expensive Line-6 amp.  I've been playing for 3 years and i've used the same small 12x12 inch amp.  Sounds good.    And when you start to get better you don't need a new guitar for a better sound.  It's all in the amp.  You CAN buy better pickups for a better sound, but its mostly in the amp.|`|5j3Eetmyaa	Wow.we are alike. I started playing violin first. I am a 14 year old 2 yr guitarist. Get an electric guitar. U can add distortion and mess around to play hard rock and other stuff. Get something nice like Ibanez, Kramer, Gibson, or Fender. Any amp is good for starters. Just a small travel one.( You can travel easily with it. Get a learning book. Good luck! email me 4 any other guitar help.    P.S.- Later on get an acoustic. (for clean playing) mostly for chords. Think country.
8r1J0CfGaa	NO!!! or i sure hope not lol.. I am pretty sure they did not but ask ur friend where they got the info from cuz they are most likely lying!    hahah paramore rocks, hope i helped and best wishes:)?|`|aZBypUl0aa	NO they didnt trust me im seeing them in concert this summer|`|eXabXMVnaa	we can only hope....|`|Ibj8FjfRaa	No.|`|R0Whhjo0aa	i hope not|`|Ak9ialJmaa	Of course not!|`|J30kfJpQaa	I really hope so, because I'm tired of lame bands I don't care about.|`|7lZnHiYZaa	No they did not.

Rn73EbWoaa	Sadly no (I know it was the worst anime ending ever) but hte manga continues and the anime as 4 continuation movies XP|`|8a65aa558e9ad4329fd6cecf8635eb04aa	doubt it. there's just too many more episodes after that in the manga to make. there's a total of 56 volumes for the manga and it just finished a year ago i believe. 56 books= a whole lot of anime since each ep is only based on 1 chap.    it's a bad ending for the anime. but a good one for the manga. :D|`|7b5Wt862aa	no. the series ended rather abruptly because the audience was losing interest. there are, however, 4 other movies (that are side stories and don't have much to do with the main plot line) and an OVA that recently came out as a tribute to the completion of the manga series. there have been many rumors circling around about a 5th movie or a new season, but they're mostly just fan rumors. there has been no official news for continuing the series. if you're really unhappy with the ending, you can try reading the manga. it's already completed, so you don't need to worry about a bad ending.    for more info. on the OVA go to: http://myanimelist.net/anime.php?id=4886  http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/news/200...    for more info. on the manga or any of the movies go to myanimelist.net and animenewsnetwork.com    sorry to be the bearer of bad news.  hope this helps. good luck!!|`|FK0Lc696aa	No, the series ends at 167 eps.   There is a 85% chance of there never being a continuation.     The manga series continues from where the anime left off, though.|`|Wy0lUjP9aa	There are rumors that they are. Considering the fact the only reason why they stopped making the anime was because it was catching up with the manga. The manga just ended last year so they should be continuing the anime. I hope so. But we will have to wait a while because they still have to make it and then it will come out in Japan before it comes out here in America.
FK0Lc696aa	Because it's cute.   It's funny, and yet not stupidly so.   It has drama, but not overbearingly so.   I love how it's a romance series, and yet it's not overly sappy or fluffy.   Each character has a trait about them that I love. They're just so intriguing.  Also, it has a rather interesting plot. Things just pop out at you sometimes, that just makes you take a step back.   Kinda like a mystery.    I like the manga better, but there are some scenes in the anime that weren't in the manga, that are just too funny!     I started reading the series for Yuki, but then I fell for Kyo in the end. Now, I think I like Yuki more.     Takeru is a personal fave of mine, as well as Hana and Uo, Haru, and Momiji.     I love Aya, as well. And Tohru is just cute!     Pervy, funny Shigure is a blast, and Mio is just hilarious!     I also like Hiro. What? He represents the year of the lamb, and I'M the lamb |`|FopmkZGAaa	It's cut, I prefer the manga though.    I LOVE the cat dude.|`|6FPpkmi6aa	I love this show because it was heartwarming. It had romance, comedy, and a little action in the manga here and there. I think it was cute, and that Tohru should be with Yuki. Although Kyo is in love with her, he should be with Kagura.     Then again, everyone loves Tohru! But the characters are so cute. Mt favorite is Momiji. He's just a ball of cuteness and hotness in the manga. It's so adorable how he talks and walks and everything! He's so adorable.    I also like Yuki! He has purple hair, and I love purple. I also think he has a sad past, getting abused by that stupid b**** Akito. How could he/she hurt Yuki?!    *~That's my opinion! ~AnimeLover101  ^.^|`|yacLHWqEaa	its funny and cute i only watch it in japanese and with english subs  my favorite character is.... i dont remeber the characters cuz i havent watched this in 2 years its either the girl who likes the mouse dude or the girl who likes that cat dude lol

tx24llZAaa	ok, ya, there long. but their funny:    THE WEDDING TEST       I was a very happy man. My wonderful girlfriend     and I had been dating for over a year, and so we     decided to get married. There was only one     little thing bothering me...It was her beautiful     younger sister.       My prospective sister-in-law was twenty-two, wore very     tight miniskirts, and generally was bra-less. She     would regularly bend down when she was near     me, and I always got more than a nice view. It had to     be deliberate. Because she never did it when she was     near anyone else.       One day her "little" sister called and asked me to     come over to check the wedding invitations. She was     alone when I arrived, and she whispered to me that she     had feelings and desires for me that she couldn't     overcome. She told me that she wanted me just once     before I got married and committed my life to her sister.       Well, I was in total shock, and couldn't say a word.       She said, "I'm going upstairs to my bedroom, and if     you want one last wild fling, just come up and get me."       I was stunned and frozen in shock as I watched her go     up the stairs. I stood there for a moment, then turned     and made a beeline straight to the front door. I     opened the door, and headed straight towards my car.     Lo and behold, my entire future family was standing     outside, all clapping!         With tears in his eyes, my father-in-law hugged me and     said, "We are very happy that you have passed our     little test. We couldn't ask for a better     man for our daughter. Welcome to the family."       And the moral of this story is:     Always keep your condoms in your car.    A little girl and her mother were out and about.     Out of the blue, the girl asked her mother, "Mommy, How old are you?"     The mother responded, "Honey, women don't talk about their age. You'll learn this as you get older."     The girl then asked, "Mommy, how much do you weigh?"     Her mother responded again, "That's another thing women don't talk about. You'll learn this, too, as you grow up."     The girl, still wanting to know about her mother, then fired off another question, "Mommy, why did you and Daddy get a divorce?"     The mother, a little annoyed by the questions, responded, "Honey, that is a subject that hurts me very much, and I don't want to talk about it now."     The little girl, frustrated, sulked until she was dropped off at a friend's house to play. She consulted with her girlfriend about her and her mother's conversation.     The girlfriend said, "All you have to do is sneak a look at your mother's driver's license. It's just a like a report card from school. It tells you everything."     Later, the little girl and her mother were out and about again.     The little girl started off with, "Mommy, Mommy, I know how old you are. I know how old you are. You're 32 years old."     The mother was very shocked. She asked, "Sweetheart, how do you know that?"     The little girl shrugged and said, "I just know. And I know how much you weigh. You weigh 130 pounds."     "Where did you learn that?"     The little girl said, "I just know. And I know why you and Daddy got a divorce. You got an 'F' in sex."|`|FvHsrBvAaa	How do Chinese People get their children names ?

A billion is a difficult number to comprehend, but an advertising agency did a good job of putting that figure in perspective in one of its releases:    A billion seconds ago, it was 1959.    A billion minutes ago, Jesus was alive.    A billion hours ago, our ancestors were living in the Stone Age.    And....

xD8KEjSfaa	Well, Raven quit.Also, the cast have grown too old in my opinion, Raven would be in university and wouldn't be in the show much - so it wouldn't be 'That's so raven' also, the show would be stupid if Eddie, Chelsea and Raven all got accepted to the same university.  Also, Corey would be a bit old as well, wouldn't he? I mean, there would probably be no fun if he was a high schooler not up to any mischief. Anyway, they've moved on to Corey in the house so it's all good for some, and bad for others.|`|dgJ4LQG6aa	She got to old, so they did the spinoff Cory in the House which is such a horrible show lol. Thats So Raven is actually on right now EST|`|yB3Jek85aa	the reason is that her show wasn't getting enough rating so they had to drop it and her merchandise was not getting bought and they were losing money by keeping her on there because if thy dint make money then they pay her they wont have money so that is the reason and they found a new Disney kid and that's the one and only hanna montana/ mily cyrus|`|W2qyu5zFaa	Either the main character quit and moved on to something else or the ratings weren't high enough. That's what usually happens.|`|Fyt9JxTqaa	Uh, because the series ended?|`|H0LPCjIRaa	The show had over 100 episodes, and Disney likes cancelling them earlier than that since they get kind of old. Maybe Raven was just ready to move on. Either that or they just wanted to start Cory in the House sooner.|`|LaPFzZbKaa	as kids grow up they start get borring of little kids things and so raven moves on...|`|KPToytdTaa	Because Raven wanted to move on and instead they came up with 'Cory In The House', which in my opinion is terrible acting and humor. 'That's So Raven' was so much better.|`|fINOXlXLaa	the show was probably pushed out by shows that were even less funny. i mean, that's how disney works isn't it?|`|hmXwGhBLaa	Well Raven and all of the other cast members have started new things and have been doing new stuff, and they just dont have time anymore.

7256a722eea2412efb7f021f7774652daa	You're right. You should be entitled to either a refund or an alternative magazine of your choice. When you paid for your subscription you entered into a contract with the publisher who promised to supply you with the magazine.    Subscribers to CosmoGirl should have been offered the opportunity to switch to Seventeen, which is published by the same company. I would suggest you contact CosmoGirl Customer Service if you haven't heard anything.    CosmoGirl Customer Service telephone number is 800-827-3221    Address is:  CosmoGirl, PO Box 7186, Red Oak, IA, 51591.    I hope this information helps. Good luck.|`|ZjM0ghSnaa	yea, thank God my subscription ended 2 months ago. I always thought of that, if you would get your money back. they probably will.    when my sister first subscribed to ellegirl, she got 2 issues and it got cancelled. she got a letter sent and they gave her cosmogirls. you'll probably get your money back, or another subscription to a magazine. maybe teen vogue or seventeen?? dont worry, im sure they wont rip you off or anything|`|JfVxCDb7aa	It's not fair. Call their 1 800   up and ask them to send you the regular Cosmopolitan. I have lost money this way too. I paid for 3 years of "Spy" magazine and I gopt 2 copies and they went out of business.

Lil Wayne is a joke.|`|jBiL4F8yaa	Lil Wayne writes his own songs with the help of other artists. He is not the only rapper that does this. Need proof? Take Eminem for example, a respectable song writers. If you type any of his album names on Wikipedia, the track list will show up, along with the additional writers. A dude named Resto helped him on the song soldier along with many other songs on the cd, but you dont see him coming out saying "I am Eminems Ghostwriter!" because hes not. The only reason people became skeptical of wayne writing his own songs was because Gillie, the Resto of Cash Money, decided to to say "I wrote waynes songs" and he hasnt moved from the postion he was in 2006. Lil Wayne writes his own songs, and if someone else did they would be more famous then him. Gillie tried to convince everyone he wrote the carter 1 and 2. No doubt they were friends, he on the go DJ video, but he was never a ghostwriter he just assisted wayne on a few songs. Just click the links and look at the writers. If people can seriously believe Wayne doesn't write his own raps, then all the other so called "real" rappers don't either. Jay-Z also has additional writers. People need to open their eyes and stop listening to everyone else assuming Wayne is fake because hes good at what he does.

I didn't know her but I went to the wedding because they are fun and I thought she was a bridesmaid at first. It was an ugly dress too. And her bridesmaids were wearing silver sparkly dresses. It was a winter wedding and I think she thought it was pretty but I think a bride should always wear a white dress.    And a groom and his groomsmen should just have clean nice looking hair.

irSBrZiQaa	I have always been a huge fan of Dusty and now I see myself disliking him more and more. I never thought that I would have a bad thing to say about Dusty's character, but he acts like his S*** does not stink. When they brought him back I was so excited and now they have ruined his character for me. I personally don't think that they will be getting rid of Grayson anytime soon. Considering they forked out a lot of money to bring him back. I am not the biggest fan of Paul either, but I see where your coming from because I feel sorry for him too. Dusty of all people knows what it feels like to have a child taken from you, so why he is doing that to Paul is beyond me. Dusty in my opinion is acting just as crazy as Paul. I can not believe that he guilt-ed Meg that way, but yet he is supposed to be better then Paul. I would expect that from Paul, but not Dusty. I think that Dusty is so wrapped up in hate that he is to blind to see what he is doing to Johnny, Meg, and Josie. He is hurting everyone just to prove that he is right. I understand that he made a promise to Jeniffer, but seriously I think she would be upset by Dusty's actions.    I personally like him better with Josie. Meg and Dusty have more of a friendship bond and to see them married is kind of way out in left field. Meg should not have Dusty meddling in Eliza and Paul's visits in my opinion. She knows the problems that those two have and to put that poor baby in the middle of those two is crazy! If Meg truly wants Paul to have visitation then she should find someone else. This is going to blow up in Dusty's face, I just have a feeling that he has gone too far. Besides they need to listen to what Johnny wants, that poor child has been through the ringer his whole life. What happened to strong independent Meg? She just let's everyone make decisions for her, she never used to be that way.    All in all I agree with you that Dusty needs to stop patronizing everyone, as if he is perfect "please". I just hope that when this is all over with Dusty comes back to his senses and starts acting like the Dusty that I have loved for years.|`|2f3f9068d7f4d4acd330c2510f225b40aa	If I was only hearing about how Craig was by watching the show now, instead of a year + ago I would say that I dont like Dusty anymore too. However, as bad as I feel for Paul, I dont like him any less than I like Dusty. I know that's not saying much for some of you.    I think Dusty is and always will try to be someone's knight-in-shining-armor. Just look at how fast he's dumped Emily, Josie, and Lily. He targeted Meg as going through a tough time now and thought they could benefit from each other. I think he's taken it a bit far, but its a soap. :)    I think the whole Dusty-Paul-Meg triangle will simmer down soon.    Personally I hope Craig gets Johnny, just because I think that's a better story than Dusty getting him. I think they're slowly making Dusty in to the bad guy that Craig and James were.|`|EWN5Gy2vaa	I thought it was a good idea when I heard they were going to bring him back but what he is doing is aweful. I can't believe Meg did something so stupid, she was suppose to be nice. I don't like Paul that much but I think Meg really loves him and I don't think she is going to be happily married to anyone but him. It seems Paul does bad things she can't forgive him but when Dusty does it she does. I thought Dusty and Josie made a nice couple.|`|d4109476284b20a63738efbdf6f0a052aa	I don't know if I agree with you.  Dusty is desperate to keep Johnny and keep Craig away.  Now I don't really think Meg did the right thing by marrying him, she does have too much baggage to help Dusty.    Who knows how this will all play out... Its fun to watch..=D|`|18951c19cb263b7295e454c551036a90aa	I really dislike Dusty, Paul annoys me and Meg is the most annoying of them all. The woman has fart for brains and is so whiny.|`|a1Ngi39Xaa	Dusty is really bad and it all hit the fan on today's show.  Paul burst into the courtroom and told the judge that the marriage to Meg was a farce.  So Dusty's plan backfired on him and the judge gave custody to Craig!|`|Ukgl64pSaa	It is a soap opera - cannot stand Paul|`|yNfZO1I8aa	I really hate Dusty. Honestly, I can't stand this character-he is almost worse than Paul (and that says a ton!). Although I do have to say that Roger and Grayson are talented, my views of both of the characters have been ruined. Dusty needs to grow up and stop being so self-righteous. He was a jerk to Emily the other day and has really hurt Josie. He doesn't care about anyone but himself; that's why I am rooting for Craig to get Johnny. Dusty is no better than Paul. How can he stay there and preach to Paul, especially after HE went through the SAME exact thing. Hypocrite...    Meg can do way better! But I love the tension between Meg/Holden right now. Fantastic.    I highly doubt that they are going to get rid of Grayson McCouch (Dusty). They spent a lot of money getting him back, along with James Stenbeck, and it would be a bad move to get rid of him. As much as I can't stand him, it would be a bad decision to fire him or let him go-there are a ton of storylines that can form revolving around him.|`|arjB50zBaa	I completely agree with you.  I have also been wondering the same thing, but I read an article that Grayson (Dusty) signed a lengthly contact with the show.  So I dont think he is leaving.  I used to LUV Dusty put I find that I cant stand him now.

I felt bad for him since he was the last one left in his family. And he also never complained about being with Oro, although I'm pretty sure that he would loved to have left that place. It was sad that he had a disease and died and the last moment of battle, he had a great heart used by the wrong person.  :(    *~DeathNote  ~Near  *I liked L, but after he died I was in denial. I couldn't believe it, it was like the show was pointless without him. I was so close to killing a Light coplaye rone time, thaat's how mad I was. But then Near came, and he resembled L so much.

T64RZp9oaa	This one is one of my favorites, but you HAVE to say the riddle verbally or the answer will be obvious.    Two men are in a hot dog eating contest. The first guy eats ninety-nine hot dogs, and the second guy eats one hundred and won [verbally: one hundred and one; 101]. How many hot dogs were eaten between the two contestants all together?    Answer: 199    Edit: Arielle K, I was just saying how it would sound if you were saying it verbally. If you're saying the riddle to someone, you wouldn't actually say what you're supposed to be saying, that's for them to figure out.|`|tx24llZAaa	I can do the foot and 6 thingy!!!!!  does that mean I'm a genius? ;)|`|napgiSmXaa	Alright Shelby hows tricks?

FK0Lc696aa	Inuyasha Movies In English Dub:   http://www.anime4f.com/2007/07/inuyasha....    I would advise watching all the movies after the first season, but there isn't really a necessary order that you should watch them in (well, aside from movie 1, 2, 3 and 4), but I mean relating the series.     The movies really don't have much to do with the development of the anime series. They're there own episodes, kind of.     The only thing I would personally suggest would be watching the third movie after you've seen the second  season, since you you should acquaint yourself with Sesshomaru, first.|`|yacLHWqEaa	i recommend it in english sub cuz english dub is soo gay ppl who r saying the words for the characters cant even do it for english dub or say the japanese names right|`|7b5Wt862aa	there are four inuyasha movies total, and all four of them have been dubbed in english. the movies aren't actually related to the main plot line (the stories weren't in the manga at all), so they really could be watched whenever and they'll still make sense. there may be a few characters or new attacks inuyasha might have that might be in the movie that could make it a bit confusing, but it doesn't really matter when you watch them. if you aren't worried about possibly meeting new characters or seeing new attacks, you won't have to worry about spoilers in the movies. it's more about personal preference. i, personally, watched all four movies after i finished the anime, but some people like to watch the movies as they go through the anime.    if you'd like to watch the series with the movies in chronological order, here's the list:  Movie 1 comes after episode 055 (season 2)  Inuyasha: Love that Transcends Time/Toki wo Koeru Omoi 12-22- 2001    Movie 2 comes after episode 095 (season 4)  InuYasha: The Castle Beyond the Looking Glass/Kagami no Naka no Mugenjo  12-21-2002    Movie 3 comes after episode 136 (Season 6)  InuYasha: Tenka Hadou no Ken (The Sword of World Conquest  12-25-2003    Movie 4 comes after episode 167 which was the finally of the series.  InuYasha: Crimson Fire Horai Island/Guren no Hraijima  12-23-2004    movie summaries:  1. affections touching across time- http://myanimelist.net/anime/451/Inu_Yas...  http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/encyclop...  2. the castle beyond the looking glass- http://myanimelist.net/anime/450/Inu_Yas...  http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/encyclop...  3. swords of an honorable ruler- http://myanimelist.net/anime/451/Inu_Yas...  http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/encyclop...  4: http://myanimelist.net/anime/449/Inu_Yas...  http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/encyclop...    hope this helps. good luck!!|`|8a65aa558e9ad4329fd6cecf8635eb04aa	I believe it was the 2nd InuYasha movie, The Castle Beyond the Looking Glass .

zILwtO22aa	I thought a candle burned shorter the longer it was lit, and can bees really wax?  Also there's no wick in a lump of beeswax.  But that's just me :)|`|tx24llZAaa	none of your bees wax!|`|YKDhstvkaa	it depends on their size|`|AA11905223	questions with variables missing doth not a riddle make.|`|jthpq6Egaa	Well, considering that a candle has a wick that you can light and, last I checked, beeswax cannot be set on fire...then I would have to say that a candle burns infinitely more since beeswax does not burn.    But if you're comparing a normal (paraffin) candle with a beeswax candle, then the answer is beeswax.  Beeswax candles burn essentially soot free and a higher temperature than paraffin candles, which means that the beeswax candle, though more expensive, lasts much, much longer.|`|RU1QZXUHaa	Candles burn shorter not longer.|`|svzPMz2Maa	That is impossible to answer!|`|4TMbLb1Daa	candles dnt burn the wicks do!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

XyKnvoypaa	When L died...I'm not kidding you, I seriously cryed..it was that sad!  But anyway, after that scene, I believe the anime kept going on strong. I mean, with Near and Mello competing against each other and Kira STILL trying to 'change' the world into something better makes it still worth watching! Plus I totally agree with you on L's death making it more interesting. If I had watched Death Note without knowing anything about it and that episode came I would be totally taken by surprise!|`|hvJQSUOQaa	For a while I thought it slacked, but I got back into it after a few volumes.  I liked L a lot more than Mello or Near.    By the way, it's really not nice to post spoilers. Someone might be reading death note and see that before they've gotten that far.|`|Q3eeNw4xaa	Yes, it was incredible the whole way through.|`|7rzWFt91aa	yeah, I thought it sucked that they spent a bit more detailing watari's death then L's, but I kinda like Near (that's the little white haired boys name right?) I've only just gotten to that point in the series though|`|ej6sCfl6aa	I thought that episode of Death Note was the most depressing episode in the show. Even though it hurt, I did think it was a good move in the series. It definitely made it very interesting and kept with the style and feel of the show. I think after he died some of the new characters and new storyline just sucked to be honest. I also think it should've ended around 30-32, but it dragged on way too long. I did love how Light got caught in the end though. He started as my favorite character, but as I got to know L, I started to love him even more so I'm glad L won. He may have died, but he still obtained justice and won the battle.|`|Rn73EbWoaa	Yeah but it still wasn't AS great without him....|`|gzxjcVURaa	I thought L dying was wrong but It helped move the story along. I did think it was smart how Light got Rem to do it and ultimately kill herself thus eliminating one of his more difficult threats. I have a better question how come the anal retentive Megami not check his Death Note before coming to the big Finale end meeting. I mean Light made him use the Death Note everyday, why is it on that important moment did he not check it. It would have changed the ending if he had just bothered to whip it out and use it. I loved Death Note but I got to admit I think that ending just bothers me...|`|vWSNi8boaa	L's death was a major turning point in Death Note. In fact, some DN fans stopped watching Death Note because of L's death! D:    Even though I was actually...really, REALLY sad, I thought that it was a step further in Light's plan... I mean, it had to happen at some point, right? And I agree. L's death DID keep it interesting, because now you knew that the Task Force had even more reason to catch Kira, thus having more determination and putting more effort into it. So really, L's death is part of the reason how Light *SPOILER WARNING*              got found out by Near, and died! And people actually sacrificed their lives to catch him (like Mello, Matt, Soichirou, etc),but L especially.    So I think that if L hadn't died, Death Note definitely would have been a little repetitive. Everything would just go on like this:   L would keep suspecting Light anyway, and Light would keep on doing his Kira thing, completely discreetly. Then in the end, L would finally find out about Misa, and Light being Kira, then tell the Task Force about how he knew he was Kira all along. Even Soichirou Yagami still could've been there... ):  But still, I think that Death Note was awesome, completely worth watching, and a great run! :)|`|jiSMcjQ8aa	I cried.  Didn't everyone? (if you didn't, then you probably have no soul.)  It made Death Note even more interesting though, for some reason.  I love the Mello and Near arc, probably because Kira loses :) And I think Death Note should have been longer, personally.|`|vqg6wpCLaa	Well, I still thought it was awesome but I found that it got boring for a bit. There wasn't much going on (in the manga) until Soichiro died and it really got interesting again. I blame that on Light's drop of intelligence though (that's the only thing that really bothered me). If it had ended after L died, there would be no closure and it would have been a terrible ending.   RIP L (and Watari!)|`|3N2ElzcQaa	I agree.     If the anime ended at 26, and the manga ended at vol. 7, it would be disappointing.    I thought L's death was very sad.|`|aOxwt667aa	yeah i agree with you.

I don't really like him, neither his voice. And the song isn't really "Rock"... just because it has a guitar in it doesn't make it Rock... And the riff is sort of meh. It doesn't even have a solo. And the lyrics aren't really good in my opinion. I would say it sounds as if someone would have made a "Guitar Remix" of a rap song...|`|hXaAxd1Gaa	??????????????????????|`|kTNz1VJuaa	One of the great things about rock music is it's democratic characteristic.

I wish he'd leave the R word alone. Him doing this sort of thing tarnishes rock's reputation. I don't care about the auto-tune thing, his voice is atrocious with or without it. He's a talentless pop rapper that wants to be a rock star. I pity him.|`|YITNXmR6aa	No. Lil wayne sucks|`|eBu2WVAhaa	that's not good rock. that's not even rock. it's just bumble gum pop mixed with a autotune and crappy instrumentals|`|4bc3ee931fca2067bef8aafb614f2089aa	His voice is just so bad.

Taylor Swift rocks : ) she is my idol of the year : )|`|Ann2hdPJaa	America Ferrera she is confident beautiful and smart.|`|a860e9b17c0946e66c4ca331bb01f9d2aa	Natalie Portman.

zs3xMXGHaa	They need a life or to get laid|`|PKhIXkJAaa	Their aims are good, but they need more discipline to achieve them.|`|SFDCB2Xsaa	They are great!|`|l1pewZpaaa	Sometimes they go a bit overboard, but in general I think their message is important|`|ZDOfXBd2aa	Hmm... I have mixed feelings.    But that SeaKittens thing is going off the deep end.|`|Kj8J3clpaa	useless|`|S9bEtVCSaa	Animals are good. They are food.   I'm not a vegan, but I know people who are and I respect that. I just lose respect for organizations who spread hate - PETA spreads hate. They choose animal life over human life and I can't respect that.|`|AA11609168	i think many people have good intentions there but a few people are extremist and do the organization no good at all.      I lost a ton of respect for PETA after the came out blaming the jockey for Eight Belles being put down.  They were completely wrong and did nothing but smear the Jockeys name calling him a murderer -  that was out of control|`|k84e5BY0aa	They go too far sometimes|`|x8IaNyVfaa	evi;l|`|v63fzW0maa	http://narang.com/images/instructions/do...|`|Yc9uPziVaa	two words:    "sea kittens"|`|aqLDMy2Maa	very extreme and border lining on terrorism.  Their intentions are mostly good, but they have a good amount of flaws.  their beliefs are very short sighted and it seems as they believe there way is the only way and that gets in their way.|`|m3ThrbDMaa	Are they hiring?|`|aaQUMXUzaa	I'm 100% for humane treatment for animals, but PETA goes over the bounds. Some of there extreme activities remind me of terrorist. I'll fully support any legitimate animal protection group but not PETA.|`|n31VupXoaa	they should eat meat its really YUMMY|`|f0JL2cHEaa	I think that their cause is a decent one, but sometimes ((okay, a lot of the time)) they go too far.|`|nUkCnrA3aa	I adore them! So much that I would eat a nice slab of steak in front of them :) *I am so nice XD*  No seriously, they are irritating.  -Ryko|`|6oZagLCvaa	people eating tasty animals?    im all for it|`|D3fsk3SCaa	I think they shouldn't pour red paint on people for wearing fur.  That person payed good money for that!  And here you come with your bucket of red paint thinking that it's okay to pour a 50 dollar bucket of paint on someone's 5,000 dollar fur coat.  You can be an activist without ruining property.  I know if I poured red paint on someone's fur coat my mom would've beat my behind!|`|gNy79X6oaa	I think that some people give others a bad name.  For example, the extreme people who go around preaching the word of god and trying to convert everyone give a bad name to christians everywhere.  I am a vegetarian, and sometimes am embarrassed by the radical movements of PETA and some of its followers.  In general, it's a wonderful organization that has a beautiful mission.|`|a6mHcrgEaa	look at my display name and you'll find my answer|`|fpcxyOLraa	I totally agree with The Angry Stick Man I mean come one who in their right mind would urge to have ice cream made with breast milk as oppose to cow milk?|`|IiB6nXn5aa	I'm a member of PETA (people eating tasty animals)|`|7aisLVeiaa	I think they are annoying, because they're too obsessed with what other people do. And I don't like the fact that they're so judgmental of people who eat meat. If they want to be vegetarians or vegans, that's all fine and dandy. But I don't appreciate other people's morals being shoved down my throat.    I want to make a long video of me eating barbecue ribs, steak, bacon, chicken, beef, and all different types of meat, and send it to them just to piss them off.|`|SWJMjvLqaa	Awesome and they also have some great campaigning,    http://s260.photobucket.com/albums/ii3/E...|`|wZV2eaOmaa	I think they're insane because of their tactics. Also, I think they're hypocritical for euthanizing so many healthy dogs without trying to adopt them out, when they condemn the SPCA for doing the same thing.|`|HCL7FpTqaa	I think they are bunch of crazy extremists.  They blow everything out of proportion and do nothing but make themselves look stupid.|`|iT7PEEz5aa	naked protesters  dont get to see often, you know|`|qXq0nmBzaa	Like many groups, they started off with high ideals, got taken over by extremists, and have gotten really trashy in their moral view of the world.|`|m2CR7zEnaa	gay.  because they're gay.|`|l3ukjXK0aa	I really do not care for it....humans are naturally omnivores.....but at the same time I respect others' lifestyles|`|qok5e5haaa	They go too far just to make a point.|`|fe73dc32e71ef5846abbf8e72834c313aa	domestic terrorists|`|TTnhPnohaa	i think they have a really good vision and messaage-i wish i had the will do give up animal byproducts and meat :( sadly i was raised differently|`|CDMoNTRGaa	PETA is a hypocrit. they kill animals. I am an animal rights activist but **** PETA they're stupid *** bitches|`|XlP0G1Woaa	They suck. They love animals so much they hate people. They are animal humpers and they are married to animals. Of course they are animals themselves. I agree with cilla.|`|ffab01a92e978af828e5f1703775e5ddaa	It's good with some lettuce, a little yogurt, and some nice lamb souvlaki in it!

AA11518803	I remember him doing his "phonetic pronunciation" bit from the Electric Company, He also made an appearance on the Muppet Show. Maybe it's because my parents were the same age as my classmates' grandparents, but I grew up on old timers like Borge and Welk, and have an odd appreciation for them. Yes, Borge is corny- but he has great comic timing and he's adept at physical comedy.    Here he is at the beginning of an Electric Company song- check out the young Morgan Freeman!    http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x8yAWCh--...|`|48df0ea585c1658be36a46553408d993aa	Hey now... don't be dissin' on the Welk!

21428fc02666515c85c83d64ffb798faaa	Buy...but you can say that about any producer...or rapper...just replace the job site...    ie...If Nas' rapping wasnt so damn good...he would still be working at ____________...      Edit:  Even if Kanye didnt produce (even though thats how he got his foot in the door)...I think he still would have made it as a rapper...dude gots serious drive...and that "I dont give a uck attitude that would have gotten him somewhere in the industry...I mean if Plies can make it as a rapper...the Kanye would have made it too... I dont think Kanye would have settle for working retail his whole life...|`|aJfBtT9iaa	Sell, hes as good of a rapper as he is a producer. his producing did open up the door for him though.    Kanye worked at GAP? lol|`|IFf5r9zAaa	Sell. He's a mediocre rapper, but I doubt someone like Kanye would put up with working at Gap. He'd have found some way to make it big.|`|HL8W9yU6aa	Buy: That's all kanYe is. 11 years of producing.|`|GSOLv83Waa	Buy.. Funny thing is he samples just as much as P. Diddy. So, do they really deserve that much production credit? Or should the credit go to the original person who created the beats?|`|uZQIUeyvaa	buy- he is a great rapper, but he was discovered as a producer. I think he is the best or at least better than weezy but he got discovered as a producer.|`|a9TBcczUaa	his raps are barely average...its his production that makes him...but he does kinda have a nice flow but far as lyrics he's on/off...so its all on his production...
sz1YqwUEaa	yes.|`|4qNYNG41aa	Yes!, their still amazing, even more so because most music now days is shite.|`|7QERhhRJaa	Geat music never dies. I still remember wearing a Beatle cap and jacket and having a Beatle Burger at a restaurant. I was the first in line for the promotion. It's like Yesterday.|`|EQm2iCpaaa	I love the Beatles.

The Beatles, Beach Boys, Monkeys....all of them are great bands, especially if you are putting together a summer pool/beach party. My husband and I drove from NC to Iowa last winter, and half the trip (close to 12 hours) was nothing but those three artists!|`|S0Clu20aaa	Yeah...  ooooooo (shake head) !!!|`|6Nj5VZQ8aa	Are you kidding me~!??

How can anyone NOT GET IT what they offer to us ???|`|kTNz1VJuaa	Sometimes I have an urgent NEED to hear "Across the Universe" or "Within You Without You"    The songs I keep going back to are from the Maharishi period.

They're a timeless group which every aspiring musician of any form should admire.  I've been criticized by my friends for liking them, but I love them nonetheless.  They are not my favorite band, but I was, as my mom put it, a "Beatlemaniac" when I was younger.|`|ZDQHMlGBaa	Well i'm 19 and wasn't around when they were at their prime, but i love them.|`|XAAF7R23aa	Yes i certainly do i have most of their original lps and also a lot of singles, but must admit i like the earlier stuff best.|`|dyQNG6V8aa	Yeah I do!|`|UEzTKxwYaa	Yes, who doesnt listen to The Beatles...|`|aIS1asOjaa	Of course, they are awesome and such a big influence on bascially all of the bands around today    :)|`|96376f25de0405be98f7a52a6bd35694aa	Yes.

The Beatles music will always live on. Their music reaches into the heart and soullll.   People need to listen to The Beatles; The Beatles will open your mind, for those who don't listen to them. A lot of things can be taken from their music.

rGA5TPxeaa	I know that they are both going to be in New Moon, which is coming out in November. But my one friend who is like obsessed with Twilight said that she saw somewhere that Robert didn't want to be in the other movies, but I don't know if that is true or if it's a rumor. I think it would just ruin the movies if he didn't play Edward, he's so good at it. Hope I helped! :)|`|8a7c02df359d96db8ffa457a92b75e50aa	who cares?|`|7XM4QJiuaa	they better|`|S4pY0lBtaa	Yeah.|`|G4zzGaZ9aa	yes they signed a contract for new moon, and eclipse, but not yet for breaking dawn. But poor Robert is kind of lonely because in his contract it says he cant be in too much sunlight so he can keep his pale complexion, so he spends a lot of time in nightclubs and bars, and his family is in england so hes homesick. I read this in Life & Style magazine and you can read the whole article there becuz the issue is still in magazine stands.|`|mikRMYMVaa	OMG DUH! lol that was a dumb question.|`|UwRGE0Ghaa	Dakota Fannings is not playing Jane for sure. It's just rumored that she has auditioned and will probably take the park. Vanessa Hudgens never even auditioned. That rumor was completely false; her rep even confirmed it. It's also finally been released that Taylor Lautner will be coming back for New Moon since he gained so much muscle weight.  And yes Kristen and Rob have both already signed on to do New Moon and Eclipse (along with the rest of the main cast i.e Nikki Reed, Ashley Greene, Jackson Rathbone, Kellan Lutz, etc.). Although personally I think Kristen Stewart ruined Bella and Twilight. I wish they would replace her more then anything!  Also, for the person above, no one has signed a contract for Breaking Dawn. As of right now there is no talk of making a movie for it :'(|`|ZgNPIlWFaa	yes they just signed the final contract for breaking dawn. and i am so freakin excited!!!!!|`|7lZnHiYZaa	im pretty sure..|`|lSndJMVoaa	i think so.  they freakin BETTER!!
UwRGE0Ghaa	Some of the people above have it wrong. Dakota Fannings is not playing Jane FOR SURE. It's just rumored that she has auditioned and will PROBABLY take the park. Vanessa Hudgens never even auditioned. That rumor was completely false; her rep even confirmed it. It's also finally been released that Taylor Lautner will be coming back for New Moon since he gained so much muscle weight.  And yes Kristen and Rob have both already signed on to do New Moon and Eclipse (along with the rest of the main cast i.e Nikki Reed, Ashley Greene, Jackson Rathbone, Kellan Lutz, etc.). Although personally I think Kristen Stewart ruined Bella and Twilight. I wish they would replace her more then anything!|`|j5k0VRbPaa	yes they signed a contract to do all the movie series like daniel aka harry potter did|`|t0uIgY08aa	yeah they are|`|aEbuB8Mwaa	yes i believe so!|`|AA10742567	I think so.|`|oRAWPrRJaa	YES. did you know that dakota fanning might play jane in new moon? :D|`|Okes2LCuaa	most likely.|`|Mwb5UkPBaa	Yeah. They're the main characters.|`|nLXfeQbpaa	Robert hasn't decided but Kristen has.|`|iNufkBtJaa	yes.  and dakota fanning will be jane (volturi)    and vanessa hudgens is audiotioning for leah|`|bPiAtjV0aa	Wish they wouldn't!!!! but yes|`|t043WEDIaa	Yes! they're also keeping taylor lautner. But the rumor that vanessa hudgens will be Leah has been denied!|`|TweZlF73aa	yes. i think people would tell that all the different people who love robbert would do it personally i love bella she's smoking hot|`|apfnKPpRaa	it depends if robert, and kristen wants to or not and if they're still popular! hopefully they are though! i love twilight!!!  but...robert looks really ugly without all that vampire makeup on though! i think taylor should of played the vampire! he's so much hotter but he looks too young thought!...|`|rHlmNoYUaa	Yes, the rumor about kicking Robert off was just that: a rumor|`|clRae7E4aa	yup. they definetely are =]|`|MBC3KzCNaa	They've signed a contract to do up to eclipse. They arn't planning on making breaking dawn due to not having the technology to make certain scenes look realistic enough|`|nvydVWPnaa	yeah probably because they did so good in twilight|`|qNmUKWDCaa	You never know. It depends how many they make, and when (since actors age), if the movies can hold their audience like the books, and if they can afford to pay the actors what they will want to make 2, 3...     I did read that Dakota Fanning is in talks for the role of Jane!|`|2AH1EjGAaa	Most likely, its hard to change actors especially in movies like these. Both actors have enormous popularity and fan-base could react negatively. Besides, both are extraordinarily famous now, even if one of them seems to be hemming and hawing, in the end they are going to do it, after this series, they probably wont have another opportunity for this kind of recognition.
E047GSKdaa	They would Im eachother little snide remarks....then love the reactions.|`|jfriQ8pmaa	LOL, good question!!!!  I think they would do a lot of texting remarks too!!|`|xWqKKp0Naa	Great show .  i think he'd be oogling babes over his cell phone while pretending to work .   maddie , of course would be mad as h*ll , lol          D :)|`|MwSaCettaa	LOL--I loved that show!!!    I love Bruce Willis--********* & all!!!!    ???|`|bcf393e4db41afbc89350db8fced8a1aaa	beatle19..., no.

And, the office will be re-painted red.
tVgAZ2uQaa	I was talkin to the power company and it got pretty heated cuz they screwed somethin up on my bill.  Well, i was on the pot and I accidentally(really was an accident)  let one rip and it echoed cuz I was in the bathroom.

rcNQvCeXaa	real shock to hear this news, how sad is that. Love Lynyrd Skynyrd, got tickets to see them in Scotland in May i hope they still come but it will be a tragic loss to a band who have had their share of tragedies..

qJTInlSeaa	I think Ashley is cute, but her cocky attitude of how everyone wants to be her friend and they are all out for her attention gets on my nerves.  Yes, she is slutty to bring a dude home the first night and be doing everything except for "intercourse", which I dont believe, spells SKANK to me!!!    As far as the girls acting tough, I think the only two who have ever really been tough was Tiff and Boston, the others just follow lead.    Whitney aka "Boston" is simmering down a bit, but I'm sure by next week the way someone blinks is gonna get on her nerves and she is gonna blow up again.    I did like Season 2 a bit better, but what was a big turn off to me is how the girls were peeing in juice, sinks and furniture and putting other people's foods on their private areas, NASTY!!!    I am just waiting for this season to pick up.... I hope there is some MAJOR DRAMA that happens next week when they go to Vegas|`|pvcUDC8Xaa	I don't like Ashley's attitude. I don't think she's bad just cocky.     I think Boston is fake. I think she's just acting like she's bad on the show. Tiff is the one to watch out for. She's a little firecracker.     So far I like this season.....It's not as nasty as last season's with Jonavecia..ugh that girl was nasty|`|9d186c4d38844c8ca3dbdf7a8c956a1faa	i think season 2 was funnier and had much more drama than this season =D

paHjJrrdaa	Well, Stephano had brain washed John again.  He had him try to kill this woman named "Coleen Brady".  Long story short, he couldn't do it and the woman ended up being his mother. Johns mother had been with Stephano's father "Santo Demera" and concieved him.  So John and Stephano are brothers!!!!  Marlana has been trying to get John to regain his memory without sucess until now.  John gets his memory back just in time for the two (marlana and john) to get written off the show.    Sami was dating EJ, but ended up falling for Lucas.  EJ ended up raping Samie (Stephano's orders to produce an heir) the same night she slept with Lucas.  She ended up pregnant with twins.  The boy is for EJ and the girl is for Lucas. Their names: Johny and Ally.  Thru blackmail from the Demerias Sami divorces Lucas (yes they remairried) and married EJ.  She was mad and discusted because she really loved Lucas.  Lucas shoots EJ at the wedding ceremony.  Samie stays with EJ and he finally gets his act together and starts treating her right. Samie went to visit Lucas in jail many times, but he denied her over and over saying he wanted her to move on and be happy.  Well one time she went home crying and EJ was there to comfort her and she slept with him.  Lucas does some undercover work for the cops and gets out of jail in time to catch her in bed with EJ... he is done with her.  Samie passes out and Lucas rushes her to the hospital where he finds out she is pregnant with EJ's baby.  Only Lucas and his new love Chloe knows she is pregnant.  Samie then witnesses a murder (of the mayor) and is placed in witness protection,which she is glad because she doesn't want the Demeria's to get their filthy hands on this baby!    Karrie and Auston move to Switzerland with Will.  Billy (Bo's Ex wife, Chelsea's mom) moves to Europe for a job)  Shawn and Bell go sailing around the world with Clair.    BO had gotten some pancriadic cancer and Chelsea donated a piece of her pancreas to save him. Hope now accepts Chelsea even more. Her and Nick are on and off, but finally off.  She falls in love with her doctor that did the transplant "Dr. Jonas".  Dr. Jonas then starts cheating on her with Kate (her own grandmother!)  Then Kate breaks up with Dr. Jonas and hooks up with Chloe behind Lucas's back!  Lexie learns that Theo has autisim.  She gives up her job as chief of staff at the hospital (Kayla takes the job) and Abe quits his job as Police Commisioner (Bo takes the job) and Abe later gets the Mayor's position when his campain partner is murdered (he was previous mayor trying to get re-elected. This is the murder Sami witnessed)    Max and Stephanie have a long relationship.  Max finds out he has a sister and goes to find her in France. Her name: Melonie.  She causes trouble for them and lands them in jail over a braclet she stole. Max still "loves" her. Stephanie HATES her. He finds out Nicks professor is Trent, his real father.  Melonie later breaks up Max and Stehpanie.  Nick becomes interested in Melonie right away. Trent pimps out Melonie.  Nick falls in love with Melonie and he gets her away from the man her dad pimped her out to and gets shot in the process (in the upper arm). Nick later see's Trent in the graveyard taunting Melonie and stabs him with a knife and kills him. He then went crazy because of some pain pills and let Melonie think she killed him (since she had blacked out) Truth came out he is now in jail for a year.    Nicole ends up with EJ, they were having sex the day the Mayor was murdered in front of the Demira mansion.  Samie saw this and ran back to the front of the house and seen the murder. This is also when she became furious with EJ and tries to get over him.  Raf, her body guard in witness protection, seems to be getting really close to Samie. Nichole and Chloe became BFF's.  Brady just came back to town.  Nicole befreinded him.  She is pretending to be pregnant.  She had a miscarraige and doesn't want EJ to find out. She thinks he won't love her anymore if she isn't having his baby. She fakes the rest of the pregnancy and tries to find a baby to adopt as her own to fool EJ with. Brady tries to help her, but she got furious with him when he wouldn't lie for her to an expectant mother whom she was tring to get a baby from. Brady gives up on her and tells her to never call him again.   I think that is the main points.  I hope this helped!|`|AA12221392	Well I watch it on and off due to being laid off in the last few months but  here is kinda a recap to get you going again,   Sammy is in a witness protection, because she seen the killer who killed the mayor. She is also having ej baby but he doesnt know it - she has a child with him already, and two children with lucas  Lucas  is now with cloe, but she is having feelings for daniel (doctor that was brung in to save bo's life back from the plane crash )  Ej is with nicole (nicole use to be married to victor ) she was pregnate with ej baby but she miscarriaged and now she is faking her pregnacy. She has a teenage girl that is giving her baby to her but I think as sammy is having her baby that she is going to take sammy baby.   jon and marlena - jon memomry was taken by stephano and he is remembering things but the counsler wouldn't let him he was remembering things because she had a war against marlena - she tried killing marelna and jon came in and she ended up stabbing him with this injection. He is the hospital and they are going to get remarried. He remembers again...     That should get you back up to speed for now .....

88cENciZaa	Sherlock Holmes and Dr. Watson were going camping. They pitched their tent under the stars and went to sleep. Sometime in the middle of the night Holmes woke Watson up and said: "Watson, look up at the stars and tell me, what do you see?"    Watson replied: "I see millions and millions of stars."    Holmes said: "And what do you deduce from that?"    Watson replied: "Well, if there are millions of stars, and if even a few of those have planets, it's quite likely there are some planets like earth out there. And if there are a few planets like earth out there, there might also be life."    And Holmes said: "Watson, you idiot, it means that somebody stole our tent."|`|UBTPevNraa	1)She looks innocent she suck a dick for a diet coke.  2)President Bush is responsible for ever crime committed|`|eeHrcxjEaa	If you like stupid but funny:  --------------------------  Why did the lollipop cross the road?

EDIT:   if you think mine are the funniest, pick me for best answer! :)|`|tx24llZAaa	ok, ya, there long. but their funny:    THE WEDDING TEST       I was a very happy man. My wonderful girlfriend     and I had been dating for over a year, and so we     decided to get married. There was only one     little thing bothering me...It was her beautiful     younger sister.       My prospective sister-in-law was twenty-two, wore very     tight miniskirts, and generally was bra-less. She     would regularly bend down when she was near     me, and I always got more than a nice view. It had to     be deliberate. Because she never did it when she was     near anyone else.       One day her "little" sister called and asked me to     come over to check the wedding invitations. She was     alone when I arrived, and she whispered to me that she     had feelings and desires for me that she couldn't     overcome. She told me that she wanted me just once     before I got married and committed my life to her sister.       Well, I was in total shock, and couldn't say a word.       She said, "I'm going upstairs to my bedroom, and if     you want one last wild fling, just come up and get me."       I was stunned and frozen in shock as I watched her go     up the stairs. I stood there for a moment, then turned     and made a beeline straight to the front door. I     opened the door, and headed straight towards my car.     Lo and behold, my entire future family was standing     outside, all clapping!         With tears in his eyes, my father-in-law hugged me and     said, "We are very happy that you have passed our     little test. We couldn't ask for a better     man for our daughter. Welcome to the family."       And the moral of this story is:     Always keep your condoms in your car.    A little girl and her mother were out and about.     Out of the blue, the girl asked her mother, "Mommy, How old are you?"     The mother responded, "Honey, women don't talk about their age. You'll learn this as you get older."     The girl then asked, "Mommy, how much do you weigh?"     Her mother responded again, "That's another thing women don't talk about. You'll learn this, too, as you grow up."     The girl, still wanting to know about her mother, then fired off another question, "Mommy, why did you and Daddy get a divorce?"     The mother, a little annoyed by the questions, responded, "Honey, that is a subject that hurts me very much, and I don't want to talk about it now."     The little girl, frustrated, sulked until she was dropped off at a friend's house to play. She consulted with her girlfriend about her and her mother's conversation.     The girlfriend said, "All you have to do is sneak a look at your mother's driver's license. It's just a like a report card from school. It tells you everything."     Later, the little girl and her mother were out and about again.     The little girl started off with, "Mommy, Mommy, I know how old you are. I know how old you are. You're 32 years old."     The mother was very shocked. She asked, "Sweetheart, how do you know that?"     The little girl shrugged and said, "I just know. And I know how much you weigh. You weigh 130 pounds."     "Where did you learn that?"     The little girl said, "I just know. And I know why you and Daddy got a divorce. You got an 'F' in sex."|`|ClRuPRs7aa	1. Never before had Sue looked in the box that her husband kept under their bed.     The box had been there for the past 20 years of their marriage but she had never invaded his privacy. One day, while cleaning, she decided to take a look in the box. She didn't figure it was anything he was hiding since she could have looked at it any other time but hadn't.     In the box she found 3 eggs and 10 thousand dollars. This seemed very strange so she went to Fred and asked, "Why are there 3 eggs in a box under our bed?"     He replied, "Well, every time I was unfaithful to you, I put an egg in the box." Sue was surprised and hurt that he had been unfaithful but she consoled herself with the fact that they had been married for over 20 years and he had only been unfaithful 3 times.     "But where did the 10 thousand dollars come from?" she asked.     "Well, every time I got a dozen, I sold it."    2. A woman accompanied her husband to the doctor's office.     After his checkup, the doctor called the wife into his office alone. He said, "Your husband is suffering from a very severe stress disorder. If you don't follow my instructions carefully, your husband will surely die.     "Each morning, fix him a healthy breakfast. Be pleasant at all times. For lunch make him a nutritious meal. For dinner prepare an especially nice meal for him.     "Don't burden him with chores. Don't discuss your problems with him; it will only make his stress worse. Do not nag him. Most importantly, make love to him regularly.     "If you can do this for the next 10 months to a year, I think your husband will regain his health completely."     On the way home, the husband asked his wife, "What did the doctor say?"     "He said you're going to die," she replied.|`|Z51fjE2Raa	Why did the hedgehog cross the road?  To see his flat-mate.

a1Ngi39Xaa	I think that Neil is so firmly rooted in the show - especially now with all the family stuff going on - that he will be kept on at Newman in some capacity.      With the Brad fiasco coming up, Victor may be getting very busy and something else may start going on with Adam too.  I think Victor will see that Neil need to be back.|`|ahOBiGSzaa	So am I.  The last I heard Neil seemed interested in looking elsewhere since Nick and Vic are obviously slated to take over the company.  But where else?  Jabott?  Chancelor Industries?  Seems the only two companies around there.|`|CyVxolNHaa	he's still Victor's right hand man, for now, i guess!|`|ow1m3c8jaa	Victor told someone (Victoria I think) that he was going to take care of him well and make him an offer that would make Neil very happy, not his exact words, but you get the drift.    If you ask me, Neil should still be CEO of NE as loyal as he's been all these years to both Victor and the company, Victor had no right to just push him aside for Nick & Victoria.

The lawyer just kept bugging the blonde wanting her to play a game of intelligence. Finally, the lawyer offered her 10 to 1 odds, and said every time the blonde could not answer one of his questions, she owed him $5, but every time he could not answer hers, he'd give her $50.00. The lawyer figured he could not lose, and the blonde reluctantly accepted.     The lawyer first asked, "What is the distance between the Earth and the nearest star?"     Without saying a word the blonde handed him $5. then the blonde asked, "What goes up a hill with 3 legs and comes back down the hill with 4 legs?"     Well, the lawyer looked puzzled. He took several hours, looking up everything he could on his laptop and even placing numerous air-to-ground phone calls trying to find the answer. Finally, angry and frustrated, he gave up and paid the blonde $50.00     The blonde put the $50 into her purse without comment, but the lawyer insisted, "What is the answer to your question?"     Without saying a word, the blonde handed him $5.|`|rpAefo2kaa	What do you say to a one legged hitch hiker?

But I really recommend that don't quit the cello.|`|YSW0PVElaa	You could quite the cello in school to be with your friends BUT you could always just keep practicing at home.

He was another pill-popper and it's too bad his daughter had to suffer because of it.    *Avaa: I would hope that when I die, people don't make me out to be greater than I actually was.

He wasn't a "pill popper".  He was an amazing actor, and was suffering from depression and insomnia and took the medication at the same time.   It was an accidental death.  I was very sad when it happened, to answer your question.  He was my favorite actor.  And first poster, have some sympathy.  Go to hell.  I hope when you die someone says that about you.

676fffa1d033bd7fc45c4eae89d1f268aa	In 1929 an impoverished nine-year-old named Chiyo from a fishing village is sold to a geisha house in Kyoto's Gion district and subjected to cruel treatment from the owners and the head geisha Hatsumomo. Her stunning beauty attracts the vindictive jealousy of Hatsumomo, until she is rescued by and taken under the wing of Hatsumomo's bitter rival, Mameha. Under Mameha's mentorship, Chiyo becomes the geisha named Sayuri, trained in all the artistic and social skills a geisha must master in order to survive in her society. As a renowned geisha she enters a society of wealth, privilege, and political intrigue. As World War II looms Japan and the geisha's world are forever changed by the onslaught of history    A young nine year old girl, Chiyo, lives in a rather poor fishing village, Yoroido, on Japan's coast. Along with her older sister, Satsu, she is sent to the geisha (Japanese for artisan) district called Gion. Split from the only family she has left Chiyo is sent to the Nitta Okiya while her sister is transported else where and becomes less of a role. And Okiya is a house (sort of a compound) where a geisha lives and is taken care of. Here at the Nitta Okiya Chiyo meets another girl about her age nicknamed Pumpkin. Together Pumpkin and Chiyo struggle through the daily life of being treated as nothing more than slaves to the resident geisha, Hatsumomo. Hatsumomo, the story's resident villain, tries her hardest to make Chiyo's life as miserable as possible. On one particular occasion Chiyo feeling so depressed collapses on a bridge in tears over her life's woes. Much to her surprise a high society passer by stops to question why she is so sad. Here little Chiyo meets The Chairman for the first time. He shows her kindness in a world which has been naught but cruel to her and from that point on Chiyo makes it her goal to break free from the social class she was born into and become a geisha worthy of The Chairman|`|lBZkXzr0aa	Based on Arthur Golden's novel and set in 1929, this tale follows 9-year-old Chiyo, who is sold to a Kyoto geisha house. Chiyo endures harsh treatment from the owners and head geisha Hatsumomo, who's envious of Chiyo's stunning beauty. Rescued by Hatsumomo's rival, Chiyo blooms in her role as a geisha, but World War II threatens to change her privileged life forever. Ziyi Zhang, Ken Watanabe, Michelle Yeoh and Li Gong star.|`|CXxGBQTjaa	A geisha is most commonly mistaken for a hooker from japan, but in reality they are more of a companion. They do not have sex with everyman who pays them to be with them. Its kinda like an escort thing. The movie follows the life of one specific geisha and it is really amazing. I would recommend reading the book first though. I think the only reason I got the movie was because I read the book first I had to explain it to everyone:). But it is definitely worth your time!|`|rdp95817aa	asdf

ALL OF YOUR SCALES even the sharpes and the flats you can get them in a guitar book at the guitar center! but it doesn't matter how long as long as your LEARNING! and as for the songs it all depends on what kind of music you like, you should diverse  your music!! like play rock, blues, jazz, etc. don't stick with one type of music or you wont learn new stuff! but yes keep practicing     and remember  practice makes perfect.. and when you practice don't keep repeating the part you already know....learn the part your don't...and practice like its a performace...that way when you actally perform ill feel like just a practice    hope that helped hun  ?Cookie|`|i8lzbQytaa	For alternate picking skills learn the intro to the song Hypnotize by System of a Down. It alternates between two strings and the fingering is pretty easy.    For Beginning Chords learn Iron Man by Black Sabbath or Smoke on the Water by Deep Purple.    If you know how to read guitar tabs go to www.ultimate-guitar.com, they have guitar tabs for pretty much every single song there is, and it's free.    (Also, get a good amp. It makes you sound so much better than you actually are).|`|0VMyjRvNaa	I play guitar too. I think the best songs to practice are rock songs and acoustic ones. I.E -> Metallica, Guns n' Roses, Scorpions, Black Sabbath, Dragon Force, even Europe!

D6AEyhIIaa	I can't tell anything about your ascendent or moon or Mars or any of that but I can tell you this, Cancers and Capricorns are very attracted to each other and the two are very compatible. However, Aries and Capricorns are attracted to each other but there is no compatibility in a this combination. The attraction will disappear when both of the strong willed signs disagree on "who's the boss" and that's just one disagreement on the very long list of unhappiness.    PS: I'm a Cancer and my girlfriend is a Capricorn, she was with an Aries before me and she was miserable. They couldn't get along with each other, it was a real bad situation and now she's happy with me.|`|84726b724d7d1fd7da09652c50425c38aa	I have the answer!!!    Your Rising Sun is in Cancer and taht means your Descendant is in Capricorn. It means you are attracted to Caps!!     Also your Venus and Mars are in Taurus which are good for Caps,.|`|08y217Rdaa	Probably because your Descendant is in Capricorn. It's almost as good as fatal.|`|ykIleAQ7aa	It may have something to do with your Venus being in Taurus. Cappy's have an innate romantic thing for Taurus - that could be a reason.   My Venus is in Gemini and I attract a lot of Air signs. But I'm a Cancer w/ a Sag rising. I also find my self attracted to Air signs so I really think it has something to do with your Venus being in Taurus.|`|ADZgFvozaa	I don't know for sure, but I think that you need to run the other way when you see one coming because Capricorn males and Aries females aren't made for each other AT ALL!|`|872fcc76954a83920779a9df510b118baa	your cancer ascendant will strongly draw you toward Capricorns as they are on your 7th house sign.  That is the sign of relationships and outer self.  you will reflect traits which attract to you Capricorn types of people :)  Also the cluster of planets in Taurus draws you toward Earthly values.  Taurus and Capricorn are very compatible.    you probably will see Capricorns as a higher self.  you will admire their sense of direction and the way they just directly go for what they desire in life.  They can be something like a teacher to you.|`|CwNMq7RTaa	Your Ascendant is in Cancer.  That means you have Capricorn in the seventh house.  The seventh house is the house of relationships and partnerships.  The sign on the seventh house cusp describes the traits you look for in a partner.  Also with three personal planets (the small planets are the personal ones) in taurus, an earth sign, you understand capricorn on a basic level.  And with your sun in aries you have a competitive relationship with capricorn and that energizes you.

Listien to old punk if you don't like new stuff. Band's like The Misfit's, The Clash, Black Flag are timeless.|`|d0VN2pkgaa	It's a rare band that's good AND popular, whether they're "punk" or not.|`|5b218420f6e58d52278efc9527f29a95aa	Yeah, real punk rock is like that. More about the frustration the music is conveying. Bands like Black Flag and Pennywise will say punk rock isn't nice-sounding music and it's not supposed to be. It's angry music, really politically driven.|`|NQ3XZElFaa	I don't think punk rock was about music or money. It was about political ideals.    If it was about the music, then more punk musicians would know learn a fourth chord.

Crystal towers, that reflected light through them that was so pure and perfect that it was exactly like a city of spires made of crystals; and music played and you floated down through these crystal castles and there was nothing but a sense of joy and happiness.

That is what a brave Leo will do in a stressful time.  I really enjoyed watching this show.  It's a little different than a lot of films I have seen.  This is a mature film however.    Leos are great people, I could go on and on about Leos always tend to love them  :)|`|LMITI1I3aa	Uhm... I'm not sure about movies, but e.g. Madonna, Halle Berry, Antonio Banderes, Jennifer Lopez, Ben Affleck, Sean Penn, Megan Goode, Devin Aoki.. the list goes on.. those are some of the many leo actors. Being a leo myself I'd have to say.... The Legend of Zorro is close to that bravery trait.... rah rah..|`|mhsVWUfaaa	Nope! I am a leo and a run everything!|`|f52b9d308dcabe20fef567c914d84b49aa	heyyyyyy this is an ultrasensitive question for me.....IM A LEO...im tempted to say that im courageous and magnanimouss and represent the "will power and ego of the sun" and represent the "essential self" although the second last part is true  and i dont know what magnanimous mean, if its liek nice, i wld like to think i am.....i am brave but never brave enough....a guy i used to like(a big cursh lasting 2 and a half years_ is a leo and becoz im pissed off at him, i think he's not brave at all....this mght sound lame but i think spiderman best potray a leo...

I've never been "in love", but I love my friends and family very much.  I suppose that I'm just not old enough or just haven't had an experience that would make me turn my back on love....I love love...    2. Yes. Very much so, I could give you a completely cliched answer, like "they are always there for me", which they are, but i believe it's something deeper than that, just something more, the ties that bind are pretty strong here...    3. OOhhh Yeeeaahhh. All the time, I guess you could just stick it in the "teenage angst" category, and I'm sure a lot of peeps feel this way, but sometimes I just feel so damn alone....    4. Lol! I like long showers, but they have been like 30 minutes lately because I have a stinking cast on....do you know how hard it it to shower with one arm???!!!!    5. Yes!! And I have to get my stupid wisdom teeth pulled next friday!! Eek....    6. I'd like to think that I'm unique...|`|DibFrwxlaa	1.  Sure.  Got a particular lady in mind right now.

BA:      Pattern Juggler is funny, has good taste in music, and is a Star Wars winner.|`|J5FslwZXaa	I'm not totally sure if I've added you as a contact but I'm bored so I'm going to fill out this little survey. :)    Do you believe in love? Yes. But I also believe you can love more than one person.    Do you love your parents? Yes. Occasionally, I may tell them I hate them but that's just teenage angst doing its job.    Do you feel as though no one gets you? Not really. People may look at me like I'm some kind of freak but I know that inside, they're secretly wishing they were that psychotic.    How long does it take you to shower? Whoa. Way too long. I take half an hour for the showering part and then half an hour to dry off and style my hair and such.    Do you brush your teeth twice a day? Honestly? I try to. But if it's really late, I'll go to bed without doing that. I always brush in the morning though! :)    Do you like to think that there are people out here just like you? Not really. I love to be unique and try my best to do so.

Do brush your teeth twice a day?  Yes I do.     Do you like to think that there are people out here just like you?  As much as I would like to think so, I am very skeptical that there are many people at the age of 18 reading Arthur Rimbaud, Andre Breton, Karl Marx, William Burroughs, and Franz Kafka. But if there is, more power to them.    Peace!|`|wEpwWVhJaa	I absolutely believe in love  I love my parents-it's easier when you're not around them all the time  My best friends totally get me-we're in a minority there  Showering takes 7 minutes.

Love takes many forms, and I obviously have to wait for my love to come along. I love my son though, and my love for him in unconditional    I did love my parents, and I miss them both horribly. My mom died, me and my brother were there, and dad "died on my watch" so to speak.    No. One person gets me totally. My ex. Why we are not together is anyone's guess.

I've been caught once or twice in the "love trap". Thinking I truly loved someone. I've since learned that love is something that is not easily forgotten, manipulated or duplicated. If you truly love someone from the heart, you'll know it.  -Yes I love my parents very much.  -Of course, I'm guessing about 99% of my life no one gets.  -I stay in the shower for around 10 minutes, but I take long baths...

I believe that nature will take its course and whatever happens will happen. I believe in love a lot but there have been a few times I didn't    Do you love your parents?  Um....this is a toughie. I have a love/hate relationship with my mother. We love each other but at the same time we get into it quite a bit. I actually got to meet my biological father who lives in his Britain, its also where he is from, lol. The way that happened is I have a brother who goes to school in France and he contacted me last year and so we exchanged emails for quite a while before he said he wanted to see me in person. So I spent two months in France with him. That was a pretty sweet Summer vacation. My dad, feels weird saying that, came over on business and I got to meet him. He's really cool. I keep in touch with them all the time.      Do you feel as though sometimes no one gets you?  YES! All the time. My family doesn't understand why I wear skinny jeans. Yea my mom even asked, are those your sisters? No one relates to me musically except my brother in-law. He's hilarious. I played A Static Lullaby for him and he was like "all right power metal" ...and I guess me and my sister like a bit of the same pop music. My oldest sister with the awesome husband, not my younger sister who listens to....an unorganized mesh of rap, teen pop rock and mainstream music. I feel as though people in school don't get me sometimes.     How long does it take you to shower?  Lol..FFAF your scaring me! About 5-10 minutes    Do brush your teeth twice a day?  YES!!!!    Do you like to think that there are people out here just like you?  My girlfriend is living proof! We just connect like that! We're not exactly the same, but we can laugh at the same things, talk about music w.o dispute...I love her with all my heart =)    BQ: FFAF....    1) I remember the first question of mine you ever answered I believe is the one with Brittney Spears vs A Static Lullaby. Since then you've become like a good friend to me. It's hard to find words to describe you, you are just really awesome and I can't imagine why anyone would hate you or want to hurt you. Your a cool dude. If one of us ever came to the others respective homeland, I would say "dude lets chill" no joke =)    2) Your an amazing poet and a damn good guitarist with rockin jeans    3) You have great taste in music.    Stab...    1) Your the sweetest! You are super cool and super friendly and if your avatar is a pic of you which I assume is the case, you have a great smile and great hair. You look just like this hispanic girl in my school its scary. Your a hot rockin chick Stab I love ya    2) You have the best taste in music of all the girls I know you are  2. If it wasn't for my gf, you'd be  1    3) I'm glad we met...well ya know what I mean. You are definitely one of my favorite contacts!!|`|RtG5Iarbaa	1. Yes, I do.   2. Sometimes, but yeah, mostly.. yeah.  3. Most of the time. I'm very paranoid, so I barely tell people things.

Mmmintytoothpaste.  6. Yeah, actually. I wouldn't wanna meet one of them cause if they're almost exactly like me it'd be wierd. xD I get sick of myself fast.      BQ: Hmm.

py0F5Hv3aa	My friend had to answer two similar questions like that in the form of an essay to get accepted to this high school. Anyways back to science, i like science due to the fact that there are so many things out there, and they are beyond human intellect. Science is everything, everything you do revolves around science.        Science can be broken down in many parts, there's physics; the study of matter and energy.Theres's biology; the study of lifeThere;s chemistry, earth science and so on.        Human reproduction is science, its amazing how our gametes come together and form an embryo and just in few weeks in turns to a fetus. Well i know half the things i said was very blunt but if you want me to ellaborate on anything just contact me.|`|bRexdYL4aa	no I have a really mean science teacher and she acts like she dont get the concept of it and teaches us the wrong things|`|GmsUilIWaa	i love science so you can understand the worls around you.    and    i want everyone to know that i won mvp on my basketball team and im the second youngest
31e3aeeef48254ed515aa846df344c44aa	IMDb says it made $30 million in the US, but doesn't say how much it cost.  A little research in Daily Variety for 1975 would answer that -- some Southern California libraries may have it available on microfilm.  Check that at YOUR local library.|`|KDst9z5Naa	I loved that movie. You can find out what film studio made the movie and call them to request that information.

4qVWj3UHaa	not sure what you are asking, but if you want to know why           [Adult Swim] dosent show anime on weeknights, its because people were emailing them, telling them that they were tired of anime(who gets tired of anime) and so they made it were they only show it in saturday. Thy dont even show inuyasha at 5 and 5:30 anymore.|`|i210xqkgaa	they moved anime to saturday night only. they don't even show inuyasha at 5:00 and 5:30 am anymore! but at least they don't play reruns anymore, except for the shows that are already over. and it also costs money to have anime imported, and translated into english.|`|DPcIjHHZaa	it cost to much to import anime there is possibility that cn would get rid off all it's anime i hope that doesn't happend.

AA10916001	For the same reason they keep making things like Meet The Spartans and Disaster Movie:    Idiots pay to see it. Lots and lots of idiots.      In Hollywood, money talks and good taste walks.|`|rSq790ksaa	It was produced by Adam Sandlers company so since he's rich, he's the one paying for it, he can do whatever he wants.    You can't blame him, he made a good buisness decision. Mall Cop was the number one movie two weeks in a row.|`|7waA9vGeaa	Because in general, they believe the masses will enjoy the movie and a profit will be made And in this case, that is true as Paul Blart: Mall Cop is the  1 movie in the box office this week.|`|E70A7aqcaa	I couldn't say it better than "The girl is a geek" did, so, I'll just leave it at that.  God Bless you.|`|W1lh6A8saa	Some stupid people enjoy stupid movies.Also, the producers think it will appeal to a large population of Americans(specifically tweens and teens)|`|5TKEtXERaa	Because enough people went to see it that it became the  1 movie and will make everyone involved much money. If no one would pay to see porn there would be no porn, if no one smoked there would be no cigarette companies.      They make it because there is a demand for it or at least a lack of demand for anything more substantial.|`|31e3aeeef48254ed515aa846df344c44aa	Because we don't censor creative works in this country, no matter how stupid.      No one except the "market" "allows" anything to be made and distributed.|`|bCe4qrVfaa	Because the majority of americans like stupid movies. But Wall-E was a good moive. I saw it and i really liked it.
AA11522290	I guess it means it really got hot for him. Or he just thinks the other girl is hot. In the song the singer he always says "in your eyes" so he probably saw a girl for the first time and maybe fell in love.|`|4BKmxPcPaa	WWW.SONGMEANINGS.NET    WWW.MUSICMEANING.COM    WWW.EXPERIENCEPROJECT.COM/SONG_MEANING...

5b218420f6e58d52278efc9527f29a95aa	I consider a rapper a rapper.|`|OpBFc27iaa	no,because their a rapper.    but there are some rappers that sing, but i still consider them rappers.|`|066dbddb6348f26dd20544e15c95797caa	Agreed.  there is a hugee difference between rapping and singing.  singing can have diff range of vocal styles and rapping is just pretty much the same range all the time, consistently.  so.. no, i don't consider a rapper a singer   UNLESS, they can do both.. sing & rap  but i'm not goin to mash those two together..   i'll say it like they're seperated.  for ex.  Drake..   he raps..AND sings r&b .   so he is considered a rapper & a singer, but they're still completely diff.|`|baSks9O4aa	No. Pet peeve of mine is when people go,"Who sings that rap song?"    I'm like,"Nobody dummy! It's called rap music for a reason!"|`|472Fa8s3aa	some rap has singing in the corus but its more poetry than using vocals, or the sound of some ones talking voicec has to do alot more in rap than there sining voice u know what im sayin|`|4XXa7wBxaa	yes their is a big difference but for some rappers they can also sing.|`|M0ZDvXrAaa	Dr Suess was a rapper|`|40CuyrNlaa	theres a difference but of course there are those few that can do a little of both      Mos Def  Eminem (better then most rappers at singing)|`|tz4jie2oaa	No, its called rap, the reason they arent singers makes them rappers.  Look at Kanye that guy cant sing at all.|`|Yor2Vwk8aa	not unless ur a fag like lil wayne|`|hBGZYDKAaa	I consider them completely different but when they talk about rappers they are put into the singer/songwriter category on BET, MTV, and VH1. So I guess they are one of the same in the music industry.|`|bd1fcb5d764c68e35c6336cba1138542aa	Well, duh there's a big difference between rapping and singing.    I don't consider rappers to be singers.|`|bc92692e5171a576e30283eb2faec88eaa	Mos Def sings okay, but he's still a rapper.  Chamillionaire sings okay, but he's still a rapper. Lil Wayne, um.. "sings", but he's still a rapper.
5sJapvo2aa	I read some of the reviews on the site you linked to, and I can understand why you'd feel some trepidation. There's certainly no sense in seeking counsel from a therapist with whom you're not comfortable. But as you noted, you're judging him before you've met him, and some of the reviews were more or less positive. One visit doesn't commit you more visits. See him once; if your gut feeling is still a negative one, then demand that your physician recommend another therapist. If he can't or won't after you've explained why, then consider finding another physician.

He climbed his way from the bottom to the top. He never gave up even when he was told that he wouldn't get anywhere with this career. He kept his head held high. I think you should do  a little research. btw if you were a rapper or something and making millions of dollars i bet you would be conceited to I figure he's earned it.|`|apfnKPpRaa	idk! i agree with you! he sucks real bad! and ugly too|`|AlTL4kEwaa	wooooooow your asking the same question too?    i dislike him also    highfive*|`|Mo94Gbkhaa	HAHA C'M0N LADiES, HES N0T THAT BAD. L0L|`|J41ECckUaa	Simple as this. White teenage females like to dance to his music, so therefore they buy it, which makes him money, and so he gets overly confident for no reason and then calls himself the best rapper alive|`|VAlRLmAOaa	its not him. its his fans.    he is a shittyass rapper and his fans try to justify him being the best.    hes really dumb (and gay) and his fans are really dumb (and gay)|`|iqWfFii1aa	His songs are catchy...and you can dance to it...  I don't know they say he looks good...to me he looks ugly as hell...  If a REAL rapper dissed him, his career would flop...|`|472Fa8s3aa	every word you sed what completally right

G5nSzRJqaa	There are many small ways to decrease your carbon footprint;    Less demand for Beef (less people buying beef), means less farmers will raise "Farting Cattle". Also, foods that don't require cooking reduces the use of non-renewable resources.    Turn off the water while brushing your teeth, instead of letting it run down the drain.  Use larger wash loads for clothing or dishes. Wear clothing more than once before washing.  Eat less convenience foods. (packaging is wasteful)  Grow a garden, but beware of plantings that will take a lot of water to grow which may be wasteful. Beware of plantings that will need pesticides (fruit is famous for this issue).    Biodegradable garbage bags, because lets be realistic, brown paper bags aren't going to do the job. Nobody can avoid garbage but a good way to be environmental about it is to just cut down on it. Try to recycle as many things as possible, like tissue boxes, bottles, etc. Also, you can start composting things such as egg shells, banana peels, all that stuff. This will cut down drastically on the garbage you make.|`|xXyy51Efaa	By saving energy, using energy saving light bulbs, not using the car, walking. Yup.

POXOqhOYaa	Hey Ryoga!    Well, you sure do have a large anime list but I'm pretty sure I can top it and put them all in alphabetical order to, I'm not too picky to what I watch myself being a girl but I do really like girl love stories because I like the romance theme.    Here is just some of the over 200+ anime shows I've watched, trust me I have a lot of spare time on my hands in the winter months over here so I can watch it all day long because of snow storms and cold weather.

I have to agree w/BWA    PS: your list is weak you need to be a little more diverse.|`|eMMxXjaLaa	Mines about that size.|`|GBRmOem8aa	Mine is about 10 shorter then that... I counted ^_^|`|yacLHWqEaa	my list is way longer ive seen way way longer|`|v1hCymAEaa	It's a big list, but Im guessing a lot of people here might have seen that much or more anime. I have a big list too but I've never heard of some of the animes on your list, I may have to check a few out.    :-P|`|gzxjcVURaa	Are these shows you've seen or do you own them. I've been watching Anime for 10 years there's not enough space to write down all the ones I've seen. My Hentai collection alone dwarfs this list I've got over 200 different titles. Don't make me laugh.....     AMATEUR!!!!!|`|Ttf7867jaa	My list is longer... but i started watching anime more than 10 years ago.|`|gwwvio8Yaa	Hey Ryoga    I am actually impressed with your list of 62 titles, I would be more impressed if that all the series you have actually watched and I don't mean one episode or something you may have seen at a anime convention.   I mean the whole series or depending on the series whatever episode it's up to currently|`|FK0Lc696aa	Sorry dude, but I've pretty much got you beat.   http://www.crunchyroll.com/user/Rx2D/pag...

I could list some you missed, but at the risk of looking like a troll, I'll restrain myself.|`|Rn73EbWoaa	not exactly but its longer than my favs XP|`|vWSNi8boaa	You definitely do not have the longest anime list, but don't worry. Yours is fairly good and long :)  HERE is pretty much the biggest anime list I've ever seen:    http://anime.wikia.com/wiki/List_of_Anim...|`|6AxMy4WMaa	whoa what a list..   its ok list,, but not that long..  you haven't watch one of the best in anime.. search for more titles in google or yahoo then watch it.. ^^|`|XNIkS3KNaa	It's ok, it's decent I guess depending on how long you've been watching anime.    I have so many animes I can't even list them all. lol  I've been watching anime for a while though, 15 years. :)|`|3N2ElzcQaa	If that's only anime and mainly shonen anime, its very small compared to my list.|`|VXcp8hvHaa	mines much bigger|`|4Zj9eYgPaa	My list is bigger than that. I watch all kinds of anime, not only shonen or the sorts.  And I'm a girl, I've just watched 2 shoujo anime.
AA10904470	Try these two sites one is the official site and the other is a free radio station, it's likely Yahoo will delete this answer, they don't like links to sites outside their own network, they believe the whole net elongs to them and get upset when they are reminded that it doesn't lol|`|nQHkkR8Raa	Listen to individual songs of his on Youtube|`|JYVuP6C5aa	mmm he's yummy.  i love him ?<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  i'm not sure where you can hear it for free.. but if you can wait a month... you can buy his cd!   it'll be hard.. i started a count down when he said the release date......34 days!

AA10197672	Interesting! I myself, get bad vibes before something terrible is about to happen. Lately, I get them and earthquakes happen! The other gift I have is that I can draw anything, I was able to ever since I was a little girl and I had never taken any drawing classes! I also, sometimes see things in my head, as more imagining, and sometimes they come true. As an example, i saw in my head that this guy i see at work, comes and hands me a little note that has his number on it. 5 min later he walks by and hands me the paper. It was so obvious , i knew he was goanna do, that I stretched my arm to get the note from him before he even stretched his hand towards me to give it to me. He felt that too! like as if I knew what he was goanna do - interesting eh?....|`|AA11899483	hmm, i feel the same sometimes, but it more like haunts me.

05d05a85b5f1f6b2a229801a8fdd1408aa	I think Megan would be a HORRIBLE choice. Just because she has long black hair... she would make a good lara croft?? NOT. she isnt right for the part at all. or ANY part for that matter...|`|1620f8acd8e6a1bab16fb6d4bd625f7baa	Megan Fox is beautiful, but she does not know how to act. She's very awkward when she appears on film.   The only one who could rock the part of Lara Croft is Angelina.|`|tbKoPNbDaa	no angelina is way prettier and more natural i love her she was the perfect tomb raider!  like i used to think meagan fox was pretty but she got a nose job and lip injections and that made her ugly to me. i mean when your already beautiful why do you need that stuff? and i heard she was catty but that could just be a rumor|`|h0zJAdFIaa	Absolutely.  Most because they both seem to be less girlie than most other Hollywood actresses.  They both have kind of a wild side to them that they could parlay into the role.  And Megan Fox is a stunning woman who would keep in the line the tradition of attractive women representing Lara Croft in movies.|`|X2ADohmtaa	Definitly!!!!|`|oSiwyqMvaa	no one could replace angelina|`|sEpBQjQjaa	I don't mind Megan Fox, but I really think Lara Croft needs to be played by Angelina Jolie; that's her role! I don't like seeing originals being replaced by other actors/actresses. Imagine if Will Smith was replaced by someone else on Fresh Prince. It just wouldn't be the same. (Fresh Prince was the first thing that came to mind).|`|66dd0f9079eca1ebc158246bb048c00faa	Megan is hot and she has that Lara Croft look. I say let's give her a chance at the role, she may just surprise us.|`|Y65A7oUqaa	hell no!!! definately should be michelle rodriquez. shes bad *** and hot

Oh and my friend had to go to the skate park and hump the first guy she saw wearing vans. She did it too. HAHA.    Oh and to;  EDWARD CULLIN LOVA FOREVA: You didn't even spell his last name right. It's Edward CULLEN. Duh. And He wouldn't dump Bella for frikin' life... and you and your obsessivness is quite annoying. Especially when that has nothing to do with the question.

FhyYpuiUaa	You got six 6 strings on your guitar-EADGBe.     This is a tab.  Look at the 6 lines as the strings on your guitar.      E-------  A-------  D-------  G-------  B--------  e--------    Then, you have numbers on some of the lines:    E---1------------  A----------------  D---------3------  G-----------------  B-----------------  e------2--------0---    This is the fret.  Put your finger where the number is on the correct guitar string and pluck.    So, the first 4 notes of this tab, you would play:  Fret 3, string 1 (e)  Fret 0, string 2 (B) -- just pluck the string, no fret  Fret 2, string 2 (B)  Fret 3, string 2 (B).    Now, when you see numbers in a column, i.e,:  -----3----  -----2----  -----1-----    Put your fingers on the correct string on the correct frets and strum.    Now, this tab looks like a lot of plucking (rather than strumming a bunch of different notes), which should be rather simple.    Just practice.  It get easier.|`|02a3aa56f12facd0557c683d42ccc66baa	Great song to learn. It's fun and well known.  The tab is written with the lowest line being your low E and going higher up to the high E.    E  (High, string one)  B  G  D  A  E  (Low, string six.     The numbers on the lines are the frets to be played 1,2,3... etc. In the case of an "O", it is meant to be played open. Each number or numbers are played as the note or notes appear in each measure. If the notes are all in the same "column", they are played simultaneously, just like a chord.  It looks like the writer goofed and missed a space after the 16th and 17th measures, just play them as if they were properly separated.|`|n8S8Jhyzaa	alright i'm learning bass and that is what we call tabs it has the six strings and when it has the number hit the number on that string:    so for example:   E -----4                               A ------                               D ------                               G ------                               B -------                               E -------               that mean hit the top string and 4th fret|`|1N4gjndpaa	Guitar tabs are like an easier version of written music. Instead of musical notes on a page, guitar tabs tell you exactly where to put your fingers on the frettboard. The strings are ordered upside-down, like you're looking down at the neck while playing-- in other words, the strings are:    e ----------  B ---------  G ---------  D ---------  A ---------  E ---------    The numbers indicate which frett to play the string on, and their order indicates the order in which you play them.    Tabs have their drawbacks, too, however. They don't tell you two things: 1, which finger with which to play the note (you often have to figure this out yourself) and 2, time. Although you can get a basic idea of the timing of the notes from reading a tab, it doesn't tell you quarter-notes or half-notes or rhythm. You usually have to listen to the song a few times before you can figure this part out.    Keep playing! Look up any song you like and you think wouldn't be too tricky to play! And don't give up!

hBGZYDKAaa	I love him! Even if he didn't write his own music alot of people that everyone think writes there own music don't at least Lil Wayne never said that he is a singer/song writer. He knows his place is a rapper nothing more nothing less.(Fact is he writes his own lyrics when he's high) As for the fact that he is trying to make a rock album doesn't change anything for me I mean alot of artists try different things in there career. Besides lil wayne is absolutely gorgeous and is making more money than any of us will ever see so everyone needs to quit hatin on him!|`|mBQQL0kCaa	lil wayne is the best rapper alive,and EVERRRRYYY BODY exept the dumb ppl like him|`|oJfBZ8wOaa	people who like lil wayne are those crazy @ss fans who think he's the best rapper alive|`|BV2e9M5saa	He's okay, I don't mind him.

I dont really understand how somebody heard his voice and said " i wanna make this guy famous" like anyone on the face of the earth can "sing" what he does. His voice just sounds strange and not to mention he is a terrible role model! But whatever! If you like him great!|`|9f29214b43ea0ec7920b9578e8c01e82aa	The probability that one likes Lil' Wayne is inversely proportional to the subjects overall rap IQ.|`|8lgpofgUaa	i absolutely despise lil wayne. he is totally overrated. sadly, most people nowadays praise lil wayne and think he is the "greatest rapper alive" which is sad to be honest with you. lil wayne is trendy. hop off his jock people. he ain't the greatest... not even close to the greatest. he is just your average trendy commercial rapper.|`|eAJdebamaa	i use to love wayne  block is hot, 500 degreez, lights out, carter 1 and 2 are pretty good.  then carter 3 came and i lost my respect for wayne.     yeah i like old wayne..SUE ME.|`|Yor2Vwk8aa	He's garbage. i dont know how he got this far. call he can do is sing like a *****. his rock album will flop. i hate when people try to argue that because he sold a lot of records he is good. there is at least 50 rappers who are better than wayne and sold less than him. he musta sold his soul to the devil to have goten this far. lol|`|nFDc2LTaaa	Balls?|`|1KEb9cvCaa	lil wayne SUCKS|`|OnyLWwEJaa	sOOO WHAT ???

Tenor is the equivalent to soprano - high.|`|z6qIZRFFaa	You are probably a Soprano, that is the highest it will go in school usually.

This site can tell you everything.|`|d1X9zICiaa	You like to argue.  You like/try to be the opposite.  You have two sides, good and bad. There is no in between.  You do not get along with Scorpio's at all.  Somewhat sarcastic.|`|872fcc76954a83920779a9df510b118baa	I get along with Scorpios very well..!  I am a Gemini.  We are inquisitive, smart and tend to argue unless we can decide to temper ourselves.  and I have learned to challenge myself to change, when I learned that the way I was doing my life wasn't feeling the best for me.  Gemini learns everything changes and you have to constantly be ready for it.  We have to listen to the better self.  and remember to make the best choices in life not the ones that only bring us down.  because when we are down we are quite down.  Gemini are very creative souls and will be active and likely will decide to take courses for higher learning throughout life.  Gemini wnats to know everything and goes on a mad quest to learn it all even though they know deep in their hearts they may never be able to learn absolutely everything there is to know.    In my opinion Gemini is much more emotional than they seem and they are often written off as cold and sometimes even related to having psychotic tendancies  (I have never ever met a cold or hard Gemini just emotional and poetic ones  :-P )

WtjbCSnSaa	EVERY MOVE I MAKE (Waves of Mercy)  -  Ruis David  (1996)      Every move I make, I make in you  You make me move, Jesus    Every breath I take, I breathe in you    Every step I take, I take in you  You are my way, Jesus    Every breath I take, I breathe in you    Waves of mercy, waves of grace  Everywhere I look I see your face    Your love has captured me  O my God, this love, how can it be?    La la la la la la, la la la la la la la la  La la la la la la, la la la la la la la la    --------------------------------------...    Additional spontaneous lyrics:  (First verse opens without Jesus at the end of lines.)  How can it be, oh, that this God would love me, love me?   What kind of king would empty himself?   What kind of king would give it all away, to love me?   Oh, I must know, I must know this love!  How can it be?   .. My heart sings ... Oh, is this a dream?     Jesus, Jesus, it?s You, Jesus   My heart would sing Your name,   Sing Jesus     --------------------------------------...    Notes:  This song was first sung in South Africa in March 1996, but then it was called ?Waves of Mercy?. The part of the tune between the verse and chorus sung to ?La la la la la la la, La la la la la la la la la? etc, was not yet written, and we ended it with just ?Jesus? and not the other additional words
ScFTKHa5aa	-Sama is a suffix for a sibling or relative other than your parents. You can also address your boss casually. -Kun is used for a student or child. That's all I have!|`|3N2ElzcQaa	They're honorifics. In America, its like addressing a stranger 'sir' or madam' or 'ma'am. In Japanese, its a way of respect to everyone.|`|Hiasgb75aa	Japanese honorifics used to title people depending on their status from your point of view.    http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japanese_ti...|`|8a65aa558e9ad4329fd6cecf8635eb04aa	I believe they're used for respect, especially the -sama and -sensei ones. -chan is used for someone really close to you, like friends.|`|ej6sCfl6aa	Those are used to signify a level of respect. This is roughly what each one means:    kun - informal; used for speaking to young boys; females use to show emotional attachment    sama - very formal; used for speaking to people of higher status or rank; can also be used while addressing customers of your business or work    chan - very informal; used for speaking to young children  or family members; also used while speaking to intimate or close friends; also a term of endearment    sempai - formal; used for speaking to mentors or senior colleagues, or myabe a person in a higher grade in school than you, or anyone with more experience than you    Using them outside of their proper place and be considered very rude. For example it would be very rude to call your teacher -chan instead of -sensei. It would also be odd to call your sister -san which would be like saying "Mrs. Sister"    Besides these, there are also -san, -sensei, -khai (which is rarely used) and others you may not have heard of. You can learn alot more about what they mean, and how to use them.    http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japanese_ho...  http://virtualmekton.tripod.com/ate-iii-...  http://www.jref.com/language/japanese_su...

yNfZO1I8aa	Personally, I highly doubt that GL will be picked up if it is canceled. There aren't any time slots open on NBC, CBS, or ABC. Not to mention, if there were-it would be competition for other CBS Soaps (which would be kind of ironic). GL has falling ratings and the lowest of all soap budgets. They switched over to this new filming format because it is cheaper, and to be honest-they can't afford a set/studio, especially in the present state of the economy. CBS sources are saying that GL will likely be cancelled this year, but who knows. It has been around since 1937, and it will be a major blow to daytime if it is cancelled. I hate to say it...but I see it as a lost cause. I grew up watching GL and it will be a sad day if it is cancelled, but I see it as inevitable.     I am not familar with DOOL. However, it has been doing fine in the writings lately ( 3 some weeks). So, I doubt that DOOL will be cancelled.     I believe that if any soap would be cancelled-it would not be picked up by another network. There are probably 2 exceptions to that idea, though: The Young & the Restles and General Hospital.|`|FCKdRZd1aa	there's always the soap opera network.|`|8tc4B6wvaa	In the 1st place, THE GUIDING LIGHT as it was originally called prior to 1975, is the longest running soap; The program was created by soap writer Irna Phillips, and began as an NBC radio serial on January 25, 1937 before moving to CBS on June 30, 1952, as a televised serial. It will never be cancelled.    In the second place, Michael Zaslow died in 1998 of Lou Gehrig's disease.    I have been a fan since 1961.
aa9fa110a20e70922d00a7a8b77dd863aa	there are 2 stages side by side and they play constantly switching between the two.     in other areas there are about 5-6 other stages with bands, and they play throughout the day, so odds are, unless you're a poserish kid who only likes the 'popular' bands, you're going to have to make some sacrifices, since some of the stages are far away and your favorites might be playing at the same time    also there isn't really a way to prepare, to keep it fresh for the bands, they don't announce lineups till the morning of the show, and yes, i've seen headliners go on at 1pm... (also be there at 12.. sometimes the tickets say 1, but the bands have already started...)    it's like a fair kind of atmosphere.. lots of people wandering about to the stages, and the booths, and trees (it get's very hot)     have fun :)|`|19sa1ITfaa	no clue just answering for 2 points|`|68vju75baa	it's wayyyy to early for warped tour.  and there's no confirmation that those bands are going to your city..|`|oUZLZusjaa	I've never been, but the bands play on seperate stages. I guess you might risk missing a band having to leave one stage and run to the next, no doubt having to buy an $8 water bottle and having your wallet stolen along the way. I don't think its worth it (mostly becuase all teh bands that go on the tour are crap) but do as you wish.|`|71DWu22kaa	Warped Tour is not like other concerts!!  I know exactly how you feel b/c I went for my first time last year.      First off:  There are lots of different stages that have the bands playing at different times.  They're set up all over the area.  You will be walking/running to catch your fave bands, so tennis shoes would be a good idea.  Second:  There are lots of people. The crowds are crazy, but super fun.  Remember everyone is there to hear/see their bands,so just chill out and have fun.  Third:  Bring money for water/refreshments cuz it will be hot!    FOURTH!!!  HAVE FUNN!!!|`|sz1YqwUEaa	Their are different stages you got to check the gaint sign to see what bands are playing what stage and when. Also don't were a backpack my friend got stuff stolen from him in one of them. and you have to work the times in see if those 2 or three fit in at the same time    Hey Im going to bayside I know those guys pretty well|`|5b218420f6e58d52278efc9527f29a95aa	You get your ticket "at the door" so to speak, go check the huge schedule thing and keep an eye on the time so you can fit in all the bands you want. It's pretty simple and pretty fun. If there are two or more bands you love playing at the same time then you're just going to have to pick which one you like the most. Or pick one that you think will have the shortest set and you can squeeze in the tail end of another.    It's way too early to see which bands will be playing in your area, but I definitely think at least one of those three will be there.|`|LXK8ktGOaa	....|`|nV6vEF6haa	there are a ton of different stages and a ton of different bands playing all at once.|`|lzOqcGgUaa	i don't know if this will help.. but here's my experience from last year ill include EVERYTHING.    i woke up at about 6 o'clock, me and my friend got ready, we were out of the house by ohh.. 7;30?  anyways, i had a v.i.p pass last year waiting for me so, we were there for 9. :)  i went in early, left my friend inline, i walked around for a bit, chose which band i wanted to go onstage with (cobra starship), wrote down all  the bands that we're playing, what stage and what time. i went back and got my friend, and we walked around and went to see from first to last.  we then decided what bands we wanted to see. we met up with a friend we hadn't seen in a year and went to see another band.    ..anyways, i don't want to tell the rest hahaha, i'll just answer your questions.    the bands all play in one day because they have several different stages, and warped runs from 11 am till around 11 pm, so theres alot of time.    chances are, two or more bands you'll want to see will overlap each other, that's just the way it works, i suggest staying for half a bands set and go to another if you wanted to see another.     if you have anymore questions, feel free to email me at samantha-nicole@live.ca
hIdzQoquaa	It means everyone hates him for being a wanker.|`|AA10731216	well bob dylan actually originally wrote that song. but it is basically just saying that you are the only one that can help yourself in life, so you better get on board or else die|`|apfnKPpRaa	it looks like it means looks back at what you've done and learn from your mistakes or whatever...|`|1yQJlon8aa	It basically means be careful what you say, because everything come back to bite you in the *** eventually.
CFZ4ISNNaa	Last fall the spoilers were saying that Dante was to arrive around Feb. 09, but I haven't heard anything lately. There's a new male character named Ethan coming to the show. A couple of the soap sites hinted that he may be Dante incognito, but I'm not too sure about that.     Oh yeah! On ghofs.net it said that Sonny confronts Olivia about a secret....soooo maybe the storyline isn't quite as dead as we think.|`|C4knGt7Iaa	I heard that they were still casting the part so they had put the storyline on the backburner for the time being.  But when he *does* find out....I would NOT want to be anyone who knew and didn't tell him.  Yikes!    Someone asked how many kids he has so here ya go:    1.  Dante by Olivia  2.  Michael by Carly (adopted)  3.  Christina by Alexis  4.  Morgan by Carly    Now, if he has one with Claudia, yikes!  Poor kid...he'll be pulled apart with everyone trying to get him on their side.   I'm willing to bet Claudia *does* get pregnant but it won't be Sonny's...it'll be Ric's.  Sonny will try to save face by saying that yeah, it's his baby, but of course everyone who's in the loop will know that the baby is really Ric's.  Yikes!|`|EhBF31evaa	I think Claudia will be busted first and then Kate will have all of these feelings about honesty and secrets and she and Olivia will go a few rounds about it and then Kate will end up telling him the truth (and then I hope she leaves town).  She really annoys me!|`|M1ymLE9Paa	Since one of the main reasons for having Olivia on the show is due to the fact that she had Sonny's child in secret, I think it's just a matter of time.  It looks like they just haven't found the right guy to play him yet or something.|`|K3PR7Mivaa	some guy shows up at the haunted star with Luke  I look for it to be Dante but though he's around won't be revealed to olivia kate or sonny that he's around|`|NGNeT3rYaa	Yes but I think it will still be a few months away for him to hear it. We gotta get through this first!|`|AA12315431	I think it is on the back burner for now but it will crop up again once all of this crisis stuff is over. My question is, why is Olivia even still in town? She came for the wedding and fro when kate got shot and now all of the sudden she is a resident? The writer's really need to fill in the gaps.|`|sYXJ5Nj2aa	Damn how many kids does he have? I can't wait until Claudia gets busted.|`|7XM4QJiuaa	I heard Dante is coming soon.|`|st2zmU88aa	he will most likely eventually find out..  but of course they will drag it out for aslong as they can.|`|EQP8VZwiaa	Who knows. I'm sick of the writers dragging this out.

Natural beauty is always best and I think Vanessa has that.<br>  <br>  She's one of my favorite celebrities.|`|EkmLWm1vaa	shes pretty.<br>  but kinda slutty,|`|6KOEbjjJaa	she is ok but i do not think she is pretty as a hollywood star|`|sf7w45m0aa	Yea

WDkWnmfKaa	A lot of Twilight fan sites have small downloadable clips of the movie that were seen on the news or perhaps on MTV. They're completely legal.    Also, you can try IGN. They have downloadble trailers and some random clips - all completely legal.    Try using Windows Movie Maker to edit your clips. It's the most easiest way.|`|3s8vpp6jaa	What I would do is to go to Google and search for Twilight scenes and then just save the images that you find.Another good idea would be to go to Flickr and search Twilight scenes.          Hope that helped!!!|`|5Xh7y0waaa	imovie is a good program to use for cutting and pasting movie scenes. You can play other unrelated audio over the top as well, such as your voice as you discuss the film, music or maybe soundeffects.|`|rHlmNoYUaa	If you can, do both scenes and pictures. you can find pictures simply by going to google images and typing in Twilight. Then, at google go to 'more' next to images and find 'video'. find the scene you want, then copy it onto garage band. then, edit away using the cut icon|`|BCu8rER4aa	no,..  but looking for the answers,..|`|Tv2C8z5vaa	Twilight is not out on DVD so it is illegal to watch clips of it. You wouldn't want to put that on powerpoint because your teacher might notice and suspend you. You should just use pictures. They have some really great pics. Done it before. Hope this helps. Use google images.

4kmUX5pHaa	Yes TZP was no doubt a better movie than SM. It do was nominated  and Mr. Amir Khan also tried to promote it but sorry to say it was out in first round.<br>  They only give awards to their person. The director of SM is outsider - a Birtish man. Actually it is his winning position and not of Indians moreover he has made fortune by showing our shortcomings. Similar was with the case of film GHANDHI. It was also created by a forigner.<br>  The only thing in SM to have solace is the award to A R Rehman, but here we must keep in mind that Mr. Rehman has created more better songs and music than in this picture or that song Jai Ho. But he was never given this honour before.<br>  So - no doubt - the Oscar to SM is not to a better creation but to a western man and on showing the miserable life of Indians.<br>  Earlier west was saying us the land of snakes, monkeys and Jadugars and now they are going to call us SLUMDOGS.|`|6HyIkR7Caa	Yes it was sent to the Oscar but didn’t get nominated. I liked TZP more than Slumdog Millionaire. The movie wasn’t made for western audience so it couldn’t get much appreciation. There are many Indian movies which are better than Slumdog Millionaire like A Wednesday, Mumbai Meri Jaan and the upcoming movie Barah Aana. Barah Aana is a comedy of real life revolves around 3 common men in Mumbai. I saw it at the film festival in Mumbai. The film is extremely well made and every one has given strong performance. The film is set in today’s Mumbai, wanna read more about the movie visit this link <a href="http://barah-aana-the-film.blogspot.com/" rel="nofollow">http://barah-aana-the-film.blogspot.com/</a>|`|Z13dQrkuaa	Yes it goes for oscar.......but its not nominated...|`|5vsWMs82aa	ya i think u r right tzp is much better than slumdog..........!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!1|`|T2n4i0Rtaa	it was sent to the oscars but was not nominated. but, if the same film was directed by an american, it would have swept the Oscars. all slumdog millionaire showed was filth and poverty in India. it is thrash.|`|KTM6D9Aqaa	I don't think so... Chances are India didn't nominate it as their foreign movie... Countries are able to nominate one movie for the best foreign category, but TZP wasn't one of them that I remember|`|uFgV95Fmaa	nope although it was a pretty good movie|`|fPpc1i4Daa	no it didnt|`|wz8gx3gaaa	It did went to Oscars but could not get nominated.|`|TzWOLbpwaa	yes but it did not win
AA10133345	S T U P I D !!!!<br>  <br>  I saw a commercial a while ago that says it's like 19.99 or something and they send you two CD's!<br>  <br>  WTF do  I want with TWO of those?|`|TjePtr7Aaa	yeah who want s to listen to a bunch of kids?|`|mNC4r3EIaa	Yes, it's horrible. It doesn't help that the kids have the whiniest f*ckin voices I've ever heard. And they keep coming out with new ones! Stupid stupid stupid.|`|a6f6a6266eb16fda348c56044f9bc982aa	Well i could see a 5yr old listening to it, to have something to sing with or dance around to. Then for it being for teenagers i would say they aren't going to like Kids Bop, they are old enough to listen to the real songs. I would not want my 5yr dancing around to music with all kinds of cuss words. There is a age group of kids that will like Kids Bop. I personally will not listen to it though.|`|NY2fpmvPaa	No kidding! What's up with Kids Bop? Why can't kids listen to songs sung by the actual people? Why do they have to get this CD that has these songs sung by a bunch of r-tard kids? I feel bad for the kids whose parents buy them that crap. So cheeeeesey! I think the concept was that kids would like it more because it is sang by other kids, and parents like it more because there is not cussing. Well, go get a cd that is EDITED and your problem is solved! I know that I wouldn't have liked that as a kid, I would have wanted to hear the real deal! <br>  <br>  <----vows to never buy her future children Kids Bop|`|yw3Jze2naa	-raises hand-<br>  <br>  That isn't even music! They may as well listen to the real song if they want to.|`|c6P3LmGiaa	AGREED.|`|s7UWLOS9aa	You pretty much said it all. I mean, what is the point if there is no swears? And I want to listen to the PERSON WHO SANG IT, no some damn 5 year old! I totally agree! And in the music videos, they change the whole thing up and it doesn't match! Like for example, if it is a sad song, the music video will be all happy and it makes no sense! Ah!|`|2LqfVK1naa	1. Agreed<br>  2. Agreed<br>  <br>  Kids bop is horrible, they suck, and im surprised it is still around.|`|dGpj4WOIaa	I don't like it. but i think  it is ok if a kid listens to it. i mean they can listen to the same music their parents, or older siblings are but without cursing, or vulgar.|`|5Ra5xbziaa	i do....they are just singing the same songs stars like chris brown and pink made up its really stupid and pointless.for all that you might as well just bought the cd at wal*mart|`|yt4DyhPOaa	i agree so much. <br>  their like, 8 year olds singing(quite badly) to some good songs.<br>  they ruin music, oh so much.|`|JwGS57jzaa	YES!! FINALLY SOME! HU AGREES WITH ME!!|`|pCHg6y01aa	ME! THEY SUCK!!!!!!!|`|tBsMH9kGaa	I Think that the normal music is better. I mean come on these kids haven't even gone through pubertity and they think they can sing like Christ brown, Eminem, Etc.|`|LMWFnodfaa	i totally agree with you.<br>  i hate them soo bad. the kids REALLY cant sing. <br>  <br>  ??|`|qf1rY9ZDaa	finally someone agrees with me.<br>  <br>  theyre such posers&cant sing.<br>  <br>  they suck at life&they are losers.|`|TdfXz8PMaa	i totally agree. lol.|`|lAmNQBunaa	omg it's so dumb! they're gonna regret those dumbass commercials too when they're older.|`|PrwbJbawaa	hell yea that shits wack|`|1133b5d38a3d30a09c2b1c70499eaaf9aa	I agree it is real stupid

s2A4r4mVaa	Depends on your taste, but here are a few that I like.      Dexter (Showtime? and CBS)  Law and Order (all three) (NBC & USA)  Burn Notice (USA)  Psych (USA)  Monk (USA)  Leverage (TNT)  Rescue Me (FX)  Sanctuary (SciFi)    Movies:  Can't go wrong with the classics.  Harold and Maude is my personal favourite.  The Bad Seed is also great - in black and white though, Bedtime Stories was hilarious - the ratings were wrong on that one, Paycheck, and anything with Harrison Ford should be decent.  Oh, and if you're into twisted, the Saw movies are gory but very creative with the first one being the best.|`|80ea3ebfcf0c7be470984e0a148b10afaa	TV Shows:  There are too many bad ones out today. It depends on your preference, really. Try channel surfing to see what you like.    Movies:  There are a load of great ones. Caddyshack and Animal House are my two favorite comedies, Harry Potter and Lord of the Rings are my favorite fantasy movies, I know that the Bourne trilogy is really good, even if I don't like it. Also try oldies such as The Rough Riders (|`|qqHjjVcOaa	NCIS is a great show if your into the crime stuff  Two and a Half Men is hilarious  Life on Mars is one of the best shows I've ever seen  Dexter is pretty intense|`|UF6KcXDvaa	30 Rock!!|`|q82cqg3raa	How I met your mother  The Big Bang Theory  Entourage  Ugly Betty  Criminal Minds  ER  House  Scrubs  Grey's Anatomy|`|pUCe6F1Vaa	Lost  Mad Men  Dexter  The Office  Entourage  Man vs. Wild  It's Always Sunny In Philadelphia|`|rNIFQKF9aa	Its always sunny in Philadelphia    a little raw but I laugh my *** off|`|7frmvguUaa	Bones  NCIS  House  30 Rock  How I met your mother  Scrubs

hxDhGakqaa	I thought of that too! I think he'd probably try to conquer the world and kill a bunch of people or destroy a bunch of buildings, but then something would happen that would drive him back. Maybe Kagome would get the jewel somehow and purify it, or tap into some unknown power. It kind of reminds me of how the Nazis were trying to take over Ed's world in the Fullmetal Alchemist movie|`|ChwJWjQSaa	they would wreak havoc and she would fins out, scream, get Inuyasha, and fight. she gets much stronger, physically and emotionally.|`|G5weg8gCaa	Kagome would just probably stare in shock wondering how he came to her time. I know she would try to fight back as much as possible by using her arrows. She would also wait for Inuyasha to rescue her... if he does not come but I know he would, then she is doomed (-_-)|`|Rn73EbWoaa	I think shed go crazy but naraku wouldn't beable to do anything because in present-time no one would believe in demons and since there arent many strong one ones out there he wouldn't get strroger and hed get bored and eventually leave^^|`|ScFTKHa5aa	I agree she may faint, but once Naraku starts going about town a lot of the townsfolk will think he's either a crackhead or a reject from a Kabuki theater troupe.

In all honesty, I'm really just not that into NBC anymore.  I only watch L&O, and that's rare these days.  I find CBS, Fox, F/X, USA to have better quality shows.    The Superbowl is on Sunday, not Monday.  And according to NBC, it's starting on Monday night.  And I won't be watching it anyways, because Eric McCormack's new show Trust Me is on at the same time on TNT (which I forgot about-luckily they're re-airing the first episode tonight)  So no Medium for me.|`|qJTInlSeaa	Yes, I will definetely be watching..

oUZLZusjaa	It weighs a bit more than I'd like, but overall it's a nice guitar and worth the comfort you lose in weight. With a comfortable strap and the ability to sit down (if you're going to be playing for a few hours straight, that is) you should be fine with this guitar.|`|61f99d9f0ca16b4c1f86c22f08a91054aa	I don't care much about my guitar weight. Neither do anybody else, but maybe you have a point there. I owned a Fender telecaster looks just like Jonny Greenwood's one which I buy for $ 789.00. Sometimes, I borrow my friend's guitar which is Gibson Les Paul Custom Black and played with it. To my notice, both guitar seem to have the same weight.     But I think my guitar should weight less or a little bit more than 1 kg. 800 - 1.1 kg should be....

6g3Z8NwVaa	I can't tell if your question is about the movie or the motion comic. So let me address both. The Watchmen Motion Comic is 12 episodes long, each episode is 30 minutes or so. It is rated TV-MA. The movie is rated R with a running time of 2 hours and 43 minutes.|`|lCclgQbiaa	About Watchmen Motion Comic can be read in <a href="http://find-info-answers.blogspot.com/?q=Watchmen%20Motion%20Comic" rel="nofollow">http://find-info-answers.blogspot.com/?q...</a>
897a2fe6b6c76e90fe430c2613a38ffdaa	Well as "the jonas brothers" i think they will around and big for as long as you said maybe not even that long.   my prediction:  after a few years of taking a break they will all do their on thing in the music buisness  -Nick will become a solo artist. Kinda like Justin Timberlake after he left Nsync. He was the one who was going to be a solo artist in the first place and i think he has the most talent and passion out of all the three.   - I think Kevin will take some time off and then do something in the industry. Maybe start a record label or manage other artists  -and for Joe maybe he will become an actor or comedian. But I think he is going to lay low and live a pretty normal life..well as normal as people will let him.    oh and for everyone who is like "oh disney people never last blah blah"   Some of the biggest stars today were once with Disney. Britney,Justin,Christina..they were all Disney stars.|`|AFgwcJUPaa	Not very long...|`|31e3aeeef48254ed515aa846df344c44aa	Til 4:17 AM on June 13th, 2010.|`|bCe4qrVfaa	till all of their loyal fans die, including me. i will always love them and thier music!!!|`|a8pzuKINaa	Omg all the people on here are freaks!

SO DEFINITELY|`|a860e9b17c0946e66c4ca331bb01f9d2aa	3 minutes. They're going to be 30 before you know it.|`|VnckTnk9aa	I think it's already over for them ...    lol ;o)|`|QRNmJTF0aa	i really like them but i think they won't last many more years. They had their shot.|`|fd257d3d99a29db9c4b6827ceb9a6927aa	Ha! not long. They are just a fad, they have no real talent. They have no originality and the only reason they ever became famous is because of disney. The only fans they have are little girls and preteens. I would say they will be popular for maximum 2 years, but im sure they won't break up because they're brothers and as much as i do not like their music they look pretty close. an end to their career may break them apart but that's it. They wouldn't be famous on their own.|`|kktoXldiaa	I agree,I give them 2 years if not that. And they might not make it to 2011,i used to be a fan but then I just lost my interest in them think they had their time to shine and now it's almost over and its time for someone else to get their shot. But they might get even bigger when they're 3D movie comes out this yr with demi lovato in it. If that happens then then I wont give them long till till they break up.|`|rqfxp9ubaa	Forever?  And it's not a phase :P|`|1RwZZ2aPaa	Their getting their 15 minutes of fame. Just wait, they be done and over with in six months.
12QJ9QMRaa	Not in the least.    Music is just one of many ways to express oneself, like drawing, painting and the like.  It can be shared, it can also be private, for our own enjoyment.    I play Bass, and when I was younger I did the whole garage band thing.  It was fun.  Nowadays, I don't really enjoy the attention that comes along with being in a band, so I play for me, for my own personal enjoyment.  I play because when I am in a mood, I find it very soothing, and I enjoy it, be it some simple Jazz, to Cliff Burton.    So, no, there is nothing remotely odd about it.  If you want to do it, and you enjoy it, that is all that matters.    And contrary to the person above, no it is not different for guitar than fo rbass, unless you have a very limited view of what a bass guitar can do.  I would recommend looking up the basslines layed down by Jaco Pastoreus, Cliff Burtom, John Entwistle, Geddy Lee, Steve Harris or many others before passing such a narrow and inaccurate judgement.    I have been playing bass for 15+ years, and find it completely enjoyable.  If one is just going to play super simple things, then guitar can get just as boring just as fast.    I would agree with one thing though.  Considering the cost involved I would probably see if I could borrow one from a friend for a couple of weeks to determine if you really wanted to play it before investing the money.  But if the desire is there, absolutely go for it, and enjoy!|`|5HvdcWvBaa	Not at all. Are you from London?|`|314092812ee2f93df99495eaf53e0584aa	I have a guitar and I have no ambitions to be in a band, there is nothing wrong with playing just for fun.  Do what you like. =)|`|0ZnmX9qeaa	That's not weird at all. Plenty of people simply play an instrument as a hobby. If anything about that is strange, it would be that it's a bass instrument, but no- Playing an instrument just for fun is totally normal.|`|5cUwb7Wgaa	it wouldnt be WEIRD, but my friend did that, and got bored of it in like two days. its different for guitar, but if you're playing bass you need someone to play with.. and you'd probably get bored of looking up tabs and playing with songs.   ..so if youre not gonna play with anyone be sure you REALLY want it before you waste a bunch of money.|`|geih5vR8aa	No, why would it be weird? Just get one, if you wanna learn to play. You may enjoy it, and decide to start your own band in the future.|`|he5U9Fpdaa	There's nothing wrong with that.  A lot of people play instruments just because they like to or it makes them happy.  Who knows maybe after you play a while you'll want to be in a band?

Yes this Question has been all over! Ok, I dont think he punched her because he got an STD. She apparently was going through his phone, and looked into his emails, and text messages and found out he was cheating. That was probably when the fight started like, in his car. He apparently also was flirting with Leona Lewis right before the grammies. she got pissed and got mad.<br>  <br>  I don't exactly know when either one of this fiascos started but I know it was deff. this, probably not the STD,|`|hFSmNoUsaa	i looked up the newspapers and stuff online and wat happened as far as i know is that chris and rihanna were in a rental car and they started arguing and CB pulled over the car and they both got out and started arguing and he attacked her. a witness called 911 but he was gone b4 they came. there was a quote from the police in one of the articles i read saying that her injuries were were obvious. the police say that chris came into the station to turn himself in at like 6:30pm and that his attorney came and his bail was set at like 50,000...i think and he paid it and was able to leave by 9. he is being charged with criminal threats to her or something like that and assault might be added on later but thats up to the court or something and his court date is march 5, 2009. and so yah. i think its crazy that he would do that to her, thats sooo stupid of him! no one really knows yet what caused him to hit her and theres a bunchhhh of rumors out there about stds and her being pregnant or him cheating and her leaving him but its just a bunch of BS i think. im sure well find out after the press release comes out after the court date tho. and whatever he reason is it doesnt matter anyway cause what he did wasnt called for, if he was so mad at her he just shuda broke up w her. i liked chris brown and i still like his music but this definitely made me lose my respect for him. <br>  <br>  <br>  <a href="http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/lanow/2009/02/chris-brown-boo.html" rel="nofollow">http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/lanow/20...</a><br>  <br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.timesdispatch.com/rtd/entertainment/music/article/chris_brown_awaits_charges_victim_not_identified/201726/" rel="nofollow">http://www.timesdispatch.com/rtd/enterta...</a><br>  <br>  <br>  welll hope this helps! peacee outt :)|`|do8pdlluaa	They fought over the baby.

He tells Naruto after the mission fails and the return to the village.|`|wl85WhsTaa	well Naruto and Sasuke got in a big fight before he joined, that's when Naruto first transformed into the Kyubi and sasuke let his curse seal take over. Gaara became kazakage sometime in between the end of the sand and sound village attacking the leaf village and when naruto and the others go try to stop sasuke b/c the sand village shows up to help and he is kazakage at that point . From what I remember it doesn't really show much about sasuke meeting up with orochimaru, just the leaf and sand village trying to stop sasuke from getting to orochimaru which was a failed attempt.

There was a blonde who found herself sitting next to a Lawyer on an airplane. The lawyer just kept bugging the blonde wanting her to play a game of intelligence. Finally, the lawyer offered her 10 to 1 odds, and said every time the blonde could not answer one of his questions, she owed him $5, but every time he could not answer hers, he'd give her $50.00. The lawyer figured he could not lose, and the blonde reluctantly accepted.     The lawyer first asked, "What is the distance between the Earth and the nearest star?"     Without saying a word the blonde handed him $5. then the blonde asked, "What goes up a hill with 3 legs and comes back down the hill with 4 legs?"     Well, the lawyer looked puzzled. He took several hours, looking up everything he could on his laptop and even placing numerous air-to-ground phone calls trying to find the answer. Finally, angry and frustrated, he gave up and paid the blonde $50.00     The blonde put the $50 into her purse without comment, but the lawyer insisted, "What is the answer to your question?"     Without saying a word, the blonde handed him $5.|`|F2gYMVQXaa	buy some astroglide and get on the internet....waht was that a stupid answer?|`|59eTo25kaa	You're on the internet, the world is at your finger tips, how could you possibly be bored?|`|tsYtZFHjaa	Go on facebook.

ReGhCqgVaa	Normally it depends on the venue.|`|cVQkkl34aa	You can have a camera, but recording devices are not allowed because all audio/video rights are reserved to their respective owners. You'll be able to get in with a camera, but if it's like a expensive professional one, you'll need a press pass. But like I said, they won't let you take in a video camera. Most cameras these days have video recording anyway, so you'll be able to take some video anyway.

59b1fddc617491e538d31b5a8aa3904aaa	HD radio is not a better quality radio. The company that has the copyright on HD Radio has stated that the HD doesn't stand for high definition. it's just a "buzz" word , like "extreme"    "HD Radio" is the trademark for iBiquity's in-band on-channel (IBOC) technology, which was selected by the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) in 2002 as a digital audio broadcasting method for the United States.[2][3] According to iBiquity's website HD Radio is simply a brand name, although their earlier whitepaper documents refer to "Hybrid Digital" radio technology.[4] There is no connection with high-definition television (HDTV), except in the sense that both HDTV and HD Radio are digital formats.    So you would have to purchase a digital tuner , capable of recieving digital and analog.

ZyGyDLsDaa	"On the Street Where You Live" is sung by Freddy Eynsford-Hill (Jeremy Brett) as he stands outside Professor Henry Higgins' (Rex Harrison) home, hoping that Eliza Doolittle (Audrey Hepburn) will emerge so that he can talk to her again. He's a young man hopelessly and unrequitedly in love.    Here's the scene on YouTube:  http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DrY33J8qU...  If I recall correctly, Jeremy Brett had a ghost singer (Bill Shirley, per IMDb), as did Audrey Hepburn, whose singing was done by Marni Nixon, who also sang for Natalie Wood in "West Side Story" and for Deborah Kerr in "The King and I".      I love musicals, but I don't recall that song being used anywhere else though a girl could sing it as easily as a boy.|`|om4mEtBVaa	There was a guy singing it in the movie. he was all smitten with Audrey Hepburn's character. I don't know of any girls singing it so an internet search would be best.

PumYhJSvaa	A Time For Dancing.<br>  <br>  <br>  A girl with powerful dreams for her future may not have the chance to live them out in this drama based on the novel by Davida Wills Hurwin. Samantha (Shiri Appleby) and Juliana (Larisa Oleynik) are a pair of high-school students who have been close friends for years. Both girls share a love of dancing, but while the more introverted Samantha sees dancing as a hobby and little more, the outgoing and upbeat Juliana has a genuine gift and dreams of attending Julliard. Determined to achieve her dreams, Juliana sets her sights on her Julliard audition while removing all distractions from her life -- including her boyfriend Eli (Scott Vickaryous). Juliana's life is turned upside down, however, when she learns she's contracted cancer, but while she wants to attend Julliard as if nothing has changed, her parents (Peter Coyote and Patricia Kalember) are vehemently opposed to the idea. Meanwhile Samantha worries about what her isolated life will be like without her best friend. A Time for Dancing was the first dramatic feature from cinematographer and documentary filmmaker Peter Gilbert. ~ Mark Deming, All Movie Guide<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0242953/" rel="nofollow">http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0242953/</a><br>  <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0242953/usercomments" rel="nofollow">http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0242953/user...</a>|`|2g8m8USQaa	I thought it was Six Weeks at first...the girl did have cancer and was a dancer.

Girls that starve themselves don't have them.    @Asker: I had to look up the character, but I think she'd make a really good Joanna Dark (especially if the last two pictures are most accurate). Tell her to go for it. ^^ And I've ever been good at coming up with video game characters for people to be, so I can't really give any new ideas... >.>;;;|`|aHY3GHc2aa	Don't listen to those guys.

bribxhsdaa	"Someone in this section once said "Cypress Hill" are like a rock band who never made it" - That shaved like 20 points off my IQ...    I've also heard "If Tupac was so good, How come he got shot?" - That took about 15.     "Common sucks...He doesn't even talk about guns or anything" - At least 30.     But yours definitely takes the cake.. It simply re-affirms the idea that Eminem's fans (generally speaking) are almost as stupid as..IF not more stupid than Lil Wayne's fans. At least Lil Wayne's fans in most cases like rap period. That kinda statement is made by dudes who don't even listen to hip hop.     I won't bore you with the long list of MC's eminem has pulled style from directly but yeah..    The only redeeming quality to Eminems legions of fanboys is that Eminem can actually spit lyrics.     Dubya - Em dropped in 1996...Which probably makes the statement even worse come to think of it.|`|hpdZDBVQaa	Eminem is hardly anything to brag about. And this statement is dumb as dirt and dirt don't move. I would love to slap the back of the head of the person who said this.   Gimme Mine!|`|hBGZYDKAaa	That is ignorant because some of the best rappers ex. notorious B.I.G, tupac, and method man where around long before Eminem! Plus they are way better!|`|9f29214b43ea0ec7920b9578e8c01e82aa	What like everybody started selling more records?  That's simply untrue.|`|Yor2Vwk8aa	Yes It Is The Most Ignorant Statement Ever|`|AA11507540	Em coming into the game did not blow up Hip Hop, it just got more people who wouldn't listen to this genre, to start listening to it. Just like what Nelly did with Air forces. Everybody was already using them, but once Nelly put out that song it seemed as if the sneaker blew up because white america was now getting into it.|`|qpxPW5paaa	Maybe no the most ignorant ever but its pretty fuc/|`|bc92692e5171a576e30283eb2faec88eaa	I think there's a little bit of truth to that.    I mean, it had already blown up, but Eminem definitely expanded the fan base, and exposed more people to rap music    I don't know about that... For me, I started out listening to Eminem on the radio, but I went looking for more.    LOL Nooooooo not at all.  I'm just saying, the suburban white boys buying albums now are here because of Eminem, not because of Nas, Jay-Z, Biggie, etc.|`|BnTYoxUIaa	Who the phuck said that bullshit?|`|8XT1Tvcvaa	LOL...man, Em stans give all other white hip hop heads a bad name.|`|mBQQL0kCaa	he brought a lil life back|`|Q4zl7vRkaa	Wow, wtf?|`|066dbddb6348f26dd20544e15c95797caa	sounds like an another Eminem stan.|`|5b218420f6e58d52278efc9527f29a95aa	If Eminem blew it up at all, it was in a bad way. I'm white too, and I can write really controversial lyrics. BFD.    Yes, it is the most ignorant statement ever.|`|tz4jie2oaa	First guy is right, why do you think Eminem sells so much more, and is still considered "respected"  He has a whole nother white fan base.  He expaned rap, he didnt make it popular.|`|lMOXHh45aa	Yeah thats pretty dang ignorant... like sayin black history didn't matter till MLK or somethin. But I don't think the fact that it was Eminem helped any... you hate him don't you lol|`|UhtSE2B6aa	Yes, it's dumb...obviously the person doesn't know hip-hop. It reminds me of people saying rap/hip-hop didn't blow up in the West until 2Pac came out...just dumb!!|`|LldVBFEYaa	rap was big in the black community but eminem introduced the white upper class to the world of rap

I'd say he's on my Top Ten.|`|2bVxBCgzaa	Back in the 80's I thought he was amazing, because he played in what was then my favorite band. Now I think he is vasty overrated (and so is Metallica)- there are a million guys in bar bands that blow his doors off. He repeats the same licks over and over- his solo in The Day That Never Comes is a joke; it's so predictable and easy, and he is ripping off his own older solos. He was a small inspiration to my playing in my younger years, as was James. People only think he's so great because he plays in a famous band- if he'd stayed in Exodus, nobody would care.|`|CTQNPj56aa	he is a very good guitarist  in my opinion he is far better than Mustaine

But you know what?  I healed!    It took some time and effort on my part and it will on yours too.    Keeping myself busy and not home feeling sorry for myself was key.    I took tennis lessons, swimming lessons, exercised, downloaded music, went out with people A LOT and told myself that I will be just fine.  In time I saw that I was much better off and I don't regret that the relationship didn't work out!  Not even for one second.    Stinking thinking will keep you sad so much longer!

fGN3trHDaa	I take offense to this question!    By saying something like that is the same as saying all blondes are stupid. That is not true and neither is your question.  People are who they are raised to be. Scorpio people are often either confident or insecure. And they are only jealous when not emotionally sure about their current situation. Scorpios tend to hold grudges but are not resentful. I do not resent anyone I know of.    Please think before asking such an ignorant question next time  Thank you|`|6sAbs2iiaa	If there is a living God why go to the deads.

I'm really oblivious to when i'm flirting or just being nice. I honestly can't tell the difference, which i guess, is a BAD thing.  I would personally call myself a 3 or 4.  But since this boy came into my life, i guess i would say 7 or 8.    :]  what can i say? i am human, too.|`|McO0UUc2aa	if i'm with someone i really like, then i am a little bit. i'd say about a 4, because i always feel sort of stupid when i awkwardly make an attempt to flirt LOL|`|1MQmhFq3aa	nope
12QJ9QMRaa	Compton.    I am a 6'3" red-headed white dude, and I went down there at teh request of one of my buddys who came from the area.    Even WITH him there, I definitely did NOT feel exactly like I was fitting in, you know?      (As a Heavy Metal loving white kid from California Gangland, I can think of lots of similiar occasions, but I think that was probably the time i felt the most out of place.)|`|OXvH2CgLaa	Yea, my first concert! That was horrible! I just felt so weird but at the same time it felt so surreal that I was actually seeing a band play live. It was Halifax at the Metro in Chicago, it was insane how awkward I felt. I was confused as all hell in the mosh pit and I got hit in the head by a girl who was crowd surfing...*sigh* I'm so glad I have more experience NOW...this was like two years ago...I've been to many concerts since then =)    BQ: About 21 I'd say  BQ2: Umm... ... ... Somebody Save Me by Krypteria for FFAF|`|4bc3ee931fca2067bef8aafb614f2089aa	Just about everywhere I go, expect concerts.|`|MmbLWe3Qaa	There's this local coffeehouse that I used to go to every weekend for shows when it was pretty unheard of, about year or longer ago. Then they started playing the same bands over and over again, so I just stopped going. Then, about two weeks ago I went to a show because there was a lot more hype about the place. So I went, and it was all...the people there were not like me. I felt like I was purple. It sucked, I had a terrible time.   Ha.    BA: Like a million. I've been doing homework, and painting my room. Both of which practically require music.|`|DbtS5jzEaa	Ye man!    Whe my band plays gigs we are surrounded by Metalheads....us being a more...I dunno melodic Rock kinda band....I always feel out of place :( hehe    BQ: bout 20 I would say  BQ2: With You - Machinemade God for Stabbing the Drama :)|`|MwiBGBK1aa	Hey Doc. Yeah I've definitely felt that way, even among some of my friends. It's good to find a person or a few people you can rely on and have a strong sense of security with. But sometimes the world can feel like its changed and moved on without you. And maybe it has, but your mentality has changed also. I can be a pretty social person but I definitely can't fake an uncomfortable and awkward environment ... Am I getting off topic yet?     BA: I wish I counted. Went to this Mediterranean restaurant with some girlfriends today and in between the Mall and the car rides home I lost track of how many songs I heard :P  BA2: Tool - Right in Two to APC|`|yUnQahGoaa	Yes, I've felt like that esp at different shows it's like wtf? I've listened to at least 200 songs today and as for dedicating....well he isn't on my good side right now so I wouldn't :)|`|yZD0f5tzaa	Hah, you can say that again!    BQ: 48  BQ: "My Wife" by The Who...to uh..|`|vIgicm8kaa	Yea, My friend and I thought we were going to a battle of the bands at a local college but when we got there it was like a art/acoustic show with a bunch of legit hippies... we felt so awkward in that place    BQ - Probably 40|`|DibFrwxlaa	Yes.  I guess every teenager has that feeling of doubt and thinks that everyone is staring at them.  Thank god that's over with.    More recently I saw you answer a question about, "What has left you speechless?"  And you said the Giants playoff loss to the Eagles.  So I sent you an email basically bustin' your chops about the game and you wrote back something like "okaaay" and then I felt really stupid and out of place.  Sorry, I wasn't trying to be an obnoxious jerk, just breaking your balls a little.    Oh, and I've also definitely walked into various biker bars and felt very unwelcome.    BA: Maybe 20  BA2: I'm not sure I have any special contacts.  Nancy D and I got "married" though.|`|VvUxR6qRaa	sometimes, but good on ya.  good to know we don't all lose good music taste haha.    BA: at least 50  BA2: KOL - use somebody...... love ya babe|`|nYqtw9DWaa	Aww I'm sorry about that.  But yeah, I was at a concert with my friend of a band that I like but not love, there was a couple other bands playing.  It was a metal-ish concert I guess, but it was so loud and there were all these crazy people, idk I just felt really out of place.|`|3dpIt3PIaa	Oh, I hate that feeling, nostalgia. I do get that feeling at the playground. I wish I was a kid again... *sigh*  Yeah, I feel pretty out of place at school.     BQ: Wow, roughly 50. But I had one song on repeat SO many times  BQ2: The Kids Aren't Alright- Offspring to all of them. HA!|`|14F4WVQjaa	Yeah, I definitely know that feeling.     I was at a Bayside and Valencia concert a month ago and it was at a really crappy venue. It's probably the only venue that decent rock bands come to in Delaware, though, so when they get a good name, everyone goes.     But all the kids that normally hang out there are like 14 and "scene kids". I felt so awkward. But once the show started, I couldn't have cared less about those little hooligans lol : ]    BA: Probably 15-17. I was in school, so not so much time for music. Only on the drive home : /  BA2: I don't really know any of my contacts super personally. But I would dedicate "That's Not My Name" by The Ting Tings to Exemplar because we recently had a nice discussion about how people always spell our names wrong. : ]|`|9LdcBLuIaa	Yes. But then I didn't know it wasn't a nude beach.    BA: Dunno, maybe 30 or so?  BA2: Not applicable.|`|wk4EX0Zpaa	Yes, my BF and I are like the only cool people at our college, and today I started my Academic Support Seminar ( a class for people on academic probation) out of 10 people half were black athletes (no offense), 2 were lesbos, and the others were fat & smelly... it was awkward.|`|AA10796568	i hear ya...
qOKFuXfLaa	ash has had plastic surgery on her face ...     but ash is talking about jess' weight   and i agree with her - leave jess alone  many women die ... just because they want to be skinny  it's not funny|`|mZUXkeyRaa	Ashlee  She got her nose done  But she was talking about being skinny or fat  I say Good for her, for sticking up for her sis  People are soo damn rude  Jessica is NOT fat!|`|RLK401pgaa	yes, which is kinda hypocritical... but shes still right|`|4Ct2FpjOaa	I don't care if Ashlee had plastic surgery.....this message she sent out to everyone was just simply amazing for her to say. I didn't like her much before now but she has instantly become one of my heroes in the celebrity girl world. She is right, and I hope this lifts the self-doubt and low self-esteem on some people.    I agree with her, and people need to leave her sister alone. She is still a size 2. When you are that small its hard not to gain or lose weight.|`|AA10458230	Personally I think everyone who watches celebrities weights are a bunch of nut bags!  I think Ms Jessica is finally starting to look like a beautiful woman instead of a rail|`|b3da977d48fa97e4241d1e52ce22a323aa	Yes she did get a nose job ( i think) what she was doing was sticking up for people criticizing her sister..When Ashlee had plastic surgery, she was ding it for HERSELF and because of what she thought about her appearances and that is different from what other people think of her appearances and typically if someone in your family is being picked on like jessica, you should stick up for them...even if you are being hypocritical..

It also helps to learn an instrument, like piano or guitar.|`|z6qIZRFFaa	you should do warm ups, before you start singing. Sing on a loo and start at as high as you can go and down to low as you can.     And when you are singing just try to listen to yourself, so you aren't flat or sharp.     And don't abuse your voice my screaming, and excessive coughing|`|khJYKSUraa	do karaoke   it will probably work|`|Czd4OKHOaa	Use the advice given by Simon in American Idol.|`|wscyjkPAaa	Practice, make sure you have good posture, sing from your diaphragm.

Get a keyboard and practice hitting notes.  Unless you're super talented there's really no way going around voice lessons.|`|0WF5HR2Eaa	You need good technique training. You really do need singing lessons to get the best out of this, but there are programs you can buy. Try  Bob Tasman-Smith this one is excellent. From beginner to advanced.  good luck

bgKa2aV6aa	my best friend since 4th grade has been acting that way lately. when i get new clothes or a haircut she tlks about sumthing she supposedly is getting and doesnt say nething about mine. rolls her eyes when anyone else compliments me, and tries to make everyone like her more. she constantly tlks about how her skin is lighter, and doesnt tlk about hair cuz she likes mine more. i think it may be insecurity. im going to have a tlk with her soon. maybe u shld do the same wiht ur friend.|`|AdGcqzwXaa	she isnt your friend|`|s6YmIgQHaa	There are lots of people like that especially females, best to avoid them.

Wow, um, I would just do it anyway, and ask them why|`|7f2GSDmqaa	Or a friend that laughs at your downfalls?    I had one like that, and I no longer associate with him. Its best that way. Isnt a friend supposed to be supportive and like you for you no matter what? Try to help you when things go all wrong? This is why Im a loner|`|WItdtl0Vaa	I would not call them my friend.|`|BqnGVUNkaa	Then he/she wouldn't be my friend.|`|11i6bPdyaa	Fudge It|`|52uOJ4D5aa	Not a friend.

NO ONE should concentrate on THINGS .. they should be more concerned about how the person feels, that they are TRUE Friends .. and MORE Than just a surface .. more than material things .. a HUMAN with Feelings, thoughts, emotions .. someone who is INTELLIGENT and treats others with respect.    2.  This is NOT a friend at all .. this is a callous jerk (when they laugh at downfalls).    3.  This is jealousy -- and .. again, are they REALLY Friends .. or is this a matter of control/manipulation -- are they showing that they do NOT Care about you -- but only want you around to satisfy some "whim"?|`|xUuxzzTqaa	Well last time I had a friend who had had a friend whose friend was a friend of mine and they said that I said that my friend was not my friend because of what my friend's friend said to my friends. It was a good day.|`|FFrUZAoraa	I would think they are jealous|`|B5KR2Yjlaa	I'd think that this person is weird first of all, and has some jealousy issues if they get unhappy when I socialize with other people. And also not a good friend and mean because they laugh at my downfalls  I would not think of this person as my friend.|`|IqoRBVUTaa	Maybe they have no confidence in them selves, so they make you feel like nothing and bring you down, so that they can rise up. Get it?|`|wzQWio5Taa	sounds like my best friend lol simple answer. he/she is insecure about themselves an/or jealous of you.

WNzBmpyraa	Hamsters like to stay awake all night and sleep during the day...and I had read in a book somewhere that if a mother has babies, the father should be put in a separate cage because the father hamsters tend to attack the babies. Hamsters are similar to squirrels and chipmunks in that they stuff and store their food in their cheeks and then hide them away for when they get hungry.|`|c4225d9583bacc6aaa33ccf6f6ca917aaa	they are a delicacy in zimbabwe.. i went there|`|OUAtUKZ1aa	They are rats!|`|fyHlrXkeaa	they are very cute fury and tiny type of mammals they come in different colours. you can get them in stores and they are easy to take care of you just buy a food, water and a cage.|`|HsIHsjLSaa	Hamsters are the third most commonly used laboratory animal. In 1998, 1 million were killed in the USA alone.|`|UI9ckLmEaa	Hamsters are rodents belonging to the subfamily Cricetinae. The subfamily contains about 18 species, classified in six or seven genera.    The name hamster is derived from the German word Hamstern, itself from earlier OHG hamustro, from ORuss chomstor, which is either a blend of the root of Russ khomiak "hamster" and a Baltic word (cf. Lith staras "hamster")[1] or of Iranian origin (cf. Av hamastar "oppressor")[2].    Behavior can vary depending on their environment, genetics, and interaction with people. Because they are easy to breed in captivity, hamsters are often used as lab animals in more economically developed countries. Hamsters have also become established as popular small pets.    Hamsters are crepuscular. In the wild, they burrow underground in the daylight to avoid being caught by predators. Contrary to popular belief they are not a nocturnal animal. Their diet contains a variety of foods, including dried food, berries, nuts, fresh fruits and vegetables. In the wild they will eat any wheat, nuts and small bits of fruit and vegetables that they might find lying around on the ground, and will occasionally eat small insects such as small crickets or mealworms. They have elongated fur-lined pouches on both sides of their heads which extend to their shoulders, which they stuff full of food to be brought back to the colony or to be eaten later.  i like hamsters....

That much shouldn't belong to one person, the owner can learn not to carry that much money around!|`|bcNCTf0zaa	bury it. and slowly dig it up and remove ten thousand dollars at a time. until I am wealthy, then, I would bring it all out and invest it in different places.|`|ik8Y15FCaa	if i said donate it to poor  i would be straight up lying  i keep all of it  finders keepers *********|`|U5ZOkDj6aa	fulfill my life dreams, go on a shopping spree, definitely donate some to charity, help out people who are less fortunate than i am. i would donate 5 billion or more to JDRF (Juvenile Diabetes Research Foundation). by best friend has diabetes and my grandpa died from it. it would be very important to me to find a cure. if i had that much money i would get a good education but then spend my time volunteering and helping make the world a better place. if i had 30 billion dollars i wouldn't be working lol. so i'd hav a lot of free time.|`|Hzf3QK9faa	I would pay off all of our bills, thank God that my husband could retire from his job! Move where we would rather live but somewhere comfortable for us and our animals, not wildly outlandish, I would help all of the people that have helped us, I would help out family especially grand kids. I would donate money to help in various countries we are aware that need help but we'd oversee how it's done not just handing over to some group that uses over half on a paying a huge employee base. We would travel a few times a year and have fun being those people who randomly give people money everywhere they go. We would keep very little for ourselves and just have fun giving to others.

NC67WVlEaa	I like Amnesiac. It's artistic and very different. It's not my favorite album of theirs but, I like it.  BQ: Nirvana (as you can probably tell)|`|ssoZ33XIaa	It's not my favorite Radiohead album, but I do like it.  At the moment, I'm liking "Life in s Glass House" and "Knives Out" off of Amnesiac.  It is probably my least listened to Radiohead album thus far though.    BA: My favorite band is Saves the Day.|`|VvUxR6qRaa	i really like amnesiac.  each to their own i guess:)  (i am loving In Rainbows album )    BA: Pearl Jam|`|NourECCgaa	i personally think it has its downfalls.... it feels like a b side album and technically it really is.... it has some good tracks (life in a glass house, like spinning plates) but as an album overall it doesnt flow nearly as well as others. and it has always been in the giant shadow of kid a... the album where radiohead defined themselves for the third time.  BQ: haha either than radiohead... umm i cant really choose but its somewhere between the flaming lips, tool, sonic youth, and NiN( mostly just because of ghosts).    And everyone knows radiohead are the band that have never had a bad album! not even near a failure!    Btw street spirit add me to your contacts, we basically have identical taste in music.|`|RaRE8gKqaa	Amnesiac is great not exactly their best, but they are a hard band to get into, a little complex, which is good. :) Pyrmaid song is the best from that album.     BA: Green Day and Muse|`|vOPZXZ8taa	Amnesiac is like the "Chinese Democracy" for Radiohead minus the 15 year wait.    Don't get me wrong, I love Radiohead. Good thing they came back with such a strong album like "In Rainbows"      BQ: U2.|`|HEk3kBZ4aa	i dont think Amnesiac is one of their best work its kinda dull...the only good songs on that album is knives out and i might be wrong    BA:muse,interpol,the ghost frequency,iamx ,i monster,placebo,thehorrors|`|MmbLWe3Qaa	Not near their best. But "failure" might be extreme.    BA: Pixies.|`|1C78irCHaa	nah never really listened to them  BQ: Mindless self indulgence, rage against the machine, panic at the disco...|`|Ef83kV3Qaa	I like their other stuff much better.    I'm a Seether fan|`|lP9kQmRraa	I don't necessarily like Amnesiac but its kinda unfair to judge it because I haven't put in a lot of listening time.  Like Spinning Plates is a good song tho.  I think its also very hard to follow such a masterpiece as Kid A.    My fav band right is The Dave Matthews Band    And my favorite Smashing Pumpkins song is Geek USA.  The drums are insane!
4KTe107Yaa	Foggy night I was driving and crossed over train tracks and as soon as I was on the other side I saw a train go by in my rearview mirror. Inches away|`|VxtGzt6Caa	Naw. But considering when I was about 11 or 12, when I dived into a pool with my life jacket on, and didn't come back up until 5 seconds, I don't know. It was scary though.|`|dRWDV6Rlaa	i was attacked by a squirrel  sounds crazy but its so true    lol now that i think about its hilarious xD|`|eKuvx6f8aa	yes|`|d0b19b6e53bf5f04f7ade24285468c28aa	yes|`|eOkohAMXaa	I had a rly bad bike accident a few years ago.  i ripped ALL the skin off my left arm, both knees, and chin, broke my right wrist, and my nose was rly scraped up. i had holes ripped through the palms of both my riding gloves, and my helmit front was COMPLETELY flat.  if i hadn't had it on my head would have been what was competely flat. not good.  i'm a pretty serious rider, but that was the worst accident i was ever in  it was at yellowstone too, and we couldn't get hardly any medical supplies.|`|kmPLOi5Yaa	Everyday is a near death experience.

It hurt.|`|FclALaVSaa	a few.  when i was 4 i fell into the deep end as well, but, i didnt know what to do so i was just there, with my hands at my side until someone realized i was drowing and my dad jumped in to save me. (:  like 2 months ago this jerk that im kind of friends with but i secretly hate him was like are you pregnant? and we were walking down the stairs and i was like erm... no. so he pushed me. if i wasnt holding on to the railing i probably would have died because my hand slipped and stuff, so, yeah. that was fun.|`|J0G4lRrNaa	Haha that's funny I am glad your okay:)!    Yea like 2 months ago in a snowstorm I was walking home on the road ( I live in a small town so everyone does), and a car didn't see me, and I didn't hear it because I was listening to my Ipod.

ZyGyDLsDaa	I used to attend movies by myself all of the time. If I could go to a movie theater, I still would be attending by myself. I get to sit where I want, I can focus completely on the movie, I don't have to put up with trips to the concession stand, etc. I love being by myself and usually sat third or fourth row, center of the row. Most of the time, this is fairly empty, which is a plus.     If you're uncomfortable about the time until the movie starts, take a magazine or a book. You even could listen to some music through headphones if you'd like. You'll be surprised how relaxing that time to yourself can be.    Major perk: BOTH armrests are yours!|`|P2BjtJnUaa	no, who cares?|`|f6fCixDnaa	How about go with a brother or sister? Or maybe one of your parents?  Im sure they wouldnt mind.    If none of them wanna go then stuff what everyone else thinks, your allowed to do and see what you like and shouldnt need an accomplice do everything, you want to see a movie before it leaves and most likely by the sounds of it..its leaving soon. So it prob wont be very full anyways :)|`|nmbbG0vdaa	go with your mom|`|lAP3UC79aa	no brothers, sisters or cousin's?|`|nci2WOYXaa	no, do the matinee during the day.

Richardson (the Big Bopper) is sadly underrated and forgotten (much like the way Cowboy Copas and Hawkshaw Hawkins are in the country music version of "the day the music died" -- they are usually referred to as the people who "died in a plane crash with Patsy Cline," and Richardson is "the guy who died in a plane crash with Buddy Holly and Richie Valens").  He was a great songwriter, and I feel that's really been forgotten over the years.    And, honestly, there's no telling where rock & roll would've gone if Buddy Holly would have lived to enjoy a long career.  Consider that Elvis was "out of commission" (he was in the Army at the time), so Holly was pretty much the premiere rock and roll artist at the time.  You can see that rock slid into a pop syrup mushy mess for a few years after Holly's death.|`|vlIXsFmhaa	The day the first Jobros album came out|`|bWI43goqaa	no,    but im aware that its bullsh*t!    haha C-Dub!!!! i agree man!|`|MwSaCettaa	Yes....& I say...

eL50bmu1aa	I think one factor needs to be recognized and I'll say it right now- they are the only German band that ISN'T METAL to make it big in America...that says something right there.      I have to add that a lot of European music is better than a lot of American mainstream music. It just sounds....idk...more creative...better quality...just better! It's more satisfying than most of America's emotionless, copy-cat-of-the-last-band sound.|`|kHY0eMVraa	Yes I think they have & that's awesome!!!  Who is Cinema Bizarre?|`|AA10368887	Yes, they have paved away for future transsexual/gender neutral/sex change bands|`|8jxoTBWIaa	I completely agree. I think that other bands see that its possible to make it in America just like Tokio Hotel. Especially bands like Cinema Bizarre. They look and sound different than anything American. So I think that they see that Tokio Hotel made it so, they should be able to too.     And to the girl above me? Go away. =]|`|yJQzjjkvaa	i like seeing bands other than american ones making it into the spotlight, becasue it seems like we have it allllll the time.

Mah1BetPaa	Best thing you can do is post it... if you're any good, the hits will cause a buzz and they'll find YOU. Send out a mass email to your friends and family with the link and ask them to send out a mass email, etc to help you out with the hits. The more hits, the more you'll be a featured video and someone will hear about it who knows the right someone. Seriously though... if you're any good. Ask for feedback from people who don't know you. You're mom's opinion doesn't count. Good luck :-)|`|EzJQRCXbaa	AND U TELLING ME SHAME FOR MY QUESTION THAT I ASKED.. LOOK HOW MANY PEOPLE ANSWERED URS...  FEEL SHAME!

You Know you're at a Ghetto Funeral  ....          If 3 generations get out of a car to beat down someone for cutting into the funeral procession.     If you got relatives coming in shackled from the state pen to pay their respects.     A fist fight breaks out.     When people are breaking down crying and trying to climb into the casket.     When the dead person is wearing $3,000 worth of jewelry.     When friends and family wear T-shirts with a photo of the deceased on it..to the funeral!    When the brothas are standing' around drinking' after the service and someone pours a lil' supmtin' out on the ground for the homey who's no longer with us."     When one of the relatives keeps fainting before, during and after the service.     When everybody is trying to get the flowers and take them home.     When the dinner after the funeral turns into a family reunion, all the old folk break out the cards to play spades/tonk, somebody start playing some Marvin Gaye, and all the older men start talking about how they used to pimp back in the day.     When the obituary was made on a home typewriter and it's filled with misspelled words...even the name of the deceased!     When the picture on the obituary is the deceased license photo!     When everybody trying to out cry one another as if whoever cries the loudest is going to get a prize after the funeral...     If the deceased didn't have 2 nickels to rub together but leaves the world in a $15,000 silk lined coffin.     When the soloist sings about 15 verses of "Precious Lord" or "His eye is on the sparrow" and "I won't complain."     When the funeral is two weeks after the death.|`|pOYsO3xzaa	how did michael jacson get food poisioning. he was sucking 11 year old nuts.........|`|SCpaqwQZaa	I don't know any good funny jokes, but I hope you cheer up!

They are met by a group of savage cannibal islanders. The cannibals, like anybody, enjoy a good laugh, so they give the men a challenge. If they failed, they would be eaten. If they succeeded, they would be allowed to use a radio the islanders had to call for help.    The cannibals tell them to go into the forest, and pick 10 pieces of the same fruit.    The first man comes out of the forest holding ten oranges. The cannibals tell them he is to shove them up his rectum, and he was not to make a noise. The man, appalled but longing to be set free, does what they say. He gets to 3, and srceams. He is quickly killed and eaten by the islanders.    Now the second man emerges from the tangle of branches and vines carrying 10 wild strawberries. He too is told of what he has to do. He gets to seven, then starts cracking up. He is eaten.    Up in Heaven, the two men are sitting down to a game of cards when the first man asks,"Why did you laugh?" The second man responds with a grin,"I saw the other guy coming with ten pineapples!"    Hope this cheers you up. :)|`|rrYR0RQsaa	go to chucknorrisfacts.com for like 9 pages of chuck norris jokes|`|t043WEDIaa	I love Chuck Norris jokes!

WIczM4URaa	boxing match? joke    the scorpio has his stingers while the bull has his two horns, both sides ready for action.    scorpio and taurus are generally incompatible because both are strong dominating independent thinking signs - lots of ego clash. the only way it will work is for one sign to  willingly take the back seat.    that they both possess strong will power is both their friend and foe. they can either hang tough together or try blast each other to submission.    both are also very passionate so they must find common ground to have union in living. usually sexual attraction leads them to each other and material things like work pursuit keeps them busy.     but essentially, they have very different outlooks in life so it will not qualify as a relationship made in heaven and achieving full happiness will be elusive. but if the physical attraction to each other is irresistible, it may work. against all odds is what both signs are made for.|`|ykIleAQ7aa	Yes they can be. They are in each others houses of marriage.   Its always good to look at the complete chart to determine how compatible the two can be.|`|8ZUVToXgaa	I think we can be too. Had a friend who was a Scorpio (female) and I'm the Taurus (male) and on the zodiac chart we are opposites.    But she really kept things interesting. We both loved to just hang out and sing together.....it used to be so awesome.    I reminisce too much. ;_;

He had the balls to come, the gall to die and then forgive us!  No, I don't wonder why, I wonder what he thought it would get us.   Hey, hey, good bye  Tomorrow wendy's  going to die    Hey, hey, good bye  Tomorrow wendy's going to cry  Tomorrow wendy's going to cry    Only God says jump  So I set the time  cause if he ever saw it  It was through these eyes of mine!  And if he ever suffered it was me who did his crying    Hey hey, good bye  Tomorrow wendy's going to cry  (tomorrow wendy's going to die)  Tomorrow wendy's going to die  (tomorrow wendy's going to cry)  Tomorrow wendy is going to die    Hey, hey, good bye  Tomorrow wendy is going to die    (Don't know if these are my all time favorite lyrics...but today I really like them!)|`|NourECCgaa	I Slipped Away  I Slipped On A Little White Lie   We've Got Heads On Sticks  You've Got Ventriloquists  We've Got Heads On Sticks  You've Got Ventriloquists     Standing In The Shadows At The End Of My Bed  Standing In The Shadows At The End Of My Bed  Standing In The Shadows At The End Of My Bed  Standing In The Shadows At The End Of My Bed     Rats And Children Follow Me Out Of Town  Rats And Children Follow Me Out Of Their Homes  Watch It    creepy lyrics... especially the way his voice is done over.. song is kid a by radiohead... i think the song is about a series of murders in london.|`|vIgicm8kaa	Alice in Chains - Nutshell    My gift of self is raped  My privacy is raked  And yet I find  And yet I find  Repeating in my head  If I can't be my own  I'd feel better dead    ... gives me the chills|`|FTs2py0kaa	Harvest Moon  Come a little bit closer  Hear what I have to say  Just like children sleepin  We could dream this night away.    But theres a full moon risin  Lets go dancin in the light  We know where the musics playin  Lets go out and feel the night.    Because Im still in love with you  I want to see you dance again  Because Im still in love with you  On this harvest moon.    When we were strangers  I watched you from afar  When we were lovers  I loved you with all my heart.    But now its gettin late  And the moon is climbin high  I want to celebrate  See it shinin in your eye.    Because Im still in love with you  I want to see you dance again  Because Im still in love with you  On this harvest moon|`|KVfxa6Coaa	I've learned to let go  Come on    Here's a middle finger  Coming straight from oca-l-a  I appreciate your judgement  it's proved that I can't trust a word you say  those must be some pair of binoculars  that you see every move I make  so I'll never be a liar   but you'll always be two-faced    You'll get what's coming to you  You're blinded by your instincts  I'm not your ******* game  I'm not so easily beat    I'm looking down at this mess that you've made  and I can't believe that I stayed  So unhappy for so long  Where did I go wrong?  I've got to get out of this  my hand is on the handle  We're leaving everything behind  Goodbye for a lifetime    I'll rip that scandalous ***** in two  We'll bring the noise    Try to pretend that I never even knew your name  'cause everything you are disgusts me  (Too bad I can't turn back time)  So I wouldn't be here  what I'd give for you to disappear  so tell me girly how's your edge?    You've got nothing better to do  I know why you can't see straight  I thought you were better than this  but you're just like everyone else    I'm looking down at this mess that you've made  and I can't believe that I stayed  So unhappy for so long  Where did I go wrong?  I've got to get out of this  my hand is on the handle  We're leaving everything behind  Goodbye for a lifetime    I'll make my stand  right here with my friends  I'll make my stand  right here with my friends  I'll make my stand  right here with my friends  I'll make my stand  right here with my friends  I'll make my stand  right here with my friends    Get low  Now I know who my friends are  I'm never coming home|`|wA8Dyhq7aa	My three favorite lines from songs:    Like a fiend with his dope  And a drunkard his wine  A man will have lust  For the lure of the mines  ("Dark as a Dungeon," Merle Travis)    I'm too old to die young  And too young to die now  ("Bed of Coals," Warren Zevon & T-Bone Burnett)    I drove around the block till I was dizzy  Each time the noise came louder from within  And then I saw our bottle there beside me  And I drank a fifth of courage and walked in  ("The Cold Hard Facts of Life," Bill Anderson)|`|DbtS5jzEaa	It was in the march of the winter I turned seventeen  That I bought those pills  I thought I would need  And I wrote a letter to my family  Said it's not your fault  And you've been good to me  Just lately I've been feeling  Like I don't belong  Like the ground's not mine to walk upon  And I've heard that music  Echo through the house  Where my grandmother drank  By herself  And I sat watching a flower  As it was withering  I was embarrassed by its honesty  So I'd prefer to be remembered as a smiling face  Not this ******* wreck  That's taken its place    So please forgive what I have done  No you can't stay mad at the setting sun  Cause we all get tired, I mean eventually  There is nothing left to do but sleep    But spring came bearing sunlight  Those persuasive rays  So I gave myself a few more days  My salvation it came, quite suddenly  When Justin spoke very plainly  He said "Of course it's your decision,  But just so you know,  If you decide to leave,  Soon I will follow"    I wrote this for a baby  Who has yet to be born  My brother's first child  I hope that womb's not too warm  Cause it's cold out here  And it'll be quite a shock  To breathe this air  To discover loss  So I'd like to make some changes  Before you arive  So when your new eyes meet mine  They won't see no lies  Just love.  Just love.

KLNLfYQeaa	they originally said they'd only pick one person then that person would pick who they wanted to be with. But since Trevor and Rebekah are the 2 finalists, who knows.     If it's Trevor, he'll have to pick whichever one he likes more, probably the one he said "I love you" to.   If Rebekah [or however] she'll obviously pick the one who her son likes, which was Vicky, leaving Rikki to be alone, or pick Trevor, if he wants her.|`|dsf5hGGnaa	They are so annoying and sickening I dont know why anyone would like them.

It's pretty ridiculous.   But they each are going to choose one person.

6WCLyLrraa	The only differences between these two is the   of inputs each one has. The ux2 has an extra mic port with phantom power and more line in's port other than that there pretty much the same because you still have the same   of amp models and effects to choose from in each one. And yes both comes with abeleton lite recording but I think it's only a demo.

S71MT9USaa	It is a job that is not too difficult but does require a certain amount of skill. The lightning bolts (or whatever else you might choose) are called inlays. The fingerboard has to be routed out to the exact shape of the new inlays. Then the inlays are glued into the routed out holes to fit and the fingerboard refinished. Inlays themselves are not awfully expensive, if you can find premade ones you like. The cost of custom made ones and the labor (if you choose not to do it yourself) will be much higher.   I'll put in whatever links I can find below to help with supplies and/or info.
SzvP4VGaaa	I would very much doubt it.  I work at a United Video and our chain won't be getting that movie until 12 March which likely means that is when it is being released in zone 4 for dvd.  It has been out in zone 1 (USA) for months at least, but we're way behind here.|`|f610fce787e6299e681ff222a3173ed5aa	Try JB HiFi or Marbecks or Real Groovy.  All of them order from overseas for you.  I saw it at the Auckland film festival last year but I think it's only on at the cinemas under general release now.  Also try Borders on Queen St, Auckland.

pW3qOiRVaa	Its probably a mix of all three.  A lot of them are just doing it for the attention// publicity.   Then again, some of the are terrible singers but they actually think they sound good! Its pretty intense.  I would say a lot of the really really bad people are just doing it for the show.. and so they can say "I tryed out for AI!!  or they dont care if people laugh at them?  I bet a lot of them are delusional too, because maybe they really need or want the money and think they actually have a chance!|`|XxtwbxkIaa	Before they see Simon Randy and Paula they have to go through other judges; and sometimes they lie and tell them what great voices they have JUST so when they see the real judges, they can humiliate them for the ratings.    It's a sick thing to do, but some people are just mean human beings|`|Whj6KC6Jaa	yeah, like the person said before, there are put through other judges that tell them they are "great" and will win. horrible. but fun to watch.sometimes.|`|RtHBnYSmaa	I'd go with they're delusional or putting us on. I used to think I could sing, but when I heard my voice through a speaker, I accepted the fact that I am not. I wouldn't consider myself tone-deaf, though. When I listen to others sing, I can tell when they are hitting the notes or not. I just can't when I sing to myself.

There was a period where I was obsessed with all those British post-punk revival bands (Kaiser Chiefs, The Libertines, Franz Ferdinand, Arctic Monkeys, The Fratellis)<br>  <br>  Oh, and not to be rude, but what are you trying to say?  Not all Americans listen to crap music : )  In fact, my favorite bands are all from the UK (The Cure, Depeche Mode, Siouxsie & the Banshees)|`|LRLu1ofNaa	Yeah, I do.|`|ENkFZhlraa	The Kaisers Chiefs did name their band after a baseball team, I think called the Kaizer Chiefs.<br>  <br>  Actually surprisingly I discovered recently a lot of people in Ireland though havn't actually heard of the chiefs. I mean people know there songs like Ruby and I Predict a Riot but then they wouldn't even know the Kaiser Chiefs sang them.<br>  <br>  I also thought they had at least six songs that everyone just knew but a ton of people only knew one or two - I couldn't believe all this!|`|7OuNY2q9aa	Kaiser Cheifs sound like a minor league baseball team

rVq9Ol9caa	maximum    8+7+6+5+4+3+2+1 = 36|`|jIufI9Zaaa	(don't you mean minimum?)  maximum could be 8!  (8! means 8x7x6x5x4x3x2x1 which is 40320)    or 8x8 + 7x7 + 6x6 + 5x5 + 4x4 + 3x3 + 2x2 + 1x1  which is 168, this would be done by handing out keys one by one by one testing on door then switching    36 would be the minimum with the keys not needing to be switched each time. Keys wouldn't need full rotation each time so max lies in between 36 and 168.|`|tKb7i5jtaa	36

tuATxHsVaa	Yes, I too  noticed that you are bowing quite near to the fingerboard. It's a rather bad habit. 'Nuff on that.    And of course I agree that you are performing too much work in string crossings. This will tire you out in some pieces and also increase the likelihood that you will make unwanted bow noises - etc.     The orchestra is playing way too loudly and drowning out the soloists. Listen to how quiet the orchestra is during the solo passages vs. tutti passages in this recording featuring the master Oistrakh:    http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJgUFXz3V...    As the concertmaster/soloist you should be beating the conductor with your stick and telling him that his orchestra is too loud. You are the soloist, not him. You are the concertmaster and this is your duty.    Something else that I noticed after listening several times - you lower your volume radically at about 2:23 (way too much, it becomes almost inaudible) and then it seems like you are going to crescendo but you don't really ever crescendo back up to the level that you started at. Maybe this has something to do with the recording technology on the camera - it's quite imperfect after all.     It's impossible to rate your performance since very little of it actually came through on the recording medium.     To answer your question more directly, yes - it looks like your violin playing is "good." I just wish I could have actually heard more of it. The second solo passage that you perform is impossible to evaluate. Do you have any other recordings I could listen to?    You have a teacher, right? =).|`|5ekdVDQXaa	es, you are pretty good. Two things two work on though:    First, I think you need to work on playing closer to the bridge. It's pretty hard to see in that YouTube video, but it appears that you're playing over the finger board quite a bit (nice strait bow though!). Playing closer to the bridge is especially important in an orchestra setting like this where you need a lot of sound.    Secondly, you're using your right forearm WAY more than you need to. All those string crossings can be done more efficiently with your wrist. Do some exercises to work on bow arm fingers and wrist coordination.    If and when you consider college, if you're still doing violin, consider applying to Lawrence University. You appear to be a very talented young musician.    Cheers ~D|`|26d3xsUNaa	sounds really good,bet you really are a good violin player.

p0Czplkkaa	Dear Mr. Rogers,     I'd like to ask you a few questions! My name is Sally, and I really love your show. First, are King Friday and his wife and little boy and all the animals in make believe extra terrestrial? Also, how can Daniel live in a grandfather clock? Is it like an apartment down there? Second, do you own a car? My mommy says that basically everyone has a car, but I have never seen you drive one! Third, How many jackets do you have? My big sister Anna has been counting all of the different jackets you put on every day, and I can't even count to the number she came up with! Fourth, is it always a beautiful day in your neighborhood? What if there is a tsunami? My sister came up with that question! Fifth, My daddy's birthday is coming up! Where can I get the penny loafers you always wear? They're really shiny! Sixth, what is Mr. McFeely's first name? My little brother thinks it Ferdanand, but I think that name is too silly! Seventh, can you count to twenty? I can! I just learned to yesterday! Bye Mr. Rogers, I love you!

0b4636305e45b187a8f16d18854d3459aa	I would guess you listen to talk radio by choice. I an the other hand get up listening to country music. And country music is very much in demand. USA      * Have a Good Day *               ~ Don ~

1eb4856ca6dd666139688d5134e04f8daa	Well I have both really.     I have a crappy Fender Strat, an acoustic spanish guitar my grandfather made, and an Epiphone signature series Chet Atkins (collectible) that plays either way. If I had the $$$ I'd get a Gibson Les Paul or a Jackson Kelly, but that's just out of preference.    We are a guitar family, and what I can tell you from experience is that you don't just pick out a pretty looking guitar. It has to feel right when you hold it, and it has to sound flawlessly when you play it. I've been offered expensive guitars at half-price and turned them down because they sounded like crap.    Another thing you need to consider when buying acoustic is the bridge. Look at it carefully and make sure it doesn't look like a crappy block of wood attached to the body. You don't want that thing to fall apart on you after purchase; they're supposed to last. The body has to be built tough. So no weird cracks or gaps in the construction or else it's crap.    For an electric, get something preferably with a Floyd Rose bridge, so you can adjust it from down there instead of at the tuning pegs. Too much tweaking there and you end up with many snapping strings. Sometimes it can't be helped as instruments sound low in cold weather so you gotta tune higher. A guitar tuner is a necessity unless you are born with a musical ear, and this is rare.    Electric strings come in diff. gauges and that affects sound too. Remember to replace those strings every so often 'cuz they do get rusty and no good. They also grate your fingers as you begin learning- this can't be helped. Developing calluses as a result is normal. Acoustic uses nylon strings so it's a bit diff. You'll need to invest in several guitar picks 'cuz you break them or lose them easily.    Also, you can invest in a whammy bar or some distortion pedals optional- I got a decent Boss pedal for $35 when I bought my strat yrs ago. Always purchase from actual guitar players beause they know their s***; clerks know nothing. You're really gonna have to go in person to a store and try out a couple until you realize what you're comfortable with. And ask the guy behind the counter to try it out for you, he'll know what's good and won't bs you.
K5DdFEtJaa	im sorry-buckcherry
HK00RPDtaa	I'm in AP classes too, and I usually listen to something mellow so I can still concentrate on my work. Recently I've been listening to Unplugged in New York by Nirvana. It helps because I need a little white noise in the background, but it's not too loud to distract me from my work. Plus it's a great album!|`|ZII6YCk1aa	Away From the Sun by 3 Doors Down  Goodbye Tonight by Lost Prophets, actuakky im listening to them right now.  http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EoQBe82aV...|`|MmbLWe3Qaa	Whoa, that's crazy. I'm listening to Explosions in the Sky and just taking a break from homework right now. Weird!|`|rXlyHk1Raa	I'm doing homework while listining to Pantera|`|5uzHW4CYaa	I listen to classical music, any kind of symphony and a lot of instrumental.  It lets my mind expand and I don't get distracted my any kind of words.|`|YlCgMDVwaa	Mathcore!    haha, I had to.  But seriously, I don't have school anymore.|`|jRUGj2fsaa	I always hook my ipod up to my stereo or ipod dock so I dont get annoyed with headphones in my ears. Then I put it on a playlist or artist so I don't have to get up and change it all the time. And i keep it low so I don't get TOO distracted.  I've never heard of those bands... sorry but I usually listen to the beatles when I do homework :) or Frank Sinatra|`|M7E1uIsKaa	Mostly pantera, Hendrix, Led Zeppelin and Bob Marley.. Depending what kind of mood Im in|`|RVcgyeoXaa	Stuff Like  -Radiohead  -Fleet Foxes  -Nirvana  -The Killers|`|5b218420f6e58d52278efc9527f29a95aa	I listen to just about anything on my playlist, but Pinback is especially good because it's really mellow and rolls along without being too distracting. Tortoise is good too because it's all instrumental. Personally, my focus is really narrow and if I'm singing along to music (which I can't help but do) then I'm not working.    Call me lame, but sometimes hardcore studying calls for classical.|`|vlIXsFmhaa	idk but I have a five page essay to write due tomorrow :)|`|S2ByqJSmaa	I usually listen to movie soundtracks, like Master and Commander or Hidalgo. Sometimes I'll listen to Lord of the Rings.    Purely orchestral/instrumental music helps me concentrate better.|`|TY96YpbZaa	LMFAO, there a awesome techno/hip hop band.|`|lVxhiMopaa	Well, When I actually do my homework at home I'll listen to some soft stuff like Shinedown.|`|tx2lX6Rfaa	i usually listen to radiohead or the jefferson airplane.  pretty different but :)|`|Ng0oiFvhaa	well i listen to rock music during my homework:p....but dont try it so much it will make u loose ur mind and forget all ur homework..lool|`|S2aiYm3xaa	I listen to some Fujifabric.|`|aufhgg5xaa	I made a www.finetune.com playlist I recoment it's easy and you discover new bands.    Here's my Classic Rock Playlist  http://www.finetune.com/playlist/2302430|`|bwPgXAwSaa	Bach's Goldberg Variations|`|wk4EX0Zpaa	Usually Jimi Hendrix, SRV, Def Leppard, Tom Petty, Bryan Adams, or my boyfriend serenading me lol.    Are you in college or highschool AP classes?      Edit: oh and I also listen to the WoW Wrath of the Lich King soundtrack , so nerdy haha|`|vIgicm8kaa	Alice in Chains, Mad Season, Jimi Hendrix|`|CaYqzlcGaa	techno, trance, hardstyle, jump, nustyle, like noisecontrollers, headhunterz, dj panda, dj dean, Armin2 etc...|`|f948d748facdf196074d849ea9c465c4aa	Normally the same bands i normally listen to but their more mellow stuff, like Alice In Chains jar of flies.    The only thing i cant listen to when doing homework is songs i have never heard before because they distract me.     Didn't you get HW every night without AP classes? I dont take any and i get like 60-130 minutes a night|`|CTQNPj56aa	JUDAS PRIEST  IRON MAIDEN  CREAM  HENDRIX  LED ZEPPELIN  DEEP PURPLE|`|LAvBfjKWaa	Explosions in the Sky!  Hell yes.  That's what I listen to when I do my homework.|`|J5FslwZXaa	I listen to softer music as I do homework so that it doesn't distract me too much. I'd have to say my top five songs played are:    1. 'You'll Ask For Me' by Tyler Hilton  2. 'Just Dropped In' by Kenny Rogers & The First Edition  3. 'Invincible' by Muse  4. 'The Past Recedes' by John Frusciante  5. 'Flightless Bird, American Mouth' by Iron & Wine|`|dduWesM5aa	i listen to the heaviest **** i have when i'm doing hw, which is probably not a good idea, because then i get up, and start hardcore dancing, and headbanging, and eventually end up playing guitar rofl.|`|OyT5oxFbaa	I put my ipod on shuffle when I do homework or read. Lol I can't concentrate when it's quiet. I need noise!
DgwqNbWKaa	In the last episode entitled "Trailer Park Boys: Say Goodnight To The Bad Guys",  Mr. Lahey, after putting away every one of the boys in prison renamed the Trailer Park "Lahey's Trailer Haven"         I have no clue what that other guy was talking about because nothing is ever going to be is good as Trailer Park Boys.

For example, involve the financial, romantic, parental, etc, etc, problems of an average adult. Like the story of a man overcoming a midlife crisis. Or other such topics. Not always problems. Or reminising on the past.    A young adult novel focuses more on very young adults, or as you said, teenagers. The people who have stories going through the sex, drugs, violence, education, and wonder of the world that lies ahead, rather than somebody who has already experienced this life. (As in adult novels)      That's just my opinon though..haha.|`|5XlOq5hzaa	Adult novels more often have high language, involve scary things, graphic murder, and some sexual themes. Young Adult rarely cuss, only using the word H*ll in it's improper tense, aren't too scary (blood at worst, sometimes though, a little graphicness), never go in detail about murder unless the main character is THERE, and go as far as "making out." That's the gist of it.

KBBonf97aa	Ibanez makes fantastic basses and I've never seen a better package deal than the one you're considering.  Even the low-end Ibanez basses are rock solid and punchy sounding, whereas a lot of other brands use substandard woods and electronics to keep the prices low.  I read some reviews on Musician's Friend and noticed a couple people complained about fret buzz, but that's something anyone at a guitar store can fix for you for a few dollars.  It' probably would involve nothing more than an adjustment of the truss rod in the bass' neck.  The amp looks like a nice practice amp, too.    I bought my first bass -- a used Ibanez -- about 24 years ago figuring I'd use it to learn and then upgrade to a Fender jazz bass.  I liked it so much, I've used it exclusively for playing live and recording since I brought it home.  My Fender jazz bass is nice, but I find the Ibanez to be a much better player.  And my brother, who owns a recording studio and has a Music Man Stingray and a couple Fender basses, prefers to use my Ibanez when he's recording because the sound is so crisp and clean.      Once you've mastered bass, you'll probably want to get a bigger amp so you can play with a band.  But I'll bet you'll always keep the bass, since you can't go wrong with Ibanez.  Good luck to you!|`|XW6vIWakaa	Ibanez are great  it will last you for about a year or so|`|wtQY6VEwaa	There is no problem with buying a crappy instrument. The fact is, it will probably make you better. Making an inferior instrument sound good is much harder than making a nice one sound nice.|`|5vhmkj8iaa	i have an ibanez and i love it  if your getting just the beginner kit i would definantely consider buying it because its pretty cheap and ibanez is a quality brand name  no point in buying an expensive one yet if you might not like it|`|nDcSY8UQaa	actually Ibanez is about the best starter pack out there, if you want something that will only last a year or so try a Squire there complete pieces of junk.
ZyGyDLsDaa	Cry Wolf (2005)  aka Cry_Wolf  starring Julian Morris, Lindy Booth, Jared Padalecki, Jon Bon Jovi, Sandra McCoy  IMDb synopsis:  When the troubled Owen starts attending the private Westlake Preparatory Academy, he meets senior student Dodger, who invites him to participate in a game of lies with her friends. The objective of the lying game is to avoid suspicious, manipulate friends and eliminate enemies. The group decides to play a prank on their classmates by using a recent unsolved murder of a student on the campus. They send e-mails to all colleagues describing fake crimes with the same characteristics of the young woman committed by a serial killer called "The Wolf". Their teacher, Rich Walker, advises Owen how serious this joke could be. When the students of their group start to disappear, Owen, Dodger and Tom realize that the killer is all too real.  Here's the movie trailer:  http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wdhFdRHD7...|`|jAoc49N8aa	Cry_Wolf|`|lAP3UC79aa	cabin fever?|`|nmbbG0vdaa	cry wolf|`|LQCHsiWCaa	Cry wolf|`|OKmJWGGGaa	Definitely "Cry Wolf"

Im 28 now and I will still watch it if Im channel surfing and it's on.  I just loved the show. Looking back on it now, it's kinda lame, but I still like it.      Sure it might be geared more towards little kids, but it was more of a family show.  I think if you want to watch Full House, you should!|`|AA12185784	I love that show! I go home every day and watch it,im 13. Haha.|`|NgUbpMHsaa	noo not at all!|`|UlmiwmjCaa	it is not a little kid show i love that show i have watched for as long as i can remember my whole family watches it|`|yWuDSCGpaa	this is a dumb question.|`|jPLY1pPvaa	no.  i watch it and im 13.  its like the greatest show evahhhh.(:
GLnVPp2Caa	The producers often will re-broadcast a previous episode and add the little pop ups to give you inside information into what was going on when they were writing this scene, etc.    The Enhanced episodes are from previous weeks.     The new episodes don't have them.|`|pUCe6F1Vaa	Those are "Enhanced" episodes.  They aren't on new episodes|`|C1tVMEGmaa	I love the pop-ups.  They help remind you what happened last time.

09HDdTfHaa	sasuke is no where near naruto right now but that wouldnt really be a fun fight if naruto just obliterated sasuke so i think kishimoto will be making sasuke strong too just so that hel have a chance against naruto.................|`|MZuGwySRaa	Answers to that is still based on what will happen on the next episodes.  Naruto learned Sage mode but it doesn't mean he has an advantage already. If Sasuke where to fight him now, he may have a chance but against ..Madara and Pain. hmmm... ???    And also he still has to show what He can do if the Sage mode runs out. (Like always.....the cliffhanger for every anime you can perceive).    Naruto has Sage Mode...improvised Rasengan moves and frog-katas.  Sasuke has activated his Mangekyou Sharingan along with the Black Flame and His improvised Chidori.... looks like their balancing each jutsus counter.......We'll see who gets the other...soon!|`|7Mzk6AY0aa	you gonna have to wait and see, but I believe naruto is stronger than sasuke.|`|cqidLRdqaa	Naruto is the strongest simply because he is the main character, and unless Kishimoto wants his popularity to plunge drastically, he's going to keep him alive. Sage powers did add to his overall power.    As far as being better than Sasuke, I don't really know. Kishimoto seems to favor Sasuke, so I think he'd keep them around the same power level. Maybe.|`|yMIqN3SJaa	i don't know. but i will watch it some day. since i never watch naruto before..

vqg6wpCLaa	I've been going to as many Twilight related questions in Comics and Animation and telling the fangirls to go elsewhere. Preferrably Jokes and Riddles - that is suitable enough, no? Because Twilight is no book or movie. It's a pathetic excuse of a joke, if anything. It's rubbish.   To the person who said there was no 'book' section. There is, dimwit. Books and Authors. Open your eyes and read something that isn't rubbish for once.    Whoops, forgot to answer the question. They put them in Comics and Animation because they have a high level of stupidity thanks to Twilight and seemingly cannot find the Books and Authors section.|`|btFSgJmlaa	Stupid fangirls who don't bother to take the time to put it in the right section.|`|VLRkJOOuaa	Yeah. It's really annoying. I've reported every Twilight question (in this section) that I've come across.      Haven't those retards read the community guidelines? Goood they're annoying. Spare us the torture!      [[edit]]    Ally -- Wow, do you have your contacts in right now? Books & Authors is listed under the Arts & Humanities category; a section especially created for books. Omfg, no way! Twilight is a book! But a comic or animation? No... I think not.|`|rNxK7cY8aa	Yeh, it belongs in the entertainment section, but under books or movies. Not COMICS & ANIMATION. No part of Twilight is animated OR a comic.  -____-  Therefore it does not belong here.    I also agree with Pinkie, the book was great, loved it. Until the movie came out and all the fan girls jumped on the band wagon. Now I'm so sick of hearing about it.|`|e8o2eP6Zaa	Well, they are being ignorant because Twilight is neither a comic or an animation, but rather a movie/book. Some claim that their questions were automatically put here by Yahoo but that can be corrected by themselves. So they're just being lazy or they don't bother to check what section it's posted in.|`|6qDhXpWfaa	Well it's cause a lot of Twilight fans are anime/manga fans too, so when they ask a question, it's nice to get opinions and answers from people who read and watch both twilight and manga/anime. If you search up questions, sometimes people compare twilight to an anime or ask where to find those manga pics of twilight from the japanese version.|`|AjN4RJDoaa	Because lots of people enjoy twilight, so questions about it would go into the "entertainment" section, though I think they should belong to the "movies" section.|`|e3f3059cf92dd20cfcb3699c9c05140daa	It is annoying as hell.

I mean maybe they think pplz in this section are more Twilight fans or somthing... it does get annoying but i do |`|vLZlPGEWaa	Try finding the book section on this site.  But yeah, it does get annoying.  I happen to be interested in the saga, but everywhere I look I see obsessed addicts (or whatever you can call them).  Even though I like the story, I know that it's pure fiction.  Some people apparently don't realize this, and scream out to the actors (actually only to one) "Marry me Edward!"|`|VqwfKFOOaa	Fan girls are stupid and can't properly read anything that wasn't typed by Stephanie Meyer. Have you seen their spelling? :[  I used to be a fan of Twilight, myself, but then it got popular. Now the fan girls relate everything and a half to it. "omggg, orannngeeee, Edward wore an orange shiirrrrttt", et cetera.|`|6AxMy4WMaa	sigh * cause they know they can get a lot of answers here than in its  rightful section.. ^^   it happends to all sections.. ^^   and those person like this are insane|`|GpYAmDuDaa	For alot of people Twilight is entertainment.

73f37851c35d22949c704d293473d5cbaa	LOL - it reminds me of something Alexander Pope once wrote: "We may see the small value God has for riches, by the people he gives them to."    Yes, these people (and many other uber-wealthy people) have been very lucky in their careers, but don't think that they don't also work very hard.  Tiger Woods, Bill Gates, Oprah Winfrey, etc. - they've all been very fortunate, but they also have worked their a$$es off to get where they are.    My advice: let go of the envy, and work hard at something you love to do.  The old cliche could not be more true - money does NOT buy happiness.    Eventually we all realize that the things that make us happiest in life do not have a price tag.  The sooner we realize this, the better off we are.  As Henry David Thoreau said, "that man is richest whose pleasures are cheapest."|`|8a7c02df359d96db8ffa457a92b75e50aa	Hey! Kanye West is good! It's just that his new music sucks!

I don't think people like Kim Kardasian who create sex tapes should be rich. At least Kayne West and Jessica Simpson actually make music. Life is so unfair.

The poweramp provides the power. I'm not sure but basically it boosts the signal and gives it power. You can plug your preamp into any poweramp, and the poweramp will do the actual amplification.

Not only its' a cheaper solution as it will allow you to usually see a show for free, but it will also allow you to skip the lines and, last but not least, attend the backstage parties and meet your favorite bands and artists.  Contrary to a popular belief, the truth is that you don't need to be connected within the music industry or be friend with the band to get some back stage passes. Getting a pass is actually easier than you think - you just need to know the ropes.  Go to a site like http://www.igotbackstagepasses.com/ and they will show you exactly how to get backstage.

Get a 4 string set, then find a store that sells "individual" bass strings, and buy a "C" separately.    Or, it's more money, but you could buy a 6 string set, and just not use the low B.

ZyGyDLsDaa	This is the most famous example of a film like that:  Rosemary's Baby (1968)  IMDb synopsis:  A young couple move into a new apartment, only to be surrounded by peculiar neighbors and occurrences. When the wife becomes mysteriously pregnant, paranoia over the safety of her unborn child begins controlling her life.    This is another one:  Child of Darkness, Child of Light (1991 TV movie)  IMDb synopsis:  A Catholic priest is sent to investigate reports of two immaculate conceptions. One is about to give birth to the child of God, and the other is the child of the Devil. He must decide which one is good and which one is evil before Satan's followers can stop him.    There are other films about the antichrist, but they don't match the time period you give or the part about it being in her sleep. Rosemary is drugged, not asleep. I don't recall about the two teenage girls in the second film, whether it happened when they were asleep; but, both do claim they are virgins.    Someone already has mentioned this one, which was one of several others I planned to list for you. I'll go ahead anyway:  The Devil's Child (1997 TV movie)  IMDb synopsis:  A woman's mother makes a last-minute deal with the Devil to save her daughter's life, not realizing that her daughter's life is at stake. The daughter lives but with no chance of children. Twenty years later, she mysteriously becomes pregnant after meeting a dashing stranger. Now, people are dying around her.  NOTE: In this, the evil guy is portrayed by Thomas Gibson, working against type; most know him as Greg in "Dharma & Greg". If you have to get targeted by the Devil, Thomas Gibson isn't so bad I guess. (Just kidding of course!)|`|Mah1BetPaa	The Devil's Child???

He's different than the rest of the groups and they hate him for that.      etc etc....|`|KhGkc2QGaa	It's pretty self explanatory.

E16XFcheaa	Fugu is the only person that translates Tenjou Tenge, currently we are at chapter 121 and he has yet to translate 120 because he has been sick and was actually in the hospital.     His site is http://mangatranslation.com, what he does is not illegal since he only makes scripts so licensing is not a problem.    After he translates it, random scanlators will use his translation to create the scanlation, this could take a while.     If I remember correctly chapter 119 took him a whole month to translate and about a week for a scanalator to use his script. Oh and some really interesting things are happening, I think the wait will be worth it for fans.|`|CZwJJetyaa	Tenjou Tenge is licensed in the United States by CMX. Maybe the translators got a cease and desist letter.   I'm sure in a few days someone else will pick it up. You might have to keep an eye out for in on Google..

MnGGEMwBaa	Get yourself heard. How did eminem emerge as the first white rapper? He believed in himself. Ask yourself if you really think you can make it.. and if you can nothing can hold you down. Rap in school, rap on the train rap, in the streets and let people hear you. If you have talent you will be found. I cant give you a proper answer but you need to let people hear you believe in yourself and show the world what your made of. Go on Amercan idol dont stop trying, but just know you are not alone in your dream. So many youths want what you want. Do you really have what it takes to be noticed? If you really believe that then you cannot be ignored.. Just dont expect to be signed next month. You have to strive for success. Dont imitate anyone as this will make people forget you. Be unique and rap about your feelings and dreams. You know more than I do on it Im sure. Bottom line. BE HEARD! No1 will come into your room while your on youtube and give you a deal get your punk *** out there and impress.... dont give up or I'l be very dissapointed LMAO..

mZUXkeyRaa	I been to 3 of his concerts, so I know, lol!  Okay, he usually sings his new songs  And then his old songs  He will sing new songs from his new CD  Then, he will DEF sing Beautiful Soul  He did that at every concert  Have a awesome time!  He also takes a girl from the audience  And sings to her!!!!  Have a awesome time!  =)|`|AA11986298	i'm so jealous you'll be seeing him! he's my fave celebrity! i've never seen him! i love him! he's probably going to sing songs off his new cd! then probably some old ones too!|`|lgvPMS9Naa	Hi, just wanted to say Jesse is great in concert! He dances a lot which is cool! I actually saw him from the front row once when I went to a Jingle Ball concert in Sacramento for 107.9 the end so I could see David Archuleta, who also performed! And I touched Katy Perrys arm! But Jesse also sang some songs from his new album which was cool and he pulled a girl out from the audience and sang to her! You'll have tons of fun there!|`|j6fz3rRiaa	I'm also going well, was. The shows for March was postponed, but hope I still get to go. This will be my 1st JMAC concert! I love him!    He's on the departure tour so he'll be singing songs from the departure cd which include:    Leavin'  It's Over  Rock You  How do you sleep  Into Ya  Make Up  My Baby  Told You so  Relapse  Runnin'  Freaky  Not your enemy    Hope This Helps. Let me know how the concert goes.  Have Fun!|`|EmpJE9gDaa	Alright so it's a Departure tour, so he will be singing his Departure songs.     All his songs off his new album Departure except for Not Your Enemy . He will also most likely be singing Oxygen. I've watched a few interviews, where he said he will be picking a group of girls to come on stage with him to sing and hang out. ( Awesome!!!! lol )     He also might sing Buy you a drank, and I heard there was gunna be a special guest? oooo0o0ooo :)    Im thinking Luda!     Anyways so to wrap it all up here are the songs you'll need to know:    01. Leavin'  02. It's Over   03. Rock You   04. How Do You Sleep   05. Into Ya   06. Make Up     07. My Baby    08. Told You So   09. Relapse     10. Runnin'   11. Freaky     12. Not Your Enemy    and Oxygen and possibly Buy you a drank.     Also, for Rock You, he only sings his part, not the Sean Garrett Part.    I also thought I should tell you that his backup singers sang " Jesse's Girl " before picking a girl for oxygen. ( That happened at the concert I was at so I'm not sure if it will happen at the one ur going to)     ALSO He sings Beautiful Soul &&& She's no you of his first Album ( beautiful soul )        Welll.... Have fun!

kS5703KGaa	It looks pretty awful.  I mean they didn't just change the costumes, it looks like they changed the whole backstory to make it more like a Karate Kid story or something...|`|vqg6wpCLaa	It doesn't look very good at all. They could have done much better than they did and I disagree with the actor who is playing Goku. He's no good if you've seen other movies of his.    I'm going to see it nonetheless. I'm not expecting much, but it's worth seeing just because it's DBZ.

I'll watch it, but I'm not really expecting much.|`|rNxK7cY8aa	Most live actions I have seen sucked. Its unfortunate but movie makers apparently just don't know how to make a movie and actually follow the plot line of what they are basing it on.  -_____-  Not to mention the casting generally sucks too.    Edit: M-M..... Master Roshi isn't a perv!?!?!?!? HOW?!?!? WHY!?!?!?  DX  It was one of the funniest parts....|`|Xp6oHZgCaa	Well when i was about to see the trailer i was excited to the baddest... but then i started watching more and more of it, i already passed judgement on it, its gonna suck ***. Im still gona watch it though even though it doesn't even follow the story and none of the characters suit their parts. especially coz goku dosen't have a tail and his grandfather is still alive, master roshi isn't bald or have a gotie and he's supposed to be a massive perv...sad sad day in the dragonball world, but like i said im still gona watch it.|`|Ql9ZCVapaa	It is going to suck SO much. True fans of Dragon Ball all over the world are going to be let down tremendously. I'm not going to watch it. I already know it's going to be way off.|`|vLZlPGEWaa	I'm gonna watch it, but i don't know if it'll be any good.  i hope it is.  it was an awesome show.

f639092fc925bbd55e7b6272eeb17334aa	Nash won his Prize for his work on Game Theory, in particular the Nash Equilibrium theory that stated that all benefit most when all take in to account what the other person is doing to do the best they can.    http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nash_Equili...    The pens are given by professors to other professors when they distinguish themselves academically, penning a great paper, being named full professor or head of a department, completing a grant, or in his case winning a Nobel Prize. It is the same as saying I could not write better myself.|`|3dcc2948a003c40d98c8ef0d9a516e9baa	The theory modifies the traditional capitalist view that says society works best when everyone is trying as hard as he can to help himself.  Think about Wall Street's "Greed is good.  Greed works."  That's the basic idea.  Nash's theory says that society works best when everyone is trying to help himself AND the group.  The part where he talks about everyone going after the blonde in the bar is a boiled down version of his theory.      As far as the pens, the traditional was when one of the faculty accomplished something big, like the Nobel Prize or some other really significant academic accomplishment, the other professors would show their esteem by giving him a pen.  When everyone gave him their pen, he knew that other people respected him and his work....something he had probably all but given up on with his struggle with schizophrenia.|`|DibFrwxlaa	It was some early theory of his regarding economics.  They didn't really get into it in the movie.  It probably would have been largely incomprehensible to most people.     The pens were some Princeton tradition.  It's like a sign of respect and acceptance.|`|yIQ37AbHaa	About the pens, that's what all fellow Professors give to a great professor when they win a nobel prize.

But she was also about 5'8'' and MAYBE 100 lbs|`|d5COR2S2aa	it does happen. i heard about something like that on the radio this other day.... the woman was obese, so she didn't even notice her bigger-than-nomal stomach.|`|N9BiqI8gaa	I saw a document about this, about how women didn't know they were pregnant. Some Dr.s told women that they weren't able to have children. And most of these women were overweight, so they thought they we just eating to much. I felt sorry for them.|`|yAXrsQiFaa	I can't imagine how......|`|vdcUYLztaa	Knocked up in January.    Put in 8 month coma in February.    Pop the baby out during sleep in September.    Wake up.|`|UdemZ27caa	she thought she was eating too much!|`|kY9fVBbLaa	maybe she's retarded..|`|OJAC44eTaa	Because her head is full of oatmeal instead of brains.|`|SxJzPmvzaa	If she's extremely obese and can't really tell if she's pregnant.    heheh|`|n31VupXoaa	her name would be paris hilton|`|knYpvAOyaa	There's a variety of reasons that a woman can not realize that she's pregnant:  1. She's never been pregnant before and was possibly told she wouldn't be able to (but apparently was)  2. She's had a baby before (or a few), but the symptoms of this pregnancy were so subtle that she couldn't tell until later    That's all I have so far. Also, the babies don't just "fall out"|`|GTsKitahaa	Well, the baby doesn't actually "fall out."       Anyway, I have heard of that happening but I can't imagine how a woman doesn't know she is pregnant.|`|zIa8XeKqaa	She cant ... babies kick really hard she would notice...  And it makes u fat LOL -.-|`|HBK4YCpKaa	if the lady was extremely fat and had the symptoms of pregnancy already. but shes gotta b real stupid.|`|23HBEDHqaa	if she pretty much closed heer eyes during the whole time having sex or she believes she is the virgin mary.|`|26ecb6a986134f697709409245cb1cdcaa	she has problems.|`|btw6du1baa	that's impossible I think.!|`|v0QWwmwGaa	im watching a show on t.v right now  about woman who were pregnant and didn't know they were.... Its crazy not to know but  there are some out there who don't know till they have it....or some know they are and don't show and try to hide it from others..... I had a  friend  who's sister was pregnant and no one knew she was till her water  broke and her  dad rushed her to the hospital....|`|8Y583Fluaa	its a bunch of bull...they just use that for excuse to cover up the lies they been telling|`|m7nrQEflaa	I have no idea!|`|qNYidc76aa	have you ever had indigestion?|`|C2sZREuAaa	she is paralyzed
mggll8dRaa	Babies, up to about 40 yrs old......LMAO.....!!|`|p03Jc7eHaa	hell im still in diapers|`|2193c4e44db8189b4abf5d6676cc8346aa	we're pretty much helpless our entire lives|`|8nm2psyKaa	cuz we make them be...we baby them too long lol  I'm thinkin Chinas got the right idea goin on....well sorta|`|4KTe107Yaa	survival of the fittest  proves we don't belong here. we're just visiting|`|yAXrsQiFaa	Because we know we can get away with it....|`|CphIBXMaaa	Evolution!|`|zzivfC0qaa	Because they are born much smaller and fragile, also they tend to rely on the human parents for protection.|`|aXw1YNfEaa	are you kidding? ever seen what happens to baby animals when left alone? not many human babies get eaten. =)|`|vdcUYLztaa	'Cause we end up living longer lives than other inferior species.|`|49hXgGjkaa	because they figure out quit fast, that they can leech of their mamas.|`|HCL7FpTqaa	According to a book I once read, the human body is incapable of carrying a fetus any longer than it does.  The baby misses out on a last 'trimester' of sorts.  So it makes up for it in infancy.|`|NCvX4I0baa	Because human babies have more to learn than others. Mammals mostly only learn how to protect themselves from prey, how to hunt/ find food and find shelter.    Babies grow up and have to learn how to go potty at the right place, and up to every little detail such as left from right. We're more advanced mammals, so we require more time for nurturing and learning as the brain grows.|`|Ek24XkeCaa	Because our brains are so large we are born helpless so that we can go through the birh canal easier.  Because we are helpless our parenting skills (supposedly) have become more honed and much more developed in order to teach our children what they need to know.  Parents aren't the only ones who raise a child.  Relatives and other members of the community take a part in it too.  From the most primitive tribes all the way to the biggest cities you'll see uncles, aunts, cousins, siblings, teachers, coaches....taking a part in the raising of a child.  You've heard the term, "it takes a village'?  That's where it comes from.|`|HFEotT1Qaa	We're born lazy...|`|U18ssQhiaa	Because we are very complex.

pt6wIlS1aa	Asimov's Science Fiction accepts stories from new writers. http://www.asimovs.com/    Fantasy and Science Fiction is probably the king of the SF mags, and it also accepts stories from previously unpublished writers. http://www.sfsite.com/fsf/    Mainstream magazines that publish short stories occasionally take a science fiction story if it fits their readers' interests. They may require you to go through a literary agent, though. These magazines include The Saturday Evening Post, Playboy, etc. One way to find other sources is to check those anthologies of Best SF Stories of the Year, which lists the magazines where the stories originally appeared.
cnP4Sqxnaa	yeah he looks like a hobo...hes really ugly lol|`|mZUXkeyRaa	He looks like a Hobo  Hobo's aren't sexy!|`|ulBW2m62aa	Sexy?More like ugly,creepy and perverted.|`|u0xvF3UOaa	I don't understand this either.  He is an average guy.  But tweens have to constantly find new meat to obsess over so I guess he was the chosen one?  I don't know.|`|KhGkc2QGaa	I agree. He needs to comb down his hair. It's all those little 13 year old girls that forget that Edward Cullen is just a character. They think that Robert is just like him and that they'll some day marry him.|`|7RQDM1HGaa	He and Ed are both SMOKING HOT|`|ukBX5OOsaa	He has that urban style, that yes comes across as dirty :/, but some women (cough cough me) lol are attracted to that.|`|tvWm1e4naa	not me. i don't even know him|`|MG7CLjtjaa	I think he's really normal looking. Not hot or sexy. Just, average; whatever. Good actor though :)|`|Zh7QcGLtaa	I kinda think he is. He's got the semi-mysterious thing going on.   I love it!|`|ZgNPIlWFaa	i agree with you he is not sexy but he is cute. a huge turn off is that he said on LIVE TV that he didn't brush his teeth that he hates hygiene. thats gross|`|kktoXldiaa	Uh because he is,I think his dirty hair look makes him look even hotter but im not obsessed with him like those other chicks. Man those girls are crazy! It's like as if he's a jonas brother or something.|`|XTXE0u34aa	i thnk he looks creepy!!! he doesn't bathe and he can't drive he is just a freak|`|rKt2UNI3aa	I would say the same. he's cute but jus not sexy.|`|hqjJV70Eaa	I think Rob is adorable, but it has nothing to do with his looks.  Granted, he's cute to just look at but it's what's beneath his looks that makes him sexy.  He's mysterious, goofy, intelligent, and modest.    Out of all those, his intelligence is the sexiest thing about him.|`|HfHrLymBaa	hes perfect|`|FYT97XLgaa	They don't look, do they? pattiSUX is really ugly. i like this guy:    http://rumorsinmusic.com/wp-content/uplo...|`|p0vC7UO4aa	haha that's what i said, he looks like chuck bass. Hes cute but every 12 year old is obsessed with him|`|04lqPAagaa	robert pattinson is hot. but he does look creepy in some pics!|`|p5K0cObAaa	he's different looking and has unusually beautiful bone structure.  his face is just interesting (in an attractive way), plus his british accent doesn't hurt.|`|RmKO2ouXaa	Haha I agree with you on the Ed Westwick thing only Robert Pattinson doesn't do the same creepy whisper talk thing. I also agree that he is cute but not sexy. I think girls like him so much because of his character in twilight. The way he is portrayed in the books and movies is very sexy.|`|JBLMKjm1aa	ummm he's freakin gorgeous and beautiful in every single way.  especially since he;s edward in twilight.  just makes him even sexier.|`|mskvSaYXaa	i don't know he is cute but i don't think he Perfect and stuff to  i think every one thinks he cute becasue he from a big movie that just came out i dont know|`|PYArO59naa	hes ugly!  i dont know why anyone would like him either.  :(  ew  in harry potter he wasnt bad, but now, ick!    they could have done way better finding an edward for twilight.|`|INybXKozaa	Well i could sit here and say   "Duh look at those eyes, those cheekbones and his sexy messy hair"  & i do like him  But honestly,   most girls [without even noticing]  like him for how he is described in the book.  He is written to be perfect, everything a girl wants,  and when chicks look at him, they see him as Edward,  so they believe he is just as perfect.  He is cute though.|`|Hgk6563eaa	the british accent i guess and the smile...i don't know either|`|Hpy5fGcqaa	yeah he looks creepy! I just googled him and I see nothing cute really he looks like a average guy I would see on the street!  also the girl talking about Joe Jonas, JOE JONAS is gay it's SOOOOOOOOO obvious just look at him! I've been saying that every since the first time I seen him|`|YdEx7cPLaa	He obviously looks better in Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire as Cedric Diggory than as Edward Cullen in Twilight and he needs to shave lol.
bvwYVGJOaa	Aries> Aggressive  Leo> Normally tempered  Sagittarius> Usually cool but can grow temper    Taurus> Hot tempered and intense  Virgo> Can get anger but usually reduce to tears  Capricorn> Does get angry and end up cussing    Gemini> Lover not a fighter but can knock you out with quick mindness anger and cuss    Libra> Dont know but usually bossy    Aquarius> cool minded and does not argue instead resolves the situation    Cancer> Aggressive and can be tempered quickly  Scorpio> Sting!!  Pisces> Usually right in things but dont know much about them|`|WIczM4URaa	look at the elements in their natural state.    fire is burning, air is floating, water is flowing, earth is solid.  all signs naturally have different moods or climate.     in the case of water, it may be calm, raging, flowing, deep, etc.     each person must handle what comes their way, rightly or wrongly.|`|n53BNB8taa	Water signs cannot control their anger also if they forgive, they can't forget what happened to them so this will cause them to take revenge.    Cancer will get angry if anyone threatens their family and they will go into sulking moods after being insulated.  Scorpios will get angry if anyone tries to control them or tells them that they r being stubborn like, they will go into revenge mode and sometimes kills their enemy.  Pisces is the soft one in all of these water signs, they get angry but forgive that person quickly.|`|S2uAq7i4aa	Since I see your questions almost everyday,I just can't stand it anymore.  It's DIFFERENT!  Not differAnt!|`|AA10807022	My ex boyfriend is a scorpio, he usually kept his anger in check very well except of course when I (an Aries) blew up at him and cussed him out. Then he blew his top and refuses to speak to me. That was a year ago. Ive forgiven him for the things he said and I even apologized for the things I said but scorpios are ruthless and they don't forgive.     Ever.    I know my temper as an aries is very loud, explosive like a volcano erupting and short lived where as his as a scorpio tends to build up then linger for a long time.     My dad is a pisces and his temper is a little like mine loud and short lived but he doesn't hold grudges and he knows how to forgive others.    Truly though I don't think your sign affects your temper as much as how you were raised. If you were raised in a quiet home where your parents/caregivers rarely argued then no matter what sign you are, your upbringing would influence you more than your sign.    Anger management is directly related to how your parents/caregivers managed their anger in front of you. They were your first teachers.

dyQNG6V8aa	I love that one!!!!  "WHERE'S MY MONEY???" I love it when Brian walks past him with the fake moustache on!!!    Personally my fave is where Chris joins the Peace Corp and the tribe does the Jitterbug!!!    http://uk.youtube.com/watch?v=TLJcQMRvkd...  - poor quality I know but still funny!!!!|`|e3f3059cf92dd20cfcb3699c9c05140daa	The epidisode where Stewie wants the money from Brian so he beats the hell out of him and shoots him and every god knows what thing else|`|2NLF7KwZaa	hate it but tha little babby guy if i were to choose :)|`|YB3akykhaa	haha, i love family guy. I like the episode where peter says to ctewie, chris and bryan "who ever drinks this in the quickest time can have the thing in the fridge" and they all drink it and start throwing up constanly. its just hilairious!|`|dWwjEcmaaa	That one is really good. I like the ones with stewie being stewie. I like the one when stewie is being potty trained and peter says he should get him a beer and stewie says something about smoking doobies and watching porn. Peters reaction makes me laugh every time.    I also like the one when they inherit the mansion and brian is teaching peter to be fancy and peter says something about the guy from hogans heroes having rough sex.    My favorite though is the one when Brian pees on the floor (or maybe it is the one when peter is a cast away) and at the end he and Lois are talking on the couch about "them" and Lois totally shoots him down. You can hear stewie from the stairs and everytime he says "yeah b**** you just got jacked" i lose it.|`|BwJOeHDEaa	idk theres alot of them, i like the one wehre stewie is stuck in the tv and he was like "hold on ive always wanted to do this" and he starts singing the phil collins/genesis song  i like the one where meg was going to join the cult too, well parts of it  idk i havent really seen an episode where i though "dang, that wasnt very funny"  actually i think it was the one where peter goes in for a physical and gets a prostate exam and all the men in town call the dr a rapist and they brin ghim to court and when they are telling the court about what happened to them they describe it like theyre on a pirate ship or that the dr throws them across the room or something haha|`|rn71HBKHaa	I like the one where Stewie can't say Cool Whip and says Cool Hwip        here's a link http://uk.youtube.com/watch?v=lich59xsji...|`|cpUZ60K5aa	the one where peter has his own tv station with shows including 'the side boob half hour'|`|9KWVgb9naa	you asked for it "bird bird  bird bird everybody knows that the bird is the word !"or meg s restaurant job where they think stewie is her son|`|4D059ohkaa	The PTV episode where Peter starts his own TV station, featuring, the Peter Griffin Side Boob Hour!|`|lkNJNnlSaa	The one where they show clips of peter's christmas album when he's in the studio.

MnGGEMwBaa	Well I think your on to something.. Hes way to stylish etc its definetely a fake and spruced up image. I bet what he really wants is to wear a tracksuit and play call of duty all day. Im joking but he def stole the attitude he's so fake. He is an amazing artist I dont dislike him but he is so fake... If you were to list honest rappers would he be one (or RnB whatever you get the point) Eminem is honest, Tupac was honest. They didnt make music videos to look flash they made them to tell you how they feel and if you dont wanna hear it F you they told you anyway... Kanye needs to get his own personality and stop watching scarface. He is not Tony Montana. The matrix is just a movie. Tony Soprano is against violence in real life. Pamela andersons **** are plastic (no ****) my point is he needs to get his own character. We know your rich and good looking mate now take off your sunglasses boy WE ARE INDOORS! Hehe Kanye West needs to admit that he has no personality then we may put him on the honest rappers list|`|1KEb9cvCaa	lmao  you can't be serious|`|trWMn7Zkaa	deano is a dumb@55 who doesnt know sH1t  seriously, if you have heard his first two albums, you cant say ANYTHING about him having no personality  you are probably a loser that first heard of him AFTER he went mainstream with graduation|`|mBQQL0kCaa	........|.....  ........|..........2 Points..........|||"|""\__  ........|__________________|||_|___|)  ........!(@)'(@)""""**!(@)(@)****!(@)|`|XDvOwLlNaa	NO I DONT

f639092fc925bbd55e7b6272eeb17334aa	1. Kane's mother, Mary, runs a boarding house in rural Colorado. In lieu of a payment, one of her tenants gives her some stock in what she thinks is a worthless mine; it turns out to give her ownership of the Colorado Lode, a working gold mine.     2. It was a scandal because at the time they were not married and he was still married to his first wife Emily Monroe Norton,a President's niece, plus he was running for office himself, and trying to turn Susan into a star at the same time. The latter part seemed a coverup for the affair. When the scandal broke he lost his political chances at election and his first marriage. All that was left were his papers and Susan who could not sing to save her life.    3. The stocks thwe mother supposedly had also found silver in time. Truth be known the William Randolph Heart family that this story is losely based on started from the fortune amassed by George Hearst who hit it big in mining with the Comstock Lode, (gold), two silver mines, a gold mine, and a copper mine as well. George won a newspaper in a card game and that is the begininings of Willam's publishing empire. But the fact is the family was loaded and Willams mother married his father who was rich at that time.|`|l4WEwTWwaa	He got rich off of being a newspaper magnet. Setting up a **** load of newspapers. That was the main point of the film and such a huge plot point that I am honestly in utter amazement you didn't get that.
AA10102392	Me too. Worship is taking it too far. Maybe some people worship celebrities to fill the emptiness in their lives. I'm not sure.|`|tyWacgrGaa	The two biggest motivators in America are sex and money. The majority of celebrities have both sex appeal and money, they are put up on a pedestal because most Americans adore the two.  In addition when they do something good it's broadcasted all over and blown out of proportion, if a non-celeb did the same good deed they wouldn't get the same praise as a celebrity (ex. Angelina and Brad adopting a child). However they suffer much more criticism if a flaw appears (Britney Spears), because they're perceived as more than human.|`|Hgk6563eaa	i guess some people fall in love or become obsessed with the people they're are jealous of...|`|1RwZZ2aPaa	I know! People act like celebrities are a different species. They obsess and act like they actually are gods. I mean I can understand liking a celebrity but don't worship them. They're just people like us. They do the same things as us but they sing and act. Their really no different then we are.|`|Lh6pnwqHaa	I know! I mean it's like celebs are there lives! It's stupid. I guess some people have nothing better to do

a231cd46589d3ea6efabcc68cdd6e69baa	We still have 12 episodes to go in season 3, which may show some improvement.  Jeph Loeb and Jesse Alexander, who were in charge of the writers, were fired halfway through Fugitives.  At the beginning of the volume they hired Mark Verheiden, one of the writers from Battlestar Galactica.  In an interview he said he saw many of the problems with Villains and that those were being fixed in Fugitives.  They also brought back Bryan Fuller, who was one of the producers during season 1.  His first episode was episode 20, so he won't have much of an effect on this season (which was mostly plotted out by Loeb and Alexander).  But with any luck season 4 will be back to the quality of season 1. Jeph Loeb's work in both comics and TV has been pretty bad for the past two years.  It's hard to blame him because his son's death is what triggered the downturn, but still, his work hasn't been up to par for quite some time in any media.    http://www.watchingheroes.com/interview-...  http://ausiellofiles.ew.com/2008/12/excl...|`|c302cbf4b446e1a459fa99e0177f27c7aa	I hope so, the 2nd and 3rd season (so far) have been crap.

FdqCnU03aa	1) flying! (:  then I could go anywhere I wanted to, almost, and I'd be able to go quickly and stuff.. :P (and I'd never have to worry about being late to school! :P)  mainly, though, there's just plain FUN in flying! ...right?    2) shapeshifting  perfect if you were going to do drama/etc. and perform!  and if I needed cool clothes, I'd be able to have them when I need them!  (definitely saves money and shopping time, about the clothes part!)    3a) a genuis brain  (does this count as a superpower? O_O)  helps so much... like on semester finals right now in school.. >.  or...  3b) super speed/endurance running!  helps in crosscountry/track during the races/meets! lol.|`|eMMxXjaLaa	It would be the power to control elements.

Ability to steal other people's powers. If I'm going to be a superhero, then I'd better be the only one. Better chance at taking over the world that way.  2. Immortality.

Because they are... Everyone can read minds except me... And they make fun of me for it... It's all a giant conspiracy...|`|AA11690196	1. to be able to use all elemental powers wind water fire and lightning! wind and water are my favs!  2. fly!  3. power to heal anything myself and other people (like sakura!)|`|unVzWzCuaa	mine would be to be able to read minds and talk into other peoples minds...... and kind of control it......... and to have immortality|`|J4fqUGO5aa	top 3: 1. flight 2. speed 3. invisibility|`|Hiasgb75aa	Reality Change.

Square is more sensible.|`|NCvX4I0baa	Think about it.

AA12004569	I like sweet Gerhkins or however you spell them to snack on, if I am going to snack on pickles. And I like crunchy dills on peanut butter and pickle sandwiches, they are sooo good! But they have to be CRUNCHY!    *For those poor deprived souls who've never had a peanut butter and pickle sandwich, here's how it goes: Spread peanut butter onto both pieces of bread. (I don't even like peanut butter, but you need it on both. It's delicious, trust me!) Cut up dill pickles widthwise into 1/2 inch-ish slices. Set the slices on one piece of bread, completely covering the peanut butter. You'll probably need more than one pickle.

KhGkc2QGaa	I'm going to that concert.    With 5 bands, it will probably last about 4-5 hours (I went to an all time low concert a few months ago. It started at 8 and ended at 12).    They're long, but each band plays 8-15 songs. If you're going on a school night (like me), you'll be tired the next day. I'd reccommend finding out all the songs that will be played, that way you can get more out of the concert.|`|fDElc7Qhaa	Actually it just depends, because i went to this one concert [it was....Panic at the Disco, The Cab, Dashboard Confessional, and the Plain White T's. it was the rockband live tour, it was alright i gues] and it only lasted from 7 to 10    so I'm not sure|`|j49IqTdiaa	hours|`|5uEAHEQJaa	Expect for it to last at least until 12 am|`|1piK1ZBQaa	A little over an hour and a half|`|krkpHSOhaa	Usually they end around 10PM-12AM|`|coqbBCh9aa	Most concerts that I have been to last about 1 - 2 hourz, and they are all bands, so the concert you attend will probably last the same. Also, each song will probably be about  3-5 minutes, and just in case it takes long it might take atleast 1 - 2 hours.|`|IHEdxoIpaa	my last concert lasted 4 hours..|`|OeCpZ5pFaa	What time does the show start? A lot of venues have a curfew of 11pm or 12 midnight.|`|hMPI3TxTaa	Depends on how many songs are in each bands set list, and how long they are. You might be able to find it online.|`|untdVk2Naa	It really depends on the concert, but if I had to guess with those bands playing, I'd say anywhere from 4-6 hours from start to finish.|`|r1AGgS7Aaa	it all depends on which concert.  some can take up to 6 hours while others only 1 hour. the average is mostly 2-4 hours!  =]|`|8ivnzNi5aa	With five bands, averaging 45 minutes a set, and five minutes between acts, the show would last 4 hours and 5 minutes, maybe longer with encores.  With travel time, including possibly a half hour to get out of the parking lot after the show, that's seven hours right there.  Personally, I wouldn't go, but it's your call.|`|3f5vlE0Aaa	2-5 hours.|`|CNSGz12zaa	2-4 hours|`|dduWesM5aa	depends, probably anywhere from 5- 8 hours.

FHYjZx1Kaa	Yeah I am a mega huge geek!  I saw it 5 times in the cinema...loved the show and couldn't wait for the film to come out.  I'm glad I never got to see the show before it got cancelled, so at least I knew I was only getting half a season. I would probably have cried.   The film was great though (apart from the couple of sad bits) It's an open ended ending lol. I used to belong to a couple of sites and forums but to be honest I haven't been on them in a couple of years since the movie hype died down. Just do a google search, I tried and can see a few but my work web won't let me on certain sites.     Yay I love talking about Firefly / Serenity.    Oh to the person above who assumes you are referring to just Firefly...omg if you liked that why don't you know they made a film! Get it watched!    Just found out from one of my friends that I met on browncoat sites - the best site to try would be:  http://www.serenitymovie.org/browncoats/...|`|QC94IKIxaa	If you are talking about the series "Firefly" then yes, I am.

You basically need to learn a skill like astro navigation or how to fight in a nebula or xeno-biology maybe then head to a dodgy bar inside an asteroid and see if anyone starts a fight when people are hailing the alliance.|`|Z8lCw8Maaa	No idea.. but I love Serenity too, and I guess you already know it, but in case you don't, look up the FIREFLY series that the film is based on. Its really good but unfortunately only got through a pilot series. Still, Its good =D

His father replied "Go ask everyone if they would sleep with Brad Pitt for a million dollars. Come back tomorrow and tell me your answer."    So the boy went to his sister first and asked her "Would you sleep with Brad Pitt for a million dollars?"    His sister replied "A million dollars? Heck, I'd sleep with him for free!"    Then the boy went to his mother and asked her "Would you sleep with Brad Pitt for a million dollars?"    His mother replied "A million dollars is an awful amount of money. Of course I would. It would pay for your college tuition fees and everything!"    Afterwards, the boy went to his older brother's room and asked him "Would you sleep with Brad Pitt for a million dollars?"    His brother replied "Duh. Do you know how much money a million dollars is? I could buy a whole lot with that much money!"    The next day, the boy's father asked him if he had found out the difference between potentially and realistically.    The boy answered, "Potentially, we could be sitting on top of three million dollars. Realistically, we're living with two sluts and a queer."    or    My wonderful girlfriend and I had been dating for over a year, and so we decided to get married. There was only one little thing bothering me. It was her beautiful younger sister.    My prospective sister-in-law was twenty-two, wore very tight miniskirts, and generally was bra-less. One day "little" sister called and asked me to come over to check the wedding invitations. She was alone when I arrived, and she whispered to me that she had feelings and desires for me that she couldn't overcome.    She told me that she wanted to make love to me just once before I got married and committed my life to her sister.    Well, I was in total shock, and couldn't say a word. She said, "I'm going upstairs to my bedroom, and if you want one last wild fling, just come up and get me." I was stunned and frozen in shock as I watched her go up the stairs.    When she reached the top she pulled off her panties and threw them down the stairs at me. I stood there for a moment, then turned and made a beeline straight to the front door.    I opened the door, and headed straight towards my car. Lo and behold, my entire future family was standing outside, all clapping!    With tears in his eyes, my future father-in-law hugged me and said, we are very happy that you have passed our little test.....we couldn't ask for a better man for our daughter. Welcome to the family."    And the moral of this story is:          Always keep your condoms in your car........     those are 2 of the best lol|`|SlkKa1jsaa	what did the leaf do when it got sick........|`|mrjRPHzTaa	What do you call a Russian prostitute?

So my friend tells her... and the joke is    Why is Santas sack so BIG? ....Because he only "Cums" once a year!

fk2rCbdyaa	The "tour" is actually a tour of the sound stage at Screen Gems studios. And those tours are normally when nothing is scheduled for shooting. They wont let you tour the active sets out on location. Best thing to do, is check around and see where they are going to be shooting for the day, ( the basketball court across the river, Laney High School, and multiple places downtown are all hot spots ) and go down there. I know our local news will let us know where they're shooting, so that we can avoid traffic delays. Most of the time the cops have the roads closed to car traffic, but foot traffic can always make it through. There's also an empty lot on the corner of Dock and Front ( I think, either way it's close to that corner ) that they have all of the cast trailers set up while shooting downtown. I guess if you really wanted to meet them ( although it would be kind of a creepy thing to do ) you could just wait outside on the sidewalk. I know the main dude ( don't know his name, but the chicks dig him ) likes to go to Best Buy, I've run into him there before ( or so my wife tells me ). Good luck......don't be too creepy!!|`|jpTl3o5naa	I am a big fan of the show too and if I knew, I'd want to meet them too, especially Chad Michael Murray!

Very rarely do people get to meet the cast and what not.

RtHBnYSmaa	I don't think anything of it. He probably just thought he'd "open other doors" since his football career is nearing its end. I have a feeling not very many people will watch or care. You'll hear about it more often on SportsCenter than the entertainment shows.|`|w6czQwhBaa	IM definitely  tuning in,..and its  not a dating show its just gonna show Terrell owens daily life|`|GSOLv83Waa	I think its a good choice for him, maybe we'll get to see a different side of him.

geq6iU0Oaa	ALL of the early Skynyrd albums are my favorites.    I just heard the news a moment ago (11:35pm PST).    I suddenly feel very old....    Lynyrd Skynyrd was intertwined with my life for a long time. When my older sister and I stumbled on the fact that we both smoked pot, we each grabbed our copy of Second Helping to show the other the marijuana leaves on the cover. My second concert was Skynyrd and The Allman Brothers at Tempe Stadium (Phoenix, AZ.) My first concert after moving back to CA was Skynyrd at Angel Stadium. I lost most of the hearing in my right ear standing next to the stage, in front of the PA speakers at another Skynyrd show in Phoenix. I bought Street Survivors as a matter of routine-after all it was the new Skynyrd album-only to get home and hear about the crash. The term papers for both semesters of my college History of Rock & Roll class were on Skynyrd (got an A on both of them)    Each loss of an artist that has tickled my ear, moved me, made me think, or otherwise enriched my life is a personal loss in some sense. But this one is especially close to home....    The eight or ten times I saw Skynyrd live, for some reason I always watched Billy during this song  http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EsIqEq9OF...|`|wTNAOcl1aa	I just read that.  And Simple Man will always be in my top 3 favorite songs of all time, i'll edit...loooong story...    Okay. So, my brother has been a really big role model in my life. I don't have my dad around, and my other brother lives far away, so my older brother was always an idol. Someone i could look up to. We were really close. Then he got involved with drugs, we weren't as close, and i got depressed. Some nights i would lie there thinking about what happened, and i could hear him crying from his room after he and my mom got in arguments, which happened often. And i could hear him crying and listening to simple man. One night he called me in there, he was crying his eyes out and told me to treat mom better. To not do what he did. He said it was hell. And he told me he was going to alabama the next morning to live with my dad. Anyways, he's completely better now, and we're close again, and every time a hear simple man, it reminds me of my brother, and all the crap he's been through. And what he told me. And it means a lot to me.|`|a79b8a93426576f5d2c9cb6a23ba338faa	'Simple Man' is a good song.|`|ebxwADDcaa	4 down, 3 to go|`|rytSFBbgaa	Wow this is the first im hearing about it   http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mioGewkWV...  http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sV_toedW2...  http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ut5jVrfRY...  http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8sF0bQBOs...|`|0a88332d968993b9b9d62ec94243eb24aa	Many years ago my best friend in Germany got visit from a cousin from the USA. He was a cool guy and brought Christian two Lynard Skynard albums as a gift.  Pronounced .........and  Gimme back my bullet .  We were fascinated by the totally different sound from anything we had ever heard before, and I remember Chris and I played it over and over again. The sheer raw passion of it made me feel a warm tummy and still does 30 years later.   It is cliche, but my fave song is of course Free Bird. Nothing quiet like it out there ( but maybe the Blackfoot tune  Highway Song that  you recommended to me so many years later. Thanks for that! ).  It is too bad so many talented musicians die far too soon. They should all live to be 100..........|`|oQh0lsFkaa	ya i know i was heart broken.  i love them may he rest in paradise  simple man  free bird  tuesdays gone  great songs!!!|`|1688a18bd590fbe764de7df2901d2d0baa	what a shame all the Southern Rock talent is dying off my favorite album would be all of them really. and far as ?xit?sus: comment his list of music he likes speaks for itself LOSERS with no talent...!!!|`|AA12376076	Hey Smiley    Another old schooler goes down, and a good one at that.        Fav album: Their first - self titled  Fav tune: Tuesday's Gone     Billy was a walking songbook. Name it, he could play it.    Check this out at 1:20  http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-p-mn6Wth...    RIP|`|pElG2K61aa	Now it's just Gary Rossington left unless you count guitarist Ricky Medlocke, who was Skynyrd's drummer before they were signed. By then Ricky was in Blackfoot. The last time I saw Skynyrd was in 2005 and it just didn't feel right. Only Gary and Ricky on guitars (the famed triple attack gone) and Billy off to the left as usual, pounding away.    Billy Powell wasn't the most gifted pianist in the world but he made the most of what he had. You could hear his honky-tonk background in every solo. No soft-touch Floyd Cramer for that boy. I was privileged to meet Billy long ago and he was among the nicest rockers ever.    "Tuesday's Gone" will forever be my favorite for its composition and reflection but an overlooked gem from "The Last Rebel" is the song "Born To Run" about a truck driver being pushed to the edge by the new economy and having to carry on to keep his family. It has all the ingredients of a Skynyrd masterpiece.|`|yS61H04haa	Being southern , and Skynard is almost a religion to me :) ( the old stuff )    Personally, I don't care what others say. I love Skynard, and it makes me very , very sad that we lost another band member.|`|TY21iw5taa	Hmm,I didn't get an email for this..    I am not at all familiar with Lynyrd Skynyrd,sadly; with the exception of a couple of songs(including "Free Bird").    The one I do like by them is "That Smell", THE southern american rock song.That dark,smoky,wood-decorated,dart-board filled, rock pub ,down on the street where I live,and been going to since I was 14,keeps playing it in what seems to be a never-changing playlist of classic rock tracks."There's too much coke and too much smoke/Look what's going on inside you ...."    The theme song of the place,and those early rock-loving years of my life.Heh.    R.I.P Billy Powel.|`|0ysJ0KHWaa	Every skynyrd song is a great hit. Billy Powell will live on in our hearts and our souls forever.....

AA11402617	I looked that up a while back and that part about the squiggly line Stewie reciting a poem he wrote to Brian is a reference to non-fiction novel "Tuesdays with Morrie".  .  Oh, squiggly line in my eye fluid,  I see you there lurking on the periphery of my vision,  but when I try to look at you,  you scurry away.  Are you shy, squiggly line?  Why only when I ignore you do you return to the center of my eye?  Oh, squiggly line, it's all right.  You are forgiven.  .|`|8Q1MGgBRaa	oh squiggly line in my eye fluid i see you there lurking in the perifery of my vision but when i try to look at you you scurry away are you shy squiggly line why only when i ignore you do you return to the center of my eye oh squiggly line its alright you are forgiven.     i watched the entire video and typed it out after pausing it every so often :)

fQIxah8laa	I don't really like Annie that much. But I used to like Shenae Grimes a lot. But not that anymore. She let hollywood get to her to quickly in opinion. I actually heard that at some Canadian awards show, She was actually bitching about her being there. I mean come on. At least show some respect. Seriously. Anyways  she's not a good actress. She was in degrassi but not in 90210. She over reacts and does  weird facial expressions. She was better in degrassi in my opinion.|`|rabjcdjHaa	I am not a Shenae Grimes fan either! Shenae definitely overacts and her facial expressions are really annoying too! Shenae is just  a very annoying actress! Annie is my least favorite character on 90210!|`|MWz3Yb6Raa	yes i  hate her    she is freaking annoying|`|lzTUEtppaa	I can't stand Annie. She's the most annoying character on the show. I don't have anything against Shenae, but I hear she's really bitchy on set, and kind of a snob.   But she's Canadian so I'm obligated to like her.|`|1ifqiepjaa	i like her better as darcy on degrassi|`|yWuDSCGpaa	i feel bad for her and all her failed attempts at losing her virgnity.|`|35yJedgUaa	i like her. i think shes a good actress.   ...but that mole under her eye kinda bugs me a little.|`|74f5e4e698a7718dfb254fa5418f938baa	I don't hate the actress.  She seems okay.  I've never seen her in anything before so I couldn't compare.  The character Annie can be annoying and nauseating.  I guess that they have to have every type of teenager on there.

You are listening to good music that wont be embarrassing.    There are no little kids hearing curse words.    Headphones are better IF:    Your speakers arent very loud    You are in a crowded place.    You are listening to something you dont want other people to hear.    or IF:    You wanna be rude and ignore your mates.    Other than that you should just ALL be listening to mad music TOGETHER not wrecking your eardrums!!!      WOOOOOOOOOOT!!!|`|WFKRWO1Baa	speakers, they are less confining|`|EWz2HLTmaa	Speakers for parties and gatherings so everyone can hear. but also headphones for making it louder for yourself|`|myxXo4Ekaa	Although I use headphones, when I go to sleep with my iPod on, I like speakers.

xPwTDOh3aa	depends do you play alot of lead riffs if so jackson randy rhodes guitar is good for that  it has a good metal sound to it.

And they're not all that expensive, only around $600. They sound really good for alternative too, I just recorded with my band using a Strat the other day, and it ended up sounding really good

a11023e02b07df04afc3a46c9b088dfbaa	Have faith.  Just because YOU have never seen it, doesn't mean it isn't so.    No.  It's not unfair.  They are not judging on their own spiritual guilt-trip but on talent.      "You gotta have faith," sang George Michael.|`|quYp2Ajtaa	I dont think it matters and I think they would turn them down if they were bad. Maybe the lord helps gospel singers get in? Stop being a hater its kinda prejudice and not very appealing. Not to mention stereotypical|`|myw1GBiKaa	Ha. Dude, that's like saying they should ban opera songs. If the singer can do it, hand 'em a mic. Freedom of choice pal.     P.S. How could you even suggest banning someone from expressing their religion? If a frickin' Buddhist or muslim wants to get up there and chant on their knees, let them at it. You don't have to vote for them.|`|CNSGz12zaa	As fair as anything else..what is the difference. If it sounds good it is good..Sing the Star Spangled Banner, that is hard to boo!|`|Po2UqfvWaa	believe me when i say, if they suck, they'll get booted off. gospel is just another type of singing. i think perhaps you are young and new at all this. it will be ok sweetie|`|3af30c08175e2bc96bcd85540e09d175aa	American Idol is ultimately judged by the public. So, there are indeed some "atheist judges" in the audience. While no one may boo the gospel singer, they might not get enough votes either.    Also, on American Idol they usually have a theme for the songs each week, such as "Mariah Carey songs." It will be impossible to sing gospel every week. Right now it is only the qualifying rounds, and if someone sings gospel to best bring out their voice, who cares?|`|RvddYKqjaa	Your facts are not facts at all. Gospel does not help a person win if they can't sing. There should be no rule regarding gospel music. You don't know if anyone is an atheist judge because religion is not part of the program and it's no one's business.   I don't know where you got the idea that bad gospel always wins, but you are way off base.|`|so95ktlIaa	That is so true......and I agree with you. there needs to be some sort of rule against that.|`|sqaRnidQaa	dont the people vote on idol? i thought on idol you get to choose who stay n hu goes|`|UFhrD7DWaa	no that is not unfair.  maybe u should re-evaluate this.  and no not all you have to do is singa  gospel and win im sure the judges see something you dont.|`|wDOjkaYUaa	You bring up a very interesting interesting point. I think that they should  make it a rule to not allow gospel songs in American Idol.|`|VxhknQjEaa	No, not at all!  I accually think that it spreads joy, peace, and love to all the people around you and considering the fact that i'm catholic and everything, I think that everyone should love God and pray and sing about him and all the wondderful things he and his friends and relatives have done.  Anyway, why would you ask a  weird question like that?  I know I sound like I go to church everyday, but really I am a normal person like you asking stupid questions like you on this stupid website.|`|GUvw17PSaa	that is unfair, people should sing what ever they want|`|9bivpQdWaa	lets be honest about your jealousy and your stereotype     1.id say roughly 1.5 million audition and about 150 actually get to Hollywood so i don't really think singing gospel really helps everybody     2 the public vote for who they want to stay and who they want off so gospel wont save anyone there people voted for a bad singing asian than a gospel singer     3 the judges and the host are bogus cause simon yells at everyone paula thinks she get ignored randy just wants to bone paula and ryan just wants to bone simon     4 who's actually made it big after winning idol the only 2 i can think of is kelly clarkson and carrie underwood carrie does sing gospel but she got an amazing voice     so while you are mad at gospel singers they are just trying to make a living just like 90% of the world.    ty and good night|`|a41b90438e7313f21be94b8185543c19aa	When the people are voting, they don't vote for gospel just because its gospel.  Once the judges are done, its all up to the public.  So, there is no way around the truth.  If a person can't sing, they just can't sing.  A song can't make you a singer but, a singer can make a song.      Cheers!|`|Tw5BP4Z8aa	No it shouldn't be unfair.. The judges probably know its not hard to sing a gospel and would make them change it up, and if they aren't all that talented they will lose

Even if it wont happen its still fun and entertaining to think that it could happen.  If it gets old for you I guess it depends on what kind of shows you like but some people (including me) think its just entertaining and a lot better (and classier) than some other shows out there like rock of 1 & 2, rock of love bus, shot at love 1 & 2, flavor of love 1  2 & 3 and i love new york 1 & 2!|`|e11ba8cd62cf3654d99ded051bcd527aaa	I think that we watch it hoping that this kind of life and love is true, but as we all know that for the most of us it ain't gonna happen this way.  I think that we wish that we could be wined and dined like that, and have these fantasy dates, travel to exotic places, and just fantasize about it being us. I also think that just the way some of these people act is what keeps us coming back everytime.

A4IaSaaqaa	The title of the cartoon is I Love to Singa.  "I Love to Singa depicts the story of a young owlet who wants to sing jazz, instead of the classical music that his German parents wish him to perform. The plot is a light-hearted tribute to that of Al Jolson's film The Jazz Singer."    "The young owl, is unjustly kicked out of his family's house by his disciplinarian violinist father after he is caught singing jazz instead of Drink to Me Only with Thine Eyes to his mother's reed (pump) organ accompaniment. While wandering, he comes across a radio amateur contest, hosted by "Jack Bunny," and billing himself as "Owl Jolson," wins the contest, but not before his father has finally seen his son's potential and allowed him to freely sing jazz.
KOj8XOHPaa	One of my favorites is Sea Lion Woman.  It's more of an Afro/gospel beat, but it's bare enough to add moving bass lines and keys if you wanted.  (Feist covered this song too).|`|KBBonf97aa	You can't go wrong with her version of "I Put a Spell on You."  For some reason, that song seems like it was written for her.  I love how every singer who records it tweaks the phrasing a little to fit his/her style.  And since Nina Simone made a name for herself with distinctive phrasing, I've always loved her rendition.

ykeDRhjeaa	depends what you're doing    for songs with a lot of feeling,    try : A minor, C and a D minor, minors are real good for sad songs    for happy songs... E, G, C, D, all major    for rock songs... mostly E, G    and jazz, i like to playin in chords like Gmajor7, etc.. and some minor chords    blues... rulz em all... all yu need is feel, and yu culd use most of the chords, but ive seen E mostly    so E, G, D, C, Am, prolly throw in a F somewhere, and yu could write hundreds of thousands of songs with that.    hope this helps|`|2dPqad7Eaa	A and Em are prettyt good I use them alot also C and is really easy and nice. It depends what type of song do you want to play.|`|k9vEbo0xaa	A major, E major, and D major.     Maybe throw in a D minor!|`|UCmPNiWQaa	I always like to use Eminor and Gmajor together.

u8EFU9RWaa	Dakota Fanning could pull it off, but when I read the book it said that Jane had short brown boyish hair... I don't think dakota will want to do that to her long blonde hair. And plus, Alec and Jane are supposed to look pretty much identical, what is she going to do? have a complete makeover and play two people at once? XD     Vanessa didn't audition- there is no place for her. Leah is only mentioned in New Moon (when Jacob is telling Bella about how hard it was for sam i think). She doesn't actually come in until Eclipse (when the clearwaters are at the bonfire). Don't worry about that!    Um Taylor Lautner is still in, he got himself a six pack for Jacob (=]).    I think they were considering Prince Caspian dude or someone who looks like him for Aro (I know, weird). I'm not too sure who's playing the Volturi or the rest of the Quileute Werewolves, but I'm sure they'll pick some pretty good people who aren't exactly well known. I like how they did that for the cast of Twilight.     Anyway, they should be filming in March, so they would have a full list of the actors/actresses by then. Just look it up on google or something.    =) Hope this helped!|`|ar4B3rJJaa	Chris Weitz wants Dakota Fanning to take the role as Jane in New Moon but it is still undecided. Dakota said that it would be a great experience but she still hasn't decided yet. I personally don't think that she should do the role because she is too young and i don't think she could pull off the evil vampire look that everyone imagined that Jane would look like. The website below tells about the whole situation.  http://movies.yahoo.com/news/movies.eonl...    As for the rumors about Vanessa Hudgens playing the role as Leah Clearwater in New Moon, this is fake. Tabloids announced that she didnt even audition for the role.

DUg1IkTIaa	I would recommend the very brief recaps at wikipedia.org.  There is a page for each season with short recaps per episode.  Just search for "LOST Season 1", "LOST Season 2", etc.  The recaps are near the bottom of the page.    If you want just the significant things per episode, then check out lost.about.com.  The gal there has an interesting array of information, from very brief, to very detailed.  I think she's getting info from the writers, from what I can tell.  It's an excellent site to visit.|`|YIcBd569aa	www.tv-video.net has all the seasons and episodes online for free.|`|c302cbf4b446e1a459fa99e0177f27c7aa	http://www.watchtvsitcoms.com/lost.php|`|bfe33dd6863dc2ea013512a87921ec21aa	Rent out the dvds.

9KsdDIb7aa	Belly Dancing is GREAT for your abs if you do it right and have the right instructor, but thats sometimes hard to find.  You should try an at home video first, then start experimenting in front of a mirror to see what you like best for your show.  But honestly, ballet will do miracles for your abs, butt, arms, back... more then people realize.  And its a very good stress realiver too.  You could use alot of the moves from ballet class in your routine too :) GOOD LUCK!!
7Rj5xaWRaa	for your eyes, try make-up that would make them look bigger... eyeliner, mascara (I would say since her eyes are drawn thicker on top try putting less emphasis on the lower eyelid). For the rest of your face paler colors and for lips a light pink lip gloss.     For hair, try looking up photos of other people's cosplay and just cropping for the head maybe. cosplay.com and deviantart.com are good sites to look at. I figured you meant you didn't want to take in an anime picture (which is understandable), but if you meant no photo at all, um... her hair is cut at what shoulder/medium length ( a salon razor, a comb like tool that cuts jagged edges could do the ends of her hair) as for her bangs... they are cut in kind of a round triangle-shape. I don't know if that helps, but I hope so. ^_^|`|Rn73EbWoaa	as for shoes any black boot-like short shoes would work  EYES??? can you change those??? She has red eyes because shes a vamp.

2qVOjNvhaa	The scene is from "Sub Rosa" (1.07), where Tony and McGee break into the suspect's house.    By the way, the clip has been deleted from the episode airing on USA Network to make room for more commercials.  Such is the way with syndication.  Anyway it's in the unedited version on the DVD.

ZyGyDLsDaa	No. 1 ?????? In "Gremlins" 1 & 2, bright light bothers them, but the creature belongs to a youth, not a girl. Also, there's no older woman at a feast.   NOTE: In "Creepshow", the "Father's Day" segment, a severed head is in the middle of a cake.    No. 2 "The Unborn" (1991)? It's been so long since I've seen this, so I'm not certain. There also is a sequel with another monster baby: "The Unborn II" (1993).    I'm definitely on the wrong track and likely will delete this.

tDxGe7BCaa	I know many gay religious people, because as a matter of fact, people are born gay, so it doesn't make a difference.     I'm sure you also know a few/heard of a guy or girl who was brought up in a religious household, or to religious parents like many other people, and turned out to be gay/bisexual regardless (whether it be mormon, christian, etc their really is no difference btw).     People think Chet is gay, not because of the way he dresses, although many people do assume this due to stereotypes in today's society, but because of the hints he gives off.     For example, he blatantly called Scott "cute", (I don't know many straight males, that refer to other guys like that) was overly obsessed with JD's magnum condoms, and over-reacts when people suggest homosexuality. (Why over-react? Homosexuality is very present in today's world, or is it that he's just insecure and thats why he reacts?)    I'm not saying he's gay or not, because its up to him, and only he knows.|`|NHOCYIs1aa	The name Chet calls out gay and mormon from Utah.|`|9561bfcf1a05d328055061d4b26e8f40aa	Chet is actually one of my favorite cast members , i think guys that know how to dress are not gay it just means that they have a sense of style which is great i find that very attractive.  And Plus in the new episode he goes on a date with Alex , a super model that Scott is friends with .|`|RtHBnYSmaa	Religion has nothing to do with it. People are born gay. He was brought up as a Mormon. There's a difference. Don't be a hypocrite by pulling the same bullshit on Scott.|`|XlP0G1Woaa	Because he is  There are plenty of gay religious people, that has nothing to do with it. Most people especially males who are homophobic are in the closet   He said he was gay, screamed it with his purple shirt in his letting the fact the he thinks scott is cute slip in the form of a song when he was singing with ryan. Gay. All day. They all are, they whole season and cast is gay.|`|BE2vknbHaa	First off you can be gay and religious.Secoundly Chet fits the stereotype of what people believe is gay . I don't know if he is gay or not but he is Mormon and everyone on the show could be gay but he still probably wouldn't come out for the fear of what the church and his relatives would say.

One of my theories is that the island is actually a UFO, disguised to look like an island. Much like the Far Point Station in the Star Trek Series.  It was once called "Atlantis" in the Bermuda Triangle.    Another theory is that it's part of the Government's secret UFO project, where they have reverse-engineered things from UFOs hidden at Roswell. And the DI Stations were manned by extraterrestrials, who were "testing" Planet Earth inhabitants.|`|5NJbpdUpaa	Omg i love Lost!

yiLvl3L4aa	The Best Position For Women To Climax    The reverse missionary is identical to the  traditional missionary except that she is on top.  This is probably the easiest position for a woman  to climax because she can control the friction to  her clitoris and/or G-spot.    Since you typically want the women to orgasm first,  this would be one of your first positions and then  move to a position where the guy has full control  for his orgasm.    You can vary your leg positions by both of you  spreading your legs, or by alternating the one who  has them spread and the one who has them together.    The Best Position For Men To Orgasm    Practically every animal species utilizes the  rear-entry doggy-style position, so it is a  natural one for humans to enjoy, as well. Although  you wont have face-to-face contact, there are many  benefits. It is great for guys because it gives  them full control.    This is one of the best positions for hitting her  G-spot and allows you to fondle her breasts,  stomach, clitoris, back, neck and other sensual  spots. Even she can touch her clitoris in this  position.    She kneels before you (some women enjoy it more if  their head is down on a pillow) and you enter her  from behind.    The main benefit for the guy is a view of her  beautiful bottom and being able to see the action,  while getting incredibly deep penetration  (above-average guys need to be careful as deep  thrusts might hit her cervix, which can be quite  painful).

AA11881188	Kind of sounds like "What Mattered Most" by Ty Herndon.    *EDIT* Here's the Lyrics. I think of this because it says "Her eyes are Blue" then later it says "She moved out west when she was two", also "in '64 she was born" all of the things you mentioned.     I thought I knew the girl so well  If she was sad I couldn't tell  I missed the point, I missed the signs  So if she's gone the fault is mine  I know, I know a whole lot of little things  And even though I confess them one by one  She would still be gone    Her eyes are blue, her hair is long  In '64 she was born in Baton Rouge  Her favorite song is "In My Life"  I memorized her every move  I knew her books, her car, her cloths  But I paid no attention to what mattered most    I never asked, she never said  And when she cried I turned my head  She dreamed her dreams behind closed doors  That made them easy to ignore  And I know, I know I missed the forest for the trees  And all I have to show oh when she walked out the door  The cold facts and nothing more    Her eyes are blue, her hair is long  In '64 she was born in Baton Rouge  Her favorite song is "In My Life"  I memorized her every move  I knew her books, her car, her cloths  But I paid no attention to what mattered most    Her eyes are blue, her hair is long  In 64 she was born in Baton Rouge  Her father's tall, her mother's gone  She moved out west when she was two  The way she laughed, the way she loved  Oh my God what did I do|`|zhH36xEHaa	Her eyes were blue, her hair was long, in 64 she was born in Baton ROuge.....Ty Herndon-What mattered most|`|wA8Dyhq7aa	"The Prisoner's Song" by Vernon Dalhart, from 1925 is a "pretty old country song."

6IDBlIaMaa	I think its a part of Itachis power that is used to take down sasuke or maybe even madara. He probrally knew what might happen.|`|M8qLP7MLaa	Nope. I've been dying to know what kind of power he's been given. It must be something huge though, since Itachi said, "I hope the day never comes when you have to use it."    Itachi's done so much to protect Sasuke, he seemed to believe Naruto when he said he would find a way to protect the village and Sasuke, so I don't think it'll be something that would kill Sasuke. :/|`|2ogFk4Amaa	Oh yes, I forgot about that bird! Wonder what it does, it proboly activates like the power Itachi gave Sasuke when he looks into madara's eye.|`|SxXFofFtaa	I hope it comes up soon. Maybe it's some way for Itachi to come back from the dead! Probably not though. Or maybe Itachi just thought that Naruto was hungry and gave him a live bird to eat...|`|HMNvFBr5aa	Hey thanks for reminding me! But ya can't wait to see what it's for. :]|`|zIISRkjMaa	nup, havent forgotten. naruto will probably use it in his fight with either pein or sasuke. im hoping sasuke, that'll be more exciting.|`|mQyTjEAFaa	The point of the bird from Itachi going into Naruto is because Itachi was giving some of his power to him. This is because Itachi probably sensed that someday Sasuke was gonna attack the Leaf Village and Naruto wasnt strong enough then to stop him.|`|Rn73EbWoaa	Itachi is sooo smexy!!^^|`|1K2jCW2Taa	Um........                  Thanks for the reminder?

So my first advice to you is fix your grammar.     You're in high school.  Colleges love to see experience--yes. They also like to see volunteer work. Volunteer for a hospital/library/city hall. in short---apply for ANYTHING.     Third--colleges also like to see that you actually worked! You can apply for McD's or Burger King.  That's a way most teens start.  What's amazing is, most people dont' realise that little experience actually proves a lot about a student.  If you dont' want to work at a fast food joint, try a mall or as a casual employee at a library.

AA11278548	The show is called "My Own Worst Enemy" and it airs on NBC  It started airing in October until December 15, and it appears to have been cancelled- Googling it reveals such- however full video of all aired episodes are available streaming on the official NBC.com site (just go to Episode Guide)    Here's a summary from NBC.com: "Henry (Slater) is a middle-class efficiency expert living a humdrum life in the suburbs with his wife, Lily (Yara Martinez, "The Hitcher"), their two kids, a dog, and a minivan. Edward (Slater) is an operative who speaks 13 languages, runs a four-minute mile, and is trained to kill. Albright works at Janus Headquarters for Mavis Heller (Alfre Woodard, "Desperate Housewives"), a tough, extremely intelligent woman with a hidden compassionate side. Henry and Edward are polar opposites who share only one thing in common - the same body. When the carefully constructed wall between them breaks down, Henry and Edward are thrust into unfamiliar territory where each man is dangerously out of his element."    Here the link to the official site:

RtHBnYSmaa	If they're passionate, they shouldn't be deterred. Most people who want to get into the business can't afford it. American Idol probably seems like a nice alternative for them. Plus, if you make it far enough, you'll have a built-in fan base once your stuff hits the radio.|`|YSuc7L8taa	Most do not know that they are good and many don't appear to know they are bad!  Most do not have to money or knowledge to hire an agent so A.I. offers the general public the chance of a lifetime.  Given the success of the winners, it does work.  BTW, two days is a short wait compared to the years it would take otherwise.

8vGq6cRTaa	The problem is everybody would like to do that. And these are small venues so there may not BE much backstage.

I think of music that way, like a music radio with a top 10 list of songs. I can say what bands are "popular"  Rush, Van Halen, Jimi Hendrix, among others.

I decided to get off and I even told my sister i was getting off but right when i went to get off she decided to go down. I was hanging lopsided off the board (foot just barely touching the ground) for a quite some time. My sister was laughing really hard and refused to let me down. When she finally did let me down i fell over. I ended up getting a bruise in a private place.   Another thing is people seem to have a problem with locking bathrooms and i always walk in on them. I always seem to be with friends when this happens.|`|tBTGwOmHaa	At the time it wasn't funny but when I was 5 I went on a trip to Morocco to visit relatives in an apartment in Casablanca. Well my cousins took me to the roof and I was told to push a stray shopping cart of the roof. I did and my cousins told me that throwing shopping carts of roofs were very illegal and the police were going to come and throw me in prison.

Looking to the future, he said, "We're doing New Moon in March, and currently I'm doing a movie called Warrior, which is my movie, which is really nice. It's a coming-of-age story, and it's nice to have Twilight open doors where I can front-lead a movie."|`|aPGPbbz7aa	RUMOUR RUMOUR RUMOUR !   i rekon it is 93658195% RUMOUR !   because i know at the moment he is shooting a new movie called " the warrior " and well i know ashley greene ( alice ) is in it too. so pretty much if they take kellan they take ashley with him! and i rekon that is not gona happen + kellan can buff up any day .

Despite the magazine's New York focus, its subscription base is expanding geographically; in 2003 there were more subscribers in California (167,000) than in New York (166,000) for the first time in the magazine's history. The average age of subscribers rose from 46.8 in 2004 to 48.4 in 2005, compared with a rise of 43.8 to 44.0 for the nation, and a rise from 45.4 to 46.3 for news magazine subscribers. The average household income of a New Yorker subscriber was $80,957 in 2005, while the average income for a U.S. household with a subscription to a news magazine was $67,003, and the U.S. average household income was $51,466.    usually a wide variety of people -- everyone has their own likes & dislikes

DibFrwxlaa	Run, DMC, and Jam Master Jay were an early rap group out Hollis, Queens.    They're awesome, go watch a movie called Krush Groove to see more about them.

What's wrong with you?! haha, Run DMC is awesome. They're a rap group from the 80s.|`|NQ3XZElFaa	Run-D.M.C. were an influential new school rap group, best known for their 1986 album "Raising Hell," featuring a cover of "Walk This Way" featuring Aerosmith.    They're pretty good, but no Public Enemy.    It is a common misconception that Run-D.M.C. are old-school rap. Old school rap refers to the rap of the late 1970's and early 1980's, like Grandmaster Flash. Old school rap has very  electronic production. New school rap, which began in 1983 or 1984, was characterized by rhythmic production.|`|tbwfSPI7aa	Alright run dmc is a group but the lead singer got killed. Sorry I guess not everything ends so well :(|`|AA11787482	This question made me feel OLD!    RUN DMC is old skool rap.  Back whn rap was incredible and far from the modern day stuff.  They were before it was about guns and drugs.  They were before it was about pimpin' and robbery.  They came from the era where it was about rap battles and who has the best DJ.    Rev Run is actually the brother of Russel Simmons.  LL Cool J, The Beastie Boys, Run DMC - these were the good days of rap.    "Mary Mary, My Adidas, Run's House, King of Rock, It's Tricky, Down with the King...  so many more.    Run DMC in 1 word "Pioneers!"

tuATxHsVaa	I have played a tiny bit of guitar in my day. Finger style is probably easier on classical guitars because the spacing between strings is a little larger. You can play with your fingers on both, though. Some musicians play with a pick and their fingers at the same time on the acoustics.    But more to the point - your choice of guitar has more to do with what kind of music you are playing. Classical guitars are classical for a reason. If you want to do pop type songs, most of the modern stuff will sound more appropriate on your typical, standard Gibson-type acoustic guitars. I like Martin. They make great guitars. Yamaha and Fender also make good stuff.    Classical guitars tend to sound a bit like pianos when you pluck them. So how you play them and what you do with them depends more on the sound you are after. You can do whatever you want with your guitars.|`|FCFdYuchaa	http://guitar-classic-guide.blogspot.com

58UB5lqRaa	What a load of rubbish, Bands are allowed in  Hotels, how ever if the hotel happens to be close to homes where people live, there is a sound level they are not allowed to go above, and believe me the band  would have to be ear shattering to go above this level.  most hotels i know keep to the rule near homes. and that rule has been in force for quite a few years, it certainly has not affected the music industry here in western Australia|`|ZII6YCk1aa	Sounds like a boring azz pub.|`|MwiBGBK1aa	That's complete rubbish!|`|a606b1fc03bca268f8701ae319a21a94aa	There's only one pub in the town I live in (in Scotland), and I actually never go in it because it doesn't have any music.  Music is such a big part of socialising I just couldn't imagine not having it in pubs.  I'd stay in and drink in the house and invite friends round, and let the pubs close down for all I care.  This should be decided by the people who drink in them and live around them - or perhaps not even the people who live around them, unless the pub was opened after they moved in, then and only then might I see their point.

1K2jCW2Taa	"Zorro" is Spanish for "fox," I believe.  It is the name of a Mexican-American (technically Mexican-American, since his adventures continue after California's adoption into the United States) hero from comic books.  He does wear a mask, as well as carry a sword and carve "Z" into various objects as a hallmark.    The mask is to protect his identity.  Same reason why Peter Parker wears a mask when he becomes Spiderman, and why Clark Kent wears glasses when he's not Superman, and why Bruce Wayne wears a mask when he goes capering as Batman.  What other reason could there be to wear a mask?|`|WMem5AGoaa	A romantic Spanish hero w/ a sword who wears a black mask who, hops on a black stallion horse and is in love w/ Esmeralda and etches a "Z"  his signature mark everywhere he goes.|`|A2ODlbKfaa	a guy|`|CNSGz12zaa	He is the gay blade and yes he wears a mask.|`|wMJYscXtaa	he fights bad people. he has a cape and a hat. all black. yes a wears a mask around his eyes.|`|98BZdVGJaa	He is a Spanish Super hero.

I just went on itunes like 10 minutes ago  and its already number 10 on the itunes chart.  They just released it on itunes either yesterday or today  and its already on the top ten.  I thought he sucked when he was rappin but now   i've realized he can't rap or rock.  (:|`|Yor2Vwk8aa	if it did, i would be saddened|`|MkfbtQhpaa	i like the beat dats about it..  i really hate when he slurr up his damn voice!!  dat wat made me stop liking him grrr..i miss da old wayne =[    the carter 2 lil wayne..oh well ill just continue to listen to real hip hop eh      lmao at the cmnt above^^^  i agree everyone is all on his d****|`|exBSF31yaa	itsz a baddazz song if you can relate to it|`|mI85T8P0aa	its only going to be number one because of his fans, i don't like the song myself. they just need to stop calling it Rock because its not.
NHsarvs8aa	It won't be rock. He doesn't know how to make rock.|`|3FnhJluuaa	now i defenitly know that when lil wayne comes out with his rock album the rock genre will go down the freaking gutters.

He looks like a monkey.|`|rR6lwxjjaa	i dont care much what weezy does|`|e9Q51Oxyaa	Couldn't care less. Either way I'm not going to pick it up. Do I doubt him so much as to say it would suck? in all honesty, Yes.|`|MeMV5vJIaa	NO WAY, UH-UH, NOOOOOOO BLECH NOOO WAY|`|qz9trhYhaa	I think Lil Wayne should kill himself. Now.|`|y1xPK3Txaa	It depends.    If it sucks, I'll laugh at the fact that lil wayne has utterly failed at something.  Again.    If it catches me off guard and ****ing rocks like Body Count, I'll scurry back to my hideout, defeated.|`|Z5o6uu0naa	Ive said it before, Ill say it now.    Trash.    I'd congradulate him if it actually sounded good-- but I heard it.|`|oUZLZusjaa	It doesn't really bother me, he can call it what he wants it's still gonna suck as much as all of his other stuff.|`|hMPI3TxTaa	Depends on how good it is, and if he has a band.|`|CWUHwhOpaa	ITS JUST WRONG RAP SHOULD NOT IMPOSE ON WHAT ROCK HAS SPENT SO LONG TO BUILD AND RUIN IT WITH THERE SO CALLED "MUSIC" IT REALLY ANGERS ME THAT PEOPLE ACTUALLY CONSIDER WHAT THESE "GANSTERS" PUT TO BE MUSIC I'LL TELL YOU WHAT IT IS, ITS A GUY TALKING ABOUT SMOKING A JOINT WITH A CRAPPY BASS LINE PLAYING IN THE BACKGROUND.

"Lollipop" was huge for a while, now he just sucks a**|`|vK9Vv9gjaa	how dare he, even hip hop fans cast him out thats why hes trying rock but we will crucify him.|`|tb1uoJe0aa	He is a pretty good rapper, but i think he is getting a lil risky switching it up to rock and roll! i mean, at the concert tonight, he just held the guitar and strumed one note, a note a person thats never picked up a guitar could play. Just if he sticks with gangsta rap he will do fine, and since when have ya heard of a black gangsta rock and roll singer that cant play guitar?!|`|2qYXDJ4Naa	http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hKflA2xvG...    i ****** hate rap  its ****** annoying  lil wayne ******* sucks  he should stick to rap
4LH9RXtuaa	I think you're thinking of the live version off Boingo Alive.|`|FwNwm3sgaa	you can use this software called ezlyrics to get really good lyrics , they've got almost every song! and you can go backwards from lyrics to song title too.|`|VSe92G4vaa	The version I like best is a cover by a British band, Mle.  It sounds similar to what you're describing, so maybe it's what you heard.  Either way, they're a pretty good band, high-energy, so you might wanna check them out.

vsy4QMHMaa	Chickering Brothers? I'm quite suspect. Jonas Chickering's firm was named Chickering, and Chickering & Co.,     With partners John and William Mackay, they were known as Chickering & Mackays,     Finally in 1853 Jonas' sons Thomas E., C. Frank and George H. Chickering reorganized the firm as Chickering and Sons.    As a subsidiary of Aeolian-American they were branded "Chickering" or "Chickering and Sons." Under Gibson/Baldwin they are known as "Chickering"     ... This whole Chickering Brothers thing sounds fishy to me. Though I suppose the Chickering boys could have run off and started their own firm, but I got nothin' on that.    EDIT: I should read my own books, Chickering Bros. is outlined in Alfred Dolge's "Pianos and their Makers"

And also there is Genius on iTunes, you select one song and it'll give you more songs based on what you selected.      Good luck, I hope this helps!|`|9KsdDIb7aa	Honestly, I don't know your crowd so I won't give specific songs, but rather websites that have the latest music.  For some reason when people hear mixtapes and songs that have good beats but they don't know all the words, they get excited n usually ask me for a copy of the CD.  Its also good to throw in an old hit just so that others don't feel too left out...like an old school Missy Elliot song or something lol But rapbasement.com, allhiphop.com, livemixtapes.com they have the most recent news, and you can browse through all the artists from Gucci Mane and Lil Wayne to Brandy    Good Luck!!! (have some food too, people will stay for food even if they don't like your music ;) )
9KsdDIb7aa	The best thing to do is 'study' your subject and make sure you engage your crowd.  When you have a enough material to do more then one show and they aren't repeats, start going around to colleges and open mic clubs....see how people respond to you.  Then you need to get your name out there and people will start paying you more.  Don't try to do too much at once, it takes patience.  Steve Hofstetter is a good example, he did local gigs, started a facebook trying to get a million friends, then moved to Myspace, created his own website with a few quicktime short shows, made a few CD's and he just keeps getting bigger, if you have the dedication it can be a big money career, GOOD LUCK!!

cgfE0yyzaa	To be frank, as much as I want more Zero no Tsukaima, 4th season production was never officially announced, let alone release date. Sure, the anime left tons of plot holes and they could always make a sequel, but it's all speculation until it's announced in some official publications like magazine or company website.    MyAnimeList usually add an anime page ASAP whenever the show is confirmed: http://myanimelist.net/anime.php?q=tsuka...|`|DiKV2VO0aa	I have heard rumors of a 4th season coming. Some people said February 2009, but i don't believe that soon. There is a lot more story from the light novels, and there isn't much closing, so i am there probably will be S4

vqg6wpCLaa	Wrong section, Alice Lover. Please, go to Jokes and Riddles and post this question there and STOP SPAMMING COMICS AND ANIMATION! I'M FED UP WITH YOU STUPID FANGIRLS!    Give me as many thumbs downs as you want, but it will make no difference. If you and your fellow idiots could actually read, you'd realize that there is a section called BOOKS AND AUTHORS (even though it's no book...).     Also, to the person who said Harry Potter = Twilight, pretty much...how is that? As far as I'm concerned, Harry Potter is much better and has a more interesting plot. And guess what! The characters have depth and aren't perfect! O_O    One more thing.  Leave now and never come back.   Leave now and never come back!   LEAVE NOW AND NEVEEER COME BACKKK!|`|POXOqhOYaa	Kindly redirect yourself to Entertainment and Music, then scroll down to the Movies section. Oh, don't worry I'm kidding I know sometimes Yahoo puts the questions in weird places so it's fine if you made a mistake. :)    Anyway, yes I did enjoy the Twilight movie and the Twilight book series but I think I liked the books more because they have much more detail and they're much more easier to tote around then a portable DVD player and a Twilight DVD, I would be worried about losing it or scratching it.    And my favorite character would have to be Bella because since she had a very vaque personality with not much direction just about anyone could have picture themselves in Bella's shoes and it seemed to make the movie more entertaining. They do that in video games like The Legend of Zelda to you know.    I hope I helped you out, haha.   And later on, fellow Twilight fan!|`|mxZUt1iMaa	Twilight is neither a comic nor is it animated.

I used to like it until stupid fan girls like you started spazzing over it and completely ruined it. This is the wrong category. It's neither a comic, nor an animation.

TwQLIf22aa	I have personally ordered student instruments from sharmusic.com and swstrings.com. I have never been disappointed. A price range of $150-$200 is the least you would want to spend on an outfit (with case and bow). Anything less and you might need repairs or adjustment right away (broken strings, bridges and pegs, strings set too high). I see students bring ebay junk to school every year and it's just not worth the trouble.    These models are fine, you might find used ones for less too:    http://www.swstrings.com/catalog/showIns...    http://www.sharmusic.com/moreinfogroup.a...    These are going to be sturdy instruments with a good tone but nothing like a hand-made instrument. As you spend more on outfits the sound will become warmer with a less tinny/nasal quality. You really get what you pay for at these mail order sites.    If you can spend a little more I would upgrade the bow to a carbon-fiber bow. Not a "brazilwood" bow. $100 should get you a decent one. At Shar you can even try out an instrument at home for the cost of shipping. For a really good "Wow, that sounds awesome" violin you'll need to spend more. Pros always spend at least several 1000, often much more and for good reason. Don't forget a shoulder rest (try a brand called Kun for less than $20) and a humidifier (Dampit $5 or so) to keep the seams from coming unglued in the winter.    It's great to have the expert advice of a local dealer, but realize they will mark up the price 100s of dollars every time.    Good Luck!

R3drlhFsaa	Yes, it is from Friends.  It's when Chandler hooks up with Joey's girlfriend (the one who liked the Velveteen Rabbit..I don't know what her name was but Chandler reeeeally liked her).    Joey says: "Did you have sex with her?"  Chandler says: "No, we just kissed!"  Joey: "That's even worse!"  Chandler: "How is that worse?!"  Joey: "I don't know but it's just as bad!"|`|vQuwykoeaa	I'm not sure if thats the actual quote. But there was a line similar to that in a Kevin Cline and Meg Ryan movie called French Kiss. Where Kevin Cline said buying sex from a prostitute was cheaper than just asking for a kiss from them. Because a kiss you actually had to mean, therefore kissing in his opinion is worse than sex. I have no idea if that helps or not. Hopefully it does sort of...but now that i think about it...maybe it was from friends

From Wikipedia....  *On January 9, 2009 the last produced episode of Lipstick Jungle aired. As it was advertised as a season finale, the true status of the show is unknown. Over 23,000 people have currently signed a petition to save the show online.    On January 15, 2009 it was announced that the show is not yet cancelled and could be brought back for episodes based on how the new pilots are doing.[11]    On January 27, 2009 the peacock network announced that the show would get the "Friday Night Lights Treatment" implying that the show will return on another of NBC Universal's networks for a third season and then replay on NBC midseason.*    I LOVE this show and I'm proud to say my signature is one of the 23,000 that signed the petition to save it.....    Keep watching your local listings because Its going to be back! It H A S to be!|`|hLKzXjfPaa	yea, it was canceled due to low ratings. They announced it after episode 7.

000db28fb52ab31dee59ac037328db75aa	Heres the complete list of songs from the movie:     http://reelsoundtrack.wordpress.com/2009...
7365b5fc6686784fac36d66f144f7b79aa	They link together through the Corvinus line.    Alexander Corvinus, a 15th century Hungarian warlord who was the sole survivor of a plague that ravaged his village and turned him into the first immortal. He had twin sons.  One was bitten by a bat and one by a wolf.  Marcus became the first Vampire and William the first Werewolf.    Marcus turned Viktor, who basically took over.  He made the Werewolves his slaves.  As we learn in the new Underworld movie, Lucian was born of a Werewolf but he was human.  Therefore, he became the first Lycan - a werewolf able to change back into human form.  Lucian fell in love with Viktor's daughter, Sonja. When Viktor found out about it and that Sonja was pregnant, he gave the order to kill them both.  But Lucian broke free after Sonja was killed and that is what started the war.    Does that help?|`|wWZcHKKTaa	Well the new one is going back in time to the leader of the lycans that died in the first one, but was in love with Marcus's daughter(vampire) he had her killed. anyway the last ones about the lycans freeing themselves from slavery b/c they used to be the vampires slaves.|`|45e71bc8ca903cd0b9c0e4294eff6f04aa	there is no steady link    i honestly think they steal scripts from 7 year olds|`|ecUtS1TRaa	The leader of the lycans Lucian, was in love with the vampire elder Viktor's daughter Sonja who was a vampire. Sonja was pregnant with Lucian's half breed child and Viktor had her killed which angered Lucian and started the war, also that the lycans were used as slaves for vampires

They're amazinggg :]|`|NwIjasICaa	campaign! theyre my fav :) heres their link:http://www.myspace.com/campaignsound|`|zCSUlmmPaa	I personally like Disciple, Pillar, Skillet, Kutless, Flyleaf, and Superchic (k)|`|3PfkXTouaa	ApologetiX its a band that does parodies like life styles of the rich and the nameless and lazy brain. etc. their pretty awesome.|`|ICSkaKjAaa	I don't know about others, but some Christian rock and and rap (I think) that I like include: Tobymac, Relient K, Barlow Girls, Hawk Nelson, DC Talk, Audio Adrenaline... You can look on iTunes in the iMixes and search Christian... then there are lots of bands to look at and stuff.   Hope this helps.|`|UxbjvAaRaa	uhm. if your looking for rock/ alternitive with christian i suggest.  sanctus real.  barlow girl  toby mac  && those are the best.|`|y0SCzMJiaa	Fly Leaf , Super Chick|`|q7KPRyQ0aa	Skillet :)|`|ZIu4DVslaa	switchfoot|`|APN67ZUqaa	I am a teenager and totally in-sync with christian rock.

'cause then, I'm sure you can find a lot of clean music, that doesn't necessarily have to be Christian.|`|3J7AgKmkaa	Underoath is too heavy, but bands like Switchfoot and Relient K have hundreds of songs that can fall under any genre. I would at least look them up.|`|N4pBC5dUaa	Hey! I would recommend Hawk Nelson, Switchfoot, P.O.D., Audio Adrenalin, Casting Crowns, David Crowder Band, and Reliant K. Good luck!|`|AA12358887	Skillet  Kutless  Thousand Foot Krutch  Disciple  Seventh Day Slumber  Red    I hope thats not too much rock but these are some of my favorite christian artists!
rKz5rBJ6aa	the best song that i could recomend is New Soul by Yael Nim! it has this contempoary laid back pop vibe going on!Hope this helped!                                          Anne!

I'm guessing an email to the publishers at totp.magazine@bbc.co.uk should provide you with the answer you need.    Good luck.|`|h6NqNzHAaa	Yes you can although they may charge you more money for a foreign address.
3FnhJluuaa	omg can you people stop asking the same freaking questions. Its so annoying.|`|LRLu1ofNaa	These are my reasons for not liking them, and it is just my opinion:  They are talentless.  They can not sing. (If you don't believe me, listen to them live)  They sound constipated when they attempt to sing.  They are not cute at all.  They are really overrated.  They seem really cocky and annoying.    edit: I don't listen to them. Sometimes I'm forced to, though. They have played the Jonas Brothers at my school before. It's horrible.     And my reason is not because they are gay; I like most gay people. They're nice.|`|897a2fe6b6c76e90fe430c2613a38ffdaa	woooh i agree.     people just like to bash what big. The jonas brothers are big and an easy target. I really don't see the point of it, and it just makes these "haters" seem kind of pathetic.|`|1RwZZ2aPaa	Hey. We all have our different opinions. Some of us like the Jonas Brothers. Some of us don't. It's not that big of a deal. Haters are entitled to our own opinions and so are fans. What does it matter? Just let fans love and let haters hate.|`|kHY0eMVraa	1. People like you who don't know good music  2. There fans are just annoying  3. There songs suck  4. They are overrated  5. They where skinny jeans when they're fat  6.  I like rock music not pop  7. They can't sing  8. They seem very fake  9. They have no talent|`|rd2BA81aaa	They are to teeny booper and for teens  They are arrogant and cocky  Their music and lyrics are dumb  Their voices are whiny  Their music videos are wierd    They SUCK|`|070241b6658b805808500c418a72a4c6aa	Wow!  Everyone has different tastes in music.  It's really not that serious.    I, for example, completely abhor Hannah Montana. (Miley Cyrus)  She drives me beyond insane..  but apparently.. a ton of people like her..  It's just different people.. different opinions.|`|Hgk6563eaa	the whiney i-haven't-gone-through-puberty voices  bad music videos  the pathetic lyrics  they care more about how they look than what they write  the whole purity ring thing that just sucks for them   they are short too...|`|Lh6pnwqHaa	Cause they don't have the best voice in the world and there ugly. Period.|`|YJr5kEPOaa	They are too goody-two shoes for some people. And their music is kinda kiddish. And most of their songs sound exactly the same. I'd say the jonas brothers are more for a younger audience (8-12 year olds)    And everyone is allowed to have their own opinions, so you can calm your hormones.  :]  Not everyone has to love the jonas brothers|`|y7gAhnynaa	i dont like them cus they seem fake. like one moment theyr all disney kids and the next they try to rock out like 20 yearolds. i dont like them also cus they play the boy band cutesyy card all the time like "oh were the jonas brothers. every one LOVES us and we can do what ever we want!!!" yeah theyr gona die out just like the love for nsync or backstreet boys and all other buy bands. im sorry to say this but, i know alot of people who were soooo JB carzy and now they dont even care. when they start to get old and not as "cute" people will not like them anymore. hate to say it... but its true.

3enJVNDdaa	NCIS Season 2 Episode 23 "Twilight" Original air date 5/24/2005
AA11278548	Cameron is the "blonde chick". You probably just got confused because prior to the last season (4)-before she quit and wound up int he ER, her hair was indeed, brown. The brunette this season is Thirteen (Remy Hadley).        * Dr. Allison Cameron (Jennifer Morrison)  (blonde, used to be brunette prior to season 4)- Department: Emergency Medicine, immunologist. Cameron was written as an earnest and sincere character and the most empathetic of the team. Her character history reveals an early marriage to a victim of thyroid cancer, whose subsequent death had a lasting impact on her. In the first season, she has a flirtatious relationship with House, but eventually embarks upon a tenuous affair with Robert Chase. Cameron resigned at the end of Season 3, but returned in Season 4 as a member of the Princeton Plainsboro Emergency Room staff.     * Dr. Remy Hadley aka "Thirteen" (Olivia Wilde)- (Brunette) is an internist. Her nickname originates in the numbers that House assigned to each of his fellowship applications in "The Right Stuff," with hers being  13. She is noted for the many mysteries surrounding her character. Thirteen is bisexual. Her mother had Huntington's, and a blood test later proved that she has it too. Thirteen is currently a member of Foreman's study that is studying the effects of a new drug on Huntington's symptoms.        * Dr. Chris Taub (Peter Jacobson)- (short, balding) is a plastic surgeon who has proved adept at, like House, working around the "rules" that Cuddy imposes. Ironically Cuddy suggested Taub become a member of House's new diagnostic team because his knowledge and combative nature would be able to keep House focused. Though married he has already cheated on his wife and has made comments that suggest he would be willing to do so again.        * Dr. Lawrence Kutner (Kal Penn)- (Indian) is a sports medicine specialist. Out of all the fellows, Kutner is the most enthusiastic and the one most likely to go along with House in taking risks.        * Dr. Robert Chase (Jesse Spencer)  (the blond guy with the Australian accent) Department: Surgery, intensivist. Dr. Chase's demeanor appears to have been either influenced or amplified by House, as he has previously displayed a penchant for insulting patients behind their backs, takes clear and vicarious joy in watching House tear into others, finds House's antics more amusing than others do, and repeats House's mantra of "everybody lies" whenever a patient's full disclosure of any required medical history is called into question. Moreover, when suggesting treatments to diagnoses, Chase is arguably the most creative member of House's staff, often proposing unconventional treatments that had not previously been considered, but whose perceived effectiveness is generally agreed upon. Chase was fired by House at the end of Season 3, but he returned in Season 4 as a member of Princeton Plainsboro's surgical staff.      Dr. Eric Foreman (Omar Epps)  (African American guy) Department: Diagnostic Medicine, neurologist; attended Johns Hopkins Medical School. Of all the members of House's staff, it is strongly implied that Foreman performed better than the other fellows academically throughout college and medical school. However, during the pilot, Dr. House tells Foreman that a major factor in his hiring was the fact that he was a former juvenile delinquent who once broke into houses and had 'street smarts'. As a result, he frequently voices his disapproval of House's maverick methods and daring decisions. Foreman resigned at the end of Season 3, feeling that the more time he spent with House, the more he became like him. Foreman then took a position as Head of Diagnostic Medicine at New York Mercy Hospital. During that time, he saved a patient's life by going against their protocols, something that House frequently does. Foreman is then told that while he may have saved the patient's life, he cannot be there if he cannot be trusted to obey his senior medical officers. Foreman is then fired. Although he applied at other medical facilities, no one would hire him because of the incident, attributing it to his past association with House. He later returned to Princeton Plainsboro because Cuddy was the only person willing to hire him after his actions.

Each year of the 12-year cycle is named after one of the original 12 animals. Each animal has a different personality and different characteristics. The animal is believed to be the main factor in each person's life that gives them their traits, success and happiness in their lifetime.    The Chinese zodiac refers to a pure calendrical cycle; there are no equivalent constellations like those of the occidental zodiac. In imperial times there were astrologers who watched the sky for heavenly omens that would predict the future of the state, but this was a quite different practice of divination from the popular present-day methods.

To anyone who said their dream guitar is a signature model:  You do know that owning someone's signature model doesn't mean it's made the same way theirs is, right?  I mean, do you really think the Steve Vai model guitar is going to be built to the same specs as the guitars Vai uses?  I highly doubt that.

Cheers.|`|mfwDnMupaa	(We call ours 1 and 2)  I like my day 1 better 'cause I have 1 hour and half study hall and another 45 minute one.

I just have English, Spanish, and Chemistry(not to mention a 45 minute study hall).|`|H9gmJYdmaa	I don't like either.    A= Gym  B= Double chemistry    :(|`|kumK00asaa	i dont have that. i've got this:  monday-all periods    tuesday-even periods:   2, 4, 6, lunch, this thing called cluster where we do hw. then enrichment where we can sign out to other classes if we need help.    wednesday (odd periods)-1, 3, 5, lunch, 7    thursday-2, 4, 6, lunch, cluster/enrichment    friday- 1, 3, 5, and 7.    i like odd days. its all the easy periods :)|`|SHJYhu3iaa	A days.

Hm, I'll saay A was better my senior year I believe.|`|CRuxWsi0aa	B. I have English, French, and Latin, all in a row. It's great.|`|a2b5549c80fdb444d8075ce8c9c9d17baa	Um,what?|`|hYLi7xXQaa	both for varying reasons  A Days + I actually learn stuff that I find interesting              - i have all three of my APs back to back right after french 1v  B Days + I have Math! My english teacher rocks. I have no AP classes              - I sit around and dont learn anything for 90 minutes in chemistry and english has a lo9t of work, but its nothing of value its just for teh sake of working    so i guess i dont like either better, but i hate a days more for the sole purpose of homework. school would rock without it|`|26ecb6a986134f697709409245cb1cdcaa	uhhh what does A and B stand for?|`|J0G4lRrNaa	where I live all the days are the same and we only have 4 classes a day.

I saw this funny looking white hat, so I put it on my head. I heard people laughing at me, including my mom, so I asked her what was wrong. She called me over and whispered to me that it was a jock strap. I had no idea what that was being only 10, so I asked her. When she told me, I could feel my cheeks turn hot and red.

Complaining about being fat: I'm a couch potato, and I'm round like one too.  When trying to get out of eating vegetables: I already ate them, I just puked them back up again, and they look the same.   When trying to stay home from school: Can't you see I'm sick?

You're making people laugh!     If you want to make a living doing it, however, your comedy material and your personal style need to be unique, practiced, current and good. You also need to be persistent, have a thick skin, and a good agent. Whether you can pull all that together will determine whether you can make a career as a professional comedian. Good luck!|`|y9z65Rndaa	you can be, if you really want it. but you have to be dedicated to tour dates, fans, and not to mention material. i'm not too sure you can send videos on youtube and let people decide if this is a job for you.|`|d888364a81462da1d57820f6382f0a14aa	If your freinds and family believe in you that is a plus that would be all a person needs to go on and do what must be done.|`|ZDDBiBo5aa	the only person who can determine if you "can" be a comedian is you.  one question to ask yourself about being any particular thing when you grow up is: do I feel like I "have" to be a comedian [or whatever]?  if you don't feel that strongly about something as big of a long-shot as becoming a successful comedian, you probably won't make it.

If they watched legally at nbc.com or hulu.com then that would help the ratings.  Instead they choose to go with illegal sites like surfthechannel, which hurts the show.

Where is her stylist? Somebody fire them ASAP. She actually would've looked good if her face wasn't sandwiched between thick curtains of fake extensions, and she weren't wearing high-waisted jeans with a top 2 sizes too small and cheetah print belts allowing any bulge to spilleth over.

Look at her arms and face.She's far from her Daisy Duke days, that's for sure.|`|se6I1xFhaa	I don't think Simpson looks fat. So she put on 5 pounds. Boo hoo hoo!  Who cares! People put on weight and take it off all the time. It just takes more time to take the weight off. She looks fine.     There are other problems to focus on right now and Simpson and her little weight gain isn't one of them.     The media just digs up crap so it can spin a story around for people to talk about and form an opinion, even if it's a pointless story.|`|0ec82562a26aa12a1149c87e311c0d12aa	She definitely looks fat.  and needs a fashion makeover.

ZkBLNj6Vaa	Sometimes you can overuse your cards, and do too many readings in a day.  Sometimes the cards aren't charged with the right energy and will give out fuzzy answers.  When I do readings for others, sometimes the first layout is not the best one, and it will take more shuffling until there is the layout that "clicks" with me to be the right one, even though I haven't looked at the cards yet.      Test the cards.  Do a daily reading, and get three cards in the beginning of the day, but don't look at them.  Then at the end of the day, write down what happened, then look at the cards, and see if those cards describe the day or not.  If they don't, you might have to scrub up your deck.  Not literally, but it means to treat your cards correctly again: silk wrapper or a little box for storage, cleanse them in moonlight or under a burial of salt (in a plastic bag, don't want to mess them up), and keep a clear quartz crystal around them for creating an energy shield around them.  It's a lot of work but it might reset the cards to give better results, if you doubt the results right now.    oh look, a reading:  the Star, reversed; 6 of pentacles/disks; the moon, reversed.  Something tells me your deck isn't clicking right, that you're not accessing the best parts of your unconscious to look into the cards, that you're just reading the interpretations out of a book.|`|qNKK4hLDaa	i would trust them i guess lol    one day i had two HUGE projects to do and being the procrastinater i am, i waited till like midnight to start one, and by then i just didn't care enough to do the other one, so i went on myspace and found tarot cards somehow and then it was like "balblabla you will luck out by chance blablalballbalbal"    and then i didn't have to turn in my project!!!!!|`|RcCJSSMPaa	Yes, and if you're Scorpio you are probably pretty intuitive even if you don't think so.  And you deserve good things, so look at the good side!  And you know all the cards have a light and dark side, so go with your intuition!|`|94edef5328778797a8731944e4bde321aa	This really isn't a question about whether or not you trust your cards. It is about wanting to trust your cards. As human beings we often ask questions and if faced with an undesirable answer, ignore the event altogether.           However, tarot cards do truly have a great and mystical power. For this reason, I would give some consideration to your cards. You should make sure that you are doing it right. As you said, you are not a psychic, and you can therefore never be sure about your answers.           For this reason, I would highly recommend visiting a true psychic and seeing whether or not these events will actually happen. You should visit the site I will put in the source of this answer. They are real psychics and can help you with your problem.

I'm all fur Christian screamo like...

It just depends on your upbringing|`|vaqWxhSDaa	I'm guessing those who like it like the Christian aspect of it, how it's praise and worship to God in a music form.    Sure most of it is completely untalented, but at least people are finding some way to express themselves spiritually.|`|UMNeZ2xcaa	Flyleaf is the only "true" Christian rock band I like. And I mean a band that actually sings about God etc. I don't like them because their Christian, but because their lyrics are brilliant. Like their song Red Sam, that song is about how their lead singer Lacey saved herself from drugs after finding God, and the lyrics are powerful.     I also enjoy darker music too though like Marilyn Manson and Lacuna Coil.

YZKsAK9Jaa	When she says you are a "second" soprano, she means you are going to sing the second soprano part and you will have harmonies with the first saprano.     Sopranos can sing higher, most of the time, than other singers, so often times they get the melody because it will carry over the band. Higher pitched sound is the easiest sound to hear.      When you are a soprano you more than likely have a higher range in pitch than the rest of the choir.     The order in pitch range for parts goes:    Soprano (1st, and 2nd)  Alto (1st, and 2nd)  Tenor (1rst, and 2nd)  Bass (1st, and 2nd)    Hope that helped some. =]|`|LBlqBHaGaa	No, it is the highest voice tone. For example. Hinder sings low, right? Well a Soprano cannot go that low, so they sing in a higher tone. The middle is the second Soprano, its in between an alto and soprano.|`|8EsydFbYaa	Well, a soprano is the term for the highest female voice. I think what they were doing is separating it into 1st soprano as the highest there is, and 2nd soprano as sort of middle, but still high enough to be a soprano.     Hopefully this wasn't too confusing, and i hope i answered you're question correctly, lol. Good luck with your chorus group!

AA11278548	Some of them already have.     Ray (not sure if you count him as old cast), Greene, and Corday have all returned for episodes; Romano and Kerry had essentially cameo roles in the episode Greene was in (as you can imagine, that was a flashback episode).    Dr. David Morgenstern will be back next episode (next week) Carter is due back soon (he will be on, but I'm not sure which episode). And I've heard Doug and Carol will be returning (http://www.tv.com/er/show/111/season-15-... scroll down.  Benton also seems be appearing.|`|q82cqg3raa	During this season (15) Greene, Corday, Romano and Ray were back for an episode. Carter should be back too. In the next episode (15x14) Morgenstern will appear, and George Clooney will be back for sure, but I don't know when. I don't think Carol will go with him, though.  You can check on wikipedia - http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ER_(TV_seri... - to see which episodes featured old cast members too.
uq1GXvSdaa	only if he uses the appropriate fork and knife   otherwise he is just rude|`|Cdkd4oQ7aa	I don't think so. Progression implies moving forward, and forward implies good, and our society has deemed eating fellow humans bad. Whether using a fork or using barbecue sauce or what, it's not progression. It's just not as messy. The fork, not the BBQ sauce. The BBQ would probably me more messy.     Progression would be not eating women and children, or eating only bad people.|`|y7gAhnynaa	whats progression?|`|2a74609b12ea60e5a0d7dff64d2e967faa	Uses a fork for what?|`|YxNWmo8Oaa	lol I guess it would be a little more civil.  Perhaps he should have a glass of red wine with his meal as well. That would be classy. :)
6ycZ1LO5aa	Sum guy from the park is Leah's dad not Ste.   Zak never said he had a sister just brothers which is why her turning up was such a shock to some.   Cos he starting to change and is trying to get his life back on track bless him. She gives him a chance next week.   Yeah justin fancies hannah i reckon. Justin saw Matt (MTV guy) kissing another gal n then there was a fite cos justin was protecting hannah n now matts gone.
yvQDffhbaa	i agree|`|4UeOIGuhaa	well, it was sorta, in my point of view, though I was only maybe four back then, I'd say that they had a lot of respect for him, but now these days, rap music isn't so good and people are looking up to jokes like Lil Wayne, and saying hes better then Tupac which hes not.     Do you get what I'm saying? I'd say no because this generation is into this sick Lil Wayne crap, I am glad to say that even though I am part of this generation, I'd say I love 90s rap more ( ;

JCdudGx7aa	A guitar is a concert pitch instrument, like a piano or flute.  So, your transposition is going to be very similar to when you transpose between flute and clarinet.    A guitar's frets are each one half step apart.  The top (highest pitched) string is typically tuned to E concert (the Clarinet's F ), as well as the bottom (lowest pitched) string.  From bottom to top the pitches on open strings are: E-A-D-G-B-E.  Now, since you know what the open string pitches are, you should be able to determine what pitch the TAB is trying to tell you.  So, if it tells you "A------4----", it will be a D concert pitch, so an E on the clarinet.    Hope this helps you.|`|e25471cbc4a3c30820cfb77444f3b395aa	Yes they are    The standard tuning for guitar is EADGBE    e  ----------------------------------- (Thinnest String)  b  -----------------------------------  G  -----------------------------------  D  -----------------------------------  A  -----------------------------------  E  ----------------------------------- (Fattest String)    Hope i kinda helped lol

4uKbpwVtaa	omg! i totally agree!! i got an A- on my report card and they yelled at me and grounded me!! they let me go out with friends like once a month. they just started letting me go to the mall like 2 years ago (now i'm 16) they think i'm a failure when i'm an A- and A student! when i get a B they think it's a failure. even when i do good like i get a 96, they think i'm supposed to do that. they don't even say good job. they think that's what i'm supposed to do and that i'm supposed to get A+'s every friggin day!! even when i get a 97 they're like you should have gotten a 100! why didn't you get a 100? when i got a 77 on a midterm i almost cried because i knew my parents were going to be royally pissed. :p in conclusion: ASIAN PARENT'S ARE FULL OF BS SOMETIME AND ARE VERY EASY IRRITATED AND UNREASONABLE!! and they have the corniest beleifs like it you don't eat vegetables, you'll get a lot of acne. come on seriously :p i hate how they stress too much about grades. they're the ones who made me paranoid about getting report cards! GRADES ARE NOT MY WHOLE LIFE!! MY LIFE DOESN'T REVOLVE AROUND SCHOOL! WHEN ARE YOU GOING TO SEE THAT?! they have to moniter my social life too. they don't even let me sleepover and i have to be back home at 10 o'clock  everyday :p and i can only go out when i'm on a school vacation :p it's so annoying and they force me to play the piano even when i don't want to. and they want and think that i should be perfect and have no flaws and be the most perfect student there ever was and it gives me so much stress. they think violence is the answer to issues that involve not behaving or grades. when i was little like 9-12 years old, they used to whip me with a bamboo stick if i got a B+ on my report card!! so not fair!! american families are so much less stressful.|`|92iuiuZKaa	no of course not all are like that. it just depends on the people|`|AA10819018	YES,that's a good thing.|`|8nm2psyKaa	clearly this question is not for me cuz my parents aren't asian and I this sounds like a joke to me anyway|`|ZYrQXiwBaa	Nah, not all asian parents are like that.

They said it was okay though and told me to try harder.  -True.  -When I was little, yes. But just spankings and an occasional arm slap.  -Eh, that's not true.    Overall, they are strict.    EDIT: To xostopdajacobhatexo68    Gah, so true! For some reason, asian parents force their children to play piano, what's wrong with other instruments? (I play the violin too though.)

9KklyOcbaa	I am a Gemini, too. Sometimes I will text someone, and they will not text back for awhile. I get annoyed; I keep looking at my phone and, eventually, have to put it away so I don't drive myself crazy lol. I have trouble slowing down sometimes, so I think it's our natural tendency. We have so much going on that when we want something (even if it's from someone else), we want it at that moment so we can move on. I definitely have to work on my patience, as well. I think that's one of the good things about us, though. Even though everyone has faults, we try to work on yours and be understanding of other people's :).|`|872fcc76954a83920779a9df510b118baa	Hey I'm a Gemini, and I am the same way.

My friends would usually go...SLOW DOWN or something along those lines...Pretty odd right?I thought it was pretty easy to keep up in conversations...    Anyways,I solved this problem already.Now I'm much more patient with people...They do get on my nerves if they act like they're slow though.|`|LtF3VCE6aa	No... I have that problem too...  I have a project due tomorrow and my group mates started at the last minute when I was finished my part way long before theirs. I've kept on reminding them at school and on msn and they still haven't started since 2 days ago and we had about 10 days to do it... so it was somewhat rushed... I was patient... but they didn't appreciate it :(|`|1e214dda0bb6a3cf454196f01665db75aa	im a gemini and im the same way.........|`|S2uAq7i4aa	Same here,folk ;D  Leo sun  Sagittarius moon|`|WIczM4URaa	gemini is above average in intelligence and good communicator at that so gemini tend to be impatient with relatively slower thinking and moving people. what gemini need to understand is there are reasons for people being like that, such as:    1. being careful  2. not sold to your ideas - whats in it for them, you certainly know you will gain from it, how about others  3. not trusting you.  4. don't want to be bossed around or be your your maid in waiting  5. busy with their own lives, no time to waste to just please you  etc.    nothings wrong with you as long as you don't trouble other people.|`|3QpAqd1xaa	no, its ur nature, u just need to work with it...its ur learning lesson in life

Iswn8gXiaa	the squence where everything is put together and just befor the end action|`|O9HLoDj9aa	Definitely the ending scene. That's my favorite part. Maybe the part where he says they were monstrous, and in turn created a monster.|`|fDQ163B5aa	You should really show the last scenes of V for Vendetta. The ending shows exactly what the whole plan was perfectly. Especially, what Natalie Portman says towards the end.  http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hBM7B3NwB...|`|FoRMBlrXaa	you should definitely show them the scene where all the citizens are wearing the guy fawkes masks and then they walked through the army barricade, and they couldn't do anything about it.. that scene gave me goosebumps!|`|SKFIjyoVaa	at least show the monologue in the beginning and he says all those words that start with the letter "V" it's awesome, don't forget the symphony in which he blows up the old bailey, that's awesome too, now that i mention it, how's about adding the part where he squares off with the battle with tweedy?|`|RJZQsBqbaa	You should show the part when he takes over the radio station - then you can talk about the idea of the government having control of that tv station so everyone sees it and you can talk about the spin of the media telling everyone he is dead.  Other than that - maybe the ending with the blowing up of the building and the mass participation by the people.  I think you should definitely go with that first one though.
CtL4oAZtaa	Ronnie|`|9z9BW10daa	Oh my god.    RONNIE RADKE.     He was the band, guys.  I'm not saying no one else helped, but you can't expect to have the same band when your frontman leaves.  (And what a d*mn good frontman he was..)    I hate Craig's voice.  It's really whiny and girly and too..emo pop-ish.  He literally turned ETF from alt. rock straight to bubblegum pop, I swear.    Ronnie's voice, however, is completely unique; I've never heard another like it.  It's raspy and emotional (emotional, NOT "emo") and way more hardcore than effing Craig.      I love Ronnie and am on his side.  Forever.    (I'm finished with my little rant now..hahaha)|`|I0JBGllLaa	ronnie.  i dont like them anymore though.  everybody at my school seems to like them now.|`|LnwzW5h5aa	Ronie  idk if its the new guy or the new album, i just didnt like it nearly as much (the flood was pretty good tho)|`|jv0BDTNMaa	Craig was good in Bless The Fall.

B0avgIpRaa	In the finished script, Wonka's dialogue is peppered with literary quotations and allusions not found in Dahl's book. They were all introduced by David Seltzer as part of his rewrite of Dahl's screenplay.    [On a bicycle in the Inventing Room]  WONKA (singing):    In springtime, the only pretty ring time  Birds sing, hey ding  A-ding, a-ding  Sweet lovers love the spring--        from As You Like It, Act V, Scene 3  by William Shakespeare [1564-1616]    SONG  It was a lover and his lass,  With a hey, and a ho, and a hey nonino,  That o'er the green cornfield did pass,  In the springtime, the only pretty ring time,  When birds do sing, hey ding a ding, ding;  Sweet lovers love the spring.    [Here Shakespeare is quoting the popular Celtic ballad, "It was a lover and his lass"]  http://home.att.net/~tom.brodhead/wonka....|`|Z8lCw8Maaa	Okay, think this is the one...    http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=guLweHSnK...

rNxK7cY8aa	Episode 109 is the end of the bounto arc (I would skip this if I were you. I hated the bounto, it was almost worse than Naruto for a while... you won't miss any important plot updates either. This is pure filler.) and 110 is where the actual story line picks up again. The next fillers start around ep 168 and ends around 189 if you were wondering. There are also a few fillers in between 127-135, but they were pretty good, so I would watch them.|`|e8o2eP6Zaa	Episode 64-109.|`|szJSaZspaa	around episode 100
js58iOmAaa	well if trevor got eliminated, each one would pick one. Because rebekkah liked one twin and scottie liked the other one, so it worked out evenly.    But in the previews it says only one girl will find love. This is because both trevor and rebekkah BOTH like either rikki or vikki, OR, one of the twins loves neither. But it is a sure fact that only one twin will find love, because of either of the two reasons listed above. It was originally planned for both of them to find love, but i guess either both contestants like one or one of the twins likes neither.
ZKVlF2pKaa	Because the idea behind the show is to sign someone to a CD and concert tour deal.

The movie would probably cover 2 1/2 to 3 hours long because it would cover drama in the classroom, athletics, and also drama between the students, faculty, and parents of the students with the school system.    The school would be very corrupt...with teachers and coaches. Obviously, the film would focus on a few characters but my main focus would be on the school itself.  There won't be a single focus on a few characters, but on school drama as a whole.    "The School of Hard Knocks" would be the title.    Actually, I would like to create a series about this story, but I'm sure I could make it into a movie as well.    For the poster art, I would use a picture of a dirt or gravel road that has tall trees on each side.

They tend to be philosophical as well as very active and they also like to have freedom. They like to roam about with a vast variety of friends and family, plus they very well can be news junkies. They like adventure and learning, just like their mascot, the centaur. They aim high, and if they hit low, they tend to move on with either disappointment or just freely forget and move on all together. No matter what though, their hopes will always be high. The world is their playground, and they're not afraid to gallop all over it. They love to travel, learn, teach, debate, and burn off energy in any physical way possible. Depending on any planets that influence their birth chart, they can vary from this description.

aN7lmNmoaa	Try holding the seventh fret on the A string. It's an octave higher and if your A string is in tune you can use it to tune your E string. Also, you know that if you hear "beats" then it is out of tune and you need to move the tuning peg until you don't hear beats anymore|`|VrKkANEaaa	It just takes sometime to learn by ear    go buy a tuner at the music store and keep tuning your E string over and over again...    It will take time, but you will develop a good ear for it eventually

Ricky also told Adrien, why his father went to jail. At the end of the episode Ricky's father gets sent back to jail because Jack caught him buying drugs.    Amy went to the doctor but decide not to know the sex of the baby. She is really considering putting it up for adoption. Her boyfriend wanted to go with her to the doctor and film the visit and he was sad when Amy did not allow him to go. Amy's little sister got a job at a bar, but her father found out and made her quit.    Ricky breaks up with Grace telling her that he doesn't not love her, he's not even sure if he loves himself and he wants to stay away from her for awhile so that his father won't bother her.      I think that just about covers it!
