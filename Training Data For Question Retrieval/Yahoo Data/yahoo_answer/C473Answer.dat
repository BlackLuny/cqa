Bye bye!!!!!!!|`|IHFaVzNgaa	No hay ninguna diferencia.|`|yRsMuf6iaa	En el caso del alcohol etlico cuando no est purificado, tiene restos de metanol que es sumamente txico, este alcohol suele llamarse "desnaturalizado" o alcohol de quemar y generalmente viene te?ido de azul para evitar confusiones y que alguien no avisado lo beba por descuido.  El alcohol de curaciones en cambio est libre de metanol, es incoloro y suele llamarse tambin "alcohol fino", se puede utilizar para la preparacin de licores por ejemplo, de ah que aclare que es potable. |`|2wDJmluOaa	bueno, eso de alcohol fino no lo haba escuchado, supongo que se refiere al alcohol etlico o etanol que es el ms comn pero en un estado puro, como cuando se utiliza para fines mdicos o para bebidas alcohlicas   el mismo etanol en un grado diferente de pureza (por ejemplo grado industrial) se utiliza en otro tipo de aplicaciones  como tal la formula qumica es la misma y las propiedades tambin, pero la pureza (algunos contaminantes que puede tener) es lo que determina el uso|`|70b84f4ac1c9b5399442d194223922ddaa	El alcohol fino es alcohol etilico y sirve para consumo humano.-

hwVYB84Haa	As long as the pilot stays on the thermocouple is fine.  Sounds like your gas valve may be stuck. A slight tap on valve may open it up as long as you have the heat knob in proper position ON and if it does open up you may need to replace the valve as the tap is not a fix just helps define problem area. Even if it doesn't open you may still have a valve problem it is just sometimes it will loosen up.|`|yZOEOutSaa	could be a defective control valve/thermostat.

If so, the thermocouple is bad. The thermocouple is the tube shaped device that detects heat from the pilot. If it isn't working, it will not allow the gas to go to the burner. Replacements can be bought at hardware stores.|`|SOillLIPaa	make sure your thermostat is turned to the proper setting you want and the gas valve is turned in correct position you may have to move it around to get it to work if not it sounds like you need a new gas valve there pretty high so id check these things first then price a gas valve verses a new water heater the pilot would not stay lite if the thermocouple was bad|`|9KDvmfT2aa	make sure gas is on if not take a tooth pick and put it in the gas hole just needs cleaned out you know you have to hold it down for one min after it lights need more help let me know

J2ONOnhyaa	It depends on where you start from and if you dig straight or start veering off, especially when you hit the molten layers below the earth's crust.     If you actually LIVE in China, then the answer is certainly yes, and you do not have to dig far. In fact, you could just SIT in your sandbox and thwap the sand and you will have hit China.

4be53bee43d92cb66f2928030bec3a17aa	Citrus trees all require a very warm location.  They must be protected from frost.  Freezing is out!!  The ideal place would be up against a fence or wall in a south facing location with full sun everyday.  They like soil that drains quickly.  Hurricanes would tear the leaves (which produce food for the trees) and the limbs.  Not good.    Good Luck!|`|d53e92d63f6955ee2ff74bca813aa7ccaa	get new trees|`|ZGQO4ZVPaa	Citrus trees need lots of water.  They also need lots of fertilizer. They are specially formulated fertilizers for citrus trees. Have you tried one of those? If you can't get one, try Miracid. Citrus are acid loving plants.   If there is anything covering the surface roots, remove them. They do NOT like having their surface roots covered.  Lastly, hand pollinate. Get a small brush for each tree and swirl the tip of the brush in all the flowers on that tree. Be sure to mark which brush is for which tree, so you don't do some bizarre cross-pollination.     good luck!|`|xggEf2ePaa	proper pruning is the key.    http://www.ces.ncsu.edu/depts/hort/hil/a...    and keep them composted out to the drip line.  good luck|`|575cb6b1cf5b6852adb2d2d72dec74dcaa	Could your trees have suffered from root rot from having too much water during that hurricane season?

VFmmVHGVaa	TRY Murphys oil soap its made to clean wood  t|`|FXnHE7mmaa	Murphy's Oil Soap is the best thing for your hardwood flooring..check out the finish on your floors. If it is not finished in a high gloss then it will not be shiny when cleaned. Mine have a hand rubbed finish, so they are more of a matte look. If they are not coming up as nice, then wipe them down with damp rag, as they might just need rinsing. If you have used something on them that is not made for finished wood flooring, you might have ruined part of the finish dulling it.|`|67cd984a406a1a2b67d49f1d11df28ceaa	My first suggestion would be using Murphy's Oil diluted in water. If it still does not shine.....try Orange Glo, it works very well and smells great! Good Luck!!|`|IqlvboR5aa	We have hardwood floors in our house, too. I started out using the Murphy's Oil Soap, but they were still dull looking. I went to store where we got the flooring from and they told me you should NEVER wet mop wood flooring. I switched to a Swiffer wet jet and it worked really great. Also, THE BEST thing you can do is rent a buffer from a local hardware store.
6EI7proPaa	If you can watch what happens when the unit is called to produce heat you can watch the ignitor under the gas tubes it should glow red and light the gas when it comes.  IF you never get a flame you may have a bad ingintor. If  the gas from the tube lights and after a few seconds goes out you may have a bad flame sensor.  The ignitor you will have to replace.

It was a steel back plate that needed no electricity to operate.  It forced us to open the doors and windows in the house when the outside temp was close to 0 F  and the inside was about 90 F.

Po2UqfvWaa	sure, i always believed in starting with learning how to clean your room. but since you're looking at doing the house, start with just one room at a time or it becomes overwhelming.  1. kitchen- dishes, wash, dry and put away. throw away any garbage sitting around. clean your table and wash it down. clear off all the junk on the kitchen counters. wash them down. get in the refriderater. throw away all the crap and wash it down. this means removing the drawers. start sweeping the kitchen floor. then scrub the floor. next, look around the kitchen and see if you have any walls that have dirt on them or the garbage cans.  2. bathroom- sink, tub all the toilet, sweep, scrub floor, put up clean hand towel. look around for dirt and scum. get rid of any clutter.  3. time for a reward- find a nice candle and light it in the kitchen. it's your reward for seeing things done.  4. livingroom- start with getting all the junk thrown away, or put away. things you don't know what to do with, stick in a bag for your dad to go through. dust, vaccuum or scrub floor. look in corners for cobwebs and dust. straighten furniture, clean under furniture and between the cushions.  5. reward time again- another candle  6. if you have stairs, vaccuum  7. dust rest of house  8. your room- remove all the garbage, pack away or give away all things you no longer use. if able move your funiture and clean under it. dust, vaccuum. rearrange your room if you want. reward with another candle.  some of the things are done once a week, like the bathroom  others every day. if you keep up on it, it won't be so overwhelming. you'll look and start to take care of it right away. i know these days housework is shared. however, if you have just yourself, or chose to stay home and take care of a house, this is good to know. when kids start to come into the picture, start them off learning to clean their rooms and keep them clean. start early. when they get older, they can do other things in the house.|`|Q8wDjvZ1aa	I moved away from home at 18 after doing very few chores at home.  one secret i have learned is that windex (with amonia) will clean pretty much everything, and make it shine!    just go through each room and pick up the clutter.  i like to start one side of the room to the other.  it helps to just get it done. tough through it. and then it's over and time for a BIG reward.  good luck.  it will get easier over time... next we're on to learning how to cook proper meals (i'm still learning that one)|`|5b65f879f0c7128f9d7069f75d66aedcaa	first of all, a 2009 housewife needs to know how to delegate and SHARE the responsibility with ALL MEMBERS of the household.    My husband cooks every meal every day while working 40 hour job.  I do all the laundry and clean.  My kids 5 and 3 know how to pick up their own toys.    There is light cleaning (stuff you do everyday) and house cleaning (weekly stuff) and spring cleaning (once a year).    To help with the clothes put a hamper in each bedroom or bathroom.  Then in the laundry room go to Walmart and get a 3 or 4 hamper organizer.  Bring the clothes to the laundry room and sort    whites (warm or hot)  darks (cold)  lights (cold or warm)  and REDS (cold water).      When a bag gets full, wash a full load.      I like to have a pail full of basics like windex, pledge, chlorox bathroom cleaner and simple green on each floor along with a roll or two or paper towels and rubber gloves.    Clean top to bottom.  pick up  dust  vacuum    Bathroom  mirror  sink  shower  floor   toilet    start with laundry and bathroom cleaning for now. Share the responsibility with your father.|`|AA11392159	Girl, don't worry! I have never been very good at keeping the house clean either... But here are some tips that might help...     1.) Invest in 2 3-part clothes hampers.     One will be kept in your bedroom for dirty clothes. Don't throw your clothes on the floor anymore. You will use the 3 sections as follows-   Section One: dark clothes (dark blue/black/brown jeans/pants, dark colored shirts, underwear, socks, etc.)  Section Two: light clothes (light colored pants, light colored shirts, etc.)  Section Three: Whites (Anything white, beige or creme colored)  When a section gets full, take it out of the hamper and straight to the washing machine. Put the clothing in, put in the soap and immediately start the washer. (If you don't know what water temperature to use or how much soap, ask Dad... He will probably be more than happy to help you.) When the clothes are done washing, put them directly in the dryer and start it.    The other hamper will go in the laundry room for clean clothes from the washer. Use the 3 sections as follows:  Section One: Tops- Shirts, Sweatshirts, Jackets, etc.  Section Two: Bottoms- Pants, Skirts, Shorts, Etc.  Section Three: Underwear- Bras, Panties, undershirts, etc.  As you take things out of the dryer when the clothes are dry, immediately sort into these sections. Then, you can either take the clothing out of each section and fold them and put them away in drawers, or you can leave them in the clean clothes hamper. There is nothing wrong with that. Just make sure that you are aware of when you are running low on clothing, so you can empty another load into the washer.    That will greatly reduce the messiness of any area. As far as other junk or garbage goes- follow this rule "A place for everything and everything in its place." Garbage has a place- in the garbage can or a garbage bag. Make places for other things- target usually has some inexpensive, cute baskets and boxes. Group similar items together in baskets and boxes. Hang up purses and belts on a hanger in the closet.     These are just some ideas for the bedroom and areas like that. If you want more ideas, you are welcome to e-mail me and I can give you more advice.
Vyz5YnZqaa	Remove the hinge pins and it should open right up.|`|jSBtdhf0aa	wayne f has it right i have done this.|`|rqyWr1unaa	what? do you have a computer inside your closet?  or you are on line using the phone?  call one of your friends or use any metal hanger to remove the pins of the hinges or to push the one part from the lock the one that goes inside the other door or the wall  good lock!!!!|`|tZXHSxkQaa	Where is the spare key?You get 2 keys with the lock set.Which way does the door close?If it is a door knob,do what Wayne said for an inside door(door opens into closet),for a door that opens into bedroom,you can remove the pins,this may not work because the door can hit the jam if not angled on hinge side.Get a thick wire hanger,cut it down to 4.5" long,bend it at 2" twice(should have a half inch bend from opposite end),use the half inch part to push lock open(the bolt has a beveled portion,the end goes here) .|`|56c78634dd46d41ad64b164d1216f95baa	You have a key lock on your closet door?  Who does that? If you have a regular type door knob there is usually a small hole where a key lock would be that you can insert a small flat tipped(1/8") screw driver and give it a turn. Other than tearing the door off, you might want to have someone mail you the key you left at where you were visiting.|`|yQ6hRYdFaa	Should be able to open door with thin blade knife,or break off door knob and go in with screw driver and then replace with a new door knob. And is cheaper then a locksmith.|`|AA11185954	If it's a deadbolt, I don't know.  If it's a knob lock with a real key, find somebody who knows how to shimmy it with a plastic card (or someone who knows how to pick locks.)    If the hinges are on the outside of the door, take the pins out like the first said.|`|DFmWVb63aa	The easiest and cheapest way to get into your closet is to remove the wood stop on the lock side of the door jamb. if you look at your bedroom door you will notice when you close it that it bumps up against three wood stops. These stops are typically nailed or stapled to the door jamb. So it you pry the stop off the jamb on the lock side you will then be able to take a butter knife and put it in between the door lock bolt and open the door and after wards just re nail the stop to the jamb. So best of luck and i hope you had a great vacation.

943ad7d1a8aed2bd9d670c9644993c66aa	Nothing will take enamel out of fabric, but you should know that you damaged it.    Nail Polish Remover/Acetone: will bleach the fibers & weaken them.  You'll see this once the item is washed.    The best thing to do was to blot it as much as you could have and hoped that it would fade with multiple washings, but I believe you may have made it worse by using nail polish remover on fabric.|`|JpiGhUmAaa	fess up & ask sis where u can get a new one... igh!

Plus there might be more coming in. You need to find the hole and fix it once you get the dead bodies out! Very gross. Hope I could help.|`|wuuUzZcUaa	Sounds like it could be wood rats that have climbed up in the attic.

Vyz5YnZqaa	You can take the battery out like others said and dry it over night but most likely it's trash, and if you bring it to the store and act like you don't know what happened the first thing they will do is remove the battery and look at the dot inside, if it's never been wet it will be white but once it gets wet it changes color so they can tell.|`|mD4Xn3jNaa	you can't microwave it! that will cause your microwave to start sparking and cause a fire! you cannot put ANYTHING METAL inside your microwave!    just wait and take it to a company store. or try leaving it out to dry some more|`|aMlWMkO5aa	Try drying it overnight if that doesn't do it you might have to get a new one.|`|n269QffFaa	get a new 1|`|rqyWr1unaa	Remove the battery and use the hair dryer don't turn it on until next day  after that if don't work go to the store and tell them that your phone is not working anymore (you don't know why)   goo luck!!!!!|`|QNGzjvRKaa	Most likely your phone is now trash.

HBM1qu0Saa	Bleach is the only thing that will killl mold. But the odor is very strong, so use it carefully. This is what they use in the boating industry.    Beg, borrow, or whatever to get a dehumidifier to dry the air in your room. Leave your windows open to get air flow as much as possible.    Mold, to the extent you have it in your room is very unhealthy.  Go here to see a few, http://healthandenergy.com/mold.htm    It is too bad your mother will not contact the landlord. That is exactly what should be done.  Go here to read your rights as a tenant.  http://www.rentlaw.com/mold/moldbasics.h...|`|GTja6ouWaa	rip out your room and completely redo and clean it mold is extremely unhealthy and u could die if you breathe it in.|`|AA12180549	First off, make sure you are wearing rubber gloves to clean this stuff up with.  Never mix cleaning agents or chemicals, the result can be dangerous or deadly.  So watch where you are cleaning and with what.    Secondly, to address small, isolated stains, mix 1 tablespoon salt, 1 tablespoon white vinegar and a few drops of pine sol.  Apply with a clean rag directly to the spot, and work in a circular rubbing motion to dislodge the mold and mildew. The abrasive salt and anti-fungal properties of the vinegar and pine sol will help alleviate the stain and prevent further growth. Following removal, rinse well with water and dry.  Blot it with a dry towel, if you feel the need step on the towel, you can use a hair dryer just keep the dryer set on medium and at least 10 inches from the carpet.      Thirdly, for your dresser use laundry soap and water, preferably one with a bleach alternative in it.  Just a little,(couple table spoons), of the soap to a bowl full of water should work.  Use a bowl of clean water and a clean rag to rinse.  Make sure you squeeze most of the water out of the rag.  Then dry with a clean dry rag. If it is a wood dresser, you may want to wait a day to let it completely dry out and then use a bit of furniture oil on it to recondition it.    And last, make sure you inspect your room for any more areas.  1/4 cup of bleach in a gallon bucket works wonders on your walls.  Again make sure you are wearing rubber gloves.
4vhTUtVfaa	use them both  one for the big part and one for the trim :]|`|FXnHE7mmaa	You can put one on one side and the other on the other side for a reversible look..or..you can divide your pillow case in thirds and put a stripe of one material down the middle, or make it look like an envelope using the two colours..lots of different things you can do to use them both!
vSiulYddaa	theres alot of patterns in paneling availble- some still have that old look but some are more modern looking- but the more modern looking patterns come with quiete a price tag of about 20-30$ per 4' panel, especially for descent quality that isnt going to warp or just look industrial or goudy.   It really depends on how much you want to spend and how fussy about patterns you are, if you dont find anything at your local big home improvement store - try a smaller lumber yard or builder- they can often special order many more patterns.   But in my opinion - unless your going to buy the old looking cheap and thin panels just for a quick fix - then you are better off putting the time into scraping down all that wallpaper. it will save ya money but besides that it will be much easier to remodel or refresh with a coat of paint in the future.
omegLbOAaa	play around with the Sherwin Williams color visualizer to help you imagine how the colors will look together. It is the best paint visualizer on the web, imho.

You can literally spend hours:  http://www.sherwin.com/visualizer/    I think "solaria" (  6688) might be a good choice.    You can take a photo of your house & upload it to the makeover gallery on this website:  http://www.roomvues.com/  You can get color suggestions & for $5 they'll photoshop them onto your room so that you can get an idea of what it will look like.|`|9WxIYtEfaa	Maybe like a chocolate brown color - like soft rabbit brown by Valspar (view it at valspar.com).

wuuUzZcUaa	If your considering bamboo for the outdoors choose your verity wisely bamboo is very invasive and has long stretching lateral root system. If your using bamboo as a indoor plant you could put a layer of 3 to 4 inch stones above the soil, as long as the stones couldn't be swallowed, maybe 8 to 10 inch might be better. That would take care of the soil problem.|`|ZdIaVkIcaa	Unless the baby splinters the bamboo and eats it, it wont hurt any.  And I look forward to your question in 10 or 15 years when you ask how to get rid of bamboo overtaking your yard, you see, it's quite prolific.|`|Ar80Ri8eaa	They aren't going to harm your baby, just watch him to make sure he doesn't eat dirt or anything, and keep him away from the plant if he shows it a lot of attention, he could play with it and break off pieces and choke.
mP0LLMVjaa	Sometimes people put the paneling up to cover up imperfections on what's behind it. It could be glued and nailed to the walls. What ever is behind it might need to be replaced and yes you can put up new sheetrock but it will be a messy time-consuming project.  You could clean the paneling with TSP and prime and paint it.  http://www.ehow.com/how_17524_paint-wood...  You can either fill in the grooves or leave them and it will look like beadboard.|`|AA11027952	It will all depend on how the paneling was put up(paneling nails, glue, or both) and what is under there after you do get it off(if any damage was done to the under wall by removing the paneling.)  Age of the house may also determine what's under the paneling.  Good luck it's hard work, but will be worth it if you really love the house.

AA11285538	The fabric was too sleazy (look that word up) to contain the low-grade batting.  Wash your sheets and tumble dry them with a fabric softener sheet to cut static .  In the future, don't buy super cheap Wallmart crap.  It's no bargain, as you can see.  Also, check the label on that POS .

Quartzite looks just as good, but since it's synthetic, people just don't value it as much.  It's significantly much more cost-effective, too.    Personally, I like the look of slate or soapstone but it's not as popular as granite and if you plan on selling your home in less than 5 years, granite is the way to go.    If you plan on living in your home for a while, if you can find a good concrete contractor, they're doing amazing things with it these days.|`|4eb0e2f9d5b148fde3255d87f69f396daa	I suppose it depends on personal taste.  I looked at both surfaces and decided on granite - mainly for cost.  The supplier is here in town and they do everything.  I liked the quartz, it's supposed to never need polishing but Home Depot & Lowe's were high compared to what I would give for the granite.

Some gardens invite quiet contemplation, but may have also been intended for recreation, the display of rare plant specimens, or the exhibition of unusual rocks."  Japanese gardens often contain several of these elements to provide a beautiful & peaceful spot for contemplation:  Water, real or symbolic. Use pebbles spread out to look like a flowing river or stream.   Rocks.   A lantern, typically of stone.   A teahouse or pavilion.   A enclosure device such as a hedge, fence, or wall of traditional character.   A bridge to the island, or stepping stones.   http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japanese_ga...

Maybe you can use this for a model, perhaps using some non-edible materials instead. "Like the tea houses it was modeled on, its beauty lies in the simplicity."  http://prometheus.med.utah.edu/~bwjones/...    Here are samples of some Japanese elements that you might use in your Japanese Garden model. The flow of water is represented here by white sand (sugar was used for the model in the previous site). A rock represents a mountain.  Smaller stones can be laid out to represent stepping stones leading to the tea house.  You could make an image of a stone lantern with modeling clay.  http://www.jnto.go.jp/eng/indepth/histor...    "Plantings in the Tea Garden are not showy, for nothing should detract from the calming aspect of the ritual of tea... everything has its purpose. Each plant, water feature, and stepping stone is chosen to make the Tea Ceremony harmonious and precise."  http://www.japanesegarden.com/gardens/te...    Good luck!!!

xlLXjb0Yaa	Concrete release, AKA form release or mold release, is an oil based agent that prevents water based concrete or cement from bonding to a surface.  It is generally sprayed on rather than rolled or brushed.  Yes, cooking oil spray works on small projects.  For something along the lines of stepping stones I'd get a product that is meant for the purpose.    In construction we use release to prevent concrete from bonding to form boards or from bonding to other concrete when casting wall panels on top of existing concrete slabs.|`|zeXMAsF7aa	its used for stamping concrete you spray it on the concrete after you float it and then you can lay your stamps down and press them in and pull them back off without the concrete sticking to the stamp.|`|wKQbNvm9aa	I have used Pam cooking spray for plastic stepping stone molds.  Works great.|`|fHGsk18Laa	I believe one brand is called "hammer head release".  It works well. The box I bought had six viles.    What you do is:    Drill the holes where needed about six inches deep (the size of the vile).  Place the vile inside the hole.  In my case I was using all-thread, so I took a heavy plastic block and beat my all-thread down into the hole.  The glass vile of solution breaks and the solution hardens up around whatever you are placing in the hole.    This is really cools stuff and works well.
dkoGI9nfaa	Singapore's climate allows you to grow just about any herb you choose.  Start with parsley it is so easy.  Mint is another that grows well.  You can grow them in pots as if need be you can move then in or out of the sun as required.  If you do grow mint do it in a pot as they can easily become a pest as they are prolific growers.  Coriander, basil and chives will also thrive in your climate.  Good luck.  Check the web as there are super websites.  Go for sites in your area as it will provide you with the best information for your climate.

8cfjDWraaa	Since the problem with the hot water heater came just after the service upgrade, it seems likely that it is indeed the cause. You didn't mention that the service upgrade included a new main electrical panel, but I assume that it did. If so, my first thought is that the person who re-wired the circuits into the new panel wrongly assumed that the water heater feed circuit was 120 VAC instead of 208 or 240 VAC (which most larger water heaters require) and mis-wired the circuit. It's common to use a 'Romex' cable for hot water heaters that only has black and white wires (and the bare ground, of course), and typical 120 VAC circuits use black as hot and white as neutral. Therefore, if that mis-wiring is the mistake, you would get 1/4 the power to the hot water heater and the water would never get up to the proper temperature. Look inside the electrical panel and note whether or not the hot water heater is wired with the black wire to a single pole circuit breaker and the white to the neutral bus. If so, the fix is to connect the black and white wires from the hot water heater circuit to a double pole circuit breaker so it gets the full voltage (check the nameplate voltage on the water heater before doing this, of course). When using 2 wire plus ground 'Romex' cable for a 208 or 240 volt circuit, it's a better practice to color the white wire with red electrical tape to indicate its use as hot rather than neutral.|`|jSBtdhf0aa	it sounds like one of the elements are bad.  or if you put a new hot water heater in,  check to see where you have the water temp set.if you are getting power to the heater and you must be, or you wouldnt even have warm water. i hope this helps.|`|yQ6hRYdFaa	Might be the one heat element burned out or going to be burned out due to one or both.|`|rqyWr1unaa	check the tempeture on the water heater, make sure that cover your needs.  good luck|`|AA10257357	Go to the breaker box and find the breaker for the water heater, A double pole single throw 30 amp. breaker.  Turn off the breaker and check to see if both wires coming out of the breaker are tight if not tighten and turn back on.  Next go to water heater and there are two cover panels one at the top and one at the bottom.  Remove the covers and you will see your thermostats.  On them is a red reset button, push them to reset.  Also check the temperature setting on the thermostat's they should be set to about 130 degrees, not any higher or you can receive 3rd degree burns.  If all this checks out ok then you either have one of your thermostat's bad or one of your heater elements bad.  They need to be check or replaced|`|6AWCy7uAaa	You had a black and white wire going to two thirty amp fuses at the top of your 60 amp panel giving you 220 volts to your water heater. When you changed to the 200 amp panel you probably put the black wire on a single pole breaker and the white wire on the ground bus. That gives you 120 volts to the water heater. To fix it you have to get a two pole 30 amp breaker and put the black wire under one screw and the white wire under the other screw (these are the wires coming from the heater). This will give you 220 volts to the water heater and you will have hot water again.

wKQbNvm9aa	SInce you ordered from a nursery (it sounds like) perhaps you are getting the self-fertile type of persimmon.  In that case you only need the one to get fruit.  Other wise, there are male and female and you would need several to get fruit.   The soil needs to be good neutral soil.  Well drained is great.  The grass needs to be cleared and kept cleared until the tree is 4-6 feet tall.  It won't want to compete with the field grass.  I wouldn't add fertilizer at planting time unless it is a mild root stimulator.  Keep them watered for the first couple of years.  They like full sun.  Once established they do fine in pretty poor soil.  Good luck.|`|ifXJTyAtaa	There are two types of persimmons, so I'm not sure which one you bought.  One bears soft and red fruits (like tomatoes), the other bears munchy and orange fruits (like apples).  I have the latter one.  Anyway, as far as requiring 2 plants to cross pollinate and produce fruits, I don't think so because my tree bears fruit by itself.  The acidity of the soil, for me, is pretty neutral.  To help your tree thrive and survive, do what my uncle does.  He mows tall grass and uses it to fertilize the tree and keeps the ground around the tree moist.  The tree bears lots of fruits - large fruits - depending on the nutrients and water it gets.  Lastly, give it plenty of room to spread cuz the tree is as wide as it is tall.

AA10097817	Not sure what you mean by immediately. I have a Bosch. I put my laundry in, close the door, put the soap in the dispenser, choose the cycle.

That way water isn't spraying out of an open door.|`|9d8438febeda9f081685c3c773c13d90aa	By "filling up with water" do you mean that you want to see more water than clothes ?  The purpose of a front loader is to conserve water...Your clothes will be very wet ofcourse, but you don't actually see water above the clothes..|`|AA10453678	the new front loading washers are more ecological. they use less water to wash your clothes. so it doesn't fill up, but adds enough water to get the clothes wet.|`|1W056T4Maa	I have a Whirlpool "sixth sense" one.  I'd say water doesn't get poured in straightaway, because it is checking load, how much water is needed, or checking program set.  I usually use the quick cycle with less load, because otherwise a full cycle takes more than two hours.  I didn't know this at first.  The shorter one lasts 35 minutes.  But you can only load half of full capacity of machine.  Still the same results. You will also notice, water is added in stages.  The way front loaders work, is like you banging clothes again stones.  The very same movements.  It doesn't just swirl around.  I wish I've bought a top loader, more convenient, you can add clothes even after you started washer.  Having said that, front loaders do produce better washing results.|`|fHGsk18Laa	This is because they are a "tumble washer" not an "agitater washer".    There is water flows into the drum after the door has been locked.  Yes this is the way they are supposed to work.    I had a front loader and will never have one again.    They will handle bigger loads but won't clean like a top loader.
QNGzjvRKaa	Even if no problems found, the money you spent will be worth it for the peace of mind knowing there are no problems.  Get it done and get everything in writing.

He said he had enough info and was off. When I saw the final document there was pictures of another homes interior and the info was all wrong.

Good luck|`|5f75de4cef16ee724cdcb0a718bf76a3aa	While I think you should get the house inspected, I don't know if you have to pay extra for termite inspection. My resources suggest that termites generally don't invade houses younger than ten years old because it takes that long for the nests to extend after the ground disturbance caused by construction. But this is in Zone 6. It might occur faster in warmer climes.     But, yes, get references. Not all inspectors are fastidious. Remember, he is working for you.|`|a1Ngi39Xaa	Definitely a termite inspection!   Our neighbors just bought a home a there were termites underground and got into their laundry room.  Now of course we have to treat our place so the termites don't run over here!

AA10097817	We've had three homes with basements. Each one had water problems. Never again.|`|UQWusO1waa	I think the quality of a cinder block basement would match the quality of you manufactured house. as it will never be worth what you paid for it. hope its not to late to get out of both deals. you buy or build a real house if you want a "real" investment.   to answer question. No a basement built of lego blocks would only be another bad decision beneath another. Sorry to be so rude . I just hate people sold these things thinking they are buying real houses. You should rethink this whole thing or be prepared to making payments on a house that is worth about 60% of the loan you will have after you are in it for 6 months.  just sending some good advice. some day you will remember what i have told you . take care.|`|AA11215068	There are a couple of things to consider. I would NEVER have a basement built with cinder block. I would have reinforced concrete poured and have it sealed on the OUTSIDE. Don't let anyone sell you on the idea that it can be sealed from the inside. You need to be on high ground to some degree. You don't want anything draining toward your basement walls. That being said, I wouldn't want to live in a house that didn't have a basement. I just finished remodeling ours in Kentucky.|`|QUHLiqhEaa	I would suggest getting at least 3 contractors to give you their opinion and an estimate for what you want done. Also, have them explain to you in detail what type of drainage system they will be using.  And what about their warranty?      You also might consider how common basements are in your area.  If they are very common, your homeowner's insurance may be very competitive even with a basement added!      See this page on basement foundations:  http://www.building-your-green-home.com/...    There are links there to daylight and walkout basements.  A daylight basement might be a viable alternative - it should definitely cost a lot less.      Lastly, consider a radon mitigation system to be put in while your basement is built - it's very cheap that way, and will be so worth it if you have a radon issue after your home is built.  See this page on radon gas for more info:  http://www.building-your-green-home.com/...    Hope this helps.
