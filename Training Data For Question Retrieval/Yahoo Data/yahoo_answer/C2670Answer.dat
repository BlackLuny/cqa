Cats can get salmonella they just don't show any clinical signs and don't have problems with it.|`|MI7Vo2d5aa	No they do not have salmonella.  at all.

BHkwWWIAaa	I am the official 'stubborn bridle queen' of my barn. We have a big old 16.2 hand Anglo-Arab who tosses his head up every time you get near him with a bridle - and only one thing can get him to stop and let me do it - the super trick xD<br>  <br>  Keep a hand on your horse's 'knowledge bump' (poll) - the place between their ears where the neck meets the head. Apply steady pressure as you stand at your horse's side, slightly away where he can see you. Use this hand to hold the throatlatch up and away, as well as the noseband if your bridle is long enough. Then you only have the bit to deal with. Using your other hand, squeeze the corners of your horse's mouth, pop it in, and get the crown piece over those ears ASAP, before your horse can pop the bit out xD<br>  <br>  Good luck & happy trails.|`|7b6fsMFdaa	You could try getting these things im not sure what there called, but they their like taste things that slip on the bit and they come in different flavors. You can try a local farm house for them. You could also try putting like apple juice on the bit rite before you put it in his mouth. Also try couple times a day going and trying to put the bit in his mouth rite when you almost get it in his mouth give him a treat, and he will soon get that ( if i put the bit in my mouth i get a treat) and he will start letting you put it in his mouth because he thinks hes getting a treat. Good luck!|`|psNR7hDJaa	He might have been abused in the past. Does the bit fit well? Are you using it correctly? As curbs can be very harsh if you used it incorrectly. I use a different type of bit. I forget exactly what its called but it is broken in the middle and its like a snaffle with shanks. My horse opens her mouth well to the bit(she is also the same age as your horse). You might have to use the grain trick. But they can also get nosy for treats more then. Try a tie down to keep his head down while you bridle but don't force it into his mouth. It will take some time. How was he like when you tried him out? Has he always been using the same bit(or same type).|`|FcR8G8hPaa	Horses are not "stubborn" - they are poorly trained and confused when they behave this way.<br>  <br>  You need to approach this has a training problem and break it down into small pieces like so:<br>  <br>  Get the horse used to just standing in one place. If he moves, put him back where he was. Try to get at least 15 seconds of standing still.<br>  <br>  Get the horse used to your hands near and on his head. He needs to remain still when you do this.<br>  <br>  Get the horse to put his head down on command. Say "relax" and provide a consistent and unyielding downward pressure until you feel him relax into it (to the tiniest degree). When that happens, you must slack the lead rope as much as possible. Pause and repeat, gradually requiring more downward travel as you see him responding. This will help him get used to putting his head low on command and keeping it there.<br>  <br>  Get the horse used to your hand on his head while his head is down.Drape your arm coming from his neck over his forehead after a "relax". Keep it there no matter what he does. If you remove the hand you are training him to fling his head and get rid of you. If he starts to raise his head, keep your hand in place and use the relax cue and the rope pull to get him to put his head down.<br>  <br>  Get the horse used to having the bridle near his head. Relax him and then hold up the bridle a couple of feet away. Move it back and forth. Reinforce the relax cue if he gets tense. Put the bridle on all sides of his head. Rub his face and neck with it. Hold it in the position you are going to use to put it in his mouth but don't do that. Note that the horse's visual system can make the bridle look pretty weird in some positions and he will spook the first few times. Just "relax" him.<br>  <br>  When the horse stays relaxed from all this, get him used to tolerating your fingers in the interdental space. You can do this independently and then merge it with training him to accept the bridle in front of his face. Pur your fingers in, pry the mouth open, wait for a while and don't release pressure no matter what he does until he stands quietly. Stop and repeat.<br>  <br>  You are then probably ready to have a calm and relaxed bitting experience.<br>  <br>  It may help to have some one who can manage the lead rope and the "relax" while you do the work with hand and bridle. <br>  <br>  I hope this helps. Best wishes to you and your horse.|`|EoDOyabHaa	ive had many of my horses do this...(and i do ride western) i usually tack them up (saddle, and tie down) tighten the tie down and then slide my hand over his poll to grab the bit, instead of forcing it in his mouth try letting it just sit at the edge of his lips and maybe you'll get lucky and he'll want to play with it and you can slide it in. maybe it helps =]|`|1w6Jfzq9aa	Maybe the bit hurt him the last time you rode, curbs are notoriously harsh...Is the bit warm?  They hate it when it's cold.  I would try using a bitless for a few weeks, then maybe try again.  Attempting and failing (through no fault of your own) is counter-productive.  So using a side-pull or something similar and being able to ride when you want to is better.|`|M6myqLG3aa	This could very well be a case, of being abused with it in the past. How long have you had this horse? Does he respond as well with a hack? You really have to gain trust with a horse, so grain might be the answer for the next month or so. See how he acts in the summer, as behaviors change throughout the seasons. <br>  <br>  Happy Trails, Good Luck!|`|1asKOv1saa	ok i had the same promblem what u can do is right bettew his ears squzze it will make him lower his head,have a diffrent person squzze and u put the bit in .or tied him o till he lets u put the bit in . hope this helps.|`|07c52efaf0cf0b14367ed214c9c89298aa	Maybe he needs his teeth floated. But you can also try bridling him a little differently by not holding the headstall above his head this might scare him, try only holding it near the ends of the bit.|`|0WUnsdqcaa	I ride english and ive seen that case a few times...The trick that worked for me was tickling his chin a little bit. It might help him open his mouth and you can get the bit inside.<br>  It might work it might not :P<br>  It depends on how sensitive your horse is :)<br>  good luck!|`|AA10343094	have you ridden him in a snaffle before? the bit itself may be hurting him. i would try a 4 inch shank snaffle. it's what i ride all my horses in. they respond quite nicely to it.|`|4AfRTzRmaa	what you do (my horse used to do it to) is open your horses mouth by sticking your finger behined his teeth at their gums. you have the top of the bridle in in your other hand on the other side of his head. when you open his mouth immediately stick the bit in. If this doesnt work try a hackomore.:) good luck
1a28ef0304d145d0c1edec369cd24d62aa	The bump is a reason to go back to the Vet and have it looked at.|`|0I9Fm00Naa	I have never heard of a dog having an allergic reaction to a rabies vaccination , However that's not saying it's impossible. Contact your vet and tell him what you have noticed. The aggression's with the kid's may be a sign that he is not feeling very well at the moment.But Aggression is usually a lack of adequate training.The danger is more serious for a dog that has not been vaccinated , Their chances of contracting Rabies without it are far more Threatning.|`|CkecSp4Uaa	Rabies vaccines can cause allergic reactions in some dogs and long-term there are health risks for over-vaccinating (hence the reason for developing the three-year vaccine).  But the things you are describing are not associated with rabies vaccine.  Aggression is often a sign of fear and could be brought on if he is sore, but I would worry about a behavioral issue before I would worry about vaccines bringing this behavior on.  A small lump or bump at the injection site is normal and will usually resolve on its own within a few days.  Muscle spazms are not normally caused by the rabies vaccine.|`|KxjUim7yaa	Dogs often twitch or move their legs while they sleep. The injection site should have the swelling go down in a few days. If it is a big lump have the vet check it. If he has a sore spot he may be a little aggressive, or it may be time to neuter if he isn't already.|`|9743a4b9136d6937a430cb49e25563baaa	call your vet.  It is not uncommon for there to be a little bump near where the vaccine was given.  Also they can be sore (think about how your arm feels after a vaccine).  He may be beign aggressive because he hurts.|`|28834ea3162329035a24ce080e7020edaa	It could be an allergic reaction to the shot (since you said he has a bump where the injection was). You really do need to call your vet and see what they suggest.|`|uKOYK1Lvaa	No---you should really go back to your vet.
nFcl0BOsaa	I have a 3 yr. old female Dachshund/Pom mix and a 2 yr. old male Pit. If there is anything the Pit would ever hurt the little dog over, it's a bone. So the dogs are separated when bones are handed out, and any uneaten bones are picked up when they are through.<br>  <br>  If you keep the Pit, he will naturally assume the alpha position among your dogs. Your task is to respect the pecking order. You can treat them all equally but the Alpha is fed first, petted first, let out the door first, leashed first, etc., etc.  This way you will not put the alpha dog in a position of having to "prove" his higher rank which, as you have seen, most Pits won't hesitate to do. Sometimes my smaller dog "forgets" her place in the pack and tries to push ahead when treats or affection are being handed out. In such instances, the Pit "checks" her by nudging her. But it doesn't need to go farther than that because I am not giving her a treat first anyway. <br>  <br>  I can leave toys out for my dogs, but if the Pit takes a toy away from the smaller dog, he is not scolded or expected to understand the concept of "sharing". I always leave several similar toys out, and the little dog can go find another.  But "Terriers are all about play". When the Pit takes a toy from the smaller dog, he is usually only trying to goad her into chasing him for it or playing tug-of-war. Often she will.<br>  <br>  We go for a long pack walk first thing every day to burn off energy and satisfy the dogs' instinct for migration. Most evenings we go for another walk. I do not leave my dogs outside when I am not home. Until the Pit was about 18 months old, I crated him when I had to leave the house. On workdays I am away 7-8 hours, but I go home at lunch to let the dogs out to toilet.  If you need to crate your Pit when you can't supervise, do not feel badly if you don't crate the other dogs. When I thought my Pit was mature enough to stay out of trouble alone, I started leaving him uncrated for short periods of time. Right away he did fine. Obviously it was an improvement over being crated, so he got on his best behavior.  I do not worry about them fighting when I am out. Most dog fights occur in the presence of the owner and are a result of competition for attention, food, etc.  The dogs just sleep in their comfy beds, or maybe chew on a chew toy -- but I don't leave out any chew toys that are yummy enough to fight over. <br>  <br>  If the dog is "mouthy", one thing you will want to do is bite-inhibition training. This is done by yelping a quick, high-pitched "Ow!" when he mouths you or puts his teeth on your skin. Stop whatever it is you're doing with him, turn away and go do something else, ignoring him for a few minutes. If you are consistent, he will learn to be reserved with his mouth -- even with the other dogs.<br>  <br>  Sorry this is so long. I hope my experience is helpful to you.|`|uKOYK1Lvaa	If you aren't sure about the shelter, try a breed-specific rescue. They know what they are doing with their breed--since that's all they take in :)<br>  <br>  I'm sure that the dog was fine--but I'm *not* there; none of us are, so trust your gut. Stray dogs are a tragedy, but don't put your dogs in danger.|`|n1mNIRCJaa	Pit Bulls can be dangerous animals, if you love your other dogs its best to keep them seperate.|`|GLsCVPCuaa	please dont give him a bone in front of 2 small dogs he doesnt know...of course he will become protective over his bone...wouldnt you???|`|Jkt0dXTyaa	Maybe the man got rid of him -because- he is protective?<br>  <br>    If you do intend to keep him, be extremely cautious with him around children, as they will be even less conscientious of him than other dogs.<br>  <br>     I'm sorry...I can't offer any assistance on introducing him. I, personally, wouldn't keep him in my house and endanger my other pets like that, or my family.:/ Most of the time, you have to start out training a pitbull young to make it sociable, or enroll it in a solid obedience program once it's grown.|`|8ATXyOrkaa	Don't. Call a rescue.|`|TnQEOdX0aa	My friend has several pit bulls living with a chihuahua and a cocker spaniel. They all get along fine. I don't think that it has anything to do with the type of dogs they are, it just has to do with the individual dog. Pit bulls are really very sweet and loyal. I have a pitbull and two cats. They have never had any problems with eachother.<br>  If the pitbull you have seems like he might bite, it is possible. You should introduce them to eachother slowly so that the dog can get used to your dogs.|`|bIaywrBCaa	as with any stray pit or otherwise you have to be very careful when trying to put them together until you have had time to see what their temperament is like. He may be food aggressive and the next time may go in for the kill.|`|u61yKsE3aa	You need to get to pit into training.  He needs to learn to share.  I had a pit with my doxie and we taught him that aggressive behavior was not tolerated.  Pits aim to please so when trained correctly can be a great companion.  I would enroll in a obedience class with a train that is used to working with pits and go from there.  Great job rescuing him all dogs need a loving home and sadly many go with out.

Slate tile looks very nice and it's easy to clean and distributes and holds heat very well, as was stated above. It is cheap, and you wont have to replace it unless it breaks. If you are to use the fine grain sand please only use it for ADULTS only. It can still cause impaction in young leos.|`|CtK04QcVaa	Don't use sand. Leopard geckos live on hard clay and rocks in India and Afghanistan. Sand is not natural for them and is hard to walk on not to mention the health problems of it. If you're looking for something natural use slate tiles. I have them in my gecko tank and it looks a lot better then sand does. Its very easy to clean and can be used again and again. In the long run, you save a lot of money with tile. You only buy it once and then reuse it. Sand you can't reuse. Slate tiles also hold heat very well which is good because they need heat on their stomachs to digest food.   <br>  <br>  No sand is safe. Although the bags might say it is they all risk impaction no matter what grain. Same with all other loose substrate bark, bed-a- beast, sand, and the desert blend mixes are all not safe. If they can swallow it, it riskes impaction. <br>  <br>  Be safe and responsible and get slate tile or paper towel.|`|zTeLhroWaa	They don't live on sand in the wild.  They live on hardened clay and rocks.  If you want a natural habitat you should get some unglazed slate tile from a home improvement store.  It's about as expensive as sand, they'll cut it to fit your cage, and it's easier to clean and never has to be changed.  It also distributes heat more evenly.<br>  <br>  Sand can cause impaction.  It doesn't always, but it can.  That's why most herp owners steer clear of it.  <br>  <br>  If you must use sand, you need to get the finest grain you can find.  The tinier the grain, the less likelihood of impaction.  The really small grain sand, however, is ridiculously expensive and not worth it really, in my opinion.<br>  <br>  Stick with the tile.|`|82rq2ctFaa	DO NOT LISTEN TO ANYONE THAT SAYS USE SAND LISTEN TO THE PEOPLE WHO SAYS USE unglazed slate tile I HAVE ASKED A MILLION QUESTIONS ABOUT SAND DO NOT USE IT I REPEAT DO NOT USE IT.

It's just a ritual we do. I just use regular q tips and clean them like I would clean my own. My rott/lab mix gets really nasty stuff in his ears so every two weeks I dip a q tip in peroxide and clean his ears with it. <br>  You don't need to buy anything other than q tips.<br>  It depends on how bad your  dog's ears get as to how often you should clean them. <br>  Be careful not to go too deep with the q tip. It can seriously injure the inner ear if you go too deep. <br>  The dog is going to kick or scratch at it's ears while or right after you are cleaning them. That is normal. I sometimes have to sit on the bigger dog to keep him from moving and causing the q tip to go too deep.|`|3a8d8200494dea80c8e22d328cd4879aaa	You can get ear cleaning solution at any pet store.

I'm not sure if all cleaning solutions can be used on young puppies.|`|tPGxPDvBaa	Buy a good commercial one or you can make the solution that I post below. It depends entirely on your dog & the breed. Some dogs need weekly, bi-weekly, monthly or only if dirty.  I leave ears alone unless they need cleaning.  Introducing a different object to the ears will interrupt their natural balance but some breeds/dogs need to be cleaned on a regular basis since they either don't have a good balance or conditions (humidity, playing in the dirt etc) overwhelm the balance.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://animal.discovery.com/breedselector/dogselector.do" rel="nofollow">http://animal.discovery.com/breedselecto...</a><br>  <br>  Without more info that is all  I can advise.|`|1a28ef0304d145d0c1edec369cd24d62aa	After a bath and at least once every other week I use cotton balls with rubbing alcohol on it.  Squeeze excess out and then clean inside of ears.  You want the cotton ball to be kind of "juicy".  Then remove the cotton ball and squeeze at the base of your dogs ear to spread the alcohol around.  Your dog will want to shake it's head so beware.  Then take a dry cotton ball and swab again.  The alcohol is good to use because it dries quickly.  And it's only safe to use if your dog's ears are not red or has any scratches or wounds in it....it will burn them if that's the case.  Doing this after a bath helps to remove any water from the ears also.|`|II8PSRMgaa	Id do everything like the answer before me...except i would use saline solution (contact solution) instead. No burn and its a natural cleaner.

piVngGRBaa	Haha, i'm an expert on minis- i love them and have four very adorable cuties standing in my backyard as we speak. <br>   To answer your first question- go ahead, i do it all the time! My one mini, cooper, loves to come along. He is very tiny, so i used to use a long lead, but now he follows along without one! My best advice is see how he reacts with a long lead, and pay attention to make sure its high enough so that he doesnt step on it- but minis arent too clumsy,, and actually in my experience tend to avoid stepping on the leads.<br>    Also, its okay to get on him once and a while. they are, as you probably figured out already, extremely hardy animals. but alot of people think that "Aw, look how strong he is! he can hold me easily! he ca handle me riding him every day for a little while." But really, a good way to think of it is that your on a cell phone plan that bills you every week. and every minute you spend on his back over time, the less rides, or "minutes" you will have. so just be rational about how much you get on his back. hes cute and fuzzy, but not a toy =D|`|psNR7hDJaa	If they get along REALLY well, then it should be alright. But give him lots of lead. And don't go faster than a slow trot. <br>  <br>  #2, if the horse is ok with someone on it's back. But I don't really suggest it.|`|jzKS5pxkaa	only small children can ride miniature ponies im about that size and im not allowed to ride some of the ponies because im to tall. and i dont know abotu the 1st question|`|2nsNvIanaa	my mini shetland is only 87cm tall id kick yr **** if u went 2 get on him. my mini horse is 92cm tall. same answer.if they dont kick u 1st.|`|r5XLbLpVaa	Yes Yes No Yes|`|RUzBDX6Jaa	ponying should be okay.  15.1 isnt all that tall so i see no huge problem there.<br>  Extra-long lead.. yes, in case she spooks you want some slack to gain control instead of running out to the end of the lead and accidentally letting it go and "roam free".  It's possible, but as long as it doesnt drag too far on the ground...<br>  I would stay away from that.  Just incase of back problems!<br>  My mini is that height, and we are having little children ride her (once she's weaned her baby) and we are just hoping she will be okay, because I can't hop on her and make sure she won't buck...<br>  Minis rock, hey?|`|4AfRTzRmaa	yes yes no no-because 40 inches is not event 4 ft!|`|lTeXIjpOaa	most mini horses can not hold much weight, depending which class mini horse he is depends how much weight he can hold, a class B can only hold about 35lbs; also, ponying him on the trail would depend how far you are planning on traveling, remember that their legs are much smaller it is a lot more work for them to travel great distances than a full size horse|`|S78sVWEVaa	Basically you're saying that no matter how many NO's you get, you're itching to park your oversized self on this pony's back.  <br>  <br>  Make up your mind, is the 'pony horse' 15.1 or 13.3?<br>  <br>  To the last question, NO.  Weight isn't evenly distributed according to height ratio.|`|3LXbUg1raa	General rule of thumb is that a horse can carry about 20% of their body weight...so basically your horse should weigh at least 540lbs...Not only that, but it also depends on how well he is built and how well you can ride and properly stay balanced on the horse...Personally, I wouldn't recommend it.<br>  <br>  ~If you want to know what your horse weighs, why don't you get out one of those little weight tapes and measure him...then you'll know.|`|bKwQyCEHaa	1 i guess <br>  <br>  #2 no that is way to big only small children should be ridding a miniature horse
KEYgd73saa	Flashing can be a sign of any kind of skin irritation, from parasites, bacteria, toxins in the water, small lacerations on the skin, or even just a simple itch.  If you've got nothing more to go on than flashing, don't worry too much.  When the lights are out, take a strong light and shine it on the fish.  If you find a cover of gold flecks, begin looking into marine velvet (Amyloodinium ocellatum), and start treating appropriately, promptly.

She might only eat it when she is VERY hungry. She could also be bored. Automatic water troughs can be good. Also has she had her teeth done lately? That can help prevent her not eating enough(it also can hurt).|`|piVngGRBaa	Eventually, alot of horses just get bored over time. Alot of times all you need is simple mental stimulation to keep them busy. If you have ever heard of something called "Uncle Jimmy's Hangin' Balls" or even Likits, and hang one in between fence poles where she can't push them against things will keep her trying to keep licking and eating the sweet treat instead of cribbing. <br>   and i agree with you, i think cribbing collars are somewhat cruel. they look cruel, but they dont hurt the horses. And if you think of what could happen if she continues to crib, such as colic, then you might want to consider one. it can prevent death.|`|IMPvzBk1aa	I'm posting some links for you.  the first is a poll taken for solutions people have used to prevent wood chewing, but also cribbing.

It's a lot more cruel to let your horse keep cribbing and have her wear down or chip off her teeth.

Horses that crib get an endorphin release from the act, it's addictive.<br>  <br>  There is absolutely nothing wrong with a cribbing strap.  You may find it ugly or feel somehow shamed by having a cribbing horse.  It is not cruel and is in the best interest of the horse.  Just like getting off drugs is in the best interest of the addict.<br>  <br>  Leave the collar on, it's about the horse, not you.
f5a8d99afbb73cd0703df99b87996901aa	In young kittens, cat flu can be deadly.  Pneumonia can set up if it's left untreated.  Dehydration is a serious issue as well since cats frequently stop eating and drinking when they're sick.  This kitty needs to see a vet ASAP for correct diagnosis and treatment.  Since he is a pound cat, it's a very good idea to have him tested for FIV/FeLV as these are highly contagious and the cat has been exposed to other strays.  Best wishes for a speedy recovery and thanks for rescuing!|`|ZotbP52paa	It can be very serious, like it could be ades. NOBODY wants to hear that their cat has ades, but, it could be nothing that serious. You're making a good call taking it to the vet though.|`|cj31x3UMaa	depends upon the cat's immune system & what exactly you are referring to as the "flu".<br>  <br>  Last dealing (back in the 1970s) that I had w/ anything specifically referred to as the "flu", all my adults got VERY sick & I lost some young kittens that were still nursing.<br>  <br>  we had everyone on antibiotics & vaporizers
AA10024510	Even in coastal Alaska, that animal doesn't belong.  Move south, or choose another breed.  Please.
0m6BgESXaa	Are you looking for German show lines, East German working lines, Czech lines, American show lines?<br>  <br>  Are you looking for "just a pet", or a sport dog?<br>  <br>  By the way, it's "Shepherd", not Sheperd ^_^
AA12205365	Young puppies mouth, and bite a lot.  It's not bad if it happens a little as a puppy, but it needs to stop as the dog get older.  The important thing early on is to establish limits to his biting.  (Or just don't let him bite at all.)  When it's too much tell him.  <br>  <br>    Dogs learn to play with each other by  the other dog letting out a yelp, and stopping play.  If his biting is out of line give a high yelp, and either leave or turn your back.  If he persists scold him.  If he keeps it up squirt him with a spray bottle with water, and a bit of vinegar.  Above all else don't let him make a game out of it.<br>  <br>    Also you might find a toy you and he can play with.  One he can bite as much as he wants.|`|7TKRtDanaa	way one way is to make a high pitch yelping noise when ever he bites, that is how dogs communicate to their litter mates when they are still young. Once you make that yelping sound he will stop right away and you also have to stop paying him any sort of attention dont yell at him or look at him for a few mintues, then once he is calm continue doing what ever you were doing with him. Eventually he will just barely touch you with his teeth , but trust me if you dont teach him he will not grow out of it.|`|0m6BgESXaa	"You can lightly flick their nose to get their attention."<br>  <br>  Absolutely NOT!  Ignore starpower's advice...it's terrible >.<<br>  <br>  The first poster is correct.  You should yelp like a puppy.  If that doesn't work, get up and walk away.  Say nothing to the puppy.  Completely ignore them.  You only need to do this for about a minute, and then return to playing!<br>  <br>  The puppy learns that by playing too roughly, he loses his playmate.  Since dogs are so social, having no one to play with is no fun, so they learn to pay more gently.<br>  <br>  If he tries nibbling on you, offer him something that is acceptable, like a bone, or stuffed toy :-)|`|00sn8G9paa	Whenever you catch him in the act, immediately spray him in the face with a water spray bottle and tell him NO!! They hate that and it's alot safer than whacking him. Be consistent. He'll get the message after about 20 times and yes, he'll grow out of it quicker.|`|sQOXjKFNaa	I dont know how old charlie is but I will bet he is teething. When he tries to tenderize you yell loudly. (ouch)  Let him know if he hurts you.  He should ease up!  Hang in there he should out grow the teething.|`|I1B1jq0Saa	A good thing to do when your dog bites a person is to say "No!" in a loud low voice. You can lightly flick their nose to get their attention. <br>  <br>  There is a chance of him growing out of it, but not likely.<br>  <br>  When you find him chewing something hold up the object and tell them no in a loud and low voice. <br>  <br>  You can even spray them with a spray bottle with water in it. Be very consistent with all of that. Make sure you keep special things to you out of reach.

OrvTG44laa	I'd suggest a German shepherd.  They're fun and athletic.  They are very smart, the third smartest dog in the world, actually.  They are highly trainable and can be taught amazing things.  These dogs will do a wide range of activities, like herding, hunting, police work or even competitions.  If you can commit your time and energy into this dog, you will be very happy and constantly amazed at what they can learn to do.  They also make very good protection dogs, but again, it all depends on how you train them.  <br>  Rottweilers also make great dogs, but they need a firm handler.  If you can give them the training they need, they will be great dogs.  But they can also be your worst nightmare if you don't do it right.  They are very smart and obedient.  You can train them easily.  They are very loyal dogs, and will protect you against danger.  With a rottweiler, you will never worry about intruders or burglars.  They are fun and active dogs too.  They are very loving and are good with kids.  But they are also very dominant dogs, and you need to train them out of this.  Again, the rottweiler can be a great dog, but if not well trained, they can be the complete opposite.<br>  Then there is always the very popular lab.  They are very fun dogs, and they are balls of energy.  They are very loving and loyal.  They are not typically seen as the guard dog type, but they will protect their family.  These dogs need a firm handler.  They are very energetic, and need to be taught not to jump on people.  They need to be trained not to run wildly in the house.  They can also become very protective of their families and bite people they see as threats. But with proper socialization and training, this can be avoided.  The lab can be a great family pet, but when left untrained, they will tear your house apart and knock everyone over.  <br>  The boxer is also a good choice.  They might not be considered cute, but are pretty handsome looking dogs.  They are loyal and make very good guard dogs.  They are energetic and fun to play with.  They are an obedient breed, but like most dogs, do need to be kept in order.  They can be a little too energetic, and need to be kept in line.  Again, this will require a firm handler.  <br>  So far, all the dogs above require a good trainer and strong leader.  These are all dogs that have great potential, but need a good handler to get there.  Well, what if you aren't a good dog trainer?  What if you can't keep a dog in line, and can't devote so much time to your dog?  Below, I'll list some dogs that don't need as much training.  These dogs will be lower maintenance dogs.<br>  Chihuahuas are good low maintenance dogs.  They are considered to be cute by many.  They are loving dogs, but not so bright.  These dogs are not going to learn tricks soon, if you can teach them tricks.  Because of their small size, there's no need to walk them.  A small yard is more than enough for this pint sized dog.  They can be fun to play with, but make sure you get a social one.  Some are very shy, and tend to be not so playful.  This dog will be happy just laying in your lap, but will also like to play for a little bit.  Despite their dumbness, they seem to be housebroken quickly.|`|uKW6HUSOaa	You want a new puppy because your dog couldn't give you a brand new puppy? Why don't you just love the dog you have..?<br>  <br>  Anyway, there is no cutest, most loyal, obedient, fun, and loving dog breed unless YOU treat that dog like it is.|`|b2df0927cfc00ec0b4a6f61d9c5cd6e5aa	What about your old dog? Is she like defective now or did she not make it through the surgery?

a3FAGYgVaa	Anyone who tells you that the bristlenose pleco doesn't grow big is mistaking. Those can grow to be over half a foot long. Cory cats stay much smaller, but should be kept in groups of at least 3 to be happy, though they eat on scraps of food, not algea.<br>  <br>  If you want a small algea eater, get some snails. The zebra stail looks quite nice, and so do some other varieties. Or you could always go for the Pit Bull Pleco.|`|TnQEOdX0aa	Well, I like my coridoras cats best. =]<br>  Corys stay pretty small, and don't bother the other fish at all. These can grow to about 2-4 inches. They're also pretty inexpensive to buy.<br>  Bristlenose plecos can get alot larger than corys. They can grow to about 6-7 inches. The price of these depends where you go and how large the fish is when you buy it. In my experience, they are also pretty docile and keep to themselves.|`|ZVYY7nOlaa	Bristle nose plecos are algae eaters but not cories. They grow up to about 5 inches max. You still have options to some other peaceful algae eaters. <br>  You can add a Siamese algae eater. They are good algae eaters but don't get confused. They look similar to a fish called flying fox, which isn't an algae eater. <br>  The other algae eater you can get are Otocinclus. They are very small and active algae eaters. You can keep a group of them in your tank. The downside is that very delicate and hard to keep alive when you first get them.<br>  Cories or corydoras are not algae eaters but they are bottom feeders. A school of them would make a great addition to your tank. There are many different varieties of corydoras. They are very social and love to school.|`|BMri9tITaa	Probably some otoclinus would be good for you.<br>  <br>  Otherwise, I was going to start chanting CORY CATS!  CORY CATS!  CORY CATS!  But they're meat-eaters in my experience.
bDPVRtCNaa	What size tank do you have? Tank size can often explain aggressive behavior.<br>  <br>  ~The bare minimum for two fancy goldfish is 30 gallons, the minimum for one is 20. Fancy goldfish grow 6-8 inches in length and produce a massive amount of waste. Odds are when you add the two together Toshiba is vying for dominance. Aquarium dividers are cheap and easy to install. <a href="http://www.petsmart.com/product/index.jsp?productId=2753067" rel="nofollow">http://www.petsmart.com/product/index.js...</a><br>  <br>  There is no excuse for flushing a fish.<br>  <br>  ~I use an aquarium divider.

In a small tank they are competing for everything.|`|xhSsby6Taa	make him listen to classical music and do yoga|`|XBBMyzmmaa	I agree with the previous answer, tank size is important. Fancy goldfish can get up to 12 inches long although that is not common for ones living in fish tanks.<br>  <br>  But that isn't to say Toshiba isn't just aggressive. If you really have to put them in the same tank, try a tank divider. They are clear plastic dividers that allow water flow from one side of the tank to the other, but a goldfish would not be able to get through.|`|fB6Vz7gTaa	Not really.<br>  My mom had a huge tank of fish. She got an aggressive fish that ate all the rest. So be careful that doesn't happen to you.<br>  OH AND IF ONE FISH IS NIPPING AT THE OTHER FISH, GET THE NIPPING FISH OUT ASAP BECAUSE IT WILL END UP KILLING THE OTHER ONE!!!!<br>  Be careful and good luck!
45N6tmWraa	Best not until about 8 months old, although possible much sooner, so do take care.
4c2b4b3698607bc95dd331438404d7e8aa	Yes, take her to the vet and have her spayed. There are already too many unwanted puppies around the world for backyard breeders to be adding to their number.|`|PM23RDycaa	Sure. Keep her away from any intact males until she is out of heat. Call your vet.

If she isn't two or older and passed all the health test, him also, they don't need to be bred anyway. A responsible breeder would know what they need to know to get a dog bred, you don't sound like that kind of breeder.Be a better person amd spay and neuter. Please :-)|`|qqUvoC5uaa	Of course, always happy to help. <br>  Call your vet and ask too book something called "Spay" it what all the responsible owners do, don't worry it's safe.<br>  Keep your female away from other dogs until you take her to the appointment. <br>  Then bring her home afterwards and you'll have nothing to worry about.|`|1a28ef0304d145d0c1edec369cd24d62aa	Yeah seek Veterinarian advice and care.|`|p7swtBYzaa	Leave her alone, stick to your own kind.|`|d3b6fdf2d631c2f5712339448db9e43caa	smart girl, she's got it locked up tight. get her spayed.|`|10AaMUfraa	Your question doesn't make sense.  Can't why?  The "hole" is there. If she is not excepting the male she may not be ready to breed yet.  They bleed for days before they will take a dog.  You need to share more information as to what the ***** is doing and if the dog knows what he is doing or is he just humping to over excitement.  Is he a first time breeder?  Are they young?  Is there really a reason to make pups other than thinking you will profit from it.  Most back yard inexperenced breeders don't have profit after keeping the pups 6-8 weeks old to sell.  After paying for shots and worming.  What about the breed?  Small breeds first litter can have problems leading to a very high vet bill that will eat up any profit you thought you would make.  Death is a chance you are taking with a loved pet of any breed.Let's kill these excuses too: <br>  <br>  I want them to experinece sex because I know how good it feels or how great it is to be a parent.  These are all HUMAN feelings and animals don't think that way or feel that way.  They breed to increase the size of the pack so to share the pack chores.<br>  <br>  I want my child to see life.  Trust me most of the time the ***** will have the pups late night or while the kids are at school.  Lots of new breeders have know idea that a ***** in in labor or when they start to "nest"<br>  <br>  Think hard before breeding as lots of dogs are put down  that are great dogs but just don't have someone to care for them.|`|f0f10549271cf5cb48ef2adc12f4ef13aa	sure. Fix her then you won't have that problem.<br>  <br>  I am all for puppys but unless there is a legit reason to breed I will never understand why people don't fix their dogs.<br>  <br>  If you show the dog, ok. If you work the dog, ok. If it is just that you have two of the same breed and your doing it cuz your local paper sells them for so much money, then that is adding the over population problem and very irresponsible of you.|`|b2df0927cfc00ec0b4a6f61d9c5cd6e5aa	Take her to the vet and ask for a surgery on her called Spay.

Get a siphon and leave them in the tank when you do the water change.

The stalking and attacking is part of a cat's God given instinct.  Your cat is "play hunting". What you want to do is to tell your cat no, and redirect him.<br>  Encourage him to take this energy out on a cat toy or a small stuffed animal. My 1.5 year old did this. What I found worked best was this. I took some thin elastic and made a loop on each end. I put a cup hook in above a door way and hooked one of the loops on the hook. Then I sewed a catnip toy to the other loop. He has played and beat on that toy terribly. In fact he still plays with it.  Make sure that it is just high enough that he has to jump or reach for the toy - don't make it too easy. Show him the toy and encourage him to play with it or better yet play together. It has been Simon's greatest energy release.|`|ZotbP52paa	Try spraying him with water. But, it will get better in time.

As for the smell go to your local pet store and ask what the best deodorizer is I'm sure they could help you.|`|IFiwmb3Haa	A dog that old is probably incontinent so you being a little more understanding of old age might be in order.  As dogs age they become less able to hold their business.  I suggest letting the dog out more often (every two hours) so that this problem isn't bothering you.    There are a ton of carpet cleaners out there that are useful.  I use the woolite pet stain and odor remover with OxyClean.  It does wonders.    I'm sorry that you're in such a bad situation, but try to be a little bit more understanding and help your roommate out if she needs it.  Chances are she's very attached to her dog (much like a mother and child).|`|OxFsslN8aa	There are specific shampoos for cleaning the odor out of your carpet.  Call a groomer or pet store for recommendations.      As for the dog - he probably sleeps a lot & would be just as happy on his own bed in the kitchen (which I hope is linoleum or tile) in between walks & outings.  Tell your roommate to clean the carpet & only allow the dog on the carpet right after it has been out & peed.  There are diapers for dogs because this is an issue for many pets.|`|o3ChpULLaa	At this age, there may not be much you can do training-wise.  However, I would tell your roommate to take him to the vet.  He could have a problem like kidney failure or nerve problems with his back legs.  It could also just be that he is old and incontinent.  There are doggie diapers out there.      As for the carpet:  Use an enzymatic cleaner.  I use Petzyme from Petsmart.  Also, you could get a small carpet shampooer (like a Bissel Little Green) and use the pet formula for that.      Good luck!|`|0UxjzoUxaa	The dog is old and is having problems holding its bowels. You should have your roommate discuss with their veterinarian on the best course of treatment for all you he could have a urinary tract infection. You can't blame the dog for not being able to hold it in. Its an elderly dog and why are you cleaning it up and not the owners? If anything you should confine the dog to an area of the house so you won't have accidents all over the house. You would probably have to shampoo your carpets to get the smells out. Good luck!|`|ADjeuxIiaa	It is common for older dogs (and humans!) to lose control of their bowels. The best action would be a doggy diaper. As far as the stains and odor go, there are many great solutions you can buy at nearly any pet store. Natures Miracle is a good one. Follow it up with Resolve carpet foam. That's the combo I used when house training and for the one accident that's happened since.|`|T8OFsBUUaa	Odds are with the age of the dog there isn't much you can do to stop it besides a doggie diaper.

3rc9ra35aa	There is a special type of kitty litter called 'Cat Attract". Here in Canada Petsmart sells it. It was developed by a vet and is guaranteed to work and it absolutely did for our cat who had the same problem. It has a special smell that the cat can't resisit but it doesn't smell at all to us humans. It's worth a try. Sometimes it also works to let your cat be an outdoor cat. Or if that is not an option confinement to a room with a litter box for several weeks also works. This sounds mean but it is more humane than giving the cat to a pound. Other than that cat's are pretty hard to train and stubborn.|`|0d8fd99482e78511337c03d547560306aa	Our cat used to pee in the dirty clothes.

After she is cleared by the vet, you will know that she is really spraying.    If you see her spray, she will back up to something, and kind of quiver with pleasure.  She is marking her territory.      If you got her spayed later in life, she probably already picked up the habit.  Since cats are so instinctual, it can be hard to get them to stop.  Again, talk to your vet when you take her in and get her advice.      Your vet may prescribe pills to get your cat to calm down.  That is the best way to get them to stop.|`|DPEm8HXLaa	you should take her to the vet, maybe she has a bladder infection...|`|NTEuxMVmaa	My vet gave my cat a sedative for the same problem ,it helped.

n7bok7NRaa	The allergen that cats produce is produced in their saliva. Thus if they ever wash, it gets on their fur, and as you well know, their fur gets everywhere.    What you can do to reduce the amount of allergen in the air is to keep your house very clean, use a HEPA filter vacuum, and bathe your cats at least bi-weekly (weekly is better), and keep their fur well groomed (with a grooming glove/brush).    You cannot chemically alter a cat's diet to make them stop producing this allergen - anyone who says you can is lying to you, and may be trying to sell you something that is harmful to your cat.    A positive thing to look forward to is if you have not spayed/neutered your cat, is they produce less of the protein in question after that procedure has been done.|`|iDxoM3X8aa	my two cats have been on science plan for 7years they are in great health and do not have dandruff you should try that.
nc4SbvfRaa	Whenever considering a new dog start with the AKC or other nation kennel club. They have links to the various national and state breed clubs and rescue organizations. They work together to police their own ranks and help keep you contact reliable breeders and rescue people. Be prepared to travel or be patient. Local animals from reliable sources are not always available. I would never, ever consider any other "puppy search engines" found on the internet. In my experience most of them are backyard breeders at best and puppy mills at worst. I always visit a breeder in person or by proxy and talk to multiple references.|`|wS9TkFcvaa	Check www.puppyfind.com alot of breeders advertise on there and you can search your state and maybe find someone local. or check the AKC website you can find breeders there too.

I found out about the show through the doberman club of atlanta.     If you want to know about the show, visit www.lkcweb.org (they have other web urls that lead to them listed on their site near the bottom of the homepage.   And the show is under winter show.     I think boxers will be there, especially if there are breeders in the ga/fl area, but I would call and ask when since it is a 4 day event.
qMhUhAALaa	Hello! Your question is a good one! It is not a problem to get another dog, even a young one. My question would be, what kind of dog you have now? Is your current dog ok with other dogs?   Next would be male or female? If you have a male, you should probably consider the opposite sex, providing of course they are both neutered/spayed, lol.....First thing to do when introducing a new kid on the block is to do it very SLOWLY, especially where your current dog is older, the last thing your dog needs is a kid bothering him/her all day  lol. Your new dog will need an adjustment time as well, getting to know you all, his/her new surroundings, and getting to know his/her new friend.  If you get a young pup, you would or should consider crate training, this will serve a variety of purposes. 1. house breaking(pups or unhousebroken dogs need to learn how to hold potty) 2. safety, in that if this is a young dog it will keep them safe from electrical cords, or bad things to eat 3. The crate will give the older dog a chance to get to know the new dog slowly, and give both opportunity to "sniff" without being threatning to each other. Of course going to the SPCA is a very generous and kind thing to do as there are so many unwanted and abandoned pets that deeply need a good home, so that is wonderful that you guys are considering that option. If done slowly and carefully your new dog will become your current dogs best friend...Bravo to you guys! And Good Luck!!! Hope this helps!!|`|6E16tR6xaa	Yes. I had a dog of 13 years when we bought a new puppy. They got along great and played around all the time. It's good for the dogs to have a companion. I say get one.|`|enC9TvxUaa	-0Sounds exciting for you!  Give yourself time to get used to the new place, as well as time for the animals to do the same!  A little later, check the local SPCA and they should be able to show you some dogs that seem to be friendly with other dogs.  If yours is friendly now around other dogs, should probably not have any problems at all.  Enjoy your new home and new friend when you get him!|`|ADjeuxIiaa	The best thing to do is let your older dog and your kitten get acclimated to the new house so they can be more confident with a new family member being introduced. When you go to the SPCA to pick out a new dog, take your older dog along to find out which dogs he gets along with. Many humane societies prefer that your introduce your pets just to be sure a good match is made.|`|AA11244754	Yes I did.  The morning after I brought her home she went between the hind legs of my other dog, under her, raised her head up and nipped her on the chest!  HA HA.  It took my older and bigger dog about 3 or so months be stop being afraid of a small miniature schnauzer puppy and to start playing the mother role with her (my other dog was an Austilian Shepard Cow Dog).  I do thing that you should get your new family member from a rescue and be sure to take your older dog with you so that you can be sure tha he/she is going to be okay with the new family member and they feel like they have had a paw in helping pick out the newest addition to the family.  It will go along way in making the acceptance a lot smoother.|`|0QpKKdNIaa	First you have to consider what breed your older dog is. If you research it, many websites will tell you if your breed is the type that is okay to be introduced to new animals later in life or if your dog is the type that must be brought up with other animals from the time your dog was a puppy. Also, think about your dog's temperament. Has your dog ever been aggressive in the past or shown signs that they are territorial over food or toys or attention? Those would be signs that you might want to wait on a new animal. You need to think about the type of dog you're getting as well. Some breeds just don't do well with other pets in the home, although if you get it as a puppy the chances are reduced that you'll have a problem.    My best advice is to go to the spca and pick a dog you like, go home and do some research on that breed, and then bring your dog to the spca with you to meet the dog you're thinking of getting. Most spca centers and shelters have an area where they will assist you in introducing the two dogs. This is a huge decision and I know first hand how hard (and expensive!) it can be when two of your animals don't get along.    Good luck!!

an1L8njXaa	I would reccomend a saddle that fits your horse! thats the most importanat thing!|`|eTE8woOmaa	I would not recommend a recently (last 5 yrs) made billy cook saddle. These recent ones have been made on an assembly line and do not fit a horses back correctly. There is usually about 2 inches of clearence between the horses withers and the swell, which is good. I have ridden in the Martha Josey saddles and enjoyed them. I now ride in a GY saddle and will never own a different saddle. If you like a saddle that puts you forward and close to your horse, then these saddles are perfect. They are based out of Marshall, TX and you custom design your own saddle. The prices usually run 1000-1500. It really does not matter the brand of saddle as long as it fits your horse and is comfortable. Beware of Quarter Horse BARS!|`|4253fb6106243c0983e2542e5a7a5adaaa	All the barrel saddles offered by Circle Y are well-made.  They're all comfortable.  They have different models - such as the Martha Josey ones which have taller, thinner horns.  I personally don't care for those horns as they get in my way, but people who've grown up with them really like them.    I own older Crates barrel saddles and I've always loved them - they're what I grew up in.  I don't find a lot of difference in the comfort of these vs. the Circle Y saddles.  There's a lot more technology in today's Circle Y saddles vs. the old Crates of 20 years ago that I use.    I personally just purchased within the last couple years a different kind of barrel saddle - it too  is made by Crates.  I think it's worth your checking out - search the web for the Freedom Saddle by Meleta Brown.  I happened upon these saddles because my sister has one.  When my mare was 4, she was mutton-withered - she had real bulky withers which disallowed any saddle to fit.  None of my older Crates fit right, the Martha Josey didn't fit right - the circle Y wide saddles were too wide.  So I tried her Meleta Brown and it fit perfectly.    Meleta keeps two of these saddles in circulation last I knew.  You have to pay shipping and you can only keep them for a week or so - but she'll send you one to try out to be sure it's what you want - I don't know a saddle maker other than her that will do this for you.  Meleta's saddles are made 'different' - they have a tree with a different twist that's hard to explain in words.  The front of the bars flare outward somewhat which allows for wider shoulder action and a better all-around fit.  As the bars go toward the rear of the horse, they twist to a more flat form which allows the horse's hindquarters a wider range of action getting around a barrel - the saddle doesn't inhibit the turn of the horse, but it allows full skirts which create a better fitting saddle by dispersing your weight more evenly across a greater space - as opposed to saddles with very short, rounded skirts which can put pressure on a narrow area of the horse's back and can pinch.  so Meleta's saddle is a full-skirted, square skirted saddle with a lot of 'meat' that doesn't interfere with the horse's movement.    I personally think that all things considered, her saddle and the personal attention you can get by contacting her is top notch.  Meleta's got a lot of knowledge about saddle fit - she's been a barrel racer and she's not one of those 'I know it all" self important people - she's real folks who wants to ensure you and your horse the best product.  I know she attends some expos - so maybe you could contact her and see if she's going to be near you anytime soon.      Her saddles are not outside the range of Circle Ys - they're probably actually a better price than some that I know of from Circle Y.  If you do decide on a Circle Y, question the seller about the policy of using it - if you can, get your horse to the dealer to properly fit the saddle.  No dealer will allow you to take a saddle and 'rent' it or test it in action for more than a couple days, but if you ask if their rep has suggestions perhaps Circle Y has some sort of program where someone has a saddle you could use to try before buying.  I think they all should and maybe Circle Y has learned this is a good thing to offer.    Good luck|`|5TCewPYRaa	I suggest a Frontier saddle--I custom made mine from them and it is amazing! My sister has the Raylee Edwards saddle from Frontier and my friend has the Finalist Racer from Frontier    Their website is http://www.westernshop.com    They have the most amazing quality and are very attentive to details :)          Also Martha Josey saddles are quite outstanding!

fWf3A3Ioaa	They will usually breed after the nest is built - and often breeding occurs in/on the nest itself.  Sometimes you might see them breeding before the nest is built if they've got nesting materials and suitable location lined up.    I would wait at least 4 weeks before re-introducing the nest to the pair.  I would have probably separated the birds after the infertile eggs were removed :\|`|L6RVh1XQaa	Just let them have nest.

Many hens will happily breed themselves to exhaustion, it is not good to allow her to do this. I would let her try again, and then let her have a break and try again next spring. Remember to offer cuttlebone, nyger and flaxseed, this will help to prevent eggbinding.|`|T2rU15Nsaa	If they are carrying around the nesting material, put the nest back in. They will work the nest for a period of time, usually a week or so, and when they are satisfied that it is just right, you will see them copulating. You will also see him feeding her a lot. Within a few days you should have your first egg. She will lay one egg every couple of days until there are 3 to 5 eggs in the nest. She will not start sitting on the eggs until they are all laid, so don't worry. A few random words of advice:  *dont mess with the nest, eggs, or the babies. leave them alone. She knows what she is doing and any stress could cause her to abandon the nest entirely.  *make sure they have plenty of light, and fresh air, but no drafts (I'm sure you know this already)  *give her a diet rich in calcium. Extra broccoli, eggs with the shells, etc. etc.. (but don't leave in the cage more than a few hours or it will go bad)  *when the chicks hatch, she needs soft food to feed them. Google canary nestling food for some ideas.  *if she sits around puffed up and shaking for a long time and looks unwell she may be eggbound. This is treatable, but you have to catch it in time. It doesn't happen a lot but if it is her first clutch keep an eye on her and look for the signs.  Best Wishes!!!

woYQ7cp6aa	i think that getting a new rat might help. although i completely understand how much you love your rats and you might not want to "replace" her.|`|uuPJ9xmNaa	I know how you feel. The same thing happened to my rat when her friend died. She was depressed and wouldn't eat. I tried giving her treats and playing with her but she was still really sad. When I got a new rat to be her friend she slowly perked up. My advice is to give you both sufficient grieving time then get her a new friend. Hope I helped. Give Cookie a pet for me!|`|XT4MPPewaa	Buy another female rat(preferably around the same age).   And carry on as normal, not too many other changes such as cage/bedding/toys etc.  Get her out more ! Play with her, you are now her only friend and she needs you.   If you pay attention to what i just said she should be fine after a week or so, they may just be rats but they still have minds, just like us if we had lost someone so close to us and then kept on our own with nobody else to see. And then if loads of changes such as boxes & bedding were changes straight after you wouldn't know what was going on?  Think like the rat.  Oh and im sorry about the loss of your rat, you did the right thing putting her out of her misery.|`|85vDqn6naa	My dog did the same thing when the other died, i got another dog and this seemed to help her, you just have to give them time to heal, when you are ready get another rat, that is so sad, sorry for your loss, good luck.

Then she uses more cotten to wipe it clean, and puts the hose in the sheath to rinse it out. <br>  <br>  Then we wait for someone to come around and drink out of the hose and ask " you like vanilla bean??"<br>  <br>  Be careful for the kicks..most horses are good, and few are so bad that they need to be sudated.<br>  <br>  It can depend on the horse how often it needs to be cleaned.. <br>  My horse gets cleaned once every 6 months because I request that and he only has one very very small bean.<br>  Some may need it every 2-4 months.<br>  How ever often you would like to clean it!<br>  <br>  OH AND THE SONG!!!<br>  <br>  To the tune of "If you're happy and you know it"...<br>  <br>  If it's hanging and you see it lube your hands<br>  If it's hanging and you see it lube your hands<br>  If it's hanging and you see it<br>  Grab it quick it's time to clean it<br>  If it's hanging and you see it lube your hands.<br>  <br>  If it's peely and it's crusty pick it off<br>  If it's peely and it's crusty pick it off<br>  If it's peely and it's crusty<br>  and the smell is kind of musty<br>  If it's peely and it's crusy pick it off<br>  <br>  If his weenie has a beanie dig it out<br>  If his weeny has a beanie dig it out<br>  If his weiner has a beaner<br>  Pull it out and he'll be cleaner<br>  If his weenie has a beenie dig it out<br>  <br>  Now he's happy and you know it wash your hands<br>  Now he's happy and you know it wash your hands<br>  It's a job that's kind of kinky<br>  And now your hands are really stinky<br>  But he's happy and you know it wash your hands.|`|GbtRPEuxaa	you need rubber gloves for sure cause the smell gets on your hands and i can only compare it to being spayed by a skunk it <br>  you wash and wash and it just has the little smell<br>  any way its probably pretty dry so you need to moisten it up baby oil rub it in pretty good then wash it out with war m water and a mild soap you need to make sure you get all the soap ou tthat's the affordable way<br>  most people get a vet <br>  tranquilizer makes it so much easier the first couple times<br>  when you use stallions for breeding you do it every time you service a mare on a gelding it should be done when it starts lookinggrottyy<br>  if it gets bad it can getgranulel tissue and it can cause badbehaviorr such as bucking i have gotten horses in training and found that to be the reason scleanlinesses is important<br>  have a great day its not that bad of a job|`|piVngGRBaa	Ha ha, cleaning a horses sheath is a little hard to do alot of times. most times its best to wait 'till your horse hangs a little bit, then grab it and start to work.<br>  I clean my geldings sheath 1nce every 2 months, and i use baby oil an a small soft sponge. As for getting rid of the bean, just get a good hold of the horse's penis, and wait until he calms down to start. alot of horses don't like sheath cleaning, others love it. when your horse calms down, take the sponge already soaked in baby oil (we use baby oil but you can actually use olive oil if you really wanted to...) and gently rub the bean until it loosens and after a while you can scrub it a little bit. My horsedoesn'tt mind having his sheath cleaned, and he doesn't get a very large bean so it doesn't take to long for me, but depending on how much is built up it mayTakek a little while to finish.|`|r5XLbLpVaa	Use baby oil or just water if you can't use anything else and don't want to use soap!<br>  Start by A. Drugging him/twitching him/chain-shanking him.....you should have lelp with it!<br>  Then stick your hand up there...wear a glove...put baby oil on it...<br>  Grab it in there and pull it firmly and gently out if you can<br>  Clean off all that you can<br>  If you can't get it out then clean the best you can and WATCH OUT FOR KICKS<br>  <br>  Your horse's sheath has a population of "friendly" microorganisms that help maintain a healthy balance within. If you clean it too frequently, you'll kill these microorganisms, disrupting this balance--and your horse's sheath is likely to get even dirtier. It's best to clean his sheath every 6 to 12 months.<br>  <br>  ou can do a very thorough job even when your horse hasn't dropped--simply by reaching up inside. In this case, you'll need to go in up to your elbow, so wear a long disposable glove to avoid getting the greasy, smelly smegma on your arm and sleeve. Ask your vet for an obstetrical glove--it's perfect for the job. You'll also need a bucket of warm water and about 20 heavy-duty paper towels. To clean your horse's sheath, put a generous dollop of sheath cleaner (about 2 to 3 tablespoons) in your hand, along with a wet towel. Reach up into your horse's sheath, and gently work the accumulated grime loose. When the towel gets soiled, grab a new one, and keep working until the towel comes back clean. Clean all the way from his sheath's opening up to the base of his penis. Depending on how dirty the sheath is, you may need to use additional cleaner as you go. <br>  <br>  remove the bean-a ball of whitish goo that forms within a small pocket at the tip of your horse's penis. If not removed, a bean can get as large as a walnut and obstruct urine flow, which can cause your horse discomfort and potential harm. If you don't know how to remove the bean, ask your vet to show you.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.equisearch.com/horses_care/health/grooming/eqsavvy386/" rel="nofollow">http://www.equisearch.com/horses_care/he...</a>|`|IMPvzBk1aa	I'll leave it to the others to tell you how.  I suggest you use K-Y jelly, which is water soluble and won't hurt or irritate, and doesn't have to be rinsed off.  It is the lubricant we use for just about everything in human medicine.  I use it to clean sheaths, and the job is fast and easy.|`|4AfRTzRmaa	most of the time you have to get to sudate them and  (get the vet to do that) then they will finish it. SORRY that the only way i know.|`|5M57TTfpaa	i have heard ivory soap was good because it was a softer less harsh soap. but i have not done it yet either, so dont know for sure. ill just check out your answers so i wont have to ask myself. =]|`|xnhwmontaa	WITH MY COLT YOU COULD SPRAY RIGHT UP INSIDE. IF ITS OUT WE CAN GRAB IT AND CLEAN IT WITH NO PROBLEMS.....HE IS TWO AND WE DO IT EVERY BATH AND WITH NO PROBLEMS. WE USE DAWN DISHSOAP.  WORKS REALLY GOOD ON HIS WHITE LEGS!|`|034f5753f9ad6567e841eda4b3bd8210aa	I usually try to use Ivory dish soap, it's gentle and easy to find.  The problem with cleaning a sheath is that you usually have to sedate the horse so that he'll drop his penis out and you'll be able to get into the sheath and get the bean of smegma that causes problems.  I've only know a couple that would let you do it without sedation<br>  <br>    I only clean a sheath once per year unless there is a problem with major buildup, or infection of some sort.<br>  <br>    I would put on rubber gloves, like exam gloves, and make sure to use warm water.  Sedate your horse and wait til he relaxes and drops his penis out, then gently grasp his penis and take either a soft rag or cotton and wet it down and put the soap on and gently wipe the penis off starting at the end and working up to the sheath and around the entire penis knocking off the dirt and smegma that are built up.<br>  <br>    After you've wiped off his penis with a rag, use your gloved hand and a little soap to work your way up into the sheath and scrub around the inside of the sheath, you should be able to feel the bean once you get up inside the sheath.  Just keep scrubbing gently until it comes loose.  The goal is to get as much of the build up as you possible can.<br>  <br>    This is a pretty good and simple article.<br>   <a href="http://www.horsechannel.com/horse-health/sheath-cleaning-842.aspx" rel="nofollow">http://www.horsechannel.com/horse-health...</a>|`|ejj2N3uaaa	Oh, the fun you will have! (that's slightly sarcastic...ha).<br>  <br>  We use Excalibur at school on the school horses and haven't had any problems with it. At home, I always just use regular people soap and haven't had any problems. Just make sure it's a mild, regular soap.<br>  <br>  It's one of those things you just kind of have to experience--it's really hard to describe (although I'll try). The easiest way to learn is to watch someone else do it if at all possible and then try it yourself with them watching so they can tell you if you're getting it. That's how I learned. <br>  <br>  What I do is start by taking the hose and rinsing out the inside of the sheath. Some horses do not like this, so be careful that you don't get kicked in the head--sheath cleaning puts you in a pretty vulnerable position. Take your time and let your horse get used to it. I then take the soap/cleanser, pour some in my hand, and basically massage it inside the sheath as far up as I can go (you'll be able to feel the tip of the shaft--don't force past that). You'll probably feel a lot of crusty stuff; just massage it with your fingers and soap and even use your fingernails (pleasant, I know) to get it out (it'll probably look like a lot of black gunk--that's what you should see). After you've done that for a minute or two and think you've gotten a good bit, take the hose and rinse again to get all of the soap and loose particles out. Rinse your hand off as well. Then repeat to get anything you missed. When it feels pretty smooth and clean (you don't feel all of the crusty stuff and can't get any more black gunk out), you've probably gotten it pretty clean. Getting the bean can be a challenge. It's going to be at the very tip of the shaft. If you have a horse who draws up and doesn't like this whole deal, it's a little harder, but you can do it. Reach up inside the sheath until you feel the tip. Basically, just move your fingers around until you feel something kind of firm and you'll want to pull that out. Sometimes it's really easy and it all comes out at once; other times it's annoying or hard and it doesn't come out at one time. It's usually not all that big and it's a grayish/white color. If you think you've got it, rinse again and then check one more time. If everything up inside the sheath feels soft and smooth (no crusty areas, gunk coming out on your hand, or firm pieces at the very tip) you've probably gotten everything.<br>  <br>  We generally did it once a year at school, I think, and that's what I try to do with my horses (though I have gotten behind this year...). It's worked just fine. If you notice that your horse has a problem (he seems to have trouble urinating, seems to be in pain, is "squeaking" a lot, or has black gunk on his legs/draining from his sheath), do it more often (and if cleaning it doesn't fix it, call a vet). But if your horse is urinating easily and regularly and seems okay, once a year is plenty.<br>  <br>  EDIT: Using a glove is really up to you. I do sometimes because, basically, it's gross and I don't like the gunk getting under my fingernails. However, I find it easier to do everything without using gloves (because I can feel it more easily). Also, many horses will never drop for you, so just waiting for them to drop and then "grabbing it and starting to work" isn't going to be a definite--you may have to clean by feel, not by sight (which is certainly possible--I do it every time). Also, not every horse will have to be drugged, chained, or twitched. None of my horses ever have (usually I do it completely by myself with the horse tied normally in a wash stall) and only like two of our 17-19 horses at school needed any sort of sedation (and that was to prevent me from getting kicked--I always did the more difficult ones).
zqVDJxUIaa	You need a filter, preferably one that has an output of around 90+ gallons per hour (it'll say on the box), and a heater (50w) if you plan on keeping tropical fish.|`|hKXIeur6aa	I would go for a koralia nano pump for water movement. Also, a small skimmer will really help.|`|H06PtiIAaa	i hope you know what your doing.<br>  <br>  But i would get a hydor nano powerhead to add more circulation. also a nano protein skimmer, something is better than nothing.|`|o8LX83jVaa	you need 2 powerheads, some prefer a filter, again not needed but a skimmer, and a bucket that will be used for saltwater mixes because you need to let the saltwater solution sit out overnight, preferably with a powerhead. also you will need marine salt, not iodized or even non-iodized salt from the grocery store, and a heater. also if the tank has ever been used for freshwater, you need to make sure that you never used any meds in the tank that contain cooper. <br>  <br>  fish wise, i would only put 1-2 small fish (meaning 4 inches or less per fish) in that size tank. and with a tank that small, i would put only soft corals like mushrooms to begin with. <br>  <br>  hope this helps!|`|6gB6AAoyaa	well some kind of pump just for water movement. but<br>  there's allot you can get it just depends on what you want
x8Vgu6acaa	I don't consider it safe to take a dog to the dog park.  Not so much because of the parasites which can be managed. or diseases that we can vaccinate against.  But because irresponsible owners let there unmanagable dogs loose with yours.  You do not know the owners or the dogs.  I will only let my dogs run with dogs that I know are well adjusted and safe.|`|6rSBVcQ4aa	It's perfectly safe.  You are more likely to get something rather than your dog.|`|vRG0ebayaa	If he's had vaccinations then its safe|`|5PWzxw4Xaa	dog trainer 30 plus years -  Oh love...there are parasites etc...in our homes, that's why God gave us an immune system to fight off those things.  It's a wonderful place for your dog to go and enjoy the great outdoors, plus it helps them to get socialized.  They learn to meet and greet people as well as other dogs they don't know.  It's great exercise as well.  Since you are getting your dog vet checked you can relax...they will let you know if there is something to worry about.  Enjoy life...that's what it's here for!!  Happy trails!  :)|`|QVP8zSuWaa	Ours not so safe!! It is right next to the sewer treatment plant, which have had a few accidents.  I avoid it at all cost. Hopefully other cities are more pleasant|`|qMhUhAALaa	As long as your dog has been properly immunized he/she will be fine with disease that is contagious. Parasites is another issue. Even if your dog is free of worms/parasites, be careful that the dog is not allowed to sniff another dogs feces in the park, that is a common way for dogs to get worms. With annual Vet visits they always as k for a stool sample, so if the dog has been exposed and contracts worms/parasites they are easily gotten rid of. If you suspect your dog has been around a strange dogs feces, wait a few weeks and ask to have a stool sample tested if you get concerned. Typical signs of worms are diarrhea, vomiting, weight loss, and with some parasites there can be blood in the stool. But , most folks take care of their pets, in that regard, but just thought I should give some tell tail signs of worms.|`|vPde97E2aa	The disease & pests & filth *&* the unruly,ill-mannered running-loose brutes & their dogs is why I'll NEVER take my dogs into such an area.|`|wS9TkFcvaa	I'm sure it would be fine just watch him and make sure he doesn't eat anything|`|XKKSfo6raa	you spell it SAFE not SAVE just to tell you|`|eapfTYqpaa	As long as your dog received his vaccinations, he'll be fine outdoors.|`|0TTZERJmaa	well its ok to take him out two weeks after his second shot. if it's the shot im thinking about. Is it booster shots that you get once every year or puppy shots?    you need to put more detail XD     hope i helped though x x x|`|y7UsGijGaa	if your truely worryed then give your dog a bath afterwards just in case he picked up fleas or anything.|`|a1343f058c3dec40fe918611b8bc0ceaaa	if he has all his shots should be safe|`|UTP1UBIRaa	If your dog is caught up in his/her vaccinations than it should be safe.  I would still be careful to allow contact with other dogs that are visibly ill.  If you are still unsure your vet will be happy to answer any questions that you may have.
UCCAAqpUaa	I haven't used that EXACT saddle, but I did have a saddle that was made by the same company--Derby Originals.  For the price, it is a very high quality brand.  The seat was very comfortable and supportive, and the knee rolls were very soft.  I didn't use it a lot, but it seemed to hold up well to my weekly trail riding.  (The saddle I had was a cross country type saddle--this looks more like an all-purpose or dressage).  If this is your price range, I would say go for it.  How much are you paying for it?|`|xi6avrGgaa	For  Quality Western Saddles, English Saddles, Horse Saddles, and Pony Saddles, contact www.saddleonline.com    Thanks|`|ewwfcDDyaa	I don't ride dressage. I like the henri de revel saddles, and I loooooove crosby!!!! but those are english. I've heard havana is a good, popular brand. oh its all purpose?? wait, it is??? i just read that.....hmmmm. it sure doesn't look like one.|`|vaulPrAmaa	I can't get on the site - describe it...    kind, colour, size, age, users before, price, etc|`|7IVrBiT1aa	Well I haven't but I have a friend in the rodeo that has and she said its nice but kinda hurts the butt once you get off of it, But most saddles do that.|`|B6zl0AJDaa	It's a saddle made in India (Saw the same thing by another poster last week), made in the new AP style, but I wouldn't touch it with a 10 ft pole.  Indian leather isn't tanned the same way European or American leather is and their craftsmanship leaves something to be desired.    I'd take my money and go look for the same thing in a used Crosby, Crump, Stubben, Courbette or other European made saddles.|`|Wvb08bniaa	It is a dressage saddle. Recently, I had get Dressage Saddle from http://www.agritura.com/index.php/cat/c1... . I can't believe I found such a GREAT saddle. Its got a very deep seat that is soft. Grippy buffalo leather on the entire saddle. Adjustable tree, so it fits any horse I decide to use it on. Wool flocked panels, 2" cutback head, and a tall knee roll. Quality of leather is wonderful - broke in like a dream and leather is soft as butter. Such, Best Saddle.|`|OIAn5oVpaa	is that a dressage saddle?|`|jZwK9WlLaa	Yes    It is a dream, comfortable for the horse and lovely to sit on. supports you and easy to balance on. However it does depend on the horses shape a little bit. It is mainly opinion as well and what you like, i do however really think its a great saddle... well if its the one i think it is (im pretty sure it is)|`|AA11625368	I have used an all purpose saddle before. I typically use them for training to keep my show saddles nice. I know nothing of that brand for quality though.
3p6wp7DYaa	You know, at this point, your mind should be focused on how to solve your issues with this dog, not whether he loves you or just wants treats. It is not normal for a 2 year old dog to live locked up in a cage, never get any walks and not be housebroken yet. What are you and your family doing that nobody ever consider teaching this dog to go potty outside and take him out for walks.     It doesn't matter if it is winter or not. The dog needs to get out for regular walks. If you took him out enough times, he would learn to go potty outside and he wouldn't be forced to live in a cage all day long. That is absurd and cruel, by the way. You have a dog, not a snake.    The dog pees in the room when nobody is watching because you don't take him outside. He only pees when he is alone because he learned that peeing + a human nearby = punishment. He will be very hard to potty train if you ever get around to facing up to this reality. Poor guy...    No, I don't think he loves you. Would you love some giant alien who didn't try to understand you but instead kept you caged in a house without fresh air, sunlight, and fun and who punished you when you had to use the bathroom in the only place where you thought you were safe doing it?|`|1399ad3bbdc56a8d68fc6ce5430a21ffaa	As a general rule of thumb, your dog just wants treats.|`|OxFsslN8aa	Oh boy are you going to have issues later with this dog.  A dog NEEDS to get exercise.  If you keep that dog in a "really huge" kennel & his energy keeps building day after day he will eventually have to release that energy somehow.  He could bite you or someone else, he can chew things he shouldn't, he can develop anxieties that are hard to treat.  Tell your father to read this post.  Tell him to pay for obedience classes so you can learn to care for the dog properly.  A dog will never learn to pee or poop where you want it to if you keep it in a cage.  Please rehome the dog if this is going to be its life.|`|R4gWNdvgaa	ur dog just need to be trained.. and he can handle the wind for a little, u should still take him out for a quick play or something...    mine loves me cause she spits treats out when i give them to her and she just wants me to tell her good job and love her back!|`|KxjUim7yaa	My dog loves me because I love him. I feed and do everything he needs, and he sleeps on my lap in the evening.  Dogs that are not trained run away. He needs to go for walks on a leash. He can wear a sweater or coat and the walks don't have to be long. You need to start obedience training and potty training right away. Don't let him have the run of the house, and use Nature's Miracle on the accidents.|`|oVUKtH5aaa	No offense, but the question you ask is the LEAST of your concerns. First of all, some dogs do the "air Licking" as a sign of submission. This is a whole other subject.  You mention the weather..icy winds hurt YOU or your dog?  There is a billion dollar industry built around keeping your dog warm. Get some little booties (they come in xxs) and a coat. Any dog should get at the BARE minimum 20 minutes of "continued" walking a day. The reason he runs as fast as he can and does not look back,( maybe even when you call him) means he NEEDS excersize.  And though it makes you LOL it's won't be funny if he got hit by a car, or got lost .  You don't mention any other family members. Did everyone want this dog?  Are you the only one taking care or it and walking him? You don't mention your age.   As for the your little pom being in a crate all day because he is not potty trained? * Train him please! * Have a regular schedule for potty breaks. He only pees alittle bit not because 'he knows it's bad," but because he doesn't want to live in his own elimination.What do you do when he starts to pee alittle bit?  You can get help from your local shelter or even the internet. Take a class. Read some books. Did you just get this dog at the age of two? or has he been pooping in his crate for two years? I agree with another person's answer. Show this to your father and make a decision if this is the right home for your pom. They are smart dogs and live a long time so if this is the life it will continue to have, you will have a very unhappy dog.  I am just thinking that you need to get educated about dogs...before you get one.  I know Poms are cute (I rescued one) but your  dog has  needs too. And ultimatley you get what you put in.  It takes time, consistancy, and commitment.   As for the treat part, he probably just wants treats because all dogs love food, but he is also bored and might eat himself to a huge weight.  Good Luck. And think of what is best for your dog.|`|IFiwmb3Haa	I know my dog loves me because he crawls up on the couch and lays his head in my lap.  Because when we're out hiking in the woods he'll run ahead but wait for me to catch up.  I know my dog loves me because he pins me down and licks my face.  And because he gets all wiggly when I look at him and call his name.
enC9TvxUaa	-For his sake, get another bird roughly the same size.  Also, getting another conure would be better as they will ahve the same habits/instincts.  2 cages are a must!  Put them close, so they can enterttain each other, but seperate them as they could do serious damage to one another!|`|Qas05nZraa	parrot|`|RgbARcJTaa	get it a love bird   i have a single 2 year old peached face love bird|`|Zh1Y6lFIaa	If you want more than one parrot and want to be able to enjoy them both (at the same time) it's best to keep them near the same size. I have a galah and african grey and because they are around the same size, I was able to soclialize them well to one another. Here is a blog about how to socialize two birds; http://jamiesparrothelp.wordpress.com/20...    If you want to eventually keep them in the same cage together, you will need to plan on a whole new cage (new to both birds) otherwise one will be territorial over the other because it was in that cage "first".     It is safest to get them around the same age or so - a baby bird with a matured bird don't mix well at all.|`|bYPfFCr4aa	monkey is this best patner|`|eRIge5D9aa	another conure for sure...another sun would be good...or a green cheek conure, nanday conure, jenday conure..a quaker would even make a good friend..or a cockatiel..but another counure would be best.
yoS4cAszaa	Female?|`|TnQEOdX0aa	The only absolute way to tell is by a DNA test. Dumb, I know, but it's not very possible to tell just by looking at it because the sexes usually look very similar with lovebirds.|`|9e4cc937385b500f07dcfe521561dfc1aa	With lovebirds you cannot tell by looking.<br>  It sounds like you want us to guess so I guess Male?|`|blIUbMzaaa	I would say male since the head looks to be flatter on top. It has been my experience that the females have a much rounder head on top.

Also they are so easy to care for and live up to 3 years in a fish bowl or 5-6 in a tank.|`|WItdtl0Vaa	They're all pretty easy to take care of, just toss some food in every other day and there ya go :D Maybe start with a guppy or a goldfish or beta fish.|`|psqkf6rMaa	betta|`|39a2d5e9bc3c417cbdc5ba33cb6386bbaa	OK, a lot of people like to perpetuate myths here.  The Top Contributors have good info.  Pretty much everyone else doesn't know what they're talking about. <br>  <br>  -Goldfish cannot be kept in bowls, in fact...no fish should.  They need 20 gallons to themselves. <br>  -No fish will live long in a bowl.  <br>  -Try a 2.5 or 5 gallon tank.  If you can't afford that or don't want to go that big, you should rethink getting a fish. <br>  -All fish need a filter, clean water, and a tank, not a bowl.<br>  -That said, if you get a heater, bettas are fairly easy to take care of.  <br>  It will be fine by itself, comes in all sorts of colors, and can live several years if kept properly.  <br>  -Before you get the fish, makes sure you understand the nitrogen cycle and have cycled your tank, know what to feed it, have a dechlorinator on hand, etc.<br>  <br>  Because people buy the bowls.  They buy the fish and put them in the bowl, the fish die, then they come back and buy some new fish.  It's all about the money.  Just like some pet stores sell puppies.  They're all puppy mill dogs, and most are or will become ill and have temperament problems.  But again, people buy them.  It's up to the consumer to do the research.|`|BMri9tITaa	Guppies are known as Just Add Water fish for a reason.  Also: bettas are a long-time favorite, incredibly easy and hardy.  No goldfish.  They get huge and they're messy and they're picky.<br>  <br>  For your first tank, rather than a bowl, I'd recommend a 10-20 gallon tank.

Fish bowls are outdated and have given many people false impressions about fish. How many people know that goldfish should live at least 15-20 years?

n7bok7NRaa	Call the vet and talk to them - I've had many female cats and all of them were spayed - not one of them had post-op bleeding.|`|AA11457471	It depends on if your cat was in heat when she was spayed. I think a call to the vet is wise.|`|oSPT8dnaaa	she is healing from the prosedure|`|435c271Kaa	If it is a small ammount, it is normal. If it keeps on, then I would check with the vet.
2fc18cb5f88753ef637567f67fae948caa	Yes they will use it, if the environment is good for them. (like the outside of the cage's environment). Give them some kleenex tissues that you will rip in piece, and some grass twigs (or there are some commercially sold, I'd rather use the outside ones). She will build the nest with it.  Once she lay eggs, do not disturbe the nest, not even to peek at them. I find zebra finches really easy to disturbe, and they will abandon the nest or destroy the eggs.  For the female to lay eggs, she will need calcium in her diet. So give them the shell of the normal chicken egg that  you broke up in pieces. They will break the shell in even smaller piece and that's all. She will lay eggs eventually.  Once the babies are out, give the parents cook-thru hard boiled chicken eggs to feed the babies with. The parents will eat the eggs and feed the babies with it.   Is it such a nice thing to see zebra finches raising little babies. I had the chance to experience three cluthes of babies during the time I had my birds. Good luck!|`|fWf3A3Ioaa	Yes - they can use them.. but they don't necessarily need a box that large.  A simple 5x5x5" box would work just fine.|`|qeOlkRM0aa	That will work fine. Zebra finches aren't picky. Mine used to lay eggs in her food dish.
aeNiPKRBaa	give the cat away|`|Mzvp1LPFaa	Standard poodles are hunting retrievers and are still trialled as such. They have an intense prey drive and temperamental sharpness; that's why they are so easy to teach protection skills.  This dog has decided the cat is prey and wants with every fiber of his being to get that prey. It may not be possible to ever trust him alone with the cat, even if you can impress upon him he'd better not touch it while you're around.  It might be possible to vent the prey drive in another direction such as teaching him to catch frisbees or do lure coursing, but do be aware that he may simply have too much prey drive to ever be trustworthy around cats.    You could try him out with a basket muzzle, but if he's very heavy he could still hurt the kitten simply by pouncing on it.|`|UF5ZwzHCaa	Please be careful.  First, has the dog been around cats before?  I hate to tell you this, but there maybe nothing you can do.  It is the dog instincts to go after the cat.  It may even kill it.  My personal suggestion is to find a new home for the kitten.  You would feel horrible if anything happened to it.|`|ho7Z4th3aa	give him treats when he listens to you both, this always works with mine who is a pit bull but we still keep a cat|`|QQXMcit7aa	My dog is the same way. what i do is, if he gets excited and tries to attack, i put him in his kennel. i suggest trying that, or a closed room if you don't have a kennel.

Its great to hear you're interested in buying a dog. :) Cocker Spaniels are verry good dogs and that could be a very good option. They do shed a little though.

Be warned though they eat and breath at the same time, so the little dickens is a "Fart Knocker".|`|Jjxg87YBaa	My suggestion is to get a breed either a poodle or mixed with one so it doesn't shed.

They dont shed and have little dander that can  cause allergies.|`|TczMCBGgaa	you should get a cocker spaniel and name it buffer because their ears buff the floors|`|fgxajTiBaa	Why do you need a dog that doesn't shed? Someone have allergies? Or you just don't want to deal with the hair?<br>  <br>  If it's just the hair you don't want to deal with, here is my stance on that: Dogs that 'don't shed' have a coat that continuously grows and will mat if not brushed on a very regular basis. Dogs that do shed need to be brushed to keep them from shedding. So since you're going to be brushing the dog no matter what, it doesn't really matter if it sheds or not.  Some dogs within the same breed will shed more than others and even the 'non shedding' will shed, much like humans shed hair.<br>  <br>  You should check out your local shelter for a medium sized dog and ask specifically for a dog that shed minimally throughout the year. As a shelter worker, we know which dogs we have that shed worse than others.|`|AA10112346	"owned cockers"<br>  <br>  bahhahaha|`|AJxl0IvHaa	Well.... whats you life style?<br>  male if you want a male.<br>  female if you GET HER SPAYED!!!!!!!!!!!!!<br>  male names, Zeus, spike, butch, chance<br>  female names, Cloe, Claire, missy..... abby<br>  im going to have to say, a pug!

Now of course he thinks he's one of the dogs, but they all are kept loose in our backyard with no supervision most of the time and we have never had a problem at all. I think if you socialize them calmly and with the ability to discipline and restrain your dog everyone will be fine.|`|pvEydFxEaa	get rid of ur dog|`|I9YgbXe5aa	I have a rat terrier (key word being rat, so bred for rodent hunting). She doesn't attempt to kill the rabbit I have ever. She just sits there and watches him run around the back yard while I pet her and watch the rabbit. I would not recomend ever letting any dog out with a rabbit or animals such as that. what happened between my dog and our rodents (rats, hamsters, rabbit) iguana, and cat is very unusual and was discovered by accident. She's very well disciplined so if she even took a step torwards the rabbit she'd be told no and stop. I have done special introductions with the pets so that they are fine with one another, however it took a long time with all of them to be comfortable with both and for me to be comfortable with them being near each other. I have done this only because I do not want to ever have an incident where something escapes and is eaten by the dog. So it's possible to not have conflict between them if you know what you're doing and are patient, but other than that it's best to keep them away from each other in all ways possible. It's best if you let your rabbit out while the dog is not around and get a cage that is off the ground. Also, rabbits are very timid but mine is a male that's very brave and stubborn who likes to come check out the dog more than the dog likes checking out the rabbit.

But the only way you can get an accurate price is by calling your vet and asking.|`|Xobbmd7Saa	My barn's vet does it for $150 plus sedation if necessary. I wouldn't advise waiting as overgrown teeth are not comfortable for the horse to eat with. It isn't like clipping where the horse will be cold after.|`|AA10776535	If you can get a halter on your horse a good equine dentist will be able to do your horse.  I have one that will not allow you to bit her, come to find out someone broke some of her teeth.  She loved getting her teeth floated.  I pay 50 dollars a horse, the vet would charge 200 but i do not believe in sedating a horse to do this.  We did 15 horses one day, took hardly no time and they all enjoyed it, even the young ones who have never been done, my dentist is awesome.  She lives several states from me but visits her often to show horses...Im in California and she is in Arkansas.  She has been showing me how to do this when she comes in a couple of weeks i get to do this.  Having a horse rescue every horse i get in here needs it done and this will save me lots of $$$.|`|e334d47d0cf581231e2545cccfc166e2aa	I had two horses done by the vet in the fall, and it was about $115 each (with sedation).<br>  <br>  If he needs it badly, you should probably just go ahead and do it.  However, with those temperatures, it wouldn't do any harm if you waited a couple of weeks.  I just had my young pony's wolf teeth removed and teeth floated today and it was about 36 degrees out.|`|Gc94X8Cjaa	I would get it done as soon as possible.  The temperature isn't going to make a big difference, but he might not be comfortable eating with bad teeth, and when it's cold out, he needs to eat!  Don't wait, because if you ignore teeth, they go away!  But a lot of people have it done when the vet comes out for spring shots, which are usually about now anyway.|`|xLNzdxsOaa	My vet charged around 250, including sedation. Floating is uncomfortable, so I wouldn't go without sedation. My vet used a power floated as opposed to a hand one, it was much faster but I'm not sure how that effects the price.|`|kjgonYlgaa	Last spring I had my 5 year Old done because she had lost so much weight over the winter.  she had no health issues and I narrowed it down to teeth being the cause.  the tissue on the inside of her cheek was torn because her teeth were so sharp.  It cost 150.00 canadian, for her sedation, floating, and her annual health exam and shots.  Some people prefer a dentist to do their horses but if your vet is experienced in this I think it is the more practical and economical way to go.  Check your horses teeth yearly as some need this done more than others.  Get it done right away so it does not interfere with him being able to get adequate nutrition.|`|xzJi0bcSaa	I also live in MN and Im keeping my horse in ND because Im going to school there. I paid less than $100. And that was for sedation, mileage, and the procedure. I like to do it when its warmer unless you absolutely need to do it now, as in your horse is dropping oats and losing a lot of weight. I like to wait because I usually get the sheath cleaned because it saves money cause hes already sedated. (He needs to be for that too... He gets really crabby). 20 above should be fine for floating, I kept my horse in a stall until the sedation wore off cause he shared a paddock with another horse... I hope this helps, if you have any questions, feel free to e-mail me!|`|EQvAbyvcaa	General floating done  by a vet is not usually very expensive.  Maybe cost is about $50 with your other parts of the visit like exam and of course the barn call so the whole visit would be over $100.  As a general rule, floating does not require sedation.  It is a relatively simple task if your horse is halter broke at all.  It is, in my opinion, inferior care for your horse's mouth.<br>  <br>  I would never let a vet "float" my horse's teeth.  I use an equine dentist.  His initial visit is $225 per horse and then future visits are $125.  A vet accompanies my dentist because they have to be sedated for advanced dental work with motorized tools.  You have to pay the vet separately for the sedation which is about $40  per horse.  It is not inexpensive but it is well worth it and you only have to have them maintained about once a year (we usually do every 9 months) and it seems to work for my guys.  You just have to make sure that the dentist has been well trained and knows what he is doing.  My dentist teaches and works throughout the U.S. and Europe.  <br>  <br>  Time of year is irrelevant.  If his mouth needs attention, do it immediately.  Nutritional problems as well as other health problems can be related to problems in the mouth.  Good luck.|`|5i8lDbXfaa	Wow my vet does teeth floating for under $100 dollars, it kinda depends on how much work is needed, and if any wolf teeth have to be removed.  Horses have to be sedated when this is done so you are also paying for that.|`|cjpHKJ2Gaa	Floating where I live is typically $200. It shouldn't matter when you float the teeth. Horses are usually sedated when the teeth are being floated because it can be uncomfortable.|`|Mu1vMc7Maa	where i am, it starts at $40. it all starts racking up once you use tranq, power floats, how bad the teeth are, etc etc. <br>  tranq is usually around $50.|`|ClQoSrMmaa	floating teeth.. huh.. why can't i get my teeth floated?  huh? answer THAT! <br>  <br>  you take em out, and throw them in the air and hope they don't land and BAM its free...|`|ghi9atKVaa	cost 75 to float and pop out the wolf teeth here in TX.   get it done asap because they can drop weight fast especially in the winter.|`|10AaMUfraa	If he needs it badly then why would you wait?  Most vets are not schooled in floating teeth.  There is not a class ( at least in Texas call their school and you will learn something) that teaches them the proper way to float teeth.  They think that just knocking off "points" is all there is to it.  When teeth get long they also effect the opposing tooth.  If they are not aliened properly then they can actually fracture another tooth.  Poor floats can lead to a wavy mouth.  Never allow a vet to try to "cut" the tooth back rather than file it down as the pressure of trying to cut could result in a fracture that could go deep into the tooth.  Like cutting off dog toe nails they shatter easy.  <br>  <br>  It would be odd if the equine dentist didn't sediate the horse because horses don't like their mouth gaped open with a speculum and having their teeth worked on.  Remember they don't have nerves in their teeth like people but they react to just the discomfort of the work being done.
ZfKDp7IXaa	I recently acquired a German shepherd. By recently, I mean thirty minutes ago. I also realized that my past three posts have started with the same sentence. Her name is Ikee. She won't shut up. She is a smart dog. VERY smart. She didn't even consider running away when i squealed and left the gate open. She finally shut up - wait never mind -_- . It is true, German Shepherds Are big and grow big. Their coat consists of two layers, interior and exterior. Interior is a soft, short layer of fur, It serves to keep them warm, Holy crap she shut up. Anywho, The outer layer is for protection against waether. I currntly have a book in front of me specifically about german shepherds. They are the most smarticle, lovable creatures on the face of the earth. (I like Ike; hehe cheesy pun) Ok, lemme see what i can find on german shepherds.......... Ok, so he will shed year round, because he gets rid of the fluffy undercoat twice. (Don't worry he'll grow it back) Why is Ikee so quiet? Anyway, Both things your dad said are true. However German Shepherds are very smart and can do anything and everything. If you get one, you'll deserve a pat on the back.

The vet may want a "sample" of his "P" as the PH may be too high. <br>  <br>  His Diet may not be as Consistent  as it was when you got him- so you may have to "adjust his veggies" or fiber ???  <br>  <br>  Rabbits are a creature of Habit- once they have "Learned it -they keep on Doing it" !!

Then up the urine soaked towel into the litter just to remind him that he should go there. If you ever catch him in the act try to push him toward the litter or put the litter under him.<br>  <br>  He might just be marking his territory. I would give it some time and see how it goes. If he knew how to use the litter i don't think he will completely lose his ways. Just might be going through a weird phase (my rabbit does this sometimes)<br>  <br>  Best advice:don't him go where he pees!!

3Hm5eJfVaa	I am still wondering how I ended up at this question. But anyways I have a story for your essay. When I was 12 we went to my dads friends house and they had 5 guinea pigs stuffed in this really small cage with no food or water. They were starving to death and looked really sick and skinny. I went completely nuts when I saw this and the man said he got them for his kids but they lost interest in them. So instead of making his kids take care of them or taking care of them himself he just let them starve and he was going to dump them into his pond. Needless to say all 5 of them came home with us and lived happily ever after. They make really great pets and are pretty low maintenance. They are much larger than Hamsters, live longer (actually 3 times longer), are affectionate and attentive, and they will talk to you.<br>  While the Guinea Pig is most active during the day, it will also play with you at night - just make sure it rests.<br>  In some 3ed world countries they eat them for food. Maybe that will make your mom let you have one. :)|`|6rwIm5Gnaa	“Probably the saddest story you'll ever see is a mosquito sucking on a mummy.

SzW9GmRsaa	My weigh tape is about 5% out - I know because I've had my ponies on scales at the vet hospital.

They are meant to give you a rough idea of what your horse weighs. Not a pound for pound measurement.<br>  I find them + or - 20lbs|`|3LXbUg1raa	As everyone else has said, they are fairly accurate.  Sometimes on horses that are very mutton withered, or basically don't have any withers to them, and on horses that have very high withers they are not quite as accurate.  With horses such as those, it is more accurate to use the weight tape in more than one spot and take an average of the two weights.  You do the heart/girth measurement and then take a second measurement just behind the withers...take the average of the two and it'll be even more accurate.  <br>  <br>  There is also the other way of measurement where you use the weight formula: the girth measure squared x the length and divide everything by 11,877...<br>  <br>  Either way is rather accurate...|`|Gc94X8Cjaa	It's a good question, but that tape is pretty accurate. <br>  <br>  Horses are built differently then people; while you are correct that measuring a 140lb 4'9" woman may give you the same waist size (or greater!) than a 6' 200lb man, that's because we hold much of our weight in our hips and legs.  Horses carry much more weight in their bodies than their legs, so measuring the torso is much more accurate.|`|Xobbmd7Saa	They have horse scales at a lot of vet clinics and I even have come across some horse weighing facilities who transported a scale to a local show that I was at (it was really quite amusing) Only $10 to have your horse weighed at the show....<br>  <br>  Weight tapes were pretty accurate.

(mostly surgical stuff)|`|YtBzRAxMaa	You don't measure around the belly.<br>   You measure around the girth.<br>   If your tape has been stretched (old) your accuracy will be off. Same when measuring height.<br>   And yes - a 16hh thin horse can weigh as much as a 15hh stocky horse. Height has little to do with weight.|`|vtWDH2U1aa	they are usually between 100 to 200 pounds accurate. if your doing it for wormer you should go heavy anyways and if your doing it for feeding they aren't accurate for that.|`|8Rn2pX4jaa	I have found the tape to be pretty accurate.  But if you want a second way to calculate, we have used this formula as well it takes into account the length of your horse:<br>  <br>  Body Weight (Kgs) =  (Length (cm) multiplied by 0.97)  x  (Girth (cm) multiplied by 1.78)  Divided the above number by 3011<br>  <br>  After figuring it out, I put it back into pounds (1 kilogram = 2.20462262 pounds) as KG mean nothing to me.  ;-)

Also heats easy. Looks nice.<br>  -Repti carpet is crap, it doesn't clean easy, holds bacteria, adn can wrap up in their toes. Heats ok. not so good to look at.<br>  -Tiles clean easy, heat better with a heat lamp, make better basking areas, instead of a total floor covering. <br>  <br>  I use marble 3x3 tiles to make caves and basking areas for alot of my smaller lizards and I use 6x6 for bigger ones. But I use them along with sand. It makes for a nice look. <br>  I would never use repti carpet. It is no dirty and looks terrible. It also is the furthest thing from natural for them.|`|u61yKsE3aa	It is really a preference.  <br>  <br>  Sand can cause impaction but usually only in juvis as adults they are fine on sand.  You want a fine sand if you choose to use it.  Calci sand is sand fortified with calcium.  I think is made to be ingested in very small doses but still not completely digestible.  There are some sands that do claim to be completely digestible.<br>  <br>  Repti-Carpet is really easy to clean and maintain  You can have two so that you just switch them out and you can wash and dry the dirty one with out being an a rush or causing extra stress to your gecko.  Some people don't like it because the don't like the look but it is fine for a gecko.<br>  <br>  Tiles are also okay, they are aesthetically pleasing and safe for you gecko but can be a pain to clean and change.   They do not heat well with undertank heaters. <br>  <br>  You just need to decide which you like better.  I personally have always used sand for my leopard geckos.  I like caribsea reptile terrarium substrate the best.|`|TkJn9gO0aa	I can go ahead and say calcium sand is compete garbage.<br>  <br>  I'm not a huge fan of reptile carpets either...especially with leopard geckos, a s they can get their toes and claws caught in the fibers and have them ripped off. <br>  <br>  Sand obviously details a risk of impaction but it looks better to the keeper.<br>  <br>  Ideally, tile is the best because it eliminates the previously mentioned risks and doesn't present any new risks.

2Ku4DuvCaa	In my experience, that means that something happened to scare the bird, and now he's being cautious.<br>  <br>  Instead of chasing him around with her finger, your sister should instead sit quietly with him for awhile. Talk softly to him, smile, and offer him treats. When he stops fleeing to the other side of the cage when she approaches, that's when it's okay to try to get him up on her finger again.<br>  <br>  However, if he runs away from her finger again, she should stop and continue with offering treats and taking it slow. <br>  <br>  Other things to make sure of are things that she could be wearing that frighten him. I have a ring that I wear on my left pinky that my parakeet refuses to get anywhere near. So obviously, if I'm wearing it, she won't step up. When she tries to get the bird on her finger, she should make sure that she's not wearing any bracelets, rings, or any thing else on her hand that she might not have had before. If she's wearing long sleeves, she should consider rolling them up or changing her shirt before trying to handle him as well. <br>  <br>  The important thing is that she doesn't rush him in coming to her again. She needs to calmly let him become readjust to her presence. If she just keeps chasing him around, then it's only going to make the problem worse. <br>  <br>  With patience and persistence, he'll come around.|`|ZKa1pY6Laa	I am going to guess you do this frequently sfter A while the birds think of your finger as a threat try agin in a month or so if he still not acting very well behaved then email me and I will give you a quick and easy responce|`|jep9LpUpaa	try touching the stomach of your bird, or hold your finger a little bit above it, and see what happens.<br>  <br>  That's just about all I know, :D|`|eOUBsDgWaa	because you need to try harder and let it get use to you talk to it more and keep trying.|`|FHHE2T29aa	he hates you.|`|NIwgdXLPaa	that is odd.

RA3p25Qoaa	I have plastic plants in my tank no issues yet. I have the vines for climbing with suction cups on them. I also have fake coral, some green aquarium plants from the dollar store, a reptile hammock, and netting with plastic hooks for climbing. <br>  <br>  Mine do dig them up and move them from time to time but it's only to clean up the tank and put things back where it belongs. <br>  <br>  You can put anything in there that isn't painted, metal, or made of ever green wood. <br>  <br>  For hides I use ceramic flower pots super cheap at wal-mart. <br>  <br>  make sure you wash the fake plants with hot water first.
zqVDJxUIaa	This is due to a high ammonia concentration. Your aquarium lacks biological filtration (bacteria) which remove toxic compounds. You should add fish one or two at a time, to let the biological load to catch up. For more info check out <a href="http://freshaquarium.about.com/cs/biologicalcycle/a/nitrogencycle.htm" rel="nofollow">http://freshaquarium.about.com/cs/biolog...</a>|`|fWyEoKgRaa	So have you even put fish into the tank yet?<br>  <br>  If so, then yes, they would benefit from having a filter. And you shouldn't add a lot of fish all at once because they will produce a lot of ammonia. Ammonia can make the water cloudy and could potentially kill your fish,<br>  <br>  If you haven't added fish yet, it might be because of the rock. Did you rinse the rock thoroughly before putting it in the tank? Try cleaning it and that should clear up the problem.<br>  <br>  Hope this helps!
YAPYO7L8aa	Take the kitty back. If she's in pain she needs help.<br>  I had to take a kitty back once as she was in so much pain. He gave her a pain shot and it helped her get through it . Don't let her hurt.<br>  <br>  Honestly, if possible I'd take her to another vet. Sounds like he messed her up bad and the vet that did that may not own up to it. I'd hate for her to die because the vet would want to cover his/her butt. <br>  <br>  Please email me later and tell me how she is doing.<br>  Thanks.<br>  <a href="http://gastricbypass.homestead.com/Animals.html" rel="nofollow">http://gastricbypass.homestead.com/Anima...</a>|`|VkXQq2y2aa	Take your cat back to the vet, if its the vets fault, maybe start going to another vet's office. im so sorry, your kitty is hurt :[ why do you want your cats declawed anyways? would you want your fingers cut off?|`|o40QqoQGaa	Aww im sorry...<br>  i would take the cat back to the vet, and demand to know what they did to your cat, and demand they fix it!|`|7fVr3q0kaa	Take your kitty right back to the vet's!<br>  <br>  It is the vet's responsibility to take care of any complications that have come up as a result of the de-clawing he did. Don't feel shy about demanding that your kitty be checked out and treated.<br>  <br>  Trust your gut. YOU know that your kitty is not OK, so don't let the vet get away without thoroughly examining and treating her.<br>  <br>  For the future, de-clawing is not a good idea...it's actually an amputation of part of the kitty's toes, and can cause excruciating pain and damage. I really encourage you NOT to give this kitty a second surgery on her back feet.<br>  <br>  -KittyMamma<br>  <a href="http://KittyMamma.blogspot.com" rel="nofollow">http://KittyMamma.blogspot.com</a>|`|gYNi22IUaa	Yer mom made a big mistake.<br>  What probably happened is the vet cut yer cats nerve.<br>  <br>  Yer cat might die.<br>  Declawing a cat is like ripping yer own penis off er cutting yer vagina lips with rusty scissors!<br>  <br>  This is what you do;<br>  -sue the vet<br>  -with the money get a vet with 500+ training experience and make sure yer cat gets nerve repair!|`|6uDrv2aBaa	damn kid. i feel sorry for u<br>  when u declaw ur cats u only declaw the front nails not the back!<br>  <br>  dude the vet messed up ur cat.<br>  take it to the vet and demand for an answer! i would sue his *** etc..<br>  TAKE IT TO THE VET RIGHT NOW!!!|`|qibz72vyaa	you should not be allowed to own pets|`|9yyqW8Bbaa	Honey, it sounds like she's got an infection, like all the other people...or most...said take her to the vet, and demand, dont ask, demand an answer on why she's in pain.<br>  <br>  Oh nooo! Don't declaw the back ones!<br>  I'm sorry, I'm not against getting your cats declawed because I have 6 cats (two in which we have to find a home because we're moving), but all but three of those are declawed and we're getting the one we're keeping declawed, but only the front claws, it saves on your carpet and everything.<br>  But you're not supposed to declaw their back ones also, because if for some reason they would get outside and you couldn't catch them, they'd still have a little chance of defending themselves by using their back claws.<br>  <br>  But yes, def. take your kitty to the vet.|`|A7XV2K3Paa	I would take the cat to a different vet. With the condition that she is in after just coming home from the vet, I wouldn't trust this vet anymore. It sounds like she has some very serious isssues. A good vet should be able to get her back on track. Maybe some pain meds and antibodics or something, but she needs your help as soon as possible. Take her to a different vet - she should NOT be in this condition.<br>  <br>  I'm quite picky about my vet. If my cat doesn't like the vet or the standard of care is not what I feel my cat deserves, I go elsewhere just as you would with a human doctor.  If it were me, I would find a new vet.|`|hNSZlSMPaa	You should take the cat back to the vet and ask him/her what is going on. A lot of places will call you and see how your pet is getting along.  It sounds like someone messed up and big time.  This should not be happening as you well guessed. It is a blessing that whoever butchered your cat did not do her back claws. The claws are normally declawed to keep the cat from clawing up the furniture and they do not do that with their hind claws. They should make it right by your cat and they should not charge you for fixing their mistakes but they might try.  <br>  <br>  There is also the possibility that she picked up an infection while there.<br>  <br>  Good luck with her and I hope they make it right.<br>  <br>  Frank, get a life. The kid is looking for help not hatred.|`|OjXvYEZDaa	Why declawed your cat?!? they actually cut their toes off not just nails. Cats do need their claw for defend from anything dangerous. I have a cat who still have her claws I am not worried about my expenvise leather sofas because I have trained her to use scratch posters. No wonder why the vet messed up with your poor cat. You should tell vet what they have done the mess made cat even more suffering and ask them what they have done to this cat?? maybe you have good case to sue them for messing your cat... GO different VET!!!.. the cat is in seriously pains like she isn't supposed to be in.. How would u feel if your toes getting chopped off and left you in pains?!?! thats excalty how the cat feel right now, JUST TAKE HER VET NOW!!!!!!!!!!!!|`|e124e8765c4b0ed9c4d1ca5f0af5f848aa	What kind of fucken vet did you take her tooo???<br>  <br>  I wish I could cut his fingers and toes off!!!
gU34xa9vaa	PLEASE get your mom to read up more on declawing,it's very cruel and it's banned in 25 countries for good reason,as it's animal abuse ! More and more vets won't do this procedure now and more people are against it as they are finding out just how awful the operation is. Just today we've heard this from someone who works in a vet clinic ...show your mom this ...<br>  <br>  Today I was successful at talking another person into not declawing! I love when I can do that. I hate my job, my boss declaws, but at least I have the means to tell people about the horrors of it. I just told her to go to a few websites and really take a good look. Her poor kitty will bleed profusely, scream ( I am there when they wake up, it is horrible), the behavior problems, the pain, the refusal to walk, or ability not to walk right ever again. There is so much more.<br>  At least while I am stuck at this job for now, I can do my best to stop people from doing this, that is all that keeps me going sometimes. <br>  <br>  To put your cat through this again your mom is taking a very big risk, the cat could bleed to death,catch an infection, and more likely than not, will develop behavioural problems.In later life many declawed cats have problems with their backs because of the un-natural way they are forced to walk.<br>  To those who say front paws only is fine, NO IT IS NOT !!! To take any of the cats toes and claws from it is very wrong ! A cat needs its claws to live a fulfilled life as a cat !<br>  The vets who still do this thing, do it for the money, would you trust your cat to a person like that ? I certainly wouldn't.  <br>  To those saying the laser way of declawing is kinder, WRONG again, OK it might be less bloody and heal quicker but the cats toes have still gone, the pain is as bad and the cat is as crippled as by any other means of taking its rightful claws away.<br>  There is NO excuse to mutilate a cat, we in countries where declawing is banned just don't get a cat if we don't like it to have claws. But cats are the most popular pets in our country even so !!! <br>  You sound so very caring and really sensible, thank you for trying your best to stop your mom from doing this terrible thing !|`|Rw7gi86Naa	If you’re thinking about having your cat declawed, there are many things you should know before you make your decision.  The surgery is basically an American trend, and is considered inhumane and is illegal in many countries, (England, Scotland, Wales, Italy, France, Germany, Austria, Switzerland, Norway, Sweden, Netherlands, Northern Ireland, Ireland, Denmark, Finland, Slovenia, Portugal, Belgium, Brazil, Australia, New Zealand, Yugoslavia and Japan).  If that doesn’t impact your opinion about declawing, maybe this website will help you decide: <a href="http://community-2.webtv.net/stopdeclaw/declawpics/" rel="nofollow">http://community-2.webtv.net/stopdeclaw/...</a> <br>  <br>  I believe that people who have their cats declawed are uneducated.  It is not very difficult to train your cat to use a scratching post.  The surgery is not simply a trimming of the claws, it’s an amputation of the distal phalanx, including bones, ligaments, and tendons! To remove the claw, the bone, nerve, joint capsule, collateral ligaments, and the extensor and flexor tendons must all be amputated.  If you were to make a comparison, it would be like having the last joint of each of our fingers chopped off.  So of course it is a painful surgery, with a painful recovery.  There are often many complications in the healing process, including infection often from litter box use, resulting in a life-long aversion to the litter box.  Other declawed cats that can no longer mark with their claws, will mark with urine instead, resulting in inappropriate elimination problems.  <br>  <br>  Many cats who have been declawed are traumatized and become withdrawn, nervous, fearful and/or aggressive.  Cats who went through the painful surgery are more prone to resort to biting when they feel threatened.  Since cats have emotional feelings, (just like we do) they can resent you if you decided to get them declawed.  All of these things can cause depression and ultimately lead to an overweight cat.<br>  <br>  If a cat who has been declawed accidentally escapes, he/she would be in great danger.  A cat needs it's claws to defend itself, as well as to escape by climbing.  The constant state of stress, caused by a feeling of defenselessness may make some declawed cats more prone to disease.  Also they cannot stretch their back and shoulder muscles like they do naturally when they dig their claws into a scratching post.  <br>  <br>  One popular alternative is Soft Paws.  They are lightweight vinyl nail caps that you glue on the cat's front claws.  They're great for households with small children and are extremely useful for people who are away from home all day and can't exercise the watchfulness necessary to train a cat to use a scratching post.  Soft Paws are easy to apply and last about four to six weeks.  They come in clear or colors--which are really fun.<br>  <br>  Most common types of damage are scratched furniture, ripped carpets and shredded wallpaper.  You want to eliminate the problem before it occurs.  Buy or build a stable, tall scratching-post, right from the start.  Here are some tips to do it right: If your cat is scratching your furniture or rugs, here is some advice on training them to use a scratching post:<br>   The post should be at least two feet high, covered with sisal-rope <br>   Get more than one, especially when you have a multi-cat household <br>   Place the post close to the furniture or other areas which are most at risk <br>   Introduce a new scratching-post with some catnip sprinkled on its surface.  Cats love that and it’s more attractive to them <br>   If your cat starts scratching the "wrong" object, say "NO" and gently carry your cat to the desired post.  Demonstrate how to use it by scratching the post with your own nails.  If the cat doesn‘t catch on after trying this repeatedly for a few days, gently pick up his paws rub them along the post.<br>   Never force your cat.  When it starts scratching the post by itself, make sure you use verbal praise with a rewarding treat and affection.  The cat needs to know that using the scratching post results in positive things such as affection, playing and treats.<br>   When you have a kitten, start early with the "pawing at post" technique <br>   Invest in what’s called a “cat tree” which acts also as a leisure area for your cat.  Different textures and heights make it more interesting, you perhaps want to build it yourself <br>   Try some repellent like pepper-dust or some commercial products on your furniture to keep your cat off these areas<br>   Be persistent and don't give up too soon<br>  <br>  Use cat claw trimmers and only take off a tiny bit at the end of the nail. Some people say to do it every other week. I think it‘s safer to cut off less than you are told, and to do it more often, (like once a week). Never use trimmers that are made for humans or dogs, because you are more likely to hurt her that way. You can ask your vet or groomer to show you the proper way to do it. Here's a website that shows you how:  <br>  <a href="http://www.catscratching.com/htmls/article.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.catscratching.com/htmls/artic...</a>|`|hhEb9fhXaa	oh you poor sole you gotta stop mommy from doing any more badness to your cat - if you have to beg get down on your knees and do it gal cos that cat needs you more than ever - why your mom taking cat back again seems like pilin on the agony and i mean that most sincerely folks i really do - show mom all the answers from peeps who have told it like it is and get mom to look at the sites and pictures - if you can get this stopped you on the right track to being animal saveyer for rest of your life|`|huEWXxmLaa	No I don't like it, in fact I HATE it.

I wonder if your mom really does totally understand the extent of the surgery. Back claws are extremely important for cats to be able to cliimb and for balance, and since it is too late to do anything about the front claws, which is really so very sad, perhaps the first line of "education" is to talk to her about the surgery and what it really is.<br>  <br>  You have some fantastic answers from cat lovers who feel your plight, and most importantly the plight of your cat.<br>  <br>  We adopted a cat years ago, who since has passed, who was declawed in front. She was the sweetest cat but due to the surgery and her emotional stress, she had developed a habit of chewing on lampshades, window shades, and anything else she could get her teeth onto.  She was very skitterish as well.  So there were little teeth marks in all of our things scattered throughout the house. Cats who have been declawed often become neurotic. <br>  <br>  It is no big deal to clip claws. Cats don't scratch furniture with hind claws, so there is no reason under the sun for her to want to do this. <br>  <br>  The thought of declawing a cat sends shivers down my spine. Not only the dreadful pain from the surgery, but taking away what God gave the cat to protect themselves and to keep themselves safe, and to be able to stretch their muscles correctly, just makes me see red.  <br>  <br>  One of these days soon, hopefully, the US will join the other 23 countries and ban this hideous and cruel practice. There is no reason to do it at all. If furniture and carpets are so important to people, methinks that a dog is a better pet for them. Why get a cat in the first place?<br>  <br>  I wish you all the best.  Your mom should be ashamed of setting this kind of example for her child which in many of our opinions is  considered cruelty to animals.<br>  <br>  Good luck! You have lots of great answers to use in your argument. I so feel for you.<br>  <br>  Troublesniffer<br>  Owned by cats for over 40 years<br>  Wish I had a penny for every nail I have trimmed over those years! <g>|`|uBFhKXgHaa	It's disgusting and cruel enough that your cats were subjected to having parts of their /front/ toes amputated, now your mom wants to cut off parts of their back ones? <br>  <br>  Declawing is not a simple removal of the claws but a full blown amputation of healthy toes. Declawing a cat means removing the entire first joint/bone of each toe. It'd be like cutting our fingers off at the first knuckle. Declawing causes extreme pain to the cat and often problems down the line (litter box issues from associating the litter box with pain after surgery, personality changes/biting/and skittishness from having their first line of defense removed, arthritis from having to learn a new way of carrying their weight etc.).

7OHbWOjaaa	I'm having a similar problem with my dog we got a new puppy and my baby just seems depressed. I try to spend a lot of quality time with him, let him lay with me in bed, take him for walks one on one, and make sure he knows I see him individually. Maybe you and your german shepherd could start a new weekly "date"? Go to a dog park with him, or take him for a really long walk some place he doesn't get to see often (hiking trail, park, ect.) I don't know if dogs really think this way, but I always feel like mine want me to acknowledge them as the COMPLETE focus of part of my day, even if its just for a little while.|`|4KtPFzz5aa	No doubt your dog is scared & confused.

0GTwQS7Oaa	From the other answers you will have realised the vet is needed. It's unlikely your sister can home treat whatever is causing this. So the big problem now is how to afford the vet. <br>  <br>  1. Depending on which country you live, there may be financial assistance available - USA has many different types. <br>  <br>  2. Contact all of the local animal welfare/animal rescue organisations and see if they can help. <br>  <br>  3. Sometimes there are animal hospitals/ vets that are actually set up to help low income pet owners. <br>  <br>  4. Contact all your local vets and ask them if they have any way you can pay for treatment over a period. Some vets are linked to organisations that will cover the loan.<br>  <br>  This sounds like it might be a disease of a major organ of the body, but could turn out to be easily treatable. Please get the cat to a vet as it may (probably is) in pain.|`|OjXvYEZDaa	You gotta take the cat to vet!

a2cjwMKcaa	Heavily stocked, but what are your water readings?<br>  <br>  If the ammonia is zero, the nitrate is low and the fish are healthy then you are not overstocked. Those are the things that determine if the tank is running properly, or overstocked, not measuring the fish with a ruler and applying some random 'rule'<br>  <br>  Ian|`|u61yKsE3aa	It seems a little over stocked to me.  I would upgrade to a bigger tank.  The rule of thumb is 1 gallon of water for every inch of fish.You've got 27 fish and some of them get larger than an inch.  For now I would watch them as long as the tank is clean, water quality great, and no one is showing signs of stress than your ok ay for now, but I would work on upgrading.|`|zqVDJxUIaa	Since you have good filtration, you should be okay, as long as those platys and guppies don't reproduce... Make sure your tank is well-oxygenated. You have lots of plants, so I'd say you would be fine.

I'm not against using a harsh bit, but I am against inexperienced or misinformed riders using such a bit for a "quick fix" when the problem is often with the training or the rider, not the horse. Assuming that you need a twisted wire bit on a horse you don't really know is not a good idea. Generally, if you're trying a new horse, it's best to start with a mild bit and go from there. It may be that the horse prefers/needs a stronger bit (though I doubt a twisted wire is really necesary), but the horse could be just fine in a plain snaffle. Same goes for the martingale--not every horse needs a martingale, and using one just to fix a problem that you could address with training will not help matters. A martingale should be used as a training aid in experienced hands, not as a replacement for training. <br>  <br>  Other than your list, don't forget basic first aid/veterinary supplies (contact your vet for complete recommendations), buckets/hay nets or bags/etc., grooming and wash equipment, extras of everything (not a good idea to have one halter and no backups--what if it breaks?), wraps/boots/bandages if necessary, riding equipment, and plenty more. <br>  <br>  The trainer/lessons would definitely be a good place to start.|`|5rEWdAuxaa	Well, here I go...<br>  -Saddle that fits correctly and suits your preferred discipline. <br>  - Bridle that fits correctly and suits the horse.<br>  -A gentler bit unless the horse needs a twisted wire bit. <br>  -Saddle pads/cloths in right size, strongly suggest 2.<br>  -Only get a martingale if the horse needs one.<br>  -Girth and stirrups that suit saddle<br>  -Reins that suit bridle and horse.<br>  -Grooming kit including: body brush, curry comb, dandy brush, hoof pick, mane brush, sweat scraper, leather cleaner, hoof oil, bandages, first aid kit etc.<br>  -Rugs: Depending on the weather at the moment, you should get a fly sheet, cotton summer rug and a waterproof rug. <br>  -Feed bins are essential and a few is a good idea.<br>  -Worm paste, although could be included in first aid kit. <br>  -Float boots if you need to travel.<br>  -Feed scoops are handy to dish out feed. <br>  - Quality fly mask with fly spray( also could be in first aid kit or grooming box).<br>  - Organise a permanent farrier.<br>  -Organise a permanent vet.<br>  -Organise where to buy feed and hay, and make orders on a monthly basis or whenever you think you will run out.<br>  -If you plan to show get good tack, and some jumping boots etc. <br>  -You will need helemt, jodphurs, boots, riding attire(clothes), showing clothes if you want to show.<br>  Hope this helps.|`|TTLIp8Beaa	i don't think you should get a twisted wire bit. they are often very harsh and unless a horse absolutely requires one then i think it is unnecessary. the same goes for a martingale, if you don't need it, don't use it.<br>  you will also need a horsey first aid kit, a place for all your tack, boots for your horse, (depending on your discipline) and a girth.<br>  also, if your boarding stable doesn't provide feed/buckets then you'll need to buy those. it's also important to get to know several vets and farriers BEFORE you buy your horse. that way you can pick the one you think is best suited for you and your horse, and you're not rushing to find one after you've purchased.|`|4884c661c8938910239d7729a16fc338aa	Here is my list:<br>  <br>  Grooming Box<br>  Metal Curry Comb <br>  Rubber Curry Comb<br>  Plastic Curry Comb<br>  Scissors<br>  Hoof-pick<br>  Sponges (3: 1 for face, 1 for body, 1 for rump/tail)<br>  Brush<br>  Comb (mane and tail)<br>  Clippers<br>  Dandy Brush (hard brush)<br>  Body Brush<br>  Soft Brush<br>  Shampoo<br>  Hoof Dressing<br>  Cut Ointment<br>  Fly Spray<br>  De-Wormer<br>  Standing Bandages<br>  Polo Wraps<br>  Vet Wrap (Stretchy Band-aids)<br>  Fly Mask<br>  Blankets (Heavy/Medium/Light<br>  Cooler<br>  Halter (I would have 2 or 3 so you have back up if they break)<br>  Lead-rope (once again I would get 2 or 3)<br>  Treats<br>  Saddle<br>  Bridle<br>  Reins (buy an extra set)<br>  Others ( martingale, breastplate etc, depending on the horse)<br>  Helmet<br>  Gloves <br>  Crops (s)<br>  Spurs<br>  Boots (for you)<br>  Lunge-line<br>  Lunge Whip<br>  Dressage<br>  Splint Boots<br>  Bell Boots<br>  Travel Wraps <br>  Travel Head Cap<br>  Hay Net<br>  Jumping Safety Vest<br>  <br>  This list has a lot of thing that not everyone would need: Dressage whip, safety vest etc. Take off what you won't need.|`|F1j74WMkaa	You cant really buy a bit for a horse until you know what it is already ridden in, i would never ride in a twisted wire bit, i have 3 horses, all are ridden in different bits, however i prefer to get them into a snaffle bit when i can as this is a lot nicer for the horses mouth.<br>  <br>  You will need rugs ans summer sheets for it, unless the horse is coming with him/her|`|KiGnomhZaa	a stable and a field and food and brushes|`|sKZbK6Y5aa	yeah you need to get a different bit.  twisted wire bit??? what are you trying to stop--- a train??|`|2nsNvIanaa	helmut,|`|o4R0vydVaa	First of all, I don't know why you would need a twisted wire bit, unless you were incredibly experienced and training a crazy stallion or something. But if you are asking about what you need, then you are probably not someone who is training a crazy wild stallion so I don't think you need one... But also, you have to make sure the saddle fits the horse CORRECTLY or he will get a very sore back and be on stall rest for a long time. I learned from experience... :\ There are many different websites for buying your first horse that you might want to check out... Good luck!!!|`|CBrsrL5vaa	You really need  hard brush (body), soft brush(face/legs), and medium brush (legs), curry comb (removes loose dust and extra fur, prevents saddle sore), hoof pick I recomend the ones with a brush on the other side), shampoo, conditioner, mane and tail brush and comb.  I suggest you get a lighter bit unless your horse REALLY needs this bit.  You also should get saddle oil and sponges. <br>  <br>   Good luck and I hope you enjoy your new horse:)|`|sGs9Ufbtaa	fly sheet if u want one<br>  swat <br>  emergencie suplies for cuts<br>  SMB's <br>  if ur not boarding him grain i recomend triple crown complete<br>  hay <br>  heated water bucket for winter <br>  treats<br>  if u ride western u need a breast coller and the SMB's but if u ride english i would use polo wraps <br>  i also have perelli halters i luv clinton anderson <br>  good luck owning a horse has tought me so much responsibility and bought me so much adventrues and ive met alot of great ppl enjoy!!|`|6QJkwc28aa	Well, you need brushes and a hoof pick.

7fVr3q0kaa	Believe it or not, it's not harmful for cats to eat grass!<br>  <br>  As long as your lawn doesn't have pesticides or toxins added to it, the grass-eating is just fine. Some cats eat grass because it helps them throw up hairballs. Others do it to aid with digestion. Pet supply stores actually sell little containers of wheat grass for cats :)<br>  <br>  Since you know where this cat's owners live, and that it has a regular source of food, I would not feed the cat again. It will never stop pestering you for food once it's identified you as a source, and the cat's human family might not appreciate it.<br>  <br>  Hope that helps!<br>  <br>  -KittyMamma<br>  <a href="http://KittyMamma.blogspot.com" rel="nofollow">http://KittyMamma.blogspot.com</a>|`|eWn6Dr3uaa	dont worry i believe you..<br>  the cat won't leave until you keep feeding it milk.<br>  Trust me.

I think it has something to do with they see the feather and think it looks like a fun toy so they pluck it off<br>   just a word of advice, usually birds who pluck their mate's feathers will end up plucking their baby's feathers so you probably should never breed that female... it's also a genetic thing, if the parent plucks a baby then a baby will more than likely pluck it's baby's feathers.<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  and the thing that Vee said about it being a natural thing is irrelevant because it's not a good thing and they aren't plucking each others feathers in that video she showed, their running oil through them by preening, not plucking... and preening is normal|`|9e4cc937385b500f07dcfe521561dfc1aa	They are grooming each other.

I used to have 2 pygmy goats and 6 rabbits on in an acre pen and they were fine.  My seventh rabbit could not go with them because she was too territorial and faought with everyone ( rabbits and even chased the goats) you will have to watch and see and if there are any signs of aggression seperate them
AA11927520	Most of what I am going to say has already been mentioned.<br>  <br>  First off if there is no male mate then the eggs are not fertile.<br>  No Daddy  = no baby chicks!<br>  <br>  Secondly, usually when breeding and especially before eggs start splatting the pair should be put in a smaller cage with a nest-box.<br>  The smaller cage should be much shorter in height then a normal Cockatiel cage. Like not much more then double or triple the Average Cockatiel's height. In my opinion the lower the better as long as it is high enough to be able to have a perch 2 or 3 inches above the bottom of the cage.<br>  <br>  You can find nest-boxes at most pet shops and they can usually guide you to the right size.  A nest-box bigger then you need is better one one too small.  Now the Nest-box does not have to be gigantic but if it is too small your mating pair will not use it.  I have read of people who have had their Cockatiels lay eggs in plastic bins, small trash pails, at the bottom of growing houseplats etc.<br>  <br>  We use regular wooden nest-boxes and we noticed our Cockatiels do not like closed nest boxes.  I guess most Cockatiels  do not mind climbing through that hole but ours do.<br>  <br>  Either we have to lay the nest-box on it's side with the hinged roof laying flat, like a porch to the nest-box or we have to arrange the nest-box so that a perch or clothespins are holding the hinged roof open enough for the parent Tiels to climb in and out that way. (our Cockatiels do not like the hole the nest-box comes with).<br>  <br>  Also make sure you have material like <br>  corn-cob litter, and/or<br>  pine shavings and/or <br>  shredded paper (not shiny paper)<br>  for nesting litter in the nest-box.<br>  <br>  The OC blog - The Our Cockatiels Blog<br>  <a href="http://ourcockatielsblog.blogspot.com/" rel="nofollow">http://ourcockatielsblog.blogspot.com/</a><br>  <br>  The OC Club - Our Cockatiels Club<br>  <a href="http://pets.groups.yahoo.com/group/OC_OurCockatiels/">http://pets.groups.yahoo.com/group/OC_Ou...</a>|`|LbGRsCTKaa	Do you have a male cockatiel in the cage with your female?   If not, the eggs will not hatch because they won't be fertile.|`|AA11597359	ok, when it's around time for her to lay her eggs make sure she has materials to make a nest and all that, put her in a shorter cage, heavily pad the bottom, have an incubator ready just in case.<br>  <br>  Really It's about making her comfortable make sure she had the proper time and materials to nest and make sure her cage is clean and keep her out of any stressful situations.|`|fVimGtmpaa	i dont know what to tell you but you should go to the vet and ask about this. something like that happened to my lovebirds. thats the best i can give you. the vets know all. if they charge you, walk out... try going on google! lol... hm... also try to put the nest on the FLOOR! maybe that way she wont be able to drop them! unless she grabbed the eggs climbed up then dropped them, then i dont know what to say! try an inquebater! or put the eggs with like a foster mom or something.|`|qHDmcmRAaa	your cockatiel has more experience with laying eggs and will probably not drop them again. so you don't have to worry.|`|dlOiB0cyaa	Did she have a good sized nesting box, stuffing for the box, and a male bird?|`|Wx2Fl0xQaa	First do you have a male in the cage with her? Without a male the eggs are no good. These birds love us so much they will use us as their partner. This is why they will lay eggs without a male present. Besides the fact thats what they do. <br>  If you have a male, put in a nesting box. You can buy one at the pet store for about 20$. The way I fix my nesting box is I first put a cut up sweat shirt in the bottom then fold several layers of paper towels on top of that. The male and female will go into the box and chew on the paper towels till it is to their liking. <br>  Make sure you provide them with plenty of fresh water, food, and cutter bone. The female will need this as she uses her supply of calcium to make eggs. Providing her with a cutter bone will replenish the much needed calcium she will need. <br>  Elmer's Glue will work on a cracked egg. However depending on how much you use make sure the baby will manage to get through when it is ready to chip his way out. Large cracks where some of the liquid has come out won't help. The egg is too damaged. Bury that baby. I still can't bring myself to just discard them like trash. I always bury the eggs that didn't make it.<br>  And read read read all there is about raising cockatiels. The more you read and educate yourself the more you will find out you still don't know everything. <br>  I have one baby now that the parents walked away from cause he was hatched a week after the first three. We put the baby in the brooder to find out his crop wouldn't empty. He had sour crop by this time. Now all the reading I've done tells me not to feed food ontop of the sour crop. To keep the humity high and maybe the baby will make it. Well I'm stubburn. I did put about .03 cc's of very watery food in the baby. After feeding him I took a Qtip and rubbed his crop mixing the new with the old. I did not want him to starve to death. I brought the humity up to 50-60% and give him Bene-Bac , this you can get at pet stores too, every 3 hours this was done. Now he is two days old. His crop is working but only by the grace of God giving us the strength and will power not to give up. <br>  Raising these babies is not a easy task. Please research everything there is to know. There will be losses no matter what you do. It hurts and there is much saddnes. Many tears I have shed. <br>  Good Luck Dear. Make sure this is something you want to do.

H06PtiIAaa	the first thing is corals and reefs are the hardest setup as corals need proper levels of water parameters like calcum, magnisum, strontium, iodine etc.. so they need to be in an established tank and best waited until you know more about saltwater.<br>  <br>  To mix saltwater, what you need to do is add salt mix to freshwater or RO water. Then use the hydrometer to measure the salinity, it should be around 32 PPT or 1.020 on the specific gravity. <br>  <br>  You want to get around 1 pound of live sand and 1 pound of live rock per gallon, the  cheapest thing is to get a mixture of live rock and base rock, that way it isnt that expensive.<br>  <br>  <br>  Snow flake eels are best in 75 gallons. the dwarf angel will be fine in the 55 gallon. <br>  <br>  As far as corals, again an established tank and you will need an upgraded lighting system. power compacts at least or T5 to metal halide lighting.|`|J1Gfjcvuaa	okay first thing first, you buy salt, a salt tester, and you put your decarations, and rocks in your tank, then you add fresh water, and then put salt in it you have to buy ...

I don't know where you should get corals. Its hard to to get them healthy ive found at least online, maybe u'll have better luck than me but for sand or rock, www.aquariumsands.com is up there i'd say. Take Care & Good Luck !
7fVr3q0kaa	Before you make the decision to buy a purebred, consider this:<br>  <br>  Purebreds are bred by mating cats of the same breed together, often family members. After a while, the gene pool becomes corrupted, and a pattern of health problems surface. Do some internet research about purebreds and their common health problems...you'll find that one breed is known for this set of health problems, and that breed is known for that set, etc.<br>  <br>  It sounds crazy, but mixes or "muts" are in fact the most healthy...they are a combination of many different breeds, and so usually have fewer health problems and often live longer.<br>  <br>  I really do encourage you to get your kitty from a Humane Society or other shelter, and chances are you might even find a purebred there. It's a LOT less expensive, and they come already vaccinated and spayed/neutered.<br>  <br>  Good luck!<br>  <br>  -KittyMamma<br>  <a href="http://KittyMamma.blogspot.com" rel="nofollow">http://KittyMamma.blogspot.com</a>|`|e124e8765c4b0ed9c4d1ca5f0af5f848aa	This one!!<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.catster.com/cats/959598" rel="nofollow">http://www.catster.com/cats/959598</a><br>  <br>  blue tabby cats are beautiful and friendly!|`|pumHqbjiaa	I find the really ordinary, normal mixed breeds the best. I have one, he's gray with white socks. Adorable.<br>  <br>  =]|`|6xf1GfbUaa	You should go to a shelter and see the cats and choose one based on how it interacts with you and their personality. Even the most mellow pure breed can have kittens that grow up to be very naughty and mean. But, generally speaking, Ragdoll Cats are known to be very mellow and playful at the same time and extremely LOVING. I have 4 and they're amazing. Another breed that I have recently fallen in love with is British Short Hair. Omg! You have to see them, they're amazingly beautiful! They're also known to be laid-back and loving. Good luck on your search. First thing you need to do, is go to an animal shelter and I'm sure you WILL fall in love with one or even two kittens. Plus, you'll be saving their lives by adopting them ?|`|sayfQB2aaa	Ok, there is no best breed of cats it depends on what you want. Firstly I recommend a moggie from a shelter your saving a life and there just so helpless and lovable but if you really want a pure bred thats ok. Do you want long hair or short hair or even no hair. Do you want boisterous or quiet. loud or soft. big or small. if you answers those questions i can make suggestions.|`|cqLYkuz8aa	In my opinion the best cat is a domestic short hair, they come in all different colors and patterns and make amazing pets.<br>  <br>  <br>  BTW domestic short hairs are the cat equivalent of a mutt|`|UdTFJuPpaa	Each breed has its own particular attributes and features. It all depends on what you want. She are less active, some are more active, some require daily grooming, some require almost no grooming. Some are super-affectionate and clingy, others are more companiable. Some are better with children etc etc. <br>  <br>  You can't just ask what is a good breed to get because that question can only be answered with another question: a good breed for who? What are the circumstances and preferences of the potential owner?<br>  <br>  A quiet person or couple with plenty of time for grooming might like to have a Persian, while a busy family household might prefer a pair of Burmese or Bengals.<br>  <br>  You need to research the different breeds before you can decide.<br>  <br>  If you want to avoid a cat with inbreeding in its pedigree ask to see the pedigree, ask for the co-efficient of inbreeding, or select one of the many breeds with approved outcross programmes. There are a small number of breeds where hereditary health problems have been identified and for all of these you will find that breeders are working hard to eliminate the problems. If you are interested in one of these breeds ask if there is a test for the problem and if the parents have been tested. For e4xample, if you want a Persian buy one that has been tested negative for PKD. The breed clubs are your best source of information and reputable breeders when you have chosen your breed.|`|tGTvLTdBaa	I suggest the more "mutt" breeds as well.

I am so sorry. This makes me not want to find a new groomer for my kitty (he gets mats too).<br>  <br>  NO professional groomer should ever have to shave the WHOLE cat. Some people do it because it's easier but it's not necessary. I just moved so I was looking to find a new groomer but the one in my hometown I was going to I would stay while she groomed my cat. Made me feel better to stay and it helped her because I would hold him.<br>  <br>  I've never been more serious in saying this: 1. You should call the "better business bureau" and advise them of the situation. 2. File in small claims court to get your money reimbursed.<br>  <br>  TAKE PICTURES of your cat.. right now!

When a persian (or any other long haired cat) becomes matted, they mat clear down to the skin.  I'm sure that's why they took all her fur, but razor burns?  There is no excuse for shaving her that close.  I'm sure they pulled her skin quite a bit--especially back by her fanny, if she is so "touchy" there now.  I agree with the person who says to take pictures.  <br>  <br>  I have had my vet tranquilize pets (I foster and rescue many cats) who need close-up work done in order to spare them the pain and trauma your kitty went through.<br>  <br>  Must have gotten her back claws into the groomer if she scratched her...but my declawed tom can still leave marks with his front feet, but not true scratches.  <br>  <br>  It is absolutely unjustifiable that these people would charge you after what happened to your kitty.  I would make sure others with pets avoided this groomer in the future.
QV2WQsd8aa	It is something that should be checked by your vet.  When you take her in, they will aspirate it and possibly take a sample for a biopsy and suggest having it removed.

What I think is that  you might have fed it some or if not alot of human food. in the past. The reason dogs(or other animals) cannot eat human food is because animals have a way differant digestive system then humans. Even though they might look like they like it its bad for their stomach. They dont know better. And the part you said about it probaly wont hurt seems right. Because it usually wont to a dog. A dog can tough pain out until a certain point just like us. So mabey your dog has a higher pain threshold and can take more pain then a normal dog (especially if its a pug)SO HERE IS WHAT TO DO because i havent said yet, your dog may need its stomach pumped depending on its severity so take it to the vet. its nothing to be worried about as long as you get it fixed soon. so i hope this helps because sometimes it can be scary.

These movies are deeply embedded in the Aussie culture.|`|3BMBZtDxaa	Koda!<br>  <br>  Zeus is too common, and Wolf just doesn't seem to fit an Australian Cattle Dog.<br>  <br>  I don't think Koda sounds too feminine, it sounds cute for a boy. Although we had a cat named "Dakota" and we called her "Kota" for short, but I think Koda with the "D" sound to it sounds like a very cute Australian Cattle Dog male name!<br>  <br>  Go with Koda!|`|Rva0ocMOaa	I think Wolf is really cute. Koda is cute too, though it reminds me of the bear cub in the movie Brother Bear. Zeus is pretty common.|`|6SeWCfUfaa	I like Koda too ...|`|qqUvoC5uaa	I'd go for Koda. Doesn't sound feminine to me.

hetZz4c1aa	Your cat may be ill or perhaps needs to be spayed. Improper elimination is often a symptom of a medical problem. Usually it's a urinary infection and easily treated, but PAINFUL. So off to the vet!<br>  <br>  Litter box problems are very frustrating for all.....human and feline.

I had to buy another litter box and he has stopped doing it.|`|e124e8765c4b0ed9c4d1ca5f0af5f848aa	Get Cat attract kitty litter!!!<br>  <br>  that is the best soloution to the problem!|`|Rw7gi86Naa	Here are some suggestions to your litter box problems:<br>  - Provide a box for each cat <br>  - Provide constant access to a box <br>  - Go back to previously used brand of litter and/or <br>  - Discontinue new disinfectant <br>  - Move box to where it was previously used <br>  - Eliminate new or frightening noise near litter box <br>  - Move food and water away from litter box <br>  - If cat is only going in one spot, put the litter box at the exact location and gradually move it back to where you want it at the rate of one foot per day <br>  - If there are several places, try putting dishes of cat food in those areas to discourage further elimination there <br>  - Experiment with different textures of litter, (cats prefer sandy litter) <br>  - Use a covered litter box for cats that stand in box but eliminate outside of it <br>  - Keep in mind that some cats are rather picky, and prefer to have two separate boxes, (one to pee in and one to poop in).<br>  <br>  Problems arise when your cat doesn't like or develops an aversion to the litter box that you have provided. There is absolutely no reason to expect every cat to like the same material, or even for one cat to prefer the same material over an entire life span. If your cat is having litter box problems then you will need to figure out how to make the litter box appealing to the cat. Here are a few options: <br>  1) Pain or illness can cause a cat to stop using the litter box. Cats are very adept at hiding illness, so if your cat is having litter box problems then the first thing you need to do is take the cat to a vet for a medical exam. <br>  2) If you aren't scooping the waste out of the litter every day then you need to start and start now. <br>  3) Perfumes or other odors can drive your cat away from the litter box. Scented litters are unacceptable to many cats, and the leftover scent from a cleaning product could also be a problem. Get rid of the perfumes, and scrub those cleaners away before giving the box back to the cat. Remember that cats have an acute sense of smell. <br>  4) Your cat may feel vulnerable when in the litter box. Is it in a noisy location, (such as next to the washing machine). Is it secure from little marauders like dogs and children, or even other cats? If the box is not semi-private, move it to a better location.<br>  5) Remember those preferences that we talked about earlier. You may need to offer several different types of litter before finding the right one. Strange but true, some cats will not use the same box for urine and feces, in which case you'll have to provide two boxes. The type of box could also be a problem. If the box has a cover, try removing it. <br>  6) Anxiety can lead to litter box lapses. Did some event scare your cat? This could be anything from a new couch to a new cat or even a new person in the house. If you suspect anxiety, confine the cat to a safe and secure place, (maybe a bed room) until the anxiety has passed. Cats seem to hang on to their emotions, so the anxiety could last much longer than the actual event. No need to rush, leave that safe haven available to the cat for as long as possible. <br>  7) If you have multiple cats, chances are you'll need multiple boxes, maybe even with different materials in them. <br>  There is one more important distinction that you'll need to make. Is the cat refusing to use the litter box, or is the cat spraying? Spraying is a territorial behavior and has nothing to do with disliking the box. For more information on litter box problems or spraying, consult with a trained behaviorist.<br>  <br>  Correcting the Problem <br>  The key to solving elimination problems is to make the litter box more attractive, and the area where the cat is soiling instead, unattractive. Sometimes, just cleaning the litter box more frequently or changing its location will correct the problem. Other times, you may need to experiment with different combinations of location and kitty litter to find a solution. You may even want to offer your cat the choice of several different boxes, each with different kinds of litter, to see which he or she prefers. At the same time, you must break the cat's habit of soiling in the new location. Be sure to clean the soiled area thoroughly with a pet odor remover to get rid of any urine scent -- or your cat may be attracted back to the same spot. It's important to keep the cat away from the area. Try covering the spot with carpet runner, prickly side up, or use a device that delivers a harmless static shock or that produces a loud noise when the cat comes near, to help redirect kitty to his litter box. Adding a room deodorizer with a scent the cat finds offensive - such as a strong citrus or floral - can also keep the cat away from the area. <br>  <br>  When to See the Vet <br>  If your cat continues to eliminate outside of the litter box, a trip to the vet is in order to check for health problems. No behavior techniques will help a cat with a problem that requires the attention of a veterinarian. <br>  Urinary tract infections are a common cause of litter box probl
P8hOtEdOaa	Exotic wildlife as pets fall under Title 58, Part III, Chapter 147, Subchapter N of the PA code.<br>  <br>  First you will need an exotic wildlife possession permit from the PA game commission.  They require you to have 2 years of hands on experience from an approved facility and have the proper caging.  For a tiger you will need a 15' L x 10' W x 8' H cage with a top and two claw logs and a shelf.  You will also need a bill of sale showing where you got the tiger from.  <br>  <br>  The Federal Captive Wildlife Safety Act passed in 2003 banned big cats such as tigers from crossing state lines for the pet trade.  You will need to find a breeder in your state.|`|nuTvB84Gaa	It's not a good idea to own a tiger.<br>  They often and usually go bad after having them even if you've had them since birth or infancy.<br>  <br>  But I believe you can get a wildlife refuge permit.<br>  But they don't like people to keep wildlife captive.<br>  <br>  hope i helped :)|`|AA11597359	you have to get a special license it's like getting a zoo license, you have to pay, you have to prve that you have the right facility to keep it, and it is illegal with out the permit. <br>  <br>  Also your lookin at thousands of dollars to but the tiger thousand more to transport it and thousands more to feed it, there the biggest cats there really really really huge.<br>  <br>  Also you'll most likley get malled.|`|AXgEyWTpaa	O GAHHHODDD RANDY WTF ARE U TINKING LOL
6hvf02Eyaa	Rule out a urinary infection as mentioned. secondly do not put dogs together as they could fight  until you are sure it is safe. Is the other dog fixed? And Is your older dog showing signs of aggression? I would check some of that out and use a cleaner with enzymes from a pet store for cleaning up, then always of course tell him 'NO" and take him outside or put in sit stay position for a few like a time out so he learns his behavior is not acceptable.|`|1a28ef0304d145d0c1edec369cd24d62aa	Take him to the Vet first to rule out Urinary Tract Infection first.|`|nd30LQhlaa	well if you get a kennal you should get two...it could be dangerouse putting them together...and as for the one dog peeing everywhere it would stop if you neutered him(Im not saying you have too) or Im sure there could be someway to train him.

56a572fde5f78c1444702e92a41b54faaa	Okay, I see someone has already given you the correct answer, but I'm going to put my two cents in anyway.<br>  <br>  Your kitty is suffering from dry, itchy skin.  You are seeing the flaky results of it. <br>  <br>  Easy fix (vet recommended, BTW) is one capsule of fish oil daily.  Pop it open and put on kitty's food.  You will see the beautiful, shiny-coated results in only a few days.<br>  <br>  If you get it on your hands it will stink to high heaven, but is safe for you and your cat.<br>  <br>  Warning:  do not use with soft food or your cat will have diarrhea!!!|`|SplyB8F4aa	cats get dry skin, just like we do. common causes are shampooing (don't use people shampoo, use one that is hypoallergenic/soap free and doesn't have a heavy perfume), and the fact that with the cold weather a lot of us are cranking up the heat in our homes, which can be very drying. also, a good quality cat food like eukanuba, royal canin or science diet helps.|`|9yyqW8Bbaa	Yes!

Os6VjLH0aa	TAKE HIM TO THE VET! <br>  Jeez!!!!|`|44kEtDvIaa	This is a common problem with this breed.  No easy answer to this one and you will have to visit the vet.|`|ydshiNrKaa	Taking him to the vet would be an excellent idea. The dog probably has back problems or with the discs. she is probably in a lot of pain so as quickly as you can get the dog to a vet the better for the dog.|`|49ec8e0944023c0f5c20e37484f16366aa	If he has a ruptured disc, the sooner you get him into the vet, the better.  Swelling of the ruptured disc causes pressure on the spine and results in neurological problems like paralysis.  Your vet can get him started on anti-inflammatory medication that shrinks the swelling.  If you wait too long, that swelling causes permanent damage.  Good luck.|`|KxjUim7yaa	Contact the vet immediately. If you want him to every walk again without expensive surgery, you need to take care of this now.|`|GaL66jbQaa	take him to the vet he may have a ruptured disk it's pretty common in the breed.|`|UaVaN8i5aa	Please take him to the vet as soon as possible! the same thing happened to my chiuaua 4 days ago, it was a ruptured disc. is your dog able to pee? because, it affected his bladder so he was unable to pee. very painful! just do something fast. the very best of luck to you and your sweet dog!|`|XNxFBrbAaa	well obviously you need to take him to the vet....thats not even a question....but i do know of cases where when a dog gets ticks...thre bite has somthin it it that can cause them to be temporarily paralyzed if not treated.....so thats somthin to look into..but your dog needs to see a vet.|`|Yyv4WQLiaa	take him to vet, and also discourage him from moving around, it may be fixable it may not be they will have to do some tests|`|rMw2RhBDaa	ummm.....vet|`|EIBktpPgaa	go to the vet, no way to avoid it :(
PoWzgvBTaa	If you're concerned that something is wrong with him, just to be safe I would keep him away from your other pets if you have any if at all possible - just to avoid any transfer if it is something serious. Watch his eating habits, how much he sleeps, if his grooming habits, and anything he "passes". These may sound a little out there, but it could help you determine if something is wrong. If you notice anything out of his routine, or that seems odd, it's better to be safe than sorry; get him checked out by a veterinarian.<br>  <br>  I hope I helped and he gets better soon! :)|`|xSNpSlE7aa	As everyone else said, take him in to the vet ASAP.<br>  <br>  I read about a cat whose 3rd eyelid got paralyzed.|`|4yt4D3vMaa	The third eyelid is white, not see through-you need to get your cat to a vet and find out what's going on, it could be serious.It sounds very odd whatever it is!|`|MQVmh5hiaa	You should go see a vet it might not be hurting his eyes now but it will if you don't get it check-in out.|`|SplyB8F4aa	definitely get kitty to the vet. sounds like a proble with the nictating eyelid. not sure if they can fix it or not, but should definitely be looked at.|`|hetZz4c1aa	Your cat needs to see a vet as soon as possible.....no excuses!

6cbce34f6d81808399f7101c75d8526baa	Yeah, get him out of that 10 gallon tank and put him in a proper enclosure. He needs bigger and will end up in at least a 55 gallon if not larger. You are feeding him the worse things you can feed him too. Never feed them lettuce, corn or cabbage. You should be feeding him calcium dusted crickets and more that 3 or 4. He should be getting as many as he can eat several times a day. I hope you have a UVB light on him and are providing a basking area with temps from 100-110. You should be giving him a daily salad of at least 2 greens chosen from collards, mustard, turnip and dandelion greens. Top that off with finely shredded butternut or acorn squash. You can also offer him okra, green beans, parsnips, peas, sweet potato and fruits only as a treat. Berries are usually good and they like them too. You have to shred or grate his veggies or cut them up small enough for him. Lay off carrots. You can give them to him once in a while but not as a staple food. If you have more questions, feel free to email me and I will help you the best I can.  Meanwhile get him a much larger tank.|`|Gh1uBXu8aa	A theory is maby when you try to handle him be more gentle and stay calm feed him some of his favorite foods by hand and socialize him by holding him more and while he is in your hand try to feed him his favorite foods hopefully he will get use to you and find you as something good instead of a Predator hope it works worked with mine bye good luck.|`|AA11975677	Hi we have a chinese water dragon and our friends do too, and we went through the same thing you are.  it's seems like after a couple of weeks they get crazy, they won't let you hold them and they dig constantly.

At my local humane society it's anywhere from $100 - $150...but honestly that doesn't even cover our cost and it should be more.  So I would expect to pay between $100 to even $250.  They all have different prices and it depends how much expense they have...some microchip as well.<br>  <br>  The dog will be current on vaccinations and be spay/neutered already or come with a certificate to do so when it's time.  If there were any other health issues (and many times there are), that will have been taken care of as well.

Shelters can mis-age and mis-diagnose animals - we adopted one that they said was healthy and over two, only to find from our vet that she was under 10 months and had whipworms.<br>  <br>  Needless to say her energy level spiked after she was healthy...|`|35BLOIgOaa	they will have a guide line on any fee's that you might incur<br>  but also make shure they have the dog's medical doc's<br>  wee had a wee jack russell for year's great family pet's very loyal<br>  but they do some time's have heart condition's that don't show up until they are older no problem's there it can be detect just trying to keep you up to spec what to ask and look for <br>  if in doubt about any fee's just grab one of the staff take them to one side and ask them I would not pay to much remember it's a rescue dog and they will be Trying to of load it not to sound  to harsh<br>  hope it go's well for  and the wee dug<br>  alymac|`|p7swtBYzaa	The Humane will bring the dog up to date on vaccinations and spay or neuter as necessary.<br>  They ask a donation to cover their costs - vetting is expensive - even with the discounts they often get.<br>  <br>  Our Humane asks between 65.- and 125.- donation - very cheap considering the dog is spayed/neuetered and fully vaccinated, depends on the age of the dog - younger dogs are usually more.<br>  <br>  Your Humane may ask more or less - it varies by county and costs for vetting.   We are a rural area and probably things cost less than in a city.<br>  <br>  This is the biggest bargain you will ever get, if you had to spay/neuter and vaccinate a puppy you got on your own, would cost you a lot more.<br>  <br>  Do a search for their website - that will likely list the fees.   Good luck - hope you get the pooch and glad you are rescuing a dog that needs a good home.|`|6hT06oY9aa	Absolutely no less than the cost of sterilising, worming, vaccinating and micro chipping.  For most rescue dogs, the price you pay is still very reasonable considering the amount of care the dog has had, the dog is essentially free.<br>  <br>  Just something to think about-if a few hundred dollars is out of your price range, think very carefully before having a dog at all.  They cost money and the price you pay for adoption covers all the treatment that you need to get anyway. <br>  Good luck.|`|7ViHb7cwaa	Probably between $75 & $120. Our local Humane Society charges 100 for adult dogs, 125 for pups. But they are spayed/neutered, have a chip implanted in them, and are up to date on all shots, so it's a VERY fair price to pay for your new family member. Google the shelter you're looking at to see if they have a website with a price list.|`|876fed5d0d7a0e4f3cedf6316868026caa	To late for me to answer your question. Let me throw this in however. Jack Russell's are full of action. Be ready for that. I love them, you will also if you are active. I watch the Citizens for Animal protection site for pets needing homes. They have some nice sweet faces & there is an adoption fee, also a discount for seniors. Don't think you qualify for that. My Toy Fox Terrior is 12 & I got her at a price. She is a perfect choice for me. My next pet might be a shelter dog,  <br>  Good luck & let us hear from you.|`|bnJLKQWMaa	$50 - $100<br>  <br>  That is what our shelter charges.  Less for senior dogs|`|Pz8rIt26aa	It's different at every shelter. But it usually ranges from $50-200|`|PM23RDycaa	Every shelter charges differently. If they do have a website it should state what their adoption fee is and what that pays for.|`|0e51HkpHaa	around a $100
r0oc9Rngaa	Your little kitten may take a little more time to learn but they are very smart!<br>  One year ago I found a little kitty in the woods. From a feral cat colony. He was blind and about 3 weeks old in very bad shape. Took him to emergency within 1 hour. Bad upper respiratory infection about to die. The feral mother had abandoned him.<br>  <br>  Got meds for his eyes & antibiotics, never had a cat before so I asked the vet what do I need to raise a cat?<br>  <br>  She gave me the usual...she said you must get a kitty litter ,mothers milk type & feed him with a bottle, I said ... why would he know to go in the kitty litter?<br>  <br>  The vet said..they just know, even though he was a blind feral wild cat, he went into his kitty littler from hour one.<br>  <br>  You have a happy go lucky kitty that does not give a dam about what you think what cats should do! I think is funny. Let him grow up his crazy habits and his brothers and sisters will show him!<br>  <br>  Be patient with him-her you won't be sorry!<br>  Good luck with your new kitty! I have one myself that I just rescued from the woods again, but this one is about 5 months old and he adores me already and he does everything right even he has never been in a house before... very strange?  5 days ago and he can do everything by the book of cats!|`|5ZrVP3Xjaa	He's not stupid, he's just trying to learn about new things. Once he's grown up, he won't be like that. Trust me. But if you want to get the kitten to stop doing those things, just put a little cat nip on things you expect your cat to sleep on, and a little something your cat hates on things you don't expect your cat to sleep on or in, such as the litter box.<br>  <br>  Hope this helps. Good Luck!|`|e31se8p1aa	Noona-LMAO!!!!!!!!!! You're hilarious! Anyway, he's not dumb. Do you expect a 2 year-old to be one of the world's greatest mathematicians?He's exploring. I find couches to be more comfortable than beds. A water dish is round and is perfect for curling up in(I might have to try that sometime!). He either is an explorer or doesn't like his food. He might think the food is litter!There you go! Litter food. He's just a teeny little guy. Let him learn.|`|AA11431152	he is just a baby. you probably slept in mashed potatoes or put your dads cellphone in lotion when you were a baby. Whats wrong with that? He doesnt know any better. Hey maybe you slept in the toilet too buddy.|`|2JBJdTzgaa	hmm.... think about this for a minute...<br>  the same reason babies are so stupid.<br>  in fact, there not stupid it all, just low on experience.|`|tBUtvh8uaa	put a blanket in the litter box and water dish and kitty litter in the feeding bowl...|`|0mb78CiWaa	Kittens are not stiupid. He may have been taken away from his mother to soon, so he did not learn everything.|`|mgdkr6hvaa	well babies can't do algebra or don't know history does that mean they're stupid? <br>  Maybe the litter box is comfortable and i know kittens especially in animal shelters like to lay in their dishes.  <br>  Let him learn.  It doesn't sound retarted, it sounds like a kitten.  <br>  Just let him be a kitten, let him explore, have fun.
w1lh1INHaa	I don't know, and that they claim pets can survive even better on vegetarian diets...well I'd like to know where their alleged information comes from.  I see no reports or studies cited.<br>  <br>  And, a cat cannot survivie on a vegetarian diet.  They recommend Vegepet, which is supposed to be a supplement for vegan/vegetarian cats, which DOES contain taurine.  Taurine is a necessary nutrient for cats, and it CANNOT be synthesized, and it comes from animal flesh or organs.  So, any "supplement" designed for vegetarian pets has some animal substance in it.  <br>  <br>  PETA is contradicting itself.|`|RN1wGlWWaa	Because they don't care.<br>  Because they are totally nutz.<br>  <br>  And I would not give 2 cents to what they say.  Cats and Dogs are MEAT eaters!|`|OaQWUfNoaa	Clearly, this is further evidence that they don't know or care about what is good for animals.<br>  <br>  I wonder what Ingrid Newkirk feeds her cat, that cannot clean itself...<br>  <br>  PETA are not an authority on animal welfare and should not be treated as though they have any relevant opinions or knowledge on the subject.|`|f5a8d99afbb73cd0703df99b87996901aa	Because PETA is a bunch of radical idiots.  They are not an animal welfare organization, they are an animal rights organization and their beliefs are stupid.  Animals need meat in their diets and they need owners to feed and protect them.  I could sit here all night and bash PETA but I'll stop there.<br>  <br>  Not done yet...  PETA representatives went to a dog show and sprayed antifreeze into the water bowls of the dogs there using the excuse the dogs were better off dead than being exploited in a dog show.  *done*|`|871f0e15f0d49545f27f78f43647edd3aa	Because they want the cat to die young so you will adopt another?  Really, they probably think their ideals are more important than the health of the pet.  In an ideal world, no cute chickens and cows would be killed for our cute pets, but cats need protein.  Even some people I have known have become sick on vegan diets.|`|pd5rERcfaa	PETA doesn't even think you should have a cat as a pet.  They make me so angry....grr.|`|R93qp2Zxaa	You said it yourself -- they are crazy, hypocritical, and illogical extremists.<br>  <br>  They spread crazy beliefs - such as not eating/using animal products to situations where it no longer even makes sense.<br>  <br>  Most of them though, if they were dying because someone tried to turn them from a carnivore into a herbivore...they'd change their ideals pretty quick.<br>  <br>  My cats like turkey best ;-)  Though chicken and dairy are good too.|`|V8PnUZqbaa	peta doesnt know whats good for them , who the hell heard of feeding ur cat vegaterian...c'mon ppl seriuosly , animals eat meat, at least cats do anyways . . ..peta can eat all the vegan they can handle, but honestly feed ur cat cat food, like made from meat/poultry|`|8ATXyOrkaa	PETA is retarded.|`|MSl6tMTvaa	so he wont end up like garfield
3LXbUg1raa	You'd probably have the best of luck at the smaller tracks.  Basically, show up at the stable/track gate in the mornings and let the guard know that you are looking for work as a hot walker or groom...then you wait and see if someone comes looking for workers...return and do this everyday, until someone comes and hires you.  Make sure to come bright and early- many tracks start bustling with workers about 4/4:30am already...Once you're hired as a groom/hot walker and you've proved yourself a good, able bodied worker then you can start talking to your boss about how you'd like to learn to exercise a horse.  If you're lucky, at the end of the season they may take you back to their farm and teach you how during the off-season...Many trainers won't take the time during race season to teach you at the track, plus you need to show you can properly gallop a horse on the track before they will allow you to get a license...without a proper license you cannot ride a horse on the track...<br>  <br>  Also, as a little side note...jockeys are riders that ride in a race...what you are wanting to do is called an exercise rider or gallop rider which only ride/exercise the horses in the mornings at a track and don't ride in a race...To become a jockey is a bit more extensive of a project than that of an exercise rider...<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  ~Add: Not to be all controversial, but actually it depends more on weight AND and the rider's balance and skill.  There are some bean pole jockeys out there, but it is more difficult for them because of the issues with balancing...<br>  <br>  Though, for an exercise rider (which is what you're implying you'd like to be) 5'3" shouldn't be much of a problem as long as your balance and riding skill are good...|`|MUfMJYHGaa	There are jockey schools,you can probably find them online.They will give you race horse training You are probably too big at 5'3" to be a jockey,, BUT you can become an exercise  or a steeplechase rider,either at a track or training barn. Look in the horse trades or just show up at the barns and tell them you are willing to learn. But get some good health insurance first as most of them won't cover you as you will be hired as an independent contractor.|`|opVutvuWaa	It take a lot to prove yourself. <br>  <br>  I worked in the racetrack industry and personally knew jockeys.<br>  <br>  Most of them started by working as a stable mate at a TB racing farm and worked their way up.<br>  <br>  After they proved themselves, they trained their yearlings and horses preparing for the track<br>  <br>  Eventually they worked at the racetrack where the TB farms horses where stabled and would excerise and "breeze" the horses on the track.<br>  <br>  Unforunately to get big in the horse industry to need to know A LOT of people and have A LOT of references and years to "prove" yourself|`|Czh1fbQgaa	The thing is those people are there to make money, not teach you to ride racehorses. If you know someone in the business that would help. To be a jockey, it takes years of training. I guess you could go to a racetrack and ask around, just don't expect much.|`|ZB0VuKh8aa	I think you are in the USA which may be different? But in the UK most racing stables take people on to excercise horses and help out in the yard. That is a good place to start.
6hvf02Eyaa	I am taking it your pup has not had his parvo shot..I would get him to a vet asap..if it is parvo he doesn't have much time the sooner caught and treated the better his chances.Is he drinking water still?Is he throwing that up? If he is not drinking much or is throwing up the water get him to an emergency clinic it may save his life if he has not had a parvo shot which I am assuming he has not he has the symptoms.If he is holding down water go in  morning to your vets office he needs seen asap puppies dehydrate easily. Please update me via e-mail.|`|Cfk1kr8Daa	Since he will not eat or drink anything, my guess is he is fairly sick.  I would take him to the vet as quickly as possible.  He needs fluids and supportive care.<br>  <br>   Even if he had a parvo shot already, it wouldn't necessarily keep him from getting it - just give him a better chance of beating it. Any dog can contract parvo, even with the vaccine.<br>  <br>    Good luck.|`|49ec8e0944023c0f5c20e37484f16366aa	It could be parvo, which is very serious.

Parvo will sneak up on you and by the time you really start to worry it is usually too late.<br>  If he has not had any shots my advice would be to grab your pup, get in your car, and get to a vet. Never mind the time or the distance.<br>  However if he has had his shots then it's okay to wait until tomorrow unless symptoms suddenly worsen.|`|SrRsoLfmaa	I don't think this is anything to worry about till the morning. <br>   If the food (diet) changed this would be normal.<br>  But if you are giving doggy treats look up the recalls there have been several recalls on dog snacks and food. PLEASE check your food and cookies out.  <br>  <br>  I wouldnt get to worry's though. I think he will be fine till morning|`|2iFQerjraa	Do not mess around, Take him now to your vet hospital.

His tummy needs a rest. Do try to get him to drink liquids. Low sodium chicken broth may go over better than water if he feels like crap. Take your fingers and lightly pinch the skin on puppy's back. If it doesn't immediately go back down when you release your fingers get him to the vet as soon as you can because this indicates severe dehydration and puppy will need IV fluids. If you feel like the puppies' condition worsens, you should take him to the vet. <br>  <br>  If you do go to the vet, do not be alarmed if they rush you into an isolation room. They will do this as a precaution because vomiting an diarrhea are signs of Parvo, a highly contagious often deadly disease. <br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.doggonehairy.net/" rel="nofollow">http://www.doggonehairy.net/</a>|`|ydshiNrKaa	Well I always worry when it's a puppy and they begin to become lethargic, and are throwing up and going to the bathroom non stop.  These are all indications of the parvo virus, which there is no cure for.  If this were my dog, I'd be making the 2 hour trip to the emergency clinic to make sure it isn't parvo.|`|W02kTOqmaa	It's worrisome because diarrhea and vomiting can quickly lead to dehydration, especially in young puppies. Call the emergency vet and talk to them. Although they can't really diagnose anything over the phone, they can listen to the symptoms and give you good advice, and let you know if they think your pup needs to be seen tonight or can wait until morning.
tPGxPDvBaa	Norfolk - you will have a hard time in finding. They are not common & will cost plenty. I know the least about them. They require minimum grooming & generally are hand stripped only compared to the other 2 terriers which can be clipped instead.<br>  <br>  Cairns are great small solid dogs & only need minimum grooming. They don't have to be clipped tho' some ppl do get them groomed like a westie.<br>  <br>  Scottie are also great solid dogs. larger than cairns & probably the most stubborn of the terriers. They are tough & not always the brightest. They do require more grooming & regular clips. Neither terrier is particularly hyper or high strung.<br>  <br>  Jack Russells are wild high strung dogs that I don't suggest to anyone. They are easiest of your group to groom since they are short haired.  Most ppl are not happy with their choice when they pick them.  They can be hard to handle & all that hyper behavior will drive some folks nuts.<br>  <br>  Try each one breed club for more & probably accurate info for the good & bad triats.|`|Cfk1kr8Daa	The best information will come from the members of the breed clubs.<br>   Look them up on the AKC website, find the local club, and call some of them.<br>  <br>   Any breed fancier who is a good steward of their breed will be glad to give you good information on their characteristics and what they are like to live with.  You might also find this at an AKC show, if you can find one to attend. <br>  <br>     Be careful of anyone who is too eager to supply you with a dog - a good breeder will be close to the vest and willing to discuss their breed, but not quick to market their puppies until they determine that you have a fabulous home for one.<br>  <br>    Once you determine whther any of these are something you want, try looking in rescue - you'd be surprised what great dogs can be waiting there for you.|`|Z9zzNYNCaa	I can tell you more than the nothing you've gotten so far.<br>  <br>  Cairn & scotties & Norfolk & Norwich & Wire Fox & Schnauzers & Lakies & Welsh & Dandies & WHWT &  glennies & PRT & ***ALL*** the broken coated terriers (PLUS a bunch of other breeds in other groups) >>>ARE<<< supposed to be HAND STRIPPED!!!

0f35e35fc374dea3ca1e2b585d13080caa	awww poor baby :( .... When a dog has a upset stomach, they throw up and the dry heaving they have white drool comes up cause his stomach was empty. When you took your pom to the park and he may of eat something from the ground and that could be the reason he is sick now. try to give him to drink water so he wont  dehydrate.|`|GSf09ALBaa	Is your Pom up to date on his vaccinations?  If not, this could be very serious.  Contact your local animal shelter and see if they have a list of low cost vets.  Your dog needs to see a vet whether you have the money or not.|`|8FdOfT11aa	You can try what Pomerani said.  If that doesn't work, it could be a chest infection.<br>  <br>  My dog was "throwing up" white foamy stuff, her nose was runny, she was dry heaving.  It got to the point that she wasn't eating and was lethargic.  I took her to the vet and 2 x-rays, some blood work, 2 antibiotics, and $300 later, she is feeling much better.<br>  <br>  I can't really afford the vet either, but it's cruel (and illegal) to the animal to withhold care it needs.  Look in to CareCredit.  My vet told me about it.  It's a credit card you can use for any medical reason (vets included).  Also, call around.  Some vets can work up a payment plan and the SPCA usually has an "affordable clinic" which will generally be cheaper than your usual vet's office.<br>  <br>  If you really really can't afford this dog, you should consider giving it up to the SPCA or a rescue.  As much as it sucks for you, the animal doesn't deserve to be neglected.|`|K2QwEM4raa	You already have a good answer. Has it had it's shots?  If not then I think if he is not much better tomorrow then he has to see a vet. Never take a dog out without it's shots even if you have to give them to him yourself. And a dog that has not had it's shots can still pick up Parvo from your shoes even if he is kept in the home. Good luck!|`|lMYuPrhIaa	Maybe he ate something bad there. Don't try to feed him.

024lJBZ4aa	If you want to do conformation, you need to start out with a "show quality" dog.  Attend some handling classes and enter the dog in a show.  In some breeds, you need to hire a professional handler.  Thankfully, not in my breed.<br>  <br>  To show a dog in obedience & agility, you'll need a dog that enjoys working and is built well.  You'll need to find a good instructor that teaches competition classes (no petsmart or petco's).  An instructor who is successful in the obedience and/or agility ring.  BTW, for obedience & agility, you don't need a purebred dog, since there are plenty of venues that welcome mixbreeds.<br>  <br>  I will warn you, it is an expensive sport.  First the dog training classes, in my area $180 for an 8 week obedience class and $175 for 8 week agility class.  Remember, you taking classes weekly until your dog is ring ready, so you have to add up that cost.  Then you have travel costs:  gas, hotels, which sometimes have pet fees plus you have the dog show entry fees, costs will depend on the venue your showing in.  For AKC and UKC the entry fee's are approx $28/$30 dollars and entry.  (So, if you enter 3 different events in one day, with one dog in lets say AKC, it'll cost you appox $90 in entry fees).<br>  <br>  Also, don't forget, if your looking to purchase a "show quality" dog for conformation, you may be looking at over $1000 range (depending on the breed), which you will probably co-own with the breeder.  As a new person to showing, a breeder will not give you sole ownership.<br>  <br>  Most important thing I can tell you, is choose a dog or breed you think you can live with.  It will be a pet, first and foremost over being a "show dog", which is really just a hobby.  <br>  <br>  For me, showing dogs is my hobby.  I'd rather be at an agility trial that at the movies.<br>  <br>  edit:<br>  <br>  Mixbreed are welcome to compete in obedience, agility, flyball, rally obedience and competitive obedience.  NADAC, USDAA, CPE, DOCNA, ASCA all welcome mixbreed dogs in their programs.  For obedience, UKC, ASCA and the new St. Huberts offers an obedience program thats open to all dogs.   Unfortately, there is so much mis-information out there and unknowledgable people continuing to spout off about only purebreds can compete in obedience/agility.  Not True!<br>  <br>  The only venue that does not welcome mixbreeds is the AKC.|`|x8Vgu6acaa	To show and win in conformation is the hardest to find a dog for.  You need to find a good winning breeder with a show quality dog that they will entrust to you.  Show quality dogs are hard to come by and years of breeding and heartache has gone into producing each one.  You will have to prove to the breeder you are serious.  if you are under 18 you can get a dog that is not quite good enough for the breed ring and show in Jr. Handling classes.  This will do a lot to prove to the breeders your commitment in order to get a high quality dog the next time.  <br>  <br>  It is much easier to find a dog that you can show in agility or obedience.  Good breeders often have dogs that do not quite measure up to the show ring.  Most of the time for some fault so small no one but a judge would notice it. The breeders are very willing to place these "pet" quality dogs in homes where they will be shown in performance events.    But, it takes hours & hours & months & years to train up to the top levels of competition.  The good thing is, you & your dog are judged on what you do, not someones opinion as in the conformation ring.  <br>  <br>  Good luck.  This is a great sport to be involved in no matter what venue you decide to do.  And, there is no reason you can't do all of them.|`|TgNQAYyXaa	Conformation - Pedigree dog registered with appropriate association (depending which country you are in)  "Show ponie" dogs where the dog is judged against set breed standards/criteria.<br>  <br>  Obedience = Pedigree NOT required - can enter any dog provided you are a member of appropriate association (depending which country you are in)  Where brains and obedience are key factors.<br>  <br>  Agility = Pedigree NOT required - can enter any dog provided you are a member of appropriate association (depending which country you are in)  Where speed and agility is critical.<br>  <br>  Edit:<br>  In Australia, the dog does not have to be purebred to compete in obedience and agility.  No wonder mixed breed owners get cranky - really stupid that mixed breeds cannot compete in obedience or in agility in the good old USA.|`|Chxoncy7aa	The first thing you need to do is decide on the breed that best suits you.  Then you need to go to a bunch of shows.  Talk to a lot of breeders.  Watch how their dogs do in the ring, and ask a lot of questions.  Hopefully you will be able to find a good breeder that you can get a great show dog from.  Don't buy from the first person you talk to.|`|PM23RDycaa	Ok first and foremost there are TWO legit all breed clubs in the USA <br>  <br>  AKC and the UKC the UKC is only a couple years younger than the AKC.

wq6lfHIBaa	Don't worry after surgery some times the area can have some swelling, it will go down in the next week or two,  If it gets really swollen red and you can feel heat radiating off or any yellow discharge it can be infected, but what your describing sounds normal, Very proud of you that you neuter your cat and for being a responsible pet owner!|`|f5a8d99afbb73cd0703df99b87996901aa	Some cats have larger sacs so they're still visible after neutering.  They didn't cut his penis off. His testicles were removed is all.  A couple of my males still have visible sacs while the others have nothing.  Not to worry.  It's normal.|`|fzaf5t3Caa	that is normal lol. they removed "them" but it wil always look like they didn't . I have a male cat and it still looks like he has 'them' but he definitley doesn't. Dont ya worry =] good luck with your cat!!!|`|zTiZQY7uaa	At the SPCA, I don't think 4 of my boy cats have a penis anymore. The kitten went to the vet, and now I get flipped off daily.|`|AA10210947	Usually after neutering the scrotum will swell and sometimes fill with blood. If it doesn't go down in a day or 2 contact your vet|`|RN1wGlWWaa	It may take a little while for the swelling to go down.  If you have questions in a week - call your vet.
hQQuqyYcaa	I would recommend getting Quick Cure or Rid Ich. You need to treat it as soon as possible. Don't wait for it to "fall off" it will only get worse. Make sure you also put an air stone in the tank to add extra oxygen.|`|9dd1996d5fe2889ddece4c461db89465aa	We put ich treatment in our tank and the ich was gone the next day.

(i dont think she knows that its creepy, but it is) (lol)<br>  Ok, yeah, hope this helps... but it probably wont...<br>  Put that stuff u have been putting on it, because my neighboors, you know King, they just put neosporin on his cut, and it was a bigger cut then Kenzi's cut...|`|Td3Azeabaa	Go to vet, did the dog have a vaccinated tag on collar, and was it wild?

Bites are bad about getting infected.|`|GSf09ALBaa	Funny you should be asking this question.  I just discovered a big gash on the inside of my Pit's back leg.  I know she got it from jumping up on the tree to get the squirrels.  It does not warrant a vet trip.  I put some peroxide on it and since it is not bleeding I will keep an eye on it and let it heal.  It is just a big chunk of missing skin.  <br>  <br>  Don't fret.|`|pIvN6TY7aa	! PLEASE, PEOPLE !<br>  <br>  Hydrogen peroxide and iodine are powerful antibiotics.  That means they kill living things. Like germs. ALSO FLESH AND SKIN.<br>  <br>  They are powerful disinfectants, but they also kill living cells, and make it harder for the wound to heal.<br>  <br>  I use Neosporin on The Kid and me, because it's said to be gentle, yet effective.  A dog will probably lick it right off, because it's a dog's nature to lick a wound.  I don't think that Neosporin would be good for her digestion, because of killing off intestinal flora and fauna.<br>  <br>  Recently I read, in a reliable source, that there are substances in a dog's saliva that actually aid healing.  There are folk beliefs that a dog licking a human wound will help it to heal. And there seems to be substance behind this belief.<br>  <br>  As long as it's not bleeding, and there don't seem to be any broken bones or torn ligaments, or extreme pain, I wouldn't worry about it for now. Take her to the vet as quickly as makes sense, probably for a few stitches, an antibiotic (or maybe Neosporin?) and one of those collars so she won't pull the stitches out too soon.|`|AKl3Twuuaa	go to your pharmacy and get some of that stretch tape that doesn't really stick to hairs much.  put  a pad with neosporin on it  and tape over it until you can get to a vet.  Keep her from licking on it this way.<br>  good luck.|`|lNzhglLFaa	well.... go get a tube sock.... and wrap it up.. keep it dry and keep putting the neosporin to it<br>  <br>  get her to a vet as soon as you can so it doesn't get infected..|`|AA11244754	Then take them to the emergency vet if not it will surely get infected and then may have to be amputated depending on how bad the infection gets.|`|5aI77YF8aa	Just put that gauze stuff wrapped around the leg with meds and bandages so that she can't bother it and it doesn't get infected, but before you put meds [neosporin] on, you should clean it out and use hydrogen peroxide. If she doesn't like the wrap, then go to the vet. They can give you advice for this, and they could also disinfect it and clean it out better than you can probably do it =]|`|bStEdyqEaa	if i were you i wouldnt put neosporin on it if she licks it just wash it and iodine works if you have any.. just bring her to the vet in the morning|`|mNjYQr5Oaa	Flush the wound with peroxide, dry it, then put anibacterial ointment on it, and wrap the wound with sponge tape, so she doesn't lick it.<br>  <br>  Hope this helps.<br>  <br>  :D|`|3opisoDMaa	wait for the vet and while you do put a bandage over it and if you have those colars to stop them from licking herself.|`|Lkik9Sr7aa	since its not physically bleeding then i think she should be fine. if the vets dont think that its emergency service then she will be fine. shes only licking it to help heal it.|`|b1461ee6cb21361aad22b1b0151b5104aa	wrap it and keep it clean and keep the neosporin on it until you can get to the vet. good luck|`|n2CU8mFMaa	Until the vet. opens just watch her and keep her comfortable.

pcvcMePXaa	I would go with an aqua clear im a big fan of them i find them really quite, and filter pretty nice, so id say go with an AquaClear 50 seriously it will keep your tank nice and clean and will filter more water per hour, thous giving you a more sparkling clean water.|`|4ap1GPvsaa	I would strongly suggest a fluval 12-34 gallon aquarium pump. Many fish/pet stores stock these kinds of filters and they are a silent filter. I currently have one in one of my aquariums and it makes absoloutly no noise what so ever. If you do choose to get this filteration system, there is a dial on the top that you should set to setting "B" this will give a great water flow to the tank and is the most silent setting. Also please note that this filter should be placed in the middle of the wall you decide to place it on for maximum filtration, and also make sure that you rinse of the bacterial pellets that come inside the filter before use of this filter or it could cause death of fish.<br>  <br>  Hope This Helps<br>  ~Sincerly Cori~|`|oMmBhWK4aa	If your main consideration is a quiet filter, then get a suitably sized internal power filter (submerged so no noise at all) or a smaller external canister filter like Eheim Classic or Ecco range. Check the specifications of the filter, it should be able to filter at least 3 times your tank volume per hour. The specs will also state that the filter is suitable for aquariums up to a certain size. Power consumption is not a big deal since these smaller filters generally only consume up to 5 watts. Many people prefer canister filters as internal filters sacrifice some tank space & may be a bit messier to maintain. Canister filters cost a bit more but are worth the price as a good one is reliable, provides excellent biological filtration capability, is extremely quiet and reduces the need for frequent filter maintenance (you don't need to touch it for months unless something clogs up).|`|nbtVuFVNaa	anything thats made for a 40 gallon or more and can fit in your tank...(u should be able to customize the current for ur fish with a sponge:D)...and im being serious abt the 40 or more!|`|hQQuqyYcaa	I personally like the Marineland Penguin filters. Whisper is also pretty good.
lNzhglLFaa	let him settle in for a few days....once he figures out you are feeding him he will warm up to you|`|6yD5k9Azaa	he's scared.<br>  he'll get use to you soon enough|`|wq6lfHIBaa	He is still pretty young i think he is just playing, try giving him a ball of foil and have him waste his energy with that (plus your son will enjoy watching him play)  Give him some space to get a good feel of your home and get more comfortable there and he will make a great cat!!! Also remember he will mellow out as he ages!  Enjoy your new kitty!|`|SLSX6QQsaa	He's just a baby and he's probably playing.  Although with cats there is a VERY fine line between pleasure and anger.  He could be happy then mad all in a second.  My cat didn't stop this kind of "play" until he was about 1 1/2.  If you have any other cat questions let me know.  I've had them for 27 years and I've had all kinds.|`|AA11193773	He's just scared. Isolate him ina room with toys, food, and a litter box.keep him there for about 1-4 days. And no matter what don't declaw. then your cat will be scarred for life and never like you. I suggest using something called soft paws|`|776143369bb290accd3ea9aa251e66c9aa	He doesn't want you to touch him.  Always give a cat time to adjust to being in a new place before you approach him or try to touch him.  They're not like dogs; they have to establish a territory in which they feel safe and comfortable before they want anything to do with people.  He let you pet him when he was distracted by the food because he was more interested in eating than being scared of you.  <br>  <br>  Put the cat in a room with food, water and a litter box and leave him alone.  After about a day, visit him in his room frequently and bring treats.  Offer him treats, but let him approach you to get them.  Don't try to pet him until he's comfortable coming up to you.  Then you can try to touch him while you give treats.  In my experience, this kind of bribery is the best way to win over a fearful cat.<br>  <br>  Also, have him neutered as soon as possible.   That will mellow him out a lot.|`|AA12305758	best thing could be the cat is just scared new place a kid and all these things at once also get him neuter it will help him not be so aggressive and if he still is like that some cats and breeds just are loners he will come to you when he wants and if he don't he will react i had many cats and some a lap cat nad other would rather bite your fingers off don't give up on him in the end you  feed and give him a home he will thank you in due time|`|90d9998cdc55912a39dd589dedde20c5aa	Have him spayed soon, while he is still a kitten.Before he knows what its like to be fully in heat.As for the claws, the kitten has yet to learn the limits of his own claws.<br>   I had a kitten that was about the same age.Because of the size of his claws at that age playing with him felt like I was sticking my hand in a bag of syringes!|`|FFLUenuMaa	well ur cat was distracted when it was smelling the food thats why it let u pet it. when u wanty to pet him u put food in ur hand and wait until he come to u. then pet him slowly and gently
W02kTOqmaa	Licking all has to do to puppy behaviors (mostly in wolf packs).<br>  <br>  In the wild, when a wolf returns from hunting to the den, the pups will all lick the corners of the mouth to induce vomiting. They can then eat the meal that was brought for them.<br>  <br>  When we domesticated wolves, we pretty much bred dogs to act like giant puppies. Dogs pretty much never grow up, and the majority display puppy-like behaviors their entire life, compared to an adult wolf. As the pack leaders, it is their natural instinct to lick us. A pup will lick a wolf returning to the den out of excitment, pleasure, and hunger, and dogs do the exact same thing.<br>  <br>  Certain breeds are known to lick more then others, and each dog is an individual. If you have an excitable, outgoing breed, such as a golden, you are more likely to get a dog that wiggles around and licks every new person it meets. Of course, each dog, like yours, is different. To your golden, you are the pack, and other people are intruders. To your newfoundland, it could be that he sees you as the provider. Maybe you feed him and spend the most time with him? It could be several things.<br>  <br>  Other breeds that tend to be standoffish wont lick as much. Huskies, who are more solitary, will not lick nearly as much as a golden, for example, even though huskies tend to be friendly with most people.<br>  <br>  My german shepherd licks my boyfriend and my sister but not me, even though he is obviously my dog and loves me the most. I just don't like dog drool, and he has learned this. If I lean my head down and ask for a kiss, he will nudge me with his nose and maybe give me a very tiny quick lick, but that is it. He knows I don't like licks. Now, being a shepherd, he is very weary of strangers, and probably wouldn't lick anyone else.|`|HEdGGmkhaa	Some are like OCD, they groom you constantly because you belong to them in their eyes....look up the dog whisperer, I saw a show on it once.<br>  Some like the salty taste on our skin but thats a long shot lol|`|01c00a483e32db6219cad681155f5d92aa	Dogs will lick you for the salts from your skin. Some dogs will lick more and others never will, for some they do it out of habit.|`|zTeLhroWaa	i have no idea.  if someone gives you a good answer, point them in my direction or vice versa.

There are more reasons but I'm not so sure of the rest.
qCUz6YXMaa	Hey, may i just say PLEASE DO NOT USE A HEAT ROCK UNLESS YOU WANT A DEAD LEOPARD GECKO. <br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.kingsnake.com/rockymountain/RMHPages/RMHeopard.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.kingsnake.com/rockymountain/R...</a><br>  <br>  Here is a relatively easy to follow step-by-step instructional guide to caring for a Leopard Gecko:<br>  1: Acquire a clean, disinfected 10-gallon or more reptile tank.<br>  2: Lay down about 2 layers of paper towel for a base and cover the paper towel with very fine sand (to reduce the chace of impaction). Impaction is the "stoppage" of your gecko's intestinal tract due to the accidental ingestion of large, coarse sand and is especially harmful for baby geckos.)<br>  3: Put an undertank heating pad (10-gallon or 20-gallon size, depending on the size tank you purchased) under 1 side of the tank to create a heat gradient.<br>  4: Put 1 hiding place above the heating pad and another on the opposite side (the cooler side).<br>  5: Put a water dish that is low to the ground on the cooler side of the tank. The water dish's walls can be no higher than the nose of the gecko because in the wild, geckos look down for water.<br>  6: Put a fluorescent light source above the tank and leave it on for about 14 hours each day.<br>  7: Put 2 small thermostats in the tank; 1 near the warm hiding place and 1 near the cooler hiding place, resulting (hopefully, if you placed the hiding places on opposite sides of the tank) in the thermostats being on opposite walls of the tank. The thermostat near the warmer side should read no higher and no lower than 86 degrees F and the thermostat on the cooler side should read no higher and no lower than 76 degrees F.<br>  8: You should feed your gecko medium mealworms dusted with a calcium powder (Leopard Gecko Dust by T-Rex works well) at first, and as the gecko gets bigger, it can graduate to large mealworms and crickets <br>  9: The gecko's tail should be fat and healthy-looking, not skinny and shriveled. If its tail is skinny, immediantly find out why they are not eating. <br>  10: Handle baby geckos sparingly until they are at least 6 months old, since handling is extremely stressful for the babies. Older geckos may be handled every day by YOU ONLY! If you allow someone other than you to handle your gecko, it will become extremely stressed and its health may suffer!<br>  11: Lastly, I recomend you buy the Leopard Geckos For Dummies handbook, because it is very helpful and resourceful.<br>  <br>  Good Luck.|`|AZKbJESUaa	Don't use heat rocks, reptiles may spend to much time on them, then burn themselves.  <br>  <br>  -Really the best thing for bedding is the cage carpet, or astro turf.  Though you can use cali sand for a more natural look. (read back of bags to make sure it's good for for gecko). <br>  -They need the over tank heating bulb or ceramic bulb.  <br>  -under tank heater only large enough to cover about 1/3 of the tank bottom. <br>  - hides for warm and cool side so your reptile can better regulate it's body temp. this is why I don't recommend the fluorescent heating tubes. <br>  - Crickets are the main food course, though you can feed it meal worms, silk worms, grass hoppers, even small pinkie mice.   <br>  -keep temp at about 86F for day time and 70F for night.  <br>  - thermometers on both hot and cool side and a thermostat to control temp. <br>  -They are nocturnal so they do not require UVA/UVB bulbs, as in the wild they are buried in the ground during the day, and you get UVA/UVB from the sun Though you can give it a low UVB out put of about 2% but that is optional.  <br>  -vitamin dust suppliments that you put on it's food.  <br>   <br>  books teach you allot and they are written by expert breeders and raisers.|`|fbZjUTCRaa	no matter what make sure you get a big water dish. my leopard gecko loves to soak when i put fresh warm water in it.|`|hQQuqyYcaa	First of all, absolutely no heat rocks...they burn the reptile's belly. <br>  -20 gallon long tank<br>  -UVB light<br>  -tank lid (metal screen top works great)<br>  -hiding spot (half log is good)<br>  -moist moss (for under hiding spot)<br>  -cage carpet for 6" and under<br>  -calcisand for over 6"<br>  -water dish<br>  -under-the-tank heater<br>  -live crickets<br>  -cricket dust (calcium only, no Vit. D3 because vitamins and minerals degrade each other over time)<br>  -food/water for crickets...water comes in gel form<br>  -live mealworms<br>  -smooth small ceramic dish for mealworms<br>  -and most importantly...a veterinarian who knows reptiles...always great to have the vet info on hand in case of an emergency.|`|wLgGD63raa	No heat rocks! They can get too hot and burn your gecko. You will need a heating pad though. The heating pad should cover about 1/3 of the tank. You will not be needing any special lighting such as UVB light since leopard geckos are nocturnal. These lizards absorb heat through their belly and digest their food a lot better with belly heat.<br>  <br>  You need three hides: a moist hide on the hot side, and two other hides, one on the cool side and one in the middle. The moist hide can be made by sticking wet spaghnum moss, paper towel, or reptile carpet in the hide.<br>  <br>  For a substrate, I recommend unglazed slate tile. It holds heat better, looks nicer, is easier to clean, and more natural to your gecko since they live on hard packed clays in the wild. You could also use non-adhesive shelf liner or paper towel. I would not suggest using sand, or calci-sand as this can cause impaction and lead to the death of your gecko. It is also more difficult for them to walk on. I would not use reptile carpet either since often times your leopard gecko will get it's nails stuck it in and some times it will rip them out.<br>  <br>  You need a water dish, a food dish, and a dish filled with pure calcium powder. You may never see your leopard eating the calcium, but they do.<br>  <br>  You will also need a thermometer and your temperatures should be between 82 and 88 degrees.<br>  <br>  Finally, you will need a vitamin supplement in the form of a powder to dust your gecko's food with.<br>  <br>  If you really want to, you can go ahead a buy a digital food scale (found with the kitchen appliances) to monitor your gecko's weight with. The average adult gecko weighs between 50 and 60 grams.<br>  <br>  Hope this helped! Good luck with your new friend. =)

If you notice any weird behavior she might be having problems though. One of my cats took 24 hours (and she had them behind the computer desk, yeah not cool)
uvU5DnHcaa	If when handling her and she is biting you its obvious that she does not want to be held. Most guinea pigs bite because they are hungry, so start feeding her 3 times a day or more each meal time. If she is pregnant she will need her feeds increased anyway.<br>  <br>  They are pregnant for 69 -72 days. Average being 70 days.<br>  A sow should only feel firm all round from 4 weeks to six weeks.<br>  If you are holding her on your chest then you should be able to feel the bubs moving around any time after 6 weeks. If the movement is all over the belly usually tells that 3 bubs are there at least. Less movement , less bubs in there.<br>  They can have up to five babies to not much trouble. Smaller the litters mean the bigger the bubs will be. Sows from the age of 6 months rarely have problems. If this sow has littered before you will probably wake up one morning and they will be there running around.<br>  The easiest way to know how close they are is to place your finger under neath and feel how wide it is between the bones directly under the tail bone. She should widen to about 2 1/2 - 3 cms before giving birth. She can also be this wide for up to 24 hours before delivering.|`|GrYhFNMdaa	If there is a male around and they are unaltered, chances are she is pregnant. If she does not like you touching around her stomach then respect that and don't do it. take her for a check up to make sure everything is going well and i would suggest you separate the male and female during this time|`|hmXWk90waa	If there is a male around then chances are she is preganant! Take her to the vet for a check up to see how she is doing. How long a go was the male and female together it usally takes 66-72 days for a guinea pig to have a litter.Seperate the female and male ammidiatley because an hour after she gives birth she will become on heat again and the male can mate her again and it becomes very stressfull for the guinea pig and you have a chance you could lose the mother and babies. maybe she is biting you because you are squeezing her to hard. Hope this Helps!! Please feel free to contact me for any other questions you have !|`|6JNswOpbaa	is you have another pig in there and its male she probs is preg.

yEUo24Znaa	Years ago I had a Chow with the same ( as near as a brief desciption can tell )  Problem.   Prostate cancer is not curable nor treatable in dogs. Removing the prostate causes much more discomfort and the end is the same, but surgery often makes the life expectancy shorter.   Your brother is up against a really hard decision.  Be there for. him, and when his dog has fewer good days than bad, be with him when he helps to end his friends suffering.    Cancer of the prostate rarely means more than 3 to 4 months left.  Encourage your bro to let his pet go with dignity, and peace.  Not pain and procedures.  Email me if you want.|`|a8Pq2Lmdaa	I would do what I could as long as the dog was not suffering or in pain.  Your brother must remember that the dog is not going to understand why all this is going on like a human would.<br>  <br>  I can understand spending money to treat animals.  We have done the same with one of dogs, a cat, and a bird.  It was not in the thousands, but it was quite a few years ago when the technology was not all there and it was outrageous to spend $300-$400 on "just a pet".  My pets are my babies.  I am trying to type while my cat, that I spent $300 of my high school graduation money on to treat his cancer, is sleeping on my arm.|`|01e20da0d169c7d0c6c0a2c2631a8036aa	Personally I would just be their for your brother. He is just trying to hold on to something he dearly loves. Each of us feels differently on when is the wright time to give up. However their is no correct answer. Just support him, hes going through a hard time as is his dog.|`|ydshiNrKaa	I'd probably do the same thing your brother is doing.  I'd explore any and all avenues before I'd euthanize him.|`|YLYAo2zmaa	As much as I love my dogs, I think when this happens we need to evaluate, prognosis and quality of life. There is no point in spending thousands and making the dog suffer only to prolong his life an extra few months in the end.<br>  If the chance for complete recovery is excellent, then no holds barred on treatment as far as I am concerned. <br>  There is also the point of treatment, is it painful? Prolonged pain can change a dogs personality, they don't understand sometimes that all this is to make them well. I think they can turn mean because of it. I've dealt with lots of dogs all my life, the only times I have ever been bitten was when one was in pain. I have been bitten about 4 times.|`|AA10441869	Unfortunately many pet owners get mixed up on what is the best for the animal. Many people confuse their feeling of guilt or fear of death with their animals. Quality of life and what is right for the pet is most important not how the owner feels. If my dog was unable to live a fairly normal life I would do some serious thinking about what is best. Sometimes to prolong an animals life isn't the answer.|`|pvgwJwxvaa	it would be helpful to know what type of cancer?  where it originated from?  is the dog neutered?|`|2c844fcf526bc2b90f16b7c425e11aa7aa	I would do and have done what your brother is doing and my dog lived a quality pain free life for some months with cancer.  It cost thousands of dollars and every cent was worth the extra time it gave us.<br>  <br>  You brother is a loving dog owner and needs your support and understanding.  Please support him at this very difficult and painful time for him. <br>  If his dog can have quality of life for the time he has left then I congraulate your brother and I hope he will have more time with his much loved dog. <br>  <br>  His priority must be to keep his dog pain free and there are excellent drugs to make this possible.  I doubt he will keep his dog alive only to watch it suffer.  He sounds to be a caring devoted dog owner.<br>  <br>  If your brother is willing to spend his money on treatment for his dog then that is his business and his money.  He knows he will have to make the dreaded decision to put his dog to sleep and he will do that when the time is right.  In the meantime he needs compassion and understanding.<br>  <br>  Edited to add:  Bob what are you thinking?  It is just your morbid curiosity in wanting to know what type of cancer and if the dog is neutered.  Your questions are neither appropriate or helpful.
UZBl63blaa	STOP WITH WORKING ON HIS FRAME AS THIS PUTS MORE STRAIN ON TENDONS, LOOSE REIN, BUCKLE END WALK ON THE FLAT  NOT UP AND DOWN HILLS, MAKE MATTERS MUCH WORSE, YOU NEED TO STRENTHEN THE TENDONS BEFORE YOU DISTROY THEM.   DO NOT DO ANY TURNS ON FORE HAND OR LEG YEILDING FOR HEVENS SAKE, UNLESS YOU WANT HIM TO HAVE BOWED TENDON AND EXTESORTENDON STRAIN WHICH IS INCUREABLE|`|RloOJ43haa	Can you do lateral work with him? That is usually a great muscle builder.|`|TTLIp8Beaa	you can always work him on different sized circles and serpentines. <br>  work on flexing, and stretches. <br>  you can do turns on the forehand and turns on the hind. (if he's sound too)<br>  you can also back him. (if sound too)<br>  <br>  edit-<br>  you said he was STIFF right? (correct me if i'm wrong)<br>  flexing, bending and working on a frame will HELP him, not hurt him. if your not sure, ask your vet what he can and can't do.<br>  <br>  <br>  okay so it's not just me, that lady behind me really IS crazy!<br>  XD|`|Fmq1YEtyaa	i agree with stephanie!|`|MUfMJYHGaa	If there is a stifle problem it can be alleviated with a raised heel in the shoe or an injection to help "scar" up the ligament making it less elastic which helps keep the stifle from slipping as much. They can also do a "stifle cut" . The walks and hills will help the muscles build up to keep it in place. Keep him out of sand and heavy going and don't try to force him into small circles when you work him. The injectable adaquon will actually work better and be cheaper than feed thrus as all of it gets into the system and stays for months. If you are comfortable giving shots, buy it  and save yourself the vet call|`|UIM8X38Oaa	I just answered this question.  I think you are on the right track following your vets and trainers advise.  Walking up and down hill in straight lines is the best thing you can do for a horse with stifle issues.  Walking is the least amount of strain for his condition.  I am sure the cold air makes it worse it will be nice when it warms up. <br>  You are doing Great!<br>  <br>  Jenny<br>  <br>  I see recommendations for circles and Serpentine exercises etc.  I would not recommend them for a stifle issue.  That is like you walking in tight circles with a sore or trick knee.  Keep them straight. You did say that you were just trying to keep him toned until the Spring.<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  Edit:  I just wanted to also tell you what else I discovered with my horse.  I found that putting him a stall (ours are 12x12) seemed to aggravated his stifle.  Getting up and down, tight space etc.  I leave him out as much as I can if the weather is good and his issues  are almost none existent.
2Ku4DuvCaa	Whether or not a parrot can talk has absolutely nothing to do with its intelligence. I've known birds that have learned to disassemble their cages while their owners are away. I've known birds who will learn the combination to locks. Not all of those parrots talked.<br>  <br>  Parrots choose whether or not they want to talk. Depending on the species, it might not be known for talking. If you bought the parrot specifically because you wanted an animal that could talk, then I suggest you just be happy with it being "cool" because the fact of the matter is that not all parrots will learn to talk. Your parrot will learn to make sounds that interests it.<br>  <br>  I have worked with an African Grey parrot, apparently the best of all talkers among parrots, who was twenty years old and didn't say a word. What he could do, however, was mimic just about any other sound to the TEE. When he wanted something to drink, he mimicked the sound of the sink running. Are you going to believe these people who are telling you that parrots aren't smart when a parrot can learn to do that?<br>  <br>  Whether or not a parrot talks should not determine its worth or its intelligence. If you do want to encourage your parrot to talk, there are ways to go about it. Say the words slowly and in a happy tone. Show your parrot your tongue while you talk so that he can see what you're doing. When he tries to mimic you, express how happy you are. Smile and tell him he's been good. He may not understand what you say, but he can understand your tone and your expression.<br>  <br>  Make sure all of your parrots needs are being met. Make sure he has a large cage, plenty of toys, a healthy diet of pellets and bird friendly fresh foods, and plenty of time outside of the cage to socialize with you. The happier your parrot is, the easier it will be for him to learn new things.<br>  <br>  Keep in mind though that even if you do that, there's no guarantee that your parrot will learn to talk. Not all of them want to, so not all of them do. Trust me on this, I've dealt with hundreds of parrots.|`|1e1eUHr3aa	maybe you can repeat one saying until the bird remembers it. Bird's are not stupid, they are like airplanes, cause they fly and they are much better than cats cause they can correct and flip over when thrown upside-down to fly correctly. Birds are not stupid.|`|z2cysiEhaa	A bird is not unintelligent because it cannot imitate the human voice. I mean a bird is a bird and normally talks bird language. Intelligence has nothing to do with it.|`|K2QwEM4raa	Some bird's talk and some don't even if they are the same kind. I think they are all smart in their own way.  Maybe you are expecting to much and didn't do your reached.|`|tm9egUBraa	This depends on the bird you have. Just because it is a parrot doesn't mean it can imitate human speech. What type of parrot is it?|`|u8IUPlECaa	Maybe he/she doesn't want to talk :p|`|uvHc7EDOaa	People could say your not intelligent for buying a pet that you don't understand. <br>  <br>  I don't know if you've heard about Alex or not, but if you want proof that birds are smart, he is definately it. He had a vocabulary higher than most people these days and could use them in context. Seriously I think birds are a lot smarter than most people in this day and age.<br>  <br>  I have a Princess Parrot, who are not known to be talkers, yet every morning he sweet talks me into letting him out of his cage. He is a fantastic talker. Then on the other hand is my Cockatiel, which are meant to be great talkers. He whistles fantastically and it doesn't take him long to pick up a new song, but he doesn't talk at all. He's no less intelligent, just a different personality. I<br>  <br>  've noticed that my birds will only mimic people that they like. My brother had a cockatiel that would only copy him, no one else. Maybe your parrot hasn't bonded with you. How much time do you spend around it? If you really want it to talk, spend lots of time with it. Choose something simple at first like hello or pretty boy. Say the word slowly then offer it it's faveourite treat, like a piece of apple. Do this for a least an hour each day and whenever your around your bird. If he picks it up, move on to something else a bit harder, if not try whistling. Wolf whistle is an excellent noise for a bird to learn. My cockatiel currently knows pop goes the weasel, bound for botany bay, wolf whistle and the AFL Crows team song. It might pick it up, it might not. Either way it is still an intelligent and beautiful creature.
EdBvqVuLaa	NO!! OF COURSE NOT!! That would be bad :\ well, not good to do. Buy shampoo made specifically for cats :)|`|RN1wGlWWaa	You can, if its once in awhile - I would only use high quality like Pantane or Nexxus (used Nexxus for my Cornish Rexes all the time).<br>  <br>  But its better to look for a good quality cat shampoo (NOT Hartz crap)|`|DlAOGBz5aa	No! You need to get cat shampoo from a pet shop.|`|le3zvYqJaa	The Ph of human shampoo is very different than the ph of a cats shampoo. Cats actually have more sensitive skin than we do! Human shampoo will dry out the Cats skin and make it very itchy and no fun for the kitty. <br>  <br>  The only exception is baby shampoo which has a very neutral PH (so's not to irritate the eyes) <br>  <br>  I usually use Johnson & Johnson on my guys just because I am very sensitive to many fragrances in shapoos|`|c77682b5c62add2ad00270af275f9a4eaa	yes it should be fine just don't wash the head ( let her do that)  he should be fine.  If you worried and need to wash the head get a no more tears kind.|`|3bf821ff353c216ffc93ff7a91b60828aa	I would use a tearless baby shampoo if you do.  Most cats generally do not do well with baths, so that would be better in case it gets in it's eyes.  Good luck!|`|yLiOgVEYaa	NO. make sure you get some stuff from the pet store or the vet.|`|IpzapGwgaa	I think that you should get either baby tearless shampoo or kitty cat shampoo. Human adult shampoo probably wouldn't be good for the cat and it might hurt her.|`|BFTjTpy9aa	There is cat shampoo you know <br>  ;3
sIpWVCItaa	you should take care of her. and just be her friend she can come and visit all the time. you don't have to do anything about her, if she isn't causing any trouble. you should teach her stuff and then when she goes back home one day the people who have her will be like "what the hell i didn't teach you that". thats what i'd do if i were bored enough.|`|0tenMcUmaa	if you dont mind her and she isnt causing a problem then dont do anything! its fine<br>  however if she is doing something you dont want her doing... go to your neighbors and politely ask them if they could just keep a more watchful eye on their dog so it doesnt go into your yard|`|GrYhFNMdaa	Whats the question? Is it a problem she is coming into the yard or is it her patients you have a issue with? <br>  If she visits you and you don't mind :) why not make friends and be an influence in her life :) If that's not what u were looking for. Maybe you could tell us more about your question|`|6ILILOtUaa	Funny.  No dogs are patient!  Only people are patient!  Give little Bubby love and your patience.  Dogs are incredible companions.
mCEKMWTYaa	Gentle leaders work great and they are NOT like a muzzle!  A dog can still eat, drink and bark with them on!|`|YdI0TLczaa	I trained all of my dogs with a choker collar. No, they are not cruel if you use them correctly. You loop the collar so it looks like a P (it should allow you to tighten with a tug and then loosen when you release), when the dog begins to walk ahead of you , yank on the leash (just enough to get the dog's attention) and say "heel". When the dog is beside you, give praise and continue walking. Repeat the process. Once doggie is walking beside you, keep praising. DO NOT just pull on the leash so it chokes your dog as he pulls. It should be a quick yank and release. I know some people are going to say it's barbaric but it works and works well. I've never used a gentle leader so I don't know how fast/well they work.|`|mgdkr6hvaa	it's a little hard to control dogs, but what you should try is to be the leader, be in the front. be the top dog.  <br>  maybe start by having the lease in hand but hold her collar and have her walk right next to you or even a little behind.  Practice this and maybe she'll learn to understand.|`|Cfk1kr8Daa	LOL - It's a Gentle Leader!<br>  <br>   That would probably work, and so would a good stint in an obedience course.|`|a8Pq2Lmdaa	I agree with the gentle leader.

It's hard to explain how to do it by this way, i've showed it to many people in person at the dog park because they usually have the same problem
6SeWCfUfaa	Before you get to pregnant to move ...<br>  <br>  I'd take the dog to a behaviorist/trainer and work on that.  Yes, Weimeraners can be very attached to their owners but all dogs should be able to go be a dog for a while without your assistance.  It is a behavioral problem.|`|RgYuXggfaa	Was he that way before you got pregnant?  I know that with my pregnancies all of my animals got very clingy with me.  Its a smell I guess.  After the babies where born they went back to normal.  Well after they got over being mad.|`|bzpUZkEDaa	mines just always happy, not necessarily clingy but he likes being near me but not on top of me|`|ktC40jtXaa	Oh ya, i have a 9 month old weimaraner who is very clingy. Im pretty sure this is just the breed. Mine loves to cuddle and i mean just like a little dog would ... rite on top of us..LOL. I have no idea how you could get him to be less clingy before the baby comes, but im sure he will figure out that when you have baby, he needs to stay away. Good luck with the clingy weim ...LOL|`|ErjSVRkqaa	If you are having trouble with the dog you have do NOT get another one...this will just add to the problems. Then your dog would have to share your attention with the baby AND another dog. I have a clingy Lab...we take her around kids all the time and she does great. Most likely, your Weimeraner will become very attached to the baby and want to protect the baby! :)
342b3711423c978836fa192cef3238d8aa	No.  And if he's licking them, the next thing he's going to do is chew them and rip them out.  The vet should have providing you with an elizabethan collar for your puppy to wear whenever he can't be watched and at nightto prevent that.  Please go back to the vet and get an E-collar because if your puppy has to be re-stitched, it means he needs to be put under anesthetic again.|`|bIaywrBCaa	It is really best that he not lick them. They could become infected. He could also bite the stitches out. Just watch him closely, wash the wound several times a day.|`|tmGRe2Jraa	Normally not, since licking can further irritate the wound, infect it, or damage the stitches.  Dogs stick their tongues in all sorts of unholy things, things that have no business coming into contact with an open wound.  That's why they make those stupid-looking paper cones to put on your dog's head after surgeries.  Did the vet who stitched your puppy give you any advice or specifically tell you that licking was fine?  I'd recommend calling him, but if for some reason you'd prefer not to, I'd err on the side of not-licking.|`|9ea79964f4ddad1359a8089c6729bb4caa	No. Licking the stitches can push bacteria into the wound and cause infection and some dogs lick/chew enough to even loosen or remove the stitches.|`|SqWJCZyeaa	No, he could open up the stitches with his tongue... which may lead to loads of other medical problems as you probably know. That's why your dog should get a cone. That helps prevent the dog from opening the wound.|`|ErjSVRkqaa	No, no, no! He could open up the stitches and that would be....well, of course not the greatest thing! Get a neck cone to prevent him from licking it or maybe some type of bandage.|`|20fqa5hCaa	It's not a good idea.  You should have your vet fit your puppy with a cone collar to keep him from being able to reach the stitches.  But remember, the puppy is going to be very awkward and vulnerable with the cone on.  Keep your older dog away.|`|UMnAJtQSaa	Absolutely not. The moisture and bacteria from his mouth will set him up for an infection or he very well could rip out his sutures. Get an e-collar from your vet.|`|Fmq1YEtyaa	well where are the stiches? BUt he shouldnt lick them cuz if his toungue gets caught it is painfully and he could take them out! so get a doggy cone and put it on him so he cant lick or bite them!
WPnMXP8paa	none, Tibetan Lhasa Apso|`|Bm3vyuNpaa	Yorkies are just adorable! They are loving, kind pups!|`|EeJMITyCaa	What about them?|`|AxaspNJJaa	Depends on your lifestyle. My best friend has a pomeranian and he barks a lot. My other best friend wants a yorkie, while her younger sister wants a maltese. My other best friend has a yorkie and he is really hyper. Takes a while to calm down. I say a maltese. I don't know anyone who owns one, but because of that, I'm recommending one for you.|`|7fGG81bfaa	i love all 3 but..<br>  maltese - laid back person<br>  yorkie- preppy <br>  pom- preppy<br>  <br>  i love all 3 but i have a lhasa apso (like a maltese) and i adore her!!!!!<br>   and i wanted a pom, but my friend was getting a yorkie but she didnt but i LOVEE them! try to get a yorkie pom mix or something :)|`|nPuZVGFRaa	Maltese-       <a href="http://www.dogbreedinfo.com/maltese.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.dogbreedinfo.com/maltese.htm</a><br>  <br>  Yorkie- <a href="http://www.dogbreedinfo.com/yorkshireterrier.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.dogbreedinfo.com/yorkshireter...</a><br>  <br>  Pomeranian- <a href="http://www.dogbreedinfo.com/pomeranian.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.dogbreedinfo.com/pomeranian.h...</a><br>  <br>  <br>  Theres info and pictures on them.|`|Gir6xL5waa	I have a pomeranian and she is black with hints of white which is a rare color and it depends if you have little kids small dogs would be good for kids the age of 14 and up for the safty of the dog and the child because small dogs can have bad tempers and can bit younger children like my chowawau, paplion, and pomeranian mix.|`|qqeus5kCaa	This depends on your family preference... I suggest you read up on all 3 character traits and decide what is best for your home...<br>  I would also look at long term health care for them deciding which breed is prone to what illness..... <br>  I prefer yorkies myself... <br>  for me Poms are too yippie and maltese's are sweet but are hard to keep clean. <br>  Maltese's and Yorkie's also require professional grooming (which is also an added expense)<br>  poms have long hair and need to be brushed daily and generally are not shaved like maltese's and yorkies
1Qh9i9cWaa	Actually, there are many, many different types of fish you can get for your 10g tank. I will list some choices for you.<br>  <br>  Betta Tank<br>  you can have one betta, male of female, (if you do get female,you might be able to get two females), a school of white clouds (3-5), two cory cats, and an oto cat for cleaning. This is a very nice, easy, peaceful tank with activities.<br>  <br>  Tetra tank<br>  I wouldn't really recommend this for a 10g tank, but it could work. The reason is because tetras like to be in larger school, so if you do get tetras, you will need to get only one specie. Get 8 of small, 1" tetras and two corys and one oto. That will be plenty, and have lots of liveplants in the back for safe spots. Tetras also like darker tank, so have dark subtrate with background papers on three sides. keep pH 6.4-6.8<br>  <br>  Asian (barb) Tank<br>  This can be pretty interesting-very similar to tetra tank, but it will have more activity. since these guys dont need as large school to keep each otehr feel safe, you might be able to squeeze in two species. If you get smaller barbs, such as cherry barbs, danios, you can fit two species, otherwise, if you decide to have larger barbs (tiger barbs) or rasboras, you will only be able to have one specie. It is because rasboras like larger school, and larger/aggressive barbs need at least 6-8 of them to stay less aggressive. Any less, and in this little tank, they will be too aggressive. Get total 8 of those (either 8 of a kind or 4 or two kinds), and 2-3 of siamese (not chinese!) algea eaters. They stay small-3" or so, and require the same water perimeter. keep pH at 7.0-7.4<br>  <br>  Livebearer Tank<br>  This tank will thrive with a little bit of marine salt, but Platies and Swordtails do not require any salt. Even though guppies will do very well in slightly brackish tank, they also do just as, or almost as, well in freshwater tank. The one thing you need to remember is to get ratio of 2-3 females per male. ideal pH is 7.2-7.6<br>  <br>  Cichlid Tank<br>  Cichlids can be a bit more challenging, but they are extremely popular and interesting to watch. If you would like to keep two or three, krib, cockatoo, or ram will work very well. If you are intending to keep only one, get one of african cichlid, or smaller south american cichlid. No larger ones, such as oscars, jack dempsey, angels, discus. They should be kept in a tank about 45g bare minimum. 55g+ is ideal for one.<br>  pH depends on each cichlid. Kribs, cockatoo, rams need their pH at newtral or a little acidic, and african cichlids need them at 7.4-7.8<br>  <br>  Corydoras do well with tetras and guppies...not with cichlids...<br>  <br>  Feel free to ask me any questions.|`|pcvcMePXaa	hmm you could get a female guppy and have a family or get some<br>  <br>  mollies<br>  swordtails<br>  neon tetras<br>  corydoras<br>  platys|`|28834ea3162329035a24ce080e7020edaa	Tetras and guppies get along very well.|`|4ap1GPvsaa	I would suggest putting in some neon tetra's or mollies, and for a cleaner fish try a corydora, corydora's are known to be one of the most efficient cleaner fish in the world so it can keep your tank at top quality (also please note, corydora's are happiest and most efficient in groups), also if you choose mollies, they are known to like to eat small quantities of algae that might build up on the glass, but anyways these are some great small starter fish.<br>  <br>  Have Fun<br>  ~Sencerly Cori~
JxmJg37Iaa	the appropriate age to mate hamsters is about 8 months, nothing younger than that or they may cannibalise there young and nothing older than a year or they may be infertiel or incapable to produce and care for young.

Cfk1kr8Daa	The best thing to do would be to move - Lucy is not safe there with a pack of coyotes on the other side of the fence, and it's not much of a home if you can't have your dog with you.<br>  <br>    In the meantime, a large crate in the garage with some heavy quilts over it, and hay inside would help to keep her warm.  I would also get her a jacket - look in the SmartPak or Dover Saddlery catalogs/websites for some reasonably priced fleece coats that could keep her warm.  She'll be better off confined to a crate, though, where she cannot get into things.  You should also get a piece of foam building insulation form Home Depot (it looks like a pink board) to put the crate on - it will insulate the bottom from the cold.<br>  <br>    As for the yard, make absolutely sure the fence is secure, and get an inexpensive electric fence unit in the form of a kit.  Install the wire on the inside of the fence, so Lucy does not go over it, but stays in your own yard where she will not get into trouble.<br>  <br>   And in the meantime, look for a new home where she can be inside with you, and outside, can have a safe chainlink enclosure with a dog house.|`|HEdGGmkhaa	A tired dog is a good dog!<br>  Exercise, a treadmill, lol just get ther energy out of her, Boxers have a lot.<br>  Also, crate her, it's for her benefit too, she wont hurt herself my eating something she shouldn't and your things wont be torn up.|`|sQOXjKFNaa	Lucy needs more attention from you.  Try walking with her before you put her to bed in the garage.  Make sure she is warm and do not place her bed on the hard cement. Straw works as a good insulator.  Give her plenty of water and place her in a crate.  The key is, ATTENTION!|`|iB22RWkGaa	You should find her a better home. If your landlord won't let you have her in the house you shouldn't have gotten her in the first place. She's not a car or a can of old paint. She doesn't belong in the garage.|`|zTeLhroWaa	She needs to be played with..often.  If you can't give her the attention she needs you may want to consider finding her a family that can and getting a dog with a little less energy.|`|7vJNHaskaa	Honestly, you should give her up for adoption. She needs to be part of a family, not a garage decoration. It might not be the best for you, but it'd be the best for her.|`|VkFDAQ46aa	Does anyone else think you should atleast be of a certain age before asking or answering a question???|`|6hvf02Eyaa	Well, I would say you have a bad situation! Walk your dog two or three times a day! I would also look into moving to a place where she can be indoors with her family, she gets bored  and lonely and trys to entertain herself, hopefully she cannot get into something poisonous or possibly fatal to her garages generally are not safe (antifreeze) and such.<br>  During the day do you have the coyote problems? Ours are only around at night or early eve so during the day play and run off her energy of course have her on a long lounge type line so you can easily keep her safe.<br>  But seriously that is a crappy way for a dog to have to live..Have you thought of re-homing her?|`|RN2Gsas7aa	Sounds like you might want to seriously consider rehoming your dog if moving is not an option. The coyotes are definately reason why she can't be outside, which is unfair to any dog. But the garage is not a good place either, especially if she likes to get into things like you say she does. Who knows what she will get into? Car oil? Anti-freeze? I know its hard to think about but you have to do what is best for the dog and not what you want to do because you love her.|`|b1461ee6cb21361aad22b1b0151b5104aa	it is not fair to keep her locked in the garage, would you keep a child locked in the garage? you should put her up for adoption where someone can let her in the house , and where she can  run around outside, think of you pet. sorry if that sounds rude but what else are you gonna do, leave the poor thing in the garage with no attention.|`|uKpkOss0aa	Do you even take her out to walk or play?  The reason I ask is that some dogs will jump fences and run off because they're bored.  They don't get walked or played with enough.  You really should do the smart thing and adopt her out to another home, a home where the people will have time to spend with her.  It sounds like where you live is also dangerous for a dog to be living.|`|7ViHb7cwaa	Honestly, as hard as it might be, the only option you really have is to give her up for adoption. I had to do the same with 2 of mine because I couldn't give them the environment they deserved, and because of that they acted out. They were wonderful dogs and were adopted from VHS immediately. It hurt, but I'm so grateful knowing that they are now in loving homes where they can exercise and get constant attention.|`|Lkik9Sr7aa	if she has to stay inside the garage all the time then it looks like she needs to be in a better home. she needs more excercise, freedom, and attention. its really not fair to the dog.|`|DeUuipSBaa	Give her tons of toys and a nice warm bed. When ever you can take her for a good run.  btw cute name!|`|3opisoDMaa	well you should keep her inside or if you can move those coyotes sound very dangerous|`|jZGg0gNKaa	Crate her and move.|`|wpdZR608aa	I would seriously think about finding a new home for your dog if moving is not a option for you, what I would like to know is did you landlord know that you had the dog before you moved in, the dog is not happy other wise it would not be doing the things which it is! it is hard letting go I don't doubt that you love your dog but the environment which she is in is not good for her having any kind of pet means being part of a family yes you need to give her rules and boundaries but she also needs love and interaction letting her live in the garage is just not good enough, you either need to move or do the right thing and let her go|`|PM23RDycaa	Rehome her to a new home or surrender her to a boxer rescue. Its the best thing for her. Its that or find a new place so she can be INSIDE and crated. The other problem is she does not get enough exercise.|`|bIaywrBCaa	Move or find her a home where she can be inside.|`|GSf09ALBaa	Start putting her in a kennel.  She is wrecking your garage because she is bored.  You can't keep her outside for the reasons you stated.<br>  So, buy a nice size kennel, put her there during the times you are not home and I strongly suggest you look into some place else to live because sooner or later those coyotes are going to kill her.|`|m4uDn0ofaa	She is a nuisance because she is board.  Give her more exersize, by this I mean 1 or 2 long walks (30 mins or more) a day, and give her lots of toys to play with.  If you can't do that you may need to think about rehoming her.  She is obviously not happy if she is constantly doing things to get attention.  Good luck.|`|Mrkdm6Wyaa	find her a better home.<br>  <br>  stop being selfish and caring about your needs for having an animal companion. if you really want what's best for your dog, then you'll put it with a happy home that will treat it with care and play with it.<br>  <br>  you will probably be stubborn and never give up your dog, but your dog is probably miserable. save lucy's life by giving her a better one.|`|CaQTKNKyaa	Why have you got a dog in the first place. get her in to a new home.

Just keep a good eye on him and make sure he doesn't start throwing up or having diarrhea.|`|NlvghuIkaa	He will be completely fine. As others have mentioned lead is no longer used in pencils, instead a harmless stick of what look like lead has replaced it... graphite. It is amazing what will pass through a dogs stomach though. <br>  <br>  My dog has been in that position for a while now. He hasn't yet matured and in the meantime has managed to swallow ruler parts, pencils and even pen lids. Still alive and healthy going though we are working quite hard on his behaviour.|`|qUeNrusdaa	You're dog should be absolutely fine.  Pencil lead is actually graphite and shouldn't harm your dog.  However, it may give him diarrhea for a couple days.  I suspect he's tired only as the result of normal daily activity.|`|qQsFTkWmaa	its not lead.. its graphite..<br>  <br>  no worrys just a tired puppy from all the mistife|`|70856ea555b8a0486ac334cf3f8dd442aa	don't worry about it pencil lead is just harmless carbon
tPGxPDvBaa	Ask groomer to do them if they need it. Usually only small dogs have the most issues with glands. Most dogs take care of glands on their own for the most part. I have never done my dogs' glands but almost always have to do my clients small dogs glands for every grooming. Here is a great site about glands if you want to read up on them.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.marvistavet.com/html/body_anal_sacs.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.marvistavet.com/html/body_ana...</a>|`|RDsZFfLOaa	some dogs do need there anal glands expressed quiet often. where i work we have a pug come in every month to get her anals expressed. Most of the time they do it themselfs but some dogs lack the ability to do it. You can have them surgically removed if you wished. it probaly is a good idea to get them expressed when you go to the groomers every 8 weeks that woulnt hurt anything. and its better to be safe because one dog came into our clinic and his anal glands pretty much exploded because they havent been expressed in a long time<br>  <br>  hope this helps|`|AA12089188	most of the time they express them by there selves but every once in a while they wont. Most groomers check them and do it for you anyways.|`|bIaywrBCaa	vets and groomers will tell you it needs to be done monthly or several times a year. They actually creat problems by doing them much too often. After 40+ yr of owning dogs, I have only had 2 that ever had a problem with the anal glands. None of mine ever have theirs expressed UNLESS there is a problem. If it ain't broke, don't fix it. Chihuahuas are one of the breeds that vets and groomers do most often and the only 2 dogs I have ever had a problem with were chihuahuas. But I have owned chihuahuas most of my life. Seldom do they have a problem if they are left alone.
6SeWCfUfaa	Ok, Oliver probably isn't scared of the dogs, you've created a trigger for him though.  Every time a dog shows up, you pick him up ... these little guys are smart so, when he sees dogs, he automatically thinks, oh, time for me to be picked up.  You don't want to keep up with that.  Or he'll do it his entire life.  And, trust me that will get old and it's not good for him.  He needs to be socialized and learn how to walk on his leash around other dogs eventually.  (Granted, he's just a baby right now and you don't want anything to happen, but not having to pick him up should be a goal.)<br>  <br>  But I don't blame you for being a little jumpy about off-leash dogs.  I'm all grown up and my dog is a big grown up, 55lb Aussie and even I keep my eye on any other dogs I see while I'm out walking.  That said, if you see dogs running lose, you should get a description of the dog, where you saw it and call animal control to come pick it up.<br>  <br>  Call every day if you have to and keep giving them the descriptions and locations of the dogs you see running loose.  If you walk with a friend, have them call and report the dogs too.|`|Fmq1YEtyaa	call animal patrol! i hate it when ppl post things on yahoo answers without calling the vet if its a serious sickness or something like this that  could save ur dogs life or urs! i hate those kind of ppl! but u should call animal control or go the oppisite direction!|`|V5ZpqRs8aa	Call animal control and if one does attack you I know this may seems harsh but kind of knee it away from you. or like hip check it so that it doesn't get close to your puppy.|`|9EAW8PXkaa	You need to call animal control and have them come pick them up so they can bring them to a shelter and find there owners.|`|imKCvvFKaa	never look at these dogs in the eyes, it's a challenge to them, also never run away either, keep walking and keep a straight walking angle, like you're top dog or something and if your pup stops walking, pull at him and continue walking, show him there's nothing to be afraid of, he can sense you're scared, so he is too. take your puppy to the dog park too, this could help to show him there are nice sociable dogs out there. you should've gotten a bigger dog, like a german shepherd or a larger austrailian shepherd(for where you live). i know how you feel, i live in a neighborhood like that too and when i got my GSD he use to be scared, now those dogs are scared of him. everytime i'd train him in the backyard, the huskies(my neighborhood is filled with huskies) bark at him and he use to take it, now he barks back and they shut up.|`|vuEyUbsgaa	call animal control

I am not aware that walnuts are poisonous to dogs? It is more the walnut hulls.<br>  <br>   Walnuts. When dogs eat the seed hulls, they can get an upset stomach and diarrhea. The real problem is the fungus or mold that attacks walnuts after they get wet (from rain or sprinklers), which produces toxins. If the fungus or mold is ingested by your dogs, they can become very ill and possibly die. Signs that should alert you to walnut poisoning are vomiting, trembling, drooling, lack of coordination, lethargy, loss of appetite, and jaundice indications such as yellowing eyes and gums. Severely affected dogs can produce blood-tinged vomit or stools. Dogs can take several days to exhibit serious signs of illness.|`|GSf09ALBaa	She should be fine.

If these symptoms show up call the vet right away. See the link below for more info on foods poisonous to dogs.|`|u4WU01EXaa	Probably not the best thing to feed a dog I know that macadamias are very toxic as well. They contain a certain oil that can very fatal if too much is consumed, keep an eye on him strong stomach or not. Hope this helps|`|DeUuipSBaa	no they are not posinious|`|Td3Azeabaa	Avocados (fruit, pit, and plant) are toxic to dogs. Avocados contain a toxic component called persin, which can damage heart, lung and other tissue in many animals. They are high in fat and can trigger stomach upset, vomiting and even pancreatitis. Symptoms of toxicity include difficulty breathing, abdominal enlargement, abnormal fluid accumulations in the chest, abdomen and sac around the heart. The amount that needs to be ingested to cause signs is unknown. The effects on dogs and cats are not completely understood. GI signs are commonly seen and should be treated symptomatically. In addition, the animal should be monitored closely for other clinical signs related to the cardiovascular system. (This information comes from veterinarians, the American Veterinary Medicine Association, and the ASPCA Animal Poison Control Center.) <br>  <br>   Onions destroy red blood cells and can cause anemia, weakness, and breathing difficulty. Even small amounts can cause cumulative damage over time. This includes onions or chives - raw, powdered, dehydrated, or cooked. <br>  <br>   Large amounts of garlic cause the same problems as onions. Garlic contains only a small amount of the problematic substance that is in onions. Just as with people, moderation is the key. <br>  <br>   Grapes and raisins can cause kidney failure in dogs. As little as a single serving of raisins can kill him. If the dog doesn't eat enough at one time to be fatal, he can be severely damaged by eating just a few grapes or raisins regularly. <br>  <br>   Tomatoes (plant and fruit) contain tomatine, an alkaloid related to solanine. As the fruit ripens, the tomatine is metabolized. Therefore, ripe tomatoes are less likely to be problematic for animals. Clinical signs of poisoning include lethargy, drooling, difficulty breathing, colic, vomiting, diarrhea or constipation, widely-dilated pupils, paralysis, cardiac effects, central nervous system signs (e.g., ataxia, muscle weakness, tremors, seizures), resulting from cholinesterase inhibition, coma and death. (This information comes from veterinarians, and the ASPCA Animal Poison Control Center.) (All parts of the plant except the tomato itself are poisonous to humans, although some people are sensitive to the ripe fruit also.) <br>  Tomatoes also contain atropine, which can cause dilated pupils, tremors, and heart arrhythmias. The highest concentration of atropine is found in the leaves and stems of tomato plants, with less in unripe (green) tomatoes, and even less in ripe (red) tomatoes.<br>  <br>   Nutmeg can cause tremors, seizures and death. <br>  <br>   Caffeine (from coffee, coffee grounds, tea, or tea bags) stimulates the central nervous and cardiac systems, and can cause vomiting, restlessness, heart palpitations, and even death within hours. <br>  <br>   Diet products containing the sweetener Xylitol can cause a sudden drop in blood sugar, resulting in depression, loss of coordination and seizures. Unless treatment is given quickly, the dog could die. <br>  <br>   Macadamia nuts can cause weakness, muscle tremor and paralysis. These symptoms are usually temporary. <br>  <br>   Walnuts. When dogs eat the seed hulls, they can get an upset stomach and diarrhea.

Severely affected dogs can produce blood-tinged vomit or stools. Dogs can take several days to exhibit serious signs of illness. <br>  <br>   Chocolate can cause seizures, coma and death. Baker’s chocolate is the most dangerous. The darker the chocolate, the more dangerous it is. But any chocolate, in large enough amounts, can kill a dog. An ounce of chocolate can poison a 30-pound dog, and many dogs will happily consume more than this. The symptoms may not show up for several hours (and so might make you think all is well), with death following within twenty-four hours. A dog can consume milk chocolate and appear to be fine because it is not as concentrated, but it is still dangerous. <br>  <br>   Apple seeds, cherry pits, peach pits, pear pips, plums pits, and apricot pits contain cyanide, which is poisonous. While a few apple seeds may not cause a problem, the effects can accumulate over time if they are given to dogs regularly. Dogs should not be allowed to chew on a peach pit, cherry pit, apricot pit, or plum pit. Chewing can allow ingestion of cyanide. Chewing could also result in the pit being swallowed, causing continuous exposure to cyanide, or could cause the dog to choke. <br>  <br>   Too much salt can cause kidney problems. Also, large breeds of dogs that eat salty food may then drink too much water and develop bloat, which is fatal unless emergency treatment is given very quickly. <br>  <br>   Too much fat or fried foods can caus

CkecSp4Uaa	I hate to tell you, but it is almost guaranteed to be you.  The fact that you say training "did not seem to work," indicates either that you choose a poor trainer or that YOU did not do much to follow instructions and correct the problem.  If she is aggressive and truly biting people, then you NEED to call your vet and as them for a referral to a behaviorist.  NOT just a "trainer," but someone who has experience and the training in working with aggressive dogs.  Bulldogs are NOT a "docile breed," the breed originally was bred to attack enraged BULLS...nothing about that job is docile.  While today's bulldogs do not have such a "hard" temperament as the original breed (since it has been decades since they've had to do their original work and the breed has undergone such a change that it barely resembles the original dogs) they are still hard-headed dogs that require a firm, consistent owner to avoid behavioral problems.  The fact that bulldogs are very popular also means that many bulldogs are being bred by irresponsible "breeders" for money and poor temperaments and aggression are becoming more common in the breed because of this.|`|BDRIeLqUaa	seek advice from your vet- they should check for any medical reason for the change-and can rcmd. a beharioral consult<br>  do not take to the "pound" she will be put down due to aggression- they won't adopt out a ticking time bomb|`|2c844fcf526bc2b90f16b7c425e11aa7aa	You need to call in a well qualified behaviourist to assess your dog.|`|AA11887983	Find a veterinary behaviorist.  They may be able to help you.  But by this time, the behavior may be ingrained.  Don't forget that this is an animal that has already bitten a child.  Just consider that some behavior patterns are set in place long before you get the dog, and at 3months, there is always the possibility that this has happened.  Also, sexual maturity can bring on a whole new set of problems.  If she is not spayed, get her spayed NOW.  <br>  <br>  Be careful, and if you decide to enter training with a behavior specialist, you need to be 100% committed.  This is not something that can be done halfway.  <br>  Good luck, and I sure hope you find a way to help her.|`|dlqa6yFkaa	Wow, I wonder if she is in pain, is she off her food or lost any weight? I would be taking her to a vet and having her checked out so you can eliminate any medical problem that may be causing her pain that she is displaying as aggression.<br>  <br>  In my experience with Bull dogs (I've had 2 and now have Bobby <---) I have never had one that showed aggression towards me or my family or people they see regularly. Bobby is particularly protective of all that he considers his and I feel he would fight to the death for us. Sally the first female I owned would not get out of her own way to save herself. Having said all this they require a strong hand and must have a dominant owner, one who means what they say and rules the pack. If I tell Boddy to get off the lounge, he has to get off, not just sit and think about doing it. I think you need to go back to the beginning and set up the boundaries. I use lots of praise, a choker chain, lead, a spray bottle of water and a firm 'No' to establish what is acceptable and what is not. Keep her on a lead and choker chain when aggression could be problem, if she shows signs of aggression give the lead  a short sharp yank, say NO in a really cranky voice and spray her in the face with the water, she won't like it but it will show her you are the boss and don't like that kind of behaviour.<br>  See how you go but you need to rule out any medical cause.|`|zltJwdYyaa	well i had the same problem with my chihuahua... and i don't recommend abuse. well that's all i can tell you, since my chihuahua is kinda small...|`|0fKQhIX0aa	have you spoken with a canine behaviorist? something major is going on.  with a lot of dogs their behavior can drastically change when they mature.  also can you get a muzzle to stay on her? it may be a good idea to get her used to it and walk her with it.  keep her in a different room or in a crate when someone comes over.  in my state we have a dangerous dog law and in some cases the state will grant the officials to euthanize a dog that is a public safety concern.  please be careful and explore all of your options.|`|4c047641be778d779abfa8ec0d667d8caa	Problems like these with a young dog can be solved, but it takes time and dedication.<br>  I do not know what methods the other trainer used so I can not say why it didn't help.

Most breeders (98%) breed not only for looks but also for reliability in their breed, meaning they will act according to their breed. Most Bulldogs are very laid back so thats why I was asking about breeding. Another thing is if she is going through heat, sometimes dogs gets weird as the hormones flow. <br>  Sometimes, and we are to blame here at our house, a dog gets treated to well more like a kid and then it acts like it is the boss. Our own dog is like this and we have to watch him all the time with people other than family because he owns us and does not want anyone around us..thankfully we live on a farm so he is not a danger to anyone..as he goes nuts when someone drives down the lane..<br>  If I were you try the breeder if not then you have to really analze why you want this dog. When a dog bites, it is breaking the trust code with humans..and there are a lot of good dogs that need homes and would never dream of biting..
CkecSp4Uaa	Vets can not dispense heartworm medication without a negative heartworm test because if your dog is positive and takes the medication it can cause serious, even deadly, complications.  Also, dispensing heartworm preventative without a negative heartworm test voids the manufacturer's guarantee, meaning that if your dog does get heartworm the manufacturer will refuse to pay for any of the treatment (most manufacturers will pay for all treatments if there is proof that your dog has been on heartworm preventative year-round...meaning a receipt from the vet accounting for a monthly pill).  Most vets will start puppies on heartworm preventative at their first visit because at 8 weeks of age if they have any heartworms it is usually only larval worms and because they got them from their mother.  Since those worms did not go through an intermediate host (the mosquito) it is physically impossible for them to mature into adult heartworms.  Any heartworm larvae that may have been picked up through a mosquito bite before 8 weeks of age will not have had enough time to develop into adult worms and therefor will not be a problem for the preventative medication.  It takes 6 months for heartworm larvae to mature into adult worms and start producing larvae of their own.  Because of this, and the fact that no heartworm preventative is 100% effective, all puppies should be tested at 6 months of age and then yearly afterwards.  Many vets are also using heartworm tests that catch diseases other than heartworm.  My vet uses a 3-way test that tests for lyme disease and ehrlichiosis (another tick-borne disease) in addition to the heartworm.  My dogs have never tested positive for heartworm, but one of my dogs has tested positive for both of the tick-borne diseases.|`|cDuiMcgOaa	The new vet needs to know if your dog is heart worm negative even if they have the record. the cannot give you the heartguard until you get the dogs blood test.|`|0fKQhIX0aa	did you take your previous vet records with you to the new vet? <br>  <br>  usually pups are started on heartworm medicine.  when they are about 1 year (or their first yearly exam) the vet will do a 3dx test that checks for heartworms, lyme disease and ehlichia (another tick born disease).  if there is a chance that a dose is missed or late (or no previous history) a vet will suggest to do the test before the prescription is refilled.   sometimes they will have a waiver that you can sign against the test. just depends|`|UMnAJtQSaa	Having records faxed over from your previous vet is helpful. In regards to a heartworm test, puppies can be started on heartworm preventative before 6 months of age without a blood test. Dogs cannot be given a preventative if they are older than that or have missed more than a month of their heartworm medication because the adult heartworms would be killed and could lodge into the lungs, brain or clog up blood vessels. This, of course, would not be a good thing. If your puppy has been on heartworm preventative since 6 months of age without missing a month your new vet should not have a problem with that if you have documentation of a prescription from your previous vet. This will tell them how old your dog is at the time of the prescription and how many months you were given.|`|342b3711423c978836fa192cef3238d8aa	Dogs can't get meds for heartworm until they've been tested and they're shown to be negative for heartworm.

You can manage to shift it though if you bug your cat to play all day, then at night she'll be too sleepy to stay up.

0f35e35fc374dea3ca1e2b585d13080caa	If you got your puppy from a breeder, then call the breeder and ask them to give you the shot record, you can take the puppy to get shots from a vet, they cost between 50-100 dollars plus the office visit fee, so it gets costly. Some people give their pets their own shots, but rabies has to be done by a vet in most states. Feed stores and stores like tractor supply sell the vaccines for under 10 dollars and each shot covers over 5 diseases and you can ask a employee at either one of these stores and they can tell you how to give the injection, most people who work in these types of stores have had experience in giving shots to horses and other farm animals and dogs and cats too.<br>  <br>  In the future if you buy a puppy from a breeder ask about shot records and worming records too, a responsible breeder  does give records.|`|vUiUoamVaa	You didn't say where the puppy came from -- ask the person you got it from.

Even my Alba came with a medical history and I got her from the pound.|`|4AoMi1NLaa	It might cost a lot but i guess u will have to take it to a vet to get it checked out but yeah apart from that i don't know how u are going to tell|`|K2QwEM4raa	If I was in any doubt I would talk to the vet and I'm pretty sure that he will just go ahead and give shots to the puppy, to be on the safe side.!|`|6R3sJTKQaa	ask the ppl were u got him or her from<br>                <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  hi|`|gT6tpcbbaa	you cant tell . your gunna haft to put it down old school ..... bang!!!|`|GviPu9vmaa	shave it
sIpWVCItaa	if there is too much mist in there, or its too hot or cold that could affect it. its just not going to eat if its too off. sometimes they just have wierd eating habbits. rose haired tarantulas are known for that. if its abdomen isn't shrinking up alot then it should be fine. it can go a long time and be stuborn about eating. im not saying you shouldn' worry. but chances are its somthing that spider does normally anyways. hope the little thing lives, good luck =]|`|Ro4H1kT8aa	mine didnt eat and we took him too the vet...next day hes dead so id get him 2 a vet a.s.a.p!
Bhgx0M1Uaa	It's easy get a humidifier gage make sure that it reads 50% when ever it falls below that spray the cage down and wait until the gage reads at 50 I promise it's that easy. Good Luck!|`|hQQuqyYcaa	Depends on the tarantula....Four times a day sounds like a bit much, but you should spray the cage according to what the humidity is inside. Notice that the humidity is getting a bit low? Give it a spritz. But please make sure that you know the humidity levels needed for your tarantula.
oMmBhWK4aa	This highlights the need for aquarists to have some emergency response capability, never assume nothing will go wrong. <br>  <br>  Your problem is making do with what you have since your shops aren't open yet. What other equipment do you have on hand? Any small internal power filter or even air pump driven airstone or sponge filter that can fit into the bucket? Ideally an internal filter which you can fill with some existing biological filter media from your established tank or filter. Any ammonia removal solution? Something like Seachem's Prime not only conditions water but also removes ammonia & detoxifies nitrites & nitrates, just the thing for emergencies. You can also try activated carbon or zeolite.<br>  <br>  Any way to fabricate a larger container? Clean new large garbage bags fitted over something that can hold the weight & shape? This is the time to think out of the box. Clean styrofoam containers or cooler boxes?<br>  <br>  If you managed to get through this crisis & save your fishes, you've to start planning for any future repeats. Get <br>  - a small backup tank, <br>  - brand new large buckets or other containers that you mark "Do Not Use" to prevent others from ruining them with chemicals,<br>  - established biological media that you can transfer to a small filter that fits your above containers,<br>  - alternative is concurrently run a small sponge filter in your tank and use that in an emergency<br>  - have air pump & air stone as backup, besides electrical one also get a portable battery operated one in case of power cuts<br>  - have water conditioners that can neutralise ammonia & other toxins, get some activated carbon & zeolite on standby<br>  - consider any other measures for emergencies eg. medication for common diseases, ways to cool or warm the tank as necessary etc.<br>  <br>  Hope you get through this ok, best of luck!|`|hQQuqyYcaa	The best way is to actually freeze them. It slows the heart and eventually stops it. They are coldblooded, so it's not like they will be shivering until their death. This is the cheapest, most humane way. I've had to do this a few times to fish who were sick and not getting better through numerous treatments. Some fish just hang on for a long time, but you can tell that they are suffering. A few people have told me to just take them out of the water...but it's more cruel to have them suffocate than to freeze.|`|nbtVuFVNaa	many good ideas...cool their temp to slow them down it should slow the ammonia output to dont freeze them tho... get a storage bin or a couple more buckets or 10 gal tanks...not cheap but u gotta do wat u gotta do...oh and for a temp fix go to home depot or walmart and get some acrilic sealent!|`|mbNWBem6aa	Couldn't you try putting them in a bigger container? <br>  Like a bathtub, or go out and buy a large plastic bin. <br>  <br>  You don't have to kill them all.|`|zWBYxMvWaa	The way you kill seafood quickly, dip their heads head first into a pot of boiling water.<br>  <br>  <br>  That way they are killed instantly without pain.|`|b4751c132f82aabe6e11b8e5a37225b5aa	Bowls, pots ,deep pans or bath tub  we had to do this a couple of times<br>  <br>  As Munch said bathtub or go to Wallmart and get a plastic storage tub about $12-15|`|28834ea3162329035a24ce080e7020edaa	What about a 24 hour store that sells even a 10 gallon tank?|`|MPOHHTtAaa	Aw, I'm sorry for your fishies. :( Sorry I don't know what to do either.|`|aB4N5oVnaa	I'm thinkin fish fry, it's a win- win|`|kvBdTLOMaa	are any still alive? right now??|`|1yI9zBMQaa	I wouldn't.<br>  <br>  As soon as you can I would go get a few buckets. If you really need to, you can get them at the dollar store. A buck a bucket, there you go.<br>  If that's what you need to do to keep the fish, why not do it?<br>  It's hard, yes. But it's better than killing your fish. To just end their lives because of this is irresponsible and stupid.<br>  <br>  I'd say get more buckets, or even one of those big rubbermaid or sterilite storage bins. They're around 15 dollars for a big, clear one. You can buy two, save your fish, and then you wont have to do so many water changes.|`|4ap1GPvsaa	OK LISTEN UP<br>  <br>  I am an expert with fish, and if you want to have a remote chance of saving your fish DO EXACLY WHAT I SAY AND NOTHING DIFFERENT<br>  <br>  Give your bathtup a quick scrub with a cloth SOAKED IN HOT WATER that has NO SOAP OR DETERGENTS on it as an attempt to reduce chemicals in the tub, then take anything out of the tub such as any matts u might have in it, now fill your tub with water and make sure its at approx. 70-71 F and then use any kind of INSTANT AQUARIUM CONDITIONER to make the water safe for fish, then WAIT FIVE MINUTES and then put your fish in, this could result in saving your remaining fish.<br>  <br>  SO IF YOU WANT TO SAVE YOUR FISH FOLLOW THOSE DIRECTIONS EXACLY.<br>  <br>  P.S (I suggest also trying to get a filter into the bathtub)<br>  <br>  Hope This Helps<br>  And Good Luck<br>  ~Sencerly Cori~<br>  <br>  Also Dale after this is over i would suggest maybe setting up a 20 gallon aquarium or heck even a 10 gallon aquarium for if this kind of thing happens again, right now if any of my tanks get in an emergency ive got quite a few other tanks, so its a great thing to have. This could save all of your fish if this happened again. Also with an emergency tank i would suggest putting a strong filteration system into it to handle many big fish.<br>  <br>  Also i really hope your remaining fish will be ok, i know how it feels to have an emergency happen like that because once when i started keeping fish my tanks ammonia levels went through the roof, some of my fish died but i got them into my 10 gallon as fast as i could.<br>  <br>  Anyway like i said, i hope your remaining fish will be ok, ill pray for them.<br>  <br>  ~Sencerly Cori~<br>  <br>  Aw im really sorry about your fish, also i wasn't 100% sure if the bathtub idea would work but i figured under the circumstances it was probably the best shot u had at keeping any alive.<br>  <br>  Anyways im really sorry about ur fish.<br>  <br>  ~Sincerly Cori~|`|L9WZJw2paa	Yea try to get some extra buckets from walmart since they are always open.  Then first thing in the morning call your local fish store, and ask if they can temporarily house your fish.  I know many fish stores will do this for you especially if they know the circumstances.
GrYhFNMdaa	I don't think it would hurt them unless they ate it. but if you want to be extremely safety continuous go with a all natural cleaner or plan dove dish soap in water. I guess if the floor is still wet and your pets walk on it and then lick there paws, it might bother them and depending on the amount it could make them sick. There is a big boom in all natural products so they are not hard to find :)

The short coat and spots over the eye are signs that it's a Doberman, while the overall color pattern looks like a Dobie. Also, uncropped Dobermans' tails do curl. The GSD comes through in the prick ears and the light tan color. <br>  <br>  These breeds aren't as big as you think--a female is generally around 24 inches tall, which is a little above knee height.<br>  <br>  edit: I'm glad I only said I was 90% sure. Now I agree with Tulip; it's probably a Kelpie. It might even be purebred.|`|GSf09ALBaa	German Shepherd/Rottweiler mix.  Before a Rottie's tail is docked, it curls.  And not all GS have big ears.  And since she is a mix, the smaller ears could come from the Rottie.<br>  <br>  That's what I think.|`|71i6IjdZaa	Kelpie X for sure, I think she may have German Shepard in her aswell, but she has the Kelpies size, and German Shepard's colour:)<br>  xx|`|ErjSVRkqaa	Shiba Inu X German Shepherd.

Maybe he's just not used to his surroundings. If this behavior continues, ask the people from the shop you bought him from.|`|A2IDiIpIaa	Hello, first of all everything seems to be going right so congratulations. However, he is probably shy and skittish because he does not have a cage mate. Rats are extremely social animals and should ALWAYS be kept in groups of 2 or more (link for a good video:<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cDy3bMRuobE)" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cDy3bMRuo...</a> this is the main reason he is skittish. The main thing with rats is when you pick them up if you are unsure or are not firm they get scared that they will drop and try to get away. Swiftly pick them up from the bottom or side (from above feels like a predator) and put them on your shoulder. Move to a good area, like a bed, and let them run around on you and on the bed. <br>  Do this often and it just takes time, but you will bond very closely with your rat.<br>  Please consider getting another rat.<br>  Hope I helped<br>  My three rats (Sugar, Dash and Pepper)<br>  Approve this information and say get him a friend!<br>  Hope I helped.|`|6JNswOpbaa	just give him time.|`|JcOOvjIZaa	well possible he feels much safer in his cage than out. Knowing that he is surrounded by it, and plus he probably knows his cage much better than your room. I would lay with him on my bed and just pet him and let him get acquainted with me and he will probably get more attached. and the picking up part i would pick him up and hold him real good so he will know that i am not their to harm him.

K2QwEM4raa	Make sure she is at least drinking some water and I would take her back to the vet if it has been a couple of days since you went for the infection. She may need something else. Better safe than sorry. Because I think after a couple of days on med's she should be better than what you say. I am not a vet but this is my opinion.|`|AA11457471	The constipation is normal. The infection however, is not & it sounds like that's the problem.<br>  <br>  Push fluids like low sodium/ low fat chicken broth, tuna juice...whatever.<br>  Try feeding her some boiled chicken, plain yogurt...think outside the box.<br>  <br>  You should also keep an eye on her temperature. Rectally is the only precise way. Normal is 100-101F. If it goes beyond 102 start wiping her down with a damp towel & call your vet right away<br>  <br>  You should start seeing a response to the antibiotics within 3 days. If you don't see significant improvement by then or if she stops eating/ drinking altogether, call sooner.<br>  <br>  I'd also ask about pain relief if none's been prescribed.|`|qSMF6QIYaa	My dog did the same. And she was mad at us for spaying her.  give her time, and extra love.<br>  <br>  Dogs will feel that you took them to a scary place where people hurt her.  So she'll be sad and angry about it.<br>  <br>  but if the non-eating continues, ( maybe 2-3 days with the medicine) take her back to the vet.|`|9G03aQhsaa	The constipation was normal...probably caused by the anesthesia.  She's probably still in some pain, especially if she has an infection so that could be part of the reason why she's not eating, but it sounds like the infection is the real problem.   Infections are a common risk of surgery.  Follow your vet's instructions and contact them right away if she seems worse.  Other than that just give her pleanty of love and make sure she is drinking enough water so she does not get dehydrated.   Good luck!|`|t2M1kXY4aa	Not eating for a day or maybe 2 days after surgery ... that's normal.<br>  <br>  Not eating for a WEEK?  That is NOT normal.  <br>  <br>  I think you need to call your vet AGAIN and explain what's going on ... and DEMAND to have your dog seen.  If your vet won't accomodate you, see a different vet from the one who spayed your dog.  She might have an infection of some sort, or it might be another issue altogether.|`|OnZDg0AEaa	hi,<br>  <br>  Spaying or neutering will keep your dog from getting pregnant or impregnating another dog.

rPZFgiwLaa	The best advice is to get him to a vet right away.<br>  My neighbor had this problem with his dog some years ago by leaving a shock collar on his dog's neck, which left two large, infected holes on the front of his neck.  He didn't want to take it to a vet because he was afraid the vet was going to lecture him about using the shock collar, so he tried to treat the infection on his own.  After 2 days, his dog began to get really lethargic and my neighbor finally took him into the vet when his dog became unconscious and had to be euthanized.  The vet told him the infection had quickly spread into his vital organs so it was too late to do anything for him.|`|eEeCIRDaaa	Vet is the best idea, smell is a good sign to a bad infection, but if you are looking for a home solution put rubbing alcohol on the wound instead of vaseline, and if at all possible you should try to construct some sort of cone to prevent the dog from licking the wound.  Also remember that it is good for it to drain.|`|70878cc978ee2e4a79b3b53284340f9caa	Vaseline will not help an infection.Pus and a bad smell are signs that the infection is bad.The dog needs to see a vet and be put on antibiotics.How would you feel if you had pus coming out of your neck? Have some common sense and take the dog to the vet! If you won't take it,then clean the wound with peroxide,wipe it clean with a paper towel and apply Betadine Ointment three times a day.But the dog needs antibiotics. I cannot understand people who will not take their sick animals to a vet.Why do you get animals of you're going to neglect them? And tell your Dad that in many communities,it is considered a crime to deprive an animal of veterinary care.|`|GrYhFNMdaa	Call the vet and ask the same question. Chances are they will tell you to bring you dog in right away. don't put anything on it because you don't know what it will do, how it will feel. Plz see a vet|`|BpKECFBSaa	Dont put vaseline on it because you want the area to be dry. He definatley has an infection, and you need to take him to the vet ASAP!|`|4sc7bMbkaa	take your dog to vet|`|8FdOfT11aa	Take him to the vet.  Infections need antibiotics and you can only get those from your vet.  If you can't afford a vet, check out your SPCA or get a CareCredit credit card.  The SPCA offers low cost clinics, the CareCredit card can be used for any doctor visit (yours, dad's, or the dog's), and some vets can offer a payment plan.  But definitely take him to the vet and try to get him to stop licking!|`|mFLL37M5aa	You need to take your dog to the vet cause infection can set in when they have open wounds.  Don't put anything on it until you have been advised to by a licensed professional please.

I'm his second home and I've had him since he was 5 months old. It's just his personality and you'll just have to love him for it. He will probably become more of a cuddle bug as he becomes an old man rat like mine is doing. He still doesn't like to stay with me to long though.|`|C75EsUXRaa	I am inclined to disagree with other answers, as having had him a year he should be tamer, my opinion is that he wasn't handled enough when first aquired because he was the skittish one, but as long as you can do a bit with himits no matter now just if you get more later on, handle handle regardless of how jumpy they are|`|6JNswOpbaa	i would just say it is how he is.. if he is letting you touch him.. and hold him he must trust you now and it might just be the way he is around people.|`|JxIKUC9baa	Sometimes its just the way they are or when you go out to see them or them up try not scare them .

NGmRMqe6aa	If your girl is that big you can cut holes in a box big enough for little one to get away from big one. This will keep little one safe as they become acquainted.Make sure the box is big enough that big one can't just reach in and drag little one out by the ear. Invest in some cat nip and see if you can destress big one. There are all kinds of distressing sprays found at the pet store for big one. If they are just vocalizing and there is no blood drawn you can let them work it out. I can understand with her history of abuse. Just don'tt give up on trying to change her attitude. When she attacks cry ouch loudly. She won't like the noise. The sudden attacks can be untrained if you work with her. Get a toy like a laser light or fish pole and play with her until she is exhausted. Then pet her. Or when you have tired her out try brushing her with a very soft bristled hair brush. This will take time but as she gets used to being brushed, your are training her to accept you touching her. After a little time all my cats loved to be brushed it' s part of mutual grooming. When you are loving her, touch her gently all over. Pet her ears to toes. Let her get used to having her feet touched. A hair brush is good because it doesn't bleed. When she attacks it let her have it to kill. With lots of patience you can teach her that you do not hurt her when you touch her.|`|plx2v4S4aa	It's amazing that the older cat is people friendly after all the abuse and being wild for 5 years! <br>  <br>  It is vitally important that the introductions be taken slowly. I recently adopted a large male cat from a shelter and it has taken 6 months for my two existing female cats and him to get along. He is twice their size and kept on chasing and bullying them. They are adults so just imagine how much worse it would be for a kitten. <br>  <br>  My new male cat also attacks my ankles one minute then is the most loving creature the next. Cats can lash out if you pet them too long. That's the only way they can tell you "enough".<br>  <br>  You might want to try putting the older cat in a cage in the same space as the kitten so they get used to seeing each other but she can't attack the smaller one.<br>  <br>  You could also prop the bedroom door open just a crack so they can see each other but can't fight.<br>  <br>  Hope this helps. I had no idea it would take so long for mine to adjust (I was almost despairing) but I'm finally beginning to see light at the end of the tunnel.|`|zeTGmB3faa	It sounds like it is time to take the older cat to the vet for a check up. If she started acting up before the kitten arrived, she may have something wrong or an infection that is causing this behavior. When a cats behavior changes for no reason, illness is usually the cause. <br>  Introducing the cats will not be a picnic. An especially young small kitten won't have many defenses so this can be risky. If the kitten is of adult cat size, she at least will have a chance to hold her ground. If the fighting goes no further than hissing, a few growls and a swat once in a while, there is really no problem other than  no real friendship will develop, just a tolerance of the younger cat. As cranky as she is, I do think that she has a medical problem. Best wishes.
9d8438febeda9f081685c3c773c13d90aa	What Rachael said...Acetaminophen (tylenol) can be lethal...It works on a dogs liver the same way that radiator fluid does...Think of it as a "pack man" effect...The medicine keeps eating up liver cells and doesn't stop..<br>  If you're sure, absolutely 100% certain that they only had a "lick", then stop worrying and just keep a really close eye...It would take two Acetaminophen tablets to kill a 30 pound dog...A lick of nyquil is probably 1/4 a tablet...<br>  Things to look out for...In about 2-3 days would be lethargy to start with..If any of the dogs act "flu-ish" in a few days (you won't notice anything for at least a couple days if they're really healthy), Then get dogger to the vet immediately...<br>  If it hasn't been too long since this has happened...You may want to be a mean mommy and get doggers to throw up...Do you have any epicac ? If you don't you need to get some...No pet owner or parent should be without a bottle of epicac...Hopefully one never has to use it but it's like having a fire extinguisher..It'll go bad and you'll have to replace it from time to time but it's worth it, just in case...<br>  Anyways..No epicac ? Pour some peroxide down their throats..Then quickly close the mouth tight and blow a puff of air into the nose...This will make them swallow...And hopefully the peroxide will make them throw up...<br>  This is just a precaution, but like I said, if you're sure it was just a lick...Don't worry so much..<br>  And get some epicac !|`|28834ea3162329035a24ce080e7020edaa	If they only got a little taste, it might be nothing BUT I would call poison control just in case, they usually have a seperate hotline number for animals.|`|8FdOfT11aa	Nyquil has acetaminophen in it, which can be toxic to dogs.  If it doesn't seem like they had a lot of Nyquil they'll probably be fine.

tBUG9DEfaa	Put two sided tape on the banister.  The stickiness on the paws feeling really annoys the cat.  She'll stop climbing on it after she realizes it gives her an uncomfortable feeling.|`|FvAl3UgQaa	I really wouldn't recommend the spray bottle idea if the cat is already in a precarious position!!! Not sure what the answer is, but startling her just doesn't sound wise, in this particular situation. Maybe something like fly paper strips along the bannister to discourage her because it doesn't feel pleasant for her to walk on? It wouldn't need to be there permanently - just until she's out of the habit.<br>  <br>  Edit:<br>  <br>  Doh - Why didn't I think of double sided sticky tape? Bit less gross an idea than my fly paper one, LOL. It is the same principle though...|`|Uh6EV4wgaa	put foil along to edges|`|K1prVAsjaa	First off, grease it with something like vegetable oil. Then squirt her with a water bottle when she does something unwanted. Or, keep a tennis ball handy and wing it her way while saying NO loudly.<br>  <br>  ADDED: The two-sided tape is a good idea, and less messy than the oil. Anything unpleasant on the surface will do the trick. I firmly believe in the tennis ball therapy, though, used it on my cat and he doesn't scratch ANYTHING in my house (I also provided several scratching posts), or climb where he is not supposed to climb.|`|f57a735201cbe1357a7d68c97fe1003daa	I use a spray bottle and give my kitty a little squirt when she is doing something I want to train her not to do.

I thought for sure that was it, but she's a little crazy & she still gets up on the banister . I even have pics of her walking on it.  Please don't do the water spray.

After MANY repetitions, she finally got the idea that she was supposed to stop the ball with her paw on her own.  <br>  <br>  Then when she did that, I rewarded her with treats.  <br>  <br>  So it was cute to play ball with her and watch her stop the ball on her own.<br>  <br>  I hope you can play this game for your therapy.<br>  <br>  Good luck with the seniors!|`|hy9fz99Xaa	beautiful dog! As far as getting him certified, he has to have his CGC (Canine Good Citizen cerf.) which is not hard for a well socialized dog to obtain. Look up the requirements for that and make sure your dog is along those lines (or at least trainably close). This will ensure that your dog is definately the right temperment (most goldens are). <br>  <br>  Also, as far as taking him to work certified or not, make sure he is well groomed. My old golden used to shed like crazy especially in public, I had to get her furminated every few weeks.|`|AA11809403	since he is large, it would be good if her were fenced in the first time, since you are testing everything.<br>  <br>  <br>  if he knows how to play ROLL THE BALL  ( not just catch or chase) having a large ball, like for volleyball or soccer that the seniors could roll to him, that would be a good start.<br>  <br>  I know labs are total sweeties, but it is important he not jump on anyone.|`|fOLO4TNhaa	Hey poopy face!! :D<br>  <br>  Taz my Pom does therapy work with seniors as well. Well i do not know if this is going to work for you being that your dog is a large breed dog xD. I do not promote dressing up your dogs just cause its "cute". but i do think it is fine when its used as a cause. So anyway. When i first took Taz in, i had a bow on his head and a cute outfit on him. Very loose outfit he was very comfortable in it. All the oldies loved it! They each took turns letting him sleep in there laps. The clothes helped. Also doing tricks to get the oldies motivated is good also. They all where static when they saw Taz doing tricks they just loved it. I know Toby can do tricks so show them off! Also i don't think clothes will do on him but maybe a hat or glasses just to get them "awwing".<br>  <br>  Its really fun i do it 2 times a week now. I say go for it! Good luck!!<br>  <br>  PS. I am on Messenger!
wddqp34Aaa	Try crate training ( your husband)|`|mFLL37M5aa	I know you want to kill him...I would to LOL.  Try calming yourself and speaking rationally with your husband and let him know how you feel.  Also due to his recent retirement he might feel useless, they get that way to.  As a way of trying to reduce that feeling he needs to FEEL needed and loved and it looks as if he is going to the puppy for that and not you.  Good Luck.|`|28834ea3162329035a24ce080e7020edaa	I think if you can't talk to him, you should just let him train the puppy and if it turns out bad, its his fault. It probably isn't anything against you, its that hes retired and probably bored.|`|LGpv2grIaa	one of the guideline in training is consistency You should make sure everyone who's around your dog follows the same rules and uses the same cues.
dZxjXHA2aa	Yes, it is possible but just be prepared they require A LOT of work|`|vUoEgKxpaa	i cant even tell if this is a serious question.............|`|gzwdEZcMaa	if there is such thing as a domestic octopus i want one!!c  :)
9kTejB0uaa	Anything to do with eyes needs professional treatment.  See your vet if you are concerned.|`|ppKQEhEMaa	Has your dog been playing in long grass? It sounds like grass seeds to me..If anything is in your dogs eyes and not coming out, id seek treatment from a vet.|`|fbZjUTCRaa	try using a dropper full of water to flush the eye. if that doesnt get it out it is probably a floater. yes they are called that. it is a glob of the fluid around your eye. the dark is the shadow of it. generally they fade over time. just keep an eye on it, its not likely anything serious your dog may not even notice them. you can look it up on websites about human eyes. we get them too.
oMmBhWK4aa	Best to get your driftwood or bogwood from aquarium shops instead of picking from the wild, there's less risk of contamination. To play safe you still need to boil it for a while and then let the wood soak submerged for a few days to a week. Driftwood is believed to aid the digestion process for plecos and also help control their teeth, they actually will eat it by rasping off fragments. Some plecos will even die if deprived of wood. But you still need to supplement with algae wafers every few days, they don't exclusively eat wood. You can also try blanched veggies like cucumber & similar stuff.|`|hQQuqyYcaa	They can eat driftwood, yet it is best to provide them with algae tablets as well as zucchini slices on a clip.|`|aeonmRR2aa	I feed mine untreated pine 2x4's, which you can get at the local lumberyard...  hah!  just kidding.<br>  <br>  Actually, they eat algae.  But algae grows on rocks and driftwood better than on gravel.  So I suggest you go to a hardware store and buy a bag of 'smooth river rocks' or something like that, the size of your fist, and put them in your tank; eventually they will grow algae.  They must not be jagged!<br>  <br>  They also eat zucchini, lightly steamed spinach, sinking algae wafers, nori (from the Asian section of a grocery store), etc.|`|7708161c5408392d4a303b97b60f207faa	They are algae eaters, not wood! Just drop an algae wafer in there.. It will eat whatever food from other tankmates drop and clean the tank, algae wafers are a good supplement, mine like tubifex worms and shrimp pellets too. Who in the world told you they eat wood?? They just like a nice place to hide, they are mainly shy. Good Luck|`|zdclAyo5aa	plecos are quite easy to feed you can almost give them anything like cucumber, algae pellets ad some times they will eat flakes most of the time you dont need to feed them anything cuz of the algae on the glass in the tank.<br>  <br>  hope this info helped you<br>  <br>  edit: they really like cucumber and it saves your money aswell.|`|560ed01aaaf2cb92670d9a3758d8e6f8aa	algae wafers or aquatic plants, or dead fish. ive seen mine scavaging on a dead fish in my tank. They'll even eat leftover flake food laying at the bottom of the tank.
FvAl3UgQaa	Not a fish keeping expert (only have guppies!) but brackish water is the slightly salty water found in river estuaries...so in fish keeping terms, not a freshwater tank, but not saltwater either - somewhere in between.<br>  <br>  No idea what "As in s.g." means, sorry!<br>  <br>  ***************<br>  <br>  Edit - doh! Should have worked that out myself, thanks!<br>  <br>  To quote THE BRACKISH WATER AQUARIUM<br>  <br>  by Les Pearce: <br>  <br>  "What is brackish water?<br>  <br>  It is surprising how many people believe that the term brackish means dirty. If you look it up in the dictionary, you will find that in truth, it means ‘saltish’ or ‘rather salt’. This is a fair description of what we know as brackish although, if you want to be pedantic about it, even fresh water contains salts.<br>  <br>  We are mainly concerned with salts contained in sea water, primarily sodium chloride. As for the aquarium, we can take brackish water to mean that which is part way between fresh water and marine or sea water. To put a value on it, a specific gravity of around 1.005 is suitable with anything between 1.002 and 1.008 being quite acceptable."|`|h4wNRqf9aa	SG mean spcific gravity, a relative measure of salinity<br>  <br>  Typical sg for a brackish tank is somehwere between 1.005 and 1.015|`|aeonmRR2aa	sg: specific gravity, a measure of salinity by water density.<br>  <br>  "Brackish" has no specific specific gravity :)<br>  <br>  It means "Between freshwater and ocean water".  So, for example, a saltwater marsh is brackish and may have an sg of 1.005 or 1.012 or 1.003 or basically anything between 1 and seawater.
9kTejB0uaa	You can use pasta, but what was the vomit like?  Did he bring up food, or just bile?  I'd just give him the chicken personally and wait and see if it sticks!!   Then you can get out and pick up some rice later.  Otherwise, if he seems offcolour (diarrhoea?) I think I'd see your vet - mainly because he's young and the big risk is dehydration if he carries on upchucking etc.<br>  <br>  Edit - Sigh!  I wish people would read my posts before hitting the thumbs down - I said you CAN use pasta, not you SHOULD................ pasta is okay for dogs, in moderation!<br>  No offence intended - I was referring to the a.below! Bile probably indicates a slight upset tum. You might try giving him just a little natural yogurt which often helps sort out uncomplicated tummy upsets.  But again, advice here is only guess-work, so if you are worried, always seek veterinary help! Cheers.|`|vUiUoamVaa	why was he sick - what caused it?<br>  <br>  Yes, rice is bland enough not to cause digestive problems.|`|AA11457471	No pasta!<br>  <br>  Just give the chicken or 1/2 serving of his usual food soaked with water or broth if you have no rice.|`|NAGiNKFWaa	I would use the pasta, or maybe a scrambled egg or toast.

Bw18seFqaa	There is a process of gaining AKC recognition...  there first has to be a breed club established in the US for that breed.<br>  <br>  The breed club has to decide that they want to try for AKC recognition.<br>  <br>  They have to work on establishing bloodlines and record keeping in the US..  showing under the misc. class.. and gain interest in the breed.  AKC ussually accepts a few new breeds each year from the list of FSS breeds..  these are breeds that are working on gaining recognition.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.akc.org/breeds/fss_breeds.cfm" rel="nofollow">http://www.akc.org/breeds/fss_breeds.cfm</a><br>  <br>  The Bolognese is on this list..  they will eventually be an AKC breed.<br>  <br>  <br>  Actually, be glad a lot of people dont know they exists.  Popularity is never a good thing for a breed.  When a breed becomes popular.. all of the back yard breeders and puppy millers want to cash in on it.. they pump out unhealthy, poorly breed examples of the breed.   When its not so popular, you mostly only have responsible breeders who breed to continue healthy lines.|`|sUXyRlVjaa	<a href="http://www.akc.org/breeds/fss_breeds.cfm" rel="nofollow">http://www.akc.org/breeds/fss_breeds.cfm</a>  If you check this link you'll see that the Bolognese has taken the first step towards AKC recognition.

EWXzNyk8aa	I think it would be great for you to show him. I love showing. You really can't make a puppy the perfect show dog. It takes practice. Don't worry about putting on muscle, etc. until he is a little older. Just make sure he is at a healthy weight. I don't know much about APBT, but to me he is a beautiful dog. If you are thinking about breeding him, showing is a good way for you to find out if he is breeding quality. I would suggest taking a few conformation classes before you enter any shows. That way you can both get in sync with each other, he will know what you expect him to do, and it will just be good practice. Some dogs don't like to stand still for exam, so I would suggest practicing this too. Good luck!
rGVLrkEAaa	well it sounds like u really wanna do right by ur new friend which is great !!!<br>  <br>  all guinea pigs r very shy and timid - wen i first brought mine home he was the se but i started noticing how he was more brave after a week - after about a month i couldnt get him to stop squeeking. hes at the point now where hes used to me and knows when his food etc is coming so squeaks and wil stay in the same compartment with my hand in there. urs will soon settle down 2 but as they are naturally timid animals it takes them a while 2 settle in but perfectly natural.<br>  <br>  care books suggest that for the first week u let them hear ur voice only - then stroke and then holding them - they will learn to recognise ur voice and sent as there carer. so take it slowly and do it a step a week.<br>  <br>  to hold him u just need to slide ur hand under his tummy and lift him out and either onto ur knee or i sometimes rest mine in the crook of my arm with one hand over him for support. once u get tono th unque personality of ur piggy u wil soon trust him not to bite u as he need to lean to trust u not 2 hurt him.<br>  <br>  u can makethings ouf wood (natural and untreated) hay and grass balls etc - i always stuff the middle of an empty kitchen roll with gras and hay and let him gnaw it down to get to his treat - they are naturally inquisitive and love to play so hiding treats in the cage or cutting up carrots and wedging them in the higher bars of his cage so he has to work to get them<br>  <br>  good luck<br>  <br>  im sure ull do great|`|uvU5DnHcaa	Firstly don't be scared of him, you are his mum now and he needs your support. He needs to be held and felt safe. When you hold him place him in a snuggle bag as this will help both him and you bond closer together. When cleaning his cage do it when he is not in there as this is frightening for any animal to go through. ( the old shovel would scare me too if I saw it coming towards me ).<br>  If you just start off handling him for a couple of minutes a day. Then every time you handle him just do it for a bit longer, you both will become very good mates in time. Handling them every day is important from the day you get them and a routine time is also helpful. They soon learn when its time to come out and time they can rest and sleep.<br>  <br>  When it comes to picking guinea pigs up , always use two hands. One hand to scoop up under neath their belly and the other to place under their bottom and between their back legs for support at the same time. this way they can not jump out of your hands and they feel safe and supported.<br>  <br>  I place bricks and 5 inch poly pipe in for my to play in and on. Guinea pigs love to jump onto, over and into thinks. I also give them snuggle bags for somewhere for them to feel safe and warm to sleep.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://picasaweb.google.com.au/petlee7/20070827230907?feat=directlink" rel="nofollow">http://picasaweb.google.com.au/petlee7/2...</a>|`|6JNswOpbaa	the sudden movement is because he is scared ..... and if he is new, he is a little fright end of people around. Guinea pigs never bite unless they feel they are being harmed by others.. and they will squeak and make other noises for different reasons to pic up a gineau pig . i tend to carefully place my hand in the cage and let her smell it and she will get curious of this hand, and slowly graduly each day become calm and step on ur hand then you slowly lift and there you go this can take weeks. i gave our Guinea pig, a toilet role tube but she was to big (fat wise) and couldn't fit into the tube. So in the end i brought this football .. which opens for carrots and food to go in she would play with that for ages. lol<br>  <br>  Hopes i helped.|`|hmXWk90waa	Well, The sudden movement is him being scared. and the best thing to do is not be scared because he can sense it. Dont worry they dont bite unless you are really hurting them (rarley) and there bites dont hurt they are just a little nibble.Just pick him up, sit down with him,stroke him and talk to him. Gradually keep doing this and he will get very used to you! but if you leave him without touching you he will bite you and run away and be so scared you could never pick him up at all (my friends did this and the poor thing is petrified!)<br>  The way to hold him is very simple just pick him up with two hands under his belly not to tight and lay your hands under his belly and support his back legs. Then sit down with hims sit him on your lap and stroke him and give him a treat (mine like carrots (not lettuce it gives them dirrohea and can kill them!)I find that they like ice cream containers turned upside down with a square cut out of it for a cubby house. or you can make it out of a cardboard box.dont give them toilet rolls because they can get stuck in them.insted you could but pvc piping at least 4 inches wide. you can scrunch up a piece of newspaper and he will push it around with his nose like a ball. or he might like to hide under a peice of newspaper. Hope this Helps!! Please feel free to contact me for any other questions you have !|`|oE778xh7aa	well for 1# he's scared try coming up to him with a treat like a carrot or a banana, they do bite, not hard don't worry, and only because they think your food, they need to get used to your smell!<br>  <br>  for 2# their belly needs to be up against your chest, one hand on their rump and one on their backs!<br>  for 3# go to my website and go to the toy page!<br>  if you have more questions ask me at my guest book on my website!<br>  good luck!<br>  go piggies!<br>  my website!:<br>  www.guineas4ever12.webs.com!<br>  thx!!!!!!!!!!!|`|qFu4ugC7aa	he is probbalyy very stressed out because he's all alone, gone from the pretection of a family of 8. if you are willing to get another friend for him and he will relax a little. as to holding him if you are scared sit on the ground with a towel in your lap and wrap that around him. that will stop him from scratching you he will most likely not bite you.  a good insesentive for him to be comfortiable with you holding him is to have a carrot on stand by:)they love them to bits. don't give them any plastic toys but thet love to ware the teeth down on wood cause they are always growing (not treated wood) a pet shop shold sell all kinds of flavoured wood chews for rats and guineas.

Though they might be very energetic at first, they calm down and become very good pets.  This hamster is calm, easy to take care of and is very sweet and soft.  There are two kinds: a wild colored (darker), and a lighter colored hamster.  <br>  <br>  I had four of these hamsters and had a great time caring for them.<br>  <br>  There is one thing though that I want to point out.

I now have five hamsters, four Campells, and one Roborovski.<br>  <br>  Campbells are my personal favorite. They are averagely small. They grow up to about 7 to 10 cm, and are quite easy to tame. Also, if you were looking to breed two Campbells, there would be alot of colors you could end up with. They're really active, but don't bite much at all.<br>  <br>  Roborovskis are probably the cutest. They are recognized by their long whiskers and small bodies. I have one, his name is Sparky, and he really lives up to the name. They are extremely fast and although they are hilarious to watch, you can't actually hold them. They breed the fastest though, so if you were looking to breed and fast, they would be the way to go.<br>  <br>  Winter Whites are sort of similar to Campbells. They have similar personalities, but are rarer. In winter, their coat is supposed to turn lighter, but sometimes when kept in captivity, they stop to change color.<br>  <br>  Chinese hamsters are nearly Syrians, because they are the biggest of all hamsters. The males have the largest testes and they also have the longest tail, and long bodies. Most people think they look more like rats, and they're pretty rare and not easy to find in common pet shops.They don't like to live together, so if you want to buy more than two, you need two cages.<br>  <br>  It depends what you're looking for, e-mail me if you need any more advice or help!|`|6JNswOpbaa	i would say russian i have had 3 in the past and they are great i was before thinking of chinese hamsters but they are quick runners hard to catch i heard .. so i had russian they are simple kind and can live in groups or on their own and best of all they are CUTE.<br>  <br>  hope i helped. x|`|rNJVcq4Daa	Robrovski hamsters are small and fast but fun to watch.

1Qh9i9cWaa	Here is how I cycle a tank...<br>  <br>  Basically its much more better to cycle the tank without fish because the fish there would definitely die sooner or later and won't live long enough...<br>  <br>  But if you don't care of the fish its much more faster to have it while cycling...<br>  <br>  The fastest way to cycle a fish tank is to add living bacteria to the tank. Any gravel or fiter media from a mature tank will have this bacteria. The more you get the better, and if you get enough the cycle will be instant! Add this bacteria at the same time as adding fish and make sure it stays wet till you use it. The more fish you want to add at once, the more established media you will need. Even if you do a fishless cycle, this method will speed it up a ton.<br>  <br>  Aside from that, bacteria will grow quickest for you if you keep the tank warm (low 80's) and make sure there is lots of water and surface movement.<br>  <br>  For cycling with fish, start off with just a few fish to play it safe. Figure on about 2 small fish (an inch or less) for every 10 gallons of water to start the cycle and keep them safe. Then don't add any fish for a month and feed lightly the whole time. Then start adding your new fish a couple at a time, allowing a week between additions for bacteria to catch up. It's safest to test for Ammonia and Nitrites before you make new additions, just to make sure. Cycling with fish gets a bad rap online lately, but most people still do it this way in real life and by taking it slowly it's easy to do it without harming the fish.<br>  <br>  If you cycle with food it will work, though you can expect high nitrates, phosphates, and cloudiness and will need to clean things up before adding fish. Better then food for a fishless cycle is bottled ammonia (the type without soap or perfume in it) because it's cleaner - you still want to do a nice big water change before adding fish though to clear up the excess nitrates.<br>  <br>  Don't ask the pet store for advise - it's a good way to get bad information. Especially in the big chain stores. Do your own research and you'll go in knowing much more than they do.|`|WsMMHEjDaa	To get a cycle started in your new tank, add some gravel from your old tank into the new tank or add some of the filter material from the filter you are using to the filter on the new tank. Also you could add some of the water where the fish is now to your new set set up. This will get the cycle started by adding the "good bacteria" to the new tank. Then add the single fish to help speed things along|`|FRNDkLNqaa	A new teacher was trying to make use of the psychology courses she’d taken in college.

You should only put in a very strong fish for the first couple months and then add the other fish.|`|AA12347845	Considering the size of the tank, I feel that it's fine to put in your 1 fish immediarely.<br>  <br>  Also, the cycle wont start unless the fish is introduced, so the sooner the better. <br>  <br>  Change around 20% water weekly and everything shoild be OK.<br>  <br>  All the best !
MzHwklzKaa	Very normal.<br>  <br>  NO VET NEEDED!!!<br>  Unless you see a rash or bald spots, don't bother the nice Veterinarian.  LOL!<br>  <br>  Huskies "blow their coats" twice a year.  They shed their heavy, thick undercoats.  It's like cotton, right?  That's what keeps the doggies so warm in the winter.<br>  <br>  No worries!<br>  Do keep up with the brushing.  It will cut down on the mess in the house and yard, and will make the dog more comfortable.|`|LxBwmRTlaa	No that is not normal. He might have fleas and is causing his skin to have an allergic reaction therefore there is hair loss. You can read about it on this website.|`|CaQTKNKyaa	OH yes it is very very normal for a husky to  lose fur. But just to be sure take it to a vet.|`|taLD45Sqaa	My huskies started blowing their coats about a week and a half ago, it's near spring time and the extra fur is no longer needed. Unless the guard hairs (the first layer) starts falling out you don't have anything to worry about. The undercoat will come out twice a year, this time of year and usually fall/the end of summer. Get a brush (the furminator is awesome for Huskies) and start brushing!!|`|dl1OOOT8aa	Yes, it's very normal. Most sibe owners call it blowing, because they are literally blowing off their winter undercoat. Here's a good video to show of this phenomena:<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bH_xSBC5mPE" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bH_xSBC5m...</a><br>  <br>  I recommend getting a furminator to keep the fur at bay.|`|BpKECFBSaa	Huskies lose hair on their legs and areas due to stress... but I doubt youre dog is stressed, because its usually shelter dogs who are. Its probably more than shedding if your concernd enough to ask this question. Call the vet if you really do think its something bad. It could be shedding though. Hope this helped! Good Luck!|`|muYwCUwEaa	you might want to get it tested for mange at the vets clinic, just in case.

It would seem a little awkward don't you think? <br>  <br>  It's great to see you defining your list down and squeezing out as much detail as you can but have you owned a dog before? Once again, I come back to the fact of protection dogs. Certainly not for your average beginner or even intermediate owner.<br>  <br>  I would be looking into a Great Dane. They have short fur coats, are quite large, intimidating looks and are the biggest sooks when it comes to cats. Gentle Giants..<br>  <br>  I would never suggest out a Dobermann, Rottweiler American Pit Bull or even Siberian Husky unless I knew you and your complete conditions. They are beautiful breeds but restricted to those of advanced levels in ownership.|`|28834ea3162329035a24ce080e7020edaa	Rottweiler, Doberman, German Shepherd, Labrador Ret.

MzHwklzKaa	1)  Now is the perfect age.  They're good to go by 4 weeks, but they're better off for staying with mama for 5 weeks. <br>  <br>  2) The dad won't harm his kid.  BUT he will eventually try to mate with a female, or fight with a male.   Babies are fully mature by 4 months.  You need to re-home or neuter the baby by then.  For best results, dad needs to be neutered too.<br>  <br>  3) Lots of gentle handling, and food bribes will tame the baby right down.  Actually, the earlier you can teach a baby that humans are great, the better pets they make.<br>  <br>  Males need to be neutered.

lhQGN8Ucaa	Oh geez! Everyone on yahoo has a perfectly trained dog! Funny I never seem to run into these dogs! I have 5 dogs and they are all trained well, but they all have there moments. Yes my Clyde beagle mix is overly friendly and after 4 times of telling him to sit, i end up apologizing! Truthfully if you have a dog that never shows emotions you have a unhappy dog! Though  if your taking her to training have patience, she will get better. It just takes time with some and even the best trained dogs can still do things that make ya go grrrrr!|`|dl1OOOT8aa	Yes! I had a cocker spaniel and he used to "mark" a lot and let's see here he's "marked": cars, other dogs, tables, people's bags(who left them on the ground), and ahh my favorite, someone's leg. <br>  <br>  Most people would be scared if they were being approached by a large black dog. For your dog's safety, keep him on a leash until he's finished with his training and fully obedient.|`|U8QDUtw8aa	I have three dog's now, I recently adopted another pound dog.<br>  <br>  My two black labs are usually incredibly well behaved so they get let off the leash at the beach and park. They will leave people and animals alone and come back when they are called...until they see rabbits. Rabbits are the only things that will stop my dogs from listening to me and i don't know why but i always have to apologies when they suddenly sprint off and scare people on the way.<br>  <br>  I am always apologizing to the new one, Morgan. he will jump out at anything, and like yours, people have told me that he looks like Marmaduke, I don't see that as a negative though!<br>  <br>  All the dogs go to training, but i guess some habits die hard.|`|AA11457471	Nope, I don't put up with that stuff. I insist mine are well behaved. They're well loved but they know their place in the pecking order.<br>  <br>  I seldom had to apologize for my daughter's behavior, either ; )|`|280d96ad7b5e9ffad03a34a66cac5db0aa	Having her off leash like that is begging for an accident. It's great that you're training her, but it's very important that you prevent any bad situations until she behaves herself more appropriately. You say she'd never hurt anyone on purpose, but considering her obvious interest in cats, be very careful. She can easily maim a cat without even intending to. Someone I know from a mastiff community has described to me how she has seen a mastiff literally pick up a small dog, shake it once, and it was dead. Large dogs can have incredible jaws, and they're often less than aware of their size. Plus, what if she sees someone across the street, runs out, and gets hit by a car? What if she goes after a human or other dog who isn't as friendly as she is?<br>  <br>  No, I don't find myself constantly apologizing. I keep my dog leashed, so it isn't possible for him to make a run for someone. (But if he were ever to rush up to someone, it would be to say hi. He loves people a little too much.) And he has very low prey drive, so I don't have to worry about him lunging after any small animals. (Plus, there are surprisingly few stray kitties in my neighborhood.) And he barks strictly to warn us of a stranger around or an odd noise. (..He hears a lot of odd noises. Oy.)<br>  <br>  I do find myself occasionally apologizing for him slobbering over someone, though. And I should apologize when he pulls to see someone, but I'm a little preoccupied with keeping my footing and refusing to go forward until he stops pulling.<br>  <br>  You are responsible for the fact that she is running around off her leash, so you do need to apologize when she approaches someone or, God forbid, goes after a cat. You can easily prevent such incidents by simply leashing her. Don't feel too bad about her barking at someone, though. I mean, dogs bark, so that isn't so much a question of training.<br>  <br>  I think it would benefit you to teach her "loose leash walking." This means that when you go for a walk, she is trained to voluntarily walk right beside you, so there's no pressure on the leash. A very well-trained dog won't even need a leash because they are trained to stay right by your side. (Of course, it's vital that you leash that dog anyway for safety's sake.)|`|yUkFvtudaa	No.  I don't put mine in these situations or other people.  I taught them to have manners.  If you don't want to apologize then don't get into the situations like having your dog off leash.<br>  <br>  My dogs are far from "perfect".  I just know if they are having one of those days, I don't let them jump all over people or let them run around unleashed to get into trouble.  Actually I never let them outside unleashed unless in fenced in backyard.  Even though they wouldn't hurt anyone, they could get hurt (cars, other dogs).|`|X4NIyjUkaa	well ya but mine is gasp april,that's my dog name,that's all i say but i do so april your a bad dog and then praise her for acting sad.|`|Rr2D2POcaa	Not really, my dogs are used to cats and never chase them. But my Pitbull mix does get too excited and tries to jump on people at times, and my Cocker will try to chase birds. lol.|`|TkbaEic0aa	i'm not a dog person, i love cats and i'm owned by two himalayan cats.. but i had my sister's god doberman when she went for a holiday.. and she's so spoiled.. she only listens to my sista.. so it was really diffident to control her when i take her for a walk.. she will jump on people, pet and cars.. and again i'm there to say sorry.. and ppl seem not to like doberman dogs, or feel afraid.. so i have to get that b*tchy look from stranga.. till i decided to take her for a walk when no one is around.. imagine me walking a dober in the mid of the night.. loool or early morning when ppl still sleeping :p
9kceDOTraa	Got to nix the Dubosi because this is a Tangyangikan and they do not mix in the same way Mbuna do, as well as the typical waters in Tangyangika is significantly different then that of both Malawi and Victoria.  Tang's are much more susceptible to bloat then even Malawi's as well, and thus you really want to keep Tangs in their own tank until you get more experienced.<br>  <br>  I did mention before about the Demasoni and Jewel being in this group and mentioned why you don't want to mix these in such a small footprint.  If you insist on keeping the Demasoni, then don't mix them with yellow labs.  Yellow labs are just to omild to mix in with Demasoni.  Jewels as well are riverine types and actually do better in waters that are closer to South American, but you may be able to adapt them.<br>  <br>  Do not put a Dubosi in this mix.  They are in the same aggression levels as Demasoni, but have different needs.  I have a Dubosi myself, but I didn't even think of adding this guy until I'd studied my Mbuna for over a year first.  It's not something advisable to do in the beginning.  If you insist on forcing this as well, I HIGHLY suggest, you do not even try to feed any live foods, such as bloodworms or brine shrimp in the diet.  Better stick with pellets and flakes only or you're going to give that Dubosi a bad case of bloat.|`|AA12347845	I have been keeping African cichlids for some time. I feel that you should keep only Peacocks and Electric Yellows together.<br>  <br>  - the Demasonis, Duboisi and Jewels are too aggressive for the aforementioned 2 varieties. <br>  <br>   To add color you can keep both Yellow and Blue labs and there are so many varieties of Peacocks to choose from.<br>  <br>  Putting all (your list) in one medium sizes tank is certain to create mayhem.<br>  <br>  Also, keep in mind that you'll be needing a bigger tank in the near future.<br>  <br>  All the best !
YnCUyvK7aa	No, because the silver tipped sharks are a brackish fish, even though they tolerate freshwater as juveniles.  Adults can live in saltwater tanks.  Silver tip sharks is the new name that Columbian sharks are being sold as.  If people knew what they were or did some research on them before they bought them, not as many people would buy them.  They also have venomous spines in their fins, so YOU need to be careful when cleaning their tank.  They will also grow to 14 inches [each], so I hope you have a large tank.<br>  <br>  The angels and albino shark [albino rainbow shark?] wouldn't be very tolerant of much salt in their water.  But the angels, barbs, and albino shark would be okay together as long as you have a large enough tank for all of them, probably at least a 55 by the time they're fully grown.  I'd also suggest adding 2 more barbs, as these are schooling fish and will have the tendency to nip the fins of their tankmates if they aren't in a large enough school.  They might nip at your angels long fins anyway, so I'd keep a close eye out for ripped fins.|`|oMmBhWK4aa	Sharks generally don't tolerate similar species or even similar looking fish in the same tank, many don't even like another of the same species together. Unless you have a really big tank with adequate hiding places, it's not advisable if you want to keep the peace.|`|zdclAyo5aa	well first your needs tank is a good size because angel fish and silver sharks get really big but a albino shark will be fine its sounds like a good community tank you have there.<br>  <br>  hope this info helps.|`|5ZudD3n6aa	yes a albino should be fine in your tank.. most sharks grow big. tetra's and barbs generally stay small. Your Angel fish will grow big as well.|`|hQQuqyYcaa	Sounds like a good mix.|`|h4wNRqf9aa	Silver tip sharks aka columbian sharks are high end brackish fish<br>  I'd suggest moving them before it's too late<br>  <br>  <br>  For four angels, four tiger barbs (of which you should get more) and an albino shark i'd be looking at no less than a 55 gallon with a 75 or 90 being much better
f57a735201cbe1357a7d68c97fe1003daa	It is a comforting, happy feeling for them.  When they are babies and nursing, they make the same movements. I think if they do it on you, it is showing you their love for you.  We call it "Making Muffins"!|`|ISD5c0CMaa	Cats do this A LOT.  It's comforting, in some ways its kinda like cleaning itself or something, its hygiene thing.<br>  Also sometimes a cat might feel very itchy, cause they go around everywhere and unlike us they don't take showers.<br>  <br>  They love it when you scratch near the ears or under the chin, trust me. But you gotta do it properly.|`|nIcPHrXUaa	Hi Kim, just for reinforcement-the other answers were right-my kitty does that all the time, mainly when she is ready to make her bed and nap.

When they knead their paws on you or a blanket or whatever, they are marking it as their territory, in a nice friendly way that calms and reassures them.|`|TORBP6QIaa	Cats do the "kneading" as its comforting for them...like the answer above says...it takes them back to kittenhood when they did this to mum to nurse.  I think its so cute to watch.|`|9dd1996d5fe2889ddece4c461db89465aa	My cat does the same thing so he pretty much has his own blanket, a soft throw that he likes.  We call it "making bread" or "making cat patties".  It's a happy comforting thing that most cats do and what they do when they are kittens when they nurse.
K1prVAsjaa	I am glad your pup will pull through. You must have caught it early enough, and gotten it to a good vet, and are taking good care of it. All of which is very important.<br>  <br>  My first pup had Parvo at the same age. This was in the early 1980's and Parvo had an extremely high mortality rate (maybe 90%?), but with my vet's help I pulled her through it. I had that dog for 15 years, and she was the most wonderful dog I've ever known. I hope yours turns out as well.|`|o97yfEKOaa	i have a 1 year old  APBT<br>  he got parvo around 3 months he wouldnt stand up for a weeks, he have him antibiotics and baby pedyalite . <br>  i thinkt it affected his back leg  muscles becouse he walks weird, but i love my dogs hi thinks his a puppy still.|`|t8GjNSgDaa	Parvo is a nasty illness. I saw it in my own dog a few years ago. I was lucky enough though to see him survive it. One thing that we did was keep him away from the other pups we had at the time and away from our other dogs as well. We also bleached our shoes and anything else that came in contact with him during his illness. One thing we did was to give him his antibiotics twice daily and tell him at night that we loved him and that we would see him in the morning and to just keep fighting that he would be ok. a week later he ate his first bites of food and started waging his tail and wanting to play a little. one thing we did was alot of praying for him. Good Luck

It's just something he claimed that brings him comfort more than likely.  Does he have any small cuddly toys?<br>  <br>  One of my cats, likes very small stuffed animals.  She had a small mouse and a squirrel that were only about 2-3 inches long.  She would roll on them and sit on them like she was hatching them or something.  I don't know if your cat would take to a stuffed animal but it might be worth a try, if you don't want him to take your clothes.  It might help while you are home watching TV or something to hold it and sleep with the toy in your bed to get your smell on it, too.  Or you might try a soft rag instead of a stuffed animal.
FvAl3UgQaa	I think a friend or relative has been "having a laugh" at you expense - PMSL!!!<br>  <br>  In answer to your question, all you can do is never repeat it to him (as if you would!), never react to him saying it (as they're just like kids and any attention - even negative - can be affirming) and then try and teach him a new favourite phrase...and in the meantime, don't invite any clergy in for tea, LOL!|`|2Ku4DuvCaa	You can't. What you can do, however, is encourage him not to say it. When he says it, look at him sternly and say "No." And then stop giving him any attention for it.<br>  <br>  Praise him when he says good words. Smile and call him a good boy, and even offer him treats. If he learns that he cannot get any attention from you by using that word, then he will likely stop using it. It's important not to react to that word any more than just to tell him no. And don't come running every time he says it. He needs to know that he cannot get good attention from you when he says it.<br>  <br>  I've also had success with teaching a parrot not to say those words by teaching them words that rhyme, or by putting their attention into another word. <br>  <br>  You must be persistent about it, and it won't happen right away. However, if you stick to your guns and keep with the advice I gave you, you can train him not to say that word. I've done it a few times- with effort it works.|`|dO0cb4yBaa	@AlexD's answer is right on. It's sometimes hard to ignore them when they say something like that but you have to. Any reaction positive or negative will reinforce it. This includes all your friends. If they laugh and giggle every time he says it then that is reinforcing him and encouraging him to repeat it. So just try to focus on positive reinforcement when he says good things and ignore him when he says bad things.<br>  <br>  @Snow's answer is very interesting. I've never heard of using that method. It goes against conventional training that says to ignore it. So technically you would be reinforcing him by saying another phrase "truck on" when he says the bad word. But I guess if it works then that's all that matters.|`|j4R5JLBAaa	You'll be surprised, but sometimes your office coworkers, kids around the house or anyone who can have an access to bird can purposely teach them these words cuz they think it's funny. Once i caught my roommate doing this to one of my birds he liked the most.|`|L0xlHKCeaa	Just make sure you do not say it at all.|`|QjrN8aM5aa	We had an outdoor aviary and the roofers taught our parrots a whole string of bad words.<br>  <br>  <br>  Find rhyming words to teach him.<br>  <br>  You might try Duck Dog or something.  <br>  You can also try changing the one word and adding another word with an emphasis on the new word.  <br>  Chuck it off.  <br>  Luck is on<br>  Truck on.<br>  <br>  It works but you have to repeat the new phrase immediately after he says the old one.<br>  <br>  Good luck...  one of my birds still says "Sunna b**ch"|`|KYjQM6iIaa	Maybe you should introduce a new word or a few more new words so then he might leave the other word.Or evreytime he says it take away his food for abit or say naughty or something lol!

1Qh9i9cWaa	They breed easily and very frequently - just like rabbits. Give them plenty of rocks and hiding spots. They will soon pick out a favorite place for the eggs. You'll have a full tank in no time.<br>  <br>  You can usually tell the difference between the male and female in the store. The male will be bigger and more colorful. I never really had a chance to figure out when the female was carrying eggs -- seems like always because they won't stop having babies.<br>  <br>  Just be sure you know what you're getting into here. The fry are fun at first but after you've had to find homes for about 50 of them it gets pretty old.<br>  <br>  EDIT - You can keep the fry in the same tank as the adults. You can move them once they get a little bigger and the parents stop caring for them - but it's not necessary. Feed them crushed up cichlid pellets and small live/frozen food.<br>  <br>  EDIT: As for the items just a tank, flowerpot , and fry food ( in case you are successful...<br>  <br>  Good Luck!
kvBdTLOMaa	i had gold fish do the floating thing. :( sorry but they are dieing. try to put them in a calm water bowl and put in all the amonia solutions and ur pebbles at the bottom. the calm water will help because they wont be so disoriented. thats the best advice i can give u. if they live by tomorrow clean the bowl and repeat try to keep as clean as possible for a week if they survive. good luck.
HIav9sVuaa	he likes it ive noticed that my cat has started eating stuff that ive left on the side like cake and chips and stuff they just like the food lol|`|NGmRMqe6aa	My Nigel is half siamese and he eats everything. I think even though they can't taste sweet they smell something we don't. I wonder if the fact they are such a old breed that they have learned to eat just about everything in order to stay alive. I'm not saying you starve him. I saying as a breed they may have evolved different eating habits to survive. It is just a theory I don't know if its a fact but it would explain why Nigel eats anything I eat right down to drinking my koolaid.|`|yRzEkPnpaa	Really? because my cat love to eat everything I ate like pizzas,cakes,ice cream and much more.|`|48846255239e6cfd4e8b805cbae9c844aa	what makes you think cats cant taste sweet things?

They can tell you what it is and whether or not to worry about it.  <br>  <br>  And please get your dog fixed, the shelters are over populated and thousands (probably more like millions) of healthy, adoptable pets are put to sleep every year because no one adopts them within X amount of time.|`|70878cc978ee2e4a79b3b53284340f9caa	It is probably a tumor,but the dog is awfully young to have one.You need to get her to a vet and see what it is.The dog should be spayed asap if she is already having problems at such a young age.

TkbaEic0aa	i feel you.. you're absolutely rite.. but you're talking about cats you had or you know.. but for me i feel sad for any animal in pain even if i saw it on tv or online?? and i neva seem to let go!! it will stuck on my head for days if it's not months..jus like the cat abuser in youtube.. i didn't see it any more but jus talking about it makes cry.. and when i watched how they skinned animals alive for their fur, i was sick for 2 months..<br>  and when i saw on youtube how china treats animal i was terrified and i stop going to eat in any chinese restaurant.. and i dun talk to any chinese.. i even stopped eating sushi (which is my favorite) becuz of japan's killing the dolphins ??<br>  so don't feel alone.. only prayers can help us and the animals|`|4aAhEK9daa	"the hardest part is if the cat ran away and die"  Well how often is this happening - and why?  Are you taking care of stray cats but letting them run loose outside?  Well then they're probably not running away - they're getting hit by a cars, eaten by wild animals, poisoned, etc, etc.  Keep them INDOORS where they belong.  And if you can't do that then bring them to a local no-kill shelter.<br>  <br>  Perhaps instead of having cats in your home you should instead volunteer at a shelter. Help out with adoptions, help raise funds, socialize the animals, clean cages - whatever.  Helping animals can be a lot of fun and very rewarding but expecting stray animals not to end up dying when you leave them outdoors isn't helping them at all.|`|ALDeXn6Uaa	normally it ends up making sense.|`|JhvW9jFRaa	Just keep doing what you love..<br>  The cats will be grateful and without people like you they would suffer too much..<br>  <br>  Just keep in mind that not all will survive so i say try to keep focused on the ones that do survive and help find them a good home.|`|iphheJkoaa	Well those are your emosions.  Someone elses might be way different.|`|NGmRMqe6aa	When one of my rescues die it hurts. But they would have died any way out in the cold. When they are with me they are held comforted and gently eased along the way. I take comfort in knowing that in their last moments  they were being loved. The ones I do save and adopt out are just like my kids that grow up and have a life of their own. When they have a new family that is one more cat I have saved we both win.You have a gentle heart and that is a good thing. It is okay to grieve and I too bury them under my flowers. I know they are dead but it just helps to know where they are. Remember they will all die if you give up trying at least with you they have a chance.|`|9dd1996d5fe2889ddece4c461db89465aa	I would have problems with rescuing the cats also.  Perhaps you could volunteer at a kennel or something like that.  You would be there to help and enjoy cats and you would be helping also.  Yes, once in a while you might encounter a situation that would make you feel sad but it probably be very often like it is with the rescues.|`|8vbPlgqnaa	I understand your feeling. You are a very sentimental person but neither do I know how to help you to deal with your emotions. You are a great cats-lover and have done your very best to help the poor cats. Think of them that they have gone to the rainbow bridge with your love always with them. They would have no regrets as they had been loved.|`|wddqp34Aaa	I believe you care for animals you rescue and it is hard to lose a pet that you tried to save . You sound so young and it breaks my heart that you are so sad but you are doing the right thing by trying to save  the cats .Even if they pass ,you made their last days better by taking care of them ,giving love ,food ,warm dry place to sleep .Without you they would died out in the cold ,hungry and alone.It's ok to be sad but you should be proud that you care enough to help even when you know you may get hurt ! VERY GOOD KARMA
YnCUyvK7aa	Corals can kill fish if they're 1 of the kinds that sting their prey to feed.  In that, they're like anemones.  They sting the fish first to paralyze it, the move it to their mouth to eat.  Yours was lucky to get away if that's what happened.  You might see dark spots show up on the body of the fish where it was stung.<br>  <br>  There are more than just a few corals that will do this, so it might help to identify yours if you could post a picture of it.|`|h4wNRqf9aa	I'm betting he died and was blown towards the coral<br>  <br>  No cnidarians known as 'corals' are powerfull enough to kill a firefish, nor any that would try to eat one<br>  Anemones and such are a possibility, but you would have referred to it as a anemone not a coral<br>  <br>  <br>  Check your water parameters before blaming passive feeders|`|eJ97Qdooaa	Most likely the fish was weak and did and it just happened to float over to the coral.

8ebb09b16f5ff1a5448d5eab3b4b1fa4aa	I'm sorry, but I ascribe to the Victoria Stillwell school of training dogs. Completely cruelty free.

Yes, they look like torture devices. But I've tried both of them, and the prong causes an uncomfortable pinching sensation.. which is much better than the intense stinging from the choke chain, which had us dancing around the room in pain. The prong collar simply tightens a small amount. The choke chain snaps and tightens to no limit.<br>  <br>  A quote about a study done in Germany on prong vs. choke collars:<br>      *  100 dogs were in the study. 50 used choke and 50 used prong.<br>      * The dogs were studied for their entire lives. As dogs died, autopsies were performed.<br>      * Of the 50 which had chokes, 48 had injuries to the neck, trachea, or back. 2 of those were determined to be genetic. The other 46 were caused by trauma.<br>      * Of the 50 which had prongs, 2 had injuries in the neck area, 1 was determined to be genetic. 1 was caused by trauma.<br>  <a href="http://cobankopegi.com/prong.html" rel="nofollow">http://cobankopegi.com/prong.html</a><br>  <br>  We did use a prong collar for the first year of my dog's life, and my dad still uses it. He insisted on using either a prong collar or a choke chain, so I settled for the prong if I had to choose. And yes, he walks wonderfully with it, but I've pretty much always used an Easy Walk Harness with similar results. (My dad exclusively uses the prong nowadays. I think I used it about seven times in the beginning for walks before I realized that it was pointless when I could achieve the same results with genuine training.)|`|taLD45Sqaa	Well it depends on what you are trying to accomplish. I wanted to train my Huskies not too pull on walks so we used the pinch collars for correction. You just give a tug to let the dog know he/she is pulling and I accompany this with the verbal command "don't pull." Now I simply say the command and they stop pulling. ( They are being trained for pulled a sled so they have their pulling times but only when wearing harnesses.) Also, we used it for correction while going though dog school and have now graduated onto the shock collar for distance training. For all the people who think this is 'cruel' it's only cruel if you yank hard on the leash or shock your dog on high power, it is more cruel to have your dog not obey you and get hit by a car.....<br>  If a chock chain is all you need for your dog, then by all means don't use more than what is necessary! It all depends on the level of training you are trying to achieve.<br>  And my dogs do love me, not fear me, I am simply their pack leader :)|`|tatbIu54aa	NO!!!<br>  I WOULD NEVER USE A CHECK CHAIN FOR MY DOG LET ALON A  SPIKED COLLAR!!!!!!!!!<br>  Leslie Fisher says it Stated quite simply, prong collars are an aversive device that cause pain to your dog.  Sure, they can be a quick fix, but a) your dog is only walking nicely to avoid punishment b) your dog is not being taught WHAT to do, in that the old behavior will return when the prong collar is removed and c) anything present in the environment when your dog experiences pain can take on a negative association, including other dogs, children and strangers.  Finally, d) in NO WAY, <br>  does a prong collar emulate the correction of a mothers teeth to a puppy.  This is a MYTH plain and simple, and is unproven in any scientific study.  <br>  <br>  When your dog feels pain and sees children, other dogs, and strangers on a consistent basis, he could  make a connection that children, other dogs, and strangers might not be so great, because he feels pain when he sees them.  The same thing is true of electric fences: when a dog repeatedly runs at the fence and gets too close to passersbys at the boundary, he gets shocked and makes that negative association.  Pat Miller writes of this in a Whole  Dog Journal article. <br>  HERE IS A GOOD LINK.<br>  <a href="http://www.merchantcircle.com/blogs/Look.What.I.Can.Do.Dog.Training.443-350-6820/2008/5/Reasons-NOT-to-Use-A-Prong-Pinch-Collar/80448" rel="nofollow">http://www.merchantcircle.com/blogs/Look...</a><br>  HOPE THIS HELPS:)|`|Y2LJrn7maa	If you mean a pinch collar. <br>  <br>  Yes I do, all my dogs.

Whether they use their bark is another feature. Many small breeds are full of hyper amounts of energy and when a dog is hyper, it's natural for them to bark.

They are quite lazy but at least you won't be deaf at the end of the day.

AA11457471	I had a dog that got very worked up about any physical contact she thought was aggressive. She used to actually scare people even though she'd never have really hurt anyone. <br>  The joke was that she insisted on non violence by acting like she'd get violent.<br>  <br>  Dogs instinctively know what aggressive behavior is whether they've been hit or not.<br>  Yes, I think you're probably over reacting but if you would be more comfortable, try another groomer.<br>  Most groomers prefer the owners not stay because the dogs almost always do better without them there.<br>  These folks definitely aren't getting rich doing what they do- they chose their profession because they adore dogs.<br>  <br>  Check into some of the natural anti anxiety products & see if it helps at least a little for groomers appointments. onlynaturalpets.com & entirelypets.com are good sites for that kind of thing.<br>  <br>  Best wishes.|`|AA11540024	you mentioned at the beginning that your dog starts shaking when you take him to the groomer.

It may be instinct, or someone did do something to him either before you got him or at groomers.|`|bsfl462naa	My honest answer is to trust your dog.  My bet is that indeed the groomer did get rough with your dog (unfortunately).  Furthermore, your dog has been lucky enough (as all dogs should be) to have not ever had a human hand bring anything but pleasure; so the experience must have been ten times more frightening.  Fortunately most dogs, as long as they are not continually abused for long periods of time, are able to move on if their environment slowly proves to them that there is no reason to be fearful.  <br>  <br>  Bottomline: find a new groomer and remember to always listen to your dog - they don't lie.|`|mFLL37M5aa	Personally I would march my little butt down there and confront the groomer and ask then out right, sure it's a little straight forward but this is your baby were talking about here.

Maybe he is being slapped or remembers being nicked in the past.

He has no way of knowing that you are kidding.

I'm going to try some of the other area dog parks because she very clearly wanted to play and the other 2 dogs that were there didn't want anything to do with her playtime.  <br>  <br>  Maybe try not to be so protective of him.  Dogs bark and hump and roll in the mud.  It's just what dogs do.  When you hear growls and see signs of aggression is when you should get protective.

FcR8G8hPaa	As I am often forced to say, your horse has a training problem not a bit problem (except insofar as this bit is far too strong and painful) nor is it a problem to be solved by increasing the fear your horse is experiencing around the treatment of his mouth by bit and reins.<br>  <br>  Step 1 is to retrain his stop response on the lead rope. He needs to walk with you at your pace and stop when you stop. If he fails to do this, you need to correct him immediately with a yank of the lead rope until he stops. Then walk forward and repeat. I strongly recommend you associate this stop and all the others with the verbal cue - "whoa", which you say first - then stop, then, if needed, correct. The horse needs to stop within one stride on "whoa" to be considered retrained. You have under a second to correct him or he won't know what the heck you are correcting.<br>  <br>  Step 2 is to retrain his stop on the lunge when lunged in the halter. This is not a time to allow the horse to bolt of and run or to "blow off steam" (there is no such concept for horses, by the way).  The horse needs to obey verbal commands to stop at all three gaits and needs to stop within a stride. Failing to obey requires you to immediately start  yanking on the lead rope and not stop until he drops gait and stops. If he's bad at this, then you need to start by rewarding the basic attempt (slowing and stopping) and gradually get more demanding that he stop within one stride.<br>  <br>  When this works, you are ready to retrain the stop under saddle. <br>  <br>  Get a new bit - a simple O-ring snaffle with a jointed bar is fine. The point is to convince the horse that stopping doesn't hurt.<br>  <br>  Walk the horse forward on a looser rein (but one where pulling your hand back less than a few inches makes contact), open your legs and say "whoa". If he fails to stop, do a fairly soft half halt with both reins, and if that doesn't work, replay the half halt at the same intensity, repeatedly, until he stops. Do not pull and hold, As soon as he stops, back him up two steps. Pause. Walk forward and repeat. When he responds reasonably correctly, reward him with a scratch just in front of his withers. The point here is to develop "self-carriage" in the stop. When you hang on his face, his instinctive reaction is to throw his head up. This technique doesn't allow the stop stimulus to last long enough for that response to be triggered, and the soft half halt with the more gentle bit starts to teach him that stopping doesn't hurt.<br>  <br>  Keep in mind that he has been trained by your current bit and your use of it to try to escape pain. He's going to keep flinching in expectation of pain for a while. What counts is that he stop and that you are not holding his mouth with a harsh bit. He'll get the idea fairly quickly and his head tossing will begin to reduce.<br>  <br>  You need to retrain yourself during this period as well. Stopping needs to come from the legs, not from dragging on the reins. Your goal is to have the horse stop when you say whoa. not because you are pulling on his face. This "self-carriage" will make the stop much more predictable and also lets the horse have comfort when stopping.<br>  <br>  As you work with your horse on these things, he will probably become calmer. You can make him even calmer and a better stopped by making sure that you are not holding on his face with the reins when riding, as well. Use the reins to turn (if he does not turn with legs) and use them to reinforce "whoa" with the half halt. Otherwise, stay out of his mouth. This is critical, because if you are holding pressure on his mouth while pushing forward you are de-training the value of the reins as a stop cue and will actually be training your horse to not stop  from the reins.<br>  <br>  Other activities to make your horse calmer, and thus a better stopper, include training him to stand still on lead line and under saddle and training him to lower his head on command. If you are interested in these, please post a separate question as these require some explanation.<br>  <br>  I hope this helps. Your horse will be happier, quieter and will be a better horse. Best wishes!|`|gJE0ujbzaa	Number one, the three ring gag is one of the worst bits ever made. They tend to pinch the corner of the horse's mouth, they flop around which annoys many sensitive horses, if they have a regular snaffle mouth it's common for where the bit breaks in the middle to point up and stab the horse in the roof of the mouth-I have never yet(and I've been training horses for 35 years) seen a horse that was comfortable in a three ring gag.<br>  <br>  Number two-standing martingales are not safe. I can give you a list of people I know who have been injured and killed(along with a list of horses) as a direct result of standing martingales.  Some horses will freak out, even after having been fine for ages wearing one, and will flip over backwards with little or no warning. Often it's when something has spooked them, they throw their head up, hit the martingale, and flip.  I've seen a few stumble, try to throw their head up to balance themselves, then go end over end. I saw another one drown when the rider tried to cross a river, the horse fell into a deep spot they didn't know was there, panicked when he couldn't get his nose about the water, and he tipped upside down and drowned-and nearly drowned the rider and someone else who went out to try and save them.<br>  <br>  Start borrowing bits to try.  The Myler comfort snaffle, the one with the barrel in the middle and the slots on the sides for the reins and cheekpieces give quite a bit of control, and most horses are pretty comfortable in them.  If you need a bit more control than that, they have a little hole for a link so you can add a chin strap(I've never had to use it, not even hunting when the horses can get really strong-but it's there if you want it).  You can try a plain gag bit, preferably with a french link in the middle. Very strong, but usually more comfortable than the three ring.  Some horses are comfortable in a snaffle with a thick twist, but respond to it better than a plain snaffle.<br>  <br>  Before you go trying bits though, have a certified horse dentist(NOT a vet, unless your vet is also a certified dentist-very few are) take a look at the teeth. Wolf teeth, hooks in front, and molars that don't match in the back(you can't see them unless you put a speculum in the horse's mouth and get in their with a light), as well as sharp edges, can cause a horse to be uncomfortable in any bit, causing them to lean, throw their heads, buck, rear, run away, any number of things.|`|1bRRODd2aa	Don't use any martingale with a gag bit.<br>  <br>  I really don't like these bits as they knock the bit against the teeth, there is  no curb chain to prevent the bit from being pulled far too far back in the mouth; so I not surprised at all that he throws his head up to avoid the bit, it will be incredibly painful for him.  You might be happy with the bit, but I'll bet your horse is not.<br>  <br>  Why don't you consider using a true gag (Elevator) bit using it as a double rein system a fixed rein and a running rein.  That way when he's behaving himself, he's being controlled by a true snaffle, the pull on his head will only come into force when he throws his head up.|`|j45Q2ipRaa	I wouldn't recommend this combination.  It is extremely painful to the horse and after a lot of this, he will turn off his brain and continue this behavior that is dangerous for both of you.<br>  <br>  I would go back to the true double reined gag or a pellham and maybe change the noseband and then start re-educating him. Teach him other ways to curb his enthusiasm opposed to avoiding the bit or running with it.  You way also want to work him down prior to taking him out and start with working at walks when you are out on trail where you can then correct the behavior prior to escalation.  Once he learns this can be relaxing and enjoyable it may also help.<br>  <br>  Good Luck and be careful.|`|penuzN8jaa	You could just try "normal" rings they help keep your hands down aswell as the horses head, I have used both on my old pony who was a little um uneasy with jumping or alot of events he didn't like doing ie flagging, He also had a Dutch Gag on and I used it on him with no problem.

Do not give them orange juice because that usually contains some amount of the rind.)<br>  <br>  Most foods you feed provide the same nutrients for them as they do for us. Bananas provide potassium. Dark green, leafy veggies provide vitamin K and folic acids. Foods like garlic, bananas and raspberries have antibiotic properties. Nuts and seeds provide folic acid. Broccoli contains vitamin B2.

I have terriers and walk them at least 6 miles a day, they are older now (6 & 7), when they were younger they needed more exercise. Look at breeds that would be contented with only 30 minutes of exercise or consider rescuing an older dog.|`|qjv7bkxDaa	NO!! Please do ur research on the breed of dog ur interested in. Jack Russels are very energetic and intelligent.  If they are left alone and lack exercise, they become destructive b/c they get BORED!!   U need to walk them for at least an hour-5 days a week and provide them with toys and and "outings" to stimulate their minds-otherwise.<br>   Learn what the history is of the breed u are interested.  Many "cutesy" breeds have been bred for chasing rodents and hunting-which results in a digging dog and one that is always looking for food.  OIther dogs are bred for guarding (pits, bullmastiffs) as well as working (collies-border collies, rat terriers, beagles, labs..)  Go to a professional at a shelter and tell them what is ur lifestyle, knowledge/level of dog ownership, and what ur looking for in disposition. Observe the temperment w/the potential pup b/c it will most like grow into it....<br>  Most importantly, be patient and dedicated|`|XaNvKroGaa	Dogs like little kids need lots of stimulation both mental&physical so even though you may meet its physical exercise requirements you need to keep their minds occupied also. Terrier types are renownde for needing lots of attention to keep them from being bored.

2Ku4DuvCaa	I've had a few birds get motion sick on me before. Just monitor his appetite and his behavior otherwise. If it ended with the car incident, there is likely no problem beyond that.<br>  <br>  You should still call the breeder as you mentioned, or at least an avian vet to be sure.|`|LcdaUleUaa	Almost certainly just motion sickness.  It's a bit rare, but it happens.  <br>  <br>  A bit of fresh ginger root will help out.<br>  Or you can try this stuff:  <br>  <a href="http://www.birdsupplies.com/No-Stress-Homeopathic-Formula-for-Parrots-p/kcstress.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.birdsupplies.com/No-Stress-Ho...</a>|`|vjijiJT3aa	sounds that way, if it vomited from the car ride it's because it couldn't handle it.

Yes, your Parents will be proved right and you might have to eat some crow,  but at least it's out in the open.  As a side note, I'm wondering if it was your Mom that always wanted a bird?  I'm thinking this might be the case.  So, if you play your cards right, Mom gets the Bird and you get the dog.  Sit down and think.  Parents are easily played against eachother.

I got my dog a dog (lol) cause me and my mom both had full time jobs, and i had school and (more bad excuses) so we couldnt give her alot of attention.<br>  So i got her a dog. Still spent some time with them. it did help her a bit, but.....<br>  <br>  They barked at night, dug out, hopped fence, etc<br>  <br>  They did enertain eachother. However, they still need owner attention, and two dogs = twice as much.<br>  <br>  <br>  Its a good idea and bad idea at the same time.<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  Also, dogs are much eiser to train and have better obiedience the less theyre left alone.<br>  <br>  we had another dog, just the one.  i was a kid, my mom didnt work as much, my sis lived at home<br>  So she got more attention than the formentioned.<br>  never barked much, never dug out, didnt seem lonely.|`|9kTejB0uaa	Personally I prefer to have at least two for company and interaction. And there may be an element of not feeling quite so guilty leaving one on his own when I go out!!  However provided you are there most of the time, and bearing in mind you should always be the focus of their attention, not each other, they can be perfectly content to live on their own - in fact some prefer to be the only dog!|`|taLD45Sqaa	Dogs are pack animals so whoever their pack is is who they want to be around, If you are gone lots then, yes, they would probably enjoy another dog in their pack!|`|733da09d0cb9e9d0f08ae79290ca1491aa	as long as they have human company..they loveeeeeeeeeeee it.<br>  <br>  .good to socialize them with other dogs so they dont fight ..<br>  <br>  .theres classes ya can take em too <br>  <br>  or let em sniff & say hello to strange dogs that seem friendly....|`|ErjSVRkqaa	No. Dogs will be happy with just their human pack. :)|`|plx2v4S4aa	Dogs love to spend lots of time with their owner.

However, they absolutely do need to be socialized at an early age with other people and dogs, This is important.|`|z4Huew1daa	it is good for them to interact with other dogs but as long as you have time to love and care for the dog he/she should be ok<br>  hope this helps Rach xox|`|mtRtQIcWaa	dogs love when u spend time with them they also like other dogs|`|NAGiNKFWaa	It depends on the breed.  A breed like Cavalier King Charles Spaniel needs a lot of companionship.  It is not likely that a breeder will sell you this breed unless someone is home to take care of it all day, or you have other dogs.  We had to prove to the breeder that we had other dogs in the house for when I go to the store or run errands.  She doesn't have anxiety attacks, she is just a clingy breed that always wants to be touching you.  My shelties can sleep and my feet when I am on the computer, the Cavie is in the chair with me.
XaNvKroGaa	It sounds as though he's expressing his anal glands as he's afraid, Ive had experience of a police dog doing this&you're right it does stink like a dead body!!!! Maybe look into something to calm his nreves before you get in the car or ask your vet for further advice.|`|qjv7bkxDaa	Wrinkles trap bacteria and cause odor and so does the licking.  Check his breathe and use rawhide and dental gummies to  reduce tartar on teeth.  If u can't keep up on bathing or u get tired of the "smell" try giving him away to a more capable family.|`|wGL2A3C8aa	Maybe he's farting?? Lol. Jk it must be something he ate. Bring him to the vet to check.|`|vUiUoamVaa	I had to really think about this -- and read the question again a couple of times.  <br>  <br>  It is not the food or the water -- it is the car ride.  I can only guess that he is SO excited about the car ride that his body is not able to cope with it?  Externally, he loves it, but internally he does not?<br>  <br>  Geez, sounds like the motion and movement of the car bring this out.  He is perfectly happy being there.  But the movement of the car somehow upsets the "inner dog" and he starts to stink.  I never had such an experience...had dogs puke when the car started to move...but other than that, no problem.  <br>  <br>  It must be internal of some sort - you will likely never diagnose it,,,it is just 'him',|`|9kTejB0uaa	Leaving aside the fact that if you luv Bassets, you should by now love their scent too lol..... it could be his teeth/gums.  When mine pant (which he likely does when in the car because they are not the world's greatest car travellers, although it sounds as if you have one of the exceptions) it can fill the house with 'noxious niffs' - although that clears fast once the doors and windows are open!   If you are bathing him, and it's not his ears, I'd have this checked out.  <br>  <br>  And by the way, they truly don't need to be bathed all the time - it's not good for their coats to continually have the natural oils stripped out.<br>  <br>  Edit - just read the anal gland suggestion, and yes, it could be that although you'd also be smelling that around the house if it was?
OnZDg0AEaa	hi,<br>  <br>  There's no doubt about it, ticks are nasty little buggers. Any creature that attaches itself to your skin and sucks your blood is high on the list of things you want to avoid. Worse yet, ticks present a health risk for both dogs and humans. They can transmit a number of diseases, including Rocky Mountain spotted fever, Lyme disease, and--in the case of the female wood tick--something called tick paralysis.<br>  here's a treatment:<br>   <a href="http://www.mediumurl.com/?r=963340558404613538216180653711" rel="nofollow">http://www.mediumurl.com/?r=963340558404...</a> <br>    <br>  hope this helps.|`|EQz7DDsEaa	tics are really disgusting little bastards at best but what i did with my dog was moved all the hair out of the way and took the ciggarette lighter from my car and burned it (must be very very very carefule not to get ANY hairs of the dog) when i washed him and got him a flea and tic collar from there on out cant really remember another problem with them|`|K1prVAsjaa	Hopefully you removed it carefully without leaving the head still in the dog. If you use flea and tick drops on your dog's back once a month, this would not be problem. Personally, I use Frontline TopSpot. There are no fleas within my dog's living range, and ticks will not stay on it.|`|9d8438febeda9f081685c3c773c13d90aa	If it was just one tick, then don't worry so much...<br>  If it makes you feel any better, I was a breeder of champion show brittanies and field trial brittanies for 15 years...Sometimes a dog would come home COVERED in ticks...In those 15 years "knock on wood", I never had one case of lyme desease...<br>  For the next time this happens (it will happen), don't pull the bugger out from it's belly...Het your fingernails as close to doggers skin as possible and litterally dig into the skin and remove it head first...Because, believe it or not, if you pull the main body off the head can remain attached...I know, eww...<br>  And have a small bowl of alcohol to drop the SOB into...It will die immediately.. :-)|`|9kTejB0uaa	Don't worry, provided you got it all off (and it sounds as if you did) the wound left behind should heal over.  There could be others so I suggest you check carefully (ears, shoulders are the usual places - and face sometimes) use something like Frontline as a preventative.<br>  <br>  Nasty critters!  Mine go down the sink along with HOT WATER.  If you live near sheep (although farmers are supposed to dip them) or deer you will, unfortunately get them.  And check yourself too - hubby had one up his leg, and he always wears thick socks and trousers when exercising our lot!!
PIwP8DFxaa	no they do not eat fish so do not do not|`|Rlm7VjeEaa	You can, but I don't think they'd eat the fish.... they might. Ours didn't.<br>  <br>  Not really. I'd put the bowl in a corner near their hide out and heat the opposite end. The reason is because when they're in their hide out, its to cool off so you want it as cool as you can get with it still being warm. Remember, they're tropical reptiles and need heat but not too much. That's why the go into the hide out--to cool down from the heat.<br>  <br>  And you can control the heat source by buying a heated rock and using a large light. Not one of those florescent long ones but one with an actual light bulb.<br>  <br>  And yes, it needs to be on at all times. If snakes get too cold, they get sick. And I wouldn't bother getting a separate type of bulb for night. Its a money scam|`|f8cd152c1974c8efa419c1a70fd40f6aaa	There is no need to put feeder fish in the water bowl.  The python should be fed mice preferably thawed if it will take it.  As long as you are monitoring temperatures on both sides of the tank it doesn't matter which side is hotter as long a there are two zones that the snake can regulate its body temperature in. The nocturnal light is a color the snake can not see so you can use it for warmth at night and not disturb the snakes day/night cycle. Ball pythons do not need the nutrients from natural light like other reptiles because they are nocturnal.  I use an under tank heater on the side with the hide which is important because this is where they will go to digest after a meal and they need the heat.  The nocturnal light can be used in creating the warmer area of the tank.  Again, be sure to regulate temperatures.|`|he18hGKNaa	The feeding fish are hit or miss.  It depends on each particular snake if they'll eat em or not.  As for the heat... typically you'd have a heated basking side, then the hideout and food on the other side.<br>  <br>  If the space is limited, you can use the top of the hideout as a basking area, and point the entrance to the inside of the hideout toward the cooler side, with the food on the cooler side.  Thats a common setup.<br>  <br>  And they dont need light 24 hours a day.  It's probably easiest to buy one of those plug timers.  I bought mine for $5 at walmart.  I set mine to have 9 hours of dark.  You want to try to get their environment as similar to the outside world as possible.  Typically its dark outside for 8-10 hours of the day, so the snake in the tank should experience similar situations.<br>  <br>  The nocturnal lights are strictly for your own amusement.  Ball pythons cant see the red or blue lights that are used for nocturnal lamps.  They're naturally pretty shy animals, and will typically go out of their dwelling more often than not just to hunt or aid in shedding their skin.  The nocturnal light is so you can see them when they're active at night.  In the snakes eyes... the lights are all off.<br>  <br>  Have fun :) A ball python can be a blast.|`|fbZjUTCRaa	corn snakes, garder snakes eat fish not constricters . they should be fed in a seperate cage anyways. the heat lamp should be somewhere he can bask under it. you should turn the light off at night as he is nocturnal, but keep a heating pad on low under the tank. dont let the temp get under 75 degrees(or over 85 during the day-90 where he basks)|`|sSJ8zfebaa	shouldnt be feeding fish to ball python.for the correct nutrition they need to be eating mice or rats of the right size)equal to their widest width-you will kill your snake otherwise|`|AA12122290	You need to make some changes . First Ball Pythons will only eat mice or small rats/rodents . Forget about the fish .The reson you have a water bowl is for hydration and to increase the humidity level in the cage . Ball Pythons are tropical snakes . They will not soak in the bowl like other snakes . You should have two identical hides , one for each side of the tank. They are timid snakes and need two hides so he can regulate his body temp. and stili feel safe .You can make nice hide by turning a plastic container up side down or bowl and cutting a hole in it . They like dark,,low,  snug hides so they can feel it against their sides .You should also buy an under the tank heater and rheostat . Place it under only half of the tank. You will also need two digital thermometers , one with a hydrometer so you can accurately monitor the temps. and humidity level. You can buy them at most department stores for under $20. Dial or stick on thermometers are not accurate . Having the proper temp. gradient and humidity levels are extremely important in order for good health and to get your snake to eat. The temps should be 90-95*F warm end , 80*F cool end . Night time temp can go down to 80* through out but never lower . Humidity should be 50-60% . Can be slightly increased when shedding .You should not use heat lights on a Ball Pythons cage . It dries the snake and cage out to much . NEVER use a heat rock for a snake . It can cause thermal burns very easily .They simply are not safe .Do not handle your snake until it is eating on a regular basis . Feed only thawed frozen prey . You can tell the size by looking at the largest part of your snake . Never feed anything larger than the largest girth of your snake . Ball Pythons have small necks so I would go slightly smaller .Ball Pythons are nocturnal reptiles . He will sleep during the day and be active at night . The only light he needs is ordinary day light . You should not use any heat light or lights in the enclosure .I would not use the nocturnal light . Many reptiles can still see it and it could disrupt his natural cycle.<br>  <br>  I would like to ask the person that gave me a thumbs down, why ? I have given accurate ,excellant information from years of experience . I can also back up each and every recommendations I have given .
kvBdTLOMaa	when u got your betta was it in a cup or in a large filtered tank with many other bettas?<br>   if it was in a cup its not used to the current and it need to develop muscles. try turning on the filter for 15 mins then let hiom sit for an hour then again. repeat couple of times a day when u start to see results in his buoyancy increase the "on" time until he can handle it. if u dont see results in max a month there is something wrong with the fish. also since the filter isnt on the whole time ur tank will get dirty so change 40 or 50% of the water daily. you dont want to replace all because ur fish will get tired and die.   <br>  if your betta was in a big filtered tank with other bettas take him to petco and state your problem. they should replace it. <br>  if you do not want to rreplace it tell them u would like a refund but keep upr fish in a small glass fish bowl change water once a week.<br>  bettas are the lowest maintenance you can get out of a fish. <br>  im not a fish doctor so these suggestions may not work.<br>  best of luck!!

Best thing to do is be proactive and keep the ear canal aired and dry.  When you bathe her put cotton balls in her ears.  That will help keep water from going deep into the canal.  Just put the cotton in the way you'd put it in your ears, meaning don't stuff it down into the canal.|`|AA11244754	use your search bar and type in ear infections in dogs, it will give you several links, it really easy...also better known as researching it yourself, which would have taken you LESS time than posting a question on here and waiting for it to appear which takes at the very minimum 5 minutes from the time you click Post to the time it actually shows then for people to answer!|`|41m6RZ4Jaa	scrathing of the ear and biting of the ear. i got a cocker spaniel mix with miniatue poodle pupppy last month. i love cocker spaniels lol. let the good times roll
P8hOtEdOaa	There is nothing in your city code.<br>  <br>  The state of Washington specifically exempts them from their wild animal laws:<br>  <br>  RCW 16.30.010<br>  Definitions.  <br>  <br>  (1) "Animal control authority" means an entity acting alone or in concert with other local governmental units for enforcement of the animal control laws of the city, county, and state and the shelter and welfare of animals.<br>  <br>       (2) "Potentially dangerous wild animal" means one of the following types of animals, whether bred in the wild or in captivity, and any or all hybrids thereof:<br>  <br>       (a) Class mammalia<br>  <br>       (i) Order carnivora<br>  <br>          (B) Family canidae, wolves, excluding wolf-hybrids;<br>  <br>  *** However, there is currently a bill in the Senate, SB 5383, which would remove that exemption making it illegal to own a wolf hybrid.  Contact your state senator and ask him/her not to support this bill.  Click on link to keep track of this bill.

6cbce34f6d81808399f7101c75d8526baa	If yahoo would cooperate I have been trying to get this answer thru since 6 am<br>  It sounds like you are really trying hard to take good care of him. What kind of substrate do you have him on? Since he is 1 1/2 yrs old you could use washed play sand. I have been using that in all of mine with no problems. A dragon that age might not poop every day either. Are you dusting his crickets with calcium? Have you tried giving him some super worms? As far as keeping the heat up in the cage, you could put some cardboard on three sides to help insulate it. I have heard of people using that plastic film wrap on their cages to help keep heat in but I have not used that. During the winter I use the cardboard. You could also use a ceramic hat emitter, I have to use one one one of my cages to keep the temps up. You know you can also use household bulbs to help with the heat. You do not have to use the expensive basking bulbs. Make sure your UVB is a good one and change it every 6 months. <br>  The only real problem that I see is what you are feeding him concerning his veggies. Lettuce, corn and cabbage are NO NOs. Never feed them that. No nutritional value in the lettuces at all.<br>  You should be giving him a salad of a mix of several greens chosen from collard, turnip, mustard and dandelion greens every day.<br>  You can top that with shredded acorn or butternut squash, sweet potato, green beans, peas, okra, parsnips and butter beans. Some you need to shred and others cut up fine enough for him to eat. These foods are your staple foods. <br>  Occasionally you can vary the diet by adding these foods listed below but they are not everyday foods. Carrots, carrot tops, coriander, kale, swiss chard, beets, bell peppers, broccoli, cauliflower, celery, cucumber, pumpkin, rutabaga, spaghetti squash, yellow squash and zucchini squash. But remember these are not everyday foods so lay off those carrots.<br>  You can also offer fruit only as a treat and not every day. Choose from apples, bananas, blackberries, cantaloupe, honeydew melon, kiwi, peaches, pears, raspberries, strawberries and watermelon.<br>  In the summer you can grow flowers like roses, hibiscus, dahlia and nasturtiums as they love the flowers but be sure no sprays have been used. Also dandelions from the yard but again be sure no sprays could have been used anywhere on these or close to them.<br>  Mine absolutely love raspberries and strawberries. They go crazy for peas. I use the frozen ones and just thaw them out and put a few on top of the salad. They will pick those out immediately and look up as if you say is that all, can't I have more? <br>  As far as your feeding schedule - I put a fresh salad in mine each day before I leave for work. I do not give the crickets until I get home around 4-5 and then they only get them every other day as they are all adults now and need that salad more.<br>  You can go on line and get super worms by the 1000 and they are really easy to keep. I just put mine in on ground up oatmeal, unsweetened cereal, crackers and powdered milk with a few egg cartons and greens for their moisture. Look at southerncricket.com at their prices. Crickets are so stinky that we use them now as a treat but they too need to be gut loaded before feeding to your beardie.<br>  Do you have a good digital probe thermometer. They are really nice and make checking temps so easy from the tank to the tub.<br>  That's about it for right now.Keep up the good work and if I can be of any more help to you, just email me. I check it often and will get back to you asap.
GUFb4TZVaa	get him to the vet for the snip !!!|`|m0a7Ox1maa	easy fix - desex him!!|`|WqGxGJkbaa	Your cat needs to be neutered.  If you are putting him outside without being neutered you are running the risk of him disappearing in search of a mate and never seeing him again.  He will also continue spraying outside which will attract other cats and then the fighting will start.  This can lead to serious wounds and even feline aids.  If you knew it was inevitable, why have you let it happen?  I am afraid you are being irresponsible and almost certainly adding to the ever increasing population of unwanted kittens.<br>  <br>  Once neutered he should calm down and stop spraying, although there is no guarantee that it will stop completely.  If he feels happy and secure in his environment he will have less need to spray.  When you get him home from the vet I would use Feliway Artificial Pheromone Diffuers around your house for the first few weeks as this will help to calm and reassure him.|`|8e9718a3714dc906919f4f8f94450b65aa	Yeah, you ned to get him fixed or else he's not gonna stop spraying. On top of that it's hard to get rid of the smell. I've had that once happen to me. Next day he went to the vet.|`|yRzEkPnpaa	either you take your cat to an operation or maybe try putting orange peels on it favourite spraying spot.|`|x3VqcTjCaa	Do you have pepper spray?
H06PtiIAaa	what type of lighting do you have? how long has the tank been going?<br>  <br>  When i got my frog spawn frag, it took less than an hour from out of the bag to my aquarium for it to open fully.<br>  <br>  Either your water parameters arent correct or you lighting isnt enough.|`|8owlj2xHaa	Have you tried moving it to a position that has either more or less light and or flow than it does now. Check your alkalinity and ph. <br>  Euphyllia does not like a lot of hard flow.
EP3N26mIaa	Well.. it's a part of life that creatures get sick. Humans get cancer and all sorts of things. So it's a part of life and yes in that sense it's normal. <br>  <br>  Of course, you should make sure your cat has clean dishes, clean food and isn't eating anything it shouldn't be. This will help her stay healthy!<br>  <br>  If she is continuing to act strange and sick, I would take her to a different vet!|`|NGmRMqe6aa	Did you call the vet and ask him.? It is not normal and you need to have more Information from the vet.
32ed2884882d13680bd2f9e8ee367fc9aa	I won't yell at you!  Things happen and sometimes they don't get there but you are doing right now so you get a pat on the back from me.<br>  <br>  <br>  so my questions are:<br>  <br>  how do i make an appointment for my cats?(for the first time)<br>  <br>  Call the number and tell them you would like to make an appt. for an adult cat age unknown but you think between five and seven years of age.  Tell them she is spayed.  Tell them you have a 7 month old cat, male, neutered and that he has had all his kitten shots but you don't have the paperwork as he was a rescue. <br>  <br>  They will ask you for your name, address and telephone number and of course the color and names of the cats.  They will then offer you different appt. days and times or you can state what days of the week and times you can come in and they will find you a slot and the appt. is made.  All you do then is show up with the cats.<br>  <br>  should i make the appointment over the phone or should i go to the place and tell them?<br>  <br>  It makes no difference.  It's the same.  Calling saves you a trip and nothing is different for making the appt.  Call and save some gas money.   The only reason to go in person is if you want to check the place out such as the waiting room, general things, available parking and such.  As long as this is a licensed veterinarian in the USA  having been around for a while you should do fine.<br>  <br>  what questions will they ask me and what shots will my cats need?<br>  <br>  They will ask you about both cats eating habits, what food they eat, brand and wet (canned) or dry.  They will ask you about elimination habits (use of litterbox), behavior.  They will ask if they are indoor only cats or both indoor and outdoor.<br>  <br>  The shots your cats need will be determined by what shots they have had in the past, how long ago the shots were given, if they are strictly indoor only cats or both indoor and outdoor cats and other factors such as age.<br>  <br>  You may also be advised to allow  them  to administer a wormer to the 7 month old cat or both depending on different factors.<br>  <br>  should i bring them one at a time or at the same time?<br>  <br>  The appt. can be for both cats and some vets give a multiple pet discount.  There isn't any reason why they would want you to make seperate appts. for each cat for a first visit for each with no current health problems or complaints.<br>  <br>  You may be told to bring a fresh fecal sample with you for each cat.  If you are not told this ask if you should bring it.  Just put each cat's poop into it's own zip bag, double it!   This would be for testing for worms.<br>  <br>  You must have the cats in a cat carrier, plastic ones are great and you can buy them cheap at walmart, target and other stores.  You should have a carrier for each cat but if you only have one right now that would be ok but try to have  two carriers for two cats as at some point one may have to be in it's own carrier due to illness, injury or surgery.<br>  <br>  It is very important that you transport these cats in a carrier and not holding in a towel or other.  Safety is a real concern and the carrier is the best place for them going to the vets and in the waiting room.  <br>  <br>  can you still make regular check ups at an animal HOSPITAL or is it only for emergencies?   <br>  <br>  You can make well exams (check ups) at any veterinarian practice be they call themselves a clinic, hospital or whatever.  Only after hours emergency clinics would be out as they only handle medical and surgical emergencies, accidents, poisonings or acute onset of serious symptoms. <br>  <br>  thank you soo much because im really confused right now!!<br>  <br>  You're welcome.<br>  <br>  Some other hints.  If your cats are not used to being in a carrier try putting in a nice towel folded over with some cat treats and letting the door open.  They will go in and out and see that it doesn't hurt them.  Let the carrier in your home all the time with the door open.  After they see there is no harm to them place them in the carrier and close the door for a few minutes, give them a little treat each.  <br>  <br>  Also, and I am not being mean please know that the majority of veterinary practices do not offer or extend credit to unestablished clients so please be prepared to pay the bill in full with either cash or credit card or if a personal check have your driver's license or photo ID.<br>  <br>  Ask the person making the appt. what the fees are for exam for each cat, this should be pretty straight forward as most have a set fee for a new patient exam.  The shots and possible worming will vary according to what you need.  <br>  <br>  And in the future should you need any procedure or diagnostic done on a cat never be afraid to ask what the cost will be.|`|AA10265922	you can make the appointment over thr phone,take all pets in for a check up|`|L0xlHKCeaa	Just phone the vet and explain to the receptionist what your needs are.|`|x0WZE0i4aa	>how do i make an appointment for my cats?(for the first time)<br>  <br>  >should i make the appointment over the phone or should i go to the place and tell them?<br>  <br>  I'd phone first, they'll tell you if you need to go in.<br>  <br>  >what questions will they ask me and what shots will my cats need?<br>  <br>  They'll probably ask generally how they are, are they eating OK, anything changed, drinking more than they used to?<br>  <br>  Shots depends on what country they are in.  Flu, rabies (if you are in the States), FLV maybe just for the youngster.  If you don't have your paperwork you may have to start from scratch rather than just have a booster.  The older one will probably need the flu from scratch because of the time it's been.<br>  <br>  >should i bring them one at a time or at the same time?<br>  <br>  That depends on them and you.  If you have separate carriers for them you can take them both.  If you want them to go in one you might want to ask when you phone how long the wait is going to be... and do a trial run first to check they'll be OK with sharing a carrier.<br>  <br>  >can you still make regular check ups at an animal HOSPITAL or is it only for emergencies?<br>  <br>  I think that will vary from place to place: check when you phone.|`|tHXx81jcaa	Hi<br>  <br>  All you have to do is find a vet that you trust and give them a call.  Maybe a family member or friend could recommend one?<br>  <br>  They should be able to tell you everything you need to know/do.<br>  <br>  If none of the cats have seen a vet I urge you to do this asap.  Just like us, they need regular check ups.<br>  <br>  Hope this help and good luck|`|V3OOBr9Qaa	call the vet shell tell u everthing they will do for you good luck|`|m16gf9mzaa	To make an appointment, call the place.  It is great to have the written records of previous veterinary care, such as the dates of when various shots were given, but they will also accept an oral medical history (i.e. you tell them the best you can).  They will ask the name, age, sex of each animal, along with any medical conditions they have or had in the past, if the animal is spayed/neutered, if their shots are current, possibly what kind of food they eat, and other general health questions.  <br>  <br>  As for what shots they will require or recommend, that varies by country and region - both because of what diseases may be common in the area and because local regulations may differ. For instance, I have lived in a place where cats were not legally required to have rabies vaccinations, in a place where cats were required to have them every three years and wear tags to prove it, and I currently live in a place where cats are legally required to have the rabies vaccine every year but they do not have to wear tags.  Your veterinarian will be able to advise you as to what vaccines are required, and which ones are recommended for your area.  <br>  <br>  Calling and talking to them should be pretty easy - and if not, perhaps that would be a sign that you should choose a different veterinary practice to deal with, because being able to communicate readily with the veterinarians and their staff will be a big key to the care your cats receive. I know that I appreciate being able to frankly discuss my budget and how to get the most cost effective care for my cats within my budget.  Another thing I expect to be able to discuss with the vets and their staff, is when I see symptoms of illness in my cats, whether or not they are serious symptoms meaning the cat needs to be seen right away, or if it is something I can just keep an eye on.  They have also been helpful about discussing home  care, and prevention of disease.  I hope that you can develop this kind of relationship with your veterinarian as well.<br>  <br>  As for bringing your cats in all at once or separately, well that is very much personal preference.  I have two cats, and I take them in separately - probably mostly because I got them at different times and was able to bring them to the vet soon after getting them. So I just keep making their annual visits at the same time of year as their original visits - one cat gets his shots in the summer, and one gets hers in the winter.  But I can see how it might be convenient to take all your animals in at one time.  And I know I see other pet owners bringing in more than one animal at the same time.  So it really depends on what you think will work for you.<br>  <br>  Many veterinary practices call themselves animal hospitals but it is not exactly the same as a human hospital, because the veterinarian will offer all medical services such as ordinary office visits, as well as emergency care and overnight stays for acute or chronic conditions requiring that level of care. Many veterinary practices also offer services such as boarding and grooming.|`|5PsKGss7aa	Dont get why you adopted the kitten and not having enough money to take it in for the initial look over.. you better be glad he didnt have something from the shelter and gave it your older cat which you would have to pay more for...<br>  <br>  Anyway you said that the older one has seen a vet a long time before, just re call them up if you dont mind them and ask about it.. and yes, you will more then likey will need those papers for the kitten... <br>  You can either call them or just go down.. going down might be easier so you can fill out the papers then and not later when you bring them in.. as for going together, up to you if you can handle them both the same time.
WsMMHEjDaa	One male to three females is a good combination. When kept in large schools, it not only lets them show off there natural behavior, it also lessens their aggression. They can be fin nippers but are really not known as being stalkers or hunter/killers|`|JvTF7UrMaa	i personaly wouldnt go with tiger barbs, they are way to agressive towards other fish. but if you are stuck on them i would go with a ratio of 1 male to 2 females but if you have more than 6 they turn into pack hunters but they are just as agressive alone :S but somtimes being in large groups can calm them down. if your going to have them in thier own tank id go with the one male to 2 females. any ways hope they are ok lots of love zack x x x|`|cToJQNknaa	Try two males and 4 females. This ensures makes aggression levels go down because tiger barbs need to be in groups of at least six so they don't single out on fish and pick on him or her. And also when spawning fish you want their to be one male to two or more female ratios.
e6wo7czgaa	Your bird may be unhappy. I suggest spending more time with it and/or giving some new toys. the bird could be bored, and needs something that will work its brain. And its very true that your bird could be lonely, however just because you get another bird doesn't mean they'll like each other at first. Get another cage for the other bird, just a heads up which I think you know  will be needed. You could always play soft, low volume music for the bird to see if it will enjoy it or have a competition with it- which may involve screaming.  Just try out what I suggested than get the other bird.   I hope that was helpful.|`|GHefTsUyaa	I had a bird like that once,but she made up for it in other ways.|`|enC9TvxUaa	-What kind of bird?

Sunshine seems to do a lot for a bird's singing vocabulary!|`|x5HMQgQyaa	First you need to say what type of bird you have.     Some species of birds don't sing, it isn't in their nature.     Sometimes, birds from species that naturally sing (like canaries) just don't. They are individuals like you and I, and  some just don't like to sing.    Make sure your bird is in proper heath. If you are extremely worried, you might want to consider a vet visit, to make sure there isn't anything physically wrong with him.|`|qbP5uAuJaa	Its probably not happy enough to sing. It either needs a partner, more attention, or more freedom. Don't get so upset about it. Just love it for what your bird is.|`|DxTvJhjZaa	1st- What kind of bird do you have ?    2nd- If you have a canary and it is female it doesn't sing anything.    3rd- It doesn't matter that it is lonely.    4th- I know this information because i'm a breeder of birds.
ADjeuxIiaa	Dogs are pack animals and don't judge each other on looks like people do. Any dog is fine with a maltese as long as they are raised correctly.|`|wS9TkFcvaa	Any type of dog would be good, but I'd go with something the same size anything bigger might get too rough when they play and hurt the little maltese. My friends have a yorkie and a maltese and they do great together! Good luck!|`|nYv65TlEaa	any dog is fine,it just may take your maltese 2 weeks to get use to a new puppy,mine was terrified of my puppy girl when I brought her home,wiht in 2 week he started napping iwht her,and been love ever since|`|0UxjzoUxaa	Any kind of dog can live with any, it all depends on their personality and their temperament. It best to have them meet before bringing them home to see if they can get along first to avoid any complications..|`|NMQWAFkTaa	One about the same size or within about 2-5lbs of his weight. And I would get a female. It is always best to get the opposite sex. Another maltese would be great. Or I had a lady just get a small female maltese from me and she had a yorkie male. They get along great. Maltese are fearless and get jealous easily so if they growled at a larger dog the Maltese could get hurt. We have Toy Poodles and they get along good also.
