pjgQAXM7aa	That actually seems pretty good. The better the breakfast the better you get. :)|`|9qiLZp50aa	No, it's really important to eat breakfast. If you eat at 6:00 and wake up without eating breakfast, then eat at 12:00 that is way too long for your body to go without eating. Breakfast is the meal that wakes you up and gets your body ready for the day.|`|u5y8kE81aa	no|`|xOoe5PTraa	no. there was a men's health study that said there is a an inverse relationship between breakfast and waist size. the more you eat for breakfast, the smaller your waist size and vice versa.
kGsRFXRhaa	just slightly. With your weight and height, you have a BMI of 26.2. BMI is a measure of body weight compared to height. It's usually pretty accurate at measuring body fat, unless you're a body builder or for some reason have a lot of muscle mass. So, at 26.2, that puts you in the over weight category. Anything above 25.1 is considered overweight. And then above 29.9 is obese. So for 5'3", just losing 8 pounds would put you in the "Normal" range (at about a BMI of 24.7). Anything below 19.1 is considered underweight, just so you have a reference point.|`|0MODZ0Iwaa	you're pretty normal i think|`|o5aHZ1Xdaa	Assuming your an adult, your health weight range is somewhere between 113 to 141 pounds.    I have no idea of your situation, given the details you provided, but i would recommend -- as a  start -- to eat slightly smaller and more healthy/natural meals and walk whenever possible, you could even try to fit a bit of excise into your normal routine.    simple lifestyle adjustments can really make a difference in your overall health and happiness. Give it a few months and you'll see some serious results, keep it up and you'll be totally fine!    good luck!    -Shamar    (how did i get 3 thumbs down? what you possibly be wrong with my answer? i think that one answer with the one thumb up is stacking the deck, if you know what i mean!)|`|wyulHZTbaa	That's really not too bad. As long as you look proportional it shouldn't be a problem. But shorter people usually weigh in around 90-120 so you're not too far off.|`|Dzr2ZcdZaa	you should lose about 12 pounds and that will be healthy|`|48Wd4b6iaa	To find out whether or not you are proportionate the NHI uses something called a Body Mass Index. Yours is 26.2.  According to them:        *  Underweight =       * Normal weight = 18.5-24.9      * Overweight = 25-29.9      * Obesity = BMI of 30 or greater    YOU have to judge whether or not that makes you overweight.|`|gPE0wRTGaa	That's funny, someone just asked that question and was the same height and weight, so I'll just say the same thing I told her if you don't mind...    You're just a little bit overweight--like a tiny bit! Your BMI would be 26.2, and the healthy average is 18.5-24.9. But then again, it depends on your frame and the density of your body. If you have more muscle then you're perfectly fine don't do anything since muscle weighs a ton. Otherwise, just lose like two or three pounds. Nothing major. Don't go crazy and don't feel bad. A lot of people are only a few pounds overweight (I was recently) and it's really easy to lose weight. I just started eating fruit for snacks and buying pre-proportioned chips and desserts for lunch and dessert so I was limited to how much I could eat (I don't know about you, but my problem was that I couldn't say no to food and preproportioned things work really well) and I lost five pounds in two weeks and I'm still losing weight. Drinking a lot of water actually does wonders.|`|BBlRUMpRaa	*  Underweight =       * Normal weight = 18.5-24.9      * Overweight = 25-29.9      * Obesity = BMI of 30 or greater  your bmi is 26.2|`|e4hPmzw5aa	yep you should be around 120 im 6'0 and i weigh 150 and doc says im healthy|`|I15chbBhaa	Damn!

UZJ7wVc8aa	If you want to lose weight, you need to two things: eat less and exercise more. Weight gain happens when you create a calorie surplus (eat more than you burn). Your body takes the excess calories and converts them to fat which get stored around your stomach, arms and thighs. The longer you remain in a calorie surplus, the more weight you'll gain. To lose that weight, you need to do the opposite. You need to create a calorie deficit (start eating less than you burn).     Your first step is to figure out how many calories you burn on a daily basis. This calculator will help you out http://calorieneedscalculator.com The number you get from this tool is what your body burns on a daily basis. To lose weight, simply eat less. It sounds a lot easier than it is but making small changes helps you adjust to a new lifestyle. Don't think of this as a diet, think of it as a new life. Instead of eating foods high in sugars, white flour and saturated fat, go with fruits, vegetables, whole wheats, fish, lean meats, nuts and beans. In addition to eating less, you also need to exercise more. Start off at 1-2 times per week and work your way up to 3-5 times per week.    Don't make all of these changes at once or you won't be able to properly adjust to them. Generally, eating healthier foods will decrease your calorie intake. Compare a doughnut to an apple and you'll see that healthy foods are lower in calories. You can find some more information at the Beginner's Guide to Dieting - http://straightdiet.com|`|vMprJhbSaa	ok, save yourself some time, I have put together a list of websites that work and will help you lose weight quick and effective.    http://weight-loss-camps-for-adults.blog...  http://the-weight-loss-systems.blogspot....

ta1s6Hq2aa	Alot of girls beleive it is wrong, or they shouldn't be doing and if they do they certainly don't tell their friends as they find it embarassing, most girls reactions would be 'ew',  Many believe it is a guy thing just like watching porn...quite frankly i don't find anything wrong or disgusting with either and will talk openly about it.   Also some don't find it sexually pleasing so they don't bother.    Hope that gave you an insight to a girls mind on masturbation =]|`|hy90Q5pTaa	im afraid it will hurt..|`|A4bdvg1Yaa	i don't do it. because i think it's gross,  & it's gross because, you pee & have your period down there,  so why would you want to stick your hands or whatever down there?|`|52VDjbNTaa	I know some people that don't.

You can do it without help, but its also a good thing if your in a relationship and your not ready for sex, you can practice with mutual masturbation.|`|CY7rPa6oaa	have u ever though they could be saving them self for some one special to do it then they will start.  and don't u think it is a bit off a pervy question to be asking i am only answering it to tell you but still. and most people do find it desgusting   just keep ur opinions to ur self pls|`|CSPKKFunaa	I don't have a problem masturbating but you question is so out of line.|`|Z11jZXOmaa	sometimes it does hurt for girls to stick stuff inside you know.

rnQjDbAdaa	You should be okay but I would call a pharmacy and talk to the pharmacist about the morning after pill.  You may not need to take it but the pharmacist can tell you for sure and can also give you the pill.  Any time you miss a pill you should use a condom for up to two weeks to avoid pregnancy.  Good luck!|`|WtQIg0UKaa	You should be fine so don't get stressed out.  Continue to take your pills normally and try not to forget again.  If you notice any changes in your period however it would be best to contact your doctor or take a pregnancy test.|`|Xg8Tzjfraa	If you were going to get pregnant, you will get pregnant on the actual day of the sex.  Taking the pill afterwards will not prevent it, but could terminate the new life that has just begun.|`|Jm6rZgiLaa	Umm..|`|jLLkSWyiaa	yes .. because what the pill does is it biulds a wall of mucus so that its harder for the sperm to get through .. if you just miss one day your gonna be fine|`|5cDVQED5aa	it is not goin to cover  unless u took the pill before 12 hours after forgetting it. if it was longer than 12 hours hen u will not b covered by the pill and will now not b covered for the next 7 days|`|OhrysGKIaa	Well, your chances of getting pregnant are increased, but not likely.  you are probably still okay.|`|KZfYzhZRaa	take the day after pill just to be sure:)

Take the dress to a seamstress and get it taken in.  It will be very inexpensive and you will feel more comfortable in the dress.  If this isn't an option try drinking alot of water and eating some salty foods.  It will make you bloated but you won't feel your best at the wedding, so think about that first.  Good luck!|`|OnzUAVdUaa	no dont gain weight cuz u could gain it in the wrong places. just get a bigger size.|`|01GbQLZwaa	my mom needed to gain weight after she had a few surgeries and what worked for her was just eating bigger meals at each meal. You metabolism will adjust to the diet so you wont get fat but it will help put on a few extra healthy pounds. also i guess you could try just drinking a lot of fluid to get water weight and after the wedding just go to a sauna and sweat out the excess. Good Luck|`|emJ79qagaa	I think your fine. Get a new dress in a size 2 or 1 what ever you are. Don't try to gain any weight. You will regret it.

a866601a94a7a1716764f0de1f5f846caa	1500 is far too low for someone of your body dimensions anyway.  At your size and exercise level, you should look to eat 2300-2100 per day to lose weight.  At 2100 you'll lose about 1lb a week, which means it'll take a year to drop to 180.  Don't be put off by this, slow and steady is far healthier than a crash diet (which tends to fail 9 times out of 10 anyway).    You might want to consider dropping the weights and doing a bit of cardio instead 3x a week.    If you need a diet plan to suit you, check out my source.
weBvwrloaa	about two years ago I started swelling and noticed it first when I would go in to brush my teeth. The whole right side of my face up into the ear and the side of my neck would swell and it would be painful.I could feel a little knot in my cheek after a week or so, so I went to the doctor twice with this and on the second visit she sent my to a ears, nose and throat specialist. Turns out, I had a lymph gland in my cheek near the  pouch (yes, apparently we have pouches in our cheeks) that was pissed off and angry for some reason. He had to remove it (in office procedure) because it kept causing issues with swelling and pain. It took about 45 minutes and i got three stitches to close the incision. When he removed it, it was the size of a chick pea. It turned out to be just angry-not malignant or anything serious. He said it just happens sometimes.
ItJzrvQ4aa	jogging is an excellent exercise because it let you lose weight  evenly throughout your whole body. If you want to lose weight in  specific areas, you should target them with exercises. If they are  your problem areas, they will be very difficult to tone. You will have  to work double on them. The best approach is this:  1. Lower/control your daily calorie intake (control for normal  weight, lower for overweight).  2. Run/jog to lower your overall body fat percentage.  3. Target your problem areas with exercises.  an  excellent  exercise,  you  can do it in front of your TV: sit on a  stool,  and  put  your toes under something (piece of heavy furniture,  for  example). In your hands hold a little dumbbell. Please, make sure  that  it  is  not very heavy, start with one kilo, for example, or you  will  damage  your  back and spine! Slowly move the upper part of your  body  back, until it's parallel with the ground. Stop for a second and  move it back to the sitting position. Repeat ten times. Every week add  to  the  number  of  repetitions.  You will see the results in a week,  guaranteed! You will see or feel under the fat - if you have any - six  pack  and  muscles.  Dumbbells  do  wonders.  Much  better  than these  crunches  -  I  came  up to three hundreds and there was no results AT  ALL. With the dumbbells you will see it in a week.

CilhtOGGaa	Some of the symptoms are frequent urge to urinate and a painful, burning feeling in the area of the bladder or urethra during urination. Feeling bad all overtired, shaky, washed outand to feel pain even when not urinating. Women might feel an uncomfortable pressure in their lower abdomen, even pain.  Men will usually feel pressure, pain or a fullness in the lowest part of their backside.    The urinary system consists of the kidneys, ureters, bladder, and urethra.    An infection will occur when bacteria cling to the opening of the urethra and begin to multiply.    Infections, especially if you had one for a period of time and are feeling advanced symptoms, won't go away on their own.  Sometimes, untreated infections can spread to other organs, get into the blood stream and spread throughout the body causing serious and sometimes life threatening conditions.  You should see a doctor right away and get it treated before it gets any worse. Hope you feel better soon.|`|t5BSU06Faa	Sounds like you have a UTI. Have you recently had sex? They are often triggered that way.    You'll need to get antibiotics to cure the infection. It normally doesn't fix itself. If left it could actually get worse (blood in your urine, pain in your stomach etc). Sometimes it feels like it's getting better, but the bacteria is still there and the pain will come back.    Drink lots of water!!! Take some advil to try and soothe some pain. You probably feel like you have to urinate, but when you try nothing comes out. The more water you drink the better...it will help flush out the bacteria. You'll still need antibiotics to cure it.     Many people suggest drinking pure cranberry juice as a preventative measure (too late now if you have one already). There are also cranberry pills that you can take if you don't like the taste of the juice.     After sex make sure you go to the bathroom right away, it will lower the risks of getting another infection. Again, drink water right after as well.    If they continue to happen it might not be a bladder infection, it could be something different. Your doctor might send you for ultrasounds or to a urologist to make sure you dont have cists or kidney stones.     Chances are good you just have UTI and should go give a urine sample right away. The sooner you see a doctor the sooner youll feel better!    Get well soon. Bladder infections are miserable. I hope this helps!|`|3d1XRIzkaa	Infection of the urinary tract. Narrow tubes carry urine from the kidneys to the bladder. It is not so common in men. The infection occurs when microorganisms, usually bacteria from the digestive tract, cling to the opening of the urethra and begin to multiply. Most infections arise from one type of bacteria, Escherichia coli (E.coli),which normally lives in the colon.|`|o5aHZ1Xdaa	A urinary tract infection is an infection that begins in your urinary system. Your urinary system is composed of the kidneys, ureters, bladder and urethra. Any part of your urinary system can become infected, but most infections involve the lower urinary tract  the urethra and the bladder  so depending on how long this has been going on i would say your kidneys are not the culprit.    signs and symptoms of a UTI (urinary tract infection) can include:  -A strong, persistent urge to urinate  -A burning sensation when urinating  -Passing frequent, small amounts of urine  -Blood in the urine (hematuria) or cloudy, strong-smelling urine    These sound like your symptoms? If you have these you need to contact your physician IMMEDIATELY! If your you're in generally in good health, antibiotics are what your physician will prescribe and this treatment will likely  get rid of your UTI. Also, drinking plenty of water will dilute your urine and help flush out bacteria.     Like any infection, if left untreated a UTI can become something more serious than merely a set of uncomfortable symptoms; including serious and permanent kidney damage and in (very) rare cases the infection can spread to vital organs and this can sometimes lead to death! If a hospital is not accessible to you, many free and low-cost clinics have the capacity to diagnose and prescribe the necessary medication to fight a UTI.    GET A DOCTOR, and good luck!    -Shamar|`|ICtwYntuaa	UTIs are generally a bacterial infection of the kidneys or bladder.  Depending on the type and particular location, UTIs vary in severity.    Having to urinate frequently with nothing coming out is one of the most frequent UTIs, an infection of the bladder.  Treatment is usually a simple course of common antibiotics and is usually extremely effective.  More often than not, the immune system will even fight it off on its own after a couple days.
UpPWXRK4aa	No more food fatty!|`|6sPcYQr0aa	One of the worst things you can do to your body is stop eating. Your body needs fuel just like your car needs fuel. And just like your car, the better the fuel and oil is, the better the cars performance, the better the food and liquid is that you put in your body with too make you "run" better.  If you are trying to lose fat. Try to raise your metabolism by eating smaller meals, more nutritious meals, and about five or six meals throughout the day.  If you do not want to eat five or six small meals a day. Eat three meals a day, smaller portions, then between breakfast and lunch have a healthy snack or meal replacement shake, and another between lunch and dinner.  The idea is to teach your body to get rid of all extra fuel it doesnt need, which are fats, carbs, and simple sugars for the most part. And once your body begins to understand that you are giving it the fuel it needs when it needs it, then your body will no longer store fat cells as a fuel reserve.

Never mind Superbowls, I've got super bowels.
deYDbVDSaa	Personally, I use Muscle Milk. It is a good option at a reasonable price.
30SnAm0kaa	gum makes you more hungry, you're tricking your body into thinking it's about to eat food so it begins to produce stomach acids. so gum is a no no.. you're actually better off snacking on nutritious food all day in small portions rather than chewing gum. eating actually keeps your metabolism going    there's more to it than sit ups and since you have such a limited time i hope these help even after you come home from vacation as well.    have a safe trip and good luck =)    step1  --Stomach exercises--To get the result of a flat stomach you have to exercise with a flat stomach. You need to train your muscles to assume this shape. To achieve flat abs  -tighten your stomach muscles while doing your ab workout.  -suck your stomach in as if you were tucking in your shirt and tighten your stomach muscles.  -Continue to keep your muscles tight through all your reps.  -When you finish your reps you should feel a lot more burn in your abs versus what you felt without tightening your abs.    Keep your muscles tight and pulled in when you perform an exercise to tone and shape your abdomen muscles. The key for the exercise is for them to remain in that shape instead of being strong but unshaped.  Step2  --Sculpted Abs-- To have sculpted abs your need to have a variety of abdominal exercises in your workout regime. Each area, including upper abs, lower abs, and muscles on your sides have different exercises to tone and strengthen. To reach your ultimate goal of having your stomach look tight, toned, and strong you should create a workout that includes exercises for them all.    Although sit-ups are the most widely used exercise for abs, abdominal workout routines that make your stomach flat and abs tighten will yield excellent results since these workouts will work the smaller and harder to tone muscles in your abdominal area. These are exercises for overall toned abs.  Step3  --Abdominal Exercises-- 1.) CROSSOVER CRUNCHES - Lie on your back with your knees bent and feet flat on the floor. Cross your right leg over your left leg so your right ankle is resting on your left knee. Place your fingertips to the side of your head just behind your ears. Begin a crunch, but twist your torso and touch your left elbow to your right knee. Return to the starting position and repeat for the desired number of repetitions before switching over to the other side.    2.) SIDE BENDS - Holding a dumbbell in you right hand, stand with feet shoulder width apart and your knees slightly bent. Place your left hand behind your head and slowly bend sideways to your right lowering the dumbbell down to your knee. Return to an upright position and repeat for the desired number of reps.    3.) MEDICINE BALL SIT UPS - Lie on your back with your knees bent and feet flat on the floor. Hold a medicine ball (choose a 5 pound ball to begin) to your chest and have a partner stand at your feet (not on them). Push your lower back into the floor flattening the arch and hold. As you curl up throw the ball to your partner. Hold the crunch as your partner catches the ball and throws it back to you. Catch the ball and slowly return to the start position. Tip: Don't sit right the way up as you wait for the return pass. Your shoulders should be no more than 6 inches off the floor.    4.) OBLIQUE CRUNCHES - Lie on your back with your knees bent and feet flat on the floor. Slowly drop your legs to the left and let your knees rest near the floor. Place your fingertips to the side of your head just behind your ears. Push your lower back into the floor flattening the arch and hold. Curl up slowly so both your shoulders lift off the floor a few inches. Hold for a count of 2 and return to the start position. repeat for the desired number of reps and switch to the other side.    5.) SEATED OBLIQUE TWISTS WITH MEDICINE BALL- Sit on the floor with your knees bent and feet flat on the floor. Hold a medicine with both hands directly out in front of you, twist to your right and place the ball on the ground behind you. Quickly, but smoothly, turn to your left to retrieve the ball and repeat for the desired number of reps. Repeat the process for the left side. Tip: if you have a training partner, sit back to back and pass the medicine to each other.  Step4  *Ab Exercise Guidelines:*    -Perform several (3-5) abdominal exercises 2-3 times a week with at least a days rest in between each workout.  -Start with 2 sets of 10-15 repetitions for each exercise. As you improve move to 3 set of 20 repetitions.  -You do not need to do all the exercises. Simply select 3-5 that work well for you and vary your routine over the months.|`|AA10426969	"how long will it take to lose belly fat in a month?"    A month...|`|0rF1be2baa	it doesnt matter what part of body you work out it doesnt burn fat in a set area, eg if you work out your arms its not necessarily arm fat tht you will lose. everyones body stores fat in different areas, so for one person fat first goes to their thighs and for another it would go to their stomach. the best exercise ive found is jogging or walking twice a week. Yes gum will stop food cravings but its easier just to set your self a certain number of snacks you can have per day and stick to it|`|cJ4EGdwWaa	It will take exactly 1 month to lose belly fat in a month.|`|cX3yqEtVaa	The gum could work.

What asimple way to gain muscle is to get a timer(count down) and set it for 10 minutes. Every 10 minutes do 5 pushups, 5 crunches, and 5 squats. Also drink a cup or two of milk every hour to get soem protein. youll gain muscle over time and it will stay longer.
OLl4HEAzaa	air squats, or barbel squats if you want to gain muscle. This excersise is used by profesdssional weight5lifters and is know as the king of all excersises. trust me these really work. go to bodybuilding.com to get reveiws and other stuff.

Goodluck on your journey!
vVTmJjJDaa	by doing the following, i lost 155 pounds in less than a year....and i've *kept* it off for over 5 years...the key is, you have to become your own "Food Warden"....      first of all, get a calendar (you can even print one off your computer) - set a *reasonable* goal weight, based on your  age, height, and body type - now, write down that weight, along with your current weight on "Day 1" of your calendar - that's the first date/day of your new way of eating...    here we go:        toss/give away ALL JUNK FOOD.  for example: if you are addicted to twinkies and have a stash, GET RID OF THEM and don't buy any more!  if family members keep junk food around, buy a big plastic toolbox with a LOCK - and tell them to keep those things LOCKED UP (a combo lock works best..and of course, dont let *yourself* know the combo!).  ask friends not to tempt you with food.    as for meals - simple: 1st off: NO DEEP FRIED FOODS. everything else is FINE! within reason, and here's the trick:  eat HALF of what you'd *normally* eat - if you are not sure how much "half" is, put everything on your plate like you'd normally do, then put HALF of it BACK!      switch to water or diet beverages (i love 4C Light Iced Tea.  it has 15 calories per 8oz - guests can't even tell it's diet!).    snacks: two fresh fruits per day - your choice. and then, one "sweet" per day (i'd save that for night time, when you're really feeling hungry!): a container of pudding, yogurt, or my favorite: a bowl of pre-sweetened *cereal* with skim or 1% milk works wonders to satisfy a sweet tooth. i usually have six boxes to choose from. then, each night, when i want a snack, if i want peanut butter, chocolate or whatever, i can still get that taste! but only ONE bowl - and not a HUGE one! (about a cup of cereal).    as for exercise, i've gotta be the laziest person on the planet. so i decided that WALKING was my best option. around the block once, then increase weekly to 2x, etc. during winter, no excuse - just walk around your house.  I DO!  or go to the mall and walk - take a look at all of the clothes you'll soon be fitting into.  and stay away from that food court!    weigh yourself each morning, NAKED (so you can't blame clothes for adding any weight!) and keep track of your results on your calendar.  you'll be amazed at how much you can lose in just ONE MONTH! - reward yourself after that first month - but not with FOOD!|`|07YBD5mJaa	Our stomachs don't register that they're full until ten minutes after we're done eating. so, i would eat slowly, and wait to see how your stomach feels after ten minutes. If your full, then you'll feel great that you didn't take seconds, but if you find that your still hungry, than snack on healthier food...like fruit or veggies.  try getting rid of sodium in your diet too, this helped greatly for me. no salt. it's works, and helps with your cholesterol too. eat larger meals in the morning, so that you aren't so hungry later in the evening.  I hope this helps a bit!  best of luck to you!|`|mjshqfuyaa	well at least for me i tend to eat when i am really really boerd so if that is the case just keep yourself busy :]   but i have tried some pills that worked really good for me.  Mega T Green tea supplements there all natural no gross chemicals or anything that really really reduced my hunger. you take two a day and the good this is they are supper dupper cheap they are like 3 dollars of 50 of them its a really good buy :] you can get them at places like Target (where i got mine) and walgreens i think. and just go on long walks. Walking acually burns as much calories as running the same distance so just take a relaxing walk :]    hope all goes well.|`|vGjxpHD9aa	Stop eating so much and get plenty of exercise !|`|SUs4rN49aa	The best way to do this is to plan your meals and get rid of any junk food in your house.   Have 3 meals a day, breakfast, lunch, supper, and 3 snacks a day in between those meals. Try to increase fiber intake because this fills your stomach and makes you feel full longer.   Drink lots of water in between meals... try for eight 8 ounce glasses of water a day. If you have a bad day, don't quit!|`|8SRjELNBaa	Throw away all the butter in your refrigerator. Every time you eat a snack ask yourself; "am I really hungry?" If you say yes, then eat egg whites or oatmeal and lots, i mean lots of water.    If you have any family/friends who have ran marathons, ask them what they'd recommend.    Get active! Start by signing up for aerobics or cycling classes at your local gym/YMCA because a supportive community is very important.|`|IFs6MWDJaa	most people eat when they are bored, find something else to take up any free time to stop you from eating    or eat what ever you want  and just exercise a lot and burn it off|`|K8vrjRRDaa	south beach|`|sTfd5qBCaa	before you can learn to control your eating you need to learn self control. and how to manage it.|`|XXlAs7QCaa	just dont eat that much|`|KijglE0Qaa	don't snack keep your self busy so you don't let your mind wander off about food, only eat three full meals a day and have room for about 2-3 healthy snacks such as yogurt, fruit etc. work out for atleast 30 minutes a day and it doesn't have to be all at once    get smaller dishware and smaller the amount of meals    and you'll be all set to fit into that dress!|`|LVcGEkIQaa	what i do is try to only eat when im hungry.  if that doesnt work, then try to keep yourself busy.  if you do something [friends house, watch a movie, read, etc.] you wont think about food.|`|oqYRab7Paa	Cut back on portions and foods with trans fats.

Don't post these pictures!  You're not fat; just unhappy.  I've been there so many times in my life, but let me tell you; as you get older you'll get taller and you'll naturally thin out. It happened to me, and although I'm still unhappy about the way I look I think you need to stay strong and try, really TRY, to accept yourself. It's been one of the hardest things in the world for me and my self-consciousness has made a huge negative impact on my life. I don't want you to go through what I've been through.  I'm not telling you to accept 'being fat'; I'm telling you to accept yourself and make sure that if you want to get in shape, if you want to lose a little weight, make absolutely SURE that it is for YOU and no one else. You need to make sure whatever you do to improve yourself isn't harmful to your body--don't conform to society's conception of beauty; society is corrupt--just stay motivated and get to where YOU want to be.|`|DvFtOGWbaa	Ur a little fat but not soo much your probably avg.|`|OLl4HEAzaa	a little but fat is an overstatement

Good luck  Beth|`|ph4Htg02aa	Get over yourself, maybe?
OzNE3es1aa	Yeah, I am sorry to say it, but you are a little overweight. It isn't that bad though. It could just be all muscle that because you work out so much. Only you would know whether all of that pounds come from muscle or fat.
GA5BAhaRaa	Those are GOOD fats.  Unsaturated fats are good for you; poly and mono unsaturated fats are just two kinds of those good fats.     Nothing is worse than Trans fat! Nothing! Don't buy ANYTHING with that **** in there! Saturated fat is also very bad for you but it is okay in moderation especially since it is in things such as meat and a little bit in nuts, etc.     And DON'T buy anything with the words: hydrogenated or partially hydrogenated in it.  *Look at the ingredients list, not just the nutritional facts.
OLl4HEAzaa	about 140 135 somewhere around there.|`|6KaMW1Vzaa	70 kg (154 lbs)|`|sJqFcCRPaa	maybe you should worry about not being a freaking midget and not so much about your weight    stupid little people complex|`|n2gZikuPaa	That depends on a number of things. The size of your frame and the percentages of body muscle and fat that you carry. Thus, someone with a small frame and little muscle mass may weigh only around 140 pounds after they've lost the appropriate amount of body fat. On the other hand, you may have a medium or large frame, exercise, have some extra muscle, and weigh a lean 180 to 220 (or more) pounds. The only way to know what is best for you is to determine the percentage of body fat you currently carry. That way, you'll know exactly how much body fat you need to lose (or even gain). If you need to lose weight make sure you take in plenty of protein and preferably work out with weights. Otherwise, you will lose muscle as well as fat. And muscle is something you want to keep or even build. Why? Because it burns many more calories than fat, it gives you the strength to do everyday tasks well, muscle weight does not harm but aids your health, and it gives you better body shape (i.e., clothes fit better and you look better). Therefore, don't worry about the weight question at all. Worry only about the percentage of body fat you carry. And whether or not you should build more muscle.|`|SjBhtLBjaa	Since you are still growing, this is a hypothetical question.    But for a 15 year old mostly sedentary male, 145 lbs seems to be the most common weight for this age group at 5 ft 8. For an athletic person, this might be buffed up to 155 to 160 lbs or so.
x2jYEEkiaa	Your UTI could have spread to your kidney, and the pain you feel could be from a kidney infection. Do you know if you have a fever? Another possibility is that you have a kidney stone, in which case you just have to wait for it to pass. Either way, you should probably see a doctor because there can be some pretty serious complications if you don't take care of it. If it is a spread of your infection, they can give you stronger antibiotics to make sure that it doesn't get any worse, and if it is a kidney stone they can give you something that will hopefully make the pain a little better.|`|4aa5ec2b493db915bb99fb24d191aa9baa	Thats how a really bad case od UTI feels, and the meds make your urine even redder or orange, if it's still getting worse after 2 more days, go back and get different meds.

hHbK4p20aa	Hmmmmmmm, maybe kidney stones? Probably not appendicitis...  But you should check with your doctor|`|f0e6bb08f78bda5965b94f88de6064f6aa	Appendicitis cannot be diagnosed in this forum.  Abdominal pain such as you describe needs to be checked by a doctor, PA or Nurse Practitioner.  Generally appendicitis first presents itself as rebound pain, meaning it is more uncomfortable when the examiner lightly palpates your belly and it's after they let up, the pain is worse than when they were touching you.  It can also start around the belly button and move down into the lower right quadrant as you start to feel worse.            Please don't take the responses here as a substitute for a real exam.  Go get yourself looked at.  Sorry your not feeling well.|`|VBMOuIuxaa	typically, appendicitis is a condition of people in their 20's. if you are not in that range it does not mean you do not have it, but should be more wary of how you feel if you are. if it is appendicitis you are in stage one, when the pain is diffuse, but when it progresses to stage 2 it will be pinpointed to that lower right quadrant and will be even more intense on the pain scale. you need to verify that you do indeed have a fever with a thermometer. have you been nauseous or have you vomited (yes??? then could likely be appendicitis) going on, if you have appendicitis and it gets to stage 2, you will not want to walk, cough or move because of pain, the fetal position will relieve the pain usually. if this is the case, seek medical attention. please do NOT hesitate. from onset to appendicitis rupture takes about 24 -48 hrs. tops. so good luck|`|OBuzcIDbaa	A cold has nothing to do with it, but if it's appendicitis, you will not only hurt on your right side, but will feel sick to your stomach.

5KizS02jaa	Oh, how tall are you? Don't fret too much. You are still growing, but here's some tips to stay fit.    My suggestions would be to:  - lower your amount of calories (if it's above your age limit) or count your calories (i became a little obsessive about this so make sure you don't freak out like I did!)  - avoid too much SSS (sugar, starches, salts)  - snack on healthier foods (celery, broccoli, fruits, small portion of lean meat like chicken breast)  - exercise is key, try just walking/running/swimming at least 20 minutes a day. walk your dog if you have one.  - avoid drinking soda, juices; WATER IS ALWAYS BEST.  - try not to eat after 7:30, it gives your body time to digest.  - get decent sleeep! (:  - keep a positive attitude, I know it's tough, but you will love the results.    E-mail me if you have any more questions.    Good luck!|`|NzWY5ECgaa	You're still growing. Depriving yourself of calories when you're just starting puberty is an awful idea. You do not need to lose 50 lbs. You need to readjust your attitude.|`|6sPcYQr0aa	One of the worst things you can do to your body is stop eating. Your body needs fuel just like your car needs fuel. And just like your car, the better the fuel and oil is, the better the cars performance, the better the food and liquid is that you put in your body with too make you "run" better.  If you are trying to lose fat. Try to raise your metabolism by eating smaller meals, more nutritious meals, and about five or six meals throughout the day.  If you do not want to eat five or six small meals a day. Eat three meals a day, smaller portions, then between breakfast and lunch have a healthy snack or meal replacement shake, and another between lunch and dinner.  The idea is to teach your body to get rid of all extra fuel it doesnt need, which are fats, carbs, and simple sugars for the most part. And once your body begins to understand that you are giving it the fuel it needs when it needs it, then your body will no longer store fat cells as a fuel reserve.  To expedite the process it always helps to concentrate on full body workouts to keep energy storage empty.  This will take time. But once you are able to achieve routine with your eating habits it is one of the easiest ways to keep the fat off.  Good luck and God bless.|`|AA11739944	diet & exercise.

While you are chewing your food, put your fork down on the table until you have swallowed the food you have in your mouth. Between meals, if you get hungry, eat some fruit, vegetables, and/or some dry cereal like Cheerios or Special K.  For breakfast, eat a bowl of Cheerios or Special K with Skim Milk.

LPO8RlVdaa	Forget about losing weight. Just adopt a healthy lifestyle.Eat a good healthy diet and excercise a lot!!! The more excercise you do the better!    For a healthy diet, you need to be eating small to medium meals regularly. 4 or even 5 times a day. Each meal (apart from breakfast which should preferably be fibre rich), should contain a balanced ammount of carbohydrates for energy, (from potatoes, rice and pasta, etc) protien (from fish, chicken, occassional red meat is fine, soya is good too) and plenty of vitamins, minerals and antioxidants (simple fresh fruit and veg). Eat like this and make sure you are well hydrated (fruit juice is as good as water, any fluid counts, but some fluids have negative effects too, such as alcohol or caffiene rich drinks.)    You can have a wide range of healthy meals with this, from Thai, Chinese, Italian, British, Indian, etc. Just make sure each meal contains balanced ammounts of these three. On the bright side too, fresh veg and rice and pasta is a lot cheaper than crappy junk food!    This doesn't mean you cant have chocolate or pizza/takeaway/etc, just save them as very occassional treats.    The big secret to keeping a healthy weight and staying healthy is EXCERCISE, particularly cardio excercise.     Cardio exercise includes any form of excercise such as running/jogging/swimming/cycling etc that gets your heart rate pumping and you sweating and out of breath. It will not only burn calories and reduce your body fat levels, therefore making you 'slimmer' by having less fat on you, but will also improve your resting heart rate and lung function, making you healthier.     I cannot understate the importance of cardio excercise. It is this which will basically burn the body fat off you.     But you have to remember that once you have shed a bit of fat you have to have a nice toned body underneath the fat to show off.     Strength training will help you strengthen and tone your muscles. This is done with the use of weights or by free training.    There are essentially (without getting overly complicated) two types of strength excercises based on different types of muscle fibres depending on wether you want to build size, bulk and power, or just 'tone' up the lean muscles an get more muscle endurance.    Heavy weights with short reps/sets will build your fast twitch muscle fibres and build size, power and strength. Imagine big guys at the gym lifting heavy weights.     But if you use light to medium weights with lots of reps/sets you will excercise your slow twitch muscle fibres, you wont build size, but you will tone up your body and train muscle endurance. This will obviously make you 'look' healthier and more toned, but will also increase your metabolism (as your muscles demand more energy) so you will burn calories faster. These muscles are also excercised a lot with cardio workouts (i.e your leg muscles when running).    Your arms for example, will need bicep curls and tricep dips using weights and reps of your choice (heavy - low reps, light - lots of reps) and also shoulder excercises such as holding the weights at your waist and lifting them perpendicular to your side or in front of you, etc etc.    Your stomach will need excercises that cover the entire torso. Leg raises for your lower ab wall, crunches, sit ups and planks for your upper and all over ab wall, oblique twists for your sides and superman stretches for your lower back for example.    These are just basic examples, there are literally hundreds of excercises, but it is impossible to show you on a site like this, get a trainer at your gym to show you some but remember the basic rules of muscles and weights.     As far as excercise goes, you should aim to strike a balance between cardio training and strength training, this way you will build good strong and toned muscle, but also keep your body fat levels down and increase your heart and lung performance, making you much fitter and healthier.    Hope this helps.|`|GA5BAhaRaa	Oh wow. No. I think you're absolutely fine for you're height.  I'm 2 inches shorter and the same weight!  I weighed 122 at one point last year; I looked sickly and unhealthy; I can't image what it would look like on you.

USoqyjaAaa	Well, ideally, a full exam should be done.  That is because some STD's can affect the throat (gonorrhea), lymph nodes around the body (gonorrhea, HIV), skin (syphilis), abdomen (chlamydia), etc.   The actual testing in our clinic also includes a pelvic examination (with the speculum) where swabs are taken from the cervix and sent for chlamydia and gonorrhea testing.  A swab of any vaginal discharge is also taken and looked at under the microscope for trichomonas.  Then a blood test is done for syphilis and HIV.  If warranted, a blood test can also be done for herpes or hepatitis B, but these are only done if there are symptoms or evidence of infection by these viruses. If there is any possibility of gonorrhea infection of the throat or rectum these areas are cultured.  The results of the microscope exam are available immediately, of course.  We usually get the other results back in 2-5 days.|`|eCKNRcIVaa	It depends on what you are being tested for.  Diseases like syphilis can be tested by a blood test, as can many strains of HPV however diseases like chlamydia and gonorrhea need to be tested by swapping the cervix during a pelvic exam|`|4yGGjs7zaa	well they get a larger version of a cotton bud and gently swap inside her bits and send them off for testing! a smear test is a little different, they gently scrap the wall of the vagina and put it onto a clear glass slide and send that off also to get tested! results are usually recieved 7-14 days after! blood tests can be done but this was is more acurrate!

wzM5WB8Xaa	Good for you on cutting back to the 2000 calorie a day diet. You don't want to scale back too much, because your metabolism might end up slowing down too much. I can't remember the exact number, but it's something like 3500 calories=1lb. So, basically, by cutting back 1000 calories per day from your regular diet, you should lose about 2lbs per week. If you are currently lifting weights, try adding 15-20 minutes of cardio to your daily routine. The cardio will help get you into the fat burning zone for your strength training, which will assist in shedding the pounds more quickly. Good luck!|`|hvFN0JLVaa	weights is good.  but what that could actually do is build muscle under your fat.  and even tho your losing fat, it makes you look fatter.  the best thing you could do with your calorie cutback is cadie.  like stairs, running.  anytihng that makes you sweat.|`|9AT3RPyVaa	why do people always ask this stupid question about losing weight?  i'm sorry, but its not that hard to figure out. you were smart enough to go on a diet and to start lifting, but you need to exercise daily as well. try cardie.  jog around the block a couple times. do u have a treadmill? run on that for about an hour everyday. if not just use watever you have that always keeps you moving. never sit down for more than an hour unless your eating. yes that means no more than an hour of TV or video games.   i read a magazine that if your watching TV and a commercial comes up, do 15-20 sit ups and push-ups. within an hour you should have done over 100 sit-ups and push-ups!!!! its genius.  good luck.|`|BFLLJc7eaa	well if you want to lose the man ****.. you have to do pull ups and sit ups not weightlifting. well working out wont help you lose weightt. dont drink soda or energy drinks and you should run or jog|`|6sPcYQr0aa	It doesnt really matter what you eat and when you eat it, as long as it has the nutrients your body needs and you give it to your body when it needs it. I will explain.  One of the worst things you can do to your body is stop eating. Your body needs fuel just like your car needs fuel. And just like your car, the better the fuel and oil is, the better the cars performance, the better the food and liquid is that you put in your body with too make you "run" better.  If you are trying to lose fat. Try to raise your metabolism by eating smaller meals, more nutritious meals, and about five or six meals throughout the day.  If you do not want to eat five or six small meals a day. Eat three meals a day, smaller portions, then between breakfast and lunch have a healthy snack or meal replacement shake, and another between lunch and dinner.  The idea is to teach your body to get rid of all extra fuel it doesnt need, which are fats, carbs, and simple sugars for the most part. And once your body begins to understand that you are giving it the fuel it needs when it needs it, then your body will no longer store fat cells as a fuel reserve.  It is also a good idea to use a body cleanser, or detoxify before beginning any change in diet. Especially if you are going to begin eating healthier. The process might cause head aches or muscle cramps depending on what your body has become used to. Also diarrhea is a common side effect of most cleansing programs, but dont worry this is a sign that your body is getting rid of the toxic substances. The cleans will help your body to easily extract the nutrients it needs from the food you intake and bypass the rest as waste.  To expedite the process it always helps to concentrate on full body workouts to keep energy storage empty. Also, drink water, water is used to clean your body inside and out. Stay away from caffeine and soda.  This will take time. But once you are able to achieve routine with your eating habits it is one of the easiest ways to keep the fat off.  So with this, your diet can be very flexible as well. You can have sweets and things but for best results I would stay away from all simple sugars, like candy.  Good luck and God bless.|`|UaLlyLAaaa	Try walking too, because when you lift weights all your calories are going into your muscles which will get bigger than fat. Just don't eat any junk food and no sodas. Stay on healthy food and water or Gatorade.|`|G17CSiL6aa	It all depends on what is in your 2000 calories diet. For example, if you're eating salads, fruits, and vegetables, then you'll get to 180 lb. quicker than if you were to just eat less of what you did before going on your diet.  Cardiovascular exercise is more effective than lifting weights. Lifting weights mostly gains muscle but it doesn't attack the fat as much as cardio work, so your weights won't really help you there.|`|lwG6tvOqaa	Well i am happy to hear that you are not starving yourself to get thin, and that you are doing it the right way by exercising and eating healthier. If you keep this act up, then you might be at your weight goal by summer. You will probably even lose more weight than you thought you would.|`|qtgMy1zUaa	Don't be worried about lifting weights too much, the more muscle you put on, the more calories you will burn naturally.  And the 2000 calories you eat will have to be healthy; 2000 calories of crap will be a lot worse for you than vegetables, protein, etc.|`|zBaUWUXfaa	Try aerobics- these will make you shed the lbs. faster. Maybe situps or running will do you some good. Eat LOTS of fruits and veggies. And drink cold water- The cold water makes you lose a little bit a weight due to the negative calorie effect (same as celery) but every little bit helps. If you follow this diet you should be at 180 probably around May.|`|zjMpCPbiaa	http://sparkpeople.com/    You should go to the above link.

tVsflgjlaa	Well, you need to exercise at least 30 minutes a day. I enjoy walking for an hour or so. But you could also go to the gym and lift weights twice a week. But don't forget, you have to eat right, just exercising doesn't help you lose a lot of weight if you eat a lot of junk food.|`|BFLLJc7eaa	well im on the wrestling team and i lost 5 pounds in 1 day =| but its hard!!!! i work out inside the weight room with the heat on and 2 sweatshirts, 2 shirts, shorts and sweat pants. and a beanie hat. all u have to do is jump rope, work or run nonstop. but of course to do this you must have done this for a while. u can try the jump rope, but it has the be a nonstop rhythm. try running or jogging. dont drink soda or energy drinks no candy or high salted foods.
i35MDAzQaa	your over doing it.  you should only workout 3 times a day so your muscle could repair themselves.  and you shouldn't only drink water, you need milk, and juice to keep your body healthy and metabolism up so you could lose weight more easily.   and for the diet just stay away from candy and greasy foods, starving yourself will lower your metabolism and you'll gain the weight back when you stop doing the diet.

VaKhLMqxaa	I struggled with Bulimia for 4 years.  It sounds to me like she has a problem.  If she's gaining weight,  it's probably not Anorexia.  But, that doesn't mean that it's not as serious.  Both are serious SERIOUS diseases.  Even if you have the slightest suspicion,  it's worth mentioning to someone.  I would suggest to her,  talking to someone about it regularly.  It helps a lot.  That's what I did and I haven't relapsed  in almost a year.  If she's taking time to go "off" of the diet,  then maybe she's not THAT bad,  but, it could develop into something worse.  Just tell her how good she looks,  even if she doesn't.  Compliments can really make people take a step  back and look at themselves, and realize that they're beautiful the way they are.

It doesnt really matter what you eat and when you eat it, as long as it has the nutrients your body needs and you give it to your body when it needs it. I will explain.  One of the worst things you can do to your body is stop eating. Your body needs fuel just like your car needs fuel. And just like your car, the better the fuel and oil is, the better the cars performance, the better the food and liquid is that you put in your body with too make you "run" better.  If you are trying to lose fat. Try to raise your metabolism by eating smaller meals, more nutritious meals, and about five or six meals throughout the day.  If you do not want to eat five or six small meals a day. Eat three meals a day, smaller portions, then between breakfast and lunch have a healthy snack or meal replacement shake, and another between lunch and dinner.  The idea is to teach your body to get rid of all extra fuel it doesnt need, which are fats, carbs, and simple sugars for the most part. And once your body begins to understand that you are giving it the fuel it needs when it needs it, then your body will no longer store fat cells as a fuel reserve.  It is also a good idea to use a body cleanser, or detoxify before beginning any change in diet. Especially if you are going to begin eating healthier. The process might cause head aches or muscle cramps depending on what your body has become used to. Also diarrhea is a common side effect of most cleansing programs, but dont worry this is a sign that your body is getting rid of the toxic substances. The cleans will help your body to easily extract the nutrients it needs from the food you intake and bypass the rest as waste.  To expedite the process it always helps to concentrate on full body workouts to keep energy storage empty. Also, drink water, water is used to clean your body inside and out. Stay away from caffeine and soda.  This will take time. But once you are able to achieve routine with your eating habits it is one of the easiest ways to keep the fat off.  So with this, your diet can be very flexible as well. You can have sweets and things but for best results I would stay away from all simple sugars, like candy.  Good luck and God bless.|`|nt6ouk57aa	that sounds like a real problem.    bulimia is when you binge and purge (you eat a lot, then you gag yourself to make you throw up).  anorexia is when you just don't eat period.  anorexia and bulimia are both equally the same on the risk meter.    but that girl sounds like she has some issues.    hope i helped

Sounds like your body is storing fat with that amount.  Try to increase your caloric intake to 1200-1400 and get plenty of exercise.  See what that does.|`|DnU64Aobaa	increase your caloric intake like everyone else suggested...    it also sounds like you've plateaued with the dieting. if you are serious about losing weight... diet alone will not do the trick. skip the weight lifting for now and get into cardio. if you notice your weight loss slows after a while you need to increase your intensity.    also remember that muscle weighs more than fat. you can be in shape and a perfect size and still weigh more than your "ideal weight"    Be careful and good luck.

XByFpkrwaa	Unfortunately you can't target a specific area when trying to lose fat.  You will have to do cardio to lose the actual fat.  To tone the muscle that remains underneath the fat the best core exercise is to do planks.  Do the regular plank as wel as planks for both sides of your body.  Also sit ups, side crunches,  as well as reverse sit ups are helpful for toning up the love handles.      Good luck!|`|6dSxAExUaa	the plank excercise works well:  you get a stepping stool or something that is low to the ground but is sturdy... Those wii fit boards are great.... ok but you get a stool and put your arms on it and basically make a pushup position keep it until you can anymore. It's great|`|nQkH90n6aa	Pilates are amazing. They strengthen and tone without building up huge amounts of muscles and they are SO easy to do. You go to bed not feeling tired but wake up sore so you know they work. Hardly like exercise at all!
GA5BAhaRaa	You could probably get a chocolate ice cream with very little fat in comparison to regular chocolate but I'd say go with just the chocolate (dark only) because it has antioxidants.|`|AA11739944	read the label|`|oCXVQWcgaa	I think that maybe chocolate is less fastening because ice cream has more ingredients (milk, sugar....).

Good luck and God bless.|`|pkvKK6qVaa	short and simple answer:    yes.    a good rubric to go by is this - - - the amount of calories you consume has to be less than the calories you burn and you will lose weight.    so if you eat 2000 calories in a day, and in your every-day tasks without working out you manage to burn 1500 calories, thats 500 calories that your body is going to store (this is all of course EXTREMELY over-simplified)    so yeah, someone could eat 3 huge meals a day at mcdonalds and maintain a 6-pack... but they'd need to do a large amount of working out to keep the fat from building up.
nbAodlgQaa	No, a 17 year old girl needs 2200 calories a day. It sounds like you're eating only around 500 calories at most. Your body is going to start eating itself--muscle first, not fat, if you're trying to lose weight. You sound like you have an eating disorder, called restrictive eating disorder. I used to eat cereal and milk, an apple and some rice for dinner in a day, nothing else. I'm 17 too by the way, so I think I know what you're doing to yourself. I became really emaciated, lost my period and was underweight, so you seriously start eating more. You look really skinny already. Being healthy is so much more fun though! I am finally happy and over obsessing about food, watching what I eat everyday...that sucked. Good thing I got out of it---you can too...!|`|wyUPoHafaa	I would agree with what others are saying about getting more protien in your diet. If you don't like meat, no worries! You can get protien from many other things too. Also if you like fruit then I would eat more! I eat fruit like crazy for snacks and such so I don't feel hungry but I don't gain weight either. I would also maybe subsitute one of your bowls of cereal for something else too. Cereal (not matter what commercials say) doesn't offer to much for a person.   Here's a fave website of mine that offers great nutrition tips and a few yummy, healthy recipes too...  http://i-dietandfitness.com    Hope that helps and good luck! :)|`|OySU2oAkaa	I'm going to give you a direct link to a great article I read about nutritional servings. Protein is a big emphasis in it.    I definitely think you're missing a decent serving of protein in your everyday meal but it's good to have grains, fruit, and greens! :)    http://i-dietandfitness.com/2009/01/19/t...|`|BFLLJc7eaa	thats a good diet but dont forget you need protein. eat occasional meat but not a lot or beans. dont forget to exercise.|`|xs9L4eGpaa	im 17 and from uk 2 ^^ lol jk    yeaaa  it sounds healthy but not much there for a day get a lil more protein|`|Phjj2Gr3aa	That's all you eat all day?  I think you need a little bit more; add some meat or eggs or something in there to get the protein you need.  Also, I would get some more variety.  It may be healthy for a week, but not a whole year or even month.|`|i35MDAzQaa	you have to eat things with protein in it so you could keep your metabolism up.  example: meat, eggs, fish, cheese, bread|`|6sPcYQr0aa	It doesnt really matter what you eat and when you eat it, as long as it has the nutrients your body needs and you give it to your body when it needs it.

X0JWMfGnaa	It helps...."motivate" them?!  I'll admit i've been there, what girl doesn't look at a skinny girls body and envy it? I do|`|nbAodlgQaa	I was just like that...before I developed anorexia. You or your friend (I'm not sure who it is that's doing this) should seriously stop what you're doing--the mental, physical and emotional effects will be so bad in the end you'll have wished you never started this. Get help if you think it's too difficult to quit, or tell your friend. Those skinny girls aren't happy--happiness comes from within, not from what you look on the outside--trust me, I figured that out after I had done the damage. When I got skinny, I thought I'd be happy too..but nothing had changed. In fact things got worse...my friends were weirded out by me, and I was losing my hair and I was always cold. So, before you go ahead and do the damage, consider what I'm saying. There are healthy ways to lose weight--you'll look better and feel happier if you do them this way. And from what you look like in your picture on livejournal..you're already pretty thin.|`|qtgMy1zUaa	Personally, I think it's really creepy to stare at pictures of girls body's.

ItJzrvQ4aa	jogging is an excellent exercise because it let you lose weight  evenly throughout your whole body. If you want to lose weight in  specific areas, you should target them with exercises. If they are  your problem areas, they will be very difficult to tone. You will have  to work double on them. The best approach is this:  1. Lower/control your daily calorie intake (control for normal  weight, lower for overweight).  2. Run/jog to lower your overall body fat percentage.  3. Target your problem areas with exercises.   Side Lunge Slide  Stand with feet hip-width apart, left foot resting on a paper plate.  Bend the right leg while sliding the left foot to the side, torso  upright and abs in. Slowly slide left foot back to starting position,  repeating 8-12 times. Switch legs and repeat for 2-3 sets.    Lunge Slide  Stand with feet hip-width apart, left foot resting on a paper plate.  Bend the right leg while sliding the left foot back into a lunge  position, keeping the right knee behind the toe, torso upright and abs  in. Slowly slide left foot back to starting position and repeat 8-12  times. Switch legs and repeat on each leg for 2-3 sets.    Front One-Legged Squat  Stand on a step or small platform. Lift left leg out in front of step  and bend the right leg, bringing the toe of the left foot to the  floor. Touch the floor lightly and keep the knee of the bent leg in  line with toes. Straighten the right leg and repeat 8-12 times. Switch  legs and repeat for 2-3 sets.    Chair Squat  Stand in front of a chair with feet hip-width apart, abs in and torso  straight. Slowly bend your knees and lower and until you're almost  touching your butt to the chair. Hold for 2-3 seconds, knees behind  the toes, and straighten. Repeat for 12-16 reps, 2-3 sets.    Heel Drops with Leg Extension  Stand on step or platform with left leg on the step, right leg  hanging off the side. Bend the left leg and lower the right foot  towards the floor (a few inches). Straighten the left leg and bring  the right leg out to the side, foot flexed, in a leg extension. Repeat  8-12 times, switch legs for 2-3 sets.    Hip Extension  On a flat or inclined step or platform, lie facedown with hips on the  edge of the step, legs straight out behind you with toes resting  lightly on the floor. Squeeze the glutes and hamstrings and straighten  the legs until they are level with the hips. Hold for 2-3 seconds, and  lower letting toes lightly touch the floor. Repeat for 2-3 sets of  8-12 repetitions.|`|aLHmCRo0aa	You can't lose weight in just your thighs, you can incorporate exercises into your workout that will specifically target your thighs and help to tone them. Try simple exercises like lunges (both forward and side lunges), squats, and leg lifts.  Gyms and sports clubs have resistance machines that can help you tone up specific areas, like your upper and inner thighs.|`|FaXr20alaa	running. the more you sweat the more you loose. if you wear sweats its good.
uttbqGB9aa	You will have to reduce calories and start a diet like as if you wanted to lose weight all over.    The body does not pick a place to lose weight from, you lose weight according to where fat deposits are heavily situated.    If you are not fat all around, your body will consume wherever the fat is residing.    Remember, excersise tones and strengthens more then it does provide fat loss. Diet is a big factor when trying to lose weight.    Cut down your calorie intake and jog a little or brisk walk daily.    Just doing sit ups is not going to cut it.     Remember, if you gain muscle or strengthen muscle..it gets bigger...BUT..it will lay underneath fat since thats where muscle is located, under the fat.     You will have a tight stomache but it will look more like a hard pot belly.    Also..get check ups with the doctor, sometimes bloating bellies are a cause for concern.      Good luck :)|`|AA11739944	tighten your belly muscles

ItJzrvQ4aa	When  you are losing  weight,  you should exercise and diet  together.  If  you exercise without dieting, you will get bigger appetite,  which  will  lead  to  increase  of  weight, or muscle grow  underneath  the  fat  layer, and make you bulkier. If you diet without  exercising,  you  will  become  flabby  and will have excess skin. For  diet,  go  wheat  free.  No pasta, pizza, bread and so on. And no food  after  7  p.m. People achieve marvellous results with it. Depending on  your  initial  weight, you can drop upwards from 20 pounds a month. If  you  don't  eat  wheat then you don't eat all those sticky, fatty goey  cakes,  you  don't eat junk food, and you don't eat biscuits. But your  diet  is  still  balanced.  It  costs  nothing, and you do not have to  calculate  points  or  to  buy special meals or plans. For exercising,  start with walking, and then switch to running/jogging. Running is the  most efficient and calorie-burn exercise ever. If you are overweight a  lot,  walk  first  or you may have health complications (heart attack,  disjointed  bones and so on). Weight lifting is a good means to target  your problem areas for men and women. It's not necessarily to become a  bodybuilder or even join a gym - a couple of dumbbells will help you  to target your problem areas (stomach, butt, legs, arms, chest).|`|GAxHzgEEaa	you might not like it but its something called the master cleanse that my cousins tried out and got good results.  oh beyonce also did it.    well first you need to know that this is for 10 days  and the onlu thing you can have for breakfast is green tea  and the only thing you can have for lunch and dinner is a sourt of lemon drink that you make  ok this is the part thats nasty  these are the ingrediants for the lemon drink:      Main Ingredients for the Master Cleanse Recipe  Pure Filtered Water  Grade B Organic Maple Syrup, Formaldehyde free  Organic Cayenne Pepper  Organic Lemons  Sea salt - Unrefined, (Not iodized) or Epsom Salt   Optional Ingredients:  Laxative tea  Natural Herbal Tea (decaffeinated)     do not substitute ingrediants  thats the only thing you can have for 10 days  dont cheat|`|YOGgHoNdaa	First of all your question is an absolute oxymoron!  There ISN'T a good/fast way to loose weight.    But there is a way to loose way once and for all!  It takes a lot of determination and "stick-to-it-ness"    The most healthy way to loose weight effectively is by using the Weight Watchers program.  You can have everything you want - put in limited amounts, and in certain combinations - and certainly not all at once.  If you follow that program I guarantee weight loss.    Along with weight loss exercise if just as important.  Everyone day is fine by either aerobic excercises - brisk walking etc.    It doesn't come off in huge amounts and it's not a quick process.    You must likely didn't put the weight one all at once either - although it does seem easier to put in on that it does to take it off.    Weight Watchers shouldn't be just a diet to loose weight - It should also be a continued eating habit for life.  No sense working so hard to get it off, only to go back to old habits and put it baack on again!|`|F8EnH6JQaa	fruits and veggies    I have lost 25.5 pounds in 2 months, drink lots of water.

jdVxsK4yaa	i guess but u would hav 2 try xtra hard at it
LPO8RlVdaa	Okay, increasing your metabolic rate can happen healthily but you have to eat a good healthy diet (and lots of it!!!) and excercise like a *****!!!!    Your best bet is to forget about losing weight. Just adopt a healthy lifestyle.Eat a good healthy diet and excercise a lot!!! The more excercise you do the better!    For a healthy diet, you need to be eating small to medium meals regularly. 4 or even 5 times a day. Each meal (apart from breakfast which should preferably be fibre rich), should contain a balanced ammount of carbohydrates for energy, (from potatoes, rice and pasta, etc) protien (from fish, chicken, occassional red meat is fine, soya is good too) and plenty of vitamins, minerals and antioxidants (simple fresh fruit and veg). Eat like this and make sure you are well hydrated (fruit juice is as good as water, any fluid counts, but some fluids have negative effects too, such as alcohol or caffiene rich drinks.)    You can have a wide range of healthy meals with this, from Thai, Chinese, Italian, British, Indian, etc. Just make sure each meal contains balanced ammounts of these three. On the bright side too, fresh veg and rice and pasta is a lot cheaper than crappy junk food!    This doesn't mean you cant have chocolate or pizza/takeaway/etc, just save them as very occassional treats.    The big secret to keeping a healthy weight and staying healthy is EXCERCISE, particularly cardio excercise.     Cardio exercise includes any form of excercise such as running/jogging/swimming/cycling etc that gets your heart rate pumping and you sweating and out of breath. It will not only burn calories and reduce your body fat levels, therefore making you 'slimmer' by having less fat on you, but will also improve your resting heart rate and lung function, making you healthier.     I cannot understate the importance of cardio excercise. It is this which will basically burn the body fat off you.     But you have to remember that once you have shed a bit of fat you have to have a nice toned body underneath the fat to show off.     Strength training will help you strengthen and tone your muscles. This is done with the use of weights or by free training.    There are essentially (without getting overly complicated) two types of strength excercises based on different types of muscle fibres depending on wether you want to build size, bulk and power, or just 'tone' up the lean muscles an get more muscle endurance.    Heavy weights with short reps/sets will build your fast twitch muscle fibres and build size, power and strength. Imagine big guys at the gym lifting heavy weights.     But if you use light to medium weights with lots of reps/sets you will excercise your slow twitch muscle fibres, you wont build size, but you will tone up your body and train muscle endurance. This will obviously make you 'look' healthier and more toned, but will also increase your metabolism (as your muscles demand more energy) so you will burn calories faster. These muscles are also excercised a lot with cardio workouts (i.e your leg muscles when running).    Your arms for example, will need bicep curls and tricep dips using weights and reps of your choice (heavy - low reps, light - lots of reps) and also shoulder excercises such as holding the weights at your waist and lifting them perpendicular to your side or in front of you, etc etc.    Your stomach will need excercises that cover the entire torso. Leg raises for your lower ab wall, crunches, sit ups and planks for your upper and all over ab wall, oblique twists for your sides and superman stretches for your lower back for example.    These are just basic examples, there are literally hundreds of excercises, but it is impossible to show you on a site like this, get a trainer at your gym to show you some but remember the basic rules of muscles and weights.     As far as excercise goes, you should aim to strike a balance between cardio training and strength training, this way you will build good strong and toned muscle, but also keep your body fat levels down and increase your heart and lung performance, making you much fitter and healthier.    Hope this helps.|`|BVwDoV81aa	Hmmm...have you read your question ?    In one small paragraph you have the words...obsession, skinny, stop eating, gotten worse,starving, fat, crazy regime, constantly,smaller, stressed, lose weight, do harmful things, upset, angry......

Get a therapist.|`|8a44eaade905297fa713c25b7d4a40e9aa	For the last 2 years I have been struggling with an eating disorder.   I was in denial like you and tried to convince people that i was ok.  Losing weight doesn't make you feel better about yourself because you never feel thin, unless you get help you will always feel fat.   Until i found the reason for my disorder, i thought my weight was all i could control because everything that was going wrong was out of my control.   The only person who can make your life better and how you want it is you. Do you really want to damage the only thing that you can truly belongs to you?
4nSGT0Yvaa	When you poop, it'll be like turnin on a tap if you have to much all the time lol XD|`|QRG2L5Qjaa	Hard question. TOo much of a good thing = bad? I mean fiber is good but it helps digestion so if you get a lot, then  you poop diarehhea everyday.
OLl4HEAzaa	I cant tell you if you are overweight becuase you havent toldme how tall yuo are. But a good excerise to lose weight is swimming. It burns more calories than any other from of excersise.
C88VCkvnaa	You definitely did not eat enough. You barely ate anything all day! You got no where close to the nutrients you need. You also skipped a meal. :/ I suggest you begin eating more before your body goes into starvation mode and you start causing yourself some problems. :(|`|6sPcYQr0aa	It doesnt really matter what you eat and when you eat it, as long as it has the nutrients your body needs and you give it to your body when it needs it. I will explain.  One of the worst things you can do to your body is stop eating. Your body needs fuel just like your car needs fuel. And just like your car, the better the fuel and oil is, the better the cars performance, the better the food and liquid is that you put in your body with too make you "run" better.  If you are trying to lose fat. Try to raise your metabolism by eating smaller meals, more nutritious meals, and about five or six meals throughout the day.  If you do not want to eat five or six small meals a day. Eat three meals a day, smaller portions, then between breakfast and lunch have a healthy snack or meal replacement shake, and another between lunch and dinner.  The idea is to teach your body to get rid of all extra fuel it doesnt need, which are fats, carbs, and simple sugars for the most part. And once your body begins to understand that you are giving it the fuel it needs when it needs it, then your body will no longer store fat cells as a fuel reserve.  It is also a good idea to use a body cleanser, or detoxify before beginning any change in diet. Especially if you are going to begin eating healthier. The process might cause head aches or muscle cramps depending on what your body has become used to. Also diarrhea is a common side effect of most cleansing programs, but dont worry this is a sign that your body is getting rid of the toxic substances. The cleans will help your body to easily extract the nutrients it needs from the food you intake and bypass the rest as waste.  To expedite the process it always helps to concentrate on full body workouts to keep energy storage empty. Also, drink water, water is used to clean your body inside and out. Stay away from caffeine and soda.  This will take time. But once you are able to achieve routine with your eating habits it is one of the easiest ways to keep the fat off.  So with this, your diet can be very flexible as well. You can have sweets and things but for best results I would stay away from all simple sugars, like candy.  Good luck and God bless.|`|OSQOnrnHaa	u didnt eat anything at all|`|4BE2ZSdZaa	NO u arent eating enough, your only drinkin fluids you need some proein in your diet for your exercising eat some lean chicken and veg for lunch or something like that, but that really is not enough you should be eating at least 1500 calories and your only drinking 308, it will slow up your matabolism|`|HYV1qzktaa	u didnt eat anything...

Guys like hour glass figures better anyway. You should try eating a diet with lean meat like fish and chicken, lots of greens and veggies, some fruit and less carbs. Thats my 2 cents worth. Do what works for you. But please put your health first.
eCKNRcIVaa	I do.  It is a rare condition that usually affects very tall slender men, it often leads to sudden cardiac arrest ( is this enough info - I don't ant to give it away ).  Jon Larson the brilliant writer of the Broadway musical RENT died suddenly of it before he ever got to see his amazing musical open onn Broadway.    It can also cause skeletal issues and eye issues but the most serious are the cardiac issues ( it is a connective tissue disorder )|`|lwG6tvOqaa	I'm not sure what it is, but i can guarantee that google has some good answers that would help you out, and save a lot of time.|`|4aa5ec2b493db915bb99fb24d191aa9baa	Don't if it helps, but just a bit of interest, President Lincon, had it, add to report for interesting fact|`|0COGXFd9aa	Sorry, none of us that often answer Marfan questions made it before your deadline.  Just in case some of the others that wrote or someone else looks for an answer, I'd like to clarify a couple things.    MFS is a connective tissue disorder.  The stereotype tends to be tall and skinny, but is NOT limited to that and it is not more prevalent in any sex, color, region...  it is genetic, with 3/4 being directly inherited from a parent, 1/4 spontaneous (1st in family).      Primary areas affected with Marfan are skeletal (long limbs, flexible), eyes (dislocate lens, near-sighted), cardio (aorta weakened), and the dura.  If there is a chance someone has this, they need regular monitoring!  and by doctors who know MFS.    Best information can be found at marfan.org.  There are also some good discussion sites, such as yahoo Marfans support & chat.

Size doesnt necessarily mean strength though.When I was in high school and college and played sports I went up against guys that had larger muscles than me but I out muscled and out played them.

BFLLJc7eaa	well you have strep throat and the spots on the tonsils it just may be your pockets. yes your tonsil has pockets. and it also might be Tonsillitis. tonsillitis does cause swelling of the tonsils, spots and soar throat. lower back pain is just a pain maybe u might need a new bed =|. go to the docters...|`|eCKNRcIVaa	You could have strep throat or tonsillitis You need to go to a doctor for a throat culture.  Tell your parents heart damage can result from untreated strep throat, it is irresponsible of them not to take you to the doctor after several weeks of the same symptoms.  You likely had a viral infection then got a secondary bacterial infection and may need antibiotics to get better|`|BRT2teSqaa	I assumed the doctor checked for strep throat already, if not see a doctor.  If it is not strep, it just sounds like a virus that hasnt gone away.  To be honest, I had something similar for 10 months and it's what 2 doctors attributed it to.
ItJzrvQ4aa	you eat a lot of carbs. Try to substitute them with low fat protein and vegetables. When  you are losing  weight,  you should exercise and diet  together.  If  you exercise without dieting, you will get bigger appetite,  which  will  lead  to  increase  of  weight, or muscle grow  underneath  the  fat  layer, and make you bulkier. If you diet without  exercising,  you  will  become  flabby  and will have excess skin. For  diet,  go  wheat  free.  No pasta, pizza, bread and so on. And no food  after  7  p.m. People achieve marvellous results with it. Depending on  your  initial  weight, you can drop upwards from 20 pounds a month. If  you  don't  eat  wheat then you don't eat all those sticky, fatty goey  cakes,  you  don't eat junk food, and you don't eat biscuits. But your  diet  is  still  balanced.  It  costs  nothing, and you do not have to  calculate  points  or  to  buy special meals or plans. For exercising,  start with walking, and then switch to running/jogging. Running is the  most efficient and calorie-burn exercise ever. If you are overweight a  lot,  walk  first  or you may have health complications (heart attack,  disjointed  bones and so on). Weight lifting is a good means to target  your problem areas for men and women. It's not necessarily to become a  bodybuilder or even join a gym - a couple of dumbbells will help you  to target your problem areas (stomach, butt, legs, arms, chest).|`|OySU2oAkaa	Hello!    Tips I would recommend:    1. Eat more greens!    2. Stay hydrated!    3. Go to the doctor to make sure it's not anything health related. Sometimes weight gain is a symptom of something else.    4. Don't eat after 9.    5. Avoid alcohol as much as you can.    6. Do interval running sessions or aerobics at least twice a week.    7. Sometimes three square meals is too much. Cut down to two meals and fill the day with nutritious snacks to keep your metabolism going.    8. Get enough sleep.    9. Pay attention to portion. Don't eat in front of the television and try to cook a bit on your own. :)    10.

cASB8Sh3aa	Docs also look at what will work for you and how much insulin sensitivity you have.  There is not a ton of difference between the brands, they all cost a ton and do the same thing for you, act quickly in your body to keep your sugar in check.  The doc may also have had better experiences with this type over another with the patients he/she sees.  My doctor wanted me to switch from Humulin N to Lantus because she was more comfortable with that one for her patients.  We compromised and I went on a pump with Humalog instead as I was doing well on Humalog.  I am very sensitive to this type so I take a small amount every day.  She is more comfortable with me being able to have tight control with less dosage so she hasn't brought up switching me to Apidra.      Some people use one brand over another becuase they are sensitive to the feel of the insulin when it is injected.  Some people get a terrible burning sensation with some insulins and others are not so bad.  One of my oldest friends says Humalog feels like fire ants to him and he will never use it again it burns him so much.  It doesn't bother me at all, even at large doses.    Just ask your doctor why he/she chose it.  I am sure they will be cool with explaining it to you since you are taking an active role in your health care.  You have a right to know as a patient and it helps you understand where your doc is coming from too.  Builds trust and all....|`|PR6w9XzAaa	The duration and release of all insulins are a bit different. I take humalog a short acting insulin, but the time release and peak are different than apidra.

It sound like a problem which i once had, my psych doctor sorted it out :)  Vik|`|ParFJxnSaa	Yes; an anxiety disorder. Instead of anxiety, or worry, downgrade them to "concerns". See section 6, at ezy build, below. "Worry is like a rocking chair - it gives you something to do, but won't get you anywhere." -  Set yourself a specific time period for worrying about anything, (say; around three quarters of an hour, possibly when you get home, or after your evening meal, but not too close to bedtime) after which, resolve firmly to refuse to even entertain the thought of worrying again on that day: realise and accept that to do otherwise would be counterproductive to your mental health, and enjoyment of life. You will have had your "worry time" for the day, and can just write down any more thoughts that come to mind, and say to yourself: "Well, I'll just have to worry about that tomorrow, won't I?". Doctor Wayne Dwyer once said: "Negative emotions are preceded by negative thoughts". It is important to regularly monitor, and deal with a negative internal monologue (self talk), or mental process, such as disturbing thoughts, images, impulses, or emotions, by the process of (a): recognising it, and (b): challenging it immediately.     Technique For Re-Programming Negative Thoughts: When you notice something negative, such as: "I'm never going to get over this!" or: "Why am I always so pathetic/useless/such a loser?" or even: "I can't do this/will never get over this!", even an image, emotion, or a memory; recognise that this is being generated from the negative part of your mind. Having identified and labelled it, visualise a large, red, flashing, "STOP!" sign, and/or possibly a stern faced person wagging an index finger at you in a negative manner, then say to yourself as forcefully as you can, even aloud in a big voice, if alone: "I know this tactic: GO AWAY FOR A WHILE !!!" You may want to use either: "ruse", "ploy", "game", or "trick", instead of "tactic". In the case of an image, visualise a large "STOP" sign, or your preferred version. Some people go so far as to keep a wide rubber band in their pocket, then put it around their wrist, when they catch themselves backsliding, stretch and release it, as a method of reprogramming their mind sooner, but I don't regard it as being strictly necessary.     Remember to remove it, afterwards, if you use this method. Try replacing a negative thought with a positive affirmation of your choice, like: "I am a unique individual, with my own set of skills, and good points", or "I may not be perfect, but I'm doing the best I can, right now". Practice one of the relaxation methods in sections 2, 11, 2c, or 2i, daily, and when needed. Alternatively, give the EFT a good tryout, to see if it helps you. There is also a version for use in public places, (if you like, you can claim to have a headache, as you massage/lightly tap your temples, but you would then be restricted to subvocalising: saying it to yourself in your mind). Section 53, and pages 2, 2.q and 2.o at http://www.ezy-build.net.nz/~shaneris also refer: "Even though I sometimes suffer from anxiety, I deeply and completely accept myself." Neurofeedback treatment for anxiety is increasingly becoming available.     Herbal remedies, such as valerian, (which is not recommended for use if depression is also present) passionflower, or St.John's wort, are often effective, but the idea is (as with anxiolytic medication) to use them like water wings, or training wheels on a bicycle, providing initial support, and giving time for other treatments, such as therapy, and relaxation techniques, to take effect. Imagine, as vividly as you possibly can, that your concerns, anxieties, worries, fears, your self-recriminations, all the agonizing "I'm-so-Stupids," and "I'm-too-fats"; every painful "I-can't-I-have-it" or "I-can't-do-it"are huge raging, hurtful bulls snorting and charging at you. You see them coming at you and you hold out your red matador's cape at arms length and simply let them charge right by. Every time they come at you, hold out your arm with the red cape and let them rage and snort and go right on past.|`|jKdVtDx7aa	First of all the energy you are using worrying on "stuff' is a waste of energy. Its a merry go round and leads to no where. Jump off now.  Meditate or anything to help. Go on line and find help, there is plenty out there. It can only get worse if you let it. There are medical facilities that will see you if you can get directed to the right place. You may not need insurance. Try to do that and see what happens. I hate to see anyone live like this when they do not have to. I suffered from panic attacks for years and all that fear and worry was for nothing. I let that happen. As I stated before, look things up on the internet about help with anxiety and go from there. One step at a time. Calm your mind and try and SLOW your though process down.That helps. Good luck. I will be glad to help you if you do not have any luck. Contact me if you have to, I don't mind. You can beat this and I know that for a fact. There are support groups for anxiety on the internet. Do not let this disrupt your life. Please tell your doctor.

4UY33elFaa	for me birth control has brought clearer skin. my weight has stayed the same. my period has reduced from 5 to 2 days. plus i am protected from pregnancy. for me birth control has been great. i know others have no had as great of experience.|`|5yFmO1peaa	they all are different.... everyone has different symptoms.   the one i was on caused the same symptoms as yours|`|CG1Yd8yOaa	all birth controls affect different people in defferent ways but you can read up on the most common side effects of each one|`|0Rokad7Uaa	sprintec - very weak cramps (if any!), no spotting, 3 day long periods starting at the exact same time every month, clearer skin.    no bloating but i usually don't bloat too bad as it is. same goes for moodiness and weight gain.    my only problem is nausea for a few days at the beginning of the month. but i get car sick easily, etc, so its most likely just me. i have friends on this pill who have no problem with nausea.|`|WqkFJ2Pgaa	I was on the pill for a couple years with no side effects at all. I never gained weight or anything. I did, however, get pregnant.    After my son was born I switched to depo-provera, the birth control shot, and I don't recommend it. My sex drive practically disappeared, and now, months after stopping, my body still hasn't remembered how to ovulate.|`|5a09c753c4ebf1de1049487c3d4375bbaa	I was on depo-provera (the shot) for 5 years and a LOVED it! I know that a LOT of people have some serious side effects from it though (weight gain, mood swings, and sometimes even heavy bleeding - even thought its supposed to make you not bleed at all!) I, however, didn't experienc any of the common negative side effects. no weight gain, no moodiness, no period (best thing EVER!). Some people also experience some vaginal dryness while on depo, and I did experience this on occasion, but it wasn't anything too terrible. Anyway, I decided after 5 years on the depo, that I should switch to something less packed with hormones because i had gotten married and am thinking about having children sooner than later. I decided to quit the depo and start taking 'the pill'. The pill my doc prescribed was YAZ, which was also GREAT! My periods were fairly light, and not usually more than about 4 days with minimal cramping. My skin was also quite clear the whole time I was taking it as well!    I hope this has helped...|`|tsCXQhMmaa	i don't take bc myself but i am considering going on it. after talking to people about being nervous that it will make me gain weight ive been told that everyone reacts to each type of birth control differently. you just have to find the one that fits for you. a few of my friends went on YAZ and gained a lot of weight and then another one of them went on it and didn't gain any. it really all depends.|`|31Xl7M5faa	Yasmin- Worked ok no major ups or downs  Seasonique- I wanted this one but I tried it post-baby (6weeks after delivery) and never stopped my period BUT I want to try this one again  Ortho-cyclen- Not very happy- no sex drive!!

When you go to the doctor they will give you one that best fits you and your lifestyle. I am on loestrin24 fe. I love this birth control. Helped my cramps/periods, cleared my skin...I had no bad side affects. Another thing to think of is your lifestyle. If you for one second think that you might be forgetful and not remember to take the pill then I strongly suggest the depro-vera bc shot bc then you do not have to worry about forgetting. I have seen so many girls come in and say that they got pregnant because they forgot to take the pill.|`|wqnV1OLWaa	i've been on yasmin pill for over 3 months now, its working great, no obvious side effects, it cleared my skin, regulated my period, no headaches or cramps or moodiness, the only bad side effect i had is that it decreased my sex drive, its not totally gone, i can still orgasm, but it takes longer time, all in all, the benefits are more than side effects, and still, ppl react differently to the same pill.

If you're rubbing them between your thumb and index finger that will cause your contacts to be uncomfortable. Place your contacts in your hand then rub them back and forth with your index finger.    My contacts were uncomfortable so my eye doctor thought it was the brand, but when I told her how I was cleaning them she told me to try another way (the second way I told you), and it helped.|`|6e9wMh6yaa	Maybe you're not rinsing them as often as you should.

Qp821NRyaa	My lovers are very excited seeing me masturbate when we make love. I am bi and we often have masturbation parties...lots of fun too.|`|TORBP6QIaa	Stop worrying...your boyfriend will find it very exciting if you feel the need to  "help yourself" when you have sex.|`|ACnb0UhLaa	tell your other how you like it and that's what they should do. they'll like that|`|KVhbEf6zaa	You will never know until you try it. You may or may not be able to orgasm during sex, everybody is different.|`|fioNl1k7aa	i help myself when needed. my bf is turned on more by me doing this and i am guaranteed a orgasm that way.......|`|JqvSEBIqaa	I had a friend that was like that also, but when I found out and told her about what I had read in my Iridology book, it explained it very clearly and she felt much better about it and herself.? In the control panel in the upper part of the iris of our eyes, (the brain area) is a zone called the Medulla.? It is the power station, the conductor of the physical orchestra.? It helps to set your IQ, your structure type (indirectly, and the amounts of physical control you have over this structure and its function.? It is the physical message transmitter from the brain directly to spinal nerves and their impulses to all co-ordinated body systems, this soft bulb of brain tissue.?? Whiplashes, hits at the base of the skull in sports or over the head with blunt force tramma can loosen the directness of this control and cause incoordination problems.? There are 4 stages of illness in our body.? Acute (white would be in this zone) Subacute (brownish yellow in this zone, Chronic (dark blue or brown in this zone and Degenerative (black in this zone, which is called the Medulla, also all the other zones in the iris.? Plus maybe a hole called a lesion can be at 11am in the R eye and 1am in the L eye and that hole is called an inherited weakness passed on to us by our ancestors..  Sometimes just having the the neck adjusted by a chiropractor often re-activates a sluggish medulla which has got tired of sending physical spinal impulses not correctly translated by the spinal nerve centres.  Structural lesions in the iris at this point can show a record of past physical trauma, or can merely show that you have pulled your head in under stress and that compression has resulted. Next to the Medulla is another zone labelled "sexual impulses".  In the same zone is a second   classification called , "hallucinations".  Iridologists of the older schools labeled this zone "perversions".  They came to the conclusion that sexual impulse equals libido, equals interest, not necessarily action.  It is possible to have a high sexual impulse which is seldom used or a lower one used quite often.  This zone refers only to the level at which the head is occupied with sex.  Another words, if you are not doing it, you're thinking about it!  When you look directly across the eye you will find the zones of the uterus and vagina in the female, prostate and penis in the male.  Obviously, this reflex is often called into use.  When signals become too high for comfort in the head impulse, the body rapidly goes into action to counterbalance the overload. White color over brown or blue eyes in the Medulla means it is over active, brownish yellow means it is underactive, darker blue and darker brown means it is underactive or Chronicly affected, Black means it is in a degenerative state. So whatever is in your eye is how you will be affected by it.  It is not happening because of nothing.  Knowing this puts a light on why there are so many sex affenders in the world.  Two whites together fine, two brownish fog yellows together fine, but put 2 together one white and the other brownish fog or yellowish together, is NOT so good.   Hope this helps you.|`|e7b9d32e1fb4efafbebd927303f7c128aa	You love to masturbate because masturbation relieves sexual tension, feels good, and improves your mood. No need to be bashful or shy about the why: it's perfectly good and healthy.    Masturbation is a good thing for a person to do prior to getting involved in sexual relationships because it means you've got an idea on what it is you like and want - so you can help your sex partner learn how to please you! This is a very good thing to bring into a sexual relationship.    Sex should always be enjoyable, climax from sex however may not be a guarantee... at least not just from penetration. Most women NEED clitoral stimulation to orgasm, and if that is the case for you the person who you have sex with is going to have to be willing to experiment on different ways to use their hands while you are engaging in penetration and\or YOU will have to find ways to use your hands  (or toys) during sex.     Taking care of pleasuring yourself during penetrative sex can be a turn on to your partner, and can heighten your enjoyment of what they are doing aswell, so don't feel eeked out about doing it.    If your sex partner wants to get you off by his endeavor alone (no help from your hands), he'll have to master oral sex and hand sex on you... be expressive, tell him what you like and what you don't - and relax and let yourself enjoy it.    Having "sex" is easy, learning to have GOOD sex takes time, it takes the right partner and a willing attitude to please and be pleased to be shared between both.    You should also know that even in the best sexual relationships,  masturbation is still important to do. Masturbation is different from sex in that it is a completely no pressure situation - where you can be JUST a recipient of pleasure which is beneficial to your body and mind.

But I'm from the south and many African Americans here do the "soul food" thing, which is extremely similar to what we call "country cookin'". It consists of stuff like Fried Chicken, Mashed Potatoes & Gravy, Fried Okrah, Rice & Butterbeans, Biscuits, Corn bread, etc. The only thing different thing I've noticed is that they tend to use a lot more butter and salt and stuff in soul food.... so their version usually tastes way better.
AA11313824	Cindy! this is not safe. This is in fact very dangerous! The most you should safely lose per week is about 2 lbs. However, to answer your question, a pound of fat has aproximately 3500 calories. In order to loose 7 lbs per weeks, you would have to burn 3500 calories more than you consummed per day. The safest minimum calorie intake for a female is 1200 calories per day. Please be careful, weight lost quickly has a tendency to come back quickly. For a better plan, aim for about a lb a week, consumme lots of fruits and vegtables and drink as much water as you can. Exercise regularly and if you really have problems with your weight, talk to your doctor, who can safely help you to lose weight.|`|AA10988453	600|`|AA11169482	During your first week of dieting you willlose about 10-12 lbs. but there after you will only lose 35 lbs. a week.

Also known as nephroblastoma, it's the most common malignant tumor of the kidney in children. The peak time of Wilms' tumor occurrence is at age 3, and it occurs only rarely after age 8. Wilms' tumor may arise in either kidney. Rarely, it affects both kidneys.  The outlook for children with Wilms' tumor has greatly improved in recent decades. Improved imaging techniques help doctors to determine the extent of the cancer in Wilms' tumor and to plan early treatment.

AA11947883	hi :) am not sure whats available in the markets...but, this is what i did to lose weight... PLEASE DONT TAKE PILLS... pills are nothing but anorectic agents... they make you feel less hungry... there is no way to loose weight fast... though , sauna , steam and massages help slightly... it has to be combined with diet and excercise... pills are very bad in the long run... can lead to impotency and infertility...    Also... short term diets are no good because , they terribly pull down your body metabolism rate since you dont eat much during that period ... Because of this , once you break your diet , you'll start putting on more weight, the reduced body metabolism will take longer and slower to burn the food you take in...    They also dont work because once you break your diet and start eating normally, you will get back to your normal weight as you might not be cautious as to how many cals you take in per day...      i lost 10 kgs in about 5 months time... i am getting married in august and i desperately needed to loose weight... i was 65 kilos when i started... according to my BMI , i was 10kgs + overweight... i stand 5'2.odd and 65 kilos is grossly overweight...    just dieting wont help like i found out in my case... diet + exercise will do the trick...    i'll tell you what i did... it worked for me... hope it works for you too :)    the trick is not to starve but to eat smart :) and stay healthy :)    what you should cut down :  oil , butter , cheese , margarine , mayonisse , sauces (depends , will get back to that a bit later), chips , crisps, nuts , chocolates , sugar , cola, fizz , areated drinks ,ice creams , chocolate , alcohol , cakes and everything else thats hi - cal... you'll need to avoid everything thats sweet , oily and sticky... if you are not sure about what foods to avoid... check the net...loads of info available...    vegetables / meat to avoid :  potatoes - very very important , beetroot (its a root and has concenterated sugar in it) , all kinds of roots basically except carrot... avoid lamb, mutton , pork , beef, and prawns... all these put on weight... eat only lean meats... thats fish and chicken.. avoid eating egg yolk... eat just the egg white...    fruits to avoid :  mangoes , bananas , jackfruit      now that we had a look at what foodstuff is to be avoided...you might be wondering if there is anythig at all that you can eat... thats how i felt... there is loads of stuff you can eat actually :)    here they come :)    fast foods are a big no no... you can order salads and special lo cal foods that are avaailable in most outlets...    its best to eat at home for the period you are dieting and trying to lose weight...after those few months... once you've shed your load...you can get back to your usual lifestyle... of course with some caution...      my diet...  breakfast:    skimmed milk (use skimmmed milk , is low in fat , other typer of milk are higher in fat content) , fruit... i am from India... am not sure where you are from and hence you might not understand certain food types we consume here... but let me tell you something... Indian food is very very oily and very difficult to diet...    and try cereal in the mornings... oats, weetabix... etc... have a good breakfast...alwaays use brown bread... whole wheat brown bread is very good for weight reduction...      for lunch , we are staple rice eaters... rice is bad for fat reduction... but i still took rice because its a habit tht cant be changed... everyone takes rice here... so... rice - one cup - 100gms and lots of veggies cooked in less oil.. and absolutely no coconut and curry with less oil... all in all keep your oil intake to 2 tea spoons everyday... that would be just for seasoning... also using olive oil helps a lot...      then for dinner... compulsarily have wheat... pasta is a good option...but make sure you buy wheat pasta... check before buying... and of course in pasta absolutely no sauces... some varities of sauces are acceptable... as far as they dont have cheese , butter , oil ,mayonisse and fattening substances in general... you can use tomato spicy sauces etc... make sure your sugar intake doesnt cross 2 - 3 spoons per day... (not tablespoons) and no butter and ghee of course... eat a lot of fruits and vegetables... and all kinds of cereal... if you are hungry... eat a fruit... or you can eat stuff like puffed wheat and puffed rice... but no puffed corn... corn products again put on weight...      eat sandwiches as much as possible... i dont know which part of the world you are from and hence cant suggest much for you in terms of recepies...    and combined with dieting... you need to excercise for atleast an hour everyday... you'll see the difference...defenitely... if you think gym is boring... take up dance classes... or run along the beach... if you have one... or skate... or just about any physical activity... brisk walking will also help...  the key is to stay healthy while you diet and lose weight...    drink loads of water...atleast 6 glasses per day... and do a lot of physical activity.... take the stairwy instead of the lift.... and small things like that...  if you have any more queries...mail me... cheers :) and good luck :) its not difficult...you'll get used to it in a few days... and of course the results are fab:) who doesnt want a great looking body...    you can get back to your normal lifestyle once you slim down... after that... its just eating what you like and burning it out the next day with just a little bit of excercise :) also check your weight everyday... its a great way to motivate and monitor your progres :)|`|AA10285487	You can go to any of the bir retail stores,and on the aisle with dvds you'll find plenty of dvds for work out-music,dancing everything.|`|AA11331190	Carmen Electra striptease aerobics has a good beat.

dW1n3ScQaa	Well hello, my name is Doctor Austin, and I have been to college to study about this so I know how to help.           Breathe deeply, from your diaphragm; breathing from your chest won't relax you. Picture your breath coming up from your "gut."     Slowly repeat a calm word or phrase such as "relax," "take it easy." Repeat it to yourself while breathing deeply.     Use imagery; visualize a relaxing experience, from either your memory or your imagination.     Nonstrenuous, slow yoga-like exercises can relax your muscles and make you feel much calmer.     Try listening to your favorite song or think about something else or even if you still feel the anger , act as if it's all good then it soon will be!    Hope I helped but I have to get back to work goodbye!     ~ Doctor Estephanie Austin|`|OZfX8fNmaa	Hello, I'm a doctor. I think that you want to get more info about it.

mX0qaX3Eaa	I think the answer would have to be a resounding yes but it depends on whether you have hyPOthyroidism or hyPERthyroidism.    If you suffer from hypothyroid(underactive) you will start to gain weight as a symptom of your condition, so when you start taking the medication and your thyroid starts functioning properly you will probably notice that, in time and with exercise, you start to lose the weight you put on due to the illness being untreated.    Hyperthyroidism will cause you to lose weight as a symptom and your loss should stabilise with treatment.|`|AA11492002	The current drug of choice for weight loss is Ritalin - the hyper activity drug for kids.

Or just a bit more active becuase the baby kept you up? Think about what may have tipped the scales.

If you have normal anatomy sinus surgery should be one of the last resorts because it will not cure the underlying problem causing the inflammation (such as allergies or pollution).  ENTs realize this and many test for allergies too.   Sinus surgery itself is a day surgery that involves anesthesia and some recovery time and probably packing.

Get a fitness calculator that you can put on your cell phone and computer. This will allow you to easily  calculate this formula, log your daily calorie consumption, and log your physical activities.    *2) Eat natural and organic foods found on earth versus something created by a corporation to make money. Eat meals in small portions throughout the day and take a good multi-vitamin supplement.     Avoid High Glycemic Load Carbs (sugar, pastries, desserts, refined starches such as breads, pasta, refined grains like white rice; high starch vegetables such as white potatoes) and drink lots of water.     Do not try fad diets. Here is an excellent food pyramid that anyone can follow: http://www.rayandterry.com/html/images/P...    *3) Exercise on most days by doing cardiovascular training and/or resistance training activities.     Read a book or find a certified trainer to make sure your doing all resistance training exercises correctly. A great book to buy that teaches you the resistance training basics is Weight Training For Dummies. A superb magazine to buy with excellent resistance training routines that will not get you bored is "Muscle and Fitness". Signup for the free newsletter.    A good book to buy that teaches you the cardiovascular training basics is Fitness For Dummies.     *4) Get plenty of sleep. Sleep experts say most adults need between seven and nine hours of sleep each night for optimum performance, health, and safety.     *5) Educate yourself continually on health issues. A good free publication is  Dietary Guidelines For Americans 2005. A superb book to read is You The Owners Manual. An excellent periodic publication is the Nutrition Action Health Letter.    *6) Make a life long commitment to good health. A great test you can take to measure your biological age is at http://realage.com Look at other areas where you can improve your health.

Cardio excercise burns fat usually burning first what you put on last.  Just keep trying different cardio activities (not just running) and it will eventually go away.  Eating right after a workout is actually very important because your body needs energy to make up for the energy you just expended.  During this time is when your body is still burning calories from your workout, so as your taking in calories, your body is burning them quicker than it would be if you weren't just working out.|`|AA10240911	Here's a link with lots of great info on how to trim your waist: http://ezinearticles.com/?A-Smaller-Wais...

DFXS4SB4aa	I know that feeling. I wear a 42E myself. It's a major cause of back pain, self consciousness, and annoyance when around pig-headed men.     A few women in my family have gone through the procedure, as the huge breasts seem to run in the family. They've told me there is some loss of sensation in the nipple, but it's worth it to be comfortable in their own bodies.     The tattoo will probably look a bit distorted due to the decrease in surface area. I had the same question about that as well, i have a claddagh across my chest.     Good luck to you|`|orIAir11aa	I had a breast reduction in August of 2008. I was in moderate   pain after the surgery for about 2 weeks. I was sent home with   pain medication, and it did help, but like almost every surgery,   there is pain involved in having a breast reduction. As far as   sensation, there are two types of breast reductions. One surgery  never severs the nipples from the breasts, and the other completely  removes the nipples from the breast and reattaches them in their  correct location. I had the surgery in which my nipples were   removed. It's called a free nipple graft. I have very little sensation  in either of my nipples. For me, it was more important to be   comfortable in my body than to have nipple sensation. I no longer   have back pain, shoulder pain, or neck pain. I am so much   happier. As far as the tattoo, it's going to depend on where it is.  Breast reduction scars are under the breast, and straight up the  bottom of them. If your tattoo is in the center of your chest or   on your upper breast, it should be ok. I hope I've helped you some,  and good luck!|`|3h3m2UAOaa	wow who would actually want to lose great big breast? what is the world coming to?|`|Mumfvpuzaa	i had a breast reduction in oct 08.  it was the best decision i ever made and am very happy with the results.  i had no lose of sensation.  for 2-3 weeks after surgery, my nipples were hyper sensitive.  then they went back to normal.  one month after surgery, i went back to the gym but was only allowed to do non bouncing activities (treadmill, stationary bike) at 3 months i was able to resume all normal activities.  it took about 3 months for all the swelling to go down.  but they look great and my scars are healing very nicely.  it wasn't very painly, they gave me drugs.  the most painful thing was the drive home from the hospital.  every bump and turn hurt.  but it was all worth it!!!  good luck

9cba094486c6e7ab49a59ac5ea44682faa	Palpitations are very common. They are generally a benign normal variation and do not represent pathology. Only occasionally are they indicative of an underlying heart problem. As you have had "all the tests going" I assume underlying pathology has been ruled out?    Stimulants such as coffee and tea are common causes, however as you don't drink these sorts of drinks, that doesn't apply to you.    A common cause of palpitations is anxiety and undue circumspection. Some evidence suggests that increasing magnesium in the diet may help- it's worth a shot, just be careful not to exceed the RDA. If you are anxious about it then this will make the situation worse and you will get yourself into a vicious circle.     If the tests you had ruled out any underlying heart disease, then you know there is nothing to worry about.  It seems as though you are looking for a reason for your palpation's and sometimes there isn't always a reason. Awareness is quite common, sometimes it is just one of those things,- if you do suffer from anxiety problems then perhaps your Dr could refer you for CBT (Cognitive Behavioural Therapy), this type of therapy has a 70% success rate. Another option would be SSRIs.|`|AA12266052	If medication to control heart rhythm fails, your doctor may suggest radiofrquency ablation.  Radiofrequency energy is used to destroy abnormal electrical pathways in heart tissue. It is used in recurrent atrial fibrillation and other types of supraventricular tachycardia.|`|5UQtaxfVaa	have ou been diagnosed with anything yet? sounds like either panic attacks or supra ventricular tachycardia which basically means over and above the normal 80 bpm, your heart rate may reach 249bom when having palpitations,your doctor should rule this out first even though you have been on beteblockers he/she may offer you radio frequency ablation which burns out the slow pathway or part of it and it can totally correct your condition,not without risks though go to your doctor first,
AA10273788	I would contact your family doctor.  I am hypoglycemic myself, but I also tend to have very low iron levels.  If you have been having sugar crashes, you need to get it checked out, and quickly.  They can lead to losses of concentration, black outs, migraines, impared vision, appearance of drunkeness, and the list goes on.  I don't want to worry you, but I want you to know that you really do need to contact your family doctor tomorrow morning.|`|AA11730389	ask your doctor|`|0a04f8e812447fc9d51b637f365b3f67aa	that could either a sign of anemia or diabetes... get a blood test.. blood count should tell whether  you are anemic or not.. if normal then check your sugar level...your family doctor should order that for you.. make sure you are not hypertensive either..|`|9dda66ae1889f6326e7e0ae2855b1178aa	Contact your family doctor.
wU2SvL6Qaa	yes you're right you have hazel eyes, the reason why they change depending on what you wear is because light reflects off of it and brings out that certain color more..and the reason why your eyes are somewhat green is because if your dark eyed parent has a light eyed someone in the family, they might have a recessive gene (like all blue eyed people), there is a one in four chance that you have light eyes but it increases if you're not a first born..hope this answered your question :)|`|sggGNsWiaa	probably hazel.. mine change color with light. they can go from dark green to blonde.|`|9eHI9olraa	maybe your eyes are hazel?   im not sure.   thats the best i could think of srry.|`|t5Mz1aLvaa	Maybe you're like my friend. She has different color eyes, like it green around the edges and brown near the pupil. or the other way around. Or maybe you're just special by having your color eyes and you should be happy about them.|`|czB9nABWaa	we need a picture,   but your eyes are Hazel if they are changing colors  mine are hazel and they have been green, brown, red, blue, orange, and a lor more|`|xlvzvAwJaa	this happens to me except my eye color changes with the season their blue in the spring/ summer then green in fall/winter i am not sure why|`|IjwOIRcmaa	Mine and my friend's eyes do the same thing.

It's normal.|`|L6DFPXo6aa	Most girls tend to get wet around that age...  it's when you start to notice guys more and the wetness is just your body's form of lubrication for sexual stuff, even if you have no intention.  Also, it's your body's way of cleaning out down there.  If you feel kinda soggy, try wearing pantyliners, you can get them for thongs too, but there's more coverage for the bikini undies.  Don't worry you're just growing up.  :)|`|eji2mBAlaa	oh, come on...dont stress!  Its so normal, u can get turned on!  Your a girl!

4PQOiSfZaa	You can take a vegan probiotic supplement. Only fermented foods contain probiotics and fermented foods usually contain dairy.|`|WNIERswTaa	It is possible to get probiotics as a tablet from a pharmacy.|`|7SmHY4o4aa	Not sure what other foods but there are some great supplements out there that are more effective than eating yogurt.    The single most important thing you need to remember is that it does pay to buy a good probiotic. Not all live up to their claims. Find one that is in a glass bottle. Plastic bottles allow moisture in which destroys acidophilus. Look for a daily dose of 3 billion living cells.    My health food store recommends a brand called Kyo-Dophilus. Their formulation is stable at room temperature and doesn't need refrigeration like most. This makes it suitable for travel. It is also made from a human strain making it more adaptable to the human body than a non-human, dairy strain. They also offer various formulas including a chewable one for children.    Be sure to take a probiotic at the end of a meal. This is because the stomach is an acidic environment and has been designed to kill off bugs - the good ones along with the bad. After a meal, the acid is diluted, so the probiotic can survive and make it's way to the intestinal tract.    It is important to constantly replenish your friendly intestinal bacteria to maintain a good flora balance. Adding probiotics to your diet is simple and it has the potential to greatly improve your health and strengthen your immunity. Hope this helps ;)

f5f2cbaa7f2dc242e7b6f95e3a1514daaa	Yeah it's very possible to have your period twice when on these medications,heck, even when not. Don't worry too much about it or loose sleep over it. Unless you have it again within a week or so, or there's excessive bleeding, you shouldn't be too worried about it, if it does reappear within a week or there's excessive bleeding however, you should contact your doctor and tell him/her what is going on. =]|`|0dqfwKk7aa	missing pills can cause irregular bleeding.  You should ask your doctor about starting a new pack and when?
G7fqgUo3aa	Honestly, the yellow or green mucus doesn't mean an infection. Normally a cold can last a couple weeks...but since it has still lasted I would see the DR. I get 2-3 sinus infections a year, spring and fall. They are annoying and painful. A cold can just be a cold, which includes sneezing, congestion, headache, sore throat, coughing etc... When you get a lot of congestion, it can cause bacteria to build up in your sinuses, causing it to get infected...turning into a sinus infection. It doesn't always mean that antibiotics will work. To help prevent sinus infections, I've started doing Sinus Drains...they help quite a bit. They are kinda gross to me, but they relieve the pressure. Til you get to the DR, take Sudafed, Claritin or Dayquil (helps relieve headache and stuffiness) and try to buy stuff at a local pharmacy to do a sinus drain. If you can get a humidifier for near your bed, that will help a bit too.|`|IQssydjSaa	Yes, you most likely do.  You for sure have one if there is pressure below your eyes and if you get headaches frequently.  Im sorry and I hope you feel better :)|`|WcuYfsWbaa	yes u probably do. and idk if its normal but the sneezing thing happens 2 me 2 :P|`|ujT5teZgaa	yes|`|HcMvtMT7aa	Well, colds can linger around for a very long time.  If your mucus has a yellow or green color to it, then yes, you do have a severe sinus infection and you probably will need antibiotics, unless you think you can endure another month of having a cold.|`|eD9frdYmaa	you defiantly have a sinus infection|`|X8M86ZIxaa	Brenda,  It does sound to me like you may have a sinus infection. Pressure, (like you mentioned) behind the eyes, on certain places around the skull are very common symptoms of a sinus infection. The symptom that often is the biggest give away to a doctor that you have an infection going on is orange or dark colored mucus. If you are having this stuff come out of your nose, its a sinus infection. Its good you are going to the doctor, he will be able to help you out. You will end up on some antibiotics if you are indeed, diagnosed with a S.I. Take it from me Brenda.. Take every last one of those pills! Do not miss one! If you do not take all your antibiotics the infection will likely not go away and come back STRONGER and harder to treat the next time. Hope that helps! Good luck at the Doc!  ~Genevieve

I use Dreamfields Pasta which has net 5 carbs but you have to be diligent in cooking only as directed. Cooked too done and the glycemic load raises. Cooked el dente you only have to count 5 carbs per 2 oz (dry) serving. The calories are all the same, about 200 calories per 2 oz (dry) serving, so you have to be careful in that respect. I find Dreamfields Pasta at the larger grocery store chains or online at http://www6.netrition.com/cgi/prices.cgi...|`|8OqdoIHtaa	Most diabetic books are written by cook book writers, not diabetics or nutrition experts.     They can also be quite out of date.     Stick with low carb recipes instead of diabetic recipes, they're usually low in carbs and more up to date.     I get most of my recipes from low carb websites and then fine tune them to suit my needs.    I have a couple on my blog.   http://blog.360.yahoo.com/blog-NbDgUzQhf...|`|AA10299265	This is just a guess... maybe because the person who wrote the recipe isn't diabetic and doesn't have a clue as to what glycemic index is.    Seriously, most dietitians and nutritionists are taught this way. They don't really know that much about how different grains react in our systems. For that matter, many diabetics don't even know this.

Y4ogWjHOaa	Hi Dominic,    Acute means the sudden onset of a condition . Chronic means a condition is ongoing or long term.    So as an example someone could have chronic bronchitis meaning it is a recurring and long term condition. If they suddenly develop an sudden (acute ) attack they are said to have acute on chronic bronchitis.    Hope this helps.    Mel.X|`|FgFmj8d2aa	I have no idea what the rest of your question besides the header means but I'll entertain you with an answer anyway. Acute means serious, critical, severe, or sharp, depending on what you're referring  to. An acute medical condition means it's requires immediate medical attention or is at an advanced stage.

6e58ce6577be3f4549253fc7148b5e1caa	I have a question, how do you perform at home removal of the implanon implant?  Did that hurt?  Removal of the implanon implant is just like removing any form of birth control.  So the return of your periods will take a while.  It may take a few months.
5a09c753c4ebf1de1049487c3d4375bbaa	Well I suppose that everyones experi3ence differs somewhat, but your experience with YAZ so far sounds a lot like mine has been! The same thing that is happening to you happened to me almost every month! The answer to your question is no. Your period will most likely not stop the day that you tale your first pink pill (mine never did). It should however stop within 2 or 3 days after... After a few months of this happening to me, I consulted my doctor to make sure that nothing was wrong, and he said it's perfectly normal. Sometimes it takes a day or two for the pills you've taken all month to get out of your system I guess, and that's why it doesn't always start right away. And also why it doesn't stop right when you start taking the pills again.  Anyway, there shouldn't be anything to worry about! Hope you like the YAZ! I loved it!
4hr9JGAdaa	ok, i watched a video about salmonella, and here are some facts: ( i cant remember much, but i hope this helps)     -your sis will be using the bathroom a lot, and if you give her any form of pepto-bismol or a upset stomache medicine, she will end up throwing up because her body is trying to get rid of the virus.     -her body is trying to fight off the virus, so she will probably be in the bathroom a lot, and let her rest, it will pass.     there are worst food poisonings then salmonella, so be grateful she doesnt have anything worst, take her to the doctor if things get bad, like bloody stool or anything serious.|`|mAp90hEeaa	First, it depends on what symptoms she is having before you can come the the diagnosis of salmonella.  And, not all raw chicken has salmonella present.  It would be difficult to give advice when no symptoms are listed in your question except for a fever which should be treated with regular tylenol or ibuprofen.    I have read your additional symptoms and she could have a common stomach " bug" which usually goes away on its own in 2-3 days.  You can go to WebMd and type in gastroenteritis on how to take care of this condition.|`|LKqbrHNnaa	How do you know for sure she has salmonella? A person could eat a whole raw chicken and still not pick up the illness.  If she has salmonella then you'd have to take her to a walk-in health centre or to the hospital as it can be serious, particularly in young children.  Is she having severe vomiting, diarrhea, high fever, feels delusional/is hallucinating, can't keep liquids down?  If so then she needs re-hydration therapy immediately and needs to go and see a different doctor.    If you decide to keep her at home and she is having those symptoms, make sure she gets lots of rest in bed, with a plastic bin or bucket by her side for her sickness. She needs access to water at all times and should sip it regularly to hydrate her. If she doesn't get better within 3 - 5 days, get help from a professional.|`|xO1LQWbZaa	I had Salmonella Christmas eve.  I just vomited a lot and had diarrhea and a fever and headaches.  I just took it easy, threw up a lot, and got better after about two days.  Thank goodness it wasnt a bad case...|`|vrcF0Qj7aa	Well first of all do you know she has salmonella, it could be a small virus or flu. Also not all chicken will contain salmonella. Watch for symptoms such as a fever of 103 - 104 degrees, feel weak, upset stomach, and loss of appetite. The only way to know if it is salmonela is to have a blood test or stool sample. If these symptoms occur, go to you doctor, hospital or walk-in-clinic immediatly! If you do have the infection they will give you an antibiotic, and she will be in quarentinne. I am not trying to scare you but as many as 20% may die from this infection, so take it very seriously. If your doctor won't, take her to the hospital! Good luck, and I hope your sister is alright!|`|EnkR4gAVaa	She could or couldn't have salmonella. She could have a different kind of food poisoning. Why the hey did she eat that raw chicken, anyway?!?! Let her take her time in the bathroom. God bless your souls.|`|01Mu3wUeaa	Just because she has gastro upsets, doesn't mean that she has salmonella.    You will not know unless you take a fecal sample (or symptoms last long enough)    She could just have Norwalk virus:    Norwalk virus  (Just remember that hand sanitizers will not kill this virus.House hold cleaners such as Lysol will also not kill you.You must use bleach.)    The Norwalk virus causes viral Gastroenteritis which is known as the nasty 24 hour bug that causes explosive and sudden diarrhea and projectile vomiting.Usually non life threating but can cause complications in the very young,elderly and those with compromised immune systems.    PREVENTION-Wash your hands before preparing food/eating food and most importantly, TOUCHING YOUR MOUTH/NOSE/EYES.    The ONLY way to become infected with this virus is if you ingest the contaminated fecal/vomit particles through your eyes,nose and mouth.    It is impossible to "breathe" in the virus BUT possible to become infected by breathing in aerosol "spray" droplets from someone vomiting right next to you.(the droplets settle within minuted but can still infect someone until cleaned with bleach)    Even if your whole family breaks out with this virus, you can prevent it by washing your hands for at least 15-20 seconds with warm water and soap.Remember that you are not killing the virus, you are washing it down the drain even if you use an antibacterial soap (which only kills bacteria, not viruses) hand sanitizers are also not successful in killing the virus.    If a member of your family comes down with the virus, let them know to wash their hands AFTER a bowel movement and vomiting.    To clean infected areas, clean with BLEACH.Clean bathrooms (all infected areas) with a bleach solution as soon as possible and be sure to prevent cross contamination and wash your hands afterwards.Especially children! wipe down all commonly touched objects like door knobs, faucet handles, light switches, toilet flushers etc.    People are STILL contagious even after 24 hours after their symptoms settle down so it is always important to wash your hands after the rest room (which you should do anyways!)    The key to staying Norwalk virus free is to keep sanitary.Wash your hands after using the bathroom...you could prevent other peoples misery as well as yours!!    TIPS:Do not share any cups/plates/utensils with an infected person and be sure to wash in a bleach solution to prevent cross contamination with the rest of your family.

In some, the body would prefer to break down recently built muscle before going to fat stores|`|AA12121778	How Your Body Breaks Down Fat  When you are not eating, or you are exercising, your body must draw on its internal energy stores of complex carbohydrates, fats and proteins. Your body's prime source of energy is glucose. In fact, some cells in your body, such as brain cells, can get energy only from glucose.   The first line of defense in maintaining energy is to break down carbohydrates, or glycogen, into simple glucose molecules -- this process is called glycogenolysis. Next, your body breaks down fats into glycerol and fatty acids in the process of lipolysis. The fatty acids can then be broken down directly to get energy, or can be used to make glucose through a multi-step process called gluconeogenesis. In gluconeogenesis, amino acids can also be used to make glucose    In the fat cell, other types of lipases work to break down fats into fatty acids and glycerol. These lipases are activated by various hormones, such as glucagon, epinephrine and growth hormone. The resulting glycerol and fatty acids are released into the blood, and travel to the liver through the bloodstream. Once in the liver, the glycerol and fatty acids can be either further broken down or used to make glucose

AA11223133	You can buy Xenical on the internet, but it can cost you anything from 50 onwards for one months worth.

AA11813754	I am so sorry that you are facing intolerance in a time when you need all the support you can get.  It's unfortunate, but some societies aren't used to dealing with mental disorders.  Some bury the disorders or dismiss them as someone trying to get attention.  I don't know much about Taiwan, but here in the USA, Manic/Depressive Disorder (or Bipolar Disorder) is also misunderstood sometimes.  Perhaps there is some kind of support group in your area that would be able to help you deal with all the adversity you are facing.  Good luck.  I'll pray for you.|`|AA11301249	Have you ever wondered about the reason of our existence? Have you ever wondered why we die, and where we go after death? What will happen to us in the end? Have you ever asked yourself why God made the earth and all that is in it under mans dominion? Why were the night and the day, and the sun and the moon created? What are we supposed to do during our lifetime? Were we created just to eat, drink, and enjoy ourselves before we die? As one poet put it:   I do not know whence I have come.   I saw my feet walking on the road.   As they please I go and stop.   What am I doing here?   How did the road find me?  I do not know! I do not know! I do not know!     God has emphasized in many verses of the Quran that He did not create us without purpose. He said: What! Do you think that I created you simply in jest? And that you would not be returned to Me?  (23:115) He also said: What! Does man think that he will be left to roam at his will? (75:36) In addition, He said: Do people think that they will be left to say: We believe, and they will not be held accountable? (29:2)   Indeed, God Has created human beings for a purpose and with a purpose: TO WORSHIP HIM ALONE (Monotheism). He said: I have not created the Jinn and humankind except only to worship Me. I don't require provision or feeding from them. Surely Allah  is the All-provider, the Possessor of all strength, the Firm. (51:56-58) In fact, all prophets told their people to worship God alone (Monotheism) and shun worshipping His creation (Paganism). God said: I assuredly sent among every people a messenger with the command: Worship Allah and avoid worshipping false gods. (16:36)  Prophet Abraham, for example, believed in One God, who had no partner. Anyone who holds a different understanding of God than this has contradicted the religion of Abraham and follows falsehood. God says in the Quran: Those who reject the religion of Abraham make fools of themselves. (2:130)  Prophet Jesus was reported in the Gospels to have said: It is written: Worship the Lord your God and serve Him only. (Luke 4:8)  Prophet Jacob also said (in the Qur'an) to his people: Indeed, those which you worship besides Allah are only names that you and your forefathers have established, for which Allah has sent down no authority. The command belongs only to Allah. He has commanded that you worship none but Him. That is the right religion, but most people do not understand.

God has said:  (But whoever turns away from the Quran, he will have a hard life, and We will raise him up blind on the Day of Judgment.) (Quran, 20:124)  This may explain why some people commit suicide while they enjoy the material comfort money can buy.

If you must make another attempt, try to explain the "biological" and "chemical" aspect of the illness, after all, that is really the foundation of it.

I had a girlfriend that over 18 years ago had the tummy tuck and lipo of her belly and hips only to find out abut 5 years later that the area where they took fat out, and left some in (of course), had to be repeated to keep her "shape".  Apparently the fat cells that remain only get larger, and begin to "fill in" the empty area the first lipo left.  So those fat cells filled in the space and she was back to stage one again within a few years.  Lipo is not a quick fix I learned.  Lipo was always I thought I'd like to have done too, but not now that I know you have to have it done again and again and that it is not permanent.  I always thought that it was.  Sorry to boost your bubble.  Say 15 years ago lipo was $10,000 for her belly and hips, you can guess what it would cost now!  And, they are only allowed to remove "so much" fat, that is why so many don't do that, but end up  having to have the stomach staple thing done which is more permanent and everlasting.  If you are really heavy, lipo won't "tke care of the situation".  Its only for those folks with a lot of unlimited money resources and need just a bit of help to look slimed down.

We had an intimate relationship for about eight months.  The teacher had told several other students about the relationship without my knowledge and I didn't find out that anyone else knew until I was questioned by investigators for 6 hours without a parent or attorney present.  Well obviously the relationship ended and I found out all this stuff after the relationship ended about his personal life that he didn't share with me.  It was very difficult because I was so manipulated by this person that I believed everything he told me and I did everything he told me to.  So come to find out a few years later, he is now a pastor of a church!! I believe everything is a learning experience and this definitely was one for me.  I believe that god wont give us anything that we cant handle and this situation was part of gods plan for my life.  It is unfortunate that these things happen, but sometimes, like in this case, there was no way to tell that this person was a danger because he was a public servant and people put their trust in people of authority as was the case in this matter.|`|AA11343075	i wish i can hook up with my pretty lecturer...|`|b2b0e8e890238debbe5c70ba5ad013d0aa	Why do you want to know?

AA12270622	Wow... so many people answering "just don't make it feel as good".    What's the point of having sex last longer if it's BORING?    Okay, in order to make it last longer and still feel just as good, without having to resort to doing things like use a topical anaesthetic on your penis, do this:    First, when you're having intercourse, pay attention to the muscles you're using to thrust with.  Chances are they're the muscles in your butt and in your thighs.  Believe it or not, that makes you have an orgasm quicker.    Instead, let those muscles relax and switch to thrusting with your lower back.  It will keep intercourse feeling just about as good as always, you don't have to lose any of the sensation, and it will last longer.    Second, if you prefer an approach where the female gets to be on top, lay down and instead of keeping your legs flat on the floor (or mattress, or whatever), pull them up so your thighs are at a forty-five degree angle away from you.  Then while she's on top, let her lean back against your legs.  This not only gives her a bit of support to relax on, but it points your penis down and away from your head, which again prolongs the period before you ejaculate without having to sacrifice the sensitivity.      This also works if she likes to face away from you.  All she need do at that point is lean forward and brace herself on your knees with the palms of her hand.  It puts your penis at the same angle and provides the same effect.    No fancy toys, no de-sensitizing lubes needed.    Also, as always, I recommend learning to become multi-orgasmic (yep, it's possible for men, too).  Check out the books "Any Man Can" and "The Multi-Orgasmic Male".  Both are excellent instruction manuals to keying you into getting to not only last longer, but have a whole lot more fun than you thought possible while doing it.    Any more questions, just let me know.  =)|`|AA12134733	By having the male stop for a few seconds when he feels close to having an orgasm.

AA10168509	Back when I was in college, I got a copy from the bookstore at our local mall.  They had to order it for me.  Most stores do not Cary it on the shelves, but they can order it for you.    Perhaps I can save you a little money by letting you know that most of the things in that book really do not work.  As a matter of fact, a lot of what they tell you in that book can do serious harm to you.  I think most people hear about the book, and how it tells you how to blow stuff up, and make home-made drugs in your kitchen.  I never actually tried to make any of the explosive stuff, but I did try to make the banana skin drug that was supposed to make you hallucinate.  All I made from that experiment was a big mess in the kitchen!  After that I never tried any of the other "experiments" in the book.      Most of the book can be found on-line for free.  just google it.    I cant stress enough that while some of the things in that book sound like they would be cool, they are really dangerous.  that book is probably responsible for more kids blowing their hands apart, than any other book.

In fact many woman will tell you that is can actaully become uncomfortable for them as your ejaculation time has now been increased beyond what is pleasurable.. It may also cause you to loose enough sensation that you won't be able to ejaculate. Not being able to ejaculate can lead to a psycological block , there by making you work harder with no result and a very sore penis. The choice becomes yours and your partner.|`|dfecffa22c3a2e5c0c2774968e5c056daa	yes you can with no fear, hope she enjoys it too afterwards lol|`|AA11409431	I've heard of someone doing that and it wasn't a pleasureable experience.

Food choices and health  Foods with folic acid  Originally Published: October 27, 1995 / Updated on: July 29, 1998  Printer Friendly Version       Dear Alice,    What foods contain folic acid?    -- The Bee         Dear The Bee,    Folic acid, also known as folate or folacin, is an important B vitamin that significantly lowers the risk of serious birth defects of the brain and spinal cord. Folic acid is important in the synthesis of DNA, which controls cell function and heredity as well as tissue growth. In addition, folate acts with vitamin B-12 to produce red blood cells. Preliminary studies also suggest that folacin may be helpful in preventing cervical cancer.    Most people get an adequate amount of folic acid from the foods they eat. Alcoholics, pregnant women, and people taking certain medications may be at higher risk for folate deficiency. Women of childbearing age (approximately fifteen to forty-five years) are recommended to include 400 micrograms of folic acid in their diets, particularly important before and during pregnancy to prevent birth defects.    The U.S. Recommended Dietary Allowance (RDA) for folate is 180 - 200 micrograms (mcg). Rich dietary sources of folate are recommended over supplements. They include:        * Dark green, leafy vegetables      * Whole wheat bread      * Lightly cooked beans and peas      * Nuts and seeds      * Sprouts      * Oranges and grapefruits      * Liver and other organ meats      * Poultry      * Fortified breakfast cereals and enriched grain products     One cup of orange juice provides half the RDA for folate, underscoring how easy a nutrient it is to consume. Food processing destroys 50 percent to 90 percent of the folate in foods, as it is very susceptible to heat. It is really important to eat raw foods and lightly cooked vegetables as they retain their nutrient value the best when cooked minimally in water -- through steaming, stir-frying, or microwaving. It is not a good idea to take a folate supplement. In fact, the FDA limits the amount of folate available in vitamin supplements because excess folate in the body could mask a vitamin B-12 deficiency, which could be dangerous. However, pregnant women can supplement with a prenatal vitamin to be sure to get a sufficient amount. Check with your obstetrician or midwife to be sure.    Folic acid and vitamins B-6 and B-12 could also help lower and control homocysteine (an amino acid) levels in the blood, recently gaining recognition as a risk factor for heart disease.

However, since not everyone has necessarily had the opportunity to act on their sexual/romantic attractions, some people prefer a looser definition; for instance, that a bisexual is a person who - in their own estimation - feels potentially able to have such attraction. This could be anyone who has erotic, affectionate, or romantic feelings for, fantasies of, and/or experiences with both men and women. A bisexual may be more attracted to one sex than the other, attracted equally to both, or find people's sex unimportant (see section A7). The strength of their attractions to men and women may vary over time.    lesbian- The first mentions of same-sex love between women come from ancient Greece. Sappho, the eponym of lesbianism, is thought to have had a complex love life  some ancient accounts describe her as having love affairs with men as well; while one ancient source, Maximus of Tyre, claimed that her relationships with the girls in her school* were purely platonic. Modern scholarship, basing itself on ancient texts, suggests a parallel between the ancient Greek constructs of love between men and boys, and the relationships between Sappho and her students, in which "both pedagogy and pederasty played a role."[1]    your choice hun.. don't ever let society tell you how to feel|`|AA11518407	then focus on an area of your life that you are sure about -- like career or something....and that way when you're ready to decide on a relationship direction, you'll be financially equipped to do so!|`|b055b9ce8537276657861dc1ac9e5232aa	you can be bi, go both ways|`|4456c07829e3e39d0d6dff49fe3570faaa	Don't decide anything.

AA11611499	Your stretch marks will not go away, but don't worry, most guys don't care about stretch marks. Your hips will look fine if you lose some weight. Those 200 pound girls do have stretch marks, they are just stretched tight, if they lost some weight, you would be able to see them.|`|b32e560414238926779c6d2630e98a48aa	Strtch marks happen when your body goes through rapid growth. That means that your hips grew in a spurt, and you can not help this. Yous marks will lighten. It also has to do with how much elasticity you have in your skin. Take vitamin E to help that.

I don't believe that anymore because I see young teens with stretch marks. What I found out why teens get  these ugly marks is their diet. Losing weight too fast, then gaining weight to fast. Even Young Beautiful skin being stretched, starved and dieted and binged will scar in the form of radical dieting without  enough exercise. Not to nag but my son has stretch marks, Both men and women or even children have them. They say surgery can correct them, but that may leave another scar. Your skin is with you for a life time.|`|AA12240654	Sometimes when your body develops fast you can get stretch marks. No biggie. Just rub cocoa butter lotion on it twice daily. I had the same problem when my breast developed. The cocoa butter will fade the marks over time...don't worry :-)|`|AA11985343	You can buy a special lotion or cream for you marks at most stores.  the kind especially for stretch marks.

Because of this, I have stretchmarks from my armpits to the upper portion of my pecks.  Stretchmarks form when the skin is stretch faster then it can recover or heal.  The elastisity of your skin plays a huge role in this.  It may take years to develope a fat role, and you can still get stretchmarks if your skins elastisity isn't good enough to handle it.  If you loose the roles, I'm sure you'll look hot, hips and all, just do it healthy.  You might try vitamin e supliment to emprove the skins elasticity, and eat gell-o once in a while.  I'd use an allo vera and vitamin e lotion on the marks.  good luck|`|AA11281358	Stretch marks are created when you gain weight rapidly. Maybe the 200 lb girl you're referring to gained her weight slowly. It's possible for a 130 lb girl to have them if let's say she went from 95 to 130 in a year. It's all about time, your skin has to adjust which is why pregnant women get them.|`|AA10074687	Everyone has a genetically predetermined amount of elastin in their skin. Elastin is what makes your skin stretch. If you don't have a lot, your skin creates a kind of scar tissue to cope with weight gain. These are stretch marks. If you do, then you don't develop them.     Cocoa butter, makes them go away. But very slowly. Don't worry about them. They'll fade and almost all women have them SOMEWHERE.|`|dc2a3d71eea4082358b111a03ed6be76aa	Actually stretch marks will go away with Palmer's Cocoa Butter. It worked for me when I had that problem. But you have to use it everyday. and any lotion with vitamin E in it. When your body expands you get stretch marks because it being stretch out of it's normal proportion.
AA10663661	well... it depends because i had my periods late for 2 months that is after my periods in march i got the next in june.I thought it was because i was pregnant.I ran two tests at that time both showing me negative.People say that if your periods are late for more than 15 days you should run a pregnancy test.If it is negative run the test again after a week.    But there are times when a period may be late like change in climate and food(as in my case) and also if yours is irregular.  my sister has delayed periods that too for 4 months.It is the samr reason, the food change and climate change.    So go for a pregnancy test 15 days after your missed period and then try it again after one week of negative.If it goes on for another month or two, see a doctor and he will tell you the rest.|`|9074122dd6f0c9c98341a5fc8ff462a6aa	I Don't Know.................|`|75a65e5567db50d9118d5fd300aaa94eaa	the fact that you are waiting tells me you alreay have an idea. you can buy tests now that can tell you 4 days before you are due period! hope its the answer you want chick!!|`|AA11741511	Now is a good indication that you need to worry.|`|34b72e85f6c7daf708f37effcb0adf37aa	Purchase an inexpensive Pregnancy Test Kit available at  supermarkets.

All programs are really different, It is dependent upon the instructor and how they were trained.  Some might find this through intense forms of training or soothing forms of visualization.   Ask to watch a class at a variety of schools, then ask your questions to the instructor afterwards. Take notes during your visits and interview the students who have been taking classes on why they like the program. This will help you decide upon the best program for you.|`|efdfddac32e8360954734c4255a2fc46aa	Try Aikido.

0600c972754baed3d003a4f8f25bc6a3aa	I have been being treated for complex PTSD. I have been working with EMDR for a few years. You should look to work with a therapist who received their training through the EMDRA.   Some questions you should ask before beginning are: What is your level of training? How long have you been using EMDR? and have you used EMDR with others who have PTSD.    EMDR has been very helpful for me personally. However you need to learn certain skills such as containment,  safe place, and how to regulate the memories that you are going to work on.  Your therapist should also give you a STOP signal .     You also should know that EMDR continues to work between sessions. There may be times that you may want to check in with your therapist between sessions.   Your therapist should have also screened you for dissociation. using a DES scale.     PTSD can be treated successfully with EMDR in fact the Veteran's Administration uses it for Veterans with PTSD.    There is a book written by Forrest and Shepero about EMDR. Either your therapist should have it or you can git it at any large book store (Borders, Barn's and Noble) or on Amazon.com    You can find out more about EMDR  at EMDRA.org or the EMDR Portal .  IT may take a while- Take it slow- But it will get better and it is worth all your work. My best wishes and Blessings go out to you!|`|7a6fa7cc2f844989fcfae1cb4372f24baa	I did go through one session with a therapist of EMDR.  It was retraumatizing to me.  I am sorry, but I did not like it.  I would never do it again, and I had to find another therapist.  You are placed back into the event or events that caused you PTSD.  I swear, I have been in therapy for years, and I believe EMDR is the biggest psychobabble type stuff I have experienced.

3a1781e7f865db79836a5eacd159123caa	I was over at a friend's house and he was leaving to go work.  He told me to hang out because he only had to work for a few hours.  So I was watching tv when his older sister strolled through in a two piece bikini.  I was stunned and eyeballed her all the way.  She noticed me staring at her and suddenly turned around.  I was so nervous, but I maintained my stare.  She asked,"do you like what you see?" and I almost lost it, but I kept it together.  She approached me and proceeded to lay on top of me and I couldn't control my emotions.  She slid her hand down my pants and began to rub my cock...I couldn't believe it.  She kissed my neck, chest, and lips while rubbing me down.    All of a sudden she jumped up and walked to her bedroom only to come out two minutes late completely naked.  I was stunned again and began to think it was a dream.  She was still covered in suntan oil and smelled like a coconut, which sent me into another level of nirvana.  She laid on top of me again and began to show me her experiences.  Needless to say I was her prisoner, but I was happy to be so.    It's a memorable thing when your first time happens, but when your best friend's sister plays it...nothing else makes a better fantasy.|`|805a638a93956d98d0f84275d00c033faa	dear search on google for a story  or call me i will turn you on.|`|6e51a8fc3b975d0c55ae87b5afb6d8a9aa	A girl sits alone, wishing for excitement.  She thinks about her best female freind.  She decided to call her up one day to just hang out and they did.  But she decided to herself that her best friend was more than just someone to hang out with.  She coulnd't help but be attracted to her sexually.  Not wanting to feel too akward, she casually approached her friend and wanted to ask if she could kiss her.  To her amazement, her friend accepted the kiss, that soon ignited into touching and feeling and grabbing.  They started to kiss so much that they were completely nude, and started doing it all.  They exchanged saliva, and began to sweat while feeling each other and became so aroused, that they just couldn't stop.

AA11970345	Going to the GYN for the first time is very scary but if the Doc is good he/she will sit down and talk to you first before the exam.    1.  You will go into a room and you will need to take all your cloths off and put on a gown can be either paper or a real gown and they will give you a sheet to cover your legs the gown will need to be put on with the opening to the front.  2.  the doc will ask you to lay back and will examin your breast (breast exam).  3.  next the doc will ask you to put your feet in the stirrups and bring your butt all the way to the edge of the table.  at this point your legs are going to lock up and close.  Take a deep breath and relax.  the doc will bring a light close to you so he/she can see the outter portion for any leasions, or anything out of the ordinary  4. doc will use a speculum it looks like a duck's bill and will insert in your vagina to visualize your cervix and get a scraping to send to the lab for analysis for cervical cancer.  5. the doc will take the speculum out and then insert 2 fingers and press on your pubic bone and and sides to feel the uterus and ovaries for any massess, then the doc will ask if you have any questions, the vast majority of doctors will explain what they are doing before they do it and you will have one of their assistants in the room.  I usually joke around with my Gyn and tell him he owes me dinner after the exam, that usually gets a great chuckle out of the two of us I get very nervouse but after you have been going to the same one you will feel more comfortable with that doc.  If you have any questions write them down and bring it with you because I can guarantee you will have questions and when the doc ask if you have any questions your mind will go blank.|`|AA10102392	http://www.intelihealth.com/IH/ihtIH/WSP...     I was a little nervous my first time too. Don't be. Read the link I gave you and you'll know what to expect.    I guess I was a little embarassed, but then I realized that the doctor and the nurses do this for a living. They aren't there to judge me or my body. They see a lot of women, so it's routine for them.     Good luck and don't be scared. :-)|`|AA12245455	Well, the tech is going to take your blood pressure, and maybe draw blood for an iron test.  They will need some family history.  You'll be asked to undress and put on a gown.  Feet into the stirrups, butt to the edge of the table.  Then they will slide a lubricated speculum inside you.  You'll feel like you have to fart.  Take some deep breaths.  Now, your gyno will do a pap smear (they take a sample from your cervix, and prep a slide for the lab) then do a pelvic and a breast exam.  A good gyno can do this all quickly without freaking you out.  You get dressed, meet with your doc, discuss issues, and then leave.  Tell him or her it's your first visit, and they'll be extra patient and explain it all to you.  A nurse will be in the room, too, if you have a male gyno.  It may suck, but trust me, having cervical cancer early in life will suck way worse.  Especially if left undetected.

On a l'impression de parler mais il para?t que les autres n'entendent pas.   Pendant le coma profond: rien, aucun souvenir.  Quand je suis sortie du coma, c'tait dans le mme ordre: on entend, on sent que quelqu'un te touche, on voit, on se rendor, on se rveille chaque fois un peu plus.  Pas de peur ni de frayeur, c'est presque agrable, on a l'impression de fondre doucement.  par contre aprs, c'est long de retrouver la force musculaire et les capacits intellectuelles, c'est pour ?a que je suis sur Yahoo, et c'est grace  vous tous que je me soigne, MERCI!

Probably, your hormones have changed because of your dieting, and that's what's making you lose your period. Don't be worried yet, sometimes you skip a period because your body doesn't build up the lining cause your hormones chemicals have changed.

I have also read that they arrange financing for american and canadian patients as obesity surgery is not covered by insurance.They also have photos pasted of their International patients.You can checkout their website.The cost savings are incredible.As a doctor i personally believe that your obesity surgery can be easily handled in India as the quality of healthcare available here is simply best in the world.The surgeons are USA/UK trained and facilities are 5 star.    My cousin got her revision surgery for gastric bypass in India through the forerunners healthcare .She is more than very happy with the results.She has lost 65lbs in 5 months.She just paid 25% of the amount she was quoted in USA and is all praise for this forerunners healthcare company.hope this helps     I dont think so--that Mexico can ever match upto the standards of India in healthcare--you should get it in India!|`|1663d36c69d6a09ccc02f265a3954704aa	Neither!!!!

Its actually very easy to lose weight if you follow my weight loss tips.          * Be in right frame of mind        Before you can start any diet program you need to be in the right frame of mind. If you do not feel good about yourself you probably will not want to choose healthy foods. You cannot expect the act of going on a diet to make you feel better about yourself. The only way you can choose to eat a healthy diet to lose weight is if you have a positive self-image.        * Eat whole food        Top weight loss tips        Eat whole foods that are as natural as possible. When you eat whole foods that are full of nutrients your body will know how much to eat and how much not to eat. You do not have to count calories because your body is a wonderful machine.        * Eat fresh fruit        Eat at least two servings of fresh fruit every day. Choose whatever type of fruit is in season.        * Drink enough water        Drink the best weight loss supplement known to man, water. Most people do not know the difference from being hungry for food or thirsty for water. A great deal of times people eat when they should drink. Most likely you will not feel as hungry if you are getting enough water. You will be satisfying the thirst, which is confused for hunger. Water also helps you digest food better. Drinking water before you eat will help fill you up.        * Always chew your food        Always chew your food well. Chewing your food well will ensure that you get the most nutrients out of your food. Getting the most nutrients will satisfy your body therefore you will eat less. Another benefit of chewing well is that it helps aid in digestion.        * Take small meals        Eat small, frequent meals in a day. Large meals tax your digestion system, making it work harder. Taking too much time in between meals makes you hungrier for the next meal.        * Include protein at meal        Include good sources of protein at meal, chicken, fish, legumes, peanut, cottage cheese, eggs or yogurt.        * Shut off TV while eating        Shut off the TV whenever you eat  that includes meals and snacks. Studies show that we automatically eat larger portions when we snack in front of the tube, and typically those foods are high in fat and sugar, which means excess calories!        * Increase your physical activity        Increase your physical activity. Most people are over weight because of a lack of physical activity. Start walking more, bicycling, walks your dog for longer periods of time, swim, dance and leave the car at home when you can. Its important that you choose a physical activity that you enjoy because youll stick with it.|`|cafd10a1b5cae3271c2e9fcf24a478a6aa	Stop drinking sodas and eating candy and you will lose a several pounds quickly.|`|631cd8d7fd3700f5e9b174df502a42acaa	if you are only 13, the fastest way to lose weight would be to join a school or intramural sports team.  isn't soccer season right around the corner?  that's a great way to lose weight.    aside from that be careful of what you eat, stick to natural fruits and vegetables and lay off the soda and candy.  i know that's almost impossible to ask from a teenager, but it's true.|`|AA11643803	your only 13.  you shouldnt even be worrying about your weight at this age.  if you want you can either exercise more or eat less.  please dont try anything else because it might effect your growth process.|`|459ed6559163c6157adf60e402be1671aa	Hi  Try this simple plan it really works so here goes,  If you are serious about losing weight, the calories in the food you eat should be less than the energy you use.

b254fbd12552d16a4dc2affc7e498168aa	Ahh she wants to know about the "busting of the cherry" LOL    Yes it is VERY true. Sure you can have oral, or make out, or feel....But a woman only loses her "purity" when a man enters her thru intercourse. To me....it's somewhat of a spiritual thing when a female is still a virgin. I wish I had kept mine longer. You may feel dirty when it happens to you. I know I did. I didn't feel right for a long time, until I had sex again to get use to the feeling. You HAVE to be sure you're ready for intercourse. That's very important. It's YOUR decision. Never the mans. Also...play it safe and use protection.    AND, little girl, if you haven't had intercourse yet, you should know about the hymen:    Your hymen breaks from your first time at intercourse. For some girls, it can be pain full and may even cause a little bleeding. The penis is basically breaking thru a thin layer of skin, blocking your vaginal entrance from the labia minora(inner lips)....Hence the hymen. Fortunately for me I didn't have that problem because some females have a  hymen that is already open (or annular). So for a good while I never understood what the term "busting your cherry" meant LOL There are a few different forms in which the hymen will look like    I know a friend who is pushing 30 and she has not had intercourse yet because her hymen is completely blocked(or parous intriotus). So she knows its gonna hurt when it happens. I'm sure there is a way for women to have their hymens surgically opened/removed......but that just sucks. For more information on the Hymen click on the link in my "Source List" ....You also get images.

Either way, a 10Kg increase (or 10Kg loss) of weight in a month is not really a good thing to have happen.    You would want to eat a lot of carbs (potatoes, pasta etc). This will help put on weight.     If you really want to do it, I would speak to a dietitian first. They can help develop an eating plan that will allow you to put on weight, but not create serious health issues for yourself.|`|52a72c13f1f4252c9b68736816ce8902aa	French Fries..Burgers..

53d559d94c3498c23ff6f7c12123d00faa	Fiction.    The sad truth is, fat loss isn't easy. You'll read it in tons of magazines, websites, etc. True fat loss requires dedication in a number of matters: change of lifestyle, how you eat, what you eat, when you eat, which activities you get involved in, how you exercise, when you exercise, etc. but the simple truth is, there's no simple solution. When you see one offered, run away like there's a big ribeye attached to your butt and a dozen dogs chasing you!    On a related note, Green Tea may be your best bet if you want to "aid" your fat loss efforts. Supposably it helps your metabolism and is overall a healthy tea. Also, try Yerba Mate from South America, it also helps with metabolism but not a lot of people like the taste.     And lastly, good luck!|`|AA11599588	it could be either one since in history there have been over whieght japanise people.|`|AA12060157	Fiction!|`|34c2f81d13e7ceca35d1932c0624bd8daa	fiction|`|AA12109056	Fiction.

Stay away from those--while oolong or wu long or whatever you like to call it will never be harmful, your average weight loss tea can be. Those usually work by being strong diuretics and laxatives, so you'll drop a lot of water weight quickly, but not only will you have to deal with problems related to dehydration, many of them can mess up your digestive system irrevocably. Cutting out fats and sweets and switching to non-soda drinks (which tea can help you do!), plus getting out for a walk every so often is a much healthier--and effective--method."

Also, go to the book store and locate the book "Weight Training for Dummies". In chapter 15 you will find excellent information on how to perform abdominal exercises correctly. Page 218 of the book dispels all the myths surrounding abdominal training.    The following healthy living recommendations will help you if youre trying to lose weight, tone up your muscles, have aspirations of building lean muscle mass, are attempting to get a wash board stomach, or just want to feel better:    *1) Burn more calories then you're consuming everyday and measure your results using the following formula: Calories Consumed minus Basal Metabolic Rate (BMR) minus Physical Activity. Get a diet and fitness calculator that you can put on your computer or cell phone. This will allow you to easily calculate this formula, set goals, log your daily calorie consumption, and register your physical activities.    *2) Eat natural and organic foods found on earth versus something created by a corporation to make money. Eat meals in small portions throughout the day and take a good multi-vitamin supplement.     Avoid High Glycemic Load Carbs (sugar, pastries, desserts, refined starches such as breads, pasta, refined grains like white rice; high starch vegetables such as white potatoes) and drink lots of water.     Do not try fad diets or diet pills. Here is an excellent food pyramid that anyone can follow: http://www.rayandterry.com/html/images/P...    *3) Exercise on most days by doing cardiovascular training and/or resistance training activities.     Read a book or find a certified trainer to make sure your doing all resistance training exercises correctly. A great book to buy that teaches you the resistance training basics is Weight Training for Dummies. A superb magazine to buy with resistance training routines that will not get you bored is "Muscle and Fitness". Signup for the free newsletter. An excellent free online resource is at http://www.exrx.net/    A good book to buy that teaches you the cardiovascular training basics is Fitness for Dummies.     *4) Get plenty of sleep. Sleep experts say most adults need between seven and nine hours of sleep each night for optimum performance, health, and safety.     *5) Educate yourself continually on health issues and make a life long commitment to good health. A great free publication is Dietary Guidelines for Americans 2005. A superb book to read is You The Owners Manual. An excellent periodic publication is the Nutrition Action Health Letter. A reputable test you can take to measure your biological age is at http://realage.com    Look at all areas where you can enhance your health. For example, make improvements in the quality of the air you breathe. Review outdoor air quality forecasts where you live and get an indoor air purifier.

qyqxp4abaa	Everybody's half-right and everybody's half-wrong.  The extent of the disc damage and arthritic inflammation will determine the course of treatment, and opiates are one option.  My diagnosis started pretty much as yours, and I depended on a compassionate orthopedist for years to keep it in check with low doses of vicodin.  I found a pain management specialist who spent 90 minutes looking at my films and found fractures and bone spurs that a dozen other docs missed.

You will need to take them all of your records and then let them determine what the appropriate treatment for that condition may be.  You need to be willing to accept that they may not be willing to treat it with Narcotics.  That is their call.  That is the only legal way to get this treated the way you think that it needs to be treated.  Other than that, maybe Mexico, but that's illegal and I know I would not want to spend time in a Mexican jail for trying to bring narcotics back into the US.|`|3meIiIsmaa	Dude-Vicodin is not the answer to chronic back pain - you need to see a orthopedic surgeon - a friend of mine had been in pain for 6 months-and had laproscopic surgery on her back for a herniated disk - and is going back to work Mon(2 weeks post op) - You are drug-shopping, not looking for a permanent pain relief.

You claim you dont care about having an ED then why are 15-20% of the questions you asked about ED or food? Get help if you have an ED and personally i think 14yr old 5'3" and 105 pounds is healthy and not the average size of someone with an ED. If you really want to cure yourself try paying for your own food. Once you notice all your money going down the toilet you might catch on to why your mom is acting like she is.

It's the best thing for you to do really, I don't see any other solution unless you want to give speaking to her another chance.

5d7e9df6ebacef8fcc5d4ae8bbd28ed7aa	Estimada amiguita, lo normal es, una veziniciada la menarquia, ovular mes tras mes. Durante este ciclo el utero prepara un colchoncito en su pared interior, llamada endometrio, que es donde se implanta el ovula ya fecundado (claro, si tienes contacto sexual) y ahi se anida para crecer el bebe. Si no tienes vida sexual activa aun, este endometrio se cae en forma de menstruacion. Y el ciclo normal debe ser regular, habitualmente de 28 dias con duracion de la menstruacion de 3 dias. Aunque puede variar hasta de 24 a 35 dias el ciclo con una duracion de 7 dias de regla. Si tienes muchos colicos y manchas demasiado o muchos dias mejor acude a tu ginecologo pues debemos descartar algun problema asociado. Mucha suerte amiguita.|`|V14Lg8Ahaa	Si cada mes te llega la menstruación al día 14 es tu día ferial de cada mes, por eso es mejor empezar a cuidarse o abstenerse de tener relaciones desde el día 12 al 18 contando a partir de que tienes tu primer día de menstruación, o sea te baja hoy 14 de nov. entonces entraras al periodo de ovulacion el día 26 de nov, a partir de este día hasta el 2 de diciembre es mejor no tener sexo, porque saldrías embarazada, si has notado a la mitad de tu periodo tienes un desecho semi liquido transparente como clara de huevo, es cuando tu cuerpo te esta indicando que estas ovulando, te recomiendo anotes en un calendario personal el día que te baja y de ahí cuentas 12 días y estarás ovulando 6 días mas, bueno mas fácil has tu pregunta poniendo que día te llego tu menstruación y te podremos decir cuales son tus días fertiles, tienes 17 a?os porque no esperar algunos a?os mas por lo regular con el primero que lo haces no se casa contigo, a esa edad uno cree que sin el uno se muere de amor y no recuerda besaras a muchos sapos para conseguir a tu príncipe azul, y quizás te arrepientas después el no haber esperado y guardado tu primera vez para ese príncipe, que Dios te bendiga cualquiera que sea tu desicion.

c1b57351247d7aa491e18027ac258d45aa	Yes absolutely. Your question isn't really clear. Some people have too much thyroid and some too little. Probably, if you are having irregular periods you are talking about too little thyroid hormone. It's really important you talk to your OB about the thyroid issues.     But- good new is ABSOLUTELY seen many healthy babies of mom's with thyroid problems. Most thyroid issues are very treatable! But if you are trying to get pregant you need to clarify what the issue is, and your doctor will want to be sure your thyroid levels are in normal range when you get pregnant and while you are pregnant.  Abnormal thyroid ( not treated ) can definitely be associated with problems for mom and baby but most of the time doctors can adjust and monitor the thyroid levels so they are ideal in pregnancy.|`|AA10891466	It could since it affects your periods.  If you haven't done so, you should get your thryroid on medicine to normalize the levels.   If not, you'll regret it, because thyroid disease causes alot more other health problems. IE:  Irregular periods, high cholesterol levels, liver problems.

GqdEfuo8aa	Wow! Good for you! Skipping the soda and drinking milk and water is FANTASTIC. That will definitely help. Milk is amazing for your body. I would suggest Skim milk, but if you don't like it, 1% is excellent as well. <br>  I'm also happy to hear you say that you're still eating 3 meals a day- that means you're losing weight in a healthy way. 3 pounds in one week is a lot- don't be discouraged if that drops a little as you gain muscle. 1-2 pounds a week is a healthy weight loss rate.<br>  I would definitely say you're on your way to a healthy weight. If anything, maybe exercise even more! Find something fun that you can keep motivated with. Keep it up!!! |`|4bdde9178c8efb711e698a637baf18ddaa	Wow this is great.  This is a great start.

Keep going the way you are going!  Dont lose motivation!|`|B0EdMXXXaa	your doing great!!! i am 140 and hope to lose 20 more but that sounds like what i do. i used to eat a lot!!! no i eat 6 times a day with 100-300 calories in each thing.this is my diet if it helps any.<br>  breakfast: cereal and milk=250 cal<br>  snack:apple=100cal<br>  lunch: any kind of sandwich or soup=300-400cal<br>  snack:carrots or any vegetable=200cal<br>  dinner: healthy choice frozen dinner=300-400cal<br>  dessert: a tiny piece of sweetness=100cal<br>  <br>  Now this =bout 1100-1200 cal a day and for me that's just right. i exercise a lot like 2 hours everyday but broken into half hour segments. congrats!!!|`|hK0fOCCyaa	This is definately an improvement over how you were living, congrats!<br>  <br>  No alcohol is great too - its sooo loaded with calories. <br>  <br>  You should try to work up to working out 1 hour a day. That is really what your body needs to start transforming. I would give it a couple weeks and change that 20 min to 30 min. Then do that for a couple weeks and change 30 min to 45 and so on until you can hit an hour. <br>  <br>  Also, although milk is good for you - you really shouldn't drink more than a glass a day and make sure it's at least 2%. <br>  <br>  The best advice a trainer ever gave me that really amped my weight loss was "Don't worry about how many calories you eat in a day. Just eat every 3-5 hours and keep it under 500 calories each time"<br>  <br>  Hope that helps!|`|AdfxeIJqaa	Sounds like you're off to a great start!  Make sure you are getting all of the food groups: 2-3 servings of protein (lean!...no ham or other pork, very little beef), 2-3 servings of fruit, 5 or more servings of veggies (this is the only category where you can basically have as much of it as you want), 4 servings of WHOLE GRAIN carbs (like "crunchy" bread...7 grain or more, whole grain cereal, pasta, brown rice, etc), 2 servings of nonfat dairy per day.  Good for you staying drug/alcohol free!<br>  <br>  Oh, yes, I almost forgot, make sure you exercise nearly every day (which you're doing), but don't neglect your muscles.  Try to do strength training every other day.  IT will help you develop lean muscle, which will help you have a faster metabolism!  I'm a believer!!!<br>  <br>  As I said before, it sounds like you're doing it right.  Just remember, if you have a dessert or other fattening thing, just have a small, tiny portion of it.  Don't deprive yourself.  And remember, food is temporary.  In 30 minutes, you won't taste it any more, but you will be sorry you overate, right?<br>  <br>  Good luck~|`|m1Yr8EMAaa	sounds like you are doing everything perfectly! Keep up the good work. You will live much longer this way, and be free of diseases like cardiovascular disease and diabetes.|`|LmicIEOxaa	Terrific. This is a wonderful plan. You need a bit more exercise on a daily basis however. Add squats, crunches and push-ups.

IM3QwSS2aa	I went on a similar one (like those ads in something you order), the tea, the pills and the powder.  The pills (horse size) but endured anyway. The tea, recommendation from company, drink off 1 bag like 2 or 3 times.  The Powder, oh don't get me started with that powder. I mixed it, shook it in the bottle, hand-blended it.  Did not like the taste, end up putting in my compost bin.<br>  <br>  Overall, the price was way high.  Better off with OTC brands.  The powder should have been put in pill form.  The KEY to those is the Benonite (sp?) Clay.  <br>  <br>  <br>  Earlier on this site I asked how does one know a colon kit has worked?  I mean yeah, I'm seeing myself go to the bathroom more, the looseness of the fecal matter. But how can I know it's getting rid of those parasites?  May I look in the doctor's  colon microscope and see the cleanness?Do they work?  It's hard to tell.
ZNbauLJzaa	I am not a doctor, but there is a simple test you can do at home.  You can buy ketone sticks at the pharmacy.  Have her pee on one.  If it changes colors it indicated ketones in her urine which is a symptom of undiagnosed diabetes.  If it changes colors, you MUST take her to the emergency room.  Ketoacidosis is serious.  You can buy these ketone sticks without a prescription.  There are other reagent strips that can test for sugar in the urine, that you may be able to buy as well.  These are what diabetics used prior to glucometers.  If this test shows high, it is also a bad symptom.  <br>  You have a rotten doctor.  He should have done urine and blood tests.  They are quick and extremely useful.|`|307e0819ddf76baa2377bbb05200b6e3aa	<br>  Change your doctor. Any doctor who does not attend to a sick child immediately is not good in my books. you daughter needs attention now not after the weekend.<br>   You might want to take her to the hospital.

If they do a normal finger test they will most likely give her fluids, and possibly some insulin to take her blood sugar down until they do the tests to confirm it. <br>  <br>  DO NOT WAIT especially if you see she is getting sicker by the day. she needs a doctor NOW! i know from personal experience of a friend who's mom just thought it was the flu until she came home and found her daughter in a coma from her blood sugar being so high (they found out her blood sugar when she had to be air lifted to the hospital)...true story<br>  <br>  this is serious and can be FATAL...too many people have died or ended up in comas because they didn't get help soon enough. even if it turns out not to be diabetes...it's better to be safe than sorry<br>  <br>  I'm sorry you have to go thru this. Good Luck!<br>  <br>  |`|pRF5LLloaa	He maybe should have done more tests, but the "instant blood sugar test" is no longer a reliable method of diagnosing diabetes.<br>  <br>  the problem is, even a severely  uncontrolled diabetic will read NORMAL sometimes, and a normal person will read high sometimes.  The "instant blood sugar test" is responsible for too many false positive AND false negative -- ie: misdiagnosis.<br>  <br>  The BEST test to take is the A1C test.  This test take an AVERAGE of your blood sugars of the last 90 days.  You do not have to fast to take this test.<br>  <br>  Since it takes an average, and no fasting is involved, false diagnosis are almost completely eliminated.<br>  <br>  WHY the doctor did not do an A1C test is unknown,  Maybe it is not covered under the NHS.  That is extremely unfortunate.<br>  <br>  If your daughter does not get better quickly, maybe you should visit an emergency room????|`|aXnVFFUkaa	if she becomes ill take her to hospital, you might get some tests done then.

In general, symptoms and signs that suggest a rise in ICP including headache, nausea, vomiting, ocular palsies, altered level of consciousness, back pain and papilledema. If papilledema is protracted, it may lead to visual disturbances, optic atrophy, and eventually blindness.

I had one so bad the lady at the hospital wanted to take out my appendix! she thought it had exploded, but it turned out to be a uti. here's my suggestion, ok?  1. go get a washcloth, get it damp, and put it in the microwave for 15-30 seconds. put it over the pain and lay on the opposite side of the body.  2. check your temp. if your running over 102.1, call a doctor asap.  drink lots of water, it cleans out your system and can flush any serious toxins.  3. if you've been sitting for a while, get up and stretch a little.  4. take some naproxem sodium. it's in Aleve. it's like Ibuprofen, but better for you.  5. if none of this helps and you are in extremely bad pain, call the hospital and ask them about what to do.  if you need anthing, Email me, k?

hyGSMcIyaa	There are some basic exercises that can really help. Lie on the floor on your stomach. Hold your arms out above your head and arch your back, lifting your arms and legs up, holding that position for about ten to fifteen seconds. Rest for ten seconds. Then do it two more times. Do that every day, and you should not have more back tightness. If you do, then do it once in the morning and once in the evening for a week.|`|AA11824688	Try leaning back on something e.g. a swivel chair. Make it go lower and stay in that position with your back staright.<br>  <br>  Make sure when you sleep at night, you sleep on your sides, not your back or your stomach as these positions weaken the muscles of your back and organs. <br>  <br>  Lastly, get a good back massage with black seed oil or olive oil (warmed). This should help tone your back and releive pain and get rid of toxins.<br>  <br>  When you stand, make sure you stand with a starught back; have your chest out and up and arms on the hips when standing (not walking).<br>  <br>  Hope this helps!!!|`|Osq4OHQUaa	1 word: Chiropractor. <br>  <br>  They saved my life!|`|cf3b4c9a1788b436ca969afa64100affaa	Try Wii Fit.

RzBpUZaoaa	I can only speak from my experience on this (not documented medical fact):<br>  <br>  Yeah, it seems to me that your body can get "used to" a particular brand of pill.  Several times now, I have had to switch BC because I would end up spotting more and more in a downward spiral.  It could be that it is not sufficiently effective at this point, there is no way to say.  But I suspect if you had an ultrasound, you were having some little issues then too.  So yeah, I concur with your observation.<br>  <br>  Another thing, so obviously I have no idea what you weigh, but these low dose BCP don't work so well on heavier girls.  So you may need a BCP adjustment for that reason.<br>  <br>  I have often thought that maybe you could "reset" your body by going off of BCP for a month or two.  If you aren't currently having sex, you could try it and see.  I do rather suspect this would work because apparently you can spot as a result of too much or too little progesterone.  So if it is too much, then taking a break would help you.<br>  <br>  Good luck.|`|b460841548d6022f16992e6a4ac071c6aa	Go to a free clinic, they may not be as friendly as a regular doctor but spotting for so many days is not normal, go see see  free clinic doctor, look one up for your area.|`|6W4LrKNRaa	It is not a good option to take the pills for such a long time and spotting is completely normal.

Maybe you could switch to something else for a while and give your body a break.

8f000350e6b7497a6d3e30250383038baa	I'd suggest a consistent routine.  Check out Muscle and Fitness or Bodybuilding.com and find a rotation that you like.  You might want to do 4 weeks of a progressively heavier rotation with less reps and follow that up with a 6 week high rep/lighter weight rotation.  Your key is consistency, diet and supplementing with some cardio.

d6cbd4f49a6660cc733a0b7ea8151199aa	You basically listed so many possible things, who really knows? <br>  <br>  Herpes can take years to show up or weeks. He could have had herpes and either not known or knew but didn't tell you. Condoms are not necessairly effective for skin isses. Genital warts, crabs and Herpes are not prevented with condoms. <br>  <br>  I doubt it's the birth control because of the concentration in one area.

Q7PkaNSOaa	The bump is normal.  After a few months it should almost disappear as long as you took care of the piercing properly when it was fresh.  The bump will gradually get smaller over time and eventually go away but for now, you're kind of stuck with it. Sorry!<br>  <br>  I have my lip pierced and have a friend who did as well.  She had to take hers out when she was taking CNA classes and doing clinicals, and this was a few months ago.  You can't even tell she had her lip pierced anymore.|`|drzN1kkuaa	Its probably a keliod, I had that when I took out my industrial peircing.

Dik3PH6gaa	I"m no expert but I have SUFFERED with C.F.S for over eight years (long before it was accepted as a "real illness"). I do know that it manifests   different ways at different times even with the same person.  Because it is an immune disorder, that they  now are discovering may have to do with the way the cells in your body produce energy ,it disrupts the functions of your entire body!  Many people with this also have Irritable Bowel Syndrome.  To answer your question specifically..Yes!  I pray you do not have this illness as it is so misunderstood by  everyone including  the professionals ".  You have many of the symptoms, however ,diagnosis  is usually determined by  a lack of any other illness that would produce these symptoms.  If your Dr. thinks it is  E.D.S., most likely it  is.  However, by the fact you are asking this  question you my not be overly confident in your Dr.'s opinion.  That is O. K. too.  Be pro- active with you health care. Start by researching your illness.  I have finally found a good Dr.  who sent me to the inter net.  Search for nuero immune disorders.   N I D was founded by a Dr. who's wife has the disorder.  He may help you understand.  Again , I hope it is something else ,anything else is better than this!  P. S.  Tender points are usually associated with fybromyalgia|`|AA10481903	Your history of onset of symptoms following an intestinal illness makes complete sense.  A lot of scientific research in this area (I was just reading some of these papers last night!) indicate that CFS types of problems often develop after a gut illness and result from Intestinal Hyperpermeability (a Leaky Gut) that developed from the inflammation in the gut present during the illness period.<br>  <br>  If your doctor is truly knowledgeable in this area, he/she would have already tested you for a Leaky Gut.  If he/she hasn't tested you, that tells you something!<br>  <br>  Additionally, gluten intolerance (Celiac Disease) is a "spectrum disorder" - that means there is a wide range of immune sensitivity and individualized response to gluten.  The fact that you have shown ANY abnormal lab finding in this area, would suggest to me that a trial period (30 to 90 days) of absolute gluten/gliadin avoidance would be a reasonable test to see if you improve.<br>  <br>  You clearly have malabsorption issues - which strongly indicate significant gut/digestive dysfunction.  And, that is totally consistent with the development of CFS and related auto-immune disorders.  The key to treatment is to heal the gut.<br>  <br>  Below are several links to relevant scientific papers.  You may want to print copies and take them to your doc.  You may also want to find a doc (maybe a Naturopathic Physician or Certified Clinical Nutritionist or medical doctor trained in "functional medicine") with more knowledge about the underlying pathophysiologies in CFS and related conditions.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/sites/entrez?orig_db=PubMed&db=pubmed&cmd=Search&term=%22Neuro%20endocrinology%20letters%22[Jour]%20AND%20902[page]%20AND%202008[pdat]" rel="nofollow">http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/sites/entrez...</a><br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17007934?ordinalpos=1&itool=EntrezSystem2.PEntrez.Pubmed.Pubmed_ResultsPanel.Pubmed_DiscoveryPanel.Pubmed_Discovery_RA&linkpos=1&log$=relatedarticles&logdbfrom=pubmed" rel="nofollow">http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17007...</a><br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.ima.org.il/imaj/ar08jan-21.pdf" rel="nofollow">http://www.ima.org.il/imaj/ar08jan-21.pd...</a><br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19127706?ordinalpos=1&itool=EntrezSystem2.PEntrez.Pubmed.Pubmed_ResultsPanel.Pubmed_DiscoveryPanel.Pubmed_Discovery_RA&linkpos=2&log$=relatedarticles&logdbfrom=pubmed" rel="nofollow">http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19127...</a><br>  <br>  Best wishes and good luck.|`|hyjZ6jSBaa	You could try seeing an allergy person (nutritionist that diagnoses allergies...dont know what the proper term is)<br>  <br>  im not sure where you live , but in south wales theres a man who treats ME , he deserves a medal , <br>  <br>  his theory is about supressed emotions , and it makes your immune system work SO hard , like over-time.

0TT5q0cUaa	The discharge of semen through the penis during sleep usually as a result of erotic dreams is called nocturnal emission. It is also called wet dreams or night falls. When a young man experiences a nocturnal emission, he gets quite a shock. If the person is ignorant of the normal sexual process, he will be bewildered at what is happening to him and may turn to bogus literature on sex or to quacks for an answer. Misinformation may result in sexual problems.<br>  <br>  Wet dreams are quite natural. No physical or mental harm can come from them. They need not and cannot be curbed. They do not require any treatment. It is not just boys who get these wet dreams. Even girls and women can have erotic dreams as a result of pent-up sexual desires, which may lead to orgasms during sleep.|`|TELl62yKaa	no no no its simple no hair fall can be for other reason but for sure its not due to night fall honey dont worry..|`|2aab9990f44abc785cfb7c119b182bdeaa	its all rubbish<br>  night fall is just excreation of waste by nature|`|15EjSfH3aa	no yaar, its just hell created by foolish persons|`|UdoLcwm4aa	I would say no.|`|ptMhmKjnaa	this is an absolutely wrong myth that hair lose due to night fall|`|g6pqGjrkaa	Not at all.

It's just as hard to gain weight as it is to lose it!    First, I would talk to a doctor just to make sure that you don't have a thyroid problem. Also ask the doctor about drinking protein shakes.  Those help by adding muscle so that you're not gaining so much weight in fat.  You might want to increase portion size, but in a healthy way.  Again, a doctor would be a good one to suggest how.  Good luck!
f7d33c04a72a7226a9f74dd65f7f929faa	The following healthy living recommendations will help you if youre trying to lose weight, tone up your muscles, have aspirations of building lean muscle mass, are attempting to get a wash board stomach, or just want to feel better:    *1) Burn more calories then you're consuming everyday and measure your results using the following formula: Calories Consumed minus Basal Metabolic Rate (BMR) minus Physical Activity. Get a fitness calculator that you can put on your cell phone and computer. This will allow you to easily calculate this formula, log your daily calorie consumption, and register your physical activities.    *2) Eat natural and organic foods found on earth versus something created by a corporation to make money. Eat meals in small portions throughout the day and take a good multi-vitamin supplement.     Avoid High Glycemic Load Carbs (sugar, pastries, desserts, refined starches such as breads, pasta, refined grains like white rice; high starch vegetables such as white potatoes) and drink lots of water.     Do not try fad diets or diet pills. Here is an excellent food pyramid that anyone can follow: http://www.rayandterry.com/html/images/P...    *3) Exercise on most days by doing cardiovascular training and/or resistance training activities.     Read a book or find a certified trainer to make sure your doing all resistance training exercises correctly. A great book to buy that teaches you the resistance training basics is Weight Training for Dummies. A superb magazine to buy with excellent resistance training routines that will not get you bored is "Muscle and Fitness". Signup for the free newsletter.    A good book to buy that teaches you the cardiovascular training basics is Fitness for Dummies.     *4) Get plenty of sleep. Sleep experts say most adults need between seven and nine hours of sleep each night for optimum performance, health, and safety.     *5) Educate yourself continually on health issues and make a life long commitment to good health. A great free publication is Dietary Guidelines for Americans 2005. A superb book to read is You The Owners Manual. An excellent periodic publication is the Nutrition Action Health Letter.

I lost 80 pounds of fat and gained 20 pounds of muscle in 5.5 months!    If you are looking to diet, read below.    Do not make a high goal, first of all. It's a health risk to lose more than 3 pounds a week. Besides, that much in a week would probably be water weight, which comes right back.    Try taking a walk for 30 minutes a day, adding 10 minutes each week. Once you get up to an hour long walk, start biking or running for 20 minutes a day, adding on minutes once again. By the time you are biking for an hour a day, just keep at it and you'll keep losing.    Remember to EAT YOUR BREAKFAST. Eating Breakfast will reduce your hunger and increase your energy throughtout the day. You should have a large breakfast, smaller lunch, and light dinner. Or you can have multiple small meals throughout the day. Avoid snacking at night, and when you really want junk food, eat a half serving and substitute the other half with a fruit or veggie. Make sure you drink water too, it's helpful in losing weight faster. Be sure to lay off soda...it's high in cals.|`|c3e2b4a98cc5c8176034e458502ba066aa	South Beach. It is not an expensive book, and doesn't really feel like a diet--more like a lifestyle. You lose weight slowly (about 2 lbs per week), but it stays off.

The PT will help decrease pain, correct the alignment, and improve your flexibility / strength to hold your pelvis in proper alignment.    My only other concern is if you had an XRAY.

f7d33c04a72a7226a9f74dd65f7f929faa	Please do not try diet pills because they are not the long term answer and many can cause negative health effects. Consider a healthy lifestyle change.    The following healthy living recommendations will help you if youre trying to lose weight, tone up your muscles, have aspirations of building lean muscle mass, are attempting to get a wash board stomach, or just want to feel better:    *1) Burn more calories then you're consuming everyday and measure your results using the following formula: Calories Consumed minus Basal Metabolic Rate (BMR) minus Physical Activity minus the Thermic Effect of Food (TEF). A website that explains this formula in more detail and will help you determine how many calories you need to reach or maintain a certain weight is at http://www.primusweb.com/fitnesspartner/...    Get an online, desktop, or cell phone diet and fitness calculator. This will allow you to easily calculate the above formula, set goals, log your daily calorie consumption, and register your physical activities.     Set realistic goals for your ideal body weight. Here are two websites that will calculate a suggested body weight:          Adults: http://www.halls.md/ideal-weight/body.ht...  Teens/Children: http://www.kidshealth.org/kid/exercise/w...    It is difficult and unhealthy to lose more than one or two pounds per week. There are 3,500 calories in a pound. If you eat 500 fewer calories per day for a week you will lose one pound. If you burn through exercise 500 more calories per day for a week you will lose one pound.     Here are two articles on how to break through a weight loss plateau:  http://www.webmd.com/content/article/86/...  http://www.webmd.com/content/pages/18/10...    *2) Eat natural and organic foods found on earth versus something created by a corporation to make money. Eat meals in small portions throughout the day and take a good multi-vitamin supplement.     Do not try fad diets or diet pills. Avoid High Glycemic Load Carbs (sugar, pastries, desserts, refined starches such as breads, pasta, refined grains like white rice; high starch vegetables such as potatoes) and drink lots of water.

Some women go into a public bathroom with the fear alone that the seats are unsanitary even though there may be no visible eveidence. So they brace them selves and sqaut about 6-8 inches above the seat. This precarious position occasionally causes some spray on the seats.

AA11229176	Provera is derived from the female hormone progesterone. You may be given Provera if your menstrual periods have stopped or a female hormone imbalance is causing your uterus to bleed abnormally. Provera is also prescribed to prevent abnormal growth of the uterine lining in women taking estrogen replacement therapy.     Other forms of medroxyprogesterone, such as Depo-Provera, are used as a contraceptive injection and prescribed in the treatment of endometrial cancer. Medroxyprogesterone inhibits fertility at high doses.    Some doctors prescribe Provera to treat endometriosis, menopausal symptoms, premenstrual tension, sexual aggressive behavior in men, and sleep apnea (temporary failure to breath while sleeping).     You should never take Provera during the first 4 months of pregnancy. During this formative period, even a few days of treatment with Provera might put your unborn baby at increased risk for birth defects. If you take Provera and later discover that you were pregnant when you took it, discuss this with your doctor right away.     Side effects may include:   Acne, anaphylaxis (life-threatening allergic reaction), blood clot in a vein, lungs, or brain, breakthrough bleeding (between menstrual periods), breast tenderness or sudden or excessive flow of milk, cervical erosion or changes in secretions, depression, excessive growth of hair, fever, fluid retention, hair loss, headache, hives, insomnia, itching, lack of menstruation, menstrual flow changes, spotting, nausea, rash, skin discoloration, sleepiness, weight gain or loss, yellowed eyes and skin.    Provera should never be taken during pregnancy. Avoid it if you even suspect you're pregnant. Doctors once prescribed Provera as a test for pregnancy, but no longer do so for 2 reasons:       Quicker, safer pregnancy tests are now available.   If you are in fact pregnant, Provera might injure the baby.  Similarly, Provera used to be given to try to prevent miscarriage. However, doctors now believe that this treatment is not only ineffective but also potentially harmful to the baby.     Do not take Provera if you have:       Cancer of the breast or genital organs   Liver disease or a liver condition   A dead fetus still in the uterus   Undiagnosed bleeding from the vagina  Do not take Provera if you have, or have ever developed, blood clots. Avoid it, too, if it gives you an allergic reaction.     Provera may cause some degree of fluid retention. If you have a medical condition that could be made worse by fluid retention--such as epilepsy, migraine, asthma, or a heart or kidney problem--make sure your doctor knows about it.     Provera may mask the onset of menopause. In other words, while taking Provera you may continue to experience regular menstrual bleeding even if your menopause has started.     Provera may make you depressed, especially if you have suffered from depression in the past. If you become seriously depressed, tell your doctor; you should probably stop taking Provera.     If you are diabetic, Provera could make your diabetes worse; your doctor will want to watch you closely while you are taking this drug.     There is some concern that Provera, like birth control pills, may increase your risk for a blood clot in a vein. If you experience any symptoms that might suggest the onset of such a condition--pain with swelling, warmth, and redness in a leg vein, coughing or shortness of breath, vision problems, migraine, or weakness or numbness in an arm or leg--see your doctor immediately.     Tell your doctor right away if you lose some or all of your vision or you start seeing double. You may have to stop taking the medication.     If Provera is taken with certain other drugs, the effects of either may be increased, decreased, or altered. It is especially important to check with your doctor before combining Provera with aminoglutethimide (Cytadren).     You should not take Provera during pregnancy. If you are pregnant or plan to become pregnant, inform your doctor immediately.     Provera appears in breast milk. If you are a new mother, you may need to choose between taking Provera and breastfeeding your baby.     To Restore Menstrual Periods   Provera Tablets are taken in dosages of 5 to 10 milligrams daily for 5 to 10 days. Make sure you discuss what effect this will have on your menstrual cycle with your doctor. You should have bleeding 3 to 7 days after you stop taking Provera.     Abnormal Uterine Bleeding Due to Hormonal Imbalance   Beginning on the 16th or 21st day of your menstrual cycle, you will take 5 to 10 milligrams daily for 5 to 10 days. Make sure you discuss what effect this will have on your menstrual cycle with your doctor. You should have bleeding 3 to 7 days after you stop taking Provera.     To Accompany Estrogen Replacement Therapy   The recommended regimen is 5 or 10 milligrams of Provera a day for 12 to 14 days each month, beginning on either Day 1 or Day 16 of the cycle.

If you're afraid of being targetted by a particular person, don't let it stand. Report it immediately. If you're just afraid of being mugged by a stranger, just stay out of situations that will increase your chances. Examples: Walking down an empty street at night without a companion (dog or a friend), walking in places of known gang activity, or wearing expensive jewelry or carrying a fancy purse. All these things make you a target.  If you want to defend yourself, join a reputable karate dojo. DO NOT join a studio that asks you to sign a contract.

A car needs gasoline, oil, brake fluid and other materials to run properly. Your brain also needs special materials to run properly: glucose, vitamins, minerals and other essential chemicals. For example, the fuel (energy) for your brain is glucose. You can get glucose by eating carbohydrates or other foods that can be converted to glucose.  Your brain must manufacture the right proteins and fats to do things such as grow new connections or add myelin, the fatty sheath to axons. You do this by digesting proteins and fats in food and using the pieces, that is, the amino acids and fatty acids, to make the new brain proteins and fats. Without the correct amount and balance of particular building blocks, your brain will not work properly. Too little (deficiency) or too much (overabundance) of the necessary nutrient can affect the nervous system.     vitamins and minerals that are needed by the body but are not produced by the body. Therefore, these materials must be taken in as part of the diet.    Vitamin B12 (Cyanocobalamin) is a water soluble vitamin necessary for energy production; for nervous system function; for the production of acetylcholine, a neurotransmitter that helps with memory and learning; for the synthesis of red blood cells; and for producing the genetic materials, DNA and RNA.    Vitamin B12 is the most complex of the vitamins and is the only naturally occurring organic compounds that contains cobalt. Cyanocobalamin is the most stable form of vitamin B12.    As the B vitamins work together, it makes sense to take a B complex when taking high amounts of any B vitamin.   Vitamin B-3 essentially comes in two forms: niacin (or nicotinic acid) and niacinamide and both possess the same vitamin activity in the body. Some people prefer to take niacinamide because niacin can cause flushing, itching, burning, and tingling sensations. However, niacin, not niacinamide, is recommended for circulatory problems, and it has greater cholesterol and triglyceride lowering properties.    Niacin is necessary for the metabolism of carbohydrates, fats and proteins. When given in large amounts, niacin has a drug-like effect on blood cholesterol levels. It seems to inhibit the secretion of cholesterol from the liver into the circulation, and also increases the amount of high density lipoprotein, the so-called 'good cholesterol'.      For a long time, people believed that a common component of vitamin E called alpha tocopherol was most important, but another form called gamma tocopherol is definitely a protective antioxidant in brain disorders,  B vitamins are involved in helping the formation of brain chemicals such as dopamine, epinephrine, and serotonin  In fact, each B vitamin plays its own role in preserving brain function and mental acuity. Starting from folic acid (a B complex), which helps in the early brain development, these vitamins help in many aspects of metabolism. A few recent studies have shown a link between declines in memory and Alzheimer's disease in the elderly and inadequate levels of folic acid, vitamin B12, and vitamin B6. Reduced levels of folate are associated with high levels of homocysteine -- a marker of heart disease and stroke.    Vitamin B12 has a number of roles including helping in the formation of myelin    not all fats are bad for you. In fact, some fats are essential for proper brain function. Two lipids important to the brain are the n-6 and n-3 fatty acids. Low levels of n-3 fatty acids in a diet can cause visual problems especially by affecting the retina. Studies in animals have shown that diets without n-3 fatty acids cause learning, motivation and motor problems and may affect systems that use the neurotransmitters dopamine and serotonin in the frontal cortex. The n-6 fatty acids are also important in proper brain function because they affect neurotransmitter release and they also influence the ability of neurons to use glucose.

a6c79bc65f4966fe01308e4a7d261270aa	There is a form, it's called "Medical Permission to Treat Minor Child".    Stepparents often have questions concerning their right to consent, or refuse to consent, to medical care for a stepchild. A parent or guardian of a minor child (under age eighteen in most states) is generally required to give informed consent for most medical decisions on behalf of that child. However, stepparents generally do not have the authority to give legal consent to medical treatment for a stepchild, unless the stepparent has legally adopted the child or been designated a legal guardian. A child's parents or legal guardians may sign a statement authorizing a third party to consent to medical care. A copy of the authorization signed by the parents or legal guardian should be retained with the child's medical records. Sample medical forms are available from SAA.    Without a consent statement, minors requiring emergency services for alleviation of severe pain, or immediate diagnosis and treatment may still receive treatment. In situations where failure to make an immediate diagnosis and begin treatment would lead to serious disability or death, the child will generally be treated even if the parent, guardian or other person authorized to consent cannot be contacted. In these emergencies, consent is "presumed," since the child would otherwise suffer injuries that could have been prevented.     Even though in most states stepparents lack the legal authority to give consent for medical treatment on behalf of their minor stepchildren, there is a general obligation on the stepparent to obtain necessary medical care for the child. Given this fact, it is certainly a good idea to have a statement signed by a parent authorizing the stepparent to make medical decisions on behalf of the child for instances which may not be classified as an emergency, but for which the child should receive medical attention.     The rights and responsibilities of stepparents vary state to state, so consult your local law for the most accurate information. Very few states have statutes that allow stepparents to consent to medical care and their authority consent may only be effective if efforts to notify the biological or adoptive parent have been unsuccessful.

7cafc67a6cda0e361ee93ea545a8330faa	I hate to break this to you, but ther is really no alternative then these two. One you could put on weight......some of it will go to your breasts. The other is implants. So you decide which do you want.    But tell me give you my two cents worth from the point view of a man. I do understand what you might be going through, seeing all the other gals, busty and all. It is the same with guys when they see others all musculine and big.     It must also be affecting your self esteem as well. But you really have to learn to live with it. I am not being arrogant here but really the proper way to deal with it is to learn to put that in a positve light. There are ways to try to make it seem like you have average sized breasts like push up bras or pads.     One more thing, why do you want to have biger breasts. Is there pressure from your husband. If that is the case then I feel  sorry for him because he has not yet seen the real you. He has onlt seen the exterior. But if the problem is yourself, think about it, if your husband has no problem, why should you?? Its not like as if you are goign to parade around to other people.     One more thing I just remembered. I know of some ladies who after child birth do develop breasts. I mean they enlarge to get ready for milk production. Maybe if you have no kids yet, try this.

cb28ec3dd23e46f943fccae9851d36feaa	Actually your program is too long, which means that you are not training with enough intensity. Ideally you should focus on weight training no longer than 45 to 60 minutes and unless you are training for a marathon you should do cardio for about 45 to 60 minutes.  The trick is to train with more intensity for shorter periods. Repeat either your cardio or weight training every other day to get enough recovery between workouts. So you would do cardio on the days that you don't do weights and vice versa.|`|8a8dbda905b567f0abe15311256844e4aa	YY-YY--EEE--SSS  --Y-Y---EEE----S  ---Y-----EEE---SSS|`|AA10530337	sounds good to me.

AA12326862	Whoa.    I've been on it for three years or so, so I feel confident tackling your question.    First off, what are you taking the medication for?  You sound like you don't understand why you're on them.  Is it simply for depression?  Is there a seasonal aspect to your depression, or is it general?  Why did you stop taking Celexa and Paxil?  Did they also have adverse side effects for you?    Are you seeing a psychiatrist for these prescriptions, or a general practitioner?  I hope a psychiatrist is the one prescribing these medications to you.    At any rate, talk to your doctor and see if you can get your dose lowered.  It sounds like you may be taking too much.  Your doctor may want to take you down to 75 milligrams a day.    I must say, going off Effexor isn't easy.  Expect to spend some time doing it, if that's what you and your doctor decide is best.  I get headaches when I miss a dose, and really bad ones when I lower my dose or go off it for a while.      Good luck, whatever you decide.|`|4ccbf6a211d612575e6325efefb899dbaa	I have never had those symptoms when I took that. The thing is teenagers are notorious for skipping does.

Take it in the morning too.|`|a21cc3f4fca2704c7d7dab040dd2265daa	I've also gained weight.  I haven't experienced your symptoms while on Effexor, but I sure have while trying to get off them.   Whatever you do, don't stop cold turkey.   I understand your wish to be completely off medication.  But seriously, talk to you doctor first.  And tell him/her about the 'herbal stuff'.  It can have a bad interaction with prescription medications.|`|fa6bf11caad5b13b043be2cf982138eaaa	Although I have never been on Effexor, I have taken Paxil & have currently been on Prozac for about six years now.

But talk to the doctor.|`|55af16d79db1a589a52e1ca8472e5eb7aa	Yes, one of the side effects from anti-depressants is weight gain.It is very common thing to gain weight and be bloated.

It has a short half-life (time in your body) and thus, should be taken regularly every day.  If you miss doses, you get "withdrawal" symptoms, not dangerous, but unpleasant.  It should also not be abruptly discontinued , but gradually decreased over several days time.  Early trials of some herbal antidepressant remedies haven't been very promising.  Talk to your prescribing doctor about a trial without a medication, if you want to do this, but make sure you still keep seeing this doctor for awhile, or later as needed.

a0eee6c2080f66bc0b6b9139808ac2e1aa	In Vitro Fertilization Pre-Embryo Transfer (IVF-ET) is a fertility procedure Due to improvements in ultrasound imaging, surgery is no longer necessary for most In Vitro Fertilization patients. A technique for recovery of eggs from the ovary is described below. It uses a sonographically-guided needle to replace the surgical procedure which previously was used to recover oocytes (eggs). This procedure, called Transvaginal Oocyte Retrieval, requires neither hospitalization nor general anesthesia.     In order to prepare a proper environment in the woman and to increase the chances of recovering several healthy and mature eggs, the woman will undergo about two weeks of intensive preparation. This will include hormonal therapy with "fertility drugs." Blood tests and ultrasound scans of the ovaries are used to determine the optimal time to retrieve the eggs from the ovary. This optimal time is just before ovulation when the oocytes are almost ready for fertilization.     At the proper time, an outpatient procedure under local anesthesia will allow the female's eggs to be visualized by ultrasound and retrieved from the ovary by placing a needle through the vaginal wall. The mild discomfort that the patient feels has been described as similar to a Pap smear or endometrial biopsy. After a short rest, the patient will be able to go home and resume normal activities.     The fluid from the follicles is examined under the microscope by the embryologist, who locates the eggs and keeps them in the laboratory under physiologic conditions. The embryologist will place the sperm with the eggs when they are ready for fertilization. Usually, the eggs will develop into cleaving pre-embryos, whose cells divide 2 or 3 times to become preimplantation embryos (pre-embryos). They are maintained in laboratory dishes, in a nutrient mixture which acts as a substitute for the environment that would otherwise have been provided by the fallopian tubes.     Using a special catheter, the couple's pre-embryos will be passed through the vagina and into the uterus at the time the pre-embryos would normally have reached the uterus (2+ days after retrieval).     After the pre-embryo placement in the uterus, the patient will lie quietly in a bed for about an hour, and then will return home.|`|64f91defc784998eff36666cf0eb742eaa	The single female egg and the teeming male sperms are taken from the respective bodies, and the egg is fertilised by mixing them together in a glass dish; the fertilised egg is re-introduced into the woman.

My son was recently diagnosed with Crohn's disease which has a connection to yours.  It also causes your body to attack itself.  He takes about 18 pills a day right now but they aren't doing real well controlling his symptoms.  He has a very positive personality and that has helped him immensely.  With all of these auto-immune diseases attitude is very important.  Although I don't know your condition, I wonder why you can't go to school.  I have never heard of anyone with this type of disease who had to totally quit living.  Maybe once you become stabilized, things will turn around for you.  A support group would be great.  My son wanted to get into one but he's only 14 and so far, his doctor can't find one.  She says most kids his age, especially boys, won't participate.  Ask your doctor for a local chapter or type in your disease in a search engine.  You might also call a local hospital and see if they have a support group there.     I wish you the best.

Hq6nSl1Qaa	Gluten allergies isn't really a damaged digestive system.  Consider that many cultures across the world live without the benefit of wheat.  You only concern should be if he is also a vegetarian.  Without breads, he is more likely to have less yeast in his diet, which means that he probably has better absorption that most Americans.    Lactobacillus acidophilous is a bacteria that is commonly found in nature.  Along with other bacteria such as bifidum, they displace yeast in the intestinal tract and improve nutrient absorption.  Daily to weekly supplementation of a liquid "Pro-flora" culture helps improve digestion so he can get the most out of his food.  Colloidal minerals and liquid vitamins are also a slam dunk.

It is likely you will need to taper over a period of several weeks.|`|d8i5RWcRaa	I went through it briefly, but not for an extended period of time as you have.  To be on this prescription for 13 years is quite excessive to say the least.     You really do need to gradually back of your dosage from week to week until you're "weaned" off of this stuff.  To go cold turkey from it would probably do you more harm then good, and I think a gradual approach is the logical answer.      Also, to play it smart, I suggest that you "come down" from Klonopin gradually, and under a doctors supervision. Why take chances?  Be safe in doing this!      Be careful, and best wishes.
CXfzCli0aa	When I did my GCSEs last year, I was having similar problems. I don't think it matters so much at the start of the year but you'd probably be better sorting it sooner rather than later. Try getting into bed at about 10 and shutting the curtains and putting a small lamp on. Read a book until you fall asleep and if you need to use the computer then don't use it right before you go to bed. I found that using the computer and/or watching telly straight before trying to sleep would keep me wide awake.    If you have trouble getting up in the morning, it might be an idea to set an alarm and then leave whatever it's set on (eg, phone/clock) across the room from your bed and then rather than going back to bed, go straight to the shower to wake yourself up properly.|`|9ea5e8dd576fe0621bb8f8f8c17c8e7baa	Hi ACD,     Your sleep cycle is totally off.

Really worth the try    www.iherb.com|`|l74RoxUDaa	I was a postman for five years and started work at 5am which meant getting up at 3.30am.    Have you ever travelled to a far country?  Imagine you are in a different time zone, say Moscow (GMT+3).  Set one clock or watch to the new time, and then go to bed and get up at your usual time, but in the new time zone.    You'll suffer from jet lag for a while, but you'll soon adapt.  The other thing is to put a bright light on waking in your new time zone.  The most effective is to turn the light up slowly over about 20 minutes. There are alarm clocks that do this : http://www.lumie.com/shop/products/dawn-...    When I was a postman, I was pretty unsociable after 9pm, my bedtime.  If I was out with friends, I used to crawl into a corner at that time and nod off!  They used to call me Dormouse.|`|10c979e80c1a77d3cf2b4e97031885b7aa	the easiest way to adjust your sleep is to just force yourself to get up at the time you want to get up in the morning. If you haven't got enough sleep you'll find it easier to sleep the next night and so on...    I can't get to sleep till about 2 after time off school but I just keep getting up at 6.30am and eventually Im so tired I could fall asleep by 10 easily.
AA10241127	rubbing alcohol...it might be a bit painful...and it might sting, but that means it's working.  Rubbing alcohol will dry it up.  Once you spot a pimple...even before it gets a white head, use the rubbing alcohol on the pimple. Gently scrub the pimple with the rubbing alcohol.

Why take the med if you don't want to sleep?

8OqdoIHtaa	Your chances are much higher than someone without any close family members with this disease.     You should get tested again. In fact, you should get tested every year from now on, because your chances are increased with close family members being diabetic and they also increase as you age.     You are describing symptoms that could be from diabetes, the eye sight problems, the pins and needles, dizziness, It doesn't mean you're diabetic, other things can cause these symptoms, but you really need to get checked out as soon as you can get an appointment. Simple panic attacks could cause pins and needles in the hands, and face, and dizziness. Given recent events, panic attacks wouldn't be totally out of the question either.     For diabetes testing, I recommend the HbA1c test. It doesn't require fasting, and it isn't affected by what you ate the day before, because it gives your average blood sugar for the last three months. This is a more reliable test than a fasting glucose or random glucose.    For a normal healthy person, the results of an HbA1c test should fall between 3.5 and 5.5% .  If its over, you are prediabetic, or diabetic, depending on where it falls.    Your Dad is still type 2, but now he's a type 2, insulin dependent.     This article explains it very well...   http://www.everydayhealth.com/specialist...|`|ONWCXzUMaa	Yes you are at risk, it's the only way to say it, and you should keep on it and all ways be checked, and watch your diet.

You can't "turn into" a type one from a type two. Doctors diagnose based on the disease onset, not the treatment.|`|7oYpbSjIaa	hun, your dad is still a T2.  T1 is an autoimmune disease.  you're only a T1 if you have antibodies present.  T2 sometimes need insulin too if they don't control themselves by losing weight or dieting.  this is what happened to your dad.  he didn't turn into a T1.  he's been a T2 all along.
8OqdoIHtaa	He isn't a type 1. He's a type 2 with a burned out pancreas, who will need insulin for the rest of his life.     You cannot go from being type 2 to type 1.     Type 1 and 2 are descriptive of the state of your pancreas when you were diagnosed, NOT whether or not you need insulin at some later point. Needing insulin at a later point doesn't change you from being type 2 to type 1. He is still type 2 and always will be.     To be called a type 1, you must experience a sudden failure to produce insulin, and you will have antibodies that back up the diagnosis. You do not start out with type 2, you get immediate and sudden failure, not a slow failure.     Type 2 comes on more slowly and gradually gets worse over years or decades. Eventually the pancreas can burn out and fail to produce any insulin, at which point you must start insulin injections. Some people mistakenly call this becoming type 1, but its not. Its simply the natural progression of type 2 diabetes.     Most people who are type 2 will need insulin at some point. That doesn't change the type of diabetes you have. The proper term for your father's conditoin is type 2 diabetic, insulin dependent. The same as me.    Your father should have been on insulin sooner, it would have prevented the coma. Its unfortunate that some doctors delay using insulin in type 2 diabetics, because it can give the pancreas a rest and delay the burn out that eventually comes.    Insulin also enables you to control your blood sugar better. Obviously your father would have done better on it.     I hope that clears up the type issue. If not, please read this article...     http://www.everydayhealth.com/specialist...  ===    I highly recommend the book called Diabetes for Dummies, and also     The First Year: Type 2 Diabetes: An Essential Guide for the Newly Diagnosed by Gretchen Becker.     This is a really good book for anyone with type 2 diabetes, even someone whose had diabetes for a few years and needs insulin, because it explains the desease well, and he'll probably learn things he didn't know which will help him control it better.    There is an excellent diabetes website and the author of it has just published a new book called Blood Sugar 101. You can find the website here...   http://www.phlaunt.com/diabetes/    and you can order the book from this page...  http://www.phlaunt.com/diabetes/20585442...    The material in this book is a little more advanced, but its excellent.     Most diabetics do better if they reduce their carbs. Most diabetic cookbooks have recipes with far too many carbs in them, so I recommend The South Beach Quick and Easy Cookbook.     If you have a copy of The South Beach Diet book, that's a great place to start looking for a reduced carb meal plan. He shouldn't go very low carb, so it would better to try the second phase, which allows moderate amounts of carbs.     He'll have to reduce his carbs slowly, becuase it can affect the amount of insulin the body needs. Tell him to take it slowly.     The best thing would be for him to see a diabetes dietician for counselling on counting carbs and how many carbs per meal he should have. Its well worth it.     and another low carb book to consider would be ...    Protein Power: The High-Protein/Low-Carbohydrate Way to Lose Weight, Feel Fit, and Boost Your Health--in Just Weeks! (Paperback) By Michael Eades        PS. I do NOT recommend anything by Dr Whitaker. He's a quack who has my diabetic mother convinced she can beat diabetes by buying his very expensive vitamins. His advice on diabetes is way off, if what my mother quotes is anything to go by. She has terrible control and was in emergency recently with out of control blood sugar. She nearly put herself in a coma by following his advice.     My husband and I are also diabetic, both type 2. Our blood sugar is under good control. I'm on 2 types of insulin and my husband is on oral meds. We both count carbs to help keep our blood sugar under control.

Work with real professional medical people and you and your dad will work this thing out.

AA10892706	I've been taking some type (birth control, anti depressants, tranquilizers) of pill for 24 years.  Reading your post makes me believe, yes you are  abusing pills.  You said you couldn't sleep and didn't feel right without a pill. That is addiction.  The lorazepam you are taking is a tranquilizer too, it probably gives you some sort of high.  There are other options for IBS if you want to help yourself off pills.|`|e90dbf569b2c489ca710e176785beb85aa	They're starting to recommend that people with IBS, or IBS-like symptoms be tested for celiac disease, which is an intolerance to gluten (wheat, rye, barley and oats). A lot of people with celiac were misdiagnosed as having IBS for years. (18 years for me). It takes an average of 11 years for a person with celiac to be diagnosed.     Celiac also can cause pain.  I had back pain so bad that I could barely walk.  Seriously.  I was on my way to a wheelchair and should have had a power chair, but I was being stubborn.  It was the most bizarre thing when I went gluten-free to see if it would help my IBS symptoms and my pain went away like somebody flipped a switch.  Within a week.      There are a lot of people with celiac and the pain that goes with it who don't get an immediate improvement (or much improvement at all) in their pain from going GF.  But, I know what it's like to not only have IBS, but have pain on top of it.  Just being free of one of them is worth everything.      Here's a webpage by the National Institutes of Health on celiac -   http://digestive.niddk.nih.gov/ddiseases...    And another from the Mayo Clinic -     http://www.mayoclinic.com/health/celiac-...    If that starts sounding familiar here are a couple of message boards for people with celiac and other gluten intolerances.     http://www.glutenfreeforum.com  http://www.celiacforums.com    You can also be intolerant to other common foods and get IBS-type symptoms. Soy, corn, eggs, yeast, dairy, etc. can all cause major issues.  You may want to think about keeping a food/symptoms journal and see if you can identify the culprit(s).

Talk to a doctor counselor,etc|`|09b292feb0c543c42aaba7873e2bf99daa	yes i think it is|`|ee924070953658265c515090c8cc5139aa	I would have to give a definite yes to that. Seems like you need to take a pill , any pill. I'm surprised your Doctor gave you the lorazaepam. Do you by chance go Doc to Doc for scripts?    I think it would be a good idea to go into detail with your Dr about your usage of all drugs. You need to be talking to someone and fast.  Drug rehab would be a good choice for you.    Good luck and please remember DEAD IS Not COOL!!!!!!!|`|48057cf6869dca8c99492d5486a45a12aa	yea ur an addict...only mentally tho...im dealing with physical addiction...consider yourself warned that u should get help b4 u turn to something that is physically addicting...you'll wanna die...|`|AA12050379	Motrin is not addictive.  Vicodin and Lorazapam are.  It definately sounds like addictive type behavior. Seek an addiction trained therapist for a comprehensive assessment.|`|AA10580726	Good rule of thumb:  If you ever ask yourself whether you have a problem - you do.      It's really that easy.  You might consider speaking with a Psychologist to help you deal with whatever issues are preventing you from sleeping at night.|`|ed1ae0a38750a6427b84a62ec7e96ed3aa	Ok, there is a big difference between 600mg of Motrin twice a day and going to anything you could find. I would say it's a pretty safe bet that if you are asking strangers on the internet if they think you have a problem that you have a problem. You need to seeksome help from a doctor. Not to get more medicaiton (and no I am not trying to be rude), but to try to get weened off the medication or to get into a outpatient rehab program. If that doesn't work, maybe even an inpatient rehab if necessary. I would definitely recoommend some professional help.|`|AA11834998	I'm abusing Xanax as well dont worry slowly withdrawal go to the doctor its crap i hate xanax and in a way i like it because you feel better but its short term and it get out of your system i take 2 to 4mg detox and withdrawal is going to be hell       ps i took ativan as well back in 2001 its was a good medicine|`|bfd21f37526e25eaf70b3f4d65872d4baa	Congratulations!  You hit it right on the head - you ARE addicted!  Call your nearest rehab or your physician immediately  if not sooner.      You are headed in the right direction - keep going - don't stop now.  You have the right momentum and you're going to need it to help you kick this monkey off your back.  It will be worth all of the effort it will take.  You will find that life is beautiful without drugs.    Do it now!

AA10661525	Yes.. Ulcers can make you nautious, especially after you eat or drink something. Get it checked to make sure you do or do not have one. Bleeding Ulcers lead to purferated Ulcers which can kill you.  Do yourself a favor and get it checked.. Do you get heart burn alot also?  What most people do not realize is if you have pain were your stomach is its not your stomach.. its your small intestines.. stomach pain will be felt on the lower left of the body right below your heart I know it sounds stupid but thats just happens to be where whoever made us put those nerves. Thats why alot of people end up in the ER thinking there having a heart attack when its there Stomach  ie gas/gurd. But to get back to your question get it checked you can still have an Ulcer in your Intestines.. Colitis.. Good luck ..|`|RYzXHmSYaa	depending on the type of and the location of these possible ulcers it can make you nauseous. i was diagnosed with ulcerative colitis about 8 years ago. before i was properly diagnosed i experienced stomach cramps on a daily basis as well as painful bowel movements that went on for months before i finally went to a doctor. another sign of possible ulcers in the digestive tract is blood in the bowels, if you notice blood on the paper or in the bowl itself, i would advise seeing a gastroinerologist or your primary physician. good luck|`|7d2d91a839f78b715e814d81d76aeca0aa	It can be a nervous stomach.

7SmHY4o4aa	Hi there, the science behind saw palmetto is that it helps prevent the production of DHT.     DHT is found in large quantities in men and also women. Saw palmetto helps prevent testosterone from converting into DHT. Saw palmetto comes in various forms and can be applied various ways. The most common form of supplement is taken orally, but you can also apply it directly to the scalp. There are various creams and shampoos on the market that contain forms of saw palmetto. It is important to make sure you have a high quality supplement.    Saw palmetto has been used for hundreds of years. Native Americans have used saw palmetto to help prevent urinary problems. Saw palmetto is also used to help maintain a healthy prostate and reduce the size of the prostate. As men began to take the supplement, many noticed that their hair began to grow back or not fall out at the same rate. Many people believe that saw palmetto is affective against hair loss and take it every day. If you decide to try the supplement, please consult your physician first.    Only time will tell if saw palmetto really works to prevent hair loss or not. Give it a try and see if it works for you. Try one of the creams, shampoos or high quality supplements.

You  would have to continue drinking water though.  |`|TrgeN0Mwaa	Probably not that much actually. Your body will go into starvation mode and try to hold on to every calorie it can. I don't know who "they" are but they are the flat earthers of the weight loss set. Your body needs a certain level of calories to maintain its self, and 1000 or less is not enough...    Try this site to determine how many calories you need to maintain your body on a daily basis:    http://www.caloriecontrol.org/calcalcs.h...    To reduce your weight by 1 lb per week, drop 500 calories per day, 2 lbs, drop 1000. don't go over 2 & 1/2 lbs per week weight loss otherwise you could start losing muscle, which will make it more difficult to keep the weight off once you have lost it.

a2f1a6b961af33c6049c53468b288e28aa	I was told repeatedly by AA members that if I took medication, I wasn't really sober, that it would lead to relapse, and that I would "die drunk in a gutter". (Those exact words by different people, some in different states, so it wasn't just one persons opinion.) In one pro-AA recovery Yahoo group, I asked about the use of medication and received a half-dozen cruel, off-board remarks. I've even heard of people being told to go off of heart medication by fanatics!    I now work in the mental health field. When I started, I worked with people that all had substance abuse and mental health issues. Every one of them had encountered the anti-medication faction at some point; some did with disasterous results.    AA has a large anti-medication, anti-therapy faction that is responsible for the deaths of many who took their advice, went off of medication and died as a result of suicide. Almost everyone that's been around the rooms for any length of time knows of at least one person this has happened to.    George Valliant, Harvard professor, researcher, and member of AA's Board of Trustees, attempted to prove that AA works. He found that a person using AA methods was SIX TIMES as likely to end up dead than a person attempting to quit on their own. He remarked on his findings: "Not only had we failed to alter the natural history of alcoholism, but our death rate of three percent a year was appalling."  http://www.orange-papers.org/orange-effe...|`|tgZTD73Laa	AA and NA are for people who admit they have trouble with Alcohol or addicitive substance abuse.  There only requirement is the the desire to stop using drugs or alcohol which interferes with everyday life.  Addiction is when you have to get something and place a higher value of getting high or drunk over keeping a job, raising your kids or paying bills.  These organizations ask you to do nothing but express a desire to stop using.****AFTER reading some the posts I have posted an addenum.  There are many groups in AA and NA that get away from the main purpose by expressing their opinions.  I attend NA open meetings in support of a significant other and members in this group do well because it is leaned more toward support than judgement and opinion.  Someone elses opinions can get you killed.  The referral person stated that if a group is more about war stories then it's time to find a new group, it's gotten away from it's purpose.  The groups function autonomously so each one could be different and are filled with people of differing opinions.  Do not stop medciations for health conditions except on the advice of your doctor.  On the same token be careful of doctors that push medications saying you need help to relax.  Many doctors are responsible for people being addicted to some medications to begin with.|`|vGILJCFmaa	The classic AA response to this will be "ask your sponsor."  More strict hard line groups like Clancy's Pacific Group in L.A. (& its spin offs elsewhere) will have high numbers of people who do not look favorably on psych drugs of any sort, believing they are mood altering chemicals by definition.  This is pretty rare though and you will know if you get in a group w/ very strict rules/antiquated beliefs, whatever you want to call them.  No medical facilites will require coming off your ("non-addictive") psych meds.  That's called liability. Hard to sue a broke *** AA sponsor if you go completely nuts (if you aren't already) from taking their advice.  Unless you are in denial/ignorance about what a psych med is of course, since you didn't qualify.  This decision should always be made w/ your physician.  Only take medical advice from those licensed to give it.  This almost never includes substance abuse counselors, AA sponsors and the like.|`|AA12050379	AA has no opinion on outside issues.  This is an outside issue.    The AA book says there are great doctors and people should make use of them.  Some people may have opinions and say certain meds are addictive (Valium, Xanax, Klonipin, etc) and alcoholics should be aware of cross addiction potential.    It is best if an addict or alcoholic can see an addictionologist who practices psychiatry to prescribe for them.  Then one can be sure that their sobriety will not be put in jeapordy by a well meaning (yet less addiction trained) doctor.    However... AA has NO OPINION ON THIS ISSUE.  Only AA members have opinions and there are lots of them.    Best wishes.|`|FrCLL1YLaa	My experience is that AA has no opinion or position regarding psychtropic or any other kind of drug - so no one can give you an answer for AA - only their personal opinion - which is not AA's.    Peace,    Danny S    http://recoveredalcoholic.blogspot.com|`|ZX1AOUHvaa	:)    No, they don't. All that they ask is that you show up. You'll hear that a lot and meet many people who have duel diagnosis (drug or alcohol abuse *and* mental illness.) AA isn't a cult that tells you what to do.    Never ever stop taking your medications without speaking with your doctor about it first. I actually attended an NA meeting once to help understand a friend's behavior and they don't even care if you show up under the influence.     They accept and try to nurture your *desire* to change. So just showing up is important. Step 1 of recovery will come much later but it can't happen until you go. You may also wish to pick up a book from your local library about 12 step programs and how they work.|`|hCzVPO2uaa	It has been my experience that there are a lot of different views on this. The only one that matters is your own.     If you truly need a psychiatric medication such as an anti depressant, you should be taking it. That is the responsible thing to do.     I stayed on my antidepressant for the first few months of becoming clean. I am now slowly weening off.    I always considered myself as being sober even when on the antidepressant and you should too.    http://www.whatwinnersdo.com is my personal addiction recovery site where I talk about my experiences so far.|`|SdGkcPztaa	I am not sure what psychiatric meds you are on but it sounds like you have what is called a 'dual diagnosis', which means you have a diagnosis of a major mental illness along with alcohol dependence or drug addiction.    If you are taking Benzos, they may encourage you to stop, as it is generally fatal to consume alcohol with Benzos. Benzos are medicines used to treat epilepsy which are also used to treat anxiety disorders, agitation or Bipolar Disorder. They include Valium, Depakote, Lorezapam, Klonopin and many others.    If medicine is doctor prescribed for mental illness they should not encourage you to stop the medicine.    For your sake I hope you will seek treatment and try to sustain it as people with dual diagnosis generally face a lifetime on the streets if they fail. It is a sad fact.     I do not have a dual diagnosis, I have Schizophrenia. Having Schizophrenia I am very careful about myself and never use alcohol or drugs as I do not want to worsen my mental condition and put myself at risk of losing my lifetime achievements. Alcohol and drugs damage the brain, which is a fact that only emotionally mature people accept.    Hopefully you can strive to find a workable solution and a better lifestyle and keep yourself healthy and safe.    take care:)|`|apNnaxTZaa	They do not ask you to stop your medication but I think it really depends on what psychiatric medication you are referring to.  If it is medication that are addictive they may frown upon it but AA will not turn anyone away unless their presence is more of a distraction than a help.

The way you work on self esteem is to give your attention to others.  Find volunteer projects to help other people.      Did you know that the Bible says that Jesus was not at all handsome to look at ? " He grew up before him like a tender shoot, and like a root out of dry ground.  He had no beauty or majesty to attract us to him, nothing in his appearance that we should desire him." (Isaiah 53:2) He has many followers and people who love Him because He loves us first.    Here is a list of not so beautiful people who have made a difference in the world:  Abraham Lincoln - president, Mother Teressa- humanitarian, Danny De Vito - movie actor, Randy Johnson - baseball star, Johnny Cash - recording artist.      Be sure that your body, teeth, and your clothes are clean and that you are well groomed.  A person who is dirty or smells badly is not desirable to be around.    God bless you.  Be positive and think on the cares of others and you will be fine.|`|AA10891466	No one on earth is ugly.  It's what's inside that makes a person.  And if you get stared at in public in the wrong way or looked at funny, do what I do, I look back at them in the same way, and I'm not afraid to ask them:  What are you staring at?|`|22fc9b3de019ab0e54602c6f486056d2aa	In your question you said that you go out, and people look at you BECAUSE you are ugly, and that you know that this is why they don't want to be with you. This is entirely something you are telling yourself inside your head, its not real. This is self-defeating talk that you have going inside of you. You need to challenge these thoughts when they happen. Where's your proof that this is what they are thinking? You have no way of knowing this. Change your negative thinking, and you will feel better.     Ugly people with high self esteem don't have these negative self-dialogs in their heads. They see someone looking at them, and assume good or neutral things like "They must like my hair" or even "Do I have something in my teeth", but NOT "they must be thinking i'm ugly". This is the difference, and YOU are in charge of what thoughts you say to yourself. Control them, don't let them control you.|`|d168bfdb715c7efcdad74a40e3f5752baa	My dear, please don't let your looks get you down. Many people I know who aren't conventionally good looking are happy people because they realise that people like them for who they are and their looks cease to matter.    Talk to your friends. Find out what they like about you. Don't just lock yourself in your room - go out and mingle. Think of all the things that you're good at and aspects of your personality that are unique and good, and you'll realise that there's no reason to hate youself.    I know people with low self-esteem (I'm dating one). If someone tells you they like you or praises you, don't you DARE doubt them. Hold on to what they're telling you and know that it's true. If you hold on to every positive thought that people send your way, you're on your way to a healthier self-image.

They are probably at a perfect size.   And yes, I would definetely say they care. That's what America has turned into, so there's no need to worry about that.    If you want, you can have breast reduction surgery but it's expensive and may not turn out to well.      P.S.: Most women with large breasts wish they had smaller ones because of sores and irritations, but most women with small breasts with they had bigger ones to impress people more.    I'm sure they're fine.

And when I pulled down my panties their was bright red everywhere. I started screaming for my mom and she came in there and said oh my god I didn't think I had to worry about this for another couple of years, she left me like that and ran to the store than she showed me how to use the pad.

I was rather mad because I was hoping I'd have a couple more years to go, but no such luck. I had terrible cramps as a teenager, for which ibuprofen worked (and still works) wonders.

aZTisUHiaa	well I have used both, and really I didn't see a difference in my skin.    If your using products to help with blemishes then you want something with benzoyl peroxide in it.  I have used oxy, and like it.  I also have used more expensive regimens like Kara Vita and used their 3 step with has a toner too and really liked that.  I have 2 friends that use Proactiv and swear by it.  I was just in Mexico and looked in to getting some Retin-A which you can only get by prescription here in the states, but it is cheaper to just go to the doctor and get it.    Look to see what the ingredients are in the AVON products you are looking at and compare then to something you have used before that worked.

Universal life force energy must exist in all the elements within and around us, this awareness, or tapping the energies of creation and recreation is a gift (gift of awareness) is only given to a chosen few, these chosen few are chosen by the force itself. Attunement process teaches one to purposefully help themselves, others and the environment around us at the attuned frequencies, different levels of attunement have different sine waves. as one advances with practice the vibrations of energy also increase/or decrease, whatever the scale used.|`|4a4b9be516eeab81005bf8f97c61e37aaa	Everything in our universe is part of the "universal energy".

Il n'existe pas de rythme "normal" de la dfcation, la frquence moyenne des selles tant, selon les individus, de deux par jour  trois par semaine.

TRAITEMENT : Le traitement consiste  adopter certaines rgles d'hygine de vie : une alimentation varie comportant en proportion suffisante des fibres alimentaires (son, haricots verts, farine complte, cleri...), des crudits et des fruits; la pratique d'un exercice physique, etc. L'usage des laxatifs en automdication est dconseill; s'ils sont prescrits, ils le sont de fa?on limite de manire  viter leurs effets nocifs : diarrhe, dpendance, crampes intestinales, flatulences.|`|31cf853cf84660faa01d39e50f52a71aaa	Il faut prendre le traitement pendant plusieurs jours pour qu'il soit efficace !! sinon le remde (hors mdicaments) est de boire beaucoup d'eau et de manger des fibres (lgumes verts) et des fruits (pommes poires) sauf banane et bien s?r viter les fculents et le chocolat !!|`|bd27122911a6dd64f9f59cf2005d939baa	a raison  bromistes voient des gens qui te font...ch.....!!!|`|c76ee342f5884f18d449462e8ac74e8baa	Je suis l'un des plus constips au monde, si si.

Il faut un bon apport de fibres avec des fruits et des lgumes mais, en gnral, cela ne suffit pas. Pour augmenter cet apport, le plus efficace et le moins cher, c'est le son. Deux cuillers  soupe par jour  mettre dans du yaourt ou,  dfaut, dans un jus de tomate de fa?on  ce qu'il soit humidifi mais reste en suspension et ne forme pas un paquet au fond de la tasse comme avec du lait ou de l'eau. Il faut boire beaucoup plus, mme sans soif.   Il faut compter 2  3 semaines pour avoir le plein effet du son. En attendant, on peut prendre un laxatif efficace et pas dangereux comme du Movicol.  Il ne faut jamais utiliser de produits par l'anus, comme des suppositoires ou des lavements car cela irrite le rectum et renforce la constipation.  Souvent les constips chroniques ne sentent plus qu'ils doivent aller  la selle. Il faut donc qu'ils aillent  la toiltte  heure fixe, sans ressentir d'envie et quand ils sont tranquilles et pas presss pour viter que ?a coince.

WicDppReaa	You wrote that your period was late: is there a chance you were pregnant and this was a early spontaneous miscarriage? Being a few days late would not show any visible fetus at miscarriage, but might explain the pain, the blood and blood clots (which can look very much like a piece of meat).  Any delay of your period (because of stress, hormonal imbalance etc.) can cause kind of heavier and more painful periods afterwards.     If you continue to bleed heavily or to have quite a bit of pain with this period, better go and see urgently your doctor to exclude an ongoing (even worse: ectopic?) pregnancy o some "retained products of pregnancy" etc.  If you continue with heavy, painful periods in the future, try anti-inflammatory tablets like Ibuprofen o Mefenamic Acid and consider seeing your doctor to exclude endometriosis o uterine fibroids. Good luck.  PS (after reading your additional details): Pregancy tests, especially the ones using urine, are not 100% sensitive in the very early days of pregancy.|`|AA11813480	I'm really glad you asked this ? b/c I had the same   thing happen last month it was really different  usually I have a moderate period every month  but last month was exacly what your describing  very painful and heavy and I have been putting off going to see a doctor,but I wonder if they would be able to tell  if I was really pregnant?I 'm actually on again and this period is normal no clotts no pain .Take care|`|AA10891466	You should really make an appointment with your OB GYN on this or call and request info.

8JS4nq8haa	Well, I can't speak for every therapist, but here is what I would do: First, explore deeper issues and the reasons for cutting (and of course make sure the the person is not suicidal and/or see if there needs to be a safety plan), then I would give the person techniques to use to help stop cutting until the deeper issues causing the need to cut could be resolved or dealt with in a healthier way.    Some techniques would include:  Snapping a rubber band on the wrist, holding an ice cube on the skin, using a red marker to symbolize the blood, physical activity or exercise, and any other way that the person can express their pain in a physical way with out hurting themselves (or hurting themselves seriously).     Obviously you would start with the techniques that are the most similar to cutting and work towards healthier ways of coping.    Another thing I teach cutters is to begin to deal with their stress and emotions before they become so overwhelming.  I ask them to try to become more aware of the particular thoughts and feelings they experience when cutting, and then try to become more aware of when these thoughts and emotions start to build.  Then we think of things they can do to deal with these feelings before they become so overwhelming that all they want to do is cut.      I also like to help them rationalize some of these overwhelming feelings and use their thoughts to control their emotions.  This works very well with clients who are depressed, because often people experience very irrational thoughts when they are depressed. ("Nobody loves me."  "Things will never get better."  The thoughts are often much more specific, but you get the idea.)    Hope this helps.|`|ATZxVU6Haa	They would help figure out where the need to cut is coming from and what the source of the person's pain really is. Self mutilation can be a way of dealing with tension and aggression or other control issues. Please don't worry about what a therapist might say or ask, anything they talk about with you is confidential and if you get a therapist who you don't connect with don't give up, get a different one. Keep asking questions until you get the answers you need.|`|9555e87859bdd4dd5fa1871a7813b8f8aa	i cut too and my therapist just care only about herself|`|AA12050379	They would ask about other signs of borderline personality disorder.|`|d2a0990475e0f667c5ad93ab48d28197aa	Each therapist is different.  But most would be concerned and caring.  They would ask about how you feel and how many times you do it.  They would even try and give you a safety plan in case something happens.    Don't be afraid.  If you find a therapist that you trust, they can really help you.  You might explore why you do it and what happened before and after you cut yourself.    They will be nice.
lpMADedqaa	IT MIGHT BE HORMONAL. THAT HAPPENS TO ALOT OF GIRLS AND IT MIGHT BE FOR A NORMAL REASON LIKE YOUR BODY IS ACTING WEIRD OR YOUR HORMONE LEVELS ARE MESSEP UP FOR THIS PERIOD.

BUT IN ANY EVENT DON'T WORRY ABOUT IT TOO MUCH BECAUSE IF YOU STRESS IT ITS GOING TO TAKE LONGER CUZ SOMETIMES ITS ALL IN YOUR HEAD...|`|AA10891466	When in doubt, make an appointment with  your OB GYN.

dd57c7f883d7e69cc7906fc46e54207baa	You're probably dehydrated.  Your body needs water.  If you drank a lot of alcohol, cafeinne, or sugar before going to bed, your system got "dried out" in a sense, and something more pure (spring water or even tap water) is necessary to flush out your body and revitalize it.|`|dd1f927248c50b7511137071de2458a5aa	Because head aches are a symptome of dehydration. When someone is dehydrated, your body will sent out signals to let you know that you need more water in your body. More water in your pipes means better circulation. Better circulation means less strain on the brain to get the necessary things it needs.      cheers|`|zq7Jv2o9aa	You may have sleep apnea or some other reduction in the amount of air that you are getting while you are sleeping.

One mg ativan is roughly equal to 10mg of valium. In my wilder days I think I put down 20mg with about 20 some-odd beers because they work with the alcohol and make you think you're not feeling anything so you may keep taking them and it's a good way to lead to an overdose like I did. I weigh 145lbs by the way. Really dont recommend mixing alcohol and ativan/xanax/valium or any other similar substances. Seen too many folks go crazy on them, and one guy die.|`|7c50acef30a6e04bca8a50438d4d4fc3aa	I'm not quite sure why you want to know this but the money answer is ativan and alcohol in high enough doses will kill you. Fact of the matter is you stand a good chance of killing yourself with even a small dose and alcohol because you cannot accurately predict how your body will metabolize the mixture of chemicals. My advice to you is go get some help before you do something stupid and succeed.|`|AA12050379	Yes. Benzodiazapines and alcohol are often the most fatal combination of drugs mixed with alcohol.      5mg of Ativan mixed with alcohol could have been fatal.  I am concerned about you and your high risk behaviors.  Are you "testing out" suicide?    Please seek help before making such a permanent decision.  There are people out there who care and would like to help.  Call your doctor as soon as possible and let him or her know what you are going through.  Hang in there.  Hope is possible.|`|3a61a6606dfcadd228c2251b734c47feaa	It depends on your dosage and the amount of alcohol you are drinking. .5 mg with a glass of vodka will not harm you, however may make you drowsy. 2 mg of ativan or more with any alcoholic beverages is probably not safe, regardless of your weight.|`|9e89c21b5ab9321e64cbc890987b0fcbaa	Yes it can kill you.  I am unsure of the dose necessary, but both are central nervous system depressants.  Also, both act on the central nervous system in similar ways.    It's been a while since I took pharmacolgy, so I can't give you the specific science here, but it is dangerous.  That is a fact.
ClQOqiBvaa	Put simply, systolic pressure refers to the highest amount of pressure exerted on the walls of your arteries (when your heart contracts to pump blood through the body), while diastolic pressure refers to the lowest amount of pressure on your arterial walls (when the chambers of your heart are filling with blood in preparation to pump it out to the body).    The first two systolic measurings are perfectly normal. The third may be a bit low, but looking at your first two readings, you seem to have low blood pressure in general so it may or may not be normal. Everyone has their own "normal" blood pressures, so even though the "ideal" is 120/80, there is definitely some variation. For example, mine is roughly 110/75, even though I have a friend who is almost consistently something like 90/60 (we're both about 20-years-old). Even though hers is much lower, she doesn't feel any ill effects of it and so, for her, this is normal yet if her BP went up to the "ideal" 120/80, it would be considered high for her.    One other possible explanation is the blood pressure monitor itself - is it accurate? Try using other monitors if possible and see what happens.    However, the dizziness, loss of vision, and extreme pressure when standing up should not really happen and could possibly be related to low blood pressure. Have you ever brought up these things with a doctor? You might want to ask next time you see one.|`|HQPvKObxaa	The answer above sounds to be right on. I am a runner and my blood pressure is the same. Usually, the healthier your heart is, the lower your blood pressure should be, within certain limits. It just means your heart doesn't have to work as hard to deliver blood. I get light headed when I stand up every once in a while, and low blood pressure together with low blood sugar could make you lightheaded more often.

A lot of exercise and sporting activities can cause it to break, and im sure there are others things that also cause it to break.

I assume you smoke a lot of it because of the symptoms you describe. It's so boring to hear but the only cure is to come off of it. Go and see your GP and explain exactly how you feel and that you genuinely want help then he/she will organise the help you need.

I have smoked loads of weed in the past so I don't believe that has anything to do with how you feel - that is just an object that any shrink will point the finger at when they have no other answer - it's a cop out!    It is hard to tell the difference between anxiety & depression.  They are two separate issues that can form into one.    Your already seeking help so that's a step in the right direction.

KLlz9gehaa	I am sorry to say that it really depends on the insurance company.  Under my previous plan, my gyno was considered a normal copay.  Now we have new insurance and if the doctor is not the primary it is considered a specialist.  You should be able to go on the insurance company website and look up your doctor and see what they would fall under.  If you are saying that the plans you are looking at are not that great...my best guess would be that the gyno would be considered a specialist.|`|91b09670aebeb0265399e72e36e6b3c0aa	Yes, gynecology does fall under a specialist.

BykL0txuaa	Good night.    As for the nightmares, if they are happening more than once a week, then you most likely do have some sort of stress or trouble in your life that doesn't leave your mind.  Self analysis helps, figuring out what's wrong and then confronting it and fixing it to the best of your ability.  If it can't be fixed, it's a matter of acceptance of the situation, doing your best to negate the consequences as much as possible.       One thing that might help is exercise.  Personally, I hate exercise, but I find that physical exertion helps me fall into a deeper sleep, which reduces the chances of nightmares that I'll remember.  Also, since nightmares occur during REM sleep, it might help to sleep an hour or so less. Set your clock to wake you earlier than usual.  Even though you are more prone to falling back to sleep, it brings your level of consciousness up a bit and might prevent the nightmares from occuring.      One last thing that might help you is creating some sort of story or 'movie' in your mind, letting yourself do this until you fall asleep.  Even though you'll still go into REM, it might alter your thoughts enough to give you pleasant dreams instead.  If you dont feel you have a creative imagination to do this, fall asleep thinking of a favorite scene in a non-scary or dramatic movie.  Picture the actors, scenes, etc in your mind and do your best to recall their lines.  Sometimes you might even want to try changing the outcome of those scenes in your head to suit what you would have liked to have happen in that movie.  Eventually, your mind will let you drift to sleep, but hopefully with more pleasant things occupying your brain and perhaps stimulating more welcome dreams.    All these things work for me and also give me a creative outlet that I usually don't have time for during the day.   Give it a try. It might help.    Good luck.|`|AA10175188	hullo  having recurrent nightmares means you have an unresolved conflict,which needs a psychological help.  nightmares is an indirect way of your unconscious to tell you something,but in a symbolised way,dream interpretation might help.  good night.

sjNtpR1Faa	You should seek counseling yourself. A therapist will be able to help you as you work to help your friend. While it is utterly important that you are there for your friend, you need to understand that she's the only one responsible for herself. She needs to see a psychologist, yes, but until she reaches a point of recognition within herself, she will continually make excuses and avoid therapy. Give her the number of a suicide hotline, though, and help her get involved in things that will enrich her life rather than erode it. Go for a walk with her, take her out for coffee or lunch - avoid alcohol with her. It's a depressant and only makes things worse.

It isn't.  First of all, to be admitted to a psych hospital you have to be a danger to yourself or to someone else or be in really serious shape and need immediate medication therapy.  But by that point most people are already considering suicide.  Second, it is very boring.  If your not attending group therapy your left with down time which becomes very boring.  You cannot leave the unit unless you have permission from your doctor and usually that is not granted for at least 3 days after admission.  I could go on and on.  If your looking for a vacation don't commit yourself.  You'd be better off sitting in front of the TV for a week eating Cheetos's than go t a psych hospital.

When I "admitted" myself I was thinking-no wait I wasn't thinking I just wanted to "off" myself and anyone else around me very quickly. In the psych ward the only thing to do is to either sit, sleep, eat, medicate, and walk around and then sleep somemore. The only real excitement "if you can sense excitement maybe you shouldn't be in there" is hoping that the psychiatrist who visit you in the wee hours of the morning will hep you get better so you can get out. It's not only fun it's also dangerous there are people in there who would love to cause physical harm to you if you so much as look at them wrong. And one of those people go beserk you get to go into lockdown and listen to banging, screaming, and slam of the isolation doors. No tv, no answers to your problems, no nothing!

For instance if you BMI is high than your average weight would need to be higher.  Breast size and genetics also play a large roll in this.  Numbers don't matter.  I am 14, a  vegetarian, and 5'7" and I weigh 145 lbs. Sure that number looks big, but when you wouldn't think overweight if you saw me.  You can't ask anyone if that is considered fat, normal, or skinny.  Today's society is all about the woman who starve themselves.  As long as you are happy with the body that you have, who cares if you are "normal, fat, or skinny."  You only get one body and untill you are 18, you have to live with the one you got.

Feeling Good By Dr David Burns  check out the book review here  http://www.associatedcontent.com/article...|`|b8b495043b4a78d29fbf83e9e71c230baa	When I decided it was time to treat my depression, I sought advice from my General Practitioner/Internist.  He referred me to a Psychiatrist that he felt would be able to treat me properly.  This was one of the best decisions that I made on my way to recovery!  Best of luck to you, as I know how difficult depression can be.|`|iVABotNsaa	Yes, you should ask for help. Don't take medication, talk to your friends and family, if you have none, talk to a work colleague or complete stranger, talking about your issues is the best way of acknowledging that there is a problem.|`|GwHJgcfjaa	A general practitioner or psychiatrist can make a diagnosis and write a prescription.|`|E87JwnACaa	see a medical doctor|`|zhbCKkkraa	i have had bipolar for 2 yrs. well, i went to my family doc and he put me on meds until i went to a therapist....good luck|`|3Zxn5ih0aa	I recommend you go and see some one other than a college councilor, I am not knocking them but going to see someone private is usually the right thing to do if you think you may have a problem. Also most of the time any therapist will want you to try other things before they will put you on medication, there are different herbs out there, St Johns wart and Melatonin, which are mood stabilizers which have helped quite a few people with mild to moderate depression, and anxiety disorders. I have had Generalized anxiety disorder from age 7 and I am now 23, my psychiatrist tried everything imaginable before she put me on meds, but that was also because of my young age. My recommendation is go and see councilor/psychiatrist, they will be able to diagnose you and evaluate what you guys should do from there! I really hope this helps you hun, and good luck in finding the help that you need.

The composition of flatus varies dramatically among individuals. Flatulence produces a mixture of gases with the following five as major components:[1]        * carbon dioxide,      * hydrogen,      * hydrogen sulfide      * methane,      * nitrogen, and      * oxygen.      The flammability of bodily gases has caused serious problems in the medical operating room and also in animal slaughterhouses. There have been many reports in the medical literature of "life-threatening explosions" in patients undergoing electrocautery of colon polyps or other lesions.[13] In one case, the explosion resulted in a six-inch (15 cm) hole in the patient's large intestine. However, the hole was repaired, and the patient recovered.[14]|`|X0SrgdoJaa	yes farts are Methane  Methane is flammable|`|05kAf2DZaa	haha look up videos of it on youtube i wouldnt try it, youll see why|`|KTtJYq4waa	no, you don't generate enough "flamibility" |`|xJu9URe2aa	You most certainly can.

And stomach ache is caused by you womb contracting to clean itself out after the breakdown of tissue.

New research from the NIH shows that adding an antidepressant on to a mood stabilizer does not significantly help.    See the following:    http://www.nimh.nih.gov/press/stepbd-psy...    http://www.nimh.nih.gov/press/stepbd-med...      Good luck!|`|fUoiMk85aa	Some medications prescribed for mental illness can react in different ways with an individual's biochemistry. Your biochemistry can also change, especially if you're still growing (I don't know your age). Other factors may influence the effect a specific chemical has on your body, sometimes reactions with other chemicals in there as well. A friend of mine on lithium went manic when her boyfriend gave her Ritalin - she couldn't take it. Are there any other medications that you're on recently that could be fighting with the Lamactil?    However, more than likely, you should be on another medication if you find the mania disturbing. If you enjoy the mania and it's not hurting you and you're not actually hit with a severe low - it's your call. Being a bit manic may suit you, as long as you're not going out and doing things that you'd regret. I can get a little manic now and then and I'm not even bipolar (as far as I know) and sometimes it helps! It's your decision.|`|AA12050379	A friend of mine that is a psychiatrist said they commonly use Lamictal for rapid cycling Bipolar and Borderline Personality Disorder.  I recently read a study saying they are one in the same.  Not sure about that.    Anyway, best to talk to your doc about if it is the right meds.

First 10 seconds of exercise energy is fuelled my anaerobic energy, without oxygen, uses proteins. Second energy system used after this 10 seconds is aerobic, with energy, used for long distance. After strenuous exercise depending on fitness level, depletion of glycogen (carbohydrate component) causes the lactic acid energy system to kick in, tiring muscles. This depletion of glucose from carbs means that the body needs refuelling.  Goodluck.|`|82359ab5eb2bec5d95da9132c032f006aa	We all have glucose in our blood because the body uses glucose for energy. Normally, the body breaks food down into glucose and sends it into the bloodstream.    Simply put...    It's because your blood sugar drops:...you need to keep a simple snack with you that will help boost it back up and not get you to that point or eat a small snack before you exercise.  Something simple as a piece of fruit, some granola or even drinking some gatorade will help.  |`|k4B68Fcqaa	Hello,           Feeling sick after strenuous exercise is basically your body telling you it is exhausted and needs fuel. You have fatigued your energy sources - burnt out. You need to replenish your body pre - exercise and this means carbohydrates and water. Carbs are a humans fuel/energy source. Best thing you could do is eat porridge 30 mins before you exercise, a banana, flapjack and drink water. Try it and see how you go. I see fatigue in the gym constantly, but being sick is rare, as every one fuels their body before they exercise.    Claire|`|z84nSZRgaa	I would say it's related to dehydration, not so much inhibited by drinking water or fluids, as body exercise detracts from devoting energy to the digestive process, and more towards cooling the body.    When the body does go back to the digestive process after a workout, there are hormonal imbalances, stress factors, as well as an abundance of waste products that need to be eliminated and moved downstream so to speak.  Sugars and salts in drinks and other combinations have to be stabilized, and in that process, one gets nausea.  Dizziness arises from oxygen starvation, either from exercise while out of top condition, or too much exercise.  One has to look for the happy medium.  too much exercise is just as harmful as not enough.

Anyway, I am a part-time artist and I can tell you that for me personally, the act of painting, sculpting or the creative process itself is usually:    My soul's expression of positive feelings and emotions in a non-verbal way --love, excitement, lust, happiness  ---and when I'm not feeling these things but creating anyway, I'm just doing it to bide my time until one of those feelings reappear, then I get more enjoyment out of the creative/creation process.|`|AA12050379	I don't have Bipolar, but it gives me an avenue to increase concentration and lose thoughts of worry and stress.

Please avoid the medications. I have tried them, even two at a time, and more than once. I fail to see any benefit other than the fact that you are doing SOMETHING and are receiving some support from other people. Start by walking alone and concentrate on yourself. Shortly, you will find that others will ask to join you.   As a pharmacist, I have to ask if you are on any medications, such as cholesterol or high blood pressure? All of these drugs have mental side effects.  Pharmacist who's life was almost ruined by Lipitor|`|neNfeluIaa	See your medical doctor about some possible medication.

AA11957106	No. The old rule of thumb has always been 6 weeks to a noticeable difference  Abdominal work can occur daily but large muscles like the hams' (back of the thigh) should be hit hard and then allowed a day of recuperation.  You mention muscle mass, unless you are doing the lunges with heavy weight and few reps you are unlikely to see an increase in mass.
AA11968070	I know how hard it is to not have a conversation in a club, with a stranger, result in a life decision.   A constant struggle for most of us.      An 18 year old, with a mental health issue, and poor judgment, wants to have a baby because tomorrow isn't promised to anyone.  Profound!

The doctors who made the product did a very good job marketing it and made it into a 3 step program that people will use. they made it appealing to use, but it's not magic. if it works ,great but sometimes acne can be stubborn  and then you need to see a doctor about getting prescription meds that are stronger
Hq6nSl1Qaa	Water retention can be an issue with sodium.  Sea salt is still predominantly cationic sodium with anionic chloride.  Consider Morton's Lite Salt.  By mass, it contains more potassium than sodium.  Potassium is the ying to sodium's yang.  Potassium helps rid the body of excess sodium and water, resutling in less swelling of tissues.    If you have a problem with this product, you should consider allergies to iodine, which are very rare.  If you are allergic to shell fish, you should consider avoiding sea salt.  But that is all I can really help you with considering the information given.

6756a9e882909560e251b6d0588a0939aa	During your child's adolescent growth spurt, his or her bones grow rapidly. If your child is involved in a lot of running and jumping activities during this time, he or she is at risk of developing Osgood-Schlatter disease (tibial tuberosity apophysitis), an overuse syndrome that causes pain, swelling and tenderness just below the kneecap.    Osgood-Schlatter disease occurs more often in athletic kids than in nonathletes, affecting as many as one in five adolescent athletes. The condition develops most often in boys ages 13 to 14 and girls ages 10 to 11. It is slightly more common in boys.    Having Osgood-Schlatter disease can be frustrating, because your child may need to limit his or her running and jumping activity level for a short time. But the condition is temporary  usually lasting six to 24 months  and as your child's bones finish growing, the pain should go away.

c1a6ce921c2e8e95f52d8b09d6719cfbaa	I have the same exact problem except mine is sleeping at night. It's actually not that uncommon many people suffer from a  form of sleeping disorder. Depending on the severity, you just might be forced to take some type of medication for it. However, usually people cant sleep because they have to much on their mind, your body wont rest if your mind is still working hard. Try not thinking so much about stressful thing at night and try talking more with other people about things that may be bothering you. Also, you can try tracking back on what you did before you went to bed.... Did you eat? what did you eat? Do you do something on a regular basis that perhaps unknowingly affects the way   sleep at night?    My best advice is to try and relax, you can try working out before  bedtime and taking a nice warm bath... Just try and relax your mind...don;t think about things to much.    *music is always good|`|14ef90c45c56ed0da7e09f4e001cba4eaa	If you sleep 5 hours and you wake up tired ; it may have nothing to do the amount of sleep.

Or may with the nature of your job .  If you expect some one to help you with out knowing other facts about your life. Then your a lucky person if you  solve this problem.|`|nc0s3558aa	What I can suggest are taking shower before u go to sleep, then relax yourself, don't think of anything, including works or personal stuff, or may be you can try to drink some warm milk.

0fe9d26d3ab113994eb89efb591a21f2aa	Men love sex and eating, but not all of them are aware of the fact that food they have can improve their sexual health. The point is that some food products enhance male sexual potence, greatly increase libido and help maintain sexual activity at any age. It does not matter whether you suffer from lack of energy or atherosclerosis or simply want your body to produce high quality sperm. Make some changes in your diet! This will considerably improve your sexual health and sex life in future    Food product:Eggs    Effect: you enjoy sex longer  This will be your third date with this pretty girl whom you met in laundry. Your agitation tortures you : Is she going to have sex with me? What does she expect me to do in bed?. Relax and try to calm down your nerves, to say nothing of other parts of your body. Even if you are going to take her to a restaurant, have dinner before your date. In your case the best dinner is any sort of egg dish. Fried eggs, omelet or boiled eggs  all these dishes are a perfect source of vitamin B which helps to get rid of stress and nervousness and positively influences sexual health as well as health in general.    Being worried, nervous or depressed usually means lack of vitamin B. Always have enough amount of this vitamin. It will make you calm and self-confident. No early ejaculation! Have fun!  Food product: Vanilla ice-cream    Food product: Vanilla ice-cream  Ice-cream is a product which increases erection duration. Ice-cream is reach in calcium and phosphor  two minerals increasing libido and generally improving sexual health.

The fact is that muscles responsible for ejaculation need calcium to contract properly.    But choose vanilla ice-cream, rather than another one, lets say chocolate.

I've been tracking calories since mid-June, and have lost 25  .  I'm not one to "diet", and I love to eat, but I got to the end of my rope and was miserable with myself.  Some useful tools are the calorie diary/tracker, and the Calorie King books that give nutritional information on nearly every restaurant, and all food types.  We eat out more than most, and I've done it through out this entire weight loss.

Try everyday to smile and laugh, LAUGHING is super helpful. It seems weird but it does! =) Try to follow a 1600 calorie diet.   It's best to have 5 meals a day that way you need get to hungry because that leads to over eating.     Here is a couple ideas to help you get started:    Breakfast:   Oatmeal and a piece of wheat toast w/ 2tsp. trans free margarine. -OR- Strawberry Banana Smoothie (In a blender process until smooth, 1 small banana, 1/2 cup strawberries, 1/2 cup fat free milk, 1/2 cup low fat plain yogurt, 2 tsp. honey, and 1 or 2 ice3 cubes. You can have your smoothie with 1 or 2 pieces of whole wheat toast. -OR- An egg on a piece of wheat toast with salsa (make 2 servings) ---If you are still huingry at breakfast have a small piece of fruit.   Lunch:  1 cup soup (water based not cream base) and a Cheese and Tomato Sandwich: 2 slices whole wheat bread, 2 slices reduced fat cheese, mustard and sliced tomato. -OR_ instead of the tomato sandwich 2 pieces whole wheat with 2 slices of Turkey and Mustard. -OR- A Lean Cuisine Frozen Meal (These are actually very tasty. The meat is delicious.   Dinner: 1 piece Chicken Breast with 2 side dishes: 1 cup steamed veggies, 1 sweet potato, 3/4 cup corn, 3/4 cup butternut squash, etc.  Dessert:  Light Ice Cream or Frozen Yogurt:  3/4 cup with no more than 110 calories per 1/2 cup topped with tablespoon chocalate syrup.   Snacks:  Steamed Veggies, fruit, any nuts (these are great protein),   my personal favorite snack is Light and Fit 60 calorie yogurt cup with a 100 calorie Granola Bar. (I cruch up the Granola Bar and put it inside of my yogurt.)  Also there are alot of great ideas if you go to fast food for example....   Wendys: Ultimate Chicken Grill Sandwich- 390 calories    McDonalds:  Caesar Salad grilled Chicken-220 calories  Bacon Ranch Salad w/grilled chicken 260 calories  Salad Dressing: Vinaigrette: 40 calories  Salad Dressing: Italian : 60 calories  Fruit and yogurt Parfait: 160 calories  Chicken McNuggets: (4) 170 cal. (6) 250 cal. (10) 420 cal.  (if you have sauce stay away from Ranch)    KFC:  Original Recipe Chicken Sandwich: (no sauce) 320 calories  Honey BBQ Sandwich: 300 calories  Snacker: 320 calories  Honey BBQ Snacker: 220 calories  Small Mac and Cheese: 180 calories  Small Potato Salad: 180 calories  Small Potatoes and Gravy: 130 calories  Roasted BLT salad: 210 calories  TenderRoast Filet Meal: 360 calories  Lil Bucket Strawberry ShortCake: 200 calories    Burger King:  Chicken Whopper no mayo: 410 calories    Jack N The Box:  Southwest Chicken Pita:230 calories  Chicken Fajita Pita: 300 calories  Beef Taco: 160 calories  Chipotle Chicken Sandwich: 390 calories  Bacon Chicken Sandwich: 440 calories    Carls Jr:  Charbroiled Chicken Sandwich: 370 calories    Taco Bell:  Nacho Chicken Gordita: 270 calories  Nacho Steak Gordita: 270 calories  Taco: 170 calories    Subway :(THE BEST CHOICE)  You can have any of the under 6 grams of fat sandwiches! They're delicious just No MAyo. My favorite is Sweet Onion Chicken Teriyaki. I like to get a foot long and have a 6' for lunch and a 6' for dinner.    Also make sure you do 30 minutes of excercise 5 days a week. I like to walk to the store and back instead of drive =)    This was just some ideas to help you on your way.     Also its great to drink one glass of water before eating. Water is very important!|`|29b8664ffee1eb9eeafea52e63781458aa	Meth!!!|`|d58a6403dec3c9ba123894eda738a57caa	Hi,    Eating less of fat and sugar, doing exercise daily and taking some safe herbal supplements like guggul or garcinia is the way to lose extra pounds.

This ensures that we get the correct amount of the drug, it some of the active drug is lost then we may end up taking less than the desired amount of drug and this can sometimes lead to adverse effects. This is more commmon for tablets, rarely it is seen for capsules. Other reasons could be for protection, to preventing the tablets from breaking.|`|AA11591306	I think its to absorb any moisture that comes inside the bottle, or the air in the bottle, like if it sweats inside, so that the pills stay dry.

b5326a736dc72398379e2e96b682c555aa	a helpful article....  Breaking the Cycle of Anxiety...  http://www.antidepressantsfacts.com./bef...    Many people who are actually diagnosed as being depressed are  actually suffering from anxiety. The human body is built to deal  with stress in the short term and stress only becomes a problem when  one has forgotten how to deal with it and is unable to switch off.    Anxiety can express itself through a number of different symptoms  including panic attacks, fast pulse, shallow breathing, headaches,  insomnia, irritability, uncontrollable muscle twitches, trembling,  tightness in throat, dry mouth and problems with speech etc.    Most people have suffered some form of panic at some time.  Definitions of a panic attack vary. Learning to use abdominal  breathing as first aid for panic sensations is invaluable.    In order to cope with anxiety and the feelings that go with it, it  is vital to understand the flight and flight response and then to  learn how to keep it under control so that it is kept for situations  where and when the flight or flight response is really required.    It is important to understand that the body still functions in a  very prehistoric way with regard to anxiety. The way the reaction  works is as if we were still being chased by tigers or wolves and  needed to constantly run for our lives.    However, today, most of our problems are about finance,  relationships and jobs. None of these problems are solved by running  for one's life or by standing and fighting.    Quite simply, the brain can not differentiate between a life  threatening danger and a much lessor stress.    The flight or flight response is based on adrenalin, the hormone of  fear.    Adrenalin works by 'prioritising' the blood supply, making sure that  oxygenated blood is available in the arms and legs, for a quick  getaway and also through the brain to help make split second  decisions.    The blood supply is taken from areas where it is not needed in times  of danger such as the stomach and sexual organs, because if one is  in a life threatening situation, they are not going to stop and eat  a meal or have sex. This is why when someone is continually  stressed, they may feel sick, unable to eat and may go off sex.    The body tends to act inappropriately to everyday stresses and  adrenalin production may be unnecessarily initiated in response to a  minor stress.    A chain reaction is then set in motion - one starts to sweat, feel  sick and suffer palpitations and the whole stress response takes  over. One then starts worrying about the way they are feeling and  this then exaggerates their anxiety and a chain reaction then  begins.    When tranquillisers are taken, their effect is to surpress the  body's natural response. This can lead to severe problems, apart  from the adverse/side effects of the drugs themselves.    Firstly, the stress response can be useful at times when we are  presented with real danger but tranquillisers make those taking them  lose this response.    Secondly, the speed of reactions to everyday stimuli can be reduced  as can the reactions necessary for driving and operating machinery  safely.    Thirdly, long term use of tranquillisers causes the surpressed  adrenalin reflex to start to activate again and this results in  rebound anxiety.    Ideally the stress response should switch on and off when necessary.  In  simplistic terms the sympathetic nervous system and the autonomic  nervous system work in conjunction with one's feelings, ie. fear and  the parasympathetic response turns it off and allows the individual  to return to peacefulness again.    However, often the sympathetic symptoms get out of control leaving  the individual in a state of red alert all the time. This situation  is very unhealthy and puts strain on the mind and body and when it  continues  constantly can lead to depression.    A continual stress response puts a strain on the heart and raises  the blood pressure largely due to hormones and chemical reactions  which do not let up as they would in a reacting situation.    It is therefore important to break the vicious circle and learn to  manage one's anxiety successfully.    It is not possible in everyday life to avoid situations which can  cause  one to feel anxious. However, there are a number of sources from  which relief can be obtained and help the individual to control it,  for example, acupuncture, counselling, stress management, regular  exercise etc.    Anxiety management is relatively easy to do and can be carried out  by  everyone. One of the simplest things to do is to learn to breathe  correctly as this helps to reduce adrenalin production.    Generally speaking, we all breathe very shallowly which is a natural  habit that everyone falls into. This shallow breathing can lead to  the  wrong levels of carbon dioxide and oxygen in one's blood. When this  happens, the brain interprets this shallow breathing as an  indication of  danger. One needs to learn to breathe more deeply and to get air  right  down to the bottom of one's lungs. When air reaches this part of  one's  lungs, correct gas exchange occurs.    Correct breathing can be achieved by expanding one's abdomen, then  drawing air into one's lungs. One should then hold this for about  three  seconds. Once the three seconds have passed, one should release  their  breath slowly. One should not feel concerned if they feel s|`|539234e646f221d76fcd83d56b13dd48aa	Swami Sukhabodhananda  RSS Feeds| SMS ASTRO to 8888 for latest updates       One youngster comes to me very depressed and asks this question "Why is God creating so many difficulties for us? How to handle stress?" I tell this youngster to reflect on this beautiful story:     A man goes to a shop, picks up a beautiful cup and says "my god this cup is so beautiful" and suddenly the cup starts talking to the man. The cup starts saying "O man, I am beautiful right now, but what was the state of my being before the pot-maker made me a beautiful pot?     Before I was sheer mud and the pot-maker pulled me out of the mud from the mother earth and I felt why that pot-maker is so cruel, he has separated me from mother earth. I felt a tremendous pain. And the pot-maker said, "Just wait." Then he put me and churned me, when I was churned I felt so giddy, so painful, so stressful, I asked the pot-maker "Why are you so cruel?" the pot-maker said, "Just wait." Then he put me into a oven and heated me up, I felt completely burnt. There was tremendous pain and I asked the pot-maker "Why are you so cruel?" and the pot-maker said, "Just wait."     Then he poured hot paint on me and I felt the fume and the pain, I again asked the pot-maker "Why are you so cruel?" and the pot-maker said, "Just wait." Then again he put me into an oven and heated it to make me more strong, I felt life is so painful hence pleaded the pot-maker and the pot-maker said, "Just wait." And after that the pot-maker took me to the mirror and said, "Now look at yourself". And surprisingly I found myself so beautiful.     When god gives us lot of trouble, it appears god is very cruel but we need patience and we have to wait. When bad things happen to good people, they become better and not bitter.     So all difficulties are part of a cosmic design to make us really beautiful. We need patience, we need understanding, we need the commitment to go through in a very calm and wise way. So all difficulties are not to tumble us but to humble us.     With this understanding, let us not be against difficulty. Understand difficulty is a part of a purifying process. A purifying process at present which we cannot understand and hence we need faith and we need trust.     Let us understand how to handle stress with this background. You can be affected by stress from two angles. There is an internal stress and there is an external stress. Nobody can avoid stress; one has to only manage stress. Managing stress can be internal and also external.     The internal stress is; your thoughts can create stress, your values can create stress, and your beliefs can create stress, meaning thereby your stress is coming from your mind more from the outer world. Many people suffer not from heart attack - they suffer from thought-attack.     For example, when somebody says you are an idiot, we get so hurt, we get so victimised. My boss has called me an idiot and I am feeling tremendous pain. Now where does this stress come from? If my boss has called me an idiot, I have to ask myself "am I an idiot"?     If I am an idiot nothing to be upset about; and if I am not an idiot, then also nothing to be upset about! It is the perception of the boss. But why do we suffer from that stress? I suffer not because my boss has called me an idiot but because of the thought-attack.     I may say the boss has called me an idiot; therefore I am suffering? It is true that the words are unpleasant. But what hurts is the interpretation of the unpleasant word. The thought in me interprets. That is pain and therefore it becomes pain. Much of our stress is our mind interpreting it as pain. So we suffer from thought-attack more than heart attack.|`|7684a7ed9de7f8216af5dd5ef8524cffaa	Have a doctor check you out for the following:    Hyperinsulinemia (high insulin) - a fasting blood insulin test - if your result is 10 or more then your additional symptoms may be related to the conditions this condition can cause.

face2844ff1f5cbd7897e7b5a8526d71aa	I have polycystic ovarian disease.      This led to me also having a condition called secondary amenorrhea, where at first I would skip months of period and then have it regularly for a while.  It then stopped for over 6 months.  I went to the doctor to have it checked out and that is when I was diagnosed with PCOS.    My PCOS and ammenorrhea has been controlled by the birth control pill for many years now.     I was told by my doctor that it is very common for people who have conditions with cysts to have irregular periods.

I had one when I was 26.  It caused me lots of pain, heavy periods, sometimes prolonged.  Depending on whether it is large enough to remove, she needs to check it out and have it removed.   If it's the dissolving type, then she should be on birth control to regulate her period.  Hopefully she has gotten checked out by a doctor, OBGYN.

Unfortunately, most are completely wrong about this and simply have a difficulty focussing on certain things simply due to no practicing. Not to say that you don't have it, but I wouldn't guarentee yourself into it.    Here is something interesting for you. There's a condition called sleep apnea that is actually much more common than most people think. If anyone has ever told you that you snore, or if you ever wake up out of breath, have dreams you can't breath, etc. then you more than likely have it. Basically, in the most common form, obstructive sleep apnea blocks your airways while you're sleeping for a couple seconds here and there and can be detrimental to your quality of sleep.    That can definately appear to be insomnia. I've suffered with this for quite sometime, and get a broken 6 hours of sleep nightly, have trouble falling asleep, etc, as it hasn't been treated yet.    What you may find even more interesting on this subject is that many sleep apnea patients have shown some or all of the symptoms of ADHD without hyperactivity, almost to the tee. It is something you may consider checking out, and the fix would cure both, yes.    If it isn't sleep apnea, and you DO have ADHD without hyperactiity (I reccomend being tested for this before coming to that conclusion), then it is possible that the medication will level you out and allow a more normal sleep schedule, but is by no means guarenteed.    Well, it was a read, but hopefully interesting enough to get through!

I recommend that people eat right and exercise. However, if they would like a little "help", I suggest using natural Hoodia (it's important to note that not all Hoodia works well, even if the bottle says "pure" or "standard").    The Hoodia sold at http://tinyurl.com/y389on is in my opinion the best Hoodia on the market.

e036cbc68471e304ef8dbb200c884d87aa	Improving self esteem takes time, but you are on the right track.  Don't compare yourself to the other girls at the gym - compare yourself today to the way you were BEFORE the gym.  You've lost 15 pounds - good!  Have you been keeping track of how long you can exercise before you need a rest?  I bet you have more endurance now.  Did you keep any of your old pants?  Put a pair on and see how loose they are.  Celebrate the success.    You know what else might help?  Realizing that thin, pretty or popular girls aren't all that happy no matter what you might think.  I've been fat and I've been thin and let me tell you thin is not the answer to everything.  You do feel healthier when you are in shape, but you'd be surprised at how much it can mess up your love life.  When I was thin, I never knew if a boy really liked me or if he was just after the hot chick.  When I put on some weight if a boy asked me out I knew he really liked ME.    And finally, a little story to put things in perspective.  I was probably the least popular girl in high school.  One boy actually told me he would have liked to date me but he would have been ashamed to be seen with me!  Fast forward 5 years - I had an engineering degree and made good money.  I was taking my handsome boyfriend out for a fancy dinner on his birthday and surprise surprise - our WAITRESS was one of the oh so popular girls from my school.  She was in a dead end loser job and there I was with money and a hunky well dressed boyfriend.  Trust me - things get better.|`|05e38e91f4cd0b0e283c7f25160c75cdaa	Sounds like you're doing A LOT RIGHT.  You are taking care of you.

Possibly, at your local library, you could assist in shelving books. or  tutor at an after school program. or visit the elderly at a nursing home.. read a book or just be a good listener.  Also, volunteering to read a book in the children's ward at a local hospital would really boost your self-esteem.

This is called your self perceived image.    you must learn to like yourself from within. the external factors are too unreliable because people's opinion's of you are just like the weather(it changes from time to time).     remember everything begins projecting from the inside-to the- outside.    yes, you may have a weight problem. but remember that is solvable. take it step by step. you must have determination.   look at you, you've already lost 15 lbs. i think you did great! you've already accomplished your first step. WHAT IS STILL NOT POSSIBLE?i once you took out the first step it's easier to move onwards. if you 're willing to stick to your plan you will lose the weights a little by a little, eventually just like setting little goals.       but most important of all it's how you see yourself, not how others see you. learn to have self respect. go out and do some courageous acts a little at a time that you normally wouldn't do, this is a proven method up self confidence.     there was a show i saw on tv awhile ago who was originally very beautiful interms of society standards, but no matter what they dont like that person they see in the mirror so they did plastic surgery's on their face one after the other, but at the end it led to nowhere. Because the root of the problem is their self perceived image, they didn't like themselves to begin with.     Most important of all is how you see youself, not how others see you. If you learn to like yourself, accept yourself, who you are on the inside will naturally project outwards and others will eventually grow to like you.     and seriously 15 lbs  that's not a small number. that's quite hard to achieve already and you've already done it. i think you're doing a great job. so dont give up and learn to like and respect yourself so others will like and respect you.|`|AA10464598	Hon, YOU do NOT need to see a therapist.  That's like paying all of us here on Y!Answers for our responses. You should rest in knowing that you are taking the right steps toward changing your body image. NOW DO NOT GET ME WRONG HERE: your outward appearance is NOT all that matters; I am just coming from the angle that you seem to believe that your esteem stems from being overweight.  You don't have to cater to the world's idea of how you should look or feel; you are already priceless in the eyes of GOD. Priceless beyond measure because the Lord made you, designed you and crafted u JUST as HE saw fit. HE loves you without end, and when you receive Jesus as your personal Savior, your outlook on the world, and likewise, its outlook on you~~~~WILL change dramatically.  When others see the light that emanates from you, from walking with Christ, and from the perfect peace that HE gives you....they will want that too.  All of the plastic surgeries, wardrobe changes and make up in the earth cannot even come close what you will find in Christ; eternal love, acceptance, mercy and peace of mind.  You are in my prayers.........|`|a223d61cc088901677201322cefef7e5aa	i think you should be proud of yourself that you are going to the gym and the endorphines that you are releasing will help with the depression.  you only have about 9 days until you see your therapist but if it is really bad perhaps call her and see if she can schedule you sooner or even have a phone session.  i know that 16 is a hard age especially high school but remember one day you will look back and laugh about all the stuff that you are upset about right now.  i used to be depressed all throughout high school.  all you need is one good friend and that is the most important thing.  it really is what is on the inside that counts.  i wish i looked like half the woman i see on tv but i don't so i have to deal with it and you are even working out, i am not so kudos to you girl................|`|AA11957106	Give yourself a chance to succeed. Nothing builds self esteem like success.  Set small goals   -I'm going to study hard and get a B (A if your grades are already good) on this test, and do it.  -I'm going to lose 2 more pounds and do it  -I'm going to read that book and do it    I think a lot of poor self image comes from just that. We look at ourselves and don't like what we see.  The ONLY way to change this is obvious.  We must change the way we see ourselves.  Succeed, do better, do more, do faster, etc.  It IS nice to have the support of those we love but, when it all comes down, you are the ONLY one that REALLY counts.   Think about yourself, decide what you don't like and CHANGE it.     I know it's tough.  Good luck and God Bless
2407551647eb5e9a0ebc1101b39b00aaaa	If you apply to Social Security for disability benefits, you will be required to submit proof from your doctor. Then they will likely make you go to their doctor for a second opinion. Physical disability is much easier to prove than mental disability because you can "see" it. You will likely get turned down the first time you apply. Then you appeal and start all over again. The requirement would be that whatever your disability is would render you unable to sustain gainful employment to support yourself. There is a lot of red tape involved. You will have to provide copies of all your medical records at your own expense. If you become eligible, most likely you will be re-evaluated at certain intervals to see if your disability is continuing.|`|AA12050379	You have to be pretty bad off with the current social security guidelines.

AA10099849	Yeah. You basically added more strain to your knee cap, than it is usually accustomed to. You know how you exercise after you haven't for a while, your muscles ache, the same way you did with the squats. You probably don't do squats very often. It is just a matter of getting your bones and muscles used to the exercise. Just remember...your knees are very sensitive and are prone to becoming damaged very quickly. Take care of yourself. :) I think you would want those knees for sometime. :)|`|AA11689215	Oh yeah.  Your ligaments are inflammed.|`|5837884751712d91efdaf0bdbf8ce144aa	okay, as an athletic trainer who works with this everyday at work, it sounds as though you are experiencing patellar tendonitis.  The patellar tendon connects the quadriceps muscles on the top of the thigh to the lower leg.  The kneecap is encapsulated within this ligament.  By doing these squats, you have inflamed the origin site of the tendon, causing the pain you are feeling as you are climbing the stairs.      To help with this I would suggest taking a week or two off from doing any squats.  On a daily basis (preferably 2-3x / day) do an ice massage to the painful area around your kneecap.  (make massage cups by taking styrofoam cups full of water and freezing.  When you use them, tear away the styrofoam and leave a little at the bottom so your fingers don't go numb when doing hte massage).   When you decide to give the squats a try again, you will want to get a patellar tendon strap (you can find this at any decent drugstore, Walmart or Target for about $7-8)    Hope this helps!|`|9d303daecaa6fb139ed81b4d613cb786aa	Knees will always hurt no matter what exercise you do.

Seek help from a mental health therapist that specializes in addictions such as alcoholism as well as a support group like AA meetings.

5187cbf58d5d7f3ab2abca726b610e21aa	Testes "dropping" refers to the testicles descending from their original abdominal location to the scrotal sac. If you have two testicles in your scrotum, your testes have both descended. If you do not have two testes in your scrotal sac by the age of 20, you need to see a doctor, as your risk of testicular cancer is greatly increased.    The scrotum is a muscular sac - in a cold environment, it will contract and bring the testicles closer to the body to maintain warmth. In a warm environment, it will relax and allow the testes to hang further away from the body and stay cooler (the ideal temperature for sperm production is a few degrees colder than regular body temperature). This up and down movement of both testicles in the scrotal sac is not what is meant by "testes dropping," however, and is completely normal.|`|dd1f927248c50b7511137071de2458a5aa	your testicles are very sensitive to changes in he environment.    In those sacs, you have millions of sperm which is stored to make babies. Now, those sperms have to be housed in a constant temperature to preserve them until they come (no pun intended) out.    By design, your testicles are made to adapt to the change in temperature. If its hot, it saggs, if its cold, its nuzzled close against you.    So no worries about it bud. Just let your testicles do the shrinking. They know what to do. The only thing they expect in return is a storage depot worthy of your cargo.      cheers|`|8b37c33087a97a75a2443a5170f9bbc2aa	Nothing wrong. Don't get scared!  They sag when they need to produce gametes.  They generally require to stay a few degrees lower than the body temperature, thats when they sag. When you are cold, they crumple up. All this sagging up happens only to the scrotum, the testes just hang inside.  If they haven't dropped, perhaps it is just late maturation and development of secondary sexual characters.  Consult a doctor if needed.  Good luck!|`|FYHqw8G9aa	ya u should see a doctor.    definitely|`|AA10707775	ey, u mean ur testis all time in shape of shrunk scrotum . in all season, hmmmm. i wil tell u the cause, have un any injury on it,or ur testis is alwasys like this, tell me|`|3751a4b1d4b23b35720ed11a646c06ddaa	Say that's a nutty question , but it sounds normal if the sagging varies throughout the day , your worrying to much .

Also, what kind of weather are you in? What kind of situations aer you feeling them to see if they are hanging nice n steady?  Dont freak out, and if you are really concerned wit hthe issue and feel something is wrong, just see a doc. Worst that happens is they pull your pants down and go "those are perfectly healthy babymakers there son"    Weather and situation questions apply since in cold weather, your scrotum will shrink to keep your testes warm.  And in stressful situations, your testes will "retract", not sure why so ill owe you that.  Finally, waht kinda underwear you use? shorts or tight ones? :p lotsa things to consider.

It probably wouldn't be a pleasant experience, or the most natural gait, but the human body is pretty incredible.  There have been a number of recorded incidences of people walking round with a broken neck for years without knowing.    A lot would depend on the person, the situation and the type and location of the breaks.      For example, a couple of clean breaks to the tibias could be fairly swiftly overcome if you were in a burning building and the adrenaline and noradrenaline kicked in before the smoke inhalation killed you - you'd be able to get yourself out.  However, if you were in some bad accident and had compound fractures of both femurs, you wouldn't be up for a brisk after dinner stroll on the fells...|`|f700f216326c71b93188b9f4f4dba9cdaa	No, not if they are broken.

8f6fbf8cd859c15e94f8ec3588ab74a2aa	If you get that feeling when you get up suddenly, you could have "orthostatic hypotension" where your blood pressure suddenly goes down and the blood rushes away from your brain. bloody pictures can trigger that reaction too. you may feel faint and have buzzing in your ears.  Some people also have a heart valve problem where the valve sort of folds in on itself and you have a litle leakage to or from the heart.  The first one is relatively minor but the second needs some attention from your cardiologist.  You should see your GP and have him listen to you.  Good luck|`|8058900e413ac396fd2acb2120bfca21aa	First of all what are you doing looking at bloody pictures?

5b60cf8bba9d0e82014b5a70f1c32970aa	When you're anorexic it means that you stop eating on purpose so if you're not doing it on purpose then I don't think you are anorexic but if you've been thinking that you WANT to lose weight then you might be anorexic and you should get some professional help or go and see a doctor. . . to me it doesn't seem like your doing it deliberately so I wouldn't worry if I was you.|`|2hQFdy08aa	Generally, eating disorders are characterized by an obsession and fixation with food.  Anorexia's obsession is fitting your life around your eating habbits to survive off as few calories as possible in order to lose weight.  This could mean counting the calories of every tablespoon of cereal you eat, and not eating the next day if you think you ate too much on another day.  This doesn't sound like an obsession with food, just a loss of apetite.  A loss of apetite can be a symptom of many other problems (some sicknesses have symptoms of decreased apetite, as do many medications), and happens sometimes.  There are days when I just don't feel like eating (there was one day that I biked over 20 miles, but I ate only a couple sandwiches for the entire day.  I just didn't feel like it.), and I know friends who are the same way. If the problem really persists, you might want to see a doctor or do some research.  Otherwise, just try to get /something/ down at regular intervals during the day.|`|44fc432c5d1c19f1af4c6c7faacc8c92aa	I think being anorexxic means you dont eat deliberately.

AA10891466	There are other possible things that can raise the CA 125 tests, not just cancer.  I had it happen to me back in 1997.  I had endometriosis and the doctor I was seeing swore up and down that it was cancer, I left him and went to for a 2nd and 3rd opionion and got all sorts of tests done only to find out that it was caused by endometriosis.  To this day, I still have all my insides thanks to this 3rd doctor.  If  I didn't  leave the first one, I would have nothing today.
716f5aa0a1ac8be3d0b4f8f42a3c8988aa	Definition:  Borderline personality disorder is a condition characterized by impulsive actions, mood instability, and chaotic relationships.    Causes, incidence, and risk factors:  Personality disorders are chronic patterns of behavior that impair relationships and work. The cause of borderline personality disorder (BPD) is unknown. People with BPD are impulsive in areas that have a potential for self-harm, such as drug use, drinking, and other risk-taking behaviors.    Risk factors for BPD include abandonment issues in childhood or adolescence, sexual abuse, disrupted family life, and poor communication within the family. This personality disorder tends to occur more often in women and among hospitalized psychiatric patients.    Symptoms:  Relationships with others are intense and unstable, swinging wildly from love to hate and back again. People with BPD will engage in frantic efforts to avoid real or imagined abandonment.    BPD patients may also have uncertainties about their identity or self-image. They tend to see things in terms of extremes, either all good or all bad. Such people also typically view themselves as victims of circumstance and take little responsibility for themselves or their problems.    Other symptoms include:  Frequent displays of inappropriate anger   Recurrent acts of crisis such as wrist cutting, overdosing, or self-mutilation   Feelings of emptiness and boredom   Intolerance of being alone   Impulsiveness with money, substance abuse, sexual relationships, binge eating, or shoplifting     Signs and tests:  Personality disorders are diagnosed based on psychological evaluation and the history and severity of the symptoms.    Treatment:  Self-destructive behavior can be changed in social and therapeutic environments such as group therapy. Peer reinforcement of appropriate behavior may be more successful than one-on-one counseling because difficulties with authority figures often prevent learning in such situations. Group therapy can also be helpful in modifying specific impulsive behaviors.    Medications can help to level mood swings and to treat depression or other disorders which may accompany this condition.|`|AA12050379	Same description as the above post.    Treatments include DBT (by Linehan), medications (such as Limictal) for mood swings, TFP (Transference focused psychotherapy - by Masterson),  Mentalization Based Treatment (by Fonagy), Schema Based Therapy.

However, if you are not willing to opt for that, you can try to undergo surgical myomectomy, in which the fibroids are removed but the uterus remains intact and fertility is preserved.    You can also try non-surgical options if you wish, such as UAE (Uterine Artery Embolization), in which tiny particles are injected into the uterine arteries to block the fibroid's blood supply, or medical suppression such as GnRH agonists (these drugs are temporary at best, not guaranteed to help, and come with potentially massive side effects).    You can also try ultrasound-guided treatment, which focusses strong, high-intensity ultrasound beams on the fibroids and heats them up high enough to literally eradicate them.  U/S-guided treatment is still hard to come by in most gyn office settings, and you may need to search for a specialist.    Whatever you choose, good luck for the optimum outcome.|`|pH4mHZ3Oaa	I guess the permanent solution would be a hysterectomy.

LGA1RRdfaa	El prolapso mitral o prolapso de la valvula mitral es una valvulopatia (cardiopatia valvular) caracterizada por el desplazamiento de una anormalmente engrosada valva de la valvula mitral    La palabra prolapso significa una sobresalida o descenso de una viscera, en este caso la valvula que separa la auricula izquierda del ventriculo izquierdo    La ecocardiografa (eco) es el metodo mas util en el diagnostico del prolapso de la valvula mitral. Las ecocardiografias bi- y tridimensionales son particularmente valiosas por permitir la visualizacion de las valvas mitrales en relacion al anillo mitral. Ello permite medir el grosor de la valva y su desplazamiento en relacion con el anillo mitral    Con mucha frecuencia el electrocardiograma es normal. En algunos casos puede aparecer una ligera depresion inespecifica del segmento ST o una inversion de la onda T con alargamiento del QT en las derivaciones que registran la cara inferior del corazon (DII, DIII y aVF). Estas alteraciones se encuentran con mos frecuencia durante el ejercicio|`|EiE8M7pIaa	Mas especificamente un ecocardiograma y un cateterismo.

Luego un ecocardiograma (ultrasonido del corazn) para determinar si la causa de la arritmia es un problema de la vlvula mitral.  Todo lo anterior debe hacerse con el apoyo de un mdico cardilogo, desde luego.  Yo tengo un prolapso de vlvula mitral detectado por ese medio desde hace 4 a?os. Actualmente tengo un control con medicamentos y dieta especfica y puedo decir que la enfermedad se puede sobrellevar.

Then 4 things you hear, 3 things you feel physically (clothes, blanket, textures, etc.), 2 things you smell and take a deep relaxing breath.

Anxiety is a feeling of being keyed up and extra alert. Your heart may race or you may get "butterflies" in your stomach. You may feel short of breath or generally jittery. You're likely to have a feeling of impending danger. These reactions are the way our bodies prepare to cope with stress. All the senses become tuned up and on alert in the presence of a threat.|`|bebee00e4f3a4e5d156594de8d4a527eaa	Therapy of some kind,perhaps art therapy.

59109015c382b5c23238bec7d9a0c6deaa	Signs and symptoms    Signs and symptoms of post-traumatic stress disorder typically begin within three months of a traumatic event. In a small number of cases, though, PTSD symptoms may not occur until years after the event.    Post-traumatic stress disorder symptoms may include:        * Flashbacks, or reliving the traumatic event for minutes or even days at a time      * Shame or guilt      * Upsetting dreams about the traumatic event      * Trying to avoid thinking or talking about the traumatic event      * Feeling emotionally numb      * Irritability or anger      * Poor relationships      * Self-destructive behavior, such as drinking too much      * Hopelessness about the future      * Trouble sleeping      * Memory problems      * Trouble concentrating      * Being easily startled or frightened      * Not enjoying activities you once enjoyed      * Hearing or seeing things that aren't there    Post-traumatic stress disorder symptoms can come and go. You may have more symptoms during times of higher stress or when you experience symbolic reminders of what you went through. For example, some people whose PTSD symptoms had been gone for years saw their symptoms come back again with the terrorist attacks in the U.S. on Sept. 11, 2001.    When you have PTSD, you may relive the traumatic event numerous times. You may have upsetting memories. Or you may see reminders wherever you go. You may hear a car backfire and relive combat experiences, for instance. Or you may see a report on the news about a rape, and feel again the horror and fear of your own assault.|`|6PSphKylaa	sounds like you do. I'm sorry about the fight. Just tell yourself that you want to turn your life around, that's what I'm trying to do, and you're not gonna be so stressed|`|leRNOgnWaa	You may. Then again you may not. If you really think you do, then you need to go see a profesional. They can tell you if you do or not. Also, if you do they can help you "fix" it or give you some meds to help with the dreams.|`|AA12050379	If the traumatic incident was less than 6 months ago, it is called Acute Stress Disorder... but same thing basically.     You can apply for victims compensation money for treatment and evaluation if you are unable to afford it.    Best wishes.
gpMAkzKSaa	You can come off of it. What has happened is you have become chemically dependent on the drug and the confusion you feel is a withdrawal symptom. This is most likely not permanent if you seek the correct therapy. You have become so used to having the drug that your brain now cannot function as it would if you were on the drug. You will need to relearn how to deal without it. There are many mental health exercises that can be used to strengthen the cognitive and reasoning skills of an individual and in this case I think you would benefit from it greatly. Also coming off medication entirely may not be the answer. There are medications such as welbutrin that have greatly reduced sexual side effect compared to traditional meds such as prozac or Zoloft. Talk to your health care provider about maybe trying one of these medications in place of the Zoloft. Also you didn't mention how you came off the medication. Going cold turkey is not the way to do it. As mentioned before the body must me gradually weaned off of the chemical or severe withdrawals could occur. This is also something I would talk about with a health care provider. You can also ask him about levitra or cialis which can both be used to combat the sexual side effects of the medication you were prescribed.
PEHOP8R3aa	you sir, are an idiot|`|d5aa88d2dd913dea61404e5f13a231acaa	So how's your left side heart?   Since when is there a heart on our right side?  Check this procedure out further for a proper medical answer (there may be situations where this is the only way to get a proper reading??)|`|32dffe7e0eba9eb2c4e6c9418ec99ba5aa	That does seem like an odd technique.  The purpose of the stethoscope is to make it easier to hear things like heartbeat and breathing, and putting the bell on your nipple isn't going to enhance the sound, quite the contrary.  Furthermore, putting the bell on the largest part of your breast (the part under the nipple) doesn't make much sense, since that only pushes it further away from what the doctor needs to hear (heart and lungs).  And still further, putting a cold stethoscope bell on your nipple will tend to make it harden, which will dramatically reduce sound conduction and produce a lot of extra noise in the stethoscope as the bell slides against the nipple.    Ironically, the stethoscope was invented by a doctor who felt embarrassed about putting his ear against a woman's bare breast in order to check heart and lung sounds.|`|daIKnUWwaa	Could this action possibly be, because she was checking your lungs too??  listening to your breathing?? hmmmm???...you should have asked her then and there why she checked you like she did.....nuff said!!!!

0a891969e369f87493f8591fb1ad600daa	Just because something is 'organic' doesn't mean it is 100% organic.  Actually only a certain percentage of the product has to be organic in order for the company to be able to place 'Organic' on the label.  Forgive me for not remembering, but I think it is like 30-40%?      But it just all depends.  Some pesticides that farmers use can be really harmful if consumed in large amounts.  But generally you have to consume LARGE amounts in order to really get affected by it.  But there are some people that are adament about not consuming pesticides.      All in all, organic is technically better.  It's just farmers use the chemicals/pesticides to produce better crops etc.      Organic doesn't have to include the pesticides.   Think about the seedless watermelons, grapes, and other fruits and veggies (that are seedless).  They are altered so that they are seedless.  Thus they aren't 'organic' anymore.|`|b32e560414238926779c6d2630e98a48aa	Organic is not "organic" if the pollen that spreads from other farms germinates the organic farms' seeds. not to mention if the farm is fed by acid rain.|`|SrqZdZoYaa	Yes because we're not filling our bodies with artificial additives

Depro Provera is dangerous and most people dint read up on it before taking it. Furthermore birth control contraceptives have not been studied long enough, to see WHAT the long term (more than a few generations) of effects are. You should go back to normal within a year or two. I have had a few friends who have had some problems but have returned to a fairly normal schedule.

I don't believe in those shots. Having your period is a normal part of a healthy woman's life. We are suppose to have it. I think anything that suppresses that and puts extra hormones into our body is ridiculous and unhealthy. I'd talk to your doctor about it and have a pap test done to make sure everything is normal.|`|Y4MeZjbyaa	When I was on depo, I never had a period.  Once I got off of it, it took me a good 3 months or so to get back to my regular schedule.  However, I was on the shot for a good two years.  It seems strange that the shot would have such a major effect on you after only one dose.  If I were you, I wouldn't be incredibly alarmed, but I would call my doctor and let him know, just in case.  Most likely your body is just taking its time getting back to normal, but a good motto to live by in the feminine health area is "When in doubt, call the doc!"  There are just too many things that could happen....|`|AnJWG5M2aa	Apparently, depo provera just wasn't for you.    Sometimes birth control can mess with you if it's not the right thing for your situation or body.    I would just recommend for you to go to your doctor and tell them.  They can definitely tell you what's wrong.|`|d394deddf7460bf1dcede85f98862daaaa	Depo lasts for 3 to 6 months and it can take a year to get your period back.  It fools your body into thinking you are pregnant.  I had this shot and hated the way I felt too.|`|kZad7BLqaa	you'll get it. Things just have to get back in normal. If you don't get it in November go and see your doctor|`|i41tUVtIaa	I worked at a GYN for 10 years.  Took it in April which would have been due July.  If you didn't get another shot it could take 3 months after it was due (Oct) to 9 months (June 09) for your period to regulate again.  My sister's took almost a year but she took Depo for 4 years.  If you haven't started in like 4 months your GYN might give you Provera to help you start and then get on birth control to help regulate.
18cfe4ae9bfb2f9c9d7167a8c4484e79aa	There are many pros and cons of birth controls(BC)...  Pros  -Birth control is sometimes used to treat people with ovarian cancer and breast cancer.  -If you have an irregular period, BC can help you to regulate the menstrual cycle.  -BC can also help, if you have abnormal cycles when you are young. Some doctors prescribe BC for even 16, 17 year old girls because of this.  -Control PMS (Premenstrual syndrome)  -There are some evidence to prove that some birth control can delay the onset of breast cancer.  -Yes, BC can prevent pregnancy up to 98-99%     Cons  -Some types of BC can cause hormonal imbalance.  -Same can cause you to bleed a lot just after you stop taking it.  -Some women can have long term side effects such as abnormal hormones for rest of their lives (this is less than 1% of the entire world women population)  -Other common health related problems: blood clots, loss of sexual feelings in vaginal area, breast tenderness, ect.  -There are no evidence so far to prove or disprove that BC can cause long term effects to genetic code, but this may be and if it is then it will effect your female offspring (children)     Please note that BC hormonal therapy (modern day pills/anything that release hormones to prevent menstrual cycle) is as old as Egyptian and Indian civilization. There were many oil and herbal stuff that used by women in history. There are no known long term genetic problems and I am about 70% sure there will not be in the future. (Unless we used too much of the hormone stuff)|`|h5xSfcT6aa	pros:  stops you getting pregnant  (condoms) prevent STIs  protects your body generally (no infections, unwanted pregnancy etc)    cons:  CAN make you put on weight (the pill)  COULD make sex a little less enjoyable (condoms), but not much at all, and there are plenty of other methods.      xxx|`|UkOAxlDRaa	i dont see any pros about birth control. honestly i think it is a terrible thing.  there is obviously some reason why you have a period every month for those who take it to have less periods a year.  what it does is i tricks your body into thinking that you are pregnant by using hormones that are produced when you are actually pregnant. Cuz you know you cant get pregnant if you are already ya know?  it puts hormones in your body that shouldn't be there.  that's why when you you take it your face clears up and stuff cuz those hormones.  also you could get blood clots. i know this girl who took birth control and she got a blood clot like in her leg and she had to have it amputated and now she has to take like medication for her blood so it doesn't clot again!  i think it is a useless drug.   |`|b32e560414238926779c6d2630e98a48aa	pros:  an ability to control when you get pregnant, ability to control your menstruation.     cons:  On top of the many side effects (cardiovascular problems, clotting of the blood, high blood pressure, irritability, headaches, nausea among many) birth control has not been tested on multiple generations, judging the long term effects of hormonal manipulation and the effects on reproduction. For all we know it could have adverse future effects and cause a major problem. Let's just say for argument sake that it DOES cause infertility in the future, would you want that for your future generation? |`|yuOuoCfDaa	besides the fact that it "prevents you from getting pregnant.  I dont know any other pros about birth control.  It has so many dangerous side effects.  Like the ones they tell you about and then there are the side effects that just mysteriously happen
4SBdcGPmaa	If the tooth is about to fall out so as it is, putting a veneer on it, a covering of the tooth with advanced materials, will be pointless.  Then you will have a veneer on a tooth that isn't in your mouth.    You will need to consult with a cosmetic dentist and let him look at the tooth in question.  I have veneers on 6 of my front teeth, and I believe they were about $200/tooth (PA).  Veneers are made of advanced materials, which are very hard.  However, your days of eating chewy foods like baguette, Swedish fish, etc. are over.  I have to even wear a soft guard at night to protect them against chipping since I apparently grind my teeth.|`|846c4df40a9384f0d88674d17d267106aa	They usually cost $600 to $1500 depending on where you are located, who your dentist is and which tooth it is. Since you had a root canal done, you may also want to ask your dentist about getting a crown instead, which is sturdier and may be cheaper as you got your root canal done already. |`|qOh5uIj9aa	Not really sure how much they are, but they are expensive. I am replying b/c I think that veneers are great for certain people, but I think braces are the better route. They do take longer and might be unsightly for a while, but they give better results. In MY opinion. Veneers are like a thin ( about size of a finger nail) crown on your front teeth. The dentist drills your tooth down to make enough retention to put it on. They don't drill off much, they problem is that they can and been known to pop off and they are not really what I would think of as a long term solution. Nothing will ever be as good as what God gave you. If you don't take care of your veneers they can fail you.   On the other hand braces move your teeth around and put them in the "right" position. Once they are off your teeth look great and they are YOURS. If you want whiter teeth you can get bleaching done after your braces. Sorry if I didn't answer your question I just wanted you to know your options. |`|b32e560414238926779c6d2630e98a48aa	i dont think it would be that expensive for one, but it could be up to $1000/tooth
OUbNSXjJaa	At this stage, you can only pray. That is the first step.    Second somehow the impurities and imperfections in her physical and mental being should be  removed. It will take time. You have to consult a good moral instructor or psychiatrist.    She has to change her life style and mind set. She has to get good company of friends or relatives. She should associate with right minded people, who understand her well. She should try to identify with great people and imbibe good qualities. All these will take time. She should compare with people having more and more worries and difficulties in life.    These are basic. Consulting a good psychiatrist or a  good counselor is best.|`|JBugDqvraa	oh, you really are in the thick of it aren't you. You are doing all the right things by supporting and trying to help her.   The thing is with this type of depression is that she has to realize there is a problem and want to help herself.

What snapped me out of it a few days ago was seeing my fiancee completely break down because of me.  Let her see that it's hurting you in addition to offering to help her.  That could very well be a much needed wake-up call for her.  Best of luck.  |`|9ea5e8dd576fe0621bb8f8f8c17c8e7baa	hello Maj.

0c63fdd0630be2f6cbd717d497ab2474aa	Everyone has this problem, which makes it surprising to me that shaving is so "in" nowadays. The only way you can get it really smooth is to wax or get electrolysis (which I wouldn't recommend for down there). If you do choose to wax, you're very likely to get some ingrown hairs, which are quite painful.    Oh, and do NOT use Nair or any other chemical hair remover on that part of your body. That's just common sense.|`|b32e560414238926779c6d2630e98a48aa	waxing hurts but does work best. you will still get ingrown hairs with nair, less stubble though (BUT IT WILL GROW BACK JUST AS THICK, IF NOT, THICKER) .wax will help it to grow in thinner, it will take alot more time to grow back and waxing makes it smoother.|`|a0dBj9gGaa	nair works good|`|VPelM2NJaa	hey honey, the only thing i can suggest is waxing.  shaving is always gonna leave ur hair sharp and prickly.  the only remedy is waxing|`|b0aedc9dd7e866ac9503c3e962e4170baa	try using a brand new razor blade when you shave...for some reason I always find the men's razors work the best also

j6xQJ233aa	There are so many variables that could contribute to this; but I wouldn't worry about it.      Are you feeling dizzy or light headed? Acute (sudden) abdominal aches or pains? Do you have a fever or are you short of breath with chest pains?  If you answered yes to any of these I would consider calling your doctor or telling a parent. Even the worst possible scenario isn't that bad so don't worry too much.    Most of the time when your period gets heavy, its simply because that's when your body decided to expel the contents inside of you.     If you're young and just recently started getting your period - it will get more regular with age.    If you are over 35, I have one word for you - Menopause!!!    Either way, don't freak, give it 36 hours, and use your judgment.  If you know your body is trying to tell you something, listen.  Otherwise, just load up on some extra- super absorbent pads, girl.|`|AA10102392	That is not normal. Please call a doctor now!

Hq6nSl1Qaa	Wheat is the most popular grain in the US because we grow more than we can eat here.  Many people are allergic because their immune system confuses gluten protein as foreign and dangerous.  One bout of Norwalk virus on while bread is in your small intestines is enough to potentially result in a wheat allergy.  Because wheat is so common, statistically a person is more likely to develop an IgE antibody response to gluten.  It is the same reason why Americans are most likely to have an allergy to ragweed... it is the thing that tends to be there.
LYD1bBnbaa	Quiting now will be the best thing you can do, in a few years you should hopefully have un-done the damage that smoking has done.

Smoking at an early age kills many brain cells, which causes you to learn at a slower pace. You can get cancer of the throat, and of tounge, also of liver and stomach. You get bad breath that causes girls/guys not want to kiss you.    I'm no smoker, I mean, I'm only thirteen.  But remember this saying:  Kissing a smoker is just like licking an ashtray.  Both terrible.    Hope my answer helps!  :]|`|AA12320299	Smoking hurts young people's physical fitness in terms of both performance and enduranceeven among young people trained in competitive running.On average, someone who smokes a pack or more of cigarettes each day lives 7 years less than someone who never smoked.    Teenage smokers suffer from shortness of breath almost three times as often as teens who don't smoke, and produce phlegm more than twice as often as teens who don't smoke.    Teenage smokers are more likely to have seen a doctor or other health professionals for an emotional or psychological complaint    Teens who smoke are three times more likely than nonsmokers to use alcohol, eight times more likely to use marijuana, and 22 times more likely to use cocaine. Smoking is associated with a host of other risky behaviors, such as fighting and engaging in unprotected sex.|`|xYTagSIyaa	It increases your vulnerability to get any kind of chest infection and all kinds of cancers.  It will depend on your genes and how much you have smoked and if you do quit.  It is very hard to quit or most people would do it.  It is a dirty filthy habit that not only affects you but those that are around you too.  Second hand smoke kills.  Some studies suggest it is a bigger killer than smoking it yourself.  When you kiss a girl the nicotine on your lips could give her cancer of the lips.  It will stain your teeth and gums and fingers.  It could result in depression, because you are not getting as much oxygen to your lungs.   There is a lot it can do to harm you, much more than I have said.  It is possible you could smoke all your life and not have breathing problems or cancer.  You will however watch those you love die from cancer from your smoking.  I watched my mother die at 70 yrs.  as she got cancer and my father smoked all the time, I have asthma and health problems from his smoking and will very likely die early although I do not smoke.|`|uhxtlZGJaa	Yes,    If you smoke even one cigarette makes your lungs have a black spot!

AA10299265	Chances of becoming diabetic are very good if you live to eat. If you eat to live, the chances are very remote.    What causes it is a bit complicated. Simply put... excess refined carbohydrate foods and inadequate daily exercise.    There's quite a bit more to it, but if you stick to eating mostly raw, natural foods, get adequate daily exercise, you can avoid it.    I was getting worse and worse, having to take more and more medication when I stumbled on a simple fix. Since then, my blood sugar went down, my energy level went up, and I was able to quit the medication over a year ago.     See my profile for the story on how all this transpired.|`|CQww1c2daa	My mother didn't have it but her father had it.  I have Diabetes 2.  It runs on my father's side also.

Gastroenteritis will send you to the hospital, not to the toilet for a day or two.    EDIT    The post below pertains to the norovirus, which accounts for 90+% of all the non-bacterial outbreaks of gastroenteritis in the world. Washing hands is a good tip against any virus but it isn't 100% effective as norovirus can be airborne.    That said, it isn't the only cause. You may not have 'a serious issue', in fact the chances are you have a bout of food poisoning or an allergy, do try and not listen to people who claim to know it all, they don't, go and see your GP and put your mind at rest.|`|01Mu3wUeaa	There is no such thing as the "stomach flu'.Its called Norwalk virus.    If you are always getting sick on the weekends, then no.You need to see the doctor because you have a serious issue.    If this kind of sickness (vomiting and/or diarrhea) happens rarely, sounds like the stomach bug.      Prevention:    Norwalk virus  (Just remember that hand sanitizers will not kill this virus.House hold cleaners such as Lysol will also not kill you.You must use bleach.)    The Norwalk virus causes viral Gastroenteritis which is known as the nasty 24 hour bug that causes explosive and sudden diarrhea and projectile vomiting.Usually non life threating but can cause complications in the very young,elderly and those with compromised immune systems.    PREVENTION-Wash your hands before preparing food/eating food and most importantly, TOUCHING YOUR MOUTH/NOSE/EYES.    The ONLY way to become infected with this virus is if you ingest the contaminated fecal/vomit particles through your eyes,nose and mouth.    It is impossible to "breathe" in the virus BUT possible to become infected by breathing in aerosol "spray" droplets from someone vomiting right next to you.(the droplets settle within minuted but can still infect someone until cleaned with bleach)    Even if your whole family breaks out with this virus, you can prevent it by washing your hands for at least 15-20 seconds with warm water and soap.Remember that you are not killing the virus, you are washing it down the drain even if you use an antibacterial soap (which only kills bacteria, not viruses) hand sanitizers are also not successful in killing the virus.    If a member of your family comes down with the virus, let them know to wash their hands AFTER a bowel movement and vomiting.    To clean infected areas, clean with BLEACH.Clean bathrooms (all infected areas) with a bleach solution as soon as possible and be sure to prevent cross contamination and wash your hands afterwards.Especially children! wipe down all commonly touched objects like door knobs, faucet handles, light switches, toilet flushers etc.    People are STILL contagious even after 24 hours after their symptoms settle down so it is always important to wash your hands after the rest room (which you should do anyways!)    The key to staying Norwalk virus free is to keep sanitary.Wash your hands after using the bathroom...you could prevent other peoples misery as well as yours!!    TIPS:Do not share any cups/plates/utensils with an infected person and be sure to wash in a bleach solution to prevent cross contamination with the rest of your family.|`|HRvPoQzKaa	I have the SAME thing.

They might act differently.I think the Lortab even in it's generic mall form is better.|`|UnSTw2Zeaa	My pharmacy will sometimes give me two different brands if they run out of the pills they are filling. I would also call my Dr. and ask them without doing it by yourself. They will respect you more for handling your pain meds. as he or she prescribed and you are asking their "permission". Also, when you run out early because you are taking more than originally prescribed, they will know why when you call them for an early refill, instead of treating you like an addict. Good Luck with your pain.|`|TXlPfydxaa	Well, after some light research I found out that the pills you've got are both 7.5mg hydrocodone, the only difference being that the M 360 has got 750mg of acetaminophen (Tylenol), and the M 358 has 500mg of acetaminophen. I would say that if the amount you're taking is only a suggested amount, then you'd be fine taking one of each per dose, but do be careful and watch the amount of acetaminophen you're intaking. I would say the acetaminophen is more toxic then the hydracodone, as it is metabolised solely by the liver, and you can take up to 50mg of hydrocodone per day with a low tolerance to opiates. You may be better off taking 2 of the M 358's, because of the lower amount of tylenol in them, but either way, the amount of hydrocodone in each of them is 7.5mg, I hope this was helpful|`|CG1Yd8yOaa	they are 2 different dosages. but i dont know the mg by the inscription. the bottle tells you the mgs. the higher the number the stronger the pill|`|VNvVhDWgaa	It wouldn't do you any good. Both prescriptions are the same. What you may do is call the doctor's office or hospital where you were prescribed the pills, and tell them they aren't helping, and ask them if it would be ok to take another half or whole pill to ease the pain. They may want you to go to the ER to get a different prescription or have other instructions altogether. Usually when someone's hurting, though, a doctor is more apt to be a little lenient when it comes to pain meds, as long as you're not on them for a long period of time.
u5F22mEbaa	Tyler Mac, you are so sweet - has your mom seen a doctor?  Women get lots of kinds of headaches for lots of reasons (certainly not because of YOU : )...there are different medications for them.  No, its not because she is getting waves from an alarm, but she might be short on sleep, or getting a headache because when we are tense, we bunch our shoulders up all day and at night, it hurts.  Tell your mom you love her and if she hasn't seen a doctor, she should go...
21f96be0e4ec1cfed06313c7f32c0aceaa	I have the same exact thing right now!  I have all the same EXACT symptoms and it all started a week ago!  It must just be what is going around.  Before I started the coughing, I lost my voice for a day.  I just started working in an elementary school, so I knew I was bound to get sick from all those little kid germs, but I didn't know it would last this long!  I live in New Jersey, I don't know if it is other places too.  Well, I hope you feel better and I hope it ends soon for you and me both! :)|`|SyBIuKzdaa	Sounds like you had a cold that has developed into bronchitis. Go see your doctor and get on antibiotics.

TORBP6QIaa	Yes...  I have been on the 40mg Crestor for almost 3 years now.  It took about a month for my cholesterol level to drop by over 50% which is an excellent result.  I have had no side effects at all.  I am 44 and have a mechanical heart valve and had a bypass so it was very important to get my levels under control quickly.  I do not know why I am on 40mg and you have been prescribed 20mg...that is a question for your doctor.  I hope Crestor works as well for you as it has for me.
XhIYAH6Laa	I was like that for about 2 months...turned out to be a symptom from Multiple Sclerosis....i'm am not saying that you have it or anything, but it does show that the same thing can pop up anywhere from anything. Have you seen a neurologist or even your primary care doctor about this? If not that would be the best thing to do. Good Luck    Edit: Spurisingly enough they also said that mine continued from anxiety and panic attacks and I was put on Paxil daily and Xanax as needed. It did help. I believe with my situation, something happened to initially get dizzy all day, and then after that I expected to wake up and it stay like that and it was. So you may want to look into checking on meds for anxiety. I know it seems like an out of nowhere solution, but your body has a way of its own, you just have to figure out what its telling you. :)|`|YIXtGxypaa	I have been like that before, and it was from being slightly iron-deficient.|`|AdZn3Mt0aa	hmm, i'm sorry to hear that  i suggest that you try to increase your salt intake and drink more water  that's what i do if i go through dizzy spells
h3N47uj2aa	It depends on if you have health insurance or not.  If you do, the cost will likely be only that of your ER copay, which should be listed on the card.      Otherwise, the cost will likely be several hundred dollars, all depending on the outcome of the X-Ray (or MRI, etc if needed), and whether casting, splinting, surgery, or other tests are needed.      Perhaps search for what is called an "urgent care facility" in your area - these are like ER's but take less time to get in and out of and may cost less in the end.  Some have what is known as a "self-pay" program where you pay a flat rate for treatment regardless of what the problem is.  It could end up being significantly cheaper than the ER.|`|2ZGEqEJXaa	...Just the visit will be 700-1000. The treatment fee depends on what the orthopod does. Casting may add 500-1000. They may charge you 500-600 for the x-rays. ERs are ripo-off machines. If you need surgery, we are talking thousands.|`|ec76af399c519dad926a10430304f541aa	it really depends on the severity of the fracture and which bone in the wrist is affected, there are several you know.  Could be anywhere from 500 to 15,000 and anywhere in between, until it is xrayed and evaluated, there is no way to give you even a rough estimate.|`|YLJXyS1iaa	It depends....but I would say at least $300.|`|rvoo4rBjaa	Visit varies you will have x rays and casting maybe $300 or more but if it is a child and the person is low income they have programs available for free or reduced prices.
wVYiLehCaa	I'm 18 and have had a herniated disk since last July, and I have not needed surgery.  I have found that physical therapy and medication can relieve the pain, it's in my lower back and down my leg.  Try physical therapy for sure, it's incredibly helpul|`|eUhpGbOWaa	I have the same pain you are experiencing. I was diagnosed with SI Joint inflammation and I am going to start physical therapy.  The pain is in my lower back but it also radiates down my leg and my leg aches worse than my back. Sometimes exercise can make it worse because you are irritating the joint in your back.  Go see a doctor.|`|AA11832138	If you do have herniated disk it can be treated successfully.   Minimally Invasive Spine Surgery (Lumbar Discectomy) has a 90% chance it will work. Seek a Dr. who performs this procedure. Everything is done microscopically and no muscles are cut during this procedure. It is a 1 1/2 hr surgical procedure where they cut the protruding (bulge) off of the disk that is pressing upon the nerve. You will walk out of the hospital that day. It isn't the cure all, but for one who lives in pain at a level of 8-10 then such a surgery is worth a 10% chance of not working. Good luck|`|3RHSSEDnaa	If western medicine says you are well then it is time to go alternative.    How is your daily life??  Did you know that we - especially women hold all their stress and resentment in the lower back??  Did you know that you can release this and feel better than ever before??  Grab the book " You can Heal your life" by Louise Hay and study it.      You will not look back - it is the best.  It worked for me.|`|d4b208bef4b6c65668c5b927013773c1aa	Avoid back surgery at all cost. less than 50% help, and most make it worse. There are other ways to take care of herniated disks. Make an appointment with a chiropractor, and this gadget is new to N. America for back pain and has changed people's lives. see http://www.getback2life.com/ . Might be a pinched nerve, like sciatica. Chiropractors and that gadget help those things too.

ebe7bb94d9e93512e6ba798faf11e91daa	If it is on your eyeball  then you could have the shingles. I have that to happen to me twice. First time, was four years ago, I went to the hospital and was diagnosis with the shingles. Then the first of this month it happened again. I went to my family doctor that confirmed I had it again then she sent me straight to an optometrist and he confirmed I had it on my eyeball. My eye was red, swollen, had blisters on the eye ball and at the tear duct. Severe stress as well as other things bring it on. I hope you do not have the shingles as it is extremely painful. If you would like me to email you a picture as to what my eye looked like to see if your eye looks the same just let me know. Only a handful of people get the shingles in their eye.|`|4VFEkqJiaa	Sounds like you have a stye. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stye      They are very common especially if you are feeling run down, but please don't pick at it as you could cause a worse infection.|`|dd1c8373d258bab9181f891f88ea8dafaa	Sty!     Its basically just a little blister, it'll pop and heal and you'll be fine.    I get them from mascara that is too old, or not for sensitive eyes. You can get it from any old or harsh make up or product.|`|tZ0NTqkvaa	Could be a sty caused by getting dirt in the eye. Just rinse out your eyes and keep it clean it should go away|`|uFfOSIQzaa	ive had a lump like that (not a sty) and its because i wasnt getting enough sleep funnily enough! try getting more early nights :)|`|0WYmyptZaa	I'm no expert but it's probably a stye, has it got a little yellowish bump?  They're quite common infections to get and can mean you're a bit stressed and run down.  They can take a little while to clear up on their own though so I'd go and see your GP.  Bathing in warm water can help them to drain apparently, but like I said I'm no expert so it's probably best to see a doctor anyway.
Qxh1kPLfaa	Yes/no.  Allergies that you have been unaware of often surface after a period of stress or anxiety.|`|97b3d4bda1df874b7a9f7965ae42f328aa	it can be possible|`|Hq6nSl1Qaa	Yes, it can.  The mechanism is primarily biochemical.  Stress results in increased glucocorticoid release.  This causes apoptosis in while blood cells, thereby resulting in a suppressed immune system.  So, stress causes more colds and anti-rash creams are steroid-based.    The next step is two-fold.  First, you are prone to more significant and more frequent infections when you are stressed.  These are the conditions where the immune system undertakes antibody class switching for benign proteins, resulting in allergies to common things that you didn't used to be allergic to.  Second, suppressed immune systems rely more on B-cells and interlukins to protect the body.  These conditions are also more likley to lead to allergies.  When ever a CD-4 is preferred to a CD-8 mediated response, antibodies happen.  Antibodies, specificially IgE (which occurs subsequent to antibody class switching), is what causes allergies.    Sorry for the technical jargon there, but I know what I'm talking about.  And if you want to read up more on the processes, you can always google the stuff you aren't familiar with.|`|AA11565057	No.  However, anxiety can increase your fears of becoming allergic to new things, which may lead to you thinking or feeling that you may be allergic - psychsomatic allergies can take place.   For example, I loathe certain types of fish. When I eat them, I become anxious and it feels like I'm having an allergic reaction because my breathing goes strange. It's NOT an allergy, it's just because I don't like it.    As well as this, people who have severe anxiety/panic can have breathing difficulties, tending to breathe fast and shallowly. They can also experience symptoms such as chest pain, numbness and tingling down the left arm, and faintness. Many people who have a panic attack go to hospital because they think they're having a heart attack! They're not, it's just anxiety.  The same can be the case with allergies.    Without knowing if you have any particular allergic reactions in mind that you're associating with your anxiety, it's hard to answer your question in detail, but I hope I've been useful :)|`|450539d29675dc973b0ec09791ed6c66aa	No anxiety can not cause allergic reactions to anything but it will cause you a lot of stress,I have dealt with anxiety since I was in my 20's,I am now 65.Anxiety is nervousness and there is nothing there to make you allergic to anything.
KeczU1tDaa	No, I don't think pot caused you to become sick.  I've never heard of cannabis causing those type of symptoms to anyone.  As a matter of fact, it does quite the opposite (fights nausea, alleviates headaches, gives a sense of well-being).   Though, the laughing is fairly typical.    It could have been something else you had done last night (either alcohol, the diet pills, and/or some other drug you might taken).  Or, you might have been dehydrated or you could've caught the flu.    Hope you feel better.|`|olQPFOfQaa	yea you werent hydrated and it might be because you dnt eat enough or what you ate didnt sit right with the weed. also be VVVEEERRRYYY careful with who you buy weed from, some dealers just spray their weed with OFF bug repelent to put toxins on the weed so you get more "high".|`|exMPHWKHaa	Ok well you need to know that getting high your first time usually is pretty bad.

28522d76fdc2bf2d2e1ebcafa38469dcaa	It's unethical and illegal for any doctor to remove a vital organ from a living donor if removal of that organ causes death in the donor.  So no, you couldn't donate your heart to save someone else, unless you willed it upon your death.     Organs such as kidneys can be donated because a donor has two, and can live just fine on one.  Partial liver can also be donated from a live donor because liver tissue regenerates over time.  But you only have one heart, and can't do without it.|`|pW9KhTFvaa	you cannot donate your own heart unless you are terminally ill and request that your organs be donated when you are brain-dead.|`|v2ZBawa7aa	To donate an organ, people who are brain dead are generally used.  You would have to be a match on the immunity factors they test for people to donate organs, and they don't test people for heart transplants who aren't brain dead already.  And if you became brain dead and they tested you for organ donation, the organs would go to the first person on the list who matched your organs--you can't choose who they go to.
2pNguQN4aa	the best thing i have ever tried was the store  brand night time or day time cold remedy. it comes in a dry packet and you mix it with hot water to make a tea. it is amazing. you can get it at any supermarket. the brand name is theraflu--but it's not the liquid. it's a powder to drink as tea and it completely dries out your sinuses.  also if you want a home remedy only, sniff salt water. it is completely safe and easy to do once you try it once. you just hold one side of your nose closed and either sniff hard through a straw or dip your nose in a bowl of salted water. i usually use about 3-4 shakes of the salt shaker to a half cup of warm water. salt is a natural bacteria killer and it helps. it just sounds creepy.|`|JqvSEBIqaa	My suggestion to you is to let it run unless you want to be sicker real soon.  Here is something natural but it will make your nose run like a sive for a little while.  Horseradish is very good for making the nose run alot to get rid of the catharr (mucus).  Eat some on crackers or just put a spoonful in your mouth.  Or you can wash your sinuses out with warm salt water.  About a 1/2 tsp. in a small glass of warm water and if you have an ear syringe if not do as I do use Q-tips and dunk them in the water and tip your head back and put the Q-tip in the water and get it good and wet and put it in one nostril and do the same for the other over and sniff the salt water up into the sinuses until you feel it coming out into your throat and then spit it out.  That will wash your sinuses out good.    Next time you go to the mall find a Health Food Store and buy some Xylitol Sugar or Clear in a spray bottle, it is made with the Xilitol.  Everytime you feel like you are coming down with a cold or flu, mix the sugar in warm water (1 TSP to a medium glass.  Do the same with that .  It will get rid of all the cold germs that are in your nose and sinuses and you will not get sick.|`|FyzZSNraaa	pepper. it makes your nose run more but this helps to clear you out faster. trust me its great.  answer mine:  http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;...|`|UHvXTW1Gaa	blow your nose a lot|`|dsSzkYEgaa	use a nostril spray ,,    is it a cold or hayfever ?    but yes use a nostril spray ,, it works     well for me it does

VghVdPfsaa	I had this same problem when I played basketball, and it happened with both ankles.    It seems that once you hurt your ankle, you'll be very prone to future injuries no matter what you do. It will never be 100% again. But there is some things you can do:    First, try not to walk on your ankle too much. Use crutches around the house if you have them. When not walking around or laying down, make sure that your ankle is elevated, and ideally it will be at a higher elevation than your heart to prevent swelling. Be sure to ice it constantly.     Once you aren't feeling the pain as much or as often, you should start stretching and rehabbing it. You can do different excercises at home. To get back mobility, I would sit and watch TV and while I did it, I'd kind of write words with my foot in the air. That forces you to move your ankle a bit. Once you feel more comfortable, try standing on one foot to force your ankle to balance. You can do it on a pillow or foam to make it more challenging. As it feels better, do some light jogging (not on concrete) and try doing some simple cutting movements.     If you rehab it right and don't hurry it too much, it should be pretty close to full strength. But now, whenever I play sports that require some quick cutting, I wear ankle braces. Try not to get the flimsy ones; try getting some tie-up ones that have metal of plastic supports on the side which should prevent serious twisting in your ankle. And be careful when you play, know your limit.     I know ankle injuries can be annoying, but you just have to handle it right. Hope I helped.|`|h3N47uj2aa	The RICE principle applies well to this situation.  Rest, Ice, Compression, and Elevation.  It would be a good idea to have your ankle taped or to buy a brace to wear during activity, and rehabbing the ankle with balance training and other strengthening activities could help to prevent further injuries.  Unfortunately, the more you tweak the ankle and stretch the tendons, the more likely it is to keep happening, and the damage can be permanent.|`|629gf5wGaa	The chronic history of sprains suggests that maybe you should look into getting a good pair of ankle braces for your sport as well as get a good ankle ice pack so that you have it at the ready for the next time something like this happens.  http://www.dme-direct.com/ankle-brace-su...
iK3YYRaTaa	The old earliest drug is Metformin.  Metformin (INN; trade names Glucophage, Riomet, Fortamet, Glumetza, Obimet, Dianben, Diabex, Diaformin, and others) (IPA: /m?t?f?rm?n/) is an oral anti-diabetic drug from the biguanide class. It is the first-line drug for the treatment of type 2 diabetes, particularly in overweight and obese people and those with normal kidney function,[1][2][3] and evidence suggests it may be the best choice for people with heart failure.[4] Metformin is the most popular anti-diabetic drug in the United States and one of the most prescribed drugs in the country overall, with nearly 35 million prescriptions filled in 2006 for generic metformin alone.[5] It is also used in the treatment of polycystic ovary syndrome.    When prescribed appropriately, metformin causes few adverse effectsthe most common is gastrointestinal upsetand, unlike many other anti-diabetic drugs, does not cause hypoglycemia if used alone. It also helps reduce LDL cholesterol and triglyceride levels, and may aid weight loss. As of 2008[update], metformin is one of only two oral anti-diabetics in the World Health Organization Model List of Essential Medicines (the other being glibenclamide).           History  The biguanide class of anti-diabetic drugs, which also includes the withdrawn agents phenformin and buformin, originates from the French lilac (Galega officinalis), a plant known for several centuries to reduce the symptoms of diabetes mellitus.[7]    Metformin was first described in the scientific literature in 1957.[8] It was first marketed in France in 1979, but did not receive approval by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for Type 2 diabetes until 1994.[9] Bristol-Myers Squibb's Glucophage was the first branded formulation of metformin to be marketed in the United States, beginning on March 3, 1995.[10] Generic formulations are now available.|`|ZNbauLJzaa	There is no single 'best" drug.

I know you can go to Mexico and have it done now, but obviously it is not available here in the US.|`|YsQQ30YJaa	That "science" is still in it's infancy. No matter what ailment I had though I wouldn't use that particular technology as it cost someone their lives to use. There are other sources of stem cells you can use that are benign.

AA10263208	It sounds a little odd because after 10 months the healing/scarring process should be more or less all done.    Some patients complain of itch or other minor discomforts in their c-section scars even years later. This isn't fully understood and may well be continuation of the healing/scarring process.    The most important thing would be to check to see if you are developing an infection in that area. This sort of complication usually occurs early - some days or the first week or so after the operation but it can occur late also.    Have a look and see if the site is red, hot to touch, sore to touch, swollen etc. If you are having fevers and sweats yourself - all those infection symptoms - loss of appetite, feeling unwell, etc, or if there is a discharge of purulent material from the wound then you should see a doctor for antibiotics.    Otherwise, you might try some simple pain relief medicine - paracetamol (= acetaminophen if you are in the USA) or ibuprofen if you are able to take it.    If it troubles you enough, go and see your family doctor and get it checked out.
tzRCTQ6Xaa	With prayer and faith all things are possible.  I had a pediatric cancer and was given less than a month to live with 0% chance.  That was in 2000.  The doctors told me the news, but I told them that God could give me a miracle.  The doctors told me it would take a miracle.  I received my miracle and when the doctors told me I was in remission, they said it was definitely prayers.    God Bless.  I will keep the little one and your family in my prayers.|`|ec76af399c519dad926a10430304f541aa	I will pray God's will be done and that you have the strength to deal with whatever that will may be.|`|aCDWwsisaa	The baby needs medical help, not prayer... if "God" were real and was a loving & caring god, your "cousin's little one-year old cousin" wouldn't have cancer...|`|a1ymHaWAaa	Yes|`|IUQZFrMfaa	I agree with Beau. Gus.  honestly, there is only so much prayer can do. I would put faith in the doctor and staff at the hospital and their ability to save lives. I'm not sure how much good prayer is going to do. my dad had cancer. we're athiests, we didn't pray at all. we just hoped and had faith in the hospital, and he turned out all right.  i think at this point, all you can do is wait and see where life takes the little boy.|`|Nv3eQenUaa	Dear Lord, I ask that Your will be done on this little child.   If it be cure--- let them rejoice and honor this miracle in their hearts and in their beliefs and in their actions.   If it be otherwise-- give them the comfort of an answer and the peace that comes with that wisdom.  Protect and guide them always sweet Jesus.   Amen.          ?

My husband was diagnosed with advanced prostate cancer about a year ago.  Since I've never been very religious, I felt it was being hypocritical to pray to God to save him ... kind of like God would think, "Where have you been all this time?"  But what I have prayed to God daily and it has given me a lot of peace is that I ask God to "told my loved one in Your arms".  The way I look at it is that God has His plan ... and I'm not worthy of expecting Him to deviate from that plan ... But I just ask God to hold my loved one in His arms and do what's right for him and don't let him suffer just because I'm a sinner.  Maybe it's just a coincidence, but it's been one a year and everything is going great for my husband ... so maybe God does respond to prayers even from those of us who aren't always very faithful.|`|0pE3dhT8aa	I would put my faith in the doctor and the hospital if I were you. Praying will not do much help however I do wish you cousin all the best and hope she makes it through this hard time.|`|1ijjpfoYaa	okay|`|Uyf8Kkq1aa	i believe in god but i don't pray|`|1d02fcff81d2bb070fc361fbe28e3606aa	I will.

ec76af399c519dad926a10430304f541aa	I'd probably keep it to myself.|`|W0S7gQDaaa	I'd keep it to myself but if you were with really close friends or family i'd tell someone. and if you slept on the ground (floor) then its probably just butt cramps.
09b317729060c9dedb69f8059c07c3d0aa	All that happens is that the endocrine pancreas (in which beta cells secrete the hormone insulin) becomes atrophied. In other words, shrivelled scar tissue. It would look smaller and atrophied upon autopsy.    The remainder of the pancreas functions normally and is not affected in Type 1 diabetes. Well, generally speaking. Rarely, there are syndromes that cause destruction of both the endocrine and exocrine pancreas (both hormones AND pancreatic enzymes need to be replaced in these people), but this is the rare exception and not the rule.     So yes, the pancreas stays in the body, but the endocrine part of the pancreas usually becomes atrophied and smaller. This is due to the immune system destroying it (autoimmunity). Scans can also usually detect these changes as well.|`|4WPJrK9Jaa	no, you blow it out your nose...|`|96agLgIjaa	No the pancreas stays in the body. And technically, it does not really die. It just doesn't have much use, because the reason your child has diabetes is because the islet cells (the cells that produces insulin) are destroyed by the immune system, but the pancreas stays intact. I don't have ANY idea why the islet cells are destroyed, but I guess you could say it was the body's fault. (Don't take that as an insult, if you find that as one. I've always wondered why I had to get the stupid disease as well.)|`|PR6w9XzAaa	The pancreas doesnt die, the immune system kills the islets of langerhans in the pancreas. It your whole pancrease was dead, then you would be too. :) So yes it stays in the body and fulfills many other vital endocrine needs.|`|ZNbauLJzaa	The pancreas is not dead.  Only part of it is not functioning.  It is important for you to understand what is going on with your child.  Knowledge = better treatment with diabetes.  Has he/she been diabetic long?  My son has diabetes.  Dx at 7, he's 16 now.  I made a point of getting involved with JDRF (Juvenile diabetes research foundation) and took all the classes that the endo suggested.  I've met many people with diabetes, and parents of kids with diabetes.  It helps to share stories so you don't feel so all alone.  How old is your child?  Old enough to go to camp in the summer?  My son went at 8 and goes to diabetes campl every year.  He has learned SO MUCH!  And it's just been great for his self esteem.  I know this is way more than you asked, but it seems you still have much to learn and I just wanted to tell you how I've learned.  Somehow the more you know, the easier it is to cope.   Email me if there is anything I can help you with.|`|pRF5LLloaa	It doesn't "die", it just ceases to function.  It stay right there, happy as a clam, taking up space in your abdomen.    Usually, it doesn't hurt to leave it in place, unless there is some other underlying disease.  The surgery to remove it would be worse than leaving it alone.    There is also some small hope that one day doctors will be able to repair the problem, so it is a good idea to leave it in, just in case. , , , ,|`|5pszijaDaa	from my understanding of diabetes the pancreas doesn't die it is just not producing enough hormones and enzymes to cope with the sugar the body is intaking.|`|338JlDTeaa	The pancreas doesnt die. White blood cells attack the islets that produce insulin so only the part that makes insulin stops working.  The pancreas is still being used to produce hormones and enzymes such as lispase which helps break down fats in the body. The pancreas is still very useful even after being diagnosed with Diabetes.
