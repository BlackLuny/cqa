First comes love, then comes marriage, then comes a baby and a baby carriage.|`|spfftUvUaa	Maybe the Steven snuck into ur dream and made that happen and it shows u that hes gay at the end.|`|trJdcgQdaa	IT MEANS YOU should form a relaton ship with the steven|`|v5cpKHGPaa	Although it's possible to provide a blanket interpretation to your dream, I believe dreams are extremely personal things that only the individual can truly know.<br>  For example, some things in that dream may have very significant personal meaning to you that may not be so for others.<br>  <br>  I would suggest trying to remember as much of the dream in detail as possible, and nit-pick all the little details and their significance, as you're more likely to get an accurate interpretation that way.<br>  However one interpretation is that you may cause this steven character to fall, and be forced to be creative in the way you help him get back on his feet, yet once you do this, you two will be able to walk peacefully together and possibly form a silent/unspoken bond.<br>  <br>  Also, I would agree with "Nick's" interpretation for the most part, however I would associate the walk in the woods with a more peaceful and natural choice. Therefore I would say that it's possible you will make a choice which allows you to feel at peace within (whatever that choice may be) as opposed to what you believe most people will want you to choose (Also that you will stand by your choice without resentment, and with only peace and happiness.)<br>  <br>  <br>  But again that's just my interpretation, little details can change the entire dream's meaning around and personal thoughts can too.<br>  Good luck in understanding this dream Wisdom :-)|`|SD4VtziKaa	Your going to meet someone that you really aren't going to like at first and exclude them. Then, you are going to do something unnecessary to that person, pay a price, and realize they need some love. Later on, you will become great friends with that person.|`|ZsujbEjJaa	just a dream, u may have Steven on u mind.
I1K6SC43aa	Men are impossible to understand.<br>  <br>  Most men also say they prefer minimal makeup on women, yet they drool over actresses like Megan Fox who cake it on.|`|fC5X8swbaa	Lol. Size 6-8 is totally not fat, and barely curvey. I would consider size 10-13 curvey. Relax, with size 6-8 your definetly not fat!!|`|6c7e9e289fd5db36cd934c29dca6003eaa	Curves are and always will be the sexiest.  They are skinny because they need to show the clothes off.|`|5jqfKDdfaa	Supermodels are living mannequins....they serve only one purpose...to display the clothes...<br>  <br>  No one should EVER be that skinny....looking like a 14yo boy in heels is not cute...|`|VA3tGarQaa	Cause skinny models can wear anything and look like a hanger. Whereas curvy women look better in fitted things, but the designers aren't prepared to do that. <br>  There is no universal sexy look. Some men like skinny, some like curvy. You can't please everyone.|`|lm9fUhOSaa	Because they are told what to do by their agent, who in turn is told what to do by the modelling agencies, who in turn want to make money. If they don't make money then no one else makes money.<br>  <br>  Simple really.<br>  <br>  As for sexy, curvy is sexy, twiggy is a turn off.|`|q8Tkh1zdaa	curves are sexy... the only reason supermodels are sexy is basically because real life people will never be able to have them... thats what makes them sexy..|`|ZzRZTgmxaa	Supermodels have to be super skinny to prevent their outfits from looking half way normal. Real women have curves.|`|PPyMhRJAaa	I do understand that the fashion models have to be very thin in order to model the clothes so they look their best. I am a size 12 - 14 myself.|`|2pwIT6TXaa	Clothes should just hang there, and models have bodies like hangers.|`|5bd9782dc4224d26bbb20f86a3de9c05aa	supermodels are not sexy!<br>  <br>  They display clothes, they don't wear them.|`|g0YNQdL2aa	Not them skinny twiglets thats for sure|`|4FacXl8Aaa	Curves work if they run through,like on a nice car or boat or horse.  Cellulite is not curvaceous it is lumpy. So it depends. It's better to be firm not wobbling.A secondary sexual characteristic in women is  a narrow waist, wideish hips, and then legs tapering back in.If you are straight up and down you'll look like a boy. If you are not flabby, then a bit of padding is perfect. Supermodels are clotheshorses not really what most men find attractive. What a lot of guys find unattractive is too much of an obsession, we are not so picky as you might imagine.|`|Q8m4E4tzaa	- It is more difficult to design clothes for real women as curves get in the way.<br>  - The thinness of the models doesn't detract from the clothes.<br>  - Many fashion designers are gay men who obviously aren't responsive to curves.|`|KudT7Xi4aa	i have lots of curves and i <3 them! i'm a teen so wenever i feel down about it, i call my best friend whos tall and skinny and she says "I LOOK LIKE A PRE PUBESCENT BOY! YOU LOOK LIKE A WOMAN!"|`|273vsUezaa	Guys like curves- end of story.<br>  <br>  <br>  Supermodels are chosen by GIRLS... that's why they are so thin.<br>  <br>  Gotta have the curves!!|`|c1FAWmbraa	Its good to have curves, but not tooo many lol. I think guys like girls who are thin, flat stomach, thin legs and arms, but with a good *** and boobs!|`|OjS2wJZWaa	I like curves on a woman...<br>  <br>  :))|`|lynmeenmaa	supermodels are for showing off clothes not to be sexy, but look at the pictures of women in playboy and nuts and stuff, they have curves. yes they are thin, but its NOT REAL!!!!! they photoshop everything! men want somethin to hold onto, and anyway all men are different. ur a size 6-8? ur tiny, by anyones standards! thats just one size above a 0 in US sizes. the media has dictated what is attractive these days and some men fall for it but some have their own opinions. thin people have problems too - im slim, i still wanna lose weight and iv got small boobs, and then i hear all these mags giving out about the skinny models saying they look like boys cos theyre skinny and havnt big boobs, and im like, stop insulting everyone! all sides! i dunno where im goin and the media drive me mad -Front Cover - NICOLE TOO SKINNY, page 5, LOOK AT THIS GIRL'S FAT/CELLULITE! argh!!!! im sick of it!
ax9xk0Ndaa	LOL..<br>  <br>  I remember when someone would accidentally have a blue sock on one foot..then a lighter shade of blue on the other..

Mxz3lZHCaa	First, you obviously need to prepare yourself. To do this you must do seven and a half push ups, followed by 32 sit ups. Second, deal with your finances, you can't just go all willy-nilly and buy some pie if you can't afford it. Third, if necessary, you must contact your local police station and interview the local sheriff, for he has eaten the most pie in the area. If he knows the proper place to consume a pie related object, I would take his advice. The last step is to order the correct slice of pie, blackberry, apple, cherry, there's lots of choices. But go with pumpkin, it is by far the most delicious.|`|k0Ewe7mCaa	Eat some.|`|23DiWU58aa	eat some.|`|R534McNOaa	Don't eat them all at once, it's bad for your diet!|`|kKmuFi4zaa	eat some apple pie ;]|`|a6f8IoISaa	I think you should eat some...|`|T7qgrOJzaa	Learn to bake, then your in business.|`|AulaPWqbaa	eat some, <br>  <br>  here are instuctions. :<br>  1. go to a place.<br>  2. buy some kinda pie, perferably oreo ;D<br>  3. get some cool whip.<br>  4. go home.<br>  5. put the cool whip on.<br>  6. cut it in slices.<br>  7. share with people.<br>  8. eat some yourself.<br>  <br>  WOW. so muchos intructions just to eat a pie.|`|lJbLxz39aa	Go to Marie Callenders, the lemon meringue is on sale all month!|`|4bFypdGLaa	Get your life together man!

You deserve so much better.|`|Yj7kMfv7aa	I already have, I've found the person I want to be with... and so will you, in time...<br>  for now it is a time for you to reflect, to remember, to let go and to move one and eventually when your Heart is ready you will find your special someone, waiting for you...Good Luck ?|`|6k5fhFyBaa	It's not selfish, I went through the same thing, with my ex-husband. And part of the reason I haven't had any successful relationships after that, is because I can't seem to trust. But time heals wounds, and when you meet the right person, you'll WANT to trust them. Trust doesn't ever guarantee happiness, but we only live once, right?|`|K4GiKOhPaa	Whoa, dude, so sorry to hear that, man. Just give yourself time. Don't be in any hurry. Take your time and eventually the right lady will help you to trust once again. Good luck, dude.|`|UZEEKKPeaa	I personally cannot trust the person again. But everyone I meet is not that person, and they deserve a fair shot. Trust until given reason not to, then cut them loose. <br>  I'm sorry she did that to you. That stings. *HUGS|`|Y4Ye3OLOaa	I'm really sorry that happened to you. It definitely hurts, time heals everything eventually though|`|AWCv2v3Gaa	very sorry to hear that.   going through the same thing.<br>  <br>  (((hugg)))|`|7ee11f32ce402e558134b3f3e6323823aa	Hi Max, sorry to hear that. I think , with time it will come again. It's important to realize that not everybody cheats. I would suggest open communication and finding someone who shares your values...after you get over this heartache. It takes time , and you should give yourself that.<br>  Also, for myself it helped when I realized that the walls only enslave me ,they don't protect me.<br>  Good luck. =)|`|AA10101702	I'm so sorry that happened. It's not easy, but with time you will heal. It often takes someone else to teach us. Just be patient and give those ladies a chance if you think they're someone you might eventually like. Don't push people away from you and become embittered. Just take it one day at a time. Good luck to you, my friend.

So I called my mom up at work and told her about it, and instead of being all happy & stuff that I got 2nd place in the entire state and that my application would soon be reviewed on a national level, she just said "Oh...only $1000?....that's not very much..."<br>  <br>  *sigh* =/|`|UnqAjpVOaa	Yeah I hate all stuff like that mom's say<br>  like as well "what do you ever do for me?"<br>  Don't know if you get that one also lol|`|JITTMjasaa	My mom is insane so I grew up with my grandparents most of my life.

Gollum is malnourished and weak. Yoda has a light saber and a force that mysteriously comes out of his hands that can move massive objects. Gollum has a.... a.... a loincloth! Think about it.

Their songs have emotion and powerful themes implanted deep into them.

AND SO HOT AHHHH when he was stripping in the finale omg lol<br>  <br>  2. ryan c<br>  another cutie! mega talented too with the dancing, piano playing, hair cutting. for some reason I feel i relate to him the most with all the random hobbies and stuff. his performance in orquestra was AMAZING. the piano playing and everything. and those flips landing on his head talk about impressive. and i think it's so cute that  he cuts the crew's hair XD<br>  <br>  3. hok<br>  ahhhhhh omg quest guys are so cute. i think my favourite things about hok are his smile and his sexy accent. his hair is so crazy. his tutting is the best, i swear! like dtrix he's so silly behind the scenes and you almost always see him smiling on stage.<br>  <br>  4. steve<br>  i think steve is the cutest in the group. his flips are so crazy and all the tricks he did on abdc amazed me. he's hilarious too. idk i just really like him too hehe :o)<br>  <br>  quest crew in general is just made up of great down-to-earth guys. their interviews and behind the scenes stuff is always hilarious but they're also so humble. i love them :) definitely my fave abdc crew|`|HTGVZbjUaa	d-trix cause he's hilarious and can do awesome headspins.

cy7freI8aa	Doesn't appear to be any sort of scale or mode, you'd probably just call it a 'synthetic scale' that you made up.<br>  <br>  The three chromatic notes and the minor third jump make it really hard to actually call it a scale. Remember that when you're talking about scales you're not only talking about the notes but the chords formed around those notes. If A is the root, then what is the root chord if there is no third, is it an Asus chord? What is the E chord (the fifth), E major (with the G#) or minor (with the G)? The scale probably does sound pretty cool but to actually use it in the context of a song/improvisation you will have to build some harmony around those notes.<br>  <br>  If not, it kind of sounds like the D Dorian with no seventh degree (C) and the b5 passing tone thrown in (G#).

I'm rather curious as to why she decided to rename herself from Santogold to Santigold.  Don't know about you but I liked the "O" better as it had a better ring to it.  There's no mistaking the New Wave influence in her sound.  I say she's a lot better than M.I.A.|`|AA12301664	i remember hearing 'les artistes' on the radio, but had no idea about the people behind it.<br>  as i was tramping across a field at glastonbury last year, i heard this familiar tune drifting my way.<br>  to say that i was surprised by what i saw on that stage would be an understatement.<br>  i stayed for the whole set and was mightily impressed. her two dancers are an absolute deadpan delight.<br>  i think she is extremely talented, and a marvellous example of 21st century musical innovation.<br>  <br>  long live alt-dub trip rock<br>  <br>  say aha<br>  <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fIY-qd8todk&feature=related" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fIY-qd8to...</a>|`|AA10795350	She's talented.

Not bad. Not my type of music really, but I actually enjoyed it. Thanks for sharing!|`|EklDkZ79aa	i think she's good but i'm not sure what to label her as.<br>  she is sorta (a little bit) close to M.I.A|`|6EoAKcMwaa	Hi Lily,<br>  <br>  She is not my cup of tea at all. The music is too repetitive for me. It sounds too much like club music. <br>  <br>  If she is influenced by Blondie I didn't hear it at all in that track.<br>  <br>  Well, at least I tried.|`|ab1c9b81d36c3691f0d575d773009489aa	I liked them, especially the first one.

Yes I think shes talented.|`|rR6lwxjjaa	nope i dont dislike her actually from what ive heard i REALLY like her but i havent heard that much so hold on ima listen to these songs<br>  EDIT: the first song was amazing i love the sound that was like "wa wa wahaaaa" which is the only way i can describe it.  <br>  the second one was pretty good too, but i liked the first one better. both solid songs though|`|OTFzJbaMaa	i really like the first song. im into music from people like justin timberlake and rhianna. and this reminded me very much of some of their work. specifically when she was rapping it sounded very much like when justin does. <br>  and ive actually heard a peice of this song before and i thought it was rhianna. <br>  thank you for posting this up it was really enjoyable and awesome to listen to. <br>  <br>  the second song i didnt like as much it wasnt bad but it wasnt as good as the first.|`|NQ37mnWkaa	Good evening, Lily :)<br>  <br>  I saw Santogold on Jools Holland's show last year.<br>  <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xKyFfDANST4" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xKyFfDANS...</a><br>  <br>  I quite enjoyed her music, and it did rather remind me of the 1980s, but I didn't find anything in it that made me want to rush out and hear more of it. But if she came on the radio, I'd let it play :)|`|ONWCXzUMaa	I did not like the music to the first song, it's just not my cup of tea<br>  But I really liked the second song.

1AdTCWe0aa	Yea its just a filler, cause they're transitioning to the part where sasuke kills orochimaru.<br>  <br>  this first site shows episode 90 or some where around there. the next site the chapter after that & is what is coming up soon after the recent filler episode.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.onemanga.com/Naruto/340/001/" rel="nofollow">http://www.onemanga.com/Naruto/340/001/</a><br>  <a href="http://www.onemanga.com/Naruto/343/01/" rel="nofollow">http://www.onemanga.com/Naruto/343/01/</a>|`|AA10280453	it's in a filler arc right now. it's not in the manga at all|`|ckeBvt23aa	The Naruto anime is in another stage called filler. The manga didn't really go into what we're watching. Some anime's do that they invent different or new material to work with. They don't always follow the manga. If you do start reading the Manga you won't be disappointed. When I began reading the manga I wasn't sure about if I would like it now I love it and wait up just to read it when it comes out at midnight on Friday mornings.|`|26bf3fd35c715fb12b9f6a291892831eaa	Its a filler. In the manga it should be near 343-344. But they added the filler; instead of Sasuke vs Orichimaru fight, they added the crystal girl story [which is not in the manga].

That makes me so mad at her! I wish she could find the power within herself to realize he messed up and she is too good for that. Next time she may not be so lucky... you know?<br>  <br>  I've heard the rumors that she told him she was pregnant, or she had and STD. I don't think I believe the STD thing. I think it was either pregnancy, or she was accusing him of cheating or something of that sort, and he snapped on her.|`|X6GTC3Teaa	It said chris was on steroids witch caused him to lose his temper. And yeah you're right she just doesn't care about her life.

My heart seemed crushed and I felt so sorry for Rihanna, but apparently she doesn't seem to mind that Chris Brown beat her up, so if she's happy that he did that, I guess we should just let them solve their own problems, and let them be.<br>  I mean you can trash talk on Chris Brown or talk about how stupid Rihanna is, but if they are truly in love, nothing will keep them from being together, so let's face facts: as long as they're happy, we can't do anything about it.

But when you think about it the same story line has been used on a regular basis.  <br>  <br>  Don't get me wrong if "Dirty Dancing" is on tv, I will sit down to watch it.  <br>  The problem with this film is that peoples opinions and how they have made it sound so much better than the film is.  Which in the long run will only disappoint someone who will watch the film for the first time.  <br>  <br>  Like I said I will watch the film and enjoy it, but I would not rate it as much as some people do.|`|uFXxdD0uaa	I don't like dirty dancing.

uAZlvHgiaa	A bunch of women have been abused. But the rich & famous make the news. She has an advantage most women don't. MONEY. She can afford to leave with out having to live on the street. She will also get police protection. Something most women don't get. Much sadder stories of abused women. myself included.|`|HmCAPy41aa	It makes me sick to.

ER8L9croaa	sounds normal to me, thats how i spent my teenage years|`|4aiA2ReVaa	I don't think it would be, abnormal i mean. teenagers are rebellious, they only want alcohol because they can't have it. definitly not abnormal, everyone needs a little kick-back sometimes|`|ujsSyiJfaa	I never did that but I was 17 in 1997 so that was a while ago now.

24UPDIBTaa	I think so. It may be awhile, but someone will probably come along. If not for the previous rules on returning champs, Ken Jennings might not even have the record.<br>  <br>  Wikipedia:<br>  Prior to 2003, a contestant who won five consecutive days was retired undefeated, with a guaranteed spot in the next Tournament of Champions.<br>  <br>  In September 2003 the show not only dropped the winnings limit but also the number of episodes on which a champion could appear. Champions can now remain on the program indefinitely until defeated, although champions who appear on five or more consecutive episodes no longer receive an automobile.
WkcYzNjSaa	It's his "SayNow"  It goes to a voicemail where you can leave a message and I've heard of some celebrities listening to some and even calling the person back.<br>  <br>  If you sign up for it - you will get a call from him (pre-recorded) every time he does a broadcast. It looks like he's been doing one once a week - and you can listen to past ones on the site, along with message and texts other people have sent. <br>  <br>  Check it out: <a href="http://www.saynow.com/souljaboytellem" rel="nofollow">http://www.saynow.com/souljaboytellem</a>|`|oJ313a1vaa	yeah!!!!!i talked to him for hours...we talked about everything!...I.D.I.O.T.!

tSU1BmGtaa	No its not, but Sakura is short tempered, scary, stalk on hot guys, abusive, and can't take a joke. Is that describing you? i mean its not THAT bad. Most pepple i know are like that, but i m not!|`|22tPNksKaa	As long as you aren't punching people through brick walls, or having an 'Inner you', screaming "Oh Yeah!" all the time, and as long as you aren't stalking a boy who has more important issues to deal with, you'll do okay. ^_^|`|6PSnZDhDaa	I believe it is a bad thing... because alot of people including myself hate Sakura's character in Part 1 of the Naruto series...<br>  <br>  She's noisy... short-tempered and mean especially to Naruto... hitting Naruto and anyone who says something is also one of those annoying traits... but by Part 2 she's nice...|`|im8OSdGTaa	Like people have said, it depends. Its bad if:<br>  1 You hit people for no reason<br>  2. Your short tempered<br>  3. You chase after guys because they're hot, and stalk them as a child and then claim you meant to be because you've known each other since childhod even though you never talked to him and stalked him from the sidelines because of his looks.<br>  4. Your ingorant towards people and mean because they act differently or your parents don't like them or something along that ****. Sakura treated naruto like crap because  he was 'annoying'. Plus, she was really hypocrytical because she was the annoying one in the end.<br>  <br>  Now, it's good if:<br>  1. (regards to number 3 and 4 on 1st list) You realized you don't really like those boys and have become a more open person. Your not really hypocrytical, and have realized that the person people use to think of as a burden is a really good friend and a nice person.<br>  2. You don't hurt people, but help heal and stand up for them instead.<br>  3. Your dedicated to things you do like Sakura is to her medical abilities.<br>  4. Your doing whatever you can to help get a friend back.<br>  5. (refers to Shippuden Sakura) Your mature and kind when it comes to helping friends or just hanging around with them.<br>  <br>  So yeah, theres my list. Take your pick.|`|hBEfrv23aa	Hahah, they might not mean it as necessarily an insult, but just something that they're pointing out :p<br>  <br>  It's not that hard to be like Sakura, and she isn't THAT bad, atleast not in Shippuuden! In shippuuden she's really cool :]<br>  <br>  Hahah people say I act like KARIN, and while I DO like her better than Sakura, it's still more insulting to be called Karin then Sakura xD|`|AA10280453	well, it depends if they really mean it, because if they do (from my opinion) that's bad, cuz she goes around hitting people whenever they say something she doesn't like.

PpaaRkm9aa	You know, i think it is too. Its not the biggest or best looking, but it had a certain charm to it that was lost in all the subsequent entries of the series.|`|6WQo6RpSaa	San Andreas is by far the best.<br>  <br>  It gives you the most amount of freedom, it has some of the best humor of all the games, the missions are incredibly varied and a lot fun, it has a great variety of environments (from the ghettos, to the city, to the Las Vegas style strip, to the woods, to a small mountain town, to the ritsy side of "Hollywood", and even to the top of a mountain!), it first introduced that awesome freestyle aiming system, it has the greatest weapon selection of all the games (try maxing out your sawed-off shotguns and duel-wielding them....epic destruction is sure to ensue :D ), it lets you use different hand-to-hand fighting styles, it has a vast amount of side-missions to keep you busy long after the main story is complete, it has the widest and most customizable selection of appearances for CJ (different outfits, hairstyles, health statuses (you can be fat, skinny, muscular, etc.)), it has all those different arcade games you can play (I love that Space Monkey game, and the bumblebee one is pretty good too :D ), you can go dancing, you can go to the gym and get fit, you can go to the basketball courts and shoot some hoops, you can break into an airport and actually fly any plane (even a commercial sized one! :O ), and last, but certainly not least, it has the flying cars cheat, which can provide many hours of entertainment all by itself :D<br>  <br>  Plus CJ is so badass :D|`|S0XArokKaa	No San Andreas is. Period.|`|k0dZeYQ6aa	gta 4 is the best<br>  then san andreas<br>  then 3|`|6qGY4cljaa	Vice City had a charm that I don't think the other GTAs could get. The radio stations MADE that game, and if you lived though the 80s, you'd probably get a lot of the humor.<br>  <br>  However San Andreas had an awesome storyline and character development, which I think is rare in a shooter kind of game.|`|RlmFTo91aa	I prefer San Andreas to Vice City, only because there's way more missions, and I like the storyline.|`|yiArumCVaa	No.  It was okay but not the best|`|79677842fc75f4c703b1a6bba9de5d48aa	i love it too|`|AA10026476	No it's not, IV is.

That's an idea..|`|mf2dnQA5aa	black eyeliner and neutral shadows makes me look a year or two older but i can make myself look even older|`|e1d902a1e3f67c79f0006f242202774daa	make-up and maybe trendy clothes may help.<br>  <br>  just act mature or act that you don't really care.
bHA2K4HYaa	The first thing you should do is stop by one of our AIM health facilities. They have videos called Porn 101 and Porn 102. This is also the place where you will need to get all your testing done. AIM is our health care system. They can also answer any questions you have about the business like who NOT to work for and such. <a href="http://www.aim-med.org/library/articles/1193272129/" rel="nofollow">http://www.aim-med.org/library/articles/...</a><br>  <a href="http://www.aim-med.org/library/articles/1193272187/" rel="nofollow">http://www.aim-med.org/library/articles/...</a><br>  Those are the links to the Porn 101 and 102 videos.<br>  <br>   If you want to start out a bit "slowly" try looking at Sexyjobs.com or adultstaffing.com <br>  <br>  You can also shoot your own home made porn and market it and sell it. Amateur stuff sells very well if you have a good marketing plan. There are so many different ways to be in this business. If you have more questions let me know.<br>  <br>  Make 100% sure this is something you want to do. Once you have done porn it is ALWAYS out there and it never goes away. People WILL find out that you do it. If you are ok with all of that good luck.|`|3mAgM405aa	Here's the most popular adult model agency in California:<br>  <br>  World Modeling aka Girls Entertainment, 4523 Van Nuys Blvd., Sherman Oaks, CA 91403 (818-986-4316).<br>  <br>  Remember to bring along a valid photo i.d. and a current HIV negative health certificate.<br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|HhCctLofaa	Your are so awful if your thinking about doing that or helping someone get into that!

Jeff and Larissa are perhaps effecting this asocial behavior for other reasons but vampires themselves do not exist.  <br>  <br>  The stories of vampires may have come from people who present a rare disease called porphyria, which is also known as the Vampire's Disease.  It causes people to be sensitive to sunlight and exhibit many of the other behaviors that vampires are said to exhibit, but it has a real biological source and the people affected are not "undead."|`|SbQigWzUaa	If you want to be dragged to the Happy Hotel for the rest of your life... go for it.

EUaIGX0Gaa	Use Physical Electric on Milotic<br>  Use a fire move on Lucario and Roserade<br>  Use Roar of Time on Garchomp<br>  Use any move on Spiritomb<br>  Use a physical move on Gastrodon<br>  <br>  Hope this helped<br>  Mip|`|6yMJbBuEaa	I'll give you a couple of hints on which moves will come in handy against each member of her team, but first see if you can find someone to trade your Machoke with so that you can evolve it.<br>  <br>  Spiritomb - It doesn't have any weaknesses but it's pretty easy to beat anyway. Just strike it with a solid move from your Dialga such as Earthquake or Earth Power. One or two should take it down.<br>  <br>  Gastrodon - It has lots of HP and a double weakness to Grass, so what you really need is someone with Giga Drain, but it looks like nobody on your team is capable of learning it. Maybe your Staraptor or Machoke/Machamp could take it down with some strong Physical moves.<br>  <br>  Milotic - Thunder Fang from Luxray is best to use here. Thunderbolt can be a bit problematic because the Milotic knows Mirror Coat.<br>  <br>  Roserade - Rapidash should be able to wipe it out in one with Flamethrower.<br>  <br>  Garchomp - Make sure your Empoleon knows Ice Beam, because Garchomp has a double weakness to Ice. The only problem here is it has Earthquake and Brick Break, which could put Empoleon in a bit of danger.<br>  <br>  Lucario - If you get the first move in, it's not usually that hard. Use Rapidash to Flamethrower it or Dialga to Earthquake/power it.
4NsFHupKaa	F: 6 - 4 - 2 - 1 - 6 - 4 - 2 - 1 ----- 4 - 2 - 1 - 3 - 1 - 2 - 1<br>  <br>  B flat: 1 - 6 - 4 - 3 - 1 - 4 - 2 - 1 ----- 3 - 1 - 3 - 1 - short2 - 2 - 1<br>  <br>  E flat: you can't play e flat in two octaves unless you have an f attachment (allowing you to play lower) or if you are VERY experienced and can play extraordinarily high.

I'll just put the lower one with the f attachment.

JKIBQ0m0aa	Absolutely not. That completely kills the point of it.<br>  <br>  What if you only had one question to ask? Would YOU pay $10 to ask a question?<br>  <br>  That would create so many problems. People don't answer enough as it is when this service is free. Imagine how few answers you would receive if this service cost 10 dollars a month.<br>  <br>  It's just not practical. Yahoo has enough money without having to charge for a service like this.<br>  <br>  Besides, Yahoo has no right to charge for a service like this. It's not like the yahoo CEOs come on here and answer questions...<br>  <br>  If anything, Yahoo should be paying US for providing them with customers, and paying US for keeping a service like this available.<br>  <br>  Pay for Yahoo answers... psh...<br>  <br>  Only a Democrat would even suggest such a thing.<br>  <br>  Us Republicans absolutely get nauseous at such an idea.|`|g2JqGIOCaa	NOPE!<br>  <br>  I wouldn't pay anything at all unless they corrected the problem of not allowing us to provide corrections to the thousand of "resolved questions" with very, very wrong answers.<br>  <br>  Plus, if Yahoo charged a fee, then Google would start up a similar service that was free.|`|l6mKwFb7aa	Nope. <br>  <br>  You reading this, Yahoo?

I love to just read all the activity and exchanges, anyway. And there really is no other site like this. Think about it.<br>  <br>  For example, during the recent election this site was the principal site that the news reporters were testing the waters and getting tons of free feedback. It really was important for the Obama campaign. Both Hillary and McCain failed to take the feedback seriously and they missed the boat. It can serve as an important indiator of current attitudes on just about anything, day by day, even hour by hour. I know of no other site that offers this advantage.|`|pQszqyTgaa	I would get really mad, but I wouldn't pay to use this. It does come in handy, but it really is useless.

A great example of waht you're asking would be Big Pun's "Twinz," which was a remix/cover of Dr. Dre's "Deep Cover." Just ask first and you should be okay. I'm not sure if this applies to live performances but I'd look it up if I were you (Google). As for making beats, you'll have to download one way or another. Go to piratebay.com and download fruity loops or audacity or garageband (you'll ned bit torrent).|`|wFLSl2Tsaa	They call it "sampling" and yeh you can get in trouble for it by using it without permission.

We slip into hell with a grimace but smile at last now that we had finally gotten what we deserve.

So funny!|`|365967a53f2df58d865575346fcc1152aa	My last good laugh was this afternoon, and I didn't even have to leave the house. About 2 months ago, someone hit my son's car while he was sitting at a stop sign. (The guy who hit him was on a stolen motorcycle.) This morning, my son had to go to court about this...he was subpoenaed. He sat down there for hours, waiting for his turn in the courtroom. When they finally called him, they realized that they didn't need him after all...they were supposed to have called the kid that stole the bike! Needless to say, he was not happy. The following 30 minutes was a hilarious tirade of the experience.

iXin5oS3aa	Is it the kind of "vibrato" type shakiness or is it losing-tone/pitch shakiness? If it's the latter I'd suggest practicing, not overdoing it, and for longer notes you really want to perfect breathing exercises. Best of luck!|`|LjEBVbHyaa	It's very normal and natural at the beginning, because you voice is tight or maybe you are a little bit nervous.<br>  <br>  Just take it easy, don't expect too much, practicemore, I think you'll be fine.|`|iCWKhbJSaa	Try seeing a vocal coach to strengthen your voice.|`|IWaxUqDzaa	It may be puberty.......|`|wRsSodTAaa	It could be nerves or your heart beat in your voice... or it could just be weak and shaky.

YxynqOvtaa	Sharon's mother hinted that she has done this before: the whole "losing time" thing, where's she's stealing stuff without realizing it and just not remembering how she got somewhere, etc. Her mother said it happened right after the accident that put her in a wheelchair. So i'm guessing this is Sharon's version of post traumatic stress syndrome. She's just going nuts from having sex with nick at the cabin and having him go back to Phyllis anyway, Noah hooking up with Eden, Brad dying, and her divorce from Jack. It's all just too much for her and they're making her crumble like a cookie. Should be interesting to see what happens. <br>  <br>  But yeah i totally agree with you, both me and my boyfriend (got him hooked, LOL) were like ummmmm what when she hooked up with Billy. And now she's hooking up with Nick again, apparently. I love her and Nick together...but man! Nick is such a moron! he needs to make up his mind!!<br>  <br>  sorry for the loooong answer! once you get me going on this its hard to shut me up :)|`|FNnRWRMSaa	I read that she is supposed to be suffering from multiple personality disorder.

Wild horses couldnt drive me away.|`|AA11369432	She is so in love with Nick , She is having a break down|`|AA10093245	she's developing kleptomania, nymphomania, obsessive compulsive, memory loss, confusion.... I don't know what her diagnosis will be, but she's really starting to lose it.<br>  And what's her mom got to do with it?<br>  I don't know where the writers are going with this storyline, but I am sure it will be interesting!|`|17d2bf173d4736ad8ae99a2e1672a131aa	she is loosing it completely... becoming a cleptomaniac and a nymphomaniac!!! she needs help, too much and many drama in her young life!!!<br>  No father figure, a sick mother, 2 failed marriages, she is becoming erratic... stealing makes her feel like she is in control of somebody elses life, she can get what she wants... when what she really wants is a happy family and emotional life!!|`|68654bf082c1e8a7ee2c6d6ad4e0ca0baa	Sharon has so turned backwards right now. She n Billy, he** no! I think Nick needs to quit talking to her unless he leaves Phyllis. Would love 2 c that!|`|AA11111233	She is clearly going off the deep end because between her divorce from Jack, losing Brad when we all knew she still had feelings, continually being rejected by Nick, Noah's near-death experience and whatever comes next, she's experiencing some major stress (let's all throw a pity party.)  I've read about her calling out Nick's name in Jack's presence, and thank God that it's just Jack, or else she would've got her *** whooped, like what happened with Cameron.  The only disease I think she has is slutitis, and it seems to be really contagious; Nick is going back and forth between her and Phyllis like a ping pong ball (from attempting to seduce Sharon, to having hot shower sex with Phyllis.<br>  <br>  I, too, think she will get pregnant and not know who the father is, Nick or Billy, which will further screw up her mental state.  All this talk about Nick and Sharon to be parents of baby Faith to complete Cassie's prophecy, but she'll welcome Baby UNFAITHFUL into the world instead.

G6Uy43coaa	OK....I'll take a stab at it...<br>  <br>  <br>  Sounds like he was luke warmly interested in someone and that ended.  While in the relationship, his mind was clouded and is now clear because a breath of fresh air (maybe someone new) cleansed it (showed him a better way).  He had an epiphany..based on the irresponsible actions of someone else (possibly a past lover).  That someone was not good in his life and left...when that happened, life as he knew it, as it should have been all along returned.  Hands off technique was employed (ceased further contact) and his common sense returned and remained fluid (water does not dry without changing)..when he returned to his right mind...the one who knows better...he instantly...shook off the ill effects of his past.

AA10297143	That rocked my morning.  I can now go to work with a good sense of humor.|`|Y1aAGPURaa	That was sooo funny!!!  Here's one for you:<br>  <br>  A young man wanted to purchase a gift for his new sweetheart's birthday and as they had not been dating very long, after careful consideration, he decided a pair of gloves would strike the right note: romantic but not too personal. Accompanied by his sweetheart's younger sister, he went to Nordstrom's and bought a pair of white gloves. The sister purchased a pair of panties for herself. During the wrapping, the clerk mixed up the items and the sister got the gloves and the sweetheart got the panties. Without checking the contents, the young man sealed the package and sent it to his sweetheart with the following note:<br>  <br>  "I chose these because I noticed that you are not in the habit of wearing any when we go out in the evening. If it had not been for your sister, I would have chosen the long ones with the buttons but she wears short ones that are easier to remove. These are a delicate shade, but the lady I bought them from showed me the pair she had been wearing for the past three weeks and they are hardly soiled. I had her try yours on for me and she looked really smart. I wish I were there to put them on for you the first time as no doubt other hands will come in contact with them before I have a chance to see you again. When you take them off, remember to blow in them before putting them away as they will naturally be a little damp from wearing. Just think how many times I will kiss them during the coming year!<br>  <br>  All my love.<br>  <br>  P.S. The latest style is to wear them folded down with a little fur showing."|`|2eXbueHkaa	you got my stars dear....

Hc9XZLblaa	My fiance is a sex offender too. And his "crime" was mistakenly walking into the wrong tent while deployed. He never even talked to the girl he walked in on. He walked in and then right back out. The sent him to jail and now hes a sex offender and has to register and has all kinds of restrictions over it all. I agree that there should be a lesser category for people with crimes like that. Ones that don't fit the bill for what we would normally think of in a sex offender.|`|HHyiLfAjaa	the 18 year old should have known better. he's 18 which meens ADULT! 16 yrs old meens CHILD! do the math the law is the law . <br>  sex offenders, molesters and rapists by the way should all be killed by a painful torturous death... coming from a victim at the age of 5 . so yeah go F*ck your self if you dont like it!<br>   <br>  you people dont know what its like till it happens to you! so stop talking as if you know!|`|xUDbzhWfaa	Yeah, I think of pedophiles, but I also think of rapists and sexual harassment, too.  Laws are too weak for sex offenders.  Most released are high risk, and if they're high risk, why release them?|`|4g2EAbtMaa	I agree that it's unfair. Perhaps they should implement a system of degrees so that people don't automatically assume the worst of that 18 year old, for example.|`|IizPFrELaa	Unfortunately that's so very true, I can sympathize with the 18 and 16yr scenario..<br>  <br>  Dont even get me started on CM's|`|AA11056847	execution|`|KfeeV5nraa	i think that is unfair but people who actually rape people like a 40 yr old and a 20 yr old unwillingly the should rot in jail<br>  answer mine?<br>  <a href="http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;_ylt=AljhSUVu7552EKV9A_QFPP_sy6IX;_ylv=3?qid=20090302183706AAH0uN3">http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;...</a>|`|gYyW39wTaa	Child Molesters|`|oclvWDzPaa	i think that they should not be counted as wen they are young like 18 but wen u no their acts were intentional and againest the child's will, well that's when authority's need to come in hand.|`|JNpwGaW1aa	Well I don't know, you seem to know a lot about them.|`|ZfN4SSmDaa	depends on the person. I have a friend who was 17 when he was going out with a girl who was 15. They were still going out 2 years later and because her mom hated him, she pressed charges and he was registered as a sex offender. <br>  <br>  However, anyone else who actually deserves punishment can have the death penalty. If they believe in hell, welcome to eternal damnation. If not, I hope they suffer in agony until the last breath.|`|bxnMQQMJaa	a 18 year old that sleeps with a 16 year old isn't a sex offender. A 45 year old, that rapes a 13 year old is a complete bum, that needs to be shot out of a cannon. I agree with you about the 18 year old, 16 year old thing, but I really don't think REAL sex offenders should be allowed to live.......I'm sorry, just my opinion<br>  <br>  <br>  EDIT: I'm saying they shouldn't be considered sex offenders|`|PFghQIq6aa	That's a sort of grey area. I don't think very many of us know what we're doing when we're 18 anyways. Feelings are strong when we're young. But you're supposed to know the rules. If you truly love someone, you will wait to be with them. When you're 50 & go after a 16 yr old, that's sick. I suppose it depends on the acts involved, also. I think they should be placed in a separate category away from the 50 yr olds. I don't believe one can be rehabilitated at that late stage, but it may not be too late for the 18 yr olds...|`|BVaCJkxzaa	If they are on the list, they are pervs and deserve what they get.|`|8XEIMuBqaa	I raped a man in the left eye socket with my finger.|`|1HnJXVSHaa	STAY AWAY FROM RAPISTS, KIDS.|`|90MSfEGSaa	i thinks its unfair too|`|yMgIoYmhaa	Well a 18 year old is an adult and a 16 year old is still a minor. The laws are there to protect minors. People at the age of 18 and over don't<br>  have the right to have sex with minors even if they are two or three years younger then 18. You say it's unfair for an 18 year old to be called a sex offender if he or she has sex with someone under the age of 18. Well if it's so unfair maybe the law should not say your an adult at the age of 18. <br>   If that happens other things would change that would not make you happy at the age of 18. Well that is my opinion. If you don't like what other people think you shouldn't post such a question.

It's the most noble job to care for others, it pays well, you can get a job anywhere anytime and you really make a difference in peoples lives.|`|tSJFfk8Aaa	nursing it makes you feel better about yourself to know that you saved someone's life and the family's doesn't have to go through any grief. and it pays really well and you will most likely always have a job.<br>  national salaries for RN certified hospital staff nurses is currently at $59,000.<br>  APN's can earn for more than regular RN certified nurses, earning upwards of 70,000 or more depending on their technical job specification and job title.

31e294ce712a597ce759cfa94a5efa6baa	Using illegal drugs is a waste of time and money. Almost all of them have been proved beyond a shadow of a doubt to cause lasting, usually irreparable damage to your body, especially your brain. Some of them imperil your life from the very first time you use them. Why take such a chance on possibly ruining at least some portion of my life for a temporary rush of endorphins, especially given that after the high wears off, you're left lower than where you started?<br>  <br>  In my specific case, my family has a history of addictive personalities, which is all the more reason for me not to get involved in something as stupid as recreational drug use.|`|2d798720df19272d2c93262dbfedc5a3aa	I do not do illegal drugs.

VomqGD7naa	i think that you should've never given a $270.00 camera to someone, no matter how best of a friend she/he may be; no one will take care of your things the way you will. This is very sad and I know you want your camera back or a replacement camera, but it doesn't sound like your so-called best friend cares if you have a camera or not, also it doesnt sound like she has any interest in paying you back. You should just think of it as a lesson learned because now you know that she may not be one of your "truest"friends.....a true friend would admit when she's wrong and do everything in her power to make sure that you got your camera back!!!!|`|FOeWqr0qaa	Well first of all when drinking I make sure my camera is always in my purse or at least within my sight because I know stuff gets lost. You should have done the same but I can understand, you trust your friends.<br>  <br>  Was your camera worth $270? If not, then don't ask that much.  Even then, you stupidly let her run off with it so aren't you at fault just as much as she? Yes, even if you refuse to admit it.<br>  <br>  Why are your parents involved? Are you a child? If you are then you deserve to lose your camera while illegally drinking. Tough love!<br>  <br>  It's your call if you want to lose a friend over this. I'm 22 and trust me my friends have lost and borrowed many of my items never to be seen again and I've never asked them to replace it because I know my friends are worth more than some silly product and what happens if I lose something of theirs? I would expect them to "let it go" too.<br>  <br>  I guess I'm just not materialistic!|`|tDU347knaa	I think this is one of those "lesson learned" situations. You didn't have to give her the camera. That was your choice.<br>  <br>  Is it worth losing a friend over? She doesn't seem to be much of a friend.<br>  <br>  Yes, have your parents talk to her parents. It's possible it might work, unless her parents are like her. <br>  <br>  Edit: You don't state your age, but, since you're asking about getting your parents involved, you sound quite young. I'm wondering if your parents and your friend's parents know that you were out drinking. That could cause problems, too.|`|NirBfNfMaa	Ah she is lying!<br>  <br>  You know, Californians do NOT get tax refunds this year, we are getting I.O.Us. So, in April you are going to get another I.O.U.<br>  <br>  I'd give her an ultimatum. Pay you back or the friendship is over. In high school one of my friends did this to me. Luckily it was only a pair of shoes, but I really think she kept them on purpose. Yes she did give me the "I loaned them to a friend" bit. It's a lie, and someone like that is NOT your friend.<br>  <br>  P.S. in response to one of your previous questions,I usually do 10 all-nighters during a college term, ALL of which could be avoided if I would just study/ start writing my paper earlier :P

1C123Xdsaa	You don't cook sushi.... well, that's not exactly true. As I understand it, sushi refers to the vinegared rice only. If the vinegar solution isn't added to the rice, it's not sushi.The strips of raw fish on the rice is called sashimi, as it is when it is served without the rice. So, the raw fish is called sashimi, whether it's with rice or not, the vinegared rice is called sushi, so yes, you do cook sushi. Unless you want to eat raw rice.|`|lFzFtiCBaa	you dont actually COOK sushi,...you prepare it.|`|ujsSyiJfaa	You're funny.

fLnXOGLIaa	I think Black men are attractive but none have ever asked me out! I'd date them!|`|AA12282580	I dont care what society has to say. I am personally not attracted to black men. They have a bad name for being players too. At least where I live in San Diego. I get hit on a lot by black men too. I noticed they like curvier ladies. I hate to put them all in one catogory because there are exceptions but I feel like they use women and have the women pay the bills and give them money, plus they are cheap and dont tip and cheat on women.<br>  I am NOT racisit but just giving you my honest opion of what I have seen personally. I have dated black men in the past and my best friend is black and she agrees with me.|`|FPTgqmZLaa	No, I live in California and I haven't seen a problem over here.  I am a white guy but black ladies are hard to come by because they are less than 10% of the population where I live.  Most mixed race couples over here involve people like Asians, Latinos and whites mixing together.|`|S2tBYhCKaa	I had an opportunity to date a black person from the island of <br>  New Ireland in Oceania but she needed more time on her senior <br>  thesis.

They could be white, black, yellow, brown or red. Colour is only skin deep, whats inside is far more important. If society doesnt like it then boohoo to them.|`|YNKyEk4faa	Im 16..and I havent dated a black person but I wouldnt refrain from it either.  Personally, I find black guys more attractive than white guys.

Color doesn't matter to me|`|NnDkqau6aa	Honestly, when I am dating someone of a different ethnicity, it isn't a big deal until we get certain reactions from others, including friends, families and strangers. And even then, those reactions are usually little wise cracks that don't really mean much, especially when we don't let it bother us. In my opinion, it is more socially acceptable than ever and not as big of a deal.|`|C4oe8nURaa	i have not dated a black guy, but i might if he was interested. one of my black friends is dating a white guy, and i see no problem with it, they actually look really cute together! honestly as long as theres attraction, god made men and women compatable, no matter what color they are!<br>  (omg i didnt mean that to sound so sexual! haha sorry, but you know what i mean!)|`|eO1FP40haa	i would definitlely date a black man. race is NOT an issue with me. although i do feel its not accepted by society ecspecially black people. thats why i usually go for mixed guys because its more accepted because their half white|`|y2t3F690aa	So your saying i cant answer this cuz i aint white?<br>  <br>  My boyfriend is white&black|`|3Hj5Vu5maa	Although I have never dated a black man/woman, I am definitely attracted to them.

My personal favorite is asian women though, especially japanese.  A white guy who says he wouldn't date Halle Berry, Rihanna or Toni Braxton is just nuts.|`|5ORGHCAJaa	well<br>  took the words rite outta my mouth|`|EncopDCmaa	NO way! I would date any guy who is a good person. I kinda have a crush on a guy who is black and I'm fair (irish). There are some ugly and some beautiful people of all races. Screw what society think if you like the person. I think interracial marriages and people who date is a wonderful thing!  A lot of my friends are black too.|`|zhrGiQsKaa	i am not racist but i am personally not attractive to black men, but some black men i do find attractive. it all depends on the person, but i prefer not to date black men.|`|u1T5TQP7aa	I would have to say I refrain, but no not because I am racist, and as for the society not finding it acceptable screw that that is not a good reason, I just find white people more attractive and to my liking...|`|s7UWLOS9aa	I would date a black person. I've done it before. I don't give a **** about your color, its the personality that I like.|`|AA11693263	I am not racist nor do I find black people unattractive. I think there are many good looking people of all races and I also think there are not so attractive people of all races. It doesn't matter to me what someones skin color is as long as they are good on the inside. I am married so I would be in a world of trouble if I dated anyone :) haha If I were single and someone asked me out and I was attracted to them and he was a decent, kind, funny, Intelligent man then I would go out with him. Whether he was white or not.|`|43JgLpkKaa	no , i have never dated anyone that was not white. i just would not feel comfortable dating outside my race . works for some , but not all. i do have friends that have dated other races and some have even married a person of another race.|`|hJHl4HmSaa	My ex boyfriend and currently one of my best friends is black.<br>  So, yes. Of course<br>  <br>  I don't really care about the color of my man as long as he's funny and sexy.<br>  <br>  Plus, it didn't hurt that me and him had known eachother for forever before we went out. We're just friends again, though.|`|hfRiTud3aa	it all depends how dark is your skin and if you look hot and sexy to me, have a nice body.you know when a guy looks hot to me i don't think about their skin  but i cheek their personality, how they are  stuff like that|`|Xnx7p7OHaa	I've dated a black person before.....and an English person, a South American and an Italian.

NAhEQiXyaa	the elmo is gonna kill you one|`|1czGZ8nBaa	I think the craziest I've actually heard is a random ring tone my old friend did last year. Her phone accidentally went to the recorder thing and it recorded what she said, I think it went like this:<br>  'Oh my gosh, I actually can fit in my Skinny Jeans now after I've starved myself'<br>  It went through it two times. It was crazy. But I've heard worse.<br>  <br>  Like example one I heard at the store one time<br>  <br>  It went like this:<br>  <br>  At first it made a cow sound, and then a person screamed out 'Oh my goodness it gave birth!'<br>  <br>  LOL. That's the craziest I've heard.|`|4NI6QDDuaa	well, i've heard allot of weird ones like: <br>  <br>  the barney theme song, <br>  a woman having an orgasm, <br>  elmo telling them to pick up their phone or he'll shoot them, and  <br>  a cow getting hit by a semi <br>  <br>  but the weirdest of all i think was one my friend made on her bf's phone, listing all the things she would do to him if he didn't 'answer the d*mn phone'|`|Klk25W7Gaa	My husband had this really annoying Family Guy one.

70OHpjySaa	No, people don't really "love" money.<br>  They need it and sometimes they want lots of it but they don't "love" it.<br>  <br>  Now they love the idea of what a lot of money could bring them...but that idea cannot love them back either. <br>  As long as you want it, money is okay but once you have it too much of it, you realize it does not make you happier, in fact, it makes you miserable, just because it does not make you happier, so you're disappointed, and also it's a lot of work and worries, when you have to spend time taking care of it and all your possessions.|`|2tn8EALqaa	uh, yes.<br>  Easily.|`|MHoTbF2laa	Money loves me|`|UtzALxfjaa	money DOES love me. or else it wouldn't be making its way toward me ;)<br>  <br>  just playing. i am actually don't positive. its just like chocolate, you love it, i love it. but it doesn't love you back.|`|crnjv96Faa	it's more like THEY ADDICTED TO MAKING IT, AND BEATING THEIR OWN RECORDS AND HAVING MORE AND STTING MORE RECORDS, AND NOT NEVER WANTING TO GO AS LOW AS...AGAIN|`|AXAyuFW8aa	Think about the economy right now....that should give you your answer.|`|5ORGHCAJaa	idk<br>  <br>  y do people live in tornado alley|`|lQaeb2wNaa	There are people who love others who don't love them.

You can buy anything you want with it, and without money you are nothing. You can't find Love without some money, You need money to get into clubs...so you can find a boyfriend.

A huge Tsunami can come any day now....|`|2KAqLbqiaa	I know, right! Jesus, I hate money. I had to shovel snow out of someone's walkway, and they offered me $25 bucks, I was like "No thanks, you keep your cash." Money is so dumb.  It's the source of most of the world's problems.

This is why the stereotypical rich guy hates his wife and doesn't seem happy all the time.|`|IyLnCrpOaa	I know what you're saying, and yeah, I guess people have "lust" for money.

jQbKPzX0aa	this happened when I was 12.<br>  one saturday night, I went to bed really late(3 or 4 am). The next sunday morning I had to get up really early for mass. Naturally I kept dozing throughout mass like a bobble head. I was able to keep my cool for quite a long time, but.....towards the end of the mass I finally dose off, and fall on some woman's lap and she lets out this weird shriek. I wake up with a shock to find almost every one in the hall (including the priest) staring at us and this guy (who I think was her husband) gives me the 'im gonna kill you' look. I felt so mortified. I still cant live that incident down :o(|`|vyz7uICNaa	umm.. well my mom (yesterday)just found out who i am crushing on but i never told her and i don't really tell her those kind of things.i don't really care how that she found out i like him it's the way she found out that is embarassing because i tutor at my little sister's school,and when i am bored i write like little notes saying"i love ___________"<br>  and things like "mrs._______" so when i had a note like that on my dresser i guess she went inside my room probably looking for something so she read the note and then she told me about the guy's name,and the cherry on top of everything that has happened to me so far was te fact that my soon to be step-dad was there when she told me about the guy i liked and she was saying things like"oh, who's _______,?" (and because i was on the computer at the time) she said "are you talking to _____________?" and i felt so red and very hot,that she was saying this on front of my step-dad!! i don't think i will eber forgive her for that!!|`|oVTByK2Yaa	ur spelling's wrong .................u must really b embarassed!!!|`|WKcJE9bKaa	I was at a water park and my sister and another girl were about to go on a slide, and I wasn't being very careful about how wet the ground was.  I slipped and fell, and I was so embarrassed I kept my eyes closed and I didn't want to get up, and everyone thought I was unconscious.  Eventually I got up.<br>  <br>  It was stupid of me, but I tend to humiliate myself even further in embarrassing situations.

QXl6GdNBaa	Critics:<br>  Any Oscar-nominated films that are still playing in your local theater(s): Slumdog Millionaire, Doubt, The Wrestler, The Reader, Revolutionary Road, The Curious Case of Benjamin Button, etc.<br>  <br>  My opinion:<br>  My "girl-as-friends" enjoyed He's Just Not That Into You, but didn't like Confessions of a Shopaholic. I found My Bloody Valentine 3D to be good, but you won't be seeing it in 3D in theaters anymore because of The Jonas Brothers movie. I enjoyed The Uninvited, but it wasn't particularly scary. I found Friday the 13th to be mediocre. I didn't like Push and found Bride Wars to be lame and below-mediocre.<br>  <br>  I say if you want a romantic comedy: He's Just Not That Into You<br>  if you want a horror: The Uninvited (since MBV: 3D is not playing in 3D anymore)<br>  if you want an action: Taken<br>  <br>  Haven't seen any comedies released this year yet, because they have been getting pretty bad reviews.|`|PeRMKqTpaa	Taken is awesome!|`|hf5RgDzwaa	The Knowing<br>  <br>  i think it just came out today|`|3d8h9HGiaa	Medea goes 2 jail<br>  friday the 13th|`|xlKsXs38aa	13B " After a long time a good thriller with snazzy editing a orignal story trasforming into good movie with all the essentials required for a seat edge thriller, A good week end time pass!!!!!!!!!!!!

Even when they are ticked off.|`|556f6a84a1e72fa5f9fa440c37251fe4aa	I'm a man who likes women.  ^__^<br>  <br>  1) I generally like the hair either blonde or black, and *one* color, no dirty blonde or highlights stuff.<br>  <br>  2) Bright colors, blues or greens.<br>  <br>  3) I like clear skin...either tan or pale, so long as it's smooth and not messed-up.  I don't have *many* racial preferences...but *Ideally* she'd be asian or caucasian (european).  This doesn't *have to* be so...I know, life is rarely ideal and there's beautiful women everywhere.<br>  <br>  4) Short.  This way she can wear high heels on occasion without towering over me.  ^_^<br>  <br>  5) Curvy.  There's just plain more to work with, and a defined waist *looks better* on a woman with actual hips and breasts.<br>  <br>  6) Not so muscular....but not for the reasons you think.  It's not the muscle that bugs me, so much as it is that lean, muscular women tend to get this *jaw* going.  You know?  If she has muscle and still has a girly face, it's cool.<br>  <br>  7) Outgoing, somewhat...I'm the shy one.  If she were shy too we might not ever *meet* or talk, you know?<br>  <br>  8) Funny is good in moderation....but I don't want her snarking on everything I have to say either.<br>  <br>  9) Smart.  She has to be able to understand me and what I'm saying, and it helps to be smart if we have similar interests.  Besides, it's easier for a smart person to *play* dumb than it is for a dumb person to *get a brain*, you know?<br>  <br>  10) Other?  I strongly prefer *Cute* to overtly hot.  Sometimes a woman can try *too* hard to be "sexy" and it ends up being a turn-off instead.  I prefer someone approachable.<br>  <br>  I know....never happen.

NIdze2ncaa	If his hands are on your hips you can put urs on his or on his wrists.Or when i grind if his hands are on my hip (if you kno how to the do the snap dance) ill still be grinding but will be snapping my fingers as i grind but not doing the full crazy snap dance just grind and have you hands and arms as you would if you were doing that.Ive found most times when grinding to reggaeton that the guy will want to hold you hands (interlaced) and usually pull u closer while still hold ur hands.If your dancing to a song like low - lil john where it says to get low you dont av to but i usually but my hands on my thighs and get semi low (not like to the ground low and touch my toe my toes low)just low enough that i can grind myself back up lol.And if your grinding to slow song (i.e. Bed -j hooliday and maybe caught up - Usher if you can maintain the slow grind ) you can put your arms around his heck.but remember to have fun.<br>  <br>  Hoped to helped if u want me to elaborate on anything just email me.|`|GIkyDUulaa	grinding is a poor excuse for dancing.  <br>  <br>  you wiggle your hips in a circle while shoving your butt at their crotches. <br>  <br>  caution: beware of boners.

jLvlcoFBaa	They are not always doing it. Actors have a choice. They don't have to make a film if they don't want too. Many are too old.<br>  <br>  Not true 3 answers below.<br>  <br>  Daniel Craig was Barbara Broccoli's first choice for the role of Bond.<br>  <br>  Where do you people come up with this stuff?|`|9pLqulLwaa	It's called "age".<br>  <br>  They've been making James Bond films since 1962; if they want to keep making them, they have to keep finding guys that are "age-appropriate" for the role.  Roger Moore is probably the actor most guilty of over-staying his welcome in the role (he's positively gross in A View To A Kill).|`|r9rPHeSCaa	coz as their stardom increases they ask more money<br>  <br>  that why Pierce brosnan was replaced for casino Royale|`|knKVjOE6aa	Because they get old and sometimes they want to move on to do other things.|`|kYMD4tSmaa	because there sexyness wears off ." except for sean connery!"|`|zvq3uiB6aa	Because people get old and gross!|`|kPMxo2MCaa	So the series won't get boring.

The ONLY way?? uhm...<br>  <br>  nahhhh. i'd live off of bread. =;P|`|FLAtdWrmaa	I wouldn't.  No.<br>  <br>  In many ways, prostitutes are paid-professional victims.  Even in the best circumstances (legal brothels in middle-class neighborhoods around the world), a prostitute is subject to verbal and physical abuse every time she/he "makes a sale."  Every "sale" also brings with it the possibility of unwanted pregnancy, nasty disease, or killer disease.  Every "sale" might be one that ends as a rape (and unpaid, of course).  Because of the desire for privacy during sex, and the direct and intimate physical contact, there is almost no way to protect a prostitute from harm on all occasions.  It only takes *one* nasty customer ......<br>  <br>  Add to this the fact that even where some prostitution is legal and regulated, prostitutes themselves are not respected generally.  It makes for continuing harassment.<br>  <br>  Where prostitution is strictly illegal, it's even worse for the workers.  For them, we have the parasitism of the "protectors," that is, the pimps.  There may be nice ones in this bunch, but mostly they are out for what they can get.  Young attractive women are not people to them.  Young attractive women are little golden paths to wealth for the pimp.  Pimps often do whatever they have to, to keep "their girls" in line and earning money.  And I do mean, *whatever* they have to do.  Beatings are common, as is fostering drug addiction so the girls are dependent on him (usually it's a "him").  If a "girl" doesn't like her pimp, there are nasty consequences for her for finding another pimp to replace him.  Street prostitutes who don't have pimps don't live long -- other prostitutes' pimps don't want loners competing with "their girls," and have no problem using violence to get rid of competition.<br>  <br>  So, no, I would not choose this as a career.  If I were going to take that many risks in my professional life, I'd choose something way more exciting and interesting, like marine biology, or caving guide, or alligator-wrestling.|`|dyv2sqtxaa	No because it is illegal and you could get killed and nobody would ever know who or where. And because I could get pregnant and not know who the father is. If I had no other way of getting money, I would be a stripper. You have to swallow your pride, but at least your risk of getting hurt killed or pregnant isn't as great. Being a prostitute, the chances are almost 100%.|`|3IimJWgXaa	i think if i ever really went down the wrong road with friends or career, i think i would. i have a very very long past history with rape, molestation, incest etc. with out true friends that make me feel loved?

Now they kinda suck.|`|sZ0ENVWfaa	Well, I am a fan of Ronnie...but when he said he "was Escape the Fate" and that it is his...that really got me mad. Cause even though he made it, he doesnt own the band. Of course he "made" the band, its not just his and he was ruining the band. They had no choice but to kick him out and ask Craig. Ronnie is good, but the fact he started a brawl and got someone killed, and got selfish with the band, he seems like a jerk to me. And I loved Ronnie until I figured out what he said...but dont get me wrong, Ronnie is still a good singer...if he never made them bad choices he would be my favorite singer ever.

26cae2932c19d290ec2e4570f9542e0baa	Which show?<br>  <br>  The medical terminology for the most part is correct since they do have technical advisors on every show like that. But the cures and even the problems themselves are generally not real and made up for dramatic purposes.<br>  <br>  Something like CSI, viewers are going to expect them to have plausible situations. A show like Scrubs or daytime soaps, no one cares about the actual illnesses.|`|AA11809403	some of it is correct. <br>  <br>  shows like House, ER, Grey's anatomy take more care to match the symptoms, thedisease, the treatment, and the time to heal than daytime soap operas are.<br>  <br>  and they are all more realistic in terms of blood than they were in the 1950s and 1960s.|`|yqx9YTBJaa	Uh...what show?<br>  <br>  Most shows have medical advisers--people with actual medical backgrounds with whom the writers consult to make sure their storylines are relatively sound.<br>  <br>  They depart from reality a bit to make the story more exciting or dramatic or whatever, and different shows will obviously stray further or stay more medically sound.<br>  <br>  House, for instance, pretty much sticks to things that are medically possible (though not very probably).  Because the whole point of the show is that they specialize in obscure diagnoses, they can use really far fetched conditions but stay technically possible.<br>  <br>  Then you have the more soap-opera-y shows, which have audiences that aren't going to care as much because they're paying attention to romances or whatever, so they don't need to be scientifically sound.

So ANTM is really going out on a limb by doing something different.<br>  I hope it will give shorter girls the chance to show what they've got. You don't need to know how to model- they can teach you that- you just need to have the look for the job.<br>  I also wanted to say that I have loads of tips on dealing with being short, like what styles suit a shorter body etc, so if you want to talk more I'd love to hear from you.

AA10363258	That's a good question, I always wondered that too.  I don't know but i'm guessing not because how would they know?  I also found it amusing how we all know that the other mom is going to choose for the family that she is trading with but then they act shocked when they are told that.  How long has this show been on now, how can it still be a surprise??

RLs0skyNaa	4 for u<br>  <br>  A man told the ringmaster that he was interested in joining the circus as a lion tamer. The ringmaster asked if he had any experience<br>  <br>  The man said, "Why, yes. My father was one of the most famous lion tamers in the world, and he taught me everything he knew."<br>  <br>  "Really?" said the ringmaster. "Did he teach you how to make a lion jump through a flaming hoop?"<br>  <br>  "Yes he did," the man replied.<br>  <br>  "And did he teach you how to have six lions form a pyramid?"<br>  <br>  "Yes he did," the man replied.<br>  <br>  "And have you ever stuck your head in a lion's mouth?"<br>  <br>  "Just once," the man replied.<br>  <br>  The ringmaster asked, "Why only once?"<br>  <br>  The man said, "I was looking for my father."<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  2. A driver is pulled over by a policeman. The police man approaches the driver's door....<br>  <br>  "Is there a problem Officer?"<br>  <br>  The policeman says, "Sir, you were speeding. Can I see your licence please?"<br>  <br>  The driver responds, "I'd give it to you but I don't have one."<br>  <br>  "You don't have one?"<br>  <br>  The man responds, "I lost it four times for drink driving."<br>  <br>  The policeman is shocked. "I see. Can I see your vehicle registration papers please?"<br>  <br>  "I'm sorry, I can't do that."<br>  <br>  The policeman says, "Why not?"<br>  <br>  "I stole this car."<br>  <br>  The officer says, "Stole it?"<br>  <br>  The man says, "Yes, and I killed the owner."<br>  <br>  At this point the officer is getting irate. "You what!?"<br>  <br>  "She's in the boot if you want to see."<br>  <br>  The Officer looks at the man and slowly backs away to his car and calls for back up. Within minutes, five police cars show up, surrounding the car. A senior officer slowly approaches the car, clasping his half drawn gun.<br>  <br>  The senior officer says "Sir, could you step out of your vehicle please!"<br>  <br>  The man steps out of his vehicle. "Is there a problem sir?"<br>  <br>  "One of my officers told me that you have stolen this car and murdered the owner."<br>  <br>  "Murdered the owner?"<br>  <br>  The officer responds, "Yes, could you please open the boot of your car please?"<br>  <br>  The man opens the boot, revealing nothing but an empty boot.<br>  <br>  The officer says, "Is this your car sir?"<br>  <br>  The man says "Yes," and hands over the registration papers.<br>  <br>  The officer, understandably, is quite stunned. "One of my officers claims that you do not have a driving license."<br>  <br>  The man digs in his pocket revealing a wallet and hands it to the officer. The officer opens the wallet and examines the licence. He looks quite puzzled. "Thank you sir, one of my officers told me you didn't have a license, stole this car, and murdered the owner."<br>  <br>  The man replies, "I bet you he's lying by telling you I was speeding, too!"<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  3. A husband and wife are traveling by car from Key West to Boston. After almost twenty-four hours on the road, they're too tired to continue, and they decide to stop for a rest.<br>  <br>  They stop at a nice hotel and take a room, but they only plan to sleep for four hours and then get back on the road. When they check out four hours later, the desk clerk hands them a bill for $350.<br>  <br>  The man explodes and demands to know why the charge is so high. He tells the clerk although it's a nice hotel, the rooms certainly aren't worth $350.<br>  <br>  When the clerk tells him $350 is the standard rate, the man insists on speaking to the Manager.<br>  <br>  The Manager appears, listens to the man, and then explains that the hotel has an Olympic-sized pool and a huge conference center that was available for the husband and wife to use.<br>  <br>  "But we didn't use them," the man complains.<br>  <br>  "Well, they are here, and you could have," explains the Manager.<br>  <br>  He goes on to explain they could have taken in one of the shows for which the hotel is famous. "The best entertainers from New York, Hollywood and Las Vegas perform here," the Manager says.<br>  <br>  "But we didn't go to any of those shows, "complains the man again.<br>  <br>  "Well, we have them, and you could have," the Manager replies.<br>  <br>  No matter what facility the Manager mentions, the man replies, "But we didn't use it!"<br>  <br>  The Manager is unmoved, and eventually the man gives up and agrees to pay. He writes a check and gives it to the Manager.<br>  <br>  The Manager is surprised when he looks at the check. "But sir," he says, this check is only made out for $50."<br>  <br>  "That's correct," says the man. "I charged you $300 for sleeping with my wife."<br>  <br>  "But I didn't!" exclaims the Manager.<br>  <br>  "Well, too bad," the man replies. "She was here and you could have."<br>  <br>  4. A man and a lady were at the bank. The lady asks the man what she should use for a password. For humor, the man typed in "MY PENIS" and hit enter. The lady started laughing because the screen said "NOT LONG ENOUGH"<br>  imao|`|KdSvADi2aa	where is a pirates fabvorite place to eat out?<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  answer-arrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrbys-arbys|`|2eXbueHkaa	I dont have to tell you the answer to do I ???????<br>  <br>  smiling at cha...<br>  <br>  <br>  "Times are hard in a small rural town, business is slowing and people are moving out. It so happens that there are two horse-dealerships in town. Unfortunately there's only enough people to support one of the dealerships. So the two owners meet and decide that one of them must leave town. Since neither of them want to leave they devise a competition to see who gets to stay. It is decided that they will race their horses across town. Now they don't want to damage their horses, so they change the race rule so that whoevers horse crosses the finish post LAST wins the race and gets to stay in town. So the next day they set off. Both are ambling along, taking rests and getting nowhere nearer to finishing. After a few hours a wise old man tells them to dismount and gives them some advice. After which the two sprint back to the horses, get on and gallop towards the finish line. Assuming that the race rules were not changed - what advice did the old man give them ?"|`|DHO5baDuaa	a yo mamma joke:YO MAMMA CLAIMED SHE WAS SKINNY AND EVEN NARUTO DIDN'T BELIEVE IT|`|SMw9y3b1aa	um yo amma joke: yo mamma so dumb she drove by the YMCA and was like look they spelled MACYs wrong haha :D

GO0FqfOIaa	hmm, i see your side of the story, and i mean like you said, you just wanted their opinion, nothing more. But i wouldn't have done it to the "prom" or what evs you americans call it.. I would have said that at like another event your school has, something a little less boring than the dance. But yes, i see your point, the poor starving kids in Africa. mm. it's hard. but there are a lot of girls who like count down the days. lmao. so um. yeah, i wouldn't have said it for that thingy, like maybe another function meeting.|`|y9N3DsKBaa	There is too much missing information to be precise.

UnPjfLPNaa	It should be temporary, thank God!  But how your voice will end up after it's all said and done is anyones guess!  Best of Luck!!|`|BJERgbM5aa	Your voice is still changing.  That's normal.  Sometimes it takes a year, sometimes longer.  But it will resolve itself.  And when it does, your singing pitch as well as your ability to match/carry a tune will improve dramatically.  Everything occurring to your voice now is normal.|`|nGkCWpRVaa	it will settle down very quickly|`|iXin5oS3aa	You should be on vocal rest. Let your voice change completely before you go into singing. You can potentially damage your range if you start doing things that are unhealthy while your voice is changing. Take a break from it until you aren't cracking anymore.

My dad felt like that too and said, "all men are pigs.." It could be that. Is there anyway for Evan to spend time with his girlfriend and her father in order to build mutual trust? I think maybe the father doesn't know him and would rather not have her communicate with someone he doesn't know. Evan could also talk to the father and see if it is a trust issue or exactly what the problem is, and work out some kind of solution. I am sure Evan is a really nice guy, but he needs to understand that trust takes time, especially for a parent.|`|bSPoA7H4aa	You need to tell him to just wait and give it time.

Carlisle...he just wouldn't fight. loll...<br>  <br>  Alice would totally win for the girls!|`|4dwzZyvsaa	For the guys, I would either pick Emmett or Edward because Emmett is really strong and Edward in the fastest in the family<br>  <br>  For the girls, I would pick Alice because she is active and competitive|`|AA10665398	Hmmm...<br>  I think either Emmet or Edward would win from the guys because Emmet's strong and Edward can read thoughts.<br>  From the girls i think that Alice would win because she can already see what's going to happen and make it to her advantage. =)|`|bHt24VPcaa	Emmett would win out of guys.<br>  <br>  Alice would win out of girls. She'd get some intense training ahead of time, lol.|`|JLrs8bxdaa	Hmmmmmm . . .<br>  With girls I think it would be Esme, Bella, Alice vs. Rosalie.  Renesme wouldn't fight.  Alice would totally win, she kicks @$$ !  <br>  It wold be all against Rosalie, because, well, you know Rosalie xD<br>  <br>  <br>  With the guys, idk why but I would think Jasper and Emmet vs Edward and Carlisle.  Again, don't ask why, but that's how I would picture it.  <br>  I would think that Emmet and Jasper would win, first off because Emmet is so friggin strong, and Jasper is strong too, because he is fairly new, younger than Edward and Carlisle.  Carlisle and Edward are also the oldest *in vampireness*.<br>  <br>  <br>  xD|`|RT6ahlvmaa	LOL, if those are my choices.  Out of the girls Alice would win and out of the guys Emmet would win=D|`|mizWgdjuaa	Either way, I hope Bella dies.|`|PjDXFpeGaa	alice aganist bella.<br>  and yes bella dies.<br>  shes a wimp that whines.|`|405b47863f96696ecc3415e084e85ab8aa	Rosalie would win the girls' fight and Carlisle would win the guys' fight.
HCHqzkQraa	Sunburn does not cause freckles<br>  but it does cause permanent skin damage.<br>  <br>  Use a sun block, or shield your skin, from the sun.<br>  Freckled people burn more easy than dark or olive skinned people.|`|ecfdaa0025f15f95c0f55c59a87b000aaa	Yes it can and it can also cause skin cancer.|`|dk8y4eseaa	Possibly, and those freckles from the sun can turn into melanoma moles which results in skin cancer|`|gea2XyUwaa	Well, I have had freckles for as long as I can remember, and they are pretty much permanent, except they fade out a little as you get older.  I couldn't say for sure, but i don't know anybody who has gotten rid of freckles, except if they wear makeup over it or something.|`|XdjMyJYMaa	What is it about sunburn and sunscrean questions? You know it's only march, we have months of dull grey weather to get through before we start thinking about sunburn.|`|VhHVjMe8aa	Freckles are Angle kisses!  But yes sunburns can be a cause of skin cancer, so use sun block!|`|pdqJjvrwaa	yeh it can, I fell asleep on a lilo when I was on holiday a few years back, I badly burn my shoulders and now they have a lot of freckles on.<br>  When ever I take my top off for a long period of time my shoulders always blister uo,|`|X6BMNCF6aa	yes it does cause damage and the thing is you probley cant even notice but as you get older a skin cancer may just all of a sudden appear out of no where and yes as above it causes your skin to age|`|AEXJcpmHaa	freckles arent skin damage.....sunburn can make your skin age faster and potentially cause skin cancer if youre not careful

8yE2sYGeaa	As long as it is handled properly.<br>  <br>  Mahoromatic has crateloads of ecchi and it is just so much fun to watch, as it is so funny (let me direct you to Season 2, Episode 3, "Dreams Should be Grand")<br>  <br>  I have also seen ecchi in Ninja Nonsense, My HiME, Magical Play and Jungre de Ikou, but these were all humorous use of it|`|8rXSbYEsaa	Haha not really.<br>  <br>  but yukie like My HiME!|`|0vt1oUyfaa	i actually like that kind of anime and shuffle is an awsome one,<br>  i find it relaxing and it takes my mind off annoying things easily|`|ryLbKatoaa	I love etchi, though I'm not big on the anime stuff.

oHKpy4IRaa	Ok, so one time I went to the store with my family and I really, really had to go to the bathroom. I absolutly hate going to the bathroom in public bathrooms so I was trying to hold it in but I just couldn't so I went to the bathroom. Now I'm just going to the bathroom thinking "this isn't as bad as I thought" then all of  a sudden a little girl walks in the bathroom stall that I was in (the lock didn't work on any of the doors) and instead of leaving she just walks in and shuts the door behind her. I didn't say anything becuase I am shy and I had no idea what to say. While I was in the bathroom someone else was in the stall next to me and the cam out of their stall and I found out it was that little girls mother. So the mother starts looking for the little girl (that is in the stall with me) and all of a sudden the girls mom walks in the stall that I was in and just stands there and laughs a little and walks away. I was sooooooooo embarressed!!!!!|`|ckM1lYwoaa	Once it was christmas eve and my aunt handed me a present and told me something but it was too loud and I couldn't hear her so I just nodded my head figured she said something like here you go. I opened it and it was a gift card from her to a really nice restaurant. I told her thank you and when I opened it to see the amount it said to Mary and Tim, my cousins. I was so embarrassed! I hoped nobody saw me and put the present down ad went over to sit with my mom. I've hated christmas eve ever since.|`|ACA8i43Gaa	My fiance and I were going to college. He lived with five other guys, but at any given time there would be one or two random guys that would stay there for the week. In order to see each other I would have to come over in the early morning between our two jobs and classes. It was that, or we couldn’t see each other during the week. He started sleeping out on the couch because his roommate that shared a room with him started a graveyard shift and needed his sleep. <br>  <br>  One morning, before the sun came up, I had just let myself in to his apartment, and saw that his alarm clock was by the couch so that he wouldn’t sleep through class. He hadn’t been expecting me so I carefully walked through the pitch black apartment trying not to trip over anything. I wanted to surprise him with a wake up kiss, so I knelt down and started to kiss him. It was turning quite passionate when all of the sudden he went completely rigid. I sat up to see what was wrong and it wasn’t my fiance at all. It was some random guy who had just happened to stay overnight. I thought I was going to die! All I could pathetically say was, “Sorry, I thought you were my fiance.” His reply’ Well, after he stopped laughing and could finally take a breath said “It’s all good.”<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.yourembarrassingmoments.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.yourembarrassingmoments.com</a><br>  <a href="http://www.yourembarrassingmoments.com/story/it-wasnt-my-fiance-at-all.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.yourembarrassingmoments.com/s...</a>|`|hyRpVb7Daa	I was walking to my car in a parking lot with a friend.  I opened the door, stepped in, saw a strange man sitting in the driver's seat, then saw a baby in a carseat in the back.  I then realized I had climbed into the wrong car!  I apologized but the guy just started laughing. I was so humiliated

l9lrT7bfaa	I'd be thinking long and hard before I did this. Can you live with it if he kills himself as a result? Difficult situation but this is probably not the answer.<br>  <br>  I don't condone this behaviour at all but feel there might be a more constructive way of addressing it, I just don't know what that would be.|`|grifjdr0aa	OH HELL TO THE YES; NOT ONLY DO HIS FRIENDS NEED TO KNOW BUT ALL THE UNSUSPECTING LITTLE GIRLS NEED TO KNOW.  DO NOT HESITATE.|`|LpedVLedaa	Be careful, what he did is sick but he is still a minor and YOU could get in trouble.  Unfair, I know.<br>  <br>  <br>  He totally deserves it though if you can get away with it.|`|ecUnJOVYaa	do it do it do it !!!!|`|Qq2MKeXUaa	Just call the cops.  You may get in trouble putting that on your myspace account.|`|fC5X8swbaa	DO IT! DO IT!<br>  <br>  <br>  yeah, you should do it!|`|aMPKX7deaa	i would!! ... what a freak                    i would have someone beat his a**.. thats sick|`|Ma0H2Q8naa	Beat that ****** up. Sue his ***. Contact the authorities. (I know you said they didn't punish him...but surely there must be *someone* willing to do *something!!*) Exploit him so others are ware that he's a murderer (molestation and rape is like murder in my opinion...murder of your innocence...)|`|0O3JvmE7aa	Go ahead.the fact that you're committing a crime shouldn't be any hindrance.<br>  <br>  But when you're explaining to the nice FBI agent why you engaged  in harassment over the Internet,remember I told you so.|`|faizFiOFaa	don't. no need to stir up conflict when u don't need to. i understand this guy is a huge jerk but really don't make a lot of drama when u don't need to.|`|KWV6ZtBsaa	Hell yeah. Do IT DO IT DO IT<br>  <br>  you might regret it though...|`|cHv02GlYaa	definitely! do it. make him feel extremely stupid|`|zBRaqw21aa	Do it.|`|k0dZeYQ6aa	yes do that. his head should be cut off.|`|eHfEh85zaa	DO IT best answer... he is a sick beeeeeeeeeep|`|E80oq8bIaa	well please before you do it (wich yes the disgusting perv of a freak would deserve)<br>  <br>  but think about your little five year old niece she's starting school and all her teacher will know about it and theres more of a chance that later in life ppl will find out about it her friends maybe she doesnt want to go through that so thank about what this could do to your niece later in life then if you feel she wouldnt be humiliated later and she would be fine with it then you can do what ever you like but its always good to thank about helping the child thats always the most important thing not harming the criminal although he should be punished quite severly|`|MciMh30Jaa	Your so immature to do that seriously... your just putting your poor niece more on the spot  and embarrasing her more and as if his friends would believe him over you... people would just call you crazy ... why drag on the situation? If you want real punishment appeal the decision... fight against - your doing not good going on myspace and fighting with the keyboard...<br>  <br>  Besides you could get busted for defamation and that would get you in trouble not him... let karma deal with it. What he did was bad but don't crown yourself God.|`|F32uPjAraa	Do your worst, make the animals life miserable. Post his disgusting habits on the net. Make sure all his neighbors are aware of what he is capable of doing. Let his school, and his friends know what he has done. If he has part time work, let his employers know. And do this for years, and years to come. He deserves to go through sh!t for stealing the innocence of this poor little girl.|`|fb45aa39fc9300c79143be72cfb997b0aa	I'd say do it.  You may want to check first and make sure he pleaded guilty to a crime.  Otherwise, he can charge you with libel and sue you (funny isn't it?  The creep can sue you for telling the truth!)  Anyway, if he admitted it in court, I'd tell the world!|`|FgRUdQOBaa	Dont lower yourself to his level.<br>  <br>  What would you gain? he needs help, not humiliation. <br>  <br>  You stand a very good chance of making him bitter and angry and beyond any help ever. <br>  <br>  Vengence helps no one, ever.|`|vm5TgsQwaa	whoa<br>  He needs to die!|`|zI6cZoAWaa	yes he deserve to die|`|PytpVZx0aa	Well of course you should! He made a terribly perverted choice and all of his friends should know.<br>  <br>  what goes around, comes around. :]|`|uin3ffWDaa	dear god what a horrible situation.|`|eOsg3JiGaa	hell yes.|`|jKDZlgMiaa	if he admitted to it or was convicted of it then knock yourself out<br>  <br>  otherwise he or his parents could sue you for libel|`|AA11793059	TELL THEM!!|`|bf0ed9359eff6a68cd92a93c7dd88745aa	doooooooooooooooo it =D|`|Igyp0mB1aa	Yes, he needs something back in return.|`|bJKApBkyaa	he did it, he deserves it.|`|AA11551690	First of all, I can hardly believe he's getting away with a slap on the wrist.  Secondly, if this is true and it really happened then this kid, although guilty of wrong doing, is broken inside.  Kids don't just molest kids without something terribly wrong going on in their own lives.  It sounds to me that this 15-year-old needs helps as well.  Humiliating him or anything like that will just make a really bad situation even worse.|`|ll6e1VEzaa	humiliate him in every way you can!!!!! make posters and hang them up all over the school telling everyone what a sick bast*** he really is!!!<br>  <br>  i'm sorry but i feel really strong about this because I was molested 2 and he just walked away and now he's probably molesting more girls just because the cops didn't "feel up to it" as they said. it's so messed up!!!!!|`|car4UyLFaa	There's punishment, and there's vengeance. Ideally, punishment will serve to correct unacceptable behavior whereas vengeance is sort of balancing out a wrong, but will probably do nothing to change anyone's behavior.<br>  <br>  So the question is, how can the kid be shown his actions are wrong, and then be held responsible for them? Will humiliation do that?|`|UQdqzLgfaa	i would, not only to humiliate the little perv, but to warn others that he can be a danger if left alone with children.  I'm really sorry to hear about your step niece, and I know how it feels to be molested, and not have anything happen to the guy.  I hope everything turns out ok!|`|kAceP1pzaa	DO THAT CHIT!<br>  <br>  He took away her LIFE!!!!! OMG I am sorry for what your niece had to endure that. Yes, make it public. That's Justice, he didn't stop to think about how his actions might effect the child. <br>  <br>  There is a State, I forget which one that made convicted child pedophiles, to wear a black shirt with a big "Child Pedophile" sign on the front and back in public.<br>  <br>  Is the Child getting help, any form of counseling? Can I kick his ***?|`|A9AurTy3aa	Well I guess you could but people have reasons for doing things. I don't think he was just sitting around and like Hmm I think Im guna rape some one. There are mental patterns reasons that make molestation some thing people wish to act on. Im not 100% sure what Im saying but make sure you know its right when you make your decision look at the facts.|`|vD1w9wqVaa	DO IT!! Even though its not COMPLETELY right, you should do it. I mean you luv your step niece and he won't die if you humiliate him, but he will know who hes massing with! The power of the internet!!! ha ha! Beat that perverted child molester! Your a butt!|`|muOxoDGOaa	Don't tell anyone that. I think that he has been through enough. His family might reject him now because of what he did. He doesn't need more torment. However, if the authorities heard of it, would it not be publicized? His friends might already know. So, just don't do it.|`|e1jG5fhLaa	Tell all his friends quick!! But honestly think about it is he sorry or no, if hes really sorry about it i wouldnt do it everyone makes mistakes even tho that is COMPLETELY WRONG.<br>  "An eye for an eye makes the world go blind"<br>  <br>  Hehe i always wanted to say that|`|sHLbN2sdaa	I would warn him saying if he doesnt get his head together you will tell his friends. He will probably end up killing him self if you humiliate him in front of his friends (he will feel he already did something bad and now he only has his friends because noone else loves him i would JUST WARN HIM.|`|wnBkuzpzaa	tell <br>  he deserves it|`|vweOVGxDaa	Do It!!<br>  <br>  But the thing is.. i think u can take it up a notch.<br>  plant a video camera in a room.. then press record and tell him off infront of the 'hidden' camera and slap him and then put it on youtube.<br>  Then everyone will know what happened!<br>  EVERYONE!<br>  <br>  *mwahahha*|`|ZD4qrJ8qaa	I agree, outing the perv would help protect other kids.  However be careful what you put in writing.  You could be setting yourself up to be guilty of libel, which is a crime.|`|enPvwjtbaa	Beat him up, tell about him everywhere, tell everyone you know.<br>  And post up a video complaining about him on youtube :)|`|3BfNshHYaa	maybe not that extreme but he SHOULD be punished<br>  <br>  or maybe it SHOULD be that extreme now that i think about it... he should go to jail tho... wonder y he didnt...|`|bQ0PpuSyaa	do it he deserves much worse|`|qoiPaq1xaa	yes humiliate his preverted azz|`|wUmrHwofaa	I agree, he deserves to be punished but will everyone know that what he did was to your step niece?

They subject themselves to a lifetime of abuse.<br>  She may be one of those poor fools...|`|oTWpoIJdaa	Remember Rihanna is the victim and not the victimizer.  She needs mental help, and emotional support as her wounds heal.  Chris did not one day decide to become a woman beater - this was something in the making long before the incident.  Most bullies and abusers usually have a early history where they have either witnessed profound abuse or was a target themselves.  Instead of recognizing, accepting and transforming themselves from victim to empowered persons from their abusers, they chose to ignore it, hide it, etc. while their mental health suffers, they then begin to act out the twisted role of their abuser(s).  <br>  <br>  Should she go back?  Nope.  Can it get any worst?  Very likely.  <br>  They both need help, but Rihanna needs our sympathy more and Chris needs anger/rage psychoanalysis and family counseling.|`|57845b8374924287d473183b90b2a4eaaa	There are a lot of cases similar to this. some women are too scared to report domestic violence and they go back to their abusive relationship. but being celebrities makes this case more "special." rihanna is just a coward by going back with a loser.|`|4d9935586be55aa85a6c466ef935061faa	to me this is what i think it's just my opinion so don't get mad i think that chris brown was not just the only one that did something i think that she had something Else to do with it because how allot of there family and friends are saying that she has been hitting on him 4 months.i think that rihanna has not told the hold truth about what happen that night. i think that rihanna if he has hit her in the past like she said he has why didn't she leave the first time.and about her father i think that he is right you have 2 let your children grow up and make there own choices. and he trust her to make the best decision 4 her  and her career i think that all of this wouldn't have happen if it wasn't 4 there publicist.|`|TDGhHIvNaa	Women on a whole are pretty stupid when it comes to love, and men.  While we can come up with all sorts of advice for our friends and everyone else in the world regarding their love lives, when it comes to our own, we tend to get a little territorial and don't follow good sound advice, no matter who is giving it or if it is the blatant truth.   Women who have been involved in domestic abuse situations--whether it is reported or not usually do go back to their partner, believing that it will never happen again.  This is especially so if there happens to be a somewhat humble apology and a promise that it won't happen again. Nothing anyone says or does is going to make her turn on her man, and she will go to any lengths to defend him...it sounds ridiculous and stupid, but it happens every single day.  Of course those apologies and promises never really stick and on and on it goes.  Many women who come from abusive relationships have been beaten down and berated so much they truly believe that they deserved to get hit.  Often there are other issues like control and dominance involved and very likely there has been a wedge placed between the woman and any available outside help.  It is easy to sit back and  judge what we see on the surface, but you never really know what is going on inside someone.

I am stubborn and too perserving to be weak.<br>  <br>  I am straight forward about how I feel.<br>  I am confrontational about what I think.<br>  I think a lot of Scorpio's keep a lot of things inside and it's just not healthy. They become sensitive and weak that way. How are you ever going to grow or reach your potential? That's how you learn and make mistakes! If you sit around you wont get anywhere. you cant sit around in fear. that's my theory. and it'll only get refined and better w time, the more i throw myself out there. you have to get used to feeling insecure and facing your fear that you are insecure about, get past it, until insecurity doesnt exist.<br>  <br>  im almost addicted to finding my insecurities, so that i can face them. it's a challenge. it crazy, but thrilling, truamatizing, awesome, looking back or reading in my diary how hopeless i felt, and i just think to myself that was awesome, now that i look back at it. now i voice my insecurities left and right! it's not a big deal.<br>  <br>  I say and do what I feel and I know that not all ppl like it. But trust me it's better to be honest w your feelings (being true to yourself). I stick to my guns and it's just better all around and easier to live this way.|`|hN3k3ggSaa	At one stage anyone that was anyone in my life was a Scorpio. I think your deduction is fairly correct, and steel willed as another person said id 100% correct. One thing is for sure...they are amazing in bed and I can only hope to repeat the experience...they are however very exhausting emotionally long term as they demand outmost allegiance and confidentiality, and even though I have a Scorpio moon, I tend to want to "disclose" to all different types of people in order to form a varied opinion. I think Scorpios can be your greatest friend or foe depending on how you treat them. I do like Scorpio, but need "lighter" personalities in a long term relationship. They are also very prone to addictions.|`|QfPJ4dotaa	Yes, that's why they are awesome. They can intimidate anyone that makes life uncomfortable for you, and then drive you to Taco Bell for some food. =]|`|DsnMKfLsaa	i have four scropions in my chart and i guess i do too<br>  And since its in my moon sign i guess I really do|`|0YYTLqwYaa	I'm a Scorpio, and I think what you're talking about is more pride than being weak inside. At any rate, people aren't accurately defined by horoscopes. At least not most of the time. I am really prideful though. Maybe I just contradicted myself.|`|lAvWp7f9aa	i dont believe that cuz ima scorpio and i am so not like that im kinda more like the opposite|`|mD7eAAoNaa	Yea they totally do. They act like nothing gets to them, but inside it really does. They don't let others know of their weaknesses. The one thing that they can't contain is jealousy.

pNUtnoC8aa	I don't like it. It always seems to me like a daunting task and a huge responsibility.

I've noticed that most girls put a lot of importance on commitment, and as soon as you kind of ask them for a bit of space, they freak out. Well, from my personal experience anyways.|`|thcr8Y5vaa	Yes I do...
e22d86889cb88baa6ecf401b1f6a584caa	I'm the same.|`|9BbV2xqIaa	I'm definitely more feral than domestic. I'm far too eccentric to be domesticated properly.

But it doesn't work anymore. =(|`|9087c63bf667d25bf1ebbecfe37cae22aa	Sure, there are music sharing programs (limewire, frostwire, etc) and there are other ways of getting it. Converting the video file, for example with a free online media converter if it can be found on youtube.. It will make the video into an MP3 format so you can tune to the song on your ipod and stuff.|`|S0XtBhUSaa	ya u could go from limewire to itunes just download to lime and open up itunes right next to it and drag it to itunes|`|jaOEtAHKaa	www.deezer.com|`|FhAhtjkOaa	ya

AA10053661	JTB toast isn't worth much unless it is dunked head first in your orange juice. In the future I suggest you put cheese on your toast then dunk it. You'll have  much more success of getting your image of Jesus that way. Remember..... Cheeses wept.|`|d09f9f421df80c0b6d67a419cfaa9464aa	Disappointed? Not at all. I would put the toast on ebay and find out what it was worth.<br>  Rose P.|`|rPywKtJRaa	I think the same as mickey mouse pancakes.....sucks huh.....|`|9IvcV7tiaa	it wouldn't bother me much, i'd just cover it with strawberry jam.|`|9NKoHyy8aa	I wouldn't be disappointed at all, because I'm not imaginative enough to see images  on my toast. In fact, I never even look for them. And it wouldn't even be worth the bread it's toasted on. But, if you'd like, I could burn a piece of toast, and scrape out a real nice picture of The Virgin Mary for you. Now, that might actually be worth something.|`|54601f6ca2b038fe7a92154c08ebd2c9aa	After "Cheeses wept" I got nothing. MNG you rock :)<br>  <br>  Beside I am never disappointed with toast. <br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LoFhNepDTuE" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LoFhNepDT...</a>|`|MJH4fpidaa	I wouldn't believe it.<br>  Holy ShitStain Jesus<br>  <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXe82pzw-ew" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXe82pzw-...</a>|`|DA5ZbYjlaa	I'd be somewhat disappointed, but I would add it to my collection anyway.|`|oQ2Rn2hpaa	Not sure about toast, Revy, but I understand boiled eggs bearing a resemblance to J The B go for quite a tidy sum - providing the head's not been lopped off already.|`|DzIlM76Xaa	I thought I had a tortilla with Judas Priest. But it turned out to be Iron Maiden. Weak!|`|IgIlAiO5aa	i would eat it regardless of who is burned into it...I think that person just needed a new toaster|`|HCL7FpTqaa	grrr......<br>  <br>  <br>  All I ever get is the image of Hello Kitty!!|`|dyiYdgigaa	With a little marmalade, you can usually get it to look like Jesus.  Well, my last one looked more like Rasputin, but I still got $.45 for it....|`|fO5wQiYzaa	Put some strawberry jam on them and they'll taste just as good. Wash it down with orange juice.|`|9S6x6xZ9aa	<sigh> You get JTB toast and all I get is Gilbert Godfried shaped tortillas|`|avhgLEu8aa	I'd just put some cheese on it and eat it anyway.|`|D4XWrwuaaa	It's worth about 99 cents to me, which is what they charge for an order of toast at my local breakfast joint.
thcr8Y5vaa	Yes...|`|ftixHrOnaa	Yes.<br>  <br>  I wanna track down all those bastards and stick my foot up their *** for two hours see how that feels.|`|FD0cZu9Uaa	Yes! Maybe they didn't physically "kill" their victim but emotionally they definitely killed a huge portion of them!|`|1HnJXVSHaa	Yeahh, go on, give it to them dumb $hits!!!!!! <br>  <br>  they have no respect for people, life should not give them respect, either.|`|405b47863f96696ecc3415e084e85ab8aa	Yes. It's torture what the victim's are going through.|`|3WCXGRaGaa	yess<br>  I think they should and same with peds that rape little kids|`|fqxZMS3Jaa	i think that if they raped someone that they should be raped over and over in prison, that is what they deserve, and they will get whats coming to them.  i think that they would eventually kill them selves being raped over and over, that is their own death penalty.|`|oauYuhvDaa	Yes and no.<br>  <br>  Yes because they are emotionally murdering their victims.<br>  But no, because if there were a death sentence associated with rape, I'd worry that the rapists would start killing the victims.  They might not think if the victim is dead she can't identify him.<br>  Maybe I'm wrong, but it's a thought.|`|pR4Hwmpbaa	As long as the accused is definitely 100% guilty of multiple rapes and there is zero chance that person is innocent at all AND also the fact that this person would rape again if given the chance then I would be okay with them being given the death penalty...|`|UgyhXiEQaa	They say an eye for an eye, so send his *** to prison for life to get his punishment. He'll likely find out what its liked to be raped.<br>  <br>  on a serious note, its better to let them rot in prison than escape suffering by instant death.|`|PtHkKEjTaa	they shouldn't get the death penalty but they should get life because if they do get death they die in humane way they don’t feel pain like their victims. When they get life they become someone ***** and get beaten and they always have to be on alert|`|e4e6e071fbaff222f423d536811dc00eaa	I dont think anyone should get the death penalty but i do think they should get life in prison without parole|`|z9c69TVqaa	YeAh CaUse MoSt of Them eNd Up gEttINg Out TheN DO tHe saMe thiNG bUt tWicE As wORST|`|3eP6pzM7aa	No doubt of course|`|I5Xmn6xIaa	I think they should get repeatedly raped by the oppostie sex of their choice.

(:|`|6WQo6RpSaa	I don't usually dip my cookies because the teachers at my elementary school put so much emphasis on NOT dipping your cookies in your milk because they said it was bad manners, or something....so I figured out a sneaky way to get my cookies and my milk to mix together by biting off a piece of cookie and *then* taking a sip of milk :D|`|MWV5yxY4aa	eeewww. no.|`|Jg7CGHZRaa	yup, until they get vaguely soggy but still are sorta crunchy too|`|5cAIAKF7aa	yeah. you mean, people eat oreos without milk dunkin first? i thought that was only a myth|`|4005d331a08d39ea67192eee64272340aa	it gives it more taste|`|LuWT8KQBaa	Is there any other way to eat oreos?|`|YP2xuZdtaa	yes|`|a9LgRjb3aa	yeah u have to isnt that like an oreo rule?|`|kTeYca4saa	Yep all the time!|`|b6dnIGoYaa	doesnt everyone? i love it!!|`|NjyjMvjqaa	yup,I do

It was the required suit of swimmers before they used the bodysuits.   And what is worse:  at the more important swim meets we had to wear speedos that were 1 size too small and made of paper.   They are not that uncomfortable,  but they do take some getting used to, and they get very uncomfortable if you have to wear them under clothes like underwear.  I would not get caught dead in them now, 11 years and 60 lbs. later unless my gf wanted me in them.   But she would have to be extremely persuasive.  I would not want  to make her sick because of my sagging belly.|`|wvOs18f6aa	I actually quit my high school swim team because they wanted me  to wear a speedo.

xv3HN8xRaa	In my experience if you have a serious face the joke has more impact. Look as if you don't understand why it's funny, not confused, just unaffected.|`|D0ejGHKBaa	It would depend on the joke.<br>  <br>  A joke with talking animals or animals that walk into a bar for example.... are funnier when you're smiling.<br>  <br>  Deadpan jokes, like Rodney Dangerfield ones, are better straight faces.|`|pPKZiFWSaa	Why does it matter? o_o<br>  I think it's funnier when you deliver a joke with a blank face though.<br>  <br>  If you have a silly smile on your face... no. its not cool to have silly smiles :I|`|00dde3824bb31a5760d4b4cdc75e4641aa	depends. If it's really dark humor a blank expression is funnier.|`|XEGG1l6Raa	their avatar might influence the ''lol''<br>  <br>  but not all the time.|`|AA12057390	Depends on the joke, eh? <br>  Sometimes telling a joke with a smile but delivering the punch line with a blank expression makes it more funnierer.<br>  <br>  .|`|Z55OptjDaa	It's better when they have the smile carved into their face|`|fv2GAAdPaa	i like it when there face is blank, it makes me laugh even louder lol<br>  <br>  =]|`|5cAIAKF7aa	blank face

Then give us the link so we can laugh at all the sarcastic answers.|`|peUHFSZuaa	Go on, and give a false phone number, like your friend's phone number. Then people would be calling them day in and day out... lol|`|fdbERqCUaa	I dare you to take this fake beard and this diaper.

BkRhubkqaa	Hmm, it sounds like you may have watched an episode of House, yes? :)<br>  <br>  I don't think it matters as much about the world, as long as there was...divine recognition...all will be well :)|`|mwW4zIwIaa	No. It's sad, but there's no impact on the world.<br>  Depends on who it is, though. Might have a little if they're famous world wide.<br>  <br>  I mean, even if someone dies, it's not like the world changes. Someone's always there to fill in the blank.<br>  <br>  Just has huge impact on people who loves them.|`|wbVd38d2aa	Not on the world. Nobody is THAT important in the great scheme of things. People die every day, good and bad - that's the cycle of life. <br>  It's only when it's somebody famous that the world even hears about one particular death. Otherwise it only impacts on the families.|`|k3iwAO1caa	It depends on there accomplishment if they made did great in the world they will have a impact on many if they did little a few.|`|fGQ7gvtjaa	Of course, good people are what shape our world and help to maintain peace. If it weren't for the good people then we would all be swarmed with the evil people in life! Hope I Helped! Have a good one!!|`|Uv6fADcaaa	No, "good" people die every hour...<br>  <br>  if there was an impact on the world every single time... it wouldn't be good.|`|dHREHByPaa	It should, but the bad ones always make a bigger one. Sad, isn't it?|`|LXGLqT9Uaa	Yes, God knows we need more positive in our lives.|`|nn9bpWBZaa	No pol are not good.|`|9cPNA4nKaa	no, too many good people die|`|iBxb6lJlaa	this planet is to small with a over population of humans. One human shouldn't make a difference at all unless they are major people. President, etc.|`|oWLO6SiKaa	to the world they may just be one person..but to one person they may be the world :(|`|aVZgY4S8aa	Yes. I think of all the truly awesome people I've known that have died tragically at a young age and knowing the good they did for others, and what a sad world it really is without them in it.|`|oOVAbKPmaa	Look at it this way, and in so doing, ask yourself the following question: " Who, a hundred and fifty years from now, will it matter to that I ever lived?" It's chilling to think that if one takes a stroll through an old cemetery and stumbles upon a crumbling tombstone marked, " DIED : MARCH 7, 1859 ", that visitor will likely find nothing more than a stone in disrepair with no sign of any flowers around, and possibly not even so much as the grass having been mowed. That, my friend, should put things in perspective for all of us...|`|UoDtGtiLaa	there should, this world needs more good people and if we lose one, we should acknowledge and mourn it|`|eZCCSMykaa	who cares more air|`|nUUX3VMIaa	I believe we are all connected and if someone is hurting than others are hurting, and it impacts the people and the people they know and they people they know and so on and so forth. Eventually it has affected everyone in some way which leads all around the world. <br>  <br>  When anyone dies, there IS an impact on the world.|`|OssbqbrPaa	Not really, Only those whom he/she impacted in life.<br>  Enjoy life tooooo the fullest<br>  <br>  (\/)<br>  ( . .)<br>  c('')('') ? ? ????? ??l?*?? ??????.??? ? ????? ??l?* ??????.??? ? ????? ??l?

dhXCEumpaa	Common courtesy, manners, flirting, likeness towards another, showing off, and personal goals are just a few reasons that I can think of.|`|jHWEEZmCaa	it makes it easier to stab them in the back|`|vWuocjE3aa	Hopefully to have the niceness returned......The Golden Rule, Treat others the way you would like to be treated.|`|hfGE5jieaa	Ha.<br>  Um.<br>  No.<br>  I don't seem to know.<br>  <br>  (:|`|TPcV5wvyaa	havent you heard of the golden rule?
8yE2sYGeaa	Perhaps it was/is unfilmable|`|1H7MoHLtaa	Please read the novel, then go see it again. You'll change your mind.|`|AA12228038	I completely expected to see a lot of complaints from people who haven't read the graphic novel.  A lot of stuff got lost between the book and the film, stuff that someone who has read it would be able to fill in.<br>  <br>  There are about 40 pages of prose in the novel that were completely left out of the movie that helped a lot with the back story.  Also the previews were a bit misleading.  Fans would have known ahead of time that this is NOT an action story.|`|CQak2VpZaa	they kept scene shots insanely accurate to the novel ... dr.manhattan was naked most the time, so they incorporated it in the movie.<br>  <br>  some more action would have been niice ... but the gorryness was sufficiently disturbing enough|`|GVUkCcwxaa	I was going to see this last night but didn't end up going. I heard it is like sin city but better? Is it worth seeing?|`|XGCHYkwFaa	i haven't seen it and probably will not

It's free expression. Butttt on the other hand it's gonna be dumb when a parent is all "hmmm.. i wonder why my eight year old just peirced her ears."|`|57845b8374924287d473183b90b2a4eaaa	I don't plan on buying a barbie doll for the rest of my life.|`|216n2jznaa	i remeber those lol|`|a1Ngi39Xaa	No, I have not!

Temporary tattoos are the least of our problems with kids.<br>  <br>  The real problem arises with dolls who wear almost no clothes and have little bling bling, like those slutty Bratz dolls.|`|YhuH2k4Caa	i actually think people have the right to be angry with this. barbie is like...america's favorite doll. if mattel stays with this project, barbie will be worse than those damned bratz dolls that basically teach your kid its alright to dress like a streetwalker.|`|r8s5j6zOaa	No and those do gooders can deal with it|`|DT80y28Maa	some people are just old fashioned

But i got a good looking and intelligent guy.<br>  <br>  Um choice B under MEN,|`|FD0cZu9Uaa	i guess I will say A<br>  Good looks and a hot body only goes so far. If I can't have an intelligent or fun conversation with the guy then I am out of there with in a really short time.|`|3N3IXFfhaa	im a woman and my answer would be B. but i really like an equal amount of brains and beauty.|`|vxQEqHvzaa	Intelligence... but good looks are a plus.<br>  <br>  I go for good minds more than I do good looks.|`|e2JxDMAZaa	B|`|uwtvDgxCaa	A BIG WEENIE!!!!......(=|`|LuWT8KQBaa	Tough one. I've met a few women with community college AA's and highschool degrees who are remarkably quick witted. Then again there is that nerdy, book wormish drive to learn and succeed in graduate students. I think the tiebreaker here is the fitness of the second girl. You could take her rock climbing or running or other physical activities and have a good time.|`|yXB5LOE2aa	A mixture, but intelligence and personality get me hooked more.|`|Dt1YM4PIaa	B i think... only if we can have an intellegant conversation but im usually atracked to smart guys|`|lOR7CH0waa	A.

pR4Hwmpbaa	As long as she is a good woman and she lets me eat what I want without condemning me for it then I am cool with her own personal choice about what she wants to eat...|`|grifjdr0aa	do you like the bone?  I'm sure that's all that matters!|`|Qq2MKeXUaa	no not really.  My wife is a vegetarian.  It's all about give in take|`|MwiBGBK1aa	I am a vegetarian.. I never really had a problem, except some guys always teasing me about eating meat. <br>  I understand the circle of life, and I am not against people eating meat. I just personally don't like it and think many methods of animal killing are cruel and disgusting.|`|lB7PX2Voaa	Not at all. It's interesting. Maybe even give it a chance.|`|hLSIRDtZaa	Nope. I don't eat meat all the time either so....LOL|`|pNUtnoC8aa	No it would not.|`|4d3Md9pnaa	If he dumps you because you're a vegetarian, he's a jackass. Don't waste your time.<br>  <br>  If he dumps you because you push you're vegetarian diet onto him...well, that would make sense, but I doubt you're doing that.<br>  <br>  I don't see how you'd keep it a secret anyway. He's going to notice you don't eat meat sooner or later.|`|GyrG1roTaa	no you should tell him right away and i dont think it should be a problem so long as you dont try to convert him to become a vegetarian.  if you respect him, then he should respect you too|`|BILIAKSOaa	No, just come straight out with it. I'm sure he wouldn't care. If he truly liked you he wont' care and will stick with you. If he loved you then he would stop eating meats and become a vegetarian. (:|`|TCehI17kaa	No it wouldn't bother me at all & if the guy likes you he would respect you & your feelings when it comes to what you do.|`|V8sDPf2Eaa	no way!!<br>  why would it bother me to date a girl that cares about her health.|`|bwKZ8MWWaa	As long as you are a Big Meat eater, he will like you|`|c68b31739ffbee17f6dfc635bbe9ffddaa	Why? That's you.|`|G5IaqX48aa	no !|`|692c8795f68a0ba95a0d09139d70c98caa	If a guy wouldnt date a girl because of what she choses to eat, he is a really big loser anyways lol and you shouldnt be dating him!  That is a part of who you are, and really not something you can hide anyways.   The only thing he may be afraid of is you trying to convert him or talk badly about his liking of meat.   <br>  <br>  But anyhow, tell him next time you talk to him, i really really doubt he will care.|`|M8kNmWuAaa	Wouldnt bother me. I could eat a vegetarian meal every once in a while on a date.|`|940aeb175b0facf00b53d83108c83e62aa	Guys never mind, if their Gf is a vegetarian or not... but if a guy want to marriage with vegetarian girl, he would ask only.. will you make a meat dishes for me after marriage?? ;)|`|qwInrvUGaa	it will prolly be fine as long as your not the pushy kind of vegetarian who is always trying to get people to become vegetarians by calling the people who eat murderers and monsters|`|2FsNdcXEaa	No, that would be stupid. Don't you want him to know YOU?|`|YDXITLv1aa	it wouldnt bother me... unless she tried to turn me into a vegetarian..|`|rXbtkSBWaa	Vegies are hot,<br>  <br>  if he really likes you it shouldn't matter,<br>  go a head, tell him, find out if hes a fake,|`|ZbZnIcoIaa	No...thats ridiculous.|`|5bdcd6fdade97ea18590869df8c0bcc0aa	Yeah what they said.<br>  I'm a vegetarian too :)|`|cxVmq2kraa	If he can't accept something as small as that...<br>  <br>  then you've got bigger issues.|`|1CbL0kFuaa	nah come straight out with it|`|7916aa06aa7095ef0a8db07a09419b0daa	If you were my girl all I would care about is your happiness.

I'm a guy who is a vegetarian and I have to deal with it, but most people will just accept you for who you are.  If that is a relationship breaker for him, you don't want to be with him in the first place........|`|uGz7V9Zxaa	why would that be a problem?<br>  <br>  and no thats stupid. if you're dating, communication is important. keeping secrets, regardless of what they are, will only ruin the beauty of love and trust, and will eventually make youre relationship a living hell|`|1lFOPzvNaa	well this depends on so much..<br>  u already know that if he like doesant like u for who u are then u shouldnt be with him..<br>  the best thing would be is to tell him...<br>  but it IS easier said then done<br>  if u feel u shouldnt for a while then dont<br>  if its eating at u to tell him then u should|`|dso5JZtBaa	sorta. i just cant go without a steak every once in a while. in my opinion people are not rabbits, we have carnivore teeth for a reason. though being a veritarian is your choice. if he cant deal with what u want to eat then he isnt for u.|`|hqPsnVn1aa	Not at all! If he actually likes you, he wouldn't care about your diet. Unless you have a diet thats harmful to you (like anorexia or something, lol)|`|Dob2OhIYaa	dont keep it a secret because if he doesnt know he might take you to a big meat resturant and then it would be akward because you dont eat meant and you didnt tell him so just tell him!|`|cRmmNGr5aa	i dont think it would make a difference in a relationship.<br>  im a vegetarian too, so i hope not :)|`|DAOqVfM5aa	No. I would be fine with it, as long as she doesn't give me a hard time about the fact that I'm not a vegetarian.|`|rNE7XAmgaa	Right on, I'm vegetarian too. Don't be scared, this is  a big part of your life and you should let him know.|`|bJqS9GYOaa	Don't keep those kind of secrets.  They can destroy your life.  Just be yourself.   I would recommend letting him know.    It will save you a lot of trouble.|`|ET3fB5G8aa	wow, love b/w a carnivore and a herbivore, never heard of that before !|`|SQQFnb3Qaa	no -- please tell him soon. He really should not care. He may jokingly give you a hard time.|`|fFdOmuibaa	Tell him right away. Nothing to worry about.|`|mZsgSazAaa	only if they got mad at me and tried to change my eating habits<br>  <br>  otherwise i'm perfectly fine with it|`|qof2d5ujaa	no ofcourse u shoudln't keep it a secret!<br>  <br>  if he can't accept the fact that u don't eat dead animals, then dump him|`|iSoXvwAIaa	no<br>  <br>  just dont go nuts when I want to eat lots of meat!|`|qF0IUW8Saa	yea kinda, it would be too high maintenece in a way|`|uIZDd3y5aa	just tell him, if he really likes you, he won't mind one bit|`|zTe7DMFAaa	nope|`|tQh1w0COaa	he won't as long as u don't care|`|Gzhdixecaa	no i wouldn't care. i date any girl regardless of what she eats.|`|wc9BXQdRaa	dot say a thing. i was a one for a long time!  lol|`|9lb1f7leaa	NO!

rB3ypCO4aa	It's all good. In my experience,it's mostly the shady,the deceptive and the evil plotters who try to always look dignified ALL the time. I know that's not you,so don't follow that pattern of behavior.Sing in the shower badly,burp if you drank your soda too fast,go to the corner store in a wrinkled t,boxers and flips with no makeup on,scream a cuss to somebody on your cell in public! These are the things that make us all more approachable and human. Your neighbors will think more highly of you if you see them the next day and say "NOW you know why I don't quit my day job" than if you dodge them like you owe them money! Like I said,just adapt the attitude that it's all good.|`|I1K6SC43aa	Your avatar freaks the hell out of me everytime I see it.|`|Ld9kVVqDaa	Act like you don't think they heard you?<br>  I don't know that song, or how well you sang it, so I really don't know for sure why you need courage to face them, or what you should do.

ClRuPRs7aa	I am pretty sure you need a passport to get into Canada. I'm Canadian and we need a passport to get into the US. There was an exception if your traveling by land the past year, but it's supposed to change at the beginning of this year for everyone to require a passport when travelling to Canada or US. Why don't you look it up? or ask the people at the border or people working at the airport? Good luck! I hope I helped :)|`|u86NV1Enaa	No, you cannot.<br>  Every time a person is traveling "overseas", meaning "outside of their own country", they need a Passport.<br>  Passport are important because they have all personal information, and a special place where the visiting country seals when arriving and when exiting that country.<br>  No one would let you get into another country without a Valid and Non-Expired Passport from the country you're from. No-Other-I.D. with or without pictures will be permit it.<br>  <br>  This explains to you How To Get A Passport:<br>  <a href="http://www.usps.com/passport/" rel="nofollow">http://www.usps.com/passport/</a>

mx32BnQAaa	not   at all~
TfLZjPm2aa	No, she did not write the song herself. Neither did her dad. You see, With pop music, none of them write their own songs, they just sing them. Some big-shot song writer writes all of them, and sells the rights to them to people like miley cyrus for them to sing and make money off of. So Miley Cyrus is not a good musical artist, she is just a good entertainer.|`|c8tyG5z3aa	No. They have writers for the movie write all the Hannah songs (and Miley ones since she's singing them as Miley in the movie. So any show-related songs, she does not write, just sings & performs)<br>  <br>  Miley's dad doesn't write her songs for her anyway, only his character on Hannah Montana writes Hannah Montana's songs on the show. In real life he takes no part in writing songs for the show Hannah Montana or for his daughter in real life.<br>  <br>  Some artists, like Miley, write lyrics and work with a producer to change them around and listen to different tracks to come up with a good song they all like. So some artists do do the lyric writing, some just produce the music and have someone else write they lyrics, some do neither, and some do both.<br>  <br>  But to answer your question No, Miley nor her dad wrote the hoedown song. :)

UnsZKr4saa	Straight-edge people make a LIFETIME (this is key) commitment to abstain from drugs, alcohol, and drugs.  It's different from saying "I'm only going to drink responsibly", but rather "I'm not going to sip a drop of alcohol for my entire life".  Some SxEs get pretty uptight as well.  Many times, they draw a "X" on their hands to represent themselves.  Often, but not always, these are the people who think they're superior to others who do drink or smoke.<br>  <br>  Not necessarily.  If you simply don't drink or smoke, it does not mean you are Straight-edge.  SxEs, as stated above, make commitments to never use these substances.  If you don't smoke or drink because you happen to be underaged, or you just aren't into it, you're not a straight-edger.  If you feel that it's 'wrong', morally or otherwise, then you may be one.|`|ebxwADDcaa	no drinking, no drugs, no sex. basically you are a 15 year old virgin. <br>  straight edge is just that. a lot of hardcore fans might be straight edge but you dont have to be. its not a club or anything.|`|oXKLf3hMaa	it doesn't really have to do with music. just the no drugs/smoking/alcohol/casual sex. so yeah, you're straight edge. welcome to the club! haha.|`|cxVmq2kraa	No drinking or drugs.<br>  Sex depends on the person.<br>  <br>  I would not suggest your stereo type yourself as "straight edge" in case you want to change your habits later.|`|UD93qolxaa	It's nothing about music.|`|J1J47FIAaa	Drug/Alcohol free.<br>  No sex.|`|ZX6rISTXaa	basically that u dont drink or smoke anything illegal <br>  i think...|`|eEoeURDHaa	My cousin goes to school with a bunch of them, I think they all look like "less wimpy" emo kids.

If there are any effects, they probably aren't noticable, and will only cause problems way way down the road.<br>  <br>  In other words, don't worry, but if you want 100% assurance put the iPod somewhere else.|`|dwhClJ1Haa	nope.

oNgY7OAzaa	They're like vigilantes. They believe in their own justice by breaking the law. They are doing what they themselves feel is right.  But, on the other hand, Dr. Manhattan is self-centered and harsh thinking. He doesn't actually fight for others. Silk Spectre and the Nite Owl are cheaters. Rorschach (my fav) is considered crazy by many, and he is somewhat motivated by revenge for his fallen comrades.<br>  <br>  Well, it's all really an opinion in the end.|`|QJIXTpZ5aa	I would say they're more neutral then anything else.|`|ihtUSk4Yaa	they are an evil good, because they dont give a damn , unless ur a costume hero|`|YzhYFu0eaa	That's a distinction you have to draw for yourself.

a1Ngi39Xaa	I am going with James Hetfield on this one, musically.  I will admit part of that is due to his longevity but also his creativity.  Kurt Cobain was talented as a songwriter but since his time was cut so short, it's hard to tell how he would have evolved.|`|pNUtnoC8aa	James because he was a huge influence on Thrash Metal, a great cover guitarist and could play lead, he could play drums, a great vocalist and phenomenal songwriter (Master of Puppets album is a great example)<br>  <br>  Kurt-Was  better at pretty much nothing in this comparison and James would trash him.|`|2k8TEiRtaa	Nobody has beat John Lennon and Paul McCartney on songwriting and their music.

Everything.|`|HqNiRRHlaa	they were both great musicians in their day - Kurt really started something but Hetfield has the advantage of still being alive<br>  <br>  Nirvana wouldn't of lasted like metallica have but you can see the similarites in song writting|`|1634875a2112f90de61c5b890983ed03aa	Kurt Cobain - he's the true godfather of grudge and literally started a new wave of music - called alternative.  Now that's some serious talent.|`|6C24kJhaaa	cobain. but james is awsome too.|`|BxTAfd2baa	James Hetfield.  He was drugged up to the wazoo and still making masterpieces.  And, unlike Kurt Cobain, James could change notes while singing quickly.  He also has a wonderful slow-song voice (listen to "Nothing Else Matters" on the Black Album).  However, I totally think that Kurt's girlfriend killed him for his money.  He had it made.  Why would he kill himself.  His loss was a great to the rock community.|`|uGz7V9Zxaa	you cant vaguely and generally compare the talents of two people.<br>  <br>  you have to ask who succeeded more in what area. everyone is equally talented but in different ways.<br>  <br>  to me, kurt cobain was one of those songwriters that you just think to yourself "wow he knows what im feeling"<br>  <br>  in the other hand, james hetfield's personality and ways of fronting metallica helped shape the metal we know today|`|g5pLCOm3aa	Hetfield -  more talented guitarist<br>  Cobain  -  more talented singer/songwriter<br>  <br>  Hetfield may be more "talented" but Cobain is more iconic|`|N64LKqWkaa	kurt colbain if it wasn't for drugs, and im a metallica fan =o|`|wX46Gv4naa	Kurt Cobain's lyrics are fabulous|`|sM2aNguhaa	techwise - metallica<br>  <br>  poetry wise - cobain|`|y2t3F690aa	AHHHH why yu gotta make me choose yur like twisting my arm!<br>  <br>  <br>  More meaning- Kurt<br>  <br>  more....Kick ***-ness~ James<br>  <br>  imma have to go with Kurt cuz im more of a Nirvana fan! but Metallica is the sh!t !|`|AA11489373	Kurt Cobain, who purty much started grunge...lol go out and get your flannel shirts and ripped jeans kids.

ee1b84441775c37227d31b7c50729a69aa	Great marketing and it was one of the first 2009 movies to be shown in the trailers. I haven't seen any previews for The International on my T.V. (granted I do not watch much to begin with, but at the same time, I have seen plenty of Taken previews). Ticket sales go up during economic downturns as well.

Liam Neeson was good and it helped that he was ridiculously violent, but the plot holes and continuity errors were everywhere.<br>  The story was old and tired also: washed up spy impresses his ex-wife and her more successful partner by rescuing their daughter. The stereotyping of Eastern Europeans as drug-pushing, daughter-abducting villains was ridiculous.<br>  Perhaps it may be that some Americans seem to an fear of all things foreign. The same ground was covered in Hostel now that I think about it, evil Slovakians (or whoever) abduct unsuspecting Americans for their evil purposes.|`|WS1rqp0Gaa	Agreed with Wayward Son

I would take a pretend sip, then put it aside. If they ask why you aren't drinking or if you don't like it, compliment the drink but say you really shouldn't have any more. Then change the subject.|`|r9lfDeRmaa	I would politely decline, say something about just getting over a cold and really are taking every precaution not to get sick again so if they could just give you a clean glass and no ice.

If not, I make an excuse that I'm not really thirty after all.|`|9z1VfzNWaa	I would just leave the cup full or pore a bit down the sink to make it look like i was drinking it but then forgot about it.|`|FD0cZu9Uaa	Drink it!

6WQo6RpSaa	Scott, my driver's ed teacher. My drivers ed took place in a small town and lasted only 11 days.....and it was brutal. We got sent home with over 50 pages to read in the book every night, and we got, like, 5 pages (front and back) of quizzes to take over what we read. Plus, we had to watch and take notes on at least 3 videos each day. And we had to find 10 newspaper articles about people who'd gotten in a car crash, and write a few sentences about what they did wrong. And we all had to have a considerable amount of personal driving time with Scott, and most of my driving days happened when it was pouring rain out...so if I wasn't panicked enough driving through the confusing city streets, I also had to deal with the blinding effects of the rain and the wiper blades going back and forth.<br>  <br>  But Scott was a good teacher.

VvCs9Ijmaa	Libra is the most attractive sign. Romantic, flirts, always ready to make friends. They argue a lot, are moody but are sensitive also. Like all beautiful things and fond of music. Libra women indulge more in fashion. Have sweet smiles.|`|hN3k3ggSaa	My daughter is a Libra, and an ex supervisor with whom I still have a great friendship are also (both birthdates 27/9). Both have a very and almost surprising deep side to them. Both can be superficial and cold.detatched if they choose to be. Both can also be manipulative in order to obtain what they need. Both are totally gorgeous inside and out. I get on fairly well with Libra because as a Taurean we share the same ruling planet - Venus. I'm not sure I'd form extremely deep bonds with this sign due to its sometimes fickle and gratuitous nature, however I have absolutely no doubt that when push came to shove, this unusual sign would come through with the goods in ANY relationship they hold important.|`|QfPJ4dotaa	I Love Libra chicks.<br>  <br>  ~Cute<br>  ~Funny<br>  ~Intelligent<br>  ~Lovely smiles!<br>  ~Very sweet and all around nice and caring.<br>  ~Beautiful eyes, Long, dark, thick eyelashes.<br>  <br>  I'm a Gemini so maybe I'm blowing it out of proportion but I love Libra's. =]|`|7rrNvFK7aa	Libra women are so hot and fun.

Jin-tae and his mother are tough workers, who sacrifice themselves to send Jin-seok to the university. When North Korea invades the South, the family escapes to a relative's house in the country, but along their journey, Jin-seok is forced to join the army to fight in the front, and Jin-tae enlists too to protect his young brother.

0bUwD9usaa	In the 80s, Mickey Rourke was a pretty successful actor and starred in many hit films, but became notoriously difficult to work with. In the 90s, he became a professional boxer (having trained as an amateur) but that took its toll; he eventually had to have major facial reconstruction. He then fell into relative obscurity as an actor until the late 2000s, with films such as "Sin City" and "The Wrestler" reviving his career. People have been comparing him to the character he plays in "The Wrestler" because they followed similar paths; Randy "The Ram" was big in the 80s, but has fallen onto hard times, and eventually makes a comeback in the big match at the end of the film.|`|AA12166503	They have compared it to his life.  Just about being low in your career and dragging yourself back up to redeem yourself.

MlCWsBcwaa	Well, if the teacher hasn't told you what to write about, this is what I think (haven't read the other answers, so sorry if this is a repeat):<br>  - there are problems in society when people are obsessed with appearances and having the right costumes and looking perfect (even Olive eating icecream is criticized)<br>  - family is more important than a lot of people think and true happiness and richness can be found through that rather than through shiny material things<br>  - society can really pick on the weak, imperfect and not popular or beautiful people<br>  - some people are too afraid to have a go<br>  - family dysfunction is common, but it is not easy to say what is right and what is wrong sometimes (you could say that Olive's family is dysfunctional maybe, but then look at them at the end of the film<br>  - money and success are more imortant to society in general and a lot of people than the wellbeing of individuals<br>  <br>  It is a good film.  Hope you can enjoy it, even though you are studying it.  Good luck with the homework.|`|OKmJWGGGaa	Hmm, here's how I would think about it. (you'll have to excuse me, I don't remember their names)<br>  <br>  Dad is obsessed with work<br>  Son is obsessed with becoming a pilot/ the silence<br>  Daughter is obsessed with the beauty pageants<br>  Uncle is suicidal and still mourning over his boyfriend<br>  Grandpa is battling a drug addiction<br>  Mom is obsessed with caring for everyone else.<br>  <br>  In the end, they all come together as one to help out Olive in the beauty pageant. So, I think, actually, it's a kinda happy message. I think that it's saying, despite however crappy families can be towards each other, in the end, they love each other.|`|sy40JGgTaa	umm people think more about superficial rather than family and togetherness. idk thats what i go out of it.|`|ab250551cde4aadbf54a0fea8a7b14e1aa	America has long been nicknamed the "Land of Opportunity". This movie exemplifies this concept on multiple levels:<br>  1) Olive Hoover is able to compete in the Little Miss Sunshine pageant even though she is not the prettiest, nor the most talented, contender. She met the qualifications and paid the entrance fee.<br>  2) Olive's father, Richard, has been able to pursue different job opportunities, even though some have not been successful. His latest venture is to be a motivational speaker and life coach.<br>  3) Uncle Frank has been able to pursue a high level of education to become a well-known scholar in his field of study.<br>  4) Frank also has had the option of choosing a gay lifestyle.<br>  5) The grandfather was able to use a controlled substance without fear of prosecution and exhibited freedom of speech. Haha<br>  6) Olive's brother, Dwayne, has not lost his dream to becomes a test pilot, even though he may be color blind.<br>  7) Olive's mother, Sheryl, is not a "slave to the kitchen". She appears to work only part-time, if that, and is not required to make a 3-course meal for dinner seven nights per week. Therefore, she has the luxury to pursue other ventures.<br>  8) The family suffers numerous setbacks along their journey to the pageant. But they do not give up and remain goal-oriented.<br>  <br>  ONLY IN AMERICA!

621af0f098099c92f52aa36d2f3c318eaa	Well don't get excited right away, there are 2 possibilities one he and you have become really good friends and he's more comftorble around you or two he has feelings for you and wants a relationship, the best thing to do is sit down and talk to him, tell him what you feel im assuming you want to date him again..tell him how spending time with him and having him back in your life makes you happy and that you want to give the relationship thing another try. Don't think about moving in or any thing atleast until you know you both are serious.|`|W1aajt61aa	It seems that a change of scenery & the newness of the change it's brought <br>  Has indeed changed him , It wasn't a matter of any severe changes needed . So take it for what it is & go with yer heart & make sure yer gut can take it either way it goes . Sometimes ya gotta dive in to know if the waters good .|`|6WQo6RpSaa	Maybe he wants you back, so he's changing everything you didn't like about him to show you that he's still into you, and perhaps he's sorry for not changing before....<br>  <br>  Or maybe he just felt like he learned some lessons since the breakup, and he's decided to change himself for the better (using suggestions from what you didn't like about him)...but he's only doing it to better himself and not necessarily because he wants to impress you with how much he's improved.<br>  <br>  I'm not really sure...just take it slowly and try to figure out what his true goals are before you make any final decisions.|`|I40vnqNyaa	Just stay friends and see how it plays out.   maybe he's more relaxed with you now because you are only just friends now instead of being in a relationship.   Let it play out on its own, if youre meant to be together you will be.   A lot of good relationships started out as just friends.  I could think of worse things :)|`|KvkEOi4Taa	BECAUSE HE IS A FAT PRIEST.
M8qLP7MLaa	Sometimes I think that it's because they think they can somehow improve it - but that's usually just when I get frustrated and angry with the anime. It's mostly because they can't get too close to the manga. If they get too caught up with the manga then they have to do something to drag it out until the manga gets ahead.<br>  <br>  There's also having to make things more 'suitable' for television. Have you seen Konohamaru's Sexy: Double Knockout Guys Technique?<br>  <br>  You sure as heck won't see it in the anime. They cut it out - which is extremely stupid because they showed the other one. Another reason for not sticking to the manga is to attempt to tone down things like violence and nudity. Others seem to be for no reason.<br>  <br>  I hear what your saying though. It's very annoying.<br>  <br>  Here's a list of things they cut from the anime.<br>  <a href="http://www.leafninja.com/anime-cuts.php" rel="nofollow">http://www.leafninja.com/anime-cuts.php</a>|`|ryLbKatoaa	It's kinda the same reason books and the movies based off them are so different. My theory is that they believe that fans don't want to see the same thing twice. It makes sense. I probably wouldn't want to see an anime that was EXACTLY like the manga. But it would be nice if they didn't have all the useless filler and some of the random stuff they change.|`|26bf3fd35c715fb12b9f6a291892831eaa	In the anime, there are fillers and changes in script and dialogue. IF there are no fillers, it would finish the anime earlier than the manga (like what happened to Eyeshield 21). And sometimes, they need to change from the manga so it would be more exciting... more suitable for anime.|`|fQ4hVKazaa	the person before me said what happened with dragon ball z..yea thats probably the reason and i hate bleach filler episodes!!!! that and theres more they can do with an anime then a manga so thats probably another reason|`|NjyjMvjqaa	I think that because they have to make the anime longer or it'll catch up to the manga too fast

Salma alone makes it a great movie, but Perry does his part.|`|GGAgxzJNaa	The same can be said for most of the cast of "Seinfeld" and "Cheers".  Not enough credit goes to the writers of a show.  Successful shows combine a great concept with writing and actors that are perfect for the part.  Then the actors start thinking that they're the only reason a show is popular.  Usually they find out differently.  The only ones who have continued success are the ones that have genuine talent, and not just popularity.|`|MlCWsBcwaa	The Ron Clark Story (Matthew Perry).  Good luck.|`|8TOJHuVNaa	Bruce Almighty, The Break Up, He's Just Not That Into You. Those were all good movies.<br>  <br>  As for the rest, not so much.

ZKVlF2pKaa	They started out with the wild card round and then got rid of it, now they've brought it back. Clay Aiken and Jennifer Hudson were both wild cards. They brought it back to take away power from Vote for the Worst and Howard Stein, who cause deserving people to miss their chance at their lifelong dream because it's funnier to watch talentless people get yelled at by the judges week after week. VFTW is at it's most powerful during the earlier stages because most people have a few people they like and there is a wide variety of people to pick from so no one is getting the kind of concentrated vote totals that come about in later rounds.|`|34Nt3ZEfaa	Anoop can definitely sing. There's no doubt about that. I'm glad he got a spot. However, I do believe they did create the wildcard round for manipuating results. If their picks don't show up in top 9, then they'll have their way.<br>  <br>  Also, the extra slot wasn't obviously created on the spot just because they liked 4 really bad contradictory to what Simon said. It was well planned in advance. The judges had already picked out the 4 contestants before the last group even performed.|`|HmCAPy41aa	Interesting theory. Them choosing 13 has messed up the voting lines tonight! 1-866-Idols 13 is a phone sex line so they are trying to figure out what to do for the voting tonight <br>  See this article <a href="http://www.associatedcontent.com/article/1551745/britney_spears_tampa_wardrobe_malfunction.html?cat=9" rel="nofollow">http://www.associatedcontent.com/article...</a><br>  <br>  Ryan Seacrest was talking about the issue today. Oops ;)|`|epAtqgvhaa	writingdivas.com had an interesting writeup on this topic, im not sure how i feel about it yet|`|nbW9Zqi0aa	If it wasn't for wildcard then where would Jennifer Hudson be now??|`|FZVIjQuHaa	I have no problem with the wildcard.  In fact it is a good way of giving a 2nd chance for really good singers.  However Season 8's wildcard round is a farce.  It is actually a casting round (as Simon pointed out they need to cast the group of finalists).  They already made up their minds and it was just formality so their picks get to garner more fans by having more air time.  If they were picking personalities why did they pick Jasmine? She has the personality of a door nail.  Ricky Braddy is less boring but a much seasoned singer and a more entertaining performer on stage. He has mad vocals.  The producers keep on shoving Jasmine and Megan down our throats even though America never selected them.  They didn't give America a vote for the wildcard as they have before.<br>  <br>  Obviously they were filling in a demographic with the Jasmine pick.  Kristen is another great singer who deserves to be in the top 12 but judges hated her image.  If Kelly Clarkson was in Season 8, she would not have made the top 13 if image is a big factor.  The 4 wildcard picks should have been Ricky, Kristen, Felicia, and Matt Giraud.<br>  <br>  We don't need another Britney Spears....singers getting by with their looks but not much about their singing.  It is a singing competition not a supermodel competition so choose the best singers.  The image can be molded and improved later...that's what American Idol is supposed to be all about.|`|1bcYl6SKaa	I guess after Sanjaya they don't trust us anymore.<br>  VFTW!

In order to see each other I would have to come over in the early morning between our two jobs and classes. It was that, or we couldn’t see each other during the week. He started sleeping out on the couch because his roommate that shared a room with him started a graveyard shift and needed his sleep. <br>  <br>  One morning, before the sun came up, I had just let myself in to his apartment, and saw that his alarm clock was by the couch so that he wouldn’t sleep through class. He hadn’t been expecting me so I carefully walked through the pitch black apartment trying not to trip over anything. I wanted to surprise him with a wake up kiss, so I knelt down and started to kiss him. It was turning quite passionate when all of the sudden he went completely rigid. I sat up to see what was wrong and it wasn’t my fiance at all. It was some random guy who had just happened to stay overnight. I thought I was going to die! All I could pathetically say was, “Sorry, I thought you were my fiance.” His reply’ Well, after he stopped laughing and could finally take a breath said “It’s all good.”<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.yourembarrassingmoments.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.yourembarrassingmoments.com</a><br>  <a href="http://www.yourembarrassingmoments.com/story/it-wasnt-my-fiance-at-all.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.yourembarrassingmoments.com/s...</a>|`|faizFiOFaa	well this week like 2 days ago my stomach was havin a spazz attack and it was makin all these weird noises and i was in music class (pure torture) and it made noise and it was REALLY loud and the guy who sits across from me heard and he is not a dork and he heard and he laughed soooo hard i tried to act like i didn't hear him and it wasn't my stomach but he kept laughin and lookin at me i could actually feel myself getting bright red it was terrible|`|I1K6SC43aa	I hope you're embarrassed at how dumb you look spelling moments like that.|`|ktj5qv4faa	just give me a momment.....m's are multiplying like rabbits....
pR4Hwmpbaa	Yeah. 25 years ago I bagged groceries at the supermarket after I graduated from high school. <br>  <br>  It was the only job I could get at the time since the economy wasn't good. <br>  <br>  But it lead to my current job for the same market and I now make pretty decent money and benefits so it was worth it after all...|`|AA10665398	my job can be embarrassing. kids can be very honest. <br>  like one day i was lazy and i was wearing an outfit that wasn't very flattering, and one of the girls asked if i was pregnant because of the way the shirt was fitted...<br>  and since i have to change pull-ups and diapers every so often, it's embarrassing when i have to take them into the bathroom to pull their pants down. and sometimes i have to wipe for the kids who won't do a good job otherwise. =P|`|K4GiKOhPaa	lol ... I thought the same of the guy who followed the elephant at the Ringling Bros. Circus. <br>  <br>  I once modeled in the nude for an art class in college.

I currently have two jobs and I'm currently at risk for losing my main job. I could easily go back to the career I walked away from in 2006. But I would happily go to school and choose to train in another field, rather than go back to a career that I was miserable in.|`|K4GiKOhPaa	Although I'm not at any risk of losing my job, I would definitely consider going back to school.

VY7dlcx7aa	Nah, lots of girls fall in love with cartoon characters- I mean, when you think about it, they're drawn to attractive perfection (never a hair, er, fur out of place) and well-known (and generally better behaved than real guys -.-,).  When I was younger I had a huge crush on Sonic the Hedgehog and Simba >blush<.  It's perfectly fine to like cartoon characters, just so long as you realize they aren't real- otherwise you might miss noticing a human cutie ;)|`|I1K6SC43aa	You're not weird at all.<br>  <br>  I personally think Scar (especially his voice) is sexy.

I can't remember any of us other kids being afraid, but we might have been. I've never met or heard of a dog who was afraid of the vacuum, though.

I unleashed, beating it till he was unrecognizale as a clown.  i would have killed him but the cops came and i ran.  i felt amazing after that.  another clown came up to me and i tried once again to leave.  i didn't try too hard though, he wouldn't let me go, so we fought.  he was good but not as good as me.  we were both bloody and beaten.  he died at the hospital.  i was taken in and because of my age i was put into a mental institution till i was 21 or cured of my "violent coulrophobic tendencies" i'm 15 now, six more years of rage building against them.  my only connection to the outside is my laptop.  i can't talk to anyone else in here because i hate stupidity.  oh well that's my story.  i hate to be the first clown i meet out there.|`|zW5OWgXtaa	RAP SUCKS! it's not even music! its just ppl trying to be all cool and giving bad examples to kids and turn them into meth heads.|`|wBq0ERSJaa	Lil Wayne USED To be the best (Tha Carter 1, 2) But his downfall came on Lollipop and Prom Queen, sucky songs like that.<br>  <br>  So I say Kanye|`|U23DRFtbaa	Kanye West|`|e38ee5dc4874727a4e79ac3360093ac1aa	Kanye West|`|M9YBxkhqaa	Wayne then kanye<br>  why is flo rida even in the question ..|`|qvHllIgeaa	Its a tie between kanye west and lil wayne....|`|drfwOQNIaa	I guess Kanye..<br>  def. not lil wayne. he's last on my list for everything.|`|2kg2cOHOaa	lil wayne|`|wEt7UiTsaa	lil wayne|`|NlXWdRcQaa	Kanye hands down.|`|ZzjUHawhaa	neither. they're all in the same boat with me|`|VR5dGg4taa	Kanye West <br>  T.I.<br>  Flo Rida<br>  Lil Wayne<br>  <br>  in that order....|`|3GRJFGiHaa	T.I|`|7mrtqwJwaa	Kanye but Flo Rida would have been my 2nd choice.|`|gJfayuPFaa	They're all pants.<br>  <br>  Round my way a lot of the kids model themselves on these people.

Even better yet room temp water with a little lemon juice in it not much just enough to flavor the water.Lemon's good on the throat the room temp water keeps you vocal chords from tightening up.

8yE2sYGeaa	Then you would see how absolutely terrible the script really is|`|Klb4ZYcVaa	If you mean college/high school drunk sex, i hate it. <br>  <br>  But I recently saw The Reader, there were mild nude & sex scenes, but they weren't dirty. It was pure love. I even have the novel,you wouldn't believe the description of the sex. It's cute, it's...love. These kinds of sex, it's real. That's why it didn't disturb me.<br>  <br>  Directors likes to film stuff that are happening to you & me, to real people, in real life. Such as mafia movies, killings, gangs & guns ARE real. Racism, swearing--it's definitely real. People who are in love--duh, it's real. That's what connects from movie viewers like us.|`|bELqEsdOaa	Because sex sells more. Easy answer :)...Sad society we live in but that's how Hollywood makes money. By being viral and selling more sex.|`|iWUAWkNNaa	!! I asked this question myself. People are pervs =P|`|aXqi9lYJaa	Then don't go see them<br>  <br>  They are portraying LIFE! <br>  <br>  are you saying sex isn't apart of life?|`|d7ad08b207b33f53609b7f36506e5efdaa	First of all, nudity and sex are two entirely different things.  <br>  <br>  People are frequently nude doing mundane things like bathe and change at the gym , not just to have sex.  Exotic dancers working in Las Vegas regularly spend 8-hour shifts nude and they aren't having sex- their birthday suits are simply their stage uniforms. There are nude beaches all over Europe- families there are simply enjoying the sun, not having sex.  The first Olympic competions held by the ancient Greeks were in the nude.  The human body is a wonderfully complex system and considered by many a work of art, there's nothing inherently wrong with it. <br>  <br>  As for sex- I agree that when it's not essential to the movie plot, when it's just thrown in to sell tickets- gratuitous sex is a negative thing.  And yes it's often overdone, just like advertising.<br>  <br>  However, movies portray life- and sex is a large part of that.  Look around you... all of those people in the movie theatre, in the grocery store, on the freeway- exist because of other people (their parents) having sex!<br>  <br>  If you're showing a movie about nuns living in a convent, someone celibate or undergoing chemotherapy, then sex isn't appropriate in such films.  However for movies about a famous madam, rock star, or corrupt congressman it might be impossible to depict their lifestyle without those elements.<br>   <br>  The restrictions of the 1950s when the bedrooms of married couples were required to show separate beds- that kind of nonsense is what led to many of the unhealthy sexual attitudes and psychological problems people have today- kids were given completely unrealistic views of what life was like. Nowadays the movies industry is more honest, and that's mostly a good thing.<br>  <br>  I agree with the earlier poster- use the ratings and choose which movies to see accordingly.|`|HdEnZrcmaa	Sex sells. If you're like me, a kid who feels that nobody else understands my positions on movies, just a kiss on the lips is more romantic then nude sex scenes. For example, if you've seen To Catch a Thief, the scene in the car over the Riviera was fantastically romantic, and nothing can replace that kind of seductive sexuality, that, while subtle, is so much more intriguing.|`|Cvx7disWaa	What is wrong with the movie industry you ask??? What is wrong with YOU! Seriously, nudity is LIFE. How is a nude human offensive to you? Do you cover yourself in front of a lover or remove the mirrors in the bathroom so as not to offend yourself? If you're your closed mine is so offended by a natural human body, then FOLLOW THE MOVIE RATINGS and quit whining. They're given to each and every movie for a reason and that is to insure you narrow-minded people don't go home sobbing after seeing REALITY!<br>  <br>  I seriously can't believe people worry about such petty issues in this world! Here...have some boobies on me: ( . )( . )|`|XUcn1xnfaa	the movie industry is in tough competition<br>  especially with the economy how it is<br>  and, like they say, sex sells..<br>  i know what you mean, though, it's pretty bad.<br>  XP|`|sUesFoYFaa	...The rating system filters out movies that have sex in them. If you don't want to watch a movie with sex in it, you certainly don't have to. Female nudity has been in movies for decades... and nudity is just now bothering you? The world is changing - each generation is smarter than the last. In the 50's it was scandalous to portray a married couple sleeping in the same bed. Now it's laughable not to.<br>  <br>  But if the male nudity is what is bothering you, I can only say that it's part of gender equality. It isn't like nudity in movies is new - but there has been a recent trend of including full frontal male nudity in "R" rated films. Is male genitalia more sacred or offensive than female gentalia? People push the envelope because movie-goers get bored of seeing the same old safe cliches and after-school special messages.  But there are still plenty of good clean movies out there for children, or adults who don't like being challenged by what they view as entertainment - you just have to pay close attention to the ratings.<br>  <br>  Sometimes sex serves the story - sometimes it doesn't. Just research whatever movie you're considering exposing your family to before you watch it, and you should be fine. Some movies are inappropriate for some audiences, but they are all rated accordingly. Heed the rating if sex bothers you.

There's no real science behind it, but i guess the Krypton chunks (kryptonite) were irradiated from the destruction of krypton, and i guess there where different levels of radiation mean different forms of kryptonite will exsist producing different radiations. It's kinda lame, but it's the only explanation i can think of because the only thing i know for certain is that kryptonite is just parts of krypton that sruvived and scattered through out the universe.|`|022a70c3422f4e77c8a63e672f7c2b18aa	Irradiated mineral deposits left over from the destruction of the planet Krypton.<br>  <br>  The different colors are meant to imply that different radiation wavelengths have different effects on Superman.

So by killing Molech with a pistol everyone will be all like "he does give a damn about costume heroes, he just likes to kill and try to frame others so that he can continue to kill other people brutally".

No.  Would a jury of 12 convict (had they been given the chance)?  Yes.

elLgFNkiaa	Here are a couple tips I have done at voice lessons and things i've learned at school this year and things to always keep in mind<br>  <br>  Always:<br>  Breathe low!  Thats the biggest thing, if your voice sounds whispy, its because you arent supporting it with your breath.  Put a hand on your lower stomach and practice breathing in deep (without raising your shoulders!) and let all the air out and make a hissing "S" noise... the longer you can make the noise and have breath, the better your breath support will be for singing.  Always remember breathe deep!  Think of it as one of those wind up toys,  they can go when it is wound up well but when the wind up starts to get low, they start becoming inconsistant and stuff.. make sure you are supporting your sound!<br>  Also, always have good posture.. Roll your shoulders back to stretch a couple times and keep them back for your posture.  dont shrug your shoulders.  head straight, but not back, feet shoulder width apart..<br>  <br>  as for nasally this excersize usually helps: take your arms like you are pretending to be a chicken (haha) with your elbows out to your sides, then bring the back of your hand up to your cheeks.  Open your mouth one time so you can feel what the seperation is like... then sing a scale or a do-re-mi-fa-sol-fa-mi-re-do and make sure you can feel the seperation.  If you still have troubles, try faking a yawn... then remember what the "yawn space" in your mouth feels like that.  Then sing your song on an ah like fAther. <br>  <br>  another tip: high singing is just stretching your range, sing as high as you can and if you cant sing it sing it on a lip buzz first (*brrr noise where you push air through your lips to make a brr sound hard to explain..) then once you feel good like you can reach the note on that then try an ah... the reason for this is because when your vocal chords are stressed, its harder to hit notes... the more relaxed your voice is, the easier singing becomes.  Focus on relaxing!! <br>  <br>  As for the nasally sound, most nasal sounds are either a) you are singing to forward, or b) you are singing with your tongue.<br>  The easiest to eliminate is b.  The way to tell is, first of all if you can feel the middle part of your tongue or the back of your tongue on the roof of your mouth, its not a good sign.  without Pushing on your tongue (because pushing your tongue tightens vocal chords) rest it on the bottom of your mouth.  Have that same "yawn space" and make sure your tongue is down!  <br>  if you are sure you arent doing it with your tongue then you are too forward in your face.  Most of the time nasally happens when you are singing things like "ng". wrinkle your nose and sing an "ng"... if you can feel it tickle your nose thats good.  try singing this: "zing zing zing zing zaaaaaaaw"..  Start on a "sol or a 5th note" like if you have a piano start on a G and go down to a c.  sing all of the "zings" on the G and then when you sing "zaaaaw" sing the F, E, D, and C.   You should feel a difference between the ziNG and the zAW.  Make sure when you do this that you make the funny face! lol it will help to make you realize.<br>  <br>  Please respond to this and let me know if it helps, I'm really curious as to if these tips helped you. I hope they do!|`|mH8UscHdaa	The best thing you could do is maybe have vocal teacher show you proper ways to sing. I've got my high school Chorus director. I'm sure there is somebody that can help you face to face that knows what they are doing|`|k4iJ4BJqaa	When you sing and talk nasally you may not notice but you can control it. What happens is that you're talking out of the part of you that connects your sinus to your throat. I have noticed that I sing lower if I BREATHE FROM MY CORE. There are alot of exercises that teach this and once it comes naturally you won't have a problem and you can still hit the high notes. To make sure that you are talking right try talking like darth vader. If it sounds like him you can do it. If it makes a sound from in your throat is is just the sinus/throat problem that comes naturally. If you sound right. Try talking like that over periods of time. Each time get closer to your regular voice pitch. When you find the place where you start to sound nasaly that is your ding----something. Find it online. For me it is the note that makes me change voice keys inside of my vocal chord. (I am not perfect either) work on that area until it is un-nasaly. If you don't know how to do that with a normal voice start trying to sing that exact place. It more than likely is around the area of your ding----something too. Practice it with singing and make that the base of all of your singing exercises. You will eventually get better at it. GL!

Go on www.youtube.com, www.playlist.com, or maybe yahoo or google and In the search box type some of the lyrics (a phrase) in the song inside quotes followed by the word lyrics. Notice the displayed list of possible websites and some various words that the search engine found that may or not be your song. <br>  Browse down the list, and check for the lyrics for your song. Often some words are found but not others, this may be because your search engine is searching for parts or your phrase. <br>  Try singing the lyrics if they are given to see whether or not it seems to be the right song. <br>  Click to play a short sample of the song if the websites has a button where you can do that. <br>  <br>  Be careful because fewer words will broaden the search and have a much larger list of results.|`|162jcvOyaa	"Some People Change" by: Montgomery Gentry<br>  <br>  Kenny Chesney sings it too but i like the Montgomery Gentry version better|`|8LfW9tBxaa	type in what you remember on youtube it always works with me. just like some of the lyrics.|`|7LWDRI2Uaa	Montgomery Gentry<br>  <br>  His old man was a rebel yeller:<br>  Bad boy to the bone.<br>  He'd say: "Can't trust that other fella,"<br>  He'd judge 'em by the tone of their skin.<br>  He was raised to think like his Dad:<br>  Narrow mind full of hate.<br>  On the road to no-where fast,<br>  Till the Grace of God got in the way.<br>  Then he saw the Light an' hit his knees an' cried an' said a prayer:<br>  Rose up a brand new man; left the old one right there. <br>  <br>  Here's to the strong; thanks to the brave.<br>  Don't give up hope: some people change.<br>  Against all odds, against the grain,<br>  Love finds a way: some people change. <br>  <br>  She was born with her mother's habit:<br>  You could say: "It's in her blood."<br>  She hates that she's gotta have it:<br>  As she fills her glass up.<br>  An she'd love to kill that bottle,<br>  But all she can think about,<br>  Is a, a better life, a second chance,<br>  An' everyone she's letting down.<br>  She throws that bottle down. <br>  <br>  Here's to the strong; thanks to the brave.<br>  Don't give up hope: some people change.<br>  Against all odds, against the grain,<br>  Love finds a way: some people change. <br>  <br>  Thank God for those who make it:<br>  Let them be the Light. <br>  <br>  (Let them be the light)<br>  (Some people change.)<br>  Here's to the strong; thanks to the brave.<br>  Don't give up hope: some people change.<br>  Against all odds, against the grain,<br>  Love finds a way: some people change.<br>  Some people change.|`|SmGqKInEaa	its called Some people change by Montgomery Gentry..<br>  but it was first sang by Kenny Chesney

grwtwPbAaa	He who learns must suffer. And even in our sleep pain that cannot forget falls drop by drop upon the heart, and in our own despair, against our will, comes wisdom to us by the awful grace of God. <br>  Aeschylus <br>  <br>  Jimi, here are three more quotes from our famed Aeschylus which seem appropriate.  "Wisdom cometh by suffering." ; <br>  "The reward of suffering is experience!"  As these tears fall upon our hearts, whipsering great painful truths upon our hearts, it is here we hear the voice of our Lord!   Here is the third quote, " Only when one mans life comes to end in prosperity can one call that man happy!"   For me dearest one, this is when man's tears and pains are reconciled to the fact that true prosperity is touching the face of God, being held in his loving grace....so yes dear one, Aseschylus' gracefilled words do sound real as whispering thoughts within our sleep!

hgaNxhoaaa	Go to your teacher. Tell him/her that you are usually a very good student, and that you feel you possibly made a mistake on the test. Can you prove that your answers were correct if you had not made that mistake? If so, show your teacher. Ask what you can do as far as re-testing. <br>  <br>  Also, explain to your teacher that you know grades aren't everything, but that it's important to you to maintain high academic achievement and so you're willing to do whatever you can to make sure this grade isn't recorded. Don't cry or whine (that will just make him/her feel you are trying to manipulate them), just be firm and kind with your request.<br>  <br>  Hope this helps!|`|b3c3863dda7cbe4797e9764da4ef8a23aa	you could ask for mercy from your instructor, showing him the axis transposition error and asking that he ding you for the initial error, but not for all the rest of the wrongs answers (if you can prove that you understood the concept, but the mislabeling caused the remainder of the wrong answers).

Thats not respect thats just mean flirtation! <br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|dPxcoeP0aa	i would stay away. he doesnt respect you. and if he tells you to shut up! thats a sign.|`|9KklyOcbaa	No, I don't think he hates you. My Leo friend can be a real butt at times, but I think he's just trying to be playful. I've known my friend for a little over a year. We go long periods without talking to each other, but when we do talk to each other, he's sarcastic (not in a mean way, though). There was this one time when we were at a restaurant, and he just moved spots without telling me. He was laughing at me, and I kind of took it wrong. I admit that I overreacted, but my gut was telling me he didn't want me there so I laughed it off and left. I think a Leo just needs to know when they've crossed the lines. I think a lot of the times they get away with more than another sign may be able to. Try and be a "punk" back to him. He'll like the fact that you can roll with the punches and that you can keep up with him mentally. The fact that he doesn't remind you of anyone else is probably part of the attraction. However, Leos and Scorpios are not supposed to be a perfect match. If you want to be with him, it will require a lot of work on both ends, and I'm sure the harder you work, the longer you'll last. Good luck and best wishes!
BxTAfd2baa	Yes.  we own about 30 some-odd chickens and whenever a new rooster comes along to try to take over our rooster, he ends up in the crock pot.  Roosters are very edible, if not a little tough, but are not available in your commercial market because they are little hellraisers and are tougher than hens.  I would recommend a soup or gumbo(Gravy, meat, rice, and veggies), because you chop up the meat instead of eating it in large chunks.  I do not reccomend anything in which the meat is left in one piece.  I hope this will be of some use to you.  Bon appetite|`|PdoxZTqOaa	Lol roosters are chickens, just male.

qLvhoRpsaa	I think that it must go back to the basic primal need to be the best (insert title here) so to ensure our survival. <br>  <br>  By pointing out another’s "weak spot,” “illness,” or "tell” it puts us above that person, and therefore surviving, outsmarting, and dominating the lesser person. <br>  <br>  Sarcasm is a more refined and twentieth century way to do the same thing, on a linguistic level. <br>  <br>  Having said that, I have been known to be sarcastic, as I can be very lazy and “primal’ myself! <br>  <br>  Ignore, or join in on the primal kill thrill!<br>  <br>  Peace:)<br>  <br>  P.S.

AA11369432	Years ago it was soaps  that sponsored them...thus picking up the  name  Soap opera|`|cdf9bde60acfd0a622e4bbdccdc9e515aa	To add to Skip's answer, I noticed the other day that As the World Turns is also a P&G production. I saw P&G come up in the credits and thought hmm, Procter and Gamble? But reading your question made me remember the soap sponsorships from back in the day. It's kind of neat.|`|8xdcBKfUaa	Because in the beginning, the earliest soap operas, and some even today, were sponsored by soap companies, primarily Proctor and Gamble. And the opera part of the soap opera comes from actual operas, as in the theatre, because they tell stories from beginning to end. So basically, a soap opera is an "ongoing story (opera) brought to us by soap manufacturers (soap). It does seem a little out there, but this is factual.|`|0aaa10bf1334628de7df8d1527e7a5a7aa	Soap Operas got that name because  the original sponsors when they were first produced on radio were soap companies. In fact, Proctor and Gamble (the people who bring you Ivory, Camay,Safeguard, Zest, Cheer, Gain, and Tide) still actually produce The Guiding Light under the name of P&G Productions (watch the credits). At one time they had almost every major soap opera.|`|2kpr2arRaa	because when they first started on the radio they were Sponsered by Soap companys|`|x5dXU8vWaa	bacause we like the word SOAP!

9XGTjIqMaa	Corona<br>  Budlight<br>  Dos Equis<br>  <br>  :)|`|8OREBeRdaa	Where do I begin!!!? I'll break it down by category because no single beer is my fave<br>  Wheat Ale - St. Ambroise Apricot Wheat Ale, Schneider Weisse Hefewisse<br>  - it's because these have a unique taste that's not too bubbly and no bad aftertaste<br>  <br>  Lager / Pilsener - Bavaria, Dead Frog Lager<br>  - no bitter beer face, clean finish for a lager, pairs well with food.<br>  <br>  Porter - St. Peter's Old Style<br>  - all I can say is that this has a classic taste, it's really flavorful<br>  <br>  Ale - Double Diamond (UK),<br>  - just the most refreshing cleanest ale I've ever sampled. It's like nectar of the gods.<br>  <br>  Stout - Big Ridge Espresso Stout, Guinness, Okanagan Black<br>  - all of these are rich in flavor, texture, and are hearty. Each one has a fullness that rounds out the palette and are signature for Irish pub toasts.<br>  <br>  Other - Scotch Ale> McEwan's, McGregor Whisky Malt, Swan's Scotch Ale<br>  - If you'd like a hearty mix of full bodied and full flavored ale what has the abundance of a stout, this is for you!<br>  <br>  Seasonal - Granville Island Winter Ale, Mission Springs Smasking Pumpkin Ale, Jolly Abbot Abbey Ale,<br>  - all of these seasonal holiday ales are abundant with rich flavours and colors from a combination of nutmeg, cloves, cinnamon and pumpkin. Higher alcohol content and they warm the cockles of your liver.<br>  <br>  Bard's Tale - Dragon's Gold (Gluten Free) - one of the cleanest beers I have every had. Goes down so smooth.|`|5oBYGB5Vaa	I've drank almost every type & brand of beer & ale. I like Budweiser Dry, Killian's Red, Heineken (dark & pale), Blackened Voodoo (blackberry flavored), Schoenling's Creme Ale, Michelob Classic Dark (but I think they quit making it) -- I couldn't pick just one. The absolute worst beer I ever tried was Falls City -- if I want a laxative, I'll go to the drug store! ~:|>|`|myf1nTVwaa	I should say 'yet to be determined' because there are so many I have yet to try, but for all intensive purposes the beer I purchase most often is Peroni of Italy.

In fact I love the big natural light show, from a distance, and the crashing loud thunder, after. Lightning strikes are highly unpredictable, and can inflict great damage and even kill.

I just don't like it when ya can hear it sizzle when it cracks. That's way to close!|`|1MWPKTLoaa	no, when there is lightning and thunder, i go outside and start laughing my evil laugh|`|EPki0rwgaa	I LOVE Lightning!|`|AA11969873	Slightly now.. but when i was younger i would lose my appetite i was so afraid|`|AA12117915	no... more scared of thunder.. but i think storms are comforting..|`|j27SONW9aa	nah...it makes me sleep better|`|WX2S8eUxaa	no thunder's the scary part|`|zRyI5CMGaa	No not at all!.|`|0qtgH7lNaa	no, i love watching it. haha|`|AA10426129	very much so|`|9BY9S3lraa	no, I LIKE IT! :D|`|79157f79dd458394e932dcb98eeae0fbaa	Only if I'm under a tree when it hits.

Nick doesn't want to be with you and never will. That's reality.
K6rZmVmAaa	I agree with you on that point. I wouldn't want to leave my children with someone who still acts like he's 15. x|`|AA12349214	Dont be silly.  She married him because she loved him.  She left her money however in a trust fund for her kids and her childrens welfare will be shared between her mother and the childrens natural father.  She may be many things, but actually, stupid isnt one of them,  She knows what he is like and had she lived the relationship would probably have run its course.  But judge ye not lest ye be judged - I know of a lad like Jack who has anger management issues, who can lash out and behave irrationally and dangerously at times - but underneath he is the nicest, most loving person you could wish to meet and who hates the way this other persona takes him over sometimes.  So dont judge a book by its cover, more often than not, all is not what it would at first seem.|`|la9zji2Uaa	You're a little late - you really needed to be there at the part where they say "does any persons here know of any reason why these two.....", that's where you jump up and shout "He is so violent he has been in prison and with the police for violence...after Jade passes away, he could do that with her little kids? Like beat then up and stiff". x|`|B24W8w43aa	It's her decision. As long as it makes her happy.|`|JeACGbWNaa	I think every 1 should shut up about Jade Goody once and for all, ok so she dosent deserve the Cancer i wldnt wish it on any 1, 6 of my family members have died in the last 4 years of Cancer so i know wots its like, but c'mon wots the big deal with Jade, y is every 1 making out they really care, wen 3 years ago they hated here for the racist remarks against Shilpa Poppadom in Celeb Big Brother, when in fact she shouldnt of been i there coz Jade wos never a Celeb in the first place, the original show she woz on woz won by Kate Lawler who is a well known DJ in London, would every 1 be the same if Kate had cervical cancer aswell.......i think not..<br>  <br>  1 other thing how dare Jade turn round and say she is planning DIANA style funeral that is a complete insult to the royal family and the rest of the uk, and to the spirit of Diana the greatest lady ever to grace our country.!!!!!<br>  <br>  i know ill get some serious stick for saying all this, but hey someone has to say somthing, and im only answering ure question truthfully.....<br>  <br>  Those of you that are giving me a bad rating, how many of you can truthfully say u actually like Jade Goody and think she should get all this attention.?????|`|g0xB8Z1Oaa	She is old enough to judge that for her self, but on his past behaviour I don't think the marriage would have reached it's 25th wedding anniversary. Probably not even 3 years, I think once she has passed I guess Jeff will take over the full care of the boys, and Tweed will cut and run.|`|FoXMTx6Baa	They will go back to their father. <br>  <br>  Jack would need to adopt the boys to get custody. The authorities wouldn't be looking at his violent track record favourably so the chance he could adopt them is nil.|`|K2d51gwOaa	Hopefully the kids will be taken by social services and given to a good family.<br>  <br>  Jade and Jack are just a couple of low-life chavs.|`|TXyFtQ9uaa	I'm sure she knows him a lot better than you do. Mind your own business, have a heart and leave the woman alone she's on her death bed for God's sake !|`|CL5kLE2paa	Jade Goody & Jack Tweed are well matched|`|B5Rpl7Auaa	They were made for each other.|`|dUwl7Gn0aa	well at least he wont be beating her up soon....|`|x9WmBlu4aa	if it was a legal way  to stop her ex that low life  and other z list (fake)celebrity jeff brazier being able to step in claiming the rights to her sons (or more to the point her sons money). then the marriage was a good idea.|`|KlkUj6uFaa	Pooh bear said it best!<br>  <br>  I personally don't think it's up to anyone to say whether she should or shouldn't have married him because it's their decision. <br>  <br>  She has the right to spend the last few weeks of her life doing what makes her happy, and marrying Jack Tweed has obviously brought her some happiness during all the anguish and pain she has had to endure recently.

itViz7Gwaa	children of bodom and as i lay dying both growl just as much as L.O.G<br>  <br>  if you hate growling then why are you going to a metal concert<br>  every metal band has growls in it unless they're an instumental metal band|`|m0Ws985gaa	Lamb of God are very, very precise when they're live and are extremely exhilarating. Randy Blythe, love him or hate him, is great with the crowd and he's a sweet vocalist once you get past the fact that he's screaming. And just wait until they play Black Label live, then tell me you don't like them hahaha<br>  Edit: Ah true. I'd say definately go see them but I'm biased, truthfully you'd probably have a better time saving your money for someone else. They both growl pretty much the whole time.|`|fvojJcF6aa	yeeeeah dont go. just waith for opeth to come. =)

I much rather listen to death metal than crappy modern power metal any day.<br>  <br>  As of underated bands that are not death metal i would say The Gates Of Slumber some really good doom metal from my city Indianapolis.<br>  <br>  Demiricous-Deaththrash with thrash vocals another local band that was on metal blade till there former mgr screwed them out of touring and eventually got dropped.<br>  Sentenced-Very good metal with clean vocals.|`|BvHRriEyaa	Ok, a few bands off the top of my head...<br>  <br>  Stratovarius<br>  Iron Savior<br>  Edguy<br>  <br>  Not sure if it's *exactly* what you're looking for but I will come back with some more after I have been to sleep :p<br>  <br>  EDIT - I just thought of Nocturnal Rites|`|2c9e27b528ec302c442a3ff42014807daa	Most of the music I listen to is under-rated and unknown.

vsy4QMHMaa	Absolutely not, Salieri was a first rate composer; he just has the misfortune of having lived at the same time as Mozart and has been sorely overlooked as a composer.|`|CrAwmz65aa	I once wrote a message to a newsgroup saying, "When I tune in late on a classical station, I can't tell Mozart from Salieri or Beethoven from Dittersdorf.  I feel like I'm being hypocritical for exalting Mozart and Beethoven just because everyone else does.  What do you think?"<br>  <br>  Someone wrote back saying that it is not a matter of which composer does better in a blindfold test, but rather which composer was more innovative.  <br>  <br>  I know that Mozart was innovative, but I don't know about Salieri.<br>  All the same, I am hypothesizing that Mozart was more innovative than Salieri.<br>  <br>  Court Violinist, your links don't work.<br>  Can you try again?|`|tuATxHsVaa	[Edit: Links fixed. Sorry.]<br>  <br>  People that dismiss the rumor might not have done proper research into the subject. There are reasons to believe both conclusions.<br>  <br>  Why was Salieri so eager to shout "bravo" to every number when Mozart took him to see his Magic Flute? Was he hiding his sinister intentions beneath the glee? Was he really senile (and off his rocker) when he declared himself to be the killer of Mozart, sank into depression, and attempted suicide?<br>  <br>  Now ask yourself... if you are dismissing this... did you really do the proper research? Are you sure you aren't just regurgitating someone else's opinion?<br>  <br>  Salieri was one of the few people who attended Mozart's funeral. Evidence also tells us that he came to Mozart's deathbed. Why is it that Mozart was buried in an unmarked community grave? Was it really the outbreak of fever in Vienna - or was it through Salieri's influence that Mozart's body cannot be exhumed and examined?<br>  <br>  Were you aware that the Musikalisches Wochenblatt had an article about Mozart's poisoning within a week of his death? That the composer's body had been bloated and swollen?<br>  <br>  Did he poison Mozart? Well, there are lots of reasons to believe that he did. Mozart was in direct conflict with him as a composer of Italian operas. They CERTAINLY weren't on friendly terms, but they did act civilized toward each other in public. Salieri even used his influence with the Emperor to stop the performance of some of Mozart's operas. Is that what friends do? No.<br>  <br>  The man who wrote Amadeus, Peter Shaffer, was an incredible Mozart scholar. He loved Mozart. The first time that he arrived at the opera theater that they used in the movie, he had to run away into a hidden corner and cry. The director found him there. He was crying because he had been standing in the very place where Mozart had conducted the premier of "Don Giovanni."<br>  <br>  This is a good link:<br>  <br>  <a href="http://tarlton.law.utexas.edu/lpop/etext/lsf/29-2/salieri.html" rel="nofollow">http://tarlton.law.utexas.edu/lpop/etext...</a><br>  <br>  A very good and balanced account of the poisoning.<br>  <br>  There is an anecdote that claims that Rossini was brought to Beethoven's house by Salieri, and that Beethoven slammed the door in their faces yelling “How dare you come to my house with Mozart’s poisoner?”<br>  <br>  Salieri was one of Beethoven's most important music teachers... (He never actually had any proper lessons with Haydn). Beethoven often referred to himself as the "student of Salieri."<br>  <br>  Salier's music gets rather tiresome for me. I find it lacking in melodic content, and overly homophonic - even simplistic.<br>  <br>  Here is The overture from one of Salieri's best operas, Europa riconosciuta (this is some of his best work right here, and it is satisfying to some degree - if all of Salieri's music was like this... his work would be more well known):<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iv2VYQnuZcA" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iv2VYQnuZ...</a><br>  <br>  The last movement of his flute and oboe concerto, which I find entirely dull:<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_wW7ej-Gpv0" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_wW7ej-Gp...</a><br>  <br>  His Piano Concerto in C major:<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BxPJt_yk7MQ&feature=related" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BxPJt_yk7...</a><br>  <br>  Court Violinist<br>  <br>  *|`|9PK7mITnaa	Salieri no question was an amazing composer. Study some of his works, it is just as on par as some of mozarts. He was a master at his time. Sure, Mozart was better (hes mozart), but Salieri was still great. <br>  <br>  I dont understand why some people say they dont hear "genius" in his works. If you are not a classically trained composer/musician, you wouldnt know any better. You would only lean towards mozart because you have been introduced to his works all throughout your life. <br>  <br>  To finish my spiel, Salieri was great.|`|64jTtN0jaa	I love that film! He probably wasn't "evil" but they have to make him seem evil and insane to make a better story haha. <br>  <br>  Also Mozart was a bleepin genius... who wouldn't look mediocre compared to him LOL.|`|PS0oSoXFaa	No, he wasn't at all. He and Mozart were friendly rivals. And Salieri was a mediocre composer, but he wasn't bad and he certainly wasn't insane or evil<br>  <br>  But this is still one of my absolute favorite movies. (I mean it, way up there!) So they weren't really enemies, or so Mozart's music wasn't really so unappreciated, or so how they buried him was typical... It's still a beautiful, creative movie that's well acted and that really makes you think about the nature of genius and the rampages of jealousy<br>  <br>  As a documentary- no, it's not at all accurate. As a work of art, though, and as a study of human character and divine justice, Amadeus is amazing :)<br>  <br>  Edit: OK, so you want specifics :) His music itself? I've only listened to a little of it, like all classical people I think. It's decent, well constructed, some of it's pretty... But it's not genius. At least I don't think so. Mozart came up with many of the most amazing melodic lines ever written. And he was very good at writing music that fit a particular genre perfectly. The voices from Salieri's operas, for example, would sound the same in symphonies or even piano pieces. Mozart's operas were unique and perfectly took advantage of the strengths/characteristics of vocal music. As did his piano concertos, and his best symphonies... And he was just more innovative. He combined many styles of his day together (styles that we don't recognize, we think it's "just Mozart," but listeners in his day new them- Sturm und drang is just one example). He was much more subtle in general<br>  <br>  You're entitled to your own opinion. Trust me, I won't mock you! But in my opinion, Mozart was brilliant and Salieri was decent but second-rate; this is the consensus, and I agree with it :)<br>  <br>  i.jones- really, you think so? I'll trust you, but I never heard genius in his music. But it's been ages since I listened to it, so maybe I should give it another try...
vsy4QMHMaa	All I about Lutes couldn't fill a thimble. <br>  <br>  They were often used for a continuo part in vocal music; probably played both continuo and melody in lute music, and could have from 6 to something like 20 strings.<br>  <br>  ... I don't think you can pull off a reasonable reduction (rendition) on a violin. If you're going to try, I think you'll have to do pizz. quasi guitara. But I think you'll need at least two, maybe three instruments to pull it off.|`|obGQ2Bqfaa	The whole point of the great lute works by Bach, Dowland et al., is the interplay in the voices of the usually 3, 4, 5-part harmony; I should suggest that this would be a tall order on the violin.<br>  <br>  You are doing well to be able to bring this music off on the lute in the first place!|`|17eabce31842e2d00325f347d026051eaa	Not everything.

Nc637a6laa	It's what I've been saying from the beginning.  But don't blame me I voted Republican. The problem started as soon as the American people decided they wanted a democratic congress so they voted one in, in 2006.  That became the year of our economic fall. Our taxes started to rise then and our mortgages started to fail, not in 2000 or 2004 as everyone wants to believe but in 2006. Bush made a lot of mistakes but everything that has happened in Washington has not been his fault.  He has just been the corrupter's escape goat. Obama's 3 Trillion dollar deffict will cause even more taxes to be taken out of your paycheck and every other hard working middle class tax payer.  Our Country is in so much trouble.  What You are considering doing (leave the Country) after college is what a lot of people will probably do also and where will that leave the people that are unable to do the same. It is truly a sad situation.  We need to take back Our Government.  This is written in Our Constitution and Our Bill of Rights by Our Fore Fathers!

GiPinhjwaa	I would say use isohunt.com..it uses utorrent to download files, and its so easy. I would suggest don't use limewire because its just all about porn when you download things. Isohunt has new releases, old movies, tv shows, programs, pictures, clips, and the list goes on and on. In order to use isohunt, you have to download utorrent, but its very simple. It tells you the title, the size, how common it is being used, and if theres anything potentially dangerous about it. If you do use this program, when a movie is finished downloading, dont delete it right away because the way it works is that when someone downloads something, the next person that wants it is downloading it from you, so if you delete it, they cant get it, so please be nice and let it sit on there for a couple of days or so...email me back if it worked or not..guslover2389@hotmail.com|`|5lXSw9Ycaa	<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J016nl626dU&feature=channel_page" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J016nl626...</a><br>  try this|`|kN00x0Vaaa	www.movie6.net.<br>  <br>  You can choose to download or watch right on the PC :)|`|12VHusllaa	Try <a href="http://www.themoviedownloadsonline.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.themoviedownloadsonline.com</a>|`|dhtbzlT4aa	Hello, i suggest you download your movie here: www.movieph.com you dont need register just click to download and your all done!|`|7xCfyZDpaa	dont take all suggestion some of these ignorant people are trying to give you!

C8NkAhYpaa	The real beef is not over the land but over life. For some reason Hamas does not see Israels right to live. And i don't mean live in Israel i mean live anywhere at all. <br>  <br>  <br>  If Hamas stopped firing rockets the war would be over. Hamas however will not stop firing rockets and thus the war is on their heads.<br>  <br>  Some blame that Israel stole the land. If there was suddenly brand new land and Israel went there and gave them back their land but were still next store neighbors Hamas would still be trying to kill them.<br>  <br>  It's actually in their charter that Israel apparently does not even exist.|`|7R7e6yX5aa	Zionism-blame England for making a big deal out of it in the first place-many Jews are against Zionism because it singles people out instead of uniting them|`|AA12211242	hamas are palestinians who used to live in israel before israel (the British Mandate) was created 60 years ago. after the independence war in 1948 many palestinians had to leave the country as result of the war.<br>  <br>  in this war israel fought 5 arab (lebanon, syria, egypt, jordan and iraq) countries and the palestinians and won the fight while some palestinians of them had to leave, some ran and some by force.<br>  <br>  until today they still fight in terror ways (which will lead to nothing) to get the territory.<br>  <br>  <br>  the palestinias had their chance before they attacked the jews in israel to get bigger territories then the jews in an agreement but they didnt want it, they wanted all and lost all.<br>  <br>  the fight is for territory. and they wont stop until they have all, thats their idea.|`|cqpctVWbaa	That answer goes back all the way to the Crusades.

DXtyMRLuaa	I'll start saying I don't think its for everyone, not because anyone cannot watch it but because I know its not a movie alot of people would understand or appreciate. The problem I think people are having with this movie is the way it was marketed isn't exactly spot on to the truth of the movie. I think people somewhat expected a Batman type movie but got a Sin City type movie. So for some it will be a pleasant surprise ( like for me ) and for others it will be a disappointment and disturbing. I didn't expect the movie to be as graphic as it was ( mostly because they make movies so dry alot of times just to get a ratings or pull in a certain audience ) but the truth to the book really impressed me. I'm not a super fan, in fact I only read the book after my husband pressured me, but I loved the symbolism of the movie and I though the visuals where stunning. I highly recommend seeing it at least, even if you hate it.|`|76140b1733cd124dbe960a504bc06f8daa	Babe: read the book.|`|Znr8sI5Qaa	Maybe it's one of those movies people need to watch when they are high? idk.

You would have to say more about what it says so I could better help you to understand. I used to work for two doctors who were brothers. Their handwriting was so illegible that they switched to squiggles for their names. The older brother or the "big" brother had the "big" squiggle and the younger brother or the "little" brother had the "little" squiggle.|`|Auw4eHf5aa	I think the down arrow mean crush it up and snort it.<br>  <br>  Edit:  My bad...I think you are having roid rage with all that yelling...|`|8TmK8Qklaa	Just hold the cap firmly between your fingers on both sides and push down and twist.<br>  <br>  Should open.|`|DDnxY3k1aa	no|`|hkX6xqvfaa	Yes I know what you mean, it is harder than saying <br>  <br>  Supercalifrgilisticexpialadosious:<br>  <br>  I think they all learnt to write on the planet krypton or some place like that.|`|Wn0Hj7H4aa	I hear the army tried to enlist them in WW II to send dispatches that no enemy could read but ike turned it down.....he he he he|`|601769880381ed0f6423429080479dccaa	I was a licensed pharmacist for years, so yeah...I can read a prescription.|`|D9IbINdFaa	Yeah and it's impossible! lol

W7eEsMjuaa	I love the show medium! I saw Patricia Arquette on a talk show a few weeks ago talking about how her real life son played a part in an episode. It was the one episode about the man who made a bomb when he was younger,. to help his radical and abusive  father blow up 15 people. The young boy was being played by Patricia Arquettes real life son. But I hadn't hear about Sofia Vassilieva who plays Ariel, being the real life daughter of husband Joe  Or little Marie,. but I have heard rumors about it . I agree about Brigette, (who I sometimes find annoying) never growing up or older. I watch it every week though. Its one of my favorite shows!

sORJIVlXaa	Nirvana is probably one of the five most overrated bands ever. They ripped the intro to Heart shaped box from a British Band Killing Joke, and the possiblity remains they chopped part of teen spirit from Boston. Pearl Jam is as talented if not more so and what do you ever hear about them.<br>  <br>  My prediction is one day Slipknot will have the title of most overrated.<br>  AC/DC is overrated in the sense there sound is consistently repeated since 1969.<br>  Guns 'N' Roses is another overrated band.<br>  <br>  Above the Load album was good, Reload was mediocre, St. Anger was the only dissapointing album. And playing the same music since 1981 would be similar to eating the samething everyday it Change is something a lot of musicains do.|`|By226Cp0aa	first pink floyd members did alot of drugs. i would have to say that the new groups i say groups b/c most of them dont play instruments and they dont qualify as a band.like fall out boy my chemical romance and 30 seconds from mars. now dont get it twisted i like 30 secs. but i have to listen in small doses if not my ears bleed and i puke a little in my mouth|`|97c7897e3a3e02613ea1f017845e7ac4aa	Linkin Park and Nickelback.|`|WKpiqj4baa	Jonas Brothers.|`|C7YbYUYPaa	Oh man.  I would take time to answer this with good back up and logic, but you wouldn't even care would you?  The best answer is going to go to the person that agrees with you first.<br>  <br>  The fact that you say Floyd and Zeppelin are overrated is enough for me to throw anything you say out with the garbage.  It is one thing to have a different musical taste, but don't insult two of the greatest, most influential bands to ever grace the stage.  I don't care if you don't like them, it is your choice, but don't call them overrated because you don't like them. Don't throw around words like that, it makes the word lose all meaning...|`|Zxl8oyIraa	Metallica seems strangely out of place in ur lil lineup. its actually good. anyways, and im prolly gonna get some hate for this, my answer is........................ The Beatles. I just don't see what everybody else does. They're not bad, but some people are calling them the greatest rock band ever. I don't get it.<br>  <br>  P.S. people like The Floyd because of their strange style. grow some taste.|`|dvUS0HHXaa	Pink Floyd are terrible... Hmmm.<br>  <br>  You've listed some pretty generic bands amongst your favourites but you call the pioneers of the prog rock genre terrible?<br>  <br>  Well anyway I think U2 is severely overrated. I also think Nickelback is overrated and too commercial. They were alright back in their early days but now they are just another generic rock band. Pink Floyd, Nirvana or Led Zeppelin didn't fall into this mould of commercialist success, they branched off to craft their own signature sound and style.|`|OLCoFKQraa	I just think you're stupid and have horrible taste in music...|`|AA11464625	So you see a light that the rest of us do not see? We all have our own taste in music and that is what makes the world go round. If all of us had your taste in music my gosh the world would be so boring. Where would the motivation be for all the different rock groups to sound different, if they all had to meat your taste requirements?<br>  <br>  The rock bands I think are overrated are: Green Day, Aerosmith, Metallica, Bon Jovi, Tom Petty and the Heartbreakers, and Def Leopard. Hold it!!! Those are the same groups you love, now how can that be? Oh man you like some weird groups. How dare you have different taste than me?|`|rIFqv8nvaa	motorhead overrated? Wow. Oh well your opinion.<br>  I think Metallica is way over rated. Guitar is okay, but for metal its really weak, drummer is slow. Lyrics suck. Kirk Hammett is over rated. He is good, but not great!! Listen to Jeff Loomis.....<br>  <br>  Btw pink floyd dosent just sound like there on drugs, they really are on drugs.<br>  Nickelback is the worst band in the history of music (seriously)<br>  U2 sucks soooo bad<br>  Nirvana sucks<br>  Our lady peace sucks<br>  Chili peppers suck|`|4c879e06a953e160a4b11102344caa44aa	In rock music, there is no best or overrated. We are all equal against the "man". Nickelback is OK but you can't really compare rock bands because you don't have anything to compare them with. You can say a band are NOT a rock band, but you can't say the band the best or the worst. There isn't such thing. Anyway. I think the most overrated band which tries to rock but doesn't, is Tokio Hotel. <br>  <br>  P.S.: I also have good taste in music, but I only listen to rock and pop. All other types don't pick me up ,you know...|`|FSikubhqaa	Just because Nickelback works for you, doesn't mean it's going to work for everyone. With that being said, I don't think they're all that great. But to each his own because I love Weezer, and some people don't feel the same. It's cool. <br>  I agree about Pink Floyd, but not Led Zeppelin. As for today's music, I think anything like Fallout Boy is kinda weird. Then again, I love classic rock, so with you loving Nickelback, no wonder you "appreciate" such bands like Aerosmith. <br>  <br>  To each his own.|`|J81tP8k2aa	Um....im not sure what qualifies nickelback to be the bast in your line of thinking. Im not a fan of Nirvana, but I respect them. They have been a great impact on the music scene. Nickelback? Um, what impact have they made? <br>  <br>  So most overrated band? Nickelback.|`|AA11146515	nickelback is crap Far overated Chad needs to shove that photograph ( my most despised song  EVER who let the dogs out is a better friggin song) directly up his...

1f89d3f66ea87e0a65d851553af50076aa	Both! You should really start by just messing around with it and getting a natural feel for the instrument. Then start learning notes and how to play that way, cords etc. Always play free style a bit and just goof around too. This will make you a much better player and creator later on. You will probably naturally start picking up how to play by ear after some experience with it. This is the typical and traditional way chinese people learn to play any instrument, it is the most natural and you'll find the chinese very skilled with their instruments.|`|769b07b0d98bbf69a1dbeebf1e2aeaeaaa	if you just want to know how to play guitar, start with tabs. If you're serious about it learn the notes. Playing by ear comes with experience, however some seem to have a natural talent for it like Kurt Cobain did.|`|b0e818fcf5ddd0e1a1fbd2e470474b5baa	You have to read the notes. But you can get a better idea of the tune when you listen, and also a better idea of the right cords to play. My son is always reading the notes and also watching or listening when he can. and he is really good on the guitar<br>  <br>  Hope this helps May God bless you|`|0fa24f54a5dbbf8dd6f29021fe33415caa	Has more to do with how well you understand music. If you have knowledge of reading sheet music, then it may be easier for you that way. Personally, listening to music and recreating it in that fashion on any instrument is easier for me, as I know what it sounds like and what sound I want to duplicate.|`|5636ed341c138c06d26806f900d3d39eaa	reading notes|`|AA11127707	it depwnds on who you are .i know people that learned better by ear and some better by reading notes .|`|d4ab149492b7c8f20a8fde9f12c57caaaa	Use what works - I learned to play by finding tablature (uses numbers to indicate frets) and listening to the song to get an idea of how to strum.<br>  <br>  Since you don't have to learn reading music, tablature can be really easy to pick up.  It looks kind of like music notation (but there are six lines - one for each guitar string) and the number on the line tells you where to play.  So, to play the open A string you would see this:<br>  <br>  ---<br>  ---<br>  ---<br>  ---<br>  -0-<br>  ---<br>  <br>  To play the "C" note on the A string you would see this:<br>  <br>  ---<br>  ---<br>  ---<br>  ---<br>  -3-<br>  ---<br>  <br>  An open E chord looks like this:<br>  <br>  -0-<br>  -0-<br>  -1-<br>  -2-<br>  -2-<br>  -0-<br>  <br>  and a C major scale looks like this:<br>  <br>  <br>  --------------------------------------...<br>  --------------------------------------...<br>  -----------------2-4-5----------------...<br>  ---------2-3-5------------------------...<br>  --3--5--------------------------------...<br>  --------------------------------------...<br>  <br>  Simple rock songs are easiest to start out with - try some Green Day or Nirvana.
Lrg5KgKpaa	I don't think the Chili Peppers are imitating Prince or anyone else, it's just them giving props to influential rock musicians.

7sA8HwTzaa	It's impossible to predict what strangers will do, right?  It's scary, but I think you'll find that most schools have a few kids here and there who are always curious about the new kid and will buddy up to you right away.<br>  <br>  If no one does, you will have to take the first steps.  The easiest way to do this is to first determine the person or group that you would like to be with.  Then, ask a small favor like asking for the time or directions or for a tissue or something that you would never be turned down for asking.  People love to feel generous, even if it's at no cost and you will have made them feel that way.  It almost always pays off.<br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|L1DUcTtSaa	If they do there dumb.

2c06c70e0667ded65705faae5ad6886aaa	Not everybody likes gory stuff.  I watch rated R movies, but it doesn't mean they're gory.  Sometimes it's just because of language.  What religion were you?   <br>  <br>  <br>  Hey Branden, do you know the bible also has a story in it that says it's alright to get your father drunk and sleep with him so you can get pregnant and let his seed continue on?  <br>  <br>  And you hear that Christians "like those kinds of things"  we also like Whoppers from Burger King.  Is that ok?<br>  <br>  P.S. Using God as an excuse to judge others is worse then watching a rated R movie.|`|XctMTPisaa	Im a Christian and the bible has some of the most horrific stories of any historical book.  Genocide, Rape, Baby Killing, War, Burnings, Sacrifices, cannibalism, and I watch a lot of horror movies because I imagined a lot of these atrocities and compared them to the movies.  Im probably in the minority of all my friends, but who cares.  I do not have to fit in anywhere except my own skin.|`|6eee3c0b647347e08b85c17f1991c44eaa	Believe it or not. I'm the same way, I'm a Christian and I believe in non-violence. I wanted to tell you you're not alone. If you've read The Bible it says that violence is what evil follows. All of the people that are into those movies most likely aren't Christian. I'm not judging anyone here, I hear that Christians do like those kind of things, but that makes me wonder who many people do actually read The Bible?|`|Zjl9HRSTaa	If your not comfortable then your not comfortable. We all have our movie preferences maybe yours just isnt horror. If you wanna be okay with it just lighten up. It about being afraid, not knowing whats coming. Just try to get into the actual story and not so much the gruesomeness of it all. Focus on that and maybe you will feel a little better. You just think too much into it.|`|Otrwsauiaa	unless you were forced to watch a movie that goes against your morals - there is NO rule that says you have to . watch what you enjoy...with people who enjoy it too!  be courageous and BE YOURSELF!  <br>  <br>  you can start or join a MEETUP group [meetup.com] to find others who have similar tastes. meetup.com is international and has many free groups for every topic under the sun! go check it out.<br>  <br>  here's just a sample:<br>  <a href="http://www.meetup.com/search/?keywords=family+movies&country=us&locationPickerRef=0&dbCo=&dbOutsideUsLink=&zip=60606&submitButton=Search" rel="nofollow">http://www.meetup.com/search/?keywords=f...</a><br>  <br>  have fun!|`|FQwNi3kMaa	why be like everybody else?|`|FSikubhqaa	It takes time to find anything you're comfortable with.

It's not exactly about the pleasure of murder or gore, though for me it's the gore, lol. Like zombie movies, I love them! And any cheesy 80s horror, or a cheesy title. <br>  So...to be like everyone else is not the reason to do something, you know that. And whether it's based on religion or not, don't worry, you'll find something. <br>  Btw, I'm not all that religious as once, but the movies "The Exorcist" and "The Exorcism of Emily Rose" scare the sh*t out of me!|`|PIVKGi2Eaa	i have a friend that is Mormon and she cant watch r rated movies there nothing big about r rated movies all it has is a little extra swearing maybe some nudity and blood that is all. some people just arent n to it i hav a friend who is a afraid of horror movies|`|7PRPZeBwaa	Its too late, you are a buzzkillington.<br>  <br>  a stick in the mud, a wet blanket.<br>  <br>  theres nothing you CAN do at this point,<br>  except bring the spirits of everyone else around you down.
AA11442722	Lots of ways to make a living playing music. You can play in an orchastra, be a member of a gigging band, write jingles and sound tracks, and so on. <br>  <br>  Even if you just limit yourself to what it's like being in a band, that changes with the band your in. The few bands I've been in that made enough money to pay the bills did have some things in common. <br>  <br>  We practiced at least 3 times a week, usually 4, sometimes 5 for months, sometimes a year or more before doing a gig. Then we practiced at least once a week if we were not gigging every night of the week. A busy week for a non-cover band is 3 to 5 gigs a week. You need at least 3 a week to hope to pay the bills and you almost need to get on as a bar band somewhere for that steady you can count on income. Cover bands play more often but for less money usually. So cover band musicians who do it for a living usually play 5 to 7 nights a week to make a living. <br>  <br>  Typically you make a buck or two on the side giving lessons, working a part time job, doing side work that you can find here and there, especially studio work. <br>  <br>  Your typical day is just that, not typical. Routine is the enemy of an artist in most cases. What time you get up depends on what time you went to bed and if you have any pressing reason to get up. If you have kids, or a spouse to get to work or something like that.  Other than that you get up in time to make it down to the music store if you need any gear for that nights show. For important gigs you make sure you get at least 5 or 6 hours of sleep.  The rest of the time sleep is often optional :)  Depending on your rig you need to be up in time to do a little maintence, change strings, tweak settings, things like that. <br>  <br>  Days your not gigging or practicing is usually days you write or work on some technique that you've always wanted to learn or rewrite a section of a tune or  whatever. You usually spend it with your instrument and if you have time your spouse and or kids. <br>  <br>  The gigs start late usually. You get there to support the opening acts if your the headliner or play late, or to play if your one of the opening groups. Then you wait around for the bar to close to get paid. Once your paid it's late, you've usually knocked a few back, your ole lady is either home asleep, blasted or impatient or a combination of all three LOL. You are generally not ready to sleep. Your still hyped from playing . You unload the gear, say farewell to the band. Wake up anybody living with you (unless your living with the rest of the band which is fairly commong) when you come in at 3 or 4 am usually lugging some gear if not all your gear. Then you wind down for a few hours, get some sleep around dawn if you can. By then the ringing in your ears has stopped. Unless you kept drinking when you got home your mostly sober. Those dawns can be some of the most beautiful in the world. Crisp morning air. Maybe a groupie snoozing off in the bedroom, maybe your ole lady and children waking up to share it with you, maybe just you, the smoke from your cig winding slowly up against the newborn sun. Pieces of the gig playing back in your mind. Maybe your on a bus heading for the next gig watching the sun come up and listening to the driver's snores. <br>  <br>  Thing is, you spend a lot of hours doing something you love. The rest of the days and nights are mostly yours to choose how to spend. Not a good trade if your a day person. A great one if your a night owl. <br>  <br>  I've never done jingle writing or the other ways to make a living off music but have talked to a few who have. Primarily they spend approximately 8 hours a day much like a day job. Then they switch modes and become the musician they really are and play the music that drew them into being a musician in the first place.|`|6eee3c0b647347e08b85c17f1991c44eaa	I don't make a living doing it, I just practice it. Four hours a day on guitar until I can find work. Would I consider playing on the streets? Possibly, considering I feel I play better than most people. Do I want to do it for a job? Yeah, I want to be some sort of teacher, public or personal teacher. Anything to get music theory across, what most people are missing out on, would make me feel better about myself. I still have a long way to go. I'm probably not helping you. I just thought I'd share.

I am the music man international! I can hear a pin drop across the atlantic ocean, and I can hear people having sex in the Nevada hotels near vegas. I feel the world through my vibrations of sound throughout the universe. So to answer your question. Yes, I've heard your song.

7G0IyCltaa	That is like a dream come true.  For just one example, you're about to have an orgasm, but you don't want to yet.  You want to continue with all the fun.  Instead of having to say, stop for a moment, the psychic will already know and have already stopped.  Then, he'll know exactly when to start up again.  He'll also know exactly when you should come.<br>  <br>  Alas, I'm realistic, so I know how to use my mouth.... (ok... pun optional).|`|RluCMVUSaa	Pros:<br>  -When you are thinking I wish he/she would ________ they know and do it.<br>  -They already know you plan on leaving when this is over and are okay with it.<br>  -They are not surprised by your kinky request and are hopefully well prepared for it.<br>  <br>  Cons:<br>  -Lying about performance is wasting words.<br>  -No private intentions or surprise.|`|4zuTkXW2aa	What kind of psychic -- there are plenty of claimed psychic gifts.  Does he see visions, hear voices, know the future?  <br>  I'd say the con would be : CREEPY<br>  and the pro would be : they'd know if it was going to go poorly and already have their exit strategy planned.|`|ba4R1tf1aa	I knew you were going to ask that question...|`|H9gmJYdmaa	Pro: she would know if you're going to to good or not, so by her having sex with you, you must be decent - or she's desperate.<br>  Con: She'll know if you are going to stalk her the next day.|`|8mchLCQhaa	Pros~ She already knows the outcome<br>  Con~ She already knows the outcome!|`|OXleDYVQaa	Um isn't a physic, kinda supposed to make it easier to go  # 2? How the heck could that be good during sex?<br>  <br>  OOOPS, I think I misread this. I can't read minds ya know. Yowee.<br>  <br>  <br>  Dallas|`|LmARYQxcaa	Cons...she'll know all about you.<br>  Pros...if she's in bed with you the cons did not matter.|`|g2R7e2eVaa	Pros ?<br>  Cons - She would know if you were thinking of another woman while having sex with her.|`|DzIlM76Xaa	She would know before I even took off my pants she'd be faking it.|`|4wHjtkJXaa	pros they can read your mind so they know EXACTLY what to do.<br>  <br>  cons ?|`|nJOYHuyZaa	Con .he/ she would know how good or bad in bed you are already.|`|DKeut6FQaa	Good question....<br>  <br>  I guess you could call this a pro & a con....the psychic would probably "see" that I'm a animal in the bed... I mean a real ANIMAL...I claw the bed sheets....flip over the mattress...I make hyena noises...I jump off the dresser like a monkey...and lick myself when its over like a kitty cat.|`|85c582fe8987bb7b007f47c2661768faaa	pros- shes having sex with you so she probably know that your good...<br>  cons- she'll know if you never call her again. <br>  <br>  LOL|`|2bKgIMSsaa	Pro: They know what you like without you having to tell them.<br>  Con: Nothing you do will surprise them.|`|hz7Ek1HKaa	She already knows what areas you're going to suck at so she'll be able to give you proactive advice!!|`|rpdJ37Hoaa	You must be good in bed, otherwise they wouldnt have gotten in in the first place!|`|zoe733NJaa	pro - he/she will know what you want<br>  <br>  con - he/she will know that you'll fake it anyways|`|HF1TfsnTaa	She'll know whats coming.|`|0p9wHjSWaa	Pros- They can see the future, and they probably know what sex with you would be like BEFORE they did it.  Seeings as how they went through with it, that means you were at least semi decent.<br>  <br>  <br>  Cons- They will know you're dodging their calls afterwards.|`|9qUnD0sBaa	Pros..they can know what works before it happens.<br>  <br>  Cons..don't mess around or your aura will give you away.

The goblins attack and Irene must rely on her own magic to save Curty, and in turn the entire kingdom.|`|JWQurnK6aa	if you know who made the movie- Disney, DreamWorks...<br>  you can write at goolge "all Disney movies" and look for the movie or look for the date you think it was populer.<br>  <br>  Plus, you can ask your friend's who saw the movie.<br>  <br>  hope i helped,<br>  Omer|`|97c7897e3a3e02613ea1f017845e7ac4aa	Thumblina?|`|CEKZsoFRaa	sorry, not a clue|`|lGSUToFQaa	well you already got it, the princess and the goblin|`|vOomJtbsaa	I googled it for you, this is all I could come up with.

elLgFNkiaa	this question is so great! lol<br>  I LOVE nine inch nails.<br>  and that is just of really recently.<br>  Watch this youtube video.<br>  It speaks a HUGE amount about their Trent Reznors creativity.  He designs the lights and everything for every show.  If you dont want to watch the whole thing, start watching at like 3 minutes and 55 seconds... its AMAZING =]<br>  <br>  Not only that, he is an amazing artist overall.. his musical abilities are phenominal and he is just an incredible musician.  His style and technique is very well trained but his music is SO different from everyone elses.<br>  <br>  Favorite songs:<br>  Hand that feeds.<br>  Beside you in time<br>  with teeth|`|By226Cp0aa	i love the with teeth album the most. and **** you like an animal is my favorite song. but i think its more the rockabilly,goth, a punk cultures that listen to them most. i personally am a huge fan i like them for the industrial sound that they carry. and asking that is like asking why do people like tool|`|D8sN8gNFaa	I think you need to work on your attention span. They have a great following, because their or should I say "Trent's" strikes a cord with a lot of people.<br>  <br>  favorites:<br>  <br>  Pilgrimage<br>  Big Man With A Gun<br>  Wish<br>  Mr Self Destruct<br>  The Perfect Drug<br>  Somewhat Damaged<br>  The Way Out Is Through<br>  Ringfinger<br>  Down In It<br>  My Violent Heart<br>  Ripe (With Decay)<br>  Reptile|`|sORJIVlXaa	In a sense they are instumental but really it is a personal preference. I for one respect Trent Reznor and his accomplishments as a musician though I do not care for his particular style.<br>  <br>  Favorite NIN songs are<br>  Hurt<br>  Gone Still<br>  The Collector<br>  March of the pigs|`|m3eFscuqaa	They have a huge following because most people have horrid taste in music. That's it. Apply the same question to why people like The Jonas Brothers or Coldplay or Muse and you'll see how right I am.|`|R8fVBPnmaa	Well that just seems like you may need some appreciation for instumentals !?! Like classical music or even JAZZ !!.. I've never known or,seen or heard of said band,group or what`have you !?!.  rRr        <NIN> ??  does it stand for a certain something ?.  r'`R`'r|`|e9dHHGCSaa	Because they've been around for a long time, and many people look up to Trent Reznor as a role model/hero/idol. Plus, their music is really, really good.|`|WKpiqj4baa	I like the super mario bros. remix of Closer. And I guess people like it because it's good music to vent by? We live in angry times, my friend.|`|Zxl8oyIraa	Well the instrumentals are where they show their creativity, which is why everyone likes them as much as they do. u may just in fact have a horrible attention span. A song u may enjoy: The Hand That Feeds.<br>  <br>  They also have an immense respect for their fans|`|rIFqv8nvaa	Blah. First off hes a ******* janitor. Secondly hes a hack. Playing every instrument half a$$ dosent make you good. Trent reznor is a loser. There only good song wasnt even good until the late great Johnny Cash covered it. (hurt)|`|OLCoFKQraa	How can something be too instrumental?<br>  I guess everyone likes them because nobody else sounds like NIN, they're fantastic.<br>  My favorite song is  'We're in this together now'|`|YB9hxefFaa	I know what you mean.

Gang rape is a known action, but what people don't know about is Nexus Rape.<br>  Nexus rape happens rarely, but its an incident where the rape victim becomes the rapist, and the rapist becomes the rape victim. It is a very rare happening, but when it happens, other people come in and it becomes a gang rape. Gang rapes have been known to cure Alzheimers, arthritis, and super colds.

LBovv7Sxaa	bad bad bad.<br>  <br>  i think the Losties will have to defy the rules, change history, and stop Ben from initiating the Purge.<br>  that's why Ben is always trying to kill Locke because he knows Locke will play a huge part in stopping the Purge from happening.|`|LpVPdBLlaa	that's the question on everyone's minds, you see him constantly telling our guys that he'll help him than he kills or manipulates them. So one moment you think, wow maybe he's not that bad at all, the next minute he odes something that make's you go What the..? Why did you do that, thought you were helping them? He not only fools the oceanic six and the others but the viewers as well. I can't say he's just "good" or "bad" but what I can say is that it doesn't matter how it'll effect others as long as it's for his own good, guess that makes him kinda bad|`|Rm1zxWQmaa	I think he is in the middle.

LUIB0LzMaa	Amazing<br>  and you asked amazing series of questions. I always love to answer your questions.|`|lrDweZx5aa	Love feels like you have something that keeps most of the rain off you. If rain is something really bad then it's like the person you love is holding out an umbrella and you step under it and protect each other and then suddenly the bad thing isn't so hard to get through. Love is when your heart is filled to the brim with warmth and when you're away from the person you love it's like you take some of them and they take some of you. You never really feel alone because you know that person will never leave you. <br>  Love feels like suddenly you put on a pair of glasses and everything is much clearer and brighter. It makes you see beauty in the smallest things and helps you look forward to the future. <br>  For me that's what love is like :) I don't know if it's true love but it's certainly love. My partner is like my own personal little sun that clears up the cloudy days. His friendship, support and protection is the most valuable thing i own.actually,love is the best and the WORST feeling in the entire world. when you are in love with someone you think about them CONSTANTLY. and i mean CONSTANTLYYYY. all the time, sometimes its like subconcious you dont even realise you've just thought about them for hourrrrsssssss.<br>  when they call or text you you get sooo excited, and if you think its them and when its someone else youre really upset. <br>  its almost this heavy feeling in your stomach all the time. the smallest thing they do can make you soooooo happy, or sooooooo upset. you care about them more than anythingggg, and you would do anything just to make them happy. <br>  realllll true love is almost like a drug. it takes over you, and makes you act really silly sometimes. doing things you would normally do (being paranoid when it comes to them, staying up late to see if they call etc.)<br>  love can hurt more than anything. a broken heart has bad me bed ridden for weeks. <br>  the feeling youre thinking of right now isnt even HALF of what it really feels like. ive tried the best i can to describe it, but theres probably more i could say maybe you get the slight idea. just times whatever youre thinking by like ONE MILLION.|`|VxsjMmAMaa	i know, but u tell... u can tell me.|`|eCs32xBTaa	No, u tell me !|`|ZLwbmUr9aa	I know exactly what it feels like :D|`|FFF4BkQSaa	yes<br>  ya<br>  its too beautiful moment in our life|`|8j70Neqeaa	a used condom.|`|e22d86889cb88baa6ecf401b1f6a584caa	ecstasy.

There are many different styles to playing the guitar.  There are a lot of songs that are just a few chords put together, a great number.  Three chords in a chord progression on a 12 bar blues format is a very typical song style.  Other songs have rhythm and lead player.  If you want to be a rhythm player, you want to learn chords.  If you want to play lead, learn classic riffs and work on modes and scales.<br>  <br>  Suggestions for you to learn:<br>  <br>  Clapton, anything Clapton.  Clapton is said to have been one of the Gods of the guitar.<br>  <br>  Muddy Waters.  This will teach you how blues patters work.  Most Muddy Waters songs use the blues box.  This is a type of scale.<br>  <br>  Wish you Where Here by Pink Floyd is simple to learn.

q4XUy0Duaa	Anyone can say it if they want since there is freedom of speech in this country.  Not everyone can get away with it though.  Eminem would never dare say it, because he knows he is white, and he knows it might cause controversy and ultimately lead to a decrease in his record sales.  Ill Bill (also a white emcee), on the other hand, says it all of the time in his raps and he collaborates with well known, respected black rappers.  But Ill Bill is the type of guy who would punch you in your face if you even thought of calling him a racist, so people don't.  I always felt like it was obvious if you were using the word as a racial slur or if it was a term of endearment like callin' someone "my n*gga."  You should feel free to say it if you want, but if you feel like you might offend your friends then you shouldn't.  However, the sensitive people who are offended by the word are paying a bit too much attention to racial awareness and political correctness if you ask me, and they are more likely to be the racist ones if they're paying so much attention to the word and the fact that YOU"RE white and YOU'RE saying it.  If the word is wrong, then no one should use it, and not just some.  If you were to say it freely to blacks and whites, then you are most likely not racist since you're not even paying attention to people's race or the fact that the word may be offensive to some, but not others.  It all boils down to the fact that there was slavery in this country at one point in time.  There was also a great deal of racism in this country and there still is.  However there is a double standard when it comes to racial slurs.  If you look at comedy for example, Michael Richards was crucified for using the N word at one show, but I have yet to see a Chris Rock performance where he doesn't use the word cracker repeatedly (in an offensive way mind you) and no one seems to care.  In fact, everyone finds it funny.  Does this mean black people are more sensitive? NO.  It just means there is a double standard in this country, and it will take centuries before we see a change.|`|u7jpAPLDaa	Gotta agree with frumdamentalz on that answer. A double standard persists in a country, which is stems from the "white guilt" casued by the slavery period as well as other white racial discrimination that has occured in history.<br>  <br>  Ill Bill is able to get away with it due to how he presents himself and who his target audience is.<br>  <br>  Eminem appeals to a wider audience and therefore has to be more careful about using the word.<br>  <br>  It is argued that Puerto Ricans are allowed to use the term. Big Pun used the term on several occasions without any attention being drawn on it. Whilst J-Lo, also Puerto Rican, caused a racial slur, when using the term in "I'm Real".<br>  <br>  The double standard persists and is likely to continue for a while.

ZyGyDLsDaa	Yes, Edward kills someone: Jim, when he attacks Edward and Kim. The girl covers up for Edward, knowing what happened was because he was trying to protect her. It's simply that Edwards' hands are weapons, and he could not avoid killing the youth.<br>  <br>  Here's some backup from Wikipedia's plot summary:<br>  Kim heads to the mansion before the mob can get there and reunites with Edward. Jim follows them and attacks both, but is eventually killed by Edward. Kim professes her love for Edward and convinces the mob that Edward and Jim killed each other in the fight. All the neighbors return to their homes, while Joyce is seen guilty and ashamed for making up the rumor about Edward.|`|w2Dui70Faa	Yes.

sK4S86piaa	Was Thomas his middle name? All i know is that he is a witty British lad with a model figure. I think he is very charming and handsome too! But i love him better than the character he portrays in twilight. To girls out there, robert is real and edward cullen just exists on ink. That's the fact. It doesn't really matter though but i see a lot of talent and charisma in robert. I love his accent! I have this interview of him with a bubbly lady..i think he likes her and he's doing that 'dazzling' move..just watch it<br>  <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jujimDOqHqE" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jujimDOqH...</a>|`|m1ousrYMaa	i think he is, Who gives a ****,,|`|2c06c70e0667ded65705faae5ad6886aaa	You might as well be asking  if people know who Santa Claus is.|`|aPGPbbz7aa	err .. i don't see him as an Edward Cullen >< i see him as a Cedric Diggory T___T sadly.

AA10151168	As I know, it is based on a real event..It tells it in the end of the movie..|`|Npi4QR7Maa	The director claims that its based on true events but its really based on the killings of Ed Gein, who killed his victims in a similar fashion in the texas chainsaw but without a chainsaw. He was convicted of only 2 murders but, after his home was explored, they found the remains of over 200 bodies that were either decomposing under his house, made into clothing or had their skeletons used as decorations.<br>  <br>  So yeah, loosly based on real events|`|UXUKwJSwaa	It was based on Ed Gein, because he took the skin of his victims (even though I think he was only convicted of one actual murder) and wore it (and put it on other household objects). Chainsaw part? That was fiction, along with the rest of the story.|`|GZnOE7oXaa	The Texas Chain Saw Massacre was based loosely on the murders committed by 1950s Wisconsin serial killer Ed Gein.|`|gkThLcf2aa	Ed gein and his exploits. He made masks, furniture, bowls and plates etc. from the corpses of recently deceased women. He also kept a box of noses under his bed. Look him up on google or wiki|`|l2XtZlPUaa	Well it was based on the Texas Chainsaw Massacre, similar to yours, just that they got the spelling for Massacre correct.|`|ANLbWyMeaa	I want to say Ed Gein, but I may be thinking of another movie.  Either way, it's LOOSELY based on a real life event (though I've sure the real person (people) were pretty sick as well.<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  Wow, the link the poster before me has a lot of info.  I guess that's why I thought Ed Gein was the basis of another movie (Silence of the Lambs).  I've seen a movie based on the actual life of Gein.  I just don't remember the name of it.|`|FSikubhqaa	<a href="http://www.chasingthefrog.com/reelfaces/texaschainsaw.php" rel="nofollow">http://www.chasingthefrog.com/reelfaces/...</a><br>  <br>  crazy, eh?|`|m3eFscuqaa	Ed Gein

w4JAmla3aa	For the most part, your bow stick will be slightly more tilted away from you than your hair.  If you want a more focused sound (and a little louder), you would play with perfectly flat hair.  Violinists almost never do that, but violists do tend to play more with flat hair.  Experiment with the sound because as you get more advanced, you will be wanting to vary the amount of tilt based on what sound you are wanting to achieve.  You should never let the bow stick tilt towards yourself.  Often the tilt of the bow stick is a factor of what you are doing with your wrist (and thumb--it should always be bent because it is your shock absorber and therefore needs flexibility).  I have found that when the wrist is below the level of the bow stick and the hand, the sound is a bit less controlled.  Conversely, the wrist too far above the hand is also less controlled in a different way.  If the thumb and the pinky on the bow are bent, then there should basically be one unbroken line from finger base knuckles, through the top of the hand, along the wrist, through the forearm and the elbow, as if you could lay a piece of paper on there at the G-string level and it would be perfectly flat.|`|E6tZceP1aa	Both of these posters have it right.  I just wanted to add that by watching different instrument you will confuse yourself.  Since the angle of cellos and basses is different from the players perspective, the bow hold and the angles work differently.  Cellos and Basses have to work harder for good projection, so they tilt the bow differently.  When you have a technique question specific to your instrument, make sure that you only reference that instrument!|`|CrAwmz65aa	To play soft, tilt.<br>  To play loud, hold the bow flat.<br>  <br>  Each bowhair has microscopic tentacles.<br>  Each tentacle which comes in contact with the string flips against that string.<br>  When you draw the bow across the string, then, you are in effect playing a series of rapid pizzicato notes.<br>  The more flips you get, the louder the sound.<br>  Therefore, the more bowhairs you lay on the string, the louder the sound.<br>  <br>  That also explains why drawing the bow quickly creates a louder sound.<br>  It also explains why pressing the bow down harder creates a louder sound.|`|AA11294714	Either flat or slightly tilted away from you (towards the scroll), but NEVER tilted towards you.

Nothing fazes Libra, including Sag’s quick changes, because Libra likes new challenges too. They both love solving puzzles, riddles, and mysteries.

There may be some rough spots between them, but life with these two is always interesting and fun! :D xxx|`|gmVX2nZnaa	Yep.<br>  <br>  Libra is a air sign. <br>  They are most compatible with other air signs: Geminis and Aquarius<br>  They are also secondly most compatible with fire signs: Sagittarius & Leos.|`|cyRDKRIDaa	I'll answer this only because my ascendant is in Libra, and it tends to show itself too often.<br>  <br>  The physical attraction was there for me, and it was strong. I don't know about the actual -intellect- of the Sagittarius, but I enjoyed his body. That was for sure. I couldn't stand how awful his idea of loyalty was though, and how he would flirt with seven different girls in one day, whilst having a girlfriend. It really bothered me, and he had such an ego too.|`|t8HPCzrOaa	hey hun am a sagittarius and my bf is a libra we get along very good but sagittarius pplz can be ignorant and libra pplz sometimes cant put up with it so yea loll but me and my bf aree great i love him so much even thou we aruge alott am not sure bout sagittarius man as am a sagittarius gir so yea but it doesnt matter your sign of what you are once you love the person that all that matterrs but good luck hun

0l88fiUTaa	dreaming is awesome!

I tend to stay up all night and sleep all day which really messes up my schedule because I have a husband that would like to spend some day time hours with me.  I have taken several different types of sleeping pills ( I don't like drugs, even prescribed ones) and nothing seems to work. I see a therapist and even after a year and a half we still haven't accomplished much in the way of getting me through sleep at night without bad dreams.  Thanks for allowing me to vent.  I just leave everything to God now, and May God Bless You and Your Family Also!|`|n662efY5aa	It's good...it's how we connect with our unconcious mind. We realize things we didn't know were bugging us when we dream. Dreams also help renew your brain. We get rid of useless info when we dream, or forget, by wearing down the nerve connections to that memory so that we can learn new things in the morning.|`|NZg4hIrYaa	Surely it's good for you to release the daily life stress.  you believe or not, each dreams have some special hints behind and probably a message from god.|`|e8J0wgcKaa	There is nothing wrong with dreaming dreaming gives you hope and that's what people need to strive for success|`|sxk08R2caa	dreams are good, they exercise the mind|`|gC98RlU3aa	it depends on what the dream is, but mostly i think good|`|DUjr9tNUaa	good.|`|votSNHgJaa	I think it's good. It helps us think beyond what we know and believe in. :)|`|5GW5xGCwaa	Dreaming is good for three reasons.  Scary dreams, even though they are bad are okay because they aren't real and you can wake yourself up out of a horrible dream and realize life isn't such a nightmare compared to that nightmare you just had.  Sometimes I have rad vivid sex dreams which are wild and fun.  And not dreaming has been shown to cause hallucinations in sleep studies and I'm all about not hallucinating when I haven't taken drugs.|`|SmOefD5Raa	Dreaming is wonderful, especially if you learn lucid dreaming|`|j802U6gdaa	nightmare is bad<br>  dreaming is good<br>  sex dreams is better|`|OEsWGBpCaa	Dreaming is good for the mind.<br>  Its like reccess.<br>  (:|`|BRv4Vgz1aa	Dreaming is good.|`|WM5EG9Tyaa	Nothing wrong with Dreaming ... it's good to have Dreams|`|RKxT3XiUaa	I think my dreaming is bad, I end up with really bad nightmares|`|FwJLD1uDaa	well it depends. i think people's dreams effect their lives more than they should sometimes - like with nightmares or really deep dreams or problems. i like that we dream. it gives me something to think about when i sleep lol|`|CEKZsoFRaa	They can be good or bad but I think they're great because I usually have feelings of deja'vu and things seem to work out right or come out a little clearer after I think about it.

IfbkuHZfaa	Do you realize what you have just done by asking that question? you may have just put the entire human species in peril because giving optimus prime such power as a green lantern ring would drive him insane to the point where to him humanity is no longer an option. you cant go around asking these kind of questions all willy nilly. you must take into consideration that optimus prime may be reading this right now and getting ideas.<br>  <br>  <br>  By the way im just messin with you in reality if optimus prime had a green lantern ring nothing would happen because the ring is powered by the owners imagination and willpower. optimus primes being a robot doesnt have any of those but im pretty sure he could still kick a butt or two with or without the rings power

dpYpY6qmaa	Hi, SleepySeaHorse,<br>  <br>  <br>  The first song I'd recommend is the theme from another John Carpenter film - The Thing.  It's slower-tempo than Halloween, but is definitely just as creepy and dark.  Here's a youtube for that one:<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e5d8PskcEAk" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e5d8PskcE...</a><br>  <br>  <br>  I'd also recommend Tubular Bells by Mike Oldfield.

That song is the result of the guitarist getting butt-hurt because he wanted to be the front man. That whole album is very disappointing to me comparitivly speaking to their previous two albums. The front man is Surg and he is the one that is supposed to be the lead singer/songwriter. Well their guitarist decided he wanted to sing and write songs too. The result is the pussified crap that they call Mesmorize. I love SOAD but the guitarist needs to learn his role and let the front man do his job/.|`|866076e99b1cf298d115af7f0275059baa	I think its funny because it says the most lonliest day of my life.

Jumanji is the older one where one of the children gets thrown into the game for something like 20 years and comes back when two other children play it. most of the stuff is based on a jungle with bats, lions, rhinos, and a hunter. the newer one is called Zathura. this one is about two brothers and a sister who play a game. it is based on a space theme where the house gets placed into orbit and they face such dangers as a meteor shower, alien invasions and they meet a stranded astronaut. both are great movies and i fully recommend them.|`|AA11414220	zathura is good too!!|`|a3165f21afe4267dadaf2b62a791ce5daa	I think ye've spelled it right, mate.... hold on I own it, let me check.....j-u-m-a-n-j-i- aye, that's it, ye've got it.

I would quit smoking tomorrow for a few thousand.  we actually have an unusual undertow around here, no one has survived it.  It warrants some tests with cameras, weighted dummy body.|`|7HEZhx46aa	First of all, it's "undertow" and yes I would because I know the key to successfully swimming out of one.|`|6027918631c23369df1bbcdecdf25f42aa	No, i can't use the million dollars if i die|`|02d239b19bc4b4c4dbd4fa2456e57db4aa	nope because not many people can survive that|`|9b01c318f96a419ddcf871a11a9201e2aa	do i look stupid to you?|`|ISPUBYpRaa	Depends on the strength and location of the undertow.

But, my friend and I would listen to Nelly and eminem a lot and those always make me smile. When I hear KC and jojo, I think of 9th grade dances and all the drama.

AA11039335	Let me see....<br>  <br>  Safe As Milk - Captain Beefheart & His Magic Band. [1967]<br>  <br>  I have the copy with the bonus songs on it, but I'm not going to do it as this is going to take long enough anyway. :P<br>  <br>  Trout Mask Replica was the first full album I listened to by Beefheart, and as much as a loved it, when I heard this it blew me away completely. A strange merge of blues and experimental, with notable African (/Eastern even?) influences, most obviously in Abba Zabba <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9sCDkBVZSI" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9sCDkBVZ...</a> , one of my favourite tracks from the album, the beat is so, ahhh, wonderful!<br>  <br>  Anyway, I'll go through my favourites first. :P<br>  Zig Zag Wanderer - <br>  <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PD4-O8LfwZY&feature=related" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PD4-O8Lfw...</a><br>  It's really got that quintessential 60's vibe to it, with the melody and the backing vocals especially, but then you have a completely original, gruff voice, which adds a spectacular and totally unique quality to it. <br>  <br>  Plastic Factory <br>  <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zkOENTkk-9w" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zkOENTkk-...</a><br>  It's so bluesy! And you've got the harmonica, and hmm, well seeing as there's no technical term for it, you know that part at 2:50, yeah, haha, I love that.<br>  <br>  Autumn's Child. <br>  <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LSlM0IOXt6o" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LSlM0IOXt...</a><br>  Oh wow.. Quite possible my favourite song on the entire album.. It's quite indescribable for me, it's the vocals [when Vliet's singing on his own, that is, not the 'go back ten years ago'..]; so, passionate and soulful, even stressed in parts, but in a really good way.. And the kind of outer space instrumentals while he's singing, hahaha, so magical, so beautiful. I love the various other parts to the songs though, too. <br>  <br>  Right now, for the rest of the songs [which I love too, but the aforementioned just have a certain special quality to them moreso than these]<br>  Call On Me - <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p2fsnklbQhw" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p2fsnklbQ...</a><br>  It's the melody, fantastic melody and guitar. <br>  <br>  Dropout Boogie<br>  <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vLT6TdEWqI" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vLT6TdEW...</a> Ooh, so gruff and harsh! And the music is even a lot 'harsher' than in the rest of the album, very nice!<br>  <br>  Electricity<br>  <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0s2tr6mb5ug" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0s2tr6mb5...</a><br>  I think is the most talked about track on the album, and yeah, I can definitely understand why, hahaha. It is quite out there, in typical and wonderful Beefhearty glory.<br>  <br>  Yellow Brick Road<br>  <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mz3WJ1l1dNM&feature=related" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mz3WJ1l1d...</a><br>  Despite being a really good song, it's still one of my least favourites on the album; I do love the chorus though..<br>  <br>  Where There's Woman<br>  <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=StCLRIkFV9c" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=StCLRIkFV...</a><br>  Ohhh, how I do love it. An Eastern influence is pretty evident here [in my opinion], and mixed with jazzy drums and a watery bassline; then sudden outbursts of 'where there's woman!!!', great track. <br>  <br>  Grown So Ugly<br>  <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G2wtHYyERls" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G2wtHYyER...</a><br>  Yeah, again not one of my favourites, but I still really like it. >< It's impossible not to love every song on this album! But I love the guitar, arguably some of the best guitar work on the album.<br>  <br>  Anyway! Sorry if I went on a bit, good question! :)<br>  <br>  Rating: 9 3/4 out of 10. :P|`|dpByFZrGaa	Hmmm... I'm not great at reviewing... but the only whole album I really love right now is Blood Bank by Bon Iver.  <br>  With some of his songs on there like Babys and Woods he explored new ideas!  It was really cool listening to Woods, because although it only has 4 words as the lyrics, repeating over and over the song is actually very beautiful and tells a story.  I rate this album 9/10. I was actually very disappointed that iTunes only had 4 songs from the album available, there's more to be seen!  But overall, a great album|`|L4jMOVvPaa	Lamb of god - Ashes of the wake<br>  <br>  To my pesonel tastes it the best album they hav ever produced. Laid to rest is an absolute killer of a song. When i seen them live the played that second. Hourglass is an amazing song. they have given that song justice and im goin to play that song all my life! Now you've got something to die for is one of the heiviest songs on the album. An unimagine-able song live. Its rather stop the moshing and stand there and headbang till your head drops off! Omerta has alot of feeling to it. As im low on time al skip to the second last song on the album Ashes of the wake. its an instramental but its up there with the best instramentals in metal. and finaly my favorite lamb of god song Remorse is for the dead. WOW!!!! get that song through the loudest speekers you hav and cramp it all the way up!! i dont care if anybody get arrested doin this as its the best mother ***** son you will ever hear!! its got so much METAL!!!!!!!<br>  <br>  i hope that you like this review as its my first.|`|Ih1YIe65aa	i'm going to talk about papercuts' and their ablum "can't go back"<br>  i'm not sure if you, personally, would like this album, because it is mainly pop and not very noisy, but i love it.  I have been closely studying the world of indie music for a few years now.  i have done countless hours of research, all while knowing i can never hear and know every indie band.  If i had to make a thesis based on the reseasrch i've done, it would be:  90% of "indie" bands are not worth listening to.  shockingly enough, the indie music scene is shaped more by publicity than any other music scene, it is kind of sickening to see.  most artists get by with the same basic set up, some guitars, drums, singing, and the same writing process, get a hook, get a single, get some filler, got an album.  not a lot of interesting things come out, it is all dreadfully boring and after a couple months, most people become aware of this and latch on to the next thing being shoved in their ears.  im not saying artistic integrity doesnt exist among independent musicians, im just saying it has become kind of rare.<br>  but you probably know all that already<br>  this album is filled with nice hooks, which is probably the best thing about it.  this man understands his chord progressions.  but it is also an emotional recording.  it does not lose anything to a big studio, it has a lo-fi sound, which keeps it from blending in with every other album floating around right now.  compositionally, this is one of the most surprising albums i have ever heard.  i never expected these types of arrangements from an artist who is not very popular at all.  this album might not be as great as i think, but it is much better than its "under the radar" status. every time he says "oooooo JOHN brown, if you go, downtown now" my heart jumps and every time he says "can you wait all summer long?" my heart sinks.  it is a very physiologically pleasing album.
7B2s7maWaa	Will you settle for honest and truthful?<br>  <br>  Hope so, because let me tell you you might get a touch of crazy,but creative uh I'll do my best.<br>  <br>  Okay wow this song was very cool. Lol it reminded me of things you would hear on a spaceship or some kind of paranormal activity.  Very cool song though.  A perfect mesh of different unique sounds creating one hell of a noise song.  Just a very nice post.  Thank you for posting and sharing Likegibb! :)|`|Hck22n9Faa	I kept on having "visions" of Ken Kesey's One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest. In the beginning it was the scene where they go into the machinery hell at night and the end just reminded me of Nurse Racthed's anger. <br>  <br>  I also felt as if that would be what I'd hear if my computer ever attacked me. <br>  <br>  And, for some reason I liked it.

LehwOrSIaa	No, don't trade it in for a new guitar. That strat could easily pull off metal with the right amp and maybe a pickup swap. But if you want to play metal, the amp you use has 8945703485x more importance than the guitar you use.<br>  <br>  I can't even begin to say how many players I've come across with a Strat/Tele or whatever and say "I wanna get this hXc br00t4lz guitar to play metal with!!1!!" when they don't realize their amp is the problem.<br>  <br>  tl;dr - get a new amp, keep the strat|`|RzTb60Ufaa	It's actually kinda hard to look into Guitar Center's perspective, really.

If it makes you feel any better, I saw plenty of people in attendance that were clearly much older than I am.

I'm 17 and if I had the opportunity to see some kind of Folk concert I would definitely do that (I'm a huge fan of folk music! :D haha)<br>  <br>  Concerts are a place for people to let go of all there outside worries and issues and just listen to music and have a good time. So you shouldn't care if people think you are a "weirdo" or something. Go and have a great time! :D|`|59964d53fa7967029226eb0cf3c34609aa	Why would it be weird?

That's in Pittsburgh.<br>  <br>  I've also gone to seen British Sea Power in Cleveland, and Joan Osborne at Mr. Small's Theater here in Pittsburgh.<br>  <br>  They probably don't draw exactly the same type of crowd that Slipknot does, but Angelface ad I were definitely not representative of the norm there.<br>  <br>  Like we gave a rat's patootie.|`|cLTbby44aa	Shades, for the last time, GO TO THE CONCERT! <br>  <br>  To be honest, if my mom was half as cool as you when it comes to music, I'd be very happy (don't get me wrong, she's cool in many other aspects =D). <br>  <br>  I'm personally not a fan but I think it's great, and downright cool that you're even considering it. You've got some lucky kids :) <br>  <br>  Enjoy the concert, don't mind the rest of the crowd. Music knows no color, gender, age, etc..|`|qGDWbJKpaa	no your not weird.

I also have a keyboard that I can't really play yet.<br>  BQ5: Blue, since they're the colour of my own eyes.|`|yQH4Fpoiaa	Aww, this is a toughie. Out of ALL the members of Blur, I think I could survive if Dave Rowntree left.<br>  <br>  BQ1: I'm not really a guitarist, but probably a Les Paul.<br>  <br>  BQ2: Yes!

He's like the permanent session bassist for them, so I think he would make the least difference.|`|a1Ngi39Xaa	Well, when Page and Plant did the reunion thing, they didn't even ASK John Paul Jones to join them.  So I guess they didn't think he was important.  I would have loved to have seen him though.  Although Page and Plant together on the same stage, for me, was totally awesome!!<br>  <br>  BQ1:  Not a guitarist, but my buddy who is says Gibson for some things, Fender for others, but  B.C.

My Dad had the most beautiful blue eyes.|`|4bc3ee931fca2067bef8aafb614f2089aa	In that case D'arcy and James, but I think they were still important in some way. And I guess that would mean Jimmy wasn't important since Adore was an amazing album and he wasn't a part of it. But I don't think Billy would continue with the band without Jimmy for very long, so that makes him important.|`|nYqtw9DWaa	My favorite is The Beatles..

8rGZFBKOaa	VERY happy. I would have liked to have had an Idol's top 15, but sooner or later all but one will eventually have to go anyway. This year, whoever wins, it will be really, really close.|`|fQghpx3Zaa	I'm totally happy with Adam and Anoop! I love them both. Adam is insanely talented and Anoop seems like such a good guy, which a great voice!<br>  <br>  I'm not happy with a lot of them actually. Most of them.  Megan definitely has the least amount of talent of the top 13. She has no vocal range whatsoever. What Michael Jackson song can she do next week!? Come on, now! I also don't like Danny and Alexis. They're overrated. So is Lil but I just don't like her voice, her personality is okay though. I feel that Michael and Jorge took up two good spots. They really don't have a good chance to win Idol. - honestly. Scott is WAY overrated. His voice isn't all that great either. There were better singers, such as Ricky Braddy. I think a lot of people feel bad for Scott and just like his personality. I think he's a good guy but I can't see him winning. I adore Jasmine. She's the best girl there, IMO. But I think she'll be gone pretty soon. Allison is also extremely overrated. And her personality sucks. She acts like there's something wrong with her everytime someone asks her a question.|`|SMrG7A9laa	I totally agree with you! I think Megan is really overrated. I mean the judges say she's great for marketing, but I don't even see that for her. Kristin had more versatility with her voice, and is much better looking than Megan. Megan's tattoos scare me. Instead of Megan, I'd like Kristin  in her spot.|`|YIcBd569aa	yes I am happy with all of them but unlike you I especially like Megan her voice is unique and jazzy, but I like jazz music so maybe thats why I like her so much, she reminds me of maizy grey.|`|SatGmBHYaa	I didn't like Jasmine. Shes just another VTFW waiting to happen. I would have chosen anyone else to fill the spot. Otherwise, I am happy with the top 13.|`|m9PDC1Xsaa	No. I think the last round, that the judges made some mistakes on who they picked.|`|11mJ0RHhaa	Scott Macintyer<br>  Alison Iraheta<br>  Danny Gokey<br>  Adam Lambert<br>  <br>  Those are my favorites|`|7lZnHiYZaa	yesssss. <br>  i don't care for that michael guy very muchhh..<br>  but other than that i like everyonee. :)|`|5Pgs61ePaa	yes
h1yGVkkfaa	Yeah there not bad..Just started listening to them about 2-3days ago threw there myspace.<br>  Pretty good for electro/Grindcore experimental.|`|49ced8e9e4549860cfb81074554d48beaa	ehh they not bad, i heard em on myspace a few weekends back but they are a little too technical for me. but some bands that you may like are blotted science, earth crisis, engineer, converge, high on fire, dance club massacre, kylesa, bela kiss, heavy heavy low low and pig destroyer for metal/grindcore. for the more electrical stuff i'd say go with dance gavin dance, destroy the runner, emarosa, enter shikari, sky eats airplane.. id have to say my favorite song by them is folding chair, asleep on the forest floor or lake of virgins|`|OXvH2CgLaa	I've heard of them. Interesting original sound|`|Csx3ZXlmaa	To answer your question, no.<br>  <br>  It's a weird song. And not weird in the good way. It doesn't really appeal to me.
sV2lOgLxaa	"Accidentally" trip over his foot on your way to your locker, then giggle and say "sorry ;) is your foot ok?!"<br>  <br>  And the chicken came first|`|xEoVcQqMaa	Right first of all you cant tell wheather the chicken or the egg cam first. You need the chicken for the egg and without the egg there could never be a chicken! lol But if you believe in God then you would proberly say he created them!<br>  MOVING ON---------->>>>>><br>  I'm just being honest,not mean but i dont really think that boys two years older than you would really want to speak to someone two years below them. Imagine if a boy came up to you who was two years below you? You most likely wouldnt give them a second look? Or be interested! So thats how i would deal with it. <br>  Otherwise you could try talking to him like maybe "pretend" you dont know ur way around and just say "excuse me could you tell me where room 39 is"  Or something like that ;)|`|rKY4o3Adaa	Do u mean friend or u mean like woot woot friend? lol If you just want to be friend find something in common like if he plays xbox live games ask what his gamer tag is and fight him online. If you mean like woot woot friend i'm sorry  i don't know|`|OGQu0Eldaa	i asked about the chicken and the egg too and most responses were the egg came first and this dude im pretty sure he was a doctor cause he was using all these big terms and stuff and he said the egg came first|`|u5Msb7X3aa	The chicken........ where the hell would an egg come from without the chicken.  And if your wondering the exact opposite of my question. Well the answer would be God.|`|xPxm8ONiaa	When you catch him look your way, drop something, and if he picks it up, you guys can talk, if not, then i don't know :P|`|r3PgrJhDaa	I would first get his email/myspace, and talk to him there. Then when your friends enough, maybe start texting, then work yourself up to talking to him in person.|`|nWaKuh6iaa	obviously the egg =P|`|pnYR5IRAaa	just like when you see him give him a nod or whatever you boys doo,<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  oh and by the way.<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  chicken came first =]|`|q4bsmjVwaa	Chicken.|`|oXlDR7lsaa	MISLEADING TITLE|`|TLrdpzeYaa	i am confuzzled :S<br>  which question is which? :S|`|kS9ZtIFfaa	What....The....****<br>  <br>  I am also going to say that the Chicken came first through evolution, LOL|`|xsk9JWqpaa	uh...no it doesn't but i'll answer it anyway.

Ask anybody who is friends/knows him if he has a MySpace (or what have you), then try to find him and add him.<br>  <br>  Or if you have a class with him burst into random talking.|`|0ePwSnfWaa	i think it is egg because chicken couldn't be chicken before it was made as a chicken so some kind of other thing made the egg and a little chick came out of it and then it groves to be chicken|`|ufU0VNLUaa	The Egg but there wasn't supposed to be a chicken in it.

d02c709e184c7a1f7828d9e3e00c32b4aa	Clearly trying to make some sort of political or fashion statement but not sure exactly what the message was meant to be.  You'd think he could afford a few pairs of shoes once The Beatles got to the Abbey Road portion of their career.  <br>  <br>  Perhaps his bunions were inflamed that day.|`|a1Ngi39Xaa	I have no idea.  I read a little about the cover shoot - looks like it was completed in 10 minutes!!   So I doubt there was a lot of thought behind the barefoot issue...  The cover photograph was taken by photographer Iain Macmillan. Macmillan was given only ten minutes around 11:30 that morning to take the photo.<br>  <br>  I have a theory - "Mean Mr. Mustard" stole his shoes.... or when He "Came In Through The Bathroom Window", he wanted to be barefoot.  "Something" about "Polythene Pam" looks suspicious to me.  Maybe he was tiptoeing through the "Octopus's Garden"!  He was afraid "Maxwell's Silver Hammer" would come down upon his shoes??  Or maybe it was just "Because"...|`|NQnOw4Qbaa	I think that they were actively feeding the "Paul is dead" hoax, and denied it when it went viral. Supposedly his dress is how a corpse would be in a coffin.  Another clue is the license plate on the Volkswagen reads 28IF Which was supposed to mean that Paul would have been 28 if he were alive.|`|3g3SCnDDaa	I think it was largely symbolic and in line with the whole "Paul is Dead" myth that was circulating around during The Beatles' career. You see, it goes that Paul is dressed in a black suit, that which he is supposed to be buried in. He is also barefoot because I think that's how the British buried their dead at the time: without any shoes. At least, that's what I had heard. Also, in the front picture of the Abbey Road album there's a car whose license plate reads something like "28 if" or something along those lines, meaning that had Paul not died when he did he would have been 28 at the time. I also know George Harrison's clothes are supposed to resemble the guys who help fill in the hole after somebody has been buried. Hope this helps out, peace!|`|iIWWeD7Taa	1.  He had just finished banging Linda and didn't have time to find his shoes.<br>  <br>  2.  Yoko stole them in hopes of preventing Paul from being in the pic.<br>  <br>  3.  Ringo needed them because he was the brokest of the four.<br>  <br>  4.  He threw them at John when he realized that John was bogarting  "Give peace a Chance"|`|ecL0ZbfCaa	It was a very hot summers day in North London, he took his shoes off, I do it all the time!|`|48df0ea585c1658be36a46553408d993aa	It looks like a beautiful summer day.... :-)|`|INJSpV4haa	Funny this is so obscure to many people now, because it was a HUGE to-do back in 1970.<br>  <br>  For several years the Beatles and their managers fuled a rumor that Pauy McCartney had been killed in an auto accident. You can google this, and you will find numerous references on album covers and in songs to the mysterious death.<br>  <br>  The Anney Road album has several clues. One neing the photo in which the 4 lads are crossing the street. John, all in white, represents the minister; Ringo all in black represents the undertaker; Paul the corpse (based on an Italian tradition of burying dead people barefoot, or so the story went); and then George, in blue working clothes representing the grave digger.<br>  <br>  The car with the 28IF has already been mentioned, but also on the other side of the album if you look at the dots before the word BEATLES it looks like it says The 3 Beatles. Then the song "Come Together" at one point says: One and One and One is Three. Which was supposed to be another reference to just 3 Beatles.<br>  <br>  There's tons of more material. But try listening to A Day in the Life. The first verse is supposed to be an account of the accident that killed Paul. "He blew his mind out in a car, etc."|`|xhDdYnHTaa	There's been a lot of speculation surrounding the "Paul is Dead" rumor and how the Beatles were supposedly sending out clues in their songs and on their album covers that Paul had actually died in a car accident in 1966.  Paul had a pair of flip-flips on the day the Abbey Road cover was shot and apparently had decided just before shooting the picture to kick them off and go barefoot, that's all...|`|DnWsMhwLaa	well, george has harry hobbit feet, so paul suggested that everyone take of their shoes for the cover to make fun of george and his harry feet, but no one else wanted to, so paul just did it alone because he thought it would make him look stupid if he put his shoes back on.|`|Wj7mBxFJaa	I think it was just to make the picture interesting.  The same reason Lennon is wearing all white.<br>  does my lack of reading into the album cover make me in some way less of a Beatles fan?|`|mbprjCSiaa	hes the "dead man" beacuse of the paul is dead joke <a href="http://www.turnmeondeadman.net/IBP/AbbeyRoad.php" rel="nofollow">http://www.turnmeondeadman.net/IBP/Abbey...</a> (alot of info theres too much to write it has it all on there, its so cool)|`|qGDWbJKpaa	never really paid attention. I dont think it means anything really.  it might, but no one has really said anything it and the CD has been out for YEARS!|`|CzIaAnsraa	people read too much into things - the guy probably forgot his shoes|`|NKPNOwZuaa	I am guessing because it was hot one day and he decided to take off his shoes...OR it may have something to do with the whole Paul is Dead conspiracy...hmm... ahaha, yeah he's also the only one without facial hair...<br>  <br>  <br>  He says it was hot. And I imagine he shaved that beard because he was sick of the huge one he had during Let it Be. I would also like to add how pissed the drivers get when you stop traffic to pose for an Abbey Road shot. :)<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  He's out of step with the other three too. He's also holding a cigarette in his right hand even though he's left handed and the license plate on the VW bug says 28IF. Had Paul lived it would have been his 28th birthday.<br>  Just adding to the theory.|`|NlC3xaK8aa	It's a bit of amyth really. But at the timne, there was this whole 'affair' that Paul McCartney was really dead, and the myth was at the end of the song Strawberry Fields Forever, John Lennon whispered something, and that backwards, had the effect of something like 'Paul McCartney is dead, which her obviously isn't. Buts wierd though...<br>  Ems<br>  x|`|ETpkJII7aa	yeah, I always have understood that it was to fuel the fire that Paul was actually dead.
os6FaEBlaa	I wondered the same thing when I heard it too, I think Dre's lost some orignality but he samples a lot and to me that's not really original either.|`|HL8W9yU6aa	LMAO!!<br>  Dre drives around, singing along to, "Boo Boo Heads Boo Boo Heads, I want you dead" or "Mistadobollina"|`|8XT1Tvcvaa	Wow, all Eminem/Dre stans should listen to this song and see how much better Del rips this beat than their messiah. Good find.<br>  <br>  I mean, obviously this is just a case of using the same sample. Happens all the time. Considering how much hip hop there is out there.
3g3SCnDDaa	As much as I enjoy Aerosmith's music, I would have to disagree with your assertion that they are the greatest American rock band ever. Also, it is almost impossible to speculate as to who the greatest rock band is. Everyone has a favorite, and no one is ever going to agree on the matter. You're always going to have people who will say The Beatles are the best, that Nirvana is the best, Led Zeppelin, Queen, Radiohead, and so on. I'm willing to say that there are certain levels in rock music. Groups on par with bands such as Queen, The Beatles and Bob Dylan would make up the highest bit, with bands like MCR living not on the bottom level, but in the basement under the bottom level. Groups like Black Sabbath, Foghat, and The Animals would make up the middle levels. Hopefully that makes sense. Peace!|`|REb0XRgRaa	i think so, there are a lot of people who will disagree with this next statement:<br>  <br>  aerosmith is timeless, their hits  are great no matter what day it is and what time it is<br>  <br>  i know there are other bands like this but this is why I love aerosmith<br>  <br>  i have like 70 songs on my ipod not exaggerating|`|rFBypeEfaa	From the same era even, I would say that the Blue Oyster Cult and Alice Cooper are far better.<br>  <br>  Rocks and Toys in the Attic are excellent albums, though...|`|YbmklSzGaa	I think Grand Funk Railroad is.<br>  <br>  Or perhaps The Velvet Underground.<br>  <br>  Maybe even Wall of Voodoo.<br>  <br>  Either of those.|`|rIFqv8nvaa	No, Chickenfoot's debut album will be out soon.<br>  Guitar: Joe Satriani<br>  Vocals: Sammy Hagar<br>  Bass: Michael Anthony (van halen)<br>  <br>  This should blow aerosmiths ballad junk outta the water.|`|Wj7mBxFJaa	No I wouldn't say so, I'm not a huge fan.  I'd say...<br>  The Velvet Underground<br>  <br>  They're considered by many to be the second most influential band of the sixties (first being the Beatles naturally)|`|yxVS1SSzaa	Nirvana, Ramones, Pixies, Pearl Jam, Allman Bros., Iggy and Stooges, grateful dead, chili peppers, cream, doors<br>  STOP GIVING ME THUMBS DOWN YOU MORONS|`|cU7NNfhSaa	Yey they are!!! and peopel who say Nirvana are wrong they are overrated|`|9E9h5WWwaa	Nirvana..|`|d29f5682f080f113ebb06c1d1e8e6cc9aa	I'd say Boston is, but that is my opinion|`|6LcHJbHjaa	No, Led Zeppelin is.<br>  <br>  Oh, sorry i forgot, i guess The Doors are.|`|2i6TPlauaa	No, no, no, no, no! Not even close. Maybe if it is on the superficial side of things.<br>  <br>  The Velvet Underground<br>  Talking Heads<br>  Pixies<br>  Television<br>  Ramones...<br>  ...and many, many others come to my mind.
PF6yKkVDaa	Carcass, Terrorizer, Excruciating Terror, Napalm Death, Nasum, Regurgitate, and so on. I consider all those bands grindcore. I don't know how someone listened to JFAC and decided that's what grindcore is. It had been around about 20 years before then.|`|ad5gMHlgaa	Maybe JFAC.<br>  But i think they are all just death core.<br>  Suicide silence is hard, but not grindcore hard.<br>  And Bmth has lowered their level of intensity<br>  With suicide season.<br>  <br>  Grindcore is more like<br>  Arsonist get all the girls.|`|RCLVr0Evaa	they are miscategorized 100%.  they share very little musically with napalm death or carcass.<br>  <br>  not to mention JFAC dresses like emo queers|`|IHMaODXuaa	Napalm Death, AxCx, etc.<br>  <br>  MQ: Job For A Cowboy|`|RzTb60Ufaa	Napalm Death, Pig Destroyer, Nasum, See You Next Tuesday, Anal C*nt, yeah... I'm not that major on grindcore.|`|ULiRab7Yaa	dying fetus is also grindcore<br>  dont really listen to gridncore but i listen to them|`|Z5mmaFK0aa	Hey Tron<br>  <br>  Yeah Napalm Death are probably one of the Fathers of the genre I believe its one of the band members that came up with the name of the genre Grindcore.<br>  <br>  I like them Barny is a legend.<br>  <br>  There are a couple bands that I listen to here and there not much tho<br>  <br>  F*ck The Facts - and - Dahmer. <br>  <br>  And yes of course early Carcass great stuff from them as well|`|QhJ8YiLhaa	Yeah, I agree with you on your first couple of bands. The second list there, I think those three go into those obscure "core" genres like Deathcore and Metalcore... <br>  For some reason, I've always thought of Lamb of God and A Life Once Lost as grindcore bands, maybe its just me though :P<br>  <br>  MQ: Napalm Death!!!

RLNiasGtaa	Paramore dont have an actual album of theirs that has Decode and I Caught Myself on it. They only come on the Twilight soundtrack, and if your one of those people who hate Twilight and dont want to get the soundtrack well believe me the soundtrack is amazing..!<br>  xx|`|lrCn1palaa	Yup yup, the Twilight soundtrack! It also has Muse and Linkin Park on it and lots of other artists.<br>  You should give a listen to Paramore's pre-twilight records they are Awesome as well!<br>  <br>  All We Know Is Falling-2005<br>  Riot!-2007<br>  They will not disappoint!!|`|Gbcp7hDIaa	The Twilight Soundtrack has both (:<br>  <br>  Ox.|`|Toeg0ovgaa	yup the twilight soundtrack|`|3LEPfzVhaa	Yes the Twilight soundtrack, both of those songs were written for Twilight. There are other songs on there from different artists though.|`|DocXfujAaa	It's not a Paramore album, but there is one.<br>  <br>  It is a movie soundtrack from the movie Twilight.<br>  <br>  Think its exact name is Twilight Motion Picture Soundtrack.|`|JabqFBOkaa	Yes. The Twilight Soundtrack.<br>  But, they do have a new album coming out soon(ish)....around winter I think, which will most likely have both on.|`|EB8MubVZaa	nopee cos they were made for the twilight film, so theyre both on the soundtrack<br>  maybe paramore will include one or both on their next album if were lucky lol|`|DzMKHmGYaa	Yeah, they are both on the Twilight soundtrack, and maybe Paramore will put them on their new album this year|`|zwi5vdYuaa	twilight soundtrack
2i6TPlauaa	Well, that's my favorite album of all time. And it's nice to see a question on my favorite band.<br>  <br>  Then, I have to choose "White Light/White Heat". Their first two records always have me torn: which is better? On some days it's their debut and on other days its "White Light/White Heat". It is such a nasty record. Dirty. Obscene. Vicious. Raw. Anti-social. Ugly. This avant-garde extravaganza is dripping with NYC and its 'perks'. No Nico. No Andy Warhol. Just the Velvets doing what they want, how they want to do it. With the opening track you know you're in for something else. Then you have "The Gift", a spoken word/instrumental telling the saddening story of one Waldo Jeffers while being held up by swirling feedback and pretension (though not expected in the slightest). "Lady Godiva's Operation" follows with Mr. Cale's lovely singing and includes Lou and John's failed BBC experiment. "Here She Comes Now" is the only song lacking certain elements of the avant-garde, but that doesn't hurt it. It is often called the worst produced album of all time and you can see why. Just listen to "I Heard Her Call My Name"; it is terrifying. Lou Reed plays like a possessed Ornette Coleman and sings the unintelligible lines with a certain ease. The solo is reason alone to hear the album: it wails, moans, growls, hisses. Then....then you have the epic closing track known as "Sister Ray". The band members each trying to outdo the other in a superb fashion. Lou sings of speed, transvestites, lobotomies, wood, murder (though not intended), debauchery, prostitutes, homosexuality, smack, orgies, sailors and the like on this album. I adore this album to death (and all of its little eccentricities).|`|Rmy8bWnsaa	The Velvet Underground, I just love every single track on it. I actually have grown to like it more than The VU & Nico.|`|wXv50mNEaa	Their self-titled. It's beautiful, soft, and still intrinsically VU. It's Lou Reed at his most lyrical. It just feels like you're at home, you know? Like the little way Lou laughs when he sings "Some Kinda Love"... It's reminiscent of folk Dylan. Even with out John Cale, the band remains out there and avant garde, just in a different way.|`|ONWCXzUMaa	The Velvet Underground & Nico [1967]<br>  take care<br>  dave|`|adLSRFrZaa	"White Light/White Heat (1968)"<br>  I can hear the birth of Punk Rock in this album.|`|5HvdcWvBaa	VU. <br>  <br>  'Cause it has 'Ocean'. <br>  <br>  And you can't really argue with that...can you? <br>  <br>  :)
wTNAOcl1aa	Cover - Nirvanas Nevermind.<br>  <br>  I listen to that album all the time, but every time i do, i glance back at my i:Pod and see baby penis. Not pleasant.|`|ebxwADDcaa	cover - probably something like this:<br>  <a href="http://img60.imageshack.us/img60/6508/split20torsofuck20lymphatic20p.gif" rel="nofollow">http://img60.imageshack.us/img60/6508/sp...</a><br>  <br>  title - I'll go with Vaginal Diarrhea<br>  <br>  overall album...something produced by disney|`|Csx3ZXlmaa	Worst album cover definitely goes to Nevermind by Nirvana. I LOVE that album, but baby penis = weird! Oh, and the cover of Pearl Jam's eponymous 8th album- an avocado does not make for an exciting album cover.<br>  <br>  Worst album title has to be Chocolate Starfish And The Hot-Dog Flavored Water by Limp Bizkit. It's basically referring to the anus, but they definitely went a bit too far. Much like the album itself, they went too far down the toilet. :P<br>  <br>  Overall album goes to the horrendous new Pussycat Dolls album, Doll Domination. The cheesy album cover (it's super-hot, but cheesy nonetheless), the even cheesier title, and the awful music within makes for a boring, manufactured pop experience. Why did I listen to it? Curiosity, stupidity and the hot women on the cover :P|`|Catsy82Caa	worst album cover: iron maiden - dance of death<br>  <a href="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/d/de/Iron_Maiden-Dance_of_Death.jpg" rel="nofollow">http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en...</a><br>  <br>  worst album title: ultra beatdown (dragonforce)<br>  <br>  worst overall album: lou reed - metal machine music|`|RKMWeMk9aa	This one is pretty awful IMO.<br>  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Gift_of_Game" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Gift_of...</a>|`|wXyoo8mNaa	Any thing done by springstein|`|kjSkCmtVaa	any punk band ruining a classic rock song
1H7Z3Pivaa	It's more of the quality than the quantity. <br>  <br>  He is very particular of the quality of the materials of his albums and takes time to go over about the songs he releases. However, it is a well known "secret"  that he has an extensive amount of unreleased materials, not put in his officially released albums. I have watched some of them on youtube, he has lots of them.|`|JpH6FAlBaa	Because before that he sang with Jackson 5..I think they were rather famous then he had his own carreer..maybe that is why he sold so many albums because he waited til he had really good stuff before releasing and album..unlike some who get a couple of really good singles then just start popping out the albums to sit in the bargain bin, All about quality not quantity|`|P9K7AYmWaa	Because he can sing good hes verry handsome and talented and has amazing dance skills.<br>  <br>  only thriller sold 750 million world wide. all his albums together must be billions sold|`|3b1f171c73bb2e24acbb7271e47a68faaa	Because he fillled the "Pop" niche at a time when no one else was out there like him.  The result was a crazy amount of record sales....|`|SvzsXddUaa	Umm, hello???<br>  <br>  Does the name "Thriller" answer the question for you???|`|OPM1v0VCaa	He has the talent to do so.|`|vOPZXZ8taa	He was in the Jackson 5, a HUGE group.<br>  and, then his Debut was "off the wall"; That sold like crazy<br>  then, came Thriller which would end up being the highest selling album in history.<br>  <br>  Do the math.|`|fpyRo8Noaa	because he brought something new to the industry...what he did had never been done....his video thriller was the very first video ever to have a story line.....his style was different and amazing....there was nobody like him...he's very talented|`|kH0FkRtwaa	It's because it was quality.

So one female rapper can't get no respect. You have to have a bunch of them. Also Women in hip hop are portrayed has video vixens. And Lastly, many female rappers don't stay relavant after there first or second hit album they always seem to fall off... <br>  <br>  Sell...

However, she isn't for the mainstream crap listeners that usually ask about 'rappers'. Jean Grae's material is intelligent, with more complicated flows, rhyme schemes, and delivery.|`|AA12241070	Queen Latifah is the original female rapper. MC Lyte is nice. But I like<br>  Lil' Kim. She's the greatest female rapper of all time. <br>  <br>  <br>  So Lil Kim it is.|`|ibMa9DQEaa	missy elliot

Don't get me wrong, I like about 75% of all these bands, but if you want punk or anything, how about The Ramones, Minor Threat, Sunny Day Real Estate, ect.?|`|v0DuLwLDaa	Nikki sixx  (6 am album) from moltey crue<br>  bullet for my valentine   youtube these peeps.<br>  oh and rob zombie  --> so numb<br>  cradle of fifth<br>  <br>  check out gunther too =]|`|QQztS5Nmaa	I love your music sense you might like some of these:<br>  <br>  MGMT<br>  Yeah yeah yeahs<br>  Hello Goodbye<br>  Kaiser Chiefs<br>  Hot Club De Paris<br>  The Wombats<br>  <br>  There are some more if i think i will tell you more .x|`|p2iLuTyVaa	blink182, aiden, bowling for soup, cute is what we aim for, funeral for a friend, hellogoodbye, three days grace, bullet for my valentine, kaiser chiefs, WE ARE THE OCEAN, all american rejects, a day to remember, the enemy, madina lake, etc|`|87deabd3c525e7aca518d4cbf44e4df0aa	The Thermals<br>  The Long Winters<br>  Operator Please<br>  The Hold Steady<br>  Metric<br>  Cancer Bats<br>  Tilly and the Wall<br>  Attack in Black<br>  Yeah Yeah Yeahs<br>  Enter Shikari<br>  Daphne Loves Derby<br>  The Morning Benders<br>  The Broken West<br>  Be Your Own Pet<br>  The Stills<br>  Minus the Bear<br>  <br>  =]
3a9f3003abdd986d136bc7307c02868faa	I hate to see anyone leave a show like this through injury etc, so I'm kinda sad about that.<br>  <br>  I do feel that she was the weakest skater, but I felt she was showing that it's giving it your all that matters etc, and I much prefer her on there than Ray as she seems more modest, and knows she has her flaws.|`|AA10077992	<a href="http://www.oddschecker.com/specials/dancing-on-ice/next-elimination" rel="nofollow">http://www.oddschecker.com/specials/danc...</a><br>  <br>  She was favourite to go tomorrow anyway.

If she does pull out I shall be like Happy Happy House!!!!!  Maybe it's her excuse to bow out anyway.  I do like Colleen but think it is wrong she is still in it.|`|zZ3Uxllfaa	thats a shame for her  it she does have to pull out  because of it ,all it will mean is a good skater will get the boot tomorrow instead although i'm sure her fans would have voted to keep her anyway.|`|FcHplZtQaa	Just a pity it was according to "The Mirror", hardly a reliable broadsheet eh Jordan?<br>  <br>  Still, fingers crossed!|`|aKhZNd7daa	Shame if she does have to pull out through injury Jord but I reckon she'd have been doing a lap of honour tonight anyway !!|`|6b8e59fd2fd02ff0fc91538b71ecd4d8aa	I'll bet she's still there on sunday - she won't give up b'c of a wrist injury...well unless she's got wind she's probably out anyway...|`|LObTrVmaaa	I actually like Coleen and hope that she's not injured herself badly. BUT she should've been off weeks ago cos she's not really very good, is she? She's so wooden and definitely has no elegance - like a sack of spuds really. The only reason she's there is because of the popularity of Loose Women.  I was listening to Faith Brown on Friday and she said that Coleen "is the most improved skater there".  Was she watching the same Coleen as me? Anyway, even if she is OK to continue, the minute she's up before the judges - and she WILL be - she's for the off!|`|S0Clu20aaa	I don't like her too much anyway !!!!<br>  Will she get a replacement ?????<br>  Funny mary lol|`|i7DKiaHBaa	since when did ice skaters skate on there hands

My stepmother loved the Beatles and it was all I could do just to SURVIVE them!|`|vLtQ3BRpaa	1. No, they're not. I think we had to be living in their time to fully understand what they came here to do.<br>  <br>  2. John Lennon. Didn't he play sitar?<br>  <br>  3. While My Guitar Gently Weeps, or Come Together.<br>  <br>  Some people WILL find the bands you like overrated. we all have our own opinions, so don't be so strong to say you've got the best, underrated taste of music. :P|`|gwjBvXTbaa	1. I do think that they are very popular and their title has become a "fad" ... their popularity, I believe, is what makes them seem overrated... I can see where you are coming from, but I do love the Beetles so.<br>  <br>  2. I love John Lenin <br>  <br>  3. I loved the song "Because"<br>  <br>  I will star this so more people will answer.<br>  Best of Wishes.|`|AA10409800	The widely acknowledged greatest band ever?

Yes- I get the impression that they sounded like anyone else in the 60's. Legends in the 60's should go to Jimi Hendrix and The Doors- who really changed the evolution of music.<br>  <br>  2. George Harrison- awesome guitarist. Maybe John Lennon?<br>  <br>  3. Michelle- I love that song, or Hard Day's night.|`|cyzu8fg5aa	1. Do you find The Beatles overrated? YES. Bands out there equally as good but not half the fuss was made of them. Like Deep Purple for example.<br>  <br>  2. Who was Your Favourite Member? PROBABLY GEORGE<br>  <br>  3.

Do you find The Beatles overrated? Nope, I think if you can get past the 10 most popular beatles songs and listen to some of less popular songs out of their massive catalog you would really enjoy it. Good messages unlike the crap we hear today about poppin booties. dont get me wrong i occasionally like a booty poppin song<br>  <br>  2. Who was Your Favourite Member? I like them all,  they were great as a group, and i dont think anyone of them could have been replaced within the group.<br>  <br>  3. What was your favourtie song? Rocky Raccoon|`|qpln6o9Yaa	No they are not overrated and you have to be my age to know that.<br>  <br>  John Lennon because of his wit and talent<br>  <br>  "Sgt. Peppers Lonely Hearts Club Band" (hard to pick just one)<br>  <br>  They were the first and greatest. They started it all and there are not too many groups in the world that can say that.|`|neuprBeGaa	1.  They are not overrated.  Whether you like them or not, you can trace their influence forward to pretty much every artist making music today.<br>  <br>  2.  John Lennon.  McCartney put the "pop" in their pop music - but John put in the music.<br>  <br>  3.  Yesterday.|`|2Yj4jTqhaa	1. I don't think they're overrated. I actually love their songs. They just made too many love songs.<br>  <br>  2. My favorite member was probably Ringo Star, just because I could always remember his name.<br>  <br>  3. Hello, Goodbye.|`|pVdV4gwgaa	No they aren't overrated! They are freakin' awesome!<br>  John Lennon of course<br>  they have alot of good ones but I prefer Twist and Shout (or I Wanna Hold Your Hand ) They interchange simultaneously|`|HmWvy0oIaa	Nope! I don't think they're overrated at all.<br>  John<br>  "Strawberry Fields Forever"|`|FZCi6WXRaa	You're fukin crazy The Beatles are fukin legends!!<br>  No I do not find them overrated.|`|kA7GEKf7aa	your mom's overrated...

Im watching it for the show not for him.  I will watch for KC because shes a sweetheart and the first american idol... shes an inspiration.|`|bZ8W1B3vaa	I think Kanye is arrogant and Kelly well...what has she done lately?<br>  <br>  Just get to the competition!!! It's such a stupid gimmick.|`|W6wamWLLaa	If they show it in the UK!!<br>  So what Kanye defended Chris Brown?!|`|qKvnpwL6aa	Nope.
YbmklSzGaa	Oh Punch, however did you come up with this epic match, eh?<br>  Taking place in the 60's...<br>  I'm walking down a dark alley. I hear a rustling from behind. I turn around the see the one, the only...Syd Barrett. As I stare, he walks away. I silently follow him to his apartment. He recites his masterpieces to me. He declares his love for me.  And we get comfortable...  Ignoring all cares (and underage laws :P) we become one...|`|2i6TPlauaa	Maybe this would help me in liking Mr. Morrison. We'd drop out in San Fran and start talking philosophy (which turns some people on). Reaching for a notebook, he would then begin to read his mediocre and pretentious poetry. I wouldn't care; I'd be out of my mind. And the rest is history...and sloppy.|`|6EoAKcMwaa	Jim Morrison without a doubt! I would love to get my hands on "The Lizard King"|`|ONWCXzUMaa	I ain't going anywhere but to Tina's Bed<br>  take care<br>  dave|`|3g3SCnDDaa	These questions aren't fair! I'm a guy...but I guess Morrison. Anybody who sings "Break on Through (to the Other Side)" must be down for anything in my book. Though, afterwards I would go searching for Grace Slick in the Haight, if you know what I mean. ;)<br>  Peace!|`|AA12301664	oh, nothing would have given me more pleasure than a day's punting on the cam, a rustic picnic, some top quality afghan,<br>  <br>  and a night of unadulterated entanglement with mr barrett|`|7B2s7maWaa	All though I can't get into The Doors music.  I can get into Jim Morrison. hehe. <br>  <br>  He wins! All though Sabby has love for Syd also. ;-)|`|OTFzJbaMaa	im gona have to go with jim morrison on this one. he has a very seductive look about him. almost like hed be really sensitve to your needs in bed hahhaha<br>  and he seems like a snuggler =)|`|RtG5Iarbaa	Syd! =)<br>  <br>  <br>  xD|`|rR6lwxjjaa	jim morrison i think :D|`|nYqtw9DWaa	Syd when he was younger <3|`|5HvdcWvBaa	Oh Syd, definitley :)<br>  <br>  Just so people are aware...this is NOT Shred :P|`|Agw4pXAnaa	Jim Morrison easy!

So i guess Syd because he's better looking.

MwiBGBK1aa	HAHA!<br>  <br>  Yes! The movie Labyrinth did scare the living daylights out of me, especially the gremlin who was taking a pee near the beginning of the movie.

A younger guy named Bear Mc Creary.<br>  <br>  The Shape of Things to Come : <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tII1DSHPU80" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tII1DSHPU...</a><br>  <br>  <br>  Try this for pretty sad stuff , <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eWEj8tLXEsc" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eWEj8tLXE...</a><br>  <br>  His music well and truly elevates the entire series, making it something much more than it would be without it.<br>  <br>  That said, there are many pieces which are really good in many ways.<br>  <br>  Some other choices , here another modern piece which is classical in the technical sense but is much more modern in/ from a composition perspective <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FvbCV6E0Wro" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FvbCV6E0W...</a><br>  <br>  There are other pieces which are similar to Beethoven but which are in their own right, great , I consider Bach to be every bit Beethoven's peer in excellence : <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZ9qWpa2rIg&NR=1" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZ9qWpa2r...</a><br>  <br>  That said it's difficult to underestimate Mozart - I sometimes think he get's alot of attention but it's not exactly undue either : <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=io1TLkvQEHQ" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=io1TLkvQE...</a><br>  <br>  When I first heard Mahler's 1st Symphony I didn't really appreciate it until many years later when I understood the technical idea of counterpoint which is REALLY hard to achieve This is from the Symphony #1, Titan - movement #2 : <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DVYZluRnFwM" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DVYZluRnF...</a><br>  <br>  But what's important is to keep you ears open to classical music and you find it everywhere : So the recent Batman movie has a Choral work which is from a band called "E.S. Posthumus" but many major movie composers, Danny Elfman, Hans Zimmer and others have been or has heavily influenced along these lines , which is featured very prominently in many recent movies such as Spiderman, Constantine, Batman etc to the point where it's almost cliche : <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vlP49A8kXyE" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vlP49A8kX...</a><br>  <br>  In fact MANY of the classical pieces stem from works which were not originally so the band Juno Reactor (Benjamin Watkins), produced pieces much like this from - The Matrix - <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t9qqLrdOzDg" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t9qqLrdOz...</a> - but like John Williams and MANY modern composers he is capable of a wide range of work. <br>  <br>  Consider "Conquistador 1" (without the last 20 or 30 seconds) as a stand alone religiously inspired piece called "a Lacrimosa" or lamenting prayer of the Latin Era of the Roman Catholic Church <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UI_VSuTJpjE" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UI_VSuTJp...</a>|`|9PK7mITnaa	Listen to TK, he knows whats up. Personally, Im really getting tired of the fur elise and moonlight sonata posts. Theres so much greater classical music out there that I wish more people would know.

He wasnt even in the Wild Card Round either! :(|`|uDsXjzwjaa	Nope he didn't make it. I think he should have, but apparently the judges thought differently.
SgulV3wraa	To be quite honest with you i think you need a lot of work. take some lessons but wait a couple of years before you take them so your voice develops more. What I mean is that a 14 year old sound different then a 16 year old. you have potential just need to work on you sound.|`|D2iTHePoaa	oh my you are quite well<br>  just to do some work?<br>  liek yu sownd yor age...just it was a bit off pitch<br>  (sorry about my english too, i am not that well at speeking it)|`|TJBEeXO2aa	It's not completely horrible, but you do need quite some work.<br>  <br>  You went off key quite badly at times...you couldn't hit some low notes. This is quite a bad allocation for song with your range.<br>  <br>  But I'll say your tone is very much suited to this genre! Work towards it, and you'll shine!|`|vX7Xei50aa	u soound about ur age..ur pretty good tbh but make one wer  u havent been singing for a while..so we can get a better idea..but yeh ur good...maybe if u got lessons u could be a lot better :)

Xa7TaXDRaa	12 bar blues in Bb?<br>  remember this: 1, 4, 5 (or i, iv, v)<br>  1 stands for the first note in any major scale<br>  4 stands for the fourth note...and so on<br>  <br>  12 bar blues goes like this (the lines separate the measures):<br>  <br>  |  1  |  1  |  1  |  1  |  4  |  4  |  1  |  1  |  5  |  4  |  1  |  1 and/or 5  |<br>  <br>  thats the 12 bar blues progression.  <br>  if you dont know what to play just play the basic notes like this:<br>  Bb  Bb  Bb  Bb  Eb  Eb  Bb  Bb  F  Eb  Bb  Bb/F<br>  <br>  just hold each note for four beats or one measure and youre playing the  blues.<br>  <br>  check out youtube for blues progression lessons theres plenty of stuff there.|`|FUwnW9Mtaa	Horns and keyboards are easier to finger in B flat.

yoVF60ORaa	it's not that game did anything to him, it's just that once the game/50 beef started dre had to play it smooth, not that he necessarily chose 50's side in the beef, but he couldn't be working with both sides and act like it was all cool...however, game specifically stated that Dre needed to be involved in his next album if it was going to get made|`|ImtUUrCZaa	I think something happened between him and 50 cent.

IFcbqkQhaa	To me it looks like this: Back then the quality of the show was crappy and bad but it was really funny and had creativity. Now it has great quality and the pictures are more clear but it doesn't have much creativity no more.<br>  That was the trade off<br>  It kind of still makes me laugh but either way, im alwas gonna be a die hard simpson fan!|`|AA10050051	The show did change a lot and it has not been as funny as it has been in a long time. I think American Dad and Family Guy are two of the funnier shows that comes on Sunday. I am not really feeling King of the Hill, but, that has an acquired feel to that show. <br>  Anyway, I still watch the show, but I do not laugh as hard as I used to.|`|7Vka1VcOaa	To suggest that a person would like any show for 20 years is unrealistic. The level of writing can't be sustained at the same level for that long, mainly because the cast of writers is always changing. I thought the Simpsons peaked in the mid-nineties. I stopped watching the show years ago.|`|7ED5xvGxaa	Its still funny but the time has run out. 20 years is a long time. I guess they lost some of their creativity. At least the show has a story line unlike other shows like family guy which are basically about random hilarious crap.|`|BNrQSYwhaa	Matt groaning no longer directs the show and since then pop culture has been incorporated into their episodes.The characters have no moral values anymore|`|Wy3wddFlaa	it changed
BGdnqyNQaa	You can have a go at teaching people to get through their grades, as far as I know there aren't any rules to say you can't. I presume you'll have a grade 5 theory if you are doing your grade 6 practical, this you will find invaluable when a student asks you why the B you've just pointed to on the stave doesn't have a sharp or what that funny squiggle with the dots over that note means. <br>  The things you will need to teach young pupils are patients, perseverance and a willingness to continue even though you know they have not practised in two weeks and show little sign of improvement no matter how hard you try. You will also need a thick skin for protection when you tell Mr and Mrs Doting  parent that they're wasting their money as their little Tommy is a talentless fool when it comes to the piano and would be better suited to learning to dig holes in sand.<br>  Good luck.|`|h6JJNgoKaa	With your Grade 6 you can teach up to and including grade 3 as long as you continue to improve and get higher grades.  You should also as you are contemplating this obtain at least your grade 2 theory before you start teaching.   This is perfectly acceptable.  Have fun and remember that the students quite often are teaching you as you teach them.  You may not teach any student that is equal to you in grades or above you.  I put myself through College teaching.  It was better and more money less time spent than any other part time job I could have obtained at the time.|`|CXgPkEPFaa	you cant teach in like a school or something, but you could teach private lessons to like neighborhood kids and stuff for like $10. I started doin it when I was about 11 and made $100s but I quit because I hated it... <br>  <br>  but if you're good enough I'd give it a try =]

dFacbjIZaa	Meddle is their next best album after that in My opinion.<br>  <br>  This is how I would rank the rest of the Floyd studio albums You do  not have yet<br>  <br>  1 Meddle<br>  2 Animals<br>  3 Obscured By Clouds<br>  4 Piper At The Gates Of Dawn<br>  5 A Saucerful Of Secrets<br>  6 The Final Cut<br>  7 The Wall<br>  8 More<br>  9 The Division Bell<br>  10 Atom Heart Mother<br>  11 Ummagumma<br>  12 A Momentary Lapse Of Reason|`|b596afeb182e83361c069a4dbe60acf3aa	The next difinitive album is obviously The Wall. After that I would reccomend Animals and my personal favorite The Final Cut which does not deserve the bad reviews it received. Meddle and Piper at the Gates of Dawn are both fine albums but require a fine tuned ear and should be regarded as later purchases in the Pink Floyd Library. Toodles!|`|AA11039335	I would definitely suggest Meddle.<br>  <br>  Here's a sample..<br>  <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uLJ_QVfT_wM" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uLJ_QVfT_...</a><br>  <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5sein6WnbY0&feature=related" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5sein6Wnb...</a><br>  and<br>  <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DQvG2SMVl84" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DQvG2SMVl...</a><br>  <br>  Enjoy!

It's the soundtrack to a French movie called La Vallee. Love the fact that it's not a concept album. It's a very accessible album, with great, relatively short, songs. <br>  <br>  Either that, or, if you want to listen to a more experimental Floyd album, I'd say go with Atome Heart Mother. Mindblowing album.|`|48df0ea585c1658be36a46553408d993aa	I'd say behind those two.... the one that gets the most play in my house is Meddle.<br>  <br>  And while I love The Wall, I love The Wall: Live in Berlin better. It would be my 4th place. Maybe even 3rd, but I wanted to name a wholly "Pink Floyd" album, not a compilation as the Live in Berlin one is, thus Meddle.|`|ecL0ZbfCaa	'Piper At The Gates Of Dawn'<br>  'Atom Heart Mother'<br>  'Meddle'<br>  'Animals'<br>  'The Wall'<br>  <br>  If you like the two you've got, you'll enjoy these!|`|zZPbmxWkaa	The Wall<br>  Piper at the Gates of Dawn<br>  Meddle<br>  Animals<br>  Obscured by Clouds<br>  Atom Heart Mother<br>  Ummagumma

dpYMlxA4aa	F up to E# would be an augmented seventh. it will sound the same as an octave because E# and F are the same pitch.<br>  <br>  F down to C is a perfect fourth.<br>  <br>  also the key you're in has no impact on the intervals themselves (though the key will impact if we hear an interval as an augmented 2nd or a minor third. I don't know of any example where we would hear something as an augmented seventh instead of as an octave). Likewise the instrument an interval is played on has no impact on the interval unless you're talking about a piece that has serialized instrumentation.|`|InAICv25aa	In music theory, the interval between a F natural on D string and an E sharp on E string is an augmented seventh. It sounds like an octave (like Fa Fa)<br>  <br>  The interval between a F natural on the E string and a C natural on the A string is a perfect fourth.<br>  <br>  On the violin, since F natural on D string is exactly a fifth apart from the C natural on the A string, you can just move your finger from the A string to the D string without changing its position, and change from a C to an F. <br>  <br>  Basically, if you play the F natural on the E string with your first finger, and then the C natural or the F natural with your second finger. There is exactly one step (or two half-step) difference between the first and the second finger.|`|AA11294714	When evaluating intervals, it doesn't matter what key you're in-- though I'm wondering why there are C and F naturals in D major.  <br>  <br>  When you evaluate intervals, you put the lowest one, first, and then count up the letters, always including both the starting (lower) note, and the top note.  <br>  <br>  F-D  This is an intervals of a sixth.  <br>  <br>  E# and F are the same note  (what is an E# doing in the key of D?)<br>  <br>  C natural-F natural  (if you're in the key of D, why are both of these notes naturals??)  This is a perfect 4th.

I can think back to when my viewpoint could pretty much be expressed by the lyrics to "Keep Yourself Alive".|`|5HvdcWvBaa	Oh hell yes, I think its still having an impact on my personality 'cause I'm still growing up, really. <br>  <br>  I think a lot of things affect how you turn out, like your parents and stuff that you go through in your life. But I think what music you listen to certainly also has an affect 'cause it can change what mood you're in, etc. And I definitley think it can change the way you end up and the way you act. <br>  <br>  But only to a certain extent. I mean look at my ex bf, he loves Pantera and personality wise he is a lying asshole. But has Pantera made his personality that way...most probably not. So, I hope you see what I mean :)|`|Ew7hXGFtaa	I think the music I listen to now probably does some. I'm a big metalhead and that has changed so many things in my life. Because of being a metalhead, well first of all I come here a lot and I have a whole seperate group of friends then I think I would if I didn't listen to metal so that obviously changes my personality at least a little.|`|l8c2kTlvaa	definately|`|ONWCXzUMaa	There sure did, and still do  [Rolling Stones]<br>  take care<br>  dave|`|r6rcCTKHaa	Greatly. I feel like the kids that grew up listening rock music have much different personalities than the kids listening to rap or radio music. It all depends on the messages the bands you listen to are sending out and whether you choose to listen to them. Kids that grew up on popular radio pop are probably still going to like popular radio pop and when the top song on the billboard changes, so will they. <br>  <br>  not trying to be stereotypical or anything. <br>  My number one band i grew up listening to was the Foo Fighters, and I defiantly have more in common and get along better with kids who grew up listening to bands like that.|`|FdUKvE6xaa	No, it's more like I listen to what I do BECAUSE of my personality & who I am/was. I'm attracted to things I can relate to, mostly lyrically, but a fair amount of mindless fun stuff too...<br>  <br>  If anything, I think maybe the music I was exposed to as a kid via my parents really opened my mind to most genres, so I'm not as much of a music snob as some people. I mean, I have over 4,000 artists in my last.fm library & I know there's a lot missing from there that I only have on vinyl, etc.|`|By226Cp0aa	i think that it does to an extent. i mean im totally into goth punk and industrial, metal, and things of that nature. I mean like when i listen to like kittie or shadows fall i don't go out and get into i fight but alot of music has gotten me through rough parts in my life.|`|adLSRFrZaa	I think Music had shaped my personality my whole life.  It has made me more open minded, and has made me more willing to experiment for better or for worse.|`|SztleLnUaa	Freddie Mercury has certainly had an impact on my personality.<br>  Many  choices in my life were made because of  this.|`|ahjSAkMbaa	Just look at me!!! What do you think??|`|U9aGNLojaa	Yes. Just like any factor introduced to you at a young age.

unvP5cUdaa	Whoa, start again!<br>  <br>  Absoulutely not. If you allow unlicensed stations with any more power than necessary to get outside your own home (or pretty close) you risk anarchy of the airwaves.<br>  <br>  This actually happened in Italy many years ago until the government stepped in (as most governments have) and put a stop to it. There were stations crowding and overiding one another on all frequencies and you couldn't hear anything for the noise.<br>  <br>  Radio frequencies are finite (as opposed to infinite). There are only so many of them and they must be controlled to prevent this bleeding of signals.<br>  <br>  Learn more at the below site.<br>  <br>  -a guy named duh|`|aCDWwsisaa	It is.<br>  <br>  A license is only required once your transmitter reaches a certain power....<br>  <br>  (Ever hear of XM or Sirius Radio?

o8y7MYi0aa	Mathcore is a technical form of metalcore. It stops and changes tempo at the most random points and tends to be like a metal form of jazz where they pretty much make it up on the spot.<br>  In other words, metal with ADD.|`|hJP9y6kjaa	Near as I understand, it's bands that write songs that have multiple time signatures and polyrhythms (one time signature over another, basically). Combine this with progressive leanings (non-conventional song structures), and plenty of dissonant riffage... and that's basically mathcore.<br>  <br>  Mathcore differs from math rock in that it's more closely associated with metal stylings vs rock stylings.<br>  <br>  <br>  Saul

KzRH5LjZaa	people just started listening to new stuff and they listen to the classic stuff less and less<br>  <br>  BUT NOT ME LED ZEPPELIN FOR LIFE|`|dyV9MPhDaa	Technology and the cool factor. :)|`|Ahm3fSYlaa	well im 14 and all i listen to is classic rock all the time, it seems people in my generation are listening to rap or very heavy metal rock, you have a very good point in your list except you forgot that the artists writing the songs also needed the hair (it adds to the effect). It is very true in fact the economy would probably be better if the U.S. listened to more classic rock. Thank you for letting me answer your question.<br>  <br>  P.S. i have a fair amount of cds too.|`|NKPNOwZuaa	Audioslave, Velvet Revolver...both were hard rock supergroups.<br>  <br>  <br>  The definition of hard rock has changed though. It seems too many of you have a close-minded definition on hard rock...and always refer to the same 80s stuff again and again. Grunge was hard rock. Faith No More was hard rock. Rage Against the Machine was hard rock. At times, Foo Fighters were hard rock. System of a Down, Tool, Deftones, KoRn, Disturbed...all are hard rock.<br>  <br>  And what about Wolfmother....aren't they hard rock too?<br>  <br>  <br>  All of you who are whining about hard rock's death needs to do some reading on styles of hard rock and definitely needs to expand their music tastes<br>  <br>  <br>  As for progressive rock, I thought it was making noise again. There's this band called Between the Buried and Me that's making noise everywhere I go.<br>  <br>  <br>  Edit: Person below I love you|`|rXlyHk1Raa	But kids are the ones who are probably buying all the new music and are content with the crap of today. I have to deal with it all day, but I still only listen to classic rock|`|RWUecQwAaa	well popular music genres change every decade it just happens this decade, the most popular one is not a sub genre of rock(e.g. alternative & grunge in the 90's; glam metal in the 80's) but hip hop/rap. Also, many classic rock bands (Aerosmith, ACDC) are releasing new records, so maybe its unnecessary.

Homme also stated Queens' new album is going to be a 'desert orgy in the dark.'"<br>  <br>  Strokes:<br>  "The Strokes' frontman Julian Casablancas and guitarist Nick Valensi started writing new material for their band's forthcoming new album in the latter stages of January 2009, which they were set to go in the studio to finalize in February of the same year"<br>  <br>  Muse:<br>  "In NME magazine, running up to the Wembley Stadium gigs of June 2007, Matt is quoted as saying he didn't think the next Muse release would be a full album, but rather that new songs would be release soon after they finished touring, through an outlet such as download-only singles."

I think the only times they curse is why they said ***** once or twice.|`|YulFSEdBaa	The fact that you want to ******* buy this pile of ******* shite suggests that you are a ******* cuntstain, you wankhammer. **** off and die in a ******* vat of pure cunting hydrochloric acid.<br>  <br>  You cuntbag.|`|47QsxtN0aa	Here's all the lyrics; you can check em all yourself<br>  <br>  But you really shouldn't let a childish fear of swearing ruin your musical taste|`|978cc94dbd1e39eedeaf3a8a95d0d7d8aa	they don't swear at all. they have a lot of good songs and you should go for it, they're getting very popular, and u should buy the C.D. if your not sure go to youtube.com and search their songs and listen to them.<br>  <br>  good luck!
12QJ9QMRaa	Yo.<br>  <br>  Well, I have a lot I really like and respect a ton, and many of them for very different reasons.<br>  <br>  I am not going to rank em, cuz I don't vieew em that way, and for my contacts that are not mentioned, it ain't for lack of appreciation, but more like me doing a cliff notes/greatest hits nad oonly touching on those who I can instantly ID a reason for liking.  (if I was not fond of a person, or thought less then well of them, needless to say they would not be my contact)  And I am only gonna list 5.<br>  <br>  But the 5 that hit my hall of fame for this week are <br>  <br>  -DUDETTE.  I have only known her for 2 months, and already consider her as good af riend as some that I deal with in the flesh.  She is honest, doesn't have an ego, and wants to learn.  Also she is a very talented artist.  Being that we have a common love for Heavy Metal, Drawing and the Bible, it would be very hard not to consider her one of my absolute faves.<br>  <br>  -DARTH in all his various guises.  There has been disagreement, there has been controversy.  We have certaily NOT seen eye to eye on things.  But despite protestations from some parties, he has never done me wrong, and he is not only a very generous person, but also a good foil for my tastes.  His interest in Classic Metal is a good balance for my love of more modern and extreme Metal, and I think we both benefit from it.<br>  <br>  -FIRESIGN  also one of my newer contacts.  But he gives really really deep and great answers.  HIs love of Metal is similiar to mine, and I really enjoy interacting with him.  IAnd when I say love of MEtal, the passion he has for it has bled out in some answers he gave to my questions that make my own look juvenile by comparison.<br>  <br>  <br>  -TRON.  We only communicate very hit and miss, but man, that dude knows his Extreme Metal, and unlike most Extreme Metal fans, is not an elitist jerk about it.   He likes what he likes, but is very open to opinions, and trying new things, and does NOT try to froce his point of view on others.  I really apreciatte that, and that he understands my POV, and the lines aI wont't cross, so I know that most of his suggestions are things I would not be uncomfortable with, or if he does doe srecommend something to me that is outside my tastes, it won't be intentionally.   More users could learn form his respectful standards.<br>  <br>  -RIKITIKITAVI.   The dude just flat out cares.   If you have sen his tireless attempts to raise awarenss of the situation in Australia, you would see and understand that few on here can touch him for pure compassion.  Plus he has a great sense of humor, as he helped me engineer the Joker Invasion of last summer, and constantly seems to be starring hilarious Qs for me to laugh at.  Great person.<br>  <br>  beyond that, there are a lot I value.<br>  Neither you or Shreder are my Contacts, but I enjoy you guys bboth a lot, and look forward to hearing some more of Shreds musci when it is ready.  FFAF is a great poet and I really like his honesty.  Adam is a good kid, even if he loves some pretty crappy bands ( =P) Persephone and APC have been stalwarts onmy contact list since I got here and the list goes on.   A Fair Judgement and Nymphetimine have both been helpful for letting me look at things from the perspective of other culturess, and so many more I really cannot list them all.<br>  <br>  As I said before, I don't look at my contact list as a popularity contest, as I would never have added someone if I didn't truly think they stood head and shoulders above the rest of the section.<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  BQ- as for the BAs...no.  I try very hard ot give them to the best, most thouguht out, and or thought provoking answer.  But as I said, the reason I add someone is becasue I think they are pretty sharp, and so it is no coincidence that they continue to garner the lions share fo my BAs.  But I will flat leave a contact in the dust if someone else deserves the BA.  And chances are, if I see a pattern from that person I will add them as a contact (provided I get unlazy and remember to get around to it.

q4XUy0Duaa	BUY<br>  <br>  I think it all boils down to survival.  Women are naturally attracted to the "alpha male" which the bad guy is usually perceived to be, but often isn't.  Also, women get attention from men on a daily basis, whether it's whistling, men staring at them, or constantly being called beautiful, or whatever the case may be.  When the bad guy comes along who doesn't show them this attention, or is even a d*ck to them, it's somewhat refreshing for the woman to not be praised.  They feel like they're not on his level, and they seek his approval, praise and attention even more.  They also respect someone who will put them in their place.  It sounds sick, but It's just in their human nature.|`|okECVBkzaa	It all depends mayne. Some girls are just like Frum mentioned, no doubt. Others like men that are settled down with a bright future and some like the nerdy type like someone mentioned. Every woman is different. Myself, I concider to be well balanced. Im a good man, but far from a pushover. If the nice man is easy to walk over or is too nice that can be viewed as a turnoff. Life is all about balance.

That is Season One Episode 19|`|AA10050051	I think that was last season where the girl was pregnant but she did not know it and the baby was growing outside the embryo or something to that nature.

b7c4d588c72eafb51a030d3ecaaf372caa	Me personally...Yes no question about it. <br>  To clarify the whole "born gay" thing: No one is born gay - True, but it is possible to be genetically...more likely to become gay. A significant amount of personality and sexuality IS based on each particular persons balance of hormones/chemicals. Male-A born with unbalanced hormones is more likely to become gay than Male-B who has normal levels. There are gay people biologically normal and there are straight people biologically abnormal so it definitely isn't something you're just born with but it can influence.   |`|AA11513482	I wouldn't care if it was gay.

ecL0ZbfCaa	Hi, yes I was lucky enough to see them in London in 1990.  I wasn't a fan at the time, went with someone who was, so I can't really remember what songs they did.  Really enjoyed it though, I do remember a great version of 'The Weight' at the end.<br>  Awesome, so glad I got to see them!|`|8RflQ9DVaa	Yes. More than a couple times. And a long, long time ago. Always at the Fillmore. Late '60's, early '70's. My Mom's friend used to do light shows when the Dead played and she'd take me. One time we went as a 'Thank You' for helping to clean up after the Altamont concert and got to ride over to the city with the Stones road manager. I was a little kid.|`|YA4qCDukaa	nope, never have. i'm waaaaaaaaaaay to young unfortunately.......i wish i could have thought. my aunt & uncle meet at a grateful dead concert. she use to tell me stories of all the concerts that she went to....(edited them & didn't tell me the story until i was older.) so i lived vicariously though her.|`|3b1f171c73bb2e24acbb7271e47a68faaa	I wish!  There are a few bands I wish I had been around to witness... one of them was Pink Floyd. one was the Grateful Dead.<br>  <br>  The biggest singer/group I wish I could have seen would be Bob Marley.|`|UFE7BJHBaa	no|`|SmVHRpr5aa	No. But they're coming to my state in April, and I'm hoping to go if tickets aren't all sold out yet.|`|1uvrkDWNaa	Yes, I have.  I believe it was either '92 or '93 at Soldier Field in Chicago, and Sting was the opening act.|`|W4BvABL6aa	Yes and happy to say. I missed a lot of other culture riveting bands of the 60's and 70's. But the Dead is a Happy thought. Guessing the year was 74. I have to look up when Pig Pen died,  because I got to see him that time. Opening act .... NRPS<br>  <br>  [EDIT] ... I see your later part of question now.....     They all had short hair except Pig Pen, I was not expecting that, for that era. I wish I could remember if Garcia played with NRPS at all. <br>   <br>  My title by my avatar is to help me locate a large concert going band of freaks and daddies. Maybe someday, one will get in touch and we can sort out the lost information of the era.

9ee25102a7763535588f4a899e88f4dcaa	I think you mean the Alpine Symphony ('Eine Alpensinfonie'). But by no stretch of the imagination is this a 'song'. A song is a short piece to be sung by a singer ('song', singer' - see the similarity?) with instrumental (most commonly, piano) accompaniment. No voice; not a 'song'.<br>  <br>  It is far better to use terms such as ‘piece’, ‘work’ or ‘composition’ when referring to a piece of music which is not a song (which, in classical music, is most things). This will help you avoid looking a little silly and being pounced on by pedants like me who care about the abuse of language.|`|obGQ2Bqfaa	When you say "song", do you actually mean it is a song ? I don't know many songs with Alpine in the title, But there is a marvellous orchestral piece by Strauss..An Alpine Symphony. Or maybe you mean Songs of the Auvergne ?
4A2IxqI6aa	Hmm.  It might be the "Alpine Symphony" by Richard Strauss.  It's a big symphonic piece (not actually a symphony) written in 1915.|`|obGQ2Bqfaa	hardly a song BUT R.Strauss Alpine Symphony
zHL6LRejaa	yea sure why not..you're only like 1 year older than me?..what shall we dance to?  :)<br>  <br>  wait, you don't even need music to dance to..just an imagination  ;)|`|uLqLS5ntaa	if there was music....<br>  if I knew you ....<br>  we didn't have a big age difference (in your profile it said you were seventeen....
HELfs3uhaa	yes.......because everyone wants to eat me.....|`|ucVgUcDvaa	Yes<br>  Depressed |`|lMKy9Ho8aa	everyone at some point in their lives feel sad, or depressed, about their living situations.<br>  the problem is when people think about suicide, they fail to realize that "suicide is A PERMANENT SOLUTION TO A SHORT-TERM PROBLEM"; for all problems are temporary and pass.<br>  When I get sad, I quickly talk to someone. Some people need serious professional help for their profession and I pray they get it. |`|30Q1007vaa	No, life is too good for that. I don't even cut myself.|`|081NXWAeaa	no, u have i take it|`|87yovKYlaa	yes, cause the doctor put me on antidepressants that made me suicidal. and to think i just went in cause i was having trouble sleeping and feeling sluggish. i think they hand those out to everyone for everything. once i stopped taking them i felt fine but still had trouble getting to sleep and staying asleep. but since sleeping pills don't work for me, i figured out on my own that 2 tall glasses of rum and coke works just fine. no more sleeping problems and no depressing thoughts.|`|ekbEMHozaa	No, but I've thought about killing other people. (kidding).|`|a1it4OWsaa	yes, because of bad days. I overreacted.|`|4PWZmVZ4aa	Yes<br>  <br>  read my profile|`|556f6a84a1e72fa5f9fa440c37251fe4aa	Yes.  I've had these thoughts, on and off, since I was ten years old.  I'm 40-something lately.<br>  <br>  Mainly, it's because life itself hates my stinking guts.  There just is no other way to rationally explain this one, ok?  *lol*  ^_^  Something is *always* wrong with my life.  My parents were seriously messed-up, abusive, neglectful people.  I made some not-so-great choices once I got to college, about my majors and about how much debt I went into to get the damned degree already....never mind that I was juggling work, school and therapy at the time and not entirely sane from *overwork* here.  o_O<br>  <br>  But yeah, it's lots and lots and LOTS of things.  Some of it is my fault--overthinking things and making poor decisions, sticking to poor plans, sure--but a lot of it has just been other people *absolutely never ever* giving me a fair break.  I don't think I had any teachers on my side, on any sort of prolonged basis, until my *last year* in High School--the rest of the time I had to fight through it like Genghis Khan to *take* the grades and education I needed to get out from under the family...<br>  <br>  I digress though, sorry.  A lot of it has really just been me *busting my hump*, always, working way too hard since the backside of forever, only to have some pinhead randomly show up and ruin it for me.<br>  <br>  So yeah, I gave up working three times as hard for one-tenth as much when I turned 40.  That might not have been the healthiest decision either, but you know....I get *deathly tired* of having to work and sweat and beg and plead and grovel and live *in fear*, just for a little tiny *bit* of the things that so many other folks take for granted.  WTF?<br>  <br>  Sorry to go on so....point is, life itself hates my stinking guts.  It's never been anything *but* an unrelenting grind for me, since I was ten years old.  <br>  <br>  It sucks living on the butt-end of an eraser, you know?  The grind, lonliness and ugliness of it all is just killing me anyway, so why not...?|`|DdUmku2oaa	Yes, I had a really difficult 7th, 8th, and beginning or 10th grades in which I was depressed and felt horrible about myself. I planned out my suicide but thank Jesus Christ I did not carry it out. Even though my depression was a severe oppression on me by satan, God had the mercy and the power to have me overcome the death grip I was choking in. I still am amazed by His love and how I overcame what I once thought was purely impossible!|`|BGiQcGCPaa	yes, in elementary school i was in grade 7 and i was depressed and chubby and got made fun of alot, and it actualy got to the point where i planing out my death (leaving a note for my mom and family) and then i went to sleep and woke up at 12am with cops in my house tryin to wake me  up to ask me about why i was killing my self, and then after that i was put on a "restiction" i couldnt be left alone, i couldnt be by fire, needles, or knifes, or safty pins and stuff like that  <br>  <br>  and also in highschool i thought about it again but that was because my best friend died and the last thing that i said to her was i hate you! (but i really loved her (as a friend way) and she was has been my best friend since i was born, we met becuz she used to live next to me and died when she was 14 and i only said i hate you because i was mad at her, and i feel sooo bad that i said that i just wish i could go back but you cant, <br>  <br>  so now i try my hardest to not say that when im mad cause you never know what can happen|`|aDO3Edo3aa	yep<br>  the girl that i loved didn't even care that i was alive<br>  i haven't been able to walk with out crutches for the past two years<br>  at times all of my joints were in pain<br>  another girl said that she like me then when i asked her out she said no|`|7aisLVeiaa	Yes, I've also tried. Because I felt unloved.|`|RXDDYtMRaa	only when I was young...And I admit it was because I felt bad for myself|`|nwhoL46Laa	yes<br>  <br>  diff reasons|`|nH3HmecDaa	no|`|NYXHj02haa	Honestly, who hasn't at least once in their life if only for a second? |`|zhzJoZ26aa	hopefully my friend doesn't read this because she has Y!A too, and she's in my contacts. <br>  <br>  Yes, in grade 9. I switched schools for my friend to be with her, and I had a lot of friends at my other school, and I lost all of them to come to her school. Now at this school I have no friends, because I was just dragged into her crowd and they don't like me, I don't mind one of them but the rest of them honestly I hate a lot. They're rude to me, and talk about me, and yeah. I got really lonely and stopped going to school because of that, and I got into a really deep depression where I started cutting, and burning and isolating myself, and I tried to commit suicide, and was brought to the hospital by ambulance and then yay for rehabilitation centers. I still go to that school and I still have no friends but whatever it's about education not about friends. |`|dLt5mVHRaa	yeah i've thought about it. cause all i ever hear from people(aka my mom) is that i'm not skinny enough or pretty enough. that i'm a failure as a daughter. but i didn't try to do it cause then i would be make them happy i wasn't around i'd rather be here so i can tell them to f**k off|`|ovRzBsveaa	not seriously<br>  i thought once or twice what would ahppen if i did? should i do it and see but that was when my brain was OVERTIME and i was going mad. so it wasn't proper it was just negative thoughts coming into my head.|`|MVsre29Caa	yeah, and once a made a feeble attempt to do so with xanax. I'm glad it didn't work though, I just got real messed up and slept for about 3 days. I was just at a very low, low point in my life. Only like 2 people know about it though.|`|AtM1l8Bwaa	yes<br>  <br>  In middle school and first year of highschool i had terrible depression and i didn't like myself<br>  got made fun of a lot<br>  <br>  I never tried it but i did think about it a lot|`|AA11544445	yes. my own reasons, but i will say that i hit rock bottom and almost effed up the rest of my life. luckily i bounced back (somewhat).|`|0a4721ec2e22d992e6d7f2d6ce07cb8faa	yes, despair. i got over it, suicide is a permanant solution to a temporary problem!|`|AA11225724	years ago I hit a bit of a depression & thought about it only<br>  then I realized who would take care of my cat so I was able to come out of my black hour|`|Y8Suz0l3aa	No, suicide is a permanent solution to a temporary problem.|`|voyH3d1Kaa	Yes and I also tried<br>  <br>  It was stupid. Over some dumb pathetic guy.|`|VU97XJzfaa	Yes. Because I had no will to go on.|`|19UvhDRUaa	yea, i was really annoyed at somebody for saying something rather mean to me :(|`|Rxemh0bcaa	No<br>  casue i love to eat |`|fk1jeULRaa	Omg..No never :]<br>  I love me!|`|q2eNC9Pmaa	NO...  for some reason this question made me lol.|`|yfjQAaxdaa	nope u?|`|oBOZvnG0aa	My question to that would be yes !  The reason why is because that when you grew up the kids that grew up with you they made fun of you and when you get older you don't forget how you were treated and how your friend made fun of you and when you go to school and then you try to make friends they even made fun of you and that isn't easy to forget neather so yea people have killed themselfs because of there past or someone wanted them to hurt themselfs so badly and they thought it was funny or fun to do that..|`|2e1eff382ea984e31dfa5e8174e7db54aa	yes..<br>  Plently of times...<br>  like when i was completely heartbroken, when i hated myself, when my friends went against me, when i felt no one cared...<br>  But i'm 15 and people say it's ''normal'' for teenagers to feel depressed at times.  I think i had more that just ''normal depression''|`|hutoPgliaa	Many a time, especially at this time of year.<br>  Twice this month already, though I normally stop popping pills and talk to someone.<br>  Reason ? I suffer from SAD, and I'm also going through a very rough patch in my life at the moment.|`|AA10010096	Yes, most people have... thinking about and planning are 2 completely different things. I would never try it because I have too much to live for - my family, my friends, the world around me.|`|x6t1Xs32aa	No even though I have had thoughts to running away but before I did I always thought...where would I go? then that would scare me and I would stay even though it ment depression. I have never cutmyself eather.(well once)|`|UQGRN0iVaa	I have gone through severe anxieties kind of like agoraphobia and I am now on paxil (no more anxieties, yay!)<br>  But not once did I ever seriously want to kill myself<br>  |`|uiSaLy0Haa	yes<br>  it was exactly on July 4<br>  i had too many problems<br>  especially with my mom<br>  |`|adsMqst8aa	Only whilst watching High School Musical, for obvious reasons.|`|6x3DUECtaa	Yes, but those were just thoughts running through my mind. I would never actually act on them.
VU7YIW5haa	The show is going to hell. Zach and Kendall may be breaking up.|`|NGNeT3rYaa	Dealing with Greenlee's death, Zach and Kendall's marriage is falling apart. Krystal married David.Little A drank JR's booze,Reese is now blind after falling through a table, David still plotting to take LIttle A and Amanda still trying to hide the baby is David's/|`|6wsGQ1NCaa	Ok so Kendall drove Greenlee of a cliff (classic.) and now everyone is dealing with her death (not proven yet), Bianca went back to Paris because Reese got drunk because of something Kendall said, and kissed Zach. Krystal and David got married, but there was a pre-up.<br>  JR found out that Amanda was paid by David to get JR drunk, but still doesn't know David's the father of the baby. Also, Krystal found that out too, and hopefully finally realized what a snake David is. Lol. Also, Kendall asked Zach to get rid of Reese, so Zach went to the Chandler Mansion (where Reese is currently staying) and started pulling her out, and she pushed back and fell in some glass, which got into her eyes. Then she was rushed to the hospital, and currently can't see and blames it on Zach. (good.)<br>  I think that's it except Opal had some vibes that Greenlee's in trouble, possibly alive.|`|ADBMrG87aa	Aidan and Tad investigated Annie's shrink Dr. Sinclair and Aidan finally figured out what and why Dr. Sinclair was so deadset on getting Annie to confess her guilt over the murder of brother Ritchie.  The reason Dr. Sinclair was so obsessed with Annie is because the good doctor was in love with Ritchie and blames Annie for murdering Ritchie.  Annie snuck out of the psychiatric facility and went to the place where Ryan/Greenlee and Reese/Bianca were going to have their dual wedding.  While Annie was peeking through a window at the wedding party at the rehearsal dinner; Aidan grabbed her and took her back to the psychiatric hospital.  Then Aidan confronted Dr. Sinclair and told her what he knew about her, Dr. Sinclair said that she would reassign Annie to another doctor and immediately transfer out but Dr. Sinclair didn't do that; instead she took a tire wrench to Annie and a syringe to kill Annie but somehow Annie escaped.   <br>  <br>  Ryan while at the wedding chapel had a sudden rush of pompous self righteousness and blurted out to Greenlee that he can't bear having to stand next to Reese at his wedding.  That started the domino effect of hell.  He told Greenlee about Zack/Reese kiss at the rehearsal dinner and that Zack was having an affair.  Greenlee jumped on a motorcycle and raced back to the chapel to confront Zack about it but unfortunately Kendall and Zack were already on the road and Kendall was driving and took a sharp corner too wide and ran Greenlee right off the road and into a raging river and Greenlee's body was never recovered so she's presumed dead.<br>  <br>  Ryan then tells everyone else that Zack and Reese are having an affair and Bianca tells Reese that their marriage is over and she's going to get their marriage annulled and Bianca packed up both kids and left Reese.  Reese decided to stay in Pine Valley even though no one wants her there including Zack but she chose to remain anyways.  <br>  <br>  Amanda found out that she's pregnant and the baby is David Hayworth's baby.  Amanda begged her doctor (Angie/Jessie's son) to keep her secret and protect the child from David so the doctor changed the medical records to reflect a different delivery expectancy date.  Jake is also in on the falsification of medical records to protect Amanda's unborn child.<br>  <br>  Krystal kept hemming and hawing about who she really wants to be with (Tad or David or both) so Tad made her mind up for her and kicked her out the door so the Hoe went and moved in with David.  David the evil snake that he is; somehow manages to torment Amanda constantly and uses Amanda to cajole JR Chandler into doing things that he shouldn't be such as getting drunk.  Finally JR's son drank a glass of booze that JR left sitting on a table and Krystal found him passed out on the floor so she called the paramedics; Adam accused her of conspiring with David Hayworth to make JR look like an unfit parent so Krystal ran back home to David and told David that he was absolutely right about the Chandlers and everybody else (she's a stupid hoe).  <br>  <br>  Adam took Reese in when she was kicked out of Kendall's house after Bianca declared the marriage was over.  Adam escorted Reese to the Campbell's Healthy Heart Go Red Ball and of course that pissed off alot of people including Erica Cain.  Reese while at the ball overheard Kendall and Zack talking about who was really driving that night when Greenlee got run off the road and of course Reese went home with Adam and told him what she had overheard (like the beeyitch hasn't done enough damage while she's in town so far).  Zack and Kendall found out that Reese had overheard them and confronted her about it and she said that she doesn't plan to use it against them but then Adam interjected and said that he's got no problem using it against them.<br>  <br>  Zack and Kendall makes love at home and Reese shows up and looks through the glass door and of course Kendall saw her watching her and Zack.<br>  Zack goes to the Chandlers residence and tried to get Reese out of the house by pulling at her but she pulled away and fell through a glass table and glass damaged her eyes and she is now blind, maybe temporarily though and Zack feels so guilty that he told Kendall that he's going to be by Reese's side while she's in the hospital even though Kendall forbids it.  So Kendall had to go to Greenlee's memorial without her husband Zack.   Everyone except for Aidan shared their memories of Greenlee at the memorial.  Aidan went back to the psychiatric hospital to tell Annie that he realized that he no longer loves Greenlee and then he kissed Annie.<br>  <br>  (\__/)<br>  (='.'=)<br>  (")-(")<br>  Sweetie

hIAKXlsNaa	Hello.  It comes on at 9pm on the East coast, rite after Cops is over.  Saturday nights.  You could always check on tvguide.com to find out when shows air in your location.  :^)
W1MRXpc8aa	It is not known for sure nor has it ever been mentioned or discussed.<br>  It is known that at first it was not too popular so maybe they decided they were only to make four episodes and see how their audience would react and to see how big or small it was as well.<br>  The audience responded strong since they stayed strong till the 6th season due to low advertising revenue.

zHL6LRejaa	when i was little i walked in on my parents having sex....gross i know<br>  <br>  scarred me for life|`|TnQwq7fqaa	do u really want to know?|`|dpRsbyGjaa	I walk into the bathroom where my ex mother in law was naked getting out of the shower, she was so embarr-assed|`|nt0zKZXdaa	Myy parents going hard in a round of sex...It was more embarassing for them.  I just thought yuck, stop it now you foul beasts...|`|pCdaflCZaa	When i was in school my two out of three of my roomies were bi and I walked in on her and her g/f ....yuck good thing they were under the covers but it was still gross!|`|un4FowM5aa	Just going to the bathroom.
sJs0nuTSaa	I can't choose between Elizabeth and Sherri.  I agree that Sherri adds nothing to show, 2 comedians are enough.  Elizabeth, yeah she's smart, but her views are so 1 sided usually.  My biggest complaint with her would be when the others are complaining about whatever topic they're on (Republicans), she can't/won't admit that there's a problem without pointing out others (Democrats) faults.  And usually she'll focus on something that has nothing to do with the specific topic they're talking about.  They'll talk about the economy, and she'll point out that Clinton had affairs.  Something so off topic!  I love the looks that Whoopi gives her.|`|rabjcdjHaa	Barbara and Joy!|`|PCAlAoDsaa	Elizabeth because she thinks she know more about things then the other ladies.|`|AA11111233	I completely agree with you about Elisabeth, and her continuous harping on the Democratic party; all she cared about was kissing George Bush's ***.  She would fit in really well over at Fox News.  It will be a matter a time before she snaps and starts harping on Obama's "socialist" policies, screaming that America elected the wrong president, and she'll ONLY have Fox News to turn to when "The View" fires her.  Until then, Whoopi does a damn good job putting her in her place, or so I've heard.<br>  <br>  Elisabeth always finds something to kvetch about anyway.  One thing that's coming back is her protesting that a Wii game was calling kids fat.  To that, I say, big deal!|`|VAp5ICaBaa	I would definitely have to agree with you Sherri is my least favorite and like you said I don't agree with Elizabeth on anything really but at least she brings something to the show, I wish Sherri would stop talking about her "husband" too they're getting a divorce he's not your husband anymore|`|47e7f174343942df4985e92180812d30aa	ELIZABETH... she is one of the most rudest and hateful women in talk shows. Yes i agree she has her opinion of the Republician Party.. but come on .. you dont have to talk about it and argue every day about.. she always has to argue thinking she is the only one wit good points.. sorry to say..ur boring and rude. i love it when Joy and Whoopie put her in her place.. and shes having another baby.. who cares.. i know alot of people having kids.. maybe she having a contest wit the Octumom to see who has more..|`|vDzvDSQ0aa	This show gives woman a bad name!  They all talk over each other and interrupt and it is so irritating to watch...so I don't!  They sound like a bunch of seagulls squawking at the beach.  Terrible viewing!|`|5Pgs61ePaa	Sherri|`|6c519adeb7e7fde2ea538370b524d613aa	Elizabeth is annoying more than she is pregnant. <br>  Sjherry talks out of her a.. , half the time she can't even finish her sentences of ignorance.<br>  The other 3 are more tolerable to me.|`|4c53bf469dfe96ac19d353f625f2d1daaa	Elizabeth is like a robot spewing and yelling her points over everyone.|`|VkXQq2y2aa	Elizabeth for sure.|`|iAw1q6kbaa	they all annoy me|`|EPPb5pRBaa	Elisabeth is so annoying..|`|5a377f941722a4fff4ad0d165547bf6aaa	elizabeth|`|usIma0vIaa	Rosie O Donnell|`|AA10622783	They can all be annoying but Elisabeth Hasselbeck has them all beat by a mile.|`|AA12390047	If I could fire them this is the order they'd go:<br>  Sherri<br>  Joy<br>  Barbara<br>  WHoopi<br>  ELisabeth|`|9rLi9pSRaa	Sherri all the way. She is so stupid and if it wasn't for Whoopie helping her out she would look worse.  I almost fainted when she referred to herself as an actress like Whoopie.  HELLO get  a grip girl.  You are not an actress and you look so idiotic with those gigantic breasts that make you look like you are going to fall on your face.  Horrible.  And what's with the wigs?  Is she just lazy or bald or both.   She really should be replaced she is pulling the show way way down.

r8hBvWEQaa	well yes because <br>  1) Neither of them can sing<br>  2) Don't know a thing about talent<br>  3) don't care about signing anyone, just about their own publicity and money|`|fYcYPyR3aa	Not Cheryl because she has a really big personality and she is just cool and has a real opinion on things but she's pretty too so that probably helped, Dannii, yeah maybe, she's not a very good mentor and she looked good before the plastic surgery. I like her but not as much as Cheryl.|`|09z1t0cOaa	Well, I agree with it partially. Dannii is ugly, Cheryl is beautiful but thats not the only think they were hired for.|`|5KcUyLFRaa	Cheryl yes Danii no!!|`|zp9TkUCtaa	definately, they wouldnt have hired someone not pretty! they need good looking people otherwise nobody will watch|`|GAyy1wBgaa	Yeah, and it says a lot about the kind of show it is.|`|W6wamWLLaa	Yeh totally!!<br>  They wouldnt be there if they where ugly.|`|HL3cm1yGaa	Not there for the judging, that's for sure!!!!!!!|`|0789e50a1396d5b6b9138ceaad0e64f5aa	Goodness only knows what goes on in Simon Cowell's mind - I think he hires people to wind the others up - hence the reason he hired  Kelly brook for BGT to liven things up with Amanda Holden.  He likes to cause trouble to spice the programme up!  I agree with Beverley though that the show was much better with Sharon Osbourne but I don't mind Cheryl and think she is a good judge having gone through the experience herself.  Wish they would get rid of that hanger on Danni though and bring back Sharon!|`|FcHplZtQaa	Cheryl possibly, but Danni? she's nearly 40 FFS, maybe she was tottie for the middle agers|`|iqZUd5Fdaa	Dannii was only there to piss off Sharon. And Cheyrl was only brought in to piss off Dannii. The next judge will be another woman, younger and prettier than Cheryl|`|NmSSKnnWaa	must be blackmailing simon cowell.both cant sing and are nothing special to look at.|`|v0LWgN33aa	Well if they had a brain they'd be on Question time!|`|x5dXU8vWaa	yeah!<br>  why else!<br>  GOD FORBID it was 4 their singing skills!<br>  (that wasn't sarcastic!)

Personally anyone of their songs on their website, which happens to be on the fox news owned Myspace is going to be good and I would have a problem choosing the best. For good hardcore (I am talkin' pure old school), here are a few I recommend (which may or may not be on myspace) <br>  Limp Wrist - I Love Hardcore Boys/I Love Boys Hardcore<br>  <br>  Bad Religion - pretty much anything off of 80-85 there best most hardcore period in my opinion, though Eat your Dog, Faith In God and We're Only Gonna Die are some of my favorites.<br>  <br>  I Object! - Sick, Teaching Revenge or Feeding Off Ourselves is good<br>  You cannot have hardcore without mentioning the Bad Brains (said to be one of the first and also the first all black hardcore band):<br>  Banned in D.C., Not Tomorrow, Pay to *** or Sailin' on<br>  <br>  Minor Threat - Bottled Violence, Straight Edge, Screaming At A Wall<br>  <br>  Gorilla Biscuits - Two Sides, Good Intention or Hold Your Ground<br>  <br>  If you like Power Violence:<br>  Charles Bronson - Eazy E's Fuc king Dead and I Think It's Funny, Marriage Can Suck it, Diet Root Beer or Fck Technology I'll Keep My Pocket Change<br>  Capitalist Casualties - Drug Culture, Fck the Christians or Live For Today, Not Tomorrow<br>  <br>  I could probably go on but this is a decent list|`|e9dHHGCSaa	Emmure<br>  Every Time I die<br>  Atreyu<br>  Blindside<br>  Genghis Tron<br>  Hatebreed<br>  In Flames<br>  Killswitch Engage<br>  Motley Crue<br>  <br>  Just pick something.|`|LaSNOWYWaa	Bring me the horizon<br>  The Devil Wears Prada<br>  Alesana<br>  Drop Dead Gorgeous<br>  Innerpartysystem<br>  <br>  I love those bands,you can check them out if youu want?|`|LehwOrSIaa	iwrestledabearonce - Ulrich Firelord<br>  Attila - Soda in the Water Cup|`|XvQNDgHYaa	Funbus -Buckethead & Friends<br>  Botnus - Buckethead & Friends<br>  We Are One - Buckethead & friends

B6CzC2BDaa	No. Wear whatever you want.  Rock music would never have thrived if it were not so accepting of individuality.  <br>  <br>  If someone is worried about looking like a "newb" than they probably are one.  We were all new to the scene once.|`|3b1f171c73bb2e24acbb7271e47a68faaa	There has always been this debate..... I tend to think it's ok, but others think it's cheesy.  <br>  I guess it depends on the band... for example I went to a RUSH concert last summer, and it is pretty impressive when you see a dude wearing a Rush "1973 world tour" shirt that's vintage that he bought at the show in '73.  you know? <br>  but like, modern day bands... Id tend to think it's cheesy to wear their band shirt to their concert.|`|WbMxgSXLaa	No.. not really. I mean I show up to a lets say Megadeth show with an Iron Maiden tee, then I buy a shirt of the band that's performing, and wear that the rest of the night, over my Iron Maiden shirt|`|9hFexadLaa	What? Wear whatever the **** you want. It's a concert.<br>  <br>  EDIT: to an AC/DC concert I wore and AC/DC shirt, but to a Foo Fighters concert I wore a Nirvana shirt... and I wasn't a noob|`|rXlyHk1Raa	I have heard that too. I don't really think it matters though. Its probably better to do that then wear another band's shirt, like go to a Megadeth concert wearing a Metallica shirt and have Dave Mustaine see you|`|t7U9rliVaa	I don't get why everyone says that, it seems logical to me that if I was going to see a band I like, I'd want to wear some merch of theirs.  Apparently I'm a minority.

vuCo9wZZaa	I just watched it on HULU last night.  It came down to Jay and Andrea as each team (or top chef from the team that night which were LA and Giovanni) had to nominate one person.  Andrea really messed up the meat and burned a bunch of wellingtons and Jay served raw chicken.  <br>  <br>  Ramsay pulled the old switcheroo though - he sent them both back in line and sent home Colleen, (the one who owns the cooking school) because he said she's been a mess for all of the services and there was no place he could put her where she didn't mess up.  But, he did pay her a compliment on her tenacity and off she went.  She was on desserts and she sent out a raw pear in pastry dessert...and when Ramsay asked her if she could tell the difference between raw and cooked she froze.<br>  <br>  On another note, Bobby (real name Robert, the very large guy with the waxed eyebrows) apparently has some demons from his past with his father who goes by the name Bobby and everytime Ramsay called Robert Bobby, Robert looked like he was going to grab Ramsay and slam his face into a hot fry pan.  But Robert talked to Ramsay about it in private and Ramsay apologized and obviously won't be hitting that hot button unless ratings are really low and he needs to get his butt kicked.|`|uDsXjzwjaa	Colleen. She wasn't even one of the choices the team's suggested. The Chef just didn't like her!|`|edfdff1b394adf596b640ca3043fb1d4aa	coleen was eliminated- chef said that she was really strong and that he could break her down but not strong enough in the kitchen.|`|8NvIh3Rtaa	u watched cool me to but i missed so i can tell u srry|`|RtHBnYSmaa	Colleen

sFxpYbmzaa	io per costituzione sono alta e magra...h:1.80 kg:45,c'è chi crede che io sia anoressica sopratutto i miei genitori,che mi hanno portata in vari centri pe ri disturbi alimentari,per fortuna che i dottori quando mi hanno visitata e mi hanno messo a confronto con le persone che avevano davvero questo disturbo hanno capito che non avevo nulla,e adesso mi trattano  normalmente,ma vedere quelle ragazze in quell'istituto è stato toccante e doloroso,vedere fino a che punto la mente umana arriva a ridurre il corpo pur di essere come altri,io non sono contro chi è magra,perkè alcune come me potrebbero esserlo di costituzione(parlo delle modelle),ma non sono d'accordo con ki si ammazza per essere come noi,io mi accetterei anche se avessi qualche kilo in più,e anzi mi sono accorta che la gente apprezza ki ha un pò di rotondità in più,perkè ki è come me viene la maggior parte delle volte considerata anoressica|`|6QeNMyfCaa	bello...mi piace...ed io ke ne ho sofferto sono contenta di vedere persone che ci tengono a salvare ragazzi da questa malattia.......di certo non è bella pubblicità eleggere Miss Italia la ragazza + magra di tutte quelle ke hanno partecipato.......dovrebbero essere tutti a dare un contributo!grazie cmq un bacio!|`|L1SqXg8maa	Penso che sia impressionante sapere che ne esistono anche di peggio...è una malattia terribile e il manifesto dovrebbe far pensare soprattutto quelli che propongono la magrezza quotidianamente su tutti i giornali, come se fosse bella.VERGOGNA!!!|`|UgWhPjKKaa	"abbastanza" impressionante.....!!!!! bello!!!!|`|W3iBzxluaa	E' un grande.<br>  purtroppo questa è la realtà. ci sono ragazze ma anche signore in queste condizioni. La foto serve a non nascondere ciò che il mondo può provocare.<br>  Spero che questo manifesto serva a qualcuno per capire e per agire.|`|YKDJCnyRaa	è terribile da guardare...ma rende l'idea di quello ke può succedere se si cade nelle grinfie di questa orribile malattia....|`|enTV6zktaa	volevano attirare l'attenzione e ci sono riusciti... solo questo gli importava...|`|l7wY3tOHaa	ogni volta che mi affaccio dal balcone me lo ritrovo davanti(l'hanno attaccato proprio di fronte casa) quindi direi contro...|`|qKRLTu3caa	Io sono a favore.

L'immagine è fortissima, mette a disagio sicuramente, ma non credo metta a disagio le persone giuste, poi quando ci si abituerà alla vista del cartellone, nessuno ci farà più caso e anche questa iniziativa finirà nel dimenticatoio. O perlomeno è quello che credo, spero di essere smentito dai fatti al più presto!<br>  Ciao!|`|30ecc3b60d382b9269e389f98f7c40f2aa	fa veramente senso!! è troppo secondo me tanto ki è fissato anke vedendolo nn cambierà facilmente idea!!|`|7f639a0849d86aa1f5a700752bb91c09aa	Caspita se è impressionante...|`|329345e5cf9c2f866afb99cdd006794faa	Già detto e ripetuto.

(che poi bella non è, è solo pura malattia, mentale e fisica)<br>  <br>  impressionante il manifesto. serve a far riflettere.|`|Mzh3SG8Daa	non amo la pubblicità di toscani trovo che sia troppo esplicita ed esasperata...ed alla fine non arriva a nulla se non far parlare di lui...|`|YJOo916Raa	L'ho visto oggi per la strada, effettivamente ha suscitato qualche interesse qua al lavoro..<br>  Erano tutti abbastanza disgustati dall'immagine..<br>  i "creatori" hanno voluto dare un impronta FORTE al problema; e solo così avranno l'attenzione!<br>  Molti cartelloni pubblicitari, compreso questo, farebbero bene ad evitarli per le strade.. molti di loro sono la principale causa di sconcentramento alla guida!|`|ZxKIHQ7kaa	è un pò forte, ma penso ke sia giusto ke sia così...|`|a074281e13edda5b391bfec182b42d42aa	davvero scioccante.<br>  spero aiuti a riflettere.|`|gWo7ygRpaa	mi fa tanta pena e mi dispiace... queste sono malattie mentali.... tutta colpa del mondo intero....|`|tJ1Jybw0aa	Sicuramente è una campagna-shock che serve per catturare l'attenzione e quindi per far riflettere seriamente su questa vera e propria malattia psicologica devastante....E' una piaga sociale che affligge tantissime donne per i più svariati motivi: una perdita improvvisa, la mancanza di autostima, la volontà di entrare a tutti i costi nei canoni di bellezza odierni (veline, miss, modelle anoressche stile kate moss....)<br>  Quindi secondo me questo manifesto è giusto, perchè a volte serve uno scossone che faccia ridestare le coscienze per farci riflettere su un problema serio e, a mio parere, poco combattuto, soprattutto nelmondo dello spettacolo........<br>  Un saluto.

hvqZJQX1aa	Obama<br>  Obama<br>  Obama|`|a8878aa5ea57903ab8121a0f2f95b0ceaa	Obama.|`|d19ea35205cd660a24bf63de535e5a19aa	I would be supporting McCain if he had a better vice choice. Palin as the vice of a 72 year old cancer survivor scares me...<br>  <br>  McCain is better for the overall economy, but Obama is better for individuals, those are the fundamental differences. <br>  <br>  I do think the middle class SHOULD get tax breaks, but I think tax breaks for the higher corporations would stimulate the economy more and create more jobs. Before we start focusing on the middle class, we should focus on bringing down that unemployment rate so there is more of a middle class to help. <br>  <br>  McCain is better for businesses, and as a person who is going to get into business in the next three years I can support him on those policies. By lowering taxes, he's allowing corporations to create more jobs and lower the unemployment rate.<br>  <br>  I think both of their foreign policies are flawed. We can't pull out from Iraq yet. We should still be there, but we need to reduce spending GREATLY and focus more money and troops on Afghanistan. Neither of the candidates are offering that though. Obama wants to pull out of Iraq and increase spending and troops in Afghanistan, and McCain wants to leave Iraq the same WHILE raising spending in Afghanistan. Both are flawed. Obama meeting with other middle east leaders without preconditions is not a very wise thing either, McCain being overly cautious with preconditions is flawed too. He wouldn't meet with Spain! I don't like either of their foreign policies. And don't get me started on their Iran policies.<br>  <br>  Obama has a better energy plan, alternative energy sources will create tons of new jobs and we can export these alternative energies and make money.<br>  <br>  Obama has the better health care and education plan, that's for sure.<br>  <br>  These are the main things you should focus on, and I support both of them on a lot of these things, more so for Obama though.<br>  <br>  You also have to take in account the vice choices and the risk of death. McCain is 7 times more likely to die in office than Obama. I really don't think Palin is ready for presidency or vice presidency. Biden on the other hand, is ready to not only be vice, but to lead this country in the event of something happening to Obama.<br>  <br>  Out of the two, I'd say I support Obama more than McCain, but I'm not opposed to McCain entirely.|`|5i72XXkvaa	Neither!

I think everyone is entitled to their own opinion.<br>  <br>  And there is no way that the Jonas Brothers are any better than me or you simply because they make more money than me. I mean, I know a ton of guys around me who are complete gentlemen and they aren't famous singers - they're my neighbors and my best friends.<br>  <br>  Who said chivalry was dead? They are wrong...but just because you're chivalrous doesn't mean you'll automatically get all the girls. You also have to have a brain, goals, and responsibility - and while I'm sure the J.B. have brains and goals and are responsible beings, they are still teenagers and are still deciding what they want to do for the rest of their life.<br>  <br>  Okay, I hope this answers your question|`|jcj8ID7Caa	LMAO WOW, you act like you know them in real life. LOL sorry, but sorry all you know is an act after all they are control by Disney and Disney star must keep up the act of being good boys and girls. Once they leave Disney they may turn out differently just take a look at Brittney Spear, Justin Timberlake, and Lindsey Lohan. They aren't as pure as you use to think they were when they were the children of Disney. LOL<br>  <br>  Also the Jones Brothers do kind of suck because I just can't take them seriously. Mostly because their target audience are preteen girls. And also their music careers  is control by Disney which have to make everything rated G. Just lack substance and originality and seem like they can be replace by musicians who can play better and who are much better looking. I'm sure you girls out there may think they are all that and would think you would miss them  a lot but once someone better comes a long with better looks and music talents then the Jones Brother would be just a fade memory. <br>  <br>  Kind of happen with me when boy bands were popular and the Back Street Boys and Nsync were cool. Now I just think they were so corny and I don't even know why I like them in the first place.|`|08TxGQ6daa	Well first of all,they are a teen girl fad,and girls that like the jonas brothers have no respect for musical talent,when you start jumping up and down while crying when you see them on tv its not becuase theyre good musically,its because you think theyre hot, the 90's had backstreet boys, now its the jonas brothers no difference,i have nothing against them,i just dont like theyre music,i just dont like how girls become overly OBSESSED to the point its not even healthy,dont worry you'll grow out of it in a few years....i hope|`|1gFXB5nvaa	they hate because their hot, hot hot, Famous,rich,popualr, every girl wants them.<br>  Their basically jealous of their talent,money, and looks<br>  kinda like girls were when hannah montana came out<br>  everyone said the same thing<br>  she dont perform live lipsing,lesbo,shes ugly<br>  because the girls were jealouss since she was getting all the guys attention.<br>  |`|IlKumNPuaa	Because they straighten their hair, they love shopping they have girls who are just friends..Ahem...and this is absolutely not gay<br>  They started singing about girls when they were like 9, and they dress like a war veteran rich *** grandfather...lol...ahem I sense some possing wanna-beaszzzz<br>  And girls are just too annoying about them<br>  i mean seriously freshmen in my school are so goddamn annoying and everyime I try watching what's left of the last days of TRL there are some frickin' 8 year olds making my ear drum bleed....and my neighboor is a 8 year old girl....so Yeah now you know why I'm so annoyed with them.......<br>  Why can't people just be real and not someone else for the camera<br>  Ugh....no give me my 2 points<br>  yay<br>  lolzzz<br>  omfg i love my zzzzs today<br>  yayzzzzzzz!|`|b3ID1NbUaa	they are all jealous =D they hate seeing JB go and get stuff out of their lives, have girls falling over them, etc, even when JB have stuff hard (Nicks diabetes etc)<br>  <br>  If they hate obsessive fans, WHY DO THEY GO ON JB QUESTIONS JUST TO COMPLAIN??????????????<br>  <br>  That annoys me so much.|`|YUugeUHxaa	Guys hate the Jonas Brothers so much because we get tired of typing "because they R gay" in response to all of your questions.

Go listen to bands that a more musically talented rather than following this dumb band.<br>  <br>  On a side note this is musical talent... Compare that to the Jonas Brothers...

They wish they were better than normal guys.  Their music is gay. No guy wants to listen to boy bands anymore.

And like someone else said. It is also cause we hate hearing all the retarded things retarded fans say about them.|`|ccN7uNiWaa	Hi!

If they know little girls who are 12 are on here they should keep their dirty words to themselves. Why be so negative? <br>  Yes, the fans have the most annoying and repetitive questions ever. Not to mention the horrendous grammar and punctuation but if they can't handle themselves then they should just start ignoring. If they stop eventually the questions will stop because they won't be the hot target everyone is talking about.<br>  <br>  So let's just work together and cooperate. <br>  'Cause not only have the haters gone wild but so are the true, loyal JB fans. |`|sz1YqwUEaa	Beofre i get to tearing down your favorite band let me say your A Sexist And Facist. <br>  1. they Really don't play live they do use their Recorded versions which is why they wont Release a Live album like so MANY of their fans have asked.<br>  2. even if they did play live Doesn't matter its three basic notes anyone with 10 minutes of guitar experience could do<br>  3.

OP8sRCbTaa	I would recommend starting off playing around with GarageBand.  I have friends who have recorded full songs using just GB and the built in computer mic, and they sound great for ammature stuff.  If you don't want to use the computer mic though, I'd say to go with a 57.  They are the most basic and versatile microphone.  Probably the best choice for a beginner.<br>  <br>  For editing videos, I think you should go with iMovie.  It's very easy to use, and it's not too expensive.. (unless you have a Mac, in which case it is free).  Plus it is just as professional as Avid or Final Cut Pro, and most times you can't even tell the difference.<br>  <br>  Then when you get a little older, if you're still interested in the recording arts, there are a lot of schools with excellent Telecommunications programs.  The possibilities are truly endless.

qVXmSEVGaa	We classical singers are aware of three or four different voice levels or registers.  You are comfortable in oyur low register ( also known as chest), and seem to be able to manage the first portion of your middle voice.  You are experiencing a register change at just about the right place for an alto. the A/B above middle C is where most altos make the final change into high register ( head voice). <br>  ( By the way, the fourth register will happen a whole octave above that, and is known as whistle register, which more or less corresponds to a man's falsetto. Mariah Carey used to use this high thin light sound to great effect early on in her career. Listen to a couple of her first recordings. It takes lots of training to get up there, and usually altos don't get intot hat part of theri voices very often. Don't fret about it, just use what you've got to the best of your ability)<br>  What you need to learn to do is add more energy ( not air, not strength) from your breath support muscles around your waist.<br>  If you happen to sing in a chorus, I'd recommend you ask the director for some more explanation. If you are really curios, why not investigate some lessons?<br>  Getting through the "break" is like learning to change gears in a stick-shift car.  You learn to hear the motor, and feel the revs.  We singers base our knowledge of our own register changes on how it feels, and how it sounds, so getting to know this about your voice can only make it that much easier.<br>  "singing for dummies" actually has a lot of good info in it, if you care to read. For more intense information, there are tons ( really, by weight, tons) of books out there on the subject.<br>  By the way, I applaud your modesty and sensibility in not posting a clip. Using a recording for learning purposes is very intense ( in that is is so dreadfully honest), but posting every burp or wheeze is not necessarily an art work.|`|WvTOsy4Uaa	It may be your head voice, which is not developed yet. If it sounds airy, singers would tell you to lift your soft palette, which is in the back of your mouth. This allows for a higher sound and a clearer sound. My teacher suggests feeling like your about to yawn. This feeling is lifting your soft palette. Try singing your piece again, but with the yawning sensation. It should produce a clearer sound.

ebe9af0dbeaeb8a4623c52d9fc71c05faa	The producers over at the SciFi Channel LUCKED OUT, and hired possibly one of the best composers alive today. A younger guy named Bear Mc Creary.<br>  <br>  The Shape of Things to Come which builds very slowly and then kinda grows on you as it gets more complex : <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tII1DSHPU80" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tII1DSHPU...</a><br>  <br>  His music well and truly elevates the entire series, making it something much more than it would be without it.<br>  <br>  That said, there are many pieces which are really good in many ways.<br>  <br>  Some other choices , here another modern piece which is classical in the technical sense but is much more modern in/ from a composition perspective <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FvbCV6E0Wro" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FvbCV6E0W...</a><br>  <br>  When I first heard Mahler's 1st Symphony I didn't really appreciate it until many years later when I understood the technical idea of counterpoint which is REALLY hard to achieve This is from the Symphony #1, Titan - movement #2 : <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DVYZluRnFwM" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DVYZluRnF...</a><br>  <br>  But what's important is to keep you ears open to classical music and you find it everywhere, so the recent Batman movie has a choral work which is from a band composed by Hans Zimmer but which is VERY similar to many other composers, one group in particular called "E.S. Posthumus" but many major movie composers, Danny Elfman, Hans Zimmer, Richard Gibbs and others and others have been or has heavily influenced along these lines , which is featured very prominently in many recent movies such as Spiderman, Constantine, Batman etc to the point where it's almost cliche : <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vlP49A8kXyE" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vlP49A8kX...</a> or this from ES Posthumus - <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoaUYcwEpSw&feature=related" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoaUYcwEp...</a><br>  <br>  In fact MANY of the classical pieces stem from works which were not originally so the band Juno Reactor (Benjamin Watkins), produced pieces much like this from - The Matrix - <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t9qqLrdOzDg" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t9qqLrdOz...</a> - but like John Williams and MANY modern composers he is capable of a wide range of work. <br>  <br>  There is a the movie previously produced but which HEAVILY influenced the Matrix called "Dark City" which had a strictly classical sound-track but which was every bit as Chaotic as any you might think of.<br>  <br>  Personally, while this is interesting, I like finding music that is really good in unexpected places.<br>  <br>  Consider this teaser produced by the very talented "Track Team" who produced the Soundtrack for the children's  television show "Avatar - The Last Airbender" - <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QmKhbVBezdg," rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QmKhbVBez...</a> while not available as part of an official - due to a contract clause, some elements of the soundtrack clearly indicate these guys might be worth keeping an eye on.|`|obGQ2Bqfaa	Berlioz..Symphonie Fantastique|`|PS0oSoXFaa	I just answered this for someone else, you could look there too (a little higher up on this page):<br>  <br>  Most symphonies and concertos have particular movements that are faster and others that are slower. But yes, Beethoven's fifth on the whole is fast and powerful. Make sure you listen to the third and esp. fourth movements too, not just the famous first.<br>  <br>  Beethoven in general is what you're looking for, and almost every symphony is great and has fast movements. You can start with the fourth movement of his Sixth Symphony ("Thunderstorm"), second movement of his 9th and the final movement of his third. The third movement of his fifth piano concerto is also upbeat (but don't skip over the slow and gorgeous second movement). And the third piano concerto is great, too, I love it!<br>  <br>  If you want upbeat symphonies Dvorak's New World Symphony is hard to beat. And I know you asked for symphonies and concertos, but one of the most rhythmic pieces in classical music (in my opinion) is Schumann's piano quintet. You can start with the final movement and with the second trio of the third movement, but you've got to listen to the whole thing. The second movement is slow and beautiful, which the first is also very rhythmic. That piece is addictive :)|`|oSXgtqYCaa	John Adams' A Short Ride on a Fast Machine is a contemporary, fast-paced work that you might enjoy if you like contemporary classical music. His clarinet concerto, Gnarly Buttons, is also fast and a bit chaotic.<br>  <br>  The other writers sent you some wonderful options, and there are many to choose from. Remember that in most orchestral works, there are four movements (like chapters in a book), and each movement has its' own speed and character. As a general rule, the first and last movments are the fastest in terms of tempo, while the inner movements tend to be a bit slower. This holds true until 20th Century music, when those rules change somewhat!<br>  <br>  Have fun!|`|6LIBZ3nLaa	EDIT: NVM. The one I suggested is slow, but is still a good song.

qVXmSEVGaa	what we classical singers do is raise the soft palate, that spongy muscle group on the roof at the back of your mouth.  If you get a big mirror ( big enough to see your whole face in) and stnad where there's plenty of light, you'll be able to see all the way back to the back wall of your mouth.  you'll see the uvula, the little punching bag, hanging down from the soft palate.  When you just start to yawn ( when the big inrush of air happens) you'll see the uvula shoot up. that's a sign that the whole soft palate is moving upwards as well. If you play "surprised", you'll see the same effect. This muscle group is very much under our direct control, so you can learn to let it shoot up, and hang back down with a little practice.<br>  The trick is now to become aware of this while you are singing.  It's not a quick procedure;  it takes some concentration and practice.<br>  By the way, the trick of holding your nose shut is an excellent way of making sure that the sound is not in your nose.  If you feel vibration or pressure against your fingers ( holding your nose shut) then you know the sound is in your nose.  After you have practised using an elevated soft palate, double check by holding your nose yet again. The sound should feel as well as ring inside your mouth.|`|CRDl9nffaa	Lynndramsop's answer is very informative. It's all about learning to feel where the resonances and sound are coming from as she says.<br>  <br>  A quick way that can help start you on that path, and start to get you projecting using your mouth, is to turn your speaking voice into your singing voice as follows<br>  <br>  Hold the back of your hand flat and close to your mouth so you can feel the air on it when you breathe out of your mouth. <br>  <br>  Now start talking, with a simple phrase or a line from a song. Push each word out sharply so you can feel the air on your hand. <br>  <br>  Slowly introduce more of a musical note into the words, but keep that breath coming out onto your hand.<br>  <br>  Get more and more tuneful until eventually you're singing the line with the sound coming out of your mouth. You need to be able to feel that breath!<br>  <br>  It's not going to come quickly, because you're undoing a lifelong habit. But stick with it, though it will feel weird at first.<br>  <br>  Foucs on the physical feelings in your mouth and your head when you start to get it right. That will help you unlock the secret. Good luck!|`|gDh1t1Yyaa	I totally know what you mean. Hold your nose and try and find a place where your voice sounds fine and not to nasly.|`|AA10227539	Why are you asking US to help you with a question that your mom canno't explain?

But yes, the fifth ont he whole is fast and powerful. Make sure you listen to the third and esp. fourth movements too, not just the famous first.<br>  <br>  Beethoven in general is what you're looking for, and almost every symphony is great and has fast movements. You can start with the fourth movement of his Sixth Symphony ("Thunderstorm"), second movement of his 9th and the final movement of his third.  The third movement of his fifth piano concerto is also upbeat (but don't skip over the slow and gorgeous second movement). And the third piano concerto is great, too, I love it!<br>  <br>  If you want upbeat symphonies Dvorak's New World Symphony is hard to beat. And I know you asked for symphonies and concertos, but one of the most rhythmic pieces in classical music (in my opinion) is Schumann's piano quintet. You can start with the final movement and with the second trio of the third movement, but you've got to listen to the whole thing. The second movement is slow and beautiful, which the first is also very rhythmic. That piece is addictive :)|`|13ZYxG0Aaa	how about the dear friends tours. oh god i'd kill to see them. i'm sure you've heard of final fantasy.. lol. look up one winged angel.|`|hcNXuFCJaa	For you I have the best answers!<br>  <br>  Shostakovitch Finale from Symphony no.5<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlXfiTqREAw" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlXfiTqRE...</a><br>  <br>  Finale From Bruckner's 8th Symphony.

24UPDIBTaa	The previous answers mentioned (how each series related to time): <br>  <br>  The Butterfly Effect (like the movie but never aired on Sci Fi or elsewhere, by the way)<br>  <br>  Lost (a big component of the current season is characters shifting through time while on the island)<br>  <br>  Terminator: Sarah Conner Chronicles (machines and people traveling back in time, the Connors traveled a little bit forward<br>  once)<br>  <br>  Heroes (character Hiro had ability to time travel, many have drawn the future, and season 3 has an episode called "The Butterfly Effect")<br>  <br>  Early Edition (newspaper arrives with tomorrow's news)<br>  <br>  Life on Mars (main character wakes up in the past).<br>  <br>  In addition, the original British version of Life on Mars spawned a similar series called Ashes to Ashes. NBC ran Quantum Leap about a man inventing a time machine then with his buddy, appearing as a hologram guide, tries to fix errors in time in order to leap to another person's life and time in hopes of making it back to his own. British series Dr. Who features the title character AKA "Last of the Time Lords" who can travel space and time. There's also the old soap opera Dark Shadows which employed all types of sci-fi elements, including time travel, and is being made into a movie by the duo of Tim Burton and Johnny Depp.<br>  <br>  The Butterfly Effect series idea has been around for a few years, but never completely realized. If that isn't what you were refering to, I think your best bet is the show NBC canceled after one season last year called Journeyman. He got headaches, vanished into thin air, ended up in the past and altered it. <br>  <br>  Any of those show plots or concepts fit what you overheard?|`|umEgRb7Vaa	Terminator: The Sarah Conner Chronicles.<br>  <br>  There is a series on the BBC called "Ashes To Ashes" which is a sequel to "Life On Mars".

AA12376180	I have never heard of a Sandner piano. It is not listed in the Pierce Piano Atlas. Is this a new piano? Knowing today's piano market I will hazard a guess and say this is one of the many pianos coming from China, Indonesia or some other Asian country. Most of these pianos get very low marks on materials used, quality of sound, touch and craftsmanship. If I was considering a piano for myself this would not be one of them.|`|vsy4QMHMaa	I had not heard of them until you mentioned the name. It looks like F. Sandner is a German company that imports from Asia and builds some instruments in Germany. <br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.franzsandner.de/en/pro_pa.asp?dk=0" rel="nofollow">http://www.franzsandner.de/en/pro_pa.asp...</a><br>  <br>  While the pianos wear a "Made in Germany" badge, I suspect that string backs, plates, keys and the lot are imported and final assembly is performed in Germany. If they follow the trend, actions are made by Renner, strings are probably German and felts may be German or English. <br>  <br>  However, if you swing to their home page, there is a direct link to August Forester ... which is (was?) a high quality German piano. Economies of scale (cheap labor) may have pushed everything over to Asia. <br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.franzsandner.de/index1.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.franzsandner.de/index1.htm</a><br>  <br>  ... I don't know what to think anymore.

In fact, Disney haven't actually said if the show was canceled, but J-5 teen magazine said that it was.<br>  So as far as we know, its probably dead, but it might be renewed, since they haven't said anything.|`|YXiuZ2Weaa	I'm pretty sure they canceled it because of low ratings. It was ok but pretty boring. They won't keep a show on if the ratings are low,sad but true.|`|Qj4zN2C4aa	It's still on Disney Channel. In the UK anyway.

Sounds like the Scorpio and Virgo woul work well. However, Virgo and Aquarius are not a compatible match.|`|bKpTiFuraa	Virgo female in a relationship with a Scorpio male. We've been together for 15 months so far and overall, it's really good. We essentially want the same thing from each other in terms of honesty, loyalty, stability, etc. We never run out of things to talk about even though he's not a talkative person. He makes me laugh all day and surprisingly, I do the same for him. We enjoy each other's company and I think that we complement each other in our similarities and our differences. What I don't have in my personality, he has to give me, and what he doesn't have, I have to give him. I read somewhere that Scorpio is ruled partly by Mars which covers passion, and I'm ruled my Mercury, which covers communication - and the two brought together build the foundation of all relationships: passion and communication. It's very true. He's a very emotional person and when he does something, he throws his entire heart into it. I'm different, I think with my head and throw my entire sense and logic into it. Together, instead of clashing, we fill in each other's empty spaces and I teach him to be more rational (like when he flips out because there's no food in the house and I point out to him that in twenty minutes, he can make a nice bowl of pasta) and he brings me out of my emotional shell. We admire key traits in each other: I love his intensity and determination (he even makes peanut butter and jelly sandwiches like his whole life depends on it), and he likes my practicality and intellect.<br>  <br>  The bad...he can be very selfish at times and I've come to realize that unlike me, he doesn't see being late as a bad thing. Coming late for me is like a physical attack, I can't deal with it. For him, it just doesn't faze him. And the fact that he's stubborn too makes it dififcult to get it through his thick head. Early on the relationship, not anymore, we didn't communicate as well because I was still trying to figure out that he's the type of person that needs time to "cool off" if he's mad and he was still trying to figure out that if there's an issue, I NEED to discuss it and resolve it.|`|Sk1aUrlfaa	Im virgo my hub is aquarius.

IsxB0Qi7aa	Here are some updates from March:<br>  <br>  March 2nd<br>  When Clint goes to Amber with a Katherine sighting, Gina spots him - and warns Amber to stay away (despite Amber feeling he's 'the key' to finding her) ...

But then, she started having flashbacks about her life as Katherine Chancellor. She then took a DNA test to match to Jill Abbott, which came back as negative (faulty test) Then, she was kidnapped by a guy named Clint, who kidnapped her before. They also took Kevin Fisher (Michael Baldwin's brother) and Esther Valentine (Mrs Chancellor's housekeeper, who married a guy named Roger Wilkes, a bigamist.) . Then Clint placed a bomb inside the motel where he was holding Esther and Katherine hostage. Amber Moore, Katherine's dear friend, found her and managed to get her and Esther untied. But then, the bomb went off and Katherine was still inside.She woke up in the hospital and she claimed that Jill, her daughter dropped her off for tests (which is what happened before the accident) so, all of a sudden, Katherine gets her memory back. Also, Kevin is still in the trunk of Clint's car. <br>  <br>  Nick, Sharon and Phyllis love triangle:<br>  Nick loves Sharon and Phyllis but keeps having small affairs with Sharon.<br>  <br>  Sharon:<br>  Keeps stealing things from people and then she doesn't know what shes doing.

AA11417199	mY OWN OBSERVATIONS...........coming from a Sagittarius girl<br>  Aries: idk, penetrating eyes, while walking their legs come forward first.<br>  Taurus: bull shape heads, flat faces, lazy eyes,girls are unique looking which can be beautiful.<br>  Gemini: sharp eyes, their eyes goes back and forth really fast, the guys usually have sharp face features<br>  Leo: guys can be handsome, slanted eyes, same thing with the girls. Athletic body usually.<br>  Virgo: youthful looking, full length hair, sophisticated.<br>  Libra: pretty face or graceful looking,.. that's about it lol<br>  Scorpio: dark or intense eyes, reptilian look. Usually have pale or a fair complexion skin.<br>  Sagittarius: bright eyes, horse or deer looking, so nice noses and innocent look<br>  Capricorn: Piercing eyes, cold looking, the guys look like goats if they let their facial hair grow...it's amazing to see that.<br>  Aquariuses: looks kind of confused all the time, vague looking eyes<br>  Pisces: EASY to spot usually, tired or faraway look in their eyes.. their eyes are liquid or teary, Slow hearing and speaking.|`|bvwYVGJOaa	Virgos are typically slim but im curvy and happy just wanna get rid of my belly!|`|NEw5dsJlaa	<a href="http://www.astrofaces.com/" rel="nofollow">http://www.astrofaces.com/</a>

Also it feels really weird walking around that place.|`|AE9dKMEFaa	just like anything that is filmed, the episodes do not run in sequence, when they outed derek it was most probably the last day of filming, but when the series was aired the episode could have been in the middle of the run, hence why derek was still in the last episode
Ow3O7h4caa	Aquarius people are humanitarians at best who value friendship above anything else. They are rebellious and unconventional which makes them original in their make-up, clothing etc....<br>  <br>  As for compatibility with Libra, both of you can be attracted to unusual people and to socializing. Should Aquarius go rushing off to help other s in need, Libra will tag only and will understand this. If Aquarius brings a down and out stranger home for the night, Libra won't mind and will accept it no questions asked. While there are some aspects of their personalities that will irritate the other, they will find it easier than most signs to compromise<br>  <br>  With another Aquarius, they will be compatible mentally and able to let oyur feelings show. This relationship is likely to grow due to the fact that you can mentally shift gears and stay in tune. Given that you are unsuited physically, you will not find this odd, or a reason to allow hostilities into your relationship, for sex does not play a big role in either one's life.<br>  <br>  With Gemini, sexual attraction with them is likely to be intense, as Aquarius finds Gemini to be very attractive physically. The response of Aquarius to Gemini in the initial involvement would be Gemini's versatility and need to communicate his or her feelings. Gemini loves a good debate which Aquarius cna bring to the table. It is possible for them to become completely absorbed in the others feelings and interests, as this would serve to stimulate the minds of both.|`|tGGVeW3yaa	Well all I know is that Aquarius is the enemy to pisces.

I am also a promoter for some hip hop artist yet you will never see me contradicting what I think of it. People tend to think that they would be accepted once they paint a silly mask. I don't buy it at all. It makes me sick to see young kids of a different race trying to be an image that they are not.

He had never missed a day and was never late. <br>  <br>  Consequently, when on one particular day 9 A.M. passed without Johnson's arrival, it caused a sensation. All work ceased, and the boss himself, looking at his watch and muttering, came out into the corridor. <br>  <br>  Finally, precisely at ten, Johnson showed up, clothes dusty and torn, his face scratched and bruised, his glasses bent. He limped painfully to the time clock, punched in, and said, aware that all eyes were upon him, "I tripped and rolled down two flights of stairs in the subway. Nearly killed myself." <br>  <br>  And the boss said, "And to roll down two flights of stairs took you a whole hour?" <br>  --------------------------------------...<br>  Reaching the end of a job interview, the Human Resources Person asked the young MBA fresh out of MIT, "And what starting salary were you looking for?" <br>  <br>  The candidate said, "In the neighborhood of $125,000 a year, depending on the benefits package." <br>  <br>  The HR Person said, "Well, what would you say to a package of 5-weeks vacation, 14 paid holidays, full medical and dental, company matching retirement fund to 50% of salary, and a company car leased every 2 years - say, a red Corvette?" <br>  <br>  The Engineer sat up straight and said, "Wow!!!

LrKCLZF7aa	You got half of it right. They are about sexual attraction but NOT about LOVE. Many people make the mistake that desire means love. This is not true. Venus rules many things like desire, infatuation, female sexuality, sense of humor, bringing together of two things but NOT love because that is ruled by Chiron.<br>  <br>  With good Chiron aspects this can be helpful but without them it's like getting shot by Cupids arrow and although the sex may be great it hurts. As getting shot by any arrow should.<br>  <br>  Now as far as the best aspects you have listed 2 of the best. There are also other aspects like parallel and contra-parallel. But even at a sextile, quincunx or semi-sextile there is still a great amount of attraction.<br>  <br>  If they are at a square or opposite then the attraction will still be strong but they won't get along well. However if there is more than one of these clashes then the actually turn into a combined sexual aspect stronger than any single 2 planet aspect.<br>  <br>  The Venus person would feel more than the Mars person as far as emotion goes. But physically the Mars person would feel more since Mars rules the body.

tGAt3ZKkaa	*I have done them all*<br>  <br>  get a bin and fill it half way with water, and lean it up against someones front door and knock.<br>  When they open the door they will have wet carpet. ha ha<br>  <br>  If someone is growing grass in their yard, in the middle of the night get fertilizer and spell out on their grass in huge letters "sh*t!"<br>  when the grass grows out, the fertilizer will grow a nice dark green sh*t for them.<br>  <br>  Have a bunch of friends over and watch t.v, when someone gos to the bathroom, put on a prerecorded tape of the bathroom on and when you hear the flush signal everyone to laugh and when your friend comes out they will think you guys were watching them in the bathroom.<br>  <br>  Put hair removal cream in someone's conditioner. <br>  <br>  Here is a good prank that played on my sister. What you do is take baby powder and you put it in someone's blow-dryer. When they turn it on, they will get a head full of powder. It is a great laugh. <br>  <br>  <br>  This one friend of mine told me about a DVD porn he bought at an adult video store. A few days later I called him up and sounded all concerned, asking if he was watching the local news. He wasn't, so I proceeded to tell him that they were doing a story about adult video stores and he was seen clear as day in the background, walking out of the store with a brown paper bag. He freaked right out, thinking of all the people who might have seen him; it was great! <br>  <br>  (this is one my friend told me)<br>  This "funny prank" works best in a house with more than one bathroom. Just work up a real nasty crap by using whatever Mexican food or laxatives you can get your hands on. Go into your roommate's bathroom and dispose of your crap without flushing or wiping. Then waddle your way to your own bathroom and wipe off, etc. Now, go back to your roommate's bathroom and write "THE PHANTOM CRAPPER STRIKES AGAIN!!!" on toilet paper or their mirror. Works especially well if they are out of town for the weekend and come back to such a stench. <br>  <br>  Oh My God! This prank is Hilarious!!! If you have a friend who knows very little about computers then this is the prank for you! <br>  <br>  You see last night my friend wanted me to check out his computer because he had a problem with his AOL and try to fix it for him. I said ok and went about my business while he was watching TV. Knowing more about computers than he I changed the screen saver on his computer so you can type a message and it will go across his screen when he isn't touching the computer for a minute. Well you can see where it's going from here. The message read this: <br>  <br>  To Our Valued Windows 98 Customers; We regret to inform you that Windows 98 has a very serious bug that will blow up your computer in 30 seconds. It is advisable for you to vacate the premise as soon as possible or risk being killed. 29...28...27...26...25... <br>  <br>  You could imagine how quickly he got out of his chair and out the door. I went out to ask him what was wrong and he told me that his computer was going to blow up. I asked him if it was 30 seconds that he'd been outside. He wondered why and I explained it to him that I rigged it. It is so funny watching a 375 lb fat man run! <br>  <br>  After March break I went back to school pretending that I had amnesia. I made up a story about falling off a horse and hitting my head on a tree. I said that I had an 89% memory loss and that I could only remember how to speak English, read and write.<br>  <br>  I walked into my tech class with a piece of paper with all my courses on them and I asked friends of mine if I was in the right class. They gave me looks of confusion and disbelief when I told them my amnesia story. I went on asking where I sit in the class, asked them what kind of person I was, and many other fun questions. <br>  <br>  I had the whole class believing I had amnesia and everyone was trying to remind me of my past. I asked, "So what do we do in this class?" and my friend replied, "Well its computer engineering..." I asked "What's a computer?" They had their work cut out for them. They explained the Internet and they reminded me of all my favorite TV shows. They then started to get smart with me and they made up things like hover boards and World War III. It was fun, I just wish I was more prepared so I could've carried the prank on for a long time<br>  <br>  Peel a strip off of a carrot and bite it into the shape of a goldfish (see where I'm going?). Go over to a friends aquarium and shout out "I'm so damn hungry!" and, with the carrot strip in hand, held between your thumb and pointer, scrape your pinky along the surface of the water, getting your friends attention, and go "I loooooooove seafood!" whilst dangling and waving the fish around, giving it a life-like look. Slap the carrot shaving on your tongue and swallow it whole (or, for an added effect, chew rapidly). Gets my friends every time.<br>  <br>  Clear wrap under the toilet seat, nice and tight without wrinkles. So anything going in comes flying back out.<br>  <br>  A tough but extremely funny one.
