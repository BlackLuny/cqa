7985765d6a74cb0a72eb5c2728025a86aa	All of my in laws (father,mother, sisters,brothers) that i have met so far seem to love me.  They always ask my husband how I am doing and send their love.  The last time I visited they were all really excited to see me and showered me with gifts.  When I go to my father in laws home he always insists that I sit next to him, which as I understand it, is an honour in their tradition.|`|77AJmExlaa	nice to meet u Mrs evergreen (i saw ur on top :)) )    in  laws u mean like mother in law  and father in law ?    pretty  bad  even it is affecting the relation with  wife|`|KqiiT1WSaa	PERFECT|`|2WfEo9ivaa	I do not have any and I do not think I ever will. No one wants their daughter to marry a man with intersex medical conditions, plus I have no money. All I can offer is love and years of happiness, of devotion and caring and treating their daughter right and not ignoring her, but that probably won't be a good enough offer. They will probably want me to have money too and their daughter and I will be harmed by their rejection of me and both be doomed to life of loneliness as it is now.    Just being realistic, don't want to believe in any fantasies today that cannot and will not come true.|`|g2CZi00Uaa	I'm not married yet but I imagine my married life to be like those movies and I have the mother in law from hell haha    inshallah it wont be like that and we'll all have a good understanding with each other =]|`|bZM4R2gDaa	Well sis like anyone elses.

7HBKzJSHaa	There is a simple explanation:    The Pre-Historic Civilization known as Megalithic.    There are strong evidences that point out that they originated in Portugal, where are located the oldest cromlechs, menhirs and dolmens, close to 8000 years old. Stonehenge for example is 4000 years old and is considered one of the last monuments of the Megalithic Civilization.    This people migrated north, along the coast, to France, England and Ireland leaving a genetic mark. To this day the portuguese have the oldest genes in Europe.    This was a pre-celtic people but the Celts, 5000 years later, followed much the same footsteps, originating in Portugal where they were called Celtiberians thus reinforcing the genetic heritage that links portuguese with french, english and irish.   The blond haired, blue and green eyed brits came much later with the saxons and normans, the original inhabitants of the british isles were much like the portuguese are now, there even is the expression "dark irish".      Note: Obviously the portuguese are very far from being "spaniards", only someone completely ignorant on the history of Portugal and Spain would say that, sorry to say...  It's sufficient to know that Portugal was created in 1139 and Spain more than 300 YEARS LATER in 1492...|`|0yTM98Odaa	Just because of climate and not all Portuguese are dark.  In the southern Europe they get the most sun compared to central, north western, north eastern and northern Europe.|`|01NUrwfYaa	it's geography.  they adapted to the coast like the other medditerean peoples.. the portuguese are spaniards who speak a slightly different language although highly understandible to a spanish speaker...    galicians are dark too, which are right next to the portuguese... I know because my spanish teacher was galician.. that's why man spaniards and latin americans are hard to tell apart.. because they didn't change very much.. when they came to the new world..    genetically I have no clue.    but I met greek women who had lived in mxico for 30 years... couldn't tell her apart from an upper class mexican. ..     southern europeans rocK!|`|GiuuV5YAaa	"they adapted to the coast like the other medditerean peoples.. the portuguese are spaniards who speak a slightly different language although highly understandible to a spanish speaker..."      Slighty different language? lol You obviously have not heard a portuguese speak. lol The Portuguese are spaniards...???? I think it should be if anything the other way around my friend....    Portuguese does share a lot of similarities with Spanish. But many don't know that Portuguese was born before Spanish, Galician and Portuguese at one point were the same language but separated due to political reasons long ago. Since then, the languages have been growing apart.    Galician-Portuguese was born in northern spain and what is today Portugal. To this day, Galician is the closest language to Portuguese, but spelling is more similar to the spanish counter-part.    Portuguese phonetically is closer to Catalan or French due to celtic influences, something spanish does not have, and Spanish was more romanized phonetically like Italian.

BevylvVSaa	Not all friends disappear. The ones that do might come back after awhile and if they don't - you didn't need them a friends anyway. You will soon have new friends who appreciate you for who you are. Be patient.|`|M9o5WpOqaa	Because they are fools-a real friend will stick w/you no matter what!|`|Xxt4pEyEaa	Are you a bummer to be around? Think about it. Do you  act needy at tasks you could probably actually do? Do you moan and groan over every thing? Real friends don't just disappear because their friend has disabilities, unless the person with them isn't putting his best self forward. You didn't say whether your problem was physical or mental. If it's mental and you aren't taking your meds, your moods could be scary and depressing. Ya know, real friends nurture each other and show others their strengths to encourage them when they are down. It's not a one way street. Ya have to be bringing something positive to the table. Even if your paralysed, your compassion can be a great asset to others when times are tough for them. Take a BIG look at the guy in the mirror. We all have dissabilities, tho most aren't that noticeable.|`|AA12367014	Often if someone has just gotten a disability they can be depressed. Life changes drastically. Many people are not ready to handle a friend who has suddenly experienced a loss. Friend's drop other when their loved ones die as well. Perhaps they feel they cannot relate anymore, perhaps they feel guilty, perhaps they just cannot handle how depressed their friend has become.     Sometimes a newly disabled person can even react with anger toward friends who are not disabled. Obviously that can drive them away.|`|NAhsHPYsaa	They werent your friends and people often are either really nice or cruel just because of your disability there's no in between usually and it's hard to find good friends.|`|nv7Cofm5aa	Not all people get rid of friends with disabilities. That's a really harsh way to put it. You have to remember, everyone has their own reason and 'getting rid' of someone just because of his/her disability MAY NOT be the reason.     I have a hearing disability but let me tell you my side of the story. All of my friends/families are hearing but the 'hearing world' is what I only know the most. I met a few deaf/hard of hearing people in college. I realized they often stayed together (with their own kind). I was curious at first... why? I finally found out that my hearing friends also felt the same way and were more comfortable hanging out with those like them.     The issue isn't about 'getting rid' of someone or 'losing friendship'. I think the issue is that people aren't really aware of what they're doing consciously to you just because you are different. Truth be told, most people find it 'easier' to stick with people like them. This goes way back years and years ago. Not only do you see this pattern in disabled people... but also those who are different in terms of their religion, culture, ethnicity, race, gender, beliefs/values, educational background, etc. We're all victims of being 'different from everyone else'.     Don't let this hinder your ability to be yourself and to grow as a person. I will say this: I took the risk of getting to know people different from me (basically those who are hearing). I tried not to compare myself with them (just because they can hear). I was being honest and open with myself. I took action... I went up to my hearing friends/families and got to know them. I let them know what I could/couldn't do. They respected that. They finally saw what I was capable of.     But a real good lesson I learned from this was the simple fact that most people really don't know what to do with someone who is entirely different from you or them. It starts with openness. Once you let them know you're not afraid of what they'll say about you, you take the risk of being vulnerable but also CONFIDENT.     It will take years and years to get over this because the first goal in loving yourself is to truly accept what you have and what you don't. In other words, be content with where you are. As you grow, do something you love to do. Focus on yourself and your goals. It will be hard... especially when you will feel like an 'outcast'.     But don't let that get you down. Obviously, people like us can relate to fictional characters we see in movies like X-Men 3, Superman Returns, or Heroes. Why? Because these people are different. I know it's corny but the downside of this is we actually don't have super powers. However, the 'drama' in these movies/tv's are actually there. It's like we can't fly off the friggin edge of a building but deep inside, you can sense that most fictional characters have a story to tell based on their 'differences'. Watch those movies/tv's and you'll see what I mean.     Good luck finding yourself. Once you have reached that point, let me know how you have changed. Moreover, don't get angry, frustrated, or jealous with your peers/family members. Learn to accept what you have. Embrace it!|`|wFBVuBOkaa	It can depend on how old you are. When you're young, it can depress people to have to deal with someone with a disability. This is really mean of them, but sometimes people are really selfish. It could also be that they don't know what you can do and they don't know you're the same person they made friends with, so you have to show them and suggest activities.    Other times, you can actually strengthen your close friendships by letting them in "your world." Tell your best friends, if you're ready, that you're ready to show them what it's like if they're comfortable with it. If they understand what you're going through on a level most people won't, they can feel more valued.    Like any life-altering problem, I think disability leads to a higher turnover rate with friends. They come and go sometimes, but you can learn how to not just adapt, but sometimes even turn your disability into an advantage when it comes to friendships.|`|GLvLe2lAaa	People don't know what to say or do, so that fear drives them away.  Also, sometimes people are self centered and want to be on their own schedual and not accomodating.      When I became disabled in my late teens, a lot of my friends disappeared.  I only have a few friends now, but they are the best friends anyone could ask for, and I know I can count on them.  The people who backed away when I became sick were never really my friends anyway.    Since I can't get out much, I talk to people through websites that connect people with the same/similar disability/condition.  It really helps to talk to them and know that they are going through the same things as me.  If you are interested I posted the links under sources.    I'm sorry you are going through this!  Things will get better!  :)|`|eWssw4kfaa	This sounds kind of childish, and in fact it is very childish but, many people will kill a friendship after the other person has become disabled simply because they believe that the disabled has the cooties and they are afraid that they might catch the cooties themselves. Is this bullsh*t? Very much so, but many people still believe this nonsense.      Just give it time, eventually these morons will wake up and they will realize that we are not contagious.
7vk4xoKZaa	Try asking her out for dinner and a movie or something. Do you want the relationship to go to the next level? If so, try it on Valentines. Maybe get her a rose too. Not too much though.

Alcohol is often referred to as "liquid courage". Makes you, gives you the courage to do/say things you normally wouldn't. So for the hug, I would say that was probably it. Just get to know the girls as a friend. When they are comfortable, they'll confide in you, and then you won't have to second guess them! Good luck

Just a few hours ago I RECIEVED a call by Wep - my sending organisation - and they told me that I'm one of the first PEOPLE TO have found MY host family!!! It's incredible and I'm so happy!     Yeah, I mean, I've read all the information they gave me VERY FAST, beacuse I'm so EXCITED to know you better!! The place where you live seems fantastic! It's a great city! And the school is so cool TOO!    Ohh, I really wish THE time WOULD GO FASTER... I'm so anxious to meet you!    meanwhile, If you would have other information YOU WANT TO KNOW about me, just ask: I will be happy to answer ANY QUESTIONS.    COULD you give SOME me further info about you too, I'd be very glad!    See you Soon!    thank YOU all!    -    I put the changes in capitals so you can see them easily. I hope this helps and have fun on your trip!    =]|`|f48d10d4bec5b5e25f9894010aed2c69aa	I understand you wanting to sound like you have a great understanding of the language but i actually think you should send it just as it is. I think they would find if kinda cute and interesting the way that you wrote the letter. It is a great letter. Of course thier are some mistakes but that is to be expected. I dont think they are expecting you to know write perfect English. I think it would be cool to send them this letter and then when you send them a thank you letter after you leave you can compare the 2 letters and see how much you have learned.

Ug2YgWxNaa	Don't know what your budget is, but here are some suggestions from an old married guy:    1. Trip to a Day Spa... it gives her some alone time, and after taking care of a newborn some well deserved pampering.    2. Any jewelry with your child's name on it.    3. Cook dinner, clean the table and dishes, draw her a bubble bath, and you take the baby for the evening.     Hope these ideas can at least get you thinking.|`|GxV4jGKMaa	Have her relax while you cook and serve dinner. Then give her a back rub.   It's not about spending money, it's about showing love.

I think you should put the baby to bed :), make her a bath and put candle light in there, while she's bathing and drinking her glass of wine that you poured her, ha ha, you're going to make her favorite meal (and you'll find out because you're going to ask her) and in a v-day card, besides telling her you love her, you're going to write a list of 10 things you love about her. (because we like that kind of stuff). Afterwards, maybe surprise her with a massage.......etc, etc. etc. That's something I would love!!!!!!

If it is something really expensive, then I would not accept it.
Y32zA5Mfaa	Instead of getting him something, why not do something for him?  It seems like he already has tons of stuff.  Why not cook him a full course meal, get him tickets to a sporting event and plan the day around it so that all he has to do is show up and enjoy with you, create a romantic evening, etc.  That way it is very unique (since you usually buy him something).    Just a suggestion :)|`|ofCRTXw9aa	cologne, TV, GPS, stuff for his car, something engraved, a watch, a bracelet with his name on it (with something meaningful on the other side), ps3, shoes, gift cards, and more! :]

I saw it on the news a few months ago.  They said they will not be manufacturing the drug though because there is no money in it.  Yes, they really said that.  I'm not making it up.    I was appalled.    Maybe someone will know of a link to the news story if it's still somewhere on the internet...I don't know.  As long as there is money in people dying from cancer they will not find a cure.  They only want to find a way to keep people living with cancer and keep them medicated so they can make money from it.    There are people out there that are really looking for a cure, but I seriously doubt their cure will make it to the public unless someone is making money from it.|`|QE77Oxtqaa	Neither.

In the grave yard of the Killdonnel Friary in Ardrommond County Donegal Ireland on the Celtic New Year (oct 31, 1998) my friend took a picture of me and there is a spirit standing behind me.  There was no mist, no one was smoking because we specifically decided not to smoke on the Friary grounds and none of us drink alcohol or use recreational drugs, the next oct 31(1999) my sister took a picture of me with her children at my home in Pennsylvania USA.  The ghost is in that picture as well.  I am not making this up, I also think it's a relative or ancestor, it's a guy and he doesn't bother me.  I went back to the Friary on 2000 on June 22 and stood at the top of a set of steps and announced "Well your back were you came from if you wish to leave go right ahead, if you wish to stay fine" I was standing a good 10 inches from the steps.

In Detroit city, in an apartment home lives a ghost of a boy about the age of 15. Long ago before the city was as big as it is now, was a brother and his younger brother. Their parents had died when the younger brother was 10, leaving the older one to look after him. The older brothers name was Ken, and the younger one's David. Ken loved David and even though it was a terrible reason, loved him living with him. Everyday they would toss the football in the street. Ken worked as a constructioner. and He had just won a prize from his boss. Ken and the other constructioners would build out Ken and Davids small 1 room house, to a two story 6 room house. The two couldnt be happier. One day, after they started to build the second story David came home from school. Ken was taking a lunch break under the shade of the house standing up looking at the kids playing in the streets. When all of a sudden the cable broke and a bundle of wood was let loose. David ran to his brother, calling his name. Ken looked over, and looked up. and he was stunned. David pushed Ken out of the way, but getting hit himself. He was barried under the wood. After an hour or two they finally got to him. but it was to late. he was dead. Ken vowed never to go in the house without David, a pact the two had made before the building took place. That day, they never played football. So now, after the house was torn down and the apartment building was put up. David waits at the stoop with the football he had bought for Ken, waiting to play in the streets.|`|9vTWgiGgaa	A CRAZY GIRL AND HER WITCH BOARD THINGY:    Two semesters ago, I was on campus living the normal yet complicated life that all or most college students live, and I was living next door to a girl who was from New York and she owned a Ouija board that I never heard of until that time.  She tried to bring that tainted thing into my room and I threw it out the door and ran to it and kicked it down the hall like a soccer ball. I took a small bottle of human urine and dropped it on the board.  The next few hours, she comes to find the board drenched in pee-pee in the hallway but she still wants to use the board that night.   So, she still wants to play it with me and I said no, so she finds more girls to play it with. I'm in my room minding my business and all I heard was all of the girls screaming and running out of the room  My room ate closes the door and locked it once she saw the girl with the board that smelt like pee-pee. I turn the music up high and kept typing on my computer.  I get a message under my door that says the girls can't sleep because they saw a ghost in their room, could they crash in my place.  I replied, 'HELLLL-NOOO!' It was their fault that they ruined their lives with a ghost game.

Is he referring to himself and the angels? Is he referring to himself and the prophet Muhammad?    Before answering the question let us simply quote the verses where Allah says we and us:      006.112    YUSUFALI: Likewise did We make for every Messenger an enemy,- evil ones among men and jinns, inspiring each other with flowery discourses by way of deception. If thy Lord had so planned, they would not have done it: so leave them and their inventions alone.      010.087    YUSUFALI: We inspired Moses and his brother with this Message: "Provide dwellings for your people in Egypt, make your dwellings into places of worship, and establish regular prayers: and give glad tidings to those who believe!"      015.023    YUSUFALI: And verily, it is We Who give life, and Who give death: it is We Who remain inheritors (after all else passes away).      015.026    YUSUFALI: We created man from sounding clay, from mud moulded into shape;      020.077    YUSUFALI: We sent an inspiration to Moses: "Travel by night with My servants, and strike a dry path for them through the sea, without fear of being overtaken (by Pharaoh) and without (any other) fear."      032.021    YUSUFALI: And indeed We will make them taste of the Penalty of this (life) prior to the supreme Penalty, in order that they may (repent and) return.      032.024    YUSUFALI: And We appointed, from among them, leaders, giving guidance under Our command, so long as they persevered with patience and continued to have faith in Our Signs.      025.050    YUSUFALI: And We have distributed the (water) amongst them, in order that they may celebrate (our) praises, but most men are averse (to aught) but (rank) ingratitude.      047.031    YUSUFALI: And We shall try you until We test those among you who strive their utmost and persevere in patience; and We shall try your reported (mettle).      056.057    YUSUFALI: It is We Who have created you: why will ye not witness the Truth?      078.040    YUSUFALI: Verily, We have warned you of a Penalty near, the Day when man will see (the deeds) which his hands have sent forth, and the Unbeliever will say, "Woe unto me! Would that I were (metre) dust!"      Here is a response by a sheikh on this question:        Question :        Why does the Quran use the term "we" in its ayats?        Many non-believers believe that this may be in reference to Jesus?      Answer :        Praise be to Allaah.        It is a feature of literary style in Arabic that a person may refer to himself by the pronoun nahnu (we) for respect or glorification. He may also use the word ana (I), indicating one person, or the third person huwa (he). All three styles are used in the Quran, where Allaah addresses the Arabs in their own tongue. (Fataawa al-Lajnah al-Daaimah, 4/143).        Allaah, may He be glorified and exalted, sometimes refers to Himself in the singular, by name or by use of a pronoun, and sometimes by use of the plural, as in the phrase (interpretation of the meaning): Verily, We have given you a manifest victory [al-Fath 48:1], and other similar phrases. But Allaah never refers to Himself by use of the dual, because the plural refers to the respect that He deserves, and may refer to His names and attributes, whereas the dual refers to a specific number (and nothing else), and He is far above that. (Al-Aqeedah al-Tadmuriyyah by Shaykh al-Islam Ibn Taymiyah, p. 75).        These words, innaa (Verily We) and nahnu (We), and other forms of the plural, may be used by one person speaking on behalf of a group, or they may be used by one person for purposes of respect or glorification, as is done by some monarchs when they issue statements or decrees in which they say We have decided etc. [This is known in English as The Royal We  Translator]. In such cases, only one person is speaking but the plural is used for respect. The One Who is more deserving of respect than any other is Allaah, may He be glorified and exalted, so when He says in the Quran innaa (Verily We) and nahnu (We), it is for respect and glorification, not to indicate plurality of numbers. If an aayah of this type is causing confusion, it is essential to refer to the clear, unambiguous aayaat for clarification, and if a Christian, for example, insists on taking ayaat such as Verily, We: it is We Who have sent down the Dhikr (i.e., the Quran) [al-Hijr 15:9  interpretation of the meaning] as proof of divine plurality, we may refute this claim by quoting such clear and unambiguous aayaat as (interpretation of the meanings): And your god is One God, there is none who has the right to be worshipped but He, the Most Beneficent, the Most Merciful [al-Baqarah 2:163] and Say: He is Allaah, the One [al-Ikhlaas 112:1]  and other aayaat which can only be interpreted in one way. Thus confusion will be dispelled

VUK77SrXaa	Do you dream about gay sex? Do you get more excited from watching gay porn than you do watching straight porn? Do you catch yourself looking at the guy more when you watch straight porn.  Do you feel attracted to guys sexually? Do you feel attracted to girls sexually? Both?    Your involuntary feelings about or your reaction to gay and straight sex is just one measure of your orientation. You could be bisexual (feeling sexual attraction in some degree to both genders), or you could be straight and curious or you could be gay... all depending upon how you answer these questions. Your unconscious reaction of excitement / attraction / arousal is your best measure of orientation, versus your conscious reaction when looking at guys/girls. Your conscious reaction could be affected by your unconscious fears.  Only you can define what you are... don't let other people tell you.|`|SpcYCBndaa	you are probably just going through  a phase....don't be so quick in placing a label on your sexuality just yet|`|Xgm680dCaa	have you heard of bisexuality|`|KWl605JTaa	.don't feel the need to label yourself.  why should you?|`|uXjb9yMYaa	ur bi, COngrads!

You could be either, or bisexual (attracted to both genders).  Just give it time, and go with what you feel... it will become clear to you when you're ready.|`|Eqs5ncy9aa	bisexual is the word

Wear a cute red dress, with some stunning red heels and your hair in some bouncing curls and you could even present to him a single red rose.|`|sZoYD6Hfaa	I would just do something simple and cute, but kinda traditional (if you get too mushy you might scare him away...lol!)

d9MjpkK4aa	A small part of the original text is missing ( )    "They nurse sick persons, look after old people and handicapped persons:150 000 are doing alternative civilian service at the moment. Serving people for 13 months - a time of new experiences, which will change many of them, which will shape the idea about their future profession and their attitude towards life.  Actually, the civilian service time of Martin Frommhold is over for two weeks. but the young man from Dresden is adding one more year, staying with the 70 physically and mentally disabled children in the school for curative pedagogy of Bonnewitz.   I want to extend my knowledge even more, he says. After school I wanted to study geography, but now I want to become a rehabilitation trainer. That's because I became more mature each day during my civilian service time.   Martin is helping seven fifth-graders with their homework and eating, he goes walking with them and works out with them. Kristin, a mentally disabled girl in a wheelchair, is training to walk with him.   At first I still had to ( ) she is walking up the stairs on her own, led by my hand. And she is so happy about it! It's an indiscribably feeling - I could cry with joy then.  Though the work in the special school is not easy, Martin doesn't let go:  I used to hang around in the pubs senselessly, having lots of parties. Now I prefer to be with my co-workers and discuss the problems we have to face each day."    --------------------------------------...    ANNOTATION: It's really a stirring text. Unfortunately it's also an effective propaganda for the enforced military or civilian service which is still going on in Germany, in contrast to nearly all the neighbouring states around.

I wish you were my boyfriend lol|`|gsw5uCw4aa	I agree, i would notify her parents first, they would definatly respect you alot more. Send her a text early in the morning to check her door step and leave a single red rose with a cute, but simple card asking her to meet you at a specific restaurant for breakfast, (that way it will give her time to get up and get dressed), after breakfast take her to the movies, then for a walk through the park, then take her for a simple lunch or you could even pack a picnic while she is still at her house getting dressed before you even meet her for breakfast. After lunch ask her what she would like to do for the rest of the day since you planned the first part of the day.|`|1XJglTu3aa	This sounds very romantic.

9IrdMFX7aa	It is Japanese. That is for sure, because there is a  used, which is a Japanese hiragana.    The first three letters are     fushimi no    I think Fushimi is a last name.

I hope there is a Japanese around who could help. I will give you a star on the question.    P.S. in the picture (the woodblock print) there is written.  which means "the rice wine of Fushimi".|`|1ce0748c0ab23dcbbd0d889d57183122aa	Japanese. Note how in the first image there are "chinese-ey" characters and then a ? The  looks much more simple than the "chinese-ey" ones. Japanese and Chinese share a writing system but they are read differently (Japanese is actually a language isolate, or distantly related to Korean and the Altaic family. Just shares part of China's writing system). Japanese also has two others, hiragana and katakana. Hiragana is what the  is (read "no"). It's used for native Japanese words and words without kanji (the chinese ones). In this case No is a posessive article. (katakana is used for foreign words, sound effects, in substitute of complicated kanji and I think for some animals).     Sooooo yeah.... Japanese XD Sorry for the lengthy answer just wanted to point it out. Unless you read either one, if you see non "chinese" looking characters it's probably Japanese|`|AA10948829	Japanese.

216d90e6aa749da6fe51585ee054ef87aa	Common Courtesy During Cell Phone Conversations   Talking on your cell phone is not only convenient; for some it is a necessary part of daily communication. In order to keep your courtesy in check while you're gabbing on your mobile device, remember these few rules of etiquette when you're in public:      When in the company or presence of others, keep your cell phone conversations brief.   Always let the other party know you're calling from a mobile device so they know they can expect distractions.   Avoid the multi-task syndrome of carrying on cell phone conversations while you're in the grocery store line, heading into a bank, or at the department store cash register.  Be aware of your voice level. Not everyone around you needs the details of your cell phone conversations. Remember to turn your cell phone ringer off when in certain public areas. This includes movie theaters, playhouses, airplanes, and religious services.     Have you ever been in company of friends while an obnoxious cell phone user carries on an extended conversation while members of the group look on in awkward silence? To avoid social blunders when you take a call in the company of others, read on:    Remember that the company of the persons you are actually with is more important than the cell phone conversation, unless this is an emergency. That means any cell phone conversation should be a brief exchange rather than a detailed review of the meaning of life. This is even truer if the gathering is a meal. Step away from the conversation with a group of people if you must answer the phone. Or better yet, use the caller ID and voice mail whenever possible. If you're at a wedding, birthday party or family reunion, make it a point to return the call at a more opportune time if you can. Be discreet at social gatherings. Ringtone downloads can be fun, but at a social gathering, they can be distracting and annoying. Avoid the possibility of any ringtone downloads accidentally going off by setting your cell phone to vibrate mode.     nfd?|`|rThIVk2maa	the only rule you need to know: never ignore a person who is there for one who is not, which means don't ever turn from somebody you're talking to in real life to talk to somebody on the phone.|`|Wch2WybQaa	less is more|`|BIwZ7klfaa	listen first, then think, then speak|`|AA11212102	KISS- Keep It Simple and Short in public.

hgTzP8Yfaa	If you know anyone that speaks English as a native language, watching them speak (not just listening) and having them repeat sounds for you would do you well.  English "r"s and "s"s are meant to be gentler than those in German, so try saying them quietly.  "r" should flow into the next letter immediately, and "s" should not have a vibrational sound, but rather just be air.     Otherwise, don't fix it!  Haha.  Americans love European accents.

entRyNolaa	the punishment for adultery is doing it. everything punishment related naturally takes care of itself....the scriptures just point out that it is a dumb mistake, and all involved those close to the adulterers, and the entire universe suffers from any act of adultery and that it is seriously a terrible mistake, and is freely chosen ...I should know. I would have taken the 100 stripes anyday over the permanent damage and regret it has done to me, my ex, my children, my family, my reputation, my esteem, my community, and the universe.....God looked at me and looked away with disgust saying how stupid i was for choosing it I am sure    this is what the scriptures say through dramatic visuals - don't do it -it has a regrettable outcome - ALWAYS. the regret and emptiness is worse for women, because men are harder and less compassionate|`|jnG8sOzWaa	some religion, huh ?|`|VDTTzwlUaa	I don't know.

9PoGLVmXaa	There are 2 parts to baseball (softball) physical and mental. Yogi Berra (catcher for the Yankees in the 60s) once said the mental part was 50% of the game and made 90% of the difference. Nervousness will destroy the mental. How do you get over it;<br>  <br>  1. Concentrate on what you want to happen. <br>  <br>  2. If you do make a mistake go through the following steps;<br>      a. figure out what you did wrong such as taking your eye off the ball,<br>      b. figure out how you would have done it right and visually go over it in your mind and<br>     c. the most important thing is forget it (never carry it forward).<br>  <br>  Your mind can only think of one thing at a time and if you are always concentrating on what you want to happen and never carry mistakes forward it will help with nervousness.<br>  <br>  There is not much you can do about the physical over night, but here is something that might help a little. It is called visualization. Get by yourself and concentrate of one particular aspect of the game, such as hitting. In your mind think of yourself getting in the batters box and go through every step to get ready. Picture the pitcher's wind up and the ball coming at you. In your mind go through every thing of how you would stride and swing. If you find you are out of sync at any point then stop. Never finish the sequence wrong, because it goes into your mind wrong. This works for all aspects of the game. You will actually start to feel the musles strain to do what you are visualizing.<br>  <br>  In fact I used it in pistol shooting, I never went to the range to pratice one year but rather would spend about 2 hour before the matches going over how to stand, how to get the sight pattern and how to squeeze the trigger. I won almost half the matches. <br>  <br>  I hope this helps and good luck
s37fnYJ4aa	According to what I understand, all of the history prior to Moses was oral history, similarly subject to error.    But that's not the point.  The point is that there are living prophets today, and they continue to reveal God's word directly to us.  It doesn't matter what era of time we have gathered holy books from... (for Latter-day Saints we have a pretty broad selection).  Any book written by/for a different culture is bound to contain some things that we will not comprehend properly.  Human understanding just can't make sense of it with any reliability.    But the latter-day prophet Joseph Smith did two things regarding the Bible:  (1) Through direct revelation from God, the prophet Joseph Smith rewrote passages that were incorrect, so that they reflected the truth.  LDS call this "the Joseph Smith translation" of the Bible, and it is included in our KJV Bibles as footnotes, for our reference and understanding.    (2) Joseph Smith said "We believe the Bible to be the word of God, as far as it is translated correctly.  We also believe the Book of Mormon to be the word of God.  (Article of Faith 1:8).  (P.S.  We also believe God will never stop speaking... revelation is an ongoing thing for those who believe.)    So it is confirmed by Joseph Smith and all the other latter-day prophets that the Bible is the word of God (although there are some errors).  Joseph Smith also was visited by God the Father and his Son, Jesus Christ... standing side by side.  Again (third time lucky?), God affirmed in person that Jesus was His Son.  So in spite of errors in the Bible, this is no reason to cast doubt on the Sonship of Christ.    That said, the humble followers of the prophet Mohammed may have a different mission given by God... Hence perhaps why that prophet told his people not to call Jesus "God's Son".  (This is only my conjecture.)    Perhaps they were not yet ready to know how God's salvation and mercy was brought about.  I don't know... but I trust God, and I have faith that both Mohammed and Joseph Smith (and every prophet before and since those two) were truly inspired of God, and revealed His revelations.  I've felt the peace of God witness to me truth in the words of them both.  I do know, by many strong witnesses of that same feeling, that Jesus is the Son of God and the Saviour of the entire world.    At present, LDS missionaries are not allowed to convert Muslims, even though we have the greatest respect for them (and personally I love Islam and Muslims - it is a pure and inspiring religion).  All truth will be revealed in God's own time.  Until then, we can continue to trust in Him and follow those feelings in our own hearts that tell us where God wants us to go.  Christians and Muslims may be supposed to walk different paths, and God is at the centre.  We should not try to cast doubt on each others' religions, I believe.  But build faith and be brothers and sisters in love for each other and for our God.|`|atAZlwGdaa	You my friend have gotten it right. It is refreshing to see.|`|AA11648578	God is before creation and he is Father, Son and Holy Spirit.  It is God who spoke to Moses this word of God is also the word of the Son who became flesh to fulfill the law that condemns sinful man  God had a purpose for every scripture he sent to man. The first was the Torah which is the Law. Many people misunderstand the reason God gave man the law. Let's look at some of the first scriptures God gave to Moses.  God first explained man's creation in is image which defines man and his relationship with God. This scripture explains who man is and who God is.    Gen 1:26 And God said, Let us make man in our image, after our likeness: and let them have dominion over the fish of the sea, and over the fowl of the air, and over the cattle, and over all the earth, and over every creeping thing that creepeth upon the earth.     Gen 2:7 And the LORD God formed man of the dust of the ground, and breathed into his nostrils the breath of life; and man became a living soul.     Genesis 1 explains God said let US create man in OUR image.    Genesis 2 shows how man is created from the dust (flesh)  God breathed life into him (spirit)  and man became a living soul (soul)    God created man above the animals more than flesh which returns to dust but with an eternal spirit.      Now understand that God created man first flesh and second spirit.  God explains that the first will be last and the last will be first.  Made simple God explains that his truth is revealed through the spirit not through the flesh.    God continues to explain man's fall and God's plan of salvation.    There are two trees in the garden. These two trees have more than a literal meaning. We are told that The tree of knowledge of good and evil is forbidden.  The day Adam eats of it he will surely die.  The tree of life is also in the midst of the garden if they eat of it they will live forever.  These two trees are obviously more than trees.  What is the knowledge of good and evil?  Where could a man gain knowledge of good and evil?  We get our knowledge of good and evil from God.  The law that God sent down to Moses is the knowledge of good and evil.  Why would God's righteous law kill man?  Because man could not live up to God's righteousness.  It is also the reason there was a tree in the midst of the garden called the tree of life.  This is God's mercy.  This story Moses tells is of he two natures of God his righteousness and his mercy.  It is the story of man and his fall from God's glory and God's plan of salvation.       God gave man the law knowing man could not live up to his righteousness.  The law was not to change a man it changed none.  The law revealed to man his lack of righteousness and his need for a Savior    God first created man flesh and then God breathed in the spirit...first God gave man the law not to make man righteous but to demonstrate to man his sin nature and his need for God and his need for a  savior.  So first came the law then slavation through the atonment of Jesus Christ.  God povided the law to Moses to show us our need for Jesus.  So first came the Torah which is the law then the books of the prophets. These prophets prophesied the coming of the Lamb of God the Messiah that would atone for sin to bring us back to God through Jesus who would overcome temptation as a man under law remaining perfect and overcoming sin and death to bring man to God through his righteousness his atonement and his resurrection.    So first man needed the law to demonstrate to man his sin and his need for Christ the Gospel the good news that man can be restored to God through the atonement  After the Torah then the books of the prophets who prophsied the coming Lamb of God.  Then Christ came who is the word of God to fulfill the Law and the books of the prophets with the atonment and resurrection..which brings us the good news which is the Gospel..but the good news is the atonement and resurrection.    These books gave us the law and the prophets which shows us who God is who we are wnd our need for Christ and his prophesies of his coming. They are only fulfilled through the atonement and resurrection of Christ then the Gospel the book that leads us forward to our new life that is to come.  The New Testament is intructions that take us forward ot the second coming of Christ and provides revealtion of these things.    Jesus is the Son who is the word who is with God and is God before creation.  This is one thing the Qu'ran has right it refers to Christ as the Gospel and the word of God.     [Yusufali 3:45] Behold! the angels said: "O Mary! Allah giveth thee glad tidings of a Word from Him: his name will be Christ Jesus, the son of Mary, held in honour in this world and the Hereafter and of (the company of) those nearest to Allah;    Glad Tidings is the Gospel which is the word of God and is the word from God.    Allah did not know or did not seem to mention that the Good News was the atonement and the Gospel is that Christ is the Word and the Word is God.    John 1:1 In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God.    Edit   Why would the Gospel be inaccurate because it is written after Christ?  The Gospel is the Word of God as is all of the Bible including the scriptures written before  the birth of Christ.  Christ did not have to be in the world for the Torah to be the word of God.  Christ was not in the world when the prophets wrote of him.  Christ is God who came to the world to fulfill  these wiritings not to write the book.  These books are about him...the books are his word which is the word of God. Jesus is the Word he isnt the one writing the word but the God who inspired and spoke the word of God|`|hR7OsqtRaa	In John 8:58 "I tell you the truth," Jesus answered, "before Abraham was born, I am!"    The above verse speaks a lot about who Jesus really is.    There are a lot more chapters and verses mentioned in the below website along with music, speeches and praise and worship.    http://jesustrinity.blogspot.com    Jesus is God. He is alive forever.    The questions usually asked are:-    1) Did Jesus really exist?  2) Is Jesus God?  3) If Jesus is God, then why did He keep praying to the Father in Heaven? How can the Father and Jesus be one God? Why did Jesus have to suffer on the Cross?  4) What is the Holy Spirit?  5) What is so special about Jesus? Why cant I just view him as an ordinary man or a teacher or a prophet? Why should I see him as God?      It would not be possible to give a short answer to these questions .    I suggest you visit the below website.    After visiting the below website, you would get a lot of answers.    http://jesustrinity.blogspot.com    1.Thomas calls Jesus God in John 20:28 (Note, Thomas addresses Jesus  specifically.)  2. Jesus is God in Heb. 1:8  3. John the apostle states that Jesus was the Word which was God that became  flesh (John 1:1-14)  4. The phrase "Call upon the name of the LORD" (Hebrew, YHWH, i.e., Psalm  116:4) used only of God on the OT, and translated into the Greek in the LXX as  "Call upon the name of the LORD (greek, KURIOS)," applied to Jesus in the NT  (1 Cor. 1:2) Jesus is God in flesh  5. The apostle John says that Jesus was , "...calling God His own Father,  making Himself equal to God," (John 5:18)  6. Jesus said that He and the Father are One (John 10:30), that caused the Pharisees to  claim that Jesus was making Himself out to be God.  7. Jesus knew all things (John 21:17)  8. Jesus knew all men (John 16:30)  9. Jesus is everywhere (Matt. 28:20)  10. Jesus Christ, dwells in you (Col. 1:27)  11. Jesus is the exact representation of the Nature of God (Heb. 1:3)  12. Jesus is eternal (Micah 5:1-2)  13. Jesus gives eternal life (John 10:27-28)  14. Jesus is our only Lord and Master (Jude 4)  15. Jesus is called the Mighty God (Isaiah 9:6)  16. Jesus is called the Mighty God (Isaiah 9:6) and "God" also be called the  Mighty God in Isaiah 10:21  17. Jesus is able to raise Himself from the dead (John 2:19-21)  18. Jesus created all things (Col. 1:16-17), it is God who created all things  by Himself (Isaiah 44:24)  19. Jesus searches the hearts and minds of the people (Rev. 2:23)  20. Jesus is worshiped (Matt. 2:2-11; Matt.14:33; Matt.28:9; John 9:35-38;  Heb. 1:6) Only God can be worshipped (Matt. 4:10) (same Greek word for worship  is used in each place.)  21. In the OT God was seen (Exodus 6:2-3;Exodus 24:9-11; Num. 12:6-9; Acts  7:2), yet no man can see God (Exodus 33:20; John 1:18). It was not the Father  that was seen in the OT (John 6:46). Who, then were they seeing? See John  8:58.  22. Jesus claimed the divine name, "I AM", for Himself in John 8:58 see  Exodus 3:14.  23. Jesus says you must honor him even as you honor the Father (John 5:23).  24. Jesus gives life (John 5:21).  25. Jesus bears witness of Himself (John 8:18;John 14:6).  26. Jesus is the One who will judge you on judgement day (John 5:22-23). Only God can be the judge.  27. Jesus forgives sins (Luke 5:20) (Luke 24:47,Acts 10:43) .Only God can forgive sins.    http://jesustrinity.blogspot.com|`|D9lMg7A2aa	Not even a coherent logical statement. For starters, who said getting a book is superior. Seems quite inferior to me.     And to the Bible itself !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! :      Hebrews Chapter 1  1   1 In times past, God spoke in partial and various ways to our ancestors through the prophets;   2   in these last days, he spoke to us through a son, whom he made heir of all things and through whom he created the universe,   3   who is the refulgence of his glory, the very imprint of his being, and who sustains all things by his mighty word.       ===> By the way, does Moses 'Sustain all things by his mighty word' !!

0PvpGjSqaa	it angers a lot of people, it doesn't mean you have an anger problem|`|ewWUFWyWaa	There is no biggest insult to anybody with a measurable IQ than the description of what Heaven and Hell is all about!<br>  <br>  By believing in Jesus and being “saved” the Bible writers tell you that you will get one of the first seats in Heaven to watch how the vast majority of all the human beings perhaps into the TRILLIONS including your “unsaved” family members and old acquaintances will be especially tormented one by one in a sulfuric lake of fire or what have you for ever and ever. You will be encouraged to poke fun at them showing a wet big finger for them to lick to quench their thirst because in Hell there is no fresh water and you can tease them all you want for ever and ever! That’s HEAVEN! No wonder Jesus said that you must hate your father and your mother and everybody else to follow him, especially if they are "unsaved" and go to HELL! You will hear a lot of “I told you so…” from Sweet Jesus! He thought of everything even some low IQ teasing games that WE CAN ALL PLAY with the damned in Hell! Heaven is for the childlike poor and uneducated so please bear with me in this story written by the authors of God’s Holy Word, the Bible!<br>  <br>  Luke 16:23-25-NIV (Jesus is telling us…) AND BEING IN TORMENTS IN HELL, he* (*Not a gay person, or a Godless Atheist, or and abortionist, but a rich Jewish person whom Jesus knew personally! In those days to be rich was the fad sin of the day.) lifted up his eyes and saw Abraham afar off, and Lazarus in his bosom* (*If you go to Hell you will recognize EVERYBODY in Heaven especially your family members, and vise versa!). “Then he cried and said, ‘Father Abraham, have mercy on me, and send Lazarus that he may dip the tip of his finger in water and cool my tongue; FOR I AM TORMENTED IN THIS FLAME.’ (and Jesus all excited and turned on like mad continues the story telling… BTW, at this point you can tell the necessary IQ level to believe all this crap “in your heart!”) But Abraham said, ‘Son* (*Abraham was an ancestor of this rich man! Notice how little compassion any member of your own family will have on you when you end up in Hell!), remember that in your lifetime you received your good things* (*again. in this story to be rich is a sin! Christian preachers now use it to make it applicable to ANY SIN!), and likewise Lazarus evil things; but now he is comforted* (* for all eternity, for ever and ever, and ever! billions and trillions of years…!!!) and YOU ARE TORMENTED!<br>  <br>  Believe it or not, there is hardly any other specific description in the Bible of what else any Christian will be doing in Heaven except for “worshiping” this narcissist Bible God for ever and ever while poking fun at the damned in Hell…!!! Christians need to forget that the Bible writers are telling us that during the “Creation Week” as soon as God created Heaven and the angels 1/3 of them were not one bit impressed with God’s “beauty and Holiness” and rebelled against him on the spot under the leadership of Lucifer* (*Light Bearer – The most beautiful Angel ever created!) and they became Demons and Satan, and so on.<br>  <br>  The Bible God promised the Jews to be “rich lenders and not borrowers” like this rich man in Hell, otherwise IF THEY DON’T OBEY they will be poor “slaves and borrowers” like Lazarus in Heaven! I know it sounds screwy, but what the heck that’s the story that the Bible writers managed to say! That’s why I get a lot of email telling me that not everything in the Bible should be taken literally… short of seriously! Especially the silly teasing words that Sweet Jesus aka “Creator of the Universe” will personally enjoy hearing and watching the Christians POKE AT ALL THOSE IN HELL FOR EVER AND EVER for not believing in Jesus, or for never hearing about him, or not having the mental faculties in order to accept Jesus, or not being obedient to the clergy, or not being respectful at all the Christian religious displays in public places, or not paying the tithes and offerings ON TIME! It will be a long time before anybody in Heaven can possibly get bored! Only Jesus knows what other torments await for those in HELL…!!! Low IQ people will love to be entertained for ever and ever like that… or wouldn’t they? That’s about the only hope that they have on being right on anything! What the heck! It is all in the Bible that Christians hardly read!<br>  <br>  Luke 19:27 (NIV) (Sweet Jesus is very excited telling this other story, too!) But those enemies of mine who did not want me to be king over them–bring them here AND KILL THEM IN FRONT OF ME!* (*Not even the Mafia measures up to Jesus! Christianity surely is a “slaughter house” religion and the preachers know how to profit out of it!)<br>  <br>  Revelation 14:10-11 (NIV) [Jesus says] "he, too, will drink of the wine of God's fury, which has been poured full strength into the cup of his wrath. HE WILL BE TORMENTED WITH BURNING SULFUR IN THE PRESENCE OF THE HOLY ANGELS AND OF THE LAMB* (*i.e. Sweet Jesus Christ, and the Christians who managed to be saved in spite of all the hurdles that Jesus set up -John 17:24 will enjoy watching!) And THE SMOKE OF THEIR TORMENT RISES FOR EVER AND EVER. There is no rest day or night for those who worship the beast and his image, or for anyone who receives the mark of his name." (PRAISE THE LORD…!!!)<br>  <br>  Revelation 4:8-9 (KJV) …and they REST NOT DAY AND NIGHT, saying, Holy, holy, holy, Lord God Almighty, which was, and is, and is to come* (*that’s all that the Christians will do for ever and ever and ever when they get to Heaven).  And when those beasts give glory and honour and thanks to him that sat on the throne, who liveth for ever and ever, The four and twenty elders fall down before him that sat on the throne, and worship him that liveth for ever and ever, and cast their crowns before the throne…|`|X8LNbaKQaa	I get similarly angry when I see people mistreat their dogs.

J0YS28Ysaa	welcome to intelligent conversation. if you really must know, the original followers of jesus were led by james (his brother) shortly after christ was crucified. they were called the ebionites. secular christianity (the churches you refer to) were led by Paul. they were called the Pauline church. the two were mortal enemies. the first followers of jesus (apostles and others) were judeo christians or jewish converts. the beliefs of the two churches differed broadly. james believed jesus to be a great prophet but not divine. paul obviously disagreed. james followers were all but martyred and their legacy was lost. the pauline church became the catholic church. the bible is a book. infallible? nah. literal? nah. the churches would have you believe it..but it is not so. jesus was a great example for humanity. true christians try and follow his example. they are not worried with what the bible says but instead how jesus lived his life. true christians do not judge other religions or condemn them to a fiery hell. they do not say that they are the only way or that by another religion, they cannot enter in to heaven, but rather that they have an example given to humanity by god to which they try and follow. for these christians there is no church. instead, like minded individuals are the church. in essence, you are the church. your body the temple. they have no need for institutions. they have no need to convert. instead, they practice tolerance, and do not judge. they do not desire war. no man is holier than any other (including the pope) but all men are equal. they do not believe in giving money to the church as the poor too can give of themselves...giving instead to those in need be it time or resources. these "christians" are not mixed up. they know what they believe. the churches you refer to are institutions. they are businesses. they sell a product. every one claiming to sell a better product than the last. a quick review of these churches history will show them to be in contra to christian morals and ideas. catholics called members of their church to war with the muslims many years ago for the forgiveness of sins. does god want you to wage war in his name? mormons think they have a password to heaven- this is original i must say..really? no one else gets the password? these are obvious fallacies. the jews are the chosen people of god? does god really have favorites? this is common sense. you are born with all you need. jesus' example was not limited to one group, no one will contend that he lived his life wrong..everyone can follow his example no matter race, religion, ethnicity, etc because the example is to love one another as you love yourself- not dogma|`|7oetZ4I3aa	i personally think majority if not all of the people who have answered this question is mildly stupid, there are so many denominations because religion is man made and it is human nature to not agree on everything, it's a pointless battle there is no damn god. so grow up and read a factual book for once|`|jLvfPh8Daa	Firstly, they are all right, depending on the person (although this is starting to get out of hand)<br>  Secondly, it's sort of a good  thing that Christians are divided and bickering.<br>  The last time all the Christians agreed on everything, millions of people died.|`|6UEK1TPaaa	I believe your question contains a fatal flaw.<br>  <br>  You are assuming that all denominations differ on the essential.  That is simply incorrect.  <br>  <br>  If the church in question is of the position that God is Holy, man has fallen and rebelled, and stands under condemnation, and that rebellious man is reconciled to a Holy God by receiving by grace through faith, the perfection of Christ, and he receives the penalty of our sin, and this church believes in the Trinity, then you pretty much have an agreement.  <br>  <br>  Most differences in denominations are over governance:<br>  <br>  Episcopal-bishop/heirarchy<br>  <br>  Presbyterian: Elder-ruled<br>  <br>  Congregational:  Local Congregation ruled.<br>  <br>  Soli Deo Gloria|`|2dME9HlNaa	I really don't know.|`|XfUMGLrxaa	one can claim that they are all right|`|tManvxfQaa	cause 33,830 denominations are man made<br>  <br>  <br>  There is But ONE GOD and His Name is Jesus the Living Word....that's why !!!|`|TOBYij3Qaa	denominations arent what saves people, God is<br>  faith in Christ alone, it doesnt matter where you worship|`|VRl1jENHaa	You're looking at the matter from the wrong perspective.  There are certain central beliefs that make a person a "Christian;" this is agreed upon by the vast majority of Christians (those who disagree have their own agendas).  Such beliefs include Yeshua's (Jesus') virgin birth; that He is God in the Flesh; His atoning death; His literal, physical resurrection; salvation via belief in Him; etc.<br>  <br>  It's THESE things that identify a person as a Christian, not whether the person believes in the Rapture, Amillenialism, predestination, consubstantiation vs. transubstantiation, etc. -- and CERTAINLY not whether a person belongs to a particular denomination.<br>  <br>  So by this definition, Christianity is MUCH more cohesive than you have presented.|`|Fdo2G5BZaa	There is Only One True Church... if they do not believe that then they are not True Christians.<br>  <br>  God will not consider ones "denomination" when deciding who is to enter Heaven...

The Deva of india, the faeries of Annwn, even theosophist Masters are ways in which a society imprints its morals and beliefs upon the world around them. I believe in them as a way to become what, in that society, seemed to be the best a human could be. I admire Myrddin and Taliesin, the Deva, even Atlantis, despite it's known fabrication by Plato. They are, as religion is, a guide to become the best you can be.<br>  And I would like to point out that at one point, Jesus was folklore, and that the Bible is the interpretation of him by man, and therefore not accurate - especially when it has been through so many translations. (for instance 'thou shalt not suffer a witch to live' was actually, before the King James translation, 'thou shalt not suffer a poisoner to live'.

This nature according to Scripture has infected the very fabric of our being and has warped God’s original design. And to a large extent, this design centers on our ability to be in a relationship with God. Our sin nature prevents this from happening because it produces an inclination to rebel and choose against Him. More than this, the doctrine of total depravity teaches that the corruption of our nature is so deep that we are fundamentally incapable of choosing for God (John 6:44, Rom. 3:10,11). <br>  ·Unconditional Election – The doctrine of unconditional election teaches that God has made a decision from eternity to predestine some to be saved, while those that have not been ‘elected’ will face eternal damnation. The ‘unconditional’ part of this doctrine refers God’s choice in election. God’s choice in election did not hinge upon any foreseen merit found in a person or any action performed by the person. Instead, God’s selection of the ‘elect’ is based on His own independent and sovereign choice. For instance, while speaking to His disciples, Jesus told them: “You did not choose me, but I chose you and appointed you to go and bear fruit—fruit that will last. Then the Father will give you whatever you ask in my name” (John 15:16). In another place, Paul tells the believers in Ephesus, “For he chose us in him before the creation of the world to be holy and blameless in his sight. In love he predestined us to be adopted as his sons through Jesus Christ, in accordance with his pleasure and will” (Eph. 1:4-5). <br>  ·Limited Atonement – Otherwise known as ‘particular atonement,’ the doctrine of limited atonement suggests that Jesus’ substitutionary death was only for the ‘elect.’ Driven by preserving God’s sovereignty, Calvinist thinkers teach that God’s plans and will cannot be frustrated by man. Therefore, those for whom He died must also be saved. This leads to the conclusion that Jesus must have only died for the elect.<br>  ·Irresistible Grace – Irresistible grace, sometimes called ‘efficacious grace,’ refers to the idea that Jesus’ atonement is effectually applied to the ‘elect.’ Closely related to limited atonement, the elect are unable to resist God’s calling to salvation because the efficacy of Jesus’ death cannot be frustrated by the will of man.<br>  ·Perseverance of the Elect – Finally, the doctrine of ‘perseverance’ teaches that the ‘elect’ will continue, in faith, until the end of their lives. Those who fall away from the faith were either never true believers or will someday return to the faith.<br>  <br>  I can defend this view with Scripture, but I am about loving and serving Christ, not a view on doctrine|`|GKQJRJAMaa	I'm a teen too and so far I just followed my parents.

I didn't end up staying with the same thing my entire life though.

I studied Spirituality for the past 15 years as well as healing etc as well as becoming Ordained finally after being convicted. I looked for answers around the world.

Come into my heart. Come into my heart Lord Jesus. Come in today. Come in to stay. Come into my heart Lord Jesus."<br>  And He did.<br>  <br>  So I have always beleived in Jesus. But fell away when if married & moved away.<br>  <br>  10yrs later I was stuck in a hole I couldn't seem to climb out of. So I prayed again. Then went through a breakdown that led me to seek Gods help.<br>  <br>  I found Gods help at <a href="http://www.riveroflifefellowship.org" rel="nofollow">http://www.riveroflifefellowship.org</a> and went forward for prayer 3Xs. And each time I was more healed. The 1st time an oppressive witch spirit left me for good. The 2nd time I recommitted to Christ. The 3rd time the Holy Spirit overfilled me & I reached my hands straight up to God & praised God in tongues. I went home & the Spirit of Truth, the anointing God anointed me with had me throw away a mormon book and to read in a Zion Magazine that He is the anointing, the Spirit of Truth who will lead me into all the Lord has said.<br>  <br>  So that was the major part of my healing. Then I could sleep soundly again.<br>  A verse in the bible? 1Jn2:27. And the Anointing that you have received of Him abides in you and ye need not that anyone teach you: but as the same anointing teaches you of all things, and is Truth and is not a liar, and even as He has taught you, ye shall abide in Him.<br>  <br>  So? My faith is in Jesus Christ my Lord & my God. God the Father, Word/Son & Holy Spirit.<br>  <br>  So basically, I was taught about Jesus & accepted Jesus young. And so I knew who to pray to when I got stuck in a rut. But I had to learn that God doesn't like idols. It wasn't a pleasant experience. So? I was desperate when I first went to the River of Life. And God healed me. So? He Is the God who healed me & loves me & promises to never leave or forsake me.<br>  <br>  But then when I recommitted to Christ, I had many question. So the Holy Spirit led me in the Bible much. I have read the whole bible.<br>  <br>  If you have any questions, I probably have already asked God & got an answer, and confirmation through Godly Ministers of the answer.<br>  Feel free to ask me any thing more.|`|7i0b6PABaa	If you weren't raised with anything, then why would you want to be anything?

But they can be sealed to other women if the other woman dies or they are divorced from their civil marriage. <br>  <br>  There is a such thing as a Temple divorce which can dissolve the covenants that were made in the temple. This can only be done through the First Presidency of the church. Generally Temple divorce occurs when one or the other is unfaithful to their covenants in the church. <br>  <br>  But other than that these sealings only happen one at a time and not simultaneously.<br>  <br>  Edit: And for the record yes this is a form of spritual (Celestial) polygamy. However, mongomous marriage is really a new concept in the spectrum of society. Abraham practiced it, as well as Jacob, and King David. It's just in today's society that people see it as abbhorrant. It really requires an open mindset that God was tolerant of the marriages that Abrham, Jacob, and even King David participated in.|`|LuN1unJ3aa	Remarrying suggests divorce, which dissolves the original sealing, so no, they would not be sealed to more than one woman.<br>  <br>  This starts getting a little technical in terms of what the children want and it is the current position that if the children want their deceased, but divorced parents, sealed, then they can have it done and everything will be sorted out by the Lord (in the hereafter).|`|AA10637643	Yes.  Conditionally.<br>  <br>  IF a man is married, sealed to his wife and she dies, he then is free to remarry and be sealed to the second wife.  I know several people who have done this.  If the second wife dies, he can remarry and be sealed again, and so on.  A man cannot be sealed to more than one living woman at a time.<br>  <br>  Uh, it's not different than eternal polygamy.  There will be plural marriages in the CK.|`|e1a7697c7943bcffd2fa613b82800630aa	Yes a man may be sealed to more than one woman.  Even civil divorce does not terminate a sealing.  I am sure that Jacob is sealed to both Rachel and Leah.  Is guess that was both earthly and eternal polygamy.|`|OtKCAeQZaa	Only one man and women is permitted to be sealed in the temple. If he remarries because she passes away. She then is sealed to him forever. He can marry another and be sealed as well to his new wife. But if the relation falls apart and they separate and divorce and she  marry another the sealing is annulled by God, and she then can be seals to her new husband. For all eternity. Unless God permits there to be multiple marriages in the temple it will never happen. only in the lord due time that it will happen like in Joseph Smith days. to replenish the earth. when the second coming comes there shell be 7 wives to ever man so says the lord .why well easy to understand the world will be in great wars and many millions of husbands and brothers will die in the wars so there will be so many women that the lord will give 7 wives to every man.|`|2wUvFmrhaa	Yes they can.<br>  <br>  It is called (the belief in )spiritual polygamy. As for today, the ONLY form of polygamy CONDONED by the LDS hierarchy is spiritual polygamy, which they practice on a regular basis. But it is an ESSENTIAL tenet of Mormonism, which means that you HAVE to connect the two. Plus they believe all the polygamy of the past will be together forever as family units. (procreating)<br>  I'm not kidding...<br>  <br>  It's crazy..IMHO.<br>  <br>  SEE...<a href="http://www.utlm.org/onlineresources/ldsleadersbelievepolygamyinheaven.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.utlm.org/onlineresources/ldsl...</a><br>  <br>  The official LDS Church Handbook of Instruction says:<br>  <br>  Living Women — A living woman may be sealed to only one husband. . . .<br>  <br>  Living Men — If a husband and wife have been sealed and the wife dies, the man may have another woman sealed to him if she is not already sealed. (Church Handbook of Instruction, p.72)<br>  <br>  Many mormon men, (and many leaders now a days) have taken on more that one wife for Heaven. If a first wife dies, he can be resealed to another woman too. Also in some cases of divorce.  They practice (multiple sealings) every day, in Mormon Temples all over the world. <br>  <br>  <br>  Although the current Mormon leaders are very quiet about the matter of polygamy, it is still very much a part of their theology. Joseph Smith's revelation on plural marriage, Doctrine & Covenants, section 132, is still printed in the LDS scriptures. This leads to a certain amount of confusion as to when something is supposed to be considered doctrine. Hinckley, danced around the subject.<br>  <br>  **So the LDS that deney this doctrine, and mislead about what their church teaches.<br>  <br>  Some are clueless about this "belief."<br>  LDS will never mention it without being asked directly about it.<br>  EDIT:<br>  Its a crazy thought, (and just plain disturbing) and not accurate....imho. Like "I hope" you two wives get along, because they will be together forever (Dont forget the procreating)<br>  <br>  Mormonism teaches we are God and his wife(s) offspring, so the belief is new worlds will be peopled by our own offspring. (those who are worthy and attain Godhood.<br>  ~I can't belief I just typed that out, it's a crazy belief.|`|o9Ckf0h4aa	yes.if a man is widowed,for example, he can marry another wife and be sealed to her in the temple.even though he was married in the temple and sealed to his first wife.|`|89467eca0fed8064f14692fa352fc661aa	Not a Mormon but I have been told by them that it is against their faith now!<br>  Rev.

LuN1unJ3aa	Nothing. I'm not Catholic and Lent is a Catholic observation (also observed by some branches of the Anglican Communion and a few Protestant sects).

QIQNzE11aa	Offer this instead, PIZZA and SODA party. That kind of gets the message apart. Or.. JUNK FOOD and FIZZY drinks (i tried to make it more UK adaptable).   (;    I think you are right, alcohol just isn't a worthwhile thing to use in life. People mostly use it to finally open up and to make excuses for bad behavior. Or to drink away their problems.     I threw many parties titled the way i put it. It tells people that alcohol isn't going to be present and it also convey's that you don't want it brought in.     Parties such as the ones you are planning tend to be more fun in the end as no one is throwing up, cops aren't being called, and no one has a hang over the next day. Enjoy!|`|AA10819407	Just mention on the invites that it is an alcohol free party..      May get tons of respect for your beliefs as well...Have a great one!!|`|SsB7aRExaa	It's real simple.  Invite them.  Mention there will be no alcohol on the invitation.    You'll find out who your real friends are.  Be prepared to be disappointed.      I like your stand on this.|`|rThIVk2maa	You can say "I'll be providing soft drinks and snacks and you're welcome to bring anything else you'd like for the evening."    If you don't want them to bring alcohol, then just say you'll be serving soft drinks and snacks and leave off any other mention. The guests are not supposed to demand specific things from the host.|`|siTibEIGaa	He is right. What I would do, is make it a dinner party, that way you all have something to do while your enjoying yourselves, conversing and whatnot.|`|YdjX5fOWaa	I have lots of friends that don't drink and generally this isn't a problem.  They have parties all the time with no alcohol and no one thinks anything of it.  Or, if you're ok with it, allow them to bring their own beer or wine for themselves.  If people want to have a drink they can always go out after your party.  Have fun!|`|B7WIZdglaa	$hitty! Parties suck without a little booze. You don't have to go overboard, what about tasteful mixed drinks? Martinis? Don't be such a prude!|`|fvnaDIhtaa	i don't believe that there's anything wrong with it. Just explain to them that you don't drink nor do you condone it. They should respect your decision. If all else fail serve "mocktails"     MOCKTAILS= mock cocktails... do not contain any alcohol|`|2AqU4SjYaa	Frank, there is nothing that says you HAVE to serve alcohol.    I got married (28 years ago) and there wasn't even a champagne toaste at the reception.    Some, it is for religious reasons . . .     Others, it is because they are recovering alcoholics . . .     (I'm NOT saying you're a recovering alcoholic)    Have your party . . . serve coke, pepsi . . . ginger ale . . .     Dan in Miami|`|wY39KhmPaa	Make sure u have kids around for the first half of the party with   juicy juices.|`|N53y9qohaa	Hi Frank,    Just because you do not believe in consuming some alcoholic beverages does not mean that other people do not like to do so.  As with many other things we consume, most are bad when not taken in moderation anyway. Personally I do not go out of my way to attend a party where such restrictions are put into place. I would not force you to take an alcoholic drink at my parties and always have lots of sodas, juices and mineral water available to those who abstain and similarly I would expect a person like you to reciprocate in kind.    To escape this predicament and not offend your friends, I suggest you rent a room in a restaurant, buy the food for your buddies and let them buy or not buy their own drinks as they choose.     Cheers,    Michael Kelly|`|PG7WfGpHaa	As long as you make it clear that this is a 'dry' party BEFORE they accept the invitations.    Make sure you have a stash of weed.|`|REC4YgOuaa	let them know that there will be no alcohol served and if they don't come you know that they're not true friends just drinking buddies|`|xnsU60hhaa	Just mention on the invitation that soft drinks and snacks will be served. You are not obligated to provide alcohol. To avoid offending anyone, you may want to add a note that it is an "alcohol free" party. I have been to a couple of these. And then you don't have to worry about it being too late either, most people don't want to stay very long.

These kids are doing something entirely human . They are getting their emotional and psychological needs met. self centered , self righteous narcissistic and materialistic people don't like it.

I was in your position when i was young.  No one wanted to date me and then i had so few friends that i could not believe God wanted me to live like this.

I had to go through so much more and still learning how to handle problems that come up.  Just remember that God will not put something in your life that you cannot overcome.  That boy that you like he will not be the only person out there that will catch your eye or capture your heart.  Just live life to the fullest and have the most of everything you have.

She had quite an amazing psychic reading that revealed that she was a very old soul who agreed to return to earth and give birth to four friends who would be extremely special.  To do this would weaken her so badly that she would die and return to wherever it was she came from.  If I were to believe in this, I would agree that she was an old soul.  However, the rest was true, and she knew it.  She already had 4 amazingly gifted children and was dying.  She died a couple of years ago, and who's to say what happened.  However, I know that she was never "world-weary".  She loved every minute of life and drew such joy from her husband and children.<br>  <br>  If you are world-weary, work on relationships.  There is so much happiness to be found in other people.  That may be what you are here to learn.|`|xHfl4yzSaa	You need to ask Old King Cole?

Dead is dead. There is no "soul" that goes out of the body to live elsewhere! No "soul" goes immediately to heaven or hell. Dead is dead!<br>  “For as the body without the spirit is dead, . .” [James2.26]<br>  <br>  The Sleep of Death.<br>  <br>  At death the body returns to dust and the life force (not the soul) to the creator<br>  “ . . . but the dead know not any thing, .” [Ecclesiastes 9.5]<br>  “His breath goeth forth, he returneth to his earth; in that very day his thoughts perish.” [Psalm 146.4]<br>  Lazarus was dead four days, yet he gave no report of any “life after death” experience. (refer John 11.39)<br>  The Bible uses “sleep” as a figure of speech for death.<br>  Jesus said: “. . . Our friend Lazarus sleepeth; . . “ [John 11.11]<br>  David prayed “Consider and hear me, O LORD my God: lighten mine eyes, lest I sleep the sleep of death;” [Psalm 13.3]<br>  “And they stoned Stephen, . . . Lord, lay not this sin to their charge. And when he had said this, he fell asleep.“ [Acts 7.59-60]<br>  “. . . the fathers fell asleep, . . “ [2 Peter 3.4]<br>  <br>  “And as it is appointed unto men once to die, but after this the judgment: “ [Hebrews 9:27]<br>  <br>  The Hope of Resurrection – “Awake and Sing”<br>  <br>  Death is NOT the end. There is hope.  As there is a falling asleep, there is a waking up.<br>  <br>  “Thy dead men shall live, together with my dead body shall they arise. Awake and sing, ye that dwell in dust: . . .” [Isaiah 26.19]<br>  “ . . . them that sleep in the dust of the earth shall awake . . . “ [Daniel 12.2]<br>  The next event that everyone will experience will be the resurrection, as John says, to face the results of his judgment.<br>  “And shall come forth; they that have done good, unto the resurrection of life; and they that have done evil, unto the resurrection of damnation. “ [John 5:29]<br>  Jesus said: “I am the resurrection, and the life: he that believeth in me, though he were dead, yet shall he live:” [John 11.25]<br>  <br>  What does it mean to “believe in Jesus”? – <br>  To believe that He is the ONLY source of resurrection life; that He paid the penalty for all of our sins when He dies on the cross and by His resurrection made possible our resurrection to eternal life; then by prayer we can invite Jesus into our lives and experience His resurrection power for daily living.<br>  <br>  The best way you can prepare for death is to get to know Jesus right now by prayer and Bible reading. You could pray this prayer right now –<br>  <br>  Father God in heaven, I am a sinner and I need your forgiveness; I believe that Jesus died for my sins; I want to turn from my sins; I invite Jesus into my heart and life. I want to trust Jesus as my Saviour, and to follow you as my Lord in the company of your Church; Lord please accept my prayer in the name of Your Son, Jesus, Amen.<br>  <br>  May God bless you as you study His Word<br>  <br>  <:)))><|`|rz4AUvbaaa	Soul is God and there are not many souls, as human conjecture would have one believe.

Swear off television, for example, and read or listen to the radio instead.|`|06Z3fh4laa	If all your friends starting doing drugs, would you?<br>  <br>  Wait, bad example D:|`|YZv8Ub3Haa	Give up succumbing to peer pressure for lent.|`|JDxpjT34aa	I think you're joking by asking this but if you're not since you're not religious there is not reason for you to give anything up, so why do it?|`|Johiu2cwaa	Well, if you are doing it out of peer pressure, I suggest you give up your integrity and sanity. It would be fitting.|`|4qA9Y7m9aa	Give up taking a piss.  See how that goes.|`|P5Iq6nufaa	It would be nice if you understood Lent, but I suppose there is no harm in practicing the self-discipline involved.<br>  <br>  We observe Lent to signify the 40 days Jesus spent in the desert being tested by Satan. It is a solemn season leading up to the Easter Triduum, the three days of Good Friday, the day on which we observe Jesus' Crucifixion, Holy Saturday, and Easter Sunday, the day of Jesus' resurrection. It is a time of prayer, fasting, and charity. So if you are not "religious" you are not truly "trying" Lent, as you are likely going to ignore the prayer. It's important to understand that Lent is a Holy time, not a trifle to try out on a lark because your friends are doing it.|`|PS6Pjtndaa	Well, the whole point is to make a sacrifice that is on the one hand painful (meaning it's a TRUE sacrifice to you) and to do it FOR the Lord.  <br>  <br>  I wonder, WHO are you making this sacrifice for?  Because if it's for you, just to join in or to see how it is then it completely defeats the purpose.  <br>  <br>  Forget whether you are "religious" or not.  That's not the question!  Do you believe in God?  Do you know that you're blessed mightily in many ways?  Can you wrap your brain around the idea of making a sacrifice to the Lord to say to Him, "I voluntarily suffer a little in this small way to show you my appreciation"?  If so, then go for it.  If it's all about you then please don't even bother.  It's just not the same.<br>  <br>  IF you're going to make a sacrifice, give up something like:<br>  <br>  TV<br>  Music<br>  Food (fasting)<br>  Your car<br>  Internet<br>  <br>  The point is, it should be something that you giving it up is going to get your attention. It must be a SACRIFICE!!!<br>  <br>  Lord bless.|`|U7sBZKUuaa	Your friends would have better suggestions than these mooyaks on here.

There's but one God, the God of Creation.|`|k1vdbpixaa	John, this is a good question.  The answer is that the concept of multiple gods simply doesn't make sense because the very definition of a "God" demands that He has the ability to do, say, be, create, and understand all there is.  If God is limited in any way, then he cannot be God.  Having a bunch of little gods collectively to do the work of one God who can do it all would be redundant, wouldn't it? and if each of them is not capable of superiority, then who is assigned to be in charge of them?  When you have a problem with a company, do you not seek out the man in charge?  And when you do, don't you expect him to solve your problem without consulting others down the food chain?<br>  The Greeks and Romans developed a system of polytheism where a separate god was assigned to each task.  Above them was a Head God who supervised them all, and could do pretty much what he wanted to, but didn't know everything.  I personally would not entrust my entire life and future on that kind of being, or his little helpers.  However, if you want to see the positive side of polytheism, we know that here on earth, although he doesn't necessarily know how to fill out a form or make a good cup of coffee, sometimes upper management has its privileges....|`|8bHuUJczaa	different religions believe in different things.

I think how one lives one's life matters very much.|`|3e5c9f32c95260657fe7f58b36af2eb8aa	We have all sinned in the eyes of GOD -<br>  one lie, stealing once, one blasphemy, not keeping GOD first (which would include not believing in HIM) counts as sin. <br>  <br>  We might be good in mans eyes but not in GOD'S and HE has created a place for sinners and it is not a place anyone of us wants to end up - it is not a big party, it is a place of eternal punishment.<br>  <br>  The Good News is that JESUS CHRIST came and took the punishment for us, it is available to all of us - Repentance of our sins and Faith in JESUS.<br>  <br>  EDIT:<br>  That is not a free pass to continue a life of flagrant sin - we all sin,it is our nature however JESUS paid for our sins, past - present - future, once we come to believe that we want to live for HIM which means not heaping more sin on the cross.|`|QYUNnY3Iaa	Accepting the sacrifice of God's only begotten Son as complete payment for your sins, is the only way to get into Heaven.

God has the ability to choose to do the right thing. Therefore, although Muslim's can sometimes assume that someone will or will not get into heaven, they are open to the possibility that God will know something we don't, and make a decision whether they will enter or not. <br>  <br>  the same can be said for many Christians. They believe that if God is benevolent and all knowing, then he will be able to see into a person and make a judgement based on more than any one else could possibly know.|`|WQ2FKRF8aa	According to god and the laws of heaven, no, you wouldn't go to heaven. Getting into heaven means you have to accept the big J into your heart and believe that he was brutalized for you.

But God will judge everyone based on there situation, for example if a man is insane he will be judged based on that, or living circumstances etc. If an athiest spent his life looking for an answer but didnt find it, maybe God would judge him based on that, but if there is someone who knows there is God, know that there is a way right to follow and they just say "ah forget it" or cover up truth then I dont know, but for sure God will judge us on our situation and an interesting thing in Islam, God is the most just (al-adl) and no one will go to hell but they feel that they deserve it, as in the day of judgement is also Yawmal Haqq (the day of truth), you will understand of what you used to do.|`|5JQFCQCkaa	In Islam, maybe. I believe there is a book system. Every good deed you do, one book gets larger. Every bad deed, the other does. Belief in Allah and Mohammad help your chances greatly. However, fundamentalist Muslims dispute this, and say that the sin for not believing in Allah is too great.<br>  Other then non-fundie Muslim heaven, no chance.|`|c290b7856214fd8baaebf9e77a554dffaa	There aint no heaven, or hell.

If the UK, France, and US left them alone.  it would be a huge jump in violence, and then it would all end and everyone would be happy.|`|c7pbvYmpaa	Yes|`|af2b8cb22a1ed77dda9500aaea60bf51aa	Nope. A study of religious conflict will show you that religion has little to do with the fighting.  It is all about who has power and in charge -- just like every other war. The history of religions internally are also the stories of power conflicts. Atheists fight too.|`|cdFqekzZaa	I would hope so.But let's face a basic fact.If you throw a bunch of people together in the desert heat,and provide everyone with ak-47's,fun will break out no matter what.It'll be the AC owners vs. the hot people.|`|yhTPcF81aa	No, education will cure the middle east and the rest of the world.  Nearly all of the world's problems stem from lack of education.|`|X1OUnP0Kaa	Yes, but unfortunately that's not going to happen for a long time|`|UFMvhn2Gaa	Yes it would|`|0XFV6iswaa	hmmm...<br>  Go from conflicting and false moral bases to a total lack of moral foundation... could that be a good thing?
AA10674998	Here is the mystery of the sting of death. <br>  What will death feel like, and what will it be like to slip into death, surrendering the breath unto the Lord?<br>  It will feel like this: Like one moment in time here on earth and the next moment in time with the Lord.  It will not be a long passing of time, because it will be as if you are asleep, and it will not be a grievous feeling or a heaviness to your heart even to leave those you love, for you have not left anyone you love and who loves you.  These are in the Kingdom with you and will be in the place that the Son prepares for us as though you arrive together with them.  No loss is suffered and no pain is felt, only the awakening to the face of your Redeemer full of love and adrift in the ecstasy of His holiness.|`|8IHfytEvaa	If you have ever lost a loved one who was and lost another who was not a Christian, then you know the difference.|`|7422ddf097669bd7b6e3d48e56258b87aa	This is the finest explanation of the matter that was ever written:<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.theologywebsite.com/etext/athanasius/ch4.shtml" rel="nofollow">http://www.theologywebsite.com/etext/ath...</a>|`|VcD1Q6cUaa	That is still to happen.  He is referring to that time when there would be no more death, no more sorrow and grief.  That's after His second coming.|`|UiUSsfuYaa	The sting referred to in 1 Corinthians 15:55 is explained in the next verse.<br>  O death, where is thy sting? O grave, where is thy victory?<br>   The sting of death is sin; and the strength of sin is the law.<br>  1 Corithians 15:55-56<br>  <br>  It is because of sin that death exists. With the blood of Jesus, that sin is removed and so death is no longer permanent.<br>  Fear and grief are both consequences of sin. With the absolute removal of sin in heaven, those consequences will no longer exist.|`|2aa3e62419587ab0885853d9e4a8ffc0aa	I think it means the hurt...like, if someone you know, a Christian, dies, you have joy that they're with Jesus, and you'll see them again soon (A day in heaven is 1000 years here), but if they're unsaved, you know they'll die twice (body then soul going to hell), and you'll mourn never seeing them again.<br>  Same for ourselves. If we're believers, we have no need to fear death, heaven is going to be awesome! But if we don't believe, we have nothing to look forward to.<br>   Anyway, that's what I think it means|`|PS3NKPOEaa	When is says the sting of death it is referring to its potency, or its effectiveness. Saying that Death is no match for the will and the word of God. When it says that death has lost irs sting it is referring to the fact that Satan no longer has the power of death that death lies in Gods hands.<br>  <br>  God Bless|`|HBp5r76haa	It is sin<br>  <br>  Paul says:<br>  But where sin increased, grace increased all the more, 21so that, just as sin reigned in death, so also grace might reign through righteousness to bring eternal life through Jesus Christ our Lord.

Also remember that he is the same person that he was before you knew. You can tell him that you are straight and you won't force him to be straight if he doesn't push you to be gay. Tell him you want to continue being friends and that you appreciate that he trusted you enough to tell you.|`|937d8516b6bac65675aebed05fbfdfc9aa	if it is your friend you just say nothing|`|grYkoDaraa	it doesn't matter if he does love you.  you should still be his friend and be there for him.  there will already be plenty of people who hate him just for being gay and he doesn't need another person who he considers a friend to hate him too.  even if he does like you just tell him that you don't like him that way (unless you do) and that the most you can have is a friendship.  he will understand.  it may come as a surprise to some but it is not a gay persons goal to turn people gay.  just be his friend.|`|nuCXcLUIaa	He probably doesn't love you, get over yourself.

Just treat him how you usually do and let him know you are there for him. Dont be mean or nasty, thats the last thing he needs. Just be a friend.|`|rh2cRpMHaa	You shouldn't be anything but accepting.

KTKxrP7naa	Often this is true. I first learned this in Paris in 1984 when standing on a Metro platform with a fellow American. We saw the train arrive and, through the window, saw but didn't hear, two people talking. We immediately recognized the lip motion as being American English. The door opened, and he heard their voices. We were right.|`|ZGxbry8Faa	Yes I do, the position of the lips and the tongue can tell in what language a person is talking, often if you know that language.|`|JO8FKDRhaa	yes some lip reading is inherent to people even if they havnet specially learned how to do it. yu've seen on tv how some people mouths to another when they dont want someone to hear what they have to say. certainly your friends have done it with you at school or maybe at work. i've never tried to distinguish languages by lip reading. maybe should try it.
V792ArqMaa	Are you really sure this guy is a 'real' celeb? Do you have prrof? Because sometimes people pretend to be celebrities on the web to get attention or stuff like that.<br>  <br>  If he's real and you're sure about it, don't be too paranoid. As long as you did not give out any personal info like your tel. #, address, cel #, credit card # etc. it's ok. But if he is the hi-tech guy you say he is, you don't need to worry that much. If he can get your IP address, make sure your modem/server gives you random IP addresses everytime you go online so that he won't be able to track you.<br>  <br>  I hope you feel better. It's not worth it to worry and be paranoid about such things, the internet can be a friend but if YOU take things the wrong way it can be an enemy. Don't take this seriously, focus on other things.

X9rXRNUxaa	WHAT HAPPENS WHEN YOU DIE ?<br>  <br>  Jesus said: “ . . . saying unto me, Fear not; I am the first and the last:  I am he that liveth, and was dead; and, behold, I am alive for evermore, Amen; and have the keys of hell and of death.” [Revelation 17-18]<br>   <br>  What is Death ? – Death is a return to the ground:<br>  <br>  “In the sweat of thy face shalt thou eat bread, till thou return unto the ground; for out of it wast thou taken: for dust thou art, and unto dust shalt thou return.” [Genesis 3:19]<br>  “Then shall the dust return to the earth as it was: and the spirit shall return unto God who gave it.” [Ecclesiastes 12.7]<br>  <br>  When everyone is born God supplied the 'breath of life' and he becomes a living soul.<br>   “And the LORD God . . .  breathed into his nostrils the breath of life; and man became a living soul. “ [Genesis 2:7]<br>  <br>  Note: man IS a soul, man does not posses a soul<br>  <br>  At death, when a man's breath goes forth, he dies - his being, his "soul" perishes. only a living man is a living soul.!  Dead is dead. There is no "soul" that goes out of the body to live elsewhere! No "soul" goes immediately to heaven or hell. Dead is dead!<br>  “For as the body without the spirit is dead, . .” [James2.26]<br>  <br>  The Sleep of Death.<br>  <br>  At death the body returns to dust and the life force (not the soul) to the creator<br>  “ . . . but the dead know not any thing, .” [Ecclesiastes 9.5]<br>  “His breath goeth forth, he returneth to his earth; in that very day his thoughts perish.” [Psalm 146.4]<br>  Lazarus was dead four days, yet he gave no report of any “life after death” experience. (refer John 11.39)<br>  The Bible uses “sleep” as a figure of speech for death.<br>  Jesus said: “. . . Our friend Lazarus sleepeth; . . “ [John 11.11]<br>  David prayed “Consider and hear me, O LORD my God: lighten mine eyes, lest I sleep the sleep of death;” [Psalm 13.3]<br>  “And they stoned Stephen, . . . Lord, lay not this sin to their charge. And when he had said this, he fell asleep.“ [Acts 7.59-60]<br>  “. . . the fathers fell asleep, . . “ [2 Peter 3.4]<br>  <br>  “And as it is appointed unto men once to die, but after this the judgment: “ [Hebrews 9:27]<br>  <br>  The Hope of Resurrection – “Awake and Sing”<br>  <br>  Death is NOT the end. There is hope.  As there is a falling asleep, there is a waking up.<br>  <br>  “Thy dead men shall live, together with my dead body shall they arise. Awake and sing, ye that dwell in dust: . . .” [Isaiah 26.19]<br>  “ . . . them that sleep in the dust of the earth shall awake . . . “ [Daniel 12.2]<br>  The next event that everyone will experience will be the resurrection, as John says, to face the results of his judgment.<br>  “And shall come forth; they that have done good, unto the resurrection of life; and they that have done evil, unto the resurrection of damnation. “ [John 5:29]<br>  Jesus said: “I am the resurrection, and the life: he that believeth in me, though he were dead, yet shall he live:” [John 11.25]<br>  <br>  What does it mean to “believe in Jesus”? – <br>  To believe that He is the ONLY source of resurrection life; that He paid the penalty for all of our sins when He dies on the cross and by His resurrection made possible our resurrection to eternal life; then by prayer we can invite Jesus into our lives and experience His resurrection power for daily living.<br>  <br>  The best way you can prepare for death is to get to know Jesus right now by prayer and Bible reading. You could pray this prayer right now –<br>  <br>  Father God in heaven, I am a sinner and I need your forgiveness; I believe that Jesus died for my sins; I want to turn from my sins; I invite Jesus into my heart and life. I want to trust Jesus as my Saviour, and to follow you as my Lord in the company of your Church; Lord please accept my prayer in the name of Your Son, Jesus, Amen.<br>  <br>  May God bless you as you study His Word<br>  <br>  <:)))><|`|00ddc7f7cc561904db032288ec417cc6aa	I would think you would go immediately to Heaven. Some Christians who have had NDE or OBE have actually seen people in Heaven. There was  man who was literal dead for 90 minutes, he said as soon as he died (car accident) he was transported straight to Heaven’s pearly gates. That people he knew from his life who had already passed to Glory greeted and embraced him he said he even saw people he did not think would be there. This man has written several books just amazon "90 minutes in heaven".<br>  <br>  The Thief that died on the cross next to Christ, well Christ said he would see him in Paradise that day. He did not say “well friend when I come back for the second time I will see you in Paradise”|`|AA11440601	Sometimes.<br>  <br>  + Soul Sleep +<br>  <br>  Although the Catholic Church does not accept the doctrine of "Soul Sleep", I don't think that the concept is really a big deal. <br>  <br>  In some places in the Bible, death is compared to sleep and in other places, death is described very differently.<br>  <br>  He (Jesus) replied to him (the criminal on the cross), "Amen, I say to you, today you will be with me in Paradise." (Luke 23:43)<br>  <br>  The last book of the Bible clearly talks about the saints in heaven praying (and not sleeping):<br>  <br>  Revelation 5:8: Each of the elders held a harp and gold bowls filled with incense, which are the prayers of the holy ones. <br>  <br>  Revelation 8:3-4: He was given a great quantity of incense to offer, along with the prayers of all the holy ones, on the gold altar that was before the throne. The smoke of the incense along with the prayers of the holy ones went up before God from the hand of the angel. <br>  <br>  But the most important concept is that time after death is not the same as time while we are alive on Earth. You know, the whole idea that one day is like a thousand years and a thousand years is like a one day.<br>  <br>  + Purgatory +<br>  <br>  "But if someone's work is burned up, that one will suffer loss; the person will be saved, but only as through fire." (1 Cor 3:15)<br>  <br>  "So that the genuineness of your faith, more precious than gold that is perishable even though tested by fire, may prove to be for praise, glory, and honor at the revelation of Jesus Christ." (1 Pet 1:7)<br>  <br>  But the souls of the just are in the hand of God, and no torment shall touch them. They seemed, in the view of the foolish, to be dead; and their passing away was thought an affliction and their going forth from us, utter destruction. But they are in peace. For if before men, indeed, they be punished, yet is their hope full of immortality; Chastised a little, they shall be greatly blessed, because God tried them and found them worthy of himself. As gold in the furnace, he proved them, and as sacrificial offerings he took them to himself. (Wisdom 3:1-6)<br>  <br>  Are you perfect now? Most people would say no.<br>  <br>  Will you be perfect in heaven? Most people believe yes.<br>  <br>  Purgatory (or purgation) is the process of God's love changing our imperfect selves into perfect beings. <br>  <br>  Depending on the amount of change needed by different people, this can be an easy or slightly harder process. <br>  <br>  Everyone in purgatory is on his or her way to heaven. <br>  <br>  I do not think Mother Teresa of Calcutta had a very hard time of it.<br>  <br>  For more information see the Catechism of the Catholic Church, section 1030: <a href="http://www.usccb.org/catechism/text/pt1sect2chpt3art12.shtml" rel="nofollow">http://www.usccb.org/catechism/text/pt1s...</a><br>  <br>  With love in Christ.|`|TOBYij3Qaa	deep sleep is crap, the thief was in paradise the day he died, and heaven is where God is, and to be absent from the body is to be present with the Lord|`|fbrdhY1aaa	No, they wait until judgment day.|`|pMA4xoVEaa	Good ? he did say he would have a place for us in heaven,but he never said when.|`|ulsIrphnaa	there is no heaven|`|V0oc22ryaa	Yes, when Christians die they automatically go to heaven, for Christians the body dies but it is called deep sleep (what you heard) then it is resurrected at the rapture to join the spirit already in heaven, so you see, you were right all the time.|`|U7sBZKUuaa	In both the Old and New Testaments it is stated that there is no one in heaven yet.

Jesus was chickening out out of his craze about going to the Holy Cross that it is not joke!<br>  <br>  There are some serious glitches in the story of the last days of Jesus before going to the Holy Cross! Jesus was teaching his last long lesson on different subjects. He was getting so unstable that he lost track of the questions that his disciples were asking him…<br>  <br>  John 13:36 (NIV) Simon Peter asked him, "Lord, where are you going?"<br>  <br>  John 14:5 (NIV) Thomas said to him, "Lord, we don't know where you are going, so how can we know the way?" <br>  <br>  Jesus didn’t answer them, but towards the end of this last training class Jesus is complaining that nobody is asking him where he is going!!!<br>  <br>  John 16:5 (NIV) Now I am going to him who sent me, yet none of you asks me, “Where are you going?”* (*At this point Saint Peter and Saint Thomas started to bang their heads against the wall).<br>  <br>  Obviously Jesus was so depressed about dying that he just couldn’t remember anything anymore. Then he goes to the Garden of Gethsemane sweating tear drops of blood in desperate fear of dying for anybody! He was in need of a comforter, but God the Holy Ghost, aka “Another Comforter” was nowhere to be found! Instead an angel creature of God showed up (with a box of napkins?)… The Preachers are covering up the fact that Jesus was yellow-bellying at the idea of going to the Holy Cross!<br>   <br>  Luke 22:44 And being in anguish, he prayed more earnestly, and his sweat was like drops of blood falling to the ground.<br>  <br>  Jesus started to shed blood even before he went to the Holy Cross!<br>  <br>  Hebrews 5:7-8 (NIV) During the days of Jesus' life on earth, HE OFFERED UP PRAYERS AND PETITIONS WITH LOUD CRIES AND TEARS TO THE ONE WHO COULD SAVE HIM FROM DEATH* (*This Son of a God is not an atheist in a foxhole! I never heard an atheist doing this number in a foxhole!), and he was heard because of his reverent submission. ALTHOUGH HE WAS A SON, HE LEARNED OBEDIENCE* (Yeah… naughty Jesus! God the Father up in the sky taught him a lesson just for the heck of it “because it pleased God!”) FROM WHAT HE SUFFERED* (*the Bible writers were not too careful writing about Jesus credentials, but the Christians today are willing to kill to defend what the preachers tell them! I know that Islam is much worse, but that is not an excuse to pick the Christian religion or “Jesus” or any religion at all! A lot of high profile people are declared Christians and they won’t be the first ones to change even if they figure out that Christianity is the biggest scam in the world today!)<br>  <br>  I can almost still hear Jesus crying out loud! That is probably why Jesus didn’t spend the promised full 3 days and 3 nights in Hell, but only 2 nights, one day and hardly any time of the first and last day. Jesus Christ was really horrified to die for anybody! The FUNNIEST JOKE ON JESUS that any Christian could possible dream up is the fancy artistic rendition of the Holy Cross that killed him!  It now identifies Christianity!  Showing a dead body hanging on any cross is too gross for a lot of Christians so the Protestants do not recognize the Crucifix, but only the empty Cross.  The absurd worship of so many crosses of Jesus proves the sadomasochistic orientation of the Christian religion… it is barbaric! Jesus flesh is beaten to a pulp thoroughly tenderized and heavily marinated in Roman soldiers’ spit in preparation for hanging totally naked on a Holy Cross as the “spotless Lamb of God taking away the sins of the world!” There is no historical record that the Roman soldiers ever dressed their victim’s genital area in a diaper before hanging them on any cross! The next time that a sweet Catholic lady or nun prays before a crucifix she ought to know that the diaper is NOT there! She can go ahead and ask the Pope if the Roman soldiers ever dressed their victims with a white clean diaper before they crucify them!   <br>  <br>  No wonder the Bible writers have Jesus sweating TEARS OF BLOOD begging his Father in Heaven “to pass the cup”. It would have been much easier if God the Father would have assigned a “Guardian Angel” to protect Eve from eating a fruit from the wrong tree! That would have saved the WHOLE world that God loves so much without killing any member of the Holy Trinity! You have to have a specially conditioned stomach and a pervert mind to be a Christian! No wonder they call it the “Slaughter House Religion”! In spite of all the virtual suffering of Jesus Christ Saint Paul comes along later on and finishes WHATEVER PAIN JESUS STILL HAD TO SUFFER IN HIS OWN FLESH for the sins of the “elect” and for their salvation so they can go to Fairy Heaven when they die!<br>  <br>  Colossians 1:24 (NIV) Now I* (*Saint Paul) rejoice in what was suffered for you, and I FILL UP IN MY FLESH WHAT IS STILL LACKING IN REGARD TO CHRIST'S AFFLICTIONS, for the sake of “his body, which is the church”.* (*crappy talk, but what the heck!)<br>  <br>  For his work the Bible writers have God rewarding Saint Paul with the "STIGMATA"* (*the marks of Jesus crucified). He was the first Christian to get it!<br>  <br>  Galatians 6:17 (NIV) FINALLY, let no one cause me trouble, for I BEAR ON MY BODY THE MARKS OF JESUS. (“I lie not!” –Saint Paul)<br>  <br>  You ought to know that atheists do know how to read the Bible the way it is… not the way it has to be read according to the dogmas of a particular Church brand. The Bible is full of Holy Religious Crap on/in every page! Christians need to have preachers telling them what Christianity ought to be all about because MOST CHRISTIANS don’t read the Bible and those who do follow a poached list of verses to be read on specific days of the week! There is no need to read anybody’s book to know what the Bible is all about. It suffices to read the Bible carefully and objectively! It is all in the Bible! I know that thousands if not millions of free loaders are making a living on any religion, especially the “Jesus” religion… They managed to convince a lot of people and even national leaders in this world that the Clergy and the Preachers speak for a higher authority!|`|HBp5r76haa	I would certainly try but I most likely would not succeed to save His life.<br>  <br>  First of all, Jesus Christ's death was part of God's salvation's plan for mankind.

He didn't only need to die physically, as a man -so that He would conquer death for Himself and all who believed in Him - but He had to present Himself as the ultimate sacrifice as atonement for man's sins.

The unborn child has no advocate and is at the mercy of the mothers' choice as to whether it will live or die. That is unacceptable on a moral ground, murdering the innocent. War on the other hand is the engagement of nations who for various reasons attack and defend with deadly force. Many innocent people die of course such as the Jews during the Holocaust but should we just stand by and let that happen? Moral clarity dictates that murder is evil and must be stopped, but how? Suddenly force becomes a moral option. Somethings are worth fighting for and  somethings may not be, however both sides can choose to fight or not. An unborn child, much as the Jews in Germany WWII, has no choice. Also I think the word "pro-war" is inaccurate in most cases because most people would prefer peace to war. Just because you support the allies in WWII doesn't make you pro-war it makes you anti-fascist or defender of the holocaust victims. <br>  So you see, you can have an opinion that makes war acceptable under certain circumstances and still be pro life.|`|c7db39975c64a358eab6a0044a8a7223aa	Not me man, I am all about peace and love.

So, I got lost there, basically what I was saying is love nature as a whole as you would yourself. Yea, well this isnt going anywhere. My mind is alright but it feels a bit a drift or a tilt. Strange that this would be the state of my current being, but it is. That is just the way things unfolded. Does this imply a deterministic view of reality?

The LDS church is especially known for this.  But the Catholic church has discretionary funds available at the diocesan level that parish priests can request for the use of parishioners in dire straits.  Normally this is not enough to help with a foreclosure necessarily, but possible to help out for a few months of mortgage payments or a few month rent, or food, clothing, etc.  Also, many of the 'druggies and drunks' that religious charities help actually do help 'their own'.

They also reach out to help all those in need.  But remember ... do not be worried about your life, as to what you will eat or what you will drink; nor for your body, as to what you will put on. Is not life more than food, and the body more than clothing? Look at the birds of the air, that they do not sow, nor reap nor gather into barns, and yet your heavenly Father feeds them. Are you not worth much more than they? And who of you by being worried can add a single hour to his life? And why are you worried about clothing? Observe how the lilies of the field grow; they do not toil nor do they spin, yet I say to you that not even Solomon in all his glory clothed himself like one of these. But if God so clothes the grass of the field, which is alive today and tomorrow is thrown into the furnace, will He not much more clothe you? You of little faith! Do not worry then, saying, `What will we eat?' or `What will we drink?' or `What will we wear for clothing?' For the Gentiles eagerly seek all these things; for your heavenly Father knows that you need all these things. But seek first His kingdom and His righteousness, and all these things will be added to you. So do not worry about tomorrow; for tomorrow will care for itself. Each day has enough trouble of its own.  (Remember reading this in Matthew 6:25-34?)<br>  <br>  <br>  Forgive others as I have forgiven you.|`|LiGWTLpSaa	I work in debt collections and process foreclosures routinely.<br>  <br>  Just last week I spoke to girl who said her church helped her out by making a mortgage payment.<br>  <br>  You have to remember that not all churches have a bank vault full of money.

xuuaMTmtaa	Yeah, and I can't believe I"m going to tell you this..<br>  <br>  <br>  I was in Marine Corp boot camp.  We were all out on the rifle range shooting our M16's.  They make you drink TONS of water every day, and even moreso for me becuase I'm a natural redhead and burn easily, blah blah blah.  Annnnyway, going to the bathroom while in boot camp on the rifle range isn't an easy task.  First you have to get your drill instructors attention over a bunch of rifle fire.  Then, you have to take someone with you, because you're not allowed to travel alone with your weapon.  Then you have to run nearly a mile to the closest porta-potty.  <br>  <br>  So..after doing all THAT, and finally finding someone to go with me to hold my rifle, I ended up not making it to the porta-potty in time.  I lost my bladder control.  Well..we were out on the range far away from our squad bay.  So I have to suck it up and stay in wet cammie pants.  We finally get back to our squad bay, and we have to do a shakedown.  This is where you strip EVERYTHING, getting totally naked and lay everything in front of you for your drill instructor to examine to make sure you're not holding any live rounds.  You know they dont' want you killing anyone or yourself in boot camp.  <br>  <br>  So...in doing this, I had to lay my wet pants in front of me and my drill instructor came by and picked them up and FREAKED OUT.  She made my life MISERABLE.  She totally embarassed me in front of about 80 of my platoon mates.  It was traumatizing.  <br>  <br>  Then afterwards, the 2 girls that were assigned to laundry duty, refused to wash my clothes.  So the next day when we were supposed to change into new cammies and send our old ones out, I didn't have any to put in the send out pile and I got punished even MORE for THAT.  <br>  <br>  It was a horrible, horrible experience.|`|nisfxpXHaa	I nearly drown in a water skiing accident when I was 11.<br>  <br>  I was robbed at gun point, the gun men had the gun pushed into my chest.

One of the kids tossed the sparkler towards my window, or dropped it, or whatever, and it landed next to the headrest over my left shoulder, it melted the fabric and started to catch my hair as well.

ku2tP4eEaa	Not news to me.  I have been watching PBS over 30 years.  Many of the best programs, loved by Americans, come from the UK and the BBC.  Masterpiece Theater, Great Performances, Planet Earth are a few.  Look at the success of Harry Potter and The Rings, great books that became great movies.<br>  <br>  The majority of English, Scottish and other UK actors and actress are educated.  They actually attend a university that teaches the art and science of performing.  Here is an example:  Ewan McGregor.<br>  "McGregor studied drama for a year at Kirkcaldly in Fife, then enrolled at London's Guildhall School of Music and Drama for a three-year course."http://www.imdb.com/name/nm00001...<br>  <br>  The quality of American film and American performers has declined over the past years.

AA11440601	"What separates us as believers in Christ is much less than what unites us." (Pope John XXIII)<br>  <br>  Almost all important doctrine is completely agreed upon between Catholic Christians and other Christians. <br>  <br>  Here is the joint declaration of justification by Catholics (1999), Lutherans (1999), and Methodists (2006):<br>  <br>  By grace alone, in faith in Christ's saving work and not because of any merit on our part, we are accepted by God and receive the Holy Spirit, who renews our hearts while equipping us and calling us to good works.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.vatican.va/roman_curia/pontifical_councils/chrstuni/documents/rc_pc_chrstuni_doc_31101999_cath-luth-joint-declaration_en.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.vatican.va/roman_curia/pontif...</a><br>  <br>  There are many minor doctrine issues and some major cultural traditional differences which, I believe, do not matter that much.<br>  <br>  A Catholic worships and follows Christ in the tradition of Catholicism which, among other things, recognizes that Christ made Peter the leader of His new Church and Pope Benedict XVI is Peter's direct successor.<br>  <br>  For more information, see the Catechism of the Catholic Church: <a href="http://www.usccb.org/catechism/text/index.shtml" rel="nofollow">http://www.usccb.org/catechism/text/inde...</a><br>  <br>  With love in Christ.|`|4db07412ef2c09f8393cb86bf7e153deaa	Your question is like asking "What are the differences between all the main plants on planet earth?  Like granny smith, red delicious, and macintosh.  I know there are a couple more."<br>  <br>  >>like catholic, Christian, and baptist. <br>  <br>  These aren't "the main religions".  These are three different sects of the same religion: Christianity.  Heck, they're not even the names of the sects, they're adjectives!<br>  <br>  Christianity is, as the name implies, the religion centered on "Christ".  Namely, it's the religion that focuses on Jesus Christ as described in the New Testament.  There are hundreds and hundreds of different sects of Christianity (Catholicism, Southern Baptism, Calvinism, the Jesuits, the Presbyterians, Methodists, Jehovah's Witnesses, Seventh Day Advents, Protestants, Lutherans, Orthodox Churches, Episcopalians, and countless others), but that is the one thing that they all have in common, and the one thing that distinguishes them from all of the other religions in the world.<br>  <br>  So sticking just within Christianity here, Catholicism is the church allegedly descended from Peter, one of the apostles.  Peter was the first pope, and since then the Catholic Church has had a series of successors.  Baptists do not have such a hierarchy and place an emphasis on personal Bible study and (as the name implies) no baptism until you're old enough to understand what's going on.  And again, they're both Christian.<br>  <br>  The 4 next most popular religions in the world are Judaism, Islam, Hinduism, and Buddhism.  And each of those has their share of sects too.  And of course there are thousands of others that don't fit into any of the 5 religions mentioned so far.<br>  <br>  I recommend this site for learning more:<br>  <a href="http://www.religioustolerance.org/" rel="nofollow">http://www.religioustolerance.org/</a>|`|8IHfytEvaa	I have a five page Word document which is too long to copy and paste here, which I will send via regular E-mail to anyone who asks for it and sends me their regular E-mail address.<br>  <br>  This Word Document compares the Roman Catholic Catechism with the Bible.<br>  <br>  If you like think of it as a comparison between Catholic and Protestant.|`|wZpahhHzaa	Christianity is a religion, Catholic and Baptist are denominations<br>  Catholicism supposedly comes directly from one of the Apostles.

Protestants do not.  Thats basically it.|`|pTkjGfBRaa	All of the adjectives you listed are Christian.  They are not main religions, but rather separate denominations within Christianity.<br>  <br>  Catholics are Christians.<br>  Christians are Christians (at least SOME are, hopefully)<br>  Baptists are Christians.<br>  <br>  Baptists are Protestant Christians, but are non-liturgical Protestant Christians.  Protestant Christians "protested" practices in the Roman Catholic church and because of their differences were compelled to split into a separate branch.  A major reason these groups split was what they saw to be unchecked, uncorrected abuse of power and corruption by leaders in the Roman Catholic church.  Other major Protestant groups in the United States include Lutherans, Methodists, Presbyterians, Episcopalians, and the United Church of Christ.  These groups generally follow a fixed, established order of service and try to live as Christians in the world rather than as Christians outside of the world.  <br>  <br>  Baptists and Evangelical Christians (not to be confused with the Evangelical Lutheran Church in America) are generally non-liturgical.  Services are free-flowing and these Christians attempt to live as if they were not in the world.  These churches are often called "Pentacostal" because they seek to trace their origin to Pentacost at the beginning of the book of Acts.  <br>  <br>  The Amish or Mennonites are also Protestants, but believed in an even more definitive wall between the church and the world and with stricture rules than Baptists or Evangelical Christians.|`|9obyO79raa	Taoism:   **** Happens.<br>  Hare Krishna:   **** Happens Rama Rama Ding Ding.<br>  Hinduism:   This **** Happened Before.<br>  Islam:   If **** Happens, Take A Hostage.<br>  Zen:   What Is The Sound Of **** Happening?<br>  Buddhism:   When **** Happens, Is It Really ****?<br>  Confucianism:   Confucius Say, "**** Happens."<br>  7th Day Adventist:   **** Happens On Saturdays.<br>  Protestanism:   **** Won't Happen If I Work Harder.<br>  Catholicism:   If **** Happens, I Deserve It.<br>  Jehovah's Witness:   Knock, Knock, "**** Happens."<br>  Unitarian:   What Is This ****?<br>  Mormon:   **** Happens Again & Again & Again.<br>  udaism:   Why Does This **** Always Happen To Us?<br>  Rastafarianism:   Let's Smoke This ****.<br>  Southern Baptist:   Send Us Money And **** Won't Happen.<br>  CALVINISM:   **** happens because you don't work hard enough.<br>  HEDONISM:   There's nothing like a good **** happening.<br>  MOONIES:   Would You Like To Buy Some ****?<br>  STOICISM:   This **** is good for me.<br>  ZOROASTRIANISM:   **** only happens half the time.<br>  CHRISTIAN SCIENCE:   **** is in your mind.<br>  Atheism:   There is no ****.|`|VQmHIrStaa	Taoism:   **** Happens.<br>              Hare Krishna:   **** Happens Rama Rama Ding Ding.<br>                  Hinduism:   This **** Happened Before.<br>                     Islam:   If **** Happens, Take A Hostage.<br>                       Zen:   What Is The Sound Of **** Happening?<br>                  Buddhism:   When **** Happens, Is It Really ****?<br>              Confucianism:   Confucius Say, "**** Happens."<br>         7th Day Adventist:   **** Happens On Saturdays.<br>              Protestanism:   **** Won't Happen If I Work Harder.<br>               Catholicism:   If **** Happens, I Deserve It.<br>         Jehovah's Witness:   Knock, Knock, "**** Happens."<br>                 Unitarian:   What Is This ****?<br>                    Mormon:   **** Happens Again & Again & Again.<br>                   Judaism:   Why Does This **** Always Happen To Us?<br>            Rastafarianism:   Let's Smoke This ****.<br>          Southern Baptist:   Send Us Money And **** Won't Happen.<br>                 CALVINISM:   **** happens because you don't work hard enough.<br>                  HEDONISM:   There's nothing like a good **** happening.<br>                   MOONIES:   Would You Like To Buy Some ****?<br>                  STOICISM:   This **** is good for me.<br>            ZOROASTRIANISM:   **** only happens half the time.<br>         CHRISTIAN SCIENCE:   **** is in your mind.<br>          Environmentalism:   You produce ****, so you have to eat it.<br>                 Socialism:   Sorry, we are out of **** today.<br>                  Feminism:   That's not funny!<br>                   Atheism:   There is no ****.<br>                   Atheism:   Can you believe this ****?
AA11440601	After almost 2,000 years we are still trying to figure that out. It is a mystery.<br>  <br>  The doctrine of the Holy Trinity states there is one true God who is made up of three separate but equal persons, the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit.<br>  <br>  The Bible does not contain the word Trinity. However, the Holy Trinity is hinted at repeatedly in both the Old and New Testaments. For many biblical references, see: <a href="http://www.cwo.com/~pentrack/catholic/Trinity.txt" rel="nofollow">http://www.cwo.com/~pentrack/catholic/Tr...</a><br>  <br>  Under the influence of the Holy Spirit, the early Christians prayed and struggled over these hints for a couple of centuries. The concept of the Holy Trinity (three equal persons in one God) was mainstream Christianity in 325 C.E. at the Council of Nicaea and our belief is expressed in the Nicene Creed.<br>  <br>  How this works is not fully known and is one the Christian mysteries.<br>  <br>  The doctrine of the Holy Trinity is shared by most Christian denominations including Roman and Orthodox Catholics, Lutherans, Anglicans, Baptists, Methodists, Presbyterians, Pentecostals, Episcopalians, and the Salvation Army.<br>  <br>  There is a story told about St Augustine: <br>  <br>  Augustine was walking along the seashore trying to figure out the mystery of the Holy Trinity and came up to a little boy. The boy was trying to pour the ocean into a hole in the sand with a seashell. Augustine told the boy what he was doing was impossible. Then the little boy told Augustine that it is also impossible for the mind of man to try to understand the mystery of the Holy Trinity. The little boy turned into an angel and disappeared.<br>  <br>  For more information, see Catechism of the Catholic Church, sections 232 and following: <a href="http://www.usccb.org/catechism/text/pt1sect2chpt1art1p2.shtml#232" rel="nofollow">http://www.usccb.org/catechism/text/pt1s...</a><br>  <br>  With love in Christ.|`|AA10274478	Different sects believe differently on this, but I believe that they are one in PURPOSE.

The Holy Spirit is the Father because Mary conceived by the Holy Spirit, not a person, Matthew 1 and Luke 1.<br>  In the last chapter of Revelation, Jesus said he is the root and the offspring of David; there is only one way this can be true, and it is explain in John 14:9.

The doctrine of the trinity, is based on the understanding that God manifested himself in the flesh, and that Jesus was the image of God from the beginning.<br>  Jesus made himself a humble servant, and waited to be exalted until after he paid for our sins, was ressurected and ascended into Heaven.<br>  When Jesus ascended into Heaven, His spirit, the Holy Spirit entered into the believers on the day of Pentecost. Now the church is the body of Christ, being the flesh and blood, and the Holy Spirit being God.<br>  I'm only saying this to illustrate how all these are one.<br>  God the Father was there from the beginning with Jesus, and Jesus is the image of God. They are distinct persons of the trinity, but they are not willed individually, they all have the same will, the same love, the same power. Because Jesus died for our sins, and lived as a man holy and pure on Earth, he becomes the Name above all Names.<br>  The Father was Jesus father, because Jesus when he was born on Earth, was born of God's spirit, and Mary's flesh. So he is fully the Son of God, and fully the Son of Man. That's why Jesus before he was glorified called himself The Son of Man.<br>  Because God sees all things in time at once, this plan, fulfillment and distinct persons were there from the beginning of time.<br>  It's just beyond our understanding this plan of God, and how he knew that he would be Father, Flesh (Son) , and Spirit.<br>  Although the Church is the body of Christ, Jesus is also the body of Christ in heaven, and we will be united with Him in the marriage supper of the Lamb. It will be the great day. Whew! I think I pulled off explaining this, so maybe you should read this over and over.|`|Johiu2cwaa	No, they can't.

Since we are mere humans,  and God is infinite,  we do not have the ability in us to totally understand Him.  It is True that God is The Father, The Son, and The Holy Spirit.  We can believe this because Jesus and the earliest Christians made it clear that this is true in the way they talked about God.   This a matter that we must accept in part by faith.<br>  <br>  If anyone ever gives you an explanation of the complete nature of God,  and the explanation is totally complete and seems to make perfect sense that is easy to understand,  you can be sure of only one thing about the explanation.  You can be sure the explanation is false.   It simply is not possible for us, as His creatures,  to comprehensively and perfectly understand God.<br>  <br>  I am Roman Catholic.<br>  Since you said you are a new Christian,  I know you must have many questions about Christianity.  I recommend that you read the Catechism of The Catholic Church.   It is available from Amazon.com for less than twenty U.S. dollars.    The Catechism of The Catholic Church teaches all of the basic principles,  doctrine and much of the history of Christianity.  <br>  <br>  If you have become Christian in the Catholic Church,  I am very glad.  If you have entered Christianity through a protestant church,  I think you should learn about the Catholic Church by reading the Catholic Catechism.   In this way,  you should either learn that you want to join the Catholic Church,  or you will learn why you want to reject us.   I believe that all Christians who sincerely study the history of The Church      will desire to join the One Holy Catholic and Apostolic Church.   Christianity is almost 2000 years old - the same age as the Catholic Church.   <br>  <br>  In any case,  I hope you read the Catholic Catechism.   It was updated in 1994.  The general editor was a Catholic priest by the name of Cardinal Joseph Ratzinger - known now as  Benedict,  our Pope. <br>  <br>  If the upcoming Lent and Easter celebration will be your first as a Christian,  I hope and pray that you find especially great joy in acknowledging and reflecting upon the suffering and victory that Jesus Christ showed us almost 2000 years ago.  Satan lost and Jesus Christ won.  His victory over death is now your victory over death.<br>  <br>  As I write this,  I am praying for your salvation and continued growth in your Christian faith.   Please read the Gospel of Saint Matthew,  chapter 7 verses 21-23.<br>  <br>  Peace be with you.|`|CEQpDpnPaa	water has different forms... it can be a liquid or a solid or a gas<br>  <br>  water, ice, vapor|`|K2nbcyKSaa	God is love Jesus loves you and the Holy Spirit loves you|`|B7pxO9dDaa	Some Christians for example me do not believe that they are one physically but in purpose are one.  Kind of like how the judicial, legislative, and executive branches form the government in the USA.  And that they are all trying to accomplish the same thing.  There is God the Father, Jesus Christ his son, and the Holy Ghost.  They're purpose is to save as many souls as they can through the plan they devised and they are all working for that reason.  This is what I believe.<br>  <br>  Others may believe he is one physically because he is god and can do anything he wants like combine bodies or something I don't know it just doesn't make sense to me that way.  When Christ was baptized the holy ghost descended in the form of a dove and then their is the fact that Christ prayed to god.  Which would suggest they are separate beings and finally the clearest reason as to why I beleive they are separate beings and that they are not one physically is because in<br>  <br>  Mathew 19:17 Jesus says<br>  <br>  17 And he said unto him, Why callest thou me good? there is none good but one, that is, God: but if thou wilt enter into life, keep the commandments.<br>  <br>  I don't know about you but I don't understand if god is one physically why would he pray to himself who is in heaven at the same time and why would you say why are you calling me good none is good except myself.<br>  <br>  saying this seems to me saying the equivalent of we are all god because god is within all of us or something like that<br>  <br>  anyway hope that helped <br>  <br>  in case your interested here is information on the church that i belong to and its doctrine.|`|Khw6v2Gcaa	The trinity is one.<br>  <br>  Three different jobs: three different parts of the One to do them<br>  <br>  God the Father: the Watcher<br>  <br>  God the Son: He came to earth to take away our sins out of love<br>  <br>  God the Holy Spirit: He fills one and gives them joy and all that.

A more accurate explanation is that these are titles or offices. The Bible says repeatedly that God is One. In heaven, you won't see three individual people standing next to each other, you will only see one. The "person" is Jesus Christ, the humanity of God. The name of God is Jesus Christ. The Holy Spirit does the work of God, but is also God Himself, too.<br>  Think of it this way- you have a body, a soul, and a spirit, but that does not mean that you are three people, or even three personalities.

But I will try my best.  God is one, the Father, the Son and the Holy Spirit are different ... 'aspects' is not quite the right word, nor is 'manifestations' but close ... of the one God.  Jesus is God, just as the Holy Spirit is God and Yahweh (the Father) is God, but they each have separate functions.  I'm not explaining this very well am I?  Like a person can have different roles, a woman can be both a teacher and a mother and a wife at the same time.

A council of theologians, scholars, and clergy were called together to organize the official doctrines and beliefs of the church. Confusion about official doctrine was rampant at the time.

That compromise was idea which established the idea of Christ "being of one substance with the Father"<br>  <br>  One branch that i know of that doesn't believe that is the LDS Church.<br>  The most fundamental difference between the LDS Church and traditional Christianity is the principle of the Godhead: The Father, The Son, and the Holy Ghost.

AA12034021	The old testament was written in 3 different dialects of Hebrew, however, the vast overwhelming majority was written in one dialect, I think the one called Aramaic.  The new testament was written in Greek.<br>  <br>  Most biblical scholars learn Greek and Aramaic.  You are welcome to learn these languages yourself and read the texts in their original languages.  Most pastors do.<br>  <br>  There are a number of passages that could be translated a couple of different ways.  You'll often hear pastors refer to the original Greek words and discuss connotations that perhaps do not come across in the translation.  The various different versoins of the bible differ largely in how the feel various passages are best translated into English.  For studying the bible, they make these "parallel translation bibles", where say 4 versions are printed together, so that the same passages are on the same pages (maybe column 1 is King James, column 2 is the New International Version, column 3 is the New American Standard Bible, etc.).  The point of these is to compare and contrast different translations, so that you can better assertain the full meaning of some passages that don't translate well.<br>  <br>  The Blue Letter Bible (see link below) does a really good job of showing you the original words along with the various different ways to translate the word and various connotations it might also have (which may not translate well).|`|b423d42c76a871f7b36abba90dc4c41daa	It was originally written in Aramaic and Greek.It was CAREFULLY and FEARFULLY translated into english in 1611 by a group of Christian scholars who prayed daily for guidance.|`|TyRfv0eoaa	OT mostly Hebrew, some Aramaic<br>  NT Greek<br>  <br>  It was first translated into Latin. Late versions of the Latin were tampered with for doctrinal reasons. First English translations were around the early 17th century. The most popular of these, the KJV, incorporated one of the fraudulent verses inserted into the late Latin manuscripts. Newer English translations often leave it out, since it is absent from every Greek manuscript prior to the eleventh century.<br>  <br>  As far as correctly translated, as one who can read Hebrew and Greek, I can tell you that there are errors in all English translations, and that most of them were deliberate, made for doctrinal reasons. (I know they couldn't be accidental, because no one with even an elementary education in the original languages could make such errors.)<br>  <br>  The sad conclusion is that there are only two ways to know for sure what the Bible should say: Learn the original languages yourself and read it, or find someone you trust who can read them.|`|JO8FKDRhaa	the old testament was in hebrew, the new testament was written in greek. and you are very right that we do not know it was translated correctly the many times it has been translated. as a matter of fact many scholars point at mistranslations in especially the king James version|`|KTKxrP7naa	It depends on what Bible you mean.

We have them in modern language, different languages, and even in the original languages.  People who go to seminary have to learn greek so they can read the new testament in the original language.  You will hear people talk about different interpretations of scripture, which isn't the same thing.  We interpret the meaning after it's translated, so the different versions are translations, not interpretations.

OXuhjS0jaa	The Holy Spirit is given to you as your guide.  But some denominations have "Godparents" who are, traditionally, supposed to watch over their godchildren's spiritual upbringing.  Unfortunately, in this modern world, much of the good idea and intentions behind godparents has been lost.  Otherwise, your priest or a nun might be one to consult on spiritual matters.<br>  <br>  <br>  Forgive others as I have forgiven you.|`|TOBYij3Qaa	Jesus is our spiritual guide, you dont need any more than him|`|rz4AUvbaaa	yes to the spiritual guide, but no to it being person.|`|rU6nh42Eaa	We will have many people like that during our lives, whom God puts in our way when we need it.

6ELSwKKvaa	It would be stupid to assume that straights exist and gays exist but there are no people in between. Bisexuals most certainly exist. Yes, there are people who claim bisexuality to avoid the discrimination that some people have toward gays but eventually they come out as gay. I am sure there are others who say they are to be cool or fit in with certain groups but eventually they too will be true to themselves. Since I know people who are 40+ that are still bisexual, I know it must exist.|`|2a31fdee1fddb6a3055ca7fae75fc902aa	Yes. I believe that sexuality is on a scale.

They take a lot a cr*p because of all the fake bisexuals out there, but obviously they actually do exist.|`|2DahzSWvaa	I think they're mythical creatures like unicorns.

Maybe its just confusion...|`|gQoH43bdaa	I believe that human nature is bisexual by default, (you can see this behaviour especiallly in prisons) it's also apparent in the animal kingdom.|`|18gIVR8aaa	I believe they exist. If people don't care about being labled as bi-sexual, then they wouldn't care about being labled as gay.|`|rh2cRpMHaa	I believe anyone is entitled to love who they want, bisexuals included, and it isn't our job to try and judge them, whether we believe them or not.|`|G9MIw5U4aa	I guarantee it. And I have the pictures to prove it.|`|2doNjniVaa	Yep they do and I reckon that sexuality is pretty fluid anyways|`|LkcJWrs6aa	I know at least one who I am quite convinced is truly bi|`|cVewVL0Taa	Yes, I think it does and I know a few.|`|vaoH0FW5aa	yeah, i know that there are true bisexual people. my ex girlfriend is bisexual|`|5c907c92a6c7447ccb431133ac7208abaa	I was married to a man for 5 years<br>  I was with a woman for 15 years.<br>  I've been with a man for 2 years.<br>  Yep, I believe bisexuals truly exist.

Its even worst because other groups have arbitratly lumped themselves into groups, therefore watering down our term..African Americans is a specific heritage, not a arbitrary term everyone should be using.|`|91fcc8b613eebc31050dad00a0ce0943aa	i dont hate it but i would use the term in more "formal" ways like if writing a paper or whatever <br>  <br>  but i dont think its far to make the assumption that no blacks have never been to africa some have and some have not <br>  <br>  hopefully in the future i will be one of those people WHO HAVE by the way african genes STILL run through our veins so i doesnt really mettar|`|d3A83djHaa	My uncle is black, and he hates that term.

It does not say, "Christians Only!"<br>  It's exactly to answer questions just like this one that I am here. It's to help people see the errors in their reasoning. Let my give you my standard answer to questions like this:<br>  Yeah! Kick the atheists out of Religion and Spirituality! They don't belong here! Okay, that's done. Now, who is next? Hmm? All the atheist did was express an opposing viewpoint to yours. There has to be some others who do the same. Should we kick out Muslims? Or LDS? Or Catholics? Why not just kick everyone out who has an opposing viewpoint? Where does it stop?<br>  And for that matter, why not kick them out of your city, or state? Heck, why stop there? Why not throw them out of your whole country? And why stop with atheist? Why not throw out everyone with an opposing viewpoint? Where does intolerance of opposition end?<br>  That's why I'm here in R&S. To help clarify people's own opinions for them by trying to show where it logically leads. And as I said, this is an open forum. We all have a right to be here. We all just need to learn to get along.
DapNp1Kxaa	I understood it pretty much the way you did. Even tho any of Jehovah's spirit sons could have done it, since they would also have been a perfect human, in the same circumstance, Jesus wanted to do it. He delighted with us, and Jehovah had utmost confidence in him. He knew he would be the perfect representation of Himself on earth. Jesus must have immediately stepped up to volunteer himself, when Adam and Eve fell. His role as spokesman for Jehovah made him imminently qualified to teach humans and sanctify Jehovah's name. That lesson made me appreciate all the more, how unique Jesus is, how much he cared for us, and how fortunate we are to have him as our King and redeemer. His love and humility is mind-boggling to me.|`|dmTVbpcWaa	No another angel could Not because Chapter 12 of Revelation reveals that as a resurrected heavenly Ruler, this Seed, Jesus Christ, would take the lead in the conquest of Satan and would establish, as Revelation 12:10 says, “the kingdom of our God and the authority of his Christ.”|`|7422ddf097669bd7b6e3d48e56258b87aa	Saint Anselm explains that if anyone other than God had redeemed mankind, then mankind would never have been restored to the glory that God originally intended, since instead of God, we would once again find ourselves under the dominion of a being who was inferior to God.<br>  <br>  In that case, we would not have been redeemed at all. <br>  <br>  We would have merely exchanged one type of slavery and eternal estrangement from God, for another.<br>  <br>  God doesn't work that way.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://douglawrence.wordpress.com/a-short-course-on-the-peculiar-theology-of-redemption/" rel="nofollow">http://douglawrence.wordpress.com/a-shor...</a>|`|k03dYskYaa	I'm planning to do research on this myself. I will post the scripture/article reference in the source if I see an answer.<br>  Jehovah's purposes do not change. His purpose was for faithful humans to inhabit a paradise earth forever. Even if Jesus had not accepted the assignment or become unfaithful, Jehovah would have still provided a means to fulfill His purpose.<br>  How glad I am that Jesus is now an incorruptible Son. Acts 13:33-37; Psalm 110:4.|`|tx4bRDrXaa	Adam was the first born of mankind and Jesus was the firstborn of spirit creatures making them equal.I agree with all the other friends but that's just a small point.|`|JZxZ8mKRaa	Just my thoughts -<br>  <br>  Jehovah stepped in with the prophecy of Genesis 3:15 right after Satan had gone astray.<br>  <br>  Since Satan, another angel, had turned imperfect, it could have crossed Jehovah's mind that if he either chose another angel or allowed another angel to volunteer to carry out the assignment that it could have possible bad consequences.<br>  <br>  But Jehovah allowed Jesus, Michael, the Word, to volunteer. As the scripture says, he was especially fond of the creation of man.<br>  <br>  The Word had been with Jehovah for eons of time before other spirit angels. So the integrity and trustworthiness of Michael was not in question in Jehovah's mind.<br>  <br>  Even though that meant an unfavorable experience on earth, and even death itself was to come upon the Word, Jehovah allowed that to happen to ensure the successful outcome for all mankind.<br>  <br>  What great love Jehovah and Jesus showed for mankind.<br>  <br>  EDIT:<br>  <br>  I must step in concerning the statement that one man - perfect at that - could not pay the ransom for all the sins of every person who has lived.<br>  <br>  First, Jesus himself said in Matthew 20:28, that he was giving his life as a ransom in exchange for MANY.<br>  <br>  The other fact that has been overlooked is that when Jesus died, it was not just the life of one perfect man, but the lives of a complete, yet unborn perfect human race. This unborn race could have equaled the lives of everyone who had lived, was living, and will live. <br>  <br>  But that was not necessary. The "value" of that sacrifice was accepted. <br>  <br>  To not understand these two facts is to not understand the full import of the ransom sacrifice, the value of human perfection, and the severity of what Adam lost for all mankind.|`|Xt9wIj4Iaa	Any other faithful angel could have fulfilled the role Jesus did, and fixed Satan's/Adam's blunderings.<br>  <br>  There may have been many volunteers in heaven, but Jesus was oldest and out-ranked everyone else.<br>  <br>  Also, God wouldn't have been able to show the ultimate expression of love: sacrifice his only-begotton son.|`|1aI1FSuAaa	everything changed when jesus did what he did.we now have strength to rise to love,  and strength to resist temptations we have. i believe jesus can be followed and imitated as he said himself. matthew 16:24 "Then said Jesus unto his disciples, If any man will come after me, let him deny himself, and take up his cross, and follow me."|`|eshummTJaa	angels are created beings....they are not born.. <br>  <br>  Jesus became human, became one of us to fulfill all prophecy and to be and example to us....<br>  <br>  He Is/was fully God and is/was fully man....|`|05d37286bed96dc28e6b203a5182c768aa	Col 1:13-20, here it speaks of Jesus,(15) the firstborn of all creation,(16) by means of him all other thing were created,(18) he is the head of the congregation, the beginning, the firstborn of the dead,(that he might become the one who is first in all things,(19) because God saw good for all fullness to dwell in him.<br>  <br>  We see that Jesus is the ONLY begotten son, first of all things created, first one to die human an be raised a spirit being(firstborn of the dead). As brought out in verse 19, Jehovah saw good for ALL fullness to dwell in Jesus. Jesus fits his role like a hand fits a glove. Our study lesson for 2/22/09 show us just how important a role Jesus has played in the saving of man. Jesus says when you see him, you see the Father, Jehovah & Jesus are one in thought, action, & deed.<br>  <br>  There were other spirit creatures in heaven, but it was Jesus that it was said to take delete in the sons of man. I'm sure with all the spirit creatures that did not fall away with Satan, there are ones that could of done what Jesus did, but Jesus is the one that did it & for that he was given the gift of eternal life, immortality!|`|EJHhCDcaaa	5 For to which of the angels did God ever say, <br>         "You are my Son; <br>         today I have become your Father"? <br>         Or again, <br>         "I will be his Father, <br>         and he will be my Son" ?<br>  <br>  The answer is NONE as Jesus was never an angel.  Why would this question have ever been said?  It was for a purpose, to let us know whom Jesus really is.  He was much greater then the angels, he was God's only begotten Son, which means one -of -kind, begotten.  No other like him.  Why would you think that with God and Jesus in Heaven that we would not need a mediator, come on.  The Holy Spirit is our Mediator.  Wow, what a belief system, or should I say an organization.|`|RfGTXlotaa	Jesus was the first born of creation he was the one that had been with Jehovah in the beginning and had seen all things that had happened through out the generations.  Jesus was perfect as adam was, could any other angel do what Jesus did no.  he was the mirror Image of his father Jehovah and like a son was loyal to his father to the end.  because he had been with Jehovah he knew the plan that Jehovah had and because of this and seeing all the things that mankind had been through was able to do what was needed to do to fulfill the ultimate purpose to become the king of the new system Jesus had to prove to Jehovah that he was worthy of that honour.|`|aac509d23ce8da767d68e4f377f3f4c7aa	Although you say this question is for JWs only, that is a violation of community guidelines. All questions must be open for all participants, so I hope you will bear that in mind in future.<br>  <br>  For your consideration: According to JW theology, Jesus created all the angels, therefore he is actually their father / creator. So if Jehovah could send Jesus (because Jehovah created Jesus), then logically Jesus could send one of his angels (because he created them.)<br>  <br>  Also, you said, "Jesus is not God himself or there would be no reason for a mediator. Would God provide himself as a mediator between man and himself?" That question betrays a failure to grasp the enormity of our sin. It wasn't just a "right" to everlasting life on earth that Jesus was buying back, due to one man's sin. Jesus was dying for YOUR sin and for MY sin. Your physical death does not pay the price for your sin, otherwise why would Jesus have to come and die? Death holds its victims captive, but it couldn't hold Jesus captive because he was sinless and his death secured resurrection for ALL who put faith in what he had done. Only God could do that. No merely perfect man could deal with everyone's sin. One perfect man could only equate for one sinful man. If you don't realise why only God (in Christ) could meet the demands of his perfect justice, you have failed to understand the ransom sacrifice doctrine.|`|yz6qXwUiaa	I think that any angel could have fulfilled the position.  I believe that Jehovah wanted to give the job to his first born and only begotten son, however.  Because as first born he was entitled to the best part of an "inheritance"  If he had declined (which we know by his nature that he would have never done), Jehovah could have selected another.<br>  <br>  How grateful though that we should be that he did not decline this honor and the rewards that went with it.  (True there was sorrow and pain as well)  As the one who was especially fond of the sons of men, he is uniquely qualified for the job.  Plus it is nice to know that he loved Jehovah and us so much that he was willing.

He uses His appointed agencies to call men to allegiance, and offers them His full pardon if they will repent. But because God is long-suffering, men presume on His mercy. "Because sentence against an evil work is not executed speedily, therefore the heart of the sons of men is fully set in them to do evil." The patience and long-suffering of God, which should soften and subdue the soul, has an altogether different influence upon the careless and sinful. It leads them to cast off restraint, and strengthens them in resistance. They think that the God who has borne so much from them will not heed their perversity. If we lived in a dispensation of immediate retribution, offenses against God would not occur so often. But though delayed, the punishment is none the less certain. There are limits even to the forbearance of God. The boundary of His long-suffering may be reached, and then He will surely punish. And when He does take up the case of the presumptuous sinner, He will not cease till He has made a full end. <br>  <br>       Very few realize the sinfulness of sin; they flatter themselves that God is too good to punish the offender. But the cases of Miriam, Aaron, David, and many others show that it is not a safe thing to sin against God in deed, in word, or even in thought. God is a being of infinite love and compassion, but He also declares Himself to be a "consuming fire, even a jealous God"<br>  <br>       (Matt. 26:36-46; Rev. 15:3.) Every Offense Set Down for Reckoning.--The death of Christ was to be the convincing, everlasting argument that the law of God is as unchangeable as His throne. The agonies of the Garden of Gethsemane, the insult, the mockery, and abuse heaped upon God's dear Son, the horrors and ignominy of the crucifixion, furnish sufficient and thrilling demonstration that God's justice, when it punishes, does the work thoroughly. The fact that His own Son, the Surety for man, was not spared, is an argument that will stand to all eternity before saint and sinner, before the universe of God, to testify that He will not excuse the transgressor of His law. Every offense against God's law, however minute, is set down in the reckoning, and when the sword of justice is taken in hand, it will do the work for impenitent transgressors that was done to the divine Sufferer. Justice will strike; for God's hatred of sin is intense and overwhelming.|`|Eo7KcX3Waa	We cause our own suffering due to the decisions that we make, and God allows it and uses our suffering  to minister to others...<br>  Example : I lost my daughter in a car accident at the age of 18, there would be no way that I could help anyone who lost a child the same way, unless I went through it...that is why we have to suffer a little bit...and it is not only suffering , there is much joy and peace in the Christian life...especially peace, it is priceless...|`|uAMzmAwaaa	he lets us go through trials and tribulations as punishment for something we did and/or to help us grow...<br>  <br>  if we never went through trials then we would all just end up being spoiled brats, because we would never of had to grow in maturity.|`|PX1LRBUQaa	He doesn't.

Life means suffering.<br>  <br>  To live means to suffer, because the human nature is not perfect and neither is the world we live in. During our lifetime, we inevitably have to endure physical suffering such as pain, sickness, injury, tiredness, old age, and eventually death; and we have to endure psychological suffering like sadness, fear, frustration, disappointment, and depression. Although there are different degrees of suffering and there are also positive experiences in life that we perceive as the opposite of suffering, such as ease, comfort and happiness, life in its totality is imperfect and incomplete, because our world is subject to impermanence. This means we are never able to keep permanently what we strive for, and just as happy moments pass by, we ourselves and our loved ones will pass away one day, too.<br>  <br>  2. The origin of suffering is attachment.<br>  <br>  The origin of suffering is attachment to transient things and the ignorance thereof. Transient things do not only include the physical objects that surround us, but also ideas, and -in a greater sense- all objects of our perception. Ignorance is the lack of understanding of how our mind is attached to impermanent things. The reasons for suffering are desire, passion, ardour, pursuit of wealth and prestige, striving for fame and popularity, or in short: craving and clinging. Because the objects of our attachment are transient, their loss is inevitable, thus suffering will necessarily follow. Objects of attachment also include the idea of a "self" which is a delusion, because there is no abiding self. What we call "self" is just an imagined entity, and we are merely a part of the ceaseless becoming of the universe.<br>  <br>  3. The cessation of suffering is attainable.<br>  <br>  The cessation of suffering can be attained through nirodha. Nirodha means the unmaking of sensual craving and conceptual attachment. The third noble truth expresses the idea that suffering can be ended by attaining dispassion. Nirodha extinguishes all forms of clinging and attachment. This means that suffering can be overcome through human activity, simply by removing the cause of suffering. Attaining and perfecting dispassion is a process of many levels that ultimately results in the state of Nirvana. Nirvana means freedom from all worries, troubles, complexes, fabrications and ideas. Nirvana is not comprehensible for those who have not attained it.<br>  <br>  4. The path to the cessation of suffering.<br>  <br>  There is a path to the end of suffering - a gradual path of self-improvement, which is described more detailed in the Eightfold Path. It is the middle way between the two extremes of excessive self-indulgence (hedonism) and excessive self-mortification (asceticism); and it leads to the end of the cycle of rebirth. The latter quality discerns it from other paths which are merely "wandering on the wheel of becoming", because these do not have a final object. The path to the end of suffering can extend over many lifetimes, throughout which every individual rebirth is subject to karmic conditioning. Craving, ignorance, delusions, and its effects will disappear gradually, as progress is made on the path.|`|wZpahhHzaa	God does not make you suffer.

Do you believe that just because a lot of people believe something, it is right/moral?<br>  depends on what they are saying<br>  <br>  For example, the majority of the US used to think it was ok to own slaves. Later, the majority of the US didn't think that African Americans (and women) should have the right to vote.<br>  <br>  no that is not the same<br>  <br>  2. Do you believe that the government has the responsibility to protect the minority from the whims of the majority in this case? If not, do you think that it was good that the government stepped in in the past (i.e. ending slavery, segregation, the black vote, women's sufferage, etc)?<br>  yes if they are being abused.<br>  But gays are not being abused they can marry now like evry one else. They have the same rules every one else has.<br>  <br>  <br>  3. What makes this situation different from the civil rights issues mentioned in question 2? What secularly measurable ill effects does homosexuality have upon society that makes it different from other civil rights cases, and worthy of being banned?<br>  The blacks had no rights.<br>  Gays have the right to marry now they just can not marry some one of the same sex. They have the same rights evry other person has. There is no comparison to gays and blacks. Gays are not being denied any rights. They have the same rights as every body else. They want special rights and are trying to use the I can not change argument.<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  and finally<br>  <br>  4. A hypothetical situation. Let's say that we lived in a country where there was a muslim majority. Do you, as a Christian, think it would be right if the majority of people in the country voted that all women would have to wear a hijab?<br>  yes because they run the country.<br>  Just as if I were in england and they voted to do something I would not do I would have to follow the law.<br>  <br>  <br>  Basically, if the majority was not christianity, would it be ok for whatever religion was in control to use their numbers to legislate their religion upon people who do not share their beliefs?<br>  depends on what they are trying to get into law.<br>  <br>  yes it does effect our society it is wrong and it is not normal.<br>  They have the same rights to marry as every one else has.|`|tI1NHwfBaa	1.  Majority rule is a nice way of saying mob rule.  I don't think that a complete democracy is workable or desirable.  The U.S. is a republic, a representative democracy, and we're better off for it.<br>  <br>  In the case of the California Proposition 8, this was one of 30 states that have passed such amendments.  The state constitution allows for amending by a simple majority, and so the referendum was in accordance with the law, as painful as that might be for some people.<br>  <br>  2.  You can hardly call a referendum on an institution that touches the lives of nearly every Californian in history as merely a "whim" of the majority.  This is your first mistake in this point.<br>  <br>  But you make other mistakes here, as well.  The government didn't step in and end slavery.  Are you aware that at the time Lincoln emancipated slaves, it only affected those in southern states?  At that time, the south had already seceded and viewed itself as a sovereign nation.  At the same time, there were more black slaves in New York city who were not freed than there were in all of the state of Georgia.<br>  <br>  Black suffrage came about as a result of Reconstruction after the Civil War, and was still not complete until the 1960's (and Jesse Jackson and Al Sharpton might argue that it's still not right.)<br>  <br>  Women's suffrage also took many years to achieve.<br>  <br>  I think you're mischaracterizing each of these events, and ignoring the fact that these types of societal changes sometimes take a generation or more to complete.<br>  <br>  Even so, the government benefit of my marriage is largely in the way I file and pay taxes. Nothing else about my marriage has anything to do with the government, and I don't care that they recognize it or not.  They don't bar us from living together, and they don't bar anyone else from living together, either -- with or without the benefit of marriage.<br>  <br>  I think that cries for the recognition of homosexual marriage have very little to do with government benefits or living arrangements and quite a lot to do with social agendas and recognition of someone else's lifestyle.<br>  <br>  3.  Ill effects from recognizing homosexual unions are real.  Proponets of homosexual marriage dismiss some concerns, simply because they don't like to address them, or because they are bored with hearing them, but this doesn't make them less valid.<br>  <br>  Society benefits from a marriage relationship.  Based upon sound, repeatable sociological studies, we know that a two-parent family is the best place to raise children.  Kids with both parents in a home have fewer problems, are better emotionally adjusted, have a lower instance of teenage pregnancies, lower incidence of drug use, etc.<br>  <br>  When we redefine a marriage to mean that it's primarily meant for a sexual relationship and tax benefits, we cheapen what marriage means.  If we accept the argument that two people should be married because they want to be, regardless of their sex, our next step will be to change the exclusive limit of only two people.  Why not three?  Why only people?  It is -- regardless of how often proponents dismiss the point -- a slippery slope.<br>  <br>  Many like to point out that marriage doesn't mean as much today as it used to, because we have divorces at an alarming rate.  This is certainly true, but it's fallacy to argue that this is somehow justification for changing the definition of marriage.<br>  <br>  4.  Your situation is not at all hypothetical.  This is indeed the case in some countries.<br>  <br>  As long as the law allows a majority to change the Constitution of California, you can end up with the same result of a Muslim majority running things in Sacramento.<br>  <br>  You'll see in many questions and answers here where people who identify themselves as Christians don't have an objection to homosexual behavior.  You'll also find some who aren't Christians that reject the idea of changing the definition of marriage to include homosexuals.<br>  <br>  It's popular to blame Christians for the rejection of homosexual marriage, but this is simply not the case.  It is not an exclusively Christian decision, and neither are Christians only able to vote one way on the issue.|`|8IHfytEvaa	I already answered Brian's question.<br>  <br>  If not his first question, his second question.<br>  <br>  Here is that question along with my factual answer.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;_ylt=Anv6iOVoiiKgMkaJfz39Irnty6IX;_ylv=3?qid=20090222112213AAuYXjQ&show=7#profile-info-Aa6XHuENaa">http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;...</a><br>  <br>  Brian does not think my answer is correct not because he is uneducated, but because US history has been re-written by liberals.|`|aC5yIcvqaa	Ok I did not vote on Prop 8 because I don't live in CA.  I do not know how I would vote if presented with a similiar proposition.  I would decide that at the time.  However I want to try to answer part of your question.<br>  <br>  Homosexuality differs from the others: women's rights and racial rights because homosexuality is a behavior (I did not say choice I said behavior, no one can disagree with that, it is a behavior.)  Rights issues do not relate to the behavior a person engages in, but rather a fundamental characteristic, (race, gender, ethnicity, etc.)  Prop 8 did not deny any certain class or group the right to marry while allowing other groups to marry.  It applied a similar law to all groups.  White, black, male, female, (gay or straight) you are only allowed to marry a person of the opposite sex.  A black straight woman can only marry a man.  She cannot marry a woman. but she can still marry if she does so as permitted by law. A white gay man can only marry a woman, he cannot marry a man. but he can still marry if he does so as permitted by law.  The prohibition is applied equally to all persons in society.  Therefore, no discrimination is present. <br>  No discrimination. None.  A law is applied equally to all citizens. No discrimination.

If you believe this and accept this into your heart, (not just mentally but really realise this), you can be saved from hell.

Although they tend to claim they were translated from the original languages, most were also compared with the Latin Vulgate, and revised to match it (which was a mistake).<br>  <br>  The most popular for years was the KJV, which, despite the claims of some that it is the most accurate or only accurate translation, contains a number of translation errors, most of which were made for doctrinal reasons. (They're such obvious errors that they couldn't be accidental.)<br>  <br>  Some of the newer translations have corrected some of the KJV errors, but have introduced new ones... again, not accidentally.<br>  <br>  Sadly, the only real solution if a person really wants to know what the Bible says about something is to learn Hebrew and Greek, or at least find someone they trust who can.<br>  <br>  Edit for Kyle: the errors in the KJV do not match up with any of the Greek mss they had, nor with the Masoretic text, which they also had. They were deliberate. They included a verse they knew didn't belong there, one found only in late mss of the Vulgate, for doctrinal reasons. That verse isn't found in any Greek ms earlier than the eleventh century, and even then, it was scrawled in the margin. It wasn't included in the text of a Greek ms until the 16th century.

How many times "it" has been "re-written?" Depends on what you mean by "re-written," and it depends a little on what you mean by "THE Bible." There are different ones for different religions. If you mean how many translations have been made, then dozens and dozens... but that does not invalidate it. Today's Bible has been translated by academic language experts from the oldest and most original texts available, after which the results were cross-compared to other texts for accuracy. It is not like a Bible was written, then someone made one from that one, then someone made one from the copy, etc. etc. Each different Bible is translated and analyzed by experts from the best texts available. The whole "The Bible has been re-written" argument against its validity has been pretty poor for nearly a century.|`|l3A970zJaa	Actually Bill C, the KJV does have some errors but not intentional ones.

We are all going by what we believe/feel to be true, no one's holy book is better evidence than the other person's.  <br>  <br>  In my religion, the Higher Power doesn't care what our sexual orientation is.<br>  <br>  In my religion, we have been given power within ourselves to make better choices and we have to take responsibiliity for ourselves.<br>  <br>  So yes, in my religion, God/Goddess would welcome you, not care about the gender of the people you date, and want you to heal your unhealthy addition.|`|GBKaftrJaa	He DOES want you.

Right now, you need to find some support and help. Being an addict to drugs and alcohol has you on a dangerous path. May I suggest that you visit with a pastor (non fundamentalist) or the counselor at school?<br>  <br>  Please know that I am praying for you.<br>  <br>  Pastor John<br>  <br>  Edit: Please forgive my fundamentalist brothers and sisters who seem far more concerned with your being gay than with your question. God's concern right now is for you and you alone. The road you are walking is dangerous and God wants to love you and guide you along that road. If God feels it necessary to deal with other issues down the road he will do so at the right time.<br>  <br>  That's all you need to know right now. God accepts you as you are - God loves you - God will help you find help. However, you need to reach out and accept it.|`|Ynsow6qbaa	Fairly sure God is more accepting than I and I do not thin you are i a lost cause.|`|zKOZ8Gafaa	Yes He wants you.  All you have to do is confess your sins and invite Him in your heart and believe in Him|`|fb20242b0c0635b69a6d2c2fceab8b4eaa	Yes. God loves us all. Everyone is just as bad as everyone else until they accept Jesus as thier personal savior, and trust in Him alone for salvation and not your own goodness, or works. You are right. You cannot stop being gay, and probably always will be gay, until you let Jesus change you. Believe me. I had sins that I could not give up, and continue to struggle with sins that I could not give up, until I surrendered my life to Christ, and re-surrender and repent of my sins.<br>  I must apologise for how some Christians have represented the Gospel of Christ to you. You need to repent, but it's not possible to stop sinning until you have become born again. You become a new creature under Christ, because you have the Holy Spirit. There is no other way.<br>  There is indeed victory over sin with Christ.|`|564d359090a6d360bec9ee3849107a51aa	Walk away from the gay, drug/alcohol addict, and turn your life over to the Lord, by repenting of those sins. Acknowledge to Jesus that you know He is the son of God who died on the cross for your sins, and rose again on the third day. Repent of your sins and walk away from those sinful ways, and begin to follow the Lord and His teachings from the KJV Bible.<br>  <br>   He does want you! He wants you to be Born Again by way of that confessing you just did in the above paragraph. God knows your heart and He knows if you are sincere when you turn your life over to Him and repent. You cannot go back to that old lifestyle once you turn your life ove to the Lord.|`|0PvpGjSqaa	your not a lost cause, but you should want to get clean because it will give you the life you deserve, not because you are trying to find some invisible sky creature that most likely doesn't exist. i say, find a therapist before you find god|`|uAMzmAwaaa	he does want you, he also wants you to repent (or turn from) all your sins (even sexual immorality)... and with his help you can overcome those sins, but you have to take the first step.|`|LZJPMl8raa	God wants  you too.

There are also churches who are fully accepting of people who are homosexual.|`|Khw6v2Gcaa	Yes he does. He loves you far more than tiny human brains can comprehend. <br>  <br>  You can stop being gay. Just don't be relationshipal with anyone. God made us to be attracted to the opposite sex, but gayness has been around since Abraham. <br>  <br>  I'm glad you want to find Him. He loved you before your great great great great.... grandparents were born, you know.<br>  <br>  You definately aren't a lost cause. You have a whole life ahead of you. Your only 16! At my 8th grade girl seminar, two drug girls came in and told bout their experience (secret thing, cant say much) and one had found Christ. Now she is telling everyone about him. She was a bad druggie. <br>  <br>  so of course you have a huge chance. <br>  <br>  May the Lord enter your heart and lead you.<br>  <br>  Hope to see you in heaven.|`|Qc6MqcpWaa	If you believe in God, then he's the one who made you gay, so of course he'd want you.<br>  <br>  I second the suggestion for AA and NA. God can't stop that without some effort from you.|`|dKgkHZf3aa	Yes, God wants everyone.<br>  <br>  However, I don't like how you put limits on your love for Him.  You say, you CAN'T stop being gay.  That's a lie everyone has been telling you and you have believed it.  I have stopped being gay.  <br>  <br>  I may be tempted to "be gay" still, but that doesn't make it a sin.  I have stopped my homosexual actions as an act of will and out of love and reverance for God.  He does not approve of the perverse acts of the homosexual lifestyle.<br>  <br>  This is a hard teaching and it may make God seem to be unloving and even evil, but first you must dispell the lies you have been told by good willing Christians and fellow homosexuals.<br>  <br>  They reject God and/or this idea of sexual purity because they think it/He is too harsh.  But what I have found is that I feel all-the-more a conquerer every day that I fight my urges and learn God's true character which is loving and just.  God has allowed us a mighty battle, but it is still not beyond what we can bear.  God does not allow us temptation that is uncommon among men, and this temptation is no execption.  <br>  <br>  A lot of us want an out of jail free pass, but we don't realize that fighting evil and growing toward God is what gives us meaning in Life.|`|7XsxarORaa	Go to any church and tell your story and I'm sure every other middle-aged man in the congregation will offer to take you into his home, care for you and teach you about the "love" of Jesus.|`|744c8eae5484becd40580fc96dfd8ac2aa	This is a come as you are party. Jesus cleans His fish after He catches them. You can't do it your self. Nobody can. Gay or not, He loves you. Drugs or not, He still loves you. He wants you right now. And He is the only one qualified to help you. They call it being born again. A new life. Forgiven of your sins. Empowered  and indwelt with the Holy Spirit. You wont be alone. Just trust in Him. This is between you and Him. Believe me, He wants you. He loves you. Gay or not. Drugs or not. Turn to Him and let Him turn your life around. I'm praying for you right now. And I will pray for you tonight and later on. Why? Because you are somebody to God. You have significance that Jesus would have died for if it was just you who needed to be saved from this world and its leader the devil.|`|qT9kMFhfaa	"You can stop being gay for him" -- well then you can't move on with your life as a Christian!  You MUST give up EVERYTHING that is against God's will and being gay is certainly against his will!<br>  <br>  Yes he wants to help you - if he didn't you wouldn't be posting this question for help!  You need to go to AA for your alcohol problem and TELL your family and friends about your issues!<br>  <br>  You are 16 - you have a lot ahead of you!  Don't make stupid decisions such as unnatural things (being gay) and becoming an alcoholic and drugy!<br>  <br>  God bless!  I hope you CHANGE all of your wrong thinkings and ways!|`|PS6Pjtndaa	You call out to God in this question and right off the bat, say, "God, I need you, but I won't even consider TRYING to do what you say about being gay."  <br>  <br>  Look, alcoholics love their booze as much as you love your gayness.  Gluttons love their food as much.  Smokers love their tobacco as much.  God doesn't want ANYTHING to come between Him and you!  You've said in effect, I might be able to love you ... some, but ... don't ask me to quite being gay.<br>  <br>  Look, I lost over 100 pounds with the Lord's help.  I did NOT give up my love of food, but I did stop eating the stuff that was killing.  With homosexuality, it's about baby steps.  You can keep FEELING gay without acting on the urges.  That's step one, CUT YOURSELF OFF FROM THAT WORLD!!!  It's death to you otherwise!  God will tolerate sinful stumbles, but He will NOT tolerate our sustained, continuous sinning.  If you pray about getting help with your homosexual urges and you truly fight them then you might be surprised how easy it is.  But I guarantee you that it's impossible when you say, "I can't give up being gay."  You can TRY!!!  You can hate it as much as God does!!!  You can see that it's against God's will and against nature!!!  You can fight it every day!!!  <br>  <br>  Pray to God that you know that you've lived a life that He disapproves of.  Tell Him that you don't think that you can do all the things that He wants you to do, but you're WILLING TO TRY!  Ask Him for help with the drugs and the homosexuality.  Get to a place that's away from both!  Turn to STRAIGHT FRIENDS and FAMILY to help you out.  Surround yourself with positive support.  READ YOUR BIBLE.  PRAY UNCEASINGLY.  FIGHT THE URGES.<br>  <br>  You might be surprised by the results.<br>  <br>  Lord bless.|`|TbZeLX6laa	Jesus is God, and He loves you so very  much!  :D<br>  <br>  The truth about Jesus is that the only way to be saved and to get into heaven and avoid being sent to eternal hell, is by believing in faith alone that Jesus, who is God, died for our sins on the cross as FULL PAYMENT for all our sins, and then Jesus rose from the dead (1 Corinthians 15:1-4). Believe this and you will be in heaven, no matter what! <br>  <br>  Please pray now: "Jesus, please forgive me of my sins. I believe that You died on the cross for my sins and You rose from the dead. Thank You for eternal life!" You will be in heaven with Him forever when you die. :)|`|KVlaTr9maa	God wants and loves everyone :) If he didn't want you, he wouldn't have created you.

This most Christians agree on.<br>  <br>  The question is, does God demand that you change who you are? I do not believe so.<br>  <br>  I encourage you to pray with the mindset that God love you very much. I have known too many gay and lesbian youths who have gotten in trouble with self-hate, drugs, sexual promiscuity, and alcohol. This is not what God wants; this is not what you deserve.<br>  <br>  Peace on your journey, my friend. You are not alone.|`|bnjjeBLYaa	First of all, being gay  does not change how God feels about you. Secondly, being an addict does not change how God feels about you. Thirdly, what you do or do not what does not change how God feels about you. <br>  <br>  God is constant, infinite, unconditional compassion for all things. God gave you the strength to find love and peace in your life, and when you find pure love you find God. You realize He was simply waiting within you until you were ready to accept and understand His beauty. <br>  <br>  You exist. Therefore, God wants you to see that you are a part of the Divine; He loves you because He is you, and you are Him, united in Divine Unity.|`|jLvfPh8Daa	Chances are, with mainstream Christianity you would be rejected as a devil worshiper.<br>  Other religions, however, provide a good religious tool for gays.<br>  Do not only go to the Christian version of God.<br>  Find out what will actually help you, and then believe.|`|AA11249932	You can stop being gay My friend did with Jesus help|`|PS3NKPOEaa	Of corse God wants you... if anyone ever told you different they know nothing. But be prepared because He will change your life. As you enter into a relationship with Christ, you will learn what He expects from you. Only you can chose the walk you have with Christ and how close you will let Him get. You are the apple of His eye. Everything He does He does just for you. He made the world, the Angels and all of existance for you to look at and find pleasure in.<br>  <br>  God Bless you in your journey.<br>  Hope I helped|`|pAr4l8qpaa	God wants you. God accepts you when no one else does, even when you don't. Whether you're gay, a druggie or an alcoholic, He still loves you.  <br>  <br>  You are not a lost cause.  <br>  In fact, God wants to give you a new life.  He wants the power of Jesus Christ, the power of his word to set you free from your old life.  He wants the truth to set you free.  He wants to give you genuine happiness, true hope, and salvation.<br>  <br>  He knows you're hurting.  <br>  But Jesus Christ suffered too.  Even in your darkest hour, you will never be alone.  In your saddest moments, Jesus will weep with you.  In your times of desperation or hopelessness, He will comfort you.  For He is a God of peace.  He is here to heal and to draw you near.  <br>  <br>  Be encouraged.  Know that God does loves you and that he sent his son Jesus Christ to suffer and die for you so that you may have life.  He is hope and He will give you freedom.  Just take his hand and let him heal you.

It sets us free to forgive.<br>  <br>   - The freedom from being our "own" god hand having the burden of knowing good, and being responsible for both the intent of our heart and the outcome of our lives.<br>  <br>  Freedom, if it has any utility of itself, is the utility of the Christian Faith.|`|AA10867564	Historically, it's been used as a method to blackmail people and force them to pay money to the church. "Confession" is a way of collecting personal and private information for later use. "Tithing" or making donations, is a way of buying your way into Heaven. The more you pay, the more bad things you can do but still get into heaven.<br>  <br>  In america, however, we luckily have separation between church and state, so christianity is much weaker here than in other countries.<br>  <br>  here, it's primarily used for comfort and to explain the unknown. for example, if you have some personal issues, it's easier and cheaper to pray than to try to solve the problem or self-medicate to forget the problem.

You can't just argue Christian faith is useful because _____. Choose one aspect of society that Christianity affects and focus on that.<br>  <br>  Different people have different uses for Christian faith. Here are a few different perspectives, and every one has the potential for a separate essay. I wouldn't combine any of these unless you're planning to write a book:<br>  <br>  1. - a dirt-poor family that believes in Christian faith as a way to get their minds off their miserable existence<br>  - you can examine how religion acts like a drug to "get one's mind" off reality<br>  - is it successful in keeping people happy, or is the happiness false? is it a waste of time or not?<br>  <br>  2. - middle class family that lives in the suburbs and is trying to live out the typical christian family life<br>  - Christianity can be used as a means to maintain taboos and prejudice, ie: homosexuality and all those other controversial things<br>  - does christianity keep families more simple and less complicated, and is a nuclear family a good thing.<br>  <br>  3. government can use christianity to enforce laws, so in that ways its useful, but is it the right method of enforcing laws?<br>  <br>  personally, I think Christianity is totally useless. In my opinion it's a hobby and shouldn't be used as a means to make laws etc. It has some good philosophies, but as soon as you start actually believing and worshipping a deity - that's when problems begin. we might as well have never given up on Zeus.|`|01Xuq0K2aa	Hey im mormon, and i guess some people dont think we are christian, but heres something I thought was pretty hands down undeniable.

Christians believe in Christ so thats pretty friggen important stuff they bring to the table I'd say.
7d16b3b33c15681f9d53425cac12ac67aa	@ LDSMom No offense but you're talking about the Amish not the Quakers. <br>  <br>  A really old movie that was about the Quakers is a movie called Friendly Persuasion. Might be a bit Hollywoodized but shows the pacifist nature of Quakers during the Civil War. <br>  <br>  In other places you should do your own research and look up books and other materials. <br>  <br>  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Religious_Society_of_Friends" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Religious_S...</a><br>  <br>  There have also been many famous Quakers such as Susan B. Anthony and even President Nixon was a Quaker. <br>  <br>  No, I am not a Quaker but I am a Mormon. LDS. <br>  <br>  LDS follow a slightly similar religious code as we try to follow a dress code that for the most part is taste full but tries to highlight that we are a moral people. <br>  <br>  Going over the wikipedia article it mentions something called programmed worship where the Quakers just sit in silence and then some of them speak and share moments of faith in their lives.  LDS have something similar but we call it a testimony meeting and we have it the first of each month. <br>  <br>  As for differences, we believe in prophets. We also partake of a sacrament which some Christians call communion. Quakers, according to the wikipedia article do not. <br>  <br>  LDS also follow the Word of Wisdom, a health code that forbids alchol, tea, coffee and tabacco. <br>  <br>  We also believe in having ordiances done in Temples. Something Quakers don't have. <br>  <br>  We believe in a priesthood and those who hold the priesthood can give blessings, they anoint a person's head with oil sometimes and give a blessing when someone is sick.<br>  <br>  <br>  Hope this helps you out in your paper some.|`|e1a7697c7943bcffd2fa613b82800630aa	The Society of Friends is somewhat divided on doctrine as to make a comparison difficult.  Two hundred years ago they did not use music in their services.  They had discouraged marriage outside the faith.  They disowned members for participating in the military.  They went through a 'reformation' period and a majority have changed to a pretty main stream Chrisian church.  They retain a core pacifistic and social service core.<br>  <br>  When the Quakers started they were anything but quiet, humble church goers.  They got the name because they stood in front of the established churches and shouted so vehemently they 'quaked'.   Members were driven from New England, except enclaves like Nantucket, and some were executed.  They had good relations with native Americans.  After about 1750 they opposed slavery.  Before the Civil War Quakers manned the underground railroad.   <br>  <br>  Mormons were also persecuted and driven out of their homes.  They also had good relations with the Natives.  They opposed slavery.  They were not pacifists.  They supported and participated in the nation's conflicts.  <br>  <br>  Quakers and Mormons both have special worship services where a person moved by the Spirit will bear their testimony.  Mormons have always used music in worship.  Both groups organize to provide social services.  Neither group passes the plate during worship service.  Quakers have had women as ministers for two hundred years.  Mormon women have their own organization, the Relief Society, but do not hold the priesthood.  <br>  <br>  I am a Mormon, but I found some Quaker roots.|`|AA11403222	I suggest you do you own research and draw your own conclusions.<br>  Quakers do not believe in a Triune God.

They are open to all.<br>  Mormons believe in a Heavenly Father, Jesus and the Holy Spirit.  They have a very large and very hierarchical formation and many churches and temples.  Their most sacred religious practices are Not open to the public.  They believe strongly in tithing, which the Quakers do not.<br>  Both religions rely on lay persons to conduct services.<br>  Both Quakers and Mormons tend to be pacifists, although Mormons have served as actually fighters in the military, which Quakers have not.|`|VQmHIrStaa	Quakers haven't fought any violent battles or formed militias in the name of being a Quaker.<br>  <br>  Mormons have the Book of Mormon, a living prophet and a really bad reputation among the gay community.|`|UnlqJgXIaa	Quakers leave you alone|`|GPn55rjTaa	Quakers live as if they are in the 1800's still.

98f0314f07275edc510275e3fc07f31daa	Interesting question.  <br>  <br>  I stumbled across a site that talked about many Near Death Experiences (NDE).     If you google that term you will find lots of sites that discuss this.  <br>  <br>  During my reading I discovered that there are many similiar experiences reported even with different religious or non-religious backgrounds.  I was most fascinated by the accounts of atheists who have changed their minds after the experience.  <br>  <br>  To be clear, none of the reports were identical.  However there were similiar aspects worth noting.  Some even reported visiting Hell.  <br>  <br>  This site was the one that I was most interested in but I encourage you to explore other sites as well:<br>  <br>  <a href="http://bibleprobe.com/nde.htm" rel="nofollow">http://bibleprobe.com/nde.htm</a>|`|JTu1cLkYaa	My religion teaches of the 'veil' between this life and the other side. My father related an nde when he died on the operating table during heart surgery. He said he saw his mother reaching through a veil for him. He told her he couldn't go with her and she withdrew just as he was shocked back to life. <br>  <br>  A close co-worker, of another religion, told of her nde in which she ventured down the tunnel of light and found herself in beautiful, peaceful valley talking with a personage she felt was the Lord. He told her it was not her time yet and she found herself back in her body. <br>  <br>  My grandmother, during her last few months, was heard talking to her deceased husband often. And, at the moment of her death, she reached out as if taking someone's hand. <br>  <br>  So, I believe any near death experiences are based on the person's religious views. But, I do feel that there is someone present at a person's death to help them in the transition from this life to the next.|`|EVby6dGCaa	It's my understanding that the near death experiences are attested to across culture and time.<br>  I believe the phenomenon is discussed in the Tibetan Book of the Dead,a nd that's a pretty different culture and time, assuming the report is true.

God and Jesus and the Holy Spirit: Catholics in the same God, Son, and the Holy Spirit that other Christian churches do. The next three beliefs are found only in Catholic church, not Protestant: Catholics pray to God, but they also request that Saints pray for them too. Sometimes people see the way the revere saints and think Catholics actually worship the saints. That's not true. But, they believe that Saints are in the presence of God and pray for people on earth.

The film “King Arthur” has even more modern invention in it.<br>  <br>  What do you expect from Hollywood?<br>  <br>  Or you can start by reading the genuine medieval tales, These are also mostly invention, in that the tales they tell never really happened, but they are at least the authentic medieval tales, rather than modern inventions.<br>  <br>  For medieval tales in print in modern English see:<br>  <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Medieval-Arthurian-Modern-English-Translations-%231/lm/R3KPSDORBZLMJ6/ref=cm_lm_byauthor_title_full" rel="nofollow">http://www.amazon.com/Medieval-Arthurian...</a><br>  <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Medieval-Arthurian-Modern-English-Translations-%232/lm/R2S7V81SU470N6/ref=cm_lm_byauthor_title_full" rel="nofollow">http://www.amazon.com/Medieval-Arthurian...</a><br>  <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Medieval-Lancelot-Modern-English-Translations/lm/R2SR3FRVTQ2CIU/ref=cm_lm_byauthor_title_full" rel="nofollow">http://www.amazon.com/Medieval-Lancelot-...</a><br>  <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Medieval-Tristan-Modern-English-Translations/lm/R3JLROH1RM9MI0/ref=cm_lm_byauthor_title_full" rel="nofollow">http://www.amazon.com/Medieval-Tristan-M...</a><br>  <br>  Malory’s “Le Morte d’Arthur” is generally the source for most modern English efforts.<br>  <br>  In the 19th century Tennyson's “Idylls of the King” had an impact equal to that of Tolkien’s fantasy in the 20th century.<br>  <br>  Twentieth century reworkings recommended by many are:<br>   T.H. White’s “The Sword in the Stone” and “The Once and Future King”;<br>  Mary Stewart's “The Crystal Cave”, “The Hollow Hills”, “The Last Enchantment”,   “The Prince and the Pilgrim”, ”The Wicked Day”;<br>  Marion Zimmer Bradley's “The Mists of Avalon”;<br>  Thomas Berger's “Arthur Rex: A Legendary Novel”,<br>  Bernard Cornwall's “The Winter King”, “Enemy of God'', and “Excalibur”.<br>  <br>  Films about Arthur have not been very successful, save for “Monty Python and the Holy Grail”, which is a magnificent parody. But John Boorman's “Excalibur” is generally recommended as a good reworking of the medieval tales (mixed with his own invention).<br>  <br>  Note that some of the above material is available on the web. See <a href="http://www.lib.rochester.edu/camelot/mainmenu.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.lib.rochester.edu/camelot/mai...</a> .<br>  <br>  Note that there is no single accepted Arthurian continuity. Even medieval works purporting to cover the same events are often very different from one another.|`|YXGdwwTJaa	Excalibur by John Boorman, made about 1986 or so.<br>    It is a reasonable depiction of mythic ideals. <br>  <br>  For books try The Mists of Avalon series by Marion Zimmer Bradley, or MAry Stewarts Crystal Cave series.  For the knights go back to medieval legends or some old Hollywood films.|`|yZgZJ7s7aa	Wow. Morte d'Arthur would be a great place to start.|`|s215oJqxaa	fancast|`|G9MIw5U4aa	First Knight
S4QBvAaGaa	Big black shades, a top hat, a dark tee shirt(with optional classic rock design), and jeans in either blue or black. You could wear a blue jean vest with this to look even more out of your decade.<br>  Ah and don't forget the hair and if that just isn't your texture, find a wig. I believe his hair goes down his back.<br>  Also, if you can find a fake cigarette and have it in your mouth thorughout the evening.<br>  As for Slash catch phrasing and mannerisms, you are on your own to find out what they are. ^^"<br>  Good Luck! :)
uBgMPZsuaa	"ee-sah-ahk"|`|KBaeecQzaa	sounds like ee- saa- acc (the "a" is not pronounced in english)|`|WPRAfLO7aa	LOL Its the same thing.|`|Kdph0XLXaa	Phonetically: ee-sock  (emphasis on second syllable)|`|xUBGRuK7aa	It does not sound the same.<br>  It sounds like (ie-sock)<br>  As if you took to ie from cow-IE<br>  and then sock.
UxooffHZaa	Yes, it's real and powerful, and beneficial. Practice it, and know. Anyone can be a skeptic from the outside. Get "Earth Power," an inexpensive book by Scott Cunningham, with just about the easiest forms of magic known, and try some of the exercises. If they work, indeed you know the truth.|`|VjmTK6uZaa	Yes, it is real.  But that is why many people go to God.  To help keep the witches from casting spells onto them.|`|dFBccLExaa	It's real. But it's not like the tv makes it out to be. Witches can't shoot things from wands or their hands, can't fly on brooms, or stop time. Basically, odds are, if you've seen it on tv, it isn't real when it comes to witchcraft. <br>  In general, witchcraft takes time and practice to master, and requires using your energy and the energies around you to make change.|`|SDDgbtQ4aa	What definition of "witchcraft" are you referring to?<br>  <br>  The definition of witch has changed greatly over time. <br>  <br>  At one time, the word "witch" was basically associated with "murderer".<br>  <br>  witch - "a person, esp. a woman, having supernatural power as by a compact with the devil or evil spirits"  (This definition from an online dictionary does not really apply today - modern day witches do not believe in the devil or demons, and they utilize natural energies in their workings, not supernatural.)<br>  <br>  <br>  Modern day witchcraft comes in many forms - most commonly associated with spell casting, witchcraft practices also include such things as alternative healing methods and divination.  Witchcraft, by my definition, is real, alive and well today.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.witchvox.com/" rel="nofollow">http://www.witchvox.com/</a>|`|YXGdwwTJaa	Depends what you mean.  Much is and was using common sense, herbs, experience and some psychology.  But it is possible to cause changes, both in consciousness and the world.  Just do not expect sparks to fly off your finger-tips (unless you are taking off a synthetic jumper) or anything else extraordinary.   Boasting only causes rebound.|`|ZkBLNj6Vaa	It's very real.  Witchcraft goes beyond spells and potions too.  It could be something simple and accidental like giving someone the Evil Eye.|`|bnjjeBLYaa	Yes and no. <br>  <br>  Yes, people can use the energy within them to do amazing things.<br>  <br>  No, there is not a secret community of people who are born with magic and use it in their daily lives like a commonplace tool. <br>  <br>  All humans have the ability to channel their energy and thought to achieve miracles; magic is a term applied to energy when used to accomplish a seemingly impossible goal. <br>  <br>  Magic is neither evil nor good, no more than electricity is good or evil.<br>  <br>  Email my Yahoo! account if you're interested in learning more. I am not an expert, simply someone who knows more than some.|`|175061f78daa0acce0c1ddee4462560caa	You are currently asking about ten questions that could all have been combined into one...<br>  <br>  Yes it is real.<br>  I follow wiccan witchcraft. a lot people speak of witchcraft but typically mean just magick or just 'craft'. witchcraft typically is associated with wicca.|`|LtAVf2sLaa	Merry meet yes witchcraft is very real and powerful.|`|X3lrPVbKaa	yes.
XWPOUafmaa	Santa claws is pretty sick, ****** pedo always with them kids on his lap, cumms ridin hard his reindeers with his saggy sack of special toys for the kids hes been stalkin, manufactured by santas north stiff pole enslaved elven citizens.

Naughty or nice ey? And the kids never see him cumm and go. A real four seasons greeting.<br>  <br>  But no one trumps god, just read the bible.

VLv3Vzjnaa	In California, what many have done is attempted to redefine morality so people believe that "treat others as you want to be treated" really means "take away civil rights from law-abiding, taxpaying, gay Americans."   With their new ethic of "loving the sinner" by taking away rights from other Americans and churches, who will be next?  I'm sure we would agree that treating other Americans unequally under the law is preferable to "live and let live."  NOT!|`|bgA9wLD0aa	where i come from, that's actually considered a conservative value.<br>  <br>  keep them liberal city folk from meddlin' on the farm.|`|NWnOTkwCaa	If you don't like Christians why don't you just say so?|`|edOU65xAaa	Nothing.  Try convincing the atheist Chinese government to accept this ethic.  FREE TIBET!|`|YUAegpPoaa	What could liberal atheists do to combat the dangerous ethics of "laws are codified mores and taboos", "balance of the individual rights of one against another", and the ever unpopular "one man - one vote"?<br>  <br>  I would say 'En Garde!' but mass discussion is what democracy is all about and it gets confusing when we all show up with pointy things. Instead I propose a drinking contest and the last one standing gets to write the law - which we have to try and follow in the morning even if it is completely incoherent.|`|CHZaXrOZaa	Hmmm....You mean like knowing the truth in a situation and not warning anyone of the impending doom. Like if you saw a train heading for someone that was not in their right mind but decieved by a delusion of lies, to let that train hit that person even though you could have let them know, hey you are being decieved and a train is about to hit you. Live and let live....hmmm. You mean live, keep your mouth shut...and let them go to hell?|`|4d16b72ffa495ae128ab9f89679fc203aa	You can combat that by expecting that others will not you live the way you think you should.<br>  <br>  Do not do to others what you do not want done to yourself.|`|wmSSCZ5paa	Cram themselves into their survival shelters and stick cotton into their ears....that nasty rapture thing will take care of the great unwashed!  <br>  It says so in their book, right?|`|aGXankr2aa	They can love thy neighbour.<br>  <br>  Turn the other cheek.<br>  <br>  Judge not, unless they be judged themselves.|`|a457e9a42af7d95c857ddbcfefd4f337aa	I'd say pretty much what they are doing right now.|`|KXQVRQdjaa	Yes, it's so terrible.  What kind of world would we live in if everyone just lived their own lives, didn't hurt anyone, and didn't punish people for being different!  Oh, for shame!|`|d7c8ecd624fbbc0797b1502ba6682e8baa	Atheists shouldn't find that "ethic" reasonable, either.

dFacbjIZaa	Hi FFAF<br>  <br>  I am a Christian Myself but I know just what You mean. I grew up around Fundies and let Me tell You, You are absolutely right, most Fundies show about as much tolerance as the average KKK or Nazi Party member. Between the ages of 6 and 18 I had enough silly ridiculous hellfire and damnation shoved down My throat to do 1,000 average People...ugh.<br>  <br>  To this day there are few things on Earth I despise worse than a hate filled intolerant venom-spewing Fundie. As a decent Christian I am firmly convinced that Fundies do more good work for Satan by driving People away from God than any other group on Earth. Gahhhhhhh.|`|AA12048147	I have NEVER shoved or tried to shove what I believe on any one... IF God is brought up, they show interest or ask, I will tell them what I know and believe....

God made us all equal and we are all sinners, God says that "all have come short of the glory of God". Christians should have a humble attitude when they are dealing with others that may not have had the same opportunity to know God. We are saved by the grace of God, not by what we have accomplished in our lives. I don't believe in pushing my beliefs down someone, it won't do anything but drive them away. But I will discuss my beliefs when someone asks me about them.|`|tm12aIP0aa	Most Christians I know don't try to shove their beliefs.|`|AA11232725	Because Christians come in all shapes and sizes and personality types. That should give you some hope since as the Apostle Paul testified...<br>  <br>  1 Timothy 1:12  And I thank Christ Jesus our Lord who has enabled me, because He counted me faithful, putting me into the ministry,  13  although I was formerly a blasphemer, a persecutor, and an insolent man; but I obtained mercy because I did it ignorantly in unbelief.  14  And the grace of our Lord was exceedingly abundant, with faith and love which are in Christ Jesus.  <br>  <br>  15  This is a faithful saying and worthy of all acceptance, that Christ Jesus came into the world to save sinners, of whom I am chief.  16  However, for this reason I obtained mercy, that in me first Jesus Christ might show all longsuffering, as a pattern to those who are going to believe on Him for everlasting life.|`|YbmklSzGaa	Hello FAFF :)<br>  <br>  I happen to be a Christian.

Guess what, she likes it even more when I come around because she knows I'm not pushing none of my beliefs on her.  When her son-in-law comes around, she runs! <br>  <br>  If you don't want to hear it you don't want to hear it.  And those that keep shoving it down your throat every time you see them, well, they're not doing their Christian duty, by, not leaving you alone!

Too many Christians sow hate (as in Prop. 8) and then refuse to understand that it's not love.  <br>  <br>  I'm a Christian and I have atheist friends.  If they have questions, they ask me.  Other than that, we don't discuss religion.

I've never "forced" any of my beliefs on anyone.  I only say what I believe.|`|8yE2sYGeaa	I would agree, but they suffer from a kind of superiority arrogance that blinds them to the faiths of others|`|POzCKBzvaa	Ya, I'm alright with that kind of Christianity.|`|KILFoc6kaa	I was around that a lot as a child, its one of the reasons I was so turned off from religion for so long.  It really is counter production in my opinion, it wasn't until I was 18 that I was  saved, and that came about by seeing people that were Christian, seeing the way they lived, without ever having them preach at me, or shove a bible at me, just lived.  I began to wonder what was different about them, why were they so much happier than I was, then I asked questions, that led to me being saved.  <br>  <br>  Now as a Christian I believe that the best testament to God I can give is to live my life to the best of my ability by the bible, to live as a Christian, and hope that someone will come to God because of the way I live my life, not because I shoved a bible at them, because I truly don't think it works.  <br>  <br>  If someone asks I will answer, if someone notices I will say, but I truly will just be Christian, and have had many people notice, notice the change, the difference and then come to me.|`|d78420f6881261db90170d41d16536a0aa	Sunburst, you'd be broke considering that atheists account for 7% of the U.S. population. You don't like that we express our opinions on Y/A? I don't care what you believe, just stop shoving it into my government.<br>  <br>  Edit: and they're primarily congregated within blue states. In my state, being an atheist is like being a needle in a haystack. I'm not hypocritical when I say Christians run *everything* and then they cry persecution. It's just a fact. You're crying about us not tolerating your right to be intolerant? Get a grip.

b371fd5225e0f0948944cb7d323618b7aa	i think it is important for you (all) to learn the bible so that you can argue from their perspective. when you get the type that wants to quote scripture at you, it really throws a wrench into their argument when you do it back at them.<br>  <br>  edit: @ "Bride of Christ" the passage you are mindlessly repeating has nothing to do with a statement of sin against gay people. the sin is mentioned in the previous sentences which you conveniently neglected to mention where the people rejected god. god, in his rage, punishes these people by the methods described in the passages you cite. if you were a straight man (the bible is directed at men) and you suddenly began to uncontrollably lust for other men then this would feel like a torture to you beforehand.<br>  <br>  it would not actually be torture but the goal of the passage is to frighten the reader away from rejecting god.|`|MhfneF0xaa	Well, I agree as to your assessment of Old Testament passages.

If there were any light/truth in what you are claiming (Isaiah 8:20), then the "religions" would have already accepted God's Truth on this subject.  But you are letting yourself be blinded (John 8:31,32) as a result of being overly concerned for your daughter.  You are correct to continue to love and support your daughter -- but not at the expense of compromising on God (Matthew 12:46-50; 19:29).

(There *are* those spiritual paths that seem to have a higher percent of "truth content" to them -- as best i can discern -- than do others.)<br>  <br>  My perspective is that Divine Wisdom is present (to some extent) in *every* religion & non-religion.  This is the "truth" component in every religion & non-religion.<br>  <br>  Then there is human vanity, human ego (in all its ignorance -- & sometimes arrogance -- *claiming* to know), human superstition, ambition, greed, seeking power-over-others that begets the *falsehoods* in every religion & non-religion.<br>  <br>  The simple fact is:  *every* religion is a mixture of truth & falsehood -- & sensible individuals strive to discern what is true & what is false in each one of them upon which they choose to expend the effort.  Overall, probably every religion has *some* truths to reveal that are not revealed (at least in that way) in the others.  This includes even Voudun, Thelema & Satanism.  i read maybe 20 pages in Anton LaVey's Satanic Bible, maybe 30 years ago... & remember that some of what he said *was* true!<br>  <br>  There being so *many* of them, in your list, i suspect that next-to-no-one would have the time to check out *all* of them -- to any significant measure of real depth.<br>  <br>  There are *lots* of things that are untrue in the Christian Bible & in the Qu'ran.  <br>  <br>  If there *is* one scripture in the world where you'd probably be relatively *safe* believing *every* word in it -- i'd say it would be the Tao Te Ching.  (But later Taoism incorporated a lot of superstition.)  And you won't go wrong with Khalil Gibran's The Prophet & *most* of the content of The Gospel According To Thomas.  i think the wisdom, in these three, pretty much speaks for its self.  i don't think the truths therein need any defending; they should be self-evident to any with sufficient discernment.  These are *Wisdom Teachings,* not religious dogma & theology!<br>  <br>  My philosophy is:  find as much truth & wisdom anywhere (& everywhere) you can.  More wisdom can be gleaned from carefully observing, caring for & listening to a 3 year old child than from many a preacher's or iman's sermons!<br>  <br>  The Universal Living Scriptures include *every* life-form, *every* life -- all DNA, all energy.  *Each* of our lives forms a "chapter" in the Divine Numinosum's Scriptures of Time & Eternity.  The songs of the birds, singing up the sun, are *fully* as holy & as important in the cosmos as human prayers to *whatever* deity.|`|xo1fabj6aa	Christianity. Without faith no proof will be enough.

As such, I'd say there is a 100% chance that ALL the "religions" on your list are not true.   <br>  <br>  "Religion" is an invention of man.  Given the level of division, it's clear that your list represents a whole bunch of man-made religions based on a few core beliefs. If you asked about those core beliefs, I'd might be able to mount an argument that there's a 100% chance one of them is "true", but the individual religions built by human beings???...the odds are 100% they are ALL wrong about something!<br>  <br>  Second thought, odds are irrelevant.  Calculating odds requires evidence and given the fact that most of the "ownership claims" that form the foundation of the core beliefs I mentioned (e.g., the biblical God and a few others) establish faith (a choice to believe without evidence) as a prerequisite for perceiving anything about that god.  All make claims of supernatural abilities and characteristics beyond the comprehension of human beings.  <br>  <br>  As such, it is impossible to calculate odds, or perhaps more accurately, any answer besides "100%" reveals a lack of faith that negates any suggestion you know or understand anything about the nature of God (or any other god that claimed to be superior to humans).<br>  <br>  Final thought, given what I said, I'd say that the odds are 100% that the biblical God IS the creator with legitimate ownership rights over this planet and everything on it. I accept that my initial decision to believe was based on faith alone, but I accepted that it was beyond my ability to calculate odds and that if there was a truth to be found, a choice to believe was the first step.  HOWEVER, after 30+ years of actively testing and experimenting and selectively obeying (or not) virtually everything I read in the bible about what God thought I should do, my faith is now supported by something that goes beyond odds to certainty.  Based on my own life experiences, I'm convinced that the bible reveals a knowledge of human nature that goes beyond what we understand today and the suggestion that a bunch of people who lived a few thousand years ago could have made this stuff up is ludicrous.|`|iOPgJ1fNaa	You have not listed my faith here: Atheism<br>  <br>  Atheism is the best of all religions because we the followers of atheism are only peace lovers and care for humanity's betterment.<br>  <br>  So the odds of my religion being best does not arise ever and hence not listed in your list.<br>  <br>  Thanks for indirectly confirming that ATHEISM is the best.|`|y1CRemnPaa	well, from the stand point of probability, you have a zero percent change of worshiping the correct god, as there are an infinite number of potential gods.<br>  <br>  as the denominator of a fraction approaches infinity, the value of the fraction approaches zero.|`|p56b0RZcaa	There can not be more than one religion.

Thus my faith is one of devotion to universal spiritual principles, God's universal intellect and love and becoming more in tune with God, being more in tune with the nature that God created, and having more inner harmony and enlightenment. <br>  My personal "proof" of faith is a kind of inner knowing combined with scientific proof and verification from spiritual texts that I consider valid and untainted. So, it is hard to "prove" my beliefs wrong.

Mr. Harold Hill, President of the Curtis engine Company in Baltimore, and a consultant in the space programmes, relates the following incident:<br>  "One of the most amazing things that God has for us today happened recently to our astronauts and space scientists at Green Belt, Maryland. They were checking out the positions of the sun, moon and planets out in space where they would be 100, and 1000 years from now. We have to know this as we do not want a satellite to collide with any of these in its orbits. We have to lay out the orbits in terms of the life of the satellite and where the planets will be so the whole project will not bog down.<br>  Computer measurements and data were run back and forth over the centuries when suddenly it came to a halt, displaying a red signal, which meant that either there was something wrong with the information fed into it, or with the results as compared to the standards. They called in the service department to check it out, and the technicians asked what was wrong. The scientists had discovered that somewhere in space in elapsed time a day was missing. Nobody seemed able to come up with a solution to the problem.<br>  Finally one of the team, a Christian, said: "You know, when I was still in Sunday School, they spoke about the sun standing still…"<br>  While his colleagues didn’t believe him, they did not have an answer either, so they said: "Show us."<br>  He got a Bible and opened it at the book of Joshua where they found a pretty ridiculous statement for any one with ‘common sense’. There they read about the Lord saying to Joshua: "Fear them not, I have delivered them into thy hand; there shall not be a man of them stand before thee." (Joshua 10:8).<br>  Joshua was concerned because the enemy had surrounded him, and if darkness fell, they would overpower him. So Joshua asked the Lord to make the sun stand still! That’s right – "And the sun stood still and the moon stayed, until the people had avenged themselves upon their enemies. Is this not written in the book of Ja’-sher? So the sun stood still in the midst of heaven and hastened not to go down about a whole day." (Joshua 10:13).<br>  The astronauts and scientists said: " There is the missing day!"<br>  They checked the computers going back into the time it was written and found it, but it was not close enough. The elapsed time that was missing back in Joshua’s day was 23 hours and 20 minutes – not a whole day. They read the Bible again and there it was: "about (approximately) a day." These little words in the Bible were important, but they were still in trouble, because another 40 minutes were still unaccounted for, and this could mean trouble 1000 years from now. Forty minutes had to be found because it can be multiplied many times over in orbits. As the Christian employee thought about it, he remembered somewhere in the Bible which said the sun went backwards. The scientists told him he was out of his mind, but once again they opened the Book and read these words in 2 Kings. Hezekiah, on his deathbed, was visited by the prophet, Isaiah, who told him he was not going to die. Hezekiah asked for some sign as proof. Isaiah said: "Shall the sun go forward ten degrees, or go back ten degrees?" And Hezekiah answered: "It is a light thing for the shadow to go down ten degrees; nay, but let the shadow return backwards ten degrees."<br>  And Isaiah the prophet cried unto the Lord, and He brought the shadow ten degrees backward, by which it had gone down in the dial of Ahaz." (2 Kings 20:9 -11).<br>  Ten degrees is exactly 40 minutes! Twenty-three hours and twenty minutes in Joshua, plus 40 minutes in 2 Kings accounted for the missing day in the universe!<br>  Isn’t this amazing? Our God is rubbing their noses in His Truth!<br>  Forward this to as many people who would think this is equally astounding.

We are above the animals of the earth because God gave Adam the right to name each one and have dominion over them. He lost that right when he sinned, and because an animal was used for Satan to enter and tempt him and Eve, God took the ability for them to communicate with us. So they couldn't be used again.

You may need to ask him to clarify what he means by "like" - Is he attracted to you?  Is he in love with you?

bpr0ONbAaa	Hello. I am Indian and let me tell you that India is very diverse. That movie only shows poverty but the fact is that majority of Indians are middle class. And about the looks, indians are very diverse. I am from the Kashmir region- the northern most part of India and I always get mistaken for middle eastern. The south indians are darker. Majority of population is mixed in North India. As far north as you go, the people get lighter in their skin complexion. It is very much possible for an Indian to look latin, middle eeastern and even white.<br>  <br>  @Asker: What are considered Indian features? Indian is a nationality not a race.  Americans have very little exposure to Indians- I agree with answer above in that<br>  <br>  @Asker: You don't see the dark Indians because mostly they are not very good looking. It's not just about dark skin. There are dark actors and actresses but  alot of dark people do not have sharp features and they are not very beautiful. I'm talking about dark Indians only. And another reason is that dark indians are usually found in south india. THey have their OWN FILM INDUSTRY and they do not know hindi so it is impossible for them to act in bollywood as they do not know the language<br>  @asker!: why in america a  person with a big nose and no sharp jawline considered ugly? because it just doesn't appeal to the eye. same thing there.<br>  <br>  @asker: not caste system. The caste sytem has veyr little to do with it. A lot of brahmins- top caste people have dark skin. The standard of beauty stems from British colonism and also Mughal rule and Aryan invasion in India. That was hundred of years ago.|`|daf653722b9a000bcaed6ea65b1dc5e6aa	Yes, sir, the characters represent India and Indians as a whole, ONLY if you agree that the characters in, say, "Naked Gun" represents America, and Americans as a whole.<br>  <br>  The lady is from India, in fact she was born in Mumbai.|`|sBdOzbx5aa	Pinto as in the type of beans prevalent in Mexican culture.

AA11935435	The Holy Scriptures tell us the personal name of the Father is Jehovah. They inform us that the Son is Jesus Christ. But nowhere in the Scriptures is a personal name applied to the holy spirit.<br>  Acts 7:55,?56 reports that Stephen was given a vision of heaven in which he saw “Jesus standing at God’s right hand.<br>  Does the Bible agree with those who teach that the Father and the Son are not separate and distinct individuals?<br>  (Matt. 26:39) “Going a little farther he [Jesus Christ] fell on his face and prayed, ‘My Father, if it be possible, let this cup pass from me; nevertheless, not as I will, but as thou wilt.’” (If the Father and the Son were not distinct individuals, such a prayer would have been meaningless. Jesus would have been praying to himself, and his will would of necessity have been the Father’s will.)<br>  (John 8:17, 18), “[Jesus answered the Jewish Pharisees:] In your law it is written that the testimony of two men is true; I bear witness to myself, and the Father who sent me bears witness to me.” (So, Jesus definitely spoke of himself as being an individual separate and distinct from the Father.)<br>  (1Corinthians11:3)(3BKJV)But I would have you know, that the head of every man is Christ; and the head of the woman is the man; and the head of Christ is God. Jesus cannot be above himself can he? No for it takes two persons for one to be above another! and so if Jesus is below God he cannot be God at the same time can he, nor can he be the same person at the same time can he? Clearly the Scriptures do not support the belief that Jesus is God, no, nor do they explain such a belief. Yet Jesus did tell us who he is, but, he did not say that he was God, no, he said he is God's son(John10:36 see also Matthew3:16,17).|`|tI1NHwfBaa	I reconcile it by understanding the context.  There are numerous other verses where Jesus equates himself with God.  Here's why these don't contradict.<br>  <br>  In John 5, Jesus is talking about the fact that God and scripture testify of him.  He says that he is not seeking glory from man, and is not after their recognition.  He goes on to say that men seek men's glory, not God's.<br>  <br>  Clearly Jesus is not talking about worship.  You will find many instances in scripture where others kneeled before Jesus or worshiped Jesus, but you will not find where he ever forbade them from doing so.<br>  <br>  In John 8:50, Jesus is esstentially saying the same thing as above.  In verse 54, he expounds upon this, saying "If I glorify myself, my glory means nothing.  It is my father -- God --  who glorifies me."  If I told you I was God, I'd be glorifying myself, and it would mean nothing.  If you saw that God was glorifying me, however, that'd be significant.  And that's what Jesus is saying here.<br>  <br>  Again, there's no contradiction.  Jesus is simply saying that he's not in this for the fame and the glory and the recognition of men.<br>  <br>  This is not the same thing as accepting worship.|`|AA11707311	Jesus, as God in human form was a model of humility, based on the spiritual superiority of God the Father. Jesus, being fully human, and fully God, had to set this example. To be humble is very important.|`|bf2b826fb186efa4963970654d24ac34aa	I read the passages that come before and the ones that come after so I have them in full context. In that section of John (ch5), He was admonishing the group for seeking praise from one and another and not seeking the praise that comes only from God. As for John 8, go back and read verses 31-58 so you get it in full context.<br>  <br>  I believe in the God the Father, God the Son, and God the Holy Spirit because throughout the New Testament Jesus constantly tells us that He is the Father's Son and the one whom God sent. His word is enough for me.|`|zKOZ8Gafaa	Remember that God commanded that there is no way to heaven except through Jesus, the redeemer of our sins who died for us and gave us salvation and everlasting life if we invite Him in our heart and believe in Him and His Word.|`|NWnOTkwCaa	Paul writes that Jesus temporarily set aside HIs divinity in order to a) be like us and b) glorify the Father|`|qxteTM9Kaa	because of the first chapter of John!|`|AA11648578	Nothing at all to reconcile Jesus is the Son who is God who became a man under the law to save you from your sin. We are created in the triune image of  God. Made first flesh and then spirit and became a living soul. The flesh should be in submission to the spirit as Christ is in submission to the Father. If you actually read the verses you quoted thay demonstrate the truth that is throughout the scriptures.<br>  Jesus is as Isaiah said he would be God with us and is God in the flesh. The word which is God which became flesh.<br>  <br>  Edit I speak the truth has apparently nto receved the complete truth from God. You both quote John<br>  Yet apparently missed the first chapter.<br>  <br>  John 1:1 In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God. <br>    2 The same was in the beginning with God. <br>  <br>  Yes the word became flesh...so here you have God the man who did pray to God the Father and we also know there is only ONE God.<br>  Moses explained our creation in God's image.<br>  <br>  God said " Let US create man in OUR image."<br>  <br>  Gen.2:7 And the Lord God formed man of the dust of the ground, and breathed into his nostrils the breath of life; and man became a living soul. <br>  <br>  <br>  God formed man form the dust (flesh)<br>  God breathed in life (spirit)<br>  Man became a living soul (soul)<br>  <br>  We are more than flesh with an eternal spirit in the image of God who is Father, Son and Holy Spirit and is ONE God.<br>  <br>  To claim Jesus as the Son of God and not God is against the teachings of the entire Bible and is indeed polytheism.|`|RGe6Et0Xaa	You are quoting from a book that explicitly identifies Jesus as God. I don't see the problem, honestly. Many passages in the New Testament specify that Jesus "took the form of a servant" and humbled himself. The fact that he did not seek glory from men has no real bearing on the subject.|`|xo1fabj6aa	Not sure what version you are reading. The King James at 5:41 reads "I receive not honour from men." He did not receive honor here on Earth. He was persecuted and killed. <br>  <br>  As for worshiping Jesus. The apostles worshiped Him. The Bible says all will worship Him. You need to remember Jesus was both 100% God and 100% man. Many of His statements only make sense when you remember that.|`|87f3a97394d3a4fe5774bb71ca8eef5caa	It is crucial that you understand Christ in order to understand how salvation works.<br>  <br>  "For let this mind be in you, which was also in Christ Jesus, <br>  Who being in the form of God, thought it not robbery to be equal with God: But emptied himself, taking the form of a servant, being made in the likeness of men, and in habit found as a man." Phillipians 2:7<br>  <br>  This means that God (Jesus) undoes man's sin of "grasping" at divinity, by "letting go" of his own divine prerogatives!!!God the Son (Jesus) united himself to a perfect human nature and thus represents us perfectly before God the Father! Therefore, Jesus through the human nature prayed to and submitted to God the Father, becoming a slave, out of LOVE for us! Jesus' perfect obedience to the Father all the way to death in PERFECT LOVE saves us!|`|db7df25ea31227e5641d5c32d43c3bcdaa	you are taking the meaning he said out of context.<br>  <br>  Jesus while on earth said I did not come to seek glory from men. He came to die on the cross.<br>  <br>  The previous verses says<br>  John 5:39  Search the Scriptures; for in them ye think ye have eternal life: and they are they which testify of me. <br>  <br>  It is Jesus who gives eternal life not the scriptures<br>  <br>  He didn't come to glorify himself. <br>  <br>  God did say<br>  Rom 14:10  But why dost thou judge thy brother? or why dost thou set at naught thy brother? for we shall all stand before the judgment seat of Christ. <br>  Rom 14:11  For it is written, As I live, saith the Lord, every knee shall bow to me, and every tongue shall confess to God. <br>  <br>  We will all bow to Jesus and give account of ourselves.<br>  Phi 2:9  Wherefore God also hath highly exalted him, and given him a name which is above every name: <br>  Phi 2:10  That at the name of Jesus every knee should bow, of things in heaven, and things in earth, and things under the earth; <br>  Phi 2:11  And that every tongue should confess that Jesus Christ is Lord, to the glory of God the Father. <br>  <br>  Lord in greek means supreme authority, God.<br>  So yes we are to worship Jesus as god.|`|zUMvC6QEaa	They are self explanatory.

He who believes in me will live, even though he dies;  and whoever lives and believes in me will never die. Do you believe this?" <br>  <br>  emph vs28-30 (of John 10) "I give them eternal life, and they shall never perish; no one can snatch them out of my hand. v29 My Father, who has given them to me, is greater than all; no one can snatch them out of my Father's hand. v30 I and the Father are one." <br>  <br>  In the claim that Jesus could provide Eternal life He was making Himself Equal with God. To claim to be "God's Son" was to claim to be the Messiah. (The Messiah was to be, in accordance with the prophecy of Scripture, the incarnation of G-D Eternal, i.e, God in human flesh, "Immanuel" and literally "God with us" Matthew 1:23 cf Isaiah 7:14, 9:6) Jesus made BOTH of these claims, then claimed Equality with God in vs 30. <br>  <br>  This is why Jesus said, “I and the Father are one" (John 10:30)<br>  He was building upon The Shema (Deutronomy 6:4) “Shema Y'israel Adonai Eloheinu, Adonai Echad.”  i.e, “Listen, Israel: The Eternal is our God, the Eternal one alone!”  OR “Hear, O Israel: The Lord our God, The Lord is one.” (NIV) or “The Lord our God is one Lord” or “The Lord is our God, the Lord is one” or “The Lord is our God, the Lord alone.”  echad (’echad) = one. (united, i.e, one; first, alike, alone, altogether; a numeral from ’ached which means “to unify”;) <br>  “Echad (’echad) speaks of a compound or collective unity which comprises more than one person, i.e, one crowd, one people, one nation."<br>  Adonai Eloheinu Adonai Echad. The Lord our God, the Lord is one. (i.e, The Lord is Unified, united, alike, altogether ONE.)<br>  <br>  This is why they wanted to stone him, "For blashphemy" because as they said, "you, a mere man, claim to be God." v33<br>  Jesus had claimed to be the living embodiment, the personified, exemplified, exact representation of the Almighty God in human flesh.<br>  <br>  The Father is not the Son, and the Son is not the Spirit, neither the Spirit the Father or the Son. They are three seperate aspect of ONE Eternal Being. A three-in-one unified being. ’echad.  A Trinity is not the same thing as a Triad. G-D is a Trinity, not a Triad.  Hence, Jesus and the Father are One (J 10:30) and hence why Jesus can provide Eternal Life (J 10:28-33, 11:25-26) because HE IS GOD.<br>  <br>  xoxo ?

How sick and twisted is that?<br>  <br>  The miracle is not the random chance event, the miracle is the transformation of the random chance event, the twist of fate, the unexpected surprise, hope where we least expect it.<br>  <br>  Suffering that leads to a change in behavior, people who find meaning amidst their tragedy, someone with power protecting someone without from being taken advantage of, someone leaving behind habits painful to themselves and others to turn a new page and begin a new day.  All of these things are miracles.  In a world full of S***, where people act only out of their own self-interest, where there's so much pain that sometimes it feels like we can hardly stand, these things are God-d*** miracles.<br>  <br>  Yes, random chance often ends badly, but when it ends leaving the world better than it was, a little lighter, a little brighter, this is a sign that God is active in creation, making miracles happen every day, preventing the world from being worse than it is.  The worlds not supposed to be like it is.  It's supposed to be better, and sometimes it is.  That's how we tell miracles and random chance apart.|`|FsX5VoXKaa	in the Bible, the word "Chance " is qara in hebrew, which translates to God -ordained chance ..<br>  <br>  This is what Solomon meant when he said<br>  <br>  the race does not go to the swift,<br>  nor the battle to the strong,<br>  nor the wealth to the wise(human wisdom),<br>  nor favor to the skilled/gifted<br>  <br>  but time and qara happen to them all.<br>  <br>  <br>  Look at our world today.

The mathematics of probability will often be of use in predicting, but not determining the outcome of a random event.  For example is you are playing roulette and the ball lands on red or black or 0 (or 00 if you are playing on a European style wheel)  that's random chance.<br>  <br>  If, on the other hand, you have stage III brest cancer that has metastasized to your liver AND bones; and you have been through months of chemo and radiation, and nothing has worked, and you are to weak to get out of bed, and have been sent home because the doctors decided it was terminal...and then all of a sudden you get completely better...that's a miracle. <br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.thefloridacatholic.org/orl/2008_orl/2008_orlarticles/20080208_orl_miracle_midst.php" rel="nofollow">http://www.thefloridacatholic.org/orl/20...</a><br>  <br>  BTW you might want to google the phrase "devil's advocate" to see where it comes from.|`|AA11440601	People are not suddenly healed of leprosy, blindness, or even cancer by random chance.<br>  <br>  A miracle is a sign or wonder, such as a healing or the control of nature, which can only be attributed to divine power. <br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.usccb.org/catechism/text/glossary.shtml#m" rel="nofollow">http://www.usccb.org/catechism/text/glos...</a><br>  <br>  With love in Christ.|`|NWnOTkwCaa	There are no coincidences in God's universe(s).

UWlRLXvRaa	Rarely because most of them approach Christianity and religion from a purely theoretical standpoint. They don't speak with authority for one.They seem to always speculating and trying to make the Bible fit into their world view (which is usually liberal/antiChrist) They don't seem to have the experience. They may have some book knowledge but they don't appear to have had an experience with the Living God and apart from the Holy Spirit being active in our studies, how can any of us truly grasp what the meaning of the scriptures? <br>  <br>  Didn't God say, "As the heavens are higher than the earth, so are my ways higher than your ways and my thoughts than your thoughts." (Isa. 55:9) <br>  That's why the Holy Spirit was sent to guide us and teach us and reveal to us what the Bible says. He makes it alive. He draws out the correct meaning. (John 16:13) He gives us His thoughts which open up our understanding.<br>  <br>  God allows the world to come into the "outer courts". (Rev. 11:1-2)They can talk about Him and Christianity and tell us some of the historical events and debate theology & whatnot but until they come to Christ and become part of the sanctuary, the inner courts, they cannot see. God is the Light and when we are 'in Christ' we see. Those who are not 'in Christ', even if they have degrees in theology, are still in the darkness and do not see.|`|ffb16e0ffc6a4152dbf3d94c25cd5995aa	No.|`|AA11232725	Hardly, unless it's Larry King and he has John MacArthur on.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.youtube.com/results?search_type=&search_query=john+macarthur+larry+king&aq=0&oq=john+macarthur" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/results?search_ty...</a><br>  <br>  Check out the very first video to see what I mean.|`|Op81lhjuaa	I agree with Martin S.

Surely it can only be because they are so afraid that atheist are right and they are wrong or it would not bother them!!!!!!<br>  <br>  As soon as Christians rediscover the loving god and start acting like it the problem will cease!!!!|`|X1jupF0paa	Freedom of religion means just that, you are free to believe whatever you want.

But I can almost always understand where another person is coming from.|`|Rt4bJfVAaa	I believe that we are not living in normal time any more but the end time.  I saw a question the other day that was answered by Lets ABIDE in Him quite well about what the wedding garments when you get to heaven.  The righteousness of Jesus Christ.   <br>  <br>  <a href="http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;_ylt=Ak.kSJ5eROaCLrF9sbtAGfDty6IX;_ylv=3?qid=20090221211814AAz6YxV&show=7#profile-info-HBp5r76haa">http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;...</a><br>  <br>  What intrigued me about this question is the verses talked about a King inviting people to come to the wedding but they refused.  So the King compelled others to come yet these too had to wear the wedding clothes.<br>  <br>  I'm tying the thought of that question to this one because in the end someone has faith and some one does not.  And that has an eternal consequence.  This is not a small matter or else Jesus Christ would not have sent his son to die for the unbeliever as well as believers.<br>  <br>  So while it is nice to be disagreeing on faith and be friendly about it.  In the end days there will come one man who calls himself god and will not worship the god of his forefathers.  And he will not be so tolerant about what one believes or not but instead kill them.  It will matter quite a bit what one believes.  But this is equally true about God as well only this will be of eternal consequence.<br>  <br>  Perhaps in this day in age maybe since Christians especially are being so renounced by the evil one.  What difference does it make if we are nicey nicey or not?  Jesus Christ was not so nicey nicey to his religious enemies.   Jesus Christ was not nicey nicey to the devil. <br>  <br>  In the end we need to realize we are in a spiritual war for the souls of man for God's kingdom.  If the act of Adam and Eve in the garden was so important for man.  How much more in the end time for bellievers who know the truth and do nothing with it.  We can be as polite all we want to and not be an enemy of the devil.  Or we can speak truth and not worry about offence.  Knowing that the time is short.  Jesus Christ is coming.  The Messiah of Israel comes soon.  And before that one who will call himself a god even sooner.<br>  <br>  I don't know why I said all this.  Take it for what it's worth and pray.|`|KlXUrxBfaa	North, South, East, and West, Up, Down, Left, Right, Male, Female, Children,  all around, Yes it is called being humble, but, what tops the list is the Father and Son !|`|E870WbAsaa	I do not disagree, but i try to find similarities amongst the religions as the main source is "The God" "The Most merciful"    :)|`|U7sBZKUuaa	I typically do understand the POV of others, but too many people mistake that for agreement.|`|CBUPymktaa	sometimes .. others i sense theyre trying to manipulate me and have to cut them off ..|`|paRGbr7Xaa	If the person is being genuine and sincere, yes, I do try to understand where they're coming from.

ejbSFv0caa	As your child grows she will ask you many questions.  Some you can answer but will know that only experience or maturity will let her understand your answer.<br>  <br>  eg  A hot iron.  Your child goes close  -what do you do or say?<br>  <br>  Whilst your child is a baby - you most likely yell 'NO!'  she freezes and you rescue her.<br>  <br>  A little older say 4 or 5 you shout "NO!" - and add "its HOT!"<br>  <br>  6 or 7 you say you will burn yourself<br>  <br>  8 and above "The irons ON!"  or  "Careful - The iron!"<br>  <br>  at 20 you would hope she has the sense to see the iron is potentialy hot and be careful anyway<br>  <br>  Are you any less a father in answering so differently - in not letting her gain the experience of a burn?<br>  <br>  at each age you can assume some more cognitive power  and experience.<br>  <br>  The best warning of all is one that is made that is reinforced by experience.  Once a child has felt the pain of that iron it will forever be seen as a point of danger!<br>  <br>  God allows us to experience a lot.  That is not the same as directing that experience to land on us - though He might on occasion do that too.<br>  <br>  Our comprehension of God is limited by our ability to know Him now.  I believe that ability will grow massively as we mature in our relationship with Him.<br>  <br>  The 'errors' you mention are not symptoms of god's imperfection - they are symptoms of entropy ... the result of the fall of Man after the events in the Garden of Eden.  Before that time things were very different.  God allowed us the freedom to choose too.  He shouts to warn us through His word.|`|RoqxGbgRaa	GOD is perfect, but humanity is not.<br>  <br>  in your questioning, you are forgetting that humanity is a fallen creation.  along with sin, death, disease, and all manner of corruption entered into the human condition and the earth realm.<br>  <br>  this is why Jesus said that the well have no need of a doctor, but the sick do.  this is why "He was bruised for our iniquities and wounded for our transgressions.  the chastisement of our peace was upon him and by His stripes, we were healed."<br>  <br>  healing is always possible to the extent that faith exists.  Jesus never healed without the precondition of faith, and without a request from the person seeking healing.<br>  <br>  anyway, back to your point, the common defects of the human body are not a reflection of GOD's imperfection, but rather of humanity's fallen-ness.|`|c7pbvYmpaa	Zeus is perfect|`|f7fcb6877caa0ad4f41dd9af2258ee0aaa	So ... you believe that God individually creates each person from nothing, without any biology being involved??

After all He created everything and everybody and knows how it works and what is best for us. Take a look around and ask yourself, are we doing what God the creator of all things is telling us to do?

IwXuWX05aa	Of course they do.  The man at the gate to heaven lets you in with your dog; the man at the other gate tells you that no dogs are allowed.|`|bf2a3cdfd3a1c0386023cef0e5cd4b0faa	Yes... I believe all animals have souls and all animals go to Heaven.|`|zKOZ8Gafaa	Although nothing in the Bible says this, I do believe dogs go to heaven.|`|AA12193600	they do--and in death they wait for us at the rainbow bridge|`|AA10407603	They are living souls...i believe you are a little confused with the definition of soul...read on<br>  <br>  Genesis 1:24 (Darby Translation)<br>  <br>   24 And God said, Let the earth bring forth living souls after their kind, cattle, and creeping thing, and beast of the earth, after their kind. And it was so. <br>  <br>  Genesis 1:30 (Darby Translation)<br>  <br>   30 and to every animal of the earth, and to every fowl of the heavens, and to everything that creepeth on the earth, in which is a living soul, every green herb for food.<br>  <br>  The understanding that the word “soul” can mean the whole person is supported by the Bible. For example, the Bible speaks of a soul’s doing work. (Leviticus 23:30) The soul is spoken of as being impatient, irritated, sleepless, fearful, and depressed. (Judges 16:16; Job 19:2; Psalm 119:28; Acts 2:43; 1 Thessalonians 5:14) Referring to a soul as a person, Romans 13:1 states: “Let every soul be in subjection to the superior authorities.” And at 1 Peter 3:20, we read: “In Noah’s days, . . . a few people, that is, eight souls, were carried safely through the water.” Nothing in these scriptures indicates that the soul is some immaterial entity that lives on after death.<br>  <br>  What about animals and plants? Are they souls? Consider how the Bible describes the creation of animals. “Let the waters swarm forth a swarm of living souls,” God commanded. On the next creative day, God said: “Let the earth put forth living souls according to their kinds, domestic animal and moving animal and wild beast of the earth according to its kind.” (Genesis 1:20, 24) Therefore, all living creatures—human or animal—are souls. Scripturally, plants are not referred to as souls.<br>  <br>  Clearly, the Bible shows what man is. He does not have a soul; he is a soul. The same is true with dogs.<br>  <br>  What Is the Spirit?<br>  <br>  In the Bible, the words translated "spirit" basically mean "breath." But this implies much more than the act of breathing. The Bible writer James, for example, states: "The body without spirit is dead." (James 2:26) Hence, spirit is that which animates the body.<br>  <br>  This animating force cannot simply be the breath, or air, moving through the lungs. Why not? Because after breathing stops, life remains in the body cells for a brief period—"for several minutes," according to The World Book Encyclopedia. For this reason, efforts at resuscitation can succeed. But once the spark of life is extinguished from the cells of the body, any efforts to restore life are futile. All the breath, or air, in the world cannot revive even one cell. The spirit, then, is the invisible life-force—the spark of life that keeps the cells and the person alive. This life-force is sustained by breathing.—Job 34:14, 15.<br>  <br>  Is that spirit active only in humans? The Bible helps us to reach a sound conclusion in this matter. Wise King Solomon acknowledged that humans and animals "all have but one spirit," and he asked: "Who is there knowing the spirit of the sons of mankind, whether it is ascending upward; and the spirit of the beast, whether it is descending downward to the earth?" (Ecclesiastes 3:19-21) So animals as well as men are spoken of as having a spirit. How can that be?<br>  <br>  The spirit, or life-force, can be compared to the electric current that flows through a machine or an appliance. The invisible electricity may perform various functions, depending on the type of equipment it powers. For example, an electric stove can be made to generate heat, a computer to process information, and a television set to produce images and sound. Yet, the electric current never takes on the features of the equipment it activates. It remains simply a force. Similarly, the life-force does not take on any of the characteristics of the creatures it animates. It has no personality and no thinking ability. Humans and animals "have but one spirit." (Ecclesiastes 3:19) When a person dies, therefore, his spirit does not go on existing in another realm as a spirit creature.<br>  <br>  What, then, is the condition of the dead? And what happens to the spirit when a person dies?<br>  <br>    <br>  Man created from dust<br>  "Dust you are and to dust you will return"<br>      <br>  "To Dust You Will Return"<br>  <br>  When the first man, Adam, deliberately disobeyed God's command, He said to him: "In the sweat of your face you will eat bread until you return to the ground, for out of it you were taken. For dust you are and to dust you will return." (Genesis 3:19) Where was Adam before Jehovah created him from the dust? Why, he was nowhere! He simply did not exist. So when Jehovah God said that Adam would "return to the ground," he meant that Adam would die and return to the elements in the ground. Adam would not cross over to the spirit realm. At death Adam would once again be nonexistent. His punishment was death—absence of life—not a transfer to another realm.—Romans 6:23.<br>  <br>  What about others who have died? The condition of the dead is made clear at Ecclesiastes 9:5, 10, where we read: "The dead know nothing . . . There is no pursuit, no plan, no knowledge or intelligence, within the grave." (Moffatt) Death, therefore, is a state of nonexistence. The psalmist wrote that when a person dies, "his spirit goes out, he goes back to his ground; in that day his thoughts do perish."—Psalm 146:4.<br>  <br>  Clearly, the dead do not exist. They cannot know anything. They cannot see you, hear you, or talk to you. They can neither help you nor harm you. You certainly need not fear the dead. But how is it that the spirit "goes out" from a person at the time of his death?<br>  <br>    <br>  <br>      <br>  The Spirit "Returns to the True God"<br>  <br>  The Bible states that when a person dies, "the spirit itself returns to the true God who gave it." (Ecclesiastes 12:7) Does this mean that a spirit entity literally travels through space into God's presence? Not at all! The way in which the Bible uses the word "returns" does not require an actual movement from one place to another. For instance, unfaithful Israelites were told: "'Return to me, and I will return to you,' Jehovah of armies has said." (Malachi 3:7) Israel's 'returning' to Jehovah meant a turning around from a wrong course and again conforming to God's righteous way. And Jehovah's 'returning' to Israel meant his turning favorable attention to his people once again. In both cases the "return" involved an attitude, not a literal displacement from one geographic location to another.<br>  <br>  Similarly, at death no actual movement from the earth to the heavenly realm occurs when the spirit "returns" to God. Once the life-force is gone from a person, only God has the ability to restore it to him. So the spirit "returns to the true God" in the sense that any hope of future life for that person now rests entirely with God.<br>  <br>  Consider, for example, what the Scriptures say about Jesus Christ's death. The Gospel writer Luke relates: "Jesus called with a loud voice and said: 'Father, into your hands I entrust my spirit.' When he had said this, he expired." (Luke 23:46) As Jesus' spirit went out of him, he was not literally on his way to heaven. Jesus was not resurrected from the dead until the third day, and it was 40 days later that he ascended to heaven. (Acts 1:3, 9) At the time of his death, however, Jesus confidently left his spirit in his Father's hands, fully trusting in Jehovah's ability to bring him back to life.<br>  <br>  Yes, God can bring a person back to life. (Psalm 104:30) What a grand prospect this opens up!|`|PS3NKPOEaa	No, because in the bible God breathed into us His Spirit. The Soul is different. The Soul is the mind, wills, and emotions. I do believe animals have that. The Spirit though is what goes to heaven. And that they do not posses. Dogs do not have the ability to accept Jesus Christ as their Lord and Savior. Their mental capacity is not that great as well as that is a task for the spirit.<br>  <br>  So yes Dogs posses souls. But the Spirit is what goes to heaven.<br>  <br>  Hope I helped.<br>  God Bless|`|91XGHfSaaa	Of course they're loyal and loving - they're a pack animal. That's how they've evolved.|`|5T2rZmcYaa	Humans are such hateful and treacherous creatures. They must not have souls.|`|209E8kyVaa	yes|`|bEeozqacaa	Souls are not real.|`|f7fcb6877caa0ad4f41dd9af2258ee0aaa	You might think so, but that is just forcing human characteristics onto animals.  Animals are part of the natural environment, just like trees and water and air.  And there is no reason to think that taking one of them out of its natural environment and domesticating it confers eternal life upon it.  Or are packs of vicious wild dogs going to heaven too?  When an animal dies, it simply ceases to exist.
YUAegpPoaa	I don't remember either Adam or Eve as narratives.<br>  <br>  No. I do not wonder or want to hear what could only be either apologies or excuses since, even if you choose not to believe the Bible, it would be just plain silly for their narrative to be anything but.<br>  <br>  I wonder lots of things but I do not think the historical role of women was a creation of the Bible via the end of the Roman Empire. The Old Testament predates Constantine by more than a few years. <br>  <br>  I do think the Bible has been used as an excuse to try and maintain a status quo as well as having been just flat out misused to justify all sorts of things.|`|8Ddi57v2aa	You need to go buy the Lost Books of the Bible and Eve does have her story in there.|`|NWnOTkwCaa	The Fall was the result of Adam's sin, not Eve's. The Bible makes that clear time and time again. You might try actually reading it before presuming to be an expert on it.|`|gKwKxJyNaa	Well actually this is what I think....Adam was given commands to protect his wife and to not let any harm come to her...where was Adam when the surpent was manipulating Eve? He wasn't around protecting his wife...so I honestly believe Adam has as much blame as Eve does. But putting that aside, I can just see actually that Eve was up against evil and she didn't know what Evil was, so how was she supposed to know the surpent was tricking her?|`|IbyxsgHhaa	Eve never made Adam eat the apple..  Adam was tempted by the devil to do so, not by Eve. In Islam, God clarifies this...<br>  <br>  and some idiots say in this religion, females are seen in a negative light.. so much for that misconception..|`|yCdcF3Jcaa	Did Adam?|`|FsX5VoXKaa	The Bible never calls it the sin of Eve, but the fall of Adam...  Never take human arguments and God's word and mash them together without testing it against the Bible..<br>  <br>  <br>  First of all, Eve had not yet been created when God told Adam not to eat from that tree of Knowledge of Good and Evil.. It was Adam's responsibility..<br>  <br>  And when the devil was lying to Eve, Adam was not off picking berries somewhere... He was standing right there with her..  Adam kept silent when the devil was lying to Eve.. He should have said something!  <br>  <br>  Thats why all guys should never keep silent when the situation calls for it..  Especially when she says :" do i look good in this?"   <br>  <br>  JUST SAY SOMETHNG!!   there will be peace in the house if you do..  <br>  <br>  amen?|`|AA11503457	I believe Genesis was part of the dead sea scrolls, so you can't pin that one on constantine.  And Eve did tell her side of the story.<br>  <br>  EDIT: Yes they were found in the 20th century, but they were hidden in the 1st, befoer Constantine was even born.|`|GHH1i6d3aa	As they say in Hedwig and the Angry Inch - Eve just wanted to know stuff.  Eve represents the curiosity in all of us.  The curiosity that may bring us turmoil, but also brings us the truth.  I wouldn't give up that thirst for knowledge for some fancy garden either.|`|db7df25ea31227e5641d5c32d43c3bcdaa	not true nothing you said ever happened|`|QoOx93PPaa	It's pretty straight up. She got a fruit and they got kicked out.|`|2KRiVfKAaa	pfff.. The b**ch convinced Adam to eat the apple. She doesn't get to say squat!<br>  <br>  :D
lYoIO2JVaa	i can understand the bi curious, it happend to me with my best friend, all of a sudden last year there was a new connection, now im as straight as they get so i was never gunna do anything( even though i did want to kiss her at some stages, but never did or would), she sed she was straight but the stuff she sed to me and she would always hold my hand and stuff, as freinds.<br>  i think maybe its just your curiosity, and wanting to explore as you grow up. you probably dont want to do anything with her, think about it, would you want to? <br>  i guess get to know her, grab a group of friends and invite her somewhere, or if u go to a party invite her, who knows you's could end up being friends.<br>  <br>  <br>  p.s i have a lesbian friend, and we've had plenty of sleepovers, ive been curious but not enough to do anything, so its probs just that phase your going through.<br>  <br>  anyways that girl isnt my friend much anymore the one i had a connection with, she has new freidns and weve faded this year, i miss her heaps, and theres still the connection, but ive given up on her, she sometimes ignors me and then is real nice, we were sooooo close, it was like we were friend soulmates. ah well.

There's no standard for what an atheist might believe (for them), no handy book to consult. Brilliant question BTW.|`|pFs71HsHaa	Why do atheists say Christians believe in "sky fairies" in an insulting way?|`|f522078ffdf8786fcab6f8023c6befbdaa	They do so because in Christianity, belief and faith are themselves held as values - something to be desired, but more so than that, something intrinsic to human existence.<br>  <br>  Most atheists favor empiricism, which reject belief and faith for logic and reason.<br>  <br>  So for a Christian to assert that atheists still have belief is the Christian's way of validating their religion while attempting to claim to undermine the atheist's, by asserting that the atheist's world view is not just false, but self-deception.  If the atheist's claim that they reject belief and faith for logic and reason is true, then a critical underpinning of Christianity is false.|`|Hwe4MA6Faa	The universe doesn't and couldn't have an inside or outside, time and space are eternal and infinite in this universe as we know it, but there had to be a starting point, things dont just exist.  <br>  You're looking at it from a creationist POV yet reject theism and accept the nothing that was created for existence.|`|hYzfzu9yaa	Possibly because, in their minds, "nothing" is a bad thing. The trick is getting them to realize that "nothing" isn't nothing at all. We can fill our lives with so many other things, that the need for some kind of supernatural belief is not needed.|`|NWnOTkwCaa	The "nothingness" that atheists believe in is not the white space on the page or the canvas. It's nihilism, as in Sartre's "Being and Nothingness."|`|RGe6Et0Xaa	Atheists believe in all kinds of things. When Christians say that atheists believe in "nothing," they are speaking exclusively in reference to divine beings. And while "nothing" (in an abstract sense) is a valuable concept in Taoism, it is certainly a different kind of nothing. Christian accusation = no divine being. Taoism = nothingness, the state of non-being. Two different things.<br>  <br>  Incidentally, I have never met a Christian who did not believe in the concept of "nothing."|`|4db07412ef2c09f8393cb86bf7e153deaa	It's because the only thing they understand is their own religion, so they assume every other position must follow the same sort of structure with only the names changing.<br>  <br>  This is why they start off with the assumption that "everybody believes in something" or "everybody worships something".  This is why they also assume that atheists treat science as absolute dogma and treat scientists as infallible prophets, even though we don't.|`|5mCAscCnaa	Nothing is absence at the end. Maybe the thought of absence is weird to others. This is more a philosophical question if you ask me.|`|OdnkZt5daa	It's an ignorant statement to say that atheists believe in nothing.<br>  They believe that there is not an afterlife.<br>  Last time I checked, that isn't "nothing".|`|Gc49JgoQaa	They are so confused. They think atheism is like nihilism or something.|`|XqpRYh52aa	Because many of them are misguided|`|AA11314600	Because they can't attack us with logic and/or reason, so they result to petty name-calling.  Its quite childish|`|AA12341690	They're wrong. We do have beliefs, they just don't include any god.|`|aZ2cTa0Uaa	Nothing is also a negative.  <br>  <br>  Furthermore, stating that you believe in nothing IS  a bad thing to anybody who believes in "something".  They feel sorry that you haven't experienced what they have that has led them to their set of religious beliefs.<br>  <br>  CHRISTians and any theist would say this negatively because they believe you're missing a vital part of human life.  Doctors and scientists might also say this negatively, as it's been recently proven that religious practices increase longevity - and that believing an alternative theory should be considered as "something", even if there isn't a sentient being at the end of the chain.|`|fHA6zk07aa	I like your Tao verse.Even if as you suggest of many Christians,in name but i think not in spirit,for i have listened to some and this is not the way of the spirit,in many cases. However Nothing is that which allows something to be as in your verse.<br>  This is my personal definition of God,the Nothing that is Something we don't comprehend which allows space and form to exist in the Universe.Anyways i am a Christian but not the kind that intentionally judges anyone. keep well----Umie|`|R1WapAO6aa	I don't know anything about Xtians, but i can say that a lot of religious people see god as "everything" therefore if someone doesn't believe in god they think that atheists don't believe in anything.

As such, i wouldn't try and insult them (or you) because i dont believe that is what Jesus would want. Nor is it my soul purpose to brainwash others into believing what i do. But when you think of "nothing" in the way that Plato did...TO ME it seems like there is not a lot of substance there. I also think that Atheists sit the fence because they're looking for something else besides nothing  (i see your reading Dao De Jing which has Buddhist influence) but that's just my opinion :)<br>  <br>  if nothing else, im glad atheists (at least the ones i know) usually preach and practice the golden rule which is something that cant always be said for lots of people, religious or not :)|`|tRfJUjJaaa	This nothing you speak of..it called volume...it can measured,diluted,and holds many elements not seen by the human eye or sound<br>  .........is it nothing.or is there something......everything works off certain fundamentals principles weather we can see,hear,taste,or touch it..

7qe7EUahaa	Very challenging question! I want to agree with Harriet. I also want to say that your thinking is much like mine in the sense that we have taken circumstances from 1430 years ago and made them applicable today in Islamic and some Christian thinking whether in the Quran, the Bible or the hadiths or anywhere else. To me, I can't make it sensible. This is why I am challenged by some of the Hadiths and I fight to learn to accept them on a daily basis. (My own personal struggle) <br>  <br>  Here is a true example: in summer 2006, in the Emirates (I was living there at the time) there was a Sri Lankian maid accused of having a premarital relationship with her fiancee. The courts sentences her to be "stoned to death" !!! (but not him). I had only been in the Middle East 4 months or so and I was appalled. The judge overturned the sentence of Sharia Law and gave them both 1000 lashes and 3 years in prison and immediate deportation after they completed their prison time.(Geezzz, fair enough already...1000 lashes and 3 years in prison)<br>  <br>  FOR HEAVENS SAKE!!!!!!<br>  I was relieved that they didn't "stone her to death" and I think Allah alone shall be the judge of each of us.<br>  <br>  Clearly there are heinous crimes, such as murder or something cruel that I do feel deserve man to give appropriate judgment and sentences on, (even prostitution should be harshly dealt with) but for anything that relates to the genuine emotion of love and affection....I say let Allah decide.<br>  <br>  As for your question, I have known sensible Muslims that will acknowledge that being gay "can be innate and biological" and not a chosen state. They DO HOWEVER INSIST that it is haram and that a man or woman must fight agaist it and NEVER give in or act on that desire. This, I believe is correct thinking.<br>  <br>  I am American and therefore gays were everywhere in my life and until my conversion, I was accepting of that lifestyle for those that chose it, and to be honest I was a product of my environment and thought there was nothing wrong with it. I have changed my position and now I accept it as their choice, but do think it is agaist the will and desire of Allah and one must refrain from being with same-gender intimately.<br>  <br>  I don't think however, we on earth are here to "sentence and kill" a homosexual. Let them face Allah on Judgement Day, he will be the final judge for each one of us anyway in the hereafter. <br>  <br>  For example: It has been proven that many innocent men have been put in prison and sentenced to death for crimes they did not commit. (Years later DNA proved them innocent) and they were set free. IF they had of been killed, on Judgement Day, Allah will know their innocence and their death penalty. Perhaps they deserve Paradise and were wrongly executed.<br>  <br>  If anyone is put to death for any reason of religious or man-made laws, yet...they will face Allah and read their book and Allah will decide where that person will spend eternity. Who are we to try and be Allah and decide such a fate as DEATH to something like romantic affairs or homosexuality???? I think we are wrong to think that we have the right to "kill" another human being.|`|xuZ2y3ADaa	hadiths???? u noe what i mean cool wallahee im sayin|`|Pbj8Ymgxaa	Shariah is not found in the Quran? Are you sure you were reading the Quran?<br>  <br>  One problem I see with Christianity is that it only shows the "nice" side, I never hear of any punishments, just that God is all loving, even of the ones that break his law. Don't get me wrong, God is forgiving, but how come in Christianity you never hear of the severe in punishment part? The tortures of the afterlife, of the grave and so on.<br>  <br>  To answer your question, sodomites should be killed because they bring a curse upon society. The laws of Shariah benefit humanity as a whole, not just the elite. That is why theives get a hand cut off, fornicaters get whipped, ones who cause mischief in the earth get killed. There are punishments in this life, the grave, and in the afterlife. No I do not have sad feelings whn I hear of a practicing homosexual killed, or adulterers stoned to death, or corrupt people get killed. Why should I? They are bad for society, and they knew they were breaking the laws and they brought the punishment onto themselves, so I don't feel sorry for them.<br>  <br>  Why do humans have the right to kill other persons? Well, if your wife was murdered, wouldn't you want her murderer killed for his crime? Or would you be passive and say his punishment is in the afterlife blaj blah. In Islam the victims family has the choice to have the man killed, make him pay blood money, or forgive him. There are and should be punishments in this life, I don't see what is so bad about that.|`|pzLDXL6gaa	I think it should be left up to Allah to judge and people shouldn't make their own interpretations about who they're allowed to kill for punishment. But I'm not religious so that's probably why I have a more sensible view.<br>  <br>  Harriet|`|qPSkkPqwaa	After the Quran's law comes the Hadith Law (the sayings of our last Prophet Muhammad )<br>  <br>  Buddy Christianity is messed up. if u go in their concept it is even if u kill or steal u will got to heaven thats stupid.<br>  <br>  1400 years ago the laws were different so its baseless to say that why this is so cruel. Did u live back in 1400 with no toilet or computer? or no "Usa Law or Canada law"?|`|gh9b4GLjaa	.. no specific answer from kuran....   but interpret it from the light of hadiths....   they will find one justify enuf to kill them anyway....<br>  <br>  any diffrence in the apostasy in islam..??|`|89a4e35709fd20d8fa340ef1d5a3bac3aa	Salam for you. You are not quite right. In the Qur'an,Allah has given warnings for homosexuals in the story of Luth prophet. In surah 7 Al Araaf verse 80 and 83 Luth prohibited his tribe (Sodom) to do faahisyah (homosexual) because it is included in cruelty acts. In surah 27 An Naml verse 54 and 56 Allah spoke that homosexual is the relationship between a man with a man.In surah 29 Al Ankabut verse 28 and 29 Allah spoke that homosexuality was not done by humans before Luth's tribe..In surah 26 Asy Syuara verse 160 and 168 .The homosexualists forgetted rasool and they wanted to oust rasool(Luth).In surah 11 Hud verse 77 and 81 Luth received angel who emerged just a handsome man..In surah 15 Al Hijr verse 61 and 66 the angel (jibril) said that he submitted revelation to  Luth from Allah that homosexualists (including lesbianists) will be killed before fajr .In surah 16 An Nahl verse 67 Luth tribe homosexualsists came to him and they asked him to surrender the handsome man. In surah 54 Al Qamar verse 37 and 39 Allah spoke that all homosexualists were killed and in verse 33 and 35 Allah spoke also that they were killed by stone rain with  the wind and the soil had been upside downed.<br>  By those verses it is clear that Allah hates homosexuals and they deserved death penalty.Islamic countries or arab countries make a death penalty based on those verses.|`|ORbFRn4oaa	Although Umm Hakim has put the first part of her answer quiet well. I do have differences with her.<br>  <br>  @Asker,<br>  You are right and wrong at the same time.<br>  <br>  You are right in that the Quran does NOT specify death penalty to Gays / sodomites. You are wrong that the Quran does NOT say anything about them.<br>  <br>  The verses regarding Gays and Lesbians are 4:15 and 16.<br>  <br>  The verse 4:15 talks about Lesbians. While the 4:16 talks about Sodomy. The Quran states that they are to be punished "Till" they reform. <br>  <br>  This means that they are NOT to be killed. Because there is NO reform after death.<br>  <br>  ----<br>  However the Sharia which is practiced in the name of God, is Not based on God's revelations but based on man made fabrications in the name of much revered scholars (the blood thirsty, IDIOT scholars). These scholars are more dear to Muslims (Organized Islam) than God.<br>  <br>  Consequently, the situation is like what you already know.<br>  <br>  @Edit<br>  BTW, I have no sympathies for Gays. But I have to follow what the Quran says, rather than my own sentiments. And I too believe that death penalty is a very harsh punishment which should be reserved ONLY for very very serious crimes.|`|UhyvM73iaa	Yes Allah tells us in story of the people of Prophet Lat and tells us how He sent His Angeles to destroy all people of that city for <br>  practicing homosexuality openly.  Read the following Ayahs of Surah <br>  Ankaboot 29. Ayahs 28 to 35<br>  <br>   28 And (remember) Lut: behold, he said to his people: "Ye do commit lewdness, such as no people in Creation (ever) committed before you.  <br>   29 "Do ye indeed approach men, and cut off the highway?- and practise wickedness (even) in your councils?" But his people gave no answer but this: they said: "Bring us the Wrath of Allah if thou tellest the truth."   <br>   30 He said: "O my Lord! help Thou me against people who do mischief!"   <br>   31 When Our Messengers came to Abraham with the good news, they said: "We are indeed going to destroy the people of this township: for truly they are (addicted to) crime."   <br>   32 He said: "But there is Lut there." They said: "Well do we know who is there : we will certainly save him and his following,- except his wife: she is of those who lag behind!"   <br>   33 And when Our Messengers came to Lut, he was grieved on their account, and felt himself powerless (to protect) them: but they said: "Fear thou not, nor grieve: we are (here) to save thee and thy following, except thy wife: she is of those who lag behind.   <br>   34 "For we are going to bring down on the people of this township a Punishment from heaven, because they have been wickedly rebellious."   <br>   35 And We have left thereof an evident Sign, for any people who (care to) understand.  <br>  <br>  A-Zamar:54- 33-39<br>  <br>  33 The people of Lut rejected (his) warning.   <br>   34 We sent against them a violent Tornado with showers of stones, (which destroyed them), except Lut's household: them We delivered by early Dawn,-   <br>   35 As a Grace from Us: thus do We reward those who give thanks.   <br>   36 And (Lut) did warn them of Our Punishment, but they disputed about the Warning.   <br>   37 And they even sought to snatch away his guests from him, but We blinded their eyes. (They heard:) "Now taste ye My Wrath and My Warning."   <br>   38 Early on the morrow an abiding Punishment seized them:   <br>   39 "So taste ye My Wrath and My Warning."  <br>  <br>  (5) We also (sent) Lut: He said to his people: "Do ye commit lewdness such as no people in creation (ever) committed before you?  <br>  (  ???? ???????  , Al-Araf, Chapter #7, Verse #80)<br>  <br>  The story of the homosexuals of the city where Allah sent Prophet Lut for their guidance tells us how Allah had them all destroyed by the hale of stocks and earth quake.  This is why in Islamic Shariah the punishment of death is for homosexuals.

ZDDya5Ibaa	Very interesting question. Heaven would be cool I guess. I think its a lovely idea, that I could be with all of my loved ones after I die. and plus, there is supposedly a God who is all loving and what not. Thats a nice idea, sure. <br>  <br>  But I also see a lot of beauty and peace in death the way it actually is. We have the ability to live a wonderful life right now, do whatever we wish, and then its all over, and we just have eternal peace. I think thats very soothing.<br>  <br>  When it comes down to it, if I could alter reality, I would choose to simply have a bit more time here on earth. Like, if the life span of humans was 200 years instead of around 80. (and of course you aged much slower) That way I would have a ton of time to do all that I want to do, be all that I can be, and more. That would be my dream.

38f15601baa14cb41ff2021454524fbbaa	Lent is the six week period starting in Ash Wednesday and ending on Easter. It is traditionally a time when people choose to make a sacrifice of something they enjoy such as chocolate or television in order to discipline their minds and bodies. On Ash Wednesday, the priest draws a cross of ashes on our foreheads and reminds us that our bodies will one day return to dust.<br>  <br>  From the Catholic perspective, Lent is a time of fasting and abstaining from eating meat on certain days. Ash Wednesday and Good Friday are days of abstaining from eating meat and fasting (only eating one full meal and two smaller ones that don't equal an entire meal.) Again, this is to honor Christ's sacrifice of His own life on the Cross and to help us bring our worldly desires under control. We perform acts of penance to show that we are sorry for our sins, and we also spend more time in prayer.<br>  <br>  The Bible doesn't specifically mention Lent, but Jesus does say "When you fast. . .", so fasting is expected of us. Lent is a good time to reflect on the areas of your life that are displeasing to God and concentrating on letting Him help you to overcome them.<br>  <br>  As a Catholic, I am very much involved with Lent. I attend Ash Wednesday services and the Holy Week (week before Good Friday) activities. I ask the Holy Spirit to show me what I need to work on (this year, it's my temper), and I "fine" myself a quarter each time I sin in that way. I save that penance money to contribute to Operation: Rice Bowl, a Catholic charity that helps the hungry in Third World countries.<br>  <br>  Lent is a very refreshing time of year for me because I feel as if I'm accomplishing another step in my goal to become more like Jesus. I hope this helps you understand a bit more about Lent, and if you have any more questions, post and I'll check back tomorrow.|`|OugNf0x6aa	I'm not Christian, but I do know about Lent:<br>  <br>  It begins around Ash Wednesday, and you give up something for about 40 days, like chocolate or coffee or any other thing you can think of. Mardi Gras is right before Lent so you can get your fill of what you want before you give it up.|`|cdc288ac537ecf1efe5ace9f795fe44aaa	Lent is a 6 week preparation period before Holy Week of Good Maundi Thursday , Good Friday Holy Saturday and Easter Sunday. During this 6 weeks There will be no Gloria and  fasting  on Ash Wednesday and<br>  abstaince of Meat or Fasting during the 5 weeks of Lent|`|AA11121937	yes i do<br>  ok this is the condensed version. It starts with ash Wednesday on the feb 25.  Ash wednesday i when the put ashes on our forehead to remind us that we are we going to die some day and that we should live a more godly life because when we die we will be judged.  we give up or start doing somthing for 40 days.  we also fast and do not eat meat on certain days because jusus sacrefice his life so we do this to honor his sacrifice. I used to whine about not being able to eat meat but now i do not because not eating meat is such a small sacrifice considering that he gave his life for us.<br>  why 40? <br>  the forty hours jesus was in the cave <br>  the forty days jesus spent in the cave <br>  we also use the forty days to prepare our self for easter because that is a very important day it is the Resurrection.<br>  examples.junk food = unhealthy for our body which is a gift from god.<br>              make up = vanity<br>  starting to take out the trash = prevent being a sloth<br>  ETC there are endless amount of thing a person can do to get closer to god.<br>  I know we should be doing thes things anyways but we don't so we use lent as a reminder that we should because people need reminders <br>  I know you think only forty days After that you can go back to normal but allot of the time you get used to it. I gave up soda last year and now i drink allot less soda, my friend started reading the bible every Morning and she still does the point is hopefully something good will stick.|`|HMteUyRdaa	Lent is the 40 day preparation period for Easter.<br>  <br>  Lent starts this coming Wednesday it is known as Ash Wednesday and is a fasting day in the Catholic Church.<br>  <br>  LOL Where in the Bible does it mention not to celebrate Lent, also does everything you do have to be in the Bible, or can you do something for your soul and for God with out the Bible telling you to do it? I mean I love it when my husband does things for me with out being asked to, all lent is a prayerful, fasting preparation for our redemption in Christ our Lord. What is wrong with that?<br>  <br>  Yes I celebrate Lent. It is a very important time in the Catholic Church.<br>  <br>  Love,<br>  Kate|`|eb4134143bcb36114275325ce8dffe26aa	Lent is a 40 day period of fasting and penance that preceeds Easter Sunday.  The dates are variable as it strictly depends on the calculations for Easter Sunday.  Lent starts on Ash Wednesday (this year, Feb. 25/09) and depending upon the source, it either ends on Holy Thursday or Holy Saturday (personally, I end my Lent at noon on Holy Saturday).<br>  <br>  The Bible doesn't mention Lent but it does mention the 40 days of fasting and prayer that Jesus spent in the desert.  But whether or not it is in the Bible, it doesn't preclude you from practising the tradition as it will help you grow closer to God (ie. cars aren't either in the Bible but I bet you ride them whenever possible).<br>  <br>  Yes, I "do" Lent; that is, I use this period of time for fasting, quiet reflection, prayer, and meditation.<br>  <br>  One last thing...it isn't only Roman Catholic churches that practise Lent.  It is also Orthodox churches, Anglicans (Episcopalians in the U.S.A.), etc.  Additionaly, there are a now number of PROTESTANT churches now who are beginning to practise Lent.

What matters is that God created the planet and "God saw how good it was." (Genesis 1:10)<br>  <br>  Most Christians do not take the stories of creation in the Bible literally. Catholics believe the book of Genesis tells religious truth and not necessarily historical fact. <br>  <br>  One of the religious truths is that God created everything and declared all was good.<br>  <br>  Catholics can believe in the theories of the big bang or evolution or both or neither. <br>  <br>  On August 12, 1950 Pope Pius XII said in his encyclical Humani generis: <br>  <br>  The Teaching Authority of the Church does not forbid that, in conformity with the present state of human sciences and sacred theology, research and discussions, on the part of men experienced in both fields, take place with regard to the doctrine of evolution, in as far as it inquires into the origin of the human body as coming from pre-existent and living matter - for the Catholic faith obliges us to hold that souls are immediately created by God. <br>  <br>  Here is the complete encyclical: <a href="http://www.vatican.va/holy_father/pius_xii/encyclicals/documents/hf_p-xii_enc_12081950_humani-generis_en.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.vatican.va/holy_father/pius_x...</a><br>  <br>  And here is the Address of Pope John Paul II to the Pontifical Academy of Sciences on October 22, 1996 speaking of the Theory of Evolution: <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/library/docs_jp02tc.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.newadvent.org/library/docs_jp...</a><br>  <br>  Here is an interesting article about Pope John Paul II's opinion in the matter: <a href="http://www.americamagazine.org/content/article.cfm?article_id=4627" rel="nofollow">http://www.americamagazine.org/content/a...</a><br>  <br>  The Church supports science in the discovery of God's creation.

Christianity is not a blind faith as many of you suppose.  Prophecy and the ressurection are the two largest evidences for our faith.  The bible promissed a 7 year period of trouble upon the earth prior to the return of Christ.  It describes the church as mostly hypocritical and the world as largely apostate but it also promised that Israel would be the center of it all.  It predicted Israel being scattered to the four corners of the earth and then in the last days being brought back into the land.  Jesus said He was rejected but another wuld come in his own name and him Israel would accept.  Jesus promised another temple and the abomination of desolation would occur in the days of the one world government.  We will have global governance by the time the financial crisis is over, Israel is back in the land and has remade all the implements for temple service; they are waiting for a man who will give them a peace treaty and allow them to rebuild the temple.. it is also noted that John in revelation was told to remeasure the temple grounds and that the outer court was not to be measured because it was given to the heathens, which is exactly where the dome of the rock is.  This is just a small sampling of very specific prophecy that testifies that the bible is the word of God.  Christianity has been comppromised and many have been turned off by hypocrites but no one can find hypocracy in Jesus.  Many atheist make up ther minds in college without really considereing Christs claims on there own merits.  He does,nt hate atheist ; he would reveal His love for you all at the very moment you trust in Him.  Read the gospel of John are these the claims of a  man or the Son of God.

Most people missed the fact that you never denied he existed, just that anyone as rich and powerful as he was claimed to be would have made an impact in neighboring areas.

IFQFt25naa	I have dealt with several members of  “Iglesia ni Cristo” where I am located (Philippines).  They have very … shall we say … “unique” views of what the bible teaches.<br>  <br>  But the fact he lied to you about being of the same faith, knowing full well that a member of the “Iglesia ni Cristo” is not to be in serious relationships with outsiders.  Means he really wasn’t interested in a serious relationship with you. Maybe converting you but not a serious relationship.<br>  <br>  Yes, I think he was a jerk, (regardless of religion or non religion) for being deceitful/dishonest with you and for just disappearing.<br>  <br>  “Iglesia ni Cristo” is one of those churches that is not overly fond of its members associating with non-members other than to convent the non-member.  For according to them the only ones that are going to heaven are the ones that are of the body of Christ belonging to the church He (Jesus) created.  Which according to them IS “Iglesia ni Cristo”.   That logic sort of confuses me on several levels and I have listened to their reasoning and ideas on different occasions.<br>  <br>  But biblical problems with their logic set aside (as well as many other issues).   For the church to have been set up by Jesus making it  “Christ’s original church” (as they claim) that that would mean it has to be a 2000-year-old church organization (approximately).   “Iglesia ni Cristo” (which means "Church of Christ" in the Philippine language Tagalog) was founded here in the Philippines in 1914. I might not be the best with math, but I think that is just a “tad” recent to have been founded by Jesus.  Well let me clarify that a little, it is a “tad” to recent to have been founded by The Jesus that IS Our Lord and Saviour.<br>  <br>  Sorry about the tantrum about the group and getting off topic.  <br>  <br>  As for your situation, as cold and as heartless as I may sound, since it is obvious you cared about the person.

A murderer who asks for forgiveness and does nothing to help the world will go to heaven. A person who might or might not believe in god can be the nicest and most giving person in the world and if they commit suicide they will burn in hell for all of eternity. It's just something that religious people accept even though in their gut they know it's wrong, they don't think about all these things.|`|OdnkZt5daa	According to Christians, yes.<br>  According to me, no.<br>  <br>  I've asked people a similar question:<br>  "If there is a person who has done all in his willpower to help those in need, and has lived a life of purity, who is gay, will they go to hell?"<br>  <br>  The answer is a big, fat, obvious NO. Yet, despite all this logic, people still have it stuck in their minds that if you're not Christian, then you go to hell.<br>  <br>  So why, oh WHY, is it that a rapist/murderer who happens to pray before his death sentence and go, "Oh, sorry" gets a free ticket to heaven?<br>  <br>  Compare and contrast: A man who is poured his heart and soul into the giving of others going to hell for being gay and "not believing", versus a disgusting, horrible killer who happens to throw in a sincere sorry going to heaven.<br>  <br>  It's absolutely ridiculous, beyond all reasoning ridiculous.<br>  It's disgraceful.|`|AA11824333	If he has never been saved.

What I said is from the bible, if you don't like the bible don't read what I said.|`|TbZeLX6laa	"Doing great things" doesn't save anyone. <br>  <br>  The truth about Jesus is that the only way to be saved and to get into heaven and avoid being sent to eternal hell, is by believing in faith alone that Jesus, who is God, died for our sins on the cross as FULL PAYMENT for all our sins, and then Jesus rose from the dead (1 Corinthians 15:1-4).

Pax Christi|`|J7KSKm54aa	That is funny|`|tBwdVpG4aa	It's a play on the word "celebate" which means unmarried and practicing abstinence from sex, like the RCC clergy do.  (According to the rules if not always in practice.)<br>  <br>  But it's a dumb joke, because no Catholic priest thinks the Bible is the source of the celebacy rule.

You know that Catholic Priests, Nuns, and of course, the Pope take a vow of celibacy, to be celibate ( not having sexual relations ever). This is their interpretation of a passage written by divine inspiration by the Apostle Paul in Romans 7.  BUT... the joke is that the Pope realizes that what he always thought meant he had to be celibate and never marry or consummate a relationship was really the word "celebrate".

And I tried to find out what the criteria was for getting  it.<br>  <br>  This is what Yahoo officially has to say:- (It's in their Help Section)<br>  <br>  What is a Top Contributor?<br>  <br>  A Top Contributor is a member of the Answers community who has shown that they are knowledgeable in a particular category. Each Answers user can be a top contributor in up to three categories.<br>  <br>  The top contributor badge is dynamic —you earn it or lose it depending on your recent participation in a particular category. The more actively you contribute, the more likely you will earn a badge. Just like featured users or category leaders, it's another way to feature community members who might otherwise be overlooked.<br>  <br>  <br>  Does being a Top Contributor factor into being a trusted reporter?<br>  <br>  No, being a Top Contributor does not make a community member a more trusted reporter. More important considerations are high-quality overall contributions, reporting history, and other factors.<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  I don't really like having it, as it feels like a bit of a responsibility to do good answers.|`|45b08ca1dc880690ca7764657e05b376aa	I was a top contributor in R.&S. as well as cats.

Km6QTk9Caa	I see what you are saying.  The thing is in the society we live in,  it is a pretty standard traditional thing to hold some kind of ceremony to say farewell to someone.  However not all funerals are religious.  Memorials can be held,  and they do not have to have anything to do with god.  No prayers,  no hymns,  nothing.   But I get it,  you are not even bothered about that.  And you know what,  that is your choice.<br>  <br>     If you are adamant about this then discuss everything with your family.    Make sure it is at a good time,  not when someone has just died.  <br>  <br>  It still probably will  not be received very well.   You say your family is not all that close,  but then you are still concerned about causing a rift.  I know how that is,  a bit like my family.   <br>  <br>  If and when a funeral came up.  I would put aside my belief.  A family members death would be hard enough as it is,  without me waving my anti funeral flag and holding a 'sit in'  to make my belief be known.  So even though I totally understand how frustrating it is to do things out of duty.   Maybe this is one of those things that is not worth causing waves about.<br>  <br>  However for your own death.  You can tell everyone your wishes.  You can make a written will to state what you would like.   I actually am wanting to do this myself.|`|CODYtcwkaa	There is nothing about being a die-hard atheist that says you can not particpate in a funeral ceremony.  Your atheism and feelings about funerals - while perhaps related for you - are truly mutually exclusive.<br>  <br>  If you make it clear you don't go to funerals, you can expect there won't be so many at yours.<br>  <br>  Have a  nice day.|`|py57svUyaa	I am not sure what that has to do with atheism. For me funerals are a place to remember the dead and to celebrate their life. If it is not my close relative then I think my presence can bring relieve to the family.  It is kind of a closure. <br>  <br>  I would be upset if I were your mom and your dad died and you did not show up just for this reason actually. <br>  <br>  I really do not get the atheist part. Cause I am and my entire family is atheist as well.|`|wM7pprr1aa	I'm generally honest.|`|Z92LPUqaaa	I just tell people the truth, I have never seen a dead person and prefer to keep it that way.|`|db7df25ea31227e5641d5c32d43c3bcdaa	tell them you do not want to go<br>  <br>  you do not believe in a after life|`|731e61cebec438f48fbf84f60ff2687aaa	Why not just donate your body to science?|`|hfDohxp5aa	I think there are many people in this world who for whatever reason do not choose to attend funerals and such. I think if you do not choose to do it, you should be honest. Choose your battles wisely tho.|`|E8pbdVPPaa	Wow...you must be an ultra orthodox atheist! Look, I have gone to many "religious" funerals for family and friends...christian, jewish, hindu!. You have to look past all of the religious mumbo jumbo and just reflect on the deceased person's life and how he or she lived it. My family is well aware that I am an atheist but it does not affect my relationship with them. I just believe is one less "god" than they do. Family and friends are the most important thing in the world.|`|RNhkxoOzaa	To be honest, it sounds selfish. While you have the right to your views, the fact that you can't swallow your opinions to spend time with your family shows a lack of sympathy for others. Funerals are for the living, not the dead. I would hope if your brother, cousin, or mother died you would have enough compassion to sit next to your sister, uncle, or father and at least show them your love for them ... if nothing else.<br>  <br>  Is a few hours being polite and civil a concept atheists don't believe in?<br>  <br>  Ath|`|Sc2udS5daa	Atheist or Theist, you go to RESPECT the person who died. How would you feel if your girlfriend/boyfriend, mother, father, etc, said that they won't show up at your funeral?<br>  <br>  Funerals are for respect and veneration. If you truly oppose the idea of attending a funeral, do you even value human life?|`|HzxSzY1paa	First of all if someone close to you dies you may change your mind about attending their funeral. Second of all going to a funeral is a sign of respect. The reason we have funerals is to honor the persons life and memory, and to give comfort and closure to everyone else.. by attending funerals we know that there will be other people to remember us when we die. While that might not mean much to you, most people like to be remembered after they die, rather than being simply tossed to the side without another thought.<br>  <br>  So basically it comes down to this, why not go to a funeral? If its a close family member then what are you doing otherwise that's so important that you cant pay your last respects with everyone else??|`|bEeozqacaa	Just tell them it goes against your beliefs.|`|2f6d591b87634e2c1909160eb45e94a1aa	You simply  tell the truth. Just say "  I am  sick and tired of doing things I don't believe in just because it's expected of me. I'm to self centered to worry about how the rest of you feel. I'm not going to put myself out for the rest of you. I don't want to carry my weight in this family, and besides, as a atheist, funerals scare me."|`|f522078ffdf8786fcab6f8023c6befbdaa	I don't attend funerals either and for the same reason.<br>  <br>  My family usually will ask, I usually politely decline, life goes on (well, not for the person whose funeral it is... but...).|`|903f8cb36b3e6a7b3d1a5dc322e02788aa	Go out of respect for those who are still living and grieving, who need your support and love now.  Funerals are for the living, so go for them.|`|yCdcF3Jcaa	It doesn't have to be religious.|`|bK5MJCxhaa	Well, on one hand there are your beliefs and on the other hand there are the feelings of grieving family members.  <br>  <br>  I would come down on the side of not creating drama for people who are already distressed.  Suck it up, and make an appearance.<br>  <br>  ADDED:  I just read your additional details, and basically, what you're saying is that you can't be arsed to go.  That's fine, but be aware, if you blow off funerals, you might find that your family may no longer include you in some of the more fun get togethers...or remember you in wills.

Your argument is flawed from the start.<br>  <br>  To go to Hell would mean that one did not love God. Hell is the emptiness that results from not having love for God. To serve God is to love God. To love God is to be loved by God. To be in a love relationship with God is the opposite of Hell.<br>  <br>  Incidentally this argument was resolved nearly 800 years ago by Thomas Aquinas, even though Ockham brought it up again years later. It's all part of the argument if God can make a rock so big he can't life it. (incidentally, no. God cannot diminish himself. If you want to claim that makes him imperfect go ahead, but you're wrong. A thing cannot be perfect by being less than what it is.)|`|wNtBzGGYaa	I don't really get what you mean. but if God asks you to do something and you do it then ya you are serving God. and No you wont go to hell you will go to heaven. and ya i would do anything for him.|`|RDxbbCHwaa	I serve God because He is worthy of my praise above all others.

As the story goes Joseph Smith prayed to God to find out what denomination was the true denomonation (rather than reading the Bible and making the Bible his denomination he looked to man for the answers and didn't respect God's word.). So an angel appeared to him, Moroni. The Bible says that an angel of light can deceive, and so Joseph Smith was deceived by the angel apparently from the story, but the story could be made up.<br>  I think Joseph Smiths parents were Methodists, and there were lots of arguments within families and friends about Methodists and Baptists.|`|gKHgJJIwaa	It is NOT an offshoot of Christianity.<br>  <br>  In his 'first vision', Joseph smith declared that all christian denominations were false.<br>  <br>  They deny ALL basic doctrines critical to the Christian Faith.<br>  <br>  They have added at least three bound books as revelations from God and they discount passages of the Bible that does not agree with them as incorrect translations from an unreliable text.|`|LuN1unJ3aa	They (The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints) are what is considered to be restorationist Christian denomination.

For the official views and teachings of the Church, I've also included a number of links to official web sites.|`|ZGej8V69aa	No Mormonism is not an offshoot of any Christian denomination.  Please note that no member of this church would ever refer to themselves as a Mormon. Mormon is a nick name created by non members of the church. It is the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. Referring to the people as LDS is okay.<br>  <br>  Joseph Smith the prophet of the LDS church was torn between what sect of Christianity to join during his day.  He says he received a revelation from an angel and god himself to join none of the churches as they were all wrong.<br>  <br>  The LDS Church therefore became a RESTORATION church and is not considered a  denomination of any of the churches in Christianity.<br>  <br>  Why? Because 'mainstream' Christianity church do not accept the LDS Church as being Christian.<br>  <br>  Why? Because many of the doctrinal beliefs are different.  But then many 'Christian' churches did not accept the Roman Catholic church as being Christian either.<br>  <br>  The LDS church believes that God Jesus and the Holy Spirit are three separate identities.  This is the main bone of connection with the other churches.<br>  <br>  There are many beliefs that are different as well.<br>  <br>  But in my humble opinion these differences should not expel them from the title of Christian for indeed they follow, or attempt to follow the teachings of our Saviour Jesus Christ.<br>  <br>  So that to me is the definition of Christian.<br>  <br>  Now beware that there is alot of false information in some of the answers you have read.<br>  <br>  For example, though I don't believe in the BOOK OF MORMON..... a poster says the at the end of the book of Revelation there is a warning not to add to the BIBLE  This is wrong.  Revelation was referring to the individual book of Revelation. The Bible wasn't compiled until well after the Book of Revelation was written.

Mormonism teaches men become one of these innumerable gods - Christianity has always taught that humans were finite, mortal creations of the One and only God.<br>  3. Mormonism teaches men can earn salvation and godhood through their efforts - Christianity has always taught men are sinners in need of a perfect savior, and by faith in Christ alone through grace alone are forgiven of their sins.<br>  <br>  I could go on for an innumerable amount of digits ... suffice it to say Mormonism has the veneer of Christianity in language and terms, and characters - but when you look at essential doctrines, it is much closer to paganism than any other type of religion.<br>  <br>  Ath|`|jAgPKvzWaa	The LDS aren't off-shoots of any Christian Church, but are the first church, if you count their belief that they are closest in practice to early Christianity, prior to the Catholic Church.

For example bible believing Christians believe there is only one God. Mormons believe in many gods ex. "Heavenly father god, his wive(s) heavenly mothers (female dieties), his first born son named jesus and the holy ghost who is another god all together. the goal of mormonism is to become a god. This is a radical departure form the Christian religion. Only God is God forever. Mormonism believes that you must do good works to get to heaven. Christianity believes salvation comes as a free gift- an act of grace by God. The converted believer makes Jesus his Lord and lives a life in comformity to the will of God. The mormon religion believes in a totally different god a different jesus and a different gospel which is no gospel at all. The bible warn against false christs and false gospels.

The atheist<br>  <br>  professor of philosophy pauses before his class and then asks one of<br>  <br>  his new students to stand.<br>  <br>   <br>  <br>  'You're a Christian, aren't you, son?'<br>  <br>   <br>  <br>  'Yes sir,' the student says.<br>  <br>   <br>  <br>  'So you believe in God?'<br>  <br>   <br>  <br>  'Absolutely.<br>  <br>   <br>  <br>  'Is God good?'<br>  <br>   <br>  <br>  'Sure! God's good.'<br>  <br>   <br>  <br>  'Is God all-powerful? Can God do anything?'<br>  <br>   <br>  <br>  'Yes'<br>  <br>   <br>  <br>  'Are you good or evil?'<br>  <br>   <br>  <br>  'The Bible says I'm evil.'<br>  <br>   <br>  <br>  The professor grins knowingly. 'Aha! The Bible!' He considers for a<br>  <br>  moment. 'Here's one for you. Let's say there's a sick person over here<br>  <br>  and you can cure him. You can do it. Would you help him? Would you<br>  <br>  try?'<br>  <br>   <br>  <br>  'Yes sir, I would.'<br>  <br>   <br>  <br>  'So you're good...!'<br>  <br>   <br>  <br>  'I wouldn't say that.'<br>  <br>   <br>  <br>  'But why not say that? You'd help a sick and maimed person if you<br>  <br>  could. Most of us would if we could. But God doesn't.'<br>  <br>   <br>  <br>  The student does not answer, so the professor continues. 'He doesn't,<br>  <br>  does he? My brother was a Christian who died of cancer, even though he<br>  <br>  prayed to Jesus to heal him. How is this Jesus good?  Hmmm? Can you<br>  <br>  answer that one?'<br>  <br>   <br>  <br>  The student remains silent.<br>  <br>   <br>  <br>  'No, you can't, can you?' the professor says. He takes a sip of water<br>  <br>  from a glass on his desk to give the student time to relax.<br>  <br>   <br>  <br>  'Let's start again, young fella. Is God good?'<br>  <br>   <br>  <br>  'Er..yes,' the student says.<br>  <br>   <br>  <br>  'Is Satan good?'<br>  <br>   <br>  <br>  The student doesn't hesitate on this one. 'No.'<br>  <br>   <br>  <br>  'Then where does Satan come from?'<br>  <br>   <br>  <br>  The student falters. 'From God'<br>  <br>   <br>  <br>  'That's right. God made Satan, didn't he? Tell me, son. Is there evil<br>  <br>  in this world?'<br>  <br>   <br>  <br>  'Yes, sir.'<br>  <br>   <br>  <br>  'Evil's everywhere, isn't it? And God did make everything correct??<br>  <br>   <br>  <br>  'Yes'<br>  <br>   <br>  <br>  'So who created evil?' The professor continued, 'If God created<br>  <br>  everything, then God created evil, since evil exists, and according to<br>  <br>  the principle that our works define who we are, then God is evil.'<br>  <br>   <br>  <br>  Again, the student has no answer. 'Is there sickness? Immorality?<br>  <br>  Hatred? Ugliness? All these terrible things, do they exist in this<br>  <br>  world?'<br>  <br>   <br>  <br>  The student squirms on his feet. 'Yes.'<br>  <br>   <br>  <br>  'So who created them?'<br>  <br>   <br>  <br>  The student does not answer again, so the professor repeats his<br>  <br>  question. 'Who created them?' There is still no answer. Suddenly the<br>  <br>  lecturer breaks away to pace in front of the classroom.  The class is<br>  <br>  mesmerized. 'Tell me,' he continues onto another student.<br>  <br>   <br>  <br>  'Do you believe in Jesus Christ, son?<br>  <br>   <br>  <br>  The student's voice betrays him and cracks. 'Yes, professor, I do.'<br>  <br>   <br>  <br>  The old man stops pacing. 'Science says you have five senses you use<br>  <br>  to identify and observe the world around you. Have you ever seen<br>  <br>  Jesus?'<br>  <br>   <br>  <br>  'No sir. I've never seen Him.'<br>  <br>   <br>  <br>  'Then tell us if you've ever heard your Jesus?'<br>  <br>   <br>  <br>  'No, sir, I have not.'<br>  <br>   <br>  <br>  'Have you ever felt your Jesus, tasted your Jesus or smelled your<br>  <br>  Jesus? Have you ever had any sensory perception of Jesus Christ, or<br>  <br>  God for that matter?'<br>  <br>   <br>  <br>  'No, sir, I'm afraid I haven't.'<br>  <br>   <br>  <br>  'Yet you still believe in him?'<br>  <br>   <br>  <br>  'Yes'<br>  <br>   <br>  <br>  'According to the rules of empirical, testable, demonstrable protocol,<br>  <br>  science says your God doesn't exist. What do you say to that, son?'<br>  <br>   <br>  <br>  'Nothing,' the student replies. 'I only have my faith.'<br>  <br>   <br>  <br>  'Yes, faith,' the professor repeats. 'And that is the problem science<br>  <br>  has with God. There is no evidence, only faith.'<br>  <br>   <br>  <br>  The student stands quietly for a moment, before asking a question of<br>  <br>  His own. 'Professor, is there such thing as heat?'<br>  <br>   <br>  <br>  ' Yes.'<br>  <br>   <br>  <br>  'And is there such a thing as cold?'<br>  <br>   <br>  <br>  'Yes, son, there's cold too.'<br>  <br>   <br>  <br>  'No sir, there isn't.'<br>  <br>   <br>  <br>  The professor turns to face the student, obviously interested.<br>  <br>   <br>  <br>  The room suddenly becomes very quiet. The student begins to explain.<br>  <br>   <br>  <br>  'You can have lots of heat, even more heat, super-heat, mega-heat,<br>  <br>  unlimited heat, white heat, a little heat or no heat, but we don't<br>  <br>  have anything called 'cold'. We can hit up to 458 degrees below zero,<br>  <br>  which is no heat, but we can't go any further after that. There is no<br>  <br>  such thing as cold; otherwise we would be able to go colder than the<br>  <br>  lowest -458 degrees.'<br>  <br>   <br>  <br>  'Every body or object is susceptible to study when it has or transmits<br>  <br>  energy, and heat is what makes a body or matter have or transmit<br>  <br>  energy. Absolute zero (-458 F) is the total absence of heat. You see,<br>  <br>  sir, cold is only a word we use to describe the absence of heat. We<br>  <br>  cannot measure cold. Heat we can measure in thermal units because heat<br>  <br>  is energy. Cold is not the opposite of heat, sir, just the absence of<br>  <br>  it.'<br>  <br>   <br>  <br>  Silence across the room. A pen drops somewhere in the classroom,<br>  <br>  sounding like a hammer.<br>  <br>   <br>  <br>  'What about darkness, professor. Is there such a thing as darkness?'<br>  <br>   <br>  <br>  'Yes,' the professor replies without hesitation. 'What is night if it<br>  <br>  isn't darkness?'<br>  <br>   <br>  <br>  'You're wrong again, sir. Darkness is not something; it is the absence<br>  <br>  of something. You can have low light, normal light, bright light,<br>  <br>  flashing light, but if you have no light constantly you have nothing<br>  <br>  and it's called darkness, isn't it? That's the meaning we use to<br>  <br>  define the word.'<br>  <br>   <br>  <br>  'In reality, darkness isn't. If it were, you would be able to make<br>  <br>  darkness darker, wouldn't you?'<br>  <br>   <br>  <br>  The professor begins to smile at the student in front of him. This<br>  <br>  will be a good semester. 'So what point are you making, young man?<br>  <br>   <br>  <br>  'Yes, professor. My point is, your philosophical premise is flawed to<br>  <br>  start with, and so your conclusion must also be flawed.'<br>  <br>   <br>  <br>  The professor's face cannot hide his surprise this time. 'Flawed? Can<br>  <br>  you explain how?'<br>  <br>   <br>  <br>  'You are working on the premise of duality,' the student explains..<br>  <br>  'You argue that there is life and then there's death; a good God and a<br>  <br>  bad God. You are viewing the concept of God as something finite,<br>  <br>  something we can measure. Sir, science can't even explain a thought.'<br>  <br>  'It uses electricity and magnetism, but has never seen, much less<br>  <br>  fully understood either one. To view death as the opposite of life is<br>  <br>  to be ignorant of the fact that death cannot exist as a substantive<br>  <br>  thing.  Death is not the opposite of life, just the absence of it.<br>  <br>   <br>  <br>  'Now tell me, professor. Do you teach your students that they evolved<br>  <br>  from a monkey?'<br>  <br>   <br>  <br>  'If you are referring to the natural evolutionary process, young man,<br>  <br>  yes, of course I do.'<br>  <br>   <br>  <br>  'Have you ever observed evolution with your own eyes, sir?'<br>  <br>   <br>  <br>  The professor begins to shake his head, still smiling, as he realizes<br>  <br>  where the argument is going. A very good semester, indeed.<br>  <br>   <br>  <br>  'Since no one has ever observed the process of evolution at work and<br>  <br>  cannot even prove that this process is an on-going endeavor, are you<br>  <br>  not teaching your opinion, sir? Are you now not a scientist, but a<br>  <br>  preacher?'<br>  <br>   <br>  <br>  The class is in uproar. The student remains silent until the commotion<br>  <br>  has subsided.<br>  <br>   <br>  <br>  'To continue the point you were making earlier to the other student,<br>  <br>  let me give you an example of what I mean.'<br>  <br>   <br>  <br>  The student looks around the room. 'Is there anyone in the class who<br>  <br>  has ever seen the professor's brain?' The class breaks out into<br>  <br>  laughter.<br>  <br>   <br>  <br>  'Is there anyone here who has ever heard the professor's brain, felt<br>  <br>  the professor's brain, touched or smelled the professor's brain? No<br>  <br>  one appears to have done so. So, according to the established rules of<br>  <br>  empirical, stable, demonstrable protocol, science says that you have<br>  <br>  no brain, with all due respect, sir.'<br>  <br>   <br>  <br>  'So if science says you have no brain, how can we trust your lectures, <br>  <br>  sir?'<br>  <br>   <br>  <br>  Now the room is silent. The professor just stares at the student, his<br>  <br>  face unreadable.<br>  <br>   <br>  <br>  Finally, after what seems an eternity, the old man answers. 'I guess<br>  <br>  you'll have to take them on faith.'<br>  <br>   <br>  <br>  'Now, you accept that there is faith, and, in fact, faith exists with<br>  <br>  life,' the student continues. 'Now, sir, is there such a thing as<br>  <br>  evil?'<br>  <br>   <br>  <br>  Now uncertain, the professor responds, 'Of course, there is.  We see<br>  <br>  it everyday It is in the daily example of man's inhumanity to man.  It<br>  <br>  is in the multitude of crime and violence everywhere in the world.<br>  <br>  These manifestations are nothing else but evil.'<br>  <br>   <br>  <br>  To this the student replied, 'Evil does not exist sir, or at least it<br>  <br>  does not exist unto itself. Evil is simply the absence of God. It is<br>  <br>  just like darkness and cold, a word that man has created to describe<br>  <br>  the absence of God. God did not create evil. Evil is the result of<br>  <br>  what happens when man does not have God's love present in his heart.<br>  <br>  It's like the cold that comes when there is no heat or the darkness<br>  <br>  that comes when there is no light.'<br>  <br>   <br>  <br>  The professor sat down.<br>  <br>   <br>  <br>  The student was Albert Einstein.|`|WjjUVPuvaa	I think it's cos some people need to create a good, so they can believe that there is some higher power out there which will make everything okay.

I'll get to that later.  <br>  <br>  You will not know of the existence of God unless you yourself earnestly and sincerely seek to find out if He really does exist.  <br>  <br>  The only thing that the believers can do is to suggest that you try to find out for yourself if God is real and if God has a plan for you.  <br>  <br>  I've been on both sides of the fence.  I've been where you are.  But I wanted to know if there is life after death.  I wanted to know if I would retain the things I learned in this life after death.  <br>  <br>  In my quest for spiritual knowledge, I have come to the conclusion that God does exist.  Jesus Christ is His son, and the savior of the world.  The Holy Ghost testifies of this truth.  God can change you for good in ways that are not possible by any man-made self-improvement course.  <br>  <br>  The thing is, you need to try it out first.  Once you experiment with living Christian principles, you will see how it is good.  Righteous living opens the soul to increased knowledge and truth.  Wickedness blinds the mind and deadens the soul.  It's all your choice.  <br>  <br>  Now back to the logical error in your question.  You tried to state your opinion as fact in the question.  You didn't present any evidence to prove your point.  You challenged us to prove that God exists.  I challenge you that nobody can prove that God doesn't exist.  Any attempt would be futile.  But God leaves the door open to any and all who desire to know Him.  It's up to you.

If we cared more about our life on this planet instead of a mythical afterlife then maybe this planet might be a little better.|`|stAeoUeSaa	Here are just three quick ways to prove it to yourself. <br>   <br>  I. First: You exist. <br>  If matter-energy can NOT be created, how did we all get here in the first place? But here we all are 'existing'. This implies the very hand of God leaving every atheist staring in the mirror asking themselves, "But how?" <br>   <br>  II. Second: ‘Big Bang’ and other cosmological evidence. <br>  If you truly understand quantum mechanics then you will know that the Big Bang theory requires a creator by fiat. Think of the universe in reverse until it's small enough to be completely described by quantum mechanics alone. In order for the universe to start unfolding into what we see now, our universe's specific wave function had to be brought into existence as a certain possibility out of an infinite number of other possible wave functions that had to collapse or at least decohere. At this fuzzy nanoscopic beginning, this required a 'Prime Observer' to enable this and set the expansion of the universe into motion and those initial conditions became the very facets of physical law. What we refer to as this finely tuned 'reality'. This need for an 'observer' comes from the basic quantum mechanical concept known as Shrodinger's Cat. Also, we must remember that the universe is being said to have come from nowhere which implies an act of 'creation'.<br>  This ever increasing expansion of our universe is alluded to 11 times in the Bible:<br>  Job 9:8 ; Psalm 104:2 ; Isaiah 40:22 ; Isaiah 42:5 ; Isaiah 44:24 ; Isaiah 45:12 ; Isaiah 48:13 ; Isaiah 51:13 ; Jeremiah 10:12 ; Jeremiah 51:15 ; Zechariah 12:1 <br>  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_bang" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_bang</a><br>  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schrodingers_cat" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schrodinger...</a><br>  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wave_function_collapse" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wave_functi...</a><br>  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decoherence" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decoherence</a> <br>   <br>  The Bible also alludes to the ‘Big Rip’: <br>  Revelation 6:14 ; Isaiah 34:4 ; 2 Peter 3:10 <br>  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_rip" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_rip</a> <br>   <br>  III.

It could be, just maybe, that people can't deal with there being nothing when they die. Also, I think that religion served the purpose of helping create a more civilized society.

mOWyzwubaa	Numerous evidences suggest that Muslims from Spain and West Africa arrived in the Americas at least five centuries before Columbus. It is recorded, for example that in the mid-tenth century during the rule of the Umayyad Caliph Abdul-Rahman III (929-961), Muslims of African origin sailed westward from the Spanish port of Delba (Palos) into the "Ocean of darkness and fog." They returned after a long absence with much booty from a "strange and curious land." It is evident that people of Muslim origin are known to have accompanied Columbus and subsequent Spanish explorers to the New World. <br>  <br>  A renowned American historian and linguist Leo Weiner of Harvard University, in his book Africa and The Discovery of America (1920) wrote that Columbus was well aware of the Mandinka presence in the New World and that the West African Muslims had spread throughout the Caribbean, Central, South and North American territories, including Canada, where they were trading and intermarrying with the Iroquois and Algonquin Indians. <br>  <br>  Columbus and early Spanish and Portuguese explorers were able to voyage across the Atlantic (a distance of 24,000 Kilometers) thanks to Muslim geographical and navigational information, in particular maps made by Muslim traders, including Al-Masudi (871 - 957 CE) in his book 'Akhbar Az-Zaman' (History of The World) which is based on material gathered in Africa and Asia. As a matter of fact, Columbus had two captains of Muslim origin during his first transatlantic voyage: Martin Alonso Pinzon was the captain of the Pinta, and his brother Vicente Yanex Pinzon was the captain of the Nina. They were wealthy, expert ship outfitters who helped organize the Columbus expedition and repaired the flagship Santa Maria. They did this at their own expense for both commercial and political reasons. The Pinzon family was related to Abuzayan Muhammad III (1362 - 66 CE), the Moroccan sultan of the Marinid dynasty (1196 - 1465 CE). <br>  Anthropologists have proven that the Mandinkas under Mansa Musa's instructions explored many parts of North America via the Mississippi and other rivers systems. At Four Corners, Arizona, writings show that they even brought elephants from Africa to the area. <br>  Columbus admitted in his papers that on Monday, October 21, 1492 CE while his ship was sailing near Gibara on the north-east coast of Cuba, he saw a mosque on the top of a beautiful mountain. The ruins of mosques and minarets with inscriptions of Qur'anic verses have been discovered in Cuba, Mexico, Texas and Nevada. <br>  During his second voyage, Columbus was told by the Indians of Espanola (Haiti), that Black people had been to the island before his arrival. For proof they presented Columbus with the spears of these African Muslims. These weapons were tipped with a yellow metal that the Indians called Guanine, a word of West African derivation meaning 'gold alloy.' Oddly enough,it is related to the Arabic world 'Ghinaa' which means 'Wealth.' Columbus brought some Guanines back to Spain and had them tested. He learned that the metal was 18 parts gold (56.25 percent), six parts silver (18.75 percent and eight parts copper (25 percent), the same ratio as the metal produced in African metal shops of Guinea. <br>  Dr. Barry Fell (Harvard University) introduced in his book Saga America - 1980 solid scientific evidence supporting the arrival, centuries before Columbus, of Muslims from North and West Africa. Dr. Fell discovered the existence of Muslim schools at Valley of Fire, Allan Springs, Logomarsino, Keyhole Canyon, Washoe and Hickison Summit Pass (Nevada), Mesa Verde (Colorado), Mimbres Valley (New Mexico) and Tipper Canoe (Indiana) dating back to 700-800 CE. Engraved on rocks in the old western US, he found texts, diagrams and charts representing the last surviving fragments of what was once a system of schools - at both an elementary and higher levels. The language of instruction was North African Arabic written with old Kufic Arabic script. The subjects of instruction included writing, reading, arithmetic, religion, history, geography, mathematics, astronomy and sea navigation. The descendants of the Muslim visitors of North America are members of the present Iroquois, Algonquin, Anasazi, Hohokam and Olmec native people.|`|Av8ccoYQaa	This is from wikipedia, but I have seen this information before about the fleet of Mali ships:<br>  <br>  "Arabic sources describe what some consider to be visits to the New World by a Mali fleet in 1311.[23] According to these sources, 400 ships from the Mali Empire discovered a land across the ocean to the West after being swept off course by ocean currents. Only one ship returned, and the captain reported the discovery of a western current to Prince Abubakari II; the off-course Mali fleet of 400 ships is said to have conducted both trade and warfare with the peoples of the western lands. Prince Abubakari II then abdicated his throne and set off to explore these western lands. In 1324, the Mali king Mansa Musa is said to have told the Arabic historian, Al-Umari that "his predecessors had launched two expeditions from West Africa to discover the limits of the Atlantic Ocean."<br>  <br>  The quickest route is the mid-trans-Atlantic ocean current, it's a natural shipping lane between the top of Africa and Central America. With Allah's blessing of good winds, it's a relatively quick trip.<br>  <br>  Some evidence suggest West Africans made the trip across the water long before 1311 (see the wiki article and other research available on internet).<br>  <br>  What I don't understand is why many claims with evidence of such trans-Atlantic crossing from Africa are discounted out right. It's a natural shipping land, the same one Columbus used, so why is it hard to believe Africans or Muslims could not make such crossing?<br>  <br>  I also read once, and sorry I don't have a citation, but someone who really wants to know the truth on this can do the research, that Columbus made a remark in his journal that the first peoples he came across in "the New Word" appeared to be "Mohammadeans."<br>  <br>  My hypothesis is also that the Toltec Indian (Yucatan Peninsula, Mexico) legend of the bearded white holy man who came to them across the ocean and who is associated with an actual ruler of the Toltecs around 900 A.D. was Hidden Imam.<br>  <br>  It is possible that both Sunni and Shia Islam had come to America before Columbus.<br>  <br>  I saw a documentary a few years ago on Columbus that suggested he used the natural shipping lane of the mid-trans-Atlantic Ocean current (which would also explain why he landed where he did across the water). The documentary also suggested that Columbus had learned of this route from Muslim sailors. At the time I saw that, I didn't know much about Islam or the Sunni/Shia split or Hidden Imam possibly being connected to the Toltec legend, but it's only the hypothesis that Shia Islam had spread across Mexico that makes any sense to me why Sunni Muslims would have informed Catholics about the shipping lane instead of themselves rushing over to colonize and claim "the New World" for themselves.<br>  <br>  This is a great topic to follow up and explore more; happy researching!|`|m0lxBmPqaa	I think  the ottomans knew the americas but the first people to come to americas were vikings in canada... and of course al-jazeera doesn't count becuase it's muslim..

(The Aztecs made daily human sacrifices to ensure that the Sun would rise. Or did they? ) <br>  The practice of "female circumcision" (more accurately termed genital mutilation). <br>  The discouragement of rational, critical thought (resulting in young-earth creationists, for example). <br>  Uncontrolled population growth caused (or at least helped) by churches prohibiting birth-control and abortion. (You can also add : unwanted pregnancies, ill-fated forced marriages, and pregnant teenagers condemned to a life in mental institutions to avoid embarrassing their families.) <br>  The spread of sexually transmitted diseases (e.g. AIDS) due to churches prohibiting the use of condoms. <br>  Believers whipping, impaling, poisoning or crucifying themselves during religious festivals as a demonstration of their faith and piety. <br>  Suicide bombers taught to believe that martyrs go straight to Paradise. <br>  The indoctrination of children into the religion of their parents, giving them an arbitrary, life-long belief that is almost entirely dependent on their place of birth. <br>  Women treated as second-class citizens or even slaves (article : Islam's Shame). <br>  Pentecostal snake-handlers (Augusta Chronicle news article) <br>  Persecution of homosexuals (Genocide of gay and lesbian youth) <br>  Abuse of power, authority and trust by religious leaders (for financial gain or sexual abuse of followers and even children). <br>  Minor religions ("cults") stockpiling weapons to defend themselves from the Armies Of Satan (i.e. the police and the government).|`|d7c8ecd624fbbc0797b1502ba6682e8baa	drink|`|GQk0UNjfaa	Why does it bother you so?|`|eO2rnf7yaa	I am Roman Catholic.<br>  <br>  I think most atheists who participate in this forum are here to get closer to the Truth.

AA11355939	I think both are rude.  I won't cut in line and I prefer not to listen to a phone conversation either!|`|yhTPcF81aa	First off, if i am standing in line for 2 hours and someone cuts in front of me which causes me to have to wait longer, why wouldnt i get mad?  And what is bad about talking on a phone in public?  Thats what people do, they talk.... in public.  Should everyone just be completely silent when they are in public?    And for the most part, Russia isnt that great of a role-model considering they have one of the most corrupt governments in the world that is slowly slipping back into an authoritarian state.  So, i wouldnt put it past them to think talking freely in public is bad.|`|mbI3LCW0aa	Personally, I think cutting in line is rude because it's disrespectful towards the people who were waiting there before.<br>  <br>  Talking on a mobile phone isn't really rude, only if it's a typically quiet place like a library or a fancy restaurant.
BuJIQ8Jhaa	, Philipa, and Filipino are the two i found that the spell check would accept.|`|AA11048332	In English a 'ph' is pronounced the same as a 'f'.  The correct spelling would be 'Philipean Girl', but you would pronounce it 'Filipean'|`|mbI3LCW0aa	If you're referring to people from the "Philippines", they would be referred to as "Filipino".<br>  <br>  Otherwise, I'm assuming you'd mean Philippians as in the book out of the Bible, which is completely different.
AdFucadgaa	Why would you sell something that you don't owned in the first place? Pray for guidance,you'll overcome it. You are given that problem because he knows that you know how to handle it.If you'll overcome it, assured you that it'll make you a better AND STRONG PERSON. Don't worry too much,everything has a solution.|`|iOPgJ1fNaa	I really would like to have your soul.<br>  Todate i never had a chance to purchase and own a soul, and i m glad that you have put it up for sale. <br>  Kindly give me the details of the deal and how the transaction is to be made.<br>  Form purchaser point of view i would like the following details of the product (soul):<br>  <br>  Brand name<br>  Manufacture date<br>  Expiry Date:<br>  Cost:<br>  Discount Offerred if any<br>  Ingredients in the product<br>  Payment mode: Cheque/Creditcard/DD <br>  Where and how will The Product be delivered.|`|e7304a95864d064998cb6153f4d52b91aa	If you gave your life to God, He already owns your soul. If not, then Satan "owns" it. There are no monatary deals to be made. Talk to a minister at a church that has an AWANA program to get the straight facts. I'll be praying that God will help your family in the meantime.|`|303F69Woaa	Satan already owns you since you've made that statement.|`|bK5MJCxhaa	Ebay?|`|t88527U1aa	Obama looking for a few good men.|`|T57AqnEOaa	That depends.

Neh.1:11 asks God to hear out your prayer and respond to it. Ask for forgiveness and let Him take control of your life.|`|OywIJxobaa	sorry, not interested.|`|y1CRemnPaa	i'll give you five bucks.|`|9PoGLVmXaa	Watch out the problems of this life are short term.

Vch9DTraaa	Dear sweet sister, you are obviously convicted in this area.  I have never thought of actually praying for marilyn manson, but he does need it.  It would be a huge testimony if he came to Christ, wow!  Even more of a testimony if he started singing Christian music.  Because I have read your calling, I'm going to pray for him tonight.  We should come into agreement now about this.  And I'm definitely with you on the, COME KING JESUS, although I do try to keep in mind that He still wants us to accomplish things for Him here first.  Love you dear sister.|`|sA2SAkd9aa	he'sgot some funky eyes thats what i think|`|ufcbQQvbaa	Marilyn Manson is someone who has lost himself. It is a difficult set of circumstances, but we have to understand that, while it is hard, some people are just going to have to make this turn around on their own. You can not be forced to experience the love of God. I'm sure God is constantly trying to work his way into his life, and all we as Christians can do is hope and pray. But it is hard for him to want to come to a religion where people call him satan, or the anti christ, or tell him he is going to hell. We as Christians have to understand that we are not to judge, and if we do, all we will do is drive people away. We need to shower people with love, not tell them that they are going to be tortured if they do not come to Christ.|`|ehBPus3Zaa	Is everyone with the last name - Manson purely evil? NO, but I have seen two people that have that name and they are surely in the clutches of Satan. We as Christians need to pray for everyone to come to the knowledge of Jesus Christ. Our time on the earth is short and we need to be witnessing to the lost more than any other time on earth before it is too late.|`|UinOWcMUaa	I think just keep praying for him -- and don't give up !! Dealing with issues here is sometimes a waste of breath.. but glad to see you care much about this issue !!<br>  <br>  I head of this girl who was His makeup artist and a Christian who would put bible verses in His hat and then go on stage to preform :)|`|ebxwADDcaa	dude i hte maralyn manson. i dont care if hes catholic, antichrist or whatever, i just think he butchers music. <br>  <br>  i dont have anything against antichrist music though, i listen to a lot of bands that are all like "kill god, bury Jesus, its all conspiracy"|`|64d4893f2b5ad37e1908f80ec7b0c4c2aa	Are you that dense that you don't see that christians are why Manson is as popular as he is?<br>  <br>  With christians constantly bringing attention to him, he should be sending you marketing fees.|`|AA10880624	This is the funniest thing I've read about Marilyn Manson.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.theonion.com/content/search/onion/advanced?search=marilyn%20manson&restrict=" rel="nofollow">http://www.theonion.com/content/search/o...</a>|`|A9vvZ6eUaa	Face palm! When will you people realize music does not cause the violence in this world?  Just cause Manson sings it, does not mean people fall for it.|`|LCAXc8S5aa	I think it was D. James Kennedy who shared in a sermon some years ago that Marilyn Manson was raised in a Christian home and attended a Christian school and was treated cruelly by his peers, and that his current persona arose out of rebellion and bitterness against those who treated him that way.|`|AA11634944	It's just music and lyrics. As religious people are entitled the right to express their beliefs and whatnot through music so are atheists. Go ahead and pray if you feel necessary but remember it is a waste of time to dwell on something you cannot change.|`|ngew4AWSaa	I'm sorry, but you are not my sister. Go get a life, and stop preaching like that. It's not what I asked when I came here 2 millennia ago.<br>  <br>  PS. Marilyn Manson Doesn't send you to hell. Coldplay does.|`|4db07412ef2c09f8393cb86bf7e153deaa	You're just finding that album NOW?  Boy, you're behind on the times.  Don't you know that Harry Potter is the new scapegoat?<br>  <br>  P.S., learn how to use an apostrophe.|`|XJ9oSR2daa	All you have to do is look at the 'art' he has had on his album covers, read the lyrics and know that the boy truely isn't saved and has absolutely no love for God.|`|AA11503457	I think MM needs to get saved.  Thanks for praying for my nephew...|`|gKwKxJyNaa	did you come here to ask a question...or just to vent...either way yeah do your praying and what not..i guess|`|pTkjGfBRaa	It's not quite as black and white as you make it out to be.<br>  <br>  There's a little angel in the most devlish of us and a little devil in the most angelic of us.  We are both saint and sinner, both at the same time.<br>  <br>  There's a good clip of Marilyn Manson in Michael Moore's "Bowling for Columbine."  He basically says that we need to listen to our kids more.  In part, Manson's actions are a cry for attention.  It's not good, but it is kind of sad.<br>  <br>  It is good that you are praying, we need more of this, but even someone like Marilyn Manson has something to say you could learn from.<br>  <br>  For the lost who believe that Marilyn Manson is not a satan worshiper, a worshiper of the survival of the fittest, a worshiper of the strong taking advantage of the weak, the best thing you can do is listen earnestly to him, see why he believes what he believes without judging.  But... make sure you're holding the hand of someone else who's on solid bedrock first for support so you don't get sucked in.<br>  <br>  Keep praying the Lord's Prayer, and may the world someday be a place where all are free, where the powerful no longer take advantage of the powerless.<br>  <br>  Thanks for your prayer.  God bless you!<br>  <br>  Post script:  Evil hates nothing more than to be laughed at, to be shown that we don't fear it.

Ao52XHjCaa	I think there are some very good gay movies out there. Many of them being made around the world, in fact. But, sometimes I think that the focus is still too much on the 18-34 demographic and coming out stories. I guess that is the a very important part of the whole life cycle, but finding a mate and "I am gay now" are not lifelong pursuits. It's a budget issue, but I would like to see a few more historical films and a few more films about older GLBT people.  <br>  <br>  I think the 50s and above segment are culturally erased (not just in gay films, but in films in general). There should be more to depict than "I realized I was gay", "I have a first love" "I came out to my family" and "My wild 20s until I found someone special." Makes it seem like life after 40 lacks a vitality worth filming. Adding a few more bisexual characters wouldn't hurt...they are made invisible in movies, too.|`|b371fd5225e0f0948944cb7d323618b7aa	i just wish there would be a big movie with a gay character as a main character but the movie was not centered around being gay or a gay issue. just be the token gay guy, i don't care! the token black guy has grown old, time for a change? :P|`|nisfxpXHaa	I haven't seen the movie you are talking about, but I do know what you mean.<br>  <br>  I think there are several reasons that gay genre movies just aren't as good as they should be.<br>  <br>  First, most have very small budgets. The big movie studios just aren't willing to fund films that could be met with a large amount of public protest. Thus these movies don't tend to have the most talented writers.<br>  <br>  Second, I think many gay movies get bogged down with a script that is so focused on a theme. It's like it tries too hard to tell a gay story, so the script lacks some of the flow that other stories have. Also I think most of the writers feel so obligated to try to represent such a wide diversity in the gay community that this also distracts from the story. <br>  <br>  I find that most gay genre films really lack in the dialog department. And rely to heavily on sex scenes to validate it as a gay film.<br>  <br>  <br>  L|`|tJ0WNq9eaa	I agree that most gay movies seem to be very low budget.  I think it has to do with the perceived profitability of gay movies.  They are aimed at such a focused group that most movie studios are not willing to wager big budgets for them.  Plus, good actors don't want to play gay because then rumors will start popping up about them.<br>  <br>  I think things will im[rove with Logo and other gay agencies willing to ban roll good gay movies.|`|J4SHz2bTaa	teen crushes/coming out/confusion in mind about sexuality<br>  please answer my question<br>  <a href="http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index?qid=20090222210457AAL1xi2">http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index?...</a>|`|ostvx6Myaa	what about boys dont cry, if these walls could talk 2, or my favorite!!! <br>  <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3J0yc4ndZ3s" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3J0yc4ndZ...</a>
45b08ca1dc880690ca7764657e05b376aa	Absolutely! He has answered many prayers for me. I was almost killed (murdered) .

Even when it doesn't look good, it turns out that way.|`|yCdcF3Jcaa	I like to think so|`|Wg3UySpfaa	Absolutely. I can recall many times when I prayed to God about even the smallest wants and needs and he answered them, sometimes the very next day. =)<br>  <br>  Sometimes when i feel my prayers are answered it doesn't mean that they in fact are not, it just means that the answer was "no" or that the answer wasn't as i expected or wanted to be. But at the end when things work out i can see why. God is always there answering you're prayers and everything happens for a reason.|`|bf2b826fb186efa4963970654d24ac34aa	My husband was diagnosed with chronic renal failure in 2005. I prayed daily that God would heal him or get him a transplant or even let him die without a lot of suffering if that was God's Will. He was put on the transplant list in late February 2008 and got a transplant after 6 weeks. That's not common; most have to wait for 3-5 years.<br>  <br>  I was pregnant during this whole transplant ordeal and was so concerned about my husband and his needs that I neglected a good deal of my prenatal care. I knew that was wrong but I asked God daily to watch over the baby. Despite being born 6 weeks premature, he was healthy.<br>  <br>  Looking back at my life, God has answered a lot of my prayers. Sometimes I wonder why because I don't feel I have always deserved it. Some of those answered prayers were not the way I wanted them answered or in my time frame, but they were answered. A good deal of the time, the answer was NO.|`|GBKaftrJaa	Many many times God has done things for me and answered my prayers.<br>  <br>  As a child I prayed every night that I would have a home to live in, just for me to have walls and a ceiling so that I could be safe. My parents always assured me they'd be dead before I graduated high school and then I'd have no where to live.<br>  <br>  At the same time I was saying those prayers my Granny became convicted to not ever let her house out of the family and to make sure the deed was in someone else's name before she died.  Since I was maybe 7 or 8 when I said those prayers, my Granny proceeded to offer her house to all of my 7 older siblings.  They all refused it.  When I was 19, she offered it to me, imagine my surprise, my dream house, not just the 4 walls I had prayed for to keep me safe. I will live here all my life.<br>  <br>  And because the house is almost 100 years old, I am at a loss to keep up with the repairs and so I pray on and off about HOW will I do this, how will I manage, so imagine my amazement when in the church bullitan suddenly a group had formed who would come REPAIR your HOUSE!  FREE!  Oh I was right on that one!<br>  <br>  Then I am always rushed and hectic and whatever... and one day I walked into a small store that I allow my autistic son to run loose in.  (he wants to race up and down the aisles and it's not a busy store so he can do that  there)  And this woman came up to me and told me who she was. I had worked with her 18 years ago and just didn't recognise her.  She proceeded to tell me every single word I needed to hear.  She praised me and affirmed me and her words were just everything I needed to hear - yet before she came up to say those things to me, I didn't even realize how MUCH I needed to hear those things.<br>  <br>  What kept me so rivoted to what she was saying was, she seemed illuminated. I was looking around her to see if the sun was setting in the store window, then looking at the ceiling to see if she was under a spotlight, then I looked around her every other way and never saw what was making her glow.  No one else in the store looked as bright as Betty did.  And it occured to me that in "Uncle Tom's Cabin" they talk about "the light of heaven" being upon dying people, so I even asked her if she was ok.  She said she was great. She died 3 days later.  I hadn't seen her for 18 years but God put her right in my path so that she could say exactly what I needed to hear as one of her last acts on Earth.<br>  <br>  Oh and there was the time when I was out with my autistic son being mindful of how many "transitions" he had been through that day, knowing to limit my shopping, when all of the sudden a very uncharacteristic thought of making one more stop popped into my head and I asked him if he would like to eat lunch at the McDonald's playland?  He said yes and we went.  And the normally packed play land was empty except for one other mom and her child. I would normally explain to another mom that my son was autistic before he did something offensive but my son seemed to play nicely that day so I just watched them as the other mom did. My son finally walked away from the girl while she was talking to him and I said "Oh, I'm sorry, my son is autistic and sometimes he needs to walk away like that" and I went after him to remind him of what he had done and why we don't do that.<br>  <br>  The other mom was thunder struck.  She had taken a day off from work. She works for the state department of special education.  I asked her what that even was... I had no clue.  And when she explained I said how WORRIED I had been about how I could EVER educate my son because of his combination of needs and how he could not attend any kind of school.  She just couldn't stop gasping. She pulled out a notepad she had with her and wrote down the websites and phone numbers for cyber schools - something I had never heard of, gave me phone numbers of people to report problems to in her department, and just met ALL my needs I currently had with my son.  She even commented on what a miracle it was that SHE had been here on a day when she would NEVER come and that it was something we NEVER did either, and what a miracle it was. And the other thing that made me pay attention to the mom, before we talked was... she looked JUST like my sister who was made to raise me as a young child when my mother refused to care for me.<br>  <br>  So do I "believe" God works in MY life... oh my!  I can't wait to see what he does next!  I'm so blessed and amazed at the things God does for me.  He loves me SO MUCH.  And what's amazing is he loves every single other person just as much as he loves me.  And he DOES love me!|`|AA11502346	Yes.  He answers my prayers; sometimes "no" and sometimes "yes."|`|XqpRYh52aa	No.<br>  There is no evidence to show that prayer works but plenty to show that it doesn't.|`|kF9aHWfUaa	Yes.|`|X3lrPVbKaa	Yes, God is helping us all the way. Its our choice to choose what we see.|`|db7df25ea31227e5641d5c32d43c3bcdaa	yes God odes work in my life|`|7oetZ4I3aa	hell no, <br>  why give credit to an imaginary person for all the good<br>  and then it's suddenly my fault for the bad|`|1Y1PBMXlaa	Well, no, but when I hired Jesus to mow my lawn he stole my hedge clippers!|`|sh7F6GR8aa	Si|`|303F69Woaa	I asked God in prayer to help me to stop smoking and I quit cold turkey 14 years ago after more than 20 years of smoking, I also asked for help with many other things and my language is clean now and I feel much better than I use to. When finacial problems arise things always seem to transpire to get me through. My daughter has gone through many surgeries because of an incurable illness, the last time even the doctors and nurses expected her to die mostly due to her refusal of blood in keeping with Acts 15:20,29. Still alive and fighting hard. God's Holy Spirit works continually in my family's life.|`|Ny7PHJiAaa	I do not pray to god for good things to happen in my life and I do not pray for myself. I only pray for others.<br>  My life has had its share of ups and downs the same as everyone else, but it has always been GOD that has seen me thru them, and god does work in my life everyday,<br>  he gives me all I need to feed my soul before I take over and start my days off working for him.|`|GJS3hTK5aa	Yes, of course he does. This happens only for those who do not rely on themselves and rely only on God. When you submit your life in his hands and wait on him, he gives you the will of your heart. But you have to prove it to him that you love him above everything else. This is possible only through following his teachings without fail. Even if we may fail now and then, we can reconcile through Lord Jesus Christ.|`|4VOTwqgPaa	Nope, never did and I doubt he ever will. I do believe he has an odd sense of humour, though.<br>  <br>  Actually, I rather like it that he forces me to fight for what I want, rather than handing it to me on a silver platter.<br>  <br>  Aaah, and I'm not even religious. I'm agnostic.|`|WvqRJow1aa	Yes He does. I've seen things happen in my life without any logical reason. I'm not so much into the praying part because I think it's stupid to always have to ask. But if He gives without my asking, how much more would a prayer mean to Him !|`|7utlNXpKaa	Absolutely, he has transformed my life!

Like above as high as my body could go, after smokin and bein high, and i somehow got higher than that. I felt like i was invincible, and above the clouds, and everythign was so crisp, and atmospheric pressure was gone, and i felt euphoric. It was the best feeling ever, and you kno the feeling you get when you go down a steep hill on a rollercoaster, well i felt that same feeling the entire time. it lasted for about 10 minutes.

The Bible was written in a vernacular that encourages people to discuss. It is a sin to question God, and that's because God has a plan, and if he knows what is going to happen and the results of any action, then who are we to question God. If anything it would be foolish not to ask any person a question.

This was possible in and through the human nature that Christ took on.<br>  <br>  God-incarnate (Jesus) entered into the state and condition of our fallen human nature, of the sinner, because God wants to be with his Beloved (us) everywhere we are!<br>  <br>  This means that God-incarnate entered into all the dark places that sin takes us, all the way to death itself. WHY? In order to brings God's presence there, so we don't have to be afraid of suffering or death, because God accompanies us there!<br>  <br>  the cause of all sin is our FEAR of DEATH, so GOD had to GO THERE in LOVE! To conquer sin and death with his RESURRECTION from the dead!! the test of salvation history is to ...Christ does this in and through his Human Nature, thus representing humanity perfectly before God the Father, making us RIGHTOUS in CHRIST!!!<br>  By BAPTISM, we are joined to Christ, live IN Him, also in daily prayer, Sacraments esp, the Holy Eucharist, Bible reading, loving, etc.<br>  <br>  After the Resurrection, Jesus is not a ghost, zombie, etc.<br>  Jesus is truly God and truly Man, this means that God has a glorified human nature united to Himself!|`|db7df25ea31227e5641d5c32d43c3bcdaa	no the physical body died not the essence that was in that physical body.<br>  <br>  Jesus was in a resurrected body<br>  <br>  stop mocking God and blaspheming his name|`|Eo7KcX3Waa	Have you ever heard of the Resurrection ?<br>  Jesus is not dead, He is very alive, and so is God...|`|SbN2cXE5aa	Doesn't deserve an answer.|`|dKgkHZf3aa	If Jesus was ressurected does that mean God was too?<br>  <br>  Forgive me...

He's a great spirit beyond comprehension. And you don't seem to understand the concept of physical body vs. soul. Jesus had a physical body, but he had a spirit inside him from God that lives on. You have a physical body. It's temporary and it will die and decay. But your soul will live on.|`|XhtDtZK9aa	I feel sorry for you that you would even think of Jesus as a zombie or vampire he is our Lord and savior.you can't do anything without the Lord I really believe that .

(Matthew 6:9-11; Luke 11:1, 2) In prayer with his apostles—only hours before his death—Jesus petitioned: “Father, the hour has come; glorify your son, that your son may glorify you. This means everlasting life, their taking in knowledge of you, the only true God, and of the one whom you sent forth, Jesus Christ.”—John 17:1, 3.<br>  <br>  Notice that Jesus prays to One whom he calls “the only true God.” He points to God’s superior position when he continues: “So now you, Father, glorify me alongside yourself with the glory that I had alongside you before the world was.” (John 17:5) Since Jesus prayed to God requesting to be alongside God, how could Jesus at the same time be “the only true God”? Let us examine this matter.<br>  Jesus’ Position in Heaven<br>  <br>  A few hours after this prayer, Jesus was executed. But he was not dead for long—only from Friday afternoon till Sunday morning. (Matthew 27:57–28:6) “This Jesus God resurrected,” the apostle Peter reports, “of which fact we are all witnesses.” (Acts 2:31, 32) Could Jesus have resurrected himself? No, according to the Bible, the dead “are conscious of nothing at all.” (Ecclesiastes 9:5) “The only true God,” Jesus’ heavenly Father, resurrected his Son.—Acts 2:32; 10:40.<br>  <br>  A short time afterward, Jesus’ disciple Stephen was killed by religious persecutors. As they were about to stone him, Stephen was granted a vision. He stated: “Look! I behold the heavens opened up and the Son of man standing at God’s right hand.” (Acts 7:56) Jesus, “the Son of man,” was thus seen by Stephen in a role supportive to God in heaven—“at God’s right hand”—even as he had been ‘alongside God’ before he came to earth.—John 17:5.<br>  <br>  Later, after Stephen’s execution, Jesus made a miraculous appearance to Saul, better known by his Roman name, Paul. (Acts 9:3-6) When Paul was in Athens, Greece, he spoke of “the God that made the world and all the things in it.” He said that this God, the “only true God,” will “judge the inhabited earth in righteousness by a man whom he has appointed, and he has furnished a guarantee to all men in that he has resurrected him from the dead.” (Acts 17:24, 31) Here the apostle Paul described Jesus as “a man”—yes, lesser than God—whom God had restored to life in heaven.<br>  <br>  The apostle John too described Jesus as subordinate to God. John said that he had written his Gospel so that readers might come to believe that “Jesus is the Christ the Son of God”—not that he was God. (John 20:31) John also received a heavenly vision in which he saw “the Lamb,” who in his Gospel is identified as Jesus. (John 1:29) The Lamb is standing with 144,000 others, who John says “have been bought [or resurrected] from the earth.” John explains that the 144,000 have the Lamb’s “name and the name of his Father written on their foreheads.”—Revelation 14:1, 3.<br>  <br>  Could “the Lamb” be the same as “his Father”? Clearly not. In the Bible they are distinct. They even have different names.<br>  Name of the Lamb and of the Father<br>  <br>  As we have just seen, the name given to God’s Son, the Lamb, is Jesus. (Luke 1:30-32) What about his Father’s name? It appears in the Bible thousands of times. For example, Psalm 83:18 says: “You, whose name is Jehovah, you alone are the Most High over all the earth.” Sadly, God’s name, Jehovah, has been replaced in many Bible translations by the terms “LORD” and “GOD,” often spelled in all capital letters. The capitals are supposed to distinguish Jehovah from others called gods or lords.* Yet, in many Bible translations, the Divine Name has been restored to its rightful place.<br>  <br>  The English-language American Standard Version (1901) is a notable example of a Bible translation that has restored God’s name, Jehovah, to its rightful place. Its preface observes: “The American Revisers, after a careful consideration, were brought to the unanimous conviction that a Jewish superstition, which regarded the Divine Name as too sacred to be uttered, ought no longer to dominate in the English or any other version of the Old Testament, as it fortunately does not in the numerous versions made by modern missionaries.”<br>  Triad of gods from Egypt<br>  <br>  EGYPT<br>  Triad of Horus, Osiris, and Isis, second millennium B.C.E.<br>  Triad of gods from Syria<br>  <br>  PALMYRA, SYRIA<br>  Triad of moon god, Lord of Heavens, and sun god, c. first century C.E.<br>  Triad of gods from India<br>  <br>  INDIA<br>  Triune Hindu godhead, c. seventh century C.E.<br>  Triad of gods from Norway<br>  <br>  NORWAY<br>  Trinity (Father, Son, and Holy Spirit), c. 13th century C.E.<br>   <br>  The Trinity—Whose Teaching?<br>  <br>  What, then, about the teaching that Jehovah and Jesus are, in effect, the same God, as the Trinity doctrine proclaims? In its issue of April-June 1999, The Living Pulpit magazine defined the Trinity this way: “There is one God and Father, one Lord Jesus Christ, and one Holy Spir

Where is the scholar? Where is the philosopher of this age? Has not God made foolish the wisdom of the world? 21For since in the wisdom of God the world through its wisdom did not know him, God was pleased through the foolishness of what was preached to save those who believe. 22Jews demand miraculous signs and Greeks look for wisdom, 23but we preach Christ crucified: a stumbling block to Jews and foolishness to Gentiles, 24but to those whom God has called, both Jews and Greeks, Christ the power of God and the wisdom of God. 25For the foolishness of God is wiser than man's wisdom, and the weakness of God is stronger than man's strength.<br>  <br>   26Brothers, think of what you were when you were called.

T1beLIQqaa	Everyone above, Arabs are Semitic White, NOT Black-two different ethnicities.Models Iman and Lila Kebbedde-both have Arab Semitic White fathers-everyone above-Arabs ARE NOT Black-they are White. About 1/3 of Ethiopia and Somalia are Arab Semitic White. Sudan is half Arab Semitic White. North Africa(1/3 of Africa includes the following seven countries or territories: Algeria, Egypt, Libya, Morocco, Sudan, Tunisia, and, Western Sahara, and, are  Arab Semitic White. These countries also have a high admixture of Black/Arab Semitic White-Berbers and Moors-8-15% Black heritage, Hamites-usually half and half, but almost any combination). Syrian, Saudi Arabia, and the United Arab Emirates( a federation of seven states situated in the southeast of the Arabian Peninsula in Southwest Asia on the Persian Gulf, bordering Oman and Saudi Arabia. The seven states, termed emirates, are Abu Dhabi, Ajman, Dubai, Fujairah, Ras al-Khaimah, Sharjah and Umm al-Quwain), are all Arab Semitic White.Like most half Black/half White mixes, Black feaures dominate, but skin color is usually the olive(golden brown) skin colr of the Arabs. Most of the time, the nose is also pronounced and more narrow. The lips to, are generally thinner.Egypt, both Ancient, and, Modern, is 65% Arab Semitic White, 30% Black , Black/Arab Semitic White, and, 5% all other ethnicities.|`|IeNMtqUYaa	Like Egyptian.<br>  <br>  Just to let you know, most emirati (is that even the correct term?) look black.<br>  <br>  Look at some pictures of people from Oman and Yemen (countries south of Saudi Arabia) they look black even though they're arabs.|`|6oASoFr7aa	pretty much like an african-american.

yu53u5TFaa	Good question. I mean, there's a ******* talking donkey in it.|`|UiUSsfuYaa	It all depends on what questions you ask. Ask about things that Numbers addresses, and you'll get quotes from Numbers. If you are curious about the book, then be proactive - pick up the Bible and read it for yourself.|`|UinOWcMUaa	Like many things it's just not popular reading I suppose :(<br>  <br>  The Hebrew title Bamidbar, meaning "in the desert", "serves to foreground the years of testing in the wilderness that make up the central section of the book (chapters 11-21)."[2] The English title Numbers is derived from the Greek of the Septuagint, referencing the numbering of the Israelites in the wilderness of Sinai and later on the plain of Moab.|`|6Whz1p5Eaa	Because it's mind numbingly dull|`|F4Wu6JXyaa	Apart from all of the statistics of no interest, Numbers is a re-hash of the latter part of Exodus.  Of course there are parts that don't quite agree with Exodus, but since no one reads Numbers, that doesn't come up often; and when it does, the "bible is all true" apologists assume that the events described in both books happened twice, which neatly explains all differences. <br>  <br>  One interesting difference in Numbers is the presentation of the character Aaron.  Both Aaron and Aaron's sons are given a rather more prominent part in the Numbers version.  Aaron is more of a partner with Moses, not so much the bumbling sidekick we know from the Exodus stories.  <br>  <br>  Numbers also describes how the land of Israel is to be divided among the tribes ... which doesn't quite agree how it ends up divided, in Joshua and Judges. <br>  <br>  But to get at all this you must read it, and to read it you must plough through the interminable Census Report it contains.|`|bXeHr69Vaa	try and read the phone book that's also the book of numbers|`|ebxwADDcaa	well...i dont know, read it yourself and find out.<br>  <br>  i think its mostly stating laws, not really telling stories or anything like that.|`|Eo7KcX3Waa	Who are you listening to ?<br>  I read all of my bible , every book and I love the little books like Haggai and Amos...

For example, in native beliefs, the deer represents compassion, peace, caring, adventure, gentleness; among others.  These characteristics are representative of my own personality because I care about others and try my best to help them when they are in need.  The owl represents insight, clairvoyance, and is a messenger.  I try to be insightful by… (Sorry, can’t fill this out for you because I don't know anything about you or how you might exhibit this characteristic).  I chose the salmon because it symbolizes pride, confidence, wisdom and inspiration.  Everything I do, I do it with confidence and I experience inspiration to help me reach my goals in life.  I chose the dove, which symbolizes love, gentleness, cross-world communication and peace, because I try to love and be gentle with others.  My last totem, the hummingbird, represents timelessness, healing, warriors and is also a messenger.  I chose this because I fight for what I want and try my best to achieve my goals.|`|AA11143431	These five animals have similar characteristics as I do.

806025c44dd8e27b6c1d544348b087c0aa	Why don't you give up some time -- and use that time to do a daily devotion?|`|bXeHr69Vaa	you don't have to give up anything, do something that you would normally don't like doing,extra h/work, visit the sick, charitable donations and so on|`|pTkjGfBRaa	For this year you might consider giving up giving something up, or giving up the idea that you have to give up something new.  Pride in giving up something new every year can be a sin in itself.<br>  <br>  I like the idea of giving up some time for Lent, but I think you could also give up a little time AND money.  This is what I suggest: <br>  <br>  First, read Matthew 26:6-16.<br>  <br>  Give up a little of your time to buy 40 stamps, and 40 envelopes and thank you notes.  Every day, give up a little of your time and send a thank-you note to someone for something they may not have noticed, but for which you are truly thankful for.  As you go through the 40 days, imagine yourself walking with Jesus, knowing that your days with the people you love are precious.  You will not always be with them.  They will not always be with you.<br>  <br>  Instead of giving up something this Lenten season, you can give TO somebody this Lenten season.  You will love Jesus by loving your neighbor.  <br>  <br>  You need to love, and people you know need to know they're loved and appreciated.  Our time on this earth is limited.  Do you see the connection to Matthew 26:6-16?<br>  <br>  God bless you!<br>  <br>  ***<br>  <br>  Matthew 9.13:<br>  Go and learn what this means, “I desire mercy, not sacrifice.” For I have come to call not the righteous but sinners.’|`|zUMvC6QEaa	If you can't decide what to do then i find it hard to believe you are Catholic.

The Big Bang theory is nothing like breaking a watch and stuffing it in a sack, and if you think it is, then there's no wonder you can't fathom it.|`|ridu0Rtwaa	Ah but it you that are so out of step!!!<br>  <br>  The Pope, Catholic Church, Church of England and mainstream churches all accept evolution and the big bang!!<br>  <br>  Lord Carey the former Archbishop of Canterbury put it rather well – “Creationism is the fruit of a fundamentalist approach to scripture, ignoring scholarship and critical learning, and confusing different understandings of truth”!! <br>  <br>  Better start learning fast or you will be the laughing stock for christians, the other religions and atheists!!|`|5MLPuTdqaa	Explain my reasoning?<br>  <br>  I don't believe the universe came into existence by some cosmic belch. I don't know how the universe came to be. What does a watch in a sack shaken about have to do with anything, really? I know what you're trying to imply, but the present state of things can hardly be compared to a watch shaken about in a stack, they are different things. I don't have faith. I have doubt.

Life is, so just enjoy making at effort at understanding it.|`|HIskrREJaa	I don't know how the universe was created and I'm perfectly happy not pretending to know the answer to everything.|`|wZEGi1EHaa	wait...wouldn't your god be vastly more complex than this world...and still have no creator himself?<br>  so, aren't you arguing against yourself?|`|tI1NHwfBaa	The Big Bang theory is the most tested and verified science there is, full stop.<br>  <br>  But that's cool, because the Big Bang is entirely compatible with scripture.  The Bible screams Big Bang!  When science said the Universe had no beginning and was eternal and unchanging, the Bible said that the Universe had a beginning and it was being spread out, like a tent.  Science eventually caught up, and now the two agree.<br>  <br>  The Bible and science reveal the same truths, when they're correct and our understanding of them is correct.  All truth is God's truth, after all.<br>  <br>  So in my opinion you'll get mostly poor answers from asking the question this way, because you're discounting good science and good scripture that contain truth.  Uneducated Christians and atheists will respond with incorrect and contradictory answers.<br>  <br>  For instance, oddly, a common (uneducated) atheist argument is that the Universe had to have a beginning, and thus God couldn't exist because he had no beginning.  This makes no sense.  God, by definition, is eternal, omnipotent, omniscient and omnipresent.  Something that exists outside of time is not bound by time, therefore God has no beginning and no end and does not need an explanation for his existence.  The Universe does, and it requires something that is outside of the natural, or super-natural.<br>  <br>  Your reference to the watchmaker's argument is good, though it will be rejected.  Those who reject the existence of God commonly reject, out of hand, arguments such as this, largely because they have no decent refutation.  They think it's acceptable to dismiss this argument as trite or invalid, even though the fact they've heard it many times before has no bearing on the quality of the argument itself.|`|cfda9b5d078d37da24e0ff1809dee8d5aa	" . . imagine a puddle waking up one morning and thinking, 'This is an interesting world I find myself in, an interesting hole I find myself in, fits me rather neatly, doesn't it? In fact it fits me staggeringly well, must have been made to have me in it!' This is such a powerful idea that as the sun rises in the sky and the air heats up and as, gradually, the puddle gets smaller and smaller, it's still frantically hanging on to the notion that everything's going to be alright, because this world was meant to have him in it, was built to have him in it; so the moment he disappears catches him rather by surprise.

YOU are the person who credits the existence of everything to the manual creation of a giant invisible man.  Where did this deity come from?

So first of all, your argument is internally inconsistent.<br>  <br>  Second of all, the fact that you use this bogus argument, shows that you are clueless when it comes to science and what we've learned from it.  My wristwatch wasn't purely made from scratch from somebody who'd never seen watches before.  It was based off older models from the same company, which was based on even older models from other companies, which were based on the first watches, which were ultimately based on the first old mechanical clocks, which were ultimately based on ancient water clocks, and eventually the sundial which was just a stick in the ground.<br>  <br>  So it was actually DESCENT WITH SLIGHT MODIFICATION that "created" the watch you have in your hands.

Slavery didn't come along until later, true; but the African nation was filled with strong warriors hoping to get a jump on the Europeans in populating the newfound lands.<br>  <br>  Finally, when England did gain control of the land through trickery, the last of the rebelling Native Americans (after the Spanish slaughter, wars and diseases from all the above mentioned nations) fought a war (equally guilty and innocent) with all peoples of the USA, including any Asians, Germans, Scottish, Irish, Indian and even other Natives.  <br>  <br>  Although the crimes against the Native Americans were horrible, the crimes they commited themselves were also horrible, and no one country (or race) should recieve more blame than the other.<br>  <br>  So, are white people single-handedly responsible?

A stock trader or investor is probably more bothered by the Wall Street; a person who just got mugged is probably more bothered by the burglar.<br>  <br>  "Out of sight, out of mind" is a wonderful little saying that explains this mentality perfectly.|`|9UNsd4Vtaa	I don't get bothered by either.  I don't carry a wallet - just  a debit card specifically for shopping that has a set amount of money in the account, in my pocket and I knew better than to gamble with my money on wall-street.<br>  <br>  But to answer your questions.  Those on wall street should never see the light of day with out the shadow of prison bars.  Unfortunately though, it's not just them.  <br>  <br>  Look at EXXON they had billions in profits while the fuel prices were driving the economy into the ground.  They are thieves also.  Those bank CEO's and their millions of dollars in bonuses from banks that now have their hands out for the TARP money cause they can't make a 10,000$ loan.  They have no assets.<br>  <br>  Take a look at the welfare program and that chick in cali with what, 14 kids.  She has no job so who supports her?  The people who bust their butts everyday just to feed their own families.  Oh or the ones who have 3 or 4 kids with as many daddies who live on welfare and child support but somehow manage to get their nails, hair and tanning done.<br>  <br>  The society is only as strong as their weakest population.  However, enabling people to be weak creates chaos and the strong manipulate the system to their benefit.<br>  <br>  What a rant.  Sorry.  Going to bed now.|`|522Oa2apaa	i was thinking the same thing too. people must look at the longterm effect of such crime committed by white people. what is the average amt of cash one carries in their wallet daily, esp. with the increasing use of credit and debit cards?? not much. so if a man steals your wallet they are likey not going away with much cash and its something that you can easily replace, but a white guy on wall street they go away with your life savings, and the effects are horrible- u cant pay your rent/mortage, car loan, tuition, electricity bill etc. things are even scarier when you dont know whats going on behind your back. can a stolen wallet put you out on the street or a wall street crime?? think about it. you cant trust them white people.|`|sBdOzbx5aa	Then they get put in nicer Federal prisons where they get to choose their food off menus and watch TV all day.

Once you've learned the basics of how spells and magick work, and how to cast them, then you can start to cast simple spells, working up to more complex spells.

The power of your spell is based on three factors. First, the conditions in the universe. Second, the power of your word. Third and last, your faith. But we'll leave the mechanics of how a spell works for later. For now, lets look at the spells you've already cast - successfully - meaning that the above three conditions were met.<br>  <br>  Are you experiencing financial problems? The spells you may be casting on yourself probably include, "Money doesn't grow on trees." "Work sucks!" "I hate my job." "I hate my boss." "I'm no good with numbers." "The economy is bad." "I need a new job." "I am a painter / doctor / dentist / mechanic / programmer / whatever"<br>  <br>  Are you experiencing romantic / relationship problems? The spells you may be casting on yourself probably include, "Men / Women are impossible to understand." "Men / women are frustrating." "Relationships take work." "More than half of all marriages fail." "All the good men / women are already married." "I'm lonely." "I want a girlfriend / boyfriend." "I am single." "I am not dating anyone right now." <br>  <br>  If you cast these spells upon yourself often enough, you'll start believing them. When word seep deeply into your subconscious through conditioning, validation, then repetition, you've officially hypnotised yourself with your own words. This makes for the most powerful spells. Then, when an opportunity comes up (conditions in the universe) you'll subconsciously lock the door to a raise / promotion / new job / lover / mate before it even opens. <br>  <br>  Some of these mantras / spells above may sound counter intuitive. Some of these spells may not seem to harm you or keep you from your dreams and goals. They may simply seem like statements of fact. The trouble with facts is that they are maleable. <br>  <br>  Quantum physics has recently demonstrated that the observer is indeed the one doing the creating. When a light wave is observed, it becomes a particle. When that same wave is in its natural state, it remains as waves of energy. Margaret Wolfe Hungerford observed, "Beauty is in the eye of the beholder." How does this apply to you?<br>  <br>  Lets disect the above mantras. When you say, "Men / Women are impossible to understand," you are making a condition a fact. Any usage of the TO BE Verbs (am was is are will-be) is a statement of fact. The instant you state something as a fact, you've made a judgement call. Remember who it was that warned, "Do not judge. For the measure you are measuring out will be measured back unto you."<br>  <br>  In the example above, you've created a universe for yourself where it is futile to get to know men/women. That message begins to permeate your nervous system - your perceptions darken, your synapses - your thoughts close off, your physiology - you cross your arms and legs, then your entire being - just before your hot date walks out on you.<br>  <br>  Remember. We once accepted as fact that the world was flat. But that's not the point. The point is that that belief completely impacted our behavior. No sailor sailed to the horizon line. World trade was halted. Phycists and philosophers were burned at the stake for saying that the world is round. Nobody understood the seasons. So no matter what the external situation is, it's your internal representation that defines your world.<br>  <br>  If you say, "I want a girlfriend/boyfriend." There is nothing unhealthy about that expression. You are simply accepting a feeling and putting the universe on notice about your desires. But, as soon as you've done so, you must immediately empty yourself of that desire. Buddha said that. Why? because if you get used to wanting a relationship, then that very wanting itself becomes your habit. You will do what ever it takes, even at the sacrifice of your fulfillment, to perpetuate that desire. Taoists still to this day observe, "If you want a taste of my tea, you must first empty your cup."<br>  <br>  Fill your cup with desire. Observe it. Taste it. Become full of it. Then empty your vessle so that it can be filled with the target of your intention NOT THE INTENTION ITSELF.<br>  <br>  If you turned the following statements: "I am a teacher / doctor / welder / programmer / etc," by repeatedly making them your default response to, "What do you do?" Then you may have relationship or financial frustrations due to these self cast spells - mantras. You see, saying that you ARE something carries with it associated connotations. If a stranger tells you that he / she is a obstetrician, what images come to mind? If a stranger tells you that he / she is a tailor, do you associate a fantastic mediteranean dish with this person?<br>  <br>  When you say, "I am _____" you are causing all the neurons in your body to fire with the associated images and prejudices. If you want to be wealthy, saying "I am a teacher," will simply remind you about the low salaries, children, long paid vacations, and books. This spell will not remind you that money is simple to m|`|7d49ddbf3b36edeb5a77c20235621a44aa	you need a candle bat wings and a rubber chicken to swing around over your head . sorry I couldn't help the sarcastic humor . but I think you will  find out spells don't work but your mind when focused can affect change if put into action.if you want to spent this time in a viable sense may I suggest a medical affirmed method called transcendental meditation.

You could do the daily grind, slog your way up from teller to financial accountant (with the proper training) and use that to leverage yourself into upper management, or you could simply walk behind the counter or into the vault, slip a few thousand into something concealed and walk out, and the results are pretty much the same, but the consequences aren't.<br>  <br>  Magick tends to work the same way. People who use magick to enrich themselves the 'wrong' way tend to suffer alot more from the consequences of their endeavors, whether by manipulating, or being manipulated by, others, giving into the dark side more and more, losing touch with reality, creating a chain of dark consequences that can usually only result in a dark ending, or even get everything that they want and find that it doesn't make them feel happy or safe or secure at all (since there is always a bigger fish out there than you.)<br>  <br>  It's not a question of can but how and what then.|`|GPYN9CiAaa	well im more pagan then wiccan, the way i see it the speel to gain wealth is more of a way like, maybe luck in a casino or help you out finding a really good job, i personally never tryed it because magik is not used for personall gain its bad joo joo you know hat im saying ;-)|`|6606e05490b3dda4a1a50ccc078bc327aa	Magic is just another word for deception, treachery,or witchcraft.

You cannot wish that much for yourself, or usually, be so precise about what you want that you get it without paying an unwanted price for it.  Money may come in the form of insurance for an accident, which would have adverse consequences.

I believe my current position is – to some extent – due to magic, but I have paid a price along the way and the process of getting here took decades.<br>  <br>  There are a couple of problems with using magic to bring money.<br>  <br>  The first is that you rarely get good results with magical operations if you're desperate, and money problems often lead people to becoming desperate.<br>  <br>  The second is that, if magic does work to bring you money, there will probably be a price to pay; you definitely can't materialise a suitcase full of $100 bills out of thin air, but magic can nudge events to bring money your way. Before you attempt to use magic to bring you money, consider that, if it does work, it may well be in the form of a life insurance payment following the death of someone you love, an injury compensation payment following you experiencing a lot of physical pain, being led into criminal activities for which you'll pay a price and so on.<br>  <br>  Before you seek shortcuts on the way to wealth, think very carefully about what you want, why you want it and the price you're willing to pay.|`|VRSUyeqbaa	magic is to never be used for personal gain, you can do spells to give you ideas, but to actually make money, very bad|`|175061f78daa0acce0c1ddee4462560caa	yes.<br>  I am Wiccan and there is nothing wrong with casting spells for money.<br>  You may not win the lottery but you may be presented with a job in which you will make more money or a job in general.|`|pjuwo1NOaa	Nope.I don't know how they do it, but there always hidden money somewhere.In plus, if magic could be used for personal gain, we would have alot more rich people in the world.

tI1NHwfBaa	I think your citation is off just a bit.  It's John 9:1.  The chapter runs 41 verses.<br>  <br>  But the implication is that the man is blind because of his sin, and is blind because he is being punished, or he's blind because of his parents' sins, and the parents are being punished through their blind son and their sin is being transferred on to their offspring.<br>  <br>  But Jesus says neither of these is the reason that the man is blind.  He points out that the hardship of blindness exists for this guy so that God can be glorified.  And indeed, God is glorified when the man is healed; he comes to know God (which is far better than being able to see) and his story becomes a great illustration for generations afterward.|`|JXfGHsF6aa	What did Jesus Answer?<br>  <br>  Joh 9:3-5 Jesus answered, Neither hath this man sinned, nor his parents: but "that the works of God should be made manifest in him."

"Is this the one you say was born blind? How is it that now he can see?"<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  They only asked if it was his father's or mother's sin because of (Exodus 20:5) - "You shall not worship them or serve them; for I, the Lord your God, am a jealous God, visiting the iniquity of the fathers on the children, on the third and the fourth generations of those who hate Me," and (Deuteronomy 5:9) <br>   20:"We know he is our son," the parents answered, "and we know he was born blind. 21But how he can see now, or who opened his eyes, we don't know. Ask him. He is of age; he will speak for himself." 22:His parents said this because they were afraid of the Jews, for already the Jews had decided that anyone who acknowledged that Jesus was the Christ[a] would be put out of the synagogue. 23That was why his parents said, "He is of age; ask him."|`|rU6nh42Eaa	The passage says that the man was born blind, but probably they didn't know it at the time.  In that time and culture, there were more reasons why a person was ill or handicapped.  We might ask what happened -- did an accident or disease cause his blindness?  They thought of afflictions as more of a punishment.  Had the man done something bad and gone blind?  Of course, it could have been done as a result of his foolishness in an accident.  The question about the parents shows their belief in inherited curses.  The sins of the father were visited to the 3rd and 4th generation.  To many, this explained some congenital problems.  Why was a man born blind? He had inherited the curse put on an ancestor.  Interestingly, in genetics, there is usually a skip of the second generation, and a return in the 3rd and 4th.|`|AA10832514	We are punished for the sins of our fathers.

In this scripture God is showing that everyone that believes he has sight does not and every one who believes they are blind can actually see.  <br>  <br>  When the blind man first starts talking to Jesus, he calls him, a man, then he called him a prophet and finally he realized he was Jesus the Son of God.  Now, this was not confusing to the blind man or to Jesus, it was confusing to the Pharisees-they had their sight and still didn't recognize Jesus for who he was.|`|BxwkOa6Vaa	Jesus’ words showed that neither the man nor his parents were responsible for his congenital blindness. So Jesus gave no support to the idea that the man was being punished for sins committed in a previous life. True, Jesus knew that all humans inherit sin. But they inherit the sin of Adam, not sins they committed before they were born. Because of Adam’s sin, all humans are born physically imperfect, subject to sickness and death. (Job 14:4; Psalm 51:5; Romans 5:12; 9:11) In fact, that was a situation that Jesus had been sent to remedy. John the Baptizer said that Jesus was “the Lamb of God that takes away the sin of the world!”—John 1:29.<br>  <br>  Notice, too, that Jesus did not say that God had deliberately caused the man to be born blind so that Jesus could come along and heal him some day. What a cruel, cynical act that would have been! Would that have brought praise to God? No. Rather, the miraculous cure of the blind man served to ‘make manifest the works of God.’ Like the many other cures Jesus performed, it reflected God’s sincere love for suffering mankind and confirmed the trustworthiness of His promise to bring an end to all human sickness and suffering in His due time.—Isaiah 33:24.<br>  <br>  awsome question i really had to do reasearch on that one.|`|PS3NKPOEaa	In that culture people believed that a physical disability was because of sin.

This is in the Bible and true.  But this particular man was blind so Jesus could perform a miracle and it be witnessed. Jesus says this to them in the 3rd or 4th verse.

UxSF3Doaaa	I know what you mean by clique-y! I feel like an outsider at churches myself. I'm lucky to get hello and good-bye out of the parishioners...<br>  <br>  The best thing to do is read the Bible from cover to cover, though I recommend first reading the Book of Matthew, read the New Testament, and THEN begin the Old Testament. But if you want to begin Genesis, then read New Testament, that is ok as well. You might find it easier to start with Genesis since you don't have much knowledge on Jesus. <br>  <br>  You do NOT have to go to church in order to gain favor from God. Do it as personal preference or you feel a calling from God to go. <br>  <br>  Pray every single day to God, and before eating meals, give a thank-you prayer over the food you eat and ask for it to be blessed.<br>  <br>  It is important to read all of the Bible for yourself to guard yourself against many misinterpretations given by people. A lot of people tend to take the Bible out of context. And pray for guidance. People will tell you to only read King James Version of the Bible, but there is no harm in reading NIV ( New International Version). NIV is actually easier as it is plain English and is not written with lots of Latin ( such as Thou, Thine, etc.)<br>  <br>  If you want another person to help you on your journey, you can write me any time!<br>  <br>  Bless you!

One of the best ways to grow is to find believers who can help "water" the seed that has been planted.<br>  <br>  I do understand the difficulty involved in finding your "place" at a church.

Ideally, you would hope someone would take you under their wing... but obviously that doesn't happen as much as it used to.<br>  <br>  My suggestion... look in the church bulletin and either attend a youth group or bible study or call/email the church office or pastor and ask them how you can get involved. Joining a small group bible study or youth group is one of the best ways to finally get to know people and get plugged in. <br>  <br>  Don't give up.

This is an interdenominational program of people who want to start going to church, want to learn more about Jesus, but for many different reasons, need someplace to start.  You have questions, they are supportive, and they're there to work with you.  You'll be with other people, not attached to any particular denomination, who like you just want to know about Jesus.<br>  <br>  If there are no Alpha groups near you, to begin to build a relationship with God, I would recommend going to an Alcoholics Anonymous (AA) meeting.  Seriously.  Of any group I know of, AA groups are the least click-y and the most consistent in their relation to God.  Their theology is the most solidly inclusive I know of.  If you're going to start somewhere to build a relationship with God, an AA meeting is as good a place as any.  God will be at work there.<br>  <br>  Because some people have had problems with God in the past, they don't refer to God as God, but rather as a "higher power," or HP, but the belief is similar.<br>  <br>  If you're interested in either Alpha or AA, links are attached below.<br>  <br>  After Alpha or AA, I might suggest a church which regularly balances they dynamics of confession and forgiveness, word and sacrament, law and gospel, saint and sinner.<br>  <br>  Good luck and God be with you!|`|QrCqqqtDaa	Well you start building a relationship by hiring a contractor, then of course he or she will have their own construction crew, and then since god's invisible you'll have to ask your contractor to build you a secret holy spy radio so you can talk to him, but he probably will run out of minutes cause he spent all day on the toilet, vomiting out his genitals|`|8IHfytEvaa	Find a church which teaches the Alpha Course and attend.<br>  <br>  This link will help you find a class near you.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.alphausa.org/" rel="nofollow">http://www.alphausa.org/</a><br>  <br>  These two links will help you find a relationship with Jesus right now:<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.godlovestheworld.com/" rel="nofollow">http://www.godlovestheworld.com/</a><br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.wayofthemaster.com/" rel="nofollow">http://www.wayofthemaster.com/</a><br>  <br>  This link will answer some of your questions until you find the class:<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.allaboutgod.com/" rel="nofollow">http://www.allaboutgod.com/</a><br>  <br>  I will be happy to find a good Bible preaching and teaching church near you.

I have been to many churches were the people were not friendly... and I've been to churches that I wish I could keep going back.  I'm a Seventh-day Adventist Christian, but I've been to Catholic, Lutheran, Baptist, Methodist, and Non Denominational churches. No single denomination is friendly or unfriendly. It really depends on the church, to be honest. Keep trying a new church. Maybe try it one or two weeks in a row to be sure (I never give up after the first visit - one person can ruin it). From there, then you need to start looking at what the churches believe.  I think this is a process that go hand in hand - finding a church, and looking at each church's beliefs to see what you believe.<br>  <br>  God bless - He will lead you.

Then switched to a Pentecostal church where the Lord led me---this was after I had gone through a 5 year Bible study and some other changes----and I knew this was where I was supposed to be.<br>  <br>  Now, no church is perfect and every church gets refined too so we have problems there, but I DO believe the Pentecostals are closer to the perfect truth than any others, but not talking about the off-shoot churches such as "Jesus Only" churches because they have the god-head mixed up.

But there are dozens upon dozens upon dozens of Christian denominations. What I think you mean to ask is what is the best Christian denomination?<br>  <br>  Any Christian denomination that claims it is right and has the only right answers (which is at least half of them) and every one else is wrong is not a 'best' denomination. Among the more tolerate, loving and less condemning Christian denominations are Unitarians, Presbyterians, Episcopalians, Disciples Of Christ, etc.<br>  <br>  It is the fundamentalists who claim only they have the answer, only they have the ONLY way, only they hold the real truth.

All religions have rules, rituals and laws to follow. Every religion believes that they have the answers for redemption. The answer for redemption through religion, lies within man’s ability to perfectly follow it’s teachings which man can not do.  Jesus is the only one who followed religion perfectly.  <br>  <br>  Jesus is God’s way to reach down to mankind with love, forgiveness, acceptance and grace. Jesus is not a religion. He is God and He is the way for man to have fellowship with God. <br>  <br>  When we come to Jesus, we are full of the original sin nature and the sins that we have committed. He cleanses us when we accept Him as our Lord and Savior and repent of those sins. <br>  <br>  Our redemption and salvation results from Jesus’ willful and sacrificial death on the cross to take our place for our sin nature and our sins. He is the only atonement possible because He is without sin. Jesus does it for us because we are incapable of following any religion perfectly. He did follow the law perfectly.<br>  <br>  Coming to Jesus as our Lord and our Savior, not religion,  is what God requires for us to become forgiven, sanctified, and have the personal relationship with God that He intended from the start. Jesus is the only way to God.|`|zUMvC6QEaa	Do you mean what denomination of the religion of Christianity is the best?

The most important thing you should remember in choosing a religion is that you believe in their teachings, you are happy and comfortable with it and you feel that you belong to that religion. Above all, we must remember that we believe and worship one GOD.|`|XcFgJiN9aa	Find God. He will know you.|`|AA12230258	There is only one religion that adheres strictly to the Bible in all it's teachings. There is no dogma, doctrines or man made bibles in the true religion. Bible only! And this true religion encourages it's followers to read the Bible daily. <br>  <br>  The adherents are very loving, they get along with all their brothers and sisters all over the world, in fact, they would die for each other even though they have never seen each other before! The love they have for each other is greater than family love.   <br>  <br>  They are very meek and humble, just as you would expect out of a true Christian. And they would never do anything against the Bible or what the only true God would dislike. They do make mistakes at times but they truly repent and continue doing their best to give a reply to their God for Satan as brought out at Proverbs 27:11. (Proverbs 27:11) 11?Be wise, my son, and make my heart rejoice, that I may make a reply to him that is taunting me.<br>  <br>  Very tight knit group of brothers and sisters that can't be separated because of the love they have for each other. And they also love the people of this world knowing that anyone of them could be their future brother or sister! <br>  <br>  They are not afraid to use Gods name, in fact, that is their job! To teach people about God and His name and purpose for this world. We call it the "Good News of the Kingdom". (Matthew 24:14) 14?And this good news of the kingdom will be preached in all the inhabited earth for a witness to all the nations; and then the end will come.<br>  <br>  This end of this system is very near now. Not the end of this world, only this system of things. God has a very big purpose for this world so He would never destroy it. <br>  <br>  If you find a religion that is like this, (there is only one), then you have found the true religion. Hint; the true Gods name is Jehovah. <br>  <br>  Please invite my brother or sister in the next time we knock on your door and have a free home Bible study so you can make a knowledgeable decision for yourself. This is without a doubt the true religion.|`|aF4mFlJiaa	How to Identify the True Religion<br>    1. The true religion worships the only true God, Jehovah.—Deuteronomy 6:4,?5; Psalm 146:5-10; Matthew 22:37,?38.<br>    2. The true religion offers access to God by means of Christ Jesus.—John 17:3, 6-8; 1?Timothy 2:5,?6; 1?John 4:15.<br>    3. The true religion teaches and practices unselfish love.—John 13:34,?35; 1?Corinthians 13:1-8; 1?John 3:10-12.<br>    4. The true religion remains untainted by worldly politics and conflicts. It is neutral in time of war.—John 18:36; James 1:27.<br>    5. The true religion lets God be true by accepting the Bible as God’s Word.—Romans 3:3,?4; 2?Timothy 3:16,?17; 1?Thessalonians 2:13.<br>    6. The true religion does not condone war or personal violence.—Micah 4:2-4; Romans 12:17-21; Colossians 3:12-14.<br>    7. The true religion successfully unites people of every race, language, and tribe. It does not preach nationalism or hatred, but love.—Isaiah 2:2-4; Colossians 3:10,?11; Revelation 7:9,?10.<br>    8. The true religion advocates serving God, not for selfish gain or a salary, but out of love. It does not glorify men. It?glorifies God.—1?Peter 5:1-4; 1?Corinthians 9:18; Matthew 23:5-12.<br>    9. The true religion proclaims the Kingdom of God as man’s sure hope, not some political or social philosophy.—Mark 13:10; Acts 8:12; 28:23, 30,?31.<br>    10. The true religion teaches the truth regarding God’s purpose for man and the earth. It does not teach the religious lies of immortal soul and eternal torment in hell. It teaches that God is love.—Judges 16:30; Isaiah 45:12,?18; Matthew 5:5; 1?John 4:7-11; Revelation 20:13,?14.|`|cdpBdzZtaa	If you like polygamy go for FLDS or LDS<br>  (LDS same as FLDS but officially only one wife)<br>  If you like knocking doors try Jehovah’s Witness<br>  If bible says 1+1=3 and you agree with it ,you 'll like literalists(all denominations)<br>  Edit<br>  I forgot to add literalists == Fundamentalists aka fundies|`|AdFucadgaa	There is no such thing as perfect or good religion.

Whoever follows his ways the closest is the one  who God, if  you believe he is, will honor.<br>  <br>  4 And Jesus answered unto him saying, It is written, Man shall not live by bread alone, but by every word of God. <br>  <br>  Christ made it easy for us. He didn't say research all the Christian religions of the world and then figure out which is the best, he simply said<br>  <br>  "But seek ye first the kingdom of God and his righteousness, and all these things shall be added unto you."<br>  <br>  What you have to do is truly study the Bible and seek God. If you put forth a sincere effort to heed God's commandments and learn his word, he will definitely make himself known to you (this is exactly what Christ did). This requires a truly sincere effort on your part. If you aren't sincere you will be fooled by impostors and deceivers. Christ warned of this and so did his apostles. God searches the hearts and minds of individuals so he will know if you have truly put forth a sincere effort. <br>  <br>  2 Corinthians 11:3 (Darby Translation)<br>  <br>  "But I fear lest by any means, as the serpent deceived Eve by his craft, [so] your thoughts should be corrupted from simplicity as to the Christ." <br>  <br>  "Yes, and all who desire to live godly in Christ Jesus will suffer persecution. 13 But evil men and impostors will grow worse and worse, deceiving and being deceived." <br>  <br>  "For of this sort are those who creep into households and make captives of gullible women loaded down with sins, led away by various lusts, 7 always learning and never able to come to the knowledge of the truth."<br>  <br>  If any exploit their knowledge of the faith for financial gain turn away from them.<br>  <br>  One of the signs of Christs true followers is they will be heavily persecuted.<br>  "The disciple is not above his teacher, nor the bondman above his lord."

GPZUfFZ1aa	Never.  Odin gave his eye for wisdom, hung himself as a sacrifice from a tree for wisdom, and slept with a giantess to drink mead made from Kvasir's blood for wisdom.  He was the all-father of the Gods and of humanity, and had to guide the good forces of the world to safety, to lead them in battle at Ragnarok, and, ultimately, to die in glorious battle for them.  Such were the pressures and responsibilites laid upon him, that he needed to be as wise and intelligent as possible.  In a religious context this would be translated as a reason for any of the capricious or mossible mean things Odin did - he did them for the greater good, and knew what to do because he was supremely wise.<br>  <br>  Another reason he might not regret is like what was said before; that he had two ravens, Huginn and Muninn, who flew the full scope of the nine worlds each day and whispered in his ears each night all that they had seen, which made up for his lack of eye.|`|YXGdwwTJaa	No, but, as a god, Odin would still be able to see, find and know about all he wanted.

GOD desires to walk with you and talk with you and guide you and protect you and give you courage and wisdom to live your life.

He isn't exactly the sharpest knife in the drawer.|`|2DahzSWvaa	There were protesters.|`|86pzq89Xaa	aw hell, were the Phelps screaming outside the Oscars?|`|c6kr5PvRaa	Them crazies from the westboro baptist cult.
Iv4YHqnTaa	okay yes that is nasty!!!<br>  but i think if you keep having sex with your guy cousin, you will still have urges to do him again & again! Try having sex with a female, lol idk maybe you'll like it so much you wont want to have sex with your cousin. You should as well start weening off the gay porn.<br>  <br>  but stop having sex with your cousin!<br>  because it wont help or change anything...<br>  no matter how much you like it lol!|`|2ydF6OTAaa	Bro, If you are having sex w/ your guy cousin, you are not straight. Case closed.|`|DgsHQ47yaa	The answer is simple. You are sinful.|`|kNLi16C6aa	well if you believe in your church and priest, I understand your conumdrum. Of course you don't want to come out, because they will say you are a sinner.<br>  <br>  So don't tell them. It's obvious you are gay - you are having sex with a boy, and have said that women don't turn you on. In my opinion you are afraid of what your church says...hence why you are messed up. They are telling you it's wrong, but you know that you can't control the feeling, and hence your battle. you are realising that religion is lying.|`|iwYPv2dyaa	okay okay okay oh my okay....being gay is NOT a sin. it is how youre born, its genetic, it is who the person is.  it sounds like you are gay. you say you cant help it right? riiiiight? you only want a wife and kids to be "normal" and approved of.  if you only get an erection from guys, you are homosexual.  but dude, incest? people can help that.  you cousin?|`|MRvwEnB0aa	You seem to be going through a phase. Let yourself be yourself and stop trying to be what you think others want you to be. Self acceptance is a good thing. I don't believe in coming out: Why would any one ask for permission to be what they are? <br>  <br>  I would suggest that you write an online journal. Very private! don't share it with anyone  Ever. It should be your communication with yourself. It's value will depend on your keeping it private. I wish you well. Stop worrying and be happy with who you are.
ASCxIYd3aa	its not color its mind set. if you believe that you are stronger you will have will that is hard to brake. like when some one says he or she has heart. it doesnt matter how tall you are or short you are. its how storng mental you are not phyically. look at every fighting sport. short tough guys fighting against taller stronger guys in a different wieght class seem to have something to show. but if you have been told you are tougher and stronger then others you start to believe it and you dont let go of it. i am 6'5" 307 and i know some guys that are smaller and much tougher then me. its just mind set.|`|0hEafQS7aa	It would only make sense that Blacks/Mexicans would dominate athletically, they sure as hell suck at everything else such as academics, intellect, having wealth, etc.|`|Ps9eOIchaa	Well i hate this question because i am bi-racial,black and mexican,and i always get caught up in this mess.Those are just stereotypes.|`|a3ffZgRsaa	It actually is a fact that black people genetically tend to have slightly more dense muscle tissue and are slightly taller on average,<br>  im not sure on the Mexicans|`|8iJe2S2Daa	I will proudly join the blacks/Mexicans. HECK YES!!!!!!|`|sBdOzbx5aa	Never heard that one.|`|CZw2Gpbraa	its because blacks and mexicans are in more gangs|`|C9QQPROkaa	Is that what they say? this is news to me...|`|4Vmlf902aa	Idk, but it seems like it us against some of our long lost cousins (e.g. foreign blacks.) Well against some of them hmm hmmm Fresh Jeff!! I think people say we and Mexicans are tougher because some of us appear tougher.|`|Hb04EISQaa	If they can dodge my fists or outrun me then they are better.|`|ohUm00RYaa	You know how 9/11 made America tougher as a nation because we all pulled together in this terrorist attack.  Well Mexican and black people have been facing terrorism for the last 500 years.  Both were enslaved blacks stolen from their land and basically endured 100s of years of genocide and crimes against humanity.  You gotta be tough to survive slavery and segregation.  Mexicans had to survive Spanish invasions and American invasions.  Being a minority in America, surviving next to the white man is not easy|`|pfke6Jieaa	lol...yeah right. i have never seen a mexican or black stronger than me in this ghetto hood. they are all show offs. i seen a few who are working out in the gym and yes i would deffinitely say some are stronger than me. im only 6'3 ft and i tower, literally tower, over most mexicans. most middle easterns are bigger built and taller than mexicans.<br>  <br>  idk about blacks cuz i seen a lot of them close to my height. same with white ppl. so i would still say they wouldnt win in a fight against all non mexican and non blacks. and trust me NO ONE says that. but if i had to choose i would say blacks are bigger and taller than mexicans. so are white ppl for that matter and middle easterns. even asians are bigger than mexicans.|`|nCTh2y0Haa	generally speaking, blacks and mexicans are associated with lower socio-economic status. The convergence of low status and low income naturally, breeds agression. Pretty much anyone who grows up in a crappy environment is going to turn out that way. Just so happens that the black and Mexicans have the crappiest living conditions. It makes perfect sense.|`|MtweOtuLaa	Most people in this section are obsessed with race. Just like the people in R&S are obsessed with religion, and the people in the Politics section are obsessed with arguing with each other.
KR1FdEZgaa	my wife is muslim but don't have an answer for you. sorry, good luck.
eFB4mfWvaa	Cuba is one of the poorest countries in Latin America. Because of this, the children of Cuba have to find new ways to entertain themselves. Like their Dads, boys in Cuba love to play Baseball. However, in Cuba, street baseball is very popular. Here the children pick side and play a quick game of baseball in the street. Sometimes their Dads watch – and sometimes their Dads play their own game of baseball nearby. Anyway, playing baseball like this is a very cheap way to spend some very enjoyable time.<br>  <br>  Another sport that Cuban boys like to play is boxing. Cubans are very good boxers and have won many international prizes – including 27 Gold Medals at the Olympic Games (before Athens 2004)<br>  <br>  As Cuban girls do not usually like to box, they normally like to play another very popular and cheap game in Cuba- volleyball. Because volleyball is so popular in Cuba, many volleyball nets can be seen in places where you might think it is strange to have volleyball. This way, the children can practice their volleyball skills in the street, without having to pay and money for the fun!<br>  <br>  another pastime that Cuban school children like, which is popular all over Cuba, is to play and listen to music. Many of Cuba’s school children like to play the gutar, because so many people can play and usually it doesn’t cost then very much to learn how to play better.|`|da4zS4AOaa	Soccer|`|YGbz1V8naa	Baseball, Basketball.. I would say those are the top 2. Boxing is another, but it doesn't involve running around a lot. Basically, the same sports that are played here. (Soccer is more popular in South America.)|`|Vv9L7KeAaa	soccer, its like a god over there they play it all the time.

I wouldn't let dumb phrases like that make me mad, or hurt my feelings. No one should.  =)|`|Cpr6Ff5laa	i correct them, and it usually comes into an awkward moment, i don't like it when people use the word gay in place of stupid, retarded, bad, etc.<br>  <br>  i could care less if people called other people faggots, the same way no one cares if you say ******, white trash, chink, blah blah.<br>  <br>  if people ignore what i say, then i ignore them and don't talk to them anymore, if they can't get over something as simple as that, then i'm not going to bother to be their friend, or act nicely to them, and some people might say im overreacting but seriously, it just builds the hate against gays and is a constant reminder of how society thinks, and it would be a big step forward for the gay community people stopped doing that so commonly.<br>  <br>  walloftextomg <3|`|BlZ6vJOAaa	i say that sometimes .. i jsut can't help it but i don't mean to hurt anyone's feelings. is it that bad?|`|l8c2kTlvaa	my friends say it all of the time, I have tried saying things but they dont care. i've given up trying to get them to say stupid or something else cuz they won't change.|`|uZQIUeyvaa	like somrthing is really bad|`|bB3f4duZaa	I feel that what they are describing as being "so gay" is probably something that deserves to be called "so gay."  It is absolutely ridiculous that we have reached a point when we are attempting to compare homosexuals to actual ethnic groups.  Very sad!  They couldn't be farther from it.  Those commercial on television that you are referring to are completely asinine.|`|mptnpn9maa	First, let me say that the saying is totally inappropriate.

Z3E2zKPWaa	I think pretty much... every channel unless it states somewhere else.. can be considered white people channels with white people shows.. Because many t.v shows have casts with predominately white people. Of course, I don't think you could get away with naming a channel WET T.V like BET...But if you put some sort of culture into it...like Irish T.V or something..then it would work.. The only show that I know of that had openly called themselves a white show.. Was that skinhead show, on the public access channel, in Seattle...|`|cFSpYoDfaa	Even black colleges have some white people that attend.

Whites are still going to be the majority. Many hispanics are ethnically white. Non-latino whites are expected to be a plurality. That is, they will have the highest percentage, however the percent of the blacks, hispanics, asians, and natives ONCE ADDED TOGETHER will be higher. <br>  <br>  Plus, I doubt anything will change. Whites probably will control  most of the wealth of this country. And It will probably still be a predominantly christian country.|`|jdKTs3aHaa	Well if you guys want those things so badly go establish them instead of asking this question for the 1000th time.|`|MtweOtuLaa	Quit your b!tching already. This question has been asked 134204123059 times in this section. There is no such thing as an all black college, only historical black colleges, which allow whites.<br>  <br>  The NAACP allows white members. If you want an all white group, then join a WN group.<br>  <br>  Whites make up over 70% of the population, and will always play a large part in how the country is run.<br>  <br>  Why don't you answer me this: Why is it that if a black person is successful it's blamed on affirmative action? Double standards can go both ways, so cry me a river.|`|LQQAQDkIaa	For years the white people had all the shows on tv. There are still lots of shows With only white actors.

83275bbee3a48525b38d928f44cc193eaa	Since Anne Rice's vampires can not have sex (since theirs no blood in their veins), yes there was love that Louis spoke of for the other male (and female) vampires.  Since being gay is about who you love, not who you have sex with (otherwise you could not have "gay for pay" actors in porn movies, lol).  There are many people that have male-male sex and still go home to their families.  Anne Rice uses the 'under-tones' of their relationship to show familial (family) love (Claudia WAS their daughter, since they MADE her a vampire and she lived with the both of them).  Ms. Rice uses the vampires to speak about minorities and the problems they face, and that their love for each other lasts longer than for most straight characters/people in these stories.  Of course, by the end they usually try to kill each other or have to spend great amounts of time away from each other before they can see each other again.  Much like any relationship that last 80 years or more, like Louis and Lestats did.<br>  <br>  Vampires are 'safe' characters, since their fictional and people can use them safely to talk about minority rights (like the vampires in Charlaine Harris' True Blood series, where vampires are trying to get marriage and inheritance rights, and she compares it to what gay rights advocates are going through today, where they are trying to get marriage and other rights.|`|3523f36756465e7b9f965e70e6efcd0daa	Yeah, I love the movie and I definitely got the same hints you did.|`|oVeGMNsLaa	Yup.

lMH2cA1kaa	You can make computer to computer calls to China by using any Instant Messaging or internet chating services, like AOL's AIM or Microsoft's MSN.  <br>  <br>  If you want to make phone calls from your computer to regular phones in China, you need to use specialty services like Skype.<br>  <br>  The easiest way to call China is using IP phone cards. Typical rate is less than 2 cents per minutes, you can make the calls from any phones (wired or cell).|`|9IrdMFX7aa	You must load down Skype from the internet. Just type SKYPE in Google or Yahoo and you will find it. Follow then the instructions of SKYPE. The other person in China should have Skype too. But you can also dial a telephone number with SKYPE. I have it and use it to telephone with Japan. It works very well and is free of charge, if the other person uses a computer too.

So watch tv and order out.|`|LQQAQDkIaa	Fast food and drive thrus and super size me. We didn't have the obesity problem before this type of restaurant came along.|`|q6uyloYdaa	Many things factor into America's obesity problem.<br>  For example, in comparison to other countries, restaurant portions in America are HUGE. We always want to "clean our plate" when we eat, and when served a huge meal at a restaurant we feel the need to eat as much of it as possible. Sometimes I find myself full but it looks like I haven't eaten half of what I've been served.<br>  Also, there is an excess of food here that is just plain bad for you. Because of our busy lifestyles we have become more dependent on ready-to-eat or frozen food. All those foods have a lot of preservatives and whatnot. Not to mention our love of fast food. Another problem is how accessible food is, especially junk food and candy. Many stores, even those that don't specialize in food, have candy and soda at the registers as impulse buys.<br>  There are a lot of other food issues, but when combined with the increasingly sedentary lifestyle and high stress levels in Americans, the possibility of becoming obese gets greater and greater.|`|SLFt8eHEaa	I'm a European (a Brit to be exact) who has traveled extensively in the US and to me the two main reasons seem to be that Americans a) eat more and b) don't move as much.  <br>  <br>  Portion sizes in the US are a lot larger, particularly in restaurants.  For example, at home I can easily wolf down a 3 course meal, but in the US by the time I've eaten one main course I'm feeling sick through eating so much!  American food also tends to be carbohydrate heavy (e.g. fries with everything) and covered in fattening things such as cheese (not that I'm complaining!) whereas the food in Europe contains more vegetables and salad.<br>  <br>  Also, because the US is so big Americans tend to drive everywhere and so don't move around as much.  Towns and cities have enough room to spread out and so a car is needed to go from store to store.  I, on the other hand, don't even own a car as everything is so cramped here I can just walk to places or use public transport (which the US also doesn't have as much of, making a car even more important).|`|AA10715649	All the other answers are great, however they forgot to mention another key component to the obesity equation: we are LAZY.|`|DMkk2yuLaa	1. Diet - Americans eat more processed food will europeans eat more fresh food<br>  2.

T5DbLLgQaa	Actually, broadening one's language skills is a very broad concept, it can be done in more than one ways at the same time which is highly recommended. You can NOT become better ONLY in one area e.g. speaking, you MUST improve your skills in ALL dimensions of the language!<br>  <br>  Learning language well requires being as active as possible and making the learning fun for yourself. Taking lessons is always important, but equally important are these:<br>  <br>  1) Listen/watch: Listen to internet radio stations like BBC, watch TV shows in English (use only subtitles, NOT voice dubbing!), etc.<br>  <br>  2) Write/communicate: Try to find discussion forums from the web about things that you find interesting (music/various artists, hobbies, etc.) and start communicating there with other people using English. Start using instant messaging systems in case you find some new friends or start emailing them.<br>  <br>  3) Buy yourself a proper dictionary, and each time when you see a strange word that you do not understand, look it up.<br>  <br>  The main point in ANY language learning is to make it as fun as possible for yourself. Try to find topics that interest you, read online newspapers, listen to BBC/NBC and other radio stations online, if you find a discussion forum for e.g. your favourite hobby or your idols in music do participate there, etc. <br>  <br>  I'm sorry there is no easy way out with this, you must develop your skills in ALL these language "levels" or dimensions in order to reach better language skills!! <br>  <br>  Last but not least: NEVER EVER use ANY online translators, they are nothing but utter rubbish!!<br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|JtUuMdRKaa	talk to people you know in ONLY english... a lot... that will help, also, what nationality are you? russian? spanish? chinese?|`|be7153f78e74d32be993910224fe6aaeaa	Hi Hosein,<br>               Try to read newspapers and try to communicate with everyone in english whether it is correct or wrong, you keep on speaking in english itself.

There is no quick fix or quick way to learn, but I'll go over some good ways to study.<br>  <br>  1.) Practice. I know it seems overdone, but even a half-hour a day makes it so it's always on your mind and so you're constantly immersed in the language.<br>  <br>  2.) Go to some classes, online or otherwise. It might cost money, but it'll be well worth it. Learning on  your own is hard so you might want to try some classes. A place that has good free classes is www.edufire.com. This place has tutors for a small fee or classes that meet regularly and they're completely free!<br>  <br>  3.) Get some books. Language books are fantastic reference. Reading for pleasure in another language is a fun way to improve.<br>  <br>  4.) Watch and listen to some English broadcasts. A word of caution, sometimes people aren't always correct when they are speaking (ex: Ebonics) so do this with caution. You can't learn just from this and you have to be careful with your choices. This is probably good for chilling out after you've worked on some serious sources.<br>  <br>  5.) Another site I'd like to suggest is: <a href="http://lang-8.com/" rel="nofollow">http://lang-8.com/</a><br>  I swear I'm not selling out, but you can write little blogs about how you're doing in English and English speakers will correct it and explain it step by step. It's a nice group setting and amusing enough.<br>  <br>  6.) Try getting a penpal or a penfriend to help you practice. It doesn't have to literally be a penpal, but get a friend to e-mail for help. You can just get some casual help.|`|WzQ3O9Tzaa	take ESL classes.<br>  =D

In just half a year, I already had people mistaking me for a girl, and that was despite having a short guyish haircut and wearing really guyish clothes.<br>  <br>  I'm not sure if it's the same for all birth control pills, but Diane 35 has cyproterone acetate, which acts as a very very powerful anti-androgen. I have to agree that the estrogen content is way too low though. Also, it could be partially due to the fact that I was very young then.<br>  <br>  So, yes, it does work. Is it the best choice? No.

DfDss68haa	I wouldn't say offensive but it does get used incorrectly. <br>  <br>  1. It gets annoying when people use black and ghetto interchangeably. Like if they don't feel comfortable saying "two black guys" they will say "two ghetto guys". Even if the guys didn't look "ghetto". Also people use the word "urban" like this too. And ethnic. The word ethnic to describe non-white people is one of the most annoying PC inventions ever. Everyone has an ethnicity so why am I the only "ethnic urban" person in my class?<br>  <br>  2. I personally don't even like the word ghetto used as an adjective. A ghetto is a place, not an appearance or lifestyle.

You may be surprised how easy it is to  read and understand.|`|AA11402196	God choose to reveal Himself in the words of the prophets. You hear the words but what you believe is a different matter.<br>  <br>  The bible is a collection of scrolls (books). It is a religious writing, not history or science text. When it does discuss history, it refers to other books. It does not use the scientific method (observed knowledge) but relies on reveal knowledge.<br>  <br>  What makes the bible difficult to read is because it comes to us in translation: Old Testament is in Hebrew while the New Testament is in Greek. It is written in an Eastern style different from Western presentation.<br>  <br>  For example, God created the heavens and the earth. The earth became chaos. Genesis 1:1-2. The Universe (heavens and the earth) is different than the earth. Earth is where man is. It does not say that God created the Universe in seven days. It says God created the Universe and the earth became chaos (void). The word “heavens” is different than “heaven”: The heavens are a part of the Universe and heaven is where God is. Genesis written in Hebrew is the first of five books written by the prophet Moses.<br>  <br>  The bible does not prove the existence of God; it assumes it. The "stories" are directed to a particular audience. The story can be literal or symbolic. For example, Jesus told stores (parables) directed to Jews. Paul wrote mainly to the Gentiles (non Jews). One of Paul’s letters is directed to the Hebrews (Jews) where he explains how Jesus is the Messiah. Reading this letter without knowing Jewish beliefs would be very confusing.<br>  <br>  The worst way of reading the bible is sequential, starting with Genesis and ending with Revelations. The bible is not a sequential text. For example, the Gospel (Good News) is told by four authors. Some authors provide detail where other authors just mention it or not mention it at all. If you want a sequential presentation of the Gospels, you will need to look at Bible study books.<br>  <br>  Answer:<br>  1. The bible is many Eastern scrolls translated into a single Western presentation. It is the prophets who say it is the word of God, a God who is holy. The errors you observed are Western thought trying to understand an Eastern concept.<br>  <br>  2. The bible was written from 1500 BC to 100 AD. It is the basis of Western civilization: A blend of Greco Roman, Judeo Christian ideas.<br>  <br>  3. Man (mankind) has always been violent. History documents man inhumanity to man, but it also documents man humanity to man. The bible presents man as both.|`|azD1REoEaa	Hmm... then I guess you haven't looked deep enough..<br>  <br>  Let's take the "story" of Abraham and his test with God.<br>  Genesis 22 - If you read the story very carefully you will realize this is actually a depiction of what God would do to his *only* son Jesus.<br>  <br>  Psalm 22 - This is a picture of the crucifixion of Jesus Christ.  <br>  <br>  Read Exodus... you'll see God's salvation plan through the Passover Lamb... oh and by the way Christ was crucified on the Jewish passover... was that a coincidence?  <br>  <br>  Read the part in Numbers 20 where Moses strikes the rock with a rod and water comes out.  Do scripture with scripture comparison and you'll find God references Himself frequently as a "rock" and "water" is always symbolic of the gospel of living water.  A "rod" is always symbolic of judgment.    Through the crucifixion of Christ as he was judged for our sins the living water of life comes freely that we may drink and live.   <br>  <br>  Read Isaiah 53 this is a reference to Jesus Christ. <br>  <br>  The list can go on and on... <br>  <br>  Consider the fact that the Bible was made up of several different authors spanning many many centuries over diverse geographic areas I wouldn't just say that this is just an "ordinary book".   <br>  <br>  Before you call it a book of stories that can be made up by any man you should take a look deeper.|`|3YZPXcI2aa	Are you sure your not speaking with or about scientologists?

When you say "word of god" you must be referring to the five books of moses.

What is great in God's eyes is not necessarily great in the eyes of man. Who would you rather please?<br>  <br>  Here's a Biblical lesson that will save you years if not a lifetime of heartache and pain. It helps you to see the principle behind the scriptures teaching on it.  I see many adults today...even elderly people that still haven't figured this one out...as well as what will continue to happen to them if they decide not to take this lesson seriously. King Solomon as well as his Father David learned the hard way on this one. As your lawyer i would advise you not to learn the hard way too. No halfhearted study of the scripture will make you smart.

It doesn't necessarily reflect what religious standpoint you carry. If anything Christian's are held to a higher standard when it comes to violence.|`|a3ffZgRsaa	Dr Seusses books tell stories with great morals to them and we dont worship a feline fellow with a fine piece of headgear<br>  <br>  So i have no idea why people blow the bible out of porportion|`|QodGdcIiaa	Hey!!!<br>  I hope passionately that I, (I am a Catholic Christian), can provide an eensy weensy portion of clarity perhaps lol, as it is indeed a large query. <br>  <br>  We read our Lord's word to take delivery of not the factual points of the tales, but of the more profound gist of them. These aren't just any morals, though, they are religious ones. For example, upon reading the book the Songs of Songs, which has numerous sexual references, you may say "Now, why would this be included within a book people deem to be sacred?" BUT we do not read the Song of Songs for the sexual words, but for the underlying meaning: sex is a precious gift from God, and the passionate love humans have for one another mirrors the beautiful love our Lord has for us.8D<br>  <br>  Moreover, when reading, say, Psalm 51 you may say "oh, yeah, that's great, a psalm saying how sorry this guy is for his sins, WOO", but we must delve into the heart of the psalm and observe how we can apply it to our lives, which would be we can see that God is always ready to forgive us: always!<br>  <br>  God bless you dear friend :)?????

d9b59e7f0a1ad81e7ce2a771c6022a6caa	I didn't see your other question. I would have answered that absolute morals don't exist. Proper moral behavior always depends on a context. Take "Thou shall not kill" for example. Does it mean "not kill" or "not murder"? What about killing in self-defense, or in defense of your country? Perhaps we can agree that it definitely includes the law that we should never take an innocent life. But wait a minute -- your God supposedly did that many times when he did mass killings to punish a few wicked people. Do you approve of that? Why is it that your supposedly moral God does not follow absolute morals?<br>  <br>  I claim that even though I think that morals are context dependent, I am still more moral than the God of the Bible.|`|9yLTvbgraa	God is the reason we have morals.

To simplify it (though it may be too simple) anything that causes mankind to remain alive without causing unjust pain is good anything that hinders man's ability to survive or causes unjust pain is bad|`|wM7pprr1aa	You ask, essentially, "Without someone to tell us or show us what is right and what is wrong, how could we possibly know?" It turns out that "right and wrong", "good and bad", are concepts that are very simple to explain. In fact, they are nothing more than applied common sense. Let's look at why this is the case.<br>  <br>  Out of necessity, humans have developed as social beings. In order for us to survive and prosper, humans are forced to work together as a group, a community, a society. This has always been the case. (It makes no difference whether you believe in the 6-day creation story in Genesis, or if you are an ardent supporter of evolution. These statements are true in either case.)<br>  <br>  Imagine back to early humans living in caves or tents. Even in the simplest, most primitive culture, no human could ever survive on his or her own. Someone has to take care of the young, someone has to provide shelter, make clothes, get the food, provide protection from predators, etc. This is next to impossible for an individual to do. It becomes significantly easier if humans come together and share these tasks. When humans come together in a spirit of cooperation, we call that a community, or in a larger group, a society.<br>  <br>  When people do things that further the advancement of the society, or things that add to the general well-being of the group, those things are considered "good".<br>  <br>  But if someone goes rogue and starts to do things that harm other members of the group, this is considered "bad". Such a person will quickly find himself banished from the group (or worse). No one wants a person around who is adversely affecting other members of the group, either by harming them physically, or by stealing from them, or through other negative actions, because this impacts the ability of the entire group to survive.<br>  <br>  So to recap… "Good" things are those which help (or at least don't hurt) others in the society, and "Bad" things are those which hinder or hurt others in the society. Simple common sense. No god required.<br>  <br>  All cultures since the dawn of recorded history have had some form of "The Golden Rule". It generally goes something like this: "Treat others the way you would like to be treated." There is no magic involved here, and it heavily pre-dates Judeo-Christian traditions. That is because the moment that you realize that you need to cooperate with other members of society to survive, this "rule" becomes intuitively obvious.<br>  <br>  If someone is mean or hurtful to you, you are not going to be inclined to be helpful to that person in any way. It makes sense then to assume that if you are mean or hurtful to them, they are not going to help you either. Again, no magic, no great mystery… just common sense. If I do something that benefits you (regardless of whether or not it also benefits me), there is a good chance that you will someday return the favor by doing something that benefits me.|`|3e79e4e27e450434486727dbc73eaaedaa	also consider this, many people say God exists, and this is because we know he exists.  But if God does not exist then that would be a lie to say or think he exists.  Therefore if God did not exist then there would be necessarily much more sin in the world, since billions of people profess in their heart that God exists.  Therefore if God exists there is necessarily less sin in the world than the atheist thinks.  But the atheist may not understand about sin.  But even an atheist will say that sin is defined acording to social norms.|`|2jwWYKbQaa	Right and wrong are arbitrary.  They're a result of society.<br>  <br>  And you don't kill me because doing so would end my existence indefinitely, which would really piss me off.|`|69750f25faea5e6021c54c23d0dcb774aa	If you kill me, you will go to prison.

ICGxM45qaa	Nicely put. How about the one that says that America was founded as a Christian nation... never mind that Thomas Jefferson and Benjamin Franklin (among other "forefathers") were against organized religion, and Jefferson even went so far as to say that the christian bible had corrupted the teachings of Jesus Christ (which I totally agree with). He even cut out the corrupted parts and created his own bible, removing references to Jesus being divine, and simply laying out the philosophy of Jesus... he even ended it with the stone being rolled across the tomb of Jesus, and removed the resurrection (which was added in by fanatics long after the death of Jesus... just as many of the stories in the bible were, including the divinity of Christ). Thomas Jefferson was a brilliant man. <a href="http://www.angelfire.com/co/JeffersonBible/" rel="nofollow">http://www.angelfire.com/co/JeffersonBib...</a>|`|69750f25faea5e6021c54c23d0dcb774aa	Well said!|`|aHEwm3QLaa	Well said. a star for you<br>  <br>  Also, don't forget the "Evolution says we come from monkeys"|`|SbN2cXE5aa	Something very similar has happened regarding Canada and putting preacher in jail.<br>  <br>  But there is a lot of rhetoric on both sides of issues, which causes confusion.<br>  <br>  By the way, I don't have a "Spokesperson".

Links por favor?|`|M35SoYqiaa	I don't doubt that people are passing along sloppy renditions of factual stories. <br>  <br>  A pastor in Alberta, Canada was fined $7000 and ordered to cease publishing his views on homosexuality in any public forum (he had written a letter to the editor of a newspaper). <br>  <br>  There is real concern that FOCA will overturn protections for Catholic hospitals that are unwilling to provide abortions, and some bishops have argued that this might make it necessary to shut down obstetric care, or shut down some hospitals entirely. <br>  <br>  There was real concern that if Prop 8 failed, churches that did not sanction same sex marriage would be charged with discrimination. A Methodist camp in New Jersey was successfully sued for discrimination because they would not rent a worship area to a couple for a same sex wedding. <br>  <br>  I don't think the positions you mention are blatant lies, but legitimate concerns expressed as facts rather than possibilities. If I say that you will have a car crash if you drink and drive, I am technically lying. My concern about drinking and driving is perfectly legitimate, and it would be best if I said you are much more likely to be in a wreck. Still, even if I said you will get in a wreck, iit would not be reasonable to say I am blatantly lying.

If you're pregnant, menstruating, or ovulating you could be hypersensitive to smells.|`|N90bGLmYaa	I guess its all about pheromones. It is chemical compound, produced and secreted by an animal (or humans), that influences the behavior and development of other members of the same species.<br>  <br>  Maybe you're attracted to them or something because of these chemicals, which you can smell. But still can't explain though.<br>  <br>  I watched something concerning about pheromones, they say that, members of the same family have the same composition of pheromones. Therefore, if you are blindfolded and you are said to smell 5 cottons with sweat of 5 different people, and one is one of your family member (ex. your brother), you can easily point out which cotton has your brothers pheromones.<br>  <br>  In the animal kingdom, animals use these pheromones to attract mates or look for them.

aT1wujIKaa	Hola<br>  <br>  Las primeras religiones adoraban a diosas y eran fuertemente femeninas. Los hombres primitivos percibían que las mujeres podían crear la vida (dar a luz) y el hombre no y embrujar a un hombre (enamorarlo y cambiarlo) y el hombre no. De esa forma hubo una tendencia a la busqueda de diosas y a una sociedad principalmente matriarcal.<br>  <br>  En algún momento de la historia de la humanidad, ésta pasó a asentarse en lugares fijos y evitar la vida nomada. Hubo entonces un cambio del esquema matriarcal al patriarcal.<br>  <br>  Este cambió se dió en todos los ambitos de la vida humana: lo social, lo laboral, lo economico y lo religioso. El paso de la vida matriarcal a la vida patriarcal ocurrió simultaneamente y acabó con las diosas.<br>  <br>  Un ejemplo de esto se puede ver en la mitologia griega donde la diosa Gea (la madre Tierra) era la creadora y madre de todas pero conforme la sociedad avanzaba al estilo patriarcal, su lugar fue ocupado por Zeus, que era masculino, quedando relegada sólo a una figura historica de origen.<br>  <br>  En la mayoria de las sociedades se atacó a las brujas y curanderas, y se consideraron impuras a las mujeres. El patriarcado discriminó a la mujer y favoreció al hombre. Creo sociedades dictatoriales altamente jerarquicas (piramidales) donde el hombre era el centro de todo y uno de ellos (solo uno) era el jefe máximo.<br>  <br>  Las religiones copiaron ese mismo esquema y por eso ves que las principales religiones son machistas.<br>  <br>  Sin embargo, notaras que muchos cultos primitivos, aun existentes, como algunos cultos animistas americanos, aún adoran a diosas.<br>  <br>  Espero te sirva mi respuesta, no olvides elegir la mejor respuesta.<br>  <br>  Por favor, si me puedes ayudar con esta pregunta que tiene algo de similitud con la tuya, gracias.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://es.answers.yahoo.com/question/index;_ylt=Aprmhl4xDSYc2_xJiLieZIRo.gt.?qid=20070609113855AATZmgc">http://es.answers.yahoo.com/question/ind...</a><br>  <br>  Saludos.|`|07d3f507edac45c4127215d24a968d2aaa	Yo pienso que no son machistas.|`|2956480fc931d653d501bde4608e37d7aa	Yo creo que es porque toda las religiones son fuente de la mente humana. Dios es uno solo, y las diferentes culturas inventaron un culto para ese dios. El tema es que como la mayoria de las culturas fueron (y son) machistas (por un tema de la preponderancia fisica), las religiones q surgieron de esas culturas fueron su reflejo (te imaginarias una religion feminista en una cultura no matriarcal??? nunca funcionaria). <br>  De todas maneras, en el hinduismo, por ejemplo, existe un respeto mucho mayor hacia la mujer q en todas las derivadas de la cultura judeo-cristiana.|`|c91af8c1227bb6775261899f83b5e43caa	Creo que sí son machistas, y es debido a una "evolución cultural" del ser humano.<br>  <br>  Lo podemos notar si miramos restos arqueológicos de antiguas culturas en las que existía una "diosa madre", un matriarcado o sacerdotizas, como fue Creta antigua o culturas a las que llamamos "no evolucionadas" o "incivilizadas" como los aborígenes australianos o las tribus amazónicas.<br>  <br>  Me parece que para este caso vale la pena un buen derrame de tinta para una tesis doctoral en antropología, ?no crees?|`|0SWssbteaa	No son Machistas, simplemente obedecen la ley de Dios.|`|1FHM9v9aaa	No es así, en la religión católica el personaje "humano" más importante es María la madre de Cristo.

Continua siendo el pais que se identifica por su musica, sus mariachis y donde deben mejorar es en las telenovelas, las que llegan a Colombia son muy tragicas y bajo el mismo esquema, ya casi no se ven, creo que es falta de libretistas.<br>  Es un pais que se prefiere para el turista por sus bellezas naturales (Playas) y arquitectonicas.|`|418a9d1a9f7473838e3d94e8e4920d9eaa	Como un buen latino me ha preocupado por conocer más sobre nuestra cultura y me he formado la siguiente impresión sobre México:<br>  Un "estado social de derecho" en el que se establecen "al menos en el papel" todos los derechos y garantías para su población, sin embargo sus gobernantes se han encargado de mostrar al mundo una imágen de un país corrupto en donde todo se maneja a base de coimas y algo más grave aún es el hecho de que si no estas alineado a la política de EUA te quedas en la pobreza o peor aún en la miseria. <br>  México un estado con una población bastante machista, en donde se valora más lo que tienes que lo que eres. Es por ello que cientos de miles de cuidadanos Mexicanos cruzan el charco para ir a servir a los gringos, obteniendo como resultado de esto la mayor comunidad extranjera en EUA.<br>  Actualmente con la firma del tratado de libre comercio con gringolandia la miseria se ha agudizado, han `proliferado las empresas gringas en la frontera (del lado mexicano) en donde se paga sueldos de perro y no se respetan los mínimos derechos fundamentales de los/as trabajadores. Si esa misma empresa estuviera del lado gringo a sus empleados les tuvieran que pagar cinco o hasta quince veces más, pero como está en México hacen lo que les da la gana y con el tratado pasan sus productos al lado gringo sin tener que pagar ningún impuesto, para después vender esos productos hechos en México con etiqueta gringa en el resto del mundo y a precios exorbitantes.<br>  En cuanto a la situación política es un país muy conflictivo en donde las mafias económicas que siempre han dominado al país siguen predominando a pesar de que la mayoría de la población que se desenvuelve en la pobraza y miseria busca un cambio de ese sistema opresor.<br>  En este sentido es hora de que quienes tienen la posibilidad de hacer escuchar la voz de alerta lo hagan y rompan las cadenas del yugo cómplice del imperialismo gringo.<br>  En otro aspecto, México se ha encargado de difundir su cultura al mundo y tiene representantes (especialmente en el ámbito del cine y la música) que han plasmado su nacionalismo en todo el mundo, así como la política de que sus programas (especialmente novelas) muestren la cara turística del país lo que ha serrvido como promoción mundial.<br>  Un aspecto que me olvidaba es el hecho de que se presenta tu país como un espacio con dos caras la de la opulencia (concentrada en unas pocas familias) y la de la pobreza (concentrada en la mayoría de la población), sin embargo hay una muy grande cantidad de personas que por el temor al que dirá aparentan que están bien y que su situación es muy buena.<br>  Habran los ojos y desen cuenta que no tiene casi ni agua para consumir y sigen ampliando la frontera habitacional.<br>  Si no fuera por los campesinos/as e indígenas no tuvieran los alimentos necesarios y vivieran de Konfleks en ves de maíz.<br>  <br>  <br>  Bueno, espero que te sirva de algo estos peque?os aportes de lo que percibo de tu país, no sin antes decirte que también se caracterizan por tener hermosas mujeres que los/as representan muy bien.<br>  <br>  Salu2|`|5bQFw0cDaa	Yo soy de Espa?a, y tengo dos imágenes diferentes de mexico.

De pobreza y barrios marginados, de mafias y corrupción policial, incluso de peligro.. Supongo que esta idea nos viene dada por las películas o noticias que vemos aqui. Un lugar donde hay gente muy rica, y gente muy pobre. poco término medio. Y como ciudades, grandes ciudades llenas de desarrollo y otras más marginadas con istalaciones menos apropiadas o menor desarrollo. Donde el poder lo llevan unos pocos y tampoco permiten una igualdad medio decente.

Debes tener en cuenta que para Argentina era el famoso 1 a 1 y entonces pudimos realizarlo.<br>  Yo que soy amante de los coloridos, y las decoraciones mejicanas quedé encantada con aquel bonito lugar. Y no solo las playas o los paisajes, la gente fue cordial en todas partes, creo que las mujeres se desesperan por los ni?os, y al decirles que eramos de Argentina (oh! sorpresa) les parecía genial! o muy padre como dicen Uds. La verdad es que resultaron personas simpáticas y amables, muy educadas. Y en lo personal, si bien viajé con mi hijo que era casi un bebé en ese momento. Fui con él en su carrito  a todos los sitios que pude, conocí playitas, saqué hermosas fotos de los atardeceres de Vallarta y lo poco que pude ver de Mexico DF me pareció que tenía un viaje pendiente para el futuro. Mucha arquitectura y mucha capital para conocer. Hay muchas cosas que me gustaría ver además de haber estado en la playa. Por ejemplo las pirámides sería fantástico. Quizás porque me gusta lo precolombino , ya que hago cerámicas, me identifican estos países en los que puedo encontrar piezas maravillosas para ver en museos y que se relacionan con lo que me gusta hacer creo que tu país es muy bonito para visitar.<br>  Y en particular creo que tenemos algunas cosas en común aunque Uds. estén más cerca de los del Norte que nosotros, las economías pueden parecerse, la influencia yanqui está cercana, las clases sociales se ven diferenciadas, pero sí creo que las chicas se maquillan un poco más que las argentinas.

Para muchos intelectuales (si los podemos llamar así) y economistas, la relación Méjico-EE.UU ha provocado cambios radicales en la cultura y la estructura social y económica del país. Esto se acentuó en los últimos 50 a?os y fue creciendo en las últimas dos décadas. El NAFTA o como se conoce, el Tratado de Libre Comercio de América del Norte, no cumplió las expectativas que los mejicanos esperaban y pobreza crece y se profundiza.<br>  Culturalmente Méjico esta perdiendo paulatinamente su identidad y orígenes con la masiva y continua emigración, legal e ilegal, a los Estados Unidos.

I didn't know what was going on. He shows up and then they show up and Tim says this is Donna and she says get in the car we're leaving and they go.  The thing is that Tim was one of my best friends and he always came to my house and was Uncle Tim to my children. And Wade was a 19 year old new to the Navy and when he got there with his wife they had nothing!  I gave them money, made dinners for them, showed her around, helped them get furniture, stuff like that.  All that mess that they did was so unnecessary because all Tim had to do was be a man and tell me that I couldn't come to his wedding. That's all it would have taken! After 2 years of being close friends this is what they decide is the best way to exclude me from the wedding. It's stupid!!  To this day I STILL can't understand why in the world they felt they had to play such childish games.  I don't have "friends" anymore and I don't associate with people like I used to either. I loved them and they hurt me by doing this and I haven't gotten over it.

I have had situations in my life that because of them, I chose to hate or be angry at someone.  However, my Lord has told me to forgive others just as He has forgiven me.  I chose to forgive.  <br>  <br>  Forgiveness is not an emotion it is a decision.  There is not one of us who hasn't hurt someone else during our life time.  This is why we have to forgive.  <br>  <br>  Forgiving does not mean allowing someone to continue to hurt or disrespect you.   If this is the case, you must remove yourself from that person's presence.  Forgiving is to give the problem over to God and then let Him deal with it.|`|3bcdf0a60ffd55ea93005bd68dbdb3eaaa	my mom says dont do drugs too bad your didnt tell you that|`|039863412b2033f40a328e6c2ae2dc51aa	I was struggling, praying and fasting all day with words and actions of some of the people of God against me.

First of all you need to build a relationship with God, not worry about what others are doing or not doing, if you want to have faith and a relationship with God then you need to get to know God, not the people who profess to live by God's word, but don't, it's your relationship that matters not theirs, if you are looking to them no wonder your faith is  suffering! Concentrate on building your relationship, with God you cannot change theirs only yours, by getting to know him through his Word the Bible that way you will build faith too, not only that if you get to know God  by learning what the Bible says about these things you will also know when a church is teaching from the Bible and when it is not. Then you can select a place to worship God in the way you need to in truth and in spirit(John4:24)24God is spirit, and his worshipers must worship in spirit and in truth." And remember to aply that verse first to yourself as each of us should get to know God's way and then aply it to ourselves, so our learning is not in vain, as Jesus shows in what he says in (John17:3) it is important to learn the truth from the Bible!Our life depends on it! 3Now this is eternal life: that they may know you, the only true God, and Jesus Christ, whom you have sent.|`|AA12044219	I am sorry you are experiencing these things. If you read Hebrews 12:2 its says, "Fixing our eyes on Jesus, the author and perfecter of our faith..... you must understand that if we keep our eyes on man we will be disappointed every time. We are still just people and we do human things. We will NEVER be perfect. If we were to be perfect then the Bible would not say this.....Philippians 1:6 For I am confident of this very thing, that He who began a good work in you will perfect it until the day of Christ Jesus. That means this perfection is always happening until His return. So the only thing there is to do is pray for them and if God tells you to....kindly tell them that this is not a good christian witness with what they are doing. Also there is this: Matthew 16:23 Get behind Me satan! You are a stumbling block to Me; for you are not setting your mind on God's interests, but man's.

You are judging an infallible God by the actions of totally fallible people.  Hypocracy can be a difficult thing to have to witness in a church, but this is not the fault of God - this is the fault of God fearing people who are making really really stupid choices and have been dealt easy hands in life.<br>  <br>  When Jesus was alive and walking around amongst people...  He didn't hang out with the normal people, or the rich people, or the people that basically considered themselves "squirrels trying to get a nut" (to use a figurative phrase that I have only a VAGUE IDEA really means).  He hung out with prostitutes.  He hung out with the peoplewhose limbs were literally FALLING OFF from Leprosey.  He went for the demon posessed.  He went for the opressed.  He went for the lowliest of the lowliest of the low.  He reached into the nastiest cesspools of sin he could find, and he went STRAIGHT FOR THE CROWD HANGING OUT AT THE BOTTOM OF THE BARREL.  People look at church as a place to practice holiness before God.  While it is that, it is also a hospital for lost, sick, weak souls.  You must bear this in mind before you judge the people there...  and you must also bear in mind the parable of the dude with the sliver in his eye...  should you not take the LOG out of your OWN EYE so you can better see to help with the other person's sliver?...  Maybe it's time to go throw your resume around and do something a little more proactive about your situation BEFORE you consider volunteering at the church?...  With all due respect, there's something to be said about prioritizing things...  Perhaps securing an income is more important than volunteering with the church?...  Just a thought.|`|gKwKxJyNaa	I have found out a while ago that the church is not a good way to find your faith....you see I love God I do, but the people around me blinded me from him.

I felt this same way until i found a serious Bible study group. Then it seemed God was pleased i started taking his word seriously and he led me to greener pastures. <br>  <br>  After studying with the Southern Baptists and the Catholics and feeling the same way you do i tried one day (against my better judgment at the time) studying with a few of the Witnesses and since then i have come to understand the Bible significantly better. <b>One thing that's important to remember is that Christ spent almost all his time (King David as well) studying the scriptures</b>. If we are not putting forth a great effort to please God, by following Christs example, and constantly studying the scriptures.. we will have extreme difficulty understanding what God is trying to do for us in our lives.

Whatever goes on with the other people there should not concern you.  You are not there to judge people.  That is Gods job.  If this church is not giving what you Spiritually need.  Then please try another church.  God loves even the sinners.  I hope you read your bible daily, pray every chance you get.  You will receive an answer.  Please do not give up on God. I will pray that you will find peace within.  The others have to answer to God for their wrong doings as you and I will also.  God will test you.  I am sure you have heard of trials and tribulations.  You are having those right now and you are doubting your faith.  May God Bless you|`|WEM5n41Oaa	I don't go to church.  If there was a church that really loved me I would go.  If I were you I would quit going to church or find another one.  You don't haft to go to church to follow Jesus.  I understand where your coming from.  Pray for the people of your church.  I continually lose faith.  In order to gain faith you need to go on level deeper in losing it.  This will ultimately strengthen your faith.  Maybe you should keep going to church and just forgive everyone and not judge them.  I have something that will help you to believe even more!  Check this out.  It's got 9 parts so watch them all.  This will help your faith.|`|ZKQgAtBsaa	This is happening to you because you are judging God by the people that go to your church.  I used to do this to, and it is pretty impossible to have a good relationship with God when you base your relationship with Him off of people from your church.  Focus more on YOUR relationship with God and not on the hypocrites that claim to know Him.<br>  <br>  And about the ministry thing.  Maybe you should reasses your motivation for trying to do this.  Are you sure that you are doing it for the right reasons?  It sounds a bit like you are doing it less for the purpose of helping people get to know Christ and more for the purpose of getting people to take you seriously.|`|b22d33b389f66522a42da38105df85caaa	Sounds like you need to find another church to go to.

Right there is an example that you have outgrown this particular group. <br>  <br>  Honey, you ARE on the right path. It just might take a while for it to become clearer for you.

4639b9c1654459c89d2b4ce640b7444eaa	La filosofía es la disciplina que responde sobre los grandes problemas del mundo. Su origen. El ser. La consciencia. Sin un marco filosófico adecuado no hay pensamiento científico certero.<br>  La filosofía permite una cosmovisión desde donde entender y preguntarte sobre temas particulares que luego desarrollan las ciencias particulares.<br>  También a la filosofía se la considera como una ciencia, algunos la llaman la madre de todas las ciencias.<br>  <br>  No hay de qué. Un beso y arriba con esas tareas.|`|175a76c9e371848e51e6eaff5764f33baa	ya con lo q te puso nicolas tienes...<br>   jajaja|`|50fc5485957aa94cdca63dec714d2a7eaa	Difícil coincidir con Leibniz: no vivimos, aunque nos duela, en el mejor de los mundos posibles. Por momentos, los males parecen multiplicarse al infinito: junto al eclipse de los valores tradicionales de la civilización occidental y el desquicio de las instituciones a ellos vinculadas (familia, organizaciones intermedias, Estado), junto a la virtual desaparición de ejemplos de vida rectores, vemos proliferar un sinnúmero de fenómenos inquietantes como la avidez de dinero, el consumismo, la búsqueda de goce a cualquier precio y sin importar qué, la profundización de las desigualdades económicas y sociales, la degradación de la salud pública y la educación formal, la desocupación, la delincuencia, la drogadicción, la inseguridad, la corrupción, la banalización de la cultura, promovida por el complejo tejido de las industrias culturales y los poderosos medios de difusión masiva… La lista amenaza hacerse interminable, aun sin computar el terrorismo y la guerra, con sus terribles secuelas, que conmueven hasta sus fibras más íntimas la vida de los pueblos.<br>  <br>   <br>  <br>  Panorama problemático y sombrío, con más razón cuando la mirada se instituye desde los márgenes, como en nuestro caso, argentinos y latinoamericanos, sin rumbo claro y agobiados además por una cuantiosa deuda externa, fruto de administraciones torpes e irresponsables, por no decir algo peor.<br>  <br>   <br>  <br>  La cuestión es: ?qué papel cabe a la filosofía en semejante contexto? O mejor aún: ?le corresponde todavía alguno o ella, como tantas otras cosas, pertenece definitivamente al pasado? Preguntas que, me apresuro a decirlo, no admiten una respuesta única.<br>  <br>   <br>  <br>  De hecho, muchos se desentienden de ellas, jamás interfieren su trayectoria. Tradicionalmente, la filosofía se desenvolvió en fuerte compromiso con el mundo en el cual se hallaba inserta, con el mundo que la vio nacer. La figura de Sócrates es aquí referencia inexcusable. Pero desde que Hegel inventó la historia de la filosofía, es decir, identificó la filosofía con su devenir histórico, y desde que la ense?anza de la filosofía se convirtió en una profesión, sostenida y avalada por el Estado; en una palabra, desde que surge el moderno profesor de filosofía, se tienden las vías para un radical descompromiso de la filosofía con la época, que autoriza a ignorar las preguntas formuladas más arriba. Sumemos al profesor de filosofía un espécimen también relativamente reciente, que le está emparentado: el especialista en filosofía, consagrado a la exégesis de un pensador, una escuela, una época; tampoco cae sobre él la exigencia de pronunciarse sobre los tiempos en que le toca vivir; su menester se asemeja al de un microscopista, indiferente a todo cuanto exceda el objeto de sus desvelos.<br>  <br>   <br>  <br>  Podría argüirse que el profesor de filosofía al uso y el especialista no son filósofos y nada más cierto que no lo son; tan cierto como que hoy por hoy ejercen un dominio abrumador en el ámbito de la actividad filosófica, entorpeciendo las tareas más propias de la filosofía.<br>  <br>   <br>  <br>  Pero volvamos a nuestras preguntas. Descontando al profesor de filosofía y al especialista, ?hay todavía filosofía?, ?hay todavía filósofos? Pues nada garantiza la inmortalidad de lo grande. Sin embargo, en este aspecto soy optimista. Creo que existen aún filósofos, en el más genuino sentido de la palabra y, por ende, filosofía. Tal vez no se trate ya –seguramente no- de los majestuosos edificios especulativos del pasado; sabemos que actualmente no nos es dado construir sistemas filosóficos análogos a los de Spinoza, Leibniz, Hegel. Tal vez las meditaciones filosóficas actuales estén demasiado lastradas por permanentes alusiones a la historia de la filosofía, deban hacer gala de cierto espacialismo; no obstante, con dificultad, algunos pensamientos originales se abren paso, imprimen su huella en el desierto. Y donde hay filosofía la palabra sobre el mundo que nos concierne se pronuncia inexorablemente.<br>  <br>   <br>  <br>  Ahora bien: una vez convenida su existencia, ?qué peso cabe atribuir al discurso filosófico en el mundo que habitamos? No nos entusiasmemos con carreras de grado y posgrados, facultades e institutos de formación superior, reuniones académicas, jornadas, seminarios, simposios y congresos; en fin, cofradías de profesores y especialistas donde –amén de repeticiones y exégesis- algunas afirmaciones filosóficas parecen cobrar densa corporeidad. ?Qué incidencia tiene el discurso filosófico en el curso del mundo actual, cuál es su capacidad rectificadora o proyectiva, cómo y cuánto influye en los decididores, si los hay, en la vida cotidiana de las personas, en la formulación de los problemas y las presuntas soluciones? Siendo realista, poco y nada. La agenda se redacta sin consultar a la filosofía.<br>  <br>   <br>  <br>  Adivino las objeciones. Pues, en verdad, ?cuándo la filosofía ha incidido en forma directa e inmediata sobre su entorno más próximo? Como ha ense?ado Heidegger, la influencia de la filosofía es siempre mediata y opera a través de rodeos y en forma imprevisible. No importa el retardo, la oblicuidad; ya hará sentir sus efectos y éstos serán decisivos, a no dudarlo. ?Verdad axiomática o, por el contrario, pobre ilusión de filósofo, dilacerado por la contradicción entre la potencia de su pensamiento y su impotencia efectiva? Sea como fuere, la filosofía ha conocido en este sentido épocas más felices; basta recordar el influjo del estoicismo en el Imperio Romano o el de  la filosofía de la Ilustración en la Europa moderna, para no ir más lejos.<br>  <br>   <br>  <br>  No me parece desatinado sostener que a principios del siglo XXI la incidencia de la filosofía en el rumbo de las cosas está en su punto más bajo desde el despuntar de la modernidad europea. Esto responde sin duda a múltiples factores, algunos de los cuales han sido explicitados, pero en su conjunto muy difíciles de pensar.<br>  <br>   <br>  <br>  Filosofía existe pero pesa poco. ?Contribuirá en alguna medida a labrar la insignificancia actual de la filosofía la fuerte propensión al discurso crítico de llamativa parte de la filosofía contemporánea?<br>  <br>   <br>  <br>  Sería necio negar la inherencia del componente crítico al discurso filosófico tradicional. La filosofía ha ejercido la crítica, en variadas proporciones, desde sus más tempranos orígenes. Crítica a las tradiciones, a las creencias, a los usos y costumbres, al saber establecido, a los sistemas políticos y sociales, a la religión y al arte imperantes. Aunque aplicada en diferentes dosis, la crítica tuvo regularmente en el campo filosófico la función de despejar el terreno para proponer  una positividad superior. A partir de tendencias verificables en su circunstancia, la filosofía ha ofrecido, una y otra vez, alternativas, inexploradas y atrayentes posibilidades de pensamiento y de vida. En ocasiones, para pocos; en otras, para todos; no es eso lo que aquí importa. Importa sí que nunca se ha visto, creo yo, semejante condena global del presente por parte de la filosofía, tan furioso encono con el orden vigente como leemos hoy en considerable porción del discurso filosófico contemporáneo.<br>  <br>   <br>  <br>  Conservadora o progresista, crítica acerba e impiadosa e incapacidad casi plena para generar propuestas, salvo la exaltación nostálgica de algún pasado presuntamente idílico, producto adulterado de la falaz memoria, o un candoroso utopismo futurista desamarrado de las tendencias del presente. ?Exacerbación paródica de  las tentaciones trasmundanas de la filosofía tradicional, ante el bochornoso fracaso de los intentos de realización intramundana de lo Absoluto? En suma, una suerte de romanticismo posmoderno vicia de raíz gran parte de la discreta producción filosófica de nuestros días.<br>  <br>   <br>  <br>  Preguntábamos: ?qué pasa con la crítica?, ?cuál es su papel en la sociedad contemporánea? Más determinadamente, ?cuál es hoy la efectividad de la crítica, su capacidad transformadora?<br>  <br>   <br>  <br>  Filosófico o no, el pensamiento crítico tiene una historia que reconoce un punto decisivo de inflexión con el advenimiento del pensamiento ilustrado. Mientras los valores, las ideas y las instituciones del “antiguo régimen”, en sentido lato, mantuvieron su vigencia, el pensamiento crítico fue un arma temible en manos de la intelectualidad ilustrada. Nada del viejo orden atinó a mantenerse en pie ante los arrasadores embates del formidable poder de la negatividad. Pero esto es ya historia antigua. Desde hace mucho el “sistema”, si así queremos llamar a la realidad vigente, utilizando un término afecto a la declinante racionalidad marxista; desde hace mucho el “sistema”, digo, en cuanto manifiesto reino de la disolución universal, imperio de la fluidez de todas las determinaciones, integró la “crítica”, a tal punto que ella constituye hoy el corazón del statu quo.<br>  <br>   <br>  <br>  Me explico. El objeto técnico, el objeto de consumo, pieza clave de nuestra civilización actual, es esencialmente “crítico”; obsoleto a priori, está muerto antes de nacer. Cuando se lanza al mercado, ya está listo para sucederlo el que le reemplazará. En este sentido, el sujeto eminente de la crítica son las grandes corporaciones trasnacionales, principales agentes de la producción.<br>  <br>   <br>  <br>  Cierto es que hoy la crítica propiamente dicha, filosófica o no, recorre una tercera etapa: se levanta a menudo contra aquello mismo que ella ha colaborado inconscientemente a construir; más apropiado sería decir aquí, a de-construir. En la producción de muchos de los “males” que enumerábamos al comienzo de esta exposición le cabe al pensamiento ilustrado, crítico, una importante cuota de responsabilidad. Que hoy la crítica retroceda ante sus propias consecuencias no cambia un ápice la naturaleza de las cosas.<br>  <br>   <br>  <br>  Pero tampoco esta oposición crítica a los resultados  de la crítica hace mella al “sistema”. Lo hemos dicho: el “sistema” es esencialmente “crítico”. Sea cual fuere el sentido en que se la entienda y ejerza, la crítica está de antemano contenida en él.<br>  <br>   <br>  <br>  Es evidente además que no todo puede estar siempre bien y conviene que algunos lo digan para que el “sistema” se enorgullezca legítimamente de sus bondades y exponga sus incomparables beneficios. Por otra parte, a nadie escapa que la crítica es hoy un brillante negocio en el cual se encuentra comprometido un tan poderoso como complejo dispositivo que comprende la totalidad de las industrias culturales y los medios de difusión masiva. Así, el filósofo crítico se desplaza subrepticiamente hacia el intelectual y éste hacia el periodista, tendiendo a fundirse los tres en una configuración única, al celoso servicio de gigantescas corporaciones empresarias.<br>  <br>   <br>  <br>  Así las cosas, ensa?arse con los “males” del presente en unidimensional visión peyorativa es quizá, sin proponérselo, contribuir a enraizarlos, deslizarse por una pendiente sin fin. No resulta fácil ver cómo la crítica a las crecientes desigualdades económicas y sociales, a la banalización de la cultura o a las tambaleantes instituciones políticas, refuerza y tiende a perpetuar el nihilismo existente. Pero si esa crítica, como sucede, condenando en bloque la situación, sólo está en condiciones de ofrecer como alternativa inviables restituciones de valores caducos e imaginarios mundos idos o, lo que es lo mismo, ilusiones utópicas desarraigadas, su principal efecto es, en definitiva, acrecentar el desaliento y el escepticismo y, con ello, acelerar la caída de todo escrúpulo, aun cuando contribuya a nutrir la buena conciencia del filósofo crítico, asegurándole de este modo un dormir apacible.<br>  <br>   <br>  <br>  Principal efecto no es único efecto. Por cierto, el filósofo crítico logrará provocar también odios y resentimientos de variada estirpe, afortunadamente por lo general privados de mecanismos de descarga, como asimismo indignaciones de semblanza moral que no conducen a nada y, por último, estimulará la formación de un pu?ado de consciencias críticas, almas bellas lectoras de periódicos “contestatarios” y consumidoras de literatura de “denuncia” y “cultura alternativa”, que vituperarán el estado de cosas desde las alturas de su presunta sensata pseudodistinción.  Un simulacro de aristocracia del intelecto, atrapada en las garras de la industria cultural.<br>  <br>   <br>  <br>  Sin embargo, al fin de cuentas, esta función crítica la practica con mayor solvencia el periodista, siempre y cuando podamos todavía diferenciarlo del filósofo crítico. Queda expuesto, pues, uno de los factores, cuya importancia relativa desconozco, de por qué la filosofía incide tan escasamente en el devenir de la vida contemporánea.<br>  <br>   <br>  <br>  Claro que no todo el discurso filosófico actual está aquejado por pareja fiebre crítica; existe también una vertiente “adaptativa”, por así llamarla, que busca mejorar lo dado a partir de su aceptación más o menos complaciente, en términos de su descripción vulgar. Dócil a la agenda que otros dictan, el filósofo adaptado se preocupará, por ejemplo, por  reducir las desigualdades económicas y sociales, acortando la distancia entre ricos y pobres; también por elevar la calidad de la educación y de la producción cultural, inducir “éticas mínimas”  a respetar por la humanidad en su conjunto, garantizar la seguridad de los ciudadanos, moderar la corrupción, perfeccionar los servicios sociales, etcétera. Bregará, en una palabra, por introducir una cuota de “racionalidad” en un mundo que parece reacio a ella. Elabora lo que podríamos llamar, usando una expresión de moda, un discurso filosófico “políticamente correcto”. Discurso filosófico de la reconciliación que, en el mejor de los casos, suele diluirse en acotadas propuestas técnicas, conforme a los distintos ámbitos de su pretendida incidencia. Aunque el filósofo adaptado resulta más útil que el crítico, la influencia de la filosofía tampoco es relevante por este camino. Si la estrategia crítica fundía el perfil del filósofo con el del periodista de opinión, la estrategia adaptativa identifica al filósofo con el técnico.<br>  <br>   <br>  <br>  Propongo otra estrategia, algo así como una tercera posición respecto a las anteriores. Desde ya, vale aclararlo, eso no garantiza que el discurso filosófico ganará automáticamente en influencia en la sociedad actual. Pero nos preguntábamos cuál podía ser el papel de la filosofía en el mundo en que nos toca vivir o, con cierta grandilocuencia, por la misión del pensador, hoy. Hemos descartado las versiones crítica y adaptativa. En efecto, ni todo es sin más negativo en el presente, ni es cosa de conformarse con los primeros planos que capturan nuestra mirada. Aunque no simpatizo con la metáfora de la profundidad, pienso que “detrás” de los primeros planos se agitan corrientes subterráneas que entra?an insólitas promesas de futuro. En realidad, más que de sumergirse en las profundidades se trata de cambiar la óptica, de leer con otros ojos la superficie.<br>  <br>   <br>  <br>  Según creo advertir, en pleno imperio del nihilismo pero hasta cierto punto a contrapelo de él, la humanidad occidental está embarcada en una aventura inédita: el acceso de las masas a un proceso de individuación. No todo es pues negativo; mientras se disuelven valores e instituciones, caen tradiciones y creencias inveteradas, se afianza una nueva entidad, el individuo singularizado que, harto de la experiencia gregaria, quiere vivir su propia, inconfundible, vida; experimentar a su modo su propio decurso vital, liberado de ataduras y referencias obligadas. En realidad, el proceso de individuación no es nuevo; lo nuevo es que las masas accedan globalmente a este proceso, sin importar anacrónicas diferencias de “clase” o antiguallas parecidas. Lo hacen, claro está, a su manera. Tosca y grosera, sin estilo, donde el mal gusto es moneda corriente.<br>  <br>   <br>  <br>   Pero no esperemos encontrar procesos nimbados de radiante belleza ni, mucho menos, puros. En nuestro tiempo, todos los signos son ambiguos. Tomemos por caso el cuidado del cuerpo y la búsqueda de goce, tal como los llevan a cabo los individuos que emergen de la masa. En principio, la revalorización del cuerpo constituye un elemento positivo. Implica el aprecio por la apariencia y lo terreno, clausurando así siglos de cruel autonegación trasmundana. Una filosofía posmetafísica tiene que acompa?ar y potenciar esta tendencia. Claro que tal culto del cuerpo por parte del individuo neófito se presenta inextricablemente mezclado, las más de las veces, con autonegaciones sutiles como regímenes alimenticios torturantes, ejercicios físicos agotadores u operaciones cruentas. El individuo que despierta de su ancestral sue?o gregario afirma la vida, la tierra y el sí mismo, apuesta a la inmanencia, pero no puede eludir la necesidad de castigo, signo de un sentimiento de culpabilidad del que aún no ha sabido desprenderse.<br>  <br>   <br>  <br>  Algo similar ocurre con la orientación al goce.  En principio, el individuo no desea ya sacrificarse en función de fines trascendentes sean cuales fueren; el goce, fuertemente asociado ahora a los placeres del cuerpo, en particular sexuales, es buscado activamente. No podemos sino celebrar esa tendencia. Desde el fondo de la historia de Occidente resuena la  plácida y potente voz de Aristóteles: “Podría pensarse que todos aspiran al placer porque todos desean vivir; pues la vida es actividad, y cada uno se ejercita en y con aquello que más ama: el músico oyendo melodías, el estudioso ocupando su mente con los objetos de su consideración, y así todos los demás, y como el placer perfecciona las actividades, perfecciona también la vida, que todos desean. Es razonable, por tanto, que aspiren también al placer, puesto que perfecciona la vida de cada uno, que le es apetecible Dejemos por ahora la cuestión de si apetecemos la vida por causa del placer o el placer por causa de la vida. Ambas cosas, en verdad, parecen encontrarse unidas y no admitir separación, ya que sin actividad no hay placer, y el placer perfecciona toda actividad”.(1).<br>  <br>   <br>  <br>  Sintética y bellamente lo ha reiterado Nietzsche, más cerca de nosotros: “la vida es un manantial de placer”.<br>  <br>   <br>  <br>  Sin embargo, la orientación al goce del individuo que se recorta de la masa aflora con frecuencia aunada a una exigencia superyoica, a un imperativo moral, tan exigente y ciego como el deber kantiano. Gozar sí, pero no por inclinación sino por deber.<br>  <br>   <br>  <br>  Me pronuncio pues por un discurso filosófico que, abandonando tanto la distancia crítica como el mero conformismo, atienda al extraordinario proceso que protagonizan hoy los hombres y mujeres vulgares, tratando de analizar rigurosamente sus distintas facetas, a fin de extraer, depurar y exaltar los elementos positivos, potencialmente superadores del nihilismo, que allí se localizan. Nihilismo y semillas de nueva afirmación conviven: ?no es apasionante tarea del filósofo contemporáneo ayudar a las personas comunes  a forjar su singularidad, removiendo rémoras del pasado, exaltando brotes de autoafirmación y, sobre todo, colaborando a elevar el gusto, a configurar un estilo?<br>  <br>   <br>  <br>  Ya he dicho que la orientación que propongo no garantiza el protagonismo de la filosofía. Pero al menos nos aparta del estéril automatismo crítico, planteándonos tareas tan poco practicadas como subyugantes, al situarnos en una nueva posición subjetiva.<br>  <br>   <br>  <br>  Mediante la debida torsión, muchos de los “males” que enunciamos al principio, revelan encerrar riquezas insospechadas. Sin olvidar, por supuesto, algunos “bienes”, que no mencionamos.<br>  <br>   <br>  <br>  El nihilismo no es más que el estertor de un mundo que agoniza. Pero en su seno alientan fuerzas creadoras, contracorrientes fecundas. Guardémonos, eso sí, de so?ar con auroras resplandecientes; nos esperan ma?anas grises y brumosas. No por eso dejamos de asistir a un nuevo amanecer.|`|65b82041bbdf6490d7bbe6b69f1bda2baa	Siempre esta ahí,como tiene tanta formas.........|`|7d714d81d3eec89574a5f6653b8c641faa	La filosofía es la encargada de utilizar la razón para resolver, o preguntarnos la mayor de las veces, todo lo relacionado a las cosas.<br>  <br>  La filosofía es sumamente importante, ya que es ella quien nos hace navegar por los caminos del entendimiento, pero más allá|`|a6bdcadb7ee263c55537b318f41ed71aaa	La filosofía hace que el ser humano reflexione sobre el mundo que nos rodea, innovar nuevas cosas que la humanidad usa para bien o para mal, resolver problemas.<br>  Nos hace preguntarnos el porque, cuando y como de las cosas, así como en el arte de crear cosas.<br>  En conclusión la Filosofía ayuda a la humanidad a siempre tratar y lograr de ver lo que hay " detrás de la monta?a" y así superarse cada vez mas en cualquier cosa que queramos.|`|cf64927212868a5317114bf3148d8bc5aa	Nos hace tomar conciencia de lo que sucede a nuestro alrededor, ya que muchas veces no tenemos tiempo, para lo más importante, lo cual que es encontrarnos con nosotros mismos, al medidar y descubrir esas peque?as cosas que nos da este mundo.|`|d2264d9c35b511a799d1c42248a18f25aa	Uno secundario, pero vital.|`|3cf4b1503f0b93de22f40f4f16f4b10eaa	La filosofia siempre ha jugado un papel en el mundo, en los seres pensantes llenos de dudas y llenos de sabiduria... llenos de amor al saber... lastima que ahora ya solo exista y gobierne RBD y TELEVISA...

The reason you're not Wiccan is because you know that if you say stupid things the triple goddess and horned god will reincarnate you as a donkey.  Since you don't want to be a donkey, you tell yourself that there is no goddess and god.<br>  <br>  Atheists are people who don't believe in any kind of god.  Is it so hard for you to comprehend that there are people who believe something different than you do?  I mean, just close your eyes and try to believe in the little pink unicorn.  Just try.  Force yourself to believe in the unicorn.  Are you choosing to not believe in the pink unicorn because you don't want to?  No, you can't believe in the unicorn because it doesn't make sense to you.  To an Atheist, the concept of a god (yours or mine) makes no sense.  They can't force themselves to believe in it any more than you can't believe in the unicorn.<br>  <br>  Has it occurred to you that Atheists are just as ethical as Christians?  The difference is that they do the right thing because it's right, not because they're afraid of hell.<br>  <br>  And is it so hard for you to use the "search" function on Y!A?

If not leaving them, there may be an uneasiness with old relationships this can be a huge burden and isn't easy.<br>  <br>  2.to be atheist you can't rely on 'god did it', which is the easy answer for everything. If you want answers you have to look for it in history, culture and science.<br>  <br>  Also atheists hold themselves to account for what they do wrong, not 'the devil' and we do not see that we can be forgiven by 'accepting god'. We take punishment as the land sees fit, or the burden of guilt. Who has it easier? I mean all you need to do is pray and be remorseful to god. and you'll go to 'heaven'. Nice safety net, we don't have that. Then there is the social mistrust against atheists at the moment.<br>  <br>  Christians are sheep, they follow 1 book in the end(which was written by crazy sheep herders and is based on even older religions). That's easy. Atheists have the whole of science, history and philosophy to follow, study and try to master. Your very wrong about it being easier to be an atheist, it's theists that have it easy.|`|f6743TA1aa	Wrong. And, once again, just another theist reiterating a common stereotype about atheists. And, seems to me, you've got it backwards. It is Christians that believe they can blame their bad behavior on the devil and on man's "sinful nature", and it is Christians who believe God will forgive them for ANYTHING. Atheists do not have any of those luxuries and, thus, we feel completely responsible for our own behavior. Doing the right thing becomes much more important, not less so, and life, since this is likely all there is, becomes much, much more precious not less so.<br>  <br>  Contrary to what you and many other believers tend to think, not all atheists are thoughtless hedonists running around raping, pillaging, harming their fellow man and themselves. Most of us live our lives no differently than most believers do.<br>  <br>  If belief in a God made one act more "moral" than did not believing in a God, the prisons would be full of atheists and there would be very few, if any, believers. As it is, atheists are underrepresented in the prison population.<br>  <br>  ~Atheist, ex-fundie-Xian, former New Ager|`|X548yCR6aa	Yes, if you don't believe in bible God, you don't believe in the devil as well.<br>  <br>  Not that there is a reason to believe in the mythological Christianity devil even if you do believe in God.

ALL men, want what they can't have.  <br>  <br>  Make yourself unavailable.  i.e. do not call him, text him, or email him.  When he calls you, (and he will), be busy and return his call at your convenience, and when you do keep it brief, be warm and friendly (smile) but maintain your distance.<br>  <br>  If he wants to see you, you're going out with friends. Don't tell him who, be vague.  If he asks say 'oh no-one you know'.<br>  <br>  Let his imagination work overtime. Give nothing away.  You're not missing him, you're far too busy to be missing him.<br>  <br>  Now this is hard to do and the easiest way to do it is to make sure you are busy.  So really fill your diary up as much as possible.  Go out with friends, do stuff you enjoy doing, spend some time on yourself.<br>  <br>  And if at the end of it all you don't get him back, what will you have lost.  Nothing - coz it's on the cards anyway.  At least this way you'll have had a ball doing it and you will come out the other side feeling good about yourself.<br>  <br>  Louise H

ICGxM45qaa	That's a well said question that really makes one think. I recently had a good friend turn her back on me after joining an Evangelist cult, saying that my path wasn't "godly" enough. But if you look at the history of Christianity, they didn't just hate Jews and atheists, but anyone who doesn't swallow their particular brand of self-delusion. And they never had a problem putting the "non-believers" to the sword, or enslaving them and forcing their nonsense down the throats of the captive children. It's sad when people turn away from reason.|`|Kgp9yqyLaa	Most atheists are anti-Christians.<br>  <br>  Christians are not antisemitic. Not as long as they worship 'the King of Jews', Jesus Christ.

(It becomes a different question when you start to ask "would you be willing to let people starve in the inevitable famine that would follow...etc.).<br>  <br>  But if you are simply trying to weigh the values of animal life vrs. human life, there is no contest. <br>  <br>  Humans are of infinite value, because they are all children of God, and made in the image and likeness of God. That goes for ALL humans.  Humans have rights (like the right to life) simply because THEY ARE HUMAN.

I'd go on to say that organized religion is nothing more than a method of control. I have no problem with personal spirituality, but when you start making rules having to do with religion, and try to get others to follow it by creating imagined punishments for not following the rules, then there's no way a rational person could call it anything else BUT mind control.<br>  <br>  To endangeredspecies114... if you're going to spout on about how you used to party, you could at least check your facts. There is no way to smoke too much marijuana... there is no amount that you can OD on... you could chain smoke all day and all night for 3 weeks and not end up in the hospital because of it (though you'd probably end up with a nasty cough until you stopped smoking for a while).

Once you see the truths contained in the Bible and how good science confirms them, and then apply them to your life, then you will see how ridiculous everything else is that tries to explain the origin of man.<br>  <br>  Some fallible humans may try to use it for mind control, but that is not it's purpose and it surely isn't what God intended it for.

And we are and we should be working out our salvation to be able to go on unto perfection of faith towards God. (Hebrews 6:1)<br>  <br>  "... work out your own salvation with fear and trembling."<br>  - Philippians 2:12<br>  <br>  The Bible clearly states <br>  <br>  "... exercise thyself rather unto Godliness." <br>  & in vs 8<br>  <br>  "For bodily exercise profiteth little: but Godliness is profitable unto all things, having promise of the life that now is, and of that which is to come."<br>  1 Timothy 4:7,8 <br>  <br>  So the answer is, not only does He "let you work out in it", He WANTs you to work out!!!|`|08b4f664c464f2ed59adcc177a2a6f6faa	nope, he'd make us pay|`|2d1c7d2685e5e11386c9f3a0adf973fcaa	if we were in his presence we would not worry about what we look like|`|4e0bc23f2d7f8209f67c5b18383f7002aa	your stupid|`|AA10987726	He would let everyone work out in it.

Pero, lamentablemente, no es así: los hombres y mujeres de comienzos de este Tercer Milenio parecemos haber perdido el rumbo, nos ocupamos de toda clase de cosas, menos de pensar hacia dónde vamos, sin darnos cuenta de que ya estamos andando en una ruta - la ruta hacia la eternidad- y que, inexorablemente vamos a llegar a uno de tres destinos: Cielo, Infierno o Purgatorio<br>  <br>   Pensamos -equivocadamente- que la felicidad está aquí en la tierra y la buscamos con una dedicación que más bien debiéramos poner en buscar la felicidad que sólo es posible, no en esta vida, sino en la eternidad.<br>  <br>   La idea del Cielo, de Infierno y de Purgatorio es prácticamente desconocida y casi nunca comentada. De allí que el Papa Juan Pablo II le haya pedido a nuestros Obispos en su visita ad-limina a la ciudad de Roma en el a?o 1995 que era importante que "a los hijos de la Iglesia en Venezuela" se nos educara "en el sentido de Dios y en la esperanza de las realidades últimas". De allí también que el Papa haya dedicado él mismo una serie de Catequesis durante el a?o 1999 a tratar estos temas escatológicos que tienen que ver con el destino último del ser humano<br>  <br>          ?Cómo es el Cielo? <br>  <br>  El Cielo es una de las opciones que el ser humano tiene para la otra vida. En realidad es la opción para la cual fuimos creados, pues Dios desea comunicarnos Su completa y perfecta felicidad, que además es eterna - es decir, para siempre- llevándonos al Cielo, la patria hacia la cual caminamos, nuestro verdadero hogar, el sitio de la felicidad perfecta y total.<br>  <br>  Lograr una descripción adecuada de lo que es el Cielo, con nuestras limitadas categorías humanas de tiempo y espacio, con la limitación de ideas y de lenguaje, es imposible. San Pablo, quien según sus escritos pudo vislumbrar el Cielo, sólo puede referir que "oyó palabras que no se pueden decir: cosas que el hombre no sabría expresar ... ni el ojo vio, ni el oído escuchó, ni el corazón humano puede imaginar lo que tiene Dios preparado para aquéllos que le aman" (2a. Cor.12, 2-4 y 1a. Cor. 2,9).<br>  <br>  Así es el Cielo: indescriptible, inimaginable, insondable, inexplicable, para el ser humano, pues somos limitados para comprender y describir lo ilimitado de Dios ... y el Cielo es básicamente la presencia de Dios en forma clara, "le veremos tal cual El es" (1a. Jn. 3,2).<br>  <br>   El Papa Juan Pablo II tomaba para sus Catequesis sobre las "realidades últimas" la descripción del Cielo que trae el Catecismo de la Iglesia Católica: "Esta vida perfecta con la Santísima Trinidad, esta comunión de vida de amor con ella, con la Virgen y todos los bienaventurados se llama 'el Cielo'. El Cielo es el fin último y la realización de las aspiraciones más profundas del hombre, el estado supremo y definitivo de felicidad (#1024)."<br>  <br>   Continuaba el Papa Juan Pablo II: "El Cielo se entiende como morada de Dios ... una relación íntima con la Santísima Trinidad ... El Cielo es la plenitud de la intimidad con Dios" (JP II, 21-julio-99).<br>  <br>  Pero, como hemos dicho y como acotaba también el Papa Juan Pablo II, toda representación del Cielo resulta siempre inadecuada. También resulta difícil imaginar cómo es Dios y qué beneficios nos traería el verlo "cara a cara" (1a. Cor. 13, 12), pero tal vez sea más fácil imaginarnos lo maravilloso del Cielo, si pensamos en lo que no es el Cielo.<br>  <br>  Al morir, nos despojamos del cuerpo, que es el peso que nos ata a la tierra. Dejamos, entonces, todo lo que es físico, orgánico: enfermedades, cansancios, dolores, achaques, etc. Adicionalmente queda atrás todo lo desagradable que hemos pasado en la tierra: malestares, penurias, agravios, persecuciones, dolores, enfermedades, inconvenientes, aflicciones, obstáculos, maldades, desagrados, contrariedades, rivalidades, competencia, tribulaciones. En una palabra: queda atrás todo sufrimiento.<br>  <br>  Al llegar al Cielo, el alma siente enseguida, instantáneamente, un consuelo, una reparación, un desagravio a sus sufrimientos terrenos. "Vuestra tristeza se convertirá en gozo" (Jn. 16, 20).<br>  <br>   Si el día de nuestro nacimiento nacimos para esta vida terrenal, llegar al Cielo es nacer a la gloria; es nacer a la vida eterna. Nuestra alma al presentarse al Cielo tiene un solo pensar, un solo sentimiento que es el Amor de Dios.<br>  <br>  También podemos imaginar algo del Cielo, si nos concentramos en el gozo que allí tendremos.<br>  <br>  Nos dice la Sagrada Escritura que el Cielo consiste en "conocer a Dios" (Jn. 17, 3 - Mt. 5,8), pero también en gozar de El: "Entra en el gozo de tu Se?or" (Mt. 25, 21; "para que vuestro gozo sea perfecto" (Jn. 15, 11).<br>  <br>  El gozo del Cielo es un gozo de Amor: el amor más grande que podamos sentir, pues es el Amor Infinito de Dios. Amaremos a Dios con todas nuestras fuerzas y El nos amará con Su Amor que no tiene límites. Será como la fusión de nuestra vida con la Vida de Dios, que nos atraerá hacia Su Amor en forma infinita. (cfr. Garrigou-Lagrange, La Vida Eterna y la profundidad del alma).<br>  <br>  Intentemos explicar -limitadamente- cómo será ese gozo del Cielo: amaremos a Dios con un amor intensísimo, embelesados por todas sus cualidades, que son perfectas, maravillosas e infinitas. Ese amor que sentiremos, atraídos por Su Amor, será correspondido perfectísimamente por El, sin las desilusiones propias del amor humano, con Su ternura infinita y en la intimidad más dulce que podamos imaginar. Distinto a como son los amores humanos, ese gozo será de una plenitud siempre nueva, de una novedad constante que no cesa jamás. Y, además, ese Amor durará para siempre, siempre, siempre.<br>  <br>  Es un océano de gozo, que llena por completo las profundidades del alma y satisface por completo las aspiraciones del corazón, sin que se pueda desear o necesitar absolutamente nada más. (cfr. Antonio Royo Marín, o.p. , Teología de la Salvación).<br>  <br>  El Cielo es el cumplimiento del "entra para siempre en el gozo de tu Se?or"(Mt. 25, 21).|`|d12a1d97f992d3cc83ef4fbf8f305c63aa	Es que cambia constantemente.

"Should I let my child study languages when I can't even afford to get them through high school?" <br>  <br>  If/when they finish college most decide to find jobs and earn money ASAP and help their families. Rich families have that option to study but since a lot of the families are under the poverty line, they would rather earn money than spend and wait a few more weeks or months.

c5b10417ab11e04ce32c9ee0f3591582aa	Las Gorgonas eran tres monstruos y se llamaban Esteno, Euríale y Medusa.  Las tres eran hijas de las divinidades marinas Forcis y Ceto. De las tres, sólo esta última era mortal, pero era considerada la Gorgona por excelencia.<br>  <br>      La cabeza de estos monstruos estaba rodeada de serpientes, tenían grandes colmillos, manos de bronce y alas de oro. Su mirada era tan penetrante que el que osaba mirarlas a los ojos quedaba convertido en piedra. Pertenecen a la generación preolímpica. Vivían en el Occidente extremo, no lejos del País de los Muertos. Todos les temían, y sólo Poseidón fue capaz de unirse a Medusa y darle dos hijos: el caballo alado, Pegaso y Crisaor. <br>  <br>      Las leyendas se centran en Medusa, pues aunque según una tradición fue siempre monstruo, hay otra según la cual, era una hermosa joven que se atrevió a rivalizar con Atenea en belleza, por lo que la diosa la convirtió en la Gorgona. Otra versión cuenta que como Poseidón se atrevió a violar a la joven en uno de los templos de Atenea, ésta castigó a Medusa.<br>  <br>      Perseo fue su asesino, por consejo de Atenea, o -según otras tradiciones- por orden del tirano Polidectes. Este héroe logró cortarle la cabeza elevándose en el aire gracias a las sandalias aladas de Hermes, y para no mirarla, usó como espejo su escudo brillante. En adelante, Atenea tuvo la cabeza de la Gorgona en su escudo y se volvió invencible. Además, Perseo se quedó con la sangre, a la cual se le atribuían cualidades mágicas: la que brotó de lado izquierdo era un veneno mortal y la del lado derecho curaba y resucitaba al que la bebiera. Por otro lado, su cabello hacía huir al ejército más numeroso.<br>  <br>      Para muchos mitólogos, Medusa simbolizaba el carácter maligno de la mujer que le dieran los griegos, y representaba a la mujer-demonio, a la madre que da la muerte, al lado oscuro de la femineidad<br>  <br>  suerte!!|`|f0408de9719ef4552a4243b875645961aa	La verdad no me recuerdo me la podrías decir gracias.|`|ba43f273f730ad296258d821001f750aaa	Gorgonas, en la mitología griega, las hijas monstruosas de Forcis, dios del mar, y de Ceto, su esposa.

Tenían alas fuertes, rostros redondos y horribles, dientes como colmillos y siempre llevaban la lengua fuera. Vivían en lo más lejano del océano occidental, temidas por las gentes, ya que volvían de piedra a todo el que las miraba.<br>  Dos de las gorgonas, Esteno y Euríale, eran inmortales, mientras que Medusa era mortal.

Medusa, Esteno y Euríale eran despiadados monstruos de manos metálicas, colmillos afilados y cabellera de serpientes venenosas vivas, lo que indicaba su naturaleza ctónica. Las Gorgonas y sus otras hermanas las Greas (y posiblemente las Hespérides) eran hijas de Forcis y Ceto.<br>  <br>  En la versión más conocida del mito, Medusa era originalmente una hermosa mujer humana. Poseidón se enamoró de ella, y la sedujo (o violó) en un templo dedicado a Atenea. Ambos dioses eran rivales desde que compitieran por el patronazgo de Atenas y los habitantes de la ciudad prefiriesen el olivo de Atenea a la fuente o los caballos de Poseidón.<br>  <br>  Tras descubrir la profanación de su templo, Atenea transformó a Medusa como castigo hasta tener la misma forma de sus hermanas Gorgonas. Sus cabellos se convirtieron en serpientes y su mirada tenía el poder de petrificar a cualquier criatura viva (según algunas versiones, fue Afrodita quien, celosa de su cabellera, la cambió por serpientes). Fue desterrada allende las tierras hiperbóreas.<br>  <br>  Mientras Medusa estaba embarazada de Poseidón, fue decapitada por el héroe Perseo con la ayuda de Atenea y Hermes. De la sangre que cayó al suelo o, según las versiones, de su cuello brotó su descendencia: el caballo alado Pegaso y el gigante Crisaor. Perseo usó la cabeza de Medusa para rescatar a Andrómeda, matar a Polidectes y, en algunas versiones, petrificar al titán Atlas. Entonces se la ofreció a Atenea, quien la colocó en su escudo, la égida.<br>  <br>  Según cuenta Pausanias en el libro II de su Descripción de Grecia, dedicado a Corinto, el mito de Medusa es una versión novelada de la historia de una reina quien, después de la muerte de su padre, habría recogido ella misma el cetro, gobernando a sus súbditos cerca del lago Tritonide, en Libia.

EdC9JfIQaa	First of all, I disagree with your hypothesis.  It is possible that, since there are more people than there used to be that more people are eating healthy.  However, there are also more people eating unhealthy too.  Mervyns is closing. Macy's is closing, Circut City is closing. But McDonald's, Wendy's, etc. keep opening up new stores. In fact, it is a lot easier to find unhealthy food than it is to find healthy food.|`|AA12152549	I don't think there's anything particularly primitive about fixing a home-cooked meal.  My partner have been eating at home for over 30 years.  We both cook and enjoy preparing meals for one another; and from what I see at the local supermarkets many other people do the same thing.<br>  <br>  The problem nowadays is that people tend to be lazy and wait until the last minute to decide what they want for dinner.   Meal planning takes time and thought.|`|AA12346188	There is no other go but to start self cooking.

Marriage is a game of patience, not just love.|`|8e6f671107760e695bd9b4f9a1ddab06aa	Follow your heart. if you truly love him wait. it might not be the right time for him.|`|o28iO6FKaa	Hi there,<br>         why all of a sudden do you feel stupid living with him. Is it society that makes you feel that way? just because you don't have a ring do sent mean he do sent love you with all he has. Marriage is a society thing. It should be personal for you both. If you both are happy how you are then why change it with a ring. Its already bringing disharmony into your relationship and its only a piece of metal. When you tell someone you love them you bind your self to that person with the same vows you say through marriage.  If he didn't love you he wouldn't stay with you and he wouldn't have taken you back when you left him. Sit back and think about what you have in the here and now. To me you seem to be getting shirty because your not getting your own way with this thing. Maybe he thinks the more you ask about it the more time he will take to eventually ask you. Be patient. Don't rush him and risk loosing him. Cause you cant marry by yourself :). <br>  <br>  Patience is a mongrel i know lol. Im the most impatient person i know of. I want things done yesterday.

The most important thing is your love for each other.<br>  <br>  Stay safe guys.|`|jjt2enntaa	Have you asked him to marry you?  Have you presented him with a ring?   You need to decide how important a wedding ring is to your relationship.  If it's very important to you and he knows that, but still refuses to give you a ring, then there is some amiss.

I also don't understand why you would stay with him for 4 years without a marriage and now all of a sudden you need a marriage. You said you aren't having sex so you aren't worried about becoming pregnant, right?  If you are with a guy that you love and he is taking care of you and everything you need and want, and he loves you just as much, I don't see the problem here.<br>          I can see you are frustrated and want a ring on your finger as a symbol that you belong to this man, or is it the actual paperwork saying you are married that you need? Are you afraid he might up and leave you with nothing after the 4 years you have devoted to him?<br>         I say look at Goldie Hawn and that Kurt Russel ,handsome hunk she has been with for over 25 years, they aren't married, they love and trust each other -------totally.

I don't like to say this but perhaps he is not as fully out of the closet as you.  Maybe he has misgivings about his acquaintances and relatives finding out you are a couple via a wedding?  I hope I am not way off bat on the gay relationship.  It could be that he want to wait until he has the money to buy you a special ring, perhaps handcrafted by an artisan?  You seem to get on well together, I assume he is faithful, maybe it is just not a priority for him right now?  Is he very busy at work - that could be a reason.  Is he contented - that could be a reason - why change contentment?  I don't think leaving and going to your parents will help the situation.  It is, after all, a form of blackmail.  Can you not just sit him down and tell him what you've told us?   Best of luck anyway!|`|fyrj50Braa	You should leave it to him to ask you to marry you in his own time and leave it at that.

We had a little bit last year and could of married but we didn't so i have just decided it will happen when were both ready not just one of us. Were together happy and that's al that matters.

iMplzgBtaa	The same can be said about most of the Muslims in this section.  Too often they view a simple question as an intended insult and reply in an insulting  manner. usually hurling personal insults against the person asking the question.  Because of this many non-Muslims do not take anything they say seriously.  There is no need to act ill-mannered when defending one's religion.  Anytime a person states what their religion is they are representing that religion.  Many here don't know any Muslims personally so their only image of them is what is portrayed here.  Thankfully I know quite a few Muslims and know them to be kind, loving individuals.  If it were not for them and all I knew of Muslims was what is presented here I would most likely form an extremely bad image of them.  Muslims here need to stop complaining about how non-Muslims view their religion because they are the ones causing the bad image themselves.  When they start to practice what they preach then there will be many more non-Muslims who will not be so quick to label them as haters.|`|E0WUtePYaa	You are a nasabie version of eviwahabbi

It is a gift of intimacy, which by definition incorporates caring, and communication. Likewise, the giving of a truly sensual massage requires that one listens carefully to the needs, and wishes of their partner.<br>  <br>  Start by ensuring that your partner is comfortable, warm, and relaxed. Begin the massage by applying warmed oils, mixed with a mutually enjoyed carrier, to the area of the body you want to work first.<br>  <br>  Many begin with the back rub, an excellent area through which to achieve a heightened level of relaxation, and a more open line of communication.<br>  <br>  Keep your strokes light at the start, listening attentively to the reactions of your partner. Their communications will be both spoken, and intimated through body language. The lighter the stroke the better, unless indications are that additional pressure would be preferred.<br>  <br>  Continuous movement is important to the flow of the massage - when working on the back, begin at the neck, taking your fingers gently down the spine, and off to the side in a smooth, fluid motion. Let one stroke lead into another, avoiding sudden movements, always focusing on the needs, and responses of your partner.<br>  <br>  Keep your massage varied, using different strokes, and shifting to changing areas of the body. Balance opposing limbs, working one, then the other.<br>  <br>  Some couples enjoy using 'props' to take the sensory nature of the experience beyond what simple fingers to skin can bring. Consider incorporating feathers, silk, or fresh flowers into your event - but don't rub too lightly, or you may send your partner into a tickle induced fit of laughter - enjoyable in most cases, but perhaps not as sensual a moment as one may be hoping for!<br>  <br>  Always pay close attention to the state of relaxation your partner is in. Sleep is a possibility with any massage, but a true sensual massage walks this line carefully, ensuring a partner who is aware, capable of communicating their needs & enjoyment, and of sharing in further intimacies that tend to flow naturally from such moments!<br>  <br>  Engaging your partner in a moment dedicated solely to one another is one small way of ensuring a relationship that is positive, communicative, and intimate in more ways than one.|`|6af5c52eca3b7e0a3a16387319a25f6baa	Pumpkin spice and Cinnamon are male aphrodisiacs.<br>  <br>  Rose, jasmine and other florals are female aphrodisiacs.|`|7b240743ae5b52cf2502780e417a1178aa	send them on a cruise or trip and pay it as a gift.
032c56c6505648d16d575b88a2eda7ccaa	Intellectual people contribute to making society a better place to live. <br>  <br>  Ignorant people contribute to the crime rate and bring society down to lowest common denominator, among other negatives.<br>  <br>  The question then become, does inclusiveness bring DOWN the level of intellect in a school, or does it RAISE it? <br>  <br>  It is very, very common in black communities to purposely do poorly in school because peer pressure exists among black kids against OTHER black kids for "acting white" - which means anything that will cause a black person to become more intellectual, more educated, and be able to contribute in a positive way to society. <br>  <br>  The few black kids who manage to do well in spite of this, suffer horrible teasing and taunting, being called names like "Uncle Tom" etc. for their entire school careers, and many of them cave in and just forget it.  Some do get out and get good jobs and contribute to society in positive ways. <br>  <br>  As for those who believe that getting a decent education is "acting white", WHY integrate them if they are so very against education in the first place for themselves, all they will do is contaminate the educational environment for those who DO want to learn. <br>  <br>  I don't think it is unreasonable that parents of kids who DO want to achieve and get an education, do NOT want the other type there. This causes a "dumbing down" of the education received for ALL students, due to having to meet test standards for funding, etc. <br>  <br>  Until this problem is solved concerning the prevalent and majority attitude among black youth that education and doing well in school (and in life) is "acting white" and to be avoided, I really don't know what the solution is - those who DO want to learn shouldn't be subjected to a lower standard of education because of these kids.|`|69ebdfa872907c9eb5cba61e41e731b8aa	It atonishes me as to what people do not know about history, they bring up irrelevant trash instead of remembering why some of these laws were created... I believer minorities thinking that all will be well are going to be given a harsh wake up call|`|fhChZfnyaa	This is an answer to the question, and responses to prior answerers.<br>  <br>  1st: The primary issue of Brown v. Board was whether this country provided separate and unequal (i.e. inferior, substandard) facilities, resources, and instruction for its students, who were of racial and/or ethnic minority groups and banned or otherwise excluded them from participation in classes that lacked these deficits of resources, which, to that time, were exclusively reserved for participation in by white students.<br>  <br>  My answer to the question is that I agree with the subcontent of the question, and therefore have to believe that the Supreme Court's decision is myopic. <br>  -I want to be clear that I DISAGREE with what other answerers have suggested, namely that minorities lack motivation to better themselves, OR that believing the ruling is bad suggests one believes minorities aren't up to higher levels of performance academically. <br>  I believe both of those contributors are misguided, and before they write something to demean me, let me explain my thinking:<br>  1)"Julia D" -Racial minorities do not control Hollywood, and are not responsible for the countless truly talented artists and entertainers that are overlooked or denied contracts to contribute intelligent, substantive works to the social fabric, and serve as role models to young minorities, who disproportionately grow up in households without them. They also do not control our judicial system, which Harvard University and other highly acclaimed institutions have repeatedly shown, disproportionately targets, profiles, harrasses, and (rightly and wrongly) convicts exponentially more frequently than whites.<br>  Now, one might say, 'why not? after all, don't they commit more crimes, show more fear and/or hostility towards authority, and act and dress like criminals, whether they are, or not?' -To that, I would point to history: minorities have been <br>  targeted, profiled, harrassed, and (rightly and wrongly) convicted exponentially more frequently than whites, since before they were released from slavery. -It was a form of social control, incepted at a time in our history, before we even legally recognized them as human beings, and we, this proud, ambitious nation, still seem to struggle with, to what degree we will allow these folks full rights of personhood.<br>  <br>  Shiftless, ambitionless, defeatist or defeated? "Julia D," you might be right, it certainly appears that way, with a LOT of urban youth, but if we are honest about what kind of psychological conditioning can be affected, over time, to entire groups of people, when consistent, especially confining or traumatizing treatment is applied, we might find that we as a society share some significant part of the responsibility for what we have created.<br>  <br>  To the "KentuckyGal," I understand both sides (racially) saw merit in some return to the convenience of schooling in their own communities, but hang on, before you go defining meaning to someone else's likes or dislikes. After all, tolerance is what's at the core of the whole debate.<br>  <br>  I believe most parent probably wish their kids could go to the neighborhood school, and get a truly quality education that would prepare them for the academic rigors of the real world <br>  competition they will face for jobs and advancement as adults -we want our kids to win - in life! But all we have as reference points is history, and history has shown that when LAWS were not enacted or enforced, the quality of teachers, teaching, schools, even books and other resources was sorely lacking in mainly-minority attended schools. <br>  <br>  So, it is incumbent on all of us, if we are going to allow for precedent-setting legislation to be eroded, to make sure that we do not return to the policies and practices of yester-year.<br>  In other words, if we do this, we need to not do it in the same way as before. <br>  In a nation in which jobs of substance, meaning, and any substantive income potential are being outsourced at alarming rates, and will be even harder to come by, for our children, to believe that anything as innocuous as sit-ins or marches will be the result, when and if things get to the point where folks are only given the undignified decision, between starving, or going back to slave-like standards, due to substandard educations. -I feel quite certain riots, and unimaginable levels of violence will erupt -not just from racial minorities, from ANY and EVERY ONE, who finds themselves excluded from the academic and other preparation for economic participation that should have been their RIGHT.<br>  <br>  So, if we are going to do this, I pray we do it right, this time.<br>  We have that responsibility.|`|Yt8CUk8zaa	I am right outside Louisville and can assure you a change was needed.  This decision will not be damaging, and it was overdue.  If you look, one family from Louisville that was part of the law suit was of the race that Brown v. Board was intended to assist (black).  This family, like many others, recognized the many, many adversities Brown v. Board put students and families through, as well as the many benefits today's ruling will ensure.<br>  <br>  People who fail have only themselves to blame.<br>  <br>  EDIT:  To the gal below me - It is a wake up call some people need.  Hopefully something good will come of this wake up call rather than it just being used as another poor little victim bullet.  To suggest that this ruling is bad is to suggest minorities cannot perform at the same level of their white counterparts - many of whom are poor and struggle just the same, if not more so.  You should be ashamed of yourself for indicating such - but if you feel this way, go do something about it.  Teach a child, teach a parent.  Something other than expect special treatment this many years after integration.<br>  <br>  And the things presented here are very relevant.  Just because you don't like them or agree with them doesn't mean they aren't relevant.

Forgiveness is obtained through repentance, prayer and good deeds.<br>  <br>           In Jewish practice, prayer has taken the place of sacrifices. In accordance with the words of Hosea, we render instead of bullocks the offering of our lips (Hosea 14:3) (please note: the KJV translates this somewhat differently). While dedicating the Temple, King Solomon also indicated that prayer can be used to obtain forgiveness (I Kings 8:46-50). Our prayer services are in many ways designed to parallel the sacrificial practices. For example, we have an extra service on shabbat, to parallel the extra shabbat offering. For more information about this, see Jewish Liturgy.<br>  <br>           It is important to note that in Judaism, sacrifice was never the exclusive means of obtaining forgiveness, was not in and of itself sufficient to obtain forgiveness, and in certain circumstances was not even effective to obtain forgiveness. This will be discussed further below. <br>  But isn't a blood sacrifice required in order to obtain forgiveness?<br>           No. Although animal sacrifice is one means of obtaining forgiveness, there are non-animal offerings as well, and there are other means for obtaining forgiveness that do not involve sacrifices at all.<br>  <br>           The passage that people ordinarily cite for the notion that blood is required is Leviticus 17:11: "For the soul of the flesh is in the blood and I have assigned it for you upon the altar to provide atonement for your souls; for it is the blood that atones for the soul." But the passage that this verse comes from is not about atonement; it is about dietary laws, and the passage says only that blood is used to obtain atonement; not that blood is the only means for obtaining atonement. Leviticus 17:10-12 could be paraphrased as "Don't eat blood, because blood is used in atonement rituals; therefore, don't eat blood."

Entonces para acotar la discusión, me referiré sólo a la católica. Si creemos en que Dios se ha hecho hombre para salvar nuestros pecados, entonces Jesús era un hombre de carne y hueso, como tal sí tenía órganos genitales, por lo tanto el Dios hecho hombre tenía sexo. Si lo ejercía, es otra cosa. Pues muchos podrían argumentar, que ya que disponía de un cuerpo como cualquier ser humano, entonces muy probablemente podría haber hecho uso de todas sus funciones, incluso la sexual.  Eso no está en la biblia, ni en los libros de historia, por lo tanto no se puede asegurar, son sólo especulaciones.<br>  Para otras religiones, por ejemplo la judía, el Mesías aún no ha llegado, por lo tanto aún no se ha hecho hombre, pero si llegara, y por lo visto esa figura siempre está representada en un varón, con genitales masculinos, externos e internos, pues de no ser así no sería un ser humano; obviamente éste tendría un sexo definido, el masculino.|`|EYfAhBnGaa	Muchas personas se enfadan por tu pregunta...<br>  <br>  es se?al de que su realidad esta dividida...<br>  <br>  Preguntar si dios tiene organos sexuales o tiene boca o tiene pensamientos, son preguntas de la misma naturaleza.<br>  <br>  Buscar formas en dios es imposible...<br>  <br>  Preguntar si dios es hombre o mujer, no tiene sentido<br>  <br>  porque dios es incomprensible|`|kEGRJSDnaa	Otro RIDICULO,mira mejor ve a ver si de casualidad hoy te ha salido un bello pubico mas par ver si ya maduras.|`|szu6tmxkaa	Fue Dios quien creo la sexualidad para el ser humano, El no la necesita.

cecdf22886f045decb40ed5a7c0ed336aa	The good thing with the Finnish language is that all the letters and combination of letters are always pronounced the same. For example the letter "i" is always pronounced like in Finnish. One "i" is pronounced with a short sound, two "ii" are pronounced with a long sound, for example in the word "viili" (some kind of soured milk). Consonants may be more difficult. Take the two words "tapa" and "tappa". One means "meet" (a friend for example) the other means "kill". So sometimes Finnish people jokingly say, "Hauska tappa vanha yst?va" (nice to kill an old friend). To a foreigner the two words may sound similar, but a native Finn will always hear the difference.<br>  You should actually go to Finland for a year and found out yourself, that may be the only way to learn how to pronounce  the words in this strange but interesting language.|`|1ab6f6ceaf0fe59ffa0df112b6c3ce9baa	so - just say FINNISH!!!|`|3bTLsedaaa	You can listen an example here:<br>  <a href="http://donnerwetter.kielikeskus.helsinki.fi/FinnishForForeigners/ch2-en/ch2-31-nominityyppeja.htm" rel="nofollow">http://donnerwetter.kielikeskus.helsinki...</a><br>  <br>  If you want to learn Finnish phrases, this is a good site:<br>  <a href="http://www.yle.fi/opinportti/supisuomea/fraasit/" rel="nofollow">http://www.yle.fi/opinportti/supisuomea/...</a>|`|Us7sLAa1aa	Have you ever seen the tail of a whale.

Debate of ideas is the foundation of this country and it is sad that open debates on college campuses, etc., is now so watered down you can't tell where people stand. Every people in the world have been enslaved or conquered at one time or another, so this argument loses steam right there. When I was growing up, if you didn't like what you heard, you would change the channel or present your own ideas for why you disagree. Now a days that behavior may get you suspended, fired, labeled anti-patriotic or even arrested. I'd close with a joke, but, the fact that the 1st ammendmendt seems close to being non-existent makes it hard to laugh.
c9a1b864f1a97925067a5a7737860ac4aa	The Bible never specifically mentions masturbation or states whether masturbation is a sin. There is no question, however, as to whether the actions that lead to masturbation are sinful. Masturbation is the end result of lustful thoughts, sexual stimulation, and/or pornographic images. It is these problems that need to be dealt with. If the sins of lust and pornography are forsaken and overcome - the problem of masturbation will become a non-issue.<br>   <br>  <br>  The Bible tells us to avoid even the appearance of sexual immorality (Ephesians 5:3). I do not see how masturbating can pass that particular test. Sometimes a good test for whether something is a sin or not is whether you would be proud to tell others what you had just done. If it is something you would be embarrassed or ashamed about if others found out, it is very likely that it is a sin. Another good test is to determine whether we can honestly, in good conscience, ask God to bless and use the particular activity for His own good purposes. I do not think masturbation qualifies as something we can be "proud" of or can genuinely thank God for.<br>  <br>   <br>  <br>  The Bible teaches us, "Whether therefore ye eat, or drink, or whatsoever ye do, do all to the glory of God" (1 Corinthians 10:31). If there is room for doubt as to whether it pleases God, then it is best to give it up. There is definitely room for doubt in regards to masturbation. "For whatsoever is not of faith is sin" (Romans 14:23). I do not see how, according to the Bible, masturbation could be considered glorifying to God. Further, we need to remember that our bodies, as well as our souls, have been redeemed and belong to God. "What? know ye not that your body is the temple of the Holy Ghost which is in you, which ye have of God, and ye are not your own? For ye are bought with a price; therefore glorify God in your body, and in your spirit, which are God's" (1 Corinthians 6:19-20). This great truth should have a real bearing on what we do and where we go with our bodies. So, in light of these principles, I would definitely have to say that masturbation is a sin according to the Bible. I do not believe that masturbation is pleasing to God, avoids the appearance of immorality, or passes the test of God having ownership over our bodies.<br>  <br>  Recommended Resources:  Men - Every Young Man's Battle : Strategies for Victory in the Real World of Sexual Temptation by Stephen Arterburn.<br>  <br>  Women - Every Young Woman's Battle: Guarding Your Mind, Heart, and Body in a Sex-Saturated World by Shannon Ethridge.|`|zCXy2Maaaa	I don't know about girls, but all boys start masurbating from the age of about 12 onwards, whether they be christian or not, it is a perfectly healthy and natural part of adolescence and should be accepted as part of being a normal teenage boy. It is immoral to make teenage boys feel guilty, it often leads to confusion and sometimes depression and mental illness. For a teenage boy, a good "****" a couple of times a day is quite normal and good for his physical and emotional wellbeing. Teenage boys often masturbate together. Masturbation is a practice that should also be encouraged as part of a relationship, mutual masturbation between a dating couple is a great means of contraception, no chance of getting pregnant or catching any unwanted diseases. Even after marriage, mutual masturbation and/or oral sex between a husband and wife should be promoted as a preferred method of contraception as this practice is safe and a very rewarding experience. All sex education should promote the benefits of masturbation and oral sex as it is not neccesary for sexual intercourse for a couple to have a satisfying sex life. So to answer your question, no, masturbation isn't bad, it's actually good for you.

26c591a956329768fa906dac1ca296f9aa	Jihad is an arabic word derived from a root word 'juhd' which means struggle. Jihad is any struggle made by muslims to flurish Islam, Jihad has various kinds. Stuggle against poverty by using wealth is 'Jihad bil maal'. similarly jihad is also against eradication of illetracy and so one. 'Jihad bil saif'<br>   means struggle with sword. It is jihad with sword that is mostly known throughout the world either due to media or whatever else. In Islam Jihad bil Saif is defensive and not offensive, Islam doesnt encourages killing of innocent people and killing for occupying wealth or killing just to convert people by force to Islam. This is a misconception about Jihad and Islam, People quote stories of Historic wars of Islam, all those wars were defensive. Secondly during every Battle The Holy Prophet himself declared not to kill children, women, old, and disabled. not to damage property of the people and not to harm anyone who is in his home(not participating in the battle or for the sake of protection). Jihad is the most misunderstood concept in the current world|`|et8dSK2raa	I WONDER IF ITS REALLY IN ISLAM JUST THE WAY THE TERRORISTS SAY OR IF THEY HAVE DISTORTED IT FOR THIER PURPOSE.

Then, Jesus made a miracle to Paul, and Paul believed on. After became a Christian, Saulo of Tarsus prosecuted and killed the Christian, but God, knowing all about the culture of Saulo (born in Rome, cultured by the Greeks and Jewdish for Religion), God knew that Paul was the perfect man to evangelized Greece (Tesalonica, Corintum, Phillipo), Rome and the Jews, God decides to convert Saulo in Paul, to called Paul to evangelized. Paul spoke Latin, Jewdish and Coine (a kind of Greek).<br>  <br>  Today there are a lot of "Saulos", who prosecute de Christian and its doctrines, but God has a time for everyone, a specific time to call us to tell the others how Great is God, so many wonderful things has made for us.<br>  <br>  Thanks for allow me to write this words, there was hard for me because the English is not my Mother Tongue, I hope that you has understood my little words.<br>  <br>  God bless you.<br>  <br>  Tony<br>  Costa Rica

9E4B3Hi1aa	A nice quote:<br>  <br>  Italian is essentially Latin as spoken by people who were shouting at their slaves all the time.<br>  --Benct Philip Jonsson<br>  <br>  I would say that Latin pronunciation is much closer to Spanish, but accent position rules a bit closer to Italian.<br>  <br>  Several methods are used to recreate accents of dead languages. Two main ones are the comparison of various descendant languages (most importantly in this case Spanish and Italian, as these two languages were the least changed from their Latin origins), and the prosody of any poetic works left by the civilisation. The poetic corpus of Latin is rather large, and well-researched, and it gives the most important clues as to the accent rules of Latin.|`|5e5970238832e3fc82dc3925be8b7d02aa	Well, Latin isn't totally dead as far as accents go. Keep in mind that it was kept flowing in the Catholic church for hundreds of years.<br>  <br>  Now, this probably isn't the same way it was spoken by the Romans. Since the fall of Rome, hundreds of years have passed. No language goes that long without being tweaked here and there, unless it is the foundation of all major functions of society (e.g. Arabic)<br>  <br>  Italian, though, can give you a good idea of how it sounds.

NO, porque con la muerte todo se acaba y no nos llevamos nada de nada.<br>  No importa lo que uno diga, piense, o tenga, sin amor de Dios estamos quebrados como vasijas y vacíos interiormente.<br>  Por esto el Se?or Jesús, nos dijo que pongamos por obra su palabra que es como la gasolina del alma.<br>  Ahora te cuento que así como esos ni?os del áfrica, mueren por falta de alimento y mueren por desnutrición, así mismo el alma que no recibe el alimento que es la palabra de Dios acompa?ada de oración, se puede decir que estaremos vivos de cuerpo, pero el espíritu de la persona estará muerto para Dios y nos sentiremos infelices y sin verle sentido a la vida, porque la vida nos la dio Dios a través de nuestros Padres, y por esto debemos ser agradecidos con Dios y por todo cuanto nos ha dado, la vida, el alimento, los cuidados y la protección, tantas cosas por las cuales debemos agradecerle, porque sin él nada somos y como Jesús lo dice en su palabra sin mi nada podéis hacer.<br>  No tendremos paz y todo nos parecerá aburrido y sin esperanza.<br>  Ahora te digo una cosa, que cuando experimentamos el amor de Dios, que mucho más superior al amor entre esposos, novios, padres con hijos o lo contrario, notamos que nuestra vida cambia y llegamos a amar a nuestros semejantes tal como Dios nos ama y desinteresadamente.<br>  La vida sin amor de Dios no tiene sentido, no importa lo que digas, lo que creas, lo que hagas, sin amor estamos en quiebra.  Si quieres ver la respuesta acerca del dinero ve a la Biblia y busca Eclesiastés 5:10-20 que dice: El que ama el dinero, siempre quiere más; el que ama las riquezas, nunca cree tener bastante.Esto es vana ilusión, porque entre más se tiene, más se gasta. ?Y que se gana con tener, aparte de contemplar lo que se tiene? El que trabaja, como poco o mucho, siempre duerme a gusto, al rico, en cambio, sus riquezas no lo dejan dormir. Una cosa realmente lamentable he visto en este mundo: que el amontonar riquezas va en prejuicio de su due?o, pues un mal negocio puede acabar con toda esa riqueza, y si él tiene un hijo, ya no tendrá después nada que dejarle. Y tal como vino a este mundo, así se irá: tan desnudo como cuando nació y sin llevarse nada del fruto de su trabajo. Esto es realmente lamentable: que tal  como vino al mundo, así también se irá. ?Y que sacó de tanto trabajar para nada? Para colmo, toda su vida se la pasó en tinieblas y con muchas molestias, dolores y resentimientos.<br>  He encontrado que lo mejor y más agradable es comer y beber, y disfrutar del fruto de tanto trabajar en este mundo durante la corta vida que Dios nos da, pues eso es lo que nos ha tocado. Por otra parte, a todo aquel a quien Dios da abundantes riquezas, le da también la facultad de comer de ellas y de tomar lo que le corresponde, pues el disfrutar de tanto trabajo viene de parte de Dios. Y como Dios le llena de alegría el corazón, no se preocupa mucho por el curso de su vida.   Otras citas de la Biblia que puedes buscar en tu Biblia  a cerca del dinero son: Eclesiastés 7:12  - ·Eclesiastés 10:19-  Isaías 55:1-  Mateo 25:18-  Mateo 28:12-  Marcos 6:8-  Hechos 8:20-  Hechos 24:26-  1o Timoteo 6:10 que dice así: Porque el amor al dinero es raíz de toda clase de males y hay quienes, por codicia, se han desviado de la fe y han llenado de sufrimientos sus propias vidas.<br>  Mira por ejemplo los personajes que han tenido de todo cuanto han querido y ya no existen, podrá pensar en que situación estaría su alma y donde se podrán encontrar ahora? Hay gente que ve al dinero como un Dios, y otras cosas semejantes y Dios es un Dios celoso que no quiere que amemos más las cosas creadas por él sino que el primer puesto en nuestro corazón debe ser para él y en su misma palabra nos dice "Busca primero el reino de Dios y lo demás se te dará por a?adidura. Las a?adiduras es todo lo que hemos querido tener, casa, carro, bienestar una familia, salud, alegría, paz, estabilidad emocional, sentimental en todas las áreas de nuestra vida y que más nos convenga es lo que Dios nos promete darnos si le amamos a él con todo el corazón. Y para conocer y experimentar el amor de Dios debemos buscarle en la lectura de su palabra y orar la siguiente oración para que puedas experimentar la paz del Se?or y ver cuanto te ama él.<br>  Ora en voz alta la siguiente oración para recibirle en su corazón. Se?or Jesús, hoy te suplico me perdones por todos mis pecados pasados y presentes con los cuales yo te haya ofendido, perdóname por haberte ignorado y el no ser agradecido contigo, hoy quiero invitarte a mi vida para que seas mi due?o, mi Se?or, mi Salvador y hagas de mi la persona que tú quieres que yo sea, escribe mi nombre en el libro de la vida y no lo borres jamás de allí, te lo suplico Padre de nuestro Se?or Jesucristo y por el poder de tu Santo Espíritu. Amén<br>  Te recomiendo alimentar tu espíritu y alma con la lectura de la palabra y mira canales de televisión donde predican su palabra y ense?an con claridad lo que Dios quiere de nosotros y como debemos prepararnos para su 2o venida y no nos halles dormidos espiritualmente, que eso es lo que quiere el diablo o enemigo de Dios y de nosotros y que Dios te bendiga y con todo mi cari?o.

AA11621725	uh, you're going to be a goth because a myspace test told you to? Okay that sounds just a little strange, but whatever. "Those are satan worshipers and they all want to be rockstars." lol absolute greatest description of goth that I've ever heard. As for black ppl being goths, if white ppl can be rappers and Mexican's can say the N-word to asians, then I think anything's possible. All these subcultures are just made up of a bunch of poser's anyway. Just get your mom to give you money and go shopping by yourself. Wear regular clothes over your goth clothes to school and then change in the bathroom when you get there, then change back before you go home.|`|7euKjvG9aa	Don't label, just be yourself.|`|FKtrTGIyaa	Interesting concept.

A true goth is basically someone who recognizes the darker side of life that society shuns or is afraid to talk about, and chooses to embrace and express that darkness to the world around him/her. That's why a goth can be any race, any sex, any gender, any sexual orientation. There's no one way to dress like a goth - though goths may seem to look the same to you, their outfits are made from their own creativity. Wearing black clothes and spiked collars doesn't make you goth; it's your beliefs that make you goth, and you can express those beliefs to the world by the way you dress. The black clothes are usually to explicitly express their acceptance of life's darker sides.|`|tRFzTMHQaa	of course you can be a goth!!! My friend who's black(he's very, very dark skinned), wear Gothic clothes and listens to heavy metal.  His clothes look awesome. He even has a fro hawk. I think he's like the best dressed guy i know.

She also believes that those clothes are bad and etc.(the Satan thing). I can't even wear skull stuff on clothings, sigh. I don't really know how you should get your mom to do that.

The verse in Surah an Nur refers to people committing adultery. The one in Surah al Nisaa refers to only women and "lewdness," it says nothing about adultery. Next verse also refers to 2 men as Yusufali translates. It might be this one refers to homosexual acts or fornication. There is no contradiction in Allaah's Book.    ===================      The translation you are using is that of MuhsinKhan and is in no way a replica of the original Arabic Mushraf. Yusufali has a better translation. {4:15} and {4:16} are 2 different verses as below:  ((If any of your women are guilty of lewdness.....))    ((If two men among you are guilty of lewdness, punish them both. If they repent and amend, Leave them alone; for Allah is Oft-returning, Most Merciful.))    In Arabic, the second ayah does not have a specific gender and does not refer to both sexes as other ayat do when referring to other specifics.  Chapter 24 refers to adultery, why aren't the same Arabic words used in Chapter 4.....Because it is not a contradiction.

This is what we cal when one ayat "nasakhat" the one before it, which means overrides it and becomes the ruling verse. It was at first the punishment for adultery for women to confine them in their homes, etc...Then punishment for both men and women became stoning to death (what you are talking about is fornication for which the punishment is flogging 100 times. Fornication is having sex while unmarried, adultery is sex with someone else other than who you are married to).For reasons best known to Allah he changd the ruling regarding this. The reason is more apparent for the alcohol thing because had he said from the get go "do not drink alcohol" it would have been very hard for the Arabs to follow His command (they were very big drinkers back then). But He made them give it up in stages and it worked...Hope this helps! Allah knows best...|`|w9hzZSiNaa	I have no idea.

Pro-life means we believe that life begins at conception.    That's the fundamental difference between the two factions.  You cannot really be pro-choice if you believe that life begins at conception, or you would have to be a horrible person, willing to allow someone to destroy a human life, in fact voting to give them the power to destroy a human life.    Also fascism is an absolute insult!!!!  HOW DARE YOU!  And you are ignorant of the definition of fascism.  America is now fascist, but not in the way you understand the term. We are living in fascist times because the government is in callusion with corporatism.  The government supports corporations, not the people.  That's the definition of fascism.

It is a woman's body and if she wants to kill her baby because she does not want to be burdened with the responsibility of a life, the law says she has the right. That will never change.   I just don't want my tax dollars used in the medicaid (welfare) programs used to kill babies.   If a woman wants to kill her unborn baby the law says yes. Why are we  required to sugar coat the act and make it sound like she is getting a cosmetic procedure done? Pro-choice makes it sound like you are trying to decide if you want fries with that.  It is what it is.....|`|TSCfQTw3aa	Because no matter how you want to word it, pro-life is just that. We support a child's right to live. Pro-choice is saying that murder is a valid choice. I believe that everyone has choices, but I do not believe that those choices should not come with consequences. If a person murders another person it is called murder, this person goes to prison and in some cases gets the death penalty (which I support! Just because I believe in protecting innocent life does not mean that I protect a murderer's right to life, the murderer has forfeited that right when they chose to take the life of another human being.) The problem with being pro-choice is you are giving a legal right for a person to kill another person without consequences. Murder is a crime, abortionists and woman choosing to sign away the life of their unborn child to an abortionist should be put in prison, with the possibility of the death penalty like every other criminal.|`|RTaimrg7aa	Anti-choice misrepresents the views of those who are anti-abortion just as much as Pro-abortion does.The same goes for anti-murder, and perhaps any other term you could use.

AA11297267	Honestly, I'd have to disagree with you.  I think it *is* a subject for public debate -- I just wish the public were more informed and less driven by dogma and superstition in many cases.    We as a society have already decided that killing a human being without justification (such as being in fear of your life) should be illegal and punishable by law.  Since abortion is the termination of what might someday become a human being, it's a valid subject for public debate to try and decide if the rules that apply to killing a human being apply to terminating a pregnancy.      Most reasonable people clearly agree that an undifferentiated clump of cells a few weeks old is *not* a human being.  Most reasonable people also agree that clearly an 8-month old fetus, which if removed from its mother can survive on its own outside of the womb, *is* a human being.  It's in between those two that things are open to debate.  If you approach the question dogmatically from either side, you're not contributing in any constructive way to the debate...    I think we *should* give science a large voice in determining facts that we can use to inform our debate.  When is an embryo's nervous system developed enough to sense and register and really feel pain?  When is an embryo really viable outside the womb?  What science do we use to define "human being," and how does that same definition get mapped to developing embryos?  These are all valid questions, and can help us arrive at socially acceptable solutions that are backed by real evidence and science, and not by dogma.    The current situation is a compromise -- I happen to think it's a good one.  Abortion is always legal within the first trimester.  From my point of view, that's enough time for a woman to know she's pregnant and have a reasonable time to make a decision, but it's a short enough time such that there's really no question that what's being aborted is not a "human being" as we define it.  (the "potential human being" arguments have no merit -- I have the potential to be the best concert pianist in the world, but it's by no means certain that will ever happen.  We don't base law on all possible outcomes of a potential situation).    Honestly though, if science after thorough research and showing good evidence were to conclude that at 3 months an embryo can feel real pain, could live outside of the womb, and has any sentience at all, then I would be in favor of shortening the time abortions should always be legal.  I would take that stance because I believe that human beings should have the protection of the law against unwarranted killing.  By the same token, if science shows us that none of the defintions of "human being" are ever met until after the 6th month, I would be in favor of increasing the time that abortion should be legal.    Any decision is a tightrope between the rights of the certain human being who is the mother, and the rights of what's in her body that may someday be a human being.  For me, when the embryo is unquestionably a human being, it deserves the protection of the law.  So let's answer the question of when it's a human being to the best of our ability, then we can make a more informed decision.    Peace.|`|WO1jgqWqaa	What a wonderful defeatist attitude. By your logic we should either go sweep murder, rape,  etc  under the rug and pretend they don't happen or legalize them and have the government regulate them rather than punished. According to your line of thought, society is never going to regress to the point where murder, rape, theft, or any other such crimes will no longer be commited so why not make them legal? According to you, all anti-murderer opponents, all anti-rape opponants, all anti-theft opponents are doing is just increasing guilt, shame remorse and fear ins society?

To blame the people who only want to save children from being slaughtered for the guilt that comes with the slaughter of your own child is ridiculous. Yes there are emotions involved in abortion, that is your soul telling you what a horrible sin you have committed. Abortion is not a necessary evil. Abortion is just evil that has been legalized to allow people to avoid consequences for their actions. Have you ever seen an abortion performed? To say that ripping a tiny human being apart for your own selfish reasons is okay and then have the nerve to blame the people trying to show you the truth is immature at best.

S6MqrWdjaa	It seems like the opposite black woman are the freakiest and they like manly men.     Then again alot of them dont suckdick so that might be why they are seen as conservative.|`|nE15oNjBaa	Hell no. Black women are not conservative.  Please! I am a black woman, i would know!    We are just like any other woman.    Edit: I like being the Bad Girl too Qwerty.|`|e8lAALzgaa	No I don't agree with her. Unless she's in the bedroom with every black woman then she has no place to make such comments.    Maybe she's speaking for herself. She surely isn't speaking for me.|`|AA10698792	Who the heck is Jackie Reed and if she is using banal terminology like "freaky" and "get their freak" on, I wouldn't put much store in anything she says.|`|p8nDiI3Vaa	I totally disagree with her. Black women don't do that because of their history and covenant that they've have over many centuries with God. It was until recently of about a little over 40 years and maybe less than that they have been doing things that are not natural because of influences by white women. Alot of males nowadays wants them to perform gross oral acts and stuff like that but its not natural. A penis was designed to enter only into the vaginal area and not any other holes of the body. Blacks as a whole should not be freaks like that. This is why Sodom and Gomorrah  were destroyed. The white race has had a bad influence all over the world. No offense white people but let's face it you've messed this world up.|`|8646d0557adda18475a92d81c0df1711aa	it depends on your definition of "freak"" i remember i asked some black guys what qualifies someone to be called a freak....you know some of them said... giving head....and i thought to myself....thats it????|`|8lNWNxmQaa	There's no way to be sure of this...Studies have shown that blacks are the most religious group in America.

V7I0qtvCaa	La differenza principale è nel colore della pelle: i giapponesi ce l'hanno più chiara, mentre i cinesi sono più olivastri. E poi sì, gli occhi, le persone giapponesi ce li hanno più grandi e meno allungati, la palpebra è meno schiacciata. Il viso dei cinesi è più tondo rispetto a quello dei giapponesi. <br>  Hai visto "Lussuria"? Puoi facilmente notare la differenza fra Tang Wei e Chiaki Kuriyama, l'attrice di Kill Bill Volume 1 (faceva Gogo).<br>  Oppure Lucy Liu, di origini cinesi e Ryoko Hirosue di Wasabi, di Besson. <br>  Hong Kong Express è uno dei miei film preferiti. Puoi vedere la differenza fra Wang Fei - l'attrice che indossa sempre l'impermeabile e gli occhiali da sole, perchè vuole essere sempre pronta, per il buono e il cattivo tempo - e Nanako Matsushima (del film The Ring).<br>  <br>  Riguardo agli "insulti", non credo che molte persone in Nord Europa riuscirebbero a riconoscere un biondo finlandese da uno svedese.|`|XeZGOWb2aa	ci sono delle leggere differenze che noi non riusciamo a percepire, a causa della nostra visione un pò generale degli orientali... onestamente non saprei distinguere un giapponese da un coreano o un cinese da un vietnamita<br>  ma tra di loro si distinguono benissimo, più o meno come noi riconosciamo uno slavo, o uno scandinavo, siamo tutti caucasici ma ci sono delle piccole differenze tra noi e un tedesco o tra uno spagnolo e un ceco.

Lo que haga de su cuerpo es cosa suya y nadie tiene derecho a faltarle el respeto, por más "provocativa" que se presente. Y lo pongo entre comillas pues como que se confunde el que se vista explotando sus atributos y por ello provoca emociones de diversa índole, con provocar, incitar a alguien -como bien dijiste, mal del coco- a hacerle algo. Saludos amigo.Y sí, los hombres también pueden desatar emociones de toda índole. |`|Vl5EOom9aa	.. de vdd tu crees q si una mujer se pasea desnuda por ahi, nadie la va a tomar x la fuerza???!!<br>  El pecado no es q una mujer sea atractiva fisicamente sino la finalidad con q ella lo haga, es decir, si la mujer lo hace con el fin de q un hombre la desee, entonces esta provocando q el peke, xq? xq biblicamente: es pecado desear al projimo.  x lo tanto peca ella y lo hace pecar a el.<br>  <br>  Pero si una mujer se viste asi solo xq le gusta verse bien, esta bien.|`|XEuiaz6uaa	me encanta una mujer asi!!! deberiamos serlo todas!!!!hay que ver las opiniones tan rastreras que tienen muxa gente, te das cuenta amor??? ellos verian bien entonces que a mi me violaran!! que fuerte!!!<br>  cada vez me enamoran mas tus preguntas, te voy conociendo un poquito mas y me gusta....besos sensuales, eróticos y provocativos que te los mereces lindo!!!|`|869cdbd9847b5907414175aa1fed41e1aa	Así es Manson.

No todas las religiones son tan drásticas y cerradas. <br>  Las sensualidad y la provocación nacen de la mente de la persona y lo manifiesta por medio del lenguaje corporal. No es una característica propia y única de la mujer.<br>  <br>  Y tu ejemplo de las mini ... muy cierto... es como si no pudiéramos salir a la calle con unas pulseritas y aretitos de oro porque estamos dando pié a que nos asalten.<br>  Sin embargo Manson...  en estos tiempos no podemos darnos el lujo de andar vestidos con lujos por los barrios donde se juntan las pandillas. Igual con la mini... una mujer si tiene tantito cerebro, no andara exhibiéndose en mini por esa clase de lugares. Y sin embargo con todo y todo.... no es motivo alguno para que sufra un ataque o una violación o que se le acuse de haber provocado a los hombres.<br>  <br>  <br>  Cuídate y feliz día<br>  Silverstar : )|`|Z36ySvsnaa	Las religiones abrahámicas son misóginas (judaísmo, islam y cristianismo), por eso culpan a las mujeres de ser provocativas y de ser las culpables cuando son víctimas de violación.<br>  Lo bueno de todo esto es que basta con pensar un poco para darse cuenta de la estupidez de esos argumentos. Lo malo es que hay gente que no se toma la molestia de pensar ni un poco.|`|c0e8c39b82a18a37f321b41849d7301eaa	Si una mujer es provocativa y sensual, pues bien por ella, y por el tipo afortunado.<br>  <br>  Y aunque no te guste un violador también pudo ser víctima, lamentablemente hay personas que no ven más que los hechos. Sí supiéramos bien su pasado nos encontraríamos el por qué de su comportamiento. Y como dice la canción, el pasado ya no interesa.<br>  <br>  Pero bueno, no te culpo, además de que somos capaces sentir empatía por otros, también solemos ser acusadores y jueces. Irónico, ?verdad?<br>  <br>  Saludos|`|Cx02rYIaaa	La mujer,religiosamente, simboliza el pecado y la tentación hacia lo carnal.<br>  Por otro lado, la mujer,aún hoy, inconsciente se la toma como: mujer = propiedad, como objeto de satisfacción para el hombre.<br>  De hecho suele utilizarse mujer "provocativa"( que provoca, incoscientemente lo afirmamos) y sin embargo un hombre es mas común decir q es  "atractivo" para denotar su belleza o guapura, aún cuando por su vestimenta por ejemplo sería igualmente decir q es "provocativo".<br>  Un saludo|`|msr7opliaa	Porque prefieren eludir el problema real, que es la falta de educación y el irrespeto hacia el sexo femenino, a nosotras se nos juzga duramente si vivimos libremente nuestra sexualidad y la disfrutamos sin estar casadas, pero al hombre hasta lo felicitan y le dicen casanova. Pero parte de la culpa es de nosotras por dejarnos y darles la razón a los que critican injustamente a mujeres y a hombres no, estoy de acuerdo contigo.|`|544872447274c5c6b945b24f05ad3a88aa	Que estoy totalmente de acuerdo con vos, y que opino que una mujer sea sensual? Que me da una envidia bárbara, y que los hombres son deseados tanto o más que las mujeres, que el abuso es una cuestión de poder y que no tiene que ver con el deseo sexual. |`|K0tEwuSoaa	Que vivan las chicas provocativas! (especialmente si usan gafas ;D)<br>  <br>  Y los hombres sensuales y provocativos también... aunque yo no sea su público objetivo. ;)|`|MPIMt8Kmaa	Que de esas, los religiosos piden su limosna. :-PPPP|`|R9bzrJ4paa	Estoy de acuerdo contigo, la mujer tiene el derecho de vestirse como quiera, nadie debe de agredirla por usar una minifalda, casualmente son las mismas mujeres (generalmente las feas)quienes justifican la agresión de una mujer que esté más bella que ellas. No hay nada tan atractivo que mirar a una mujer sensual caminando por las calles (y no quiero mezclar belleza con sensualidad, una mujer puede ser poco atractiva, pero puede ser sensual , puede sacarle partido a su físico sea este de acuerdo a los patrones de belleza o no). Afortunadamente todos estamos de acuerdo en que vivimos en sociedades democráticas donde cada quien tiene el derecho de creer o no y de vestirse como quiera, sino estaríamos compartiendo la ideología de sociedades como la iraní, la saudita, la vaticana, donde hay represión en todo lo sexual. viva Occidente y su libertad individual????? <br>  <br>  Ojitos verdes: tienes toda la boca llena de razón....|`|LoDQIctWaa	Estoy completamente de acuerdo contigo, pues las mujeres son libres de vestirse y ser como les plazca, y eso incluye lo que mencionaste.<br>  <br>  Además, a los hombres nos encantan las mujeres así, sin embargo no es motivo para decir que ellas nos provocan, pues simplemente es su naturaleza y gusto ser asi.<br>  <br>  Bien por la gente que piensa como tu.<br>  <br>  Saludos!!!|`|d54ee05d142e610fe6f21e387d115ed2aa	En el Islam, los hombres también tienen ciertas restricciones respecto a la vestimenta, y no solo las mujeres. Lo que pasa es que eso no hay quien lo difunda por desgracia y la gente se lleva una idea errónea. Una cosa son los derechos de la gente, y otra que todos lo cumplan, nadie tiene derecho a tomar su cuerpo, pero quien asegura que todo el mundo respete eso. No toda la gente se preocupa de los demás, hay gente que es egoísta y solo se preocupa de satisfacer sus propios deseos.<br>  Además, el físico no lo es todo, que hay de lo interior? el Islam, intenta resaltar lo interior de las personas. El Islam pretende que a la gente se la valore por su interior y no por el exterior. <br>  No toda la gente tiene un físico impresionante, que hay de los que no lo tienen? Si lo que se valora es la imagen, a esa gente se la discriminaría, y de hecho eso ya pasa actualmente. Las normas de vestimenta del Islam, tanto las de los hombres como las de las mujeres ( que por cierto no son tan extremas como los medios hacen aparentar, aunque haya alguna gente que lo lleve a los extremos) son porque a la gente no se la trate de una manera u otra por el aspecto, que no se trate mejor a las personas mas agraciadas que las que no lo sean tanto, para que no se infravalore la persona en si.<br>  Yo, desde mi punto de vista lo veo razonable. Pero cada uno tiene su opinión.|`|val23qvpaa	Recuerda que vivimos en una sociedad falica, donde dios es hombre y si el es lo bueno debe de existir una dualidad que por consiguiente nos presenta a la mujer como mala.<br>  <br>  pero todo esto se deriva de los a?os donde las mujeres tenian el poder y el conociemiento con deidades femeninas, entonces el hombre mando al mundo femenino a la oscuridad y a lo masculino a la luz.<br>  <br>  Pero bueno los que piensan que las culpables son las mujeres estan mal y los que piensan que los hombres son los culpables estan igual, la culpa no tiene genero. <br>  <br>  Cada quien es culpable de sus acciones|`|8K8Aa7h4aa	opino lo mismo, lo que pasa que nuestra educación es muy machista desde el momento que un ni?o llora le dicen no llores, solo lloran las viejas y esa ense?anza viene particularmente de las mujeres, nuestra educación machista nos hace ver a la mujer como un objeto y buscas la satisfacción propia, aunque en esta actualidad las chicas ya no son sensuales son provocativas y en muchas situaciones ellas son las que buscan que les falten al respeto recuerda que el hombre llega hasta donde la mujer quiere, aunque tengas la religión que tengas puedes encontrar a un patán que le falte al respeto solo por que se le dio la gana tocarla o gritar le cosas en la calle aunque no valla provocativa en conclusión no todas las mujeres se dan a respetar y no todos lo hombres las saben respetar es recíproco|`|b899ca04b6204b0ad6e4b5970500b28faa	Yo te doy la razón, y realmente no entiendo a esas personas que le echan la culpa a la mujer por la ropa que trae.

However it was MEMBERS that donated their time and money, not the actual church. The "church" did nothing illegal to cause the exempt status to be taken away. Why aren't you going after the Catholics or the other numerous churches?<br>  <br>  Why should we stop being allowed to perform marriages? That's part of the reason why it was important to have prop 8 pass! We were threatened with lawsuits!|`|rI6xYwhcaa	1. Making the mormons pay taxes puts all other religius organizations pay taxes, even ones with  no history of violent bias. My little pagan group aint rich anyway....<br>  <br>  2. This is a good idea.

We don't hesitate to boycott other nations if they don't do what we want.  It doesn't establish a dictatorship.  The counterquestion is why should we continue to do business with those who use religion to mask discrimination?  Why should the GLBT community do business with those who hate them?  People can vote however they want.  That's the beauty of our governmental system.  The rest of the nation doesn't have to like it and doesn't have to contribute money to it.  That's the beauty of the First Amendment and the Free Market system.|`|3bc6709f9978822792e144f5259dd14baa	Nothing. <br>  <br>  They were within their rights to support this ballot issue and their tax exempt status was never in any way jeopardized.  <br>  <br>  What do you think should happen to the organizations who funded and fought prop 8?  |`|8Ak1FehYaa	IF your God made you t he way that you are then have faith THAT GOD IS IN CONTROL!!! and the mormon churhc is not.

The Mormon church was not the ones funding the yes on prop 8. It was it's members and members of many other churches and also those who do not affiliate with any church. It is not just a religious debate for everyone. Yet you impose that it is. If you take away the tax exempt status from the "Mormons" then you need to take it away from every church that had a member put money towards yes on 8. If this is your stance then we need to stop funding public schools. We, those that own homes like myself, pay property taxes and that goes to our public schools. That money gets handed out to our teachers who in turn pay their unions. The Teachers Union spent $1 MILLION dollars, our tax money, on fighting this proposition. That is $1 MILLION more than the "Mormon" church. <br>  <br>  Lose their ability to marry? Wasn't it Government that stepped in and started doing marriages after religions, because my records show that religions have been performing marriages for millenniums (that's a lot longer than centuries). <br>  <br>  Boycotting?  HA!!  So childish. "He voted and exercised his right to voice his opinion on something and I don't agree. Huh. I'm never going to eat from his restaurant again." See how stupid that is. If we can't all agree with you then we shouldn't associate with each other (separatist)?<br>  <br>  To single out one group of religion for the right to exercise freedom of speech and the right to vote seems like bigotry to me. But what do I know your just going to say that I am an uneducated homophobic hate mongering bigot.  |`|OyBuEpOTaa	what should happen is not an issue. There would be a wide split in the church, because many of their men may wish to practice polygamy again. (which was and is a total disaster). The Morman church would want prop 8 to pass into law. The marriage between ONE man and ONE woman is important to them, as they do not want polygamy again.|`|dc00e6f724cc094e75dc0475843d0e44aa	Other:<br>  <br>  Be allowed to vote their conscience in this democratic country, without undemocratic pressure to vote how the opposition would have them vote.  <br>  Isn't that a tenet of this land of the free?<br>  <br>  <br>  Such lawsuits and legal wranglings would really set a precedent for future referendums.    Either vote one way or you get punished.  Now that would ruin democracy.|`|b660102b2fc9513dd1125d9410450d92aa	There should not be anything done unto them. They are only a small fraction of the people who voted for Prop. 8. Judging by the numbers of voters if you boycotted or sanctioned all those who voted for Prop 8, it would send California into financial ruin. You do not punish voters for voting how they honestly feel. Are you trying to endorse a dictatorship by only allowing one way to vote and persecute those who do not vote the way you want them too. It is what they do in some countries, isn't it....|`|DqtSdgtPaa	I think they should lose their tax-exempt.  Then again I don't agree with any church having tax-exemption in the first place.|`|AA10637643	Uh, nothing.  All of a sudden we can't stand up for what we believe to be right?

Church people have the right to vote and send money to causes just like anyone else.  I think the tax exempt status should not be subject to anything they wish to say from the pulpit, either.  That was a bad idea, and it's a government intrusion into religion.  Of course, all anyone seems to care about is religion or religious people getting into politics, not the government trying to control religion.  That is the real problem.  We have it backwards from the way the founding fathers wrote the Constitution.|`|AA10752795	A better question is: What should we do with all of these bigoted and uniformed Yahoo Answers users?<br>  <br>  Proposition 8 would not and should not have even had to occur. Three liberal judges took it upon themselves to overturn the voice of the people of CA when they overturned Proposition 22 that had passed in CA eight years earlier with a 61% majority. This is still a democracy when last I checked.<br>  <br>  The mormons were a small part of a huge coalition of people from different religions, political groups, and there are even "gaysfor8". Furthermore, mormons make up less than 2% of the population and were in no way responsible for passing Prop 8. They supported it, but the people of California passed it. Singling out Mormons is no more than targeting the easiest and most distrusted group at hand to be the scape goats.<br>  <br>  The LDS church should not be penalized in any way because they did not break any laws. Donations of time and money came from individual members of the Church, not from the church itself. This is a very big distinction. <br>  <br>  It is our civic duty to be actively involved in politics at all levels of the government. The Bill of Rights protects our Freedom to support Proposition 8. Some people seem to think that freedom of speech only applies if you want to protect internet pornography, gay marriages, and other liberal non-sense. <br>  <br>  Just look at how those for Prop 8 behaved compared to those opposing it. Those in favor of Prop 8 peacefully held signs, went door to door, posted signs, and made phone calls. Look at how those opposed to Prop 8 have behaved. They shouted vulgarities at the opposing view point, tore signs down, rioted, threatened violence, vandalized, and are now calling for the Mormon church to be punished.<br>  <br>  You folks need a reality check.|`|sE382CcTaa	Let's think about what we are saying. If Prop 8 was voted down how would we react if people were asking or demanding that gay and lesbian groups: (1) lose their tax-exempt status, or (2) lose their ability to perform legal marraiges.  Or that we organize to boycott businesses owned by gays and lesbians.<br>  <br>  Don't forget that our democracy allows people of a group (sexual, political or religious) to voice their opinion and to donate money and time to further their cause.<br>  <br>  I'm amazed by the protests and attacks on the mormon people by another group of people who constantly claim that they are discriminated against and their rights taken.  It sounds like that is what we are doing by entertaining this question.<br>  <br>  I'm even more shocked by the suggestions on the blogs like "Burn their f--king churches to the ground, and then tax the charred timbers."  <br>  <br>  Homophobia has turned into to mormophobia.  This yahoo question smacks of terrible hypocricy.|`|APjnSYKuaa	I think public opinion is doing pretty good already. I know I had a much higher opinion of the Mormons before this, and I'm not even homosexual. They put themselves dangerously close to the run of the mill evangelical fundies with this move. Pretty much "Moral Majority" stuff.<br>  <br>  <br>  The tax thing sounds good, too.|`|ifvHIpZ8aa	Well, consider that we were not the ONLY church that supported this proposition. Therefore, whatever sanctions you want on us, you want on ALL churches. <br>  <br>  The LDS  church, from what I understand, didn't donate much, if any, money to the cause. It was all donated by members of the church. <br>  <br>  The church encourages people to get involved in the political process. But, we aren't the ONLY ones to do so. In fact, from what I understand, it was the blacks and latinos who put the thing over the top. What are you going to do? Go to Compton or East LA and boycott their businesses? That I'd like to see. <br>  <br>  What about the other churches that supported Prop 8? The Catholic church? No, I bet there are too many gay Catholics for that. Playing Cleopatra, queens of denial. And the evangelicals are too fractured to make any sort of statement to them. And of course, they all don't like the Mormons, either, right? Mormons make easy targets. <br>  <br>  And if you want to blame anyone, blame Barak Obama. From waht I understand, it was the blacks and the latinos that mostly voted FOR prop 8. And you know it wasn't the MORMONS who got the BLACK vote out! Why not go and picket the White House? Why don't they lose tax exempt status? If they have it. <br>  <br>  And the others here are right. We can't impose OUR morality on you, but you can force yours down our throats? That sounds fair. <br>  <br>  Not.<br>  <br>  edit: another thing I heard, during a discussion about why blacks voted overwhelmingly for libral Barak Obama, and FOR prop 8; supposedly, blacks are not happy with the way gays are comparing their "suffering" for civil rights with the blacks. And you know, they're right. Blacks don't choose to be black. they didn't choose to be slaves. They didn't choose to be treated as second class citizens. <br>  <br>  Gays choose their sexual activity. They maybe can't choose their feelings, but they can choose how they act on it. They can also choose to accept that the state of California voted to make marriage between a man and a woman, and not between two people of hte same sex. The no on 8 group raised almost $2million more than those for 8. Why couldn't they get more supporters to come to the polls and vote the way they wanted?|`|OI5neJB3aa	Nothing- <br>  Did the Mormons break any law? The homosexual community was defeated by democracy not the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints. In a country based on religious freedom it would be a shame for us to stand back and watch one our (Christ's) values be disgraced when we can do something about it. Homosexuality disgraces God's sacred gift of procreation. I'm grateful to be a part of a church who stands for what they believe, and for what's right. |`|AA11985487	Nothing.

NBN9SFHZaa	La importancia y el significado del hiyab es diferente según el medio sociocultural de que se trate y según la época histórica. Aunque actualmente se fundamenta su uso en el islam, no es algo específicamente islámico: en muchas partes del mundo las mujeres cubren la mayor parte de su cuerpo, incluida la cabeza, por razones análogas a las esgrimidas por los musulmanes, y en la totalidad del Mediterráneo ha sido práctica generalizada hasta tiempos muy recientes. Dentro de la cultura árabe, hay que decir que el hiyab existía ya en la Arabia preislámica como signo de respetabilidad, pues entre otras cosas distinguía a las mujeres libres de las esclavas..-|`|AA12246142	según yo,  es algo sacado del Corán, el cual recomienda expresamente a las mujeres conducirse con recato y pudor. aunque la verdad no sé si la costumbre de cubrirse el pelo venga mencionada como tal en los textos sagrados musulmanes ó sea solo una costumbre heredada y milenaria que tiene que ver con que vienen de un lugar extremadamente seco y caluroso.|`|WNZXFSq1aa	en la otra pregunta identica a esta te di mi respuesta..<br>  saludos.

I grew up in the 50's and we had all the insulting names and 'backs to the wall' jokes.<br>  <br>  Education and natural maturing have gone some way to making most of my generation realise that homophobia is no more realistic than Africa being populated by cannibals, even though we were taught that in every book we read.|`|MVcvIiiaaa	I think they are both; made and born. <br>  Now, dont get me wrong, some of my very best friends are gay, but homosexuality is not exactly a natural thing, unless you are a hermaphrodite. Think about it, a man is wired as a man even though he is gay. They just prefer men. Which they are totally entitled to. But my point is, naturally, a straight man may be grossed out by a man kissing another man because it is not how we are wired-a man has a penis and a woman has a vagina. So naturally speaking, it is not how it is naturally supposed to be. Its psychological. But Love is a different thing though. <br>  And of course, unfortuatly, they are made. People who are not entitled to see the world through their own eyes, and are pressured to believe what their condescending parents and leaders force them to believe. Keeping them ignorant of reality.|`|c30e7d5dc21c881fa2b4e10f9ca03ee5aa	i have no problem with a persons sexual preference (each to their own) but i cant stand those guys who act really camp and are always the loudest. I just think they are like daffif from little britain, they just want the reaction so that they can jump up and accuse someone of being homophobic. And its not really homophobia, its 'annoyingattentionseekingd**kheadphobia'|`|HvIS1Mk1aa	It's genetic.<br>  <br>  I was born like it.<br>  <br>  Mind, I don't like to see a man and a woman kissing and "making out" either.<br>  <br>  Whatever happened to keeping it private and behind closed doors?<br>  <br>  Sheesh!|`|Cu0zrPWDaa	Made, just like racism|`|2u5m2MnTaa	I think a bit of both. I believe some people are truly and naturally disgusted by it, and even they don't know why (probably nature telling them it's not for them), and some become homophobes because of what they pick up from others.<br>  <br>  There has always been homophobia, even in cultures where it was generally accepted like in Ancient Greece.|`|GjLmdDU4aa	they are taught!<br>  <br>  A song from "South Pacific",  Rodgers and Hammerstein musical says it best:<br>  "you've got to be taught to hate and fear"<br>  you've got to be taught year to year<br>  it's got to be drummed in your dear little ear'<br>  You've got to be carefully taught!"<br>  <br>  You've got to be taught before its too late <br>  before you are six or seven or eight<br>  to hate all the people your relatives hate<br>  you've got to be carefully taught!"|`|57695d6cd2bdf46926c92c61db0be293aa	Ouch Ouch Ouch,well i hope it wasn't Evil being whacked into me that converted me to the position of a non-Homosexual. <br>  Plus i am anti-homosexuality but i am not a Homophobe, i am COMPLETELY and UTTERLY AGAINST THE ACTIVITY known as HOMOSEXUAL BEHAVIOUR.<br>  <br>  I really do believe homosexuality is wrong and does damage to the person as a human body, physically and mentally.<br>  Science woul never suggest such a thing. But there are reasons beyond it just being fashionable.<br>  I am a christian so i am able to be HONEST and IMPARTIAL COMPLETELY about my OPINIONS and BELIEFS. <br>  <br>  I AM NOT JEALOUS NOR AM I CURIOUS ABOUT HOMOSEXUAL BEHAVIOUR.<br>  It is as simple as that. <br>  Jesus saves.<br>  <br>  I thin it is extremely distructive for you to say that anti-homosexuals are nurtured homophobes, what you are implying is so destructive i do not think you care.<br>  i am shocked at your suggestion and am worried for the children.<br>  <br>  We Should Get Over This Idea That Homosexuality Is Trendy Now. It Is Not Enough  Of A Reason TO Allow The Teaching So Much Influence In Society. It Is Not Good To Pander To Such Issues As You Are Raising. Your Point Is Irrelavant In My View/<br>  You Are Suggesting Mental/Psychological Torture.<br>  People and relationships are a mindfield or a mindmash as it is, People get screwed over so much, a burden and scar for many, many do not recover and some kill/rape and pilage.<br>  It is odd really, sex is not love but look at it...<br>  Look at what it turns into when the world goes its own way with it....<br>  God invented sex, you are doing it wrong.Simple.<br>  Sex for Marriage. <br>  <br>  Blessings.|`|pElUypT2aa	Their is no such phobia as homophobia. It is a word invented by the liberal left to make out that anyone with a natural disgust at gay sex acts is in the wrong and mentally ill and make discussion of that alternative valid view to be out of the question.|`|W8iDn9hhaa	made. we ccan always change our views by developping a better understanding. lots of homophobes looking at this question, i see<br>  <3|`|AA11308841	made unfortunately|`|bd89db95a8636a616e42896cf49b6a87aa	They are made.  Homophobia is a choice that can be changed.|`|Qz3UAg6xaa	It is put into their heads by their parents. No one is born with and instinct to hate someone else it has to be taught to you. Of course it can also come from other sources I'm not just blaming the parents here. It can come from friends and other relatives who think things are wrong. |`|5dhYnpjqaa	Oh yes - I blame religion and the indoctrination at a young age by their parents and parish.<br>  Most people when they leave their cloud and experience the real world, begin to realise gays aren't that bad as they were lead to believe.|`|t9ysOZs5aa	Their anti-gay values are passed through generations.

ece66e0213fe7f7b8f07912dd83d997caa	AMAR A DIOS POR SOBRE TODAS LAS COSAS Y AL PROJIMO COMO A SI MISMO.<br>  <br>  Un día un hombre preguntó a Jesús: Maestro, ? cuál es el mandamiento mayor de la ley ?<br>  él le dijo: <br>  Amarás al Se?or tu Dios con todo tu corazón, con toda tu alma y con toda tu mente y AMARáS A TU PRóJIMO COMO A TI MISMO. No existe otro mandato mayor que éste.<br>  En este folleto queremos platicarte lo que significa amar a tu prójimo en la vida práctica   <br>  <br>   <br>  <br>  Lo primero que tienes que preguntarte es:<br>  <br>  ? QUIéN ES MI PRóJIMO?<br>  <br>  Mi prójimo es toda la gente del mundo. <br>  Mi prójimo es mi esposo, mi esposa, mis hijos, los suegros, los parientes, los amigos, los vecinos, los de mi pueblo, los del pueblo de junto, mis compa?eros de trabajo, mis empleados, mi jefe. Mi prójimo es también, los que no me caen bien, los que me han hecho alguna maldad, los que hablan mal de mi.<br>  <br>  Todos los hombres somos HIJOS DE DIOS: los buenos, los malvados, los simpáticos, los pesados, los pobres, los ricos, los que creen lo que yo, los que tienen otras ideas. ?Todos!<br>  <br>  <br>  ¨TODOS LOS HOMBRES SOMOS HERMANOS¨ y Cristo nos ense?a que debemos amarnos unos a otros y nunca hacernos el mal.<br>  <br>  ? Y POR QUé ES TAN IMPORTANTE AMARNOS <br>  UNOS A OTROS ?<br>  <br>  Hubo un hombre muy bueno llamado PABLO, que fue Santo y que nos dejó grandes ense?an<br>  zas sobre el amor en sus cartas. El decía:<br>  <br>  ¨Aunque hablara todas las lenguas de los hombres y de los ángeles, aunque fuera sabio, aunque tuviera una gran fe, SI NO TENGO AMOR , NADA SOY ¨.<br>  <br>  ¨Aunque repartiera todos mis bienes y entregara mi cuerpo a las llamas, SI NO TENGO AMOR, DE NADA ME APROVECHA ¨.<br>  <br>  Recuerda que el AMOR con que trates a tus hermanos y conque hagas las cosas, es lo más importante para Dios.<br>  <br>  Cuando mueras y llegues a Dios, El te preguntará: <br>  ? Cuánto amaste a tus hermanos? <br>  <br>   Sólo viviendo en el amor podrás tener PAZ en tu alma, podrás tener esa tranquilidad interior que da la única y verdadera FELICIDAD al hombre. <br>  <br>  ? Aunque logres muchas cosas materiales, si no tienes AMOR, no podrás ser feliz ! <br>  <br>  Además, sólo si todos cumplimos este mandamiento, podremos tener una familia en paz, un país en paz, un mundo en paz.<br>   <br>  <br>  ? QUé ES AMAR A Mí<br>  PRóJIMO COMO A Mí MISMO ?<br>  <br>  Amar al prójimo como a mí mismo, es ¨TRATARLO COMO A MI ME GUSTARíA QUE ME TRATARAN.<br>  <br>  El Evangelio nos dice lo siguiente: <br>  ¨Todo cuanto queráis que os hagan los hombres, hacédselo también vosotros a ellos¨.<br>  <br>  - AMAR al prójimo es ¨RESPETARLO¨, o sea, no querer que todos sean o piensen como yo. Por ejemplo: si mi compadre quiere libremente votar por otro partido, debo respetarlo. Si mi vecino tiene otra religión y no desea cambiar, debo respetarlo y pedirle a él que me respete.<br>  Fíjate bien, aunque los hombres piensen de manera diferente, pueden y deben amarse y vivir en paz.<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>   <br>  <br>   <br>  - AMAR al prójimo es SERVIRLE, es decir, olvidarme de lo que yo quiero hacer o lo que yo necesito, para dar gusto y AYUDAR a los demás: a mi esposo, a mi esposa, a mis hijos, a todos mis hermanos.<br>  Servir es hacer un favor antes de que me lo pidan.<br>  Si hiciéramos esto solamente en nuestra familia, ?qué diferente sería nuestra vida familiar! <br>  <br>  <br>  - Amar al prójimo es también preocuparme por los que están más amolados que yo, por los que tienen hambre, por los que se quedaron sin casa, por mi compa?ero que se le atrasó la chamba, por aquel amigo que tuvo un problema. ?Hay tantas personas que podemos ayudar!<br>  Podemos también ayudar con nuestro tiempo o con nuestro cari?o. <br>  Amar es acompa?ar y escuchar un rato al viejito del que todos se han olvidado.<br>  Amar es visitar al enfermo que no puede salir.<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  - Amar al prójimo es SER AMABLE, es hablar bien y tratar a las personas con cari?o, y no a gritos y sombrerazos.<br>  <br>  - Amar al prójimo es tener PACIENCIA con las personas. ?Qué significa esto? Significa acep-tar a los otros como son, aguantar sus errores o sus equivocaciones y corregirlos con amor. <br>  ?Qué importante es tener paciencia por ejemplo, con nuestros hijos, para irles ense?ando lo que está bien y lo que està mal! <br>    <br>  <br>  <br>  - Amar al prójimo es hacer mi trabajo ( en la casa con mi familia, en el campo o en la fábrica con mis compa?eros) lo mejor que pueda y con alegría.<br>  - Amar al prójimo es NO JUZGAR a nadie, no pensar o hablar mal de otras personas.<br>  <br>  El verdadero amor todo lo perdona, todo lo cree, todo lo espera, todo lo soporta.<br>  El amor no acaba nunca.<br>  <br>  Los primeros cristianos, se distinguían por-que siempre se veía que se amaban mucho unos a otros. Dios quiere que hoy también nos amemos y convivamos todos los hombres en paz.|`|ebce41bde92ad748ab50a5e182fce419aa	Los mandamientos tienen las caracteristicas de que pueden seguirse o no...por ejemplo: No robaras...tu puedes robar, ahora estas pecando...<br>  <br>  Como notaras Dios no te obliga a nada..sn embargo, no merece el ser amado sobre todas las cosas?<br>  <br>  Cuidate|`|MsCm6t3qaa	Amar a dios es amarte a tí mismo y si no te amas a tí mismo no estás apto para amar a nadie más.|`|228d7f818e104c629d360beb687302daaa	Es una imposición dictatorial si tomamos a Dios como el ente católico-cristiano que nos pintan. <br>  Curiosamente, si lo tomamos un poco más "panteísta" se transforma en un buen consejo.<br>  <br>  Que la Fuerza te acompa?e|`|at9E6tmCaa	"O me amas o te mando al infierno", creo que en buena cuenta resume tu pregunta.

Y no me refiero solo a la vida del hermano,sino a mi propia vida, y respeto por la Divinidad, sea cual sea la idea que de ello tengamos.<br>  Por tanto lo considero un mandamiento justo para ser el primero: LA VIDA, ES INALIENABLE, sea de quien sea, aunque sea solo un peque?o insecto, o aunque sea nuestro mayor enemigo.<br>  Y dado que los seres humanos hemos demostrado ser bien cabezones y reacios para entender ese concepto, pues una manera de hacerlo entender es bajo un mandamiento.<br>  AStarté|`|G5EYbclMaa	vaya En realidad es Interesante...<br>  <br>  Yo Creo q  Todos los mandamientos estan inconclusos... <br>  <br>  x ponert otro ejemplo "no desearas la mujer de tu prójimo" y si tu prójimo no ama e esa mujer, si la maltrata, si ella te quiere atí, si se estan solo haciendo da?o???..!!<br>  <br>  Volviendo al "Amarás a Dios sobre todas las cosas", yo creo que  Sobretodas las cosas <br>  ...es darse vueltas en círculos <br>  xq Dios está en todas las cosas, x algo exísten.

No se ama por amar. El amor siempre tiene una raíz, se da por algo en común, por circunstancias, por experiencias. ?Quieres saber porque Dios hizo este mandamiento? Para que le amara el que lo deseara. Los humanos no nacemos con un amor inherente a Dios. De ser así, no habría ateos, ?lo entiendes? A Dios lo aman los que lo aceptan. Por lo visto tú has decidido no amar a Dios, y estás en tu derecho, pero recuerda que todas nuestras decisiones tiene consecuencias, puede que escojamos bien o mal. El te pide que lo ames porque te puede dar la vida eterna, si no lo escoges no te castiga. La muerte eterna es la consecuencia de escoger la vida alejada de Dios. En otras palabras lo expone así:<br>  "A los cielos y a la tierra llamo por testigos hoy contra vosotros, de que os he puesto delante la vida y la muerte, la bendición y la maldición; ESCOGE, pues, la vida, para que vivas tú y tu descendencia,  amando a Jehová, tu Dios, atendiendo a su voz y siguiéndolo a él, pues él es tu vida, así como la prolongación de tus días, a fin de que habites sobre la tierra que juró Jehová a tus padres, Abraham, Isaac y Jacob, que les había de dar" Deuteronomio 30:19-20. Digamos que es como si tu mamá te dijera: "no uses drogas, o te harán da?o,", tú podrías decir, "Mi mamá es mala, porque cuando uso drogas me divierto, y ella me va a castigar por ello". Al cabo de un tiempo, terminas enferma, o peor, muerta, pero no fue culpa de tu mamá, sino la consecuencia de la drogadicción, ella solo te alertó.<br>  <br>  Dios no exige que lo ames, tu relación el El se va dando cada día conforme te acercas y vives su presencia, no es un ser inanimado ni inalcanzable, es por ello que solo conociendolo e invitandolo a tu vida es como lo comienzas a amar. Por otra parte, para los creyentes, este versículo te exhorta a no poner tus ojos en cosas que después "idolatres", por ejemplo, el dinero, el trabajo, etc., incluso el ministerio en la iglesia, ya que nada deber ser más importante que nuestra relación con nuestro Padre.|`|be36abdc5e147639a87f96388f9d7dc6aa	como creo en Dios..me parece valido..de todos modos..kien obedece??<br>  <br>  yo no..<br>  tu no..<br>  <br>  quien??|`|hO4TdoH0aa	Genial! bueno yo tambien mme hecho esa pregunta.... mira, creo que la respuesta seria algo asi... si Dios nos creó... entonces tiene todo el derecho a imponerse, te doy el ejemplo de un Sim... te gustaria que tu sim hiciese lo que le de la gana sin tu decirle que hacer? asi ya no es divertido el juego. bueno.. creo que es lo mismo con Dios.<br>  <br>  Mi teoria: Cuando Dios dijo que nos hizo a su imagen y semejansa, ya sabendo que Dios no tiene imagen entonces tenemos su personalidad? Dios es caprichos consentido quisas hasta vanidoso, quiere amor... al igual que todo el mundo... si Dios es amor... el amor necesita amor... como sea Dios nos creó y nos puede destruir, somos sus SIMS, para que el haga lo que se le de la gana con nosotros lastimosamente.|`|5Zwddgcoaa	No, no es una orden. Y creo que tenemos un problema con la palabra "Mandamiento".<br>  <br>  Los mandamientos no son órdenes, los mandamientos son guías, o instrucciones. Son los que nos dan luz para que podamos actuar en este mundo de una manera adecuada a la forma como fue creado.  No solamente debemos seguirlos sino dar gracias por ellos.<br>  <br>  Por este motivo se puede elegir entre seguirlos o no. Si fueran órdenes de Dios, no habría posibilidad de elección.<br>  <br>  Y ?Quien es el mejor instructor sino el Creador?.|`|6e49b675ecaba92fac9b77e3e6a6fb32aa	Te voy a comentar algo acerca de los "mandamientos", si?<br>  Mira, al correr de los a?os, se nos ha dicho que los mandamientos son leyes que Dios nos ha dado, y bueno, hay cierta razon en ello, pero no son leyes como las que los humanos utilizamos, es decir, si un hombre no cumple una "ley" es castigado (a veces muy fuertemente) por las personas que hicieron esa ley, cierto?<br>  Con los mandamientos de Dios es distinto. Al decir, No mataras (por ejemplo) significa que tu no has sido hecho para matar, que tu naturaleza es la vida, por eso tenemos la capacidad de tener hijos. Si otro mandamiento dice, amaras a Dios sobre todas las cosas, no es que te obligue a amarlo, sino que has sido creado por El y en el fondo, aunque muchos no lo crean, siempre esta inmerso en sus vidas (incluso yo he conocido ateos que en el momento de de un peligro de muerte han dicho: "Dios MIO, ayudame" me explico??<br>  Los mandamientos de Dios no son obligaciones como nos lo han hecho saber algunas religiones, mas bien son decretos(verdades) hechos por Dios, que nos muestran cual es nuestra naturaleza. Y si por alguna razon decidimos no seguir esos decretos, no significa que Dios nos vaya a castigar y a mandar al infierno...Dios no nos castiga, somos los humanos los que, al ir en contra de esos decretos (o verdades) de Dios, nos metemos en problemas y pagamos las consecuencias. Nos castigamos a nosotros mismos. Dime que persona (sana y en plenas facultades psicologicas) es feliz matando?? <br>  Hay otros decretos como el "No fornicaras" (que siempre es tema conflictivo), este lo que significa es: no estas hecho para andar por la vida teniendo sexo con cuanta gente se te ponga enfrente (sin amor, respeto, ni nada, solo sexo), y no porque no puedas hacerlo fisicamente, sino porque la escencia primordial del sexo es el amor, y si no hay amor, llegara un momento en que ese comportamiento o te enferme, o te haga sentir vacio o acabes sintiendo que nada te llena, entoces te drogas o te da igual que sean hombres o mujeres, etc. me explico?<br>  Los decretos de Dios no estan equivocados, los hombres somos los que, al sentirnos obligados a seguir una "Ley" nos revelamos porque nos gusta sentirnos libres, eso logico. De echo esa es la maravillosa libertad que Dios nos da.  Cada uno decide como quiere vivir! Pero cuando comprendamos que Dios nos ha explicado con sus decretos cual es nuestra naturaleza y lo bueno de ser fiel a esa naturaleza, las cosas cambian. Por eso, se nos ha dicho que somos hijos de Dios, porque El es amor y los humanos debemos encontrar ese amor en nosotros mismos para trasmitirlo a otros humanos. <br>  Espero no haberte hechado mucho rollo, pero este tema es muy extenso... ojala que mi comentario te sirva.<br>  Saludos|`|8omhOVVIaa	?Querida Paty! ?Comprendes por qué ya me alejé de esa religión?

Anteponer el bien de los demás al tuyo propio.<br>  Y qué es el bien? La ausencia de mal.<br>  Y qué es el mal? Todo lo que deriva de tu afán de poder.<br>  <br>  Si rechazas tu afán de poder estás eligiendo el bien, eligiendo el bien estás eligiendo amar y finalmente amando estás eligiendo amar a Dios sobre todas las cosas.<br>  <br>  Entendemos también que Dios no impone, Dios invita y lo hace porque ama... si impusiera no habría un sólo delito en todo el planeta.<br>  <br>  Conclusión:<br>  Es necesario, para interpretar las Escrituras ubicarse en el contexto y tener el fundamento doctrinal claro: Dios es amor y toda la reflexión que deriva de ésto.<br>  <br>  Totús|`|WHQUoGV6aa	Tu pregunta es muy buena pero a la vez es muy contradictoria, puesto que por amor, y respeto, a Dios ó a sus mandamientos tu no realizastes esta pregunta...<br>  Te explico: Yo no soy practicante de ningun dogma, pero puedo asegurarte, que si tienes ese algo que  nos dio ese ser al que tu  llamas Dios, y como comunmente es conocido el en el mundo, entenderias que el amor no es mas que el principio y el fin de todo, y de nada. Amar a Dios es amar todo sin cuestionamiento alguno, eso incluye el cuestionamiento de el mismo, puesto que ese algo del que anteriormente te hable no es mas que "EL LIBRE ALBELDRIO" y es eso lo unico que hace que todo hombre tome decisiones, que determinen acciones para muchos buenas y para muchos malas, que incluso religiosos del mundo determinen el pecado. Pero yo me pregunto <br>  ?El hombre en realidad pidio que se le diera ese don?, si es que se le puede llamar asi... Entonces por que DIOS, el hombre, los religiosos, en fin el mundo nos tiene que juzgar por las acciones que tomemos, indiferentemente que estas sean iguales o distintas a las demas. ?Acaso no fue ese al que llamamos DIOS quien nos dio esa libertad?<br>  ?Entonces quien es realmente el culpable de que seamos lo que somos?<br>  Tu, ni nadien pidio nacer y mucho menos tener LIBRE ALBELDRIO para que seamos cuestinado, juzgados, e incluso crusificado, y es que hasta el mismo JESUS sufrio las concecuencias de esto...

Entonces YHWH ofreció protección y vigilia eterna por este pueblo, a cambio de adorarle sólo a El, amarle sólo a él y sólo seguir sus preceptos (mitzvot).<br>  <br>  Para cualquier judío el amar a Ds no tiene nada de imperativo u obligatorio, para ellos es una respuesta natural a la predilección de YHWH por ellos, es un sentimiento de reciprocidad por las bendiciones, y protección para con ellos. (Si tienes oportunidad de platicar con alguno, hazlo)<br>  <br>  Pero luego de Jesús, los cristianos perseguidos, los romanos en el poder y toda la historia que ya conocemos, La Iglesia de Roma adopta para sí los lineamientos religiosos de los judíos, un poco tergiversados, adaptados a su conveniencia etc. Y bueno, entonces todo aquel que se diga cristiano o católico por ende tiene que seguir estas reglas, pero los católicos inventaron eso de que había un nuevo pacto o alianza : la muerte de Jesús era el sello de esta en analogía al sacrificio pascual de los judíos y a cambio del 'nuevo pacto de salvación' todo aquel que es 'hijo de dios'  por el bautizo, debe seguir sus preceptos.<br>  <br>  Nota:<br>  Todo lo anterior no es lo que yo creo, si no un resumen de como entiendo esta relación de dios-amor-hombre en las distintas religiones que siguen estos mandamientos.<br>  <br>  En mi experiencia como católica (religión que profesé en algún momento de mi vida), en realidad jamás sentí amor, lo que se dice amor por Dios tal y como lo concebía en aquel momento, creo que lo mismo le sucede a la mayoría de los católicos, católicos etc, es imposible amarlo, ya que la teología en que se basa su concepción no te ayuda a concerle y comprenderle, te lo imponen y si preguntas algo, te dicen: "Dios tiene misterios que no permite que sean revelados por el bien del hombre"  ja,ja,ja.|`|Y0S7NHaNaa	Pues mira..., bien analizados los mandamientos, resulta que salvo ese, todos se basan en el sentido común para la convivencia armoniosa.<br>  <br>  <br>  Setanta, el Perro de Culann.|`|aa8d0d5180deb6cc1d0ee05cef5f6460aa	Si tenemos libre aledrío no es necesario ningun mandamiento.

Si amamos a Dios por sobre todas las cosas entonces amar al prójimo será una consecuencia, pues no importa que tan ruin o malvado pueda ser alguien, una parte de su ser está relacionada con Dios y será perfecta, la maldad sería solo una perversión una ignorancia conciente o inconciente de su verdadera esencia, y como tal corregible.<br>  <br>  Te voy a poner un ejemplo muy burdo (mi capacidad no dá para más por el momento):<br>  Un paracaidista al saltar amará por sobre todas las cosas al paracaídas, él nunca pensaría que el paracaídas es egoista por "exigirle" que lo tenga en perfecto estado, pues de no hacerlo las consecuencias serían, en la mayoría de los casos, fatales. El paracaídas no ocasionó las consecuencias pero si pudiera hablar te diría cuídame o morirás.<br>  Desde luego Dios no se puede comparar con un objeto al que le podemos dar un uso común, él es la fuente de todo bien de manera que buscándolo a él todo nos será dado por a?adidura.<br>  De modo que la amenaza que mencionas no es inherente al mandamiento, con el mandamiento o sin el mandamiento sufrimos y morimos, el mandamiento es un mensaje del Amor que Dios nos tiene al buscar librarnos de nuestra situación actual.<br>  <br>  Que estés bien|`|fSulXZxNaa	Tu cree lo k tu sientas segun "dios" puso 10 manadamientos y dime tu cuantos los siguen esos mandamientos.. nadie.

Ademas es tan amoroso que con lo poderoso q es en lugar de crearnos como robots que hagamos lo que el quira , nos creo con libre albedrio es decir la capacidad de decidir por nosotros mismos , Ademas Dios necesitará algo de simples humanos que somos polvo ante el ??, creo que es ilógico, mas bien el dio ese mandato  no por que el necesite que lo amemos  ni como amenaza  de que si no lo hacemos nos manda al infierno , mas bien deja ver que como creador del universo y de nosotros mismos deberiamos sentirnos impulsarlos a amarlo por todo lo que nos ha dado , la biblia dice en el libro de Revelación o Apocalipsis que el es el u7nico digno de la gloria y la honra por que el creo todo. Y es que cuando nos ponemos a pensar que todo lo que tenemos es por el , la vida misma ...cuando reflexionamos en la manera de como estamos creados , cuando vemos el imponente mar , un atardecer y tantas maravillas realmente vemos reflejado ese amor , tan solo en como estamos creados  pues no necesitamos distinguir miles de sabores, ni de olores , tampoco necesitamos ver a color y sin embargo Dios nos creo con esas capacidades por que lo hizo por amor para que disfrutemos mas de la vida....asi que en conclusión Dios no obliga a nadie pero si espera que todo ser humano agradecido le de la gloria y el amor que el merece.

God instituted the Sabbath specifically for the Mosaic Israelites and for a specific reason that applied only to them.    Ex 31    16 The Israelites are to observe the Sabbath, celebrating it for the generations to come as a lasting covenant.  17 It will be a sign between me and the Israelites forever, for in six days the Lord made the heavens and the earth, and on the seventh day he abstained from work and rested.      Deut 5   15 Remember that you(Israelites) were slaves in Egypt and that the Lord your God brought you out of there with a mighty hand and an outstretched arm. Therefore the Lord your God has commanded you to observe the Sabbath day.    The Sabbath is a part of the Mosaic Covenant and did not exist from Adam to Moses or apply to anyone else in the scriptures at any time.  And the very purpose for the Sabbath was a remeberance for the Jews and the freedom gained by Gods hand.  This is specific to Mosaic Jews and ended with reserection of Jesus Christ and the Covenant of Grace.  One can say that we are to observe the Sabbath day because of the Ten Commandments.  But we as Christians have never lived under the Ten Commandments either.  These commandments were for the Mosaic Jews.  The Bible tells us so.      Heb 8  6 But now Jesus, our High Priest, has been given a ministry that is far superior to the old priesthood, for he is the one who mediates for us a far better covenant(Grace) with God, based on better promises.  7 If the first covenant(Mosaic) had been faultless, there would have been no need for a second covenant to replace it. 8 But when God found fault with the people, he said:    The day is coming, says the Lord,  when I will make a new covenant  with the people of Israel and Judah.  9 This covenant will not be like the one  I made with their ancestors  when I took them by the hand  and led them out of the land of Egypt.  They did not remain faithful to my covenant,  so I turned my back on them, says the Lord.  10 But this is the new covenant I will make  with the people of Israel on that day,[c] says the Lord:   I will put my laws in their minds,  and I will write them on their hearts.  I will be their God,  and they will be my people.      Deuteronomy 5  1 Moses summoned all Israel and said:        Hear, O Israel, the decrees and laws I declare in your hearing today. Learn them and be sure to follow them. 2 The LORD our God made a covenant with us at Horeb.   """" It was not with our fathers that the LORD made this covenant, but with us, with all of us who are alive here today""""".|`|0a35bd8efe64caf91fcf1e0cf5d79e07aa	I think Romans 14:5 addresses your question best.

If in New Testament times the apostles gathered on thursday; being the first day of their week we would only have historical evidence to tell us we were wrong, and we don't have enough historical evidence to verify that somewhere between the transition from the ancient calendar to our modern calender a couple of days haven't been offset.    The Apostles worshiped on the first day of their week, we worship on the first day of our week.  To be any more specific would require a new revelation.|`|eshummTJaa	joe b...if we as"Christan's" do not follow the Sabbath and do not follow the Ten Commandments, then we are not Christians and followers of Christ and are not part of salvation....we are lost...    you need to study your bible much better...      The Sabbath is for everyone who follows God.....        As was his custom Jesus went into the synagogue to worship on the Sabbath...    Just suppose that Jesus peaks in on occasion to check on his "church"...on what day would he look? who will he find at worship on the Sabbath?    so what if man changed the laws of God to the first day of the week... man does not have that authority to change the laws of God written in stone by his own finger...    Sabbath at creation and in the Garden of Eden, Sabbath all around the world until the day of Judgment, Sabbath is celebrated in heaven...    where is the first day of the week mentioned other that to break bread and collect money as per a normal beginning of the work week business meeting...|`|e1a7697c7943bcffd2fa613b82800630aa	By the scriptures alone there is no certainty of the Sabbath being changed to Sunday.  In fact Jewish Cristians in the early church continued to observe Saturday.  Some denominations today have reintroduced that day for worship.  However, the leaders of the early church set aside Sunday as a day of purely Christian worship.  As more Gentiles joined this observance became tradition.|`|E9chZY74aa	You go according to God who established the week with " and on the seventh day He rested".

E' una delle caratteristiche dei credenti l'essere razzisti.... e comunque i cristiani hanno sempre cercato di cambiare l'immagine di Gesù, rendendolo biondo, carnagione chiara, occhi azzurri....

En Proverbios leemos: "El que encubre sus pecados no prosperará; mas<br>  el que los confiesa y se aparta, alcanzará misericordia" (28:13).<br>  <br>  A veces la confesión también implica restitución (Exodo 22:1-15). Por lo general, éste es un aspecto olvidado de la confesión. Si nuestro pecado privó a alguien de algo que le pertenecía o correspondía (algo material, dinero o trabajo), no sólo debemos disculparnos con la persona ofendida sino que también debemos pagar tan pronto como sea posible.<br>  <br>  La maravilla de la Escritura es la buena nueva de que Dios perdona de balde a quien con corazón sincero confiesa su pecado. Manasés fue uno de los reyes más malvados de Judá. El echó por tierra las reformas de Ezequías y sirvió a dioses falsos con más celo de lo que lo habían hecho las naciones paganas que Dios había destruido ante los israelitas (2 Crónicas 33:1-9). Sin embargo, al ser capturado por los asirios, Manasés se humilló ante el Se?or--y Dios lo perdonó.<br>  <br>  Si Dios pudo perdonar a un rey pagano y malvado cuando éste se humilló, con seguridad que también nos perdonará si confesamos nuestros pecados y nos arrepentimos. La confesión es humillante, pero "si confesamos a Dios nuestros pecados, podemos estar seguros de que ha de perdonarnos y limpiarnos de toda maldad" (1 Juan 1:9 BD). Aprenda de memoria este pasaje y a menudo pida a Dios que lo haga realidad en su vida.<br>  <br>  Hay otro precioso versículo para agregar a su lista de memorización: "Y nunca más me acordaré de sus pecados y transgresiones" (Hebreos 10:17). Cuán notable que el Dios omnisciente promete no sólo perdonar nuestros pecados sino también olvidarlos para siempre.<br>  <br>  En su obra EL PARAISO PERDIDO, Juan Milton pregunta: "?Qué otra cosa podemos hacer sino postrarnos ante El reverentes; y allí confesar con humildad nuestras faltas e implorar perdón; con lágrimas que rieguen el piso y con suspiros de corazones contritos, como se?al de pena no fingida y mansa humillación?"|`|4y9yTf2iaa	hola!<br>  siento mucho el que estés pasando por este momento de  soledad,y vació.<br>  pero sabes que Dios es bueno y si tu lo estas buscando y estas realmente arrepentida,habla con El y pídele que te guié,y te lleve a el lugar donde vas a poder conocer mas de El,pídele que te muestre su verdad.<br>  bendiciones.<br>  <br>  Senor y Dios mio,<br>  mirame y respondeme;<br>  ilumina mis ojos.<br>  Asi no caere en el sueno de la muerte;<br>  asi no dira mi enemigo <lo he vencido><br>  asi mi adversario no se alegrara de mi caida.<br>  Pero to confio en tu gran amor;<br>  mi corazon se alegra en tu salvacion.<br>   canto salmos al Senor<br>  l  el Senor ha sido bueno conmigo.|`|9GzUUkDUaa	NUNCA EN LA VIDA es tarde para entregarse a DIOS  y recibir su perdon aprovecha en tu VIDA adora a dios, pidele perdon, todavia tienes oportunidad, pero los que pecan toda su vida y no han pedido perdon a `Dios y empezar a adorarlo van al infierno<br>  yo tambien pequé mucho y abandone a Dios todo este tiempo, pero aunque no voy a la iglesia, ni tengo algun estilo de vida cristiano me olvido de el, siempre lo siento conmigo y le pido perdon cuando hago cosas malas, y cuando necesito algo, si le ofresco dejar algun vicio o algo malo con gusto el me lo concede,<br>   ofrecele tus disculpas y como minimo reza el padre nuestro todas las noches y veras como se te quitara ese VACIO<br>  que tienes en tu corazon y veras que siempre estara contigo en las buenas y en las malas<br>  <br>  recuerda, dios es TODO<br>  Amen ;)|`|9c4d6b4ba6fe7ef545d3f9262e18c11eaa	Lee este pasaje creo que respondo exactamente tu duda cuidate mucho adios :-)<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?book_id=47&chapter=20&version=60" rel="nofollow">http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?boo...</a>|`|9is5cIhxaa	Arrodillarte y pedirle perdón de corazón.Dios es amor y perdona hasta los peores pecados, porque no habría de perdonarte a ti?

Despus de clases llego a casa, hago mi tarea y luego voy a practica. Cuando llego a casa ya se paso mi hora de dormir asi que tomo una ducha rapida y m voy a dormir.

Doesn't sound to me like eternal torture.  But maybe there are other things in there talking about eternal torture.    Edit:    Muslim Egypt:  "Did you say unto men: Worship me and my mother as two gods besides Allaah?"  I'm sorry, I do like the Koran, I think it's got a lot that's good about it, it's spiritual and focuses your mind, and it's poetic and beautiful to read.  I wouldn't presume to say that it's wrong about all the spiritual things, BUT this is NOT what Christians believe.     That is fact.  I know this because I know what I have been taught.      Christians do NOT worship either Mary or Jesus as two gods beside Allah.  1. Christians do not worship Mary at all.  2. Christians believe Jesus *is* Allah/God, not a *separate* god, but exactly the same God.

H4wVtDBYaa	peace Sean,    regarding salvation the qur'an says the following:  (002:062)  Those who believe (in the Qur'an), and those who follow the Jewish (scriptures), and the Christians and the Sabians,- any who believe in Allah and the Last Day, and work righteousness, shall have their reward with their Lord; on them shall be no fear, nor shall they grieve.     (002:111-112)  And they say: "None shall enter Paradise unless he be a Jew or a Christian." Those are their (vain) desires. Say: "Produce your proof if ye are truthful."   Nay,-whoever submits His whole self to Allah and is a doer of good,- He will get his reward with his Lord; on such shall be no fear, nor shall they grieve.     (003:055)  Behold! Allah said: "O Jesus! I will take thee and raise thee to Myself and clear thee (of the falsehoods) of those who blaspheme; I will make those who follow thee superior to those who reject faith, to the Day of Resurrection: Then shall ye all return unto me, and I will judge between you of the matters wherein ye dispute.     (005:069)  Those who believe (in the Qur'an), those who follow the Jewish (scriptures), and the Sabians and the Christians,- any who believe in Allah and the Last Day, and work righteousness,- on them shall be no fear, nor shall they grieve.     the qur'an is severely critical of christian blasphemy claiming that jesus (peace be upon him) was the divine son of god  (004:171)  O People of the Book! Commit no excesses in your religion: Nor say of Allah aught but the truth. Christ Jesus the son of Mary was (no more than) a messenger of Allah, and His Word, which He bestowed on Mary, and a spirit proceeding from Him: so believe in Allah and His messengers. Say not "Trinity" : desist: it will be better for you: for Allah is one Allah: Glory be to Him: (far exalted is He) above having a son. To Him belong all things in the heavens and on earth. And enough is Allah as a Disposer of affairs.     hope this helps|`|WUjlEuTtaa	Volume 4, Book 56, Number 662:   Narrated Abu Said:     The Prophet said, "You will follow the wrong ways, of your predecessors so completely and literally that if they should go into the hole of a mastigure, you too will go there."

Desde el principio plantea la vanidad de este mundo, y habla de su experiencia de haber estudiado y recorrido el mundo y que a pesar de haber buscado en la ciencia la verdad de las cosas, el fin y propósito de la vida del ser humano, él no encontró estas respuestas en las cosas de este mundo. El tema es qué respuestas esperaba encontrar? El le buscaba el sentido a la vida en esta tierra y no lo encontraba, pues confiaba en la ciencia y el conocimiento humanos y el creía que podía encontrar en el hombre esas respuestas. Pero cuanto más ahondaba en la naturaleza humana más se decepcionaba, por eso aumentaba su dolor, por lo tanto el predicador concluye en el capítulo 12 versículos 13 y 14: "En fin de todo el discurso que has oído es: Teme a Dios y guarda sus mandamientos, porque esto es todo del hombre.  Pues Dios traerá obra a juicio, juntamente con toda cosa oculta sea buena o sea mala."<br>  Es decir, él esperaba encontrar sus respuestas en el hombre  concluye que sólo Dios es la respuesta a todas la cosas.|`|dECo70fnaa	18 Porque en la mucha sabiduría hay mucha molestia; <br>  <br>      y quien a?ade ciencia, a?ade dolor. <br>  <br>  Molestia. <br>  <br>      El vocablo aquí traducido como molestia deriva de una raíz que significa "estar afligido", "ser provocado".

About Marjoe Gortnor who in the 1940's was a 4 year old preacher and grew up learning how to make Millions deceiving people and a huge part of his power came from his expert use of speaking in tongues. <br>  Deep Discount DVD has copies of this movie<br>  <br>  Also as always I provided a link to a Christian website that exposes these things.  No I am not christian, but have studied this phenomena since I did come out of holiness type churches in the 1970's<br>  <br>  Paul said in 1 Corinthians that tongues edifies the speaker, but Christians are to edify each other.

Verán como Dios se Glorifica en sus vidas yo lo hice hace muchos a?os y Dios se Glorificó en mi vida.  Hoy día tenemos un ministerio poderoso.<br>  <br>  A través de todo el Antiguo y Nuevo Testamentos, los hombres de Dios han sido amonestados por palabra y por ejemplo, respecto a la conveniencia de abstenerse de los pecados morales. Proverbios repite este mensaje: "El hombre que juega con el pecado sexual está falto de sabiduría". <br>  <br>  a. Los hijos de Elí... provocaron el juicio de Dios sobre sus vidas porque cometían pecados sexuales con las mujeres que servían a la entrada del tabernáculo. <br>  <br>  b. Sansón... fracasó y desperdició su vida porque cometió fornicación con Dalila. <br>  <br>  c. Salomón... autor de los Proverbios y quien nos amonesta respecto a terribles consecuencias del adulterio y la fornicación, perdió el favor de Dios por haber cometido inmoralidad. <br>  <br>  d. David... varón conforme al corazón de Dios, sufrió terribles consecuencias durante toda su vida porque cometió adulterio con Betsabé. <br>  <br>  Hay que mantenerse puro para el Se?or. Mira lo que dice la Biblia en 1 Corintios 5...<br>  <br>  "De cierto se oye que hay entre vosotros fornicación, y tal fornicación cual ni aun se nombra entre los gentiles; tanto que algunos tiene la mujer de su padre.  Y vosotros estáis envanecidos.  ?No debierais más bien haberos lamentado, para que fuese quitado de en medio de vosotros el que cometió tal acción?" (1 Corintios5:1-2).<br>  <br>  Muchas veces no reconocemos como le fallamos a Dios al no obedecer su palabra perdiendo la sensibilidad hacia el pecado.  "?No sabéis que un poco de levadura leuda toda la masa?" (1 Corintios 5:6).<br>  <br>  "Limpiaos, pues, de la vieja levadura, para que seáis nueva masa, sin levadura como sois: porque nuestra pascua, que es Cristo.  Ya fue sacrificada por nosotros" (1 Corintios5:7).  Palabras fuertes concluyen el capítulo 1 Corintios 5: <br>  <br>  "Más bien os escribí que no os juntéis que ninguno que, llamándose hermano, fuese fornicario, o avaro, o idólatra, o maldiciente, o borracho, o ladrón; con tal ni aun comáis.  Porque ?qué razón tendría yo para juzgar a los que están afuera?  ?No juzgáis vosotros a los que están dentro?  Porque lo que están fuera.  Dios juzgará.  Quitad, pues a ese perverso de entre vosotros" (1 Corintios5:11-13).<br>  <br>  "?No sabéis que vuestros cuerpos son miembros de Cristo?  ?Quitaré, pues, los miembros de Cristo y los haré miembros de una ramera?  De ningún modo.  ?O no sabéis que el que se une con una ramera, es un cuerpo con ella?  Porque dice: Los dos serán una sola carne.  Pero el que se une al Se?or, un espíritu con él.  Huid de la fornicación.  Cualquier otro pecado que el hombre cometa, está fuera del cuerpo; más el que fornica, contra su propio cuerpo peca" (1 Corintios 6:15-18).<br>  <br>  Olvidamos que nuestro cuerpo es templo del Espíritu Santo.  <br>  <br>  "?O ignoráis que vuestros cuerpos es templo del Espíritu Santo, el cual está en vosotros, el cual tenéis de Dios, y que no sois vuestros?  Porque habéis sido comprado por precio; glorificad, pues, a Dios con vuestros cuerpo y en vuestro espíritu, los cuales son de Dios"  (1 Corintios 6: 19-20).<br>  <br>  ENTENDAMOS EL SIGNIFICADO DE TOMARLA , PARA DISFRUTARLA (1 Corintios 11:23-26)<br>  <br>  ES UN MEMORIAL DE LA OBRA DE CRISTO EN NUESTRA<br>  SALVACIóN:<br>  <br>  El comer el “pan” nos recuerda que Cristo fue castigado en la cruz por nuestro pecado.<br>  <br>   En Isaías 53:5-6 se dice de Cristo y de nosotros: “…él herido fue por nuestras rebeliones”, “molido por nuestros pecados”, “el castigo de nuestra paz fue sobre él”, “y por su llaga fuimos nosotros curados”,<br>  “…mas Jehová cargo en él el pecado de todos nosotros”. [Noten que es Cristo el que lleva el castigo de nuestro pecado. Esto es SUSTITUCIóN] En 1Pedro2:24 se dice de Cristo y de nosotros :  “quien llevó el mismo nuestros pecados en su cuerpo sobre el madero”… “y por cuya herida fuisteis sanados”. [Aquí también es Cristo el sustituto por nuestro pecado].  <br>  En Ezequiel 36:25-27 se dice: “… y seréis limpiados de todas vuestras inmundicias; y de todos vuestros ídolos os limpiaré”. “Os daré  corazón nuevo y pondré espíritu nuevo dentro de vosotros y quitaré de vosotros el corazón de piedra y os daré un corazón de carne, y pondré dentro de vosotros mi Espíritu y haré que andéis en mis estatutos, y guardéis mis preceptos y los pongáis por obra” [En este Pacto Dios da todos los recursos para cumplirlo ante él]<br>  <br>  Tomar la Santa Cena indignamente 1 Corintios 11:28 en adelante...<br>  <br>  Debe haber un “auto-examen” antes de comer los elementos.Y luego con el perdón de pecados y las actitudes de amor hacia “la mesa” y a los hermanos, participar de los elementos.<br>  <br>  Examinarnos para no ser juzgados (1 Corintios 11:31)|`|N1rRN2NJaa	no aclaras de que iglesia perteneces, si eres miembro de la iglesia de Jesucristo de los santos de los últimos días te diré que no puedes tomar la santa cena, si lo haces solo beberás condenación para tu propia alma, antes debes contarle a  tu obispo el te dirá que hacer <br>  suerte y pone en orden tu vida|`|M3lFFILPaa	Me imagino que hablas de la Sagrada Eucaristía ?<br>  <br>  Para recibirla, debes estar libre de pecado, dicho en otra manera, en gracia de Dios, en amistad con él, para lograrlo existe el Sacramento de la Reconciliación ( confesión ).

Yo les digo que cualquiera que practique el pecado es esclavo del pecado.<br>  <br>  en este verso 32-34 ustedes pueden notar que Yahshua estaba hablando de la verdad ?de que verdad hablaba Yahshua?  la verdad que hablaba YAHSHUA era del TORAH,  porque tan pronto que nosotros tenemos conocimiento de la TORAH y lo ponemos en practica,  no pecamos sino  vivimos libre del pecado.esa es la libertad <br>  que habla Yahshua porque el pecado es desobediencia hacia la TORAH. <br>  <br>  Jn 8:35 Ahora, un esclavo no permanece con la familia para siempre, pero un hijo sí permanece con ella para siempre.<br>  Jn 8:36 ?Así que, si el Hijo los libera, serán realmente libres!<br>  Jn 8:37 Yo sé que ustedes son descendientes de Avraham, a pesar de eso quieren matarme, porque lo que les digo no prospera en ustedes.<br>  Jn 8:38 ?Yo digo lo que mi Padre me ha ense?ado, ustedes hacen lo que su padre les ha dicho!"<br>  Jn 8:39 Ellos le respondieron: "Nuestro padre es Avraham." Yahshúa les dijo: "?Si son hijos de Avraham, entonces hagan las obras que Avraham hizo!<br>  <br>  En estos versos 35-39 podemos notar que Yahshua se esta dando a conocer como hijo de YAHWEH. Y al mismo tiempo nos esta dando a conocer verdades, que nosotros como hijos de YAHWEH permaneceremos juntos con nuestro Padre YAHWEH, mas aquellos que practican la maldad seran esclavos del pecado por lo tanto nunca estaran viviendo junto con el Padre YAHWEH. Porque aun aquellos que vivieron conforme Avraham tuvieron que practicar segun lo que decia el Torah cual es palabra de YAHWEH. <br>  <br>  Jn 8:40 Y como lo veo, ustedes están buscando la manera de matarme a mí, un hombre que les ha dicho la verdad, la cual ha oído de YAHWEH. ?Avraham nunca hizo algo como esto!<br>  Jn 8:41 Ustedes están haciendo las cosas que su padre hace." Ellos le dijeron a El: "?Nosotros no somos hijos ilegítimos, tenemos sólo un Padre, que es Elohim!"<br>  <br>  En estos versos 40-41 ustedes pueden notar que solamente hay un Elohim cual es YAHWEH. Y tambien podemos notar que a Yahshua lo querian matar por decir la verdad. <br>  <br>  Jn 8:42 Yahshúa les respondió: "Si YAHWEH Elohim fuera su Padre, ustedes me amarían; porque Yo salí de YAHWEH Elohim, y he venido acá. Yo no vine por cuenta propia, sino El me envió.<br>  Jn 8:43 ?Por qué no entienden lo que les estoy diciendo? Porque no pueden soportar escuchar mi mensaje.<br>  <br>  En este verso 42-43 ustedes pueden notar que Yahshua se esta identificando como el hijo de YAHWEH. Y no solo eso; el mismo dice que es el enviado de YAHWEH. Por lo tanto el vino como mensajero deYAHWEH pero ellos no querian entender eso .  Y aun en estos tiempos no quieren entender eso. <br>  <br>  Jn 8:44 Ustedes pertenecen a su padre ha satán, y quieren llevar a cabo los deseos de su padre. El ha sido asesino desde el principio, y nunca ha estado de parte de la verdad, porque no hay verdad en él. ?Cuando él dice mentiras, él habla con carácter, porque es mentiroso; en verdad es el inventor de la mentira!<br>  Jn8:45 Pero en cuanto a mí, porque Yo digo la verdad, ustedes no me creen.<br>  <br>  Amigos hermanos lectores muchos en estos tiempos no quieren oir la verdad y muchas veces cuando uno dice la verdad incomoda y lo hacen sentir mal. Pero la verdad hay que decirla. Yahshua es el Meshayah-Mesias el enviado de YAHWEH no se puede poner en duda de que el es el hijo del Todopoderoso YAHWEH. Espero que le haiga contestado a su pregunta. <br>  |`|jfTzDFGlaa	(Juan 8:42-47) 42?Jesús les dijo: “Si Dios fuera su Padre, ustedes me amarían a mí, porque de Dios VINE YO y estoy aquí.

YdjX5fOWaa	You need to tell a teacher or the principal right away.  I know they've scared you, but they're not going to do anything to you.  What they are doing is sexual harassment and is very wrong.  You need to tell someone about this so they will stop harassing you and other girls.  Be tough!|`|KBVAbwUXaa	get an older guy, like 27 or something, to beat them up. And then you can beat him off for protecting you.

You need to tell your teacher, principal of your school, your parents, and contact the police. Not just to protect yourself, but to protect others as well.    As long as you remain silent and allow them to continue this behavior, they will push the limits. One day they may not stop with just trying to touch your chest, they may rape you. They may also be doing something similar to someone else who is also too afraid to stand up for herself. Do yourself and the rest of the female population in your area a favor and report them before it is too late.     They may be angry but they will get the psychological help they need. You too need to talk to someone; you have been assaulted and victimized. What they are doing is horrid and terribly wrong. Do not allow it to continue, and do not fear retaliation. If you inform others in power (teacher, principal, parents, and police) of their behavior, they will protect you.    Just to let you know, I too had a similar thing happen to me during my 7th grade year, (over 25 years ago.) I did tell, and I have never regretted doing so.|`|ECvEknqtaa	TELL YOUR PARENTS AND THE HEAD TEACHER AND YOUR TEACHER!! that is as everyone has said sexual harassment!  that is not right. you have to tell someone! u never know it might get worse than feeling your chest! please tell someone!|`|47FsMLlwaa	You need to bust these guys out.

That is sexual harassment and you should never, ever ever put up with it, even if they don't realize either how wrong it is. They're young, they probably don't know just how serious that is, so they need to be informed by a teacher that it's not okay.    It's best that they learn this behavior is wrong now than to find out later when they are in the workplace and get sued for such things. They should not be sued over this now, but it definitely needs to stop.    You personally need to say "Stop that, now." and nothing more. Don't giggle, don't laugh and don't be unsure of yourself. Stay away from them as much as possible and don't get all hysterical about it, that will only encourage them. Be cold and be serious.     Your teachers need to make sure they aren't harassing you later, so if they do, follow up with your teacher immediately and let him/her know so they can either move you or take disciplinary action.|`|TfijWwsYaa	You got to say something right now.  They could be doing this to others and eventually things will get worse for you or someone else.  Take a friend with you and go tell the principal/dean/ or a teacher pronto.

After writing the gender of the fairy, write it's powers. (Don't create an evil fairy please.) Then, for about 10 seconds, imagine the fairy coming, and concentrate really hard on that.(Not so hard you feel pain) Once the 10 seconds are up the fairy will come in about 5 minutes or so. <br>  <br>  NOTE: If it does not come in a day, that's natural, sometimes it takes a while for them to recieve your message. <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>   i dont know if it works though|`|33E9E96iaa	Go to the seashore and find a stone with a  hole in it. once you have that, you can look though it to see through the glamour that the faeries have placed on them. All you need to do now is find some, go into the woods with a glass bowl filled with raw milk or organic cream. Make sure you DO NOT smoke as they cannot take the smell. Keep salt ready in case they come after you, don't bother with iron as they can smell that, and the colour red will just scare them away. DO try to talk politely and quietly to them, though any contact may scare them away. DON'T try to catch one, it will drive you mad or sour your milk and kill your pets. DO be care full, if you upset them they will not forget it. Do not eat ANYTHING they give you, it will either kill you or curse you. Faeries are not to be mucked about with though, they are not the disneyfied tinker-bells that most people  think, they are malicious and tricksy, there are hand fulls of them that would gladly eat you or steal you forever.|`|hAFDi7qBaa	Follow these steps first:<br>  Rules to fairies: <br>  1.NEVER lie to them or about them.

The kingdom of heaven is mentioned many, many times in the bible.  People cannot have absolute power, because it corrupts them.  However, God is perfect, so therfore can rule absolutely without being corrupted by it, so yes, the kingdom of heaven is an absolute dictatorship ruled by a perfect King who only cares for our well being.

25aaca25044e2d0be2cefdae73397bafaa	no, the Holy Spirit will never leave a believer. This truth is revealed in many different passages in the New Testament. For example, Romans 8:9 tells us, “If anyone does not have the Spirit of Christ, he is not His.” This verse is very clear that if someone does not have the indwelling presence of the Holy Spirit, then he/she is not saved; therefore, if the Holy Spirit were to leave a believer, he/she would have lost his/her relationship with Christ and lost his/her salvation. Yet this is clearly contrary to what the Bible teaches about the “eternal security” of Christians. Another verse that speaks clearly to the permanence of the Holy Spirit’s indwelling presence in the life of believers is John 14:16. Here Jesus states that the Father will give another Helper and that “He may be with you forever.”<br>  <br>  The fact that the Holy Spirit will never leave a believer is also seen in Ephesians 1:13-14 where believers are said to be “sealed” with the Holy Spirit, “who is given as a pledge of our inheritance with a view to the redemption of God’s own possession, to the praise of His glory.” The picture of being sealed with the Spirit is one of ownership and possession. God has promised eternal life to all who believe in Christ, and as a guarantee that He will keep His promise, He has sent the Holy Spirit to indwell the believer until the day of redemption. Similar to making a down payment on a car or a house, God has provided all believers with a down payment of their future relationship with Him by sending the Holy Spirit to indwell them. The fact that all believers are sealed with the Spirit is also seen in 2 Corinthians 1:22 and Ephesians 4:30.|`|2d2ZuimCaa	No , Hebrews 13:5 "Let your conversation be without covetousness; and be content with such things as ye have : for he hath said , I will never leave thee or forsake thee ".|`|2x37XgxCaa	David prayed in one of his Psalms, for God to not take His Holy Spirit from him.  This was before the Holy Spirit was given as an earnest of our inheritance (as a child of God).  But, when we are saved, we are sealed by the Holy Spirit.  We can grieve the Holy Spirit and become insensitive to His prompting, if we fail to obey Him.|`|039863412b2033f40a328e6c2ae2dc51aa	No.  You walk away from Him.  Unrepentant, continual sin separates you from the Holy Spirit.

An important part of this process is that its many representatives, as a republic, are voted into office by the citizens themselves.  The Congress and Senate of the U.S. is rooted in Ancient Greek culture, as is the Executive branch of government.  These elements form the foundation of the democratic republic format that is the USA's process of leadership, management, representative assignment, and law formation.<br>  <br>  Other elements of Ancient greek (and Ancient Roman culture- itself derived from the Ancient Greek culture), including our poetry and philosophy (as we even still continue to quote Ancient Greek philosophers and poets to this day), as well many forms of art- namely familiar forms of sculpture, and we often borrow directly from Ancient Greek (and Ancient Roman) architecture, as Washington D.C. as an example displays many buildings replete with Greco-Roman columns and other features in the designs of all of monumental, governmental, and utilitarian buildings.  Such architectural examples can be found in many cities in every state of the union, and in a great many other places on the world.<br>  <br>  Even our own alphabet is clearly derived from the Greco-Roman alphabet, and from the Greco-Roman/Latin languages, many scientific terms are derived quite directly from those language roots/sources, so rich and complete as an ancient language, now not normally found in common language use, except largely scientifically, and in many very old religious services and rituals.<br>  <br>  Relatrive to philosophy, the Ancient Greeks are notable in that they initiated deep studies into the nature of man, his place in the universe, and how people interact with one another, and our common behaviors.  Much was investigated relation to family interactions, and serious attempts were undertaken to come to understand love, and sex, and how both can or did work together.  They attempted to enlighten themselves as to the working of the Human mind, and how it perceoved life, living, and the world around them, often touching deeply upon both emotional and spiritual aspects of life.  Much was explored as to man's presumed purpose in the universe, and how mankind fit into the grand scheme of things.  Philosophy provided much in the way of presented Human theory, an attempt at understanding Human nature, and the offering of advice... of varying quality or accuracy.  Philosophy as an art and science explored the complexity of Human existance, and on every subject, attempting to answer a great many Human questions about ourselves as a species.  Philosophy is in many ways a study of the Human condition, a study of a species struggling to comprehend it's own complex self, as a vital and sentient race.  Philosophy in a real sense the beginning of the attempt to study Human psychology.<br>  <br>  Also, clearly the scientific method was just being developed in Ancient Greek times, the 'birth' or it in a real sense based on theor knowledge of nature at the time, further refined by the Ancient Romans, then further developed into an art in Europe, then further by the United States and others.  The roots of clear scientific principles are found in Greek scientific culture.  It must be noted that it was in Ancient Grece that the Earth was determined to be round, not flat, and a very close estimate of the Earth's circumference was defined as far back as those times.  Ancient Greece was also at the center of European studies that was the beginning of the understanding of real effective medicine in treatng the ill, including delicate eye and brain surgeries.<br>  <br>  The internet is replete with enormous amounts of information about Ancient Greek culture, and how it influences all of us, even today, many hundreds of years since that culture, as it was, has passed on into history.  It's a big resource.  You really should tap into it :-)<br>  <br>  ~ Jonathan Rich

2YFjTFEgaa	Dear KAITLYN W, <br>  I see that you are NOT in the states so this may not be a practical idea in YOUR country. I know some fundamentalist nations/religions frown on dancing BUT<br>  Have you thought of sponsoring or cosponsoring some dances for your school? Or possibly even more than one school? <br>  How about presenting an LGBT questions and answers session for your school’s sex ed class? Or posably even doing the same as an “outreach” to other schools?<br>  Hugs,<br>  PennyAnn<br>  boring.freak2 and MAC,<br>  GSA = Gay Strait Alliance|`|8c516f13b410d238bfb6e465af4ac92baa	I'm guessing Gay Student Alliance.  Well you can organize a National Coming Out day event.  Sadly the gay community is very intimate with AIDS, so on World AIDS Day you could organize an event to raise awareness of AIDS and safe sex.  The gay community also advocates women's rights.  You can organize an event to celebrate Women's History Month (or week).  Along with that, you can rotate community service hours at the battered women's shelter and some food-bank type organization (I live in San Diego we have <a href="http://www.mamaskitchen.org/" rel="nofollow">http://www.mamaskitchen.org/</a> which helps those afflicted by AIDS).<br>  <br>  If you have any brave souls in your group that are interested in drag, you could put together a routine for your school's talent show.  Drag is basically flashy over the top cross dressing, think of a guy dressed like a Las Vegas show girl performing some sing/dance routine (lip synched usually).<br>  <br>  Halloween is always fun.  If you school does anything, see if your group can do something too, like pumpkin carving or whatever.   Just get out there and show people that gay students are good people too.<br>  <br>  Weekly meetings can be interesting too, with planning committees and a movie night.  Pick something that promotes the gay community and awareness.  Boys Don't Cry is a great film...but a sad one.  Once a month have a "night-out" event, like taking the group bowling or out to miniature golf.  Just go out and have fun, and see if LGBT students from other schools want to join you all for the fellowship and fun.|`|Oqa8ksLnaa	yeah whats a GSA|`|0iAFu5Vzaa	GSA? I just thought of several meanings for that, what is it?|`|AbfVNfnIaa	Not sure what GSA is but there's a lot of activities you can do.<br>  Volunteering together for LGBT organizations would be great. Even have guest speakers so that teens will feel like they have a support place they can go to if they are going thru situations with family, friends, etc...<br>  A<br>  Or hold fundraisers to again donate to LGBT organizations.<br>  <br>  Having poetry, open mic, etc... meetings.<br>  Taking trips to the library and checking out books to educate about the gay community.<br>  <br>  Doing projects-researching places that are gay-friendly, so as you grow up, you know where you can travel and be yourself. <br>  <br>  Having "coming out" stories is also positive experience. <br>  Discussing everyday life experiences are great too.

The Bible is not explicitly clear on when a person will reach their final eternal destiny. The Bible tells us that after the moment of death, a person is taken to Heaven or Hell based on whether he or she had received Christ as his or her Savior. For believers, after death is to be "away from the body and at home with the Lord" (2 Corinthians 5:6-8; Philippians 1:23). For unbelievers, after death means everlasting punishment in Hell (Luke 16:22-23).<br>  <br>  This is where it can get confusing as to what happens after death. Revelation 20:11-15 describes all those in Hell being cast into the lake of fire. Revelation chapters 21-22 describe a New Heaven and New Earth. Therefore, it seems that until the final resurrection, after death a person resides in a “temporary” Heaven and Hell. A person's eternal destiny will not change, but the precise "location" of a person's eternal destiny will change. At some point after death, believers will be sent to the New Heavens and New Earth (Revelation 21:1). At some point after death, unbelievers will be thrown into the lake of fire (Revelation 20:11-15). These are the final, eternal destinations of all people - based entirely on whether a person had trusted Jesus Christ alone for the salvation of their sins.<br>  <br>  Recommended Resource: What the Bible Says about Heaven & Eternity by Ice & Demy.|`|LRsd01Dtaa	First of all...there are some major misindoctrinations that have stemmed from the Roman Catholic Church. Let me clairify for you...though you would benefit from studying the Bible yourself..Let me start you on your journey...<br>  <br>  <br>  1. Immediate dispensation ~ Everybuddy is dead. Cept for a few choice peeps...everybuddy who is dead..is dead. We don't each have our own immortal soul. Its not biblical. We are physical beings created from the earth and given the Breath of life..once thats over...we are over too...except in the mind of God who will call us back into being on that last day to face judgement.<br>  <br>  2. Communion...or the "last supper" or "lords supper" is all symbolic...wine - blood, bread - scripture or blood - atonement and scripture means the Law. These are the keys to the Kingdom of God. Let me lays some serious symbology out for you and you might be able to make more sense...<br>  <br>  Field - the entire bible<br>  Wine - blood<br>  Water - cleansing<br>  Light - knowledge<br>  bread - scripture <br>  Word - the power of the Holy Spirit<br>  oil - anointing of the Holy Spirit<br>  tree - the mind<br>  branches - people<br>  hell - sheol, the grave, literally to be covered over or forgotten, outer darkness, to be non-exsistant.<br>  heaven - all that bluish black space type stuff<br>  Lake of Fire - earth in its distruction phase.<br>  <br>  So yes, the world will be destroyed along with all those who don't belong to Him. However, all will be raised to life again..some for the second death.<br>  <br>  Revelation 2:11<br>  He that hath an ear, let him hear what the Spirit saith unto the churches; He that overcometh shall not be hurt of the second death.<br>  <br>  Revelation 20:6<br>  Blessed and holy is he that hath part in the first resurrection: on such the second death hath no power, but they shall be priests of God and of Christ, and shall reign with him a thousand years.<br>  <br>  Revelation 20:14<br>  And death and hell were cast into the lake of fire. This is the second death.<br>  <br>  Revelation 21:8<br>  But the fearful, and unbelieving, and the abominable, and murderers, and whoremongers, and sorcerers, and idolaters, and all liars, shall have their part in the lake which burneth with fire and brimstone: which is the second death.<br>  <br>  <br>  However, as death and the grave (hell, sheol, hades) will also be thrown into the lake of fire...hell cannot be the lake of fire can it? No it will be destroyed cuz the true meaning of the word has been bastardized as well by the Catholic Church to take on a whole new meaning which states that peeps will burn eternally in a lake of fire and be tortured forever. Not true and not Biblically supported. As a matter of fact...scripture predicts that this belief will be taught...<br>  <br>  Isaiah 28:15<br>  Because ye have said, We have made a covenant with death, and with hell are we at agreement; when the overflowing scourge shall pass through, it shall not come unto us: for we have made lies our refuge, and under falsehood have we hid ourselves:<br>  <br>  Isaiah 28:18<br>  And your covenant with death shall be disannulled, and your agreement with hell shall not stand; when the overflowing scourge shall pass through, then ye shall be trodden down by it.<br>  <br>  Our promise and hope is in the resurrection to an eternal life with Christ in a new earth and a new heaven. When you die...you aren't waiting around for something to happen..there is no consciousness...its one instant to the other...time has ceased until you hear your name called again. So be cool. Its all good...sorta like taking a big long nap...a dirt nap...LOL...I have more on all this if you would like. Just email me..Love in Christ, ~J~|`|UhyvM73iaa	Christian view pf afterlife  as  they say is that heaven is for them only<br>  <br>  and hell is for rest of the world humans.  <br>  <br>  As a Muslim I say  heaven is those who believe in the God and are righteous people  regardless of which religion they belong to  and repent to God for forgiveness whey they happen to commit a sin.<br>  <br>  I know and say to you all <br>  <br>  that  Muslims will also go the heall who commit measure sins like murder, rape, and exploiting poor people, being cruel to women, children and animals  who can not defend themselves  and God has given them under their control as trust.

I think there are three heavens. We must all pass through the first two in an afterlife that could be hellish depending on the karma we earn in a previous life. The first heaven is where our emotional astral body will go upon our physical death.. When it dies there, the intellectual astral body will take over and proceed to the second heaven where it cannot avoid dying too and proceeding to the real Heaven to join God clothed with the causal body.

Pero hoy en día las donaciones se envían al tercer mundo (por ejemplo los regalos que le hacen al Papa etc). No es tan fácil convencer a la gente de que es mejor dar ese dinero a los pobres que hacer un altar de oro, a pesar de que se intenta concienciar de ello (de todos modos hoy no verás que se hace un altar de oro, sería un escándalo, afortunadamente). <br>  Espero haberte ayudado a comprender un poquito.<br>  De todos modos es curioso. Yo he visto a personas gastar un dineral en el banquete, el vestido, los invitados, etc. y sólo "dolerle" el dinero de la Iglesia (gasto mínimo en comparación). Suele ser normalmente, la gente que menos va a la iglesia y que menos implicada está. <br>  Te diré que si piden dinero para flores y demás, es porque cuesta dinero. Y si se quiere que la Iglesia se mantenga con su propia economía es justo que cuando se hace uso de un templo se ayude a los gastos de mantenimiento, etc. <br>  Una vez en un funeral de un amigo común. Un amigo de mi padre que era protestante (ya murió), dejó un gran billete en la cesta en la misa cuando la pasaron. A la salida mi padre le mostró su sorpresa: ?Pero si tú no eres católico! ?cómo has dado más dinero que nadie?<br>  Bueno, al margen de que aquel hombre tenía mucho dinero por su puesto de trabajo, le respondió a mi padre con naturalidad: "Bueno, en el templo hay gastos, seguro, y si he estado en él tengo que ayudar.

AA11104893	Those are all pagan symbols. The early christians incorporated them into their celebration to make converting pagans easier. The winter celebration is really about the winter solstice, when the light begins to come back to the world (rebirth of the sun god). The life which is carried throughout the winter is symbolised by the evergreen plants (like pine tree and holly). <br>  Santa and reindeer are actually taken either from a lappi legend about a bear god who runs through the forest chasing deer or the Norse legend about the wild hunt. <br>  Santa at first used to be some sort of a wild forest man, clad in greenery and ivy.

That's fact. Yet women are supposedly smarter. also fact, but doubtful in my opinion, however proven because if men were smart they wouldn't prey victim to the vagina that sucks up your money and your life!|`|BZnWmkofaa	First of all, your starting premises are 100% wrong.<br>  <br>  Men, as a GROUP, make more $$$ because men, as a GROUP, work more years of their lives (98% of stay at home spouses right now are women) and more hours of the week. <br>  <br>  So, the "wage gap" is pure MYTH. <br>  <br>  Next, how is women having the babies a "blow" *against* women ? If you don't want any, then don't have them; Duh.<br>  <br>  Given that women get several POST coital NON medical and NON biological legal means with which to void ALL of their parental responsibilities, while men DON'T get that Equal Right, this is also an area where women have MORE rights than men and FEWER duties than men. <br>  <br>  The "on the other hand" material all well speaks to why many men are now on a Marriage Strike. Because women such as you describe are entitlement besotted narcissists, who torpedo over 70% of all marriages. <br>  <br>  The basic fact exists: Men have FEWER rights and women, and MORE enforced RESPOSIBILITIES. |`|tARCVubcaa	There is definitely inequality between the sexes.

El texto tambien hace referencia a que Jesús tomo como algo suyo y engrandeció para comenzar a edificar el Reino de Dios en la tierra todo lo que la sociedad de la época rechazaba: pobres, enfermos, parias, mujeres (incluso prostitutas), publicanos (recaudadores de impuestos, lo más bajo y despreciado de aquella sociedad judia)... Vamos, todos aquellos que nadie invitaría a comer con él entonces (Jesús sí lo hizo).<br>  <br>  Sobre esa "roca" (que es tanto del cielo como de la tierra), Jesús nombre a Pedro su "roca" en la tierra, que está basada en la otra "roca", la de Jésús (es como si fuera su cimiento).<br>  <br>  Jesús como Hijo de Dios esta libre de pecado, pero tanto Pedro (como se cita varias veces en el Evangelio) y los sucesivos Papas son hombres y como tales pecadores (también con muchas virtudes).<br>  <br>  Un saludo!|`|k0v2z1sxaa	Por supuesto que la Roca fundamental es el Se?or Jesucristo, a través de su predicación y su acto redentor, fuente de gracia abundantísima; pero él es Dios, y como hombre glorioso resucitado ascendió al cielo. Por su parte, la Iglesia es de hombres; por ello, la piedra humana, imagen y representante del Se?or Jesucristo, sobre la que edificó su Iglesia, es Pedro y su profesión de fe, ?por qué entonces cambió su nombre de Simón a Pedro (Piedra)?. Subrayo: la cabeza del cuerpo místico es el propio Se?or Jesús, pero en este mundo dejó a sus apóstoles para predicar, bautizar y transmitir su gracia, los cuales estuvieron bajo el principado de Pedro, según la ordenanza del Salvador: "Tú eres Pedro y sobre esta Piedra edificaré mi Iglesia".

Esto no porque Jesucristo no quería ser esa piedra, sino porque Jesucristo partiría pronto hacia el Padre y la Iglesia que estaba fundando no podía ser a base de un espíritu (fantasma dirían los ateos), sino que esa nueva Iglesia debía ser fundada por seres humanos.<br>  En cuando a la Primera Carta de San Pedro, en Hechos 4,11 y la Primera Carta a los Corintios 3, 10-11, cuando se habla de la "piedra" o la "roca", aquí Sí se está hablando de Jesucristo, quien es la piedra angular que fue despreciada por los constructores (pero los constructores no de la iglesia material, sino de los constructores del Reino).<br>  Recuerda que esta frase pertenece al Libro del Antiguo Testamento llamado Deutoronomio. Cuando los antiguos arquitectos o ingenieros construían un puente, empezaban por ambos lados hasta toparse en el centro. Ahí usaban una piedra en forma angular o triangular para amarrar toda la construcción. Esa piedra tenía que ser una piedra fuerte, tenía que ser una piedra viva, no podía ser cualquier piedra. Por eso los picapiedreros visitaban los tajos, los ríos, todo lado, buscando esa piedra angular que les sirviera para el amarre. En esa búsqueda, esos ingenieros o arquitectos despreciaban muchas piedras, que a la postre eran muy buenas para eso. A eso se refiere este versículo. A que Jesucristo es la piedra angular, la más importante de la Iglesia, y nosotros los católicos, somos la demás estructura.<br>  Y por favor, no confundamos: Jesucristo es el Mesías, el Hijo del Dios Vivo.

Pedro lo confirmo en Hechos 4:12, y en su primera carta 2:4-8, donde asegura, que Cristo es Piedra Viva, y reconoce que el es uno de esas piedras que conforman el edificio. Esto esta de acuerdo, con lo que dijo Jesús:<br>  “Tu eres Cefas (Piedra peque?a), y sobre esta Piedra (La Revelación que había hecho antes, acerca del Cristo, como Hijo del Dios Viviente). Pablo también confirma el asunto, cuando dice que nadie puede poner otro fundamento (1 Corintios 3:11), y que la principal piedra del ángulo es Cristo (Efesios 2:20).<br>  Gracias, su servidor, Geronimo<br>  |`|VwVtZbvpaa	Jesús sigue presente en su Iglesia,como él mismo lo anunció.Y está presente de muchas maneras.Por ejemplo,cuando un hombre bautiza es Jesús quien bautiza,pero no por eso el hombre deja de bautizar, aunque sea jesús el que da lo que sólo él puede dar, el espíritu Santo.Cuando un sacerdote perdona los pecados en la confesión, es Jesús quien los perdona; cuando Pedro ata o desata en la tierra, es Jesús quien ata o desata en el Cielo. Lo mismo, la roca que es Pedro, no es distinta de la roca que es Jesús, ni son distintos los fundamentos de la Iglesia que son los Apóstoles del único fundamento que es Cristo.San Pablo en I Cora 3,11 dice que el único fundamento es Cristo y en Efesios 2,20 dice que están edificados sobre el fundamento de los Apóstoles y no hay contradicción en ello, como no la hay en que Cristo sea la roca y Pedro sea la roca.Cristo es la roca en cada momento de la historia a través de Pedro como lo fue en vida del Pedro de Galilea.|`|QjXUDH7Iaa	sin duda ni mateo ni tu teneis razón, la roca sobre la que se edifico la iglesia católica fue sobre la de la mentira que atormenta a millones de fieles con la amenaza del castigo eterno de la que se valen para controlar a todos aquellos que débiles de mente se entregan con la promesa de una vida eterna o de la salvación de su alma|`|cg5R2d72aa	JESUS ES LA ROCA <br>  EL ES EL UNICO <br>  PODEROSO QUE PUEDE SOSTENER LA IGLESIA<br>  COMO PUEDE ATRIBUIRSELE A UN SER<br>  HUMANO SER LA BASE DE LA IGLESIA<br>  EL UNICO EN EL CUAL PODEMOS SIMENTAR<br>  NUESTRA VIDA ES EN CRISTO JESUS. <br>  EDIFICA SOBRE LA ROCA <br>  EDIFICA TU VIDA SOBRE JESUS|`|4jNtAb48aa	hombre prudente el que edifico su casa en la roca eh insensato el que lo hizo en la arena dios dice a Abaham tu ecendecia sera como la arena de ahi los hombres son arena cortada de la rocca pero arena movediza jesus la rocca de salvacion y piedra de tropiezo paralos incredulos|`|KZsiNj63aa	Bueno todas las filosofias y las doctrina han chocado contra la piedra angular , pero estas se han desaparecido , tiene un tiempo , pero Dios , ni  el   cristianismo  , han de desaparecer , porque simplemente es el Dios vivo y Cristo Jesus , el hijo de Dios ...!!!|`|QAGW2Emwaa	Jesús sin duda alguna, pero eso no lo entienden las personas porque no leen sus Biblias y se dejan llevar por doctrinas de hombres que solo los llevan por caminos de perdición.<br>  <br>  Dios les bendiga.|`|1mn0wrDpaa	Para nosotros los católicos es una verdad de fe que Cristo constituyó al apóstol San Pedro como primero entre los apóstoles y como cabeza visible de toda la Iglesia,|`|lH2qGro6aa	Una roca sedimentaria pues se esta erosionando|`|Z4VrXijfaa	Maria Magdalena|`|RB7ImZcsaa	Cristo|`|0e1euicsaa	Jesucristo mismo!!!<br>  es bueno leer los contextos no???<br>  salu2|`|XYj2oG2caa	la roca es un luchador del ring y ahora es tambien actor de cine|`|c232PksKaa	Jeus es la Roca...<br>  <br>  Dios te Bendiga|`|5uYIujBsaa	jesus|`|K25NOHNiaa	Jesús.|`|0v6iPw32aa	Por favor NO te vengas acá con estas "MAMADAS", porque si tú se lo creiste a tu "pastorcito lindo", pues te sabré decir que fuiste, eres y seguirás siendo un "borregito" MáS, destinado al "matadero del PROTESTANTISMO", siempre y cuando pretendas seguir en esta OSCURIDAD, que de "luz", créeme que NO TIENES ABSOLUTAMENTE NADA.<br>  <br>  Seamos CONCRETOS y OBJETIVOS con esto que estás exponiendo en esta tu pregunta. NO te "hagas el LOCO", al querer MANIPULAR y TERGIVERSAR estas citas, la cual, completamente, dice así:<br>  <br>  "Bienaventurado eres Simón, hijo de Jonás, porque no te ha revelado esto la carne ni la sangre, sino mi Padre que está en los cielos. Y yo a mi vez te digo que tú eres Pedro y sobre esta piedra edificaré mi Iglesia y las puertas del infierno no prevalecerán contra ella. Y a ti te daré las llaves del Reino de los Cielos y lo que ates en la tierra quedará atado en el cielo y lo que desates en la tierra quedará desatado en los cielos. -Mateo 16: 13-20. <br>  <br>  Dar las llaves significa entregar la autoridad sobre la Iglesia con el poder de gobernar, de permitir y prohibir.  Pero no se trata de un gobierno como los del mundo sino en función de servicio por amor: "el mayor entre vosotros sea el último de todos y el servidor de todos" (Mt 23,11). <br>  <br>  Deberíamos de comenzar, ya que nadie lo ha tocado por acá, de que Pedro inicialmente se llamaba "Simón", y fue Jesús que le cambió el nombre a "Cefas = Pedro = Piedra" (Jn. 1:42)... ??POR QUé??... para indicar su NUEVA identidad o misión, como por ejemplo: Abraham = Padre de muchas naciones (Gen. 17:5); Israel = Fuerza de Dios (Gen. 32:28); Jesús = Salvador (Mt. 1:21); ETC.<br>  <br>  Tal y como te darás cuenta El mismo Jesús le entregó a Pedro TODA AUTORIDAD, al decirle:<br>  <br>  "YO te daré las llaves del Reino de los cielos: TODO lo que ates en la tierra será atado en el cielo, y lo que desates en la tierra será desatado en los cielos (Mt. 16:19).<br>  <br>  Y lo hizo también PASTOR SUPREMO del reba?o, con la misión de GUIAR y FORTALECER a los hermanos en la fe, le dijo:<br>  <br>  "Simón, hijo de Juan, ?me amas más que a estos?. Este contestó: Si, Se?or, tú sabes que te quiero. Jesús le dijo: APACIENTA MIS CORDEROS./ Y le preguntó por segunda vez: Simón, hijo de Juan, ?me amas?. Pedro volvió a contestar: Si Se?or, tú sabes que te quiero. Jesús le dijo: CUIDA MIS OBEJAS./ Insistió Jesús por tercera vez: Simón Pedro hijo de Juan, ?me quieres? Pedro se puso triste al ver que Jesús le preguntaba por tercera vez si lo quería. Le contestó: Se?or, tú sabes TODO, tú sabes que te quiero. Entonces Jesús le dijo: APACIENTA MIS OVEJAS (Jn. 21:15-17).<br>  <br>  También le dijo:<br>  "Simón, mira que Satanás ha pedido permiso para sacudirlos a ustedes como se hace con el trigo; pero YO he rogado por ti para que tu fe NO se venga abajo. Tú, entonces, cuando hayas vuelto, tendrás que FORTALECER a tus hermanos" (Lc. 22:31-32).<br>  <br>  De hecho San Pedro actuó SIEMPRE como JEFE DE LOS APóSTOLES y de TODA la Iglesia (Hech. 2:14 / Hech. 15:1-29 / Gal. 1:18 / Gal. 2:2-10 / ETC., ETC., ETC.)<br>  <br>  ??ES MáS!!, viendo SU biblia ("reina vailadera"), está ahí... ??PORQUé SE HACEN LOS LOCOS??./ Como SECTAS PROTESTANTES pues eso de LOCOS se de sobra que les "luce" y les "adorna", pero DECIR MENTIRAS, DIFAMACIONES, ULTRAJES, FALSOS TESTIMONIOS... ??híjole!!, pienso que se les va la mano con eso de INTERPRETAR a su sabor y antojo SU "biblia".<br>  <br>  Ustedes los PROTESTANTES están más perdidos que "los hijos de la llorona"./ Como NO tienen "madre", pues a veces pienso que son hijos auténticos de la "LLORONA", porque tienen sus "genes" de andar gritando y asustando a la gente a TODA hora, como si NO tuvieran "algo" que HACER (=OBRAS) basados a que solo la "fe" les vasta para sentirse merecedores del "reino de su dios".<br>  <br>  ??A DIOS!!<br>  (TODA LA HONRA, HONOR Y GLORIA)<br>  |`|4qDJbc3Uaa	Kefa<br>  SHIMON  BEN  IOJANáN<br>  <br>  Iahoshua edifica sobre Shimon, no sobre su declaración.<br>  <br>  <br>  La tradición que se transmitió por escrito por los primeros discípulos claramente deja ver que Iahoshúa delegó el liderazgo más en Shim’ón Kefa Ben Iojanán que en cualquier otro discípulo. Esta responsabilidad la llevo a cabo con éxito después de la ausencia física del Rav, se documentó que miles y miles de personas se unieron al Movimiento en Israel bajo el liderazgo de Shimon Kefa. <br>  <br>  Recordemos que cierta vez cuando Iahoshúa preguntó a sus talmidim: "?Qué dice la gente acerca de mí?" Shim’ón Kefa respondió: "Tu eres el Mashíaj, el Rey de Israel elegido por el Elohim viviente”, y Iahoshúa le dijo: “Dichoso eres Shim'ón bar ioná porque carne y sangre no te lo han revelado, sino el Padre que está en los cielos. Yo te digo que tú eres una piedra y sobre ti yo edificaré mi Bet T'filá, y los portones del Guehinóm no podrán estar ante ti porque yo te daré las llaves del Reino de los Cielos y todo lo que atares en la tierra será atado en los Cielos; y así todo lo que permitas en la tierra será permitido en los Cielos”. El mensaje es claro, la palabra aramea ‘Kefa’ significa roca o piedra (Even ???), haciendo así un juego de palabras con ‘Edificaré’ (Evne ????), Rabenu Iahoshúa dice que Shim’ón Kefa es la fundación de la comunidad de los discípulos del Mashíaj, de forma similar como Avraham es identificado como una Roca (Ieshayáhu 51.1-2 la fundación de Israel), y agrega que los portones del Guehinóm no podrán estar ante él, esto quiere decir que bajo el liderazgo de Kefa no será la destrucción para el Movimiento, (ver Tehilim 9.13; 107.18; Ieshayáhu 38.10 e Iov 17.16 y 38.17 donde ‘las puertas del Sheol’ es una alusión a ‘la destrucción’ o   ‘la muerte’)<br>  <br>  Este texto donde Iahoshua le dice que sobre Kefa va a edificar la comunidad de los discípulos del Mashiaj es usado por algunos lectores para especular que la edificación de la comunidad no es sobre Shimon, sino sobre su declaración. Pero como podemos apreciar el texto hebreo es claro “sobre ti yo edificaré”.<br>

kFobe3kraa	“?Cómo Sabes Que La Biblia Es Verdad?”<br>  Esta es probablemente la pregunta con la que encontraremos con más frecuencia. La gente quiere saber, tal como Pilato: “?Qué es verdad?” (Juan 18:38). En Juan 17:17, Jesús dice de la Palabra de Dios: “Tu Palabra es verdad”. Definitivamente, toda la información interna de la Biblia apunta a que es la verdadera Palabra de Dios.<br>       Sin embargo, muchas personas pueden acusar de usar un razonamiento circular si el creyente intenta comprobar su postura de esta forma. La mayoría de los creyentes contestan que ellos creen que es la verdad. Recuerda “No importa lo que crees, lo que importa es la verdad.” Entonces, ?existe evidencia externa que comprueba que la Biblia es verdad? ?Por supuesto que sí!<br>       Yo como creyente acostumbro usar cinco puntos para demostrar que la Biblia es verdad. Después de haber compartido estos puntos en un retiro, la gente se me acercó para decirme que esta era una de las cosas más valiosas que había aprendido.<br>  <br>  1.La Biblia es el libro de mayo venta en todo el mundo<br>  Esta declaración no significa que la Biblia sea verdad peor por ser el libro de mayor venta en toda la historia, deberíamos considerarlo. ?La venta de Biblias en un a?o está alrededor de los 150 millones de dólares y aproximadamente 4 mi millones de dólares en total de ventas! Ningún otro libro se acerca a estas cifras. Si la gente pasa tiempo leyendo libros de Shakespeare y John Grisham, ?porqué no leer el libro más famoso del mundo?<br>       Te desafío a pensar con el pensamiento deque existe una buena probabilidad de que la Biblia contenga al menos algo de verdad y leerla es una muy buena forma de averiguarlo.<br>  <br>  2.La Biblia dice haber sido escrita por Dios<br>  Este es un punto crucial. Las personas inconversas creen que la Biblia fue escrita por hombres, pero la Biblia reclama a Dios como si autor:<br>  “Toda Escritura es inspirada por Dios...”<br>  (2 Timoteo 3:16).<br>  “Porque nunca la profecía fue traída por voluntad humana, sino que los santos hombres de Dios hablaron siendo inspirados por el Espíritu Santo” <br>  (2 Pedro 1:21).<br>       Sin embargo, solamente porque la Biblia reclama a Dios como su autor, ?significa que lo es? En realidad, no. Yo podría escribirte una carta diciéndote lo que tienes que hacer y firmarla “Con amor, Dios”. Pero eso no significa que Dios la haya escrito.<br>       Necesitamos más evidencias que eso. Un predicador dijo que la Biblia usa frases como “así ha dicho el Se?or” y otras similares en más de 3,000 ocasiones. La Biblia ciertamente declara que su autoría es divina y no humana.<br>       Estos primeros dos puntos pueden agudizar el interés de la persona. Los próximos tres puntos son la evidencia que están buscando.<br>  <br>  3.La evidencia histórica respalda la Biblia<br>  Nadie ha podido aún identificar ni siquiera un error histórico en la Biblia. Eso de por sí es asombroso. Si un hombre fuera el autor, ciertamente encontraríamos errores históricos después de tantos a?os – pero no hay ninguno. Para estudiar más respecto a este punto, al igual que los próximos dos puntos, te recomiendo que leas uno de los siguientes libros:<br>  ? Evidencia que exige un veredicto, escrito por Josh McDowell (Thomas Nelson)<br>  ? El caso de Cristo, de Lee Strobel (Zondervan Corp.)<br>      <br>       Estos dos libros proveen evidencias poderosas de que la Biblia no proviene del pu?o del hombre, sino de la misma mano del Dios todopoderoso.<br>  <br>  4.La evidencia arqueológica respalda la Biblia<br>  Hasta la fecha, los arqueólogos no han descubierto un solo objeto en el Medio Oriente que haya comprobado que la Biblia esté equivocada. Es más, con cada descubrimiento se continúa comprobando su veracidad. “Ha habido más de 25,000 descubrimientos arqueológicos relacionados a personas, lugares y eventos mencionados en la Biblia, y ni uno solo ha contradicho las Escrituras”. Esa es una prueba irrefutable de la confiabilidad de la Biblia.<br>       Después de mencionar algunas de las evidencias arqueológicas que respaldan la Biblia, digo lo siguiente: ”Si usted puede creer la evidencia histórica y arqueológica de la Biblia, ?qué le hace pensar que no puede creer la parte espiritual del libro?” Eso normalmente deja a uno pensando.<br>      <br>  5.Las profecías que se han cumplido convalidan la Biblia<br>  Las profecías que se han cumplido a lo largo de la historia no son solamente prueba deque la Biblia es verdad, sino que también comprueban la existencia de Dios.<br>       Muy a menudo les pregunto a las personas: “?Cuál es el único libro de todo el mundo que contiene cientos de profecías muy detalladas?” La respuesta correcta es la Biblia. El Libro de Mormón no las tiene; el Corán de los musulmanes tampoco; el Bhagavad Gita de los hindúes no las tiene.<br>       Les pregunto: “Si el texto contiene profecías que no se cumplen, ?qué dice eso respecto a ese libro?” Las personas responden que el libro es falso. Un hombre con el que conversaba apuntó al cesto de basura y dijo: “?Tiene que ir allí, en la basura!” él sabía que si un libro predice algo que no|`|uYgXUTZMaa	SE  CUMPLE'? jajajajaja<br>  <br>  bueno cada kien es  libre de creerse cualquier cosa|`|ded1ecf15deb74482fe14810bbe25219aa	EL JUSTO POR SU FE, VIVIRA|`|ziza4argaa	uyyy si tan dificil que es predecir eso.<br>  <br>  te predijera algo. ma?ana va a llover en algun lugar del mundo.<br>  <br>  <br>  |`|ISqmix5xaa	xq a pesar de que supuestamente los evangelios fueron escritas por personas fieles, su "edicion " fue hecha por los romanos, omitiendo muchaas cosas, como creer si no tienes toda la version completa?<br>  solo te pusieron lo que querian que creyeramos, y por eso mejor yo no creo!|`|PHGDJOjgaa	jajaja<br>  <br>  <br>  es como si yo dijera<br>  <br>  YO SOY EL MEJOR DEL MUNDO, PERO EN EL FUTURO LO DESMENTIRA, EN EL FUTURO HABRA OTROS QUE SE CREEN MEJOR QUE YO, HABRA OVEJAS DESCARRIADAS QUE NO CREERAN QUE YOOOO SOY EL MEJOR<br>  <br>  woww estuve en lo cierto<br>  se cumplio lo que dijee<br>  <br>  jajajaj<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  ?catolicos...ustedes son quienes dicen que el hombre hace de este mundo, algo insoportable?<br>  <a href="http://es.answers.yahoo.com/question/index;_ylt=Ag5hGPMkQc47drpa6wSRUG1o.gt.;_ylv=3?qid=20081008110704AAwuJVD">http://es.answers.yahoo.com/question/ind...</a><br>  |`|LFCEhivgaa	Es sencillo: Por que es la Palabra de Dios.

Ntb4QfKKaa	Firstly, moisten your lips. Dry lips do not move well together. Just a light brush of your tongue over your lips will be sufficient to moisten them. <br>  <br>  Secondly, angle your head. If your mouths meet dead-on, your noses will get in the way, and you will not be able to kiss deeply or smoothly so tilt your head slightly to the side.<br>  <br>   Then close your eyes. As you approach for the kiss, look into your partner's eyes, but, once you are close to theirs, close your eyes. It can be a bit of a turnoff to be kissing and going cross-eyed. <br>  <br>  Start with a gentle and soft closed-mouth kiss. The French kiss is an open-mouth kiss, but do not lunge in with your lips agape like you're going to eat them; instead, open your lips very slowly. <br>  <br>  Explore with your tongue. If you and your partner seem to be enjoying the open-mouth kiss, slowly try to open your mouth a little bit more and gently push your tongue a little farther into their mouth. Go slow and don't forget to breathe.<br>  <br>  Mix it up. Kisses are like snowflakes: no two are exactly the same. Once you finally feel comfortable French kissing someone, it is tempting to try to do the same thing every time. Add variety. Sometimes kiss deeper, for example, and other times pay more attention to the lips than the tongue. Hold the kiss longer or shorter and explore the art of kissing. When something feels good for each of you, still keep it interesting :)<br>  <br>  |`|9t088tuUaa	It's really hard to explain but if you look it up on the internet some guides come up for teen girls.

WPqGZhlMaa	Ohhh thats awesome! im being bella as well, heres and idea: For the hair you could use a curling iron to make soft curls (use a good amount of hairspray to make 'em stay!), for your make up i say this: get a foundation,concelear, and maybe powder about 1-2 shades lighter than your natural skin tone (Trust me you DONT want to use that fake white junk from halloween stores!), depending on what your skin color IS, use a lip gloss that is between a darkish pink to a ruby red (i recomend a shade of red if your goin as newborn bella). apply a little bit of a rose-y blush to the apples of your cheeks, but dont over do it.. vampires arent flushed. use a little bit of a purple pigment shadow and a bit of purple rain shimmer dust (<a href="http://www.hottopic.com/hottopic/store/product.jsp?FOLDER%3C%3Efolder_id=2534374302028572&PRODUCT%3C%3Eprd_id=845524442187836&bmUID=1224392899599)" rel="nofollow">http://www.hottopic.com/hottopic/store/p...</a> dust a little of the pigment under your eyes to create a bit of a thirsty look. line your eyes with a dark grey or purple liner on the bottom and a VERY thin line on top. then dust the shimmer over the top of your eyes. Now for the clothes:<br>  try using a hyacinth blue sweater or dress... if your not fond of the dress idea you could go with the blue sweater (v-neck) and a dark wash jean. for the shoes maybe a flat boot, since bella does DESPISE heels. I say personally the gold/topaz contacts, but they dont come cheap! the cheapest ive found has been 58 dollars a pair! so if you have hazel-dark brown eyes: dont worry about it!!! for instance in breaking dawn bella has to wear contacts to fool her dad.. and your eyes could be bella when shes getting thirsty!<br>  <br>  heres a link to a good sweater, dress, jeans, and shoes!<br>  <br>  dress----<a href="http://www.wetseal.com/catalog/product.jsp?productId=14268&categoryId=104&parentCategoryId=0&productVariantId=93228&quantity=1&itemGUID=16b82562c0a86f82004b62a7c561d3a6" rel="nofollow">http://www.wetseal.com/catalog/product.j...</a><br>  <br>  sweater---- <a href="http://www.wetseal.com/catalog/product.jsp?productId=14062&productVariantId=91836&quantity=1&itemGUID=16bb9055c0a86f82004b62a716ab3c36" rel="nofollow">http://www.wetseal.com/catalog/product.j...</a><br>  <br>  jeans--- <a href="http://www.target.com/Juniors-Xhilaration-Skinny-Denim-Jeans/dp/B001762AL8/sr=1-2/qid=1224447761/ref=sr_1_2/601-8677775-6948950?ie=UTF8&index=target&field-browse=1041790&rh=k%3Ajeans%2Cn%3A702352011&page=1" rel="nofollow">http://www.target.com/Juniors-Xhilaratio...</a> <br>  <br>  shoes--- <a href="http://www.target.com/Womens-Mossimo-Katrina-Boot-Black/dp/B001BSCWZ6/qid=1224447921/ref=br_1_11/601-8677775-6948950?ie=UTF8&node=370189011&frombrowse=1&pricerange=&index=tgt-mf-mv&field-browse=370189011&rank=price&rh=&page=5" rel="nofollow">http://www.target.com/Womens-Mossimo-Kat...</a><br>  <br>  Makeup links!!<br>  <br>  eyeliner--- <a href="http://www.target.com/JK-Jemma-Kidd-I-Tech-Eyeliner/dp/B001BNYLPA/ref=in_de_detail-buybox-with-variations/601-8677775-6948950" rel="nofollow">http://www.target.com/JK-Jemma-Kidd-I-Te...</a><br>  <br>  <br>  eyeshadow--- <a href="http://www.target.com/Sonia-Kashuk-Eye-Shadow-Quad/dp/B0016HH90K/qid=1224448207/ref=br_1_9/601-8677775-6948950?ie=UTF8&node=671446011&frombrowse=1&pricerange=&index=tgt-mf-mv&field-browse=671446011&rank=pmrank&rh=&page=5" rel="nofollow">http://www.target.com/Sonia-Kashuk-Eye-S...</a><br>  <br>  mascara--- <a href="http://www.target.com/Neutrogena-Healthy-Mascara-Carbon-Black/dp/B00118ZXNY/qid=1224448268/ref=br_1_16/601-8677775-6948950?ie=UTF8&node=671446011&frombrowse=1&pricerange=&index=tgt-mf-mv&field-browse=671446011&rank=pmrank&rh=&page=6" rel="nofollow">http://www.target.com/Neutrogena-Healthy...</a><br>  <br>  <br>  lips---   <a href="http://www.target.com/Boots-Botanics-Lip-Gloss-Loganberry/dp/B000PSZ4E4/qid=1224448376/ref=br_1_8/601-8677775-6948950?ie=UTF8&node=671447011&frombrowse=1&pricerange=&index=tgt-mf-mv&field-browse=671447011&rank=pmrank&rh=&page=2" rel="nofollow">http://www.target.com/Boots-Botanics-Lip...</a><br>  <br>  cheeks--- <a href="http://www.target.com/Sonia-Cheeker-Sheers-Gelstick-12-oz/dp/B000G187EO/ref=sc_ri_4/601-8677775-6948950" rel="nofollow">http://www.target.com/Sonia-Cheeker-Shee...</a><br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  ----I REALLY hope this helps! if you wan to know any more ideas im full of em!! just message me ;)|`|OaZk8It8aa	well that is a very popular character so i think many people may know who you are, and if they don't they definitely will if you explain it. also that sounds really,really pretty, which is perfect just in case they don't know!:]          oh but btw, DOES she have little fangs like that?i thought she was human? guess not,sorry, im not quite sure..=/|`|AA11402639	yea no one is going to know what you are.

(Isa 14:4,?12.) La expresión hebrea que se traduce “el resplandeciente” (TNM), “el reluciente” (BAS, nota), “astro rutilante” (CI) o “estrella brillante” (RH) proviene de una raíz que significa “brillar”. (Job 29:3.) La traducción “Lucifer” (Ga, Scío) se deriva de la Vulgata latina.<br>  <br>  Se representa al “resplandeciente” diciendo en su corazón: “Por encima de las estrellas de Dios alzaré mi trono, y me sentaré sobre la monta?a de reunión”. (Isa 14:13.)<br>  <br>  De las Escrituras se deduce que esta “monta?a de reunión” es el monte Sión. Por consiguiente, como las estrellas pueden representar a reyes (Nú 24:17; Rev 22:16), la expresión “estrellas de Dios” tiene que referirse a los reyes del linaje davídico que gobernaron desde el monte Sión.<br>  <br>  El “rey de Babilonia” (la dinastía de reyes babilonios) reveló su ambición —semejante a la de Satanás, el dios de este sistema de cosas— de alzar su trono “por encima de las estrellas de Dios”, al intentar convertir en meros vasallos a los reyes del linaje de David y finalmente destronarlos.<br>  <br>  El “rey de Babilonia” resplandecía en el mundo antiguo como estrellas que despiden luz, y se le podía llamar “el resplandeciente”.<br>  <br>  También, los versículos quince y dieciséis de este capítulo catorce dicen que este “brillante” (Lucero) ha de ser bajado al Seol, que es el sepulcro común de la humanidad, no?un lugar de habitación para Satanás el Diablo.<br>  <br>  Además, el hecho es que los que ven a este “brillante” reducido a esta condición dicen: “?Es éste el HOMBRE que estuvo agitando la tierra, que estuvo haciendo mecerse los reinos?” <br>  <br>  Satanás no?es un hombre sino una criatura espíritu invisible. Por consiguiente, aunque el rey de Babilonia reflejó la actitud de su padre, el Diablo, no?obstante la palabra Lucero no?fue un nombre dado a Satanás el Diablo.<br>  <br>  Aunque el trata de aparentar ser un ángel de luz, segun 2da a los Corintios 11:14|`|GheAF0d8aa	En ninguna parte de la Biblia dice que Jesús es Lucifer. Este nombre fue dado al ángel Luzbel que era el angel amado de Dios, pero Luzbel quiso ser como Dios y fue expulsado de los cielos por rebelde.Lucifer es Satanás y no Jesús.<br>  Infórmate un poco antes de hacer una pregunta.No malinterpretes la Palabra de Dios.-|`|ovVyxIglaa	chas lo unico que puedo decir es que man tu como otras personas mas le tienen algo asi como envidia al rey de reyes y se?or de se?ores   dia tras dia quieren cambiar un hecho que fue real y lo seguira siendo<br>  <br>  recuerda la biblia a pasado por babylonia por varias manos como en roma y a sido cambiada <br>  <br>  pero recuerda que los viejos sacerdortes tienen antiguos testamentos, libros exodorsos y ellos tiene la prueba de la verdad la biblia que leiste el gobierno y la iglesia catolica ya la cambiaron.|`|XCI1TMU7aa	Para empezar en apocalisis 2:28 no dice lucero dice estrella y en cuanto a la divición q causa Jesus, es una divición distinta a la q causa satanas; satanas quiere apartar al creyente de Dios y  Jesucristo vino a separar a la humanidad del mundo y del pecado. Santiago 4:4|`|Uj5qLpj3aa	pues lucifer es en si, portador de la luz, y bueno se podira decir q jesus portaria la lluz, pero en su significado biblico, no se habla de la misma cosa, a demas hay q tomar en cuenta q la biblia a sido cambiada, trastocada,por lo tanto no se puede confiar en esta como si fuera textual.<br>  <br>  Pd: soy catolico, pero teno mi propia vision de mi fe|`|JuCczMLraa	Un lucero no significa lo mismo que el ángel Lucifer, además, entonces, por que la biblia ha de llamarlo Jesús?<br>  <br>  Soy ateo, pero, en mi opinión, tu malinterpretación ni siquiera me causo gracia :S|`|d08e4e818865418bbf2937ac0812d7baaa	Eso es lo que pasa con los protestantes, creéis que la Biblia la puede interpretar cualquiera.

Entonces Lucifer dejó de ser el angel de luz para convertirse en el espíritu de las tinieblas por haber perdido la gracia del Se?or.<br>  Jesús es la Luz del mundo, el verdadero camino, El Redentor, pero  para los que creyeran en El, escucharan su palabra y la pusieran por obra. El Se?or llama a todos, pero El dijo "muchos serán los llamados pero pocos serán los escogidos" por qué, por Jesús quiere la salvación para todos, pero no todos están dispuestos a seguirlo, por lo tanto y, en especial dentro de las familias de los creyentes, El anunciaba la tribulación por la que pasarían los cristianos por haber entregado su vida a Jesús. Es una advertencia, de que el demonio se iba a resistir, que iba a poner  la duda y la división dentro de las familias, allí donde para el cristiano será más difícil mantener su fe. <br>  Eso pasa en la actualidad, cuando un miembro de una familia se acerca a Dios, los demás se van a sentir recelosos, no van a entender, el mal los va a mantener al margen y los va a poner en contra justamente para hacer desistir a esa persona en su fe tocandole donde más le duele.<br>  Jesús nos advertía de esa lucha por la que deberemos pasar, pero es una lucha contra el mal, es una batalla espiritual.|`|jfTzDFGlaa	Si lo sabia, lucifer significa “resplandeciente”, “el reluciente” (BAS, nota), “astro rutilante” (CI) o “estrella brillante” (RH) proviene de una raíz que significa “brillar”. (Job 29:3.) La traducción “Lucifer” (Ga, Scío) se deriva de la Vulgata latina.<br>  En la Biblia se hace referencia a las estrellas con un sentido figurado y en metáforas o símiles para representar a ciertas personas, como en el sue?o de José, en el que sus padres estaban representados por el Sol y la Luna, y sus once hermanos, por once estrellas. (Gé 37:9,?10.) En Job 38:7 se establece un paralelo entre “las estrellas de la ma?ana” que clamaron gozosamente cuando se fundó la Tierra y los “hijos de Dios” angélicos. El resucitado y ensalzado Jesús dijo que él era “la brillante estrella de la ma?ana” y prometió a sus seguidores que si vencían, les daría “la estrella de la ma?ana”, lo que daba a entender que tendrían parte con él en su puesto y gloria celestiales. (Rev 22:16; 2:26,?28; compárese con 2Ti 2:12; Rev 20:6.) A los siete “ángeles” de las congregaciones a los que se dieron mensajes escritos se les simboliza por siete estrellas en la mano derecha de Cristo. (Rev 1:16,?20; 2:1; 3:1.) El “ángel del abismo”, llamado Abadón, también está representado por una estrella.

Tienes que orar, pero no un sólo día, todos los días, tienes que rechazar ese mal y para expulsarlo tienes que poner toda tu fe en Dios, confiar que El es el Redentor, pero tienes que creer de verdad. Cuando una persona es de Dios, el demonio no tiene cabida, el demonio le teme a la fe. La fe tiene mucho poder, pero no hay mal que se resista ante Dios que es due?o del todo el poder, El es el Todopoderoso. Todo lo que pidas en oración tienes que hacer el nombre del Se?or Jesús. El es La Luz, y ningún espíritu de tinieblas puede resistir a Su luz.<br>  Ni se te ocurra buscar ningún brujo para contrarrestar otra brujería, porque el mal se alimenta aún más, ya que nuestra fe debe estar depositada en Nuestro Se?or, El único Dios y no en hechizerías y brujerías.|`|12t4d3kfaa	No esta relacionado kn causas sobrenaturales, tu cerebro tambien necesita alimentacion prueba capsulas de acido glutamico,son muy buenas, duerme a tus horas y no te desveles, has deporte eso oxigena la mente tambien. y sobre todo estudia.<br>  <br>  No te sugestiones veo k no es causa de trabajo *****.|`|MAM4CGVkaa	La brujeria no sale con otra brujería.<br>  Solo sale aferrándose a Dios con todas las fuerzas, es decir con la armadura de Dios, es decir, guardando sus mandamientos, y estar en comunión constante con El.<br>  Apartandose de los vicios y de la prostitución.<br>  Dios te bendiga y te proteja.|`|gIgAeK19aa	El unico que puede deshacer toda maldad es Jesucristo, pidele a el que te ayude por medio de una oracion, pidele que rompa toda atadura que hayan puesto sobre ti.<br>  Dios te bendiga!!!|`|EcPejP6Eaa	Tienes que ir con el Dr. House definitívamente para que te rega?e y dejes de pensar estupideces, tu problema lo resuelve la ciencia, nó la brujería.|`|iz7ukt52aa	esas cosas son puras tonterias ve al medico talbes tengas algo|`|Lri0FKV4aa	santiago 4:7 dice:Sujétense, por lo tanto, a Dios; pero opónganse al Diablo, y él huirá de ustedes<br>  que tan fuerte es tu relacion con dios?<br>  si te esfuersas por que tu relacion con dios sea fuerte<br>  y te sujetas a el no te podran acer da?o|`|0WGE5SnGaa	QUIZAS TE ESTAS  SUGESTIONANDO CON ESO DE QUE ALGUIEN TE ESTA EMBRUJANDO,Y TU PROBLEMA PUEDE SER ALGO SERIO DE SALUD, ANTES DE PENSAR EN COMO DESHACER HECHIZOS,MEJOR HAZTE UN CHEQUEO MEDICO, UNOS EXMENES O VISITA TU MEDICO Y EXPLICALE LO QUE TE ESTA PASANDO, PUEDE SER ALGO SENCILLO Y ANTES DE QUE SE AGRAVE, PON ATENCION A TU CUERPO YA QUE EL CUANDO NECESITA ALGO  LO PIDE DE ESA FORMA.<br>  TE ACONSEJO QUE SI TE HACE SENTIR MEJOR REZAR LO HAGAS, Y ORES Y PIDAS A DIOS QUE TE AYUDE A SALIR ADELANTE<br>  PORQUE NO HAY NADA MAS PODEROSO QUE LA ORACION A DIOS.<br>  DIOS TODO LO PUEDO,<br>  SUERTE.|`|BCnbzEf7aa	más que brujeria, puede ser ANEMIA... y eso no se cura con magia ni con oraciones.<br>  <br>  Visita a un nutriologo... cuidado, la anorexia y la bulimia son MORTALES.|`|xuHp3YXPaa	pues....trata de orar....^^<br>  <br>  se debe sentir feooo estar en tu situacion!:S<br>  <br>  suerte!|`|YbueSkO3aa	Dios creo hasta lo que no conocemos todavía.

nombre griego que deriba de zeuz asi como dios que es zeus, lo pueden buscar en internet en libros donde quieran. en primera ir a una iglesia no te da salvacion, las religiones que se han formado son hechas por el hombre. como pueden decir que jesus salva, si ni si quiera saben el significado del hombre, y no se basen tanto de una biblia que la mayor parte ah sido mal traducida y los nombres han sido cambiado a nombres paganos como dios jesus cristo o jesucristo. si eres cristiano o catolico o mormon o testigo de jehova no te debes molestar alcontrario abre bien los ojos que en la palabra hay luz no obscuridad.<br>  <br>  en primera si crees en mashiaj no quiere decir que ya tengas salvacion pues en primera el no vino a salavar a todos, el vino por su pueblo, que son parte de las 12 tribus, pero como sabran se dispersaron.<br>  <br>  en primera el nombre del hijo del eterno es Yahshua. por que?<br>   el nombre del eterno es yahwéh, no lo busquen en sus biblias pues no esta el mas cercano es yahveh que lo pueden encontrar en la biblia jerusalen pues de todas las biblias es la mejor en traduccion entre las peores. y si la bajan en ingles podran ver que el nombre del eterno es yahweh. ya que la wav o vav como se conoce en hebreo hace funcion de v o w pero en el nombre de mi padre es yahweh. el nombre viene de una conjugacion del verbo hayah, pero bueno.<br>  <br>  yah= yahweh shua= salvacion junto es yahshua que es yahweh salva.<br>  <br>  luego ya que saben el nombre del mashiaj y el eterno, invocando el nombre no ganan salvacion, pues para ello tiene que vivir la torah como lo hacia yahshua el mashiaj. <br>  <br>  no pueden ganar salvacion si eres un pecador, pues no seria justo para los que viven como manda en su palabra el eterno que los que no le sean fiel y vivan su torah tenga salvacion mas facil, pues si fuera asi pues muchos no cumplirian.<br>  <br>  no deben tomar al hijo del eterno como un d*os ni como si el y el eterno fuera uno,<br>  <br>  si lo dicen por que en la palabra da entender q son uno jeje q mala onda que no sepan indetificar, pues uno cuando obra con la palabra el eterno nos manda su ruaj haqodesh (viendo apartado) no santo pues es una mala interpretacion a demas que es una palabra griega.y menos espiritu santo, yahshua no puede ser mas que el eterno pues quien de nostros es mas que su papa. nadie puede ser mas que su autoridad.<br>  <br>  yahshua solo fue un mensaje que el eterno mando para que el pueblo dispersado regresara. ya que yahshua era judio y no romano pues al mashiaj lo han romanisado vean las imagenes que tiene lo visten como romano que burla para el mashiaj bien lo dice en la palabra que es el rey de los judios mas bien es el rey de yisrael pues a el le toca la eredad por parte de el rey david.<br>  <br>  se preguntaran como es que nosotros obtenemos salvacion. hay tres cosas importantes.<br>  <br>  primera: ya creemos en el eterno ahora ya sabemos su nombre. si vamos a mencionar su nombre tenemos que vivir como dice la torah o biblia asi es mas facil de indentificar. pues no podemos mencionar su nombre qadosh. pues uno no puede vivir pidiendo cosas si no cumple, ha habido una mala cultura por tratar el antiguo testamento cmo ya algo pasado muy mal pues ahi esta todas las bendiciones pues ya creyendo en el eterno y diciendole padre crenti y bendigo tu qadosh nombre como se diria en hebreo baruj hashem baruj= bendito ha=su shem=nombre. bueno en la palabra encontraran que la bendicion y el pacto empieza con abraham yitzaac y yacob, bueno pues como podemos pasar a ser parte del pueblo y decir que nuestros padres fueron abraham para q podamos tener acceso a la heredad que le prometieron a abraham yitzaac y yacob,  bueno ahora sabes que eran 12 tribus pero no estan las 12 en yisrael se dispersaron y a judios en todo el mundo yahudi = judio, bueno si pueden bajen informacion hacer de los sefarditas, pues ahi van aver que eran judios incluso cristobal colon era judio y todos los que vinieron con, bueno ahi encontrar apellidos los cuales los judios losc cambiaron para que no los mataran pues los que estaban junto con cristobal colom fueron sacado. espa?o se le conoce en yisrael como sefarad. bueno lean esa informacion a lo mejor y son de desendencia judia. bueno como formar parte si no son judios o mejor dicho no nacieron en yisrael.<br>  <br>  cuando yahshua el mashiaj dio la vida fue por hacer expiacion por todo el mundo por que todo el mundo pues el pueblo del eterno esta en todo el mundo regado. si han leido recordaran que le pueblo para hacer expiacion de los pecados sacrificaban un cordero y derramaban la sangre sobre el arca ahora si se imaginan ya saben dond esta el arca debajo donde fue matado el mashiaj, por q no dije crucificar pues en realidad no era una cruz era un madero.<br>  <br>  segunda: ya sabes que el mashiaj era el hijo del eterno el que fue enviado pra la redencion del pueblo. <br>  <br>  mashiaj viene de mashaj que es untar con aceite y mashiaj es unjido todo esto es hebreo.<br>  <br>  el mashiaj fue enviado para que la torah se cumpliera como lo dicen en matiyahu (mateo) yo no vine a cambiar la palabra solo vine a hacer que se cumpla.<br>  <br>  por que hacer que se cumpla por que nadie la lleva como debe de ser.<br>  <br>  tercer: como pasamos a hacer parte del pueblo de yisrael, recuerden que yahshua fue llamado yashua de nazaret.<br>  <br>  la palabra nazaret en hebreo es netzerret que quiere decir  peque?o olivo por que peque?o olivo recuerden que en la palabra habla de dos olivos el narutal y el silvestre el natural era todo los que era de yisrael y vivian la torah y el silvestre era los goyim los ignorantes.<br>  <br>  quedaria asi yahshua el peuqe?o olivo, por que asi pues cuando creemos e yahshua pasams hacer parte de el, por que? por que yahshua como es parte del olivo natural al creer en el somo puesto con el para ser injertados en el olivo natural y ya no ser mas goyines o gentiles.<br>  <br>  ahora ya siendo parte del pueblo de yisrael pues ya tenemos acceso al pacto que tuvo el eterno con nuestros padre abraham yitzaac y yacob, para que tegamos heredad de la tierra de yisrael, es por eso que el eterno cego a los judios en no creen en yashua pues ellos creen el mashiaj y estan en la espera, por que los cego pues como dije el pueblo esta esparcido por todo el mundo y no solo el pueblo exparcido si no para que nosotros que no crecimos ahi tuvieramos parte de la heredad de nuestros padres.<br>  <br>  y bueno con eso espero que les quede mas claro si hay alguien q no le parese es por que no le trae bendicion el eterno y claro no le va bien pues no es firme con el eterno y no vive su palabra. y respondiendo a la pregunta de este tema<br>  <br>  ninguna religion salva pues es mentira que solo esa religion se salva cual fuese que sea, ni el pastor, ni el ministro ni el rabi ni el sacerdote ni el papa les salva. las religion es como la politica solo q con otro nombre. comparelon y veran.<br>  <br>  yo fui catolico, tambien cristiano y mesianico y le doy todah rabah al eterno que me saco de ahi y he hizo q pasara hacer parte de su pueblo. con orgullo digo que soy de pueblo de yisrael y que tengo un eloah de elohim<br>  <br>  para cualquier cosa contacteme a serviciopc.com@hotma...<br>  <br>  shalom ubrajot que esto sea luz para sus ojos y no

cuenta..salu2|`|544872447274c5c6b945b24f05ad3a88aa	No, lo único necesario es que le entregues tu vida al Se?or Jesús. El es la puerta, El es camino a la salvación. Pero para llegar allí hay que andar como El anduvo.<br>  Es muy fácil perderse en este mundo aunque uno crea en Dios. Es más fácil permanecer en la fe si uno pertenece a una congregación, porque todos necesitamos de una guía, necesitamos alimentar la fe. Para acercarse a Dios es necesario despojarnos de las cosas del mundo, y en una iglesia o templo, no importa la denominación, se encuentra un espacio adecuado para lograr ese desprendimiento y perfeccionarnos en  la fe.<br>  Pero ojo, también las iglesias y los templos están llenos de personas que se dicen creyentes pero no tienen fe, sólo en apariencia. Lo que hacen es seguir un ritual, adoptan una religión, como quién se inscribe en un club deportivo, tan sólo para pertenecer, y lo que hacen lo hacen por costumbre, como rutina, y no tienen convicción ni están dispuestos a entregar sus vidas al Se?or.<br>  El camino a la salvación es personal, cada uno debe hacerse cargo de su salvación, poner en práctica La Ense?anza que se recibe de La Palabra y no sólo dejarse llevar por lo que dicen los ministros, pastores o curas para agradar a los hombres, para los ojos de los hombres. Al único que hay que agradar es a Dios.|`|gIgAeK19aa	Mira la religion NO SALVA, Jesucristo es el unico que puede salvarte, ya esta todo echo por el solo esta en que reconozcas que eres pecador y que Jesucristo vino al mundo a derramar su sangre por ti para que puedas alcanzar salvacion.<br>  Dios te bendiga!!!!!!!!!|`|3j6Qw5ySaa	uff con esa pregunta me hice ateo jaja xDasíi te la pongo los cristianos dicen acepta a cristo como tu salvador y seras salvado pero ellos dicen que la mitad de todos los que creen seran salvados osea pocos tienen esperanza y luego no tiene sentido un ateo bueno y un cristiano que fue asesino (asesino me refiero a que era asesino y despues se hizo cristiano) y solo aceptar a cristo como su salvador tiene mas pocibilidades de ir todo esto no tiene sentido si real mente existe algo así que no creo ira al cielo quien se lo meresca no quien acepte a alguien como su salvador<br>  <br>  PD todas las demas religiones están perdidas según los cristianos y según las otras las demáss tm están  perdidas quien es el buen aquí pues? xD|`|MQQfkDp6aa	?

C5BKumyOaa	Pues no voy a ser lindo, quieres una respuesta honesta y te la daré. Puede ser cualquier razón, quizás ya tenga alguien más, a l mejor ya está cansado y no rinde mucho, quizá su vida sexual se ha vuelto monótona, o quizá el piensa que esa frecuencia de sexo ahora es la adecuada. La cosa es que si a ti te afecta eso, pues debes de platicárselo porque quizá el piense que tú estás bien así y por eso no intente más. Debes de estar consiente que la repuesta que escuches puede que no te guste. Yo en lo personal prefiero la honestidad, así que tu decides si tomas este consejo o simplemente dejas pasarlo y continuas con tu vida sexual que tampoco es mala, hay más cosas que el sexo en una relación. Saludos|`|1fs74nzjaa	a ver rey antes de que te empieses a hacer el amor tu solo, a lo mejor esta depre, con muchas presiones, ahora tambien le puedes preguntar directamente.|`|544872447274c5c6b945b24f05ad3a88aa	Acerca de la frecuencia no hay nada establecido, depende de cada pareja cuánto es mucho y cuánto es poco, y depende de cada persona. Lo esperable es que pareja en la etapa del enamoramiento tenga una actividad más asidua y eso con el tiempo vaya menguando, eso para la mayoría. A lo mejor en esta etapa para tu pareja 1 vez cada 15 días esté bien. El tema es tu inquietud, que no estás conforme con esto. Muchas veces la falta de deseo no significa que el otro no motive más a la pareja sino que los motivos son externos a ella, éstos pueden ser tener muchas ocupaciones, horarios desencontrados, el exceso de trabajo, de responsabilidad, o también los primeros a?os de crianza de los ni?os suelen demandar mucha energía y después no hay tiempo material para la intimidad.<br>  También es posible que hayan caído en una rutina, un enfriamiento, pero que no tiene que ver con el desinterés por el otro sino por una baja en la libido, es decir el foco de la relación pasa por otro lado y no por lo sexual.<br>  Pueden ser muchas cosas,  pero cada pareja es un mundo, así que lo primordial es la comunicación, tenés que plantear, preguntar qué pasa, pero no de una forma negativa o en forma de reproche sino abordarlo en forma amorosa, preguntarle cómo se siente, qué cosas le están pasando, si está contenta con su vida en general. Otra manera es volver a la conquista, empezar a tratar al otro de una forma distinta, tener una atención, agazajarla con algo, demostrar el cari?o, el afecto de una manera no sexual. <br>  Muchas veces las mujeres son sentimos desvalorizadas, qué el varón no nos presta atención, que no mira para nuestras necesidades y que sólo nos requiere para lo sexual. Necesitamos de la demostración del afecto separada de lo sexual, buscamos la intimidad desde lo emocional y no desde lo físico.

Perdí la memoria por más de 1 mes, además era usuário de drogas y muy violento. <br>   Supe que fué Cristo que me curó, porque cuando yo estaba en el hospital entre la vida y la muerte, entraron unos hombres de Dios, y me preguntaron que si yo aceptaba una oracion " Jesús te ama y te cura y dá nueva vida" .

MtrUdu2Paa	Bloody Mary as in the Queen of England Mary Tudor? She was Henry VIII first daughter, born by his first wife, Spanish princess Catherine of Aragon (not the LOTR character :) ). Mary was catholic, just as her mother and as she was Queen, she tried to re-establish the catholic faith in England. She married, but had no children, so after she died, her younger sister, Elisabeth, became Queen, reigning for 45 years. Mary Tudor got the nickname BLOODY, because during her reign many protestant believers were killed for not wanting to give up their faith.|`|Y6odIQgJaa	It's neither.<br>  <br>  The story of bloody mary is historical.|`|k4iehRa8aa	Its a story.|`|ZvUsEZKmaa	well the name bloody mary is derived from Mary queen of england (and ireland) from 1553-1558. she was called bloody mary for burning over 300 religious dissenters at the stake in the marian persecutions. she was also known for having many miscarriages and false pregnancies.  however in folklore, bloody mary is a ghost the appears in the mirror after you chant her name a certain amount of time (the amount of times differ and there are sometimes other things you must do in order to summon her ghost to the mirror). People often think that you must mention killing one of her children in order to get her to appear (she was said to have murdered her children or had her child stolen and committed suicide because of the grief it caused her). some others say that when she appears you can speak with her about your future. hope this helps.
AA11928403	I really don't know what your meaning of  feather blow.  But I can translate for you literally in Japanese.    Feather = hane (pronounced hah neh)  blow = dageki(noun/hit hard)  blow = fuku(verb/toot), fuki(noun/toot)    So you can say  1) Hane no yoo na dageki. (hit like a feather)  2) Hane no fuki, or Hane o fuku. (blow of a feather, or blow a feather).
eucb1hTKaa	There is a page in the beginning that tells all. The secret societies in the novel are real or are believed to be real. The Priory of Sion is a name given to groups that are both real and fictitious. Opus Dei on the other hand is a completely real Catholic group (Dan Brown makes them sound creepy in the book, though; I have no idea what they are like). The descriptions of all the painting in the book are fairly accurate, but as for the coincidences, you have to believe in conspiracy theories to believe in those. Who knows? What Dan Brown and many other authors said could be true, or maybe not.   I hope you enjoy the book. I have to say, it's one of my absolute favorite reads. Don't forget to read "Angels and Demons", also by Dan Brown! It's the first book with Robert Langdon and it as well is phenomenal!! "Angels and Demons" is being made into a movie which is coming out this year.   Happy to help, doowah78|`|qjvAquFnaa	It is fiction, it even says that in the beginning of the book.

However, a lot of what is stated there, like many works of fiction, is based on factual references.    There is a hidden meaning to nearly all of Da Vinci's works, some of them are stretched a little in Brown's book.    There was a Lady Magdelene, and there is a lot of argument around her role in the life of Jesus.    The "Book" has been in the hands of MAN, not God, for over 3000 years and it's impossible to believe that man, in all his greed and selfishness, allowed it to go unedited to suit his needs.    This is why the Christian community is so up in arms over The Da Vinci Code, because they realize that at the root, it questions a lot of concepts fundamental to their belief, and that scares the crap out of them. As they should be.|`|4S5NnT7aaa	No.  It's largely based on a book called 'The Holy Blood and the Holy Grail' which came out in the 1970s.  You may remember that the guys who wrote it tried to sue Dan Brown when the movie came out - and lost.    It was a load of nonsense which you can research for yourself, but most of it was a hoax by a couple of French con-men.   Some of it is false, but most of the rest is just manipulated evidence and historical co-incidence.|`|4TX26viFaa	No, he cribbed from an older book (there was a big legal thing about that in the news).

NwXnzARwaa	The same laws and procedures that govern opposite-sexl marriage also apply to same-sex marriages. There are no special procedures for a same-sex marriage.    All persons who wish to be married in Massachusetts must have a marriage license issued within the Commonwealth of Massachusetts. Out-of -State marriage licenses cannot be used in Massachusetts.    The couple must apply in person for a marriage intention application. This requirement applies to both residents and non-residents.    There is a (3) three day waiting period to receive your license. License is valid for (60) sixty days from the day you originally file and may be used in any city or town within the Commonwealth. This license cannot be used outside of this state. A waiver of the (3) three day waiting period can be applied for at the city or town clerk's office where you apply and then presented to a court of competent jurisdiction for approval.    Any person filing in Massachusetts who has been married and is divorced does not have to file divorce papers, but that individual's divorce must be FINAL at the time of the application date.    Federal Statutes requires the collection of Social Security numbers (SSNs) at the time of application.    When either person is under (18) eighteen years old, a court order must be obtained from the probate court or district court where the minor resides. The parent must accompany the under age person along with the eligible person to the court prior to filing for the license. In Boston, proof of age is required if under the age of (24) twenty-four. For proof of age, a certified birth record or passport is required.    A Priest, Minister, Rabbi or a Justice of the Peace may perform the ceremony. A Justice of the Peace does not require witnesses to the ceremony but some religions may require witnesses so you should contact such person before the ceremony so that requirement can be met.    The person who performs the ceremony of marriage must sign the license and return it to the city or town where it was issued. That is the only place where the license will be registered.    Out of State clergy may perform the ceremony here provide that an authorization has been obtained from the Secretary of States Office prior to the ceremony. The marriage license will not be registered unless the required authorization is enclosed with the license.
FmazIF6Maa	There are no specific Gods and Goddesses of Wicca.    Wiccans often see the Higher Power as something so beyond our comprehension (The One, or The All). They relate to the Divine through it's masculine and feminine energies.    These energies are embodied by the Gods and Goddesses of most Pagan religions. There aer Wiccans who honor the Goddess in the form of Brigid, and some in the form of Freya, and some in the form of Hecate.       Some Wiccans prefer not to place confining names and images on their deities, so they just call them Goddess and God. It is common to associate the Goddess with a Moon Goddess or Mother Earth, and God with Sun or Sky Gods.|`|5lbKGofgaa	Which ones, Celtic, Egyptian, Norse, Japanese, Chinese, Hindu, etc etc etc.  There are a lot out there.

QIQNzE11aa	A suit is not out of the question for any position in the Ritz. I worked at a Ritz for a few years in reservations in the back ground. It doesn't have to be a complete suit. Nice dress pants, nice blouse and a nice dress jacket over that. Very small heels, nothing too high.     Ritz is about looks and they like all employees to look the part. Even house keeping. To look as if you can fit in with the type of staff they run. House keeping has to deliver items to rooms at times, therefore you will be seen.     Make sure you smile, not overly smiling, but smile. Look friendly. Make sure your hair is nice and not too much make up.     Best of luck!|`|rThIVk2maa	Wear a nice top, clean nice shoes and slacks.

urIm4YaBaa	It's a satire.     Several years ago, the Kansas school board made an order that schools would have to balance time between teaching evolution and creationism. Bobby Henderson wrote them an open letter, stating that he supported this, and he demanded that his religion, centered around the Flying Spaghetti Monster, should also have equal time. His point was that, if one religion is to be given equal time, then all religions must have the same treatment.    Somehow, the FSM took off on the Internet. It is now used as a parody for many odd religious stances, such as the inability to disprove the FSM's existence as proof that he must exist, using the theory that he pushes people to the earth against the scientific theory of gravity (gravity is "only a theory," after all), and several others. The point is usually to illuminate some bad thought patterns present in many presentations of religion while having a bit of fun with the Pastafarian culture that it has spawned.|`|XAlCd8Ebaa	Serious in that it was designed to point out the unreasonable assertion that something which has no evidence should nonetheless be believed.

6s6wGCzxaa	He that is without sin cast the first stone.  Jesus' words on adultry.  But the woman was commanded to go and sin no more.      Cover them all...  Read Genesis 9 the story of Noah's nakedness     This is one of my favorite passages of scripture and if I can just elaborate a bit, here was Noah the only man who found grace in Gods eyes. (Thats beautiful well come back to that) He was CHOSEN to orchestrate the repopulation of the world after having wiped it out because of its deplorable state. In short he had Gods trust, he was called.  And here he is naked (represents shame and embarrassment) within his tent (this can represent a house, a temple, or a sanctuary) and he was drunk now he wasnt drunk in the spirit as here it seems to be the negative form of drunk (intoxicated, in sin).  ....  But what happens next always gets me his son comes in, sees him and runs out to tell the other two.  Hey man dads drunk in there and hes nakedit sounds a little like gossip; he was out to reveal his fathers sinful state (And thats his son, hes family). Sometimes its those closest to us the ones that know us best, the ones we trust.  Now the bible doesnt elaborate on it but we can see here that there was something wrong with Hams thinking or maybe his heart, maybe both, but there definitely was an issue there.  ....  Noah wasnt perfect, he wasnt chosen because he was perfect, the bible says he found Grace in Gods eyes, and as we know where sin abounds grace much more abounds. 1 Peter 4:8 reads above all things be earnest in your love among yourselves, for love COVERS a multitude of sins.  (Wow God is so great!)....  Which leads me to the next point, I love what happens next, because it serves as the example. After hearing of their fathers state the other two come in backwards as not to look upon their father in the state that he was in and they covered him.  Such a simple act that speaks volumes on love, they covered him.  They cover his shame and dont speak ill about it, there is understanding in this act, unconditional love.  As we see from here on Ham is cursed and the other two blessed.  Hams state caused his curse.....  How many of us come to the Lord with an issue a lot of us try to handle it ourselves afraid to be uncovered, even exposed.  We all should strive to be like Shem and Japheth a protecting force that covers each other and gives way for us to walk out our salvation,  to become a channel for healing to take place. ....    It seems to me the men in your congregation should be stronger, point out to this man what he's doing wrong (IN LOVE).  This may be this man's mindset a stronghold that needs to be broken and he may need his friends more than ever.  I suggest caution this is slippery ground but we need to learn to deal with eachother in love|`|zq8s9gtwaa	Shun Them|`|Op81lhjuaa	What does the Bible say about church discipline / excommunication?  Answer: Excommunication is the formal removal of an individual from church membership rolls and the informal separation of company from that individual. Matthew 18:15-20 gives the procedure and authority for a church to do this. It instructs us that one individual (usually the offended party) is to go to the offending individual. If he/she does not repent, then two or three go to confirm the situation and the refusal to repent. If there is still no repentance, it is taken before the church. This process is never "desirable," just as a parent never delights in having to discipline his/her children. Often, though, it is necessary. The purpose is not to be mean-spirited or to display a "holier than thou" attitude. Rather, it is to be done in love toward the individual, in obedience and honor to God, and in godly fear for the sake of others in the church.    The Bible gives an example of the necessity of excommunication in a local church, the church at the city of Corinth (1 Corinthians 5:1-13). In this passage, the apostle Paul also gives some purposes behind the biblical use of excommunication. One reason (not directly found in the passage) is for the sake of the testimony of Christ Jesus (and His church) before the unbelievers. When David had sinned with Bathsheba, one of the consequences of his sin that God mentions is that the name of the one true God will be blasphemed by God's enemies (2 Samuel 12:14). A second reason is that sin is like a cancer; if allowed to exist, it spreads to those nearby just as a little yeast leavens a whole loaf of bread (1 Corinthians 5:6-7). Also, Paul explains that Jesus saved us so that we might be set apart from sin, that we might be "unleavened" or free from that which decays spiritually (1 Corinthians 5:7-8). Christ's desire for His bride, the Church, is that she might be pure and undefiled (Ephesians 5:25-27). Excommunication is also for the long-term welfare of the one being disciplined by the church. Paul, in 1 Corinthians 5:5, states that excommunication is a way of delivering "such a one to Satan for the destruction of the flesh, that his spirit may be saved in the day of the Lord Jesus." This means that excommunication can somehow involve God using Satan (or one of his demons) as a disciplinary tool to work in the sinner's life physically to bring about true repentance in his/her heart.    Sometimes the disciplinary action of the church is successful in bringing about godly sorrow and true repentance. When this occurs, the individual is able to be restored to fellowship. The individual involved in the 1 Corinthians 5 passage repented, and Paul encouraged the church to restore him to fellowship with the church (2 Corinthians 2:5-8). Unfortunately, the disciplinary action, even when done in love and in the correct manner, is not always successful in bringing about such restoration, but is still needed to accomplish the other good purposes mentioned above.    We have all likely witnessed the behavior of a child who has been allowed to do as he/she pleases with no or very little consistent discipline. It is not a pretty sight! Nor is such parenting loving for it dooms the child to a dismal future. Such behavior will keep the child from forming meaningful relationships and performing well in any kind of a setting, whether socially or in an occupation. In a like manner, discipline in the church setting, while neither enjoyable nor easy, is not only necessary, but loving as well. Moreover, it is commanded by God.

ATPPWOpWaa	Your question doesnt include seeking the One true God.  Do not seek out a belief system simply for the sake of belonging and filling some need.  Fill your life with the true God whos Son is Jesus Christ.  To follow Jesus is a life without fear and a sense of contentment and belonging.  The thoughts and doubts that you are experiencing are common.  To jump start your relationship with God become active in your church or find a good Bible based church.    Become involved in your church and its daily workings.  Help with ushering.  Help with pot luck meals.  Help with clean up day.  You will fill your life with Christian friends, thoughts and deeds.  In doing this you will push out the deeds of the flesh and its lustful self serving desires.  Remember, our every thought should concern our God and others and not gratifying the lusts of the flesh.   You will feel as though you belong to one another and depend and care for one another.  You will feel loved and you will seek to prosper others ahead of your own concerns.      Today, society tells us that would should aspire to become the full pattern of pop culture.  To attain beauty, wealth and status.  To put on a show of  '"look at me and how I have it all together".   But the way of God is to seek Him with all of your might and to do His work in caring of the less fortunate than ourselves.  Dont give up.|`|AA10873763	Same thing that happened before you were born.

I got pregnant as a teen and considered abortion because it was so early and the process of bringing a child into the world and then giving it up for adoption would destroy me. However, generally I am opposed to abortion, because it destroys a spirit and the foetus feels pain. You are experience the hypocrisy and irony of being human.

The result is that a few years ago, this small town's high school was on the top 10 list of US high schools in terms of percentage of the student body that was pregnant. I'm not kidding.    "Just say no" doesn't work against the strong sexual urges that God gave us. We need to teach young adults how to use their sexuality in a way that won't make a mess out of their lives.|`|283tO9j9aa	I think Beedi has the right idea. Comprehensive sex ed is fantastic, however that includes telling kids that having sex is a choice, not something they're expected to do or not do. The relationship side of things is often neglected, so even though kids know the biology they don't know what to do if someone tries to push them into something they're not ready for. If you know what a condom is but you don't know where to get one or how to put one on it's no good, if you know you're not ready but you don't know how to tell someone that it's no good.    I think there is a feeling amongst some religious people that educating teenagers is going to make them more likely to have sex, however, I know from personal experience that it is not the case. I was brought up atheist and educated myself about sex with a little help from my open-minded mum- I lost my virginity aged 19, in a committed relationship, and have never had sex without protection. So knowing your stuff and not having 'Christian' morals doesn't make you start sleeping around without protection at 15 and aborting all those fetuses you get from doing it. I would like to think that examples of people like me would be proof that sex ed isn't as damaging as some people think, however there are those who have it stuck in their heads that pretty much everything is immoral and nothing can change that.|`|212F2EO0aa	I am opposed to teaching immoral behavior is OK.

Religious people think it is more the parents responsibility to teach about that sort of thing. There is also the problem with pictures. Parents might feel it isn't good to expose kids to those things until marriage, even if they are just illustrations. True, sex-ed does teach safe sex, but the parents are probably telling themselves that the kid won't have sex till marriage, which sadly isnt always the case. It's not that they want something to complain about, they are not bad people, only people who are trying to protect their children in the way they think is best.|`|jHyzIHmCaa	Christian beliefs do not increase the number of abortions in society, that is a choice made by whoever decides to terminate.  Bible beliefs are that a man and women shouldn't lie together unless they are married.  Now another thing back in that time too they could get married much much faster than today so i do understand that need and want for sexual relationship.  However back to the abortion issue  there is one instance where i believe that an early abortion is ok, and that is when the mothers life is in danger.  In rape cases the child should be given up for adoption and all other cases theres an old  saying that goes  "you make your bed,  lie in it"|`|g7bQ9zSvaa	I don't think religious people are opposed to sex-ed as such.  In a class, some students will have sex, and others will wait. The problem with much of sex-ed is that it doesn't include "relationship-ed".  A lot of the time, students are only told about contraception but not about being empowered to say no, or even being presented with the option of waiting - it is taught from the standpoint of an assumption of sexual activity.  As such, they may venture into sexual behaviour earlier (children have much more information now than they did before, yet they are having sex earlier, and teenage pregnancy and STIs are on the increase, not decreasing, with knowledge).  I therefore think that sex-ed needs to be more complete, not only about abstinence, but not only about use of contraception.  The emotional aspects of sex should be addressed too, and people should be taught of all their options, including the option to wait.|`|fOfJz9OMaa	It is a matter of sin.  The solution to protect sin, so that people can continue in sin with supposively no consequence, is in itself sin; it is proceeding from sin to sin, and this is not a solution for sin.  The only solution under the sun for sin is to repent.  For this secular world to attempt to be understanding and accepting to sin, it only makes sin increase and intensify.  As for your history, its a little off.
VpTxqL2Aaa	I can understand where you are coming from with the strict parents and all and being raised to believe that homosexuality is wrong, my parents tried that with me but in the end i made up my mind that love doesn't limit itself to gender or race or even age.      If you have never thought about girls that way then of course you are not bi or les. If some girls still think you are you can either choose to ignore it or you can have a bf and let it be know you have one. Don't do anything drastic such as deliberately getting pregnant so they wont think you are les.     No you don't HAVE to experiment. Experimenting would only make people more "convinced" that you are les and it could confuse you.  If you do CHOOSE to experiment there is nothing wrong with it. It is normal for people, girls in particular, to experiment in college to find out who they really are.     Be yourself. You cant get caught up in all the drama about what people think of you. People are going to make snide remarks and start rumors, its what they do. If you worried about what every person thinks and says about you, you wouldn't have any room left in your brain to worry about what really matters.     Be proud of the fact that you aren't a slutty girl who goes and gets knocked up all the time and sleeps with a new man every night. You have standards and that not a bad thing.    Hope this helps.|`|Tbhi8Sugaa	yeah some people at my school think im lez just cause i dont tell the whole world who i like. i hate it. it's so annoying! so judemental.|`|AA11589320	Its simple.   In the scheme of life, the girls at school will occupy a very small part of your over all life.   What ever they think of you has a total value of ZERO.     For me. With in 12 months of leaving school I was no longer in contact with anyone beyond the 3 guys who were close friends. The rest were never seen again or now and then by a chance encounters on public transport.      I say, let them talk. It don't matter as they don't matter in your life.     You also mention:  Should you have a same sex experience, is this normal?     Its simple.  Gays and bisexuals have sexual experiences of the same sex.     If you are not gay or bisexual your heterosexual.  Therefor why would you be after a same sex experience.  Don't do things just because others do them, don't be a sheep, only do what is right for you.      I don't know your parents, but from what you have written they appear to have their heads screwed on right.  If you must listen to anyone, listen to the people who have been in your life from day one, and they will be there for you until death.  A parents love has not limits.     Thats not to say they wont make mistake, its saying they are worth the effort of working with as they will be there for you.|`|88DhgAXwaa	Dont experiment if you dont want to- you dont have to and they shouldnt pressure you. Also, if you do then you would be proving their gossip correct. Also, I know lots of girls that have never had a bf or dont have any guy friends and its perfectly normal. :]  Andddd, I know lots of people who have got called an elezbian when they are straight and have never done anything with the same sex before. Some people just call others that when they feel threatened by them, they just want to be nasty, or that they saw that you had no guy friends and judgemently thought that you were an elezbian. Dont listen to them, you are a guy magnet so forget about the stupid gossip.  Heres one example of what happened to someone I knew:  In secondary school, people called this girl an elezbian, she wasnt, never did anything to suggest she is, never did anything with the same gender and acted straight and people called her that for NO reason.  People are mean in life, forget them, ignore them, dont do things you dont want to do. Some people like to experiment, most dont. I havent, and all my friends havent. Some like to, some dont. You dont HAVE to.  Good Luck ^^  x|`|rmwivveRaa	yeh i know how that kind of people can make you feel..   look don't feel pressured into doing anything you don't want to do, chances are those girls are lesbians themselves. personally i wouldn't be too offended if someone called me a lesbian but you know... :)   i know plenty of straight girls that have never been out with a guy ever. don't let it bother you i'm sure you have more important things to think about

Parents would tell their kids it would cause blindness and all kinds of horrible things. Now we know better and realize it's normal and healthy (as long as you don't spend all your time doing it) so we basically reject fundamental religious thinking that says it is wrong.<br>  <br>  Like others have said, you're wasting your breath trying to convince them they're wrong. All you can do is avoid the subject with them and when you have your own children raise them to be more enlightened like you. If your parents bring it up just tell them you won't discuss it and leave the room.|`|56dfvnwmaa	do this, ask them how they can prove that the religion you're part of is right and how other religions are wrong. basically make them realize that religion is all a matter of faith and beliefs and not actual knowledge. if anything you should bring this question to the religion and spirituality section. trust me us atheists there will be able to help you more with the situation and with counter arguments against the existence of any god|`|PLtU5AuYaa	Well first off I hope you are doing the deed in private.

I do agree, you should NOT tell kids that they are unwanted or somehow a freak or bad because they have at somepoint in their life masturbated.

Some states do, some states don't.  But states can only decide how to spend FEDERAL funds if the federal government grants them the authority to do so.    For a little over thirty years, the federal government has prohibited them from using federal dollars in this way.    And yes, it is for purely religious reasons.|`|3959c9601f288bcc65fe36767a2df0c0aa	science chick said it better than I could.|`|3GAiVmEAaa	Taking care of a kids medical care is a LOT more expensive than the abortion, let alone their education and other services.

When you say to one patient "you can have your face lift" and to another "you cannot decide what to do with your body" it is an inherent inequality.|`|gbBJ2q1Qaa	An absurd idea.    1.  Economically speaking, if a mother can't afford an abortion, then she certainly can't afford a child.  Bringing a child she can't afford into the world would bring even more strain on the welfare system as a child has healthcare costs, food costs, and etc.  So, if you want to save your tax dollars, you should be voting to fund abortions.    2.  If you allow people to vote on funding something they do or don't agree with it, and don't want their tax dollars going towards it, then you create a very uncomfortable situation.  I could say, "I'm not funding chemotherapy for lung cancer patients because I believe most of them smoked their way into their situation - it's their own fault."  Or, "I'm not funding mending that guy's broken leg.  He got it while snowboarding.  That was his conscious choice, he knew the risks, that's his own fault."  And so on.|`|77b2610047fd4e5f740d75e96c9a88a2aa	State sponsored health programs are legislated by the state they are used in.  So what you are proposing already happens.

This is a different issue from legalizing abortion or vice versa.|`|AA11328507	So the states decide to not pay for abortions....what happens to all the unwanted children that are born?  What happens to all the desperate woman who refuse to carry a baby to term?

3hNlKkMMaa	Accents have absolutely nothing to do with ethnicity. They way you talk comes from the people around you. As a child you imitated the speech you heard, which was, apparently, a "white girl" accent.    edit: and if you really want to change your accent... then you can. You're just going to have to work really hard on imitating the accent you want.

It has to be from the heart.|`|CmHLKKODaa	I guess I am going to keep asking until I get an Answer !  = )|`|PPvk105Caa	Or, you can just get up & try to achieve what you are praying for & eventually you will reach your goal.|`|vdM9AJDtaa	i think you can pray all you like about whatever you want as many times as you want as long as you dont only pray when you want something..|`|ATPPWOpWaa	Perfect Faith says yes.

Then the prayer should be 'Thank you Lord, for...". If you want to add to the request, then feel free to.  God wants us to ask... But once we have received His answer, to continue in faith in it. Like Jesus told us we are going over to the other side when we got into the boat. As soon as the waves & storms come, we shouldn't ask Jesus to save us or we are going under.  Jesus already told us we are going over to the other side. Claim the victory, We are going over to the other side. The storms don't matter. Jesus already said it. I believe it and I claim it & I declare it. No matter what the circumstances. And remember to thank God we are going over to the other side. And when we are over on the other side, thank God again.    Delight yourself in the Lord & He shall give you the desires of your heart.|`|AA10747877	As long as you're praying according to the will of God, it's fine. Many people give up too easily because they have God on their time schedule.|`|rg4lS9E9aa	Even if our prayers seem to go unanswered, this does not mean that God did not hear them. The Bible assures us: "The eyes of Jehovah are upon the righteous ones, and his ears are toward their supplication." (1 Peter 3:12) So Jehovah God hears the prayers of righteous ones, whether they are spoken audibly or uttered in the heart. (Jeremiah 17:10) Jehovah also examines the thoughts and feelings behind each prayer, which even the one praying may neither fully understand nor be aware of.Romans 8:26, 27.    However, prayers must meet certain requirements if they are to be acceptable to God. First, they must be directed exclusively to Godnot to Jesus, to a "saint," or to an idol. (Exodus 20:4, 5) Prayers must also be offered in the name of God's Son, Jesus Christ. (John 14:6) Does this mean that our prayers are heard by Jesus first and that he relays the message to God? No. Rather, by praying to Jehovah in the name of Jesus, we identify ourselves as Christ's disciples and we acknowledge that it is only because of his ransom that we are able to approach God.Hebrews 4:14-16.    Prayers must be offered in faith. The apostle Paul pointed out: "Without faith it is impossible to please [God] well, for he that approaches God must believe that he is and that he becomes the rewarder of those earnestly seeking him." (Hebrews 11:6) How does a person know if he has that kind of faith? The Bible writer James answers: "I shall show you my faith by my works." (James 2:18) Yes, faith produces actions, and they, in turn, show that we love God and are trying to please him.    Worshipers of God must also be persistent when praying. Jesus made this clear at Luke 11:9, 10, quoted at the outset. After all, if a person prays just once about a matter, does this not indicate that he or she is not really serious about the request?|`|Z6TNsJluaa	How many times does it take for God to forgive you when you truly ask forgiveness?  Once...I believe Christians need to understand the principles of faith.. As we read the accounts of the disciples, before they were filled with the power of the Holy Spirit, Jesus rebuked them on many occasions saying, "Oh, you have little faith or where is your faith!" But after they had received the Baptism of power, It is said of those, They were full of faith and power!  So again, The Holy Spirit is here to teach us how to be Children of faith and power!|`|zFM5HeLjaa	Its fine. The more we pray about it, the quicker it will be answered|`|1Xh1SQmOaa	did not Jesus encourage persistence in prayer when He told the Store of the widow who persisted with the judge?    We can keep asking, because as we pray, we are releasing God's power on the earth to accomplish His will.  But sometimes we keep asking for what we know is not really for our best.    Devote it all to His will; depend on His power and trust in His love and timing.  Most of all, learn to worship Him for who He is, no matter what happens.|`|XbOQkZZyaa	Matthew 26:44 says that Jesus prayed for the same thing three times, so as long as we pray like He did ("nevertheless not as I will, but as thou wilt", Matt. 26:39) then I don't see why it wouldn't be all right.    God bless!|`|XLXncQu9aa	I think there are two answers to this question.  The first is that we are to always pray for what we desire.      1 Thessalonians 5:17 says " Pray without ceasing".      That means we are never to stop praying.  I think that as long as it is on our hearts to pray for whatever we desire we should until we see a change from the Lord. Also praying increases our faith and relationship with God, so prayer is always a good option.   But just because we continually pray it doesn't mean we have lost faith in God, it means that we are praying because we know he hears us.      The 2nd answer is that once we do pray, we are to then start doing something about what we desire.      James 2:26 says,"For as the body without the spirit is dead, so faith without works is dead also."     Basically once we pray we must not only believe but we must act on our faith and do what it is we must to gain what we desire.  Prayer alone is not enough.  It helps but it does not always change it just because we pray.  we must be willing to do our part if that is what God calls for.  Faith is pro-active which means it is constantly moving not stagnated.|`|11bc4cae873dd3e9feff6c81fac05c17aa	Pray until you receive.

9e71236ddd91a1ac14a12c704616491caa	No, I think my appreciation and love for human life is equivalent to the average Christian's.  I don't know how one measures that sort of thing, but I don't think I'm particularly more empathetic than any religious believer.    Again, no, I don't.  I think most Christians inherently realize that they don't know what will happen after death, and they value their life as much as anyone else.|`|bb06GQ5Paa	Wow, the same superiority complex we are accused of having.  Ironic.    Most of my Christian friends love and value this life and this world.

The fact that the brain has such a robust response to unfairness shows that sensing unfairness is a basic evolved capacity.     The emotional response to unfairness pushes people from extreme inequity and drives them to be fair. This observation shows our basic impulse to be fair isn't a complicated thing that we learn.    It therefore fully illustrates that all humans have morals controlled by the brain and that Christians are entirely wrong to try and claim morals as their own!!!!|`|AA11264399	Religious folks think our well-being in this life is irrelevant.

By keeping our hearts and minds focused on God, I am able to better understand true unconditional love. I am sure you love those around you. But to say that Christians appreciate less is way off. I couldn't love and appreciate my family, friends, and neighbors more than I do! Because of my faith I have a higher appreciation and love! I know that what I do here on earth affects my eternity and the eternity of those around me! If I don't live my life to the fullest that God has for me than I am neglecting the blessings that I have here on earth! I have a wonderful husband and three amazing children! How could I not be appreciative and in awe of these gifts!    I didn't say you couldn't love as much as I do if you aren't a Christian! I just expressed the fact that I love as much as anyone and that my faith is the reason for that. You have your own reason for your love. Mine is because I was loved first, by Him. By higher appreciation I was using higher in reference to God, not in measuring my love.|`|C22jeMVhaa	I love this life. It's the one I'm living.

Sure, I believe in God and whatever, but I think he realizes that heaven is about appreciating God's existence, and that Earth is about appreciating the existence of the people around you. In other words, I don't believe God really cares if you devote your entire life to him for the 80 or so years you'll be living.     I couldn't ask more from God than to be able to be with my family and friends. In fact, I thank God that I'm not a religious fanatic, who lives only for him.     There's a saying that goes something like: "You are born for the sake of happiness, but you live for sake of happiness in others." That's how I live my life, but there are some Christians who find happiness away from family and friends, who find happiness because they're about to die because they'd be going to heaven. Thank God himself for me not being one of those people.    Good for you.|`|283tO9j9aa	I think our appreciation and respect for this life is stronger, because this is all we have. I feel the need to quote my favourite doctor here, Dr Gregory House:    "I believe this life is not just a test"    I totally agree with that (and with you)- I think we're more likely to put a high value on this life and this planet because we think this is it and we don't get any more chances. Having said that, the nice religious people probably do something similar because they use their religion to help them be better people, so they look after the world and make the most of life too.    I think all of us that are decent people love those who are close to us, I don't think faith or lack of faith affects that unless someone has very extreme faith- the kind that would cause them to disown a family member for their sexuality or change in faith.|`|fc711dee0348a3fa4c47b0371bd359d5aa	I am not totally atheist, more of a pantheist.  I believe in a creative positive energy that isn't at all conscious.  I think I value life on this planet more than most christians because I am much more positive about it.  For instance Christians believe we are all sinners.  I believe that evil is illusion and that man is mostly good.  Christians believe in Satan.  I believe in only one positive universal energy.  Hell is not real in my books, only the good.  I have nothing to fear, nothing haunting me, nothing tempting me.  Your right, a loving god would not accept or desire worship.  He would be above that.  The need for attention and recognition is a human thing that springs from ego... which god would not have.|`|4df5b0d647b2a86951f70a45577d082faa	By all means yes|`|b8e3dd68b7fdbbbac6132e0c73015651aa	I think we better understand the incredible improbability of our existance, and therefore more fully appreciate that we, a product of the universe, have the ability to understand the nature of our existence.|`|u3Hc2d7Taa	I don't really agree.

He was supposed to have been a huge problem to the Romans and produced wonderful miracles but still not one contemporary record?    Even the bible mentions of him like all other references were not written until many years after his supposed death!!    Pilot is recorded in the Roman record as a somewhat lack luster man but no mention of a Jesus, a trial or crucifixion that would surely have been used to make him look brighter!!    At best he was an amalgam of those others!!      The Roman Emperor Constantine produced the bible and he was a pagan not god!!!   He also organized Christianity into the Holly Roman Catholic Church!!  Not in Israel or any of the countries of supposed origin but entirely Italian!!    Not one word of it is contemporary with the period and was not written until many years after the period the story is set in!!

ccccc3a7fff67561896e1cd6e04c515faa	That sounds really familiar... maybe from the Scary Stories to Tell in the Dark series? I'm sure I read it as a kid...    However, there does seem to be a theme in many horror stories of a monster or ghost gradually creeping up and actually making quite a show of it -- probably because the sense of threat and suspense makes the stories scarier. It could be I'm confusing it with another story -- I remember one story in a book of English horror stories, reported as happening in the first half of the 19th century, where a zombie/vampire with glowing green eyes kept coming up to a girl's window for several night before finally attacking; and an old story called "Tailypo" where a demonic animal kept trying to reach a man who'd eaten its tail, and kept getting closer and closer as he sent his dogs after it.|`|A2nKiMsuaa	I have just heard a scary story about a doll like that.

Back in the day, my late grandma had a boyfriend who really used to practice voodoo or "roots."  Anyhow, he was seen sprinkling dust around my grandma's mobile home before daylight one morning by my grandma's sister who lived about 100 feet away.  When my dad got the news, he confronted him about since he didn't like him anyway.  The boyfriend told my dad that he was doing it to "help" my grandma.  After that,  anytime we pulled our vehicle in my grandma's driveway past the light pole that was beside the trailer, something odd would happen.  Before we caught on about not parking past the light pole, we'd do it all the time.  One time after doing it, my dad's hood on our car flew up out of the blue without warning and almost made him wreck.  Another time, it died right there in the driveway and my dad had to haul it to our house and fix it.   There are others that I can't remember right now, as well.  This same guy paid me five bucks to cut his hair before I went to college in Atlanta back in 1985 since I was trying to cut hair for extra money, and I got hit by a car as soon as I got back to Atlanta with his money.|`|4cc767b496173b3227cf5f9f17efd2b5aa	Someone smashed a stop sign on me, but I think that was an oct.|`|DRSv6SOLaa	If a person is Holy Spirit-Filled/Born Again, it is impossible for any demons to enter.|`|wuPTBIIuaa	yes its possible    but there are many ways and means, and some are old wives tails and fairy tales. maybe the evil eye is a superstitious fairy tale.    for example you can poison sugar cubes at work with lsd. so to poison the coffee drinker or tea totlers. this is a form of sleep deprivation by element. you dont need lsd either. you can use pcp or distilled vapors too. or any type of gas. it is temporary of course so you repeat it every day or every now and then. it is complete Terrorism to the victim. and you can buy the services of that do this.|`|UWKF7x4faa	If you believe in hexes, yes.

p8nDiI3Vaa	It has to do with the laws telling children your able to do such and such a thing when you get this age. For instance, sex, you're legal at that age to have sex. It primarily starts in the home alot children aren't raised right they rely more on tv and the school to teach them and not their parents.

ATPPWOpWaa	The theory of evolution is the persistent progressional change of all life forms in which small variances from one generation to the next unconsciously conspire to evolve itself to better suit the conditions presented to the species.  Thus, all species are in a transitional state that never rests into perpetuity.  That being said it should be odd that ANY fossils of the same species would be alike in manner within the vast fossil record considering how infrequent a perspective fossil would find itself the beneficiary of the unlikely matter of events that takes a such snapshot in time.  But the contrary is true in as much that all species within the fossil record appear suddenly without previous representation and just as suddenly disappear void of any transitional manifestations or advantageous improvements that evolution relies upon.  Scientists can only point to two representative fossils and draw an unscientific unproven conclusion that one evolved into the other.  In fact there are innumerable examples of this.  But, the one thing that doesn't exist in all of creation and the vast fossil record *IS THE FOSSIL IN BETWEEN THOSE TWO*!!!!   There is not one single example in the vast universe of billions of known fossils that depicts an intermediary(missing link) of any species whatsoever.  Youve heard of the missing link in reference to human bones/fossils,  well every single species that has ever existed is totally void of a single example of a missing link for ANY species.  They simple do not exist.    Scientist stick to the world of unfamiliar and vague species to hang their hat on in the evolution lie.  Why?  Because its easier to make a sales pitch using scientific vernacular and long extinct reptiles and shellfish than it is to work in the realm of the understandable and familiar. In short, there are no "almost" elephants.  No "almost giraffes".  For evolution to be true one should find innumerable giraffes of varying stages of evolution.  It should be rare that two are the same.  Yet all are the same.  there are no exceptions.  Period.   Again, the scientists ply their trade utilizing the vague and plausible while avoiding the 'naked king' standing in front of everybody.  The only thing that can be gleaned from the fossil record are implied or coincidental similarities that fall radically short of a hundred million year progression of successively improved archetypes within the same species line.  If evolution were valid the entire fossil record would consist of almost entirely different and varied subsequent species over the eons.  Exactly the opposite is true, and that is the entire fossil record is static and unvaried.  The fact is, you can go out and dig up some saber tooth tiger bones and they will be exactly like those from one million years before.|`|9e71236ddd91a1ac14a12c704616491caa	You agree that trees come from seeds, which come from other trees.  It's a natural process of asexual reproduction.  Conversely, I've never seen a tree created out of thin air by a magical supernatural being, nor do I suspect you or anyone else has.  So why assume that this is exactly what happened in the past?      Since we know that organisms develop today by natural processes, it would be logical to assume that the first organisms also developed via natural processes.  It does not require any intelligence on the part of the individual components or an outside third party.  When sodium ions and chlorine ions combine, which sometimes occurs in nature, they form salt, without any intervention by an intelligent supreme being, nor do the ions themselves need any intelligence.  The reaction occurs due to their atomic structure.    Mathematics informs us that complex structures can arise out of simplicity.  (See: fractals, the Mandelbrot Set.)  Therefore, it should not be surprising that complex organisms could develop out of simpler organisms, so long as there is a mechanism which allows for organisms to change over time. (See: Theory of Evolution.)  There is no mathematical equivalent to the concept of a simple structure being created by an infinitely complex structure.|`|AA11297753	very well put...I like to think of it this way....If an atheist walked into a room and saw a watch on the table, he would have not doubt that the mere existence of the watch implies that there was a watch-maker|`|DuyuUJNDaa	"Difficulties of the Theory: Organs of extreme Perfection and Complication:   To suppose that the eye with all its inimitable contrivances for adjusting the focus to different distances, for admitting different amounts of light, and for the correction of spherical and chromatic aberration, could have been formed by natural selection, seems, I freely confess, absurd in the highest degree" [Charles Darwin - The Origin of Species, chap.

If I sit and simply hit the keyboard randomly, you would agree that there is a very low probability of my typing out anything that would make any sense to anybody?    That is your 'throw things up in the air' analogy. Others express it as 'a tornado in a brick factory' or similar: an entirely random process picking up and throwing things around will never (or at least, is very unlikely to) make something recognisable let alone useful.    However, I can change my example slightly. Having hit the keyboard randomly for a time, how about if I keep the occasional, purely accidental word, but discard all of the rubbish? I might only get one or two small words per thousand characters, but I would get at least some.    Now, having kept those few accidental words, I now produce more rubbish but include those accidental words. Again, I'll get rubbish but with some more accidental words mixed in; and some of my previous accidental words might even have been extended. And if I do this again, and again, and again, many, many, many times... eventually I will begin to get something that looks and reads like English.    So, things which 'work' are kept; things which 'fail' are discarded.    I wrote a program twenty-odd years ago to do this as an 'evolutionary version of the million monkeys writing Hamlet' example. The program took less time than it takes to blink before it had reproduced an entire speech from the play.    Evolution is very powerful. It's really not like the 'throwing sticks randomly' example; it keeps things that work and throws many, many times in an effort to get more things that work. This is the way that it builds complex things, not randomly, not deliberately, but progressively.|`|oBmLIDHtaa	Not being able to comprehend how something works is insufficient reason to infer the existence of an all-powerful supernatural deity in order to explain it.

When someone says you are over qualified, simply state that you are still willing to learn and don't believe your qualifications should stop them from hiring you as you'd be a great asset. That you are quick to learn new ways of doing things. You will more easily adapt to a new way of doing anything they put in front of you. You also are someone who likes to please others, so will do your job as efficiently as possible, to their liking.     People believe that when you've been trained one way for so long, you'll have a hard time learning to do things their way. Or that you'll tell them.. oh.. we used to do it this way and i think it's best. No one wants to deal with that. So, letting them know that you'll easily adapt to their company can help eliminate that worry a bit.     Tell them that you also know that the pay is much lower and are not expecting them to meet your old pay. In this economy no one can afford to pay much at all.     I own my own company and the main reason i don't care to hire someone in that is overly qualified is simply because i don't always like doing something in a way that might even be easier. I have my ways and i want to keep them my way. Ways that i might enjoy best.     The economy is bad, jobs are virtually disappearing. Every time we get a job opening or two in my town more than a thousand people apply! Almost two thousand for one opening at a hospital! So it might not be you and your education.|`|YkseyT7zaa	Doesn't sound like a 51 year old|`|QmIK2vgqaa	Yes, in life there are cheaters and there are losers.  Lie, lie away.|`|WJjfrf0Caa	i think that since a resume is only one page long, you have to leave many things out. lying by omission is probably the best way to embellish your resume.    so i don't think it would be wrong.|`|AA10819407	Used to be undereducated you lose, now too much education, you lose, go figure..   I would suggest going to a job placement office, speak to the human resources person, and ask about your options, before your situation gets more serious..|`|yk4S7uuraa	One has to do what one must do.|`|mZZ5xqZSaa	Yeah dude. I mean you have nothing to lose right? Im unemployed right now too. But then again im 17.|`|G0CLw32iaa	i would lie, desperate times call for desperate measures|`|TfijWwsYaa	yes, I would as long as the lie wasn't too big...like I went to Harvard Law School or something...but yeah, exaggerating or omitting is fine too.|`|ti97SKNSaa	I would have to say that if you are overqualified for a job, not being hired for that reason is not fair on the employers part in the first place. However if you are desperate and are willing to take a job that you are overqualified for (whatever that entails) you deserve to have that jobs so you can make ends meet.    Do what you need to do to provide as long as your not hurting anyone!|`|AVzQs5Uhaa	no and  yes it could be wrong and can damper your chances of getting another job in the future, just remember they have your social security so can look up certain things about you and if you lie on an application that is usually automatic grounds for being fired.So what is worse having to deal with taking some money out of your savings and retirement or possibly loosing a job and the possibility of having a harder time if things do improve in the job market and the chance of getting fired if they find out. Be lucky that you even have had the money to put away into saving and retirement accounts because most people aren't even able to afford to do that in today's times. Unfourtantly because you probably have a decent amount in your savings and retirement account you would probably not qualify got any aid from Department of Human Services either. I would get in contact with your local office in what ever state you are in and check on there requirements. And  no they wouldnt fire you because they found out you had a degree they would fire you on the grounds that you lied so think about it, they would probably have the mentality if you lied  about that what else could you have lied about. Also have you tried going to a local temp agency they can help to place you in jobs and find jobs for you.|`|k3LbhASGaa	you do not have to tell them everything you know, just tell them you have a high school diploma and leave it at that|`|RluCMVUSaa	Desperate times call for desperate measures... yes I would and yes it would still be wrong but, it would be a degree of wrong that I am comfortable with and can accept because no harm comes from it!    This is different then acting as though you have a degree that you don't have.  We are talking shades of grey here!  Besides if you downplay positive attributes the company will ultimately benefit from having you, so it is a win win situation.  Lying maliciously is bad, lying to get a job that you are over-quallified for to keep your home is fine!    Good luck!|`|kKACyAM8aa	Its not a lie in the sense that its not hurting anyone, and you don't want to have to do it. You need to do what you have to do to protect and help yourself as long as your not hurting anyone in the process. I don't think this is a lie, it more like hiding something or keeping a secret. You should do it, and don't feel bad about it for one second.|`|rcPnnfmmaa	No.|`|CCqqTw6paa	i would lie  rather live with that on my conscience than living on the streets|`|AA11314600	Hell yes, if the situation is that bad.|`|Cs2pDMbeaa	phhh chyeeeaaa... of course... i lied when i did not even need a job, and they believed me so knock yourself out go for it... just make it seem somewhat realistic.|`|iWrXGoDyaa	I think you should get any job you can get...|`|qXD9Hs5waa	no because soon they will find out the truth and lieing is bad anyway because the light always comes out of the dark|`|tSYB11xdaa	No, you would just end up getting in trouble one way another. The truth will always come out eventually.|`|aAqxTw98aa	nope, its not wrong to downplay your education, but i dont think that you need to.|`|wNSI1wdCaa	I would lie a bit yes but not with my qualifications and where I've worked. I'd lie about how wonderful my last job and how much experience I gained even though I was stuck 8 hours day doing the same thing!|`|POzCKBzvaa	Absolutely. I think the point of any resume and/or interview is to make the employer *think* that you are right for the job. Once you're hired you show them they were right to hire you, even if that means going beyond the call of duty so to speak and doing a better job than someone who does not have your same qualifications.  If this seems to be a pattern perhaps you're selling yourself short? I say change up your resume to make yourself seem more applicable to the type of jobs for which you have so far been applying, and take your resume as-is now to employers looking to hire for a job you think might be out of your reach. Who knows? You might just get something better than what you were expecting!  It's a tough time out there right now as far as getting hired goes. Keep at it and try not to get discouraged.|`|WuhIoS1laa	I am not in those circumstances, but if I were up against the wall, I certainly would leave items off my resume.     Some people have different versions of their resume tailored to the specific position they are seeking. Every so often you should shake down the wording of yours to make sure it's fresh and relevant to the kind of position you want.     After all, you are highlighting your career on that piece of paper. I choose to highlight those features I think a potential employer is looking for over the ones they might not care so much about.      While I don't advocate lying and claiming experience or education you lack, saying you went to high school is not untrue. It's probably the only time a lie of omission is not out of line.|`|3cv920o1aa	I guess lieing is always wrong but my brother once told me fake it till you make it.. act like you no all about the job..god will forgive you its not like the lie is hurting neone its just helping you and them..they need a helper you need employment...dont stress about it you seem good hearted for even asking let yourself slide..|`|eceLQUj5aa	You can be a real douche and claim age discrimination.    http://www.eeoc.gov/policy/adea.html|`|xDubataIaa	No it would not be wrong IMO. Times are tough, you got to do what you got to do. A lot of people do the opposite and lie to get jobs they have no business having. I see absolutely no problem with downplaying your education and experience to get a job.     And don't listen to the idiots saying "the truth will come out so don't lie". Seriously. Could you imagine a manager saying "Well it has come to my attention that you have a college degree. YOU ARE FIRED!!!". No of course not, that is just silly.|`|AA11187638	I sympathise. I have been denied jobs before for being "overqualified." What the hell does that even mean?? How can one be overqualified for anything?    Normally I don't condone dishonesty, but you have to look out for yourself first. Don't lie outright because you'll probably regret it later on. However, I think it's fine to exaggerate and positively spin what is already true. You may consider leaving out your college education, if you think that's what they mean by "overqualified."|`|vULVL1jmaa	Desperate times call for desperate measures. I think a lot of people lie to get jobs and most actually try to beef up their education and experience when what you're trying to do is the opposite. Do what you need to do, if it's going to get your bills paid and all you want to do is get a job and be able to make an honest living then by all means go for it!
1NtwIeLyaa	Yes, demons are VERY real.  When Lucifer was thrown from heaven, 1/3 of the angels went with him and became demons.  That is scriptural.  If you're Christian, you have probably read about it.  If you haven't read about it, it's time for you to do some reading! :-)<br>  <br>  Harmony|`|4WqvTAfmaa	The Greater and Lesser Keys of King Solomon<br>  This pair of books goes into great detail about the names, ranks, symbols and sigils of the demons. The entire of Medieval ceremonial magic was based largely on them. The magician used demons for several reasons. They used them as a test of their will and knowledge. They used them to accomplish benefits to the magician. And they partly justified that work by believing they were humanizing the demons. In the case of a demon, being more like a human means they are growing toward heaven, thus being redeemed. <br>  <br>  The cost of failure varied depending on the demon and its status in the nether realms. The price may include the magician'ssoul, or later years of his life, or getting what he asked for -literally- but not in the way he wanted it. <br>  <br>  I suggest Secrets of the Mgickal Grimoires, by Aaron Leitch, from Llewellyn Publications, in that it surveys the whole field.|`|AA10810835	Just a few, Christianity, despite its morals, are fake and wrong for mankind, in Christianity, they are fallen angels, and those angels do not exist, its as good a tale as the Gods of Ancient Greece and Rome.<br>  Although some of the creatures and spirits in Greece and Rome are very much real.<br>  Christianity is an idea of getting people to go against evil, and help others for the good of it, so they invented these 'fallen angels' as a moral to not go to the dark side and be evil/nasty. Just like a few other religions that are designed to keep hopes up, which is practically all of them...|`|AA11521494	I don't know about Christian demonology but demons are VERY real.  I've never seen any of them or heard them speak but I've felt them.  Voices in your head are almost certainly your own thoughts reflected back at you.  Demons only manifest themselves if you allow yourself a way in, as I well know.  In that sense, I know Satan well, and also my patron demon Asmodeus.|`|paRGbr7Xaa	Most "demons" in Christian demonology are nothing more than demonized Pagan gods, usually middle-eastern ones (Sumerian, Babylonian, etc.).|`|tGkFPA82aa	If you can accept angels, why would you have difficult accepting demons?  It's not like you can kill either.|`|nx7QtF0paa	It is not a stupid question.. You're a Christian right?  Don't you remember reading where Jesus cast out demons?  Do you think demons only existed then and not now?  Demonic influences are all around us everyday which is why the bible says: <br>  <br>  For we wrestle not against flesh and blood, but against principalities, against powers, against the rulers of the darkness of this world, against spiritual wickedness in high [places].  Ephesians 6:12<br>  <br>  Our battle as a Christian is a spiritual battle not a physical one. <br>  <br>  Regarding your aunt and seeing an angel,... you do know that angels of God are men right?  Remember even Satan can appear as an angel of light.  If she said the angel had a halo. I can assure you it was NOT of the Lord.
hL5Kjdk8aa	I get stared at no matter where I go. I wouldnt say "more" racist because we don't have groups like the KKK and Skinheads and millions of websites devoted to ethnic cleansing.

Brown and Black men love them some white meat, take it as a compliment, or not, like I .hahaha ok im talkin out my A**.|`|7b105c20abc8cb7babb72ce9a68a74daaa	Equally racist|`|REC4YgOuaa	Get a life are you serious....just because people are staring at you does not make them racism, and besides when you are on a train people tend to stare at you...duh..where the hell else are they suppose to look at. And everyone is racist in their own way whether they want to admit it or not.|`|jd14u32qaa	People simply starring at you because you're white is NOT racism.  If they stood at the door and said you couldn't even get on the train because you were white, THAT would be racism.|`|xqn0U0H6aa	No white people are worse  ~ This is coming from a white person too|`|eFxN59SXaa	i like black people but sometimes they tend to stick together and not like whites for some reason or another. i personally believe skin color shouldn't matter.

XlhR7ooHaa	My theorie is they have orange hair|`|ewWUFWyWaa	In the slaughter house religion...!!!    You probably heard the name of "SLAUGHTER HOUSE RELIGION" given to Christianity. ALL Christians need to snack God the Son Jesus Christ in some way as part of the salvation package. Jesus talked about eating his meat and drinking his blood to have eternal life     John 6:53 (Infallible King James Version) Then Jesus said unto them, Verily, verily, I say unto you, Except ye eat the flesh of the Son of man* (*Jesus Christ), and drink his blood, ye have no life in you.    It takes years of Christian Bible schooling to learn how to do it just right or Christians can get real sick and die! Protestants have relaxed this warning, but Catholics still believe that the host and wine is magically transformed into the ACTUAL meat and blood of Jesus so extraordinary measures are taken after Mass to monitor that no trace of the body of Jesus Christ is found in any spent chewing gum stuck under the church pews!      1 Corinthians 1:29-30 (infallible King James Version of the Bible) For he that eateth and drinketh unworthily, eateth and drinketh damnation to himself, not discerning the Lord's body. For this cause many are weak and sickly among you, and many sleep* (*have died).    The Bible story says that most of the Jewish followers of Jesus wouldnt stomach so much grossness and quit following him. The Bible writers still had the idea of having Jesus meat beaten to a pulp thoroughly tenderized and heavily marinated in Roman soldiers spit as the dignified spotless Lamb of God taking away the sins of the world while grotesquely hanging nailed to a Holy Cross! Today ALL Christians and Catholics snack on Jesus spit flavored meat and drink his Holy Blood in the Sacrament of the Holy Communion to go to Heaven when they die!     There is more brutal violence in the Bible than in any TV show. The Bible writers have this God character rewarding people committing the most heinous crimes as long as they do it to further his cause! Islam copied the same idea from the Bible! All the Bible writers picked heroes based on their past bloody criminal performance like Moses, Samson, King David, Saint Paul, just to mention a few. Even the King James Version of the Bible promotes the killing of infants in its fullest CONTEXT! Most Fundie Preachers on the low end of the IQ scale will tell you that the Bible is full of parables and that it cant be taken literally... short of seriously! It takes many years of schooling and practice to become a professional preacher! They ALL learn how to cover up, give thumbs down and explain away anything objectionable in the Bible! The Bible is obviously of human origin.  Making a statement that it was dictated by a God who claims to be full of wrath all the time is an insult to people with a respectable IQ!    Psalm 137:8-9 - O Daughter of Babylon, doomed to destruction, happy is he who repays you for what you have done to us- he who seizes your infants and dashes them against the rocks.    The Bible teaches that the enemies of God ought to be killed in their infancy when it is easier to get rid of them (Amen?)! The old Bible strategy of birth control is not abortion, but the killing of infants AFTER THEY ARE BORN and before they grow up and become a menace to Gods chosen people developing WMD or what have you that not even God can defeat!  (Judges 1:19)    Revelation 2:23 (NIV) (Jesus Christ says in his apocalyptic REVELATION for the last days) I WILL STRIKE HER CHILDREN DEAD* (*Just for the heck of it! No abortionist can beat Jesus at killing babies! (Amen?!) This time it is Sweet Jesus killing the innocent children to announce his 2nd coming and at the same time to teach everybody in the Churches a lesson on WHO IS THE BOSS! In our society today Jesus would be in jail for promoting the KILLING OF CHILDREN to favor a particular religion. Thats why the Preachers are so selective in what they teach from the Bible! They came up with the PRO-LIFE bit on their own to dissociate themselves from this REVELATION, and from the routine slaying of children in the Bible, and whats even grosser yet about cooking and eating them for dinner! All this forced on Gods chosen people for his pleasure! Christianity is a slaughter house religion. No question about it! The Bible writers were very creative about how to call religious peoples attention!) Then ALL THE CHURCHES WILL KNOW that I am he who searches hearts and minds, and I will repay each of you according to your deeds.* (*Not even the Mafia bosses measure up to this Jesus Christ in the Bible! Christians may expose the Mafia, but they surely LOVE JESUS! And they cover up for him!)     The story of Jesus was written long after he died. He is said to be the greatest religious teacher ever known in the world. Jesus suggested the slaughter by drowning in the middle of the sea of anybody causing a Christian who is a moron in the Faith to stumble (Mat 18:6). He also suggested the voluntary shedding of offending body parts like an eye, arm, leg or what have you to follow him (Mat 18:8), including male castration (Mat 19:12). Anything to make it into the Kingdom of Heaven! Today no teacher cares to be as great as Jesus was or he/she may end up in jail! Most Christians today dont pay attention to Jesus Christs gory suggestions, but throughout the Christian dominated Dark Ages some prominent clergy persons castrated themselves for the Kingdoms sake! Many witches and slaves were abused and killed here in this ONE NATION UNDER GOD, too! (Google Salem witches and castrati in Wikipedia!) So good luck in your quest for the truth and intellectual satisfaction or are you after the peace of mind that only religion can offer? Even Jesus says, thou shalt know the truth and the truth shalt set thee free!|`|DRSv6SOLaa	A True Evangelical believes in The Holy Deity of Jesus Christ!

bab98853150b199df79ea228be16f757aa	To be 'authentic' you'll need to use cotton, linen, or wool.  Get a very dark grey fabric or very dark brown fabric for the 'dress.'  Get a good pattern if you can find one ... you may use a 'night shirt' pattern if you make it with a higher neckline and 'floor length' ... don't do any 'overstitching' or do 'hand overstitching' only.  Make sure the sleeves are full length with slight 'cuffing' that you can tuck some 'wrapped cloth' into to 'protect your arms.'  Make an 'underskirt' of dark green (no 'patterns' to ANY of the cloth ... only the very rich wore patterns, which were embroidery and very costly) and make it so it 'sags' a bit to drag behind you when you walk.  You'll also want a good pair of 'high brown shoes' with a 'slight high heel' (no more than 2" on the heel) and you'll want to 'make the shoes look worn out) ... rub dirt on them daily for three months, let the laces fray and break (only leather laces, please) ...   Your hat also needs to be assembled and 'worn out' before Halloween.  Most real witches didn't wear 'pointed hats' (those are a 'modern affectation', not 'real') ... you'll want a basic 'old fashioned' wimple in dark brown, grey, or black, with a worn out 'straw hat' or 'bonnet' (closed in back with a deep 'shade' that goes around your face).    When you are 'doing' your hair, you need to get it as DIRTY as possible (most people took a bath twice a year back then), and make sure it's 'stringy' and sort of 'pokes out' from the back, sides, and bonnet front.  Have fun ... you may need to 'explain' your costume, but so what?  You'll be 'accurate' and you have the TIME to make this costume look very real.  Oh, you'll also need a nice (but old and worn out by Halloween) flower basket ... one with a good handle and a rectangular and fairly 'flat' bottom, not a 'closed one' but sort of 'open' at both ends ... it's best 'hand woven' by you, so gather the grasses and start 'weaving' so it can 'dry out' and look perfect ... every witch was probably simply 'gathering herbs' to make medicines (potions) so you may want to learn about he 'herbal medicines' available in your area ... things like foxglove, nightshade, even daffodils (as if you'll find any daffodils in October ... ) ...|`|e640e5fc04f1c4da3326c5429e707bdcaa	In the 1700's everyone wore homespun or animal hides crafted into articles of clothing. Unless you were rich of course and then you would have dyed, fine silk and other imported fabrics and hand knotted lace.   So if you want to be a real witch then picture yourself as socially outcast, since it was unacceptable and you would be arrested and possibly burnt at the stake. So I suggest you get homespun looking skirts and underskirts and tie your hair back, and cover your head with a shawl, and then have all kinds of bags with neat things in them. If you go to a chinese herbal store you can find dried lizards, wierd looking mushrooms, bark, shellfish, leaves, moss etc. and you can carry some firewood and a stake, or have your boyfirend haul you around. It wasn't fun to be called a witch in the 1700's.|`|600367b3135824b97a54e03105e6a6feaa	i believe they wore "natural" colors like browns, blacks, dark purples and greens.|`|pGF6Xdghaa	please do not go as a witch.. It's only febuary.. I know you want to have an early costume, but a witch could be the worst thing to go as..  Jesus Christ died on the cross for you  to get save us from sin.  He wouldn't want you to go as a witch for halloween.  Even though some people do, they don't know any better..   They think it's just fun.. It might be fun to them, but if you are a christian you shouldn't wear something that would hurt your faith.  Try going as something else.. They're are plenty of things that are cute, and fun..  I went as as ariel last year, and an angel the year before..  Try to think of something God honoring and not something that would honor satan..  God bless you: )|`|AA12203324	Keep in mind, the more authentic you are, the more explaining you'll have to do for the ignorant.|`|FmazIF6Maa	The people who were charged with Witchcraft were mainly Christian.     Witches who were around wouldn't have every called themselves by the word "Witch" as they didn't see themselves as such. These were families that has passed down folk magic of the old ways, who  worshipped their regions/culture's Gods.      How people dressed depended largely on their region or culture.    There were  no groups of Witches that had a specific way of dressing, especially the colonists who were all Christians.       I'd say any Renn Faire or colonial style costume, preferrably with some kind of cloak/cape, add a hat & a broom and you'll be good.     But there is no accurate/authentic Witch garb of times past. That's all from fiction.|`|rOP8oG23aa	Greens and browns, and maybe even some type of ceremonial robe.      There were a lot of rumors and misunderstandings about witches back about 300 years ago, so any information you may find will probably have a bit of that as well.

If you want to look like someone who was put to death for being a witch, check out images of pilgrims.|`|5UTaHHyKaa	they would wear green, gold, red but shimmery and darkened|`|EkLJDcc7aa	I think they would wear black, blue, and dark green:]  im not positive, but it would look good.|`|6f812b070bb6a7494447f70abb1119fdaa	Well, if you're going for historical, as it turns out there were no witches.  You would have to dress like a puritan farm woman, falsely accused.      http://www.greatkat.com/03/salem2.jpg  http://i157.photobucket.com/albums/t45/m...    You could wear the conical hat to get the point across of what you're trying to do, or the male pilgrim's hat with the buckle.|`|1vyDPIWGaa	Unfortunately, I would say that 'witches' from the 1700s probably wore exactly what everyone else from the 1700s wore. It was a time when many people were accused of being witches and killed, so if they really were they probably wouldn't advertise themselves by 'costumes' or nontraditional clothing of the era.|`|W0rcm3awaa	how do i explain this, they probably didn't wear anything special. You see witches and other people who didn't exactly go with the flow and did things that were frowned upon wanted to blend in as much as possible. Which is why today the people who wear all black are ridiculous. A true witch would probably dress like everyone else and try to go unnoticed and NOT draw attention to themselves, same back then.    Thank about it, back then people were not very accepting and even predjudice and very supersticious towards witches and it might even end up killing you.    I'd say wear natural fibers, nothing exclusively man-made. Remember wicca's are more nature-oriented. You might want to lean towards a high official or shaman because they would actually have things that would denote them specifically as wicca/druid.     Longer hair, think more natural. Does this help you? I don't want to put too much stuff in because i think by guaging what i've said you can gather in what direction to go. I hope this helped.|`|8OpFYoO4aa	"You must not preserve a sorceress alive." ~ Exodus 22:18

But we are also told not to tempt the Lord our God.    So, my thoughts are he was was thinking "Always be prepared" and grabbed a few extra just in case.    Edit:  I gave you the benefit of the doubt that you meant David, but if it was a mistake on your behalf, I still see no reason to berate you publically for a simple mistake.

That was David vs. Goliath!    Mat 25:1-4 Then shall the kingdom of heaven be likened unto ten virgins, which took their lamps, and went forth to meet the bridegroom.

Daniel was the guy in the Lions Den.  2. It is recorded in The Bible that the Benjaminites had a battalion of slingers who could hit a target the size of a human hair (it don`t say from how far though) Evidently these skills were available long before Davids time.  3. David managed his Dads` sheep and would have had plenty of time to practice his slinging skills. He did say that he had taken sheep from the mouths of Loins and Bears, no doubt after bopping them with a well aimed slingshot stone.  4. If you have ever used an elastic slingshot /catapult (not the same as Davids`) You will know that only smooth, round stones fly straight and it is hard to find the best of these.  5. I think that David would have thought to himself "I reckon that I can take that big guy out in one but just to make sure I`ll take a bit of extra ammo in case the first don`t fly straight" Remember that he tried out a soldiers armour but found that it restricted his movement/throwing arm. He was being extra careful.|`|KlXUrxBfaa	Good question, when something is put in, there is a reason of reasoning.|`|bxYWJAYNaa	Its probably just something ancient sling-throwers always did.    Maybe you put one stone in the sling while slotting the other four between the five digits of your spare hand, ready to quickly reload.    But its one of those little cultural things, from 2,500 years ago, whose relevance eludes us, because we just don't have people in this day and age running around with stone slings.    I saw something perhaps similar on a documentary about some Amazonian tribe using poisonous darts dipped in frog venom. They planted one in the tube, and a few others carefully splayed in their teeth. But they could only carry a small amount of this ammo at one time to hunt, which was probably always the same the number out of practicality.|`|U51pBeLfaa	There may a symbolic reason. Twelve is the base number. Twelve tribes of Israel and twelve disciples. Seven is the lucky number. If you divide a baker's dozen (13) in half you are lucky to get the bigger half (7). As you say God allows nothing by chance, therefore Daniel (formerly known as David) cannot pick up seven stones which would indicate reliance on luck; but picked up five stones (12-7 stones) which indicated his reliance on God.    Source: Post prophetic insight. ( Nobody else knows; so nobody else knows I am wrong)    Aside: I am sure someone asked this question when I first studied this in a bible study.|`|4e25e7483d2fca447ca6574ccc5af0c4aa	just in case he missed? and it was david vs. goliath, daniel took on the lions.        -Christian|`|dz2YYh7Saa	By the way it was David not Daniel.    Because although David trusted in God, David also knew that to take on any challenge in life--even with God's help--he needed to be as well prepared as he could be. So he did his homework. He studied Goliath and his ways. He learned what he could about the Philistines and their methods. And he discovered something crucial to his decision to picking up five smooth stones, instead of only one.     Goliath had brothers--four of them (2 Samuel 21.19-22). David knew there could well be the possibility that when he killed Goliath that his four brothers might try to extract revenge. So David prepared himself: he picked up five stones, one for each of the Philistine brothers.     According to the account, David trusted in God to do what God could do. But he didn't just leave it all up to God. David did what David could do to insure his own competence in the face of a challenge. David picked up five stones because he'd done his homework and he was prepared.
