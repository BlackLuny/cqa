Sz7cnFRsaa	when you done a test it may have been to early to tell, not very one shows up when they think they are pregnant when using an pregnancy test, you can reqest a blood test from your GP. Google is great for research. I to have irregualr periods and I am on my first round of clomid. Good luck.|`|Mwhclezaaa	I'd say wait an extra week before doing the test so hormone levels can increase.|`|lTkYWiy5aa	Even with well-timed sex your chances of conception are only 25%. It's possible that the medication has messed your cycle up a little bit. See your doctor for more advice.|`|MtC3CWZraa	Just because you ovulated doesn't mean the sperm and egg managed to connect.
H6QkoukSaa	Sam started rolling around 16 weeks too, now he can roll front to back and vice versa.......which is NOT fun at bed times, he wont stay still to go to sleep or wont believe me that it is bed time, lol.<br>  <br>  Alana didn't roll until 20 weeks + <br>  <br>  Ryan was rolling around 18 weeks.<br>  <br>  There is such a wide range or "norms" for kids, Charlie is neither early or late. He is on track with his development.|`|qjDxKXENaa	every baby is different but they start rolling around 16-20 weeks.|`|qXkywBogaa	am 18 and i still cant make a hand made joint. i just use a roller <br>  so ***** easy and it turns out better.|`|dXVA1wHDaa	My son just rolled front to back for the first time yesterday. He just turned 19 weeks.  And it took a lot of encouragement from me, i.e. laying behind him, calling his name, lol.<br>  <br>   My mum was *sure* we all rolled at 3 months (me and 3 siblings), but I don't know if she's remembering correctly.  My niece didn't roll til around 6 months, but she was born two months early.<br>  <br>  I don't know about when they should, I just think they do it in their own time :)|`|5ZvALiclaa	my lil boy didn't roll till after 5 months as he just couldn't care less about it, lol, but he was sitting at 5.5mths and is now crawling and he's 7mths1wk old. My other two did it about 3.5months and rolled everywhere for ages.<br>  i don't think 16wks is out of place, pretty normal and average i'd say
7a29609061cc85b8213f55d1598f7a9aaa	No, you are not.|`|e1122490267c2903bd14e9cbbfe2af5daa	Take another one first thing in the morning. If you are still unsure go to the doctor and request a blood test.|`|kN00x0Vaaa	The best bet is to wait a couple more weeks and test again.<br>  <br>  My sister gave birth to 3 children, and 2 of them she had her period during her whole entire pregnancy!<br>  <br>  Women know their bodies and if you end up not being pregnant it may be something else. OR you could be stressing out so much about whether your prego or not that your causing your period and self to act funny!|`|h85kkDsbaa	If you have had a period (even tho light) and a negative test then its unlikely you are pregnant. But bleeding during pregnancy can happen so wait a week or so and see how you feel then, you can always take another test. X|`|KOwzDLPdaa	I suppose it is still possible, you should wait a week and test again.|`|cQq9vTTraa	wait for a week and then have test.|`|wWpmYSMEaa	You might just be psyching yourself out. I would say that your not pregnant because you got your period and peroids can fluctuate and be weird. The negative pregnancy test is also another reason. However to be sure i would wait a couple of more days then take another one to be sure.|`|EuYtJFj1aa	if u got ur period that means ur definitely not pregnant even if ur period was light and u took a pregnancy test and it said negative so dont worry ur not pregnant..|`|Pp4F6D5Waa	It could be something else, but id wait another couple of weeks and do another test.|`|I9tpJY4Maa	wait at least 2 weeks and then take test again
H6QkoukSaa	Lol, I was done at 2 kids. 2 hands, 2 kids. Well, um a higher power had a hand in number 3 and I am definitely done. I'm just hanging by a thread, I'm super busy and I don't like the fact I have absolutely no time for myself. Now I know that sounds selfish, but in reality, if I'm not happy how can I parent the children I have to the best of my ability.<br>  <br>  I get broody and clucky now and then. Sometimes as I am packing clothes and baby things to give away I feel sad that there will be no more babies for me, but I am a realist. If I had anymore kids I would go INSANE, lol|`|sagjCRvKaa	I had 2 children ages 15 and 9 at the time, and I thought I was done. I got divorced and remarried, to a man who never had children and he was 42 at the time, and said he did not need to have children. During our 2nd yr of marriage I had a miscarriage, I thought my husband was going to cry and that is when I realized he wanted children. So I just wanted to have one more, but we had two, a total of 4 for me. My two youngest are 2 and 7 mths. I am so glad they are here, both girls, they have changed my life and his. I would not know what I was missing, They maybe a lot of work, but hey brighten my day, with their smiles, and innocence.|`|KOwzDLPdaa	We have two boys and I'm about 6 months along with a little girl. I was one of five and just always new that I didn't want to have the little circus/zoo my mother had. So I told my husband three was the cut off, even if we had a third boy. (I actually told him in my opinion, any more than 3 was considered a litter LOL No offense to you though!)<br>  <br>  But honestly we looked at the quality of life we would be able to provide each child with based on the cost of raising them. ie maybe we can afford to take 3 kids to disneyland one day but not 4 :)<br>  <br>  And congrats on your feeling of completeness and contention! We all need some of that!|`|QnJvJ67uaa	Its a toughie!! I think you make your choices through a number of factors like income , time, support and house size etc.<br>  I was a bad incubator and all 3 of my kids were prem...the last being very prem and in hospital for 7 weeks so I said NO MORE....I cam eso close to loosing him that I couldn't have gone through it again...we also have a teeny tiny house LOL.<br>  I think even after choosing when to stop there will always be a part of you that thinks...hmmm..what if,???<br>  Kudos on having 6 BTW :D|`|VyMIFe6Vaa	When i had my second. My world changed completely. I thought having a 2 yar old was tough but now when its just him and me it's a piece of cake. But later on in life when i get married i'll probably have one more.|`|ZBc16tOvaa	well i said i don't want any more after my first and hear i am seven kids later i got my tubes done after my last so i wouldnt be tempted lol|`|qR3MYSOIaa	I had a daughter first.  When I had my second child and the doctor said "It's a boy"  I knew I was done.<br>  <br>  Very happy with one of each.|`|GDnJYq0Aaa	when they  become to much for you to handle idk|`|MxhNzW7Oaa	I have 2 little boys now and I feel that I am not complete. I've always wanted 3 children; 2 boys & 1 girl. We plan to TTC #3 at the end of the year and I hope for a baby girl. Don't get me wrong, I LOVE my boys but I am severely outnumbered! (Even our cat is a male!) Also, I want a girl to do girly things with while my hubby takes the boys hunting or fishing. If we have another boy, it would still be the last child for us.<br>  <br>  But I also will only be 25 when #3 is born so who knows if we would decide to have another in our 30's. It's not in our *plan* but you just never know!|`|Bhy4k9wPaa	I have 3 sons, one with my husband and 2 from previous...And I don't feel done yet. My husband and I are talking about trying if that makes sense, deciding when the best time is. I'd love to start trying now (our youngest is 2) and I think that it would be a nice gap. My husband had testicular cancer before we met so it might take us a bit longer to fall pregnant (mind you, with our youngest, it was only 3 months...). He's not totallt convinced yet-he wants another one but not yet!<br>  <br>  I feel that 4 will be just nice...Mind you I said that after 2...Maybe I just like even numbers? lol<br>  <br>  Oh and i'm with what someone said up there-i'd love to be a surrogate for someone one day. What an fulfilling thing to do for someone.|`|G9ywiLqvaa	6!  wow, good for you!<br>  i wanted 3 or 4.  but after 2, i was told i couldn't give birth anymore, for health reasons.  it was sad news.  but after a while, yeah, 2 wonderfully lovable boys is ok.  great, even!  <br>  i've finally accepted the fact that i'm done. :)|`|AA10943329	I want more....will you have one for me? I will take very good care and don't care if it is a boy or girl. I wish I was in a place that I knew I didn't want anymore|`|DcVoq5Tuaa	after the birth of my 4th child and many complications, I knew it wasn't worth risking my health to have any more.|`|FCFdYuchaa	<a href="http://pregnancy-parenting-guide.blogspot.com/" rel="nofollow">http://pregnancy-parenting-guide.blogspo...</a>
AA12395149	It depends on which pill she is on, not all have the same ingredients.  It's better to just buy Plan B as it is.  Also, it has to be taken within 72 hours of unprotected sex.  If she should happen to get pregnant, the risks to the baby are minimal, if at all.|`|AA12192295	plan B is a high dose of the birth control pill. Every brand is different though and there are converter charts out there that will tell you how many of each type of BC to use as a morning after. It is also said that taking it and becoming pregnant should not harm the child. 7 is a bit much though... but if its being taken as Plan B within 72 hours of having sex, it should work just as Plan B is she is using the right amount.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.plannedparenthood.org/health-topics/morning-after-pill/emergency-contraception-pill-chart-19304.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.plannedparenthood.org/health-...</a>|`|h85kkDsbaa	I dont know what would happen but i wouldn't suggest doing it, if your friend is pregnant then she needs to say her dr.|`|eu6UQElYaa	An overdose of birth control pills is unlikely to be life threatening to her but it's also unlikely to work as efficiently as plan B.   It would likely make her sick and could result in some pretty scary side effects.  And if she did still end up pregnant, that much in terms of birth control could harm a developing fetus.|`|MtC3CWZraa	That's not true! You can't just take a ton of regular BC and have it work like plan B.<br>  <br>  It probably wouldn't affect a pregnancy, but it puts your friend at serious risk of blood clots.
JQKADWyzaa	I like Jordin Brooke<br>  If tghe child gets afraid it's too masculine like previously stated, she could have her nickname be just brooke,<br>  I've seen lot's of girls named both kamren and jordin, and I've always thought they were nice names<br>  Theyre you're children so name them what you want!|`|5xSXJEVoaa	I think Kamren Nicole sounds better.It is also feminine.|`|7XIWtNr6aa	I like Kamren Nicole. I hate the name Jordin. Brooke is a pretty name though|`|c34ff1f2d66a580bdbc491850122d151aa	Jordin Brooke|`|cQq9vTTraa	jordin brooke is better|`|MW1yrHbOaa	i like them|`|kPl8TTzNaa	They are masculine and horrid for a little girl. Giving them trashy spellings does not make Jordan and Cameron any less masculine.|`|fe85b7533efbe3a2098d9091abfe83d1aa	Personally I don't like it when people spell long-standing names like Jordan and Cameron differently just for effect... but that's just me, perhaps I'm old fashioned.  If you love them, then go for it!|`|s9aTmNHQaa	It sounds like you're trying too hard to be different.  Instead of using different ways to spell a name find something else, Brooke and Nicole sound nice but ug I would forget about the first names.|`|M1gL4Jd6aa	They are just not my thing sorry.  I'm into girly names and these are quite boyish and actually extremely popular at the moment.  That's just my taste and I think you should go with what you love!|`|Am54a7c0aa	I think Kamren Nicole has a nicer flow than Jordin Brooke, in my opinion.
sLkruqYVaa	it sounds like you re going through a really hard time and i feel for you, the advice i d give would be to not pay her any attention when she does this, if she hits you then firmly (not roughly) push her hand away and walk away from her if it is attention seeking then that sould work to show her that you don t get attention through bad behaviour, however i d hold back from yelling at her or getting angry (i know it can be hard at times) because any attention be it positive or negative is still attention, you know they say terrible 2s as a guideline, sometimes it comes early sometimes late.<br>  As for the toy throwing make a point of putting said toy up where she can t get it and tell her that as long as she will be naughty with her toys she won t be getting it back.If she has been good for an hour or so then as a reward give her back the toy telling her the reason she can have it back ie because she s behaved nicely<br>  i hope that helped a little<br>  good luck|`|kN00x0Vaaa	A lot of children do this! Some do it because they see they get a reaction from you when they do it, and some do it just because.<br>  <br>  Most of the children grow out of it though!|`|lfMJPZ67aa	When she does this pick her up and hold her close to you but firm and take her to the window and point some thing out to look at to take the focus of the tantrum. Make a game out of it and tell her to see if she can find some thing like a bird or some thing like that. If this doesn't work what I did to my daughter when she chucked a tantie was pointed at her and laughed and said that it was really funny to do it more as I rolled around on the floor near her and laughed. She soon got sick of it and stopped doing it. If you want them to do some thing they wont, get the picture.|`|ErmcT4uUaa	Wow that's a tuff one.<br>  Well when I was a kid I used to do that too.<br>  Then my father got a job.|`|ajOlzSJ1aa	My son was similar to this, his was down to frustration, and he just had to learn that there were boundaries and rules, and everyone had to stick to them.<br>  I know it can be so difficult, I have three kids, and it is easy to give in to them, but I stuck at it, and he has grown into a wonderful young person now!|`|oScgvcjaaa	i cant tell you weather it normal or not ,but i can tell you that my son is 18 months old and he ,bangs his head,on floor/walls ,but does it when ive told him off for doing something he shouldn't have been ,he also smacks him self round the head. ,i have never smack him so i don't understand why he does this . .good luck.x|`|vcxdTXbraa	unfortunately it is normal or at least my son did it.

AA12395149	The number of weeks is from her LMP and if she is almost 10 weeks, that would make her LMP around the 12th of December.  Making her ovulate around the 26th.  It seems like it is pretty likely that this is your kid.  However, if you are still unsure, there is always DNA testing, but you can't legally compell her to do it unless she is trying to get financial support from you.  Good luck.|`|ssDPdqZaaa	It very well could be yours,, with the time period you gave its not impossible. Ultrasounds are never 100%<br>  At the same time it might not be. ether way if you think she is a dishonest person, then I would defiantly try to talk with her.  The only way you can find out for sure is to get a blood test. If you told her your concerns, and let her know that for your peace of mind,  that you will be getting a blood test, Im sure she would understand. This might even help you find out the truth earlier then a test. if she really thinks your the father she probably would not abject, if she is not sure or just lying she might make a fuss or even come clean. Just make sure you  go about this in non-offensive way. if you hurt her feelings or make her mad, it will make things much worse. I hope everything works out for you,, and remember get a blood test, so you wont always wonder if the child is really yours.|`|ytGaDM7Haa	The way it is counted is weird. They count the pregnancy starting from the first day of your last period. Obviously you will not be pregnant when you have your period, you generally get pregnant two weeks later when you are ovulating. I don't know why they count it like that, I hate it, but they do.<br>  I hope this helps, and good luck, it's probably yours.|`|79eRDIbXaa	No because its usually around 2 weeks after your last period they cant it from. So say its day 14 - shes ovulating and she gets pregnant.<br>  It would have been her period two weeks before right. And its usually counted from around that day of how pregnant you are. So put two weeks before when you had sex that 10 weeks.<br>  I think you are the Dad. If in any dealt you should ask her but it sounds about right to me. Congrats|`|iikdZKO7aa	Sorry mate, but it sounds as though she may have fallen pregnant before you. <br>  I guess you have to decide if you want to stay with her and treat the child as your own. All the best!|`|h85kkDsbaa	I agree with marysue, i think the baby is yours. Go on the internet as you can work out conception dates from the babys due date.|`|CBTAgeu4aa	Sounds like to me that you hope the kids isn't yours.|`|cQq9vTTraa	do a DNA test to confirm.|`|yli1X3avaa	Although the period of time, since you two had sex, is about a week shorter than period of time she'd been having the baby doesn't make you not the father of that baby. Think when did you two had sex before december 26th? Maybe you two had sex 1-2 weeks before december 26th. Because sometimes it takes time for the sperm and the egg to fertilized and turn into an embryo. But if you're having any doubt about the baby, it's better to ask your partner if you're really the father of the baby, but in the good way, where she won't be offended. Or if you want you can just wait till the baby is born, because I don't think that you can take a DNA test of the baby of 9 weeks old. Hope I helped...|`|I9tpJY4Maa	they can never really tell exactly how many weeks she is for certain this early i wouldn,t panic yet wait for next ultrasound|`|ZA11WBR2aa	It doesn't seem like yours.

If the scan said 9 weeks and 5 days based on her LMP that means she would have had her period around the 13th December and fallen pregnant around the 27th December (14 days later).<br>  <br>  I do think this is your baby but if you are really unsure then request a paternity test as soon as the baby is born.|`|MtC3CWZraa	That number on the ultrasound is based on her last period.

I would do a test in a couple of days and see what that comes back as, if the first one comes back negtive then re-do the test and you could also request a blood test from your GP.

Sb3UpTFFaa	It sounds like you have a lack of salt intake, try adding salt to foods for the next few days, even have a spoon full of salt in your water.<br>  Salt helps prevent and stop cramping :)|`|eu6UQElYaa	I don't really have any ideas to prevent them, you could try eating a banana before bed for the potassium, but in pregnancy it's not as much about potassium deficiency as it is about fatigue to the muscles from carrying the extra weight and constriction of the blood vessels from an expanding uterus. However, I can tell you how to get rid of it quickly when it does occur.   When you start to get a leg/calf cramp, instead of trying to massage it out and drawing your leg up, stand up and press your foot flat against the floor.   It may feel like you are going to stretch the muscle too much but it doesn't and it actually works to break the cramp immediately.|`|MtC3CWZraa	You're probably potassium deficient. Drinking one glass of milk isn't going to solve it. You have to make sure you're consuming plenty every day.<br>  <br>  When I've had leg cramps in the night, I can usually get up and walk them off in less than a minute and then I'm fine.|`|claUGpVRaa	I am 39 weeks and have been experiencing this lately too. Apparently it means you haven't enough salt in your diet! (I know, I was trying to be careful of salt too!!) <br>  Drink a small glass of tonic water every day as it contains quinine which is good for helping cramp. That has helped me a lot.<br>  Also, try Andrews salts in packets as this apparently increases your salt intake just a little. <br>  One tip - when you get cramp, turn your foot up flat and the pain goes away a bit quicker. Good luck.|`|OJFz0LBZaa	i suffered with cramps and milk really did work but you have to drink more than a glass though, i now drink  a pint a day and have not had the cramps for weeks now, but i do know how pain full it can be, when my friend told me it was due to lack  of calcium i thought it was a joke, but looks like its true|`|f0cca0ad4ddd30e4eee3d909c0fdef5faa	As a former Soccer player, I've dealt with a lot of cramps.

M1gL4Jd6aa	Ekk, I know how you feel.  I'm nearly 40 weeks and it has only been the past two weeks that time has started to drag for me. IT's my second pregnancy, so I'm kind of used to it I guess.<br>  <br>  I've been going out nearly every day.  Meeting friends before I can't manage anymore.  Went to two movies.  Now I'm up at night most nights not able to sleep as the baby is moving so much and I'm so uncomfortable with bhs, so I go on this site and answer people's questions which is lots of fun!<br>  <br>  It pays to keep busy especially if you go overdue, which I did last time by 9 days!|`|NpFmdjlvaa	im 34 weeks and im soooo fed up !!! :( <br>  this is my 2nd pregnancy and its been horrible and it just feels like its dragging now! im constantly being sick and heartburn is unbearable!!<br>  i just want her out now!!<br>  you lucky baby is engaged as it means it wont be long til he or she is here!!<br>  <br>  good luck and congrats <br>  <br>  :)|`|1K0n0Sk8aa	i am 6 days overdue and its really starting to drag now, i feel really huge and im aching all over its getting hard work now lol, i have a 7 year old autistic daughter to care for as well so she keeps me busy and the time passes, but now im overdue its constantly in my mind now that i could go into labour at any time, and the constant guessing games that everyone is playing also passes the time ha ha ha|`|O5WberWnaa	ohhh ive had enough lol<br>  im 32wks and im tierd,i hurt,cant sleep,bh,shooting pains in my moo-moo,<br>  but i know when she comes il miss her bieng inside x
lTkYWiy5aa	Going to the gym is fine, and as long as you are consuming enough calories your diet is also fine. Taking a prenatal when ttc is important since you'll already be two weeks along when you find out you are pregnant. Some women only avoid alcohol during their two week wait, the two weeks from ovulation to your expected period (when they might be pregnant). If you are having the occasional glass of wine, I wouldn't worry about it.<br>  <br>  Good luck and baby dust!!!|`|yV373JUiaa	GYm is fine while trying to conceive. You should be eating healthy serving sizes of good foods while trying to get pregnant. You should also go out and invest in some prenatal vitamins to start taking. (many women start prenatal up to three months before trying to conceive, but starting the same month you start trying shouldn't hurt) <br>  <br>  you and your partner should refrain from smoking, and alcohol as they cause damage to the reproductive tract in women and the sperm count in men.|`|Sz7cnFRsaa	Some people say that drinking and smoking wont help in getting pregnant, I don't drink and neither does my partner but my parnter smokes and he is trying to cut it out but he is doing quiet well. You can carry on the way you are becuase it shows that you are fit and healthy. I have started to eat fruit, veg every day not every other day, milk and bread, I don't like eating any of them but I am doing well to stick at it. I would not change your routine to much because your body wont cope with the changes. I walk every day to the shop and back. You should be taking folic acid to help prepare your body. I would either cut the achole out or cut down if you drink quiet a lot. Google is a great place to resaearch and you could also look in books or mags they are great for resource. If you have been trying for 6 months or over then it would be a good idea to get checked out, if there is a problem they will be able to help. I have endrotimios and I only found out last year. I am now on Clomid first round so I am hopeing this works first time. You can also buy ovolating tests, temputure first thing in the morning or learn to under stand your body to when you should ovolate. My monthly cycles is great for knowing when your periods are due and when you should ovolate. Good luck and hope this helps.|`|oiJITSNZaa	PLEASE I plead with you! If you cannot give up alcohol for a couple months than don't try to become pregnant. Within minutes of alcohol intake you small baby's level is as high as yours. If you value your alcohol more than your baby's life, then don't even think of conceiving. Trust me I've sen the results far too many times and it ain't pretty.|`|GEfpzUNvaa	my girlfriend works out like crazy and she is pg and her dr said keep it up.. just nothing to heavy or what not she plays softball and everything.. her body is use to it and whatever so just confirm with your dr and good luck..** baby dust to you**|`|Y3DR1EBUaa	u can carry on at gym unless ur doc says not too<br>  alcohol u need to stop<br>  & depends on how much u are eatting
AA10196172	This sounds like those questions... "I have this friend, and I - I mean she..."<br>  <br>  But seriously, it's good to help out a friend like this. As everyone else says, it's totally her decision. Don't let her wreck her life to make someone else happy. Don't bring a baby into this world if it's going to have an unhappy and miserable life.<br>  <br>  My thoughts:<br>  If she's 35 and not ready, when does she think she will be? She's got 5 to 10 years, tops, to try a second time. Is there something magic (say, career-wise) that will happen in the next 5 years at which point she can say "ready!"? <br>  <br>  Is she putting it off because of career? I don't think there's a company in the English-speaking world that would hesitate to dump any employee over the side when the urge strikes them. No career is worth forgoing family. Imaging if you were 45, put off a family because the company needed you for this, that project, etc. always more urgent this next 6 months than maternity leave - then they said "sorry, we went broke in the market, you're laid off"?<br>  <br>  The father wants to keep the child. What does that mean? He wants to live with her in her nice house, or he'll take the child on weekends, or he'll drop in and visit when the urge strikes? How serious is this guy - or is he another person getting close to 40 and realizing this could be his last shot at reproducing? Does he have the income to pay child support? My impression of London is "expensive!".<br>  <br>  Does she see herself with the guy - or even wanting to talk to him - for 18 years? What may be appealing for tonight are not the qualities for a stable relationship. That's why there are so many single moms.<br>  <br>  If she has a child and gives it up - even if she thinks that is what she wants - will she be happy in 10 or 20 years? What would her friends think (what would you think?) about a healthy, well adjusted, financially stable 35yo who suddenly returns to work no longer pregnant and no child to look after?<br>  <br>  Is it a stress and fear of inadequacy problem? Everyone suddenly faced with this has panic attacks of "I don't know what to do with a child" or "how do I know I'll be a good parent"? Basically, everyone figures it out and muddles through, and the majority of parents, like the majority of children, turn out alright. <br>  <br>  If it's a money issue, well, a lot of parents probably get by on less than what she has, if she actually owns a house in London. (Unless it's a really tight balancing act to meet the mortgage!). But, that's why fathers pay child support.<br>  <br>  So - tell her good luck, think hard, and decide. Then don't spend the next 20 years regretting and second guessing your decision.|`|ftMjmp8Eaa	all i can say is that a child is a big blessing, if she didnt want to get pregnant then why didnt she protect herself? like u said she is 35 in a few years when she is ready to have a child she probably will have trouble because of her age, <br>  <br>  NOBODY HAS THE RIGHT TO KILL A HUMAN LIFE,,,  <br>  <br>  i struggled to get pregnant after having 2 miscarriages i just think she should be responsible for her actions.|`|stD14wWaaa	Wow, she's already old to be a first-time mum and she's still not ready for it? Maybe she'll be ready at 50.<br>   It's very irresponsible for a person to be pregnant and kill her baby because if she's not ready for it, there are lot of ways to prevent it, so why didn't she take care? And now it's already there, so the poor innocent little one will be deprived of the right to live. Oh my God I could really see this people burn in hell.|`|AaY0Xmduaa	I guess sarah can make her own decisions its her life and she is a grown women. If she feels that she is not ready to be a mum. Maybe next time she should use protection, and she wouldn't end up in this situation.|`|ytGaDM7Haa	How can you consider killing the child especially if he or she is wanted by the father? That is wrong.|`|SVwsRUIUaa	I was 15 when I got pregnant with my daughter, her daddy left me when I was 3months pregnant. 7months later I gave birth to a beautiful baby girl, and I'm now expecting my second by him. She brought us back together and gave me the family I've always dreamed of, we are getting married in november.<br>  <br>  My point is I had my daughter when I was 6weeks away from being sixteen. Yeah, my life was turned but not upside down, for once it was right side up. She is my world! If a 15 year old can do it, so can your friend. And if your friend doesn't want her baby and would feel guilty to abort. Since many women her age have trouble getting pregnant, She should give the baby up for adoption. To someone who appreciates the baby.. Instead of killing it.|`|g27LbLQsaa	I don't know the circumstances in details so hard to say. It does sound a little selfish purely because she isn't ready or prepared for motherhood. Especially when it takes two people to make the baby and the father is willing to be supportive and part of the childs life. <br>  If there is no health risk to the child or mother, if there is no rape or underage issues then an abortion for convenience seems unnecessary and not really a mature decision for someone who is mature enough to have unprotected sex in the first place. <br>  I do beleive in a woman's right to choose when it comes to abortion but the circumstances seem like it is abusing the proceedure. <br>  There are other avenues available to her if she has the baby she can offer it for adoption and there are also support networks if she was to keep it.<br>  I think it would be a difficult situation to be in. Stress can not be good for her whatever her decision so hopefully you are able to offer the support she needs. Good luck|`|o5jSID4Jaa	I would say to think very long and hard before she decides to have an abortion. The dad wants this baby. He could raise it or she could put it up for adoption. I also had a huge shock when I found out I was pregnant with my 3rd baby. My husband and I weren't even sure if we would ever want another baby. Our daughter is 6 wks old now and I thank my lucky stars everyday that she is in our lives. I can't imagine life without her!|`|0BeWgkpkaa	At 35 i think your friend should really consider having this baby! i know looking at it now might feel like it would turn her life upside down but she would adjust. This could definitly be her last shot and not many women have their one night stand offering to be there for them! If she never ends up having a baby she will live to regret her abortion and will ALWAYS look back and wonder what could have been!<br>  <br>  This is coming form personal experience and although i'm only 25 and have plenty of time to have more babies, I regret it every minute of every day! I put myself first instead of my baby...biggest mistake of my life!|`|pvH3oHRfaa	I would say, honestly honestly, KEEP IT.<br>  <br>  Not because I'm on some sort of abortion = murder rant, but because I honestly think she could regret her decision if she aborts it.<br>  <br>  Firstly, it sounds as though she is financially stable, she owns her own house, so she wouldn't have to worry about that.<br>  <br>  Secondly, the father sounds alright. He's encouraging her to go ahead (which is rare) and suggests that he'll be there always to support her.<br>  <br>  Thirdly, she's 35. A woman. Not a teenager who has made a sill mistake, but a grown woman who can deal with having a baby.<br>  <br>  And most of all, who knows if she'll ever have this chance again? She's not in her twenties. After 35, the risks to mother and baby are greatly increased, and your chances of getting pregnant become less and less. <br>  <br>  There's every chance that everything will fall into place, and it could be the best thing that ever happened to her. Does she really want to run the risk of never having the chance again? <br>  <br>  That's my honest opinion. I accidentally got pregnant when I thought it was not convenient. I felt that my relationship wasn't stable, and really thought I wouldn't be able to do it. However, I kept my baby, my relationship is now *fantastic* and we're engaged. Having my daughter was the best thing that ever ever ever happened to me. The thought of not having her makes me sick. Sometimes these things are just meant to be.|`|HclKftzAaa	she's 35... if she leaves it much later, it might not ever happen. Has she considered that maybe this is the path her life is SUPPOSED to take?<br>  <br>  She liked the guy enough to sleep with him before she got pregnant, so, maybe he is long-term material. Particularly if he's the type of guy to step up to his responsibilities! Maybe he WILL marry her one day.<br>  <br>  I think she should think long and hard about all this. Sure, she's shocked and scared at the moment, but maybe after she gets used to the idea, it wont seem so bad.|`|0WYzUsjMaa	if she wants a baby she might as well keep this one, she is 35 and the longer she leaves it to have a baby the harder its gonna be and she may have problems with the pregnancy.<br>  <br>  If she doesnt want the baby at least have the baby and give it to someone who is gonna love the baby|`|e1122490267c2903bd14e9cbbfe2af5daa	Then she should let the father take care of the baby. There are so many people who can't have kids, that would make great parents. Abortion is something she'll have to live with the rest of her life.|`|P4LBygv2aa	my husband never wanted children , it was fine with me as I had a son who was 12 years old , so I felt as though I was done, and I was going through the change any way , we both had great jobs a house and were very comfortable in our life.<br>  low and behold a little surprise came our way, I was pregnant at 40 !<br>  we decided if we weren't far along we would abort , but I was 15 weeks so it was too late , and I am so grateful now , even though we have had our world turned upside down and money is tight as I had to go part time ( day care is way too much) she is the best and most wonderful gift , I look at her and say to myself , thanks sweetie for sneaking up on us , I cant imagine my life without her . and Daddy ?<br>  he feels the same way .<br>  when I was 17 , I had and abortion , it haunts me to this day.|`|WvWFmwQoaa	well to be honest she wont know if she has done the right thing, there is no wrong or right thing to do really because its not my life so im not effected by her decision only she can know if she has don't the wrong or right thing. im not one for abortions however i don't believe in having a baby for the wrong reasons and having one if you can not afford it also i strongly believe that NO one should have a baby if there is no father but that is my opinion and everyone will have a different one towards the whole abortion thing. there is not much i/we can help her with it is all her choice and what ever she does she will have to live with weather she chooses to keep her baby or not.<br>  i would like to know why she risked having a baby when she didn't want one how irresponsible of her.
oiJITSNZaa	The earliest you can test is around the day of your period. It is too soon for the symptoms to be symptoms of being pregnant. Usually these symptoms do not appear till another month minimum. Most likely it is side affects of the clomid. At least these have been my experience while on several rounds of Clomid.|`|pOwOYqhEaa	get a few tests from the dollar store and take one everyday. All my test came from the dollar store and they worked great. It wont cost you that much money and will give you peace of mind.<br>  <br>  GL and BabyDust|`|YUudOvk1aa	I i were you I would take the test NOW!!! Plus sometimes they can get it wrong, so take more than one test. If your really worried, go see a doctor, plus it seems as though you re doing all you can to get pregnant, and your time will come! good luck Xxx

Rosabella is pretty too|`|M1gL4Jd6aa	I like Rosebella.  I presume you are prounouncing it Rosa-bella, is that correct?  Rose-bella might be a little more difficult to pronounce.

bTXsr5JWaa	That's what I've been getting and I'm fine, so I'm sure it's OK.|`|eu6UQElYaa	I had period like cramps off and on for about the first 8 weeks of my pregnancy.  It's normal to get them one day and not get them the next.|`|e1122490267c2903bd14e9cbbfe2af5daa	If you are having sharp pains you need the doctor to feel where the baby is, so you can make sure its not an ectopic. And there is a good chance that's it's not but you need to make sure. All pregnancies are different.
oiJITSNZaa	it isn't necessarily a sign of ovulation. it also can be a sexual arousal discharge or many other things I have found.|`|lTkYWiy5aa	It is possible for women to get egg-white cervical mucus (ewcm) at any time during their cycle besides when they are ovulating.|`|Sz7cnFRsaa	Some people ovoalte very different it depends on your period cycle and when you ovoalate. It is quiest common for some one to ovolate quite close to there period. Are you on any feritlity treatment i.e Clomid or soemthin because that could be another reason for it. I am on Clomid but swear that I have ovolated quiet a bit on them as I get this feeling or unless its my body playing tricks lol. As you are ovolating then baby dance and you ccould be pregnant when your period should come if thats what you want. Good luck.
AA12395149	Pregnancy makes different positions that were previously comfortable and very good, not so much anymore.  I can't be on top facing my husband at all.  Usually doggy style allows for deeper penetration than other positions, so it's likely that your guy is hitting the cervix.  If this is the case, it's best to just abstain from that position or go at it with more restraint (no slamming it in).  Try side lying or bringing your legs together with your rear towards him so he has more flesh to get through.<br>  <br>  Best of luck.|`|7OZQ7PqTaa	yes...i can hardly grin and bear it through doggie style...it's easier because of my large belly but definitely not enjoyable. I have to be on top to have sex these days and even that's not all that great...although I'm 40 weeks, not 17...|`|8EeVtXv9aa	If its hurting you hun then try another position which is more comfortable for you im sure you partner wont mind as you are having his baby. if there was any blood involved and further pain, go visit your doc just incase, all the best hun :) x|`|AaY0Xmduaa	its normal i wouldn't worry about it. Maybe you can change the position. Try it on the side that might feel more comfortable..|`|5nfqY9T7aa	Then don't do it doggie style.  Find a more comfortable position you'll enjoy.|`|M1gL4Jd6aa	Yes your partner has to be careful.  Your pelvic floor does drop a bit when you are pregnant and so doggie style is probably not the best position as it is a deep penetrating one.  I suggest you get your partner to not go as deep or otherwise try other positions that you feel comfortable in, like woman on top so you can control it.|`|eTx3Nfd7aa	tell your partner to be more gentle or try a different position if its still uncomfortable then wait till baby born its not that far away|`|0v7Msiznaa	i would try a more comfortable position like spooning it might be more better and more comfortable|`|AcPq4Qd8aa	Yes and ever since ( 7 years ago ), but the docs keep saying theres nothing wrong! They are useless.|`|JDw1RDcaaa	ye so we just stopped doing it like thank

AA12395149	Your sister is right, it's a combo of the uterus starting to stretch out and the placenta implanting further.  As long as the pain isn't intense and you are not bleeding, you should be fine.  Discuss it with your doctor or midwife if you are still concerned.|`|M1gL4Jd6aa	It sounds quite normal to me.  I had a lot of stretching pains with my first pregnancy.  If you get any sharp pains on one side though I would go to the doctor, just to check everything is ok.  Sometimes it can mean an ectopic pregnancy.<br>  <br>  I'm sure what you are experiencing is fairly normal though.|`|e1122490267c2903bd14e9cbbfe2af5daa	If you are worried check with the doctor it's not ectopic.

pm2EeEgiaa	Based on your story, you did NOT do anything wrong.<br>  <br>  It's either you have a set of really bad and mean parents or you are just having feelings that you have bad and mean parents. Or that your parents have been really stressed lately.<br>  <br>  If they want you out of their house - then obviously, it is your parents who have the problem, and NOT you (don't they realie that you can do anything to stop being sick?!). One thing I can say though is that every parent would be proud to have you - a 3.5 GPA and a scholar in universities.<br>  <br>  Maybe you should go ask your doctor what other medications he can prescribe for your blackouts. Are you sure you have migraine? Your symptoms seem very much like transient ischemia syndrome (dizziness, blackouts, very brief episodic memory loss) - go to another doctor and ask for a second opinion.|`|ce6c419afbc798ea522d146d175fa1ccaa	You did nothing wrong.

I know that your are wounded deeply in your heart, particularly in the part of emotions. <br>  <br>  Trust me and obey my words and i am for sure your life will soon improve and you will enjoy it. Trust me because i never give words which are not from my heart. I like helping others and it really worked out several times and i helped a lot of people who were either stressed or confused or afraid.<br>  My words starts:<br>  Always keep your love to your sister and never lose it. You might wonder if i told you also love your mum, because even if she blamed you for something or was injustice still she is your mother. The most important thing is that, never blame your life or curse it, never wish something bad to you because no one knows her/his fortune or destiny. Try to rent a home i mean a flat some where away from them. One day they will miss you and they will realize what a precious gift they have lost.<br>  If you don't have enough money, than bear the pain and sooner or later you will find your rewards. Always have hope in this life. Try to rely on yourself. Don;t say( i am ought to go to a psychiatric to help me), always remember no one can diagnose you if you didn't have that hope and courage in your heart. As for your eye put an ice cube on it for 15-30 minutes twice in a day.<br>  Gain confidence, trust, hope and courage!(*_*)<br>  Whish you better life, My wishes and my greetings.|`|TQg7yubGaa	Wow, I have to say that your parents aren't doing right by you at all.  If your sick, there really is nothing you can do about it.  It sounds like you've gone to the doctor, and if that's the case and they haven't been able to help you make things better, that is not your fault.  <br>  Sometimes parents baby the other sibling because they know they can't take care of themselves.  My husband comes from a family like that.  His parents kicked him and I out of their house, because their daughter isn't responsible enough to be out on her own.  And she is 30 years old.  I would say your parents have the same problem.  They aren't coming across like they should, at all.  And honestly, maybe it wouldn't be a bad idea for you to move out.  You sound like you have your head on your shoulders, and I'm sure if you explained to an employer that you have those problems, that someone would work with you on it.  I get migraines too, and they are really hard to deal with.  I started controlling mine though.  I know what spurs me to have one and I do what I can to avoid those things.  Mine are food preservatives, stress, and lack of sleep.  It wouldn't have been better if you'd never been born.  You don't know what is going to happen in this life, or who your going to touch.  Try to just get through now.  You'll make it!!!!  Good luck!!!|`|qBFojHLMaa	there is probably more to the story then just your side of it. You are obviously a little jealous of your sisters treatment which is understandable. But have you ever stopped to think maybe they dont believe you? Maybe they think you are making all of this up for attention? maybe they think you are over dramatizing your "spells" or whatever you might call what happens?Does it ever feel like they dont believe you? Maybe they sigh when you start complaining about your head hurting? A lot of the times people with illness that arent killing them are taken for granted. Like someone with mental illness... you dont feel bad for someone with mental illness like you do for someone with cancer... so maybe thats the case. And they spent so much time and energy showing your sister that they want to help her and trying to keep her safe that they have nothing left to give. Which isnt necessarily right but it may help you understand them a little better if its true. Try and tone down any emotional outburst you may have if they make you angry, they might not be able to handle it bc of what your sister put them through. All you can do is agree to be the best you can be, dont take their stress personally, dont assume they love you less, and be careful what you say and how you say it. People can only handle so much, so although it might seem unfair to you, they might be at their breaking point of patience for everything they are going through too. Good luck, i hope I made sense.<br>  <br>  ***oh and just so you know I am going through something slightly similar. My mom babies my sister like theres no tomorrow and then throws all her stress on me. And Im at my limit, and I have to learn that she can only take so much just as I can only take so much. And just bc shes stressed does not give her the right to take it out on me. Just as your parents dont have the right to do it to you. But I am now working through my issues with my mom and I hope that what I said can help you too. Help you to realize that your not the only one feeling upset, most likely they are too. And if you can understand what they feel you can better help them understand what they are doing to you!
Iz5tNA5aaa	Good morning yourself!<br>  <br>  No, I don't think it's narcissistic.  We didn't say let's have 4 kids because we're such great people, but because we wanted a combination of both of us to raise.  Most narcissists wouldn't want children of their own as it would take the attention away from them.<br>  <br>  Have a good day!|`|DDFSITiYaa	There is a faction of people who feel parents are truly selfish as they are procreating themselves (on some deep level, everyone wants to live on in their children) and they are not seeing the greater good of the human race on this planet as it's problems with over crowding and such.  <br>  <br>  However, I would venture to say that *most* people do not think of things this deeply and simply have children out of love.  Nothing could be more selfless than dedicating yourself to raising a good human being. <br>  <br>  Good morning!|`|G9ywiLqvaa	it's evening here, but good morning to you just the same.<br>  <br>  nope, i don't think it's narcissistic.  because couples give birth to individuals.  each one different from the former, different from the next.  couples don't make clones of themselves, but they procreate new people--with a variety of personalities not exactly like theirs.  <br>  <br>  children, i would like to think, aren't carbon copies.  they would look like their parents in some ways, but they will always be their own person.|`|7aaceef242426e2a1e7394d78368ca77aa	I'm sure that a handful of people feel this way and yes those who have children for this reason most certainly have issues. But usually, I do not think many people do this. Having several kids can be due to many surprises, religion, and failed protection. I'm sure there are many other reasons out there.|`|HA8bxrLTaa	Hahahaha, OH I LOVE it! Reminds me of a guy I knew in h.s., who wanted to get as many girls pregnant to have as many boys as he could to name after himself...last I heard (which was years ago) he was up to 3 Waynes and the other 3 were girls...|`|3BwPtNi2aa	Good Mornin'<br>  Not necessarily - more like a lack of birth control.|`|57LFRfqCaa	Interesting but flawed.  What about animals/birds/fish who reproduce yearly?|`|X3rt9ivEaa	I dont know about narcissism, but I have met a couple of families with 5+ children where they think their children are the greatest things to walk the Earth no matter what they do. You try to reason with them and "oh no, there is no way Johnny and Isabelle took that shovel from your yard and used it to dig up Mrs. Goldenstein's flowers. I realize I have the only children on the block and there are little muddy footsteps by the scene of the crime, but my kids wouldn't do that!"<br>  <br>  EDIT: Of course that can go for parents with just one or two children too. But maybe some think their children are so great that they keep having more? The idea is a little abstract but could work, lol. Some just might want those big tight-knit families like they had back in simpler times.|`|cAtWxJG1aa	Good morning back.  As a parent of four, I can say without hesitation that my children are certainly not "more of me."  Thank goodness.|`|a8IRxC4raa	No, I don't..and I have one child.<br>  <br>  Children are not clones of parents.<br>  <br>  All the best.
eWjxwNucaa	As a teenager myself i seem to agree with what you are saying.<br>  <br>  Just because they may not have experiences and be able to see what others see as well doesnt mean our advice is not as good infact when it comes to other teens and childrens problems it can be better than an adults! Also I believe this is what also helps us help others (being inexperienced) <br>  <br>  Our views are just another viewpoint.|`|PxawVQ7Xaa	Stereotypes, child/ teens are suppose to be dumb so they it kind of humiliates them when a teen says something just as or even more intelligent than them, it's like a man getting embarrassed because a girl beat him in sports.<br>  <br>  What I find interesting that the teens tend to try to give good advice where as parents tend to get really insulting and patronizing about it and don't even answer the question.|`|d9b1447951374df512b15ee98c0bf39daa	The context is out of place... If you expect my daughter to help you with your suicidal thoughts Ill help you with suicide. She is not old enough to understand the thought process and emotions behind it. <br>  <br>  if you expect my daughter to help you understand why you have to take a bath... fine. <br>  <br>  So the issue comes in as to what the problem is. <br>  <br>  I have a huge issue with people on here asking medical questions and such. Its a matter of not getting the right answers from the right people.|`|VrFcZnZSaa	parent's and adults just doubt teens because the majority of them don't know if they are Marthe or author|`|JePAZQbMaa	according to the situation...this is clear that parents are very much worried about their teens future..<br>  <br>  but actually it is time..i.e. called Moratorium stage..where child is very much confused about her goals and their works.. They are not in a state to think about others and just wana be clear but enable to do so.<br>  <br>  This is not a weekness but a par of the cognition.|`|SnQvsOPwaa	In 20 years when you look back at some of the stuff you said and did and believed in. You will understand.|`|VUfT35UQaa	I am a teenager and when I see a question where someone needs help or is upset,  try to make them feel better too.<br>  <br>  It isn't fair that teenagers are stereotyped as self-absorbed.<br>  <br>  You don't need to be qualified to give good advice, because everyone can give good advice, like everyone can make good decisions.
8e5YBwd7aa	Im giving them the silent treatment there irritating creatures.<br>  I used to be best friends with my mother before my step dad came along.|`|pm2EeEgiaa	I'd say that we have a very good relationship. There are just some basic rules to maintain good parent-child relationship:<br>  <br>  The rule #1 is: Don't talk when both you and your parents are angry - unless you want a jungle out there.<br>  <br>  Rule # 2 is: If you don't have anything good to say, then better shut up!<br>  <br>  Rule # 3 is: Always show appreciation for the things which your parents do for you, like cooking or cleaning the house.|`|TXmAx8jwaa	I dont really understand what you mean at the end, <br>  But when i was much younger about 13 to 15 me and my mum used to argue alot, but yeah sometimes i just let her get on with yelling at me. because sometimes she was stressed or whatever, And i do talk around my parents, my mums like a close friend to me. im 17 now.|`|AA11296427	I talk to them a lot, my mom is my best friend, and my dad is my wall, he quite literally keeps me up.  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  :]|`|irnpklXpaa	i barely talk around them like this morning my mom was yelling at me telling me that i have to clean the whole upstairs and the bathroom downstairs and i was like yup ill do it and she just randomly yells at me. it does get very annoying. i just agree to everythign they say hope this helps|`|QrmCMbbdaa	say you'll kill yourself if you don't get your way<br>  hold your breath|`|gq5sfgE5aa	I'm part of that first 10%. I don't argue with my parents because what they say just has to be done...you just do what they say. My little sister (a year younger) is my best friend...and the other (who is 5) isn't that bad...when she is sleeping. My sister has more problems with my mom, she 'plays dumb' so then my mom gets mad and leaves her alone.|`|HJbZHS2uaa	Ever since my mom told me i looked like a slut, said my dad (biological) was a jerk that said he hates me, and when she got married i hate her to this very day.. I never have liked her

It means "mine" and just because a lot of people mispronounce it doesn't mean it's suddenly an accepted way to say it.
kxD35uB5aa	hi there, i feel your anxietey! my baby is 3 weeks old and im still paranoid that he will choke if he throws up (sometimes if he dosent bring up all his wind when i wind him he will vomit once in bed) but as of yet he has always thrown up to the side... so maybe they have a natural instinct to move their heads to the side if they are going to be sick when asleep...??? just a guess... im interested to see what others say|`|qjDxKXENaa	i have always known that sleeping on their back can choke them when they are a sleep. my daughter has also been sleeping on her tummy. if your baby is gassy baby then it always helps to sleep on their front. keep an ee on the baby. once they are able to move their head, they are ok. in UK, all midwifes says NO NO to front sleeping because of COT DEATH. I am sorry but i dont believe that, i have been brought up sleeping on my front, so as my brother. My daughter is now 6 months and she has been sleeping on her front from day one. they never mention the babies who died of choking in their sleep while sleeping on their front. it is more difficult to be sick when they sleep on their back.|`|iMaTMWMxaa	I still worry about it now when my children are poorly, and they are 5, 3 and nearly 2. I think as a mother you can worry about anything and everything. It's completely natural.<br>  <br>  As you say, you follow guidelines, and I do have to admit to all my little ones being tummy sleepers. My eldest particularly, would scream until I laid her on her side or tummy.<br>  <br>  If you have a monitor you should hear if they cough or are sick, so it may relieve your anxiety a little.<br>  <br>  The things that you worry about change as your children get older, but I doubt you'll ever stop worrying :)|`|LrBYeb6Aaa	i used to panic all the time with my girl who is now 7 month old, and i had two boys befor her, you are doing the right thing by sleeping her on her back, i dont think u need to stress as i have queried my doctor on numerous occasions and she said not to worry as that wont happen, i used to prop the head end of the cot or bassinett up just so she was on a little slant just in case. congrats on ur bubs and good luck sweety, baby will be fine.|`|1LdgTQodaa	hi.i know its a very anxious time at the moment.ive had five kids and ive been the same as you with all of them.you just keep thinking that thell choke or something will happen to them when there sleeping.but breastfeeding does reduce the amount of wind and bringing back up of milk.i breastfed the first 3 and they wernt really that sick,but with my last i had twins and because of that by the time they were 6 weeks i had to put them on the bottle as the midwives kept saying they wernt getting enough,and i can tell you they started puking all the time and just bringing it back up.so the fact that you are breastfeeding does help an awfull lot with that.and i didnt really need to wind mine at all when they were on the breast because they dont really take down the air like they do when theyre on the bottle,which meant that that they were hardly sick.also i always kept mine near to me throughout the day ,in view so if anything did happen i would be right there.i know some people will put their kids in a bedroom when thyre sleeping in the day but i never did ,they were always with me wether sleeping or not.this might help you if you are worried about things like that.also they were always in my bedroom at night right next to the bed.and i used to jump up at the slightest sound to check on them,i think it was just instinct when youve had a baby that you wake up suddenly if your hear things.so if you are worried just keep them with you and in a few months im sure as your baby gets older it will become much less of a worry.i hope this has helped you.and good luck.)

AA12395149	You don't need to orgasm to get pregnant, but they definitely do help.  When you orgasm your uterus and vaginal kind of convulse (it's sort of like helping it through).  If you don't orgasm from penetration much, try to get it as much as you can from foreplay.  Usually once you've had an orgasm with foreplay, you'll orgasm at least once with penetration (if not, use a mini vibe on the clit during coitus to help).  When you're done, put a pillow under your bottom or rest your legs up against the wall (you pretty much want a pelvic tilt) for at least 20 minutes.  This will also help those little guys get to where they're going.<br>  <br>  Best of luck and have fun!|`|z43ToeAyaa	it's not nessesary to orgasm,<br>  but my gp did say it did help.<br>  <br>  good luck honeyy,<br>  i really hope you get your baby!<br>  <br>  and its healthy etc<br>  <br>  best wishes<br>  <br>  xx|`|Sz7cnFRsaa	You dont need a orgasm to get pregnant not everyone will orgasm.

Though some articles have stated that it helps pull the sperm to the cervix.There has been no scientific study to back that up.|`|Xs0fhFJnaa	I'm lucky and always orgasm! But i don't imagine that's WHY i conceived.<br>  <br>  I think it's best to keep the fun in the baby making as much as you can - otherwise sex just becomes perfunctory and boring, and more like a chore than an expression of love, which is what a child should be.<br>  <br>  Have fun! ;)|`|pm2EeEgiaa	Yes. Orgasm definitely helps one to conceive.|`|8mchLCQhaa	No it doesn't matter if you orgasm or not. I don't through sex either and I have 1 kid and one on the way!|`|H9t63i4Kaa	It can help, but its not neccesary to conceive!!!<br>  Good Luck!!!
snUDfcfgaa	Can you miss something you haven't experienced?  Or maybe that's more like yearning for it. Yes I do, everyday.|`|xPgKWIigaa	Yeah definately - then i curse myself for thinking that when i  was actually pregnant - all i wanted then was for them to be born - i was so sick at the time - but i'll never forgive myself for that thought now - i miss my tummy!! Well at least then i had an excuse for it LOL|`|eD7qRBKHaa	Yes.  I don't want another baby so soon, but sometimes I definitely miss it.  Weird isn't it, that you can have so many aches and pains and heartburn and everything, but you still miss it.|`|XsmPnMU4aa	No I hated being pregnewt. Bartenders always gave me a funny look when I would order drinks while preggo. Wait I have never been pregnewt. Nevermind sorry.|`|T0gv52CDaa	Not at all!  My first pregnancy was easy and I loved every minute of it.  My last pregnancy was MISERABLE, and I am so glad that it is over and that my husband and I are satisfied with two kids.  I would love to adopt a daughter, but since he isn't on board with adoption, that wont be happening, and there is no way in the world I ever want to be pregnant again after the last time.  I'm just glad my baby (3 months old) is the sweetest baby in the world.  After the pregnancy, I was afrais that he would be as difficult on the outside as he was on the inside.|`|5ZvALiclaa	Yeah i do, all the time. I know i don't want to have another baby but being pregnant is so special...*sigh*...it makes me sad to know i won't ever get to experience it again but i had 3 wonderful pregnancies and 3 beautiful healthy children so i have a lot to be thankful for|`|KOwzDLPdaa	Yup! Especially the first month or so you really miss having the little kicks and punches from inside the tummy. Then you remember its time to get up and feed the baby because its three am :)|`|o5jSID4Jaa	I do sometimes. I just had my 3rd and last baby. Sometimes I get a little sad that I'll never be pregnant again.

My daughter is 14 months old and i still have that feeling sometimes. Almost makes me want to have another one lol.|`|1os95dHZaa	Just the pregnate part. I liked having an excuse for being fat!|`|DcYD9vWRaa	if you need help just let me know j/k lol|`|dLadxEJSaa	Honestly...I do miss the kicks. It was kind of cool knowing that no one else could feel him but me. I got babby all to my self for a while. <br>  <br>  But...that is not enough to convince me to have another one.|`|Btsctjydaa	Yes, but they haven't fleeted yet.
OT8TMTOHaa	Of course, that is how you get instain mothers who kill their babby.|`|b70c76c680f23b7b2d94815940d49450aa	Nope, but it appears it can affect your ability to spell.|`|AA11349925	How is Babby formed?<br>  <br>  How girl get pragnant?|`|692c8795f68a0ba95a0d09139d70c98caa	Yes a babby can make you go instain, ill pary for you.|`|57LFRfqCaa	Do you mean a "baby make you go insane?"  A new mother can develop post-natal depression.|`|KOwzDLPdaa	I'm sorry, you got a stain on something?|`|ygbhsZ2Zaa	Yes.<br>  <br>  I am sorry for my own lots and yours too.|`|dnG7fhnbaa	What's a babby and what's instain? Answer me that and I'll answer your Q...|`|XsmPnMU4aa	Of course you go instain. I didn't go instain though until my babbies got to age 2 though.
AA12395149	You'll be fine.  There's nothing you could do about it now anyway, the food is already coursing through your digestive tract.  Just try and read up on things you should and shouldn't eat from now on.  Don't stress if you come across things you have, Everything will probably be fine.<br>  <br>  what to expect when you're expecting and pregnancy.com are favorites of mine.|`|f8240cd0e6b54863a050b702a65c786caa	What a load of cr@p. Why shouldn't you eat it? By the way, if you try to hang up washing you will strangle the baby.|`|sbfm5rCAaa	Anything in small quantities is fine so don't worry. Just avoid it next time.|`|M1gL4Jd6aa	You'll be fine.  It is just if you eat a lot of it all the time as it is very high in vitamin A.  There is nothing to worry about - just avoid it from now on.|`|NpFmdjlvaa	youl be fine just dont eat it all the time!!<br>  back in the day they used to tell you to eat liver!! but theyv changed it now!! i love the stuff and dying to have liver bacon n mash... only few more weeks to go then i can enjoy that without feeling bad about having it !!<br>  <br>  congrats <br>  <br>  :)|`|xYHyTJY9aa	I ate liver during my pregnancies and there is nothing wrong with me or any of my kids.   In fact I craved it.|`|GjuRYsITaa	i think cooked liver is ok its just pate that you cant have|`|g27LbLQsaa	why can't you have it what happens?
J6LKqBqMaa	My son is 8 months old  <br>  He is not on food other then breast milk<br>  He has his third tooth coming through<br>  He can say da da dad, tee for tree <br>  He sits up ok<br>  Can get any place but doesn't crawl<br>  Blow a kiss<br>  sniff at you<br>  sounds like both sons are about the same on levels|`|LrBYeb6Aaa	sounds like he's doing great for his age, i have a 7 month old and she is just learning to try and sit unaided, i have 3 kids, my first learnt quickly my second took for ages to reach milestones, and my youngest is going ok. i think all babies are different, doesnt make em any smarter or dumber then other babies, my baby is learning to crawl but she cant hold her bottle where as my friends baby was holding a bottle at 4 months and crawled at 9 months, so each baby is different, dont stress|`|ygbhsZ2Zaa	My son will be 8 months on the 2 March.<br>  He's 20 pounds exactly (as of three days ago). <br>  Babbles, repreats sounds ("echos" me)<br>  Sits alone, crawls, pulls himself up, cruises, stands alone, starting to take steps independantly (NOTE that that's really early, my other babies have all walked at around 10  months- this one just has it in for me LOL)<br>  Just popped through bottom two teeth, top two are coming through now.<br>  Eats *small* pieces of banana, avacado, broken cheerio, rice, tofu. <br>  Reaches for items<br>  Uses pincer grasp successfully<br>  drinks from a cup<br>  <br>  Your son and mine are about 2-3 weeks different in age, I guess- your son is completely normal and fine. Did you know most babies don't crawl- truly "all fours" crawl- until around 8 months?  I know the ped. said my son is 'clinically precocious', meaning if you put them in a room with 100 other babies, perhaps 1-2 others will be as active and doing as much- yours is I have no doubt right up there in the top percentile as far as development- but on the other hand, they will all do just about everything in their own time- I have a 22 month old who still doesn't talk much at all (but clearly understands everything said to her) and I'm pretty sure she's no dummy either! (well, she's figured out how to open the walk-through baby gates...   :)<br>  Whether he never crawls, walks at 7 months or 15 months, and eats only baby rice or small finger foods- chances are eventually he'll be right on par with his peers. Relax, don't let another mother, especially with such an age difference (in early infancy through about 2 years old, 3 months is a BIG difference!), drive you crazy.
79eRDIbXaa	Yes that is Normal <br>  Nausea is a side effect of pregnancy|`|gTiQLYCZaa	yep its normal, its all the hormones raging through your body that do it|`|66AlfbWiaa	Yes it's normal, it's called "morning sickness", but sounds like it's all day sickness for you. Try drinking or sipping a dark cola, the carmel flavoring wil help coat your stomach. I have four daughters and I had it all day with the first one for the first 4-6 weeks. Sounds like you may be having a girl, for some reason my daughers never had it with their sons. Good luck to you.|`|h5cFkP35aa	very normal. i'm 32 weeks and still suffering from nausea. they even checked my gallbladder by ultrasound and did find stones, that may have been your problem as well.|`|8eb3b233aef711e6c66be9d2f17d46b2aa	yes totally normal...and no it doesn't happen just in the morning so i don't know why in the world they call it morning sickness. lol|`|GEfpzUNvaa	totally normal.. congrats.. and good luck|`|J6LKqBqMaa	Welcome to mother hood :>)
Sz7cnFRsaa	There is hope out there for everyone to get pregnant, my husband had ok sperm, but anti bodys in his sperm, I got pregnant, but I lost them, they would have been 2 this year, so if I can then you can, it will just take time , I am on Clomid and I am on my first round of it so I am praying that it works for me. Keep baby dancing it it will happen. Except all the help you can get, it is worth it, I think I am pregnant but I dont want to keep my hopes up and I am due on next week. I will keep my fingers crossed for you and keep you in my prays. Good luck.|`|Bhy4k9wPaa	My husband was told some years ago, before we were together, that his sperm was 'sluggish' (what a word...). This was before he had to have a testicle remoed due to testicular cancer. He still went on to conceive a daughter with his ex and a son with me, so yes, it does happen! Lots of practice needed so get your man into the bedroom!!!|`|cc9fd1e80d4f3f3e0531c81601acf1d6aa	Well i guess 10 % means he has to try 10 times. <br>  Uh well IVF is always an option. All the best.
OI3bf4yjaa	When I was pregnant.. when I first woke up I ate a few crackers and then I would rest for a little bit. Don't lie down right after eating, and eat small meals. I would recommend eating cold foods instead of hot foods. (Cold food doesn't usually smell as strong as hot foods). I found that sniffing a lemon or ginger relieved my upset stomach, and/or eating salty potato chips.<br>  <br>  Some foods that you can eat to help relieve the nausea could be anything salty like chips or pretzels, anything tart/sweet like pickles, lemonade, anything earthy like brown rice, mushroom soup, peanut butter, anything crunchy like celery sticks, apple slices, nuts, and anything dry like crackers. As for liquids you can try drinking juice, seltzer, sparkling water or ginger ale.<br>  <br>  Hope this helped!|`|BUI9HnH1aa	for me .. it was a cup of tea .. it always seemed to settle it down a bit <br>  but if i got to hungry the nausea would come back with a vengance.<br>  So dont let urself get hungry ..|`|AA10636233	Ginger. I kept a baggie of crystallized ginger with me all the time in my purse. When the nausea hit, I would just take a piece and chew on it slowly. It really helped a lot. I know some people say ginger ale, but most modern ginger ale does not even contain ginger. If you prefer it, you could eat ginger snap cookies (after checking the label to be sure their is actually ginger in it). I know that some of those vitamin stores sell ginger tablets for pregnant ladies, but I just couldn't hope to swallow those, they were ten times worse than my prenatal vitamins!<br>  With my second pregnancy I was vomiting multiple times per day, and the ginger helped if I could eat it soon enough. With my other two pregnancies, I almost never threw up thanks to the ginger, and the fact that they were both girls! LOL|`|AA10982164	Ginger has been proven to help many women with morning sickness. You can get ginger snaps, or some health food stores carry ginger candy.<br>  <br>  Allowing your stomache to get completely empty will make it worse, so eat small amounts frequently during the day. <br>  <br>  Many women find relief sucking on hard candy, some do better with saly things. Try different things to see what works best with you, then keep what ever helps handy at all time.<br>  <br>  If this is any consolation, most women stop having morning sickness by about 12 weeks, so there is a light at the end of the tunnel.  Be sure you drink plenty of fluids, even if you have to drink very small amount every 15 to 20 minutes to keep it down.|`|jYPeis3Saa	i had absolute horrible morning sickness with my son. i mean all day every day. <br>  what some times worked was to eat a snack every 2hrs. along with regular breakfast, lunch and dinner meals. <br>  <br>  i found that if i didn't have something to snack on it made the nausea and throwing up that much worse. <br>  <br>  if you like ginger try sucking on a fresh piece of ginger. or try eating some saltine crackers before you get out of bed in the morning. although none of that worked for me, it may work for you.|`|Jcz29H2Oaa	dry crackers, or pretzels... drink water|`|eTS2nd70aa	I would try eating dry crackers ( or toast if you don't have crackers, although toast is a bit heavier ) and drinking ginger ale. <br>  <br>  I'm not pregnant or anything like that (I'm only 16), but I have a chronic stomach condition that leaves me nauseas/queasy a lot of the time, and the above does help.<br>  <br>  EDIT: Actually, now that I think about it, peppermint is supposed to be very good for quelling nausea as well...so you can always try sucking on peppermint candies.|`|mFQydvncaa	as soon as you wake up start eating, crakcers dry toast anything bland, as long as you keep something in your stomach you should see some change in sickness, they also have nasua pops, and my doctor gave me a prescription for finnegan, it is a life savor and it helps you sleep! And is pregnant safe!!!! ask your doctor i was always way to sick to eat.<br>  <br>  well goodluck and congrats|`|DjlKqGDCaa	well sour skittles seems weird so i would try it lol it might help because of the sour stuff... but ya hahaha good luck! get better! :)|`|IdoZbO39aa	Gingerbeer!|`|cnDCq1tvaa	Chips and salsa|`|pxFGEaTpaa	take lemon tasting food stuff or take fresh lemon.|`|4b7808b550192ac7ad93353a410ef2e4aa	eat somme sour skittless <br>  <br>  i proomise you it will help alot!!!!!!!!!!|`|d0fc65f726f4bd56a6ce4f789ee11991aa	Try chewing on crushed ice. That always helps. <br>  good luck. :]
NosXQLYYaa	Bueno Aizicat pues si estás decidida me alegro mucho por tu decisión y que todo salga como esperas, lo que cuentas del sangrado es que a veces cuando te va a venir aunque estés embarazada salen los restos que quedaron dentro por eso se puede sangrar y creer no estar embarazada y si estarlo, de hecho casi todas las embarazadas sangran y se asustan por esto, a mi hermana le pasó y me llamó le comenté que era normal que su cuerpo estaba limpiandose de restos anteriores y así fue, bueno con lo que salga en el test nos dices, aquí nos tienes esperando.<br>  <br>  <br>  .Aizi ?qué pasó al final?, fijaté que en pocos días me entero que mis 2 hermanas están esperando un bebé, la veterinaria de mis gatos también y ahora solo queda saber si tú también, no dejes de contarlo porfi, te deseo suerte en esto.|`|VZRRCa3Kaa	Me alegra q pienses q estas embarazada...y te felicito si de resultar positiva lo unico q no me agrada son esos sangrados q has tenido debes de ir al medico....pero un buen embarazo se logra con optimismo desde el principio asi q suerte y q te valla bonito<br>  bye|`|Vrh1qPXMaa	hola lo primero que debes de hacer es hacerte una prueba casera, despues dependiendo del resultado te aconsejo que vayas con un ginecologo, ya que si no estas embarazada  podrias tener algun cambio hormonal y entonces es cuando se empienza a complicar el asunto, pero por tus signos todo parece indicar que lo estas...disfrutalo y muchas felicidades!!!|`|xEE398Lmaa	muchisima suerte ni?a.........es la mayor de las bendiciones y espero que tengas esa dicha .<br>  Que Dios bendiga a las mujeres como tu que tienen su corazon lleno de amor ..........|`|1pAh9vhRaa	hola amiga solo puedo decirte "FELICIDADES" de seguro k si estas embaraza x lo k kuentas  es probable k si te deso lo mejor y sabes k traer un hijo  mundo es lo mas bonito k dios nos pudo dar|`|2cff7a59eb14ebe2a7543f05f980fa50aa	Me alegro mucho, tomes la desición que tomes te deseo toda la suerte del mundo.

Adorable. (I actually don't have an opinion, I'm just saying that because that's what you want to hear.)|`|B1xrI9ZYaa	He is Adorable|`|xoJcx0rFaa	awhh yes he is!|`|AOvtRBU9aa	yes and you are very pretty also.|`|TIsgCnhkaa	I'm going to go with no.|`|b640775ccf3ad91701f500707df78aefaa	sooooo Cute God bless him lol|`|OI3bf4yjaa	Adorable|`|n3PE2lvDaa	ohh he sure is! Hes lucky to have such a good big sister too.
BUOJJpaCaa	Totally normal.<br>  I lost my virginity when I was 16.|`|RoTLnFGZaa	oh my god, get her to the doctor!<br>  no high schoolers are having sex! everyone is waiting til marriage, these days.<br>  goshhhh! what is wrong with her???<br>  I'd be embarrassed if my sister was a S.L.U.T. too!!<br>  i'm going to pray for your sister.|`|jTaW3goeaa	yep, most do.  Some do it at a younger age than that|`|xhnvAqDwaa	Yep, a lot of people do and some even before that. its up to the person and if there ready and sure it's what they want.Don't be to shocked babe if it makes you feel better there are people having sex and the age of 13. Im sure you sister wasn't doing anything stupid.
kaqPSgTVaa	Go see your doctor. How long is a while ago? If you had your baby within the last few months then that is why you haven't had a period. It can take a while to get it back. If it's been longer and you've had periods after your baby but skipped two periods (and still got negatives) it's likely something besides pregnancy. See your doctor.|`|uIAHkm0Naa	LOLOLOL why did you say hehehehehe?<br>  that make me crack up!!! im still laughing!!|`|vQtRmZETaa	I took 4 different test and they all said no but a week after taking the last test and period still did not show up, I went to the doctor and he gave me a test and I was. Sometime you can't trust the over the counter test you have to go to the doctor. hope i helped|`|ksuXZ5gRaa	If the tests said No and you didn't have your baby that long ago then it could definitely still just be your hormones balancing out. Wait until next month and it you're still unsure go to the doctor. I hope you get the results you want!|`|mFQydvncaa	hehehehe, you sound like you dont care if you are or not. If you tool 3 and they say no then i say no, if you want to know for sure take a blood test
bKfAte8aaa	It sounds as though she's unsure about the abortion as well. Keep in mind- abortion is not the only way that this can be handled.  She can always give the child up for adoption- there are sooo many people who are not able to have children who would love to have one. This way the both of you won't have a negative experience on your mind (an abortion) and you can still enjoy your lives and go to school, etc.|`|AA10948829	Go to the clinic with her, don't try to persuade her to do otherwise, and be there for her. It's her body and her life that's going to be impacted the most and your job is to go along with what she wants. Trying to make her feel guilty, trying to tell her she's doing the "wrong thing," and doing anything other than being a supportive "yes ma'am".<br>  <br>  And be more careful next time! Before you have sex with *anyone* you should seriously sit down and discuss what you'll do in the case of a pregnancy so you don't have to even worry about conflicted feelings.|`|AA11707728	You shouldn't "support" her.  What she is doing is wrong and incredibly selfish.  And quite frankly her opinion of you is incredibly low.  You are in a bad place with this woman.  On the one hand, babies are important.  That's YOUR child she is about to kill.  However, our society doesn't allow you any power to do anything about it.  You could try talking to her parents.  But that brings up the other problem.  This woman really thinks of you as some loser not worth her time and cares nothing for you, her child, let alone being a good wife to you.  She's a pathetic wretch you really would be better getting away from as soon as possible.  Trouble is, you have a baby with her.<br>  <br>  If it was me, I would confront her parents and make at least some attempt to force the situation into an acceptable outcome.  Who knows, maybe with enough discipline, she might actually get her act together and be a decent human being with a good life together with you.  But, if she has that abortion it does two things.  It releases you from all responsiblity to her.  She is scum and you owe her nothing.  And it also proves that she is a callous, evil woman that will bring you nothing but pain.  And the best thing would be to get rid of her.  Just change your phone number and never speak to her again.<br>  <br>  Find someone who isn't "too good" for you.  And cares about people and family instead of some worthless career she'll just fail at anyway.|`|dSobv28maa	A baby is a gift.<br>  <br>  You need to talk to her about it.<br>  She can always go to school once the baby is born.<br>  You need to get a good job and save every penny you can.<br>  Maybe apply for food stamps or the Wic program<br>  <br>  Try to convince her not to get an abortion.<br>  If her parents wouldnt support her, would yours?<br>  Maybe have her live with you?<br>  Are you guys in a serious relationship?|`|PymLdXM8aa	dont support her.... im sorry but this is just one of the few issues where the whole "i'll support you no matter what" shouldn't stand. If you really dont want her to get one fight it. There's always a little thing called adoption. Gl and good for you!|`|13uErtdtaa	screw her parents. Tell them the truth and don't get the abortion. Which is more valuable, having her parents dislike you or her being miserable and depressed for the rest of her life?|`|yxRORP41aa	If you don't want it to ruin your life, and neither does she, and you two are in no position to raise a child, then I say an abortion is your best option. You should support her decision no matter what one she makes because shes your girlfriend and she is the one who has to carry the child.|`|mFQydvncaa	babys are blessings, i believe dads have rights too!! tell her family, if they dont approve why are yall together anyway??<br>  <br>  i say this has to be dealt with, and she can always give you the child or put the baby up for adoption!!!!|`|CmSpH1ANaa	There's nothing wrong with an abortion, you can have children once you are finished with school. :) <br>  <br>  Please read up on abortion at the Planned Parenthood and Scarleteen websites, you'll feel better about things.|`|BbBPxH9Maa	Hi you must be in a dilema but what you have to know is that a baby is a gift to be cherished that many would wish to have but can't due to circumstances like arbortion.You have got to accept the fact that the pregnancy has occured and you should to to see the baby born.Let me tell you something that happened to a close friend of mine who was in the same situation like you.This girl gets pregnant and decides to abbort but what happenedd is that she got a ruptured uterus and then had to go 7 operations as a result of complications(Septic blader which had to be removed,she also developed peritonitis and went in to a coma.Now all this time her parents thought she was at campus studying but on being called to hospital her dad collapsed and the mum went mute at the site of her daughter and worst of all she past away last week.So please do not let the same hapen to you two.Talk to her parents and inform your parents too it may be hard but it is better than loosing life.
SVwsRUIUaa	All you girls who say you wont do that, and Moms have a choice what to do with their own body. They also have to right to keep their legs closed. Why murder an innocent baby? No you girl's wouldn't understand, your moms let you live. Thank God for that right..<br>  <br>  Pro life (mother of 2)|`|hpnZ8awvaa	I agree with Aqua. Its not really any of your business who gets abortions.. They will never make it illegal to get an abortion, because then so many more teens ever younger than 15 will be having kids, when they really shouldn't cause they can't support them in any way, and if you just say 'oh, they can just put it up for adoption' and what not, please, there is already too many kids that need to be adopted, and not all of them get adopted, its unfair on the child.<br>  <br>  Sometimes abortion is for the better.|`|QXL3LFQYaa	Great idea. Is that the same address if you live outside America? <br>  <br>  I was born with a disability. Back in those days early detection wasn't available as freely as it is now... When i was born my Dad told his parents i was a still born... better to admit to having a dead child then a disabled one he thought. I have since been adopted and live a pretty happy life. They could have aborted me and i wouldnt be around. I'm now a teacher who gives back to this world. Why should a parent determine if their child should live or not. If they can then they should also get the same benefit when their child is a pain in the **** teenager and be able to just shoot them dead? Is that wrong? yes... so why should they be given the chance to kill a child, just because it hasn't come into this world? If they can't afford a child or don't want a child that may have a disability... they shouldn't have had sex in the first place...even with protected sex there is still a risk of having a baby. Don't want one.. don't have sex.|`|ZZMkENyeaa	I personally wouldn't abort a baby as I am personally against it, but what is right for one person may not be right for another, and different circumstances make this where it is a choice that needs to be there. So whereas personally, yes, I'm against abortion for myself, I do believe that everyone should have the choice to make up their own mind on this matter.|`|pBRN4xxTaa	bullshit! everybody is different! some pple view abortion not as murder some do. i for one believe in it, it wud b just as worse as keeping the child and not being ready at all financially blah blah! Abortion should be the parents choice!|`|TQg7yubGaa	Nice.  I will gladly do this.  Your going to piss some people off with this.  But I think its really cool!!!|`|Cre9jl1daa	hey yeah! i will.<br>  thanks for posting this!|`|67QVKHQ3aa	i think obama is right with what he believes in, its totally up to the mother whether or not she chooses not to have a baby...did u ever think of the 14 year old girls with abusive parents who get pregnant and have to get an abortion before they find out and beat her to a pulp...?<br>  <br>  or how about the women who are raped and beaten almost to death and end up pregnant...craziness runs through the blood you think any women would want to raise the child of their rapist who could possibly grow up to be the same as him..<br>  <br>  <br>  people need to open up there minds, for one you MEN will never understand what its like..<br>  <br>  how bout if one of you guys cheated on your GF and got some CRAZY chik pregnant.? (ive seen it happen to a friend) would you want her to keep it?? and torture you for the rest of your life, and not only that but ruin your relationship you are currently in...<br>  <br>  yea its like that, im pro-choice..<br>  <br>  OBAMA OBAMA !!|`|6SIjchQUaa	President Obama is not the person to send this to.  Try sending it to the members of the Supreme Court, they make the ultimate decision.  Although I seriously doubt Roe V Wade will ever be overturned.  <br>  <br>  I would never have an abortion but it is the woman's choice.|`|1G3XPiq3aa	You realize making abortions illegal wouldn't stop abortions, just make them far more unsafe? In countries where it's never been legal, there's still back street abortionists, but in America, you have thousands and thousands of doctors trained to perform them. Make it illegal, all you're doing is taking away the controls.<br>  <br>  Obama is more against abortion than Bush, and believes in putting a first trimester restriction on it, like more civilized countries already have. How about you back off and let people live their lives according to their own beliefs? You know even the catholic church has gone back and forth on the issue of first trimester abortions being ok, depending on the pope at the time. A lot of these people are the same people who gave Nadya Suleman a hard time for not disposing of her 6 embryos btw.|`|i8Ch743Laa	NO i WILL NOT do that. Mom's have a choice. It's a noble thing you' re trying to do,but it's not right to illegalize abortion. Then you'd just have tons of deaths at home because people attempt to do it themselves. I don't agree with abortion,but this isn't right. It's a mom's choice,although I would never do it,some moms are stupid like that. Many people have different views,and it's not going to be illegalized,I'll tell you that,it doesn't matter if over a million people do it.|`|14JQ11AUaa	OH ABSOLUTELY!!! In my own personal opinion:<br>  It is not at all that innocent babies fault that the parent is not ready for something "they knew" could happen!! I think that any baby should have a shot at life just like you and me...and the one carring the baby to begin with!!! I am SO GLAD you posted this, thank you very much.|`|8mchLCQhaa	I would do this! I am 100% against abortion!|`|7031265d0531963ae96124dd73a8cd85aa	This is ridiculous. <br>  <br>  Don't you people realize the number of orphans the taxpayers would have to take care of if all abortions ceased? I certainly hope YOU have the money to adopt at least 30 children because that's how many kids would have to be adopted by EVERY person in America if we stopped having abortions. <br>  <br>  I guess you don't realzie that there are 1,305,200 abortions performed every year in the United States. That ALOT of unwanted babies... and that's only after ONE year.|`|mfnugUZJaa	Sorry, but I won't be doing that. I'm pro-choice. You should be able to decide what you wanna do with your own body. I'm sick of judgmental people constantly screaming "you're murdering your baby, you awful, terrible person!" and all that crap. If it has nothing to do with you or doesn't effect you in any way then mind your own damn business. It's easy to say you're against something when you're not in the situation yourself and you don't understand the feelings of the people in those situations.|`|03fa507a988a8588a8f391a74af15d4baa	Tiffany why is it on every abortion thread your on their spouting rubbish. Women have a choice an people like you should get over it. Many women have abortions for all different reasons your bitching about people keeping their legs closed blah blah blah what about women who been raped or failed contraception. You was a lil school girl mummy no doubt claiming free house out of it so you no better. Mum at 15 hardly giving you child best start in life|`|CpiLHcTlaa	omg are you serious? this is stupid. no i don't agree with some of his policy's on abortion (partial birth abortion mostly) but how would people have felt if they did this with any anti abortion for all the women who would commit suicide or have back ally abortions and die? girls are going to have them all yours doing is making work for the people who work under him!  all those poor mail workers! and the letters that are really important? imagine how backed up they'll get because your being petty and unrealistic!|`|hGVkInSnaa	I will not do that. <br>  <br>  I believe that it should be a woman's choice whether or not they have an abortion and nobody can tell them what they want to do with their body.|`|DxoodgOtaa	thank you for posting this.<br>  because im 100% against abortion.<br>  and its not fair that someone should get killed before they are even born.|`|qBFojHLMaa	abosulutely!!|`|AA10280194	Great idea!  Symbolizing the blood on his hands :-)
rSMl6IbCaa	Put a medium one in there too.  You could also make the horses and houses the same colors...but not the same sizes.  Then you could have the child sort according to size and then according to color.  This is a harder task and would require a higher level of development.
NMkqyrryaa	It's a cute thought, but I really don't think any teenage girl would be down with making out while watching The Little Mermaid.<br>  <br>  Now, I used to love The Little Mermaid when I was little, but if my boyfriend suggested we should watch it I'd be a little weirded out and it would not make me want to kiss him. Well, maybe out of boredom I would want to kiss him.|`|YJWoRT5Zaa	what's that movie that just came out about the two guys that went to cheer leading camp? well anyways, that would be a really good movie to watch, my friends kissed after it was over, but there is so much kissing in that movie plus it was hilarious! there is a lot of cussing in it tho, but i loved it, and if i had a boyfriend watching the movie with me, that was actually cute, we probably would have kissed too!<br>  or watch twilight i bet you guys would totally kiss if you watched that.<br>  so two movies to pick from,<br>  the two guys who go to cheer leading camp with all the girl movie , or twilight|`|fjYC48Bvaa	how old are you to be considering The Little Mermaid a romantic movie??|`|F81T9hhxaa	Court? Are we in the 20's?<br>  Yeah why not watch a grown up romance movie? That would be better then the little mermaid.|`|pYnJqKVlaa	how old are you first of all, because a more mature movie might be better. A realistic movie, perhaps, like a chick flick. Cartoons are cute but they're not mood setters.|`|JImD5cmyaa	This is a perfect plan if you are 30 and she is 9.|`|KPknmgVGaa	pick a more mature movie like hmm the notebook|`|azIJoIdIaa	aww i loved the little mermaid when i was 5!  <br>  now that i'm 18, however, i don't like it so much.<br>  <br>  and FYI, no one uses the word 'court' anymore. try 'date' or 'go out with'|`|FxcIRk9vaa	I agree with Krys. (even though shes a loser lol)
mFQydvncaa	def. sounds like pregnancy take a test girl and goodluck! i bet you are, if you were spotting a couple days ago and it never started, then test, same happend to me! i was pregnant!!!!! <br>  <br>  could be implantation bleeding a test will pick it up. Also may i suggest dollar store test they are $1 and are very accurate and sensitive some more so then the expensive test, check out www.peeonastick.com to see what i mean.<br>  <br>  Plus if its not your month, dont give up and if your like i was i was a pee on a stick addict, so stock up on the dollar test. I also joined a free website to help with the TTC process it is free its like myspace for women trying to have babies, my name is pamelaanddanny on there. check it out, its www.twoweekwait.com top left corner click personalize my page.<br>  <br>  It also has womens stories and other great info!!!<br>  <br>  goodluck and babydust to you!!!!!|`|cP0NnP6Oaa	im ttc too. so just so you dont get your hopes up id try to wait another week but i know that waiting is hard. so if anything buy a box with more than one. at walmart clearblue easy digital has a pack of 5 for $20. good luck i hope you get your baby!
B1xrI9ZYaa	I doubt that she is pregnant you probably just tore her everything is fine|`|sbfm5rCAaa	If she has had a period then it is unlikely that she is pregnant.|`|Lmiu6oBHaa	Take a test and find out|`|SJPfjaS0aa	The blood on the condom could be from a small tear if you've had rough sex. Can she take the morning after pill? She has 72 hours from the time you had sex to take it.<br>  <br>  If you're having unprotected sex then yes, there is always the possiblility of her being pregnant even though you said you've never ejacaulated inside of her. There is always pre-*** that comes out during sex that you may not feel coming out.|`|F3ArhTiRaa	if you didn't use any rubber for protection but never ejaculated on her still there's a possibility that she'll get pregnant because of pre-ejaculation.  maybe you didn't notice that you have had your pre-ejaculation.|`|dSobv28maa	maybe you popped her cherry?|`|3gToWPZdaa	Not that likely.
mlxkiujYaa	my breast milk was never oily.  You can drink 1 beer a day and this protein will help|`|b978f631fc787a963337206aa3833370aa	It depends on what you're eating. Generally as long as you have a healthy diet, you're fine. Your breastmilk isn't more or less nutritious than it was before, as long as you're not eating like dirt or chalk or something. It will change consistency based on what you're eating. <br>  <br>  I would avoid beer, though, because it can actually hinder breastmilk production!|`|PymLdXM8aa	Im not sure what you mean by oily...? My foremilk was watery... but not oily. And my hindmilk was thick and pure white. SO i am not exactly sure what your asking so... if you want more foremilk ( milk that comes out first and is mainly to quench their thirst) drink more water. If you want more of the hindmilk ( which is the fatty milk that puts on weight) eat better and more often. <br>  <br>  Also when you nurse or pump always make sure that you are draining the hindmilk because if your not your body wont produce as much. Towards the end when i started to supplement with formula at 5 months I had over over supply of foremilk, Hope this helps and congrats!|`|rAD0mL7Saa	Sorry, I don't know what you mean by oily. The front is more watery, and towards the back is the most fatty, nutritious milk, so make sure your baby drains at least one breast completely each and every feed. Just stick to eating a lot of healthy food, remember you don't need actual fat because it gets turned into fat in your body, take your vitamin and mineral tablets, and maybe add flax-seed oil to your diet for Omega 3's, which are really, really important for your baby. You can just pour it onto your food and not even taste it. Try to keep ALL your fat unsaturated and rich in omega 3's, and try to limit how much you get from fish for the sake of reducing contaminents. If your baby's gaining weight properly, everything's most probably OK. If your baby's not gaining weight, sometimes there's just nothing you can do and you have to give top-up bottle feeds. Eradicate basil from your diet - that dries up milk supplies and women drink basil tea for drying up their milk after their baby is weaned.|`|lKsIKKm2aa	You must be pumping? How do you know this? Let the baby be on your breast as long as they want.. If you are indeed pumping, it sounds like you are mostly pumping out the thin foremilk. The hindmilj is more thick/'oily'.. But like everyone else said, just make sure you are eating good, and the baby is gaining weight!<br>  Happy breastfeeding;)|`|xoJcx0rFaa	If baby is healthy and gaining wt.  your milk is doing its job, eat and exercise.call local laleche league  for help.|`|7TYuCafDaa	Breast milk is mostly water. Continue to take prenatal vitamins and that will give your milk all the nutrients necessary for your baby
fe6fcbf713d0ed0538de9c9304001a52aa	People have a misperception that two income families with kids have more money than those that have only one income.    Unless the person that would stay home makes twice the cost of childcare per hour chances are that you are not coming out ahead after you take into account commuting, convenience foods (for home), coffee/snacks at work, dry cleaning, sick time, blah, blah, blah.    I live in Toronto, one of the most expensive cities in North America, I believe we are still in the top 20 on in the world.  My husband makes maybe $34,000 in a good year.  And we own a house.    Our weekly expenses (mortgage, electric, gas, insurance, internet, tv, phone, etc) are $440 per week.  That's not including gas for the car or food.  My husband makes between 350-700 per week.  Most weeks its only around $500-550.  I get about $300 a month in tax benefits.    We have two kids, but we manage.  Its tough, I won't lie.  Those unexpected expenses (vet bills, car repair, dental) can be a real kick in the crotch and it seems like its always something.  And honestly I'm just not that good at sticking to a budget, I hate to deny my kids or husband anything they want.  Especially "little" things that are like $1-10 but a few a week can really add up.    If its important to you you will find a way.  Honestly we could cut back more, I could get a free internet provider, we could use VOIP or cut back on features on the phone.  I could actually stick to a budget *lol*.|`|TN3Sthbwaa	My husband doesn't pull in loads of money but as an extra perk his boss pays for our home phone line, the husbands cell phone that is needed for work and our home internet access.  There are three bills right there that we do not have to worry about.  We do not have a television or cable so that is another bill taken out of the mix.  We do not have a car so we have no gas, insurance or or maintenance costs to worry about.  We take the city bus and supplement the unlimited monthly pass his boss gives him each month with a few 20 ride passes for our kids that are old enough to pay when they ride.  We also sacrifice in the way of food, we buy what we need not what we want.  We frequent the farmers market in the months it is open and we only buy store brand products.  We shop at thrift stores exclusively for our furniture, appliances and clothing.  We also rent so we have no money spent on upkeep or repairs.    Contrary to what your first answer thinks...we are not on any government assistance.      It is a sacrifice and at times we still struggle financially, but it is worth it in my opinion.|`|aJLx0nhNaa	I work from home on a freelance basis and one weekend day a week outside the home.  My husband makes a decent, but not excessive salary.    When I found out I was pregnant, I started squirreling money away like mad.  Seriously, I would skip coffee one morning and then transfer 2 dollars to savings!      When we had two incomes and no kids we were pretty generous with ourselves.  We ate out a lot and took more trips, which are two things that aren't that possible with a baby anyway.    In order to pay for full-time day care for a newborn, I would have been making very little per month at my job anyway.  So if I can make that amount of money without daycare, by freelancing or doing a little part time work, then I figure we are ahead of the game.|`|KWHiJbhaaa	Well I run my own daycare and pull in a pretty good amount of income, my husband works and we make a good living in that aspect so I really don't have toowork, but I've worked all my life and it feels more natural for me to contribute 50/50|`|B5MDTdtPaa	sadly only ways are live off other people taxes in a council house or your partners rich lol i would love to be a stay at home mum but there is sadly absolutely no way me and my partner would be able to pay bills, i hate the fact i have to work when i would love to be with my baby but my partner doesnt earn enough for a single wage alone and i have to much dignity and pride do be dependant on other peoples taxes to pay for my childrens upbringing so what else can i do? :(|`|AA11795652	I work at home in order to stay at home with my kids (4 years and 9 months).  I don't make a ton of money and my income fluctuates substantially depending on work load because I'm an independent contractor and have to find my own work.  My husband has a stable salary type income which is a good amount but we don't have a lot of extra money at the end of each month.  I didn't want kids until I knew I could stay at home with them.  Since "not working" was an option for us financially, I was able to set up my home office before having my first child and transition to working at home while I was pregnant with her.  I do a lot of different things and I always feel like I'm trying to balance work and being a mom.  I want to be a full-time mom and not work but I have to.  I do medical transcription, legal proofreading, word processing, bookkeeping, resumes, anything I can.  When my oldest was 22 months old, I did take a part-time job (because my work at home was so slow) out of the home three days a week but my mother-in-law and then my sister-in-law watched her and I quit the job right before I had my second.  There are options but you have to start planning now.  Working at home isn't easy.  I am sleep deprived because I do a lot of work at night when my kids are sleeping so I can concentrate.  But, I am always here for them and we can go to the park in the middle of the day, go to Disneyland, and do things that working a 9 to 5 job wouldn't allow us to do.  Feel free to e-mail me if you think I could help you with more details on how to work at home.|`|GGBDkOuFaa	Later down the road the parents cannot pay for the kids to go to college because the mom was too selfish and didn't work.  Now the kids are stuck with 30K+ in student loans.|`|qImMwhUHaa	To be honest, you afford what you want to. You just make ends meet by budgeting precisely and knowing what you can and can't afford. My hubby makes around $3,000 a month. Our rent is $1,075, utilities, insurance, car payments and other expenses take up the rest. We live within our means and are debt free other than our vehicle loan. It's by no means easy but I would never let my children be taken care of by anyone other than myself. You do what you have to do. If it means that you have to stay at your in-laws house then that's what you have to do. If you live with your in laws and you have two incomes then you should have PLENTY of money saved.|`|W8UZebRWaa	Well we only have 1 child and that's all we are going to have.  My husband is in the Army and his income is enough for me to stay home.  I don't go crazy spending and we have the luxury of the commissary and PX instead of regular grocery stores and walmarts.  We budget well so I think that helps.|`|b34544fc1adbb12a05af0930e6aca42caa	UMM I am A SAHM!! AND I DONT LIVE OFF OF OTHER PEOPLE! My hubby served in the army busted his butt and saved for his GI bill. He now gets disabilty for issues from iraq. He works and brings in good pay at a good job and goes to school. We have money to buy food go out to eat and buy lots of junk. It would hurt us if I worked adding in the cost of driving to and from work child care cause I wont leave my son with my MIL cause she drinks.. and we made some nice investments that if they work my hubby wont have to work his whole life. It all depends on how things are set up YES there are alot of SAHM who milk the tax payers but not all are like that and not all who are making it with out the help are rich. We are average middle class but we are doing a hell of alot better then our parents our right now.        Being a stay at home mom is rewarding my mom worked on and off it was more calming home when she was home and dinners were always good when she worked as well meals were quick and there was not as much bonding time which is hard when you have more then one child.|`|b0c36350d835d81614a99e05c0418bf5aa	you would be surprised...it can be done.     My husband and both worked with our first child. I became pregnant with our second and made the decision to stop working. The main reason was because daycare would have cost 1400.00. It just worked out that I got laid off anyway. So I collected severance and I have money saved. SO, I am using the two to get by. I will have to go back to work when my son is about a year old. I couldn't put him in daycare at 6 weeks old like I did with my daughter.|`|n6XYYyoLaa	how about going back to school now and waiting to move out? then u could get a better paying job, u could save your money for a down payment on your own home and another baby....also if u establish a career and have some experience, if u need to go back to work you willl have more options available; i am a RN, although i wouldn't  normally suggest anyone go into that field..LOL; anywhooo u can go 2 yrs and get an associate's degree and work weekend option at a hospital or other health facility....i did that for years even before our dd was born and i made almost as much working two days a week as i did when i worked mon thru friday....lots of places offer higher wages to ppl to work  weekends, and u could always pick up an extra day if you need to; you can also go to school for a year and become a LPN, which is a licensed practical nurse and do the same thing; it would be easier to get a job as a RN, but there are plenty of places that will hire lpns...the pay isn't as good as a RN, but it's not bad; and if u decided you liked it, you could go back for another year and get your degree and be a RN--with a bachelor's degree in nursing you have more room for advancement into management, etc...and after u get the AD if u want, you can get your four year degree in under two years if u go to school full time and go to one that has a 'bridge'.....any way the point is, u could get a decent paying job working two days a week while your hub ishome  to watch the kids, i worked with a lot of women who did that very thing....if u can afford it, you can work every other weekend; if a place needs nurses they are pretty flexible about the different schedules....
yTcQS31Yaa	Hi!  AF isn't due until 2/11 for me so I still have a week before testing.  Did your doctor tell you that an 8 meant you didn't ovulate?  I was informed that if your progesterone is at least a 4, that means you ovulated.  But if it's not at least 10 then a fertilized egg might not implant.  How is your estrogen levels?  My doctor put me on clomid, estrogen and progesterone this month and i finally ovulated on day 14! Which never happens...i usually ovulate on CD 20.  I will continue to pray for you! Baby dust!|`|7n3rSDn2aa	Somehow I always miss these posts until they're hours old and no one checks them anymore! I wish you tons of luck and baby dust! I've graduated to the pregnancy section as I am now almost 7 weeks pregnant! If you ever need anything feel free to drop me a line!
eeGN977eaa	I am so happy you asked this because I thought I was crazy. Just last weekend me and my kids were at my mom and dad's house with the rest of the family and all of the kids were playing nicely and we were all having so much fun and I got emotional because I felt overwhelmed with joy and happiness. I am so grateful for having such a love-filled life!  I think it is both a woman thing and a parent thing!|`|J6jZLt0caa	I think it's both. I know for a fact that now as a parent I am way more emotional than I used to be. I had my son's first birthday party on Saturday and the clown I had for entertainment asked me to say a few words to my guest. I think I got 3 words out and started crying! I think it's more of a parent thing, but it definitely includes both.|`|31269476570b3829c86de1e8c487e423aa	its both actually|`|j2mRop0laa	I am so glad other people do this.

This happens to me very easily.
fe6fcbf713d0ed0538de9c9304001a52aa	I wouldn't use it.  There have been a lot of injuries.    Fisher-Price, being a good company, wants to replace them even though they didn't actually make them.  If they will replace it then I can't see why you wouldn't take a new, clean, safe playyard for free.    http://www.cpsc.gov/CPSCPUB/PREREL/prhtm...  Incidents/Injuries: Due to Simplicity Inc. and SFCA Inc. being unresponsive to consumers via their Hotline and Web site, a significant number of complaints were recently reported. There have been at least 1,350 reports of one or more rails collapsing. There were numerous reports of children receiving bumps and bruises when the side rail collapsed. There were five reports of injuries which included a broken nose, a broken wrist, a mild concussion, a cut to the hand which required stitches, and a chipped tooth.    Description: The recalled play yards are portable and were sold with a bassinet, changing table, and mobile features. The products have a Rainforest? patterned fabric, Rainforest themed artwork and bear the Fisher-Price logo. The Simplicity Inc. model numbers are 5310 RNF, 5310RNFC, 5310RNFT and 5310RNFW. The model number is located on a sticker on one of the legs underneath the play yard.|`|n6XYYyoLaa	i dont' have it but i did look at it and had it on my registry until i realized there were some that were more sturdy, had better padding, and the padding is washable...if you are looking to buy i highly recommend the chicco discovery...it is great!!!
fe6fcbf713d0ed0538de9c9304001a52aa	If it was something that was actually recalled I wouldn't use it.    However when its something that just needs a part replaced I would still use it.    The bumbo wasn't "recalled (as in return it for money or a different product)" you were just given a new sticker with the warnings to place on it so it was more noticeable -that's just stupid.  Like the stupid boat toy I have that kids sit in and it has a horn and a steering wheel.  It has a huge hole in the bottom and weighs a TONNE and it says "not a flotation device" -if you need to be told that you shouldn't have kids!    The simplicity cribs that were recalled more than once and had different pieces replaced I wouldn't use.  I would replace.      Actually I would recommend no parent use a simplicity product at all.  The rainforest play yard was made by simplicity and the recall says:    "(Note: Simplicity Inc. and SFCA Inc. have not responded to CPSCs request to recall these products nor have they been responsive to consumer complaints recently received.)"  http://www.cpsc.gov/CPSCPUB/PREREL/prhtm...    Not the kind of company I would want to use products from.  And the rainforest playyard isn't a fix a part, its a fisher-price will give you a new one.  And hey a new playyard is at least clean and new!|`|3CVfUiiJaa	I have one of the cribs that was recalled last month.  It was recalled because of the brackets...apparently they were cracking.  Since we have no where else for our son to sleep I have kept him in his crib.  But I checked all the brackets for cracks and there are none, and the new brackets are on the way.    Any other item that I have hasn't been recalled yet...but if it was, I wouldn't let my son use it.|`|n6XYYyoLaa	if it was something stupid i would of course still use it, we love the bumbo with a tray!! i don't know anything about the play yard recall, but i know when we were looking at them in the store, that one didn't seem very sturdy, so we went with a chicco...sturdy as they come...and much nicer...has a nice padded mattress; washable, nice comfy bassinet feature, all the bells and whistles; but mainly bc it was so sturdy and had such  a nice washable pad with wooden slats for support..|`|F8KmTbqjaa	I agree with the bumbo!  People are so ridiculous sometimes.  The play yard I never had so I am not really sure why that was recalled.  To answer your question I would stop using it depending on the reason why it was recalled.|`|QXSFpMzDaa	I used a Bumbo and I agree that whoever put there baby on a counter or inclined is totally irresponsible.  I know that hospitals are still using them to this day.  However if I knew that a toy wold potentially harm my child due to lead paint, tiny pieces that might break off, or any other defect that could put my baby in danger I would absolutely not use it.|`|aJLx0nhNaa	The Bumbo recall was ridiculous.  It should have said something like:  "If you are a really stupid and careless person, do not use this chair."|`|HF97Rs9qaa	Why risk it... they get recalled for a reason. I personally would not use it.|`|ey4kL9xaaa	I continued to use the Bumbo.  The recall just gave you a sticker to put on the bumbo saying "don't place on raised surface".  I continued to use the car seat I have, as it was just a problem with the base, and I could use it without the base.  Some of the recalls are legitimate, but some of them are just common sense!|`|OtbbKdITaa	While Christmas shopping, I bought a toy piano for my (then) 11 month old daughter. It's the Little Tikes Baby Tap-a-Tune Piano. I later looked the toy up online to find that it has medium toxicity rating due to its use of cadmium in the small orange piano bar. I struggled with whether or not I should take it back. If you get a chance, google the toy to see the pic of how small the infected area is. I believe it is almost impossible for my daughter to put this part in her mouth, but I still took it back. More than anything, I was upset that Little Tikes is still putting this toy in stores knowing it's contaminated.
dDVAUA9saa	It's nothing new, debates about spanking and abortion surface about once every couple of weeks.  My favourite is when people are doing a "research paper"!

I honestly don't even open those questions anymore, much less answer them.|`|WL7nKDplaa	Well, this is Yahoo Answers, so if a parent has a question about spanking their child and they want other parents opinions they should be able to ask. Also people are very split about whether or not spanking is right, so they want to know what other people think. You don't have to answer these questions.
KWaTVVpGaa	I lost a baby 2 weeks ago. I was 23 weeks pregnant and he was still born. When I had him, I assumed that since he was dead and not full term, they would "dispose" of him. They told me that since he was over a pound, I would need to make arrangements for a funeral or cremation service.|`|c4d179c54efba1c73a993ab6f248346aaa	I was 4 month along and miscarried,  I had already pick out a name for him so that was easy.. But I did not have a funeral for him..|`|e1122490267c2903bd14e9cbbfe2af5daa	Funeral over three months I think. Naming your child or holding a mass for its passing, whatever you need to do to grieve the loss.
Iz5tNA5aaa	I would tell my husband that she either grows up or she can't see the baby.  It is fair treatment because if your MIL was abusing you your child would not be around her -- and she is verbally abusing you.    Stand up for yourself if your husband won't stand up for you.  If she brings trash in for the baby to play with I would get nasty and say "trash is not toys and belongs outside" and then throw it in the garbage in front of her.    I'm a very matter of fact, in your face kind of person when it comes to my kids.  I've had previous experiences with my MIL that were not pleasant, but we've worked out an awesome relationship now!    Good luck!
Cx5Zo7IIaa	Invest in some ear plugs and let him cry it out until he learns you are not coming and figures out how to sleep through the night. A baby his age does not need night feedings. Also keep him awake during the day as much as possible, be sure to expose him to lots of sunlight during the day also it will naturally make him sleepy when the sun goes down and lights are dimmed in the house. Establish a routine so he knows when bedtime is coming like bath, a story then lights out.|`|fd34d7830f1987fa091fa8de50613944aa	Please do not let him cry it out any longer. This is not good for him and is working against what you are trying to accomplish. I rock my son to sleep some nights, other nights I lay next to him until he drifts off, or he falls asleep drinking a bottle. He is 9 months and does not cry at bedtime. It would really benefit both you and your son if you tried to make bedtime a no-cry zone. You may have to rock him a bit longer, but it is well worth it to have a secure and happy baby.<br>  <br>  "Some children made to cry it out to sleep cry so violently that they vomit. Some parents find that the nighttime crying affects their babies' daytime personalities — making them clingy and fussy. Many find that any setback (teething, sickness, missing a nap) sends them back to their night waking problems, and they find they must let their babies cry it out over and over again. <br>  <br>  Dr. Paul M. Fleiss and Frederick Hodges in Sweet Dreams: A Pediatrician's Secrets for Baby's Good Night's Sleep have this to say about cry-it-out sleep training programs: <br>  <br>  “A child cannot comprehend why you are ignoring his cries for help. Ignoring your baby's cries, even with the best of intentions, may lead him to feel that he has been abandoned. Babies are responding to biological needs that sleep 'experts' either ignore or deny. It is true that a baby whose crying is ignored may eventually fall back asleep, but the problem that caused the night waking in the first place has remain unsolved.  <br>  <br>  “The most sensible and compassionate approach is to respond immediately to your child's cries. Remind yourself that you are the parent, and that giving your baby reassurance is one of the joyous responsibilities of being a parent. It is a beautiful feeling knowing that you alone have the power to brighten your child's life and banish fear and sorrow.” <br>  <br>  Professor Margot Sunderland, a leading expert in the development of children's brains and a British Medical Association award-winning author, says, “If you ignore a crying child, tell them to shut up or put them in a room on their own, you can cause serious damage to their brains on a level that can result in neurosis and emotional disorders later in life,' Based on her four-year study of brain scans and scientific research, Sunderland entreats parents to reject the theories of ‘controlled crying’. <br>  <br>  A child’s cries are his way of communicating his needs. If you ignore this attempt at communication you are sending a message to your child that his feelings are not important to you, and that you are not the one to call to for help. These feelings can be bred into other relationship areas as your child grows older. By ignoring a child’s cries you may be setting up a pattern that will follow for the rest of your life in your relationship with your child."<br>  <br>  ***ETA: Sometimes our little one wants to stay up when he wakes for a feeding. If he won't rock right back to sleep I will take him into the living room and sit with him with dim lighting and give him a toy and just let him tire himself out again.|`|nGjCDH1Xaa	try using a breast pump, and giving him warm milk. or try the bath stuff that is meant 2 help them sleep|`|hieQHR0daa	At six months babies do not physically require night feeds. At 11 months this is a habit more than a dietary requirement. as long as he gets fed when he wakes he will continue to demand this. If you cannot bear to completely stop this feed reduce it by one oz every night until there is no milk on offer.( if this is a breast feed reduce the sucking time by 5 minutes and get rid of this feed.)<br>  When he wakes crying, go to him, do not lift him, stroke him in his cot and say very little. Sooth him and withdraw. He needs to learn to get himself back to sleep. Use a minimal handling and minimal intervention to settle him.<br>  It might be worth getting a proper consultation and some tailored advice to follow.|`|vsFJZRkGaa	it sounds like he is over tired and therefore finding it hard to settle - to the point of upsetting his stomach. my sister and i have the same thing, we are now 30 and still vomit when we get over tired before sleeping - we wake up sick in the night.<br>  doctors say its from being over tired and our bodies finding it hard to find a sleep rythmn.<br>  <br>  try to put him to bed earlier, offer at least 2hrs of resting/quiet time during the day as well as naps. this will help him sleep better at night believe it or not.|`|zAhBlMQLaa	Each baby is a unique individual. Sometimes they are difficult to handle but my friend patience is a virtue. Sometimes they may even tease you...just like when they intensionally drop an object for someone, which you probably to pick up.  When time to sleep they usually handle their own baby bottles and soon they get sleep on their own. At times you may have to rub her back slightly and mildly to get them asleep. You may also sing her lullaby. I hope it helps...|`|YsBSTT8saa	get him a psifer to sux on during the night... Ensure plenty of care during the day... for the baby to vomit during the night is a little obnormal... maybe the baby is not use to intake foods during the night...<br>  try not to use the rockin thingy anymore... do it manually by hand.... or in future u will be in hard time when dont have the rocking thingy...
auUeI2Vnaa	I doesn't mean anything.  It was a dream.  Of course, if you had a miscarriage before, it would be possible for you to have another one, but a dream isn't going to be a deciding factor.|`|wl7tlYOYaa	Relax...when i was pregnant with my daughter I had a dream she was born early and had died and i was holding on to her for my dear life it was so real...shes 3now the only part of the dream that was true was that she was a girl and her father had another woman lol liste she might of just dreamt that because subconsciously shes afraid just like ur are that something is going to happen.|`|oojO4WAraa	It doesn't mean anything.  Don't worry.|`|aqto0hJTaa	It means your aunt is a complete moron for telling you that.|`|QYYWBrG7aa	Dreams are only dreams they mean nothing.iv had some pretty awful dreams about my baby boy and i`m so glad they haven't came true.don't let the dream stress you.you and ur baby will be fine.|`|01vMpHkWaa	dont worry...that just makes things bad on your body    dreams are dreams    my mom dreamed she was pregnant while i was  then she dreamed it was girl...and im having a boy  i have even dreamed i miscarried  actually i have had a few of those dreams    its nothing.|`|W0gMQVoDaa	dont worry about this please xx|`|8WRnqs08aa	Could be intuition or coincidence. Don't get to worked up over it. Relax and try to stay healthy so you can continue a full term pregnancy.    I pray that your aunt's dream is nothing, as I have lost two and it is devastating.|`|8nnCFk1Iaa	It doesn't mean anything will happen, none of my dreams have ever come true!    It is awful of your aunt to tell you this, take no notice of her.|`|9QyrW2iCaa	This means that your aunt has probably been thinking about you, maybe too much.  Most dreams are anxiety dreams and she may not be thoughtful at times in what she shares with you.  You won't have control of your aunt's dreams, but to believe this is a premonition of some type is to give in to magical or superstitious thinking.  Many things are coincidental and we often given them more relevance than is warranted.  Good luck with your pregnancy!  : )|`|BjNKpy4Eaa	Look, you've already had one miscarraige which means the thought could have been in her head anyway.    She probably would have dreamed it, regardless-it just happened to coincide with you actually being pregnant.    Does she know you two were trying again??    That could also be behind it, she could have been just worrying about you.    Though, to be honest, I dont know if she should have told you about the dream, no one wants to hear that!    I would tell you not to freak out, a huge amount of first pregnancies are miscarraiges, it in no way means that anything will go wrong with this one.    Relax and enjoy your pregnancy, congratulations, and I wish you the best for the future.|`|t1WOxnI8aa	It means she had a dream that you were pregnant. That's all! Now that you are pregnant you need to relax and dismiss anything or anyone that would stress to your life and your baby. When you decide to tell your family that you're pregnant I suggest you tell your aunt not to talk about miscarrying to you while you're pregnant. That's something I would have kept to myself!|`|Zz1HI5VHaa	Dreams are a way for your brain to purge stress. I would imagine that your previous miscarriage was on her mind. or if she knows you want a baby that was on her mind. she is probably feeling some anxiety that the niece she loves had not had the opportunity to share her love with a child. I wouldn't stress yourself out over it. on the contrary the fact that your aunt had this dream indicates that she cares very much about your well being and I would focus on that.     ~Side note, I am sorry for your loss. A very high percentage of women lose their first child. You hear more about it these days than our mothers did because of the advances in the testing department. twenty years ago most women miscarried before they knew they were pregnant. the fact you lost one child, while heart breaking does not necessarily mean this child is in any danger. And I know it is hard not to stress but keep in mind that stress is hard on the body and not good during pregnancy. Try to enjoy this wonderful experience!~
LrBYeb6Aaa	sorry sweety to hear of ur loss, if u feel u can handle that and u wish to do so then go for it, it doesnt matter wat other people think its what makes u feel right.|`|oYmZUO8Caa	So sorry for your loss :(<br>  <br>  I'm not sure if you would WANT to use it again. It might bring up bad memories. Although a family friend lost a child when he was age 20, and they actually had a baby afterwards and named him after the son who died. I think it's a bad idea.. it's sort of a "legacy" thing I guess. <br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|gTiQLYCZaa	aww im sorry to hear that<br>  of course you could use the same name hunny, do what you feel is right.<br>  im sure your son in heaven would be very proud to have his little brother have his name<br>  <br>  but as i said before, do what you feel is right<br>  <br>  ~good luck~|`|1ad2771a77e03d1afa77d4cef9cdd54baa	Sure, if you feel like it's the right choice for you and not too painful.|`|XnEnelsBaa	Idea, perhaps use it as a second name in memory of his brother? I think you should use a different first name to help you move forward. Choosing a different name sounds more natural to me. Each child has a different personality so you should be assigning a different name to each.<br>  <br>  For some more ideas on picking a name see my website:|`|v721s9KKaa	Sorry to hear that. I think you should go with a new name because it is a new individual not a replacement for your first boy. That way you are honoring your first pregnancy as his own person also.|`|7XIWtNr6aa	Do not you the same name!

kZRTekoJaa	when you are 5 weeks pregnant, you are in your second month. DRs go by weeks since months are typically 4 weeks and 2 or 3 days long. but in my opinion at 38 weeks pregnant you are in your tenth month. you have already been pregnant for a full nine months (as 4.2-4.3 weeks a month= 37.8-38.7 weeks at "nine months") and those are weeks past so technically you are in the tenth month.  Technically.  :)  37 weeks is considered full term, which is where (i am guessing) "nine months" being a typical pregnancy came into play.|`|jG8b3Mz0aa	9 months|`|uCqxkEhUaa	9 1/2 months.

w0eRRsoVaa	First and foremost...ew to the whole 21 and 16 thing.  I know mathematically that's not that bad but, dude.  If he's Mormon...home boy has strayed off that beaten path.  Do you know his parents?  If they are generally nice people, I would call and ask them what the deal is and I would ask them to talk to him, not about coming back to you as a couple, but about his responsibilities as a father.  People are entitled to flip for a little while after finding out about a pregnancy that wasn't planned, but that's a whole 'nother level of flip out on his part.    I would simply ask him if he plans on being a father.  If he says no, tell him you'll see him in court.  If he says yes, you two seriously need to talk to eachother to iron out some details.  Either way, he's responsible for creating this child, he's also responsible for helping to care for this child, whether it's pulled out of his paycheck, or he willingly gives it (I'd still write up the rules you lay down and file it with the court if your state allows it).  Guidelines can be set such as:    1.  Visits will only occur when child support has been established.  2. SO's are not to join unless otherwise approved 24 hours in advance and not for the first 3 months.  3. Overnight visits will only be approved once he has proven himself to be logical, grown up, and a good father.  4. No bashing one another in front of the child, even as an infant they can sense emotion, especially anger and frustration.  5. Grandparents can join in on visits so long as they abide by the rules of no bashing/chastising.  6. Meeting places will be public such as parks, coffee shops, restaurants, kiddie gyms, etc.  7. The minute he stops trying to pay child support, unless he has lost his job and has made you well aware of it, you will file with the court for temporary full custody (if you really and truly want to do that of course).  8. If tensions rise between eachother, attemp family counseling as you two will share a bond with your child until the end of your days and you will have to learn to deal with it.|`|WL7nKDplaa	He shouldn't be going this and if they're sleeping together its not legal. I|`|jLYTKr33aa	He is not a deadbeat because of the girlfriend, he is a deadbeat because he's a jerk.  No real father would let anyone or anything stand in the way of his relationship with his child.  Surround your baby with loving family members, sue "Dad" for child support, and forget about him.|`|NEH7JWNMaa	You whine a awful lot for someone who doesn't care.|`|nopHdd9Kaa	First off, the fact that you are pregnant lends more credit to the whole "claims to be Mormon" thing then him living with her.  Mormons are not that wild about living together before marriage, but premarital sex is a major no-no.  Both of which should have no bearing on the situation.  If he was a Catholic the same thing applies.    I say ignore him.  If he is with a 16 year old (which is illegal in all states with him being his age) he is probably not in the right place to be a parent, nor would I want someone like that around my child.|`|VwMkiLFPaa	First off, he sounds like hes just super immature. He may have been excited about becoming a father.then he realized how much work goes into it and how much children cost.     Second, dont go blaming this new girlfriend. I get SO FED UP with people immediately blaming the new girl or the stepmom. Does the man not have a mind of his own? He is entitled to think and feel and love as he pleases. So if hes not stepping up and being a father like he should be, thats on HIM and has not a damn thing to do with the new girlfriend. (I dont mean this in an offensive way, its just all you hear and men need to take SOME responsibility instead of the blame being put on the newbie)     I think you should ask if you two can have a talk. Confront him about it. Ask him to come by for dinner. (I know, probably not your IDEAL scenario, but you guys are in this for the long haul so you better get used to it) Have a nice, civil dinner, with no fighting. And talk about the things you guys want to work on with your little one. Explain any concerns you may have but dont be accusatory.     When my husband became a father, he was SCARED. Its normal. For women, I think we just step it up because we have to. Men, it doesnt work that way in their minds. They freak out. I was married to my husband at the time I got pregnant, married when we had the baby, and were still together. Up until our son was a year old, my husband was never 100% comfortable.     If talking to him doesnt work, and dropping subtle hints here and there doesnt work, then youve done all you can do. And you can only focus on yourself and being a Mommy to your child.     Good luck!|`|ZcrsqMbcaa	his girlfriend is a child and you should report the pediphile|`|7HzfgRmwaa	oh.. i don't think very highly of guys.

What's really sad is that in spite of all the research and knowing of how bad these substances are, there are still women out there who have no idea that it could harm their baby.  But yeah, it makes many of us fume when the girl is someone who should and probably does know better.|`|7031265d0531963ae96124dd73a8cd85aa	I've been a waitress for a really long time now and I see big pregnant women order and drink a glass of wine on a regular basis. It doesn't REALLY bother me that much because for all I know, they don't do it all the time and even doctors say that a glass of red wine in pregnancy can be GOOD FOR THE BABY! I mean, If I were to see a pregnant woman taking shots or something or drinking hard liquor it might rub me the wrong way and I would actually be kind of pissed but yeah.. <br>  <br>  As for the smoking thing, I think it is SO tacky to see a woman with a bumb and a cigarette in her hand! And you know these women know that the people around them think they're stupid... I think smoking is pretty dumb anyways and smoking during pregnancy is pretty white trash if you ask me. <br>  <br>  <br>  HOWEVER,  you should pretty much mind your own business. And why would you let something that someone else does send you into "absolute rage"? Letting other people control your emotions like taht will only set you up for a really stressful life. You can't control other people... you can have your opinions but it should never make you mad when other people do things you don't like.|`|Y3DR1EBUaa	i think it is discusting & irresponsible|`|sbfm5rCAaa	Well as a man who never has to put his life on hold you can feel whatever you want. <br>  <br>  I do not smoke but I do have the occassional glass of wine (about 5 glasses since I found out I was pregnant and I am now 35 weeks) and my baby is perfectly healthy and fine.<br>  <br>  I agree that mothers have an obligation to their unborn children but I also think it is really selfish to expect them to have absolutely no life just because they are pregnant.<br>  <br>  If you actually do some research on pregnancy you will see that in this day and age pregnant women actually can't do anything. we get told we can't do this or that and we can't eat most things and we can't drink stuff and we can't take medication no matter how severe our pain is...<br>  <br>  What I say is back off. Most pregnant women are responsible enough to know if they are hurting their babies or not and if they want the occassional cigarette or glass of wine then you have no right to tell them they can't!|`|gTiQLYCZaa	yes.<br>  i think is disgusting!<br>  the poor baby.<br>  <br>  and i know its hard to stop smoking, but honestly.<br>  this woman looked about 36 weeks pregnant and smoking!<br>  <br>  my auntie is pregnant, she's about 3 months gone now, and she was a smoker, she has now cut it down from 10 a day to 2 a day which is very good.<br>  she will soon be off them for good! and she said she wont go back to them after shes given birth.|`|AA12192295	I always hate seeing it. I always wonder how they don't feel guilty. I was a smoker and my pregnancy was not planned but I quit smoking the day before I found out I was pregnant, the smell made me sick so I had no problem quitting at all. My baby turned out to be a blessing for my health.. I just cant imagine continuing to smoke and know that my baby would be suffering. <br>  <br>  And yes, pregnant women have to give up a lot for our babies and its not always easy but its totally worth it. I can put aside my guilty pleasures for a while so that I can make sure to give my baby the best chance at a healthy life.|`|y9TvRvs6aa	Yeah, my sister is pregnant at the moment, and smokes a packet each day.<br>  <br>  She does have a mental illness though, and her doctor told her that she shouldn't quit smoking (he did recommend that she cut back). It just annoys me, because she had complications in her first pregnancy. It is selfish, because technically she is poisoning her child.|`|59GymH27aa	I have seen woman smoking and I think it's disgusting.<br>  <br>  However, when I was about 6months pregnant I went to the pub and was drinking orange juice and lemonade only and people were sneering at me and just assuming I was drinking alcohol...that made me really angry!|`|AA11661793	yes, it makes me sick!
QXSFpMzDaa	I was never very big during my pregnancy...I might have gained 15 lbs, max.  Luckily I never got stretch marks or where my belly button poked out.  However my friend got them at about 6 months and mostly around her hip area and a bit around her belly button.  I remember her telling me that she used special lotions and creams and they worked.|`|ioZeveazaa	I started getting stretch marks on my breasts around week 22 and then got a couple on my hips and a couple on the side of my upper legs from sleeping on them all the time. There is really nothing you can do to avoid them. They are more genetic than anything however exercising and not sitting or standing for too long can help. It will help to keep the blood freely moving. Good luck!|`|q7HvkRpyaa	I didn't get stretch marks with my son until I was almost 8 months, and even then they were very faint ones on my outter upper thighs. I used a ton of Palmer's tummy butter, so I never got them on my belly and the ones on my thighs faded after using it after he was born. This time I haven't gotten all that big and the skin is still a little stretched from my son, so I haven't gotten any marks at all.|`|5bc21d2d2a57683cdbd5ef3c4094ebc4aa	I didn't get stretch marks until after the baby was born.|`|JgpyfuuWaa	I also didn't get stretch marks until after my daughter was born.  I just got a couple on both sides of my stomach, they're not too noticable.|`|nHpd4lRXaa	I made it until 8.5 months, I though I was going to make it through without the cursed things. Low and behold, I ended up looking like a watermelon.|`|eV5E9MhUaa	Depends on how your skin is... I made it all the way up to 8 months. :( I thought I was going to be lucky. Cocoa butter, and take bath's with baby oil. Good luck!|`|5ViTUTyZaa	With my son I was about 6 months when I started to get them.  I was seriously (no joke) poor and could not even afford lotion, so I did nothing to help them and was terribly itchy.  Now I am 37w and I have not gotten any new marks.  Only 2 that I already had turned red again.|`|eDnWMm3maa	Stretchmarks are hereditary. If you're going to get them, there's nothing you can do about it.|`|MqFeJiukaa	It just depends but for me I was in my 8th month.  BTW I did everything you can think of to prevent them and nothing worked.  Its all depends on the elasticity in your skin.  Palmer's, vitamin e oil, stretch mark creams, ETC nothing works.|`|Gr78AFvyaa	I was about 34 weeks and BAM, I woke up one morning and had stretch marks. I got them on my tummy below my belly button and now at 40 weeks I am starting to get some on my hips too ... I used palmers cocoa butter and all that but it I guess it didn't work for me, some women swear by it.|`|5WYeHh0paa	Well about 2 weeks ago, so I was 21 weeks my husband noticed faint white stretchmarks on my buttocks!! They are pale and faint and I havent done anything to remove them. You have to prevent them, its easier to prevent them than to fade stretch marks. I know there are tons of creams and lotions out there but i've heard that olive oil can be your best friend. Its all natural and has been used for ages to hydrate stretched or stretching skin. Try it!|`|8jsoK3zdaa	i was in my 8th month when i started getting them, on my sides and right about my belly button, im not sure if thats cause i had it pierced though.  thats it, there not bad. i use palmers cocoa butter EVERY NIGHT and morning, its FOR stretch marks and works very well. my sister didnt use it and her belly looks like a water melon.|`|4YZBPfhRaa	i made it through the whole 9 months without getting them. I used like litterally EVERYTHING i could use not to get them..      good luckkk |`|4d33006d173d8d1adcaf0e22cf5af0efaa	8 mths and i use cocoa butter

b70c76c680f23b7b2d94815940d49450aa	Yeah, it caused quite a lot of controversy here in the UK when it aired. It seems the woman is focused on fitting the baby's needs around the parents who seem intent on continuing with a single persons lifestyle. What's the point in starting a family??? There are some people who see babies as more of a commodity and an excuse to dress them up in designer clothes, run them around in ridiculously expensive buggies and use them as a fashion accessory. What we're ending up with is kids who confuse material possessions with love and as a result spoilt brats who haven't had the love and effort required to turn them into well adjusted, morally guided adults.|`|a454ee46524abf792eec0686abd82584aa	I didn't watch it but the premise was trying out the methods used in the 50s 60s and 70s. So the method you describe was common in the 50s when I was born. So was the horrific mutilation of circumcision, which I resent deeply. There were some great things about growing up in the 50s and 60s but early childhood care systems was not one of them,<br>  Geoff|`|276aa285c0c3bcae2ed83a2a0b8cfa53aa	wow that is very old fashioned. i have heard some crazy stories from people who have grown up with strange parents. my friend was left to cry all night from newborn. her mother never got up and fed her in the night from the start. thank goodness we have better techniques now.|`|iikdZKO7aa	OH MY GOD! People who don't have kids really shouldn't be making programs on how to raise a child.<br>  She was probably never cuddled as a child. It is so sad for all those little babies whose parents actually take this womans advice.<br>  Thats just horrible!|`|J9Tbun7naa	I was going to watch that last night but decided to have an early night instead.... That is freakin rediculous!!!<br>  <br>  And to think that people will actually watch that and take her advice...that is so scary!|`|f4zg7LHLaa	i saw it when it was on in the UK a few months ago, and i was quite shocked. i was talking to my MIL about it, and her mother was in the room too. Her mother said very casually that she used to do it with my MIL! she would be sceaming so much that relatives who lived close by could hear her! they lived in the country, and anything could have happened! <br>  <br>  my son has never been left to cry, is fed when HE wants, and gets lots of cuddles. he is one very happy contented baby. he didn't sleep through by 12 weeks, but there is no way in hell i would miss having those early weeks with him, for a good nights sleep.|`|eabe4c3a6e53ede1a2078c8d7dfcf4b7aa	wow....strange and sick...she doesn't ever deserve to have kids. period|`|tecPZUq2aa	Yes I Saw It The Other Year,<br>  <br>  I Was Horrified At The Fact That She Left The Baby Outside On Its First Day Home!

How does the child even know he/she is loved with that attitude?|`|NjeN7Lc9aa	omg it was scaryyyyyyy.|`|WKtakdsOaa	Thats what a lot of parents did in the past as the technique was strictly followed by a lot of parents. Truby Kings method was a big thing  and it was seen as the 'right' thing to do to stop your children getting spoilt. I am an early childhood studies degree student and we watched a video about parents from that time looking back saying they followed it because of pressure and some wished they hadnt. <br>  <br>  Thats why I dont trust parenting experts now and think you should do what comes naturally to you and what you think is right. This was a massive methd prior to 1950s when Dr Spocks method came out which shows how fads can change and so called 'experts' dont always give teh right advice imo|`|kxD35uB5aa	i agree, that sounds horrible, i have to admit i am one to use the tough love method but i only let my baby cry for about 5-8min and then if he is still crying i will pick him up and put him back down once he settles.. i sure as hell wouldnt put him outside alone for 3HOURS!! thats shocking!..sounds like that woman dosent know what it is to be a mother! your entire job is to love, nuture and care for your child not neglect it and starve it of motherly love!!
nfzQkvqraa	My children know to respond to someone if they're being asked a question or given a compliment.  If they forget, I'll say thank you for them.  My children's cousin (whom I babysit several times a week) is PAINFULLY shy.  There's no way she's going to respond to anyone less than a family member.  I don't think it's rude in that case.  It would be damaging to try to force a comment out of her.  She's only 4 and I will just respond for her while she looks down at the ground.|`|29Lrkdunaa	Too bad we can't raise other people's kids. First impulse is to say that I think it's rude. However, you just don't know what her mother has told her. If you are a neighbor and talk to her mom, you are no longer a stranger. Maybe she has a hearing problem, maybe she's really, really shy or maybe she's just plain rude. I would simply stop speaking to her (the kid). No need to stress yourself out.|`|son2d5G1aa	Well, a lot of children are the same. I believe this is from shyness, or maybe because she doesn't know you that well. Just keep trying to talk to her. She will open up to you eventually. But, never accuse her of being rude. She's only 3.|`|31269476570b3829c86de1e8c487e423aa	In a way you are right but come on shes three get over it ur lucky she didn't' duck behind her mom and refuse to come out|`|cAtWxJG1aa	my daughter suffered from a form of social anxiety disorder called selective mutism when she was younger.  she literally could not talk in some situations because she was too anxious.  i cannot tell you how aggravating it was to me (and how stressful it was to her, and counterproductive towards making her better) when people assumed that she was being rude and needed to be disciplined.      please don't make assumptions about other people's children.    not all shy kids are selectively mute.  but i think it's fine to cut small children a break, selectively mute, shy, or otherwise.  she will talk when she is ready.|`|nKSmgjylaa	She's only 3, how is she to know about answering when she's spoken to or showing "respect"? Give the kid a break, she's shy, that's all.|`|sxecXFgraa	She's shy.  Some kids are.|`|jG8b3Mz0aa	My daughter is the same way. If my husband and I chide her to say hello, she will not. She usually will say hello or many other things once we leave her alone. I'm guessing she is just shy or that's her temperament. She's only 3, if she were 5 an older; then there might be a problem.|`|Jo2DfRzaaa	My daughter could do the same thing.  She is not rude.  she is selective in who she feels comfortable enough to talk to.  Its not rude its called shes 3 and she is still unsure of strangers and people.  I am perfectly okay with this behavior.  Since I'm her mother, thats the only opinion that matters (well and her dads and he is fine w/it too)|`|YuVSDBkzaa	At three years old, the child is still developing her social skills. I'm always surprised when my daughter becomes shy around someone she's not too familiar with and stays quiet when they say hi because she is normally so outgoing. If she's around anyone else though, she doesn't have a problem. In all honesty, it sounds like you are taking a little offense to the fact that she doesn't answer you, when MANY children are like this at that age. I do believe in teaching respect, but I don't think that's what this is about.|`|paerqxfMaa	She's 3 - leave her alone - she is evidently shy, not rude.  If her mother is present, she could say "Say hello to Mrs. soandso", but maybe she just knows her kid is shy and it's not worth the hassle of getting her to talk to you.|`|oojO4WAraa	She is three.  Get over it.   Some kids are late talkers.     Your son is not a puppy to be trained and shown off.|`|gJlxZdL5aa	That is just the kids personality as she gets older she will come out of her shell    I was that way.   I talk when I have to now as an adult but I'm still terribly shy.  Don't force them to interact because that make the shyness or anxiety worse.    Trust me some kids are just like that.|`|jTM6Upm5aa	I always walk up to the child and kneel down and talk to them.It helps with young children, you can make eye contact. She may be shy with you, or she may not know how to respond to you. You may have to give her the words on how to appropriately respond to you, " why don`t you say thank you Sally?That would make me happy". Maybe she doesn`t have the social skills, help her.I always do this with my neighbour`s six year old son, ( a my neighbour is a shrink),lol. She can`t teach her child social skills, LOL!!|`|K6rZmVmAaa	She's prob shy or doesn't like you. She's not your kid so why does it matter.|`|SlBsJ3NRaa	She's 3. My boys are 3 and 4 and if they don't feel like talking, I don't make them. I do say "___ is talking to you" and it prompts them to answer, but sometimes they will just clam up. In which case I just tell whoever is talking to them that they are being shy and don't want to talk.|`|uGFzzLYWaa	She's only three years old, and not your child, but you have a problem with this child that is of no relation to you who does not want to acknowledge you?   Since you aren't getting the reaction or "respect" you feel that you are entitled to, leave the girl alone.|`|AA12145826	If she was 13, then I would say either she's rude or deaf. However, being as she is only 3, I'd chalk it up to her being shy or even scared other adults she doesn't know really well. Case in point: One of my co-workers has a 3 yr old little girl who is scared to death of other adults. Seriously if you say hi to her she breaks into tears. Her dad says that she just takes a long LOOOOOOOONG time to warm up to people. Its kinda of sad really, because her older brother who is the same age as my daughter is super outgoing. I guess it just goes to show that siblings can be polar opposites.|`|be68e6d198f3f9ac69efb2146c8d907eaa	I think she is a kid, let it go!
fb61d99b32eb382445becee914185af9aa	You don't necessarily need a carpet, unless you want one, buy a kid's rug, or play mat for him from a kids store.  My girl started crawling at 8 months.  It was literally like one day nothing, and the next day yes.  Put him on the floor more, on the rug and he will get more practise.  :)<br>  <br>  Good luck :)|`|AA11330115	There is no reason for you to speed anything up in your child's development...he will crawl on his own time...every child learns things at different speeds and levels.|`|OHfZFR31aa	Because kids sleep on their backs, many no longer go through a crawling stage. They go right to walking. You can try a carpet, but if he doesn't get a lot of "tummy time" he might not crawl anyway|`|hieQHR0daa	Not every child crawls and that's not a problem. Some children shuffle on their bums and get around faster that way so they see no need to crawl. Others go straight to walking. It's not the flooring that is a problem, in fact, it's not really a problem, but I do understand your concerns. Children who crawl are expected to be trying to do so by 9 months and yet, as I already said not every child crawls.<br>  Relax, you cannot force any of the stages of development, all children are different I'm sure he will get there.
bf03f3398ae59403fb987824b585b742aa	Dont give your baby orange juice. Not a good idea. I would just give her a little cooled boiled water but you shouldn't even need to do that. You will know if she gets constipated. If you really want to give juice then any 100% preservative free juice that isn't citrus(just dilute it 60% water). I would just try a bit of cooled water or maybe baby herbal tea if you can get some.|`|5ZvALiclaa	Juice is absolutely not needed for babies, especially not citrus juice. Apple or pear would be where you would start but I don't believe in giving babies sweet juice until at least 1 year old. PLUS She doesn't need any extra fluids apart from your breastmilk. Your mother is not right on that one. You can give her cold boiled water though if you wanted to, to get her used to water. I started water at 4 mths when i started solids but just to wash down the rice cereal. Small sips from a sippy cup or bottle at mealtime is a great starting point but you don't need to push it. She will not become constipated from not getting juice. Having more poos with the rice cereal is normal. You may notice they get firmer now that she has solids but that doesn't mean that she is constipated. Yes she may take a few days to adjust, but juice won't fix that, instead it will get her used to the sweetness which is something you want to avoid. Water is your best bet for now in my opinion.<br>  <br>  Good luck|`|J6IOqzL0aa	i live in egypt too!!!! where abouts are you?? im in heliopolis.  if your little one is pooing fine then i would not offer any extra fliuds as i assume she is still BF loads. However if you feel she needs more you could offer a very small amount of cool boiled water. But max 30 ml at a time just a couple of times a day. Or they have the baby teas here i think it is call milupu. I have read that it is  completely normal for a baby to go a couple of days w/o pooping so if she is pooing every other day but the texture is normal i wouldnt worry. My son i 3 months old. He went from pooping after every feed to once a day or every other day but the texture is good so there are no worries!!|`|h85kkDsbaa	Hi there, my health visitor told me to gave my son juice from about 2 months to help him with constipation, i gave him 2ozs of cool boiled water and a tablespoon of fresh orange juice (not concentrated) and this helped him to go to the toilet. Now he is nearly 7 months and doesn't need the juice anymore because he has plenty of fruit and veg which help him so he just has water to drink. You can only try it if it doesn't help then you could try just water. Good luck X|`|Gj5WkwG4aa	Its all right to start solids to your loved one as far as it does not lead to any allergies. Pediatricians tell that before 6 months solids intake may cause food allergies in babies. Observe whether she develops any skin rash. If everything is ok, you can continue. <br>  Juice, its too early. Acids in Juice may cause gastric irritation. Mothers milk is provided with enormous pure water. Just after feeding cereal, breast-fed her a little. While eating cereal if at all she feels discomfort while swallowing, make the solid little thin, add water. <br>  Remember water should be boiled and brought to little warm.<br>  Dont even depend upon your mom's words completely rather discuss among yourselves with reasoning and also take a children specialists guidence. Its worth a lot!<br>  Happy days with your Sweety!|`|1hciyvKdaa	The normal start times are given for serveral different reasons. They are adjusted to a babys system, so its not overburdernded too soon. Juices too early robs them of breastmilk or formul and onty those should be given. Its not about convience its about nutrition. So not to other foods, no to juice, never give water either. <br>  Get a guide online, or a book to follow, its not guesses it best known methods, to ensure the baby is eating healthy for its appropriate age. Cearal is the only food most pds will allow early if at all. Formula needs to be the full meal, cereal is for after the baby has taken all the breastmilk available and or bottled milk. there are many many nipples for bottles, find one she likes, it can try your patience, but in parenting we do whats the right thing, so you need to get her use to a botlle if shes not filling up on you. Please, take the time to discuss this with your pediatrician intead of altering her nutrition ok. Juices when they start getting introduced way later on, is when the possibility of diaper rashes start, so dont wish that on the baby sooner than it needs to be, and if she gets rashes, you stop feeding it that juice, and once cleared up, start a different juice and wait a week to see if that gives a rash. Its a well known fact that juices do not do all that much for infants as far as nutrition. Even toddlers dont benefit from it as they do a simple glass of water if given too much.|`|r7q8LW7Aaa	I wouldn't bother with the juice - it has no nutritional value for babies and can upset their tummies. Breastfed babies don't need any other fluids as breastmilk is so high in water. Also, it can be damaging for their teeth - even if they haven't cut through yet!<br>  If you feel she needs it, offer some water, but only in a sippy cup and never a bottle.

fa0dd5777a3c1d7f167867babbfebd0baa	Yes it's very annoying. Just because someone is pregnant doesn't give anyone the right to touch you...like it's a free pass for a free feel lol. With my first baby, people always asked me was it twins or did I have the baby yet. It was so stupid. Sometimes it's just best to keep your mouth shut but maybe they won't understand until they've gone through it. Go figure (: Congrats on your 2nd pregnancy!!|`|Cx5Zo7IIaa	I would just look at people and say Excuse you! I also have a t-shirt that said Touch Me and Gain a Stump! I wore this frequently during my last two months because everyone wants to touch your belly like it's good luck or something.|`|u00IalCZaa	yeah and it will get worse.|`|1tmX7xbRaa	it drives me crazy. one time i was at the mall and about 5 different people that i didn't know rubbed my stomach by the 6 person i said 'my belly is NOT community property'...i even told someone once 'why are your rubbing my belly im not pregnant' (even though i was) the lady was offended but i didn't give a crap. i don't know why people think that just because you are pregnant they have a right to touch you. with my first daughter she was about 6 weeks old and we were in walmart picking up diapers and some weird scary looking guy touched my daughters head. (she was in her car seat in the cart) and i flipped out so bad the guy practically ran away. people are dumb.|`|xue72D76aa	I think what I hated worse than the random belly rubs (which I absolutely hated) was this one particular time when an acquaintance practically put her head in my lap when I was sitting and started talking to the baby.  She called herself "Aunt" to my baby, too.  Since I had my daughter (nearly 6 months ago), I've seen this person once (demonstrates how "close" we were, rofl!).<br>  <br>  I was 10 days late with my daughter and the phone calls from family members drove me up a wall.  "Did you have the baby yet?"  It was hard enough being overdue than to have everyone calling every single morning to point out that I was overdue.|`|IXgPHYbDaa	haha<br>  <br>  ive seen people go up to strangers and rub there tummy and asking if its a boy or a girl.<br>  <br>  its just an excuse to touch the person..because theres no need to touch her stomach.<br>  <br>  its very pervertish.<br>  <br>  I once saw a pregnent girl punch a guy for doing that. It was funny, and everyone that saw it said that the girl did the right thing.<br>  <br>  not appropriate to touch a strangers stomach just because she's pregnent.<br>  <br>  Please dont let people do this to you, its rude, if its a girl its not as bad, but if a guy does it its very nasty.<br>  LOL|`|aaCMNSB2aa	lol It doesn't necessarily bother me now but when I was pregnant everything bothered me. You have every right to feel that way. You're caring 20+ pound extra with you every where you go. You can't sleep well and haven't seen your feet in weeks, I can sympathies. Plus, just because your pregnant doesn't mean your personal bubble has popped.<br>  <br>  --Hang in there, CutieNiki|`|jJ9JGCNTaa	I've never been pregnant.But my mom  had that all the time.And i asked her that same question"mom?doesn't that get anoiying?She looked at me smiled and said"no,because that's their way of saying "congragulations im honored" so that's why i don't get offensive" then i said wow mom i never thought of it that way" and then i thought to appreciate it when the day i get pregnant|`|SHQHnKfcaa	I was the same way too!<br>  My son weighed ten pounds and six oz's so you could imagine how big i was too, i actuall slaped a waitress at texas road house for rubbling my belly.<br>  <br>  I said do I F****** know you?<br>  <br>  We ended up getting a different waitress....lol.<br>  <br>  Top it off when he was born, no one was aloud to touch him until he was about 4 months old.<br>  <br>  Thats just a good mom instinct and don;t let anyone tell you different either|`|Nj36OUPFaa	iv never had a kid but yea it would probably bug me a lot too.. and guys stop being jerks.|`|nOmX8XGUaa	mum didnt need to worry about that, i was very kickin' in the womb. hehehe|`|MJD81Frnaa	Ya I hated it wen that hapened|`|a162de189aa1c1becbdbb0cd4b7cd67caa	GAH i hated that!!!<br>  like seriously, get your hand off MY belly.<br>  <br>  hehe altho i got a lady back when i was grocery shopping once *about 7-8 months along* and this woman (about late 20's i'd say) came up to me and started rubbing my belly and asked me when i was due.  I had had enough of people thinking my belly was free game, so *giggles* i told her when i was due as i put my hand on her belly and began rubbing it, and told her that it looked like we were going to go at the same time.  OMG the look on her face was PRICELESS!!  haha.  and obviously she wasn't preggers, she weighed like 115 tops and had no belly at all, but she got the point real fast  xD|`|dvK45AVNaa	I agree, to an extent.. I've never had strangers do it, but it's the people I know that do it to me, that bothers me!<br>  <br>  My aunt even wanted to lift up my shirt to "look at my belly" I was like "WOAH THERE"<br>  <br>  It was too close for comfort.|`|AA10217725	i am 11 eleven weeks now and waiting to get huge. i will love to show off my huge belly. even now i feel great when my husband and sometimes my little neice rubs me. but anybody touching me??? I am not going to allow.|`|C9to8Oleaa	yea, i understand.....but I found the hemorrhoids a lot worse.......roflmao|`|baC3UdzHaa	it would drive me nuts with my nipples lactating....|`|ZhrL1Vszaa	Yeah I hated that, random ppl felt it was ok to rub my belly, b/c I was pregnant lol i slapped so many ppl, u know what i sucks is when ur in ur third trimester & ur can't eat anymore food b/c there's no more room, even though ur still hungry, hehe  I don't miss being pregnant 1 bit|`|pFs71HsHaa	Yes.  I had someone ask the same question when I was 8 months along and had a short fuse and felt like I was all stomach, and I said very flatly, "Yes I did, I'm just fat". I loved the look on their face.<br>  <br>  Please people, ask before rubbing a pregnant woman's belly. Your rudeness might be the thing that pushes them over the edge and no telling what they may say to you.
BOXrOvhcaa	Try to use this ovulation calendar tool.   http://www.softorbits.com/awc/   to trace your cycle and find the date of ovulation|`|4DoXomHZaa	It sounds like the LH is just taking a while to leave your body. They say that a + is anything the same color or darker---the 1st day it happens. It can be 48 hours past the 1st + when you ovulate, so it is very possible to have leftover LH 3 days later.    Of course you should have sex. Why not? The more sperm the better.|`|L982MxUvaa	I BD the day b4 I got my positive on my ovulation test and like 4 or 5 days, everyday after that. Good Luck!|`|xJwLz0Mzaa	Wow...this would make me soooo not enjoy the process...I have 5 children. The most effective way is to throw away all them expensive tests and sticks buy a cheap bottle of wine, have a glass with dinner each night and have sex..ONCE A DAY! do the deed on a daily basis, and quit trying so hard and you'll probably get pregnant. They stress and worrying can inhibit your fertility...let it go. Have sex daily to have live sperm in your womb at all times and it's bound to happen.|`|3cb62302162a20112ee2f4eb8f66e90eaa	When I got pregnant I ovulated for 4 days....Nov 1, 2, 3and 4th.......sooooo go for it and have fun (SMILES). TONS and TONS of BABY DUST!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
IPl3Yh1kaa	No time @ all. Make all natural food & try not to eat out of a box or bag ever (ex: want potato chips? skin a tater and fry it, don't buy lays. Want some juice?  make homemade lemonade or spice up your water with a squeeze of lemon, lime, orange etc. Don't buy tropicana). Portion sizes and 3 sensible meals a day help as well.    I had my son 9 weeks ago. By the time he was 11 days old I had lost 25lbs (i gained 32 total). Now I have 3-4 more lbs to loose and it looks like I never had a baby @ all, and if I did certainly not 9 weeks ago.    I will not lie, I was, and still am, very hard on myself. I take a class @ the gym @ least 3-4 days a week ( i mix it up) and make all my meals at home    Hope tis helped :-)|`|x7WphuY5aa	It usually takes a couple months but you have to eat right and exercise it sound easy but its not i gained more weight after then during because the first month you are just getting used to the new schedule but if you don't lose the weight is will be a lot harder later so give it all you got and try to breastfeed|`|4DoXomHZaa	You only need  to eat 500 more calories breastfeeding than you would not pregnant to maintain the weight you have. A healthy intake would be 2500 calories while breastfeeding.    You have to short yourself 3500 calories in order to lose one pound.|`|b4b9263f561119d96f1e2a9ffeab2863aa	Well a lot depends on how much weight you gained during pregnancy.  I have had 5 children.  I gained too much with my first and it took about a year.  With the second and third I gained about 20lbs and was back in my clothes right after having them.  In fact I wore my regular clothes home fro the hospital.  With my third (which was a girl the rest were boys)  I gained weight in different areas that made it more difficult to loose.  In fact I kept on an extra 5 pounds after her birth.  My last I had at 38.  I did find it more difficult this time around and I am still trying to get rid of the 7 lbs that are remaining.  You are already on the right track with the breast feeding.  Just try to get up and move. If you d not have time to actually exercise.  And well try to eat well.  Everyone is different and every pregnancy is different.  You could always try a baby and me work out video or class if offered in your area.|`|IZhsP1kWaa	You should plan on it taking the same amount of time it took to gain the weight, to lose the weight.I found I lost a lot of weight when I was breastfeeding. It will happen, don't worry & don't panic about it, its natural after having a baby..there are no quick fixes,just enjoy your new baby, eat right & exercise! Good luck!!    p.s   walks are a great way to get some exercise & baby will love it too!
vue9NOhYaa	You aren't going to have any symptoms this early anyway.  Until the egg implants (usually 6-10 days after conception) your body doesn't even know that anything has changed, so you can't have symptoms.    Once you DO start having symptoms  (usually around the time your period is due) sore nipples are just one of many possible symptoms.  Some women have them, some don't. Some women have no symptoms at all until several weeks after the missed period.     (BTW,  you are only 'ovulating' for a moment.  The release of the egg is 'ovulation.'  But your fertile window lasts for several days, from the days leading up to ovulation until about 24 hours after the egg is released.)|`|nqR7CQ4gaa	Yes, you can still be pregnant if your boobs/nipples dont hurt...although I dont think they would start hurting this soon anyways. Best Wishes!|`|AA10186411	My nipples have never hurt, and I gave birth to a beautiful daughter.  Ok well they hurt after birth, but not when I was pregnant.  But if they are going to hurt, they would not hurt this quickly.|`|4DoXomHZaa	If you did conceive last night or today, it will be 5-12 days before the egg even implants into the uterus and begins to make the pregnancy hormone which is what causes symptoms.    If you do have nipple pain as a symptom it would not be until later. It does not happen instantly.|`|x7WphuY5aa	it takes most people longer to know have any Signs but everyone symptoms arnt the same so yours might not hurt mine didn't until i started producing milk|`|1z3C0R2Vaa	yes you can still be and your nipples don't have to hurt.|`|aJTBF7opaa	Every women is different, every pregnancy is different, some women have no symptoms at all until they miss there period, i didn't. And my breast or nipples didn't begin to hurt until i was 15 weeks prego.|`|L982MxUvaa	My nipples never really hurt that much when I was first pregnant.. .they were maybe just a lil sore here and there.  When u conceive they may start getting sore around 6 weeks, maybe  a lil sooner. Mine are just not getting really sore and I'm 14 weeks.

Your uterus is still below your pelvic bone and the baby isn't even the size of a blueberry, I believe it's the size of a kidney bean.

q1KSTbqnaa	yes it's mainly youngsters who haven't even got pregnant yet haha. they think about their own image first and not whether it will be sensible and logical spelling etc. all those people who were christened with a weird spelt name , i feel sorry for you , because people never spell your name right even when you stand in front of them and actually spell it out.  from a very boring named person ( but at least it never gets spelt wrong )|`|AXEp1Bu6aa	I live in Scotland too (in the east) and I know more people who have middle names that aren't any relatives than ones that do. My middle name is Karis, and my parents chose it because they liked it and wanted it to be a bit different but not too crazy. I like middle names even though they are never really used. I just like it when your child has done something naughty and you can call them by their full name, as strange as it is, I think it's quite cool. I think the obsession with middle names now is because people have more and more names they like and want to use them all on the few kids they have, meaning more and more kids will have 2,3 or maybe 4 middle names. I like middle names that are simple, maybe 4 or 5 letters long.<br>  Good luck with your question!|`|qfCRWAw0aa	Hmmm.... yeah it seems like everyone wants to give their child a middle name for the sake of giving them one. <br>  <br>  When i have kids they will be given middles names of their grandparents like you said.

Over obsessing about a child's name could stem from hating your name your whole life or something of that sort. Your name is a big deal...before you see the person you get an idea of that person just from their name alone. I know its wrong to do this but it happens everyday.|`|RL8y3xGXaa	in truth, middle names are never used, and "original" spelling can often cause hassle and confusion. i get your point.|`|57LFRfqCaa	So true - I admit I have a bit of a laugh when they insist that the first and middle names must flow together - what?  Who ever gets called by both their names when they are adults?|`|Oz4iblUEaa	The Tradition here is to give children middle names. I know alot of people who their middle names dont have nothing to do with anyone else! And now it is even common to use the middle name more..Like me I adopted 4 of my kids I did not want to change their first names as I felt that is the name their bio mom gave them and they will hold that dear to them all their lifes! So my kids go by first and middle names alot!  I guess I just did not mind my name cause all my friends knew mine and I knew theirs..And still do! And now onto the uncommon names well some of us don't like names we know every kid in the class will be named! Even my sons teacher told us it is just to hard. His name is Brandon and there is 5 others in just his classroom..So yes Brandon was wayyyyyyyy over used and still is! So his teacher uses first and middle names as 2 of them have the same last name and no they are not family..But it is smith and how common is that! So I Guess Im all for parents naming their kids what they feel fits their child rather it came from a family name or their own heart!|`|jIcaRrjnaa	i have given both my sons middle names as i was so grateful for the support of both grandmothers gave me at the time of my pregnancy and after they were born. as they were both boys it felt strange giving them Anne or Margaret so i gave them their maiden names as middle names and i don't care if they dont rhyme !! <br>  <br>  <br>  Kieran Lee my first son after paternal granny.<br>  Ben Matheson my 2nd son after maternal granny.|`|dAKgZr7Xaa	Sorry, but most of these new fangled names have gotta be better than those hilarious hippy ones, like "Amy Sunshine Blatterbum Haxxxr", that's one some hippy folk i knew next door, christened their daughter with, i suppose she can keep it a secret!!<br>  <br>  Hey, forget Adonis, do checkout Marianas photography, its blimming awesome.  You may not get another chance before she becomes wildly famous, (and snobby ? Lol! )<br>  <br>  Peace people, live well ! !|`|3AfQ9UXYaa	I really get your point. My middle name is only used (along with my first name) when my mom is yelling/lecturing me but that is rare.

I personally like them because I have always hate my first name, but I liked my middle name and wanted people to call me by my middle name.  Yes the first name and the middle name have to sound right together. Example, you wouldn't name your daughter JANELLE JANE, it dosen't sound right, JANELLE MARIE sonds much prettier.  p.s. not my name by the way.|`|eabe4c3a6e53ede1a2078c8d7dfcf4b7aa	I see no problem with middle names, but you are right..they are rarely ever used...ever..even here in the States. I don't know the tradition behind it but when giving my children middle names I will only use family names...Jacob has his dad's name as his middle... Jacob Christopher. Our next and last will either be Nora Diane (Diane after both our moms...my husband's having passed in 2000) or Joseph Michael (Michael is my brother). Middle names are great when you want to incorporate a family name into their name, especially when the name would never work as a first name in modern times (take my grandfather Birdger for example...would never ever work as a good first name these days but would work as a middle name should I want to ever use it)<br>  <br>  I do hate the odd spelling of traditional names though like Jakob...it will just make it harder on the poor kid later in life..|`|RE6GBw0Baa	lol middle names dont bother me and yea i agree with the american things.....i hate names that look like a scabble board threw up lol <br>  <br>  im a fan of less used names as opposed to 'different names' i think my child may have 2 middle names, 1 from a grandparent and myabe just 1 i like.<br>  <br>  my middle names are after my nan and moms best friend lol xxxxx|`|e663a3eea9acd94ea0c82d74d58bb3cbaa	I see where your coming from, but obviously middle names aren't that big of deal where you live, but some places it is.|`|IuzaNq2Uaa	Personally I think it just sounds better if the two names sound good together.<br>  <br>  And I came from a Scottish-heritage family who "didn't bother" with a middle name, and I have always felt the lack. It was horrible as a child - other children do ask your middle name (kids seem to go through a middle name craze around the start of puberty) and when I said "Nothing" they just figured it must be something so hideous I was refusing to say it. As an adult it was a bureaucratic hassle as forms assume everyone has a middle name, and when I didn't put anything they'd ask me to please go back and fill it out PROPERLY. It also led to a few instances where I found it hard to prove who I was.<br>  <br>  My husband and I intend to make our children aware of their middle names and make them a part of their identity.<br>  <br>  I remember when I was growing up, my best friend's mother would use her middle name all the name - she often called her the full Jodi Marie on important occasions or to emphasize a point and I envied that. Although my friend just had a "filler" middle name, she loved it and it was important to her.<br>  <br>  I'm not an American, so it isn't just an American thing.|`|ZbZnIcoIaa	Amen to that.<br>  <br>  It's a cultural thing, I don't get it. I've always been one for more classical names. I have a few exceptions ( I like the idea of colors as names, like I'm about to read a novel where the main character is named Blue) <br>  <br>  But I have some friends with pretty ridiculous names because of this phenomenon. Secret? Wideline? Amarillis? I know a guy named Adonis Adonis actually. Yes. His first and last name. A girl I know is about to name her son Achilles. Actually I think she gave birth recently- so she already has.<br>  <br>  I personally am Mariana Teresa... I think it's after my aunt on my father's side, but I don't keep in touch with him and he's not spoken about so I'm not so sure. And Mariana Teresa is also a classical combination in the Latin world.<br>  <br>  Oh trust me- Adonis is not that interesting. He always skips class too... naughty boy he is.

bTXsr5JWaa	I am the same height as you and I am around 130lbs... I am not fat as I can wear size 10s and my doctor says I am the perfect weight for my build and height... You are nearly 30lbs lighter than me which means you are not fat either.  You even sound like you could be a little underweight.<br>  <br>  I think that you should worry about the possibility of an eating disorder.  If you carry on like this you will make yourself ill.  Anorexia carries all sorts or problems such as kidney failure and your periods might stop and you might not be able to have children.<br>  <br>  I feel sad when I hear stories of girls that feel like you do, as I used to worry about being fat all the time.  I know how hard it is to be a girl today.  Please go to your doctor and get him/her to check you out.  You should also be eating 3 meals a day, not one. x|`|auKBPfpDaa	You're fine.  At 14 I was 5'2" and 107...you're doing great by comparison.  But if you're serious about this then I'm guessing you have some kind of eating disorder, probably anorexia.  I understand the anxiety that you have around this...I have weight loss anxiety, although it can no longer be called anorexia, because I eat normally at the insistence of my boyfriend.  <br>  Make your one meal a day breakfast, as that will give you the best metabolism boost, and consider snacking on low calorie fruits and vegetables (pickles have no calories and a strong taste) to help your body feel like you're eating for the rest of the day.  <br>  Please be aware that the lowest healthy weight for someone of your age and height is about 85, and that's pushing it by a few percentile points. (89 is technically the lightest you can be without being underweight).   Don't go under that, or you risk both health problems and being institutionalized and tube fed.  <br>  I really do understand what you're going through, and if you ever want to talk, you can email me.|`|cj29AORfaa	i'm 5'3-5'4 and i weigh 128 pounds. if you feel fat then i'm a....i don't wanna go there. anyway exercise and diet is all i can think of as a way to lose weight in a healthy way.|`|FMIIAJOFaa	first dont eat oilly food,then drink atleast 10 glasses of water daily and then take a glass of warm water add honey with it and drink in early morniing when you wake up in empty stomach this will make you thin dear|`|SFSaf0C4aa	eating one meal a day is going to make you gain weight rather than lose it, as your body will think that is all you are going to get, which means it will then store the fat from the food.<br>  if you really want to lose weight, then you have to have 3 balanced meals a day and play soccer.<br>  you're not overweight by any means and you shouldn't feel like you have to be thinner because everyone else is. your bmi is actually underweight, so you have NO need to lose any weight. if you feel fat, maybe go and see someone about it, you probably just feel fat because you have muscle from soccer which you feel makes you look bigger than everyone else.<br>  muscle is good!|`|AA12312280	hi, <br>  Becoming Fat is nothing to do with ur eating, <br>  <br>  there are lots of factor which make the body fat, <br>  <br>  you dont became fat in one month or two month, <br>  nearly two year take to became the fat, <br>  <br>  same way to became thin also it will take time, <br>  and if you dont eat the food then again that will creat to another problem<br>  so pls eat the food atleast two time a day, <br>  you need to study about the digestive system, then i think you can <br>  manage urself ... <br>  actually in this short note <br>  i cannot explain you how to make your body thin, <br>  lets see i can write an essay about this mater<br>  <br>  thanks for putting this question|`|coGjlS9iaa	In my opinion I really don't think you should loss more weight.<br>  Really, it dosen't matter if everyone else is thin, live your life for who you are.  I hope this helps.|`|rRhni8kyaa	Do skipping.You will lose weight and may gain height. I do skipping for about 20-30 minutes daily and i am 5'4 weighing 48Kg.|`|X9JSlC6Iaa	103? Girl you are so skinny. Don't loose more weight, you will get a eating disorder.|`|kc2Sa7ibaa	I am also 14. I am 5"2 and more or less the same weight (give or take). That is ridiculous! You are no-where NEAR fat. Trust me - I have poor self esteem. When I look in the mirror I see bulging thighs and a stomach that sticks out but at the end of the day when people see me I look sickly thin.. I NEARLY had anorexia at one stage.. It was really scary - don't go down that path.<br>  <br>  Eating 1 meal a day? That is just stupid. You need this energy. I decided it would be good to stop eating as well. You know what happened? I passed out and was admitted to hospital. I urgently suggest to re-evaluate your self esteem.
QnJvJ67uaa	I am also stuck in a village with no transport...I feel your pain LOL.<br>  2 is old enough to play DENS!!! drape sheets over chairs and fill with cushions, books and toys....hide in it together, have a picnic in it, make up stories about it....shut the curtains and turn on a torch on the other side and giver her a shadow show.<br>  <br>  or<br>  <br>  make some krispie cakes, she can help mix it all in and put them in the cases and eat them in the den !!<br>  <br>  or <br>  <br>  Have a really long bath session....turn it into a paddling pool, lots of toys, pretend to be at the beach and leave of the soap and shampoo...just let her splash about and have fun. (You should bring a book lol)<br>  <br>  Hope that given you a couple of ideas, have a fun day :) x|`|wHOQXToHaa	Does she like fingerpaints maybe? Let it be a messy day. Playdoh contests, sticker fun, buy a simple board game and let her "play". My son likes to help mommy by "vacuuming" and things. When he wants a bath if you put a couple drops of food coloring in it (like 3-4) it will change the water colors and then make up a name for the bath. For example, my son has green baths & we call them monster baths. Fish baths for blue,  Elmo baths for red, etc. It's a ton of fun and he thinks it's so cool.|`|ErmcT4uUaa	I would take him to the Airport and let him watch the baggage go round and round on the baggage claim.<br>  Kids love that kind of thing.

5DJcir9saa	I've never actually miscarried but I thought that if you miscarried you'd have severe cramping, not just blood.  I also heard you bleed heavy continually, not just heavy and light like you have been.  The reason it might be heavy is because you are on bedrest so any bleeding that occurs will pool up until you get up.  Like when you're on your period and its really heavy in the morning after laying down sleeping all night.|`|eRlNQxbNaa	I know what you are going through! I started bleeding very lightly at six weeks.  I called my OB and he said that it could be normal.  The next day I started bleeding more heavily and I went to the ER.  They checked my hcg levels and they were very high, but when they did a scan they couldn't see anything except the yolk sac.  The radiologist said that the sac looked irregular and had blood around it and that I would most likely miscarry over the weekend.  I was told to come in for some more bloodwork and an appt. with my OB the next week.  Over the weekend I kept bleeding and even passed a small clot.  It was so awful! I still felt pregnant and was just devastated.  When I went to my OB the next week he wanted to schedule me for a D&C since he was convinced it was a blighted ovum.  I demanded one more scan.  There was the baby, beating heart and all!  He is now four months and very happy and healthy.  Moral of the story... don't stress out too much.  Take it easy and keep a postive mind set.  I am convinced that this saved my pregnancy!    Wait for your blood test results.  I know it's hard and how sad you feel, but try to relax!  Doctors don't know everything.    I wish you the best of luck!!!! :)|`|SRIaRm08aa	It isn't necessarily a miscarriage.  Everyone is different and differnent things happen to them when they are pregnant.  For Example:  I went to the ER a few weeks ago with the same problem (bleeding, and brown spotting). My hcg levels were in the 150,000s. They did a sonogram and were able to hear the baby's heart (you may not be as far along as you think and sometimes at 6wks you cannot hear the heartbeat yet).  They said that my bleeding was coming from something called Placenta Abruptio where the placenta becomes slightly detached and you can have a small hemorage of blood that must come out.  I spotted for a week and then bled again when I called my obgyn.  She too did a sonogram and came up with the same conclusion. She said that it can heal on its own sometimes and ordered me strict bedrest. I also have to come into see her every week and take progesterone pills (talk to your dr about getting on them).  They said that everything should be fine but I need to take it easy.  Of course, things can always happen and go wrong and if so there usually isnt much that anyone can do about it.    My obgyn said she blead heavily through pads when she was pregnant with her twins and it scared her to death. Fortunately she has two healthy little boys and everything turned out okay.  So everyone is different. Sometimes it is bad, sometimes it is good, and sometimes you just have to wait it out and pray.  I advise you to seek the advice of your obgyn and talk to them about progesterone pills which are just hormones that can help.  I wish you the best and keep your head held high and fight for your baby.  Don't give up and get down.  Let your body rest and call your doctor. They should be able to get you in the same day or next whenever you tell them that you are pregnant and bleeding.
T1hZG4O3aa	Your baby shouldnt cry for more than 10 minutes at any given time without you trying to console him. I did let my daughter cry it out at time because you cant just carry your child all the time because the are crying. It doesnt work and you will never get anything done in life that way. You have to be productive at some point. I used music, and sounds to soothe my daughter to sleep. Not everything worked and the "suggested" material did not work for her. She wanted something that most people cant sleep to but that worked for her, you have to try everything. Keep a routine, dinner, bath, massage, night clothes and bed.  If you let your baby sleep with you for a long time it will make it harder for them to sleep on their own. My daughter slept in her crib from day one. Some nights she had to sleep in a rocker or swing but 6 out of 7 nights she was in her crib. It your baby has to be entertained to sleep try something like tickling and then put him in his crib. You can tell if you baby is screaming in pain or screaming because he just wants to be held, there are times to give in and times not to give in. My daughter is almost three and she is very independant because we didnt give in all the time. She still has routines ans schedules that we follow very well. Its not easy so dont stress and remember its ok to cry yourself. There isnt much as far as training your baby to go to sleep, its more of sticking to a simple routine and not giving in very often or he will learn what gets you in the room. Babies are not dumb, they are very smart, they use what works just as we do, they are just simple. You are doing nothing wrong and just ignore people who assume you are letting him scream for hours. Good luck and I hope I helped.|`|pXSKSS3daa	Why do you think he HAS to settle himself? Furthermore, why do you think he needs "sleep training"?    He's only six months old. It's very normal for him to need help settling and to need to be comforted. Are you wanting this out of pure convenience for yourself? If so, that's a bit selfish. Comfort your baby, rock your baby, do whatever needs to be done to help him settle at night. There is nothing wrong with it and as a mother you should have instincts instilled in you that says "This is wrong, there must be something else BETTER to help my baby." Don't push your baby to be so independent at a young age, you're going to miss it when he's older and doesn't need you so much.|`|BypjotRpaa	YOU DO WHAT YOU FEEL IS RIGHT!!!    with that said ...i catch flack for my parenting also..  first make sure you setup the room, i use a humidifier for white noise and a lullaby cd, to soothe..  make sure your baby is tired and start your routine around the same time every night..  bath, jammies, book, and bottle..hugs and kisses and tell him good night lay him down and walk away.. wait 5 minutes, go in and settle him and lay him down again,wait 7 minutes and repeat..  the first night is always the worst.. it took my son 20 min. before he finally went to sleep. the second night took 7 minutes. and the third night there was no fussing at all.|`|r7q8LW7Aaa	Instead of letting the poor mite scream himself to sleep - try this....  Leave him awake in his cot and leave the room. When he starts to whinge (NOT cry), go back in, try not to lift him, rub his tummy, arm, face, whatever sooths him. When he calms, walk out while he's awake. Continue doing that until he's asleep. It will take a while, but you should find that each night gets easier and easier and eventually you won't have to do anything but say goodnight.  Failing that, just help to settle him. Many babies that age need help and like someone else said, it is a little selfish to refuse him that. There is time when he's older and more understanding to do 'sleep training'. Please do not do controlled crying on a baby that age, it's cruel.|`|8PaWafCwaa	try wrapping him in a blanket so he feels secure and if he crys comforting him whilst he is in his bouncer or crib ect dont pick him unless he hungry or dirty and play with him once he is settled.|`|e49178f67a815a64799d8c1237b9affaaa	If done correctly this will NOT cause your baby psychological damage.  It is more cruel not to let your baby have the sleep they need.    Have a consistent bed-time routine eg dinner at 5pm, bath at 5.30 pm, bottle at 6pm, bed at 7pm.    After winding and cuddling set baby down in crib, (with something cuddly eg teddy) - sing the same bedtime song each night (eg Rock a Bye), and then kiss good night.  Close door.    If this is first time, baby will probably cry.  Go in after 5 mins - soothe baby for 1 or 2 mins.  Leave.  Wait 5 mins.  Repeat.  Can take as little as 15 mins and as much as an hour.  Very stressful on parents but you have to be consistent.  After a couple of days you will notice baby settles much quicker.  This is the blink of an eye in a baby's life.    Give baby lots of reassurance, love and cuddles.|`|3fR0sCd9aa	AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAHHHHHHHHHHHH no!!!!!!  There's a reason babies cry and to not answer can damage their poor little brains!! Go get the book the no cry sleep solution.  It's worked for alot of people and I think it can for you too.|`|Y8rQQKuVaa	This is a very touchy subject on here, so you'll probably get a few responses like the first one.     There are several methods out there. If you're really set on using controlled crying, I'd suggest reading up on some of the different theories and methods and choosing one that seems to suit you best. You may even want to modify it a little more to make it more comfortable for you. It's VERY hard.     Some of the methods include Ferber, BabyWise, and Weissbluth.     I've read the Ferber book and Healthy Sleep Habits, Happy Child (Weissbluth). I, personally, found a lot of good info in the latter. Even if you don't want to try his method, it'll help you understand more about sleep, your infant, and his capabilities.     Whatever you choose, you have to stay consistent. Good luck. It's hard to hear your baby cry and a lot of people will chastise you for it. Only you know what's best for you and your baby.    EDIT: There is a lot of research out there that says allowing your baby to cry causes psychological damage. You have to wade through it carefully. I noticed a recurring theme. These studies all talk about prolonged crying over long periods of time, such as weeks and months. Even the Sears link people tend to give that gives several excerpts from different studies state that it happens over weeks/months. As long as you give your child love and attention everyday and meet all of his needs, then I think (my opinion) your child will be fine. So many of us have parents that come from the generation that said, "Crying helps a baby's lungs develop." We're not all psychologically damaged!
XwrjRj52aa	Wow, hello first person that answered, you are clueless. I live in a small town right now too, you want to know how far away the mall is?

GfG6wupTaa	Do NOT listen to the person who told you to bathe!! Just try to relax, rest up( you are going to need it) going for a walk might help. The baby will come when it is ready. Good luck and enjoy motherhood!!!!!!|`|MtC3CWZraa	I was due yesterday and go back to the doc tomorrow to find out if I need to be induced this weekend due to fluid and/or placenta issues or if I'm healthy enough to go another week. Bad as it sounds, I'm hoping there is a need to induce now!<br>  <br>  I guess my consolation is that the worst case scenario is that I'll be headed to the hospital a week for now for an induction.|`|M5fRd5v5aa	awwh poor you good luck hunny baby will be here soon<br>  go for a long walk<br>  have a hot bath  both of these things help to bring on labour =D<br>  <br>  <br>  good luck and make sure you have plenty of rest as when the baby comes you'll be grateful to get 5hours!!!!<br>  <br>  xoxo jessie xox|`|f6d23f05020d008e311e1a8124ad390eaa	There are few things in life that drag on as badly as an overdue pregnancy. You just want it to come OUT!!!! I've been there, and I get it. That's pretty much how every women who is overdue feels. Every day is like an eternity. Most doctors won't let women go past 1-2 weeks of their due date these days, so chances are you'll be induced if you're little darling doesn't make it's move pretty quickly. I know going into labor naturally is normally best, but there are also risks that come with letting a pregnancy go on for too long, so you'll have to weigh those options with your doc/midwife. Good luck.|`|Zdp0GlyUaa	Aww poor you Im 26 weeks pregnant and feel like I've been pregnant forever so have no idea how you much feel, Hope your baby comes into the world soon good luck x|`|N0o5sudDaa	omg!

BUT can I give you some advice? Don't be induced!!!! I did with my first when I was 10 days over basically because I have no patience, but I would NEVER do it again!!! just let nature do its thing!!<br>  <br>  Good luck x
sbfm5rCAaa	Every baby is different and moves at different rates. Some babies are less active than others.<br>  <br>  You will also find that you baby will move more at certain times of the day (like my baby is exceptionally active at night but I barely feel anything during the day).<br>  <br>  Don't panic too much about it. You baby could just be less active. So long as the heartbeat is fine and the baby is growing healthy then there is nothing to worry about.|`|Z7dKEJcgaa	I posted an almost identical question yesterday, although I am a little behind you as I am 30 weeks 2 days.  Just to let you know you are not alone on this one, it worries me a little too.  Also, my baby is always on the right hand side, I am have still never felt any kicks on the left through my entire pregnancy.  Apparently they are just starting to run out of room in there. :)|`|xYHyTJY9aa	OK ... maybe its just you panicking but if you are really unhappy about the number of kicks you feel ... call your midwife.   Honestly they don't mind having conversations to put you at ease.  A happy and healthy mum is better for baby than a stressed one.   So make that call.|`|KOwzDLPdaa	He's running out of room to kick as much as he used to. Its perfectly normal.|`|AA12395149	You want to feel his movements when you think he is typically active.  Drink a tall glass of water and some juice, lie on your left side and feel for your baby to move.  You should do this with minimal distractions, because some of those movements can by missed.  As long as you feel him move six times in an hour, he's great.  If an entire hour goes by and he hasn't moved four times, you need to be evaluated.|`|AaY0Xmduaa	his probably sleeping.|`|WvWFmwQoaa	im 32 weeks as well|`|5ZvALiclaa	baby is running out of room by now too so that has to be taken into consideration<br>  <br>  try laying down for one hour and counting every little movement. if he continually does less than 10movements an hour then mention it to the doctor but if he still moves then don't worry

But I think Sabrina Margaret is better in this case because it flows better with your other daughter's name.  Keira and Sabrina... adorable.  And Brie is a cute nickname.    But to give the first daughter a serene, more feminine-sounding name... and then the second daughter a more serious, not-so-girly name... kind unfair for when they play games of "princess and queen" later on.    I'm just sayin... from a child's level of thinking.  :-)|`|G4i6DcZDaa	I prefer Gwendolyn over Gwyneth but Sabrina is ok|`|G0s5uxrEaa	I love the name Gwyneth Margaret, it's so pretty! :)|`|U1juqahIaa	I love Sabrina Margaret.

MJR4Om7taa	The pill isn't reliable, i know a lot of people who got pregnant on the pill, my sister included.<br>  <br>  Their is an implant in your arm you can get, that is the best method, get your doctor to give you the implant. You wont be able to have sex tonight though as it takes a few days to arrange the implant.<br>  <br>  The implant will last for a year, or more, depending which you go for, it will mess your period cycle up though<br>  <br>  That covers preganancy, now just make sure neither of you have STDs|`|MtC3CWZraa	It sounds like you're asking about birth control pills. You have to be on those for a solid month before they're effective.|`|ZHkhNY0Saa	ok theres the morning after pill which you could take after you do this but for safety buy it the day your going to do it so you can take the pill the next day in the morning tell the pharmasist you have already done it so he will sell it to you <br>  or go to the drs to get this for free the next day if you can get an appointment that is mine takes like a week so no good!!<br>  it is great there is also a less safe method but you could use the withdrawel method where he comes outside of your bodyi use this and im not pregnant yet but there is always a chance for premature ejaculation and your unlikely to know!<br>  good luck and enjoy its amazing!<br>  beware you will want to do this way everytime so get on the pill for this!|`|3BB8Gn0taa	Truthfully, if you are both having sex tonight, I have to say you are very safe as far as pregnancy is concerned. Std's are a different matter though.|`|8Loq9Skraa	It is a very intimate time the first time and it does feel great but be careful cause there is a good chance you could fall preggas.  Also is he clean? STD's!|`|AA12395149	Your last period on the 11th makes for a fairly good chance of getting pregnant.  Sperm can survive in the woman for a few days which would put you right near ovulation.  You should hold off on sex without condoms until you've been on some kind of birth control for three months.  If you've been going this long, what the harm in using condoms a little longer?  The morning after pill is available and it is pretty effective, but the only thing that is 100% reliable is abstinence.  The morning after pill (aka plan B) should not really be used routinely for birth control, it really throws your hormones out of whack.  I strongly urge you to see your doctor or go to planned parenthood and get put on the pill, nuva ring, depo shot, or something like that.<br>  <br>  If you really are not ready to get pregnant and start a family, you really need to use condoms or have some form of contraception.  And no, pulling out is NOT effective.|`|ytGaDM7Haa	keep it within 5 days of the last day of your period (3 to be safer),  and 5 days before the start of your period. Day 14 is generally the most fertile day (day 1 being the first day of your period). Personally I would never take a pill, it can't be good trying to change the way your body works like that. <br>  But really, you should get married first. :)|`|Pp4F6D5Waa	Go to the docs and go on the pill then, you should really know all this being 18. Not being funny just true. I knew all this by 18.|`|8012427537078e29822bf1bd1e533dfaaa	Don't be so defensive, there is nothing wrong with sex. Notice that all of the grandparents got married at like 12-14? NE ways, the difference is notable, but don't expect much. I would say not to do it, because once you take the hat off, it almost never goes back on. Also, trust me the preggers and parenting thing can realllllyyyyyy suck. The pills don't work, trust me on this, like 2 times ok? LOL, so get you some gel (Nonoxynol-9) and combine it with a diaphragm, and threaten to go BOBBIT on him if he does not remove himself from your situation before he, well... you know.. makes a mess of things. Good luck, and I hope you both have multiple giant OG's!
2618b27ee1b1bc95bede9c4c3e930725aa	The best thing would be for you both to relax and de stress, don't put lots of pressure on each other and have fun! Surprise each other, do mad things together and just have lots of sex. There are no best positions for getting pregnant, any way works, but sometimes it helps to lie on your back with your legs up just afterwards for a few minutes xxx|`|1JGj56TFaa	My husband and I tried for around 2 years with both our children, hence a five year age gap!   We had all the tests done and nothing was wrong with us either.  Is there anything that you are worried or stressed about?  I had a few debts (and thanks to my father!!)  got them cleared, worries were gone and bam! pregnant the very next month.  I believe the major thing is to relax and put it to the back of your mind.  I know it can be so difficult to do, but id just about given up on getting preganant again and it happened.  We now have a beautiful boy and a beautiful baby girl!  Good luck.  It will happen x|`|XBTF1XvZaa	there is no need for you to be worried about, since all of you are okay just continued praying and wait for the right time to come.|`|lTLaQ5i9aa	relax|`|Bg6txvxqaa	your best best is to have sex every other day instead of every day so that the sperm has chance to re-generate, so to speak.<br>  <br>  All the best and baby dust to you!
ssDPdqZaaa	If you make sure you have an orgasm after he does. This makes your cervix muscles contact, this contracting will make your cervix "suck" a great deal moor of the sperm up into your uterus.  Obviously women do not need to orgasm to be impregnated, but it does help.<br>  It only took my husband and I, 2 months of trying with our second and one month with our third, to conceive.  We also made sure to have sex, using this method, a week before and after I ovulated. Sperm can live up to 7 days ( some Drs. say even 9) so it is very possible to get pregnant without having sex on the day of ovulation, It will also increase your chances of getting pregnant.<br>  Good luck!|`|KqloS80maa	have u ever tried pre seed , its like a lubricant that is suppose to keep sperm alive longer....the first month we used we got pregnant im now 34 weeks....u can buy it online for about 20 bucks good luck
AA11763588	I have a friend who has been dilated 3cm for almost 2 weeks now, has had 2 membrane sweeps and is still pregnant.<br>  <br>  Odds are you will go over your due date. Most women do.<br>  <br>  Good luck.. you're almost done!|`|eu6UQElYaa	With my first it took me about 1 1/2 weeks after I hit 1cm dilated.   With my second it only took me about 12 hours.   <br>  <br>  I'll guess and say I think you'll have it close to your due date.   Congrats and good luck.|`|1hciyvKdaa	On friday my daughter was 50 percent and 1 cm.  Tuesday she was 70 per cent and one centemeter. She lost her mucous plug Wed night late. Shes now spotting but no water leaking.  Shes been having contractions all week, she was going to go in tonight and see whats up, Ive heard nothing yet, so she may of decided to wait until this morning. Tuesday the Dr tried massaging her cervix, it hurt real bad for her, so shes not wanting anyone to do that again, poor kid. Good luck! oh by the way, her due date was the 12. <br>  I myself knew nothing about nothing until hard labor hit, so I cant commont on any of this.|`|1jwbQaZTaa	i was 1cm at 35 weeks, i credit that to my constant, daily walking at my job (i was a waitress). i stayed at 1cm and zero% effaced until 38 weeks, by then i was a 3 and still zero %. at exactly 39 weeks i had my membranes stripped as i was still a 3 but my doc felt it was time. she said, "if this works, it will work within 12 hours". that was at noon. at exactly midnight, twelve hours later, i went into labor and dilated from a 3 to a 10 in less than 20 minutes!<br>  p.s., just for fun... i think you will have the baby on the 25th. it feels right. haha|`|nhhCow4haa	i was 1cm dialated at 32 weeks, at 38 weeks i was 2.5cm dialated. At exactly 40 weeks i had a stretch and sweep and that night i went into labour, but labour stopped and then i went into labour again the next nigght. Honeslty everyone is different. <br>  <br>  My guess is going to be.... 3 march, 7lb 9oz :) boy..|`|eV7rtxmuaa	I went from 3cm dilated to 10cm dilated in half an hour.

Ah6FJHkWaa	First of all, I can relate to going through that fear that they may never have a child.  The best advice I can give is accept that somethings are out of our control, and accept that life may be childless.    Once I was able to do that, and got rid of much of my desperation, grieved properly, then I was able to adopt.  I suggest adopting from foster care, or even fostering itself.      I don't know the financial criteria.... I can tell you I don't have the greatest credit, was stupid when I was young.  I was never asked about my credit, but asked about assets and debts.  They just wanted to make sure I can financially support my children, and what my back up plans are if something should go wrong.    I would have your friend do a bit more research and grief counselling before moving forward with adoption.  Desperation can make people do crazy things.|`|iVcaB9h7aa	Here's a link to information on foster to adopt in Virginia. It includes this quote:    "Foster to adopt families are also desperately needed! "    Since your friends are in a tough financial situation, both international and domestic agency/private adoption will not be possible for them right now.  These types of adoptions have fees ranging from $10,000 - $30,000 and over.    I did not adopt from foster care, but many on this forum have and can give you guidance you can share with your friends.|`|pGkBnLj7aa	Adoption is great, there are tons of kids that need loving parents and a home. Fostering first is a good idea if their not sure because it helps them know whether what they have is enough. hope this helps =D|`|AA12127693	Fostering is WONDERFUL to give a child a home where there is none.  I will praise your friend for that, but I do want to stress that a foster or adopted child will not fill a void of having her own biological child, she should really do alot of research and a lot of reading.    Bad Credit - is not an issue as long as they can provide for the child - but no a credit check is not done.  They must have a room for the child - whether it's in a home they own, rent or apartment...
8zdPI8Qsaa	My son ate both and I didn't see much of a difference at all (and never heard about the complains either), but I did notice that once you got up into the meats it seemed like Beechnut would do more of a veggie with a bit of meat in it (like sweet potatoes and chicken) that still looked more orange like sweet potatoes, while Gerber's looked/smelled a lot more like chicken (offensively so... I had a hard time buying Gerber meats because they smelled so bad). That could all just be in my head though. My son never showed a preference.|`|n6XYYyoLaa	i have never tried jarred gerber food; so far we have only used beechnut...if u read the ingredients, u will see that it is only the veggie or fruit and water..no preservatives, coloring, etc..  i usually use beechnut cerealls, but had a coupon for gerber rice; i do like it a little better bc it is more flaky like oatmeal instead of powdery like beechnut.....i have never heard of anyone having a problem with beechnut; my dd eats it every day and is healthy as a horse|`|pXSKSS3daa	There is no "best".     Gerber may not cause 'stomach issues' for her baby but it may for others. Some may complain about Beechnut and others may love it. It just depends on your personal situation and baby. The only real difference between the two is the price.|`|lzivF4Idaa	i use both and dont see a difference.|`|r5R2nstRaa	whats best is what ever ever you baby can eat, and has no problems with. my cousin does the same thing to me about baby products. i just let her talk, and still do what i want. it doesn't matter to me. i do what i think is best for my baby. and no one can tell me but me!|`|vue9NOhYaa	The name on the label.      Beechnut uses fewer  fillers in its foods, but reading labels can allow you to buy Gerber foods that are also without fillers. (All stage one foods are pure 'foods'. It's only in the dinners and desserts that you'd start seeing differences.)|`|68c6B8dRaa	"Gerber and Heinz replace real food with water and thickening agents in many of their products for children over six months of age. Such adulterated products are nutritionally inferior to products made with more fruits and vegetables.    The single-ingredients foods made by all the companies differ only modestly as a result of adding somewhat different amounts of water. However, Gerber and Heinz add substantial amounts of water and thickening agents (flours and chemically modified starches) to more than half of their twenty-five most popular fruits, mixed and creamed vegetables, desserts, and dinners for babies over six months (second- and third-stage foods). Not only are those products a monetary rip-off, they are also nutritionally inferior to similar products made without fillers. Gerber and Heinz' bananas with tapioca, for example, contain less than half of the levels of nutrients found in their plain first-stage bananas. Gerber and Heinz' regular dinners, which contain at least two types of refined flour as thickeners, provide less than 50% of the nutrient levels found in comparable dinners made by Growing Healthy, which are made from whole foods and contain no starchy fillers. Many fewer products made by Beech-Nut and Earth's Best contain starchy fillers."    http://www.cspinet.org/reports/cheat1.ht...|`|AA12274507	The only difference I ever noticed was that the jars look different and I beleive beechnut is a little more expensive.|`|930a625eb301aae633a9b9d8e18e0752aa	They are both the same basically. Although I found the beechnut ones to taste a bit off, like there was more water added. I couldn't quite put my finger on it, but there were no stomach issues with them.

5ZvALiclaa	My friends phil and teds did the same thing. She ended up having to take it back to the baby store she bought it from. It was still within the 12month warranty period so they fixed it. It had something to do with the cleaning process you are supposed to do every month<br>  <br>  take it back and see what they say, just make sure you have your receipt or proof of purchase
wuAFAKADaa	Not to freak you out, but I had the same signs when I was pregnant. Small bouts of cramps are often common in early pregnancy, as with brown discharge. Other signs are breast enlargement & tenderness, bloating-as you said, unusual tiredness etc. I would definitely recommend doing an HPT! <br>  Good luck x

o8uGsZxmaa	i stoped reading at - 'my parents will be paying around $200 ...'<br>  <br>  There paying for it!<br>  <br>  They have a right to be there|`|eu6UQElYaa	Well let's see the reason they want to be there is probably because they figure there will be smoking, drinking and fighting.   So the more you try to convince them not to go the more they will be suspicious of what's going on and the more trust you'll lose from them.   My suggestion, don't go to parties like that.  You avoid parties and people like that and your parents trust you and your friends more which means you get more privacy.|`|4pkFJxNJaa	To the girls above me: Ya like we parents would never ever think of that! NO WAY! geesh, you kids tend to forget that once, your parents were teens too. GASP! Yes, we told our parents that we were staying at a friends and our friends told their parents they were staying at our house and low and behold...our parents were teens once too! BUSTED! <br>  <br>    Be honest, you know we appreciate that, we are such sticks in the mud because we are worried about you. We want to know your safe and that you are not going to get hurt.  Blah blah, this is going in one ear and right out the other...but really if you take your case to your parents they may actually agree to a way where you won't be embarrassed. <br>  <br>  AKA, you call once an hour, YOU don't drink, smoke or hit the joint. Offer a breathalizer  (which can be bought over the counter) and a drug test. They want to trust you, the real question is, are you going to let them?|`|lb8FBhWnaa	Lie and say that the party is off, and tell them your sleeping over at a friends house that night, and after the party, sleep over at a friends house.|`|MzZwQS3zaa	do the party in a restaurant and dont tell your parents just say its over|`|8oKazGVGaa	do a fake party and have like a couple of good friends there who will pull a good act for you an then go to yours

I am having the same problem with my 6 month old.|`|acIHw8yAaa	She isn't hungry, she just can't fall asleep on his own.  You need to teach her this by putting her to sleep (everytime) while she is still awake.  Lay her in her crib and pat her for a while, less each time, until she eventually just lays down and goes to sleep on her own.  Then when she wakes up in the middle of the night, she will be able to self sooth.     Check out this website, this is what I did to get my kids to sleep through the night.    http://www.ehow.com/how_4749969_baby-sle...    Good luck!|`|ztug2gLjaa	put some cereal in her bottle at night so that way she'll stay full longer and won;t be as hungry through the night!|`|ka8mjOVUaa	Hi, With my daughter Jada, she was just like your baby she would not sleep during the night cont to wake all night. well I found that I keep her busy during the day and played with her. After that I would bath her and give her a bottle. and I let her sit up awhile so she did not throw up. after that I prepared on bottle at night and I put it in the night and day bottle warmer. when she woke for that bottle, I gave it to her and again she sat up in my arms(sleep) and as she got older she sleep a lot longer. it's basically keep her busy until it time for bed time. hope this helps. good luck

You will too.|`|3Psi4kBxaa	Yes you can start putting more effort into your school work and hang up the phone, till your working to your ability.  Good grades are necessary, the phone is not.

auUeI2Vnaa	Occasionally, people do still have their period when pregnant.|`|9z0CpCR9aa	it doesn't seem as though you are (negative pregnancy test) go see your doctor?|`|AA12041870	Of course you could be.  Want a definitive answer?  Go see a doctor.|`|Rf2r23sYaa	Take another test now. If it's negative and you're still concerned then see a doctor. It is rare for a woman to be in this situation and be pregnant but it has happened before.|`|nF9DZ0sOaa	I wish Y/A would just run a scrolling announcement across the top of their home page that says something like:  ATTENTION:  IF YOU HAVE UNPROTECTED SEX AND HAVE MISSED A PERIOD, IT IS POSSIBLE THAT YOU ARE PREGNANT.    Maybe that would answer this often-repeated question once and for all???    But to be specific, I have heard of cases where women had light periods right up to their delivery dates.  The only way to be sure is to check with your doctor, or wait nine months and see if the stork drops by.|`|yT3ZNEROaa	You sound pregnant. Some woman have what is called implantation bleeding while there pregnant, this is where the fertilized egg is settling into you uterus.   You don't have to get sick to be pregnant.  Other symptoms are weight gain, swollen and tender breasts, increased appetite.  Flushing in the face, and skin blotchiness, increased sensitivity to smells.  Some woman have their periods through out their entire pregnancy.  You need to get a blood pregnancy test, at a clinic, your doctors, or an ER.  This measures the blood hormone HCG in your blood and will tell for positive if you are pregnant.  If you are pregnant you need Prenatal treatment.  For instance prenatal vitamins, and regular ob/gyn exams.  Hang in there. Feel free to email me with any more questions.  I've been pregnant four times.  Take Care -Lisa|`|Q0xm1Kodaa	Could be but not likely. If you think something is wrong go to your doctor and have them do a blood test.|`|OngBk4Ejaa	you could be,   or it could be something else..  just go see a doctor..  goodluck.|`|hFQa24wOaa	yes.. but dont count on it.     Why not just go to the doctor for a blood test?|`|oLtcvloxaa	NNNNNOOOOOOOOOO!!!!!!|`|qPmQvqJXaa	Anything is possible, but it could also be a temporary ovarian cyst, an STD, or hormonal.  Go to the doctor if you still have questions, and they can make sure its nothing like a tubal pregnancy.|`|utYyjRFdaa	it is possible you might want to take another pregnancy test just in case and also...what are the symptoms of ur period? they could be very similar to the symptoms of pregnancy, and ur anxiousness could also be contributing to a late period. How old are you? you might want to see a doctor.|`|noujkaM7aa	Although it is possible to be pregnant and have a light period in the beginning of pregnancy, I do not believe that you are. You shouldn't have that many periods if you are pregnant. If you are really worried I would see your doctor about it and he can run some tests. For the future I would say be careful about who you have sex with and definitely have protected sex, not only to avoid pregnancy but stds too. It can happen... so don't underestimate the possibilities of having unprotected sex.|`|lbt0ayPuaa	yes...maybe.  1) take about 2 tests.  2) if positive tell the man who made the child.  3) decide if you want an abortion, adoption, or to keep it.  4) if abortion it will take up to $500.00 if is under 13 weeks  5) if adoption Start looking for parents and agencies  6) if keeping you MUST tell some one (if you haven't already).  7) be ready for whatever happens.  hope this helps!!!|`|AA10038269	you have all the symptoms but sickness? you maybe pregnant but i would check with your dr.|`|tM0qJY4aaa	My advice would be to take another test but at least like a week after you did it. And if you had it unprotected about 8 or 9 times you are probably trying to get pregnant i assume because i would be surprised if you DIDN'T get pregnant.|`|AA11957191	No Way..........|`|TWfuO1xoaa	Yes it is possible, sometimes pregnancy tests are not accurate - that is why it is good to take more than one! Your body may still show signs that you are experiencing a period even if you are pregnant. If it has been about 3 months now you should be starting to show signs of being pregnant such as weight gain, morning sickness etc. These symptons do not effect everyone though, so if you are concerned the best thing to do is to contact your GP or go to a family planning clinic. It may not be that you are pregnant - but its best to get checked out just in case.|`|886YDJEEaa	yes, either take another test and/or call your doctor. somtimes women dont have alot of the hormone the p/t look for so just try agin.
wLe7nBLGaa	i took prometrium when i was 5 weeks pregnant. i have heard woman taking it to regulate their period
1OKx4TYpaa	I have a 13 month old, and I don't plan to switch her to a toddler bed for some time becuase she still cuddles up to the bumper.  If the rails are not soft (covered with the bumper), I imagine she would wake herself often during the night.    I also think it might be dangerous if the toddler can get out.  My daughter can't even get close to getting out of her crib at this point.    I'm having another baby in September, and I'll consider the switch then, I guess.|`|eiJOdPgxaa	When they climb out of their cot!! My daughter was in a proper single bed by 14 months (right climber she was)|`|2z1h5mfOaa	I don't know how big your crib is, and what your crib is like, but I decided to move both of my children out of the crib quite early, i.e. from around probably 6 to 8 months old.  You have to watch what they're capable of and if they start to move around trying to get up etc., it's time to move them out of a crib and into a bed with guards, for their own safety.|`|dwdLkvgPaa	my baby is 14 months and is still in her crib...I just think that 14 months is a bit to young to move outa of the crib...I am worried about her getting up at night and I don't hear her and she gets into something she isnt suppose too...|`|5knrrv0gaa	We're waiting to move our 20 month old until he can climb out of his crib... which we expect to be any day now.  But we'd like to keep him in his crib as long as possible, because he has a lot more freedom and ability to run the house at night if he's in a toddler bed!  Containing him and keeping him safe will be much more difficult once your little guy is out of the crib.  Don't rush the toddler bed... for his safety and your sanity!|`|r7q8LW7Aaa	My daughter was 15 months when she went into hers because she managed to climb out of her cot. I was very worried that she would climb out, but I put loads of pillows on the floor and she never did. She once scared us by 'dissapearing' in her room - she was asleep on the floor way under the bed! I was panicking when I couldn't find her.  I would try to hold off for a while, but if he can climb out then it might be worth a try. If he can't climb out yet, then there's no reason to risk it.|`|uEjh3CAbaa	Yes he can both my boys were in toddler beds by this time we put bed guards up and had a better back!!  You can only determine when it is time,and it sounds like now!|`|6hrpoVUZaa	My daughter moved at 14 months and did wonderfully. I guess it depends on how close your rooms are to one another and how he feels about it. Is he ready for a "big boy bed" and do you really have a reason to change beds yet?|`|ecuVbpk4aa	i don't think so, i was 2 before i was in my own bed! my cousin was 2 and his sister was almost 3 before they put her in a "big girl bed"|`|27d56c06ceccc45d5e89e737fce397ddaa	Mine is 18 months and I wouldnt dream of putting him in his toddler bed yet.  The crib still constrains him at this point. I can't imagine how difficult nap and bed time would be if he could easily step out of bed and go walk around his room. I guess that point is inevitable but Id like to prolong it as much as possible.|`|gEj36qI6aa	I put my daughter in a bed at 15 months and I put a stair gate on her door. This way she was limited to just her bedroom and I just made sure everything was safe. She did empty out the draws and stuff a few times but really she was no problem in a bed. I think you know your child best and like every child the develope differently. As long as he can get in and out himself i think he will be fine!     I have a 21 months old that I am about to move into a bed I only waited so long with him because he has develope differently than my daughter.  Hope this helps.
SEzIkGNiaa	In vitro fertilisation (IVF) is a process by which egg cells are fertilized by sperm outside of the womb, in vitro. IVF is a major treatment in infertility when other methods of assisted reproductive technology have failed. The process involves hormonally controlling the ovulatory process, removing ova (eggs) from the woman's ovaries and letting sperm fertilise them in a fluid medium. The fertilized egg (zygote) is then transferred to the patient's uterus with the intent to establish a successful pregnancy. The first test tube baby was born in 1978.|`|QB5D0rG4aa	Vitro Fertilization begins with drugs and hormones, used to stimulate a womans ovaries into producing mature eggs. Those eggs are then retrieved from her ovaries and mixed with male sperm in a laboratory to achieve fertilization. The resulting embryo is then put directly into the womans uterus, with the hope that it will attach to the uterine wall and begin to develop. Hope this helps.|`|AA10186411	In vitro fertilization is when they fertilize the egg OUTSIDE the womb and then put it back inside.|`|L982MxUvaa	In vitro fertilisation (IVF) is a process by which egg cells are fertilized by sperm outside of the womb, in vitro.

6egcoGEwaa	Freya McCreath is the nicest in my opinion...the name freya is lovely...|`|XzV4bUeFaa	Not Freya    Chloe McCreath  or   Ava McCreath    I'd choose Ava from those two.|`|apXIw0ZJaa	Ava is my FAVORITE girls name! I also like Chloe. NOt a big fan on McCreath but its your choice!|`|MdSU0s8Saa	ava is the best first name  as for middle names:  grace  isobel  megan  jasmine  chloe|`|okgr5aPCaa	I like Chloe and Ava - they are so pretty and beautiful.

But Chloe is my very favourite and Ava second :D    Middle name suggestions:  Chloe Mae (or Chloe May)  Chloe Elise  Chloe Arielle  Chloe Alyssa (or Chloe Alissa/Elissa)  Chloe Belle      Chloe Ava sounds really nice, then you get both names that you like in.  Or Chloe Freya.|`|dK6YGyNyaa	freya - love this name, but freya mccreath doesn't sound right - 5/10  chloe - really cute name, love it - 8/10  ava - this is really pretty - 7/10|`|HjiqMDI6aa	I love Ava.

YsQQ30YJaa	No. You shouldn't have one at all.|`|6t76bgS3aa	You don't need a baby?  If you don't need a toddler can you kill him?  Abortion is the same.  If you don't want your baby you can put them up for adoption or you can be an adult and take responsibility for the life you created.|`|HM0cxcahaa	The wording of your question is bound to spark some anger... I dont carry judgement with abortion each to their own, its legal and available. If your wondering if you can have an abortion it is possible up to 14 weeks. Anything after that is only done if there are serious brith defects the embryo becomes a fetus.|`|Bg6txvxqaa	It's your decision but take it from someone who's been down that road - You'll never really get over it.|`|XyRzSzjtaa	THATS IS A DISGRACEFUL COMMENT AND YOU SHOUD BE ABORTED YOU EVIL PERSON|`|wKuQC4yTaa	no|`|4pkFJxNJaa	I'm sorry?

You will NEED every ounce of love coming from this little soul.. and the one thing you won't NEED is to question if you made the right decision, because it will all be answered, in a cry, in a breath, in a blink of an eye, the very moment you meet the real love of your life.|`|e60754e2c47d3732e670fc3cfec1373eaa	are you seriously asking this question?????????????? why don't you take a look at the ttc section- its full of people that NEED what you have! instead of posting on here, because ultimately you already know what you want to do, have a little consideration for those of us that would give their right arm to have what you have.|`|J6X0JZkKaa	i think this is around the time when it starts to be more dangerous and when the fetus is actually starting to take form.  if you really don't want to keep your child then consider adoption and let some family who does want a child care for him/her.|`|x1CcZBENaa	well ! in that situation! you should watch the story  of juno you know about a girl who accidentally  been pregnant but then in the end she decided to give his new born son to  a happy couple who they like to adopt|`|BthSjSEHaa	You don't NEED a baby?

a37f465fb3af30fb69356b87ea42c178aa	He is still so young he may not walk for another 8 -10 months!! A scooter may make him lazy to want to learn to walk in my opinion. Wait until he is at least walking along furniture until you put him in a scooter.|`|GfphOIdOaa	Bad. Don't force him to sit/stand if he is physically not evolved so far. Once he is ready for it, he'll sit and stand up. Until then, leave him be.|`|0WYzUsjMaa	i have a 9 month old and he can sit but does still fall over, i have a small plastic bike for him, i have put in on it but u have to hold him so he doesnt hurt himself.<br>  If you hold him so he doesnt hurt himself i dont see the harm in doing it, he may love it and have heaps of fun.<br>  <br>  for those people who said if you make him use his legs before 10 months that bullshit, they have jolly jumper so they can make their legs strong, my son loves to stand with me holding him and he would rather stand than sit.|`|kCbDkQzGaa	Your son's body is still developing. Putting him in a scooter will probably cause his legs to be bowed and you don't want that. I would wait until he is around 10months or so before you put him in a walker.  Every child develops differently, so don't let the pressures of other kids walking early get you down.  No pressure at all, let your kid grow those muscles...|`|ssDPdqZaaa	I have herd that they can delay the babies progress with walking .<br>   I think, they can help strengthen neck and leg mussels, also promote the babies want to be upright. But,, I also think that babies should not be in them around the clock. If they are in them for very long periods of time, I do agree that this could delay the babies development.<br>  If you use your own judgment with this, Im sure you cant go wrong!<br>  good luck!|`|CwNMq7RTaa	I've heard if you make them use their legs before they're ready it's bad for them.|`|TJusfEnlaa	At 8 months I would say bad. My son started going in a walker when he was about 5, 6 months because he was so active and already crawling and pulling to a stand and i was at my wits end what to do with him so I bought him one and he looooved it. He got over it at about 7 months and hasn't been in it since. He started walking on his own at 9 months and 3 days so i know it hasn't affected him in any way!! but at 8 months, yes I think that may be a bit late... (IMO)
osXURDjraa	Some babies find it hard to fall asleep in conditions different to that of the womb, Do you leave a light on when you put her to bed as this may be distracting her from falling asleep. Is it possibly to noisy is she near a bathroom where she can hear taps and toilet flushes? Are you being to noisy downstairs? All in all she is quite young so I think it would be best just to leave her to fall asleep make sure that the curtains are shut, lights off, she is not near any noisy toys and that her door is firmly shut. Don't be tempted that if she cries to pick her up and rock her: leave her. Don't be temped that if she is laughing to give her a dummy: leave her. If she doesn't know that you're there then she is less likely to not fall asleep as babies tend to do a lot of stuff for attention!<br>  Hope this helps :)|`|1hciyvKdaa	Yep enjoy those smiles, their funner than crying frowns right!! Yes babies to mix up and alter their schedules at will. Just keep doing what your doing, soon another stage will start. Make sure you let her cooo and not pick her up, let her whine and not pick her up, she may fall back asleep, but all in all, this is still very young, and it happens.|`|jNQbVDHSaa	baby is quite normal. they do not have a fixed schedule!|`|h85kkDsbaa	Yes this is normal, but now is the time (if you want to) to introduce a bedtime routine. A warm bath and then her bedtime feeds in a dark, quiet and relaxed room so she can tell its bed time and not daytime. When she naps during the day keep the curtains open and the room noisy and hopefully she will start to understand the difference between day and night. Good luck X|`|Gj5WkwG4aa	Dont worry, its quiet normal. But try giving her a warm bath with more water in the evening time. And also a gentle body massage with a lotion. This will definitely take her to sleep.
9tTeiZBXaa	In my opinion your sister should tell him that right now she doesn't know where daddy is. Telling the boy that daddy doesn't want to see him is going to hurt him and cause resentment. This boy will grow and have the age appropriate time to understand and possibly see on his own what kind of father he has. This is such a painful and difficult situation and I can hoenstly tell you I know how it is. Good luck you must be an awesome auntie to take your time and ask others for help. It seems like your nephew has enough love to keep him happy.|`|41ae15ac803d3436669dcaa9d4f80901aa	she needs to be as honest as possible and perhaps say to him that his father isn't able to meet him right now and try to draw the boys attention to something else, possibly a new play group, church group, or even a new toy.  kids dont dwell on things for long.  just make sure she doesnt talk about his dad in front of him and he will probably dismiss the idea, especially if he gets the same answer from his mom every time.|`|AA12012816	I have no idea - that is a tough one<br>  <br>  the question may be to communicate somehow  with the father first.  Does your sister get a lot of joy out of her son?  It may be to communicate that too.<br>  <br>  I wish you and her luck|`|QnJvJ67uaa	Don't tell him his daddy doesn't want him .....apart from anything else he may become a part of the child's life at a much later date and its terrible to jeopardise that no matter how badly he treated your sister by leaving her.<br>  You can say you don't know where his daddy is, but don't make out that he will come back just that you don't know where he is.<br>  When your nephew is a little older explain to him that his daddy was scared of the big job of being a daddy and so let his mum and aunties take care of him because he knew they would do a good job.<br>  Don't lie, but also don't burden him with adult stuff .<br>  Hood luck :) x|`|1NF6f4y7aa	tell him he's the immaculate conception like Jesus or Anakin Skywalker. <br>  Break it to him easy.
1K0n0Sk8aa	sounds normal to me, i had pains like that around the same time, it sounds most likely to be round ligament pain, take it easy for a while and obviously if it gets any worse or you have any bleeding, water leakage etc then call you doctor straight away|`|xwMWfuBTaa	round ligament pain - it sounds like normal stretching pains, they continue throughout the pregnancy.|`|GfG6wupTaa	I might be able to answer if I knew what a stitch was.|`|KqloS80maa	ya sounds like just a little sharp pain , i get them all the time ....|`|2618b27ee1b1bc95bede9c4c3e930725aa	Every pregnancy is different, but maybe you should call your doctor, I'm sure it's nothing, but just to be safe, they will reassure you and give you advice as to what it may be. It could be your appendix if it's on the right, so just call your doctor or midwife soon xxx

We aren't doctors here and perhaps nobody has come across this before so it would be pretty stupid to answer something you don't know the answer to. I have had 3 children and I have no clue about this kind of thing. You should be questioning your doctor more closely to find out what is going on with your twins. Write down a list of questions you want answered before your next appointment and make sure he answers them to your satisfaction. It is pretty pointless asking people here who have no clue about TTTS or placental sharing or blood flows. Sorry you are worried and I wish you the best with your babies but you need to ask the people who are qualified to know best.|`|h5cFkP35aa	The weight of your babies is fine. The best circulation and breathing can be achieved by laying on your left side. Please take it easy.|`|AA12395149	It sounds like your boys are on track as far as weight goes.  <br>  <br>  To optimize blood flow, rest on a left or right tilt at the very least (not flat on your back), but for best results left or right side (left is typically better).  Drink plenty of fluids, follow a healthy diet with lots of fresh fruits, veggies, lean meats and whole grains.  Take your prenatal vitamins and possibly iron (your doctor should tell you if you need additional iron or not).  Twins sharing a placenta is fairly common, and though it does make the pregnancy a bit more high risk, as long as you follow doctor's orders and take care of yourself, you should be fine.<br>  <br>  Best of luck.
o5jSID4Jaa	Mine decreased around 36 wks. It was very minimal for about a week. When it came back it was a lot, even more than I'd had before. I had my daughter a few days later. My dr said It was normal for it to slow down and start back again.|`|1K0n0Sk8aa	mine decreased around week 37 as well i thought it was strange but my midwife reassured me it was nothing to worry about, just enjoy it while it lasts i am now 40+6 weeks and mine has come back and its alot lol xx

There was 8 other guys that came forward and said they could be the father. I think she is a whoree.|`|Jucak0HLaa	I don't think he is.|`|3OP1YIXCaa	I dont think so. I know he's really 13 but he looks 8. And he was 12 when they had sex. It's most likely impossible for him to be the father. I think that she just said he is because she wants money from his family.<br>  <br>  And think about it. Which is more likely? A) she gets pregnant by a 13 year old who admits that that was his first time having sex and that he has no idea about babies except that he "will be the best dad for his daughter" <br>  <br>  or B) that she got pregnant by one of the older boys that she has been sleeping around with.|`|xWfrA3vqaa	It's possible, because for some people puberty occurs in different orders than others.

VY4LqfLpaa	I've been putting some shoes on our son occasionally already...he's still not crawling but I don't want him to just automatically take his shoes off just as soon as I put them on once he gets a little older...I'm already having enough troubles with keeping socks on his feet...AND keeping those socks DRY!|`|2932ee4950edd4f131a711d029cc8528aa	barefoot as much as possible, but as my son should be crawling by then... i will probably keep him in robeez while he's crawling outside on the patio, just so he doesn't scape up the tops of his feet|`|471ca0c8552c4633e525815ba702310aaa	I didn't last summer when my son wasn't walking. He gets really sweaty feet if I did. The only time I would put shoes on him is if we were somewhere with AC. This summer I plan on letting him walk barefoot. Let the grass tickle his toes and get mud in them too. Part of growing up and learning IMO.|`|5b3cd64667a391942de231867c44d64caa	We're in the middle of a really hot summer - I'm in Victoria and very close to the infamous bushfires. I usually don't put anything on our nearly 3 month old baby's feet but when I do, we put these ADORABLE little socks that have shoes printed on them. It's funny to see people when they realise they aren't shoes - I think they think the socks are cuter than our baby! lol (we have a very cute baby btw lol)|`|3f0439ebe7cdf100832cada550ab973caa	It depends on baby's age.<br>  If they're newborn or under 12 months I don't advise it as putting a shoe on a baby is not only difficult but you tend to be twising and pushing the baby's foot which could end up damaging ligaments and muscle structure.|`|OPTDFRuzaa	no because their feet grow better without them|`|gBEq0zo5aa	My son was born last march so he was 3-5 months old last summer. I never put shoes on his because the pediatrician told me that shoes can inhibit proper foot formation by holding the foot in a position that they are not ready to be in yet. Second, his feet never touched the ground so they couldn't get dirty and it was hot out! He did have one pair of sandals that I put on him for fourth of July to go with his outfit, but they were expensive PediPed ones that supposedly don't "form" their feet. Also, he really didn't like wearing shoes- he would play with his toys with his fingers and toes and that made it more fun for him! Good Luck!|`|GU3RauKOaa	Before she could stand up at all, I occasionally put little soft shoes on when we went out. It was also winter then so they kept her feet extra warm.<br>  <br>  By summer she could pull up to stand and cruise and in September she could walk so she was not wearing shoes at all then. Its not good for them to wear shoes when they are standing up. And anyway it was hot so I let her be barefoot. We were outside a lot and she just looked so cute in a little dress and bare toes. <3 Awww.... now I miss the summer. I can't wait til it warms up..|`|v3YJq4moaa	sometimes I did and sometimes not.  If I went into a store or some public place I would always just put socks on her. I would keep a pair in the diaper bag at all times. If we were out for a walk then just cute little bare feet is how I kept my daughter.|`|DU72Bf5Caa	i will sometimes
f66ce5d864eadcad29348fd4a9871771aa	my daughter walks AND talks in her sleep..(fun fun)  she woke up one night just crying her eyes out, she was about 5 or 6...of course i went in to see what was wrong,she said "the potty wont play with me" lol i dont know what the deal was, but she was all upset because the potty wouldnt play with her .....another night,more recently, (shes 10, so she was 9 then) she came in the living room here while i was  on my computer, and she had her stuffed red dog (her sleep buddy) under her arm, she wandered around, i watched her a sec and asked her what she was doing..she looked at me with that look she gets when shes sleep walking for a  minute...then she finally says,,, " i need t put him up there" and uses her red dog to point to the ceiling fan....hmm   ok, i told her red would get lonely  up there and she needed to go  back to bed and she wandered off back to bed and was fine the rest of the  night..... who knows whats going through their  head when they are asleep like that, but i know its sure made me a light sleeper, im always afraid she will get up and try to go outside or something, she never remembered it in the morning. ( i sleep walked too when i was young, used to scare dad to death haha)|`|91ff4dbbfbd7827f11b99d3972e133e1aa	Either the child was dreaming or sleepwalking, a lot of children have<br>  very vivid dreams, or sometimes if they have fever they can talk in<br>  their sleep, I remembver being 6hyrs and had fever and I clearly saw<br>  a dog snarling at me in mhy bedroom and I told mhy mother, I think I<br>  had a 105 fever. But most of the times theyre dreams, either from<br>  watching tv, or a very vivid imagination.|`|prqrQcd1aa	My 3 year old woke up one night from a night terror telling me that the cookies were comming and she was going to eat them all! LOL, i told her it was okay. She said "ok mommy" then feel right back asleep. I'm not shure what kind of dream she was having honestly, but i found it really cute and funny!|`|j2mRop0laa	No...lol<br>  <br>  But, when I was little, I woke my sister up crying about my "smashed cake". I don't remember it, I musta been sleepwalking.<br>  <br>  Kids and sweets....|`|kSZx9cY5aa	My 5yo woke up a few weeks ago, and came into the living room crying. He walked into the kitchen, opened the pantry, grabbed a loaf of bread and tried to take it to bed with him. When I asked him what he was doing and tried to take the bread of him he starting cying even harder, ran into bed and snuggled up with the bread-huh!?!<br>  We've also heard him making chicken, cat and owl noises in his sleep.<br>  Hopefully he was sleepwalking!<br>  <br>  When my daughter was about 8 she was really sick with a stomach virus and had a really high fever. She got out of bed, walked over the freezer and started feeling around inside, because "I KNOW she put my dress in here! She stole my dress!", then she stopped, grabbed a chunk of ice, said "Oh look, a sausage roll" and tried to eat it. <br>  We still poke fun at her about it hee-hee :)|`|pUvEmPrCaa	Children will often verbalize what they are dreaming about.  It's not a big concern.  It is a form of sleepwalking except without actual movements and actions carried out.  Talking is just as much sleepwalking as is actual walking.  <br>  <br>  You should just go along with her.  She's not doing anything harmful.  Just try and get her to go back to sleep.  Convince her that the sprinkles are fine and she can have them when she wakes up in the morning.  She most likely won't remember this whole incident.|`|ggGPaYZSaa	My kids have never cried over sprinkles but my son woke up swearing his Papa left him even though Papa was talking to him. And my daughter woke up at 3 am and decided to wander around the house for about an hour before passing out at the foot of her bed. There are those nights you just have to sit back and quietly laugh. As long as they are not hurting themselves they are fine. Just a vivid dream is what my said later when I asked him.|`|a6c92449aaca224893881b1d29662d5caa	My son once woke up and walked straight to the fridge and opened it.  I was sitting on the couch & I asked him what he was doing & he said "I have to go pee."  I think I caught him before he peed in the fridge!!  I did have a good laugh though!|`|cteyFJxhaa	Well...different kind of sprinkles....my son got up, walked into the bathroom, peed in the middle of the floor, washed his hands and went back to bed....all I could do was laugh!|`|w9TzZCt8aa	my little sister once had a dream about spiders all over her. she couldn't sleep in her own bed for a week.|`|VHHis05Naa	No, but last night my daughter woke up and asked me for a cupcake and then went right to sleep again.  hehehe|`|723QHuicaa	Lol, yes. she is 18m and woke up one night at 2am to have some sort of important meeting with the minnie and mickey she sleeps with. It must have been rather important becasue its took about an hour before she decided it was appropriate to go back to sleep.<br>  <br>  <br>  **** Do you mean teddy ruckspin? I had one of those!<br>  I tried to wake my BF up last night because I couldnt find the phone, he was the last one with it. He, half asleep, insisted he never had it. Then when I found it and he had woken up, he asked me why I woke him up to find a tupperware (???)
chmuDZObaa	I would ask a doctor about taking Plan B if you can't take regular birth control.  I believe it is a stronger version of birth control and can really mess your body up.  The safest solution would be to use a sponge and a condom with spermicide.   If you are also on the patch, then that would be another layer of protection but I wouldn't mess around with Plan B unless it truly is an emergency and the condom broke or something.|`|mfnugUZJaa	Just use a condom with spermicides. If it's used properly, then you'll only have about a 1% chance of getting pregnant. Any time you have sex (protected or otherwise, regardless of how many pills and condoms you use) you run the risk of falling pregnant. If you're that stressed out about it, then just don't have sex...that will solve your problem.|`|67QVKHQ3aa	how about you take one method of birth control and use a condom....cant beat that!
fe6fcbf713d0ed0538de9c9304001a52aa	I'm sure it is frustrating, but I've found that when I am resentful of nursing the problem is never really the breastfeeding -its the total lack of support which would continue whether I was breastfeeding or not.  Lets face it if hubby can't be bothered to take out the trash or do the dishes they aren't going to feed the baby even if the baby is bottle fed.<br>  <br>  My kids mainly nurse to sleep, and back to sleep.  Though they will go to sleep for daddy about half the time if I'm not around, and my toddler will almost always go to sleep for daddy, often faster than for me. <br>  <br>  You really, really need to co-sleep or at least get your baby a safe sleeping surface that you can stretch out on.  At work is there a closet you could empty of anything he can get into and put down a nap mat like they use in some daycares?  Or use a nap mat and put a big gate enclosure like this one: <a href="http://comfortfirst.com/p-28008-supergate-superyard-xt-portable-play-area-for-young-children-and-pets-8669.aspx" rel="nofollow">http://comfortfirst.com/p-28008-supergat...</a> (but not necessarily that one, I'm not saying that one is any better its just the first I found a picture of.)  Lie down and get him to sleep and then get up and sneak away.  I don't know what you do at work but if its primarily keyboarding I have had remarkably large babies sleep in my lap on a boppy while I type.<br>  <br>  Also you really need to stop force feeding him, even if he were ready for solids at this point, and he almost certainly wasn't at 4 months, he would be refusing them anyway because he has such a negative reaction to them from being forced twice a day every day.  Nearly all babies aren't ready until 6-9 months.  You can give him some finger foods and some water at meal times if he wants to join in, and if he eats -great, if not that's perfectly normal.<br>  <br>  Once you get into a good routine where baby is getting enough sleep even though you have to nurse him to sleep every time, then you can try gentle methods like the No-Cry Sleep Solution by Pantley to try to get him to sleep without nursing.<br>  <br>  But at this point all the crying himself to sleep is just making more stress for you and him, so is trying to spoon feed him, and trying to make him take bottles or cups.  And you need to make sure you get enough help around the house even if it temporarily means hiring someone, and make sure you get enough sleep (and that means you will probably have to go to be earlier and possibly nap when hubby is around)<br>  <br>  <br>  Co-sleeping is safe, particularly at this point as long as you baby proof the sleep area.  Its really the only solution for many moms<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.workandpump.com/reversecycling.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.workandpump.com/reversecyclin...</a><br>  Your baby eats more: If your baby is close to you at night, you'll probably find he eats more during the night. The reason for this is that when your baby wakes up, you're more likely to wake up with him and feed him. He also may wake up more often with you close by. Babies who sleep alone sleep more deeply (a risk factor for SIDS) and tend to eat less at night (needing more bottles during the day).<br>  <br>  You get better rest: Wait a minute, I just said your baby would wake up more, that you would wake up more - how does this make for better rest?<br>  <br>  The secret is that you and your baby get into similar sleep cycles. When your baby is in a separate room, he wakes up on his sleep cycles, you're on yours, and there's no coordination - so he might be waking up when you're in your deepest sleep (when it's a lot harder to wake up and harder to fall back asleep).<br>  <br>  Also, if your baby is in another room, he has to wake up all the way and start crying before you hear him. You have to wake all the way up and get out of bed, and most likely you sit up in a chair to feed - awake the whole time. Then what? It's 2am, and you're both awake, taking longer for both of you to settle back to sleep.<br>  <br>  If your baby is near you, you'll wake up when he makes his first noises, little half-sleeping grunts. You just reach over to feed, you can nurse lying down, the whole feeding routine is less disruptive to you and your baby's sleep. Falling back to sleep means either sliding your baby back to the co-sleeper, or just drifting off where you are.<br>  <br>  A lot of mothers worry that sleeping in the same bed with their baby is dangerous - but the scientific evidence points to just the opposite conclusion. For breastfeeding, sober mothers who share sleep with their babies on a safe sleeping surface, SIDS rates are amazingly low and babies are healthier. More information about safe co-sleeping can be found in several locations - I found a nice article here. Dr. James McKenna has done extensive research on the safety of co-sleeping - link to his journal articles here. Dr. Jay Gordon also has information about safe co-sleeping. And even more information here. <br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.askdrsears.com/html/7/T071000.asp" rel="nofollow">http://www.askdrsears.com/html/7/T071000...</a><br>  Our first three babies were easy sleepers.

Our baby (albeit very young baby) slept and fed wonderfully when we co-slept.  She's now three months old and sleeping in her own cot - she does wake most nights at about 5am but I just pop her in bed with us and she goes right back to sleep.<br>  <br>  Just a thought.. :-)|`|OHq5gSjJaa	Well the only thing I can suggest is have you tried skipping the pureed phase?  <br>  My daughter absolutely HATED anything pureed...  if it was coming at her in a spoon she wanted no part of it.  She would purse her lips, turn her head, hit the spoon, scream, cry, etc.  So I started just giving her little teeny tiny bites of food.  I started with bananas and avocados.  You can mash them a tiny bit, but still let him use his own hand to pick it up and find his mouth.  Then I moved on to peas, well-cooked tiny bits of squash, gerber puffs...  Then tiny bites of well-cooked pasta, little pieces of toast...  Now she is just eating whatever I am eating only in little tiny pieces.  She still wont eat anything pureed off a spoon and she is 8 months.  Maybe he would like this style of eating better and be willing to try some things.  Its just a thought since it worked for me :)   Another idea would be those mesh self-feeder spoons that you can put things like soft fruit or veggies in.  <br>  As for the bottle will he take one from someone else if you are out of the room?  <br>  <br>  Sounds like it is a really hard phase...  I hope it is over soon and you can get some rest!|`|mjz8JF9Gaa	the boobs comfort <br>  if u dont want to quit breastfeeding u dont have to but if u want to u can <br>  u lil baby sounds like hes thick headed <br>  have u tried diffrent bottlees <br>  pacifires when he wakes <br>  putting him to sleep in something that moves or is inclined <br>  maybe even side sleeping since im sure hes rolling over by now <br>  are u doing cereal or veggies <br>  if ur doing cereal try veggies if ur doing veggies try fruits <br>  my little guy is six months old to and hes a pain to get to sleep thru. <br>  mybe try juice in the bottle since there allowed juice now just 2 oz instead of a bottle try a sippy cup because we can introduce them now <br>  try diffrent formula <br>  maybe a lil tylanol before bed to help with teething <br>  make sure his diapers dry and hes comfy and try gas drops his tummy may hurt <br>  try taking him for walks to get fresh air <br>  if its not to cold <br>  i dont know im  in the same boat with how my son is sleeping <br>  hope this helped
be8738c7b3a936fc2e865b3f0e6ad7d4aa	I was the same way with my first pregnancy. I have no idea why, but I would always wait until the last possible second to get ready to go. I was never late to work but I was cutting it close a lot.<br>  <br>  I always took naps and that seemed to help a lot. I would get up in morning and eat breakfast and then I would go lay on the couch and go back to sleep.<br>  <br>  I would speak to your doctor about the fatigue, they may want to check you for anemia.|`|gRtmFa1maa	I was tired at the end (more like 8 months), hauling all that weight around, not sleeping well took it's toll.<br>  <br>  I wonder if your anemic, which can happend during pregnancy. Pregnancy can also be a stress to your thyroid...so you may want to have that looked into. If you've gone hypothyroid..you would be very tired.<br>  <br>  Being tired is normal, yours sounds like there is a little more behind it. Talk to your doctor.|`|1CryEnb3aa	Fatigue is normal.  However, did your dr test you for gestational diabetes?  My sister was like this and ended up with GD.  Good luck and Congrats|`|myEwHgI1aa	Yes, it is normal and healthy for you to all of a sudden be more tired. Your body is making more blood than it was before pregnancy, plus you are supporting the life growing inside you. Make sure you are getting plenty of water, and eating well- meaning lots of veggies, fruit and proteins ( skip the sugar, it'll only make you more tired) and remember your vitamins daily. Don't worry about it, this is part of being a mama.|`|1bnhwGACaa	im 5 months and have just started getting more tired b/c i cant sleep at night <br>  try taking a 15 min nap and going to bed earlier <br>  also watch what you are eating some foods have the ability to make you very sleepy <br>  i cant eat cheese or turkey without feeeling like im going to sleep <br>  also talk to your ob and see if there is anything in your bloodwork that might have come up|`|wHOQXToHaa	WElcome to the end of pregnancy! :) Congrats!! By the end of my first pregnancy I swear I was sleeping like 20 hrs. a day (I ended up needing to be on bedrest for high blood pressure....). It was crazy, I hardly remember anything but sleeping ALL the time! All I ever wanted to do was sleep or pee, LOL. It IS normal to be so exhausted, but talk to your doc to make sure there are no other problems such  as anemia, gestational diabetes. I had something called HELLP syndrome which contributed to my extreme fatigue in the first pregnancy. If you have any sudden severe swelling, or pain in your upper right abdomen, call you doc ASAP and mention this! But in normal preggo's, definetely extremely exhausted a lot- imagine having other kids & being preggo! It gets tough but worth it! Try to take it easy, pamper yourself when you are at home. RELAX :) At work go to the bathroom & just sit on the toilet just to rest for a few extra minutes w//out anyone at work bothering you. It does help....trust me.|`|Gabo2Uc7aa	Definitely had the same thing happen to me.  I almost fell asleep at the wheel a couple times.  It would come on me quickly sometimes.  Talk to your doctor about it, he may need to increase the strength of your vitamins to include more iron.|`|h5cFkP35aa	i'm almost 8 mos and have felt that way the entire pregnancy. so just consider yourself lucky you got a break at the beginning. hang in there.|`|SVwsRUIUaa	I have a 14month old daughter and 22weeks pregnant with my second, believe me it could be worse. But that last trimester is murder for moms.|`|AA12395149	The third trimester of pregnancy is the most trying.  You have lack of sleep and your baby is growing at a crazy rate which is a huge strain on your body.  <br>  <br>  Try to establish a good sleeping pattern.  If you have to take a short nap during the day, then do it (but try to make it in the early afternoon, the later times will effect your night sleep), but try to make the nap less than an hour long.<br>  <br>  Sometimes mid day exercise will help you to sleep better at night.  Eat well, lots of fresh fruits, veggies, lean meats and whole grains.<br>  <br>  Best of luck.|`|YehcUSkoaa	i know quite a few people that experience extreme fatigue with pregnancy.  My sister is one of them.  She is about to pop any day now, and even though she is in pain...she still sleeps most of the time (she is currently in labor, but her water isn't breaking, so she keeps getting sent home). A close friend of mine was so tired during her pregnancy that she woke up, got dressed, slept on the way to work, slept on her break, slept on the way home, and then slept as long as she could until she had to get out of bed and do it all over.<br>  <br>  It may be because your due date is close.  if you experience ANY pain i beseech you to see your physician.

5EiShLZZaa	It can cause your doctor to have a more watchful eye during your pregnancy, but overall the baby should be just fine.  I have hypothyroidism (primary, not pregnancy caused), I take medication daily and will for my lifetime...  I have to have a thyroid panel once a trimester, once I hit 28 weeks I will be admitted to the hospital for fetal non-stress tests and biophysical profiles twice a week until delivery and they want me delivered by 39 weeks.  With hypothyroidism, you are at a slight increased chance of still birth (that's why I am having all the tests so often, so they can find a problem and deliver if necessary) and some babies stop growing adequately at the end (why they are inducing by 39 weeks).  If your thyroid is low, you may need to take daily medication until after you deliver to regulate your thyroid- some women will need it the rest of their lives, depends the cause of the thyroid issue...Either of these problems are few and far in between, but my OB would rather be safe than sorry, and I completely agree!  Good luck momma!|`|AA12395149	You won't lose the baby as long as you follow whatever course your doctor prescribes.  Most likely your thyroid studies came back low and you'll have to take a medication to help with it (a synthetic thyroid hormone).  The most probably complication is that you'll have to have your blood drawn more often than most pregnant women.<br>  <br>  Best of luck.|`|umca7pwoaa	Thyroid problems can cause miscarriages and other complications with the baby. however, my cousin had problems with this and her doctor prescribed her pills....seems like 7 a day or something... and i'm happy to say that Mia Olivia is here and doing just fine.|`|dQ4XwT95aa	Well thyroid can cause you to miscarry but if caught early enough and treated then it should not cause you any problem.

You will not lose the baby as long as you follow your dr.'s orders...exercise is important and so is eating healthy. <br>  <br>  Good luck and congratulations!|`|ZNhP3mpUaa	Nope and Nope. Dr. caught it early. They'll test your T4 levels and put you on a certain dosage of Synthroid (synthetic form of your T4 hormone) to get you where you need to be.

I will eventualy die. Just don't get another one. My hubby was attached to his cat too. When it died i was happy not to get another. About the convosation about going around the world: you hubby is not in that situation so he honestly can not say he wouldn't. He just doesn't know<br>  <br>  About calling you Grumpy... Don't worry about it. I sovled that problem with my hubby. He would always call me Grumpy too.

Every day isn't going to be roses and laughing but they won't all be this bad either.  I hope the rest of your day is better.|`|F3BRG72iaa	im 12 weeks pregnant too and im going through the exact same thing as you are. My husband and me for some reason just don't get along and i think that he just needs to understand the position i'm in...i mean he's not the one with the baby inside is he? just talk to him and let him know whats bothering you he needs to understand you, you are pregnant and mood swings are totally normal. He also needs to understand that sleep is real important to you right now since the baby takes up all your energy. Tell him that if he refuses to take the cat out the room to go and sleep with him some place else. good luck with everything :)|`|cWxwotjcaa	you remind me of me when i was 10 weeks, But no the husband/bf is not suppose to be so rude to you..usually if you start crying they say sorry but, my husband does the "KNEW" i'd forget it thing, those things i dont worry about, and i've asked my husband before we were married or even engaged if he would travel around the world to find me and he would say no, if I love HIM then i wouldn't travel around the world he said. lol and the cat thing, if my husband ever had a cat i'd prolly through it out the door outside, cause i'm deathly allergic not only that is that my hormones would be so raging that i prolly would pick it up by the fur and through it out the door, prolly feel sad for it and just let it in the house only put it somewhere where you can't hear it lol. But thats just me and my hormones, and oh do they get worse! lol you have no patience anymore, and you feel like you wanna freak out on someone every day!|`|vjijiJT3aa	It's definitely your hormones and your looking for that extra attention and coincidentally things went the way they did today it's hard for a man to understand the changes in us when we become pregnant, maybe you should let him know how sensitive you are so he knows not to say the wrong things that he thinks doesn't bother you, communication is a beautiful thing.
rgOBHB5uaa	i would love to have a girl and name her sapphire|`|zGgUsEmdaa	I wouldn't mind to be honest. But I'd prefer to have a boy or maybe even two. xxx|`|RE6GBw0Baa	id of course be happy with either<br>  <br>  but i think my heart would be in a girl (maybe as im an only girl) <br>  and my fiance would love a girl aswell, i like so many girl names but no boys lol xxxxxxx|`|qfCRWAw0aa	I would love one of each to be honest but i would like to have a son first so that he could be the big protective brother over his little sister lol. <br>  <br>  If i was to just have the one i would like have a boy for my partner to have a son and watch and play footie with him. <br>  <br>  xxx|`|ZbZnIcoIaa	If I were to only have one child, I'd hope it was a boy. Much more fun for me to get all filthy in mud with toy trucks then play dress up and dollies. It's just my personality.<br>  <br>  I'd love them regardless. And I'd encourage my little girl to play in mud with me if I had one XD|`|TUNvbXbgaa	what ever god gave me..<br>  I have a son and i am grateful I have him cause i am not able to have anymore kids and not by choice.  If i had a daughter i would have loved her the same|`|w5uHiNcoaa	I wanted a girl before I was pregnant, but I had a boy. I wasn't disappointed - I knew I would love my child regardless.<br>  <br>  However, if I ever had another I would love another boy. I have found boys to be really easy to cope with (or maybe that is just my experience with my son). The other reason I don't really wish for a girl is my MIL - she really wants a granddaughter. Fair enough, but it would be a total nightmare! She is bad enough with my son, but it would be 10 times worse if I had a daughter. She would just buy the contents of every store that sold girls toys/clothes! I would be constantly at charity shops giving away the excess!|`|pZ4VxGrtaa	Well, i have a little girl & when i was pregnant with her i didnt really care what i had i just wanted it to be healthy. I too wanted to give my husband a little boy because he wanted one so badly. <br>  <br>  We are now TTC our second & again it doesnt matter what i have. I think it would be neat to have a boy this time because it would be something new since i already have a girl, but if i get another girl ill be just as happy :)|`|7XIWtNr6aa	I would prefer to have a girl. My first girl's name will be Adalyn Kate (Add-uh-lynn) There are so many cute names for girl (i.e. Braelyn, Abreana, Madison, Riley are some of my favorites) You should check out some baby name websites to find more girls names there are so many cute and unique names out there! Good Luck!|`|RPc63EK2aa	i have my first child now, a boy... I would prefer to have a girl for my second child...and i am thankful to have a son on my first child coz i like to have a boy first...hopefully God will give a girl when i get pregnant again...|`|3MEQeHtWaa	Well, part of me would want to have a girl to dress up and have everything pink for. The other side of me wants a little boy because they're much quieter, less needy, and love their mommas!|`|Ty4UC8GLaa	I'd rather have a boy first and then a girl. I don't know why, but I've always wanted an older brother, so that's probably it. LOL. I want to give my daughters the older brother I didn't have.|`|FAGI8owFaa	I would and do love what ever baby God gives me and so should you.|`|FR4fzr4Zaa	i would have both -x|`|oN9UNGZfaa	I would love to have a girl this time since I already have a boy but of course I will be happy to have a healthy baby
ZNhP3mpUaa	exactly like the one from the dr office, or one from a store?? if its one from a store, they NEVER work that well at all... not until at least 30 weeks for an at home dopplar... if its one from the dr office you may just have it positioned wrong... good luck!<br>  <br>  **That first guy doesn't know what he is talking about - Trust me!** ----- To that person a few spots down, that's a dumb @ss name. He'll be made fun of mercilessly. Our dopplar never worked. It has nothing to do with what "i don't know what i'm talking about". It's personal experience. @ss.<br>  <br>  If it works really well, try doing it when you know he or she isn't moving a lot. All that background noise is the baby along with blood whooshing through your body.|`|ftvxAS3saa	we are due the same time :)|`|C4ibOR7Laa	hey<br>  i rented one from hi-baby.co.uk for ￡10 a month, just like the ones in a dr office, i got mine when i was 10 weeks, and also i found the heartbeat was very low down, and i could also hear a swishing noise, this is the placenta, there is alot of blood flow down there and things moving around, the abby moving around, all the noises you can hear are all perfectly normal :)|`|xq7S9H5Raa	At 22 weeks, your baby should be at the level of your umbilicus or just an inch or two or what we call 1 finger breath above the belly button.  How much is the rental fetal doppler just curious.  If you are gassy, you might be hearing other sounds as well.  Remember that the womb is filled with fluid and sometimes you will be hearing some weird sounds.  I have placed women on monitors several times, and many times before finding the heart beat, you can also hear some weird sounds.  I would say that it is normal.|`|7HzfgRmwaa	definitely!! That's a great spot and where I heard my guy's ALWAYS until about 30 weeks or so. Then it got more difficult for me. The weird sounds could be your child moving and swishing around! :) I loved my doppler!<br>  <br>  **That first guy doesn't know what he is talking about - Trust me!**
381K9LJEaa	Im 19, i have a child, and i'm in the army...but i still sleep with my stuffed animal elephant i've had since i was one.  i don't have to...but i like to.  My mom never attempted to take it away from me and i'm glad she didn't...because now i have a toy i can hand down to my little boy.  the same with my step dad...he's 30 and now handing down his bear to my little brother. i don't think it's a bad thing to have that.  Let the child grow out of it...unless it's a pacifier or something like that.  When they are ready to let go...they will.|`|pUvEmPrCaa	It's usually not a worry if it's a young child unless it starts to interfere with their every day life.  That's when it becomes a problem.  If you're really worried about it becoming an issue you can talk to a doctor or a psychologist about it.  They can let you know if it's becoming a problem and what treatments you can try to get them to ween off of it.|`|AA11109728	I don't know - I've been wondering that with my own daughter.  She sleeps with a baby blanket and sometimes has it around the house with her (not a certain blanket, any baby receiving blanket will do), but I didn't know whether or not to try to 'wean' her from it or not.  I am WAY beyond the 'normal' age for needing a security item, but somehow I got too attached and still have my baby blanket that I sleep with.  There's a certain comfort it gives me that I don't get from anywhere else, and I can't imagine giving it up.  So I've been thinking that maybe I shouldn't let my daughter get to that point.  But then I would be being hypocritical.  As kids, my siblings and I were all allowed to have our blankets, with the only limit being they had to stay in our bedroom at a reasonable age, we couldn't carry them around the house.  (Unless we were sick!)  My younger siblings all grew out of that phase, so I don't know what my problem is!  LOL  And I'm still in a quandry about what to do when it comes to my daughter!|`|pT7jrsAgaa	My oldest son is 12 and he has a little pillow that he has slept with from infancy.  He never felt the need to carry it with him every where he went, but he still sleeps with it.  Why would you want to take something so obviously sentimental from them??|`|03n14OLLaa	I carried my pillow til kindergarten but still used it at night til i was ten. My sister used her binkey til she was three and a half. I would say that as long as the can go places without it they'll be fine.|`|hh403SkVaa	Well if it's a blnket it should be taken away at about 5. But things like pacifiers and such should be gone at 2 1/2<br>  <br>  Certain things differ|`|DNQxUcptaa	I hope not! I'm 38 and still have my blanket (which I still have with me every evening! - my excuse is that the cat likes to lie on it)|`|bTrxQLI4aa	No|`|cAtWxJG1aa	maybe if they're an age where carrying it around is causing them to be teased? beyond that, i don't see the harm.  and i'm guessing the teasing would often be successful in doing the detox by itself.<br>  <br>  most of my kids gave that stuff up early or never had it to begin with.  but my second daughter, who never really had such a thing to begin with, suddenly became desperately attached to a stuffed bunny when she started kindergarten.  we decided not to make a big deal about it and allowed her to bring it back and forth in her knapsack.  five months later, she doesn't need it anymore.  it served some sort of transitioning purpose for her, which is fine by me.  and fortunately her friends, many of whom apparently still have similar items, didn't give her a hard time about it at all.<br>  <br>  *geez, mozz, what sort of a mother would try to take away the only thing in the world that gives their child comfort?   ;-)  i suppose next you'll be coming after my donuts.|`|f66ce5d864eadcad29348fd4a9871771aa	i dunno i dont see anything wrong with having a favorite blanky and such, its doing no harm tot he child  like a  binky or something along those lines. my husband had a security blanket that his gran made when he was little, until he was 23 and an ex burned it (yeah she was a b**** lol) if it wasnt for her hed still have it, now he says im his security blanket lol   my 15 month old has a blanky....he chews on it and everything else.|`|AA12145826	I'm sure once it gets to the point where you have to stop EVERYTHING to find the item in question, that's when most parents realize that maybe its time to ween the child off of the item. Its up to you totally to determine how and when. I have many friends who got to keep their security item, but it had rules attached to it like it had to stay in the bedroom. Other's were like me, and had their item cruelly ripped (not really, but it was to me at the time) from them so they were forced to make due without it.<br>  <br>  I vividly remember waking up one morning, I think I was about 4, and what was left of my 'bankie' was GONE. I was inconsolable for like 2 days, but then I was fine. Some 14 yrs later, at my high school graduation party, I opened a present from my parents and there she was. The only surviving piece of 'bankie' (which wasn't a blanket at all, but a silky pillowcase that I became attached to when I was little) was a 3 inch wide, 24 inch long section of silky fabric & bit of old, yellowing lace. I was so happy to see it, you would have thought I was 4 again. It survived 4 moves, 2 colleges, and eventually became part of a quilt that hangs above our bed today. So, I guess I'm 28 and still have my security item.....does that make me weird?|`|wiAVa1H5aa	You don't, they are allowed when needed to take it into adulthood.  I took my blanket to my last labor and delivery, and I was successful in my VBAC - and I'm 36.   It's not a sign of disease or defect, but a kid who is successful in providing their own comfort when mom or dad are not available.   Just let them do it, it's not about you it's about them becoming independent.|`|Jo2DfRzaaa	I had a kitty that i slept with until my husband and i moved in together.  wasn't room in the bed for kitty and husband(well boyfriend at the time) so kitty was put away.  now my son sleeps with it.<br>  i would think as long as it is not interfering w/everyday life, its fine.  if it is interfering w/life then maybe get the kid a patch, that will help wean him/her off the said object.  slow and steady wins the race.  :-)|`|64eba52b7a7dcdb30b1e7b1223d7eb33aa	he normally substitutes one thing for another till one day.....he'll be armed to the teeth with all sorts of weapons trying to keep safe from something or someone
10b1R3ibaa	Well not exactly.<br>  <br>  But this one person asked a question that my best friend had asked me as a joke the day before so I was like what? It was actually quite scary.<br>  <br>  But no. Have never thought anyone might be a celeb.<br>  Why?<br>  Are you? :P|`|FLEXqVoiaa	Yes I have! Every time I read an article about a celebrity that had a baby, I always wonder if she uses Y!A. Or even if I see a "regular" mom at the grocery store or something, I wonder if she's on here. Yeah Y!A is a big part of my life lol.|`|oKiW2JwNaa	no i haven't thought about that one but i've thought about whether i may know someone like another mummy from a play group etc...<br>  <br>  they do have celebs on here sometimes but i think Y!A pay them and it's just to get a conversation going...|`|jsdDgIuRaa	Yes I am.|`|xXnFx6qLaa	I'm really Gwen Stefani...<br>  <br>  Shh.... Don't tell anyone! :)|`|CVdcrY3kaa	I've never thought anyone was a celebrity, but I always wonder what specific personality types come onto websites like this and whether or not we'd get along in person!<br>  <br>  Teeny Beeny, I always wonder if my friends who are mommies are secretly on here! Haha.|`|wFmL5tWEaa	Blue, Let me explain something to you please and I hope I don't bust your bubble. There are no such a thing as a celebrity, ok an actor, an actress, model, sports player ect ... these are just people doing a job and getting very well paid for that job. They can't walk on water, or fly through the air on their own, they are just people. <br>  <br>  It is the people that are  idolizing celebrities that make them valued so much, otherwise they would not be paid so much. If people in general would stop thinking that a celebrity were any better than the average person, this world would be a lot better off and the so called celebrities ego's would be put back in their  big heads and back on their shoulders where they belong.|`|0QYIbn1saa	I've never wondered if someone was a celebrity, but I have wondered on occasion if some of my contacts are co-workers or neighbors?!?!  I am imagining sitting here writing back and forth to people, only to find out they live right next door to me or something weird!!! (or they are sitting in the cubicle behind me at work, lol)|`|DKfScL8taa	The thought has never crossed my mind.|`|JnLoHaoAaa	I've never thought of it myself
vue9NOhYaa	99% certain it's a blocked duct.  Massage it to help break it up, and nurse in different positions so baby drains all the parts of the breast. <br>  <br>  (Breast cancer is VERY rare in a woman your age.)|`|uuHPneEcaa	it could just be ur milk ducts. But if it will make u feel better call ur doctor. U can never be to safe.|`|n3IoftMFaa	Breast get weird during breastfeeding - clogged ducts, changes in texture are all normal. Odds are - it is nothing HOWEVER - get an ultrasound done just to be sure. I was told it is very common for lactating women to find little bumps and lumps in their breasts. I found one too and freaked - went in, had it checked by ultrasound, it was nothing. But man was I ever worried. There is no need for you to worry, get it checked and rest easy.|`|9hggEdf1aa	just massage it while you are breastfeeding, it should break up.  it is normal in breastfeeding women.  When your milk comes in it is supposed to feel like pebbles.  Just make sure u massage it, i know it hurts a lot. Pumping could also help.|`|zwJbUbWMaa	You definitely need to go get it checked out.  It could be nothing but why risk it?|`|fd34d7830f1987fa091fa8de50613944aa	I had the same issue, and went to my OB/GYN to have it checked out. (I am 23, and was also breastfeeding my first chid at the time) She told me that it didn't feel abnormal, but ordered an ultrasound just in case. I went to get a closer look that way and the results were fine. It turned out to be nothing, but I felt better knowing for sure. You may want to get a closer look if it is still weighing on your mind. <br>  <br>  Take care!|`|pCZPtegeaa	It could be a clogged milk duct, or a calcified matter due to breastfeeding. Of course, it could be something much more serious (it's always a possibility), so if you're still feeling uneasy about it, you should definitely go get it checked out.|`|wphLaVs6aa	It's probably a plugged milk duct. Apply warm compresses and massage the area gently, from your chest toward your nipple. It should resolve on it's own but if not, call your doctor. Plugged ducts can lead to mastitis which requires antibiotics. <br>  <br>  If it is a plugged duct, you can sometimes avoid getting them in the future by drinking plenty of water, avoiding underwire bras, not sleeping on your stomach and avoiding lots of saturated fats in your diet. <br>  <br>  Visit kellymom.com for helpful info on this. <br>  <br>  And of course, if you don't see an improvement in a day or two, call your doctor. <br>  <br>  Congratulations on your new baby!|`|lGrcLQ49aa	Breast lumps are very common when nursing. Ducts swell and change as your baby eats. You should call your doctor because it never hurts to check these things out but in the mean time try not to worry to much - it is very common and in 99.9999999% of cases it has to due with nursing.|`|A5xpEfwuaa	I agree - get it checked.  I get lumpy when I don't nurse for a long time.  But, I too, just found a lump in my arm pit that doesn't seem to go away with nursing.  I'm getting checked out by a doctor.  Good luck!|`|YB3ULPPeaa	You could just have a clogged duct. Try putting a warm compress on it then massage it after a few minutes. Repeat if necessary. If it doesn't improve after a day or two, contact your doctor.|`|3CG3rby0aa	It sounds like you have a clogged duct in your breast.  I would call your doctor and talk to them about it.  you don't want your breast tissue to get infected so better to be safe than sorry.  good luck! :)|`|aYZXi6ffaa	Could be a breast infection although fairly common during nursing you are going to want to get this checked out.  Usually requires antibiotics.|`|AA12155794	Don't stop breast feeding at the sae time talk to a Doctor.That will bring your relief.Apparently seems to be nothing serious.
yUbR0NnRaa	As long as the person can afford the child and they have a bed of their own, they don't care who gets the kids...which is really disturbing.|`|2wyDALHgaa	I understand the cultural and logistical realities of this but I really can't see you being approved for an adoption at this time for a couple of reasons.<br>  <br>  First off, you don't have a stable home of your own.  Yes, you are living with family however you need to have a place of your own to raise the family and to bond together as a family.  The way things are, everyone in your household, your parents and siblings would have to be part of the adoption process and home study and it would just be too much.<br>  <br>  Secondly, and perhaps a larger area of concern is the fact that you are not together with your husband.  Yes, I understand it's not a relationship thing but the fact that you are physically separated due to work requirements means that he is unavailable to be part of the home study process and to give his consent for the adoption.  Your husband must be present and an active part of the adoption process and it cannot be done in his absence.  <br>  <br>  Regarding your bedroom question, each area has it's own guidelines however for the most part an adopted child doesn't need his/her own room.  They may share a room with another child assuming that the other child is the same gender and the age difference is not to great but again, it all depends on the local guidelines where ever you are.|`|OQnRP6xVaa	Everyone in the Household will be included on the Home Study.<br>  <br>  In many cases married couples need to be married for at least 2 years.<br>  And, Husbands must be included on the Home Study, interviewed and back ground tested.<br>  <br>  -- I think that at the age of 22 with a husband currently living in a different country it's too soon to be actually adopting. There is a lifetime ahead and it's hard to have a baby if there isn't any contact between married people...hard biologically and for an adopted child as well!<br>  <br>  I don't believe this arrangement would be considered a Problem once it is the Daughter and Her husband who provide the home for the aging parent... but, at 22 with siblings living in the Parent's home--I don't believe it is the case the child is supporting her adult parents and I don't believe it would appear that way until the adult daughter and husband were united and the home was theirs.<br>  <br>  It is not likely a 22 year old would be placed with a baby or child and less likely if she is living in her parents home--with an absent husband.<br>  <br>  time will change the situation.|`|RKcwfrGOaa	So the person's religion doesn't allow them to live independently, but it does allow them to adopt a child?<br>  <br>  I hope this would not be approved.<br>  <br>  ETA:  She's very young, and having an absent husband will not improve her chances of adopting.|`|AA11104372	I don't know about the living arrangements, but I think your age might be a problem.  A friend's daughter wanted to adopt a child she had been caring for int Haiti, but she wasn't allowed to, because she was under 25.|`|aed5cad075214254f2f176a51206a7d7aa	Yes.  They're interested in what's in your bank account, not what's in your home.

5EFc1QYbaa	I was like that with my 1st too.  We waited until he was almost a year and I found out I was pregnant with #2 when #1 was 11 months.  <br>  <br>  There are pros and cons to having them so close.  I love that they are close in age and they play together and will grow up together.  Being pregnant while chasing a 1 year old around is exhausting!  As is being up all night with an infant and dealing with the demands of an 18 month old all day!  Now that they are 1? and almost 3 years old things are starting to settle down.<br>  <br>  It's definately a challenge but totally do-able.  The bottom line is, if you and your partner are ready, and you're healthy enough, then go for it.|`|pXSKSS3daa	I'm definitely in your boat!<br>  <br>  Our son is 10 and a half months and I've started to REALLY want another in this past month or so. I love my son with all my heart and he is a wonderful little blessing but at the same time I feel like something is missing.<br>  <br>  I think we're going to try within the next two months. Well, that's what my husband said last night when we were talking about it. I'd love to start trying NOW but hopefully I can wait.<br>  <br>  If you're ready for another one now, go for it. Only you and your partner know if you're truly ready.|`|93e5e66462cba8bcd411219422deababaa	yeah honestly, i've been thinking about ti a lot lately- my son is 22 months and i knew i wanted to wait til he was about 4 because i like the closeness that we have and i want that time for him and i think he'll understand and prepare for it better at that age- that's what i think about. my fiance doesn't want any more kid however, he doesn't do anything to prevent it lol. i think he secretly does want more just hate to admit it. if i did become pregnant  again i wouldn't be upset lol<br>   if thats what you want then go for it|`|1hciyvKdaa	I did, but I loved my daughter so much, I didnt want to interupt my time alone with her, and didnt for several years, and then again with my son I waited a few years befroe  having my next daughter. That way they got moms full attention during those toddler years, Im really happy I waited too.|`|zFb022Iiaa	I don't think it's depression.  I think it's really common when your babies get to be like 3-4 years old and don't 'need' you as much as they did, but I haven't heard of it so much at 8 months.|`|iH2whFkHaa	I can't say I'm quite obsessed about it, but I do get tingly all over when I think about having another one lol.|`|e3i7FWw9aa	awww. you're just to attracted to him and filled with excitement and joy =]|`|eWObKmBSaa	Not only do you feel like having a new baby, you will also not know how you could ever love two children.  I remember feeling that way, I loved my daughter so very much, that I couldn't imagine feeling the same way about number two.  You do when the time comes, you can love a second as much as you love the first baby and love dad too.<br>  But wait a minute, there is so much to go thru loving and raising the first one.  Don't have a second baby yet, there is so much to love doing and going thru with number one baby.  You can watch the walk, hear them talk, see their first day in school, and the list goes on, and on.  There is plenty of time to have a second baby.  At least wait until the first one is 1 or 2yrs old.  Then have the second one and do not let them be 5yrs apart cause at that distance they can't enjoy each other.  Oh, yes, when you have more than one, they will enjoy each other.  My grandmother was one of 13 and they really all enjoyed each other.  NO, I am not saying to have 13 but wait until the first one is at least 1 or so to start making the second one.<br>  There is lots to do and learn, thru each one.  So, keep near the baby, watch close and learn lots.|`|UghJ0XROaa	I loved the idea of having another baby! I got pregnant when my oldest was 13 months old, THEN while i was pregnant the terrible two's started, and i spent my pregnancy going, "why, oh why, did i want another one" Now that i have both of them, i love having a baby again, but i think i would have waited until the oldest was out of the terrible two's before having the second one.|`|cab8f3eed982d7c810bf2e8fc14f2cecaa	I wouldn't say exactly obsessed, but the yearn to be pregnant and watch my belly grow is definitely there. I'd love to give Jeffrey a brother or sister. I am trying to make myself wait and just enjoy my son while he's little. I still want him to have time to be the baby. My husband and I have talked about it but sometimes he's serious and then other times he jokes about it. But last night I was talking about getting rid of some baby things or letting my cousin's wife borrow some things bc her baby is due later this year and he said " you better keep them bc you know we are having another" I was like WHAT! lol. But I dunno when we are truly going to start TTC. I say anytime after our son is a year old. For you and husband I say if you two talk it out and you guys are truly and emotionally ready for another little one.. Then go for it.|`|mldo1vxYaa	It could be hormonal or you could want another baby lol You just have to think if you can handle a 18 month old and a newborn, or would you like to wait a year or so and see all your sons firsts, and give him all your attention for another while before having another baby. Good luck either way.|`|74pfB2Bnaa	It is very normal. I feel similar. Right now I'd love to have eight children, one after the next, because having my daughter is so wonderful. (We can't afford that many, I just like the fantasy.)<br>  Right now I just plan how to name a new baby. Husband and I agreed to try for a second one, once baby is a year old.|`|AA10745032	yes i feel the same my daughter is 9 months and i am still in high school i wont another child but i also wont to go to college|`|GPW6HUZFaa	I have an 8 month old, and I don't feel that way.|`|7ocvtrZnaa	I feel like this sometimes, but I'm not a mom.|`|703c83fe1a687f02e99bde09a9966ecfaa	I felt like that for months, but we kept saying we couldn't try for another one because we couldn't afford it.  Finally, we decided God would take care of us and somehow get us what we needed for the new baby.  (We weren't in dire straits; just wanted to be a bit more prepared.)  Anyway, we finally decided not to TRY, but just to let what was going to happen happen.  We stopped using birth control and were pregnant the next month.  I am almost 17 weeks pregnant now and we are so happy.  God really has provided what we needed, mostly in the form of helping me figure out ways to save money.  We are even going to be able to afford a homebirth which is not covered by insurance.  I don't think God would give us a baby without also giving us the energy, love and resources to care for it.  Good luck!|`|djwe0T4Kaa	That's completely normal.. My son is also 8 months and I was feeling that way just after 4 months and got pregnant.. I just found out that I'm having another beautiful baby boy!! THey will be just 12 months and 2 weeks apart.. But I do have to warn you after I did get pregnant I felt horrible.. I didn't know how I could love another baby as much as I love my son.. But that wares of.. Talk with your partner and if you two think your ready then go ahead.. There are good things and bad things about having babies close together talk them out and I'm sure you will make the right decision for you!<br>  Good Luck!|`|be1526199d1ecf02c956ea2a8302d69faa	It sometimes can be related to postpartum depression. You feel a loss that you think can only be filled with that pregnancy. Go talk to your doctor about these feelings. Your new little baby needs your undivided attention and if you were to get pregnant now or even  a year from now you would take so much away from him.|`|2HeHPHaoaa	It's normal. But just think about your son and how old he will be when the new baby is born. He will really still be a baby and then all the attention would be on the new baby. Just give your son all of your attention for a little bit longer. =]|`|8hyxabYOaa	carpe diem! HAVE ANOTHER. why not? you have enough love to give, obviously. who cares if its hormonal? another baby is a BLESSING, and you are going to be a wonderful mother of 2! (:
YMoBKBjtaa	I LOVE LOVE LOVE the names Jasmine Hope and Gabriella Rose!!!! Those are two beautiful, beautiful names, and they really complament each other. Awesome choices!!!!!! Out of all of the sets, that combination would probably be my choice. I love them all, though!!! I just picked this one because I love both of the names (especially together!), and I've always thought that the nickname Lexi is beautiful, but I've never been too fond of the name Alexis. Even though I like it and everything, I just love the other two more!! Hope this helped - awesome names!! Best wishes =)|`|4qLhWtAjaa	Jasmine Hope and Gabriella is the better one|`|3MEQeHtWaa	i like jasmine, gabriella, and alexis.<br>  <br>  im not too fond of the middle names, im sorry.|`|AA11273571	Gabriella Rose and Alexis Faith.  Gorgeous !!!|`|1ad2771a77e03d1afa77d4cef9cdd54baa	Gabriella Rose and Alexis Faith|`|e663a3eea9acd94ea0c82d74d58bb3cbaa	I like Gabriella Rose and Alexis Faith.|`|AA11707606	I prefer Gabriella Rose and Alexis Faith.<br>  I dont' really like Jasmine that much.<br>  You could call them Gabby and Lexi which I think is really cute<br>  You could even go with Gabriella Hope so then Hope and Faith will be the middle names.  Very cute names.|`|IoQF4g1Gaa	I like Gabriella Rose and Alexis Faith! :)<br>  Not really a huge fan of Jasmine... No offence!|`|44x4QpStaa	I have 2 Granddaughters one named Jasmine and the other Gabriella both of their middle names are Marie|`|r0MgOWMjaa	Alexis sounds a bit roman. I like Jamine Hope and Gabriella Rose. Do you think Lola Rose sounds cute?|`|Lo5yiBqzaa	Gabriella Rose and Alexis Faith|`|Twe0U07Laa	Alexis Rose and Gabriella Faith|`|IYacMZCGaa	Alexis Faith|`|oYmZUO8Caa	I'm not a big fan of middle names like "Hope" and "Faith" .. just my opinion. But I do love the first name Jasmine.|`|O1HylylMaa	ooo i really like Gabriella Rose and Jasmine Faith....or hope. lol
bzkSIJYnaa	Aidan, the original way :)|`|AjqO1aJgaa	Aiden.<br>  <br>  What on earth is Aaden supposed to be? What you say at the dentist?|`|3Kqe5ZrPaa	Aiden :o)|`|mc6YtaRbaa	I like Aiden best.|`|gTiQLYCZaa	Aiden, but can i just say - his nickname wouldnt be very nice (aids)......... theres no other shorter way of saying his name than that, but if your ok with that then never mind lol|`|1ad2771a77e03d1afa77d4cef9cdd54baa	Aiden|`|cZS1upPxaa	Aiden :)|`|pDrdCRQcaa	Aiden|`|ZCT2mKmaaa	aiden|`|e663a3eea9acd94ea0c82d74d58bb3cbaa	Aiden, because that is how I pronounce it.|`|bMZ7lOfVaa	I like Aiden the best.|`|c73QkZ2haa	I like Aiden but we used Aidyn for our son...all our kids have a Y in their names.|`|rM67ueF5aa	Aidan, which is the original Irish spelling, is my favorite, but I also like Aden.|`|oYmZUO8Caa	Aidan. If I had to pick one of the popular types of names like that though, I prefer Caden, Kayden or Jayden.|`|Lo5yiBqzaa	Either Aiden or Aidan.|`|6QmVSwhsaa	I like Aiden, or Aidan but anyway you spell it its the same name so dont stress over it. Its a cute name|`|IYacMZCGaa	i prefer Aaden|`|r0MgOWMjaa	Aiden i think is better.|`|MW1yrHbOaa	aiden|`|IPl3Yh1kaa	It depends on how you want people to pronounce it. I'm assuming you want Aiden=  pronounced Ay-den<br>  <br>  The other two are fine, but you run the risk of him being called Ay-dan (Aidan). With the other name it could be pronounced Ahh-den (Aaden)
3f0439ebe7cdf100832cada550ab973caa	Others who judge or bully do so to boost their own self worth and confidence, due to being jealous of the person of whom they are bullying.<br>  Good on you babe for having the confidence in which they lack to put yourself out there, dont let these people bring you down.<br>  <br>  If your being bullied at school than it is a school issue and they need to address it as your well being and education is important and many school's dont condone bullying in any form.<br>  Have your folks go into the school for a private chat with your home room teacher/principal/sch councillor and have it sorted.<br>  <br>  You deserve to be proud of your accomplishments not discouraged.|`|VkvhtD4daa	you shouldnt have deleted them in the first place. when you get famous then they wont be talking then. they might even be working for you soon.|`|RoTLnFGZaa	just flip them off<br>  & go on with your life.<br>  who cares what they think?|`|gTiQLYCZaa	hunny, your o.k. at singing but your not the greatest.. but dont let that put you down, keep going till you reach your goal, and im not saying this in a bad way - but maybe get some singing lessons? mostly all the famous people had singing lessons when they were young and look at them now.<br>  <br>  dont worry about those bitchy girls, they obviously havent got anything better to do with their lives.|`|oKZ3GstXaa	i have a hard time believeing this, beig that u keep putting up videos, and you stuff like im so good.<br>  <br>  srry, just ignore them wow ppl in ur school can be so cruel|`|Av9jeRAkaa	that sad, just keep posting them up, and they will leave you alone, cause they will know they did not break you|`|eabe4c3a6e53ede1a2078c8d7dfcf4b7aa	I think that you have a voice but that it needs some work and a singing lessons. You seem very timid...but I think that with some work and with a stronger voice you could be great!<br>  <br>  In the meantime odn't worry about the peopl at school....they are jealous you have enough guts to post yourself singing and they are too scared to do the same
IuzaNq2Uaa	Well I love medieval names, so naturally I adore both of them.<br>  <br>  I think Héloise is one of the most interesting women of the Middle Ages; I've read her letters and she was an extraordinary woman and scholar.<br>  <br>  I'm slightly less keen on Mélodie, but it's very pretty and so much more interesting than Melody.|`|n3IoftMFaa	I love that name, so much so, I named a cat Eloise. I called her Ouiza for short.<br>  <br>  Edit: Hehe, whoops, I am not too good at the "follow basic directions" thing you know? Well, I like Heloise as well. The issue will be how irritated by other people's ignorance you will be. You will for ever be saying "No, the H is silent" and having people go "How do you say that name? Hell-oh-is? Hell-oise?"|`|xQwmHlU6aa	My name is melody!!! I love that name and I have never met any1 else who has it. Heloise is pretty too and original!|`|fD1ZJsUaaa	I think Eloise is pretty.|`|0hxK0khKaa	Heloise-hmm. I love Eloise/Louise/Louisa, so you'd think I'd like this one too. It's pretty and unique, but I don't like the spelling. It would get pronounced wrong. I could see someone pronouncing it Hell-ooh-eez and nasty nicknames spawning from it.<br>  <br>  Melodie-beautiful, but I couldn't see myself naming a child Melodie. Maybe a Greek princess in a book or a mermaid in a book, not my own daughter though.<br>  <br>  =]|`|rM67ueF5aa	I LOVE French names, and I think these names are beautiful! Although I must say, I prefer Melodie.|`|oYmZUO8Caa	I think they both have really great origins. Very cute - both the derivatives and original names.|`|pDrdCRQcaa	Eloise and Melody are beautiful|`|1YHn7PRDaa	I love Greek names and I think Melodie is beautiful!!|`|34ikhhtMaa	I love Melodie! It sounds so beautiful and flowing.|`|2NvRZv7Uaa	the name Eloise is really nice , but i like the name Melodie better. It sounds beautiful :)|`|VHHis05Naa	I like Heloise, but prefer Eloise.  That will be this baby's name if it's a girl.  Not a fan of Melody/ie.  It sounds like someone with a cold trying to say Melanie and there are just a lot better names out there.|`|5DK546BUaa	Héloise: personally, I don't think the name is bad, but prefer the simpler, and IMO, prettier Eloise...<br>  <br>  Mélodie: I like this version better then the common Melody, which has always seemed somewhat "low-income" to me. I would probably only recommend it as a middle name though...<br>  <br>  HTH :)
OQnRP6xVaa	It's called Adoption Insurance.... and it is out there for those who want to protect certain business investments. <br>  <br>  The PAP's won't lose their investments if they choose to adopt a baby or child who is ALREADY born and Legally Free for adoption. It's far less risky to choose to adopt a baby or child who is waiting to be adopted. <br>  <br>  I guess, if a parent must have that new baby smell then they need to roll the dice and hope to score. Otherwise, It's just to easy to avoid this risk completely...<br>  <br>  There are hot lines for people with gambling problems.|`|pzLDXL6gaa	No. I don't like the idea that they should be allowed to pay expenses, I mean it seems nice and helpful and all at first glance, but when you think about it, that's putting awful pressure on the mother. And yeah it's like a monetary exchange for a person, not cool.<br>  <br>  Harriet|`|8Qxb7OZOaa	I think they are owed "jail time" just like adults that sexually seduce minors.|`|nESfk0bXaa	If so, then I guess every guy who dated a woman and paid for the dates would be OWED the money back, if she decided not to marry him.<br>  <br>  Potential adopters are gambling (and manipulating) an an emotionally vulnerable woman by courting her.  <br>  <br>  If it doesn't work out that's their problem/loss.  This sort of arrangement should be illegal, it's mercenary.|`|Py1oiwYQaa	Nobody is owed a baby. I think it is pretty clear that expenses paid are not a guarantee of getting a baby. Anyone who thinks differently is pretty misinformed. Potential adopters should be careful about what they agree to pay since they may not end up with a child (and thus have more expenses down the road when trying to find another match).|`|NoUkTQCgaa	The only thing they are owed is a T-Shirt that reads, <br>  "I tried to buy a baby and all I got was this lousy T-Shirt"  <br>   <br>  Any time a mother is given cash, or gifts, or having her medical bills & living expenses paid for by pap's is coercion. Period.|`|ee7335f3bdae606bbfe534bef63fe2e0aa	The only one "owed" anything is the baby, it is owed a loving home.|`|cd98c09cc34c3c84ad4502d636e2d2beaa	There is an analogy to this.  Until the feminist movement spoke up about it, it was an "unspoken rule" that if a man took a woman out on a very expensive date and paid for everything himself, then she "owed" him sex.  In the 50s and 60s, date rape in these situations was not uncommon and was never prosecuted.  How does this differ from prostitution, the idea that expending money on someone meant you were "owed sex" from them?  <br>  <br>  Similarly, with "pre-birth expenses" -- how is this different from human trafficking?  You are paying someone with the expectation of something being given in return. <br>  <br>  The last time I checked, prostitution (and soliciting for purposes of prostitution) and human trafficking were illegal. Definitely immoral anyway.|`|BTuFtui3aa	No, any expenses paid are a considered a gift under law, and at their own legal risk.<br>  <br>  Personally, I think paying expenses is a bad idea, as it sets up a weird and coercive dynamic, so I wouldn't recommend it. It's better to seek financial support from the state, which is without those emotional complications.<br>  <br>  But no, a baby is a person, not property, and can't be "owed" to anyone else.|`|511e806a702f7f4b678843ad2696165faa	I would have to say NO.  I think buying the first mother anything before the baby is born is coercion, and baby buying.  It is one more guilt tactic to make things go smoother for the a-parents.  I hate thinking that people would be that shady, but it happens.  I think if the woman decides to go through with parenting after all that, it really is a lesson learned for the PAPs.  They should know better.  I think charges could and should be brought up in cases like that, because it IS baby buying.|`|0x8Q6rFPaa	Of course they aren't.  But I can see where they would feel that way.  After all, paying a woman's expenses is a transparently obvious gambit to make her feel as if she owes someone the baby.  Why else would the PAPs do it?<br>  <br>  Private adoption is distinguishable from outright baby-buying only in its finer points, like this one.|`|AA12127693	No, I do not believe that a Potential Adopter is OWED anything.  Babies are not "electronics with extended warranties" - they are humans that at all cost should be raised with his/her natural - first - biological mother.|`|DmJFln79aa	No.  The only thing they are owed, is the truth, like everyone else involved in the 'traid'.|`|Ah6FJHkWaa	No, and this is why not expenses should be paid.  Then it is like they are buying the baby, or buying the woman off!|`|AA11987492	Nope, they are owed a swift kick in the *** for trying to buy a baby!|`|Afoabqblaa	No, they are not owed a baby, but the birthers should not be allowed to milk people out of their money either.  The ones who go running to the adoption agency to be matched as soon as they find out they are preggo and then expect people to spew money hand over foot and really have no intention of putting the kid up for adoption...they should be persecuted to the fullest extent.<br>  <br>  Things work BOTH ways...this whole picking the parents before the birth should be illegal...BOTH parties are given the opportunity to play the other one.  Birthers should not be OWED all their living expenses either...right?|`|rD03JBxmaa	No, they are not owed anything.  But I also consider the other side of the coin.  I don't think birthmothers are "owed" any kind of money for choosing adoption for their baby.  That, to me, is selling their baby.  I don't agree with living expenses and medical expenses being paid by adoptive parents.
Bg6txvxqaa	Sometimes, it is possible to just miss a period. Also, stress can also play an important part in any woman's monthly cycle.<br>  <br>  Perhaps she should go to the family planning centre instead of her doctor and explain to them what happened with her doctor.<br>  <br>  If she prefers not to do that, or they won't do anything as she's not registered with them, then she should just wait another week as her hormones may have increased even more then and will be picked up more easily on the pregnancy test.<br>  <br>  She should also try first thing in the morning when taking a test rather than in the afternoon or night, but if she has to do it then, she should wait at least an hour between going to the toilet before taking a test.|`|2jrffIoWaa	Tell her to take a test (non-digital) with her first morning pee.  I'm waaay late for my period (like 3 weeks) and I just now finally got a positive urine and blood test!  Tell her that she has every right to switch doctors - the one that she's using sounds like a jerk.<br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|bTlhBX3daa	Your friend really needs to take the test first thing in the morning. That is when the pregnancy hormone called HCG will be highest and easier for the test kit to detect. Also, she might want to try urinating in a cup and dipping the tester (I find it much less messy, and that way you never miss the stick). <br>  <br>  If she takes more than one test in a day, she needs to allow a couple of hours (at least 3 or 4) between tests to allow the HCG to build back up again. <br>  <br>  And lastly, if she keeps receiving negatives, but she really feels that she IS pregnant, she might want to try another Dr. or INSIST that her Dr. gives her a blood test. It HAS happened that women have gotten pregnant before and tested negative on more than one home test kit.<br>  <br>  Good Luck to your friend.|`|KOwzDLPdaa	She should try a non digital test. They can actually be more accurate because it will show a faint line if there is only a little of the hormone present, where a digital one has to have a set amount to be a clear yes or no. It is possible she may just be stressed over her boyfriend going away. If she continues to get negative results and still gets no period than she should see her doctor.|`|mPyN2XX3aa	It's possible but is she stressed about her BF leaving.  that can delay a period.  My hubby (navy) went over seas for 7 months and I was 35 days late.  It was all stress/emotion related.|`|z8jYprWkaa	Tell her to ask her doc for a second opinion|`|Bn5JoVlLaa	she should so the test first thing in the morning\!!<br>  her hormone levels will double every day so she should b getting a positive reading now if she is 2 and a half weeks late!!<br>  tell her to change doctor he sounds like a prat.. a good doctor will do blood test and give her a proper answer..<br>  good luck either way.. u sound like a good mate!|`|4cb963eba368dee39158676d407eba2caa	I think she should just see her GP. It will put her mind to rest if shes not..and if she is then she knows and can plan for whatever she wants to happen.|`|ZVTYhwRiaa	I do not  no anything really .|`|7DG99jUnaa	sounds like she pregnant or have stress
WIEPISyeaa	Hey!  <br>  <br>  I know how you feel about everyone around you getting pregnant without even trying.  Two of my girlfriends got pregnant in the last couple of months by "accident."  Oh gosh that kills me!  :(<br>  <br>  Anyway, I'm taking clomid 50mg this month.  (We've been TTC for 6 months now....)  But I'm not charting or anything... I figure if I ovulate I ovulate and we baby danced at least every other day to make sure we didn't miss anything. :)  <br>  <br>  I'm on cycle day 24.....but I think I probably ovulated late (if I ovulated at all), so I won't test for another week or so.<br>  <br>  Anyway, that's my update.  Good luck to you....baby dust to all of us!!!!!!!|`|WnlzScIyaa	I am my 15th month of trying. We tried the whole taking a break thing also, but it didn't work! I quit counting days and doing opk's and charting and all that good stuff! But it is just hard to get your mind off baby! It is really hard for me not to think about it when we do BD! We are back at trying at it again, but I am not as obsessed with it, and I am having more fun with my husband now when we do try, instead of just focusing on making a baby! Good luck girl, Hope you get your BFP soon!|`|nVeZzuFvaa	Still hoping! Ive only been TTC for a few months...its so frustrating to see all these 16 year old pregnant girls that werent even trying to get pregnant ha! I was in line at the Dollar Tree yesterday..buy some cheap tests, and there was one pregnant lady, and another woman with a baby in front of me in line. I was like...please let this be a sign! ahah! I see babies and pregnant woman everywhere. I swear I am losing it lol.<br>  <br>  Good Luck to everyone TTC! Baby Dust!!!!!|`|4V4m2uZ5aa	Hi!<br>  I just started TTC #3 this month. I guess I'd better get the attitude you have. Just sit back and relax. I know that's what my husband would like for me to do. lol  I think I have him totally stressed out.(hee/hee)<br>  So I'm just going to chill out and let whatever happens happen.<br>  LOTS OF BABY DUST TO EVERYONE!!!!!!!|`|8DEiCLZUaa	Totally agree w/ you.. These past 6 months have been driving us CRAZY. But we just bought 1 more thing to help us along & now that's it, we're gonna leave the rest up tp God, he keeps saying it will happen when we dont plan a night of baby sex. Soooooooooo many of people we know just turned up pregnant, (5) can you believe it & they werent even trying, Get this, they all swear it was a night they went out had a few drinks, went home, got crazy & now they all have baby's on the way. That was when i said you got to be F***** kidding me. I cried for 2 days!!!! He was so sad to but didnt want me 2 get discouraged so he kept saying dont worry, It's coming I know it. It's a sign hat we're next..Now we planned a whole weekend out w/ our friends to relax have a drink & not worry at all for the next 3 days... I'll keep my fingers crossed for all of us..|`|FASzVGrraa	just wanted to say good luck and tons and tons and TONS of baby dust to us alll! ((: dont give up! the unexpected happens when u least expect it! <3|`|qH1YcQ2kaa	i am not due for my period til the 22nd.. but i'm hoping lol. my husband couldn't wait and made me take a hpt 2 days ago but it was negative lol. that is probably the best thing to do... just quit trying. i've always heard thats when you will get pregnant. so good luck!

aiDV9FgGaa	and Dorothy needs some decorations. I bet she gets bored swimming around in an empty bowl.|`|sWrh00J3aa	I agree!|`|AA11337296	I think it suits Elmo.|`|BypjotRpaa	and the drawer too!!!|`|HXfHkoSHaa	What I'm concerned about is the freaky man that is always outside the window.  I can't remember his name.<br>  <br>  Edit:  now I remember, Mr. Noodle.  Yikes, and his brother too.
14JQ11AUaa	Absolutely, I go in and peak on him while he is sleeping! He is so darn precious, I get excited when he wakes up, he is usually all smiles :) My son is 5 months old and we are yet to separate! The longest he has been away from me was 6 hours and he was with his daffy. This Saturday my mother in law is going to babysit for like 3 hours, we are going to the movies. I am so going to miss him...I am worried he might freak out??? It will be the very first time he is away from both me and his father!!!|`|RPc63EK2aa	ohhh, that is so sad, u will be far from ur little one...really its sad for 2 1/2 days...<br>  i miss my son everyday, he is 2 months old,  i am at work, when i reached home he is sleeping already..that's why even he is sleeping i used to kiss and hug him, then he will be awake..|`|JnLoHaoAaa	My baby is 18 months and to be honest I don't miss her. She's right in the other room safe and sound. Now for 2 1/2 days I would definately miss her!|`|OgzHcNMsaa	My husband comes in from work late and when he does he always wants to wake up our daughter because he misses her...then he'll  hug her and kiss her in her sleep...|`|h85kkDsbaa	My son is 6 1/2 months and yes i miss him soooooooo much, not so much when hes sleeping but if i am apart from him which has only been once for a few hours. i am returning to work in 6 weeks, luckily i work in a nursery so he will come with me but i wont be allowed to see him much - not looking forward to that :(|`|e44b849c03813ab357cd9f858138dd8eaa	My baby boy is 11 weeks old and yes I do miss him when he's sleeping. I find myself just staring at his sweet little face and smiling when he's laying in his crib. I love him so much !!!  I haven't been away from him yet and don't want to for a while.|`|TQg7yubGaa	My 4 month old daughter sleeps with me,  but when she naps or sleeps in I miss her.  Even though its not a really long time, its just long enough to make me sad...|`|WirFwirLaa	Wait til your little one is 13 months old...I love my son dearly but some days I love him more when he's sleeping! Haha..|`|CVdcrY3kaa	I do! My daughter is 7 months old and if I wake up before she does I'll start to wait around until she's awake so I can spend time with her. When my husband is gone for training I'll usually let her finish out the night sleeping with me after her 3am feeding, it's nice.|`|03ec65bf77c70de35e61bf195676e487aa	No, I always enjoyed the time to be able to get things done.
OXXE3T2Aaa	omg that is so scary who knows if she done this anywhere else this makes me not want to buy baby food what is this world coming too they should poison her stupid *** and see how she likes it.|`|aYZXi6ffaa	Disgusting!  Totally disturbing!|`|xLNl0f14aa	that is outrageous ..what would be the point to harm innocent children. i hope she hasnt actually attempted this before.|`|V6dz395kaa	i read it, thats horrible!|`|2r6ZJz13aa	shes was creepy looking. thats discusting and heartless. whats up with people these days???|`|93e5e66462cba8bcd411219422deababaa	won't be using that stuff- didn't hear of that but not it makes me never want to purchase that crap though i am more for BLW anyway|`|ZSSUfSXwaa	OMG!! She's crazy!!! She's in violation of her probation??? Maybe she shouldnt have gotten probation in the first Place!!!|`|jsdDgIuRaa	She was already on probation so obviously this isn't her first offense.<br>  <br>  Well it happens with everything, look at the sicko with the peanut factory who has killed and sickened people and now filing bankruptcy so he can't get sued.  <br>  <br>  That's the world we live in.<br>  <br>  Maybe we need to adjust our laws so these people can't just be freely roaming around committing crimes or they need to get the mental help they need, my guess is she'll get out of jail again and do something else.|`|Po2UqfvWaa	yep, heard it on the news. people are mentally unstable. sad really|`|AA10803292	yeah, she clearly needs help; wonder what her 21- year old is like...|`|3K7ffKn2aa	that is ridiculous what the heck is her problem?
XwQxKwRcaa	Thank you! You are making a stand here that will influence the way your daughter conducts the rest of her life. <br>  <br>  May Jesus shine down on you for setting a higher standard before it's too late!<br>  <br>  What she needs is a cash card, and the guys who are asking for her sexual favors need to fill her cash card full of currency before they fill her up with cu.....oh, no need to be vulgar here.<br>  <br>  This way she will have something that she can really use for her future, as opposed to a rather disposable game.<br>  <br>  Good luck to your daughter and God Bless you!|`|yXx1nB0Qaa	Sell her Wii....|`|OIsaEGBSaa	How much can I get for Zelda, Mario Party 8, Mario Super Sluggers, and Fire Emblem?

Wii prostitution is a problem in this country, and needs to be wiped out completely. <br>  <br>  If she's underage. <br>  <br>  Teach her there are other ways to manipulate people than with sexuality. Or teach her to just steal them. Or just buy them for her. <br>  <br>  Seriously, get a counselor with her. Explain the definition of the word "whore," and tell her how Anna Nicole ended up and ask her if she wants to end up in the same boat.|`|9NfLuHo9aa	She's taking Wii games and doing stuff? wow i guess would to be tell her the risk involved and how talk may get out and how she would be viewed  but stress on the risks involved and how somethings aren't worth losing your self respect and dignity over especially a Wii game which people will forget after some years but will always remember what you began doing at what age and with whom and why|`|6e288ecbc1c5be925d92b9a8de77cd7baa	ok this i kinda a huge problem: i think u should talk to her and let her know that what shes doing shows her lack of maturity therefore if she continues to do this u will take her wii away.or u can buy her the wii games urself!|`|oyINZiNDaa	wow maybe you should of led a better example for your daughter..thats pretty trashy....maybe you should monitor her more...??? sounds like a pretty good idea to me....|`|7XIWtNr6aa	Sell the Wii.|`|7F5fBdZoaa	Take away the wii|`|8e5YBwd7aa	Hide it from her.|`|VFJGRigZaa	Is this for real????
MFsuN8Doaa	No, they can't refuse it. I recently got signed of work for two weeks - being signed off sick does not effect the holiday you can recieve and in the UK, they are required by law to give you your holiday either before or after your leave.|`|mc6YtaRbaa	No, they can't refuse the Dr.'s note as for the 14 days holiday as long as you request those days per your departments guidelines they can't be denied. If you follow their guidelines for taking holidays and they deny it they can have a lawsuit on their hands.|`|O7QyQl15aa	No they cannot, you are allowed to take hols before or after and also I think it would be very unreasonable for them to refuse the request.  If they do (which I very much doubt) then get more sick leave.  If your holiday runs from april to march then they must let you take them or pay you for them, otherwise they can be seen to be discrimiating against you as a pregnant woman!. Alternatively arrange to take more sick leave and then get them to pay for they holiday owed?  Just an idea (you get more that way!- thats what I did!)
vTfEYeKQaa	If your period isn't due for another 2 weeks or so, the headaches could be from ovulation. Count from the first day of your last period...you should ovulate around the 14th day. If this is a day or two before or after when you had sex, then it might be possible that you are pregnant, but since you used protection and you're on the pill, it's very unlikely unless the condom broke and you've missed some pills.  The symptoms you are having are probably just ovulation.|`|RvSHQtrXaa	Do not encourage an abortion.  I know of a lady who did an abortion and often times she sees the baby appearing in front of her she killed.  That bouncing baby could be the next doctor or president of your country. <br>  <br>  Migraines can be associated with a rush of your hormones caused by the pill, every other feeling is a chain of reaction.  Take that pregnancy test or do an ultrasound to check if there is an underlying problem; perhaps like fibroids or any other developing pathology.<br>  <br>  There is something that is triggering your bad feelings.  Get to your gynaecologist urgently.|`|ZZMkENyeaa	considering it's only been six days, i'd say it's a bit early, but I read on some websites that it's possible to start feeling certain symptoms as early as the first week. As for abortion, It depends, in some places it's 12 weeks, some will go up to 24 weeks. If you need to find this information, you can ask your dr. or look it up on numerous websites online. Good luck..|`|d8mkzFf7aa	I believe the latest you can get an abortion is 15 weeks.|`|SVwsRUIUaa	It'd be impossible to know at 6day pregnant. I didn't find out till 2months with my first and 1month with my second.
2932ee4950edd4f131a711d029cc8528aa	you should be fine, we're spreading out my son's shots and he's still considered up to date. i know my county's health dept will give the shots for free if you are not ablle to pay too, check with yours|`|3NoDjKLoaa	first off you should get him back on medicare... just reapply.. (i dont know where you live) but here it shouldnt have expired until he was 1 year.  Your son still needs the last installment of some of his shots and also will be getting his first mmr and other important vaccinations, as others said you can probably find somewhere that will do them for free, but you should check out the medicare anyway.. babies can get sick so easily you dont want to be without something to be able to take him to the pediatrician.|`|KyFCYs0Yaa	I agree that you should call the health dept. They can vaccinate him as well as do lead testing (which they usually do around a year). Vaccinations are very important, but if you choose not to for other reasons (other than lack of insurance or money) you can sign a waiver with day cares and schools. Talk to your childcare director about this. She will be able to help you.|`|zFb022Iiaa	Most cities have a health department where vaccinations are free.   I have insurance, but I used them, because they were free and in the doctors office I had to pay a copay.  Check it out.  It might be city or county.|`|ZZzQLjaKaa	Call your local county health department. They will do it for free or an extremely low cost sliding scale. You can bring him up to date. Do not let lack of insurance stop you,.|`|YmvL9ctLaa	check with a pediatician  that accepts medical. they have a 30 day medical insurance at no cost but it will run out in exactly 30 days. Also check with healthy families insurance. Hope this helps|`|BzvstX7uaa	Local Health Departments give free shots. To every child<br>  <br>  <br>  That's how my son got MOST of his.|`|M6c0hUefaa	I agree with the other posters. Most Health Departments will either give shots for free or put you on a sliding scale payment plan to help you with the expenses.
w0eRRsoVaa	I would leave it up to your husband.|`|Kl1h5dCaaa	I probably would give them the info.<br>  <br>  I am an honest person, by nature, and if someone like a Mortgage company rang and asked me for a number, I would tell them if I had it or not.<br>  If they rang your Husband he is obviously listed somehow on their contact details, so yeah.|`|AA12145826	Heck yes I would have given them her number, I would have also told them to take us off the contact list from then on. She is his "ex-wife" and not his current wife for a reason!|`|Fkl6gV8Qaa	Tough question. It really depends. I think that it is seriously wrong to knowingly not pay for someting if you have the money so I would have probably given them the number. I know I'll probably get a lot of thumbs down on this but the fact is they are going to find them sooner or later and the later it is the more trouble they can get in so I think that it is what it is. I'ts obvious that they know that this company is looking for them because they keep moving and they changed their number.|`|obmdKeP0aa	yes, i would. and by the way some phone companies don't let you take your same phone number with you when you move|`|cAtWxJG1aa	no, i would not have given the info to the mortgage company.  if you're on good terms with them, i'd tell them they should carefully consider their lifestyle because they are getting themselves into some serious trouble.|`|epBOAXUraa	Chances are this wasn't the mortgage company but investigators working for a debt collection/recovery firm.  My ex flatmate robbed me off money and I received a call two years later looking for info on him.  I shopped him of course!<br>  If you aren't bothered about this women (and unless there are kids involved I would advise not to be) I would give them her info.  however if you want to keep on good terms, I would ask the 'mortgage company' for their contact number and give it to the ex's new husband.  it is then up to him to contact them.
OXxKTM6vaa	Trinity Faith<br>  Trinity Hope<br>  Trinity Jane<br>  Trinity Grace|`|s2F6pK9Xaa	I don't care for it. it's kinda "Trailer Trash-y" where I live.<br>  <br>  Do NOT use Faith as a middle name- people will think you are religious fanatics. Unless you are, then it's acceptable.|`|pDrdCRQcaa	Well since it is religious, Faith, Grace, Hope would all be great middle names. I think it is a great name simply based on it's meaning.|`|e663a3eea9acd94ea0c82d74d58bb3cbaa	I love that name! How about Trinity Grace or Trinity Hope or Trinity Faith?|`|D1vWRwOaaa	Trinity is a nice name..depends on the second name..|`|xuhTe9X8aa	Call her Trinity College Oxford surname.... lol stupid name.|`|AA11273571	Don't care for Trinity but Trini (TREE-nee) might be cute.|`|yULWldR4aa	Sweet, not sure what with|`|JfwdDJxGaa	no. please do not name your child trinity.<br>  I hate all names like this, all the hope faith trinity heaven angel blah e blah names.<br>  <br>  HOW FCUKING GHETTO DO YOU PEOPLE WANT TO BE!<br>  <br>  Sorry if that was rude. but after 10000000 questions a day with stupid namesliek this you get pretty ticked off. <br>  Also.

ey8aWCPUaa	Get the disgusting, perverted, creepy, pedophile arrested and fired.<br>  <br>  Someone who would do something like that to your child is VERY disturbed.<br>  <br>  Wouldn't you agree?

7DWy8mPZaa	You can temp vaginally or orally in either way you mentioned. Some women prefer one way or another but the trick is continuity. If you temp on the side of your cheek - stick to that method through your cycle. Also, it's common to note a little variance, depending on where you temp so don't panic! Vaginal temps are often higher than oral ones, even in the same women using both methods. You want to keep everything as similar each day that you do BBT as possible. This goes for thermometer positioning, time of morning etc. Personally, I go for under the tongue to the side, that's just what came naturally to me!<br>  <br>  You'll still be able to catch your surge, even with the days missing. It's not always possible to chart everyday, I'm the same! (although we all know we should!) Keep going everyday from now on, especially through this mid-part of your cycle when most women are likely to ovulate and notice their surge. Doing it everyday from now on will just make it clearer to pinpoint the day you ovulated rather than having a few days to guess between.<br>  <br>  Your temp reading is perfect and very normal indeed. Most women will have a range between the high 96s to the mid-97s until ovulation, where it spikes at least 0.2/0.4 to the high 97s/ range in the 98s. Keep your eyes peeled! Three days consecutively of high temps should give you your coverline.|`|BaXruEcqaa	I would think you would put it under your tongue, like a normal thermometer.  You will get the best reading that way.
zwJbUbWMaa	It could be a miscarriage and it could be that you were never actually pregnant.  Just the fact that you still have never had a positive test makes that likely.  Lots of times when you really want to be pregnant your body will start giving you pregnancy symptoms and your period will come really late.|`|7AYnWg3paa	coulod be a chemical prengnacy or just a period...who knows....doesnt matter now either way|`|zuZKj3xXaa	it shouldn't be a miscarriage.. if it is, its not because of the sex.....Bleeding blood clots might be something to worry about :( but you said nothing about how much.. spotting is normal :) 5 weeks, mild cramping is normal.. but if either or even one of them gets worse, you really need to go see  your doctor...<br>  <br>  good luck, but i really think everything is Fine :)<br>  <br>  39 weeks pregnant today!!!<br>  1 week to go!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! "or less lol"|`|NiOjHyfKaa	CALL OR GO TO  A DR OR ER AND TELL THEM ABOUT YOUR SUSPICIONS AND ABOUT WHATS GOING ON ...  DO IT ASAP!|`|3f0439ebe7cdf100832cada550ab973caa	First thing's first hun, how heavy is your bleeding and do you know for certain you were pregnant?? By that I mean have you had a blood test to confirm the pregnancy??<br>  I've had two miscarriages one at 8 wks and one at 10 weeks on both occasions I was in a heap of pain and couldn't sit upright.<br>  If unsure head to your GP/MD or to your local ER to be assessed.<br>  <br>  My bleeding with both miscarriages were different put with both both I experienced excruciating pain.<br>  There's no defiant answer for a miscarriage it just happens, my partner and I have 2 older children 8 and 6 and when we were trying I was told i was allergic to his sperm, now we have a beautiful 3 month baby that came to us when least expected.<br>  <br>  Our wants can reek havoc if our bodies aren\t ready.|`|UFu0h8SKaa	just relax, i've had symptoms of pregnancy before when i really wanted it but i came on really late! With 2 neg tests thats probably what's happening to you. But on the other hand if it is a miscarriage there is nothing you can do about it. Just relaxing is your best bet. I've had 2 miscarriages but you've just got to think that there must have been something wrong with the baby, and it's natures way. (Thats what they tell me anyway). miscarriages are much worse than a heavy period, more like thick clumps.|`|7031265d0531963ae96124dd73a8cd85aa	Okay well we can't say you've miscarried when YOU don't even know if you were ever pregnant.|`|WSXDQ4bpaa	Go to your doctor. Best way to find out what is going on.
1G3XPiq3aa	What about picking up his school work for him, and then taking him away for a short trip, or doing something he enjoys with him. Maybe taking him out and getting his favorite dinner. When he's feeling more relaxed, sit down and do his school work with him. He will study better if he's not stressing.|`|FvhCUHjxaa	You sound like a great mom, everybody needs a mental health day. I'd go get his homework and let him do whatever he wants to do as long as it wasn't illegal. Ugh I wish I wasn't in college and could take a mental health day but I can't =/. If you know how to do his math I'd help him out with it or get him a tutor to help him or even the teacher. Also what does he like to do for fun? Does he like to play video games, go to the movies? Just let him do whatever it is as long as it isn't illegal. Good luck! I'm sorry about his rough week.|`|FGMDbhoJaa	I agree with Amber I think you could take him out to eat <br>  all you can eat|`|1QMhfJ6Laa	D: what a crap week!<br>  encouragement might help quite a bit, and he'll probably need a bit of help with organizing his homework - i'm his age and i get a ridiculous amount of homework. it's absolutely crazy and unnecessary (well, at least mine is). if he's still not ready for the test on the day, maybe keep him home, especially if he's still choked up. they'll tell him to do it when he gets back to school. good luck :]|`|cteyFJxhaa	Poor guy.  Call his teacher and arrange for him to make up his tests next week.  Let him sleep until he wakes up on his own.  <br>  <br>  Once he gets up make him some breakfast and talk to him about how you know he's overwhelmed and you've bailed him out for a couple of days but you can't be doing this over and over "so lets take a day to get back on track and try to stay there".  <br>  <br>  Take him to a chiropractor and get that pinched nerve fixed up.  And just generally have a calm day.  Which is not to say it can't be productive...studying or whatever...but you've given him a few days to catch up and that should take a bit of pressure off.<br>  <br>  He's growing up and he can't shirk his responsibilities completely but this would be a good way too teach him about handling stress.....Responsibilities don't go away but sometimes you have to take a step back and get things into perspective and get your priorities in order.<br>  <br>  Good luck.|`|pUvEmPrCaa	Well, if you're going to keep him home from school (which is always a stress reliever for a kid), make sure that you're calling the school and his teachers and picking up the work he's missing.  Because if he's just going to go back to school with more missed work and more stress and fall more behind, that's not going to get rid of anything.  Let the teachers know what is going on and that he's really too sick to come into school and that you want to know what work he is missing.<br>  <br>  You can make some of his favorite foods or maybe go out to lunch or dinner at a restaurant that he likes.  If you don't want to do that, you can go out for ice cream or a treat like that.  Maybe let him stay up later and watch a movie .  You can give him rewards for doing the homework with you and you can help him do all of his homework and catch up on the work he is missing.<br>  <br>  Make sure you take him to a doctor about that pinched nerve.  You can give him some Tylenol for the growing pains if they become too much to handle.  Make sure he's taking a daily multivitamin to aid in the growing pains and the puberty.
um29wkUPaa	I used to get grounded until further notice.  Not that I could go many places anyway, my mother had a tight leash on me.  I dont know why, I never got in trouble.  I think by keeping me grounded, her life was made easier.  My parents are a lot older than most parents and I think they didn't realize how draining it would be to raise children.  Grounded meant she was off the hook for an indefinite amount of time... don't ask to go to friend's houses or ride my bike.  <br>  <br>  We didn't have cell phones, iPods or computers.  We didn't even have walkmans.  I played with dolls a lot and watched a lot of TV.|`|VwMkiLFPaa	My biggest grounding was when I was 16 yrs old and I snuck out with my best friend to go hang out with some 19 yr old guys. STUPID! They met us at the top of our road, we headed out to their place which was 35 mins away. We hung out at their house, drank alcohol, and stayed out till 2 am. We got dropped back off, but my dog started barking when we snuck back and it woke up my mother. BUSTED!<br>  <br>  I was grounded for two months. My best friend wasn’t allowed to come by for a while. (She was like a sister so that punishment alone was horrible) <br>  <br>  It may seem foolish and stupid and that your grounding won’t do much but keep you bored. But for my situation, look at all the things that COULD have happened:<br>  <br>  I was 16 and meeting a 19 yr old boy. Technically, that’s illegal. He was over 18. <br>  We got in their car, let them drive us 35 mins away from home, had they been drinking? Could we have gotten in an accident and how would my mother know it was me?<br>  We drank at 16 with two older men. STUPID! We knew them, but still. We were underage, and well, anything could have happened…<br>  So we drank, then let them drive us home – DUH!<br>  And the worst part, my mother lost ALL trust in me. For a long time. And that part alone, was a horrible feeling. And to build that back? Well it took a lot of great behavior. <br>  <br>  For you, you have been warned numerous times. So this IS on you! You might be bored, you might have no toys to play with, but maybe next time you’ll think about your parents rules regarding curfew???<br>  <br>  As a child, why our parents make certain rules will never make sense. As an adult, when you become a parent, you then realize that ALL those rules, make perfect sense! You’ll understand when you have kids of your own and you feel that pit in your stomach of being SO worried because your child isn’t home safe and sound.|`|1G3XPiq3aa	Oh wow. That's a bit tough. I was never grounded for more than a week, and then it was only not being allowed to go out to friends, and I grew up being pretty well behaved. Until I was a teenager, and then I moved out at 15 as I wasn't respecting my parents wishes at all.<br>  <br>  I guess your parents were just really, really worried about you. My daughters only 4 but whenever I check on her at night and don't hear her breathing straight away, or have the smallest thought something might have happened to her my heart quite literally feels like it's stopped. 4 hours is a long time to worry your parents for. <br>  <br>  Maybe sit down and talk with them and tell them you understand that now, and you're going to make sure it never happens again? They might lessen it a bit if they know you understand where they're coming from.|`|pUvEmPrCaa	I guess it depends on your parents.  Some parents have harsher rules on curfew, some have harsher rules on schoolwork, etc.  If curfew is what you parents warn you about, that should be the issue that you're on top of.  You should call them and keep on top of it if you know that it's such a big thing to them.|`|03n14OLLaa	Kicked out of school one time as a freshman. I got grounded for over a year!

That was before I left my parents and found Christ though. : )|`|bnJPvsVWaa	I did not leave the house, except to run errands for my parents, for an entire summer vacation, for failing to maintain a C average in junior high school the last semester.|`|381K9LJEaa	what i did:<br>  they found a bottle of jose quervo in my book bag and i failed english.<br>  <br>  punishment:<br>  they took everything out of my room except one pillow and one blanket. and when i mean everything ... light bulb included.  they brought meals to me. i could only come out for school and to go to the bathroom.  they didn't talk to me for the first 2 weeks.  and it stayed like that for 5 months....they brought one thing back to my room for every point i got back in english.  <br>  after i was let out from my room i wasn't allowed to go out with friends until the school year was over.   (this was in october...school ends in may)<br>  <br>  my advice....get some paper and some colored pencils and start some artwork/poetry/anything creative.  or start a journal of your groundation..so when you have kids...they'll think twice.|`|WirFwirLaa	How old are you?<br>  <br>  When I was 12 I snuck out of my house and went to a movie with a much older boy (he was 16). I got busted when my mom came into the movie theatre and dragged me out by my hair. I was grounded for a month. But being dragged out of the theatre by my screaming, cussing mother was probably good enough punishment.|`|vuDE5TPbaa	Man, atleast you get the chance to sneak on the comp. And you get a room with a bed. When I got grounded I sat in a chair in the living room. I could only leave that chair to go eat (and sit at another chair) or to study at a desk (chair again). My *** was so sore.

ZNhP3mpUaa	Not at 6 weeks.Your uterus is still deep in your pelvis... you wouldn't be feeling anything at this point... you may just be feeling what your mind wants to feel... give it time you will feel your baby soon enough... medically though no, at 6 weeks your uterus is too far in your pelvis to feel. <br>  <br>  Buy the book What to Expect When You're Expecting. <br>  <br>  It's like a bible for pregnant women.. it's helped me alot with my wife.|`|5yAsj29Vaa	Oh boy... that thing your baby is living in, that's called a uterus dear.  To answer your question, no, at 6 weeks you won't feel your uterus because it's still tucked down low behind your pelvic bone.|`|cY8DgJv5aa	Its called your uterus and yes, it will be a little firmer than when you aren't pregnant.  That being said, typically speaking, an untrained person wouldn't truly be able to feel a difference in the uterus at only 6 weeks.  Also, just pressing down with one finger most likely wouldn't be able to truly feel anything.  Doctors press down rather firmly with their whole hand while also pushing things up from the inside to be able to feel your uterus at only 6 weeks along.  You may just be bloated and that's what you are feeling.|`|mldo1vxYaa	It could be your pelvic bone or a number of things, I doubt very much at this stage you will be feeling anything including your uterus as you are only 6 weeks.

1LdgTQodaa	hi ,i feel really sorry for you.i know what your going through.i have 16mnth twins and when they were 6 wks i had to put hem on the bottle as i didnt have enough milk.we started with sma.as soon as we gave it to them within an hr or so they were both screaming theyre heads off .its like they were in excruciating pain.but we just thought it was because they had gone from from breast to bottle so kept giving it to them for a few more days.during those days they were up constantly screaming night and day.i really thought i was going mad.then someone suggested aptamil.and as soon as we started giving it to them they both calmed down and seemed absolutly fine.it was amazing the difference just from changing the baby milk.but it really did work.a few months later we were away visiting relatives and all we could get was sma one day.i really didnt think anything of it as they were 11 1/2 months at this time but that night they were up screaming untill the next morning.with maybe an hrs sleep once during the night.so i would never go back to sma.aptamil is definatley the best that ive found.to be honest i really wished i had carried on breastfedding and then none of us would have had to go through it.i just didnt have enough milk to feed them both.it did make me feel bad because i breastfed my other three.and it does bond you and your children and you dont get all these problems like you do with formula milk.i would keep her on aptamil for at least 3 days to see if it is working,because when i changed mine it did take a while for the  milk to get out of theyre system.and they also had runny nappies.hopefully everything will settle down when shes been of it for a few days.i hope this has helped and good luck.hope you find something that helps.|`|Ot8lxaMEaa	Could she have a protein allergy?

Lots of wind and screaming.  Could also be a cow milk allergy, doc may recommend soya formula.  Best thing is to try baby massage, gently rub their tummy, make sure they are well winded after each feed and you might try baby wearing, with her in a sling.  It is supposed to help.  Should pass after 6-7 weeks.  It is not too late to try breast feeding her- it is much easier to digest and you can start back without trouble until she's about 6 months.  Just try offering her the nipple for 10 minutes at a time at regular intervals and you should build back a good milk supply.  See the NCT or La Leche league for further details and help.|`|DllPvvPMaa	If were talking about formula here I would use Enfamil Enfacare Lipil ( a blend of DHA & ARA-Nutrients found in breast milk.

My sister switched to Aptamil and she was a different baby.<br>  <br>  So when I had my daughter, I went straigh on to Aptamil when I stopped breast feeding. Its a little more expensive, but a lot better.<br>  <br>  But definately talk to the dr first.|`|8f6fff32b0caffa89ef6b762f487ae26aa	Babys only has the only real organic stuff you can give your baby.  They have formula, juices, stuff like that to help with the sensitive tummys for babys.  They say its a toddler formula only because they are pro-breastfeeding and reccommend that until the baby is one. But I have other friends who have children who gave them this and their babys were just fine.  If anything BETTER because their tummys werent in pain, they werent colicky etc.  I started my son on Babys only soy formula and he just loves it (hes alergic to milk).   Please check it out! Its the best out there for babies now better than all the ones on the shelves.

I say, as you'd most likly assume, that you go with what you want and honestly Finley is a boys name????

Finley is awful on a girl.|`|bzkSIJYnaa	Sorry, I really don't like Finley or Harper on a girl. They are masculine names. Rose is gorgeous, though! What about using it as a first name? <br>  <br>  Finley Harper Rose doesn't flow well because Harper ends in R and Rose begins with R so it is awkward to say. I think just Finley Rose would be find, Harper is just unneeded and adds more masculinity to the name. I still don't like Finley at all though. I think Rose Harper sounds kind of nice though. I don't really mind boy names for girls as long as they are stuck in the midddle. If they are in the middle, it kind of has a nice "tailored" feel<br>  <br>  Or maybe you like Rose in an elaborated form: Rosalind, Rosalie, Rosaline?<br>  <br>  good luck :)<br>  <br>  [edit] i really like the name Riley for a boy! I'm glad someone is finally using it on the gender it belongs to!|`|OHfZFR31aa	I really don't like the name Finley for a girl.

vue9NOhYaa	You need to give some thought to what YOUR needs and philosopies are.  A ped that might be 'good' for a mom who wants to practice attachment parenting and breastfeed will not be 'good' for  a mom who wants to formula feed from birth and get baby sleeping-the-night as soon as possible.<br>  <br>  Once you know what you're looking for, check with friends who share your philosophies for recommendations. Then, when you have a short list (taking your insurance plan into account as well) of 3-4 names, call them and set up an interview.<br>  <br>  Along with philosophies matters and insurance, you'll also want to consider things like office hours (do they have evening/weekend hours), is it a group practice (where you may not see your chosen doc each time), office set up (do they have a separate watiing room for sick kids?  Calling hours where nurses can answer routine questions?) <br>  <br>  Finally ... when you meet with the doc, do you feel comfortable with her?  Does she seem rigid in her beliefs or relaxed?  Does she seem to like kids, and her job? <br>  <br>  Then .. you decide.|`|efbb15bd3b273c3e6801e5fe2b1add09aa	When I moved to a new town five years ago, I started with a pediatrician that had been recommended to me through the grapevine.

WIEPISyeaa	You could potentially be pregnant. :)  A higher BBT is a pretty good sign....and that "scanty" period could be implantation (especially since it came early.)  <br>  <br>  Have you taken an HPT?  You should!!!!  Let us know how it works out!
xGehiZDOaa	well depending on when your last period was and when you ovulate you come very well become pregnant. The CM could have been "his" stuff coming out or due to you getting pregnant.
Xs0fhFJnaa	I would take a test. Frankly I'm really impressed by your willpower in not testing at all even though you're already late!<br>  <br>  I hope you get the answer you want! Good luck :)|`|Sz7cnFRsaa	It sounds like you could be pregnant, I know how you feel mine are the same but I am not due on till next week. I suggest that you do a test and see what that comes back as, even if you get a period you could still be pregnant. Good luck.
t4HXotwEaa	My daughter was born three weeks late!  I tried everything...nothing worked.  I went to the chiropractor, got a pedicure, had sex (that was miserable), castrol oil, spicy food, walking, begging, you name it.  She is six and I'm still a little irritated with her.  However, as far as names go I like:<br>  Willow Elise<br>  and<br>  Zach Huntley<br>  <br>  Good Luck!!!|`|VHHis05Naa	I feel for ya.  I went six days overdue and that stunk.  Hang in there, honey.  I ended up being induced medically, so I'm no hope there.  But my friend walked and walked and walked and walked and ended up delivering that night!  So that's what I recommend.<br>  <br>  Ava Marilyn is very pretty.  Willow Elise is pretty cute, too.  I'd pick Ryan or Zach from the boys.  Good luck, and I hope it happens for you soon!|`|S0XPrJ2laa	from birthing naturally website. google it.:<br>  Nipple Stimulation for Labor<br>  What is Nipple Stimulation?<br>  <br>  Gentle rubbing or rolling of the nipple, or suckling of the nipples to encourage contractions is called nipple stimulation.<br>  Why does Nipple Stimulation work?<br>  <br>  Oxytocin, a hormone that causes contractions, is released in the body when the breasts are stimulated. After the baby is born, this release is important for the involution (returning to pre-pregnancy size) of the uterus. In labor, the release can be used to stimulate longer or stronger contractions.<br>  How do I do it?<br>  <br>  To stimulate the release of oxytocin, you must mimic the suckling of a baby. When a baby suckles, he does not grab just the nipple, but actually massages the areola (dark circle around the nipple).<br>  <br>  The areola can be orally massaged by the mother's partner, the mother's toddler who is still nursing or by a friend's newborn (babies under 6 weeks will tend to suckle any woman).<br>  <br>  The mother may prefer to massage her own areola. To do this she can rub the areola in a gentle rolling way with her palm or fingers. This can be done through thin clothing.<br>  <br>  NOTE: Nipple stimulation can have very strong effects, similar to the overuse of Pitocin (synthetic oxytocin). For this reason various experts have given recommendations on its use. Here are some recommendations I have seen at various sources:<br>  <br>      *<br>  <br>        Only massage one breast at a time<br>      *<br>  <br>        Only massage a nipple for 5 minutes, wait up to 15 minutes to see what happens before continuing with the massage.<br>      *<br>  <br>        Do not stimulate the breast during a contraction.<br>      *<br>  <br>        Do not use nipple stimulation after the contractions are 3 minutes apart or 1 minute long.<br>  <br>  Some sample nipple stimulation techniques:<br>  <br>  When trying to induce labor or speed up a prolonged early labor, have the mother go about her regular activities. Set a timer to go off every hour. When the timer indicates, have the mother stimulate one breast for 5 minutes, then continue with her normal activities.<br>  <br>  If the mother is anxious for labor to begin, combine the effects of natural nipple stimulation with the natural prostaglandin released in semen by encouraging the mother and her partner to engage in intercourse.<br>  <br>  In the hospital, have the mother place her palm over the nipple and areola and give a firm but gentle pressure. Encourage the mother to move the palm in a circular motion, keeping the firm and gentle pressure.|`|3f0439ebe7cdf100832cada550ab973caa	Sex, walking, hoping and praying!<br>  Trust me you dont want to be induced!!!<br>  Have your man stimulate your nipple in 10 minute intercules, orgasims are know to help, massage two finger above the inside of your ankles at 60 second intervals, walk a hardy hard walk!!<br>  <br>  Good luck babe, I wish you all the best|`|rV8aWISGaa	aahaah my due date was february 12th and they are inducing me on sunday. ive heard that caserol oil works. but it makes you have to go to the bathroom and might make you throw upp.. also i like the name ava marilyn and ryan caiden|`|u18GBKmiaa	eat a curry a hot one|`|m8Czd9Daaa	aww! i seriously hope you feel better! dont worry, the pain will only be temporary. knowing that your bringing another life into the world should be reward enough though :) i like the name ava for a girl. but im not sure about the marilyn part. and for a boy i like ryan (thats my brothers name), again im not so sure about the presley part.|`|7031265d0531963ae96124dd73a8cd85aa	If I have a girl I plan on naming her Kaelyn (Even spelled like that!) but some girl on here told me one time that Kaelyn sounds "made up". <br>  <br>  Also, My midddle name is Alysse (Elise), so I love that for a middle name.. maybe Kaelyn Elise? <br>  <br>  And for boy, I LOVE LOVE LOVE Caiden!|`|R2TnvAbfaa	Try doing squats.

WPI0Z47saa	That is exactly what happened to me this time around. We were trying to have a baby so at first I took one of the tests that show 5 days before your missed period. I took this the day before my missed period and it was negative. I retested the day after my missed period, negative. Then I thought that I was getting my period. I was a little crampy and only showed a little pink when I wiped. I retested 5 days after this and negative. Then when my breasts started burning (this is what happened with my first pregnancy) I got my hopes up again. I made an appointment with my doctor for a blood test and it was positive. It did not show up on a urine test until I was 8 weeks (yeah I kept retesting and wasting money because I was so excited and had to see for myself). If you have a low hormone level then urine tests aren't always sensitive enough to pick it up. So maybe you are and you can either get a blood test or wait and see. I am just impatient. Good luck.|`|OPTDFRuzaa	yes i had a miscarraige a few years back and was told i would not get a period for 2 months which i did not and i started the pill so i put it down to those 2 factors but hubby thought different so i did a test and was neg and then the next 2 were pos shocker!|`|ZzxxcFfsaa	oh yeah that happens. the test will only be positive after a few weeks of pregnancy. so just wait a while.|`|JE8lRn7Caa	I always had to have a blood test to find out if I was pregnant. Make a doctors appt. they can do one.|`|HOdblqIkaa	Yeah its possible to get a lot of negatives before you get a positive. I didn't find out until I was into my 8th week. The best thing to do if you think you are but aren't getting anywhere with home pregnancy tests is go to the Dr and have a blood test its more accurate at detecting a pregnancy early on because sometimes your body doesn't produce high enough levels of hormones to be read on a pee stick.
cAtWxJG1aa	that's quite common with new parents, and i asked a question earlier this morning about the parents for whom it never wears off.  but what hits most of us eventually is that -- although of course the feeling that your own child is exceptional in all meaningful ways might persist, lol -- the *meaningful* ways in which they are exceptional are not things like the age at which they get teeth or can talk or walk or read or remember which goal they're trying to send the soccer ball towards.  so odds are you'll get over the competition thing.  you get a bit of a pass if you're on your first child and he's only 12 months.  if you're not over it by the time he's in second grade, though, get help because that kind of thing is irritating.  ;-)|`|w9TzZCt8aa	i was 1 when i grew my first teeth. you child is probably a bit slow but will catch up eventually. i was a fairly slow child but i caught up when i was 2|`|TiJMle9Xaa	No its normal everyone wants a child that is better then the other. Whether they are or not is another question. I have a 4yr old daughter and i want her to be more advanced then other children her age. And of course i would love her no matter what. i think its just a parent thing. Everyone wants there child to be the best.
kSjHLJI8aa	no u're just one of the lucky ones. lol. u might start getting sick soon tho. so count ur blessings. i started getting nauseous around 7-8 weeks.|`|8MnjjpJ7aa	No, not at all...Some Women don't get morning sickness. I had morning sickness with my girls, but not with my son. I am not saying you are having Boys. My daughter is pregnant, she does not have morning sickness. If you are worried see your Doctor. I think you and the babies are fine. Good Luck. How exciting to have twins!!!|`|ulsdvBJcaa	NO....Every pregnanacy is diffrent. Some women do not get morning sickness. Relax.<br>  Congratulations on twins! I too am pregnant with twins( not in Wk23).|`|JE8lRn7Caa	I have 4 kids and only had sickness with one. it doesnt mean anything dont get upset over nothing. Im sure everything is fine.|`|JClRxC8iaa	No, some lucky people don't get morning sickness. So I guess you are one of them :-)|`|4e67Pdfvaa	no, it just means that your hormone levels are not effecting you like it does others.|`|mc6YtaRbaa	Nope! It means you're lucky! lol A lot of women never have morning sickness or any symptoms, it's nothing to worry about.|`|hSJnaysiaa	Every pregnancy is different- you may not ever have morning sickness or it might just show up later. The books all say (and it was true for me) that morning sickness usually starts around 8 weeks of pregnancy and ends by the end of the 14th week (but I'm 34 weeks and still have bouts of morning sickness). My friend had a baby in November and never once had morning sickness...lucky her. Don't worry too much, your pregnancy is still earlier than the average time that morning sickness begins. Enjoy waking up and being able to eat (without throwing it right back up) while you can!|`|AiwapbAyaa	NO! believe it or not some women dont even have morning sickness...some dont even have symptoms at all hardly....i know some women; my mother, who only had her breast sore and just light cramping at the beginning and that's all...well of course and all the movement the baby makes and stuff! so dont be afraid...and if you are still worried go to your doctor and get that checked out! You'll be fine!  :-D|`|IogJBs2Naa	No, I am currently 18 weeks pregnant with twins.  I didn't have very much sickness at all...just slight nausea with certain smells.  I had no indication I was having twins until I starting gaining weight rapidly and showing early.  Good luck to you!|`|8mchLCQhaa	No I never had morning sickness and my son is 7 now!<br>  <br>  I am pregnant again and have no morning sickness and my baby is fine!
tfdQxfrpaa	I think that's a great name. Very nice.|`|aWdYveqgaa	I'm not a personal fan of the name Lance, but Lance Alexander does have a good sound to it, especially if you love the name.

Alexander Lance sounds great though!|`|dd8cb229ee241de8ca385f84ec4b33d7aa	Lance is not my favorite name<br>  No my son<br>  <br>  If both parents love Lance Alexander then it's prefect<br>  They are the only two people that matters|`|RuyLwzA0aa	I like the name.  I think it is important to not name children "trendy" names.  This is a good strong name.  Alexander is one of my favorite boy names...have you considered using it for a first name?  Lots of room for nicknames with it...Alex, Xander, etc.|`|eytlIKITaa	If you love the name then no ones opinion should matter!  I do think it's cute though!

So always keep a open mind.|`|61NKzPzMaa	Both Lance & Alexander are great names however I prefer Alexander Lance.|`|Lo5yiBqzaa	I don't like Lance.

1xCBR1aBaa	I would sure hope he would stick around since you have been together for close to 4 years. If he doesn't then he wasn't worth your time, and I am sorry for that. Just talk with him and take him to your appointments and he'll come around. Good Luck and try not to be stressed! The first three months of pregnancy are crucial|`|5QJVo2Lhaa	Well, what I think that would happen is that he's probably not ready for a child yet and may be scared. I think he would stay because he's in love with you,he wants kids,and he'll know that you and him are in love and that he wants to be with you for the rest of his life. So he might be a little scared but you and him will make it through the relationship.<br>  <br>   Good luck!|`|GpR5MI5raa	if hes already talking about marrying you, it sounds like he loves you and wants to be with you. Dont worry so much, its bad for the baby.|`|KWaTVVpGaa	The two of you should talk about getting married now. There is no reason really to wait if you are already pregnant. If he still wants to wait, he may not feel that he is ready for a child.<br>  <br>  Good luck

I look back now, and I am so glad I didn't.  What I have now that I didn't have then to bring a baby home to...A loving husband and father, a house that is ours and not likely to go into foreclosure, a savings account, two new cars with excellent insurance, medical benefits that will help me to keep my son healthy, and a sense that we will be able to provide better for our son  (and whatever siblings he will have down the road) than our parents were able to for us.<br>  <br>  Yes, having a baby is very exciting, but it is also very scary.  What if your baby isn't healthy?  Are you emotionally prepared to take care a sick and needy kid?  Are the two of you secure enough in your relationship to withstand a child?  (how about a sick child?  many a marriage and relationship ends in the NICU)  <br>  <br>  A baby is a full time job that you can't change your mind on once you've had it.  It's another person, completely dependent on the two of you for love, support, growth, nourishment, clothes, warmth, etc.  If you feel like you need to be talked out of it, you're not ready. As a nurse in labor and delivery I see many a very young mom come in having their first or even fifth and they are still totally dependent on their families and the state to raise the kids (if they actually have them).|`|8QVlF2kLaa	KK...I'm 32 weeks pregnant.  My ankles have become cankles and none of my shoes fit.  I'm regulated to 1 pair of ugly loafers because they are the only thing that I can squeeze my cankles into!  I can barely sleep because your only options this late in pregnant are right side of left side..but the baby puts so much pressure on your bladder that frequent trips to the bathroom negate sleep anyway.  Pregnancy amnesia has set in and I can barely remember my address these days!  While maternity clothes have come a LONG way since our mother's were pregnant with us..trust me!  They have a long way to go.  I've spent over 2K on maternity clothes and now that I'm getting HUGE even they feel tight and uncomfortable.  My breasts used to be a healthy B...which was great because tops fit nicely and I had some curves.  Yesterday I went to the mall and had to buy size E bras.  Yes, size E.  I didn't even know that they came that big!  So unfortunately your options at that size are to buy bras from Motherhood or one of those ladies plus size shops.  Goodbye Victoria's Secret....<br>  <br>  So..those are just a few of the things that come to mind.  Of course there is the lovely side of growing a new life and of getting to be a Mom..but ahh..there are certainly downsides too...
RD1uEbGWaa	The insurance concern is actually an "urban legend" if the company uses a child care management company rather than running it themselves.  My company sets up and manages employer-sponsored child care programs.  Our client just notifes their insurer that they are hiring us to run a child care program for them and we add the client as an "additional insured" on our insurance program.  No big deal.|`|0VJE7BXmaa	Because most of the people at the top who would be able to put it all together are usually older and they are out of touch of the needs of the younger employees who still have children not yet in school.

While it is true that there are certain times of the month that you are more likely to get pregnant (Days 10-18 with 14 being the average, after your first day of your period) there is no time of the month that you can't get pregnant. It is unlikely but still possible.|`|90zcKChJaa	yes. You can get pregnant anytime you have unprotected sex.|`|GPW6HUZFaa	Yep|`|AA10745032	n0|`|GsMWuduhaa	Yes you can get pregnant. The hormone dosage is so much lower in the pills these days, that you must take your pill at the same time everyday to be protected. As far as your menstrual cycle, I got pregnant w/in 24 hours of ending my cycle and have always been regular like clockwork. Plan B is the emergency contraceptive. It is available over the counter at any pharmacy w/out a prescription. It is nothing more than a super dose of hormones similiar to what is already in your birth control pills. I believe they say it must be taken w/in 72 hours, but of course the sooner the better. The cost is $35-45.|`|JFbWyKKDaa	Yes, you have to consistently take the pill at the same time everyday for it to be 99.99 percent effective.  Look up plan b emergency contraception at the website below if you want.... good luck.|`|ef0ef2a4a22cb84c606773ebccd24369aa	It is possible! If you don't want to get pregnant then you need to make sure you aren't missing pills and if you do then use protection while having sex.|`|tREDFurlaa	your pregnant CONGRATS to you and the father!!!!!
HXfHkoSHaa	I asked my dentist about this.  He said most children will not wear their teeth away, but some do.  There's really nothing you can do to stop the grinding, but you can have a splint made for their mouths if it gets horrible. It's not often recommended because their little mouths are growing, and of course, the splint cannot grow along with the child.  And I'm not sure about a choking hazard of it. I'd make an appointment with a pediatric dentist as this seems to possibly be an extreme case.|`|OBU1eDUHaa	My 2 year old has started doing that too!  I am going to call his pediatrician and see what they say.  Good luck.|`|DllPvvPMaa	The best thing to do is to take him in to a dentist because he is going to ruin his teeth..|`|BFDdN511aa	they grind becoz they are anxious or they are growing new teeth..and they are quite painful to them actually<br>  use some teething toys that could be put in the fridge..babies just enjoy them.|`|wiAVa1H5aa	Normally I'd say ignore it, but since he's grinding his teeth down he needs to see a pediatric dentist for perhaps a solution.<br>  <br>  My did it off and on for about half a year before they stopped, but it wasn't constant and their teeth lost no enamel.
xXnFx6qLaa	I see my lovely troll has told you to ask me (2nd answerer, lol).  <br>  <br>  Well, I will answer! :)<br>  <br>  Tell the guy in question to refuse to have the DNA test done at the park, that he will only have it done at a doctor's office or where ever the child support enforcement agency wants to do it.  <br>  <br>  But I do agree with the first answerer, it will be very hard for someone to switch tests.|`|mCDopsLEaa	The administrator of the test has to sign all kinds of paper work stating they administered the test and stuck the samples directly in the shipping envelope and that they personally delivered it to the Fedex or UPS for delivery to the lab. In child support cases the mom can't "switch" dna.|`|MA9XuLlHaa	Ask Johnny's mommy.
JivuAmfiaa	My younger two children are very, very influenced by their imagination, they both make-believe games and draw pictures about their dreams and so on. My seven year old is particularly imaginative and likes to cling upside-down to the kitchen table pretending he's a bat. Lol.|`|hgPmwYAfaa	i have worked with children for 20 years and i don't think they are influenced by the imagination....i think other things events and dreams tv and family have more of an influence and that sparks their imagination....|`|H93JbQS0aa	I used to have a very creative mind too, but i never did anything with it apart from add to stories pen and paper lol.
XrD8sz4Daa	You need to go see your doctor. It is probably nothing. Maybe stress, eating or whatever can cause that. But I would see your doctor to make sure. Good LUck!|`|ef0ef2a4a22cb84c606773ebccd24369aa	I would call and schedule an appt with your obgyn and see if they'll give you a blood test or see what is causing your period to be so late. Good luck!|`|WEnKu11Saa	go to the doctor immediately
aYCjy8Neaa	The doctor can only guess how far along you are by feeling your uterus doing an internal. That in no way is accurate. It's just a ballpark. Early sonogram is the most accurate way to determine how far along you are. It's usually within 1 or 2 days. I would just say that the doctors guess was wrong and to not worry about it. As long as the pregnancy is healthy then don't worry. Just means you ovulated later then you thought.<br>  <br>  Also, when they said you were 2 weeks they probably meant that the baby was 2 weeks along. This would make you 4 weeks though.|`|98WKYtfwaa	Something sounds fishy, my midwife told me you can't feel the uterus at 7weeks because it's still behind the pubic bone, you can only feel it when it comes out of there.<br>  <br>  You would not be able to see the baby on the ultrasound at 2weeks pregnant, even a transvaginal one.|`|ebCzRLw7aa	You cant feel anything when you are 7 weeks..<br>  everything is still below the pubic bone.<br>  they wont even try to listen for a heart beat or anything until you are 11 weeks.|`|GxYtTjUbaa	Maybe ur having more than one baby?|`|DksDTsuQaa	first off the u/s tech will not be able to see a baby at 2weeks in your uterus you will have to be 5weeks or more to see anything at all.i just went through that myself ,i had an u/s done last week and they hadn't see anything but on 2/19 i got another u/s done and they saw the sac and im five weeks so i suggest that you have another u/s done .i was told this happens due to late ovulation|`|2zY0j133aa	everybody is different. mine was 5 weeks smaller! the doctors were concerted at the begining<br>  as long as your are healthy and the baby is health then don't worry. everybody is different|`|wiAVa1H5aa	If you're two weeks it means you just ovulated and are not pregnant (the count starts at the first day of your last period, 2 weeks (14 days) is ovulation in a 28 day cycle).

pm2EeEgiaa	Yes, they are striae, or stretch marks - the color is not as important as what it looks like.<br>  <br>  If you are done with puberty, the stretch marks won't grow larger - as long as you don't get fat or exercise beyond what you can take - and there probably won't be anymore appearing. These will fade into whitish strips and sooner or later, they will be indistinguishable from your skin as you grow older. No medications or vitamins are necessary - as long as you eat right and have the proper nutrients, they will eventually blend in with your skin color.|`|XLsnuAqmaa	they shouldn't stretch anymore because you are probably done growing.  and they are from both of the reasons you stated.  there is no way to get rid of stretch marks.  most people have them so don't be self concios about them|`|dXDLeHNZaa	Hi there, I suffer from stretch marks too :( I'm healthy, and excercize but I still get them. Usually, if it isn't from growth spurt or weight gain, it is because you are obviously going through puberty, and that heaaaap of estrogen pumping through your veins right now, and causing you to get stretch marks. I have them on the inside of my knees, back of thighs, inside of thighs, my hips and my breasts. There is absoloughtly nothing I do for it, except wait it out. <br>  The only thing you can do is slowly massage the areas, as this boost blood flow meaning a quicker healing progress. Use a cream, and rub it in once a day aswell. I recommend bio-oil, stuff prescribed from the doctor &/or pure vitamin-E oil. I've tried it all, and these worked the best!<br>  <br>  Good luck, I know how horrible it is, but eventually they will be probably only be noticable to yourself.<br>  Love!
0vpDDM8aaa	get a couple dollar store pregnancy tests and go ahead and test.  If it is negative, then wait a couple days and test again.  That way you arent spending tons of money!|`|yV337gGyaa	people say is better to take the pregnancy test on your first pee<br>  but if your pregnant even if u drink a lo of water it would still say positive or negative...i went to the doctor to take a pregnancy test and b4 that i drink a lot of water and ate and still got a positive|`|ebCzRLw7aa	I only read the beginning of your question.<br>  i took a test the day i was suppose to get my period, and i didnt do the test in the morning i did after 12pm and its still came back positive.|`|7031265d0531963ae96124dd73a8cd85aa	Honestly, I took my test on the day of my missed period in the MIDDLE of the day....

S5n5Za78aa	well theres all types of reason a woman can miss a period for the month yes pregnancy is the most common but not always the answer you've seemed to had ruled that out and if your still curious i would see a doc for a blood test.<br>  <br>  Being Overweight<br>  Change in Schedules<br>  Change in Medications<br>  Illness<br>  Being Underweight<br>  Miscalculation<br>  Peri-Menopause<br>  Menopause<br>  Pregnancy<br>  stress|`|cbfb39e3aab3b803822e39f849209291aa	Periods can be all over the place especially when we stress ourselves out over things.  Im afraid you may just have a late AF due to stressing out etc although if it doesnt show in a week i would advise you to go to the doctors for a blood test.  Some people dont show up as pregnant using the tests, they have to go for blood tests instead.  <br>  <br>  Good luck|`|6USJui72aa	i would pay a visit to the doctors and i know its easier said then done but try and relax.
iYRBbpGWaa	I've done childcare since the day before I turned 13. I didn't do it by myself but I was always with an adult. I am almost 18 now and all the parents completely trust me with their kids, some have even stayed overnight with me when their parents had to leave town for business trips. But when I was younger they were more leary of me and often accused me of things I didn't do. I would say that if you do decide to do that at your age make sure it is with people that know you well and won't cause unnecesary problems.<br>  <br>  We were always low cost because we know how expensive childcare can be. We charged $1.50 to $1.75 an hour and $2.00 an hour for infants under 18 months. We also offered family plans that would lessen the amount for more than one kid. It just depends on how much the parents make. You can't charge more than they can afford.<br>  <br>  You can make arts and crafts with them. You should have outside play toys so on nice days they can get some fresh air. Kids love being outside. They also like to play hide-and-go -seek. With smaller kids they like peek-a-boo with blankets and such. Activities are more dependent on the ages of the kids and what they like.<br>  <br>  They really like it if you have a small pet like a small nice dog or cat, or even hamster/gerbil types of animals. They like being able to pet the animals and feed them. Fish are nice for looking at as well. It's good to establish a general schedule because if you do it will help them be more willing to lay down at nap time and eat at lunch time. Snack time is a must for some kids as well.<br>  <br>  If you need anything else just e-mail me at julie_annette91@yahoo.com. Hope this helps. Good luck!|`|7e9bce7df6b13d448cd20f1bff3d3cf3aa	Personally, I believe babysitting is a very big responsibility. 13 is a young age. It is mainly experience and past situations which have helped me to understand, react and think in a logical way. I couldn't do this much at 13. <br>  <br>  It would depend on the ag of the child and whether or not an adult would be nearby.<br>  <br>  It is the parents of the child you should be asking. Good luck and I hope all works well for you.<br>   <br>  I do think that it was a mature move to consider what others thought first though.|`|JFr7fCiXaa	i think at 13 you should only babysit for short periods of time and ask the parents how much they would be willing to pay.<br>  as you mum is a childminder ask her for more tips and advice and make sure you are only left with children if you know them and are comfortable with it.<br>  make sure you always have someone avalible incase something goes wrong when your alone with the kids|`|d89qNyb6aa	If you are a responsible 13 year old ( you sound like you are) then I think its a good idea.<br>  You can watch dvd's with them,listen to them read (depending on age)<br>  Read to them.<br>  I would pay you ￡10- ￡15 a night depending on how long I was gone for.<br>  Have a list of phone numbers in a safe palce so you can call in case of emergency.|`|VGueFw4gaa	I would have a 13 year old babysit my children only if: 1) I won't be far away and easily reachable, 2) the babysitter is very mature for her age, 3) experienced with other people's kids, 4) never overnight.  Of course all other consideration for any age babysitter, like health, personality, etc.  I would pay the same for any age; pay depends on how much babysitter has to do, like children sleeping or have to make dinner.  Babysitters can always just "play" for activity.  If the parents seem ok with you keeping their kids, it's their choice, but for the kids sake, please keep your head no matter what happens.|`|yrTZ6Qtkaa	well you sound very responsible and into this.<br>  <br>  if a 13 year old babysat my kids i would feel a little funny if  i didn't know you but they do know you so i would feel fine leaving especially if the kids know you and like you.<br>  <br>  i would be willing to pay 20 dollars an hour on these circumstances and if you did well. if i came home and my house had coloring on the wall the price would probably go down.<br>  <br>  the activities really depend on age. before you go over there you should have things ready to do. have the night planned out. little kids like to color but they get bored quickly so have lots of things ready. play hide and seek with rules like no going outside and in rooms there not aloud too. if they have a long hallway play red light green light. simon says is a good game too.  if there older and not into that stuff bring cds , music video games and dvds.<br>  <br>  try to cut down on food as much as possible unless there hungry, because you dont want them to choke. dont give soda to them at night because they will be bouncing off the walls. and wont go to sleep.<br>  <br>  GOODLUCKKK!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!...|`|ivhnVbbraa	I have 4 kids. If I knew the 13 yr old well and she was responsible, then I would maybe let her sit at my house for me to run to the store. I don't think I would want her at my house over night to sit or anything. Not yet at least. No offense. I would think $5 an hour is good. That's what I charged when I sat for kids. Some kids now days charge $10. Or some tell them whatever they think. So thats really on you, what you want to charge. It depends on the ages of the kids to know what to do with them. Movies, board games, cops and robbers(lol), barbies, and reading. Anything like that is appropriate.|`|epBOAXUraa	Legally you should not be left in charge of non related children until you are older but..  I would feel happy about leaving my children with a 13 year old when they were about 5 years+ and only for a couple of hours.  I would be expecting activities like watching a film, reading books, arts and crafts etc but no cooking, gluing etc.<br>  <br>  As for tips; don't give into their requests for fizzy juice/chocolate/ whatever parents don't let them have.  Be 'reasonably' strict about bed time and never ever invite friends round whilst babysitting, even if the parents seem cool about it.|`|EQdDkSw0aa	Well i wouldn't wan't a 13 yr old looking after the kids...but only if they are mature.<br>  Well i would be willing to pay around ￡4.00 because it's not that hard of a job.<br>  - you can play games such  rock paper scissors,<br>  geussing games, hide and seek... i mean you don't neccesary need to have games to play.<br>  -get them to cook a meal for their mom or dad :-)<br>  Tips...<br>  Be aware at all tymes of what the kids are doing.<br>  Health and safety in the house..such as makeing sure they stay away from sharp stuff.<br>  <br>  GUD LUCK :-)<br>  HTH...hope that helped
ThnKiLfTaa	I am so sorry this happened to your son. I feel so bad for him. It is never easy when are children are hurt or sick. When my child hurts it makes me hurt :( as his mother I know you just wish you could take all his pain away. The best thing you can do is first call the DR. and tell him that your son is still in ALOT of pain and see what the DR. recommends. Other than that just show him your love. Try to hold him and comfort him the best you can just as we as mothers always do when our child is sick or hurt. Maybe you can try to set him up a comfortable place on the couch or his bed and have handy for him anything he might would need like a drink or snack maybe a couple toys or coloring book/crayons or a book to look at and just empathize with him. Tell him you love him and give him lots of hugs and kisses. I hope I have helped. Good luck and God Bless!|`|UU6UiBKGaa	Ive had that problem before. if the pain reilivers dont work, call your doctor and tell him abou it. try to keep his mind off of it, like play games with him or, put him to do something so hes not always thinking about it.|`|f34d8af07990dc3e462c898fc5a7609faa	please call the doctor, tell them that the drugs are not working. your son is still crying out in pain. the only thing you can do is make him comfortable and give him what he wants!|`|MnmNl6Hiaa	call your doctor and tell them and second you have to understand that he is probably very scared it really weird to have a cast on and uncomfortable so just stay close to him until he gets use to it and explain why this is something very new and trust upon him quickly so just be there for him after a week or so he will act like it's not even their.
TWiOp0xLaa	I think it changed you know...<br>  <br>  A few weeks ago i could get on to the profile editor, the option to upgrade to profile 2.0 was there but you didn't have to use it.<br>  <br>  Then the other day i went back to it, and was like, what the hell, wheres the profile editor?!<br>  <br>  Soo, im guessing they took it away, which is kinda rubbish.<br>  <br>  :)
7aaceef242426e2a1e7394d78368ca77aa	You need to get to a doctor to find out exactly when the pregnancy occurred. If you did fall pregnant right away, it would be too late to get any type of abortion, except an illegal one. If it turns out you are too far along there are many options out there to help you parent your child. If the father runs off, there is child support. If he sticks around though, great! There is housing assistance: Section 8 vouchers, public housing, and emergency housing. There is money assistance: If your job is low wage, you can still get cash and food assistance from your county. There are voucher programs for furniture and clothing. There are voucher programs for daycare. Those vouchers can also pay one of your family members to watch the child if you wanted to as long as that family member gets licensed through the state at no cost to them. There is more food assistance: You can sign up for food programs like angel food ministries online or go to the food bank and you can get WC right now. Medical assistance: Medicaid will cover your pregnancy expenses as well as all of your child\s medical expenses. If you are really low income they will cover your expenses as well as the fathers if you live together or get married. There is even more help out there through churches and charities. You can do it if it ends up that it is too late. School assistance: More programs and financial assistance open up to parents. I went to school with a child and had money left over to help with diapers and so on without loans!  Many colleges and high schools have day cares on site now to help people finish school too. <br>  <br>  Please disregard the adoption postings please unless you truly do not want your baby. Adoption is for unwanted or orphaned children, not young or poor mothers. There is no guarantee of a better life through adoption, those couple can get divorced and lose jobs and become poor just like the rest of society. Adoption is oftentimes a permanent solution to a temporary problem and is harder to "get over" than an abortion. (Most women never ever get over it even after meeting the child as an adult) Adoption is also not an alternative to abortion. If it is legally possible to get an abortion and you 100% want an abortion, then get one. <br>  <br>  Make sure to get contraceptives right away. The first month of any contraceptive is less effective than they are posted on the box. (except an IUD, they work immediately) So make sure to be extra careful during that first month of using a contraceptive, by using a a condom and spermicide as well as the pill or injection. <br>  <br>  I wish you the best in this situation. Good luck to you and your partner.|`|72SrLDQ3aa	Go find an OBGYN, get prenatal care, contact an adoption agency and find a couple that are looking to adopt a baby.|`|LP7ox8cKaa	shld u be at a doc than wasting anytime here|`|Po2UqfvWaa	check the yellow pages and make some calls|`|1G3XPiq3aa	Don't be ashamed. These things happen. Pregnancy is a really scary thing and it's understandable if you tried to avoid the possibility. <br>  <br>  You need to go to the doctors to find out how far along you are. If it's less than 3 months, abortion is still an option. They'll explain the process to you, but first trimester abortions aren't too scary. You'll be under anesthetic and won't even know it's happened. <br>  <br>  If you're later, there are other options, and I'm sure your doctor will be happy to talk to you about those too. But don't stress. That's not going to change anything. Ring your doctor now, and then just take it easy until you have to go.<br>  <br>  Hope it all works out for you.|`|fHjSonssaa	Regardless, you definately need to seek a medical professional before you make any decisions- it's unfortunate that you want to abort- however I am pro-choice and will respect your decision.  <br>  There is a point where it becomes dangerous to abort- or at least more risky.  It sounds like you are definately past the point of having a safe pill (medical) abortion.  Surgical would probably be the way a DR would chose to proceed forward.<br>  <br>  I also wonder what taking the birth control pills may may not have done to the baby.<br>  <br>  You should definately see a DR- sooner rather than later in any case- to check on babies health, to see your options.|`|wENdWT5kaa	I will agree with you on two things, you are selfish and clueless. <br>  <br>  "too young, too poor, too unstable all the way around"<br>  <br>  Hmm...it really is too bad that you didn't think of this before you had sex , and unprotected, i'm sure. <br>  <br>  If you weren't ready for a baby, then why didn't you take extra precautions? Condom AND the pill or other contraception?? <br>  <br>  And honestly, i would like to think people would learn from the FIRST mistake, but obviously, you are proof that they don't. <br>  <br>  If you think this is rude, then so be it, but i'm being honest with you when i say this is actually me not being rude. <br>  <br>  Abortion is NOT birth control. <br>  <br>  If you are past three months, you will have a hell of a time trying to find a dr. that will abort after the first trimester. BTW, if you are 3 months (maybe 2) or more, the baby already has a heart beat (as of 6 weeks) and has all his limbs, fingers, toes, eyes, nose, etc. <br>  <br>  I'm sorry, but if you weren't ready to have a baby, why did you have unprotected sex after your first abortion??|`|c2rTAk71aa	did they confirm that the abortion pill was indeed successful? There have been cases in which it doesn't work and the pregnancy continues along. That may be why you never got your period back. I know you can only take the abortion pill if you are 8 weeks along max so I think if you are able to abort it would have to be surgical.<br>  <br>  Hope that helps. Sorry for your stress. I hope you feel better.|`|CjdCuWb1aa	well, you say that you could not provide a stable invironment for the baby, so why don't you give it up for adoption?|`|cRz31MlMaa	First you need to see a doc to find out far along you are before you can find out if termination is an option.|`|3CG3rby0aa	Adoption not abortion.  Go to your doctor and talk to them about it and see what they suggest.  They may be able to help you find some people to talk to about adoption.  Just remember that you have to live with this the rest of your life whatever choice you make.  And for your own sake please either have protected sex or better yet don't have it at all. Please just do what is best for the baby and you.  Good luck and be safe. :(|`|AA10754660	you need to find out how far along you are inorder to see if you can get an abortion or not. i know its a scary thing and your young but you can consider adoption.

But I just hoped that before you made that "thing" with him, you thought of the consequences that might happen.

23MPcnNqaa	My opinion of abortion is that it's morally wrong.  If you are out there having sex, then you should know the consequences.  And if you are not prepared to have a baby, there is always a couple out there that can't get pregnant and would be willing to adopt.<br>  There are other options instead of abortion.<br>  <br>  However, I do not judge those that feel differently.|`|CpiLHcTlaa	i think im getting annoyed because this SAME question is posted at least three times a day!  so annoying and technically this is political not to do with pregnancy.<br>  <br>  if you were asking "what are the effects" or "i don't know if i should" or something then it MIGHT squeak by as pregnancy but asking our opinions on a major political issue in pregnancy (so obviously 90 %  choose not to) not a good idea|`|OPTDFRuzaa	em.. i think if women want to have one then thats their choice but i dont agree with abortion unless there is an abnormality with the child that will give a poor quality of life or sudden death after birth. i know i could never live with myself if i had one.|`|WPI0Z47saa	It is a very personal decision that no one has the right to attack or harass another individual for.|`|9a3sNrEqaa	please post your question in the "POLITCAL" section.

Well, besides religion and all. <br>  <br>  But, I am 100% prochoice. I believe that it is not "murder", it's just stopping the development of something. People who get abortions, most of the time, are making a good decision if they are not financially stable and willing to dedicate their lives to raising children. They're not cruel, because it's not like they planned to conceive it and then purposely stopped it just for an evil thrill. <br>  <br>  Go ahead, send me hate mail and tell me that I'm going to rot in hell.

I really love the name Alice!|`|7XIWtNr6aa	Not really|`|RPc63EK2aa	i dont think so...|`|lb0cpSSyaa	what about alyson...ur name plus the last of damon?|`|vGxipYJnaa	I think they sound nice together. They're both two syllables and quite traditional names.
nFj30sZcaa	You certainly gave it plenty of time.<br>  There are kits available now to test your breast milk for alcohol levels!!<br>  Walgreens and Target.com (not sure about in store at Target, but I know they're on the website) both offer the test strips. It's similar to the concept of a pregnancy test - you put just a drop or two on the strip and the results will tell you if alcohol is present in the milk!<br>  They're not that expensive (unless you plan on drinking daily, which it doesn't seem like you would!) <br>  That way, you won't have to do the old "pump and dump" and waste breast milk and you won't be worried!<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.target.com/Upspring-Baby-Milkscreen-Home-Test/dp/B0018ZYSH2/qid=1235140490/ref=br_1_8/187-7929984-2286136?ie=UTF8&node=1041914&frombrowse=1&pricerange=&index=tgt-mf-mv&field-browse=1041914&rank=pmrank&rh=&page=7" rel="nofollow">http://www.target.com/Upspring-Baby-Milk...</a>|`|OPTDFRuzaa	Hi its up to you what you do but personally i just would not risk having a drink whilst breastfeeding. it takes 1 hour for 1 unit of alcohol to come out of you.|`|vue9NOhYaa	Your baby is fine. Even if you'd nursed immediately after you drank, baby would have gotten only the tiniest trace of alcohol.  And by 2 a.m. your milk was 100% clear.|`|n3IoftMFaa	Oh, no - he is fine. You fed him 6 hours after 2 drinks - plenty of time.|`|OBU1eDUHaa	If you want to drink more often and not worry about this... I've seen test strips at Babies R Us that you can test your milk's level of alcohol.  It looked like a good idea.|`|GpR5MI5raa	i think its safe. I've always heard the one hour rule.|`|oUcLSDZ6aa	While I was breastfeeding, although I knew there was no 24 hour rule, I still waited 24 hours before breast feeding, and made sure that I pumped and dumped a few times in between.<br>  <br>  However, light beers, on occasion can be good for your supply, (this doesn't mean feed with a beer in your hand :P).  As for the one other drink, Being a daiquiri, which really isn't much of a "hard" drink, I really doubt you did any harm. <br>  <br>  In the future though, try having a few pump and dump sessions in between. I don't know if it actually helps, but I always felt better.|`|b978f631fc787a963337206aa3833370aa	It would take a LOT to affect his liver. In fact, I think you'd be dead of alcohol poisoning before you reached that point! If you are sober enough to drive, you are sober enough to nurse. I'd say you were just fine. <br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.kellymom.com/health/lifestyle/alcohol.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.kellymom.com/health/lifestyle...</a><br>  <br>  ENjoy your drink.

oUcLSDZ6aa	CONGRATULATIONS!<br>  <br>  Any brand of prenatal vitamins will do, they're on the shelf at your local drug store. You can absolutely start taking them now (even if you weren't pregnant, they're good for you). <br>  <br>  The doctor will go by whenever your last period was, and probably put you down as a 28 day cycle (the norm) if you don't know for sure. Chances are you won't know exactly how far along you are until your ultrasound, which should be scheduled around what is presumed to be your 16th week. <br>  <br>  Expect a lot of questions, you will be weighed, measured, and they might try for a heart beat, though I wouldn't expect to get one if you're only 2 weeks a long. They'll check your blood pressure, and probably offer a pap (if you're at the OBGYN). Expect it to be a lot of talking, and possibly a lot like a physical. <br>  <br>  Congrats again!|`|m2CR7zEnaa	any dr is going to recommend you take some prenatal vitamins and any will do. i would also look up some things to avoid during pregnancy and make sure that you stay away from those things till you talk to your dr. (like caffeine) <br>  congratulations and best of luck!|`|H9t63i4Kaa	omg!!!! CONGRATULATIONS!!!

qsjGSXaRaa	My baby's on the larger side. She's 3.5-months old and weighs 15lbs. 8oz. She's also 26.5 inches long. Her birth weight was 8lbs7oz.<br>  <br>  Her Daddy and I aren't little people though. Her daddy stands 6'4" and I'm 5'9". We figured we'd probably have a larger baby.|`|93e5e66462cba8bcd411219422deababaa	my son's lowest weight after birth was 5.13.  at 2 months he was 11 pounds 9 ounces and at 3 months 13.5 and 4 i think 15 pounds<br>  <br>   my son was 4 weeks premature|`|TSsT8QGgaa	my daughter was 10# (3months) and 11.5# (4months)<br>  my son was 11#(3months) and 12.2(4months)<br>  at birth they were about 3 and half weeks premature with my daughter born at 4.15# and my son at 5# even.  <br>  yes my babies were small,,,some of it was the twin thing, some of it was that i am tall and thin as is most of my family.  they were growing and happy and healthy.  my doctors were never worried and neither was i.<br>  my "babies" are now 11 and still NOT on the charts.  they are OVER the chart for height,,,and UNDER the chart for weight.  at 11 my kids are still on WHOLE milk too.  <br>  There is more to being "healthy and normal" that dots on a chart.  like you said she is eating well and dr says she is fine.  no worries.|`|7aaceef242426e2a1e7394d78368ca77aa	My daughter is 12 lbs and in the beginning of her 4th month. She was 7lbs 8.8 oz at birth and the doc said she is growing very well. My boys were small too. Some kids are just smaller, but continue to grow at their own great pace. Some kids are bigger, but very healthy. My boys did not reach 20lbs until 12 months or later, some kids weight that much at 4 months. Both situations are fine. Family size often contributes to this as well. For example, I am 5'2 and my husband is 5'5 so our kids are gonna be small.|`|c73QkZ2haa	Our son weighs 16lbs on the dot and the wee girl is 12lbs14oz. She sounds just fine to me. They are almost 4 months.<br>  <br>  O shes tiny.. Thats cute.. Mine were 6lbs4oz for the girl and 6lbs14oz for the boy and they were 3 weeks early :D... Every baby is so different.|`|VFJGRigZaa	15 lbs, as long as shes eating good and the docs said shes ok then shes fine! She's just little!:)<br>  <br>  i should say my daughter is almost 5 months,<br>  so at 4 months or 3 she was about 12 i would say??..|`|3c389272b0d2a9360ace888cf3f5ecd5aa	My son is 3 months and weights 12lbs 9oz. He was 5 weeks early. At birth he was 6lbs 3oz. Doctor says he is growing fine. I would not be too worried. As long as she is eating and gaining weight on a regular basis, then there is nothing to worry about. Everyone is different. She maybe just be on the smaller side then others. Or she maybe just be a late bloomer, either way she will be fine|`|DllPvvPMaa	My daughter weighed 5 pounds 14 ounces at birth and she is 6 months now but when she was 5 months she only weighed about 14 pounds something so that sounds about right..|`|lb0cpSSyaa	she is fine!  she is just smaller...so is my son.  he is 9 months a weighs 17.6...the doc said he is fine :)
6zuoRhFvaa	give it another week, if your symptoms continue or you have new ones, take a test every week until you get your period. <br>  <br>  when you test next week, use your first urine of the day, the hCG hormone is the strongest in the morning, and use an early detector test, it detects the smallest amount of hCG.<br>  <br>  hope this helps!|`|3c724f5ab73b7356d0f55d16d18e2019aa	When u first suspect that u may be pregnant u should have purchased an Ept (an early home pregnancy test) It detects the pregnancy hormone in the urine. sense u didn't wait 2 wks u should go to the Dr. and get a blood test and if u are pregnant then u will know immediately. They can examine u to tell u how far u are by an ultra sound. Then u will know when ya last period was.The Dr.will tell u everything u need to know. Good luck.|`|cP0NnP6Oaa	wait atleast a month to 5 weeks. thats usually a safe period.|`|mFQydvncaa	i would wait until you miss aperiod and try not to think to hard about it because stress can keep your period from starting on time
HFWLYMD6aa	I really like the pill. You have to remember to take it everyday tho. and ur not protected for 14 days when u first start it either. ask your doctor about the different types and what u want it to do for you.|`|dxMQAdndaa	Don't have sex ;)|`|R5M2jEdgaa	Honestly, not having sex works the best but with that aside...<br>  <br>  Did you know that God loves you and made you in His image? You and your boyfriend are very special and precious to God, so much so that God came and died for you both to have a relationship with Him. The only time anyone should be having sex is after marriage.<br>  <br>  With that said, if your relationship fails or suffers when sex is taken out of the relationship, what is your relationship based on? Sex, right? Sex is not love, and love is not a feeling, love is a choice you make (no matter how you feel). If a man leaves his wife because he says he doesn't love her, what he is really saying is "I am not willing to make the choice to love my wife" and is taking the easy way out.<br>  <br>  Since you are created in the image of God, your body and life are very precious, God says you are very valuable so please, realize that sex before marriage is disrespecting yourself, your boyfriend and God.<br>  <br>  God bless you and I will be praying for you =).|`|Szxce0uUaa	ive heard really good things about the IUD Mirena.
BpUo2WGkaa	It could be, or it could be just (i forgot the correct term) but pretend labour. When your body is just preparing. I had them a few weeks before giving birth to my daughter,   They were at really irregular intervals and not giving me much pain.<br>  <br>  I was having weekly doctor appointments so maybe just wait and ask him or if you are worried book in earlier or maybe just go to the hospital and check.<br>  <br>  If they're irregular it might just be your body preparing and things like that.<br>  <br>  Dont hesitate to go get checked though if you're worried.|`|1CryEnb3aa	How far a art are your contractions?  You need to time them.  If, they care consecutive and are 5 min apart, then you definitely need to go to L & D.  You may be having braxton hicks contractions at this point.  Just keep an eye on them.  Good luck|`|Fy9S6hjIaa	Its quite likely that the contractions your are experiencing are what most people refer to as Braxton Hicks contractions.  They usually begin sometime during the last few months of pregnancy.  They can vary from being just a tight feeling in your stomach to being truly uncomfortable.  They are nothing to worry about.  Its just your body getting ready for real labor.  There are several ways to tell the difference between Braxton Hicks and true labor.  One way is that contractions during labor will be regular.  If the time intervals between contractions vary, then it is likely Braxton Hicks.  Another way to tell is that Braxton Hicks contractions can be relieved by changing positions or doing a different activity.  Try taking a bath or or have a snack and relax a bit.  If they stop, then they are likely Braxton Hicks.  Lastly, true labor contractions will get more intense and closer together as time goes on.  <br>  <br>  Good luck and as always, if you're worried it never hurts anything to put in a call to your doctor.<br>  <br>  Congrats on the baby!  Hope everything goes will for you and your little miracle:-)|`|IdoZbO39aa	It is most likely the 'practice' Braxton Hicks contractions. So long as they are not getting closer together or longer then its all just preparing your body for labour. <br>  If you find that contractions get stronger, longer and are nearing 10min apart then you should probably contact your hospital for advice. You are supposed to get to hospital when real contractions are 5 min apart.<br>  Have a read up on Braxton Hicks contractions....<br>  <a href="http://www.babycenter.com.au/pregnancy/antenatalhealth/physicalhealth/braxtonhicks/" rel="nofollow">http://www.babycenter.com.au/pregnancy/a...</a>
WfwFuQB0aa	i would think it is perfectly safe as it can be used on the whole family, which means children.      it only uses 1 x AA battery.<br>  <br>  if you still have a real concern check with your pharmacy/chemist or medical practitioner.|`|1hciyvKdaa	No poisons or poisonous shampoos, no treatments not given by a dr.|`|vGxipYJnaa	Do you mean the head-lice comb? Yes.|`|GxYtTjUbaa	Yes you can it shouldn't have affect on the baby its a comb|`|AA11103493	I can't see why not, there are no chemicals involved.|`|tVVLtMHGaa	What is that?
Coc593Ikaa	I would order a chromosomal analysis to find out whether they are a boy or a girl. Chromosomes are so much more reliable than genitalia in determining this.<br>  <br>  Then I would raise the child according to that. If they chose later to live as the other gender, then I would support them.<br>  <br>  I also would not have surgery performed on them. That is something that I feel the child should have a say in when they are old enough to do so. The pain of the surgery later in life (in my opinion) is easier than the emotional pain of me making the wrong decision.|`|mFQydvncaa	this is tricky because you just dont know what they were meant to be untill they grow up, if it was a matter of them having to have a surgery to function then i would consult with as many doctors as possible to find out what they think then i guess if they have to have surgery then thats what has to happen|`|VJs1jZJ1aa	I think id wait to have them undergo surgery. But i wouldnt wait until they had started school. I think you could tell what sex they relate to by the time that they were 4 or 5 by observing their behavior. Of course i would also have a professional evaluate them.|`|HFWLYMD6aa	I just think you won't know what the child is until it reaches puberty. I would be getting the doctors to do as many tests as possible to determine what sex the child actually is and raise the child as the sex they confirmed from tests.|`|yrF1q1mdaa	haha, watching private practice eh? lol I have no idea what I would do but I wouldn't be ignorant like the parents on there!|`|u0mZAPuDaa	Someone watched 'Private Practice' tonight!<br>  <br>  :)
tRrzHOCRaa	we all greive differently and untill a man sees your stomach grow and the baby kick etc.they dont feel like it is real..this is normal.for us woman we feel the life inside of us and grow attatched instantly..again normal..as for the plan this could be his way of defending himself from another loss!!! a way of somehow controlling the future because the present was out of his hands!! but you should wait for a while i would say at least one year so your body can heal and so you can come to terms with the death of this baby!!if you rush it and get pregnant before you do you will probably be in so much fear of a repeat that the extra stress on your body coupled with what your body itself just went through could indeed bring on a repeat!!!and just like any death you never get over it  you just learn to accept it and come to peace with it!!<br>  i wish you luck in your future and i wish you peace now!!!....from a fellow mom whos lost a little one.|`|I2gs5opxaa	hi yess but u need to go see a famley planing center there u can talk about it togher ask see why u miscarried  ask what chancers that u will fall preg again and if u could carry full term now days theres a real lot more they can tell and help u both with then youll both know how to plan for a baby again what youll need to do.|`|1xsUVtzBaa	I miscarried at around the same time too. I know how it hurts. I have a friend who is at the same stage i would be now..and it kills me. You get used to the idea of becoming a family and the future and it's hard to let go of it all.<br>  Maybe you should talk to your husband about needing more support from him and needing more comfort. As a man he will never know what it is to carry a child but im sure he's just as upset too, my fiance was so upset. You need to mourn this loss..just like you would if anyone you knew died..a fetus is a living being and a part of you.<br>  You will always remember this..but it's a good idea to look forward to the future...and Honor the one that got away.<br>  So sorry for your loss ..|`|DSSZZBTXaa	aw I'm so sorry for your loss! I know how you feel. I lost my baby a year ago on the 21st. I'm not married yet though and got pregnant on birth control after only dating my bf for 4 months at the time I got pregnant so it wasn't planned also. Like you I've always felt that I was made to be a mother since day 1. When I miscarried I got depressed for a long time unfortunetly and my bf didn't know and still can't tell how  bad it hurts me. Like I was sad when that baby was suppose to be due and I've been a little sad this week and my bf doesn't know what to do. Your gonna be sad no matter what just let your emotions out when you need to and don't hold them in or you'll just get really depressed like I did. Maybe make a compermise with your husband about when you guys can start trying for a kid. That's what me and my bf did and were gonna start trying later in this year hopefully as long as our jobs are looking good.|`|HFWLYMD6aa	The mourning sounds normal. You did lose a child. Talk to a specialist about this. (eg, Doctor. etc) Take ur husband so he hears what they say to. I understand the wanting a child and knowing ur meant to be a mother. I know and always have that i will be a mother oneday. Good Luck.
aiDV9FgGaa	I think teaching them the easiest way to assimilate into society is the most practical. It will make their life so much easier. Individuality can be expressed in ways such as music taste, hobbies, etc. As far as the child's dress and speach, they should try to fit in with peers.<br>  <br>  But some kids are individuals at heart and will always have special tastes. In those cases, let them do what they do.|`|ZZzQLjaKaa	I think it is more important to teach kids to be true to themselves and accepting of others differences, rather then the vague concept of "individuality". Most kids start from the get go very individualistic, for example my nephew thought nothing of wearing his batman costume to a family funeral, or my daughter does not care what season it is, she prefers to wear a tutu and tights. So from an early age, most children are more comfortable with themselves then most adults. However, developmentally as kids are exposed to their peers, how others view them becomes very important. At this time, I think it is important to start teaching kids to be themselves, while at the same time teaching them to accept the differences of others.|`|03n14OLLaa	Yes because if they don't know to be their own person they may give into peer pressure later in life and start using drugs or having sex or binge drinking. If they're their own person, this is less likely to happen|`|6VbNJOtfaa	I think it is important for them to recognize that everyone is different and that is something to be proud of and respected.  Just as they need to learn to accept the differences of others, they should be able to accept that they have their own special quirks that make them unique.  It breeds self esteem and lets children know that they are special and "normal" no matter what.|`|nfzQkvqraa	It's very important.  Too often in life we run with the pack. And succumb to peer pressure.  If our child looks at themselves as an individual with strong beliefs,  it will cut down on that.  Kids with individuality will have more self worth.|`|pT7jrsAgaa	Absolutely!  I talk to my kids about how important it is to be yourself, to stand up for what you believe in even if it means going against the majority.  To be the one kid NOT picking on another kid.|`|ZZMkENyeaa	Yes, because they need to learn that it's okay to be who they are and that they shouldn't judge themselves based on what everyone else thinks. Also to help them deal with peer pressure in the future this is very important.
IYacMZCGaa	i actually kind of like them unique yet still cute go for it|`|MW1yrHbOaa	i'm sorry, but i don't like any of them, i like riley|`|mZi7R0Enaa	I would prefer Taylor to Baylor and the girl's name is lovely!|`|8OoqHpbIaa	i like bailey but not baylor sorry<br>  <br>  i like berklee but the spelling looks odd|`|RPc63EK2aa	i like berklee, spell as berkley... only this name i like...rest? nope!|`|l72nSzIFaa	You asked for opinions.

a9btWYKRaa	Maclaren is a very reliable pushchair, I have used it with both my daughters.  My eldest daughter started walking everywhere at a very early age, we just used to leave a bit earlier and take it easy.  If you wish for your son to get used to walking with you try making it really fun for him so he doesn't realise the distance he is walking. Try asking him about the things he sees around you, I-Spy (using colours is usually easier at such a young age) etc...<br>  <br>  My daughter now really enjoys going for walks and playing games along way, This is also a very good time to teach them about Road safety.<br>  <br>  Good Luck.|`|AA12121990	I loved my little Maclaren Volo which I used up until my first son was about three, and is being used again for my second son who is 10 months. Its light but really sturdy.|`|Rgi1pBgpaa	Like yourself, we also have a Quinny Zapp...and my son loves it.<br>  <br>  I read a few reviews online and they look fine for older children.  Also one of the sites has a special 50 pounds off.  I think normal retail is 150 pounds, now it's down to less than 100 pounds.

AA10196172	Depends. <br>  <br>  She's probably thinking it's implantation bleeding. However, that should be nowhere near what a period looks like and would happen about a week or 10 days after conception.<br>  <br>  So it's up to you to decide. Does it look like a period? Are they usually this erratic or is this a really odd occurence?<br>  <br>  Unless you are also getting many of the other symptoms, either your mother has wishful thinking or she's getting on your case.|`|KWJ7ju6qaa	No! I'm assuming you're a teenager? You're cycles are still regulating!|`|AA12395149	It takes a few years before you'll have a regular cycle without being on birth control.  Some women never get a regular cycle (mine goes anywhere from 28 to 36 days, sometimes even more).  If you bled like you usually do, then you are probably not pregnant.  If your mom is so concerned, tell her to buy you a pregnancy test and find out for sure.|`|ZZMkENyeaa	no. One of the most common and sure signs of pregnancy is the cease of the menstrual cycle (your period). You probably just have an irregular cycle, I do.|`|mfnugUZJaa	No dear, you're not pregnant just because your period was a week early. Your period probably won't regulate completely until you're a little older.|`|hpnZ8awvaa	No.. Your period usually stops when you are pregnant.|`|UKHDlvM5aa	If you started your period, and it's more than just a little spotting, than it's 99% certain that you're NOT pregnant. Sounds like you're still a teenager. Lots of teenage girls have irregular cycles. Mine didn't even out until I was 19 or 20.<br>  <br>  Of course, if you're worried about pregnancy, then you must be having unprotected sex (otherwise you'd just tell your mom that you haven't had sex, so you're 100% sure that you can't be pregnant). Use a condom every time you have sex to protect against pregnancy and disease.
04i5rk92aa	Well..the first thing to know is..that you are not pregnant..you cannot get pregnant by oral sex. He needs to leave his sperm into you for you to get pregnant. The 2nd thing you should be doing is telling your mom that you have not got your periods for 2 months. You don'tt need to tell her about the oral sex part though..since you cannot get pregnant by that..your mom will know what to do.<br>  <br>  hope i helped..tc<br>  xoxo|`|YehcUSkoaa	honey, you can't get pregnant from swallowing! lol.  i'm sorry, i don't mean to laugh at you.  But sperm has to go into the vagina in order for that to work.  You are 15, your periods haven't evened out yet.  And if you are considering becoming sexually active, get on the pill.  PLEASE get on the pill.  don't become another statistic.|`|hpnZ8awvaa	You can't get pregnant from oral sex. And also, you said you haven't had your period since December, and you said you fooled around with a guy in Febuary, so um, doesn't really make sense.|`|sTrFZr9Xaa	Oral sex would not cause u such problem.<br>  Observe one more month.

Your period is just irregular.|`|dkzsbUy9aa	oral sex cannot get you pregnant unless sperm went into your mouth, transferred into his when you kissed, if you did then went into the vigina after he went down on you<br>  <br>  this is basically impossible though, the problem is going to be something to do with puberty, its not pregnancy|`|7wwLbWN1aa	If you believe that oral sex can get you pregnant, you should NOT have sex until you are properly educated. So, stop your actions right now. <br>  <br>  <br>  Uhm.... yeah... you're not pregnant. You're just irregular.|`|ce6c419afbc798ea522d146d175fa1ccaa	No. I think because you are still so young your period is still kinda wonky and getting into rhythm so I would suggest you take a test to be safe and don't worry.|`|9K8Zksfwaa	your period probably isnt regular yet, youre too young.

Good luck! :)|`|pxoTNYpCaa	Definitely fertility friend.

S5n5Za78aa	you could be? but i dont like to rely alone on that temp thing i thing its stupid and not accurate for everyone! i would track with some OPKS<br>  but thats just me look at this link this kind of just sums it up on why temps dont matter to me these woman still got there BFP even tho there temps were jacked up|`|7DWy8mPZaa	You're temps have dropped again after they seemed to be climbing a little but there is no spike as of yet, so you're yet to ovulate. Today might very well be the day - especially as you are close to your predicted O-day and Estrogen increases just before the egg, which can account for a drop before the rise. I'd definately get BD'ing just in case! Take a look at your other fertile signs as well as more than one piece of information is more useful than just looking at the temps alone, as all temps can really do reliably is give you verification AFTER ovulation that it has happened rather than predict it accurately. If your cervical mucus is in the fertile-stage too atm, this is a great sign that ovulation is imminent! <br>  <br>  Good luck catching that egg! ***|`|rDPADat1aa	It doesn't look like you've ovulated yet.  When you do, your temp will spike at least .4* the next morning and stay up above the cover line 10-16 days on average.  You can read more about it at <a href="http://www.fertilityfriend.com/" rel="nofollow">http://www.fertilityfriend.com/</a> and click on FAQs.  Good luck and baby dust to you!!
d7a221dc65e9541431ba88edec210e7aaa	first of all relax. stress can keep you from conceiving. go to a doctor, they'll check by ultra sound if you really are ovulating, they can do a PCT eventually, to check of your cervix is hospitable, they can check your fallobian tubes, and of course they can check your husbands sperm.<br>  <br>  i wish your a lot of luck!!!|`|RR35cmBdaa	hi try not no think about every time u have sex is u want to be pregnant i know its hard me and my boyfriend had been trying for 4 years and last few months i was like i want to get college finish and we just had fun not just think this time needs to be it i know its hard even a year off trying but that was us trying for 4 years and on monday i found out i was 5 weeks pregnant so think positive i was not talking nothing so it was done ourselves hope u the very best as it is hard but fingers crossed|`|WmkLRJDsaa	I just read an article about a fertility clinic that stated if you have been trying for about a year with no luck ... that it's time to see a doctor for some help. I would go and see if there might be some medical reason why.|`|yea2hci5aa	If I were you I would go to the doctor to get checked out and make sure everything is working properly.  If you're given the ok then I would have the doctor check out your husbands sperm count.<br>  <br>  I wish you the best of luck!|`|c65526ea03a8624f0b023c9a6db67ec0aa	It took my husband and I almost 2 years to get pregnant. I was on the patch for about 2 years before hand and I stopped using it in May of 2005 and finally got pregnant in May of 2007. I wasn't charting or anything though. I had just started checking my Cervical Mucus to estimate my time of ovulation like a few months before I got my BFP.<br>  Don't lose hope, this is totally normal. Even if you are charting you  could be having anovulatory cycles (which means you get all the signs you are about to ovulate but there is no egg) or maybe your hubby needs to get checked out. I would say you both go to the doc to make sure everything is working properly and then if it is, just keep trying, it will happen for you eventually, even though it is hard to wait. BEST OF LUCK!
a7364c50b7e6712ee3c77218a3232b45aa	I wouldn't use anything that says not for the age-group ever.<br>  <br>  Are you in USA?  Not sure if you have Sudocrem (is in UK) which is great for diaper rash.  I was sunburned in LA years ago and got instant relief from Noxzema cream - it was wonderful - hope you can find some.|`|60b853fe7d4335e1b74668b328b358b7aa	Try Triple Paste.  Seriously, it is the best.  You can find it at your local pharmacy or Wal-Mart.  It's pricey but well worth it.<br>  <br>  Just keep the area dry, I wouldn't attempt soaking him in anything other than an Aveeno oatmeal bath (they make it for babies) without consulting w/ my doctor.  Good luck|`|SnQvsOPwaa	Air, Let him run around for the day without anything on his but.|`|1hciyvKdaa	No, never use meds in a way they are not meant. Either the baby had a new food or formula etc that caused the rash, stop giving it to him, hes too young or allergic too it. Or he sat in a wet diaper too long, either way try letting him go naked when you feel its safe too, let some air get to that area, give him and extra bath maybe and let him then after you towel dry hmi put him in another towel and sit and read a book or something, let it breath, if you changed diapers recently too, go back to the old ones.  Call a DR before you do things on your own, there are only a few things to do and dont attempt rememdies that work for adults or whatever.<br>  I have never ever heard of epsom salts for a baby, so no dont do that. The doc knows best, stop the offending food, leave naked as often as you can, not even cream, just let the air get to it, then when you diaper put on the cream, baby specific only.|`|c73QkZ2haa	If he has had the rash for more than a week he needs to see a doctor cause it may be more than a rash. Babies can get yeast infection and just plain infections fom a really bad rash. Having said that.<br>  <br>  Give him a bath in warm water and give him some naked time before putting his diaper back on. We use penaten but sometimes nothing works. Make sure his butt is VERY dry b4 you put the cream on or you can trap moisture under it. I wouldnt use the antibiotic cream without talking to your doctor first.|`|RPc63EK2aa	I tried sudocream it is ok, but what is best is vaseline for baby... really it works for my baby, very effective... i will recommend to use vaseline for baby... just try, and see if it works for ur baby too...good luck!|`|fMilDRgLaa	I wouldn't try the antibiotic cream.  Is this a true diaper rash or a fungal infection?  If you think it is fungal have your pediatrician call in nyastatin cream for him. My boys from time to time would get both.  The best solution was to keep the area dry.  Sometimes I would let them run with no diaper on at home.<br>  <br>    The baby goldbond powder works great at keeping the area dry too. Just use caution that you don't sprinkle the powder like a wild one because I didn't want my boys to inhale any powder into their lungs. I also have used Maalox...yes REALLY!  It was used on a friend's son of mine who had surgery down there.  The baby had loose bowels and it reddened his bottom up badly.  The doctor told them to use Maalox.  <br>  <br>  However, you really need to call your pediatrician and they can walk you through your options and see if it is a diaper rash or fungal infection.  Hope he feels better soon.
iR9w7d7Yaa	They are fine to eat...i really want some wine gums now!!!|`|ZNhP3mpUaa	No wine. People say alcohol is ok once a day. It's not. Anything you eat or drink, the baby eats or drinks. even if you think your liver has removed all toxins before it gets to the baby. Wrong. Liver can't get 100% of it away from the baby. So unless you want your baby drinking wine, just stick to regular Gelatin.|`|3qLIRorjaa	It's fine. Don't let people scare monger you.|`|JjXFj2EBaa	There's way too much rubbish about what you can and can't have during pregnancy.  Just as long as your are being healthy you can go on as normal, although I never heard the gelatine one though|`|GxJL9UjVaa	of course you can eat wine gums.<br>  If you listened to all the old wives tales u'd be eating nothing!!<br>  <br>  ur doc will inform of the foods u cant eat|`|PrqCDZ7raa	you can't have wine!!!!!  so no wine gums, or listening to Amy Whinehouse|`|AA12121990	there is no problem with gelatin in pregnancy (where do people come up this stuff to scare women)

But no matter what the outcome is I think I would go see my ob/gyn for a blood test and to explain what you're feeling.  If you're not pregnant then you should still be checked out to see if what's happening to you is normal.<br>  <br>  Fingers crossed.  Good luck!

Some babies have gone as long as 15 days or more without a bowel movement.

An exclusively breastfed baby can go more than a week without a stool without worry. As long as his tummy is soft and he is acting comfortable, then there is no need for concern. If he becomes uncomfortable or has a hard tummy, then you will want to seek out a doctor's advice.|`|1hciyvKdaa	Call the Dr hes getting impacted, ask him what he wants you to use. No, never give babies water, call your Dr yes the baby could be geting constipated, no water until almost a year old.|`|MLgknFlVaa	Try putting one tsp of kayro syrup in a bottle of warm sterilized water.

I wish you the best and try laying your baby on his tummy over your knee and just rubbing his back, if he has pains in the tummy that will help to ease it as well as rubbing his back at the same time.|`|gCkVFu9Saa	You have my sympathy.

1G3XPiq3aa	There's a drink I take to help with my medications which is all natural so will probably be OK for your son as well. Ask your doctor about "Fybogel" when he calls back. I'm very fussy about what I drink but this has a very nice taste, so should be OK for your son. It's not a laxative, which can cause problems if you're using them long term with medication, but a drink with a lot of fiber to help digestion.<br>  <br>  Also, make sure he's getting lots of fruit and fibre in his diet, as well as drinking lots of water. Try buying him a new drink bottle and keeping it filled with water all day, or getting straws, so he's remembering to drink. Not implying he's dehydrated, but more water will always help.|`|60b853fe7d4335e1b74668b328b358b7aa	Will he eat yogurt?  Muffins?  Granola bars?

Fiber granola bars, yogurts, and things like that will help the food pass.  I had this same problem when I was younger.  <br>  <br>  The Phillips liquid stool softener is safe on children.  They even make a children's one.  You can just go to a local drugstore and they will have child laxatives.  Try asking the pharmacist.  They would know some safe ones that a child can take.|`|1KIwM1uOaa	apple juice and prunes are the first 2 that come to mind along with dried cherries or fresh cherries.  More fiber will also help to keep it from happening again.  You can also use karo syrup, put some in his juice and mix it well, doesn't taste the best but t helps.
sbeoF50gaa	um I'm not even going to ask why she was taken from you as that is none of my business but as for her cutting herself. Ok there is this thing called borderline personality disorder. It's extremely common in teens. I had that. My mom hated it! When she found out I cut myself she told me that if I ever did it again she would kick me out! My moms a therapist and sat me down one day to talk to me about it. She said that People like me are the worst kinds of patience and Dr. won't want to see me. I told her I didn't need a Dr. I just needed someone to talk to and she said "Well I'm not your therapist" which totally frustrated me cuz I just wanted my mom not a therapist. Why I did it. I had a lot of anger issues about a lot of different things and I didn't know how to cope, so cutting myself was 1. taking that frustration and doing something with it. 2. when you do that it's like a "relief" like.. a drug but I never did drugs, just the cutting. 3. it shows what she's feeling inside on the outside so you can SEE she's hurting. She will hopefully grow out of it, I did. She doesn't mean to kill her self it's a means of getting attention and her denying something is wrong is her way of putting up a wall. She wants help, but it's a shameful feeling getting it. This is to admit "I'm angry" and at who and why... these things can be hard to talk about. Those psych wards aren't always the best place for kids... I would never send my kid to one... but sometimes they do help. Your daughter probably needs her mom and a bed and a long conversation. Mom and I always had the best conversations laying in bed. You have pillows to cry on and hold. And you can move around and stay comfy. I still don't think kicking me out was the best solution to my problem, but I know she was angry because she cared about me. You can google "borderline personality disorder" and read up on it. Good luck with your daughter. If you have any questions about my experience with this you can email me.|`|XKYP0sGQaa	Well, if she is already in a programme and your visitation rights are limited, then unfortunately, at this present moment of time, apart from assuring her that you love her, there is not a lot you can do. <br>  <br>  It is when she comes out that she's going to need you the most. Just be patient with her. She will confide in you when need be. Do not push her too much.
YMbhiqASaa	I don't think you should tell them...I tried to get a job when I found out I was pregnant and at the interview they told right away I had the job and that they would call me and let me know when I can start working. Then after the interview was over, I told them I was expecting a baby and I never heard from them again. I called them almost a week later and they told me I wasn't qualified for the job. So I say wait to tell them.|`|ZNhP3mpUaa	No you do not have to let them know, and on top of that they are not allowed to ask you anything relating to whether or not you even may be pregnant. it's illegal practices for them to even ask.|`|rV8aWISGaa	you do not have to tell them.  they will discriminate against you. when you get a little further along act like you just found out and tell them and see what happens from there. good luck and congratz on your baby|`|RR7UX4jkaa	That would be discriminating against you if they didn't. It's not they bizness|`|bbbe6dfefaca75ee3b77a42fd45c8e5daa	I'm also looking for a job and less then 6 weeks pregnant I don't tell them b/c I don't want to take the chance that them well not hire me b/c of it.|`|Q4zl7vRkaa	No, you don't need to, but at some point you will need to be honest. It can give the hiring manager pause when considering you, which is illegal but still practiced nonetheless.|`|mh0QRDE9aa	Yes, tell them - If you don't, it is considered lying(fraud) for one thing since you mis - represented your self and second of all, they will fire you if you can't do the job you were hired for and therefore no unemployment benefits.  Play it safe and tell them.
mc6YtaRbaa	Even a faint line is a positive line. You're just not producing quite enough hCG to get a dark line. Call your Dr. and make an appointment and they will confirm for you. Good luck!|`|be8738c7b3a936fc2e865b3f0e6ad7d4aa	Was the line the proper color?<br>  <br>  If you can clearly see a line that is the proper color (usually pink or blue) and you don't have to hold it a certain way to see it, its positive.<br>  <br>  It has to be read within the time limit too.<br>  <br>  If its a whitish line that is where the test line would be then its not positive.<br>  <br>  I would test again in a few days.|`|XhIYAH6Laa	I have only ever used First Response and I have always had a faint positive line...every single time! Needless to say I have a 2 year old and another little one on the way...so even if it's faint it is still a positive result...CONGRATS!!!|`|ZVUrLZpXaa	Yes--usually even a faint line is a true positive!!Happened to me for all 4 of my pregnancies.<br>  <br>  Congratulations!!<br>  :-)|`|Jjx5WWFvaa	Yes i got the same result with my first pregnancy, the positive line was so faint you could barely see it but i gave urine sample to my doctor and they done one for me and that was positive too.  <br>  <br>  The line was faint because i was only 3 wks pregnant  but you can never get a test which shows positive when you are not but you can get a test that could show a negative when you are really pregnant but that is only down to the fact that the hormone levels are not strong enough to pick up.<br>  <br>  If i where you i would get a sample to my doctor as soon as possible and that will put your mind to ease.|`|FoDimTxCaa	Any positive result is a positive result no matter how faint the line is. When I took a test for my second baby the line was very faint and only just visible - it turned out I was only two weeks pregnant at the time of the test so probably not a massive amount of HCG. I would assume that you are pregnant and you will probablyfind that the test is much clearer if you take it again in a week or so. Good luck :-)|`|CpiLHcTlaa	a faint line is still a line! but i would wait for a few days and try again, or go to the doctors.<br>  <br>  i had a VERY faint line at the very end of the time limit with a pregnancy test with my first one and the doctor wasn;t sure he called it "inconclusive" and i came back a week later and it was a definite almost instant positive|`|RR7UX4jkaa	Yep, it's faint becuase the pregnancy hormone that is releases when you are pregnant is still slowly building up. It will get stronger. Your pregnant. That's is exactly the way it did my wife. There is no such thing as a false positive.|`|P1xlrvAaaa	Congrats.Even a faint positive is a +!!!!!!!Just go to the doctor and make sure that your hcg levels are rising as they should!!!!!Good luck and congrats!!!!!!!|`|GxJL9UjVaa	Your pregnant!!

Especially important if its a girl.|`|c73QkZ2haa	Well with a boy he doesnt have a Vag for anything to get stuck in so i dont think it really matters imo but for sanitary reasons its easier to wipe front to back because poo isnt the easiest thing to wipe off those little bits. And if its a girl o ya always front to back.|`|DllPvvPMaa	with a boy it doesn't matter what way you go with a girl you go front to back or it will give them an infection..
1z3C0R2Vaa	She is safe.............|`|mc6YtaRbaa	There is no "safe" day to have sex. A girl can get pregnant any day of the month, she is just more fertile around ovulation time. You need to wear a condom and put her on birth control. When you say you gave her pills, I'm assuming you mean the morning after pill? If that's the case, and she had a period from it, she will start her cycle over from that point. The morning after pill will mess up her current cycle and start her over.|`|rrWhhiMEaa	You are not married and I dont think you should take any chances. From now on please use condoms every time you have sex.<br>  <br>  This pills can be dangerous, do not use it for regular birth control.  I dont think it sounds like she has concieved... this time. In one month you will know for sure.|`|91Z7VIRTaa	It is not advisable to have sex within three days of period.|`|pOL4Z3xAaa	just the word menstration makes me feel queezy|`|R4F05z4Faa	she is safe or not but , question aries here  are you safe if she conceive ?|`|33klTYfWaa	she is safe<br>  from the first day of ms till 9th day - safe including 4-5 ms days<br>  from the 10th day to 20th day-        unsafe<br>  from 21th day to till ms         - safe<br>  it works above 90 %|`|oI69FqTXaa	SHE IS CONCEIVED <br>  <br>  AFTER MENSTRUATION THE OVUM WILL BE REMAINED UPTO 72 HOURS OR 3 DAYS
JjBwydymaa	oo hunni...<br>  <br>  i would get yourself to the doctors and get them to do a blood test on you! Blood tests ae far more accuarte than the urine tests...|`|0VHolTVEaa	I would go to the doctors straight away, they will do a urine test and blood test to tell you whether you are pregnant or not. The symotoms you describe tell me your pregnant so good luck. Not all pregnancy tests work so dont worry just visit a doctor asap. Good luck|`|qHa4w8eyaa	You seem to have a lot of the symptoms associated with pregnancy!  Rather than speculating, however, I would just get a blood test done.  I've heard that HPTs don't work for everyone.  Besides, the sooner you know, the better you'll take care of yourself.  I hope the results are as you wish them to be. :)
abDyYtLhaa	if she puts her love life first before her kids then i think that person is incapable of taking care of a child or even a relationship for that matter|`|mO7FOXNYaa	What do I think?<br>  <br>  I think a mother who puts "love" first before children is selfish and immature. Plus, if the mother is dating a man who finds that behavior acceptable - that man is just as bad! <br>  <br>  My situation with my boyfriend is different. He was friends with my son's godmother, so he already knew him when we first started dating. I made sure my son didn't know about our dating until we were exclusive and serious about it.  <br>  <br>  Also, during a weird conversation, my boyfriend asked me "If you  had to save one life, me or Allen (my son), who would you save?"  I think a millisecond passed when I said "Allen." My boyfriend knows that I love him, but my list of priorities are:<br>  <br>  1. Allen<br>  2. Cagney (my boyfriend)<br>  3. Family<br>  4. Job<br>  <br>  And what proves that my boyfriend is a good man is that he UNDERSTANDS my priorities and ACCEPTS them. If a man expects to be first, before a woman's children, he is an idiot.|`|6VbNJOtfaa	Your kids should always come first.  That being said I do not think that single mothers should have to hide in closets and have no life whatsoever.  It is not a good situation when men are coming in and out of your life (in all honesty, not good for mothers or non-mothers alike).  If you made the choice to have children then their feelings have to come first.  There will always be a chance for her to be a floozy when the kids are grown and gone.|`|ZSBZ83Dpaa	I fel for the kids too, but would they be happy with a frustrated mom who craves sex and is in a bad mood because she doesn't get it? I think it all depends onhow the woman arranges her life and how she makes her kids feel. If she just goes out a lot and has a reliable sitter that is okay. I think it is heartless though to bring in a new surrogate daddy every other month.|`|pT7jrsAgaa	I was a single mom for 6 years and I probably dated a total of 3 times before I met my husband.  I would only go out when they spent the night with grandma and I NEVER had a "friend" over to meet them.  I didn't let my husband meet them until I was absolutely certain the relationship was serious and this man would be someone positive in their lives that they could look up to and love.|`|03n14OLLaa	My mom used to leave me to watch my brothers and sisters while she would go off with whatever guy and if i needed help she'd tell me to invite my boyfriend over! I think those kinds of situations are horrible. I was taken by social services later though for that and some other reasons.|`|WirFwirLaa	I don't have a problem with single parents dating. I mean, everyone deserves to be with someone they love, but if you have kids, you need to put them first. Boyfriends will probably come and go but you have your kids for life.|`|OPTDFRuzaa	thats ashame for the kids. some women just dont care.|`|Dnn06ytKaa	I feel bad for the kids. I hope they know that their mother loves them, she's just feeling lonely. Hopefully they have someone else close to them to get the love they deserve.|`|VwMkiLFPaa	It happens so much more than you think!<br>  <br>  I don’t care who my husband’s ex dates, nor does he. And honestly, have as many men/women as you want, just don’t bring that behavior around your kids. Don’t let your kids see these men, don’t let these men into your home for any reason. Don’t even introduce them as friends. <br>  <br>  I feel bad for my stepdaughter sometimes. Finally her mother has stayed with this one man for a few months.(Fingers crossed) But before that, it was a new man every other weekend. And my stepdaughter would meet these men and say “Mommy’s friend….”. Not cool. Kids don’t need to know or see adult business. Period!<br>  <br>  Do as you please, but don’t put your kids on the back burner and certainly don’t bring that life around your kids!|`|EtCRnDJMaa	selfish<br>  <br>  inconsiderate|`|b978f631fc787a963337206aa3833370aa	Gack. <br>  <br>  The revolving door of boyfriends does nothing for young children who are probably desperate for attention from their mother and in need of a solid father figure. It doesn't mean they have to be married, necessarily, but it would help if they cared enough about each other to stay together. Otherwise i'd say don't even bother introducing them to the kids until you're sure you're serious enough about him - because what happens once the kids get attached and boyfriend #31 goes bye bye? i've seen this happen alot in friends/acquaintances' relationships and the kids are usually crushed. They have no understanding of what's going on and it's really sad. <br>  <br>  No one is saying single moms have to be lonely and stay at home all the time, but geez, her kids are probably going through a rough time as it is and need her.|`|xQJjTuEWaa	That is such crap!  My mom did that to me and I was pretty old high school but that is when a daughter really needs her mom to talk to and the fact was she only wanted me when her "Guy" wasn't around.  It really hurt me and if it goes on to long it does cause long term damage.  My mom and I have a better relationship now that I am older and married but I am still there for her more than she is me.  The guys Always came first and that really hurt me.|`|QveBSjFSaa	My step-daughter's mother was married 4 times by the time she was 34, and her daughter 15.<br>  Lived with a convicted felon, and dated one of the daughter's friends fathers.<br>  But, somehow, my husband is the bad guy according to his ex wife.<br>  He and his current wife (me) have been married for 13 years.<br>  p.s. I think it's REPREHENSIBLE|`|Izn1ye9Raa	What a sad life for the children.
ThnKiLfTaa	Hi, first I want to applaud you for being an involved parent who cares about their child's education. So many parents use the boob-tube babysitter and it is not healthy for a child to watch t.v all day. There are several interactive learning websites for preschoolers and/or Kindergartener's one is..... www.starfall.com another is www.funschoolkaboose.com or www.literacycenter.net (click on play and learn) or www.readtoday.net you could buy some preschool workbooks and teach him from those. You could look up online and try and find a preschool curriculum that you could use or you could buy one. Also, check the public library there is always LOADS of resources there for teaching children. One thing to remember is making learning FUN for your son! You and him could have a blast together, it could be some good mommy/son time together. Best of luck and God Bless!!|`|ZZzQLjaKaa	Set up a schedule for your week. It is easy to have the days melt away if you do not. Consult the local library and parks and recreation to see what free or low costs programs exsist, then plan a schedule. Other places like Micheals and Home Depot have cheap activities for your preschooler as well. Hopefully you have some friends you can have play dates with as well. Then make a plan. We usually go out 2-3 days a week, story time at the library on Wednesdays, a play date one day a week, and toddler tumbling etc. That gets you out of the house and mentally stimulated. The other days, set a schedule for playing outside (weather permiting), an art project for those days (tons of ideas to be found by googling preschool art), also a cooking project, where you really let him do the measuring, scooping and stiring; get some cds of childrens songs from the library and put those on during free play time. And be certain to set aside time everyday for stories and lots of reading. I would also make sure you have some dress up time, as kids love dramatic play and need to do it. I am sorry this rambled a little, but there are tons of things to do if you give yourself some structure. Good Luck!
v3YJq4moaa	Totally normal. I remember walking around fro two weeks and feeling like the baby was going to fall out of me. sounds like your baby has dropped and is engaged. You are ready for labor at anytime and this is a good sign. Be prepared to get even a little more uncomfortable though. Walk walk and walk. that helped me even though I walked slow like a turtle. I also had sharp pains and this was because of the baby putting so much pressure from the drop and now being engaged. My doctor said this was all normal. I had all the indigestion in the end as well. Good luck and Don't worry. If you worry then just call the Doctor and talk to the nurse practitioner. I did that all the time the last few weeks.|`|2WfHLUyOaa	I dunno huni but to be safe id go get yourself to the doctor asap and huni goodluck with your new baby.. I wish you and baby the world of happiness.xx|`|OPTDFRuzaa	Hi it sounds like baby engaging or moving right down as far as 4/5 engaged. look at your bump has it dropped? if it has already baby must have engaged. it does not sound like labour though. hope you dont have top wait too long. good luck.
1thzSbS8aa	The government program is too temporary to be of any long-term use to you. It will also not increase your independence. You will merely be dependent on taxpayer funds, instead of your grandmother's.<br>  <br>  If you took the $400 room at your mother's friend's house, you will probably need to be earning at least $900 a month to cover the other expenses you listed (and some you probably haven't considered). And if you are not on great terms with her personally, this will probably also be a very temporary living arrangement.<br>  <br>  Stay with your grandmother, get a job, and *save* your money. If she won't take rent from you, buy groceries occasionally, or do some of the heavier chores, which believe me older ladies appreciate. Respect her house rules and her house, since you'll be alone in it most of the time. But independence cannot begin without you actually getting a job and earning money now. Two years is not a lot of time. To move toward real independence at 18, you will most likely need a car (requiring gas and insurance, over and above the purchase price) and your own place (which will usually require two months rent as a deposit). So you need cash in hand. And you need to graduate from high school. With all that in mind, I don't see a logical alternative to living with your grandmother.|`|pm2EeEgiaa	First, Try to earn enough self-respect for yourself and then this will be the right time to be independent - it seems that you need someone to help you decide and you can consult a counselor or a minister to help you sort things out.<br>  <br>  Independence is not all fun - it entails A LOT of responsibility. If I were you, I'd live with my grandmother (who I think is caring by the way you write here) until I'm 18 y/o - and I would get a couple of vocational subjects such as auto repair and whatnot.
5e8276e29e4038d2a3b299690bb756e5aa	Sounds like a great punishment.  Way to go mom, that was a very valid way to handle things.  She's lucky that's all she got.  My mom would've killed me if this would've happened to me.|`|VHHis05Naa	I bet the people who think you are overreacting are 15 year-olds themselves.  I think you did a great job.|`|0e0a0f1828f99f87ea3d5e5bc8cbd46daa	Sigh...you are TOTALLY Overeacting. Give her a BREAK, she is 15 years old, not a BABY. Let her GROW Up.<br>  <br>  No, I am not a 15 year old, I am 41 thank you very much.|`|pT7jrsAgaa	Haven't we been through this already?  You're her mom, no matter what we say it's YOU who decides the punishment, obviously you already have.  If you still feel the need to be validated by your decisions, I'd suggest asking a therapist.  If you feel you made the right choices as a parent, move on.|`|QSUg9vNLaa	Her BF undid her bathing suit so you take them away? wtf!?! that has nothing to do with anything! Just ground her from being out of the house ( other than her school and dance of course) and give her back the bathing suits. sheesh thats so dumb.|`|SrSfZJTKaa	That I am aware of nobody has become pregnant by the undoing of a bikini top!|`|3iL7V04waa	In my opinion, that's a little harsh for undoing the bikini top.  When I was 15, my mother found out that I had been making out with a boy in the basement without a top on.  Just her finding out was enough for me not to do it when she could find out.  I repeat, for her to find out.  Your daughter is going to be sexually involved (I don't mean sex, but kissing, making out, etc) when you're not around, so it's better just to let her know the consequences of her actions in terms of her body and her relationship.  Think back to when you were 15.  You finding out about the situation is much more embarrassing than any punishment.
dIW2tVxhaa	I'd give pre-boiled water in all honesty, but it should be fine. Don't mix it with juice! I had this with all 4 of mine and they all drink water just fine, they don't balk at it like a lot of kids I know :) Think ahead LOL|`|VwMkiLFPaa	My son loves water too. He was drinking from a cup at 3 months and he’d only be given water. Our pediatrician saw no issues with it. And I’m glad I started young, my son STILL loves water and he’s 2 yrs old. I love that he’d choose water over juice! Less sugar!|`|b11d4406389c926e8457572221d6ce48aa	Good grief. Are we talking about well water or river water? <br>  Give the child some water.|`|o5Ez7Gyraa	I did my kids since birth it helps with hiccups too. the hospital gave me little bottles of water, its safe!<br>  **where i live we have boil water warnings sometimes, so I would buy the gallon jugs, and some store have where you can refill them for under 1.00|`|aYCjy8Neaa	It's completely fine. That's around the time you want to start a sippy cup and juice anyways. So just put some water in a sippy for her and she will be fine. It's better if she loves water and doesn't want juice. It's much healthier.|`|w9TzZCt8aa	yes it is completely safe. when my little brother was 5 months old he started to have water, it is a lot healthierer
43af73c5e88c213db3e3b2abf87c8bdcaa	You should definately use the vaporizer, and also if he gets a lil stuffy, you should try the *little noses. A couple drops in each nostril and then suction it out. Wash your hands before handling the baby or preparing his bottle. Try to keep the baby comfy. I know when my lil guy became sick I packed him around most of the day. Do not let your sick relatives handle the baby. I know it is tough to do alone. But ofcourse it is worth it. All you can do now is wait it out and let it run its course. If it becomes severe, you may have to put him on some kind of antibiotic. Good Luck!
wiAVa1H5aa	It probably means your partner is the source of infertility.
88HhRgZ4aa	Well my mom and My sister both had the same thing, then when they were having contractions thats where all the pain was. So Im assuming its related to where your main contractions will be? Im not a doctor and Im sure most people on here arnt so your best bet would be to always talk to your doctor when ur unsure of something.|`|GhETSRdUaa	Woman, of course your back is going to hurt. A fetus is slowly developing and growing inside of you. And that's not anything your body is used to. That ain't the only thing that's going to hurt.|`|OXXE3T2Aaa	yes its normal and will only get worse my doctor told me to use a heating pad, take a hot shower on ur back only, or take advil.|`|iQaKNSI6aa	don't worry it happens to everybody, just try your best to ignore it. mine was so bad that i felt like the baby ws gonna come out of my butt.|`|OE8Yoam9aa	Yes that is completely normal.<br>  It can just be the pressure of your growing uterus.<br>  That sometimes make your back sore.
hgbfzGSMaa	As far as I know, there is no stated "legal age" for babysitting.  Whether someone is capable of babysitting has very little to do with age, and more with a variety of factors such as how old the child(ren) are, how long they are required to be in charge of the children, if the parents are easily reachable, where the babysitting is taking place, and whether or not there is an adult nearby in case of emergency.<br>  <br>  Generally speaking, 13 is a good age to start babysitting.  For instance, I let my 13 year old son babysit his 10 year old sister, but would never put him in charge of a small child, but there are some adults that I wouldn't leave either of my children in their care.|`|Av9jeRAkaa	you have to be at least 12 years of age, i believ you can babysit as much as 7 children|`|X9JSlC6Iaa	Idk. But I doubt people care ifr you are legal age to babysit their kids. Search it on google. I was 8-9 when I started babysitting but I was VERY mature for my age. So I guess it depeneds.|`|0c30f5fdc0cc17a33e0ba8fe4201b997aa	I think the appropriate age is at least 12 or 13. But you also have to take into consideration the development of the child that will be doing the babysitting. If they don't act responsible, it's likely that people wouldn't want them babysitting their kids. But if they are mature enough to handle the responsibility, then it'd be perfectly fine.|`|w9TzZCt8aa	any age. when i was younger like 10 my mum rang up and ask how old does the child need to be and they said any age as long as their responsible so u could have a 10 year old who is really responsible or a 16 year old which is not. the 10 year old could be in charge.<br>  there is no maxi-min|`|888da073058edf23cbf0d88404506caaaa	12 no more than 2|`|ejelObdJaa	i think is 12.... & not a lot ! =)
kzyEuRroaa	Candles, stationary or note cards, bath and body stuff- you can usually get the Victoria's Secret Garden stuff for decent prices if you buy a certain amount, same goes for Bath and Body shop.  Write each a thank you note, and attach it to a bags of candies or cookies.|`|UfrUnzkEaa	A few baby showers I went to, wrapped candy in a special bag and attached it to a picture frame or put it in a baby crib like from a hobby store. Try a craft store or school supply store and get small things related to baby shower stuff. <br>  Personally, I like a hand written note saying thank you.|`|YEqQZgs5aa	I gave my sister in law n Aunt each an inexpensive bottle of wine, and found hand painted wine glasses at the christmas tree shop for 2 bucks each and a basket to put them in for a buck!<br>  <br>  They loved them!|`|KgD3VhKYaa	A picture of your last scan, framed- when baby born keep updating the picture for them

When I was pregnant I didn't know that was hiccups until I was at the doctors office and he got them.|`|8KjPGiH7aa	Yeah it's probably hiccups! My baby hiccups at a different time everyday and it's never predictable. I'm 39 weeks pregnant and I've felt hiccups just about everyday for quite some time! Totally normal. Good luck. :)|`|zuZKj3xXaa	uh oh... early sign of tourettes.."idk how to spell it."<br>  <br>  but i am SOOOOOOOO Joking. lol i went through that scare a while back, it felt like little jerks, in sync...my belly would move up and down. i thought she was Ticking and having spasms! i asked my doctor, and he Laughed at me, told me they were the Hiccups :) <br>  <br>  no worries, its your little one practicing breathing movements :) lol<br>  <br>  39 weeks today!|`|3NoDjKLoaa	it probably was.. if this is your first child you can expect to start feeling the baby at about 20-22 weeks.  congrats to you! remember to count the movements!|`|OPTDFRuzaa	yes it could have been although that is early i never felt them till i was 30 weeks plus but every woman is different.|`|AA12240972	Yes and enjoy them now cuz in 3 months they'll be driving you crazy.
aQ8o4w3Xaa	Yes, 16 is the legal age of consent for sex in the UK. No matter where you live. This includes Northern Ireland, Scotland, Wales and England. As long as you are both 16+ it's not illegal.

You do have the 13 y/o father.|`|rB3cyt0Paa	of age is 18<br>  <br>  if do it at 16 use protection|`|OefiQHiOaa	U sound so DESPERATE.

Call your church, or churches in your area, and ask how you can help single moms who are in need- I am sure they can point you in the right direction.<br>  <br>  Offering yourself to people on the internet is very dangerous, and sets you up to be taken advantage of.

oUcLSDZ6aa	I don't know what you will do, but you should put ice on it, keep an eye on her and make sure she doesn't develop a fever. If she's acting out of character or starts to seem lethargic, take her to the ER.|`|3331cf16d944d6e25fdb82bfbdfed4c8aa	Put an ice pack on it. It's probably not serious; toddlers are very resilient.<br>  <br>  Watch for signs of unusual drowsiness (not nap time sleepiness) or unequal eye movements.  If you notice either of these symptoms, you need to call the Dr.  right away.<br>  You may want to check with the Dr. anyway, just to be assured of how serious (or not) this bump is.|`|BnR4LLhxaa	Put some ice cubes in a plastic bag, wrap a washcloth around that so it doesn't feel too cold on her skin, then apply it to the bump. I can see where it might be hard to keep it there for very long - two year olds can be pretty squirmy. But try to keep it in place for as long as you can, as often as you can. <br>  <br>  This can help to prevent more swelling and reduce the present bump.<br>  <br>  Good luck. That kind of thing seemed to happen to our kids the day before we had scheduled a photo appointment for them - very annoying.|`|3NoDjKLoaa	put some ice on her head.. check her for signs of a concussion, is she walking fine? is she still crying after some cuddling and a kiss on the head? she will be fine.. bumps are common..if you want to be totally sure just dont let her sleep for a while.. if she seems really sleepy, take her to the doctor, but try to keep her awake.|`|HosJ3bNgaa	er take her to the hospital

Put your q&a on private if you don't already. I get called a troll sometimes too because I did that, but I pissed a guy off in religion and spirituality and then he started following me and posting bad things about me and giving me thumbs downs. <br>     Also, it might just be someone mistaking you for a troll. A lot of times when kids stay home sick from school they get on here and ask questions, so that may be it too. Block anyone who does it and if they don't answer the question you ask, you can report them. That is what I do. It might seem a little harsh, but "I don't know" is not an answer and if they go on a rant that is also against the rules.<br>      Also, make sure that you are following the rules. Therefore, if it comes down to it, at least you know you did nothing wrong.<br>      Sorry, I know that those people are really annoying, you just have to keep going.
Zbn8A7Geaa	I realize you've been to counseling and that's good for you. And while it may help you get a grip on your feelings and emotions, it may not be so helpful with actual parenting tips.   You need to do more than call the parenting hotline. You need parenting CLASSES.  You need FAMILY therapy with a counselor whose expertise lies in adopted families (and first time parents of adoptees).  I'm sure a lot of the kids' behavior is rooted in their past, so family therapy will help you all.  Plus the family therapy will help you bond with the children and will help you build a strong relationship with them (plus help with the day to day routine of parenting).<br>  <br>  Parenting is a hell of a lot of work -- and what you describe is what ALL parents go through on a daily basis.   But you need to learn how to have fun with your kids as well which is what makes it all worthwhile.  And parenting classes as well as family therapy can help with that.  You jumped into parenthood by taking two children at the age you did (bless your heart for doing it) and it will take some time to adjust and get the hang of it.  But you will, with help.  So please look into classes in your area.  If there are none that you can find, talk to your doctor and see if they recommend someone who can help.  Just don't give up.|`|9d3779e08741de60c8b3afd027f91e1eaa	Find a counseling group.<br>  <br>  Try to get these kids involved in a social outlet.  Church is the best imo because the kids have to go on lots of outings and mostly spend time doing social work.|`|W7NZHmClaa	Parenting is the toughest job out there. Not everyone is meant to be a parent. You have to think how hard it is for them too. In a new country with 2 people that are always "redirecting behavior, imposing consequences for bad choices, trying to explain why they should or should not do something, cleaning recurring messes". They are children. They do not come with a handbook. Have you thought of getting the children into therapy? Perhaps there are issues that you do not understand and they are too small to explain it to you and the only way they know how to express it is bad behavior. <br>  Also, you need to try to start on a clean slate. Being that you and your husband have been together for 10 years I'm sure you had your days and nights probably pretty routine. Bringing 2 children into it...means you will have no routine. Try waking up tomorrow and asking, what can I do to help my kids rather than dread wanting to know what's in store for the day.
60a3bbdca78e74fb19db426e27b9a087aa	From my 1st childbirth prep class I asked the same question! Can you feel the dilation. The answer is ABSOLUTELY!!!<br>  <br>  She also explained the when the baby presses against your rectum the urge to push, like when you feel like you have to poop, is natural. Maybe the baby is "engaged" now, pushing down and getting ready to start labor.<br>  <br>  CONGRATS. You should call your practitioner just to see what she/he suggests. Probably just need to wait for now.|`|8KjPGiH7aa	I'm 39 weeks pregnant today too!!<br>  February 27!!<br>  That makes three of us :)<br>  Lol, sorry i got distracted, I don't think you can feel yourself dilate.

We decided to take a break from fertility, mainly because I was very nervous about starting injectable meds and the risk of multiples they bring. I also wanted to try to lose some weight, since I thought that might help (I have PCOS). I lost about 20 lbs, and got pregnant without any intervention. Currently about 20 weeks, we have our anatomy scan on Monday.<br>  <br>  Good luck- it's hard, but totally worth it. Now that we're finally here, the 18 months don't seem as bad. When we were going through it, it felt like tortue.|`|2274dcf5eba0ee2ef3aabbe2c8b0a89daa	it took me about 8 months. i was on the pill for years and it took me about 3-4 months for my cycle to start regulating. then at about 7 months we decided to stop trying for now, untill we got a house and bam october i was pregnant.. its funny the way things work sometime.|`|eU5Eth2aaa	It took my husband and I only 4 tries.

We are both healthy and we just weren't getting pregnant so in the summer of 2007 we were both checked. My husband was VERY fertile and all the tests they did on me at that time said I was fine too. I didn't have insurance at that time so I had to wait a while before getting more tests done. I went back to the doctor in May of 2008 and they thought that i may have endometriosis so I had a laparoscopy to check and that came back fine. So on June 13th I went in for my post-op appointment and my doctor put me on 50mg of clomid and we also went out and bought a clearblue easy fertility monitor. On July 16th I took a pregnancy test and it was POSITIVE! It still hasn't hit me yet. I'm almost 35 weeks now with a baby girl! <br>     It will happen for you! I do recommend the monitor if you can afford it. They are kind of pricey but you can buy them on ebay for a little cheaper. That's what I did. Good luck!|`|ECPdAeHQaa	When I actually started to try and read up on tips to get pregnant, it took me 3 months.  <br>  I started eating things with folic acid<br>  stopped wearing tampons and wore pads only<br>  Stayed in bed after sex with pelvic up for 15 minutes. <br>  Relax and have fun :)<br>  <br>  Although it did take my older sisiter 3 years to get pregnant and she tried fertility drugs and stimulation and EVERYTHING. Finally she got pregnant and right after she had her she got pregnant again. I think it happens when it's time.|`|IogJBs2Naa	My story is actually kind of funny.  My boyfriend and I were volunteering at the Democratic Headquarters during the election and one night we were there really late (by ourselves) and I'm sure you know what happened then a few weeks ago I find out that I'm pregnant and then two weeks ago I find out we are having identical twins.  It's crazy since we weren't trying at all and I'm wasn't even certain that I could conceive right now since I have leukemia but it happened.  Even though it's very high risk we both feel so blessed.|`|skb5URcsaa	It took about 2 1/2 years. we were both checked and were told that we were both fine. I went on clomid and hcg trigger shots to help regulate my ovulation, it seemed to work, except, I wasn't getting pg. I finally went to a specialits who found a dermoid cyst on one ovary and another cyst on my tubes that supposedly was not causing any  problems. He removed them laprascopically, I had to go back on the pill for a few months because he wanted my ovaries to heal and he did not want them ovulating. After 3 months we already had an IUI scheduled with injectables, I did that, I had 1 follicle only when they did the IUI and I got pregnant immediatly. So I really think it was the cyst that was causing my problems.|`|8zdPI8Qsaa	With our first it took 3 months. We weren't necessarily 'trying' (ie planning around ovulation and having sex extremely often to up chances) ...I had just stopped taking the pill and figured it might take up to a year. I was pleasantly surprised though :-)<br>  Second time around... we had used some form of protection since my son was born, but had ONE day where we decided not to (in my mind I thought I was further away from ovulation than I actually was). Had sex 4 times that day (not a common occurrence), and boom I was pregnant (I think I was probably about 4 days before ovulating). <br>  Good luck to you!!|`|Zz1HI5VHaa	We've been trying for 10 years with no luck.

smsUZG4Iaa	The term implantation bleeding implies that you would see the amount of blood that you typically see with your period, but this generally isn't the case when you are experiencing implantation. Implantation bleeding occurs when an egg has been fertilized and implants into the lining of the uterus. Because the lining uterus is made up of blood, there can be a bit of blood expelled in some women. <br>  <br>  Implantation will appear before you expect your period and many people mistaken it for spotting before their period begins. As mentioned before, most women do not experience a full on bleeding with implantation. Instead, they may experience a bit of spotting in their panties or even some pinkish or brown discharge. This usually is usually not a flowing type of blood, so if that is what you are experiencing it might be better to assume that you have your period. If you happen to get a positive pregnancy test and you are experiencing a flow of blood you might want to get in touch with your doctor to ensure that all is well.<br>  <br>  Because there is typically so little and it is before you would expect your period it would be normal to think you are just getting ready to start your period. But, if you are attempting to get pregnant and you know that you ovulated and you had sex around that time it might be a good indication that you are in fact pregnant. Of course, you can't confirm pregnancy with the presence of a bit of blood, but it may be a very good indication that you'll get a positive pregnancy test in the very near future.|`|c3eb9cc5af710aa695ddf32e0b5e463aaa	Make sure you get a blood pregnancy test before starting birth control pills if this period is -very- unusual for you.|`|nVeZzuFvaa	Implanation bleeding is when your baby implants itself into your uterine lining. Basically, when you get your period, you are shedding the lining of your uterus. So since the pregnancy hormone stops this, and your lining becomes blood rich, and thicker for the baby, you can sometimes bleed during implantation. Its completely normal, but if you are concerned, see your OBGYN. <br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|J4wTIhsoaa	Wellz, i dnt noe whut that is. butt whut i canz tellz u. u lady iz preganantant. Usez condiments next timez!!!butt dat baby iz birth controlz 4 da next 9 monthz so enjoyez.|`|WIEPISyeaa	Implantation bleeding happens when the egg burrows into the wall of your uterus.  It usually happens about 6-10 days after you ovulate (so a few days before your expected period.)  <br>  <br>  I would say, since the spotting didn't happen until you were already a few days late, that it is likely that you just had a wierd period this cycle.  If it is implantation bleeding, you will probably see NO red blood.  Only pink/brown.  I would wait another week, take another HPT and if it's negative then I would probably say that your period started on the 18th (even though it was different and extra light.)<br>  <br>  If you want immediate results, you can always go to your local hospital's lab and get a blood test.  Where I'm from they only cost ten dollars, and you know the results within a few hours.<br>  <br>  Good luck!!!!
1G3XPiq3aa	It's a personal choice, so I don't think you can write your paper in such an absolute manner.<br>  <br>  Things a woman may take into consideration when making her personal decision not to have an abortions.<br>  <br>  -Regrets she may have afterwards<br>  -Her religious beliefs<br>  -The fathers thoughts<br>  -Whether or not she considers potential life on the same level as an already born child<br>  -A very small risk of not being able to have children again<br>  <br>  Again though, to write your paper saying a woman should never have an abortion is denying a legal right, so probably not the best way to go.

They might even be able to give you reference books.|`|xq7S9H5Raa	It is killing an innocent life.  That may be your only and last chance of having a baby.  Why if your mom had aborted you then you would not be here.  Every child deserves a chance to be born.|`|JZnRxPUCaa	I would say a medical con of having an abortion, (a surgical abortion) would be the risks it can potentially have on your health.  There is a risk of scarring in that area which could potentially lead to an ectopic pregnancy if you ever want to conceive.<br>  Another con of having an abortion could be all of the emotional side effects that it has on you.  I have a friend who had an abortion in highschool because she felt she was not going to be an adequate mother, and it ended up putting her into a deep depression.  All she could think about was that she murdered her child. <br>  Another reason it can be harmful to your emotions is at some abortion clinics especially the Planned Parenthood ones there are people who stand out side and protest that what you are doing is wrong..ect. That could make you feel like scum<br>  (this isn't necessarily scientific information, but it could help)<br>  Hope this helps out a little bit!|`|39a2d5e9bc3c417cbdc5ba33cb6386bbaa	Realistically, the only cons are the guilt  or regret she might have if she was forced or did not actually want the abortion, or guilt put on her by family or friends that didn't approve.  The other possible con is that abortion is a medical procedure, and like any other medical procedure it has risks like bleeding, discomfort, etc.  Please don't use propaganda to support your paper, research non bias sources.  For example, abortion has been rumored to increase the risk for breast cancer and infertility.  This has been proven many times over in scientific studies to be untrue.  Research carefully!|`|DRb4Qlypaa	It is selfish. No matter what. No matter what the problem is, if you put the baby up for adoption, the family will take care of the prenatal care and then take the baby right after birth, The mother never has to even see it if she doesn't want to. <br>  It is simple selfishness: They don't want to have to go through the labor for an innocent baby that they created. <br>  It also diminishes one's chances of getting pregnant again, and an increased risk for tubal pregnancies.|`|2274dcf5eba0ee2ef3aabbe2c8b0a89daa	when you have a abortion they artificially dilate your cervix and it can cause future problems in being able to carry a baby at a time when your ready. you can also have scaring which will cause you to have a c secton or a infection in your uterus which can cause it to be removed so you can never have kids...|`|XXZFf1AYaa	Just my opinion, but whenever the pregnancy has gone beyond the 1st trimester, abortion is unacceptable. Also, unacceptable to have an abortion because the baby has down syndrome or some other non life threatening birth defect.|`|cY8DgJv5aa	There are lots of websites that you could look at to get information and site your own sources.

When a women loses her baby, its like losing herself. They is a big black empty hole.. You start to listen to songs "Happy birthday" by Flipside, and then you start to cry. I've never had an abortion, but I wouldn't do it anyways, i've misscarried, and I know how it feels to die inside.<br>  <br>   Some people can go through it and not feel any difference... But a lot do. A friend of mine, couldn't even look her boy friend in his face afterwards. He told her to do it, because he isn't ready to become a daddy, and her mom was pushing her to do it too. She didn't want to, and she was almost at the dead line when you can't do it anymore, she was going to have twins. 2 beautiful little girls... But because someone made the choice for her, and pushed her into the car, and told her to shut up and she's getting it done like it or not. She lost her babies. And she's never forgave herself. I talk to her a lot, she's pregnant again, with a baby to early to tell what it is. But I believe she is still mourning over her girls. She isn't getting an abortion this time, its the same guy. But she is going to make sure everyone hears her. She tells me about her baby moving and all the funny feelings.<br>  <br>  I was 4 months pregnant with a little boy. His name was going to be Roy. After my fiance, but i misscarried and i'm sad about it and think about it alot. I use to blame my self about it, but realized it happened.

If you do  a search on abortion there are countless sources. If you'd like to include a picture to drive the point home, they usu. have them on there as well.

Go and see your doctor|`|36b896fa4fc601073bf39cd2434a5cdfaa	your the next octomom|`|mFQydvncaa	you are probably fine but stress does delay your period, If your worries go to a doctor for blood work or go to planned parent hood they can help you. Goodluck!|`|Fw1di2cBaa	You could be, but you need to call your doctor and get a blood test so you can relax.  Then you will know for sure.  Some pills can mess up your cycle too.
bae3b34f8cfcdb7878e0d8bfe7de1948aa	It doesn't matter that he doesn't move. Babies hearing is very well developed (depending on how far along you are of course) and he may be more likely reacting to the pop or rock in a negative way because it's too loud for him and tries to "get away" by moving. There's no way to tell for sure if it's a good or bad thing because you can't see him. :) I would not worry too much though but maybe turn the naturally louder music down a bit and see if that changes anything?|`|mgiJVjaKaa	He can hear the music, even if he isn't moving around a lot.  Maybe the bass/loud noises of the pop/rock makes him more awake :)|`|3Boqr4Jjaa	I know what I'm talking about. As a music teacher I guarantee your baby will not play piano or violins and will probably grow up to be a rock star. <br>  The only message you give your baby is that their parents are very boring people. There is no scientific evidence that sticking a speaker on your belly and playing music will create some musical genius. It's to bad the little think can't ask for requests. I think if he/she could it would be,"HOW ABOUT KEEPING IT DOWN UP THERE!!!
fb7cf9f135155789f589f25b5c08b6c6aa	That's a good question. I dunno...I think parents out there need to stop avoiding the "protection/ birth control" conversation and talk to their kids as early as possible. Kids are gonna have sex if they want too so at least make sure they're on birthcontrol. You can't be with them every moment to watch what they're are doin.|`|OT6vCUU1aa	My heart breaks for women in this situation... I am 9 weeks pregnant and only 23. I've been with my fiance for 3 years and were great but my aunt who is 35 has been trying to conceive with her hubby for years and it hasn't been successful :-( It actually made me not want to tell her my news. Its so sad. She did get pregnant last year but there was complications early on and the baby didn't make it. Its a shame when the people who aren't even trying can get it done sooner then people who are trying desperately. My pregnancy was unplanned.|`|fEKCRmv8aa	Evolution is going backwards.  It's horrible. I'm 29 and don't have any children, and I'm starting to get worried because it seems like every few years they move the peak child bearing age lower..

What answer are you looking for exactly?! nobody will be able to answer this question. Cuz there is no answer. Stop asking stupid questions :)|`|JmXr1agRaa	Most people who are trying to get pregnant are usually stressed out about it and that causes things to go a little weird in the body making it more difficult to have children. When you're not really worried about becoming pregnant (like teenagers) it happens. I know my parents were trying to get pregnant for a while, and then when they stopped trying and just had sex for the sex, my mom got pregnant with me.|`|i8Ch743Laa	It's just how it works out sometimes.

c73QkZ2haa	I didnt even know about this till i read your question but...<br>  They have ongoing studies from what i read. They have also linked it to causing colic in breastfed babies whose mothers eat dairy as well as to a decrease in breastmilk for women who eat dairy while breastfeeding due to the hormones in it inhibiting the prodution of dairy. As well as cows are given antibiotics on a daily basis due to constant infections in their udders from continuos milking. The just of it seems to be that Cows milk is for cows not people. As well as an increase in type1 diabetes.|`|010e45dc0e6346ff817fa3cf9c7d3649aa	I honestly find all this scaremogering extraordinary!  If you look hard enough you can fing statistics to prove anything.

But really go by what you think if you listened to every bit of 'advice' you would never do anything!|`|a20KcBqdaa	well i dont know about the adhd, but cows milk has way too little iron in it for children under twelve months. the best thing is breast milk, if not then one of those special milks for babies, like SMA.|`|J6LKqBqMaa	I just breast feed for the first year that saves me a lot of worries.|`|tecPZUq2aa	Well It Would Cause You Baby A Lot Of Tummy Pains And Does Not Have All The Vitamins In.<br>  <br>  Your Best Of With Sticking To Breast Milk Or Baby Formula Like SMA Or Cow And Gate Until They Are 18 Month-2 Years Old.<br>  <br>  And As For Cooking With Cows Milk, I Don't See A Problem With It.

Jo2DfRzaaa	well this is what i did to my sis (i was the oldest so) well i had given her something that i didn't want anymore.  well watching her w/it, i wanted it back.  so i told her she had to give it back to me because something is only yours if you have it for a year. since she didn't have it for a year it wasn't really hers.<br>  i also made her feed one of her electronic animals raisins because i said it was hungry.  i just wanted to see what would happen.  she got in trouble for almost breaking him.<br>  i was a good big sis, huh?|`|f66ce5d864eadcad29348fd4a9871771aa	omg smile, i cant top that one lol....but me and my sister are 7 years apart, one day she was in my room aggravating me to no end as usual. i told her to go find mom and leave me be, id have been about 9, she was 2 and in panties. she said, well, if you dont leave me alone ill just poop in your floor. of course i told her, you better not, she commenced to pull down her panties and pooped a little turd right there on the bedroom floor, needless to say mom wasnt happy lol  i still tease her about it, lol|`|RoTLnFGZaa	the earliest i can remember being TERRORIZED by my little sister was when she was three and i was five.<br>  <br>  we raced & i beat her  so she was mad.<br>  i laughed in her face and she proceeded to pull up my shirt and bite my back until it bled.<br>  hahahaha.<br>  <br>  around the same age, i pushed my sister in the bath tub & messed up her chin. she had to get stitches.<br>  <br>  wow.|`|723QHuicaa	she showed me where the ''chocolate'' was.

We brought some strawberries from the market in France, which she asked for of course, and we got home and sat down at the table with my daughter. I got out the icing sugar to sprinkle over them, and she laughed at us and said "you're meant to use flour". She made a big deal about how that's what they did at restraunts, and how we were being silly. We eventually agreed that perhaps it was just different between our birth countries, and me and my daughter had our icing sugared strawberries, and she had her floured ones. A little later her dad got home, and she told them what we'd done, and he told her, "No ____, you're meant to put icing sugar on them". Have never let her live it down since.|`|OT8TMTOHaa	When I was about seven and my sister must have only been about 3 or 4 we had a fight over chopped pineapple.<br>  I wanted to eat some more of said pineapple and also feed it to my other sister who was outside in her pushchair. My mum was getting ready upstairs and she told my little sister not to let me have any more pineapple. So I tried to take another piece and next think I know I am lying flat on my back on the kitchen floor and with remarkable strength my little sister is dragging me around the floor by my hair! This lasted for about 5 minutes all the while I was simultaneously screaming in pain and laughing. We still giggle over it today.|`|f3SyOyMEaa	Mace in the face! OUCH!<br>  There are so many mean things that my sister did to me. She was 6 1/2 yrs. older and she was horrible!  But one thing that I remember that she still thinks is funny is that she told me to smell the vanilla extract, because you know, it smells great. Then she said that she would let me have a tablespoon of it. She gave me one...I had no idea that it doesn't taste as good as it smells when it's not in a recipe. I threw up all over the kitchen floor. She's such a wench and hasn't changed a bit ;)|`|1tmX7xbRaa	my brother is 5 years older then me so needless to say he was always jealous of me. one time my dad was rocking me to sleep (i was about 4 or 5) and my brother came into the room and pulled me off of my dads lap by his leg! i will never forget it and i will never let my brother forget what a jealous little brat he was!|`|um29wkUPaa	Ohhhh.... way back when... Coca cola used to come in bottles.  We were NOT allowed to have soda - next to never.  There came an age when we were allowed to be home without a sitter for an hour while she went shopping.  Big girls!<br>  <br>  We immediately dove into the coke.  We quickly learned that if you drink a lot of coke and jump up and down you can burp REALLY loud.  We did this over and over.  We screamed laughing.<br>  <br>  After a while we didn't feel so good.  All that coke and laughing and jumping gave us stomachaches.  We sill wanted to laugh, but we couldn't jump anymore.  <br>  <br>  My sister had the brilliant idea that, since what is making us burp is the jumpy coke, we'll just trick the coke.  We'll shake it up BEFORE we drink it. Then it'll be all mixed up already and all we have to do is drink it - we'll immediately burp.  Ingenious!<br>  <br>  We shook the first bottle.  Hard.  We wanted to burp REALLY loud.  We cracked the lid and..... **KABLAM!**  No corner of the kitchen was unscathed.  Coke everywhere.  No diet coke back then.  Sticky, sugary coca cola.<br>  <br>  We scrubbed and scrubbed.  We got in a ton of trouble.  She blamed me.  Said she tried to talk me out of it.  Had babysitters for 3 more years.|`|sBHhnDwaaa	Hehe I gave my sister a black eye...<br>  <br>  TinTin was on, and I wanted to watch but she wouldn't shut up.

My older brother turned one on and made it "drive on my head" my hair got stuck in the rubber wheels and we ended up having to cut it out.

We had to hide behind pillows until the marker caps ran out.|`|1KIwM1uOaa	When we were in high school my brother and I were in the same class and we did most things together.  The night of our senior prom we double dated, when we were leaving the prom to go to one of the after prom parties he stepped on the back of my dress and literally ripped it off of me.  There I was in the middle of the parking lot with a long slip on and my dress on the ground.<br>  <br>  The same brother at my wedding had a few two many to drink and made a toast to the bride and groom and called my husband an old boyfriends name.<br>  <br>  Both of my brothers and sisters now love to tell my 16 year old daughter all the things I did in high school so she can ask why she got grounded when I did the same thing.<br>  <br>  I hate being the baby!|`|03n14OLLaa	My sister just tells on me a lot and i get in trouble even though i'm an adult! However when we were younger, she stuck her hands in horrible smelling stuff and told me to smell it that her hands smelled good. Gross!

I don't think she can drink apple juice to this day.<br>  <br>  I swear that was the worse thing I did.. or maybe it's all I can think of. LOL<br>  We're best friends now.

ANd how stupid my nose lookeD!<br>  And when we get to the clinic he just looks at me and says, well I cant fix that you need SURGERY! I wanted to die!<br>  The friggin SLAP didnt even hurt~!<br>  So i had to get surgery where the Dr jsut went up my nostril and lifted the bone back up and I woke up with two freakin tampons stuck up my nose that had to stay there for a week!!!!!!!!<br>  ANd I got a major black eye!<br>  <br>  <br>  And my other brother who is a year younger than that one, when he was about 6 and I was probably 12, he decided he was mad at me and poured BLEACH all over my laundry basket in the basement and ruined all my clothes!!!|`|sbeoF50gaa	Ok ok I'm sure someone is going to laugh at me, but when I was about 3 or 4 I was using the potty and my brother kept telling me to move, but I wouldn't for whatever reason either I was still using it or I didn't want to move just to make him mad. ANYWAY he says "I'll pee on you" and I still didn't move... and guess what, he peed on me!<br>  <br>  I stuck chocolate chips up my nose once (about 3 years old) and blamed him for it. when I was 14 I told my mom I did it and she said "Omg your brother got into SO much trouble for that!"<br>   <br>  OH and in highschool my brother was my "date" for homecoming cuz he was already out of school and really wanted to see his old friends. well I wanted to dance and he told me "NO" and went up to a kid who was really popular (how would he have known this) told the kid to dance with his little sister or he'd kick his ***, and so the kid danced with me! I don't remember what his name was but I remember telling him how sorry I was that my brother did this, and then this kids GF walked up yelling at him for dancing with me.

vOFdHvlvaa	Yea they do sound like names would be in a typical Oregon high school.  <br>  I love the name Skylar, it's one of my niece's names and one of my fav names, and Skylar-Rose is really cute.  I also really love Brielle, it's another of my fav girls names.  I also love Nathaniel, it's one of my baby bros names, his nickname is Nathan not Nate, but i think Nate works better for a high-schooler.

They are rarely given as names.<br>  *I would replace Skylar-Rose with Kaitlin and Brielle with Amanda.<br>  <br>  For the BOYS, I think they would be OK - but it seems that there is a large element of pop music here. Those names remind me instantly of Aaron Carter, Jesse McCartney, and Zac(hary) Efron.<br>  *There are lots of common American names such as David, Matt, Max, Seth, Chase, Rob, and Jason, which all sound a lot more American and cool.<br>  <br>  The TEACHERS fare well: Demetria is now a common name in the United States due to the influx of Hispanics and all that, but Link is rarely given as a first name - it is more often than not used merely as a stage name (Link Larkin?!).<br>  *I'd replace Link with Andrew.<br>  <br>  <br>  Hope I helped  :)|`|dXDLeHNZaa	Well, I live in Australia, but here goes.<br>  <br>  Common-<br>  Elle, Claire, Caleb, Zachary<br>  <br>  Uncommon-<br>  Skylar-Rose, Brielle, Carter-Jack, Nathaniel (Althought I LOVE that name) Link (Hahaha, legand of Zelda!) & Demetria.<br>  <br>  <br>  These names are a bit out there.

j2mRop0laa	Well, aside from food allergies I still think it's sort of a big deal.<br>  Let's say everyone is food allergy free. No child in our entire grade school this year has a food allergy. Incredible, huh? However, they still cannot share food. After talking to several of the parents and staff, I started to realize this little rule can not only stop a lot of virus and colds from spreading, but bullying as well. <br>  When kids are allowed to share food in preschool and kindy and 1st grade, they start to learn how to barter their lunches and then it can move on to bullying and manipulating lunches and lunch money. I've even seen question on this board,as a matter of fact, about children being bullied out of their lunches. One simple rule- no food sharing- could prevent that crap.<br>  I think it's a bad idea all around.|`|bebee00e4f3a4e5d156594de8d4a527eaa	Unless your child has an allergy,then yes you are. Kids share food,they play together,they are in the same room for good portion of the day. It's unrealistic to think you can prevent them from sharing germs,unless they wear a bio-hazard suit to school..<br>  I do however think your child should be taught not to share drinks,that can be dangerous as they can pass,meningitis,if one child was to have it.  Other than that,you're just going to have to make sure he takes his vitamins and has a healthy diet. At least you know you are doing your best to give his immune system it's best chance.|`|s6emVQleaa	I think kids are going to share and trade no matter what you do.  While I understand what you're saying about germs, at some point there isn't a lot you can do to control what they come in contact with and it's a good thing.  I just read another study lately that said it's good for kids to be exposed to things.  The lack of challenges to the immune system is one reason scientist think that allergies and asthma is on the rise.  There aren't that many bacteria/viruses that he could get that would cause any lasting damage- in fact the only one that comes to mind right off is pretty rare.  At the worst case scenario he might get a stomach ache.  You can ask him not to share if it really bother's you, but I think it's just a kid thing and not something to stress over.|`|QHpq3QpAaa	I understand what you are saying, but, yeah, my opinion is that you are overreacting. Remember when we were kids?  know I shared and traded my food all the time with other kids. It didn't hurt me,  we know alot more about safety these days...but hey, we survived and so will our kids.|`|58b352907ba2def5e2248c3df2e55128aa	I wouldn't really worry about it. I have a son, and I babysit a little girl...they pass their food back and forth because they are learning how to share. I figure since they both chew on the same toys that sharing food isn't bad.|`|wENdWT5kaa	You are WAY over reacting. What is the deal with sharing snacks? I dont' see it. As long as the child knows what he is allergic to and doesn't accept it, then let them share.|`|8j7FCEOraa	lol<br>  They are kids!~<br>  They dont care if its sanitary<br>  We provide snack, and we're lucky if the kids dont shuve both of their hands into the bowl|`|ed052b6f800dc43932558f491194a7b8aa	our children take snacks to SHARE so no i dont see the problem and im sure they wash their hands before eating any way  x x|`|AA12145826	Is your son's preschool like my daughter's was, where they actually do have a rule against sharing? I understand your concern, maybe remind your son that he shouldn't share his snack because he could get or give ucky germs and also let the teacher know your concerned so she can more carefully monitor snack time.<br>  <br>  Overreacting would be suing the school for exposing your child to germs, what you've mentioned is NOT overreacting.|`|nfzQkvqraa	You're reacting based on the fact that a) you are certified yourself so you know the rules and the reasons for those rules, and b)  because it was your son.<br>  <br>  I would very calmly tell the teacher(s) the next time you see them that you know it's not a really big deal, but you'd rather your son not swap snacks with other children.  Then they'll at least monitor what is happening with your child a little better.|`|oUcLSDZ6aa	As long as there some sort of rule in place so that people are aware of food allergies, I don't seen the harm in it. Once he's in grade school, there will be a lot more sharing going on. <br>  <br>  If your son doesn't have any food allergies, and you don't send him with foods that kids are commonly allergic to, I really wouldn't worry so much. As for the germs. Germs help build our immune systems.|`|hgPmwYAfaa	no you're not over reacting...you have a concern about food (germs) being shared at a day care center..which is against state regulations..i would ask if they allow this to happen and then i might even walk in and observe snack one day...a new worker could have just put them in the wrong lunch box...or he and a friend traded...which happens a lot in grade school...so you also have to talk to your child.....about your concern...another thing i would not over pack just a couple of his favorites and then you know he will hang on to them eat them and not give them away...or trade|`|wSKLLtryaa	I mean, I don't think it's really a big deal -- your son probably wanted some of those crackers.  Maybe buy him some if he really likes them? Or ask him what snack he really loves to that he won't want to share any of it. But, of course, as a parent, it is instinct to be over protective, and that's certainly okay :)|`|mO7FOXNYaa	*I didn't read any answers, so I apologize if I repeat anything*<br>  <br>  I think you are overreacting.<br>  <br>  When you were in school - didn't you share snacks at school?<br>  I personally think that this isn't a big deal. Actually, don't you think it's great that your son has friends that share as opposed to being selfish?<br>  <br>  Also, I know my son's school has a strict peanut rule - NONE! haha. Plus the teachers keep a record of other food allergies, sends it to the parents, and expects the parents not to bring those foods to school.  <br>  <br>  Does your son's school do that? If so, then I don't think there is anything to worry about. There is no chance of setting off an allergic reaction - and if there were germs, I'm sure it won't be horrible. Kids need to be exposed to germs - build their immune system. <br>  <br>  If it still really bothers you, just tell your son that he isn't to share snacks anymore (even if it hurts some of the others kid's feelings).|`|oIyXMnmcaa	I am a clean freak so germs drive me nuts and this year Jasper started SK and has not been well since. Seriously...I sanitize and disinfect and wash wash wash but no matter what I do he always comes home sick or gets sick on the days in between. I know its the germs from his school travelling between students--there is not much teachers can do about that except clean their classrooms well and even then germs still linger on the books in the library and the toys or the blocks. Its inevitable(I mean unless everyone started using Lysol--which would be very smart.).<br>  <br>  There are ways to eliminate germs being passed though and sharing snacks is one way children will pass germs to each other. I don't think your overreacting at all. Children should eat their own lunch provided and there should be no sharing. I agree with you. I know the kids wash their hands before eating but once eating they have their hands back in their mouths and I am sure the teachers don't make them go and wash their hands in between bites. lol<br>  I am not sure what you could do about this...I would call his teacher and just share your concerns about these *unknown crackers...you don't want your child taking other children's food--maybe she can keep an extra eye at snack time and make sure there are no trades.<br>  <br>  People are so lax about germs these days...man! They are everywhere (even on plastic wrappers--cause the child's hand will come in contact with that wrapper and then pass the wrapper to another child; this is where the sharing/germs comes in)|`|3WWHWsHOaa	I think you are overreacting. Kids share their lunches. Some kids trade everything for pudding cups. Some trade crackers or chips. Be happy it was just crackers and not candy. In our area all kids are taken to wash their hands before lunch and snack. And all food must be prepackaged so germs and such are not a huge issue.|`|t1fx6kXcaa	Most people are going to say that you are overreacting but, although I know it's normal and healthy for children to share their food, I don't want my son to eat other children's food at preschool. Also, these days, being more aware of allergies and knowing that children may be allergic to nuts, gluten etc, I actually thought that preschools and schools would be doing more to enforce a "no-share" policy which a lot schools are doing where I live. The only reason I don't want my son to eat other children's foods at preschool is because I don't want him eating snack foods such as crisps and other foods high in salt such as crackers. I don't want him eating junk food and I go to an awful lot of effort to ensure he's eating a well-balanced nutritious diet so I'd prefer that he eat his own lunch rather than swap it for something less nutritious. Also there is the problem with hygiene and food poisoning. You don't know how many hands have handled other children's foods or if it was prepared in a sanitary manner or how long the food has been left out of the fridge for etc. The largest age group for children to contract food poisoning such as salmonella is in the 4-9 year old age group.<br>  If I were you, I'd just talk to my child and ask him to eat his own food and not other childre's but have him bring some food of his own that he can share (such as fruit pieces). Or if it's something that really worries you, talk to the preschool teachers.|`|pjYn6PbCaa	There is something magic about goodies prepared by mom but even greater than that is the ability to acquire something through barter or trade that you otherwise don't have.  Don't mess with it mom unless your child has a food allergy.  If not then you will begin the long road of becoming a control freak and that is damage extraordinaire..|`|930a625eb301aae633a9b9d8e18e0752aa	Didn't you trade your lunch when you were little?<br>  We all did. <br>  You're overreacting.<br>  My kids trade too. Think of it as a way for him to get to try different foods he may not have been able to. <br>  It's how I was introduced to many ethnic foods.|`|8zV90Lpoaa	Don't do anything. Sharing food with someone when your little shows you car and like the person, and that you think they are a good enough friend to share food with them.|`|9mBSkTldaa	Overreacting a bit. When they get into junior high they start taking bites of their friends food and sharing beverages out of the same can or straw. I'd be more concerned if he said a stranger gave him the crackers.|`|b11d4406389c926e8457572221d6ce48aa	I think you're way overreacting. Kids should be encouraged to share and share alike. A few germs would even beef up his resistance. If he doesn't have an allergy, don't make a fuss about it.|`|ZVSZZ6qHaa	Get a hold of yourself and worry about something more important.  These are the things you girls do that drive us guys crazy.|`|0e0a0f1828f99f87ea3d5e5bc8cbd46daa	It's very normal for children to share their food, just as they would share their toys! Yes, you are overreacting.|`|ULGd9uXvaa	You are over reacting. And no it shouldn't be up to the teacher to make sure they dont UNLESS you have brought it to the teachers attention that your son has an allergy. <br>  <br>  <br>  ?cuter than Hugs&Tugs? - Do you know why your son is getting sick all the time now? It's because you sanitize everything in his home. you don't expose him to any kind of germs making his immune system week. They need to be around germs in order to build up their immune system so they won't get sick all the time.|`|VAMsP3nlaa	I think you definetly have a right to be concerned. People should not be so relaxed wih sharing food not only because of germs but even allegies as well. If your child comes home with an allergic reaction all you would be aware of what he ate was what you sent, leaving you clueless to what really could have caused the reaction. I know that may be worse case situation, but as a parent you have the right to stand up for your child. Also, you don't know what the homes of those other children look like or how sanitary it is OR if the food is even outdated. I would bring it up with someone at the preschool just to express your concern. Personally, better to be safe than sorry...But I worry about this stuff too and I only have a 2 month old!|`|8d9219ccd2ad58a22a44c4a8dc45cb48aa	yeah, you are overreacting! haha.<br>  <br>  you probably wouldn't be as alive as you are today if your freinds didn't give you food along the journey of life. also, kids have to be exposed to germs and such, otherwise, how will their immune systems ever develope?<br>  <br>  you will really be worried in a few years when he comes home with drugs in his pockets!|`|xGmhDTWwaa	It sounds like you're over-reacting to me. He's a child and you can't protect his every mood, all children do it, it's like eating a packet of crisps and sharing with friends, you all dip your hands in. <br>  <br>  The fact is, I expect so often many people have shared food/ drink with friends after someone has done something unclean (toilet, touching animals etc). It won't kill him and it's a natural thing, yes there probably will be bacteria and germs but they are everywhere, by mothering too much, he'll get confused and lose confidence. Don't single him out and let him be, he'll be fine! :o)|`|w9TzZCt8aa	its good that your worried that children are sharing food but it is teaching them to socialise and share allott better with children their own age. if you are really concerned tell the staff at the preschooll. my mum works at a preschool and they give the children to food either apiecee of fruit or a bicuit.|`|OXXE3T2Aaa	Whats wrong with sharing snacks u r supposed to be teaching ur child that it is good to share at this age do u want him to grow up being greedy no so yes u are overreacting. I doubt he will get sick just tell him if he sees that the cracker or whatever snack it is was on the floor dont eat it.|`|irLnPW4aaa	I think that you are WAY overreacting.    The only case in which I would think that you were not overreacting wou If|`|Xq2mcCilaa	i think you are overreacting|`|AA10881413	One thing you left out...were the crackers wrapped in a package? Were they loose in the lunchbox? Were they wrapped in aluminum foil or saran wrap? <br>  <br>  If they were indeed wrapped in their original packaging, I would not make that big of a deal out of it. My daughter is in the 5th grade and they always bring a snack to school and trade. We have pop tarts and 100 calorie snack packs at our house and her little friend has Oreo Cakesters and cracker packs at hers. If they want to trade, they will trade. It's not a big deal and I don't mind it as long as the original packaging is not opened and they aren't taking bites off one another.<br>  <br>  So yeah, if that is the case, I think you are overreacting. Is this maybe your first child?|`|JfwdDJxGaa	your over reacting.<br>  im not really bothered if they share snacks so long as they do eat something instead of giving all their food away. so long as they have something to eat it doesnt matter what it is really does it, and its not as if crackers are unhealthy.|`|ANHsv4ENaa	I completely understand where you are coming from but sharing snacks is one of the best parts of having them. Didn't you trade treats over the lunch table when you were in school? I would say if it bothers you tell him he shouldn't share/trade snacks anymore because you make his lunch for him not for other kids. They have their own lunch. But I wouldn't worry about it if he does, I don't think it's a big enough thing to really be concerned about. The germs those kids share through picking their noses and not washing their hands, or sneezing around each other are probably worse.|`|60b853fe7d4335e1b74668b328b358b7aa	I think you are overreacting, Carrie.  : )<br>  <br>  Every once in a while I'll let Aidan indulge in a bag of donut holes for breakfast/ snack.  He always shares w/ his friends.  I never thought anything negative of it, only good.  <br>  I can't speak for all day cares/ preschools but his is VERY careful about allergies.  One child in the entire center has a peanut allergy so absolutely NO peanut butter in any shape or form is allowed anywhere in any of the buildings.|`|AA11210211	I think you are overreacting,children share germs with each other all the time without sharing food,when they hug each other,when they share toys,when they touch each other.I see nothing wrong with it as long as they don't take a bite off of it then offer it to another child.Children share stuff all the time so why should food be any different from a toy??They are still going to pass germs.|`|VwMkiLFPaa	I think you have a right to your opinion and I can understand the mini concern, but I wouldn’t be overly concerned. <br>  <br>  At my son’s daycare, all the kids sit together at one big picnic table (when they eat outside) and they’re all right next to each other. It’s very easy for the teacher to be sitting/helping one child while the one behind her steals a cracker or cookie. It could happen to any parent for that matter. I don’t think I’d be worried about germs more than I would if my child COULD have an allergy to that certain snack. But typically at our daycare, they don’t allow certain foods in the room if children are allergic. <br>  <br>  Worst case, if it really bothers you, you could just send a quick email or speak with the teacher briefly and just give a heads up. Or you can wait and see if it happens again. <br>  <br>  At my son’s daycare, they throw away all unused food. Dylan’s lunchbox is empty except for his ice pack. That way there’s no concerns!|`|cAtWxJG1aa	i didn't read all the answers, and i'm sorry if i'm repeating, but it's a very big deal.  some kids have life threatening food allergies.  preschoolers can't possibly know the fine print of the food label or how the food was prepared to be able to know what they can safely eat and what they can't.   preschoolers should not be sharing snacks unless their parent says it's okay, period.  i'd take it up with the preschool teacher and director.  as a parent of two kids with life-threatening allergies, i would be taking them out of the preschool if it happened more than once.  i know it's not such a big deal if your child doesn't have allergies, but odds are some kid in the class does.<br>  <br>  <br>  *thumbs down away, people.  my kid can die from your kid's cookie.  how about you let your kids eat what's safe for them and i (and my preschool) keep my kid safe, too.|`|M6c0hUefaa	When I was in school my friends and I shared everything from our lunch to our drinks. Yes, it may not be the most sanitary thing, but I don't think you should worry yourself over it. He's a kid and obviously he's willing to share and others are willing to share with him, so nah, it's nothing major.
AkFag8tNaa	Not every asthmatic/allergenic child displays their symptoms w/that type of breathing.......the next time it happens, look at his stomach/chest (if they move in and out in a strange way, it's called abdominal pulling and it's a symptom). That's what my son does (he doesn't typically "wheeze". It does sound very much like allergen induced asthma. Does he ever get that way from other things (cold air, running)? Cough and runny nose are par for the course for most allergic/asthmatic kids and you will get a lot of reassurance once you getting the testing done and on a regimen. Good luck, I know it's scary!|`|XPnCeJ29aa	ASthma is specifically breathing problems.<br>  Ive witnessed many attacks, and the person can not breathe!<br>  As in they really can't breathe and are scared for their life.<br>  <br>  <br>  Now a person with asthma has many other symptoms such as weezing, chest caving, cough...<br>  <br>  Alot of people with asthma get worse out in the cold cold weather..of course if they are doing physical activity which increases their breathing, and dust and such things can trigger other peoples.<br>  Most people with asthma, after getting it diagnosed can control it just fine and do not have many or any attacks.<br>  They would be instructed to use their pump twice a day, or like my brother use Advair, or like Brody use a nebulizer.<br>  There are specific triggers for different people with asthma.|`|lfMJPZ67aa	He could have sinus problems and be allergic to any thing from a tree to flowers or grass. Pets can bring on an allergic reaction too. My son is allergic to wattle from the trees and shell fish. It is always good to have some thing in the house with an antihistamine in it. Ask your doctor or chemist which is the best for your sons age group. It may not even be asthma.|`|dDVAUA9saa	My daughter was diagnosed with asthma at 15 months after 5 months of hell.  When she was 10 months old, she developed a chronic cough that landed us in emerg or at a clinic weekly.  She was diagnosed with RSV, bronchiolitis, croupe, etc.  We were finally referred to a pediatrician.  She was coughing to the point of not being able to eat or sleep and she would vomit from coughing so much.  She ate baby food until over a year because she would choke on anything else.  The pediatrician ran a number of tests including testing for immunodeficiency illnesses and cystic fibrosis, and did a multitude of x-rays.  Everything came back normal so the pediatrician then continued to insist it was "just a virus".  We questioned him about asthma as I have asthma and was severely asthmatic as a child.  He said no.  After a couple of months of this - and being in his office weekly - we demanded a referral to a different pediatrician who diagnosed her with asthma and treated her with flovent (steroid inhaler).  She was 100% better within one month.  Then came the ear infections.  In a 6 month period she had a about 6 or 7 ear infections, which are also a symptom of asthma.  She had tubes put in at 18 months of age, and is now 22 months and has one infection since.<br>  <br>  I don't know how old your son is, but the symptoms of babies and very young children are different than the symptoms of older children.  My daughter didn't sneeze any more than normal, and didn't seem to have much trouble breathing, but her breathing was VERY raspy especially after eating.<br>  <br>  Good luck.  The allergist will help you alot.|`|2jEHfuonaa	My son always had worse attacks when he was sick with a cold or flu. He would get much worse attacks around this time.<br>  <br>  When he got an attack he would slow down, breathing became very difficult, he would cough a lot and his nose often became snuffly. Sometimes his eyes watered up but that was rare. Occasionally he would vomit after an attack, but that was very rare and usually only when he was ill.<br>  <br>  My son is also allergic to cats/farm animals and the allergic reaction he has to these can sometimes trigger an asthma attack. Does his grandmothr have any pets? We have a cat but he grew up with her and he isn't allergic but when he goes to friends houses with cats he always comes back with roar eyes and a chesty cough.<br>  <br>  Also, if your son is ever having a bad attack and his inhaler isn't close by put him in a steamy shower. Make him take BIG deep breaths of the steam. My son was swimming when he had an attack. We had forgotten to take his inhaler so the lifeguard put him in the shower and filled the room with steam. It stabilized his breathing and gave me enough time to run home and get it.|`|TQW5E6olaa	During an asthma attack Bella breathing's becomes shallow (fast), I can see the skin at her neck and ribs sucking in (retracting), her nostrils flare. She'll also start wheezing. She can't sleep more than an hour or so with a really bad attack.<br>  <br>  Specifically for us, her triggers are cigarette smoke, illness, and cold air. Within 6-12 hours after contact with a trigger she starts coughing, then the mucus starts, and her breathing gets faster. At this point she can still function normally, So we just stat Albuterol treatments. Occasionally they wont work and she'll start retracting and wheezing at which point we have to go to the ER.<br>  <br>  When he goes to the allergist or pulmonary specialist they'll suggest allergy testing. We did the skin test and blood tests for everything under the sun, all came back negative, yet she had pretty severe asthma before we started twice daily meds, now it's moderate. Since asthma is basically an allergic reaction to a trigger, they'll ask if you or hubby have asthma, if he's had eczema, If  he has chronic runny nose/etc, etc. Having more of these factors help them figure out the diagnoses. <br>  <br>  They most likely wont say he has asthma until after several breathing "issues". They refused to diagnose my daughter with asthma until after several er visits, 1 hospital stay and an PICU stay.<br>  <br>  Good Luck!|`|723QHuicaa	My sister has Asthma, and has done since she was a small child. She cannot be around long haired animals. When she done she has allergy, flu like syptoms. sore, red eyes, runny nose, headache. But this is in reaction to the allergen, and not an actual Asthma attack. When she has an attack, she gets pains or tightness in her chest, she wheezes and has difficulty breathing.

WPI0Z47saa	No, milk is often donated from other mothers and wet nurses especially in children who are sick or premature at birth whose mothers can't produce enough milk. They have no more risk or getting sick than f the natural mother does it. The only thing that can make them sick is if the nursing mother had been taking medications that are not safe in breast milk or sometimes it depends on what you eat. When my son was breastfeed I couldn't eat certain foods like garlic, broccoli and chocolate since these all gave him problems. My mother in law and her sister often breast fed each others babies when they had to watch them if the other wasn't home in time. Please don't listen to people that say this can make them sick because that is just ridiculous. I come from a family who everyone breastfeeds and 2 are breastfeeding counselors.|`|b978f631fc787a963337206aa3833370aa	It depends. If the baby is sensitive to something in the breast milk, then yes. If the mother has HIV/AIDS, yes. But otherwise is mom and baby are healthy, then no. Although the baby might refuse the breast simply because the mother's smell is not his own mother. A mom I know said that one time at their playgroup they switched babies to see if the child would know the difference, and it didn't. While I wouldn't necessarily do this, there is nothing wrong with nursing someone else's baby as long as you are healthy.|`|93e5e66462cba8bcd411219422deababaa	no they can't- we drink milk from another species of an animal so surely they won't get sick from drinking milk from another woman. it's actually preffered over formula to the WHO. people use tohave wet nurses all the time when a woman could not nurse their child another woman would. only if the woman had something like HIV or was on serious drugs or something|`|vue9NOhYaa	Only if the women nursing the baby is infected with an illness that can be transmitted through the milk. (i.e., HIV or HepB), or is engaging in lifestyle choices that can harm the milk (i.e., using cocaine).  <br>  <br>  Of course, if the biological mother is infected or doing hard drugs, the same risks apply.|`|yXx1nB0Qaa	not if the woman is in good health... wet nursing was common practise once upon a time not all that long ago, before aids etc, were women with a healthy supply of milk would feed several babies and there were even breast milk banks were extra milk was shared.|`|471ca0c8552c4633e525815ba702310aaa	Only if the woman has an illness that baby hasn't been exposed to.|`|mjz8JF9Gaa	i guess so|`|c3eb9cc5af710aa695ddf32e0b5e463aaa	A baby can _ONLY_ get sick from drinking the milk of a woman who is not its mother if the mother is sick with a disease communicable through breast milk (like hepatitis) or if she is taking medication or drugs that are passed on through breast milk. <br>  <br>  Many hospitals have breast milk banks that are used to provide breast milk to sick and premature babies. Mothers who are nursing pump extra milk to donate to these banks, so these fragile babies are -often- given breast milk that is not from their own mothers... and they're given it because babies with fragile systems do better on human breast milk than on formula, regardless of the source of the milk.|`|v0596BTeaa	No.  When I had my daughter I was in hospital for 5 days and was pumping breastmilk because my boobs were engorged.  The milk was excess to requirements for my baby, and I did not want to confuse her by giving her a bottle, so it was donated to the Special Care Baby Unit, for the premature babies.  In olden days women used to employ wet nurses to nurse their babies as upper class women felt that to do it themselves would be unnatural and demeaning, so, no it does not make a baby ill to suckle from a woman who is not his mother.  However, there are some doctors who believe illnesses can be passed on via breast milk, so if an ill woman nursed a baby - her own or another woman's, the the baby could also become sick.|`|YKCIubvKaa	It actually depends on what the woman is doing. If the woman breast feeding is a smoker, drinker, or just not eating properly than there is a chance the baby can get sick. But that can be said for the biological mother as well. There have been numerous stories of mothers breastfeeding babies that are not theirs biologically for one reason or another. The babies all were just fine. Again it is not depending on who does it but the health of the one giving the breast feeding.|`|a8Pq2Lmdaa	There was a trend a few years back when women would breast-feed others babies and have other women breast-feed their kids because it built up antibodies that the mother may not have.  Different bodies, different antibodies.  The kids built resistance to other germs.  This was done amongst family members or close friends.|`|I6vMxEU9aa	Of course, but not because the baby and other woman don't share the biological bond. It would more likely be because the other woman was taking medication or something else that can be passed along in her breastmilk.|`|OBuzcIDbaa	Not that I've ever heard of. Back in the old days, rich women always hired a wet nurse to nurse their babies as they were too good to do it. Those babies did just fine.|`|ehvzQRkkaa	I have NEVER heard that!<br>  We drink from cows that aren't our mothers!|`|VJ2aG6znaa	WTF!!!!  Only if there is some major illness like aids, hiv or hepatitis i suppose.  What do you think a wet nurse is?

RkNIs0rSaa	I am so sorry that you are so overwhelmed.  You sound like you need to develop a bigger and improved support group.  Time to call in the favors with your children's friends for some play days...  and join a nice yoga group.  Their is nothing wrong with spending some time on yourself.  Plus, with the loss of your mother... you are grieving.. and that takes time if you don't allow yourself to grieve then it last longer and is bad on your mental health.  As for the X, it's time to set some rules...  men need structure just like children and it isn't your job to worry about anyone else but you and your children.  Next time he does that... say no and shut the door.  He's a big boy, he needs to figure it out on his own what to do or at least make his brother take on the responsibilities of not keeping his pants on.  As for the children, start holding them accountable...each age group is able to help You around the house... you just have to find what motivates them.  Talk to a counselor (insurance should pay for it) and get them on a fixed schedule.  Good luck to you and sorry about the super long answer!  KEEP THAT CHIN UP!!!|`|n3IoftMFaa	Hey, Momma. I am sorry you are going through such a bad time. Yes, lack of sleep makes everyone feel tired and overwhelmed. Can I ask why it is you don't want medication? Have you had a bad experience with it?|`|UghJ0XROaa	They have a medicine for babies called colic calm that you can look into, the colic can't be helping matters any. You need to tell you are not up watching other kids right now, you are exhausted and he needs to respect that. Just work on getting extra sleep and napping with the baby as much as possible to try to feel rested.
AA11148769	If money was not an issue, my husband and I would have four kids.  I wouldn't have any help from a nanny or anything, because I love raising and taking care of my kids myself.  <br>  Right now, my husband and I have two kids, ages 3 and 1.  He's in the military, so he's gone a lot, sometimes for months or a year at a time.  Sometimes I think that the extra help would be nice, just someone to watch the kids for an hour or two every other day so I could go run (I loooove running) but, that's not an option as we don't make a lot of money (military pay - nooooot much lol), so I just do the best I can by myself.  Wouldn't it be nice though to be able to have a babysitter 2 or three times a week for like an hour or two to be able to go to the gym?  haha!  Not happenin', but it'd be nice!  :)|`|5O4Lne7Haa	i want 4 or 5!!<br>  <br>  if money was no object then i would have 6 or 7 no nanny but a babysitter 3 or 4 times a week so i could get my toes done (which is i dont get to do anymore in real life) or have a girls night or to go out with my hubby!! or better yet i would have some one to do all my grocery shopping!!!:)|`|ofL82H2Taa	I have 3(5,4,7months) but i think were about done maybe one more. If money wasnt a option i would have at least 6 or 7. I love children but money and cost are so high its hard. And i would raise them of course with the help of the father.|`|q72aXjKiaa	Cecil Jacobson had 75 children of record. He claimed over 100. Nice Mormon.|`|60b853fe7d4335e1b74668b328b358b7aa	3<br>  <br>  I grew up in a family with 3 children, as did my husband.  We both feel like it's the perfect number.  (We have 2 and are undecided on a third.)<br>  Oh, and no nanny.  What would be the fun in that?!.... Although I would like a maid to take care of the cleaning (lol).|`|cAtWxJG1aa	if money wasn't an option, i probably shouldn't have any, lol.  but if, as i think you meant, money was no obstacle, i'd have four, just as i do now.  at some point, time becomes as important a consideration as money.|`|f66ce5d864eadcad29348fd4a9871771aa	i would still just have 2, i dont think i could manage more lol. i would definitely raise them myself, thats why i wouldnt want  more, i dont want to be overwhelmed and not do ANY of them any good, and i dont want to have to hire help to raise my own children, im not saying theres anything wrong with it, but its not for me. i want my kids to have my and my husbands values, thats half the point of having them, and if someone else is raising them, theirs are bound to rub off.|`|SnQvsOPwaa	The same two I have.|`|AjqO1aJgaa	Two. It's not a question of money, it's a question of time. If you have more than two, you always run the risk that the third one will one day desperately want to do something that you'll have to say no to, simply because two parents can only be two places.|`|Jo2DfRzaaa	I'd want one more for a total of 3.  its how i grew up and i loved it.  3 was perfect - always had a tie breaker when we had to vote on things, always someone to play with or gang up on.  i would like 3.<br>  no nanny.  just mommy and daddy.|`|5p7gpj36aa	at least 4 -- maybe 6  I love having lots of kids around - and I only have one!|`|RoTLnFGZaa	if i was rich,<br>  i may have help sometimes. but not all of the time- i'd want to be a big part of my own child's life.<br>  but even if money was no object, i'd only want one kid. two if the first one was REALLY quiet. haha.|`|DcVoq5Tuaa	I have 4 and I raise them myself. Single mother, there is no way I would ever let anyone else raise my kids. Why have kids if you aren't going to raise them yourself.|`|gf7XoXD0aa	Big family is fun.<br>  <br>  For me, I would say 3 to 4 kids.<br>  The more the merrier, family get together.<br>  Nanny will be a big help.|`|a8IRxC4raa	One, which is what we have now.<br>  <br>  We would not have a nanny, but I might appreciate help with the housework.<br>  <br>  All the best.|`|1G3XPiq3aa	One. I got it right the first time. =) And I'd still raise her myself.|`|hNa5oHxQaa	Just one.<br>  I'd raise her myself.|`|89FgPZ9Waa	2<br>  i would raise them myself and watched my children grown up.|`|w9TzZCt8aa	i would have two<br>  i would love twins|`|LpWILFI2aa	personally i would and hope to have 2-4 children really and raise them myself but everyone is different if you enjoy kids and would be a good parent then go nuts, lol :) but if your going to  just brush them off to a nanny and have close to nothing to do with them then please don't never bring children up that way its just neglecting them as your kids. if you want them you celebrate life with them.|`|WQ8P57o3aa	I only want two children...and that's what I got! I have an almost 3 year old daughter and am 3 months pregnant with my second baby daughter!<br>  After these two, I do not want any more, neither does my husband. We want to be able to devote all our love to our two little angels.<br>  My husband and I are both lawyers so we often get either our parents to come around for the day to look after our daughter, or take her to one of my stay at home mum friends, but not a nanny. I still have a very close relationship with my daughter, despite being busy. I always make sure I have plenty of quality time with her. During the weekdays though, she is at nursery.<br>  In about 4 months I will start my maternity leave so I will be home most the time whilst my husband is at work.|`|1KIwM1uOaa	When I was young I wanted a bunch of kids, now I am a mom and the 3 that have is plenty.  We could afford more now but the kids are so busy and we are busy with them that physically I do not think I could handle anymore.<br>  <br>  Nannies are fine if both parents work but when they are home they eed to be with their kids and not a paid employee spending all the time with them.|`|pUvEmPrCaa	If money was not an option I would want 6 children.  But I probably still will find a way to have 5 or 6 children when I do get married.<br>  <br>  I wouldn't get a nanny.  If money wasn't an option, I'd be able to be a full-time stay at home mom.  I wouldn't want someone else raising my kids.|`|z788YHPLaa	I have two already,but if money was no option i would have two more.<br>  I would not hire a nanny i would do it myself. If i had a lot of money i would just be a stay at home mama! Why hire other people to raise your children?|`|03n14OLLaa	Three! I grew up in a family of five (excluding parents) and my fiance grew up an only child. I want my kids to have people to play with and he wants to not go crazy ha ha. So three is best i think.|`|3CG3rby0aa	I have 3 with a 4th one on the way and that is where I am stopping.  No I would raise them myself as I am a stay at home mom.  I am not having kids for someone else to raise. :)|`|bc29eaf19302ac3e6d0492b8facf1027aa	I always want one more than I have, lol.  Of course I would raise them myself.  Why in the world would I have some one else raise my own children?|`|WnbaA1S0aa	I want one boy and one girl and I would raise them myself, the old fashioned way =) Just like me and my brother|`|rzLGCrlfaa	1 and i would raise him with out a nanny|`|ox45zrgCaa	I'd have 2. and yeah, I'd raise them myself.|`|BM3dDb88aa	I would adopt several.

mc6YtaRbaa	The rule in pregnancy is normal is what normal is for you. Everyone's normal is different. Some people don't ever have any symptoms, some people get everyone in the book. It's nothing to worry about, just enjoy it because just when you think you don't have any symptoms or you are having an easy time, it can change!|`|LJ2OqF1saa	everyone experiences different symptoms during pregnancy.  The teeth hurting is something I have not heard b4, you may want to talk to your dentist and make sure everything is fine there.  Drinking milk is great, but since you are wanting so much of it, you may want to consider 1 or 2 % milk instead of whole milk,  since whole milk has so much fat in it.....you need the calcium, and so does the baby.  Breast hurting, is normal....your body is adjusting.|`|mL07bInfaa	Congrats, sounds like all your symptoms are VERY normal!!  The teeth thing could be your gums hurting, the hormones can do weird things to your teeth and gums, same reason why your breasts are sore is because of hormones...the milk is a pregnancy craving, and the peeing all the time is definitely a symptom in the first and last trimester :o)  sounds normal girl!|`|x8JRkRNkaa	They may be normal symptoms for you. Since symptoms vary widly from woman to woman. But the teeth thing is very strange. I've never heard that one before and really doubt it's got anything to do with your pregnancy.|`|VyMIFe6Vaa	Yes very normal, i was the same way with milk. <br>  Its weird how our bodies do that isn't it. But don't worry i have 2 kids and you sound fine. Just ask your doctor if you get to concerned.|`|1JEDWyMHaa	Hello mommy, Keep drinking the milk, baby needs the calcium.|`|ad0F70IMaa	Don't forget, too much calcium is not a good thing. Your symptoms are fine. Normal. Just feel lucky that you don't have any more of the regular symptoms. Don't worry. You'll start to feel pregnant pretty soon.
BaXruEcqaa	I was getting A LOT of it a week before my AF was due.  I thought I was pregnant, AF was 4 days late....but it came.  So it could just be AF coming.<br>  <br>  edit:  Its terrible all this waiting.....now i'm waiting to ovulate again...then the 2ww...ahhh.  Its enought to drive a person crazy.  The thing is, all these symptoms are the same as pregnancy....so how are we supposed to know!|`|H9t63i4Kaa	Sounds  like AF is coming.|`|yea2hci5aa	I believe cm is a sign of both af and pregnancy.  I would wait until you've missed a period before you start worrying about whether or not you're pregnant.  Unless you're having other symtoms as well then you may want to get a hpt and take it the day you're expecting your af to show.<br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|CIPkzrFIaa	its normal, i get the white lotion on ovulation these days since starting clomid.  <br>  <br>  it could just be normal discharge which us ladies get at all stages of our cycles.
f66ce5d864eadcad29348fd4a9871771aa	my son was born on the first day of deer season (well its a holiday HERE lol) my daughter was born  jan 2 so, while were all recuperating from new years, were also having her b day party lol.....mine is Halloween and i love it, we always have a big costume/karaoke party  yay!  lol  i have an uncle that was born on april fools day too.|`|MxhNzW7Oaa	This year Riley's, my youngest, birthday falls on Thanksgiving, November 26th. I have a feeling this will happen alot in his life time.|`|b978f631fc787a963337206aa3833370aa	Sometimes. My daughter's birthday is on Labor Day this year, and sometimes my son's birthday is on Thanksgiving.|`|QveBSjFSaa	my son's birthday is on New Year's Eve, which makes an even better reason to light off fireworks!|`|oIyXMnmcaa	Well its not really a holiday--but for 3 whole days in July--always on my daughter's Birthday, is Elivis Festival here in Ontario. It drives me nuts cause you would think it is like as important as Christmas around here when Elvis *comes to town--one year it almost got cancelled and there was mass caos in the town of Collingwood cause Elvis fans got so upset. I have to schedule her party around Elvis each summer cause alot of the family has a thing with watching strangers imitate their favorite, *long been dead idol. I have got used to though, I figure I would rather schedule around this event rather than have a bunch of hungover family members celebrating her birthday.|`|AA11109728	Nope - she's a summer baby - unless there's a holiday in Aug. I don't know about?  LOL  The closest I get is my younger sister who was born a few days before Christmas.

q7HvkRpyaa	I'm glad I'm not the only one who had this problem. I went to the hospital (on the advise of my doctor) to get some really watery substance checked out since it had soaked through my clothes 3 times in a few hours. They did some tests and it wasn't urine nor was it my water breaking. They didn't know what it was. I felt really stupid. Lol. I mentioned it to a couple of my friends and they looked at me like I'd lost my mind. Nice to know I'm not alone on this one.|`|y6g0RnuAaa	My guess would be cervical fluid. The lining of the cervix can shed and it is very watery. This happened to me and I thought baby was just pushing on my bladder but doc said it was more likely discharge from my cervix. Just another thing to deal with...lol.|`|hIzQyflqaa	your waters could be leaking, put a pad on and if anymore comes out smell it, if its sweet its waters, have you had your show?|`|t4HXotwEaa	Yikes!  I'm gunna watch this one.  As if i didn't have enough to worry about!
ZZzQLjaKaa	Of course you should. Gift certificates for manis/pedis, starbucks, fresh flowers, candles, etc. would all make lovely gifts. Additionally since you work together, maybe even taking them to lunch and presenting them with a small gift and gracious thank you note would be nice. You are wise to be gracious! Have a great shower!|`|gBEq0zo5aa	Some girls from work threw me a shower- the next day I brought in the thank you notes for everyone and bagels and donuts for everyone I work with (I just put them in the lunch room with a print out that said- You are all so sweet thank you for the baby gifts! and I bought mini-rose plants for the 3 girls who planned it with a special thank you card (make sure you mention their gift and to also thank them for the shower!) and I put it on their desks before they got to work that day.|`|OT6vCUU1aa	You really don't have to do anything besides be grateful! I had done this for a colleague of mine and I didn't expect anything besides the normal thank you card :-) You can always go out to lunch with them and tell them how great it was of them or personalize a thank you note. Either way they did it because they wanted to and I am sure they wont be expecting anything. Have fun!|`|oUcLSDZ6aa	Absolutely get them something as a thank you. A gift basket of some sort would work, or if you know them a little more personally, then get them something small you know that they'll enjoy, even if it's just a card.|`|lwlZMhiqaa	You can get them a small gift, or maybe a bottle of wine they like (that's my usual gift).  Perhaps you could take them out to lunch one day.  Or, if money is an issue, you can write personalized thank you notes!|`|9aAO1J73aa	gift baskets r always nice|`|utfoP7GWaa	I usually get the host of any shower that is thrown for me a gift. It doesn't have to be much just something to say thankyou. (one of my fav ideas is personalized stationary. you can get it at places like staples and it's really cheap!)|`|ZncV5gc0aa	How about a spoon with the name of baby engraved on it?
AA12145826	I could wax nostalgia about how I'd love to bring back the innocents of the times and all the people I miss, but I'll stick to more tangible objects.<br>  <br>  1. Show her what real snow was and how to really enjoy it. When I was little we lived in northern Michigan. In the winters my friends and I would strap on our cross country skis and hit the trail/pathway that was about a 1/4 from our house, taking backpacks with food & drinks so we could spend the whole day skiing. Or we'd go down to the sledding hill (about 1/3 of a mile from the house) and sled for hour on end. And here's the thing, there were like 12 of us kids and NO ADULTS....totally unheard of these days.<br>  <br>  2. I'd take her to the old roller skating rink where I started skating....it was so circa-1980's, but it was only the 90's so we didn't care! They've turned it into a dance club now...so sad.<br>  <br>  3. I'd let her enjoy the Cherry Festival when it was 2 weeks long instead of just 8 days.<br>  <br>  4. Take her into downtown TC and go shopping at Penney's, Woolrich, and eat in Elias Bros. (aka Big Boy). Alas, those stores & restaurants are long gone. Replaced by brew pubs & touristy shops.<br>  <br>  Luckily most of the summer-y type places of my childhood are still around and I've been able to take her to them. We've done favorite childhood activities like picking wild strawberries on the grassy airstrip near the baseball fields, taking in a summer concert at Kresge Auditorium, picking wild blueberries in the bogs near Lake Dubonnet, swimming in crystal clear inland lakes (getting 'swimmers itch'....a childhood rite of passage), running up the Dune Climb at the Sleeping Bear National Lakeshore, canoeing all day long down the Lower Platte River and then going to Peterson Beach to have a bonfire cookout right on the sand (totally legal as long as you bury it afterwards), and taking in a double feature at The Cherry Bowl drive-in w/ its 60's style snack stand. I've been lucky enough to share a lot of these experiences with her and we plan have doing more this summer.|`|60b853fe7d4335e1b74668b328b358b7aa	You just brought back memories w/ the balls and jacks!<br>  <br>  I would bring back my grandmother.|`|SnQvsOPwaa	We use to be able to walk through the woods to ponds and lakes. Now everything is all built up around them and you can't just go fishing, swimming, or play hockey anymore.|`|wZAeBisbaa	Just the other day I was telling one of my kids how the carhops at A&W would bring frosty mugs of root beer out to our car and set them on a tray that hung over the window.  Dairy Queen did the same with ice cream cones.  Our whole family would sit in the car and enjoy a treat. My kids can't imagine this.  Not many places do that any more, and none around here.|`|a8IRxC4raa	My dad and brother. They died before my daughter was born.<br>  <br>  Farrell's for sure!  Wasn't that place fun!<br>  <br>  The orchards which have been replaced by buildings.<br>  <br>  Disneyland the way Walt Disney envisioned it.<br>  <br>  All the best.|`|Jo2DfRzaaa	just my aunt.  my daughter met her but will never remember her.  she would love my kids.  my son looks just like her dad (my grandfather) right now.  i miss her.|`|X0ubZnPjaa	-yo! MTV raps, if the show aired today i think my kids would love it.<br>  <br>  - when i was younger my grandma used to live close to a small chocolate factory and now and again we used to go to the back gates and the workers would give us free bars of chocolate in secret.<br>  <br>  <br>  also my grandma to show them what a great person she was.|`|rRQNDpwVaa	Proper snow.  We haven't had proper deep snow where we live for over 20 years, even with the recent snow that everyone else got we didn't get anything!<br>  <br>  I don't think I'd bring a person back, it'd be too painful to let them go again.|`|TQg7yubGaa	I would bring back my father for a day.  He passed away when I was 12, and more than anything I would love for him to meet my daughter
8VotkEXHaa	whats done is done.  I know it really sucks but the pictures are gone.  Why don't you explain to your mom that she should use the other computer since that one is yours.  However, I'm going to assume that she bought it for you so the least thing you can do is let her use it.  Your mom probably already knows how upset you are about what happened and you don't need to explain it to her over and over again.  Just try and prevent the same thing from happening in the future :)|`|AA11296427	Put an ID name and password on your computer and don't give her the details. It's your computer, tell her to use one of the *other computers.<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  :]|`|Plu6OVoGaa	Who paid for it? If it wasn't you then you can't be complaining!|`|zNFqe8Iiaa	No you are not overreacting.<br>  Tell her that you want time to spend onYOUR computer, she bought it for YOU! and she doesnt even let you use it and tell her how would she feel if suddenly you took control of something that was HERS and messed it up. but dont forget she is your mom. some people want you to tell her something rude and mean but try your best to not yell at her or be mean cuz she can still take the computer. And ask her to USE ANOTHER ONE!|`|P9S5wlLyaa	No. She bought it, it is hers. It is not yours. If you want one that is yours, get a job and pay for it yourself. Computers are expensive, internet is expensive. If you aren't paying for them, than they aren't yours.<br>  <br>  Use the school computer that you say no one uses if you need one, and stop being such an ungrateful little girl.|`|YehcUSkoaa	ummm....how old are you?  because if you are under 17, her house, her stuff.  doesn't matter who paid for it.  if you are 18 or over...GROW UP!  ITS A FRIGGIN COMPUTER! and your MOM is using it.  good god.  my mom has a computer, and she still doesn't know it that well.  Don't flip.  it just a picture.  its not then end of the world.|`|XwrjRj52aa	Wow, just wow. I didn't read all of that but "overing acting" is the most ridiculous thing I've heard in a while. It's overreacting dear.|`|8e5YBwd7aa	I know exactly how you feel,<br>  Tell Youre mom how you feel<br>  But she did buy it,also If shes using it for work ,<br>  There's no reason why you should be mad.<br>  If you talk to her I'm sure you 2 will come to a good agreement alright !<br>  If none of that works than try and get a job and save up for a new computer or Laptop So there isn't any disagreements !<br>  Hope  I helped <br>  Xo<br>  -Adrianna|`|AQmcmW6paa	You go up to her and say<br>  "Parents tell the kids to get a life and get off their computer, but since your not doing a very good job of doing so, get off MY computer and get a life!" <br>  I know that's kind of mean, but seriously, you have a problem if your mom is spending more time on the computer than you are!|`|ySKK7lCyaa	Tell your mom that it is YOUR laptop and that there are 4 other computers in the house to use one of them. Then take your Laptop with you were you need it and when you don' lock it up in you closet or something.

It's an honor you don't ASK for and are given.  It's not an honor if you make people feel they have to use it.  Geez.<br>  <br>  Lilianna (or Liliana) has a million times more class than Lilly-Anna.  Lilianna May looks better.  I hate Madison.|`|MW1yrHbOaa	yvonne is not cute, don't use that one, madison may doesn't sound right.<br>  Lilly Madison<br>  Madison Ann<br>  idk, it's hard to find a name that goes well with may as a middle name|`|bzkSIJYnaa	I think Lilly-Anna May is gorgeous!

c73QkZ2haa	I was under the impression that you  supposed to mix enough for the day in order to avoid mixups in measurements that can occur when mixing smaller amounts. <br>  <br>  Its easier to premix for the whole day than a bottle at a time ne ways.<br>  <br>  And yes it can be bad. My sister did hers bottle by bottle and the babies always had a sever diaper rash. Her doctor told her it was because she was giving him too much water and she was like what water? The only water he gets is from his formula. It can also cause baby not to get enough food which is sad cause the person isnt even doing it on purpose just not mixing things properly.|`|Z7V7AbBQaa	A lot of people don't see anything wrong with mixing odd amounts of powdered formula. I have answered question on here regarding it. I have told them how it's not accurate and can cause baby to get sick because the formula can be too weak or too concentrated and have gotten thumbs down.|`|723QHuicaa	If the formula I used required to be made up by 1 scoop per 2 oz of water, then I would certainly make up an even amount. Wrong measurements can cause tummy pains, sickness, diarohea (sp).<br>  <br>  Luckilt the formula I used (Aptamil) was 1 scoop per 1 oz - so it was pretty straight forward and not much room for mistakes to be made.|`|AjqO1aJgaa	I always just did my best guess. I expect it depends on how good you are at guessing. I'd have thought you'd get at least that much variance from the powder being more or less settled in the tin, to be honest.
JSeRWbHzaa	I agree i used to have a fairly bad lisp and i grew out of it. cumon if its not noticeable and the only person to pick up on it was a school nurse who is trained in this sort if stuff. Besides the benefits he would bring to her would be amazing for her. But do monitor his Speech just in case it goes down hill. If he gets worse or he says how he does not like how he lisps then take him to see someone out of school not the school nurse because getting taken out of lessons for his speech when he is older he will be embarrassed in front of his mates.|`|2274dcf5eba0ee2ef3aabbe2c8b0a89daa	no my little sister had speech therapy and it was amazing how well she improved when she was done. she is now 13 and still talks about how much it helped her and is happy she can speak clearly now.|`|1831ede9e27aa3948ecfe643b6ae8bfbaa	It isn't taking away any part of the personality.<br>  Your child may seem perfect to you but he may benefit in life from not having a lisp.  It could result in bullying, for example.<br>  What do you think your son would want you to do looking back, in 10 years time?<br>  <br>  Here's a paralell for you - my teeth aren't terrible, but they aren't perfectly straight either.  Several people in my life have asked me "why didn't your parents take you to an orthodonstist to get a brace when you were a child?"  The answer is, because my mother thought my teeth were fine & they did the job.<br>  <br>  I still don't like smiling & showing my teeth - maybe your son won't like public speaking or talking to others in general...it's a possibility.|`|oUcLSDZ6aa	I think it should be up to the kid. I mean if he notices it, and it bothers him, then absolutely he should be able to do something about it. If it doesn't bother him, then good for him!<br>  <br>  If he's too young to make this decision on his own, or to understand what the issue is, then I'd revisit the topic in a few years. I think that since it is such a slight thing, there would be no harm in waiting. <br>  <br>  However, if it were noticeable, and my child were getting teased and tormented about it, I would definitely take it into a much deeper consideration. <br>  <br>  Also something to keep in mind, is although it might not effect his ability to communicate in English (or whatever he is speaking at home), if he chooses to learn a second or third language, it could greatly effect his ability to clearly speak those languages.|`|PmWzhGP3aa	my son is 6 and has trouble prounoncing his S's, as in he says Dick, instead of stick, nake for Snake.  I am not worried, at all but im continually getting requests to take him to speech therapy, the appointments are always in school time, so i refuse to take him out, if i was really worried i would take him. I'm sure he'll grow out of it naturally.|`|2ec3c76fd8030a72563cfb9a02cf55e2aa	I had a lot of friends in school that were sent into "speech therapy" and it seemed to be more like an excuse to get out of class than anything else.  I'd leave it up to your child...if he/she is okay with the way they sound, no problem.  But in some cases speech impediments are cause for ridicule and might be better off to be "fixed" than let a child suffer.|`|8000008da995a7f2941cb90d17250013aa	In my experience, if it's a slight lisp, it either goes away or the child learns to annunciate differently on their own...both my older kids has lisps until 6-7 then one day they didn't...|`|hZf8aJkYaa	I was in speech. I can be understood some words sounds funny mainly with Th's or S's. It wouldn't hurt to try it for a while and see if he improves.|`|Tws5gVQVaa	Yeah, I absolutely agree with you.|`|TrBoPj92aa	i agree with you, your son is developing fine and as long as his lisp doesn't slow him down then don't take him to speech therapy if it gets worse to the point that he's embarrassed and doesn't want to speak then i think it would be a good move to get him help, i dont think it would take away his personality it would just help him to speak better, i think that's really crazy that the nurse pointed that out and suggested speech therapy, as it isn't a major problem, thats kind that she pointed it out to you, the parents but then its your responsibilty to go futher<br>  good luck to you and your sonx|`|yWU57CLYaa	My middle child didn't talk until age three also.  Big difference was that I begged my doctor from age two to get her a speech therapist.  At age three I changed doctors and got her the help she needed.  From my understanding talking to her speech teachers, many children that should be seen don't because of parents that think their children talk fine when they don't.  I don't know your situation on your boys, but talk to his teacher and see what his/her opinion is.  If they agree, I would get him the help he needs now, instead of later.  <br>  <br>  And for those parents that think their kid will grow out of the problem, your only hurting your child.|`|llkSmgLJaa	I'd get speech therapy, you may not notice the lisp, but strangers will. He may want to be a pastier, business man, or politician some day and this lisp will hold him back. <br>  <br>  I had some speech therapy, for a lisp, as a child and I'm in medical school now. Would you want a doctor who you had trouble understanding?|`|1G3XPiq3aa	Often it will become an issue in later life, giving speeches and being teased in high school (because kids are mean and will pick up on anything). It's easier to help a kid with when they're younger. I don't think speech therapy is something that needs to be saved for those who really need it. It's not like there's a shortage of therapists. But if you don't feel it's necessary, then you should by no means have it forced on your children. My daughter recently started speech therapy for a couple of letters she has trouble with, and kind of needs it to be better understood, as she's bi-lingual, and I find myself missing her cute little mess ups. "puptates" are "cupcakes" now =(
7DWy8mPZaa	OPKs haven't ever worked for me very well as I've had a history of very long cycles (I was getting through so many each month!) Never mind, honey. Do you chart your BBT or have a Basal thermometer lying around? It's not the most accurate thing to do without charting all cycle long but you can take your temp over the next few days to see if you get a high spike which is sustained. <br>  <br>  Is the white discharge more creamy or Egg-white? If it is stretchy or clear and watery, this is a very fertile sign and could very well mean ovulation is on the way! Many women will notice their CM dries up or becomes sticky/ creamy just after ovulation has happened so usually the day you stop noticing the abundant CM is the day after ovulation (1dpo). <br>  <br>  I'd definately get BD'ing if you can today, just to cover your bases. I'm hoping this is the cycle you see your BFP! **** Good luck and babydust! ****|`|yea2hci5aa	It's a sign that you may be ovulating.<br>  <br>  I hope that you're feeling better now.  Good luck!|`|CIPkzrFIaa	sounds like you now need to have some fun and do some baby dancing, go girl lol.|`|4b58d642d6c0c0bb9d0fb9123be4e380aa	yeah it will b ovulation dnt worry bout it|`|2k2ZeUwkaa	oh my gosh,, me too-lots of white cm. and i too havent BD lately as ive been a bit down myself.<br>  <br>  Good luck hunni, hope we can get our BFP soon x
KgD3VhKYaa	I has to be whatever suits you. <br>  <br>  It sounds a little late to be going to bed to me. Get your bed time routine sorted. Bath/story/milk/cuddles. What ever you want and then keep bringing it all a little earlier each week by 20mins or so.<br>  <br>  The wake up time could be a little earlier too, otherwise when you are ready to go to groups/coffee mornings you won`t be ready in time for them.<br>  <br>  Its really up to you. 10hrs through the night is very good you should just try to adjust the times.|`|vue9NOhYaa	When my daughter was an infant, she went to bed when we did. (We liked spending the evening as a family, since Daddy was at work all day.)  She woke at around 3 for a feed, and around 6 or 7 in the morning.<br>  <br>  If your baby is doing well on the pattern she has set for herself, and your milk supply is ample (or  you're formula feeding) then her schedule is right for her.|`|mjz8JF9Gaa	shes fine <br>  i put my 3 month old to bed at 645 and hed get up at like 2 to eat then go right back to sleep until we had to get up and get ready for daycare|`|oXzHvsBpaa	My son is a sleeper. I mean a sleeper. He goes to be at around 730-8 and sleeps till about 10 the next morning. Though he only takes one nap during the day and its not much longer then 2 hours. Usually around an hour and a half.|`|LXc9tGJVaa	I just tried to establish a bedtime for my 3-month-1-week-old daughter a couple of days ago. She'll go to bed at 8:00 and sleep until about 7:00 or 8:00 am, but I'll wake her up to feed at about 11:00 or 12:00 pm.|`|wFVLP5l3aa	my sons 9 and a half weeks and is pretty much the same routine as yours but sometimes he still wakes up at 6 30|`|N6vEZVNEaa	my son is 4 months and when he was three he started going to sleep around 8:23|`|qsjGSXaRaa	I put my 3.5-month old down at 8:30ish after her bath. She still wakes up at least twice for nightfeedings and is up at 7:00. <br>  <br>  I figure this schedule will work well when I return to work in May. I don't go to bed later than 10:00 when I'm working so this schedule for baby is conducive to my own schedule.|`|c73QkZ2haa	Wow your lucky. <br>  Our boy goes down at 8pm and is up at 5am and has been since he was just over a month.<br>  Our girl though is up at 9:30, 12:30, 3:30 times vary night to night but its every three hours and then shes up at 5 too.
AA12395149	No, it's not bad to push on your baby a bit.  Many a mom likes to "play" with her baby.  When I lie my arm across my belly, he starts to move a lot.  As long as the contact wasn't overly forceful (indicated by you hurting from it), you and your baby should be fine. <br>  <br>   The only bad contact would be from trauma, like if you were to fall directly on your abdomen or if you are in a bad car accident.<br>  <br>  Congrats on your girl!|`|TFdhL7LKaa	I'm sure she caused no harm to your baby at all! I even used to freak out when my midwife used to press down on my tummy! You'd be amazed at how well the anionic sack protects the baby - its like a :shock absorber" that protects your baby. If it really concerns you let your doc know so he can check you out - but he'll probably just press down on your tummy as well!!! Just wait until they have to check to see if your baby has engaged -  they press down pretty hard then two. Its your natural urge to protect your child - that means your a good mom. But trust me the health care professionals know what they are doing. All the best =)|`|HvbIE03saa	Oh my gosh no...as long as you didn't feel any discomfort.<br>  <br>  My sister in law is pregnant and she pushes and moves her tummy all over the place to get the baby to move so I can feel it. Scared the crap outta me because it looks like it hurts, but she said it's fine. She kept telling me to push down harder so the baby would feel it but I was being a wuss, lol.<br>  <br>  As long as you didn't feel any pain, you should be fine, but ask the doctor anyway so that you will have some peace of mind : )|`|fb61d99b32eb382445becee914185af9aa	No its fine, your tummy has got inbuilt suspension.  Pushing on your tummy is like pushing the rocker that your newborn will be in.  Doesn't hurt them, just makes them move.  I have even heard that if you fall flat on your belly at 9 months, your bub will still be ok.  I mean of course none of us wants that to happen!<br>    But what you are describing is all fine, they are protected by all that fluid, its a natural buffer zone, suspension system thing going on in there.<br>  <br>  :)|`|CpiLHcTlaa	nope won't hurt the baby! the doctors had to push and prod me just to be able to check my first baby's size! i use to love to push on my belly a little to watch him move! now i can't wait till THIS little one starts moving!|`|O7QyQl15aa	No it will not harm the baby. The baby is in a sac of fluid for protection and you would be surprised as to how robust a baby is.  Unless you are experiencing reduced movement since, dont worry at all.|`|v3LnJycKaa	if that were the case mine owuld be born with shaken baby syndrome, seriously everytime my uncooperative fetus gets scanned it is back to the camera, covering the face, crossing legs, and they shake the probe across my belly fast make me move, push her, tell me to cough.. nothing...|`|i8Ch743Laa	No,it's fine. Mine had to poke my daughter to get her to move. As long as you don't feel pain from it,it's fine. Like severe pain.|`|x8JRkRNkaa	No, no harm will be done to your baby by pushing on your stomach. I promise. If harm would be done lots of people would be in all sorts of trouble because people push on their bellies all the time to get the baby to move. Or if the baby has a limb somewhere causing discomfort people try to push it out of the way....it will not cause harm. Your baby is very well protected.|`|mc6YtaRbaa	It's not going to harm your baby, it's just making them change positions. They do it all the time. In fact once you start counting fetal movements if you every think you haven't felt any in awhile you can poke or slightly shake your belly to wake the baby up but it doesn't hurt him/her at all.|`|1G3XPiq3aa	No, they're trained and know what they're doing. You're baby's protected by a lot of layers of tissue and fluids so it would only have been a gentle nudge to your baby. Grats on the baby girl!|`|b6qe5syVaa	no thats what they do!
dIW2tVxhaa	I would be looking at his everyday diet for clues as to why he's so constipated- how much liquid does he drink in a day, either formula/BM/water/juice?<br>  <br>  All kids are different TBH so I'd try and just see what happens- you may find that the 1/2 and 1/2 is best, or maybe 1/4 to 3/4 is better :) Trial and Correction! x
JPBh5WT3aa	I think it is totally wrong for a biological parent to sell their baby.<br>  <br>  I think it is equally wrong for an adoptive parent to buy a baby like they are purchasing a pair of shoes.|`|DZzBfzVeaa	What do you mean like adoption? I wouldnt feel any diffrent cause i was adopted but if you mean like my mom had me then found some couple that said they would buy me for an amount of money and my birth parents actually sold me. Then i would feel like my birth parents were both a piece of crap and they chose money over their own kid! but either way they didnt want me in the first place so i would just be happy that someone did and that i had a family.|`|aed5cad075214254f2f176a51206a7d7aa	I can only imagine as it didn't happen to me.  Pretty disgusted I imagine. Not only at the bio parents but the people buying also.<br>  <br>  There were lots of black market adoptions in the past and even today there's selling going on (trade your baby for a scholarship type of deal)<br>  <br>  Oh, and surrogacy IS selling humans<br>  <br>  It was usually lawyers and facilitators pocketing the profit though, not the parents.<br>  <br>  Most infamous (although not the only one!) is Georgia Tann who ran the Tennessee Childrens' Home Society|`|yDWcYXl5aa	They should have gotten much more money.  I'm worth a lot.<br>  <br>  If I had been placed for adoption out of love and need, and knowing that they had done it so I'd have a better life, I think that I would want to meet them and be appreciative and hopefully, they would have met my adoptive parents to make sure that I got a good home.<br>  <br>  If a middle man like an adoption agency had sold me, I'd have been (insert words I won't say online).  99% of the time, parents don't sell babies, agencies do.  I don't understand why some adoptees here keep plugging them.  Perhaps it's the agencies plugging themselves.|`|Izn1ye9Raa	Techincally children are sold or at least bought, because adoptive parents have to pay all the birth mom's medical expenses + home study + court costs + agency fees=$10,000+ for a newborn white baby.  I'd be pretty pissed off if my mom sold me.|`|8Qxb7OZOaa	It would be a blow to one's self worth.|`|cd98c09cc34c3c84ad4502d636e2d2beaa	Would it be any different than an agency charging your adoptive parents a whole whack of money for you?  I guess right now, the mother gives the baby to the agency, which then sells it.  But agencies now give her payments (which I guess is like paying her the wholesale price for an item).<br>  <br>  It is still selling a baby.  Only if a mother sells her baby, we call it illegal BUT if an agency pressures/cons a mother to surrender her baby and then does it then we consider them next to God. <br>  <br>  "When adoption became an industry, children became 'product.'"|`|Of7KEsnXaa	I was sold by my mother's cousin. My mother had left me with her for so she could take care of some legal stuff. She gave her temporary guardianship.<br>  <br>  We my father's grandmother showed up and wanted me. My mother's cousin and her hubby wanted $1,000, but my great grandma haggled and got them down to $750.<br>  <br>  When I found out, from my great grandma, who was pretty darn proud of herself, I felt sick to my stomach. <br>  <br>  First of all it was bad enough to have been sold, but to hear that they literally sat down at a table and haggled over the price?? Especially since i know for a fact my great grandma had more than $1,000 to spare. She was quite wealthy.|`|JP04HX6maa	Hypothetically - I'd wonder why, and I'd feel pretty hurt and demand to know (if possible) the circumstances in which I was sold so I could "understand" as to how desperate someone would be to gain profit from selling their own flesh-and-blood.<br>  <br>  Realistically - that actually isn't my circumstance... so I'm quite relieved about the "black market" aspect in *my* case.|`|P2yRAWiJaa	I don't think people can "sell" their babies.  The ones that do, and get away with it, are commiting crimes that will put them in jail for a long time.  Probably selling their baby for crack money or something equally bad.<br>  <br>  If you are talking about finding out that you were adopted.  What's wrong with that?|`|7z6BWoESaa	it would most certainly hurt, but be real careful and get all the facts before you believe that that is what happened, sometimes stories get changed and totally all screwed around when it comes to adoption, so just be sure to get all the facts before you believe you were sold.|`|511e806a702f7f4b678843ad2696165faa	I wasn't sold, but my a-parents paid a great deal to adopt me.  That makes me feel dirty enough.  Knowing my first mother sold me would be horrid.|`|zGySmCgjaa	what type of selling?? like sold you for money or sold you by adoption??<br>  by adoption, I would feel kinda sad but then i wouldn't but if it was for money, i would feel horrible about myself...|`|frpCK0utaa	That would be a hurt i cant even imagine. Fortunatly, i wasn't.
dDVAUA9saa	I'm exactly 23 weeks, due date is June 19<br>  My scan was three weeks ago - it's another Girl!!!<br>  I've bought her two little outfits!!  And a book called "On the Night You Were Born"  I already have tons of stuff from my first daughter but she will need summer stuff!<br>  <br>  The baby is fine, but I have had tons of problems.  I had a severe flare-up of Crohn's disease and am on medication now so it's under control for now.  Then I came down with a really bad cold that had me in emergency treated for asthma, then I got the flu.  AGGH!!<br>  <br>  I'm not that big ( or so people say).  I can still wear 2 pairs of my pre-pregnancy jeans.  I've gained 12lbs so far.  I was underweight to begin with so my midwife told me I should gain between 26 and 40lbs (with my first I only gained 18lbs). Belly is 35 inches.|`|98WKYtfwaa	- I'm 21 weeks 5 days pregnant, due on the 28th June.<br>  <br>  - Yes i had my 20week scan, i didnt found out the sex at that appointment because he was in an awkward postion, found out 2weeks earlier at a private scan, i'm expecting a boy!<br>  <br>  - I've got nearly everything in already. Pram, moses basket, car seat, clothes, bath stuff, feeding stuff and monitors.

I feel like the side of a house, i don't know how much lbs i've piled on, but at my 13week weighing i'd gained half a stone. So i'm guessing alot since then.

irLnPW4aaa	I wouldn't even go an meet with the art teacher over this.  Seriously, whatever the reason for the C (weren't there comments?), I'd just talk to my child and tell her that she needs to listen to the teacher, put forth more effort and leave it at that.  One C on a report card in fourth grade is not going to keep her out of medical school or whatever, she is in FOURTH grade.  The myth of the "Permanent Record" strikes again...in the scheme of things this is not worth worrying about.|`|dd359cc64852ff6e00d407ac09db7261aa	Well ask her any questions you might have, and explain what your feelings are. If you think she's being harsh then say so - that's what these meetings are for.|`|hZf8aJkYaa	Ask why she received the c. Ask how she is in class. Does she get distracted? Did she do all her work. Those sorta things.|`|MXnSWKCkaa	walk in ande say good morning or good evening or good afternoon whatever time u go there and say ur class prevented my daughter from being on the honor holl dont u think ur being a little harsh ask her y she got the c was it nessicary to girl her the c dont sound to mad but dont sound to happy either <br>  good luck and hope i helped :]|`|pT7jrsAgaa	I think it's horrible to grade a child on artistic ability.....mine can't even draw a stick figure straight!  Our elementary school does not give grades for art class.  I would definitely see if the teacher would be more reasonable in her "grading".  Good luck!|`|4B2b6caEaa	walk up to the art teacher very slowly staring at her slap her across the face and go B**** wTF and walk out|`|9794VMZ9aa	Be polite- ask where she went wrong, and what she can do to improve. Ask which areas she's good at and which areas she's not so good at. Try and discover why she got a C when she usually gets straight As and Bs by being as nice and polite as possible!<br>  <br>  Maybe she'll think it over and raise her grade.|`|nnctJaggaa	i would ask the teacher what caused her to give your daughter a c and then respond by informing her that since your daughters' creativity didn't meet her standards, it prevented her from being on the honor roll and this has been a major discouragement for her
AA12395149	Maybe she wasn't certain that he was really A or B, if that's the case it's possible to get an O.  But yeah, if he was AB and the baby is O...oh no!<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  This is for Elle...<br>  When it comes to blood types it's more of a co-dominance thing...Your mom was O so that means she is OO and you had a 100% shot at getting an O from her...<br>  Your dad is A...so he could either be AA or AO (the A is the only one expressed...more or less) <br>  Since you are O, your dad must have been AO, you had a 50% chance of getting the A or the O from him, and you got the O...So you are OO.<br>  Clear as mud?  I thought so :-D|`|Eit68exyaa	Then O type would not exist after a few generations of mixed couples. That fact that it is still around (like blue eyes) means it is not impossible.<br>  <br>  But ya you are right. We spill our most privates here, and its fun to share.

1thzSbS8aa	Actually, you haven't mentioned one single pregnancy symptom. <br>  <br>  Gained two pounds---many girls gain more than that before their periods, from retained water. Besides, if she is pregnant, the baby,  placenta, and all is smaller than a sesame seed right now. It will not affect her weight or stomach size for many weeks.<br>  <br>  Weird dreams---everyone has 'em. Not a pregnancy symptom.<br>  <br>  Can't sleep through the night---my husband has the same problem. He's not pregnant.<br>  <br>  If your friend's period is delayed more than a week, she should take a pregnancy test.|`|IPl3Yh1kaa	Not being rude, but most people don't encounter the 'uncomfortable' pregnancy symptoms until  about week 6-8 (if @ all). That is usually when women begin to get 'sick'. I know I didn't gain any weight until a few months in (neither did any of the other pregnant women I know). Generally the only way to tell this early on is through a test.|`|LbNXxRXnaa	Ehmm prego? <br>  She's most likely not|`|3f0439ebe7cdf100832cada550ab973caa	A person who is pregnant first time or numerous doesn't normally experience any changes or a difference until at least 8 weeks after conception.<br>  Weird dreams, sleepless nights and tiredness can all be drawn to her intense worrying about being pregnant. <br>  As I said earlier pregnancy symptoms dont show or usually begin until the 8th week.<br>  Have your friend take a pregnancy test, but as a young woman your body changes and periods can become irregular due to diet, exercise, stress.
F8KmTbqjaa	If a young girl is having to develop her self image from a doll than she is lacking a strong female role model in her life!  I remember when I was younger I didn't start to become aware of weight and what kind of clothing I was wearing (my self image) until I was a preteen, which was long after I stopped playing with barbies.  I think people overreact to Hannah Montana and make her responsible for her image which is actually created by adults and portrayed by her!  She is a 16 year old child!  Somebody approves because that girl is RICH and popular.  I think dolls are for pretend and toys to play with and use your imagination with.  I don't really find bratz dolls as very appealing because of the attitude that goes along with them, but again somebody did since they are so popular.  We as parents have to teach our kids self esteem and realistic body image.  I don't think a doll or somebody on TV can make or break that.|`|IPl3Yh1kaa	I have no problem with it at all. This is the world we live in; beauty is important. It is not the end all be all, but it is a very recognized part of society and something I refuse to shelter my daughter/son from. You can teach your daughter/son  that they are worth more than their physical appearance while also teaching them the importance of self-grooming. There is a balance  And at the end of the day, honestly, they are just toys<br>  <br>  EDIT: bratz have tatoos and peircings ? well so do I, hopefully I won't be a failure as a moral compass for my children *rolls eyes*|`|b978f631fc787a963337206aa3833370aa	Well, although QB's post was sarcastic she did make a good point - what if they marketed a doll that was fat and ugly? Hmm...<br>  <br>  Barbie, for some reason, doesn't bother me. Sure, she's a tad on the skinny side, but if you teach your daughter once she becomes aware of body image that we come in all shapes and sizes, I don't think there's a problem with it. However, the Bratz dolls are hideous and I totally can't stand that 'gangsta' image that comes with them. I don't find it wholesome or appealing in the least. That includes the ridiculous accessories that come with them. Sure, not every girl looks like Barbie - but hey, they do have Barbies in different skin tones. But to suggest that young girls should look like the Bratz dolls is just encouraging them to grow up faster than they already are. No thanks. <br>  <br>  My daughter is 2 1/2 and really doesn't know who Barbie is. The other day we were at a playgroup with another girl exactly her age who DOES have Barbies, and I tried to see how my daughter would react when I held one up to her. She just looked at it like "Mommy, why are you sticking that thing in my face?" LOL I think she said, "Dolly!" and that was about it. Although one time I showed her who Barbie was - she was moderately interested and then went back to her business. Then later on she saw a woman on TV with lots of blonde hair and said, "It's Barbie!" LMAO<br>  <br>  But no one complains about Ken ... he's chiseled, he's cut, has a 'package,' if you will LOL. I don't hear men complaining about how he doesn't look like the "average American male."|`|s4LWmcTjaa	I would feel ok about my daughter playing with Barbies and things of the such, but I HATE bratz dolls and will not allow them in my home.<br>  <br>  Bratz give off what their name suggests:  A self centered, bratty person who is absorbed with themselves and their appearance.<br>  <br>  To a point I can understand where it could be harmful to little girls to play with Barbies of anykind.  They give off the illusion of the "perfect" body and that can be unhealthy for their self image.  I too would be thrilled to see a line of dolls that didn't look like Paris Hilton or Britney Spears.... dolls that look like REAL women!  Curves, imperfections and all!  I think that would be wonderful for our girls (and boys) to see that there is no such thing as perfection and not everyone is a Barbie girl :)<br>  <br>  I'm in on starting that line of dolls... how about you?  We could rock the "skinny" world!!!!|`|0e0a0f1828f99f87ea3d5e5bc8cbd46daa	Nope, not at all. My 7 year od niece watches all of them and it hasn't made her dress slutty, talk back, or be a brat. As a child  my barbie doll's shape never occured to me. I never wanted to "Be like it". I was who I was. Pleasantly plump. I didn't change my body to look like one of my dolls!|`|89c7e5af6668337660a2665976affbf3aa	My thoughts are they're fine as long as the child knows that's it's all pretend and not what she should strive to act and look like.<br>  <br>  I always use this example in these situations:<br>  Reading Harry Potter is fine. It only becomes a problem when you start trying to do magic tricks and attempt to jump off your roof with a broomstick.|`|Qe9rXFm0aa	A doll is a doll. When I was younger playing with Barbie, it never once cross my mind, that in order to have an acceptable body image I need huge implants, tiny waist, and long bleach blonde hair. Thats b/c little girls arent looking at barbies in that way. <br>  About bratz..Im not sure..they werent my generation..so dont know to much about the, and hanna montana..is nothing special..so I cant see how that would affect a young girls view on body image.<br>  <br>  O and the troll who post the original question, they dont make a fatty franny doll..b/c they dont want to encourage ppl to have unsanitary homes, and to not care about good personal hygeine...thats why.|`|cYRZpGkqaa	I agree with you about Hannah Montana. She looks like a normal teenager, and even though she can be a brat on the show, I don't think she will harm self esteem.<br>  <br>  Bratz - I absolutely despise brats. They look like whores. Plain and to the point.<br>  <br>  Barbies - Ahh, how I loved playing with Barbies when I was a kid. I agree with you about the Barbies, but since we were kids they have down-sized the breasts, thickened the waist a little, and I believe they made the butts a little bigger too. (My foster sister had Barbies and the old clothes would not fit!) So while it's still not perfect, at least it's more normal. I will let my daughter play with Barbies.|`|dnG7fhnbaa	I detest "Bratz" somebody bought my little sister annual on them for Christmas and when I went to visit she was showing me "make up tips" in the book...("Rub a toothbrush over your lips to make them look full!") I couldn't believe it and they do seem to promote an unhealthy body image and force children into growing up too fast.<br>  <br>  But as for Barbie...I loved her when I was little and I think most little girls do...as far as I remember she had a pretty frumpy dress sense too, ot a "slutty one." <br>  <br>  And I don't know Hannah Montana either but you're right; she does look normal and healthy and in those google pics she's barely showing an inch of flesh..<br>  <br>  I will let my child play with them if she wants to when she's older, although I may discourage Bratz...I'm hoping they're not so popular by then.<br>  <br>  I think the woman who posted that Q just waned a rant...the argument was hardly constructed in an articulate or intelligent way.|`|efbb15bd3b273c3e6801e5fe2b1add09aa	To me this is a lot like the whole violent video games scenario....if you talk with your kids about what is real and what is just "play" and you monitor them and feel that they have a good grasp on things, then I don't see the harm.  If my daughter were obsessed with lots of makeup, her body, or had a bratty attitude I might start taking away toys and regulating the tv shows.  If my son were aggressive or bloodthirsty, the video games would go too.|`|s6emVQleaa	I not a big fan of the bratz dolls, but I don't care about the others.  I think my daughters self image is going to come more from what she sees in me than what she sees around her.  I say that knowing I have food/dieting issues from my mom that she has from her mom.  If I can get myself to a point where I'm not always dieting and criticizing myself, then I think that will have a bigger impact on her than anything in the media.|`|t1fx6kXcaa	I don't have a daughter but If I did, Bratz would be a big no-no. I can't stand the look of those dolls. They're overtly sexualised and dressed to look like hookers. I wouldn't want those dolls to influence the clothing choices of young girls.<br>  I loved my barbie dolls too. At least with Barbie you can get Dr Barbie, Vet Barbie etc.<br>  By the time I have a daughter (if ever), hopefully the Hannah Montana craze will have been replaced so I won't have to even contemplate buying one of those dolls.|`|w9TzZCt8aa	my sister plays with bratz and she doesn't care about her figure. i played with barbies until i was 7 years old and i didn't feel my figure was weird. hannah montana (miley cyrus) is ok figure wise and don't dress slutty like so i would say all the toys are ok.|`|OvFEyvU5aa	See I feel like Barbie is good for little girs the job play setts and houses family it lets their imagation grow. Now Bratz are not allowed in my house they have thongs and tattoos no I won't let my dauther play with bratz but see can have all the barbies she wants.|`|VAMsP3nlaa	Sure, dolls like barbie, bratz, etc. don't give the correct image of what a "real" or "natural" body should look like. However, I do not believe it is dolls alone that have the ability to impact a child's self esteem and idea of body image on that level. Parents, by far, have such a great impact and most are ignorant to that fact. A mother who stands in front of the mirror complaining her hips are wide, her hair looks aweful, or she feels fat will leave a lasting impact on a child. And then, that child may begin to question her own body image. I played with barbies growing up and do not have any issues with body image, I thought they were a great tool in enhancing my imagination with pretend play. Too many people get focused on trying to blame someone else...Set a good example, dress appropriately, watch what you model, and don't try to dress your child like a 2 dollar hooker and you will be fine.|`|kSZx9cY5aa	To be honest, I don't think it ruins body image. I remember when I was a kid and I played with Barbies-I didn't compare them to myself at all because well...it was just a doll! As far as I know my daughter was the same way when she was younger and also played with barbies. I remember all hers had different names though, because "Barbie is a stupid name!" lol :)<br>  <br>  I remember when she was between the ages of 9-11 (I think) she would ask for Bratz dolls, and when they first came out I didn't have a problem with it. But now I see them in stores and they are dressed like absolute sluts! Even the baby bratz dolls are wearing skanky outfits. So if I had little girls now (my young kids are boys) I wouldn't buy them, it just seems unnecessary. <br>  <br>  As for Hannah Montanna, as i've said my young kids are boys so they aren't interested in her, and my daughter (15) thinks she is full of crap lol.  I don't think her image is a bad infulence, but her character on the show is awful. I'm glad none of my kids like her. But if they did, I wouldn't ban the show because as far as i'm concerned it's OUR job as parents to raise our kids and teach them what is appropriate behaviour-NOT a tv show. On the other hand a lot of girls admire Miley Cyrus (who plays Hannah Montana) and she's only 16, is dating a man in his mid-twenties and there are raunchy pictures of her that keep surfacing-not exactly an ideal role model.<br>  <br>  As a parent I wouldn't neccesarily encourage my kids to play with/watch these things and I wouldn't neccesarily buy them. I probably wouldn't ban them though, because hopefully my kids will realise Barbies and Bratz dolls are toys-good for playing with but not much else. And as for Hannah Montana and other tv shows hopefully I will be able to teach my kids what is and isn't appropriate, and they will follow my example, instead of an example from tv.<br>  :)|`|nfzQkvqraa	My daughter has my old barbie trunk and gets it out from time to time. It's sort of funny because some of the barbies are balding due to the haircuts they received from me as a child. But she likes them anyway.<br>  <br>  We have one Hannah Montana doll, and one Bratz doll.  That someone else purchased for her.  She rarely touches them, but the Bratz doll walks a dog which she likes.<br>  <br>  I think they're getting more body image ideas from their peers (even at the tender age of 7- my daughter)  than from these dolls.<br>  <br>  My child would rather roll around in the dirt and pretend to be a tiger, but when she opens up to her "girly" side every once in a while and plays with these dolls, I don't mind.  We have a good relationship and talk often and honestly about what's realistic.  She's going to see it all somewhere eventually right?<br>  <br>  Also, while I don't care for Bratz dolls (ESPECIALLY the name)  I once was at a neighbors who's daughters were watching one of the movie, and even though they have a ton of makeup on and wear odd clothing, they really do have a decent message.  The whole movie was about teamwork, forgiveness, and having compassion for others.  I don't think they're the devil in disguise.|`|ANHsv4ENaa	I absolutely hate the Bratz dolls. They are like a pedophile's dream come true. YUCK. Barbies I wouldn't have a huge problem with but I would try to encourage other things and not them. And not all Barbies are created equal. Veterinarian Barbie and gogo dancer Barbie are not the same to me. As for Hannah Montana, I think it's sad that she is considered acceptable and normal for little girls. The tight clothes, the (imo) inappropriate dresses she has worn to awards shows, I would not want my daughter to dress like that if I had one.|`|60b853fe7d4335e1b74668b328b358b7aa	No, not at all.<br>  <br>  The media, magazine covers, television.... actresses/ models (society in general)... yes.
urarletqaa	I would discuss it again with your husband and let him know its what you really want. I think you're right I think you should have another one now and you sound like a lovely mum. Have a joke with your husband and say that if he says no you'll stop taking the pill (or whatever method you're on). He might just see you really want it and agree with you. However I don't think you should stop protection without his permission. Good luck|`|N6vEZVNEaa	i think that you and your husband need to really talk this over....and if you wait 3 to 4 years and still want another one then i say go for it...also if you and your husband don't already have a child together then you all need to get one
GEfpzUNvaa	i didnt read anything about the abortion post but i agree with you.. i lost a baby and cant get pregnant easily.. so it truely upsets me when these young wiper snappers get pg and don't want the thing.. so keep your damn legs crossed and grow up.. thanks for postin this. ha i love it|`|eytlIKITaa	I think that's a great idea!!!  It's hard for a lot of women who are TTC and have been for a while to see something like that in the TTC section or even in the pregnancy section...  Great idea!!!|`|bebee00e4f3a4e5d156594de8d4a527eaa	....I didn't bother to read the entire listing of the abortion procedure they had typed. I knew I couldn't handle that.|`|dnG7fhnbaa	Brilliant suggestion! Especially when there's women on here who are TTC or coping with a miscarriage...|`|AA10280194	I see your point clearly but I don't think most people who just found out that they are pregnant and are trying to decide about aborting the baby or not are going to browse the political section.  Women's Health is a possibility but pregnancy is the most obvious section.  I agree, it is annoying, but if you are really against something and are trying to help people's point of view going to the subject matter is best.  Questions that are bothersome just shouldn't be looked at.|`|tdNfQWaAaa	I'm soooo with you! I mean, here we all are, TRYING to get pregnant to KEEP the baby, then someone ACCIDENTALLY gets pregnant so they just want to abort it! Come on!!!! Its not fair first of all that someone who doesnt want a baby get pregnant. But then to just abort it, they need to charish it because some women cant have babies. But anyway, I'm soooo with you!|`|7031265d0531963ae96124dd73a8cd85aa	Right on, sister!!! I'm so tired of seeing abortion posts in OUR section! First of all, if we're in the pregnancy section, most of us are already pregnant and intend on keeping our babies so it's REALLY a waste of time anyways!<br>  <br>  <br>  **EDIT** <br>  <br>  The pregnancy section is for pregnant people... duh. <br>  And I'm not "some girl". I'm a pro-choice pregnant woman who has every right to state her opinion just like you.<br>  <br>  I don't see why you would want to be here in the first place if you're not pregnant. it's not like you can accurately answer anybody's questions anyways. Looks like I'm not the only one who disagree's with your attitude.|`|CpiLHcTlaa	i agree completely. they should either be redirected or maybe the people of Y/A could make a section in pregnancy/parenting called "choices" or something for abortion and people unsure about abortion adoption or keeping it? i'm getting really annoyed at the "whats your opinion on abortion" questions they're just making everyone fight and stress. I do pregnant girls REALLY need they're blood pressure to go up?<br>  <br>  i'd also like to point out im pro-choice.  and this is the PREGNANCY section amanda so yeah it kind of is for questions from pregnant people about pregnancy.|`|gx4s68s8aa	I completely agree with you.  Woman's Health section is the best place for those questions, especially when a person is asking about abortion for themselves.  And questions about abortion in a more debating, non personal way should really go to the political section.<br>  <br>  And for those who say that you should just avoid those questions all together, if you are uncomfortable with the topic-  It is sometimes completely impossible.   I try to avoid them, but the question line doesn't always have the abortion topic in it.  Many times it is "What should I do, or what do you think about this?"  So I end up reading very disturbing question.  Perhaps they would stop posting such questions if we always directed them to the Woman's Healthy area.<br>  <br>  As a pregnant woman that is pregnant with a high risk and unplanned pregnancy it really upset me to hear people that act like the pregnancy is nothing.   That the baby is not really a baby.  That it is a problem.  And they really have no idea what a real problem is like.  But then again, I am not hear to judge, but I also really get upset by those questions.|`|b978f631fc787a963337206aa3833370aa	I can see where that would be a good idea. Perhaps bring it up with YA and see what they say. I think I have seen some of them come up in women's health but I agree, unless you have a political slant to your post, that would probably be a better category.
q44wzEg0aa	congratulations!|`|2k2ZeUwkaa	YIP SOUNDS LIKE YOU PREGGERS!<br>  <br>  CONGRATS|`|JjBwydymaa	Hunni.. you need to ring your doctors and request an emergency appointment...<br>  <br>  You cant spend the week thinking am i? or arnt i? its not fair on you! Go and ring them now!!!<br>  <br>  I will keep my fingers crossed for you hun xxxx|`|RR35cmBdaa	could u not call the doctor and ask for an emergency appointment or even go and see the nurse . im not sure were u stay but see even if u could get the doctor to call you and explain what has happened before and you would like to see them ASAP fingers crossed all is well|`|sK67bBy5aa	If your doctor knows you have been through all of this and they didn't fit you in....I would soooo change doctors!!<br>  <br>  If you really don't want to know b/c you are scared of miscarriage then I say. Stay well rested, off your feet as much as possible and drinks  lots and lots of water!! And wait for you doctor.
RR35cmBdaa	hi well i got a negative with HTP but it was lucky i was going to the docs on monday i explained how i was feeling the doctor told me to lie on the bed and she felt around my tunny and a few other things and said i was def pregnant i was around 5 weeks. so it ispossiblee not to show on a HTP she took blood from me as well and it came back positive she said that it was low that's why it did not show up she said people even 12 weeks will still not get apositivei test so just goes to show there not 100%. im not sure if blood pressure would butdefiantlyy a blood lest even if its low. good luck|`|MFsuN8Doaa	To be honest, they are probably made by the same company anyway, and all pregnancy tests must comform to strict regulations. <br>  <br>  So both tests should be as accurate as the other.|`|17103f1748af3e37b30568fa758fd4d3aa	perhaps you could get one of thoes that are specifically to test earlier.|`|O7QyQl15aa	I dont think it matters, they both work on the same principle.<br>  <br>  Blood tests can pick up traces of human chorionic gonadotropin ( HCG) which is the pregnancy hormone which is present at the start of pregnancy at very low levels, my understanding is the over the counter tests require a higher level to detect in urine as are not as efficient as medical tests.  <br>  I believe a doctor can also detect low levels of HCG in urine also.  If your are only a couple of weeks pregnant, it is very possible you are pregnant as early in the morning your urine would be concentrated and not diluted by anything you have drank, so could have enough HCG to indicate positive. <br>  The quantity of HCG would increase as the pregnancy progresses so try again in a week<br>  Good luck!|`|Twe0U07Laa	GP's do it fo free girly|`|JDw1RDcaaa	i didnt get a positive test from a shop brought test until i was 14 weeks pregnant so go to the doctors n get tested|`|0zWJlNi1aa	I used a Boots own brand only because they were like loads cheaper!<br>  <br>  It worked fine for me
WvWFmwQoaa	YES it is normal i get the same thing happen to me if i walk around or stand up for to long i asked my doctor and he said its your baby putting pressure on your cervix. i know how you feel it is painful but there is not much you can do about it. You should just relax every now and then and take a break and sit down this is the only way it will stop so much pressure down there. i have noticed that if i just hang around the house being lazy and relaxed it dosent happen but if i go do some shopping or a bit of walking then it will be painful for me.<br>  good luck and i hope it gets better for you :))|`|OPTDFRuzaa	yes its the pressure your baby is putting on your cervix. its a good thing although you wont think that just now lol. it could be baby has engaged good luck.|`|8oAlBL91aa	That would be the baby dropping getting ready for his birthday yay not to much longer....
Mg4jSTRlaa	I do believe that some children have a 6th sense as my daughter also predicts minor things before they happen for example she will say the phone is ringing or someones at the door but when i go there there not then within seconds the phone will ring or someone will be at the door spooky ain't it|`|ssDPdqZaaa	o god I hope so. I am in your exact same situation!! I want a little boy so much! I feel like Im going to have another girl.  its almost like I know Im not going to be lucky, but my 2 and 5 year old (mostly my 5 year old) tells me its a baby brother. my friends said, some how kids know.<br>  sorry I couldn't give you an answer, but Im going to keep checking your Q, to see what people say! Im so curios!!|`|ded4210b2d8375997cd6719be107446baa	I does make you think, however i ahev three sons and am expecting my fourth. but both my 6 yr old and 4 yr old are convinced its a girl and thats what my 6 yr old has been telling everyone in his class. But the scan did say it was a boy so I guess they are just wishing really!!!|`|YehcUSkoaa	i do believe some children have a certain sense for these things.  my little cousin called his mom's second pregnancy "the black baby." she miscarried.  He called her third pregnancy with his little sister.|`|ovo9rOKgaa	No im sure it is not as when i was still in nsode my mum my sisiter wanted a boy and she got me (a girl) she screamed.....though it could be possible....who knows|`|Xga0Y3Lhaa	dunno sorry!|`|FcHplZtQaa	Yes kids can pck up on these things, of this I have no doubt!|`|dnG7fhnbaa	Nah...some people can, but it's not a trait exclusive to kids...your daughter is just "gifted" perhaps...Most of my friends children didn't even guess what sex the baby was and if they did 50% were wrong...but both my nan and older sister can guess the sex of a baby within the first weeks of pregnancy...they've both predicted that my baby is a boy...we'll find out in 6 days when I go for my scan! <br>  <br>  Congratulations and good luck! x|`|qfCRWAw0aa	Yeah i reckon they probably can! <br>  <br>  I think everyone is born with a sixth sense but some lose it through time! <br>  <br>  Everychild has some sort of sixth sense and apparently are more sensitive to ghosts as well (if you beleive in all that)<br>  <br>  I think you probably will be having a little boy! <br>  <br>  Good luck hunny <br>  <br>  xxx|`|6PhSENcXaa	Our oldest which is our son told my wife each time what she was having and he was right all 7 times.  And we didn't have them check for the sex of the baby before.  We didn't want to know.  3 girls and 5 boys.<br>  So I do believe a child has some sense of what your having.|`|RvSHQtrXaa	This could be a striking coincidence.  Please do not dwell on these findings.|`|OJFz0LBZaa	not sure how true it is but my son said we are having a girl and sure enough we are
lwlZMhiqaa	It's not recommended that you do these things in the first trimester because of the fumes you breathe in.  My doctor told me it was fine after the 1st trimester (13 weeks), but I still waited a while to dye my hair, probably about 6 months into my pregnancy.  Ask your doctor, because he might have a different opinion.  Congrats on your pregnancy!|`|nWUHLu1aaa	When it comes to dying your hair it isn't about the safety of the baby it is about your hormones changing and effecting the reaction of your hair and the chemicals in the dye. The color may not turn out right etc... when it comes to your hair and pregnancy many things change natural blonds tend to have a darker hair color afterwards and some that have straight hair have wavy/ curly hair. I have never seen or heard of any babys having complications because the mom had her nails done.|`|2274dcf5eba0ee2ef3aabbe2c8b0a89daa	the first trimester, i wouldn't use harsh chemicals like bleaches and hair lighters, and the nails are because those places do not use new files for every person. so just Imaging the germs you are passing around. You cant take certain antibiotics due to birth defects, <br>  <br>  but lots and lots of people do it.. just keep it to a minimum...|`|Gw5j2hGOaa	For the hair coloring it is up to you but I tell my clients they can. As for nails I kept mine on all the way through.|`|fb7cf9f135155789f589f25b5c08b6c6aa	Lol...this is just an old wives tale. I know pregnant women that are 9 months and are still getting their nails and hair done.|`|Bg6txvxqaa	They recommend you don't do it in the forst trimester. I'm dying my hair again tonight if I can summon up the energy lol|`|lb0cpSSyaa	they say its a myth...and its safe to get your hair dyed and nails done at any point in the pregnancy!  hope this helps :)|`|IPl3Yh1kaa	I got my nails done the entire way through my pregnancy. I did not dye my hair because I just don't color it. However, if I did I would have continued that as well. <br>  <br>  My doctor told me 90% of the things that they try to 'scare' pregnant women with are hogwash.|`|vue9NOhYaa	I wouldn't recommend it while lying in the birthing bed.|`|mc6YtaRbaa	You can get your hair and nails done at any time during pregnancy. The chemicals will not harm you baby at all. The reason they say to wait until you are done with the 1st trimester is because the fumes may make you nauseous. This is per my Dr. The only time you should worry is if you work in a nail salon for a living and you are breathing it every single day, but just going there for an appointment for and hour or so every couple weeks will not harm your baby.|`|v3LnJycKaa	haha the 4th trimester, ok sorry... <br>  <br>  you can do it when you are comfy, the only thing they warn against is that the fumes may upset your stomach... If you couldnt dye hair or be pregnant and get your nails done then wouldnt that mean that hair dressers and nail techs must not work during pregnancy.... I did it with both my kids it made me feel good... and i have had 2 very healthy little girls! my dr always says do what you are comfortable with, if something makes you uncomfortable then it probably isnt good for you.|`|UaL28atDaa	Take a look at these videos for everything you need to know about stayinf beautiful while pregnant.

rDPADat1aa	I took the same medication while around 7-8 months pregnant with my first child at my doctor's instruction and my child is fine.  If your doctor told you to take it, then do it.  If you're still worried, call back and talk to them about your concerns.  The doctors can alleviate your fears better than us.<br>  <br>  Good luck and congrats on the pregnancy.|`|i8Ch743Laa	If they tell you to take it,why not call the dr and ask them?

You need to treat the infection.  (You would do far more harm by letting a half-treated infection come back.)|`|ZncV5gc0aa	I think the antibiotics that end in cycline are the ones you shouldn't take. I'm allergic to penicillin so I've never been described it but I'm pretty sure it's safe.
vTfEYeKQaa	waxing, yes, as long as it's not bikini area.. you could get an infection if the place isn't clean. highlights, no...the chemicals are harmful to the baby. sunbeds, definitely NOT, it raises your core body temperature and can do A LOT of damage to the baby, including brain damage. fake tan, maybe, as long as there are no harmful chemicals and you don't do it all the time.  nail extensions, yes as long as you wear a mask as to not inhale the fumes.
qCIGL7Whaa	So YOUR mom is BROKE? No need for make-up and designer clothes and extensions and those doo-dads. You need FOOD money! You can get a job somewhere at 14. Some places are 16, some 14.<br>  If you can't do that, then sell your junk on eBay, do a kissing booth at a fair or carnival, and try telling your mom to get a job.

be8738c7b3a936fc2e865b3f0e6ad7d4aa	I have with both pregnancies.<br>  <br>  The reason it would be transvaginal is because they can get a better view than they could with the abdominal. I have 6 ultrasounds this pregnancy, 4 were transvaginal. The 4 transvaginal ones were a LOT clearer than the abdominal. They also get more accurate measurements of the baby that way.|`|b978f631fc787a963337206aa3833370aa	I asked my ultrasonographer this at my 18w ultrasound, which was abdominal, not TV. I asked why they did it and asked how invasive it was. SHe showed me the wand and explained that lots of doctors do them early on, and often she lets her patients insert the wand themselves if they feel comfortable. <br>  <br>  I still would prefer an abdominal ultrasound myself, and can only see where they'd do a vaginal early on if your dates were messed up, you were considered high risk, or maybe were taking fertility meds and were concerned about multiples. You can see quite a bit abdominally at 12 weeks - I had an u/s in this pregnancy at that point and they could see everything just fine. <br>  <br>  Personally I think some doctors are a little too ultrasound happy and doing them at every appointment for no medical reason is WAY too excessive. While intermittent, occasional exposure might not be too bad, they still haven't ruled out 100% some of the risks that might be associated with it. There's even speculation that increased u/s exposure can lead to autism, which is an interesting theory.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.midwiferytoday.com/articles/ultrasoundrodgers.asp" rel="nofollow">http://www.midwiferytoday.com/articles/u...</a>|`|PN7ELn3aaa	They do them between 8 and 12 weeks to check the development of the fetus. Transvaginal ultrasounds get a better picture when the baby is still itty-bitty. It's really not a big deal, they do it a lot! When I had a threatened miscarriage at 16 weeks they did both a regular us and a transvaginal us.|`|1jwbQaZTaa	i had it done this way at week 8 and week 14. they do it to get a better  view of the baby if they cant do it with the dopplar (manual) u/s.<br>  <br>  but at week 12 it could just be to check your cervix and get a better look at the baby. no biggie. good luck and relaxxx|`|AA12192295	They do it to get a better view. Its really not that bad. I've had a few and I don't mind them. Your not even thinking about it.. all you'll be thinking about is your little baby you are looking at on the screen.|`|lc57ntoFaa	I actually had one at 11 weeks. They look the same, so don't worry. The reason I was told they do it, is because you're baby isn't really THAT big yet. It's a little bigger than a kidney bean, so if they do the ab one, they wouldn't see much. When they do transvag, they'll (or should) check your ovaries too. Make sure they're the right size, and no cysts or anything. And with the transvag one, you see the whole picture ( sac and all). It's really not THAT bad. Yeah it sucked, but seeing the baby, was well worth having that uncomfortable stick up there. Haha. Plus there's much more worse things you'll go through durring your pregnancy. (hemmoroids, boob leakage, and all sorts of other fun stuff!).|`|CKnHMYHnaa	Well, if you are due in Sept then you are definitely not 12 weeks yet so this must be occurring sometime in the future.  Call the office and ask her what her reasons are.  <br>  <br>  My experiences have required tons of transvaginal ultrasounds throughout my entire pregnancy so that the doctors could get a good look at my cervix.  It's not a big deal so and there is no need to be uptight about it and it may be in the best interest of your child.|`|dr8qJFePaa	I will be 12 weeks next thursday and have a TV Ultrasound. Mine is to check for IPS ( some dect checking for the baby in early stages) and my doc said it can only be done between 11 and 13 week. IS that why u have an ultrasound? To check for any baby defects? Anyways, don't worry im sure it will all be fine n don't stress out. Happy 9 months, I a, assuming we both are in the same time frame pf preg :)|`|F7knBX1haa	I had a transvaginal U/S at 12 weeks to check the development of baby and to check ovaries and cervix. Since baby is so little it is easier to see baby. It is not painful, maybe a little discomfort. The most discomfortable part was when my ovaries were checked. You will be fine. You are just so exicted to see your baby, that the discomfort disappears.|`|c73QkZ2haa	The hosp and doctor that i went to actually did this at every ultrasound. To check the cervix. They never checked once manually the entire time i was pregnant. And i had an US every 2 weeks cause i had twins. Was unpleasant but not painful. They also do it to check for placental previa if your placenta seems low on a reg ultrasound.|`|hIzQyflqaa	i had one at 12 weeks after no heartbeat was seen on normal scan to confirm i had miscarried, i had.  Theyre not that bad, bit like a smear, unpleasant but not painful!|`|6PR8Cj2raa	My doctor that I go to see, thats the only kind of u/s he does! I guess just some doctors like them better then others.
WSXDQ4bpaa	Its normal. Between 11-14 weeks it was the worst for me. I was getting up 4-6 times a night needing to pee. It backed off for about a week and a half and I wouldn't wake up needing to pee until around 6 in the morning and once a night was a lot better than 4-6! Now I am waking up around 4am or 5am every morning needing to pee.|`|bTlhBX3daa	Yes, it's normal. Your body has slowed down all of it's normal processes, and you are also producing more urine at this point. It seems to lighten up slightly in the 2nd Trimester (or at least it did for me) and then get's bad again in the 3rd Trimester as the baby gets bigger and tends to rest on or kick at your bladder. <br>  <br>  It worries me that you said it hurts, and then there is only a few drops though. That sounds like a possible bladder infection, or UTI.  I know for me, I am urinating smaller amounts, but I would definitely not call it only a few drops, and I wouldn't call it painful anymore than just really having to go.|`|mPyN2XX3aa	It's a hormonal thing.  It'll let up soon and then pick up again as the baby gets bigger and is sitting on your bladder.|`|mc6YtaRbaa	It's normal! It may fade off for a little while and then come back in the 3rd trimester.|`|OPTDFRuzaa	your baby is gaining weight all the time but you might not. its totally normal for it to happen at this stage as baby may be small but is still putting pressure on you.

That maybe it really doesn't matter what other people think of you, and that you should get a good education??  You are 14yrs old. Go to school.  Your looking for a reason not to, and you shouldn't be on the computer asking, when you know you should be getting dressed and going.  Who cares about your eye make up.  Honestly, I didn't wear any from 10th -12th, because I wasn't awake enough before I left to put it on.  But its a very unimportant part of life.  None of this will matter in a week.  And you probably won't remember it|`|XKYP0sGQaa	I don't know where you are from, but it's half term now over here in England.<br>  <br>  Anyway, if your parents are ok with it, then I think you should take today off.

93e5e66462cba8bcd411219422deababaa	sounds fine. nursing isn't just for food it's a comfort thing. if she isn't properly nursing in the day then she si going to be hungrier. try going into a dim lighted room with no distraction and have her nurse there|`|vue9NOhYaa	Completely normal.  Babies don't nurse in set patterns.  She might be having a growth spurt, or just being more distractable during the day, so needing to nurse more at night.  Or, it could be that your supply has dropped from such infrequent feeds up until now, (6 feeds a day and 9 hours at night is VERY low for a 2-3 month old!)  and she's trying to get your supply back up.  <br>  <br>  If it is a problem for YOU, you can try encouraging her to focus during her daytime feeds (try lying down in a dark room with her) so she gets plenty of milk.  Also, try nursing a bit more often during the day. She does need to be  nursing more often than she has been doing.|`|3f0439ebe7cdf100832cada550ab973caa	Babies have little growth spurts where they feed alot, than sleep, feed alot than sleep than feed less!!<br>  It's perfectly normal, a bottle fed baby will do the same.<br>  Your baby may just be enjoying the bond you share whilst feeding and associate this feeling whilst being fed.|`|T0gv52CDaa	She may be going through a growth spurt.  They will want to nurse more often during those times.  As for the playful nursing, put the breast away when she starts playing, and she will learn to get down to business when nursing, or she will lose it.|`|deIzFnV8aa	There are lots of reasons to nurse more often - the infamous growth spurts, being too distracted during nursing to eat as much (the world is a lot more interesting to them at this age), having trouble eating as much due to sore gums from pre-teething, all kinds of things.  You need to identify if any of these could be causing her probs.  And of course there is the reason that babies just like to throw you for a loop (I have actually seen this reason given by a doctor in a semi-serious way before :P) Yes, this is very normal.<br>  <br>  If she is nursing for comfort you could try giving her a toy, finger, or pacifier to suck on instead.  If she is getting distracted while eating you can try a dim quiet room to make her more focused.  Or you can just be glad your DD only wakes once during the night (very normal to need to eat at night at this age!) and not more times :P
QveBSjFSaa	Carry on as normal.<br>  sleep it off when the kids are at school.<br>  It kind of works against us, being multi-taskers. We take care of everything even when we feel to the curb!<br>  ~Edit~ can you call a "jammie" day with them? Maybe stay in your jammies, make a fort with blankets on your bed, and practice talking in whispers?<br>  I FEEL for you, and remember those sick days with little ones at home..... they just drag on and on and on !|`|1KIwM1uOaa	I am a stay at home mom and I also have MS so around here their are a lot of days when I am sick but I still make the beds, clean the house, cook, do homework and everything else.  On the occasions where I do end up in bed I am lucky and my hubby will take the day off and stay at home to wait on me and the kids are all a big help when they get home from school.|`|bvYPr0Cvaa	I usually just do my best to take care of my daughter. I get really bad headaches and sometimes it's almost impossible to take care of her, because of the pain. But if i need help and my husbands at work, i usually call my mom to see if she can watch her for a little bit until the headache goes away. So if you have a relative or close friend that wouldn't mind watching them until you feel better, ask them for help. Best of luck to you!!!|`|DcVoq5Tuaa	mom's don't get sick days. it sucks. we take care of everyone else when they are sick but when we get sick, no one takes care of us. I get the kids off to school and crawl back into bed until they get home, then fix a quick dinner for them and go back to bed. My oldest will usually help me out with the younger ones.|`|rRQNDpwVaa	I got flu recently.  Day 1 it was snowing and my husband's workplace closed early so he collected the kids from school.  Day 2 was my brother-in-law's day off, so he collected them.  Day 3 my husband took a half day to collect them, Days 4 and 5 the little one was home ill so the older one walked home alone.  Luckily the school has breakfast club so my husband can take them before he leaves for work.  <br>  <br>  It's not easy when you're ill.  My husband couldn't wait for me to be up and about again, he was fed up of being 'mum'!  All you can do is forget the housework, tell the kids you're ill and need to rest, make a bed for yourself on the sofa and put CBeebies on tv all day.  Tell the husband to cook dinner - beans on toast or takeaway if necessary, and get yourself to bed as soon as he's home.|`|TQg7yubGaa	I got the flu not that long ago, and I have a 4 month old daughter.  Honestly, you keep going until its nap time, and then you nap with them.  Thats all you can do.  They aren't going to stay out of stuff while you sleep, so you have to sleep when they do.  It took longer than it should have to get over the flu, because I had to do it that way, but there isn't much else you can do.  Unless your really sick, and then some times dad will stay home.  Not very often though|`|Mm5NsrF8aa	I call Grandma! I'm lucky to have my Mom so close. Can you phone a friend? see if someone can take your kids for a play date so you can rest or sleep...you'll repay the favor once you're feeling better.|`|VHHis05Naa	I suck it up.  And my husband does the same thing...|`|lfMJPZ67aa	I just have to suck it up and get out of bed. I have no family to call on really just my mum who has breast cancer so I don't like to ask. Even before she fell ill I never asked. I don't like to ask any one for help. I have three children 7, 3 and 1 so if I am sick it gets a bit much but I don't complain I just keep going I guess.
mCDopsLEaa	well it could just be your subconscious playing tricks on your head. the only way to know is hpt|`|SmF9yU2Eaa	the only way to know for sure is a pregnancy test|`|c3247ed3603ad90b5256ba8a941a3d92aa	You are stressing, and I understand the feeling. You can take a pregnancy test up to 5 days before you miss it. Try that. Otherwise just wait until you are do for your period and see if you miss it, if you do take a test. Good luck, things will be fine.|`|yea2hci5aa	Well there's a chance that you may be pregnant but the only way to know for sure is to take a hpt.  I would def. wait to take it though until you've missed your period.  You don't want to risk the chance of getting a flase negative.<br>  <br>  Good luck!
sbeoF50gaa	OK he's an 8 year old little boy. First, tell his mom. She should be able to talk to him. I don't think he is  "attracted to the dog" I think he's just curious about what's going on down there and the dog "feels good" to him. He needs to be talked to about  masterbation and that's ok, but not with a dog. My daughter is 5 now but when she was 3 she used to touch herself a lot. I told her that's ok, but to only do it in the bathtub. Kids are curious about their bodies. I haven't seen my daughter touch herself in a few years... but I don't think kids or people should be embarrassed about their body and what feels good to them, but I think they need to know boundaries.<br>  as for talking to the mom... that's going to be awkward but I'll agree with the first person it could turn into a "fetish" if not corrected. Tell her you feel awkward about this and you are sorry you might not have handled it the right way but You didn't know how to handle the situation. You could write her a note! that might be easier for you.|`|wiAVa1H5aa	It's bestiality, and needs to be nipped in the bud before he makes it part of his sexual arousal...   You should have told him to knock it off, put his pants on, take the dog away, and tell his folks.|`|8oAlBL91aa	Well I can see how you just walked away because you just wouldn't have thought of something like this happening. But yes the mom needs to know because this is something that shouldn't be happening and could have been happening a lot. It was probably very embarrassing for the both of you. As for what to say to the mom god I don't even know how to begin I guess something like the other night while I was watching "boy" I caught him in the basement with the dog and his pants down. Maybe she might get the idea where you are coming from so you don't have to just keep digging your self deeper, if she doesn't then straight out tell her what you saw or tell her in whatever way you feel the most comfortable saying it, I don't know this is really awkward lol. But good luck and don't leave it go speak up.|`|6VbNJOtfaa	You need to tell someone who can talk to him.  He is doing that because he has discovered that when someone licks his wiener it feels nice.  Unfortunately he is going about it all in the wrong way.  He needs to understand that having an animal lick you is not only animal abuse, but disgusting and not normal (his mother needs to say that with some less demeaning words).
FLEXqVoiaa	You shouldn't have to change it-That sounds adorable! I wish I had the guts to put up such a cute declaration of what I'm doing while I'm pumping at work.<br>  <br>  There's always going to be people who think breastfeeding/pumping is inappropriate. It's their issue, not yours!|`|Vp83Fuakaa	keep the Sign its clever ,someone is always going to be offended about some thing i doubt the person cares about the sign people can be jealous about weird things|`|UghJ0XROaa	Lol, i find that amusing myself!|`|jsdDgIuRaa	Honestly I think it's kind of tacky, someone milking a cow to show you are pumping?<br>  <br>  Women get enough shiat as it is for breastfeeding and being compared to cows.  <br>  <br>  I wouldn't get all worked up over it but I don't think it's all that funny.<br>  <br>  Can't you simply have a "do not disturb" sign?<br>  <br>  I actually have a pretty good sense of humor I just think it's kinda tacky.<br>  <br>  Edit: How about "DO NOT DISTURB UNLESS YOU WANT TO BE FLASHED?" Sounds good in a school right?  Just kidding but I get your problem, I personally just think the cow thing is corny.  I don't know I would try to find a different sign if it were me but that's my opinion.    It's up to you.|`|6VbNJOtfaa	I do not think that is in bad taste at all.  However, in light of keeping everyone happy (since there was a complaint) I think that you should replace the sign with one that simply says "Do Not Disturb" or something along those lines that does not infer what you are doing in there.  Although, in a middle school these kids should know what breastfeeding is, and should not be put off by the concept...|`|8XcRFF6Taa	No, it's not in bad taste and I don't think you should change it!  I think its cute and hilarious:)  Also it's nice to see a working mother taking the time to give her kids the best:)  Great job!  Whoever has the problem with the sign either A. doesn't have kids or B. their kids definitely weren't breastfed.  Regardless, any nursing mother should be supported, especially when pumping!  It's hard work!  :)|`|FBbaSfUSaa	No!! ha that is a perfect sign. I would talk with your colleges and make sure they know that if you have that sign to make sure any of those with a master key would excuse the room. Now the students, if the door is locked then they should know that you do not to be disturbed.|`|703c83fe1a687f02e99bde09a9966ecfaa	I think whoever said that needs to loosen up.  It's FUNNY.  If you can have a good sense of humor about your own lactation, I don't see why everyone else can't.  I am a lactivist though.  I participated in the Facebook virtual nurse-in  :-)|`|kvHGjd1Raa	It is funny to me!  Keep the sign you have.  How many people said that it was in bad taste?  If too many people complain just put up a basic "I'm busy sign".  Some people are more sensitive than others.|`|OBU1eDUHaa	Too cute!  Bravo for pumping!|`|9aAO1J73aa	not bad tast thats funny|`|7rCeCVl2aa	I think it's really cute BUT no matter where you go there is always that one politically correct person that can't take a joke. <br>  <br>  I would just change it to do not disturb before someone decides to be a jerk and complains to a higher authority. It's a shame but it happens.|`|b978f631fc787a963337206aa3833370aa	It's your office, and you deserve your right to privacy, so ignore whoever said it was in bad taste. You're just doing what you're legally entitled to do and if they have a problem, too bad. Just don't look at the sign then. <br>  The first sign is such a cute idea! <br>  <br>  Congrats!<br>  <br>  PS. Although depending on what mood I was in, my sign would probably just say, "Go away!" LOL
oYmZUO8Caa	True..it's very strong on it's own. Do you need a middle name? True Harlow, maybe? <br>  <br>  I believe a few celebs have named their children True. I'll look it up and post back.<br>  <br>  EDIT:<br>  <br>  <br>  True Isabella Summer Whitaker - parents: Forest Whitaker & Keisha Nash|`|a6Us8qF1aa	Middle names are not necesary, but many have them.  Sources of middle names are to honor another relative like a favor aunt or uncle, a brother or sister, a grandparent.  Some are the maiden names of the mother or grandparent.  A few use the place where the child was born, meaning the town.  Ultimately the choice is yours and your mates decision.<br>  <br>  Myself, I have two middle names.  The second is my mother's maiden name.<br>  <br>  When I was in military service, PFC Garia once told me his whole long name.  This is all I remember of his Spanish name -- Emanual DeMontoya Fernadez Garcia Galoupe Hosea Tansia and I think I forgot one or two.<br>  <br>  Name are suppose to have meaning for the child and the family.  Today, many just choice a name they like, but year ago it was very important and there were rules such as:  1st son named after father, 2nd after parteral grandfather, 3rd after maternal grandfather, 4th after father brother, 5th afer wife's brother, etc and the reverse for daughters.  That was traditional in the 1700's and back.  Some still do it today.  I know some that reuse to name their children after themselves.<br>  <br>  In my family, I am the third James in a row, but my middle name is different than my father's and grandfather's.  However, I am the 6th James in the family since 1750.  And since 1750, in my genealogical family there are 26 Williams, 20 Johns, 12 Georges and so on.  You can the traditional naming practice results showing here.<br>  <br>  I would suggest a baby name book at the library and discuss it with your mate and parents for imput.  The Bible tell how some important Bible heros were named and why.  However, the decision should finally be up to you and your mate.|`|2vtwUAg4aa	I love the name True, but I am not sure it should be a first name. Maybe you should have it as the middle name, or a 'double name' (i am not sure what they are called) like Elizabeth - True ....<br>  <br>  I think Elizabeth, Jessica, Mary, Ann, Sarah etc go quite well, but I am maybe not quite the best when it comes to names lol.<br>  <br>  Sorry if that isn't much help.|`|Ty4UC8GLaa	True Marie.<br>  True Lisa.<br>  True Blair.<br>  <br>  They came into my mind when I heard the name True and I thought they sounded good together.

She wakes up between 6-7am, we play for a little while & then she nurses. Around 8 she has breakfast (we just started adding this on) after that we play for around another hour until she usually gets sleepy...she'll take about a 45 minute nap. After that she's up and ready to play. Around 12 is lunch time (inbetween she nurses every 2 hours still) and then her next nap comes around 3 or 4pm. At 6 she has dinner and then 8pm is bath time and bedtime!! Oh yea, she doesn't sleep through the night yet she usually wakes 2-4 times.

I looked at getting one set up where I work, and the permits and costs to set one up was in the millions. Not to mention that we would have been liable for all of the kids in the daycare. Along with that, some government's labor laws have a stipulation that a daycare need to be equally accessible to all employees.

703c83fe1a687f02e99bde09a9966ecfaa	I've seen them advertised as up to five days before, but they are less and less effective the further out from the expected period you are.  If you haven't missed your period yet, test first thing in the morning when the hcg level will be most concentrated in your urine.<br>  <br>  I have personally been successful the day before, and I did not test in the morning.  There's no harm in taking more tests later, but buy the cheap ones.  It could get expensive.|`|AjqO1aJgaa	Does it matter?<br>  <br>  Save your money and wait a few more days.

What test does 10ml...I want to know :-)|`|KOwzDLPdaa	Even using those tests (earliest is 5 days before period due) it is only 60% accurate. Your accuracy rate will rise everyday. I know is hard to wait but unless you can afford to test everyday, save your money and wait because you don;t want to use the test, get a neg result and fnd out your pregnant three days later!|`|aYCjy8Neaa	I have gotten a faint positive as early as 7 days past ovulation.

Just don't be disappointed if it's negative rigtht now.|`|mc6YtaRbaa	It depends on how much hCG you are producing. If you are making enough for the test to be accurate then you can test up to 5 days prior to your period, if you are not making enough then you will get a false negative.|`|TAnD8dthaa	a few more days<br>  <a href="http://www.fashion4biz.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.fashion4biz.com</a>|`|Mwhclezaaa	The very early tests will show 5-6 days before the first missed period, sometimes.  Please note, at this point the zygote has not even implanted in the uterus and there is a very high chance it will not (up to 80% sometimes) even if you are in the first stages of pregnancy.  This makes many people think they have miscarried, when really the conception did not quite take.  Also, hormone levels vary and even sensitive tests may not detect them until a week or 2 after the missed period in some cases.|`|tUIEWhsUaa	Sometimes 1 day before, depends on the amount of hormones that are in the urine.

I brought my hair dryer and some make up but I never used them lol. Bring underwear ht you are not afraid of ruining.

If you have regular delivery you will only need one or two outfits for the baby.  If you want the baby to take its first picture in a certain outfit bring that as well.  If you want to use you own toiletries you can bring - soap, toothbrush, comfortable clothes to wear home and in the hospital, lotion, under clothes, slippers.  The baby will not need much but a change of clothes, car seat to ride home in and I think that is it.  The hospital will provide the things the baby needs until you leave, like diapers, food if you are not breast feeding and wipes.  So you will not have to worry about that until you get home.  If you plan to give the baby a pacifier you will want to bring that with you. Depends on how cold it is when you leave the hospital the baby will need one to two blankets, but the hospital will wrap the baby up and I think you can take those home with you.|`|mc6YtaRbaa	<a href="http://www.squidoo.com/hospital-bag" rel="nofollow">http://www.squidoo.com/hospital-bag</a><br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.cafemom.com/dailybuzz/pregnancy/1090/Hospital_Bag_Essentials" rel="nofollow">http://www.cafemom.com/dailybuzz/pregnan...</a>|`|C0GpfPYOaa	If you just google it you should be able to find a detailed list, maybe one that you can just print straight off, which will be easier and accurate :)<br>  good luck with your baby!|`|9251a758f62828d922195677756eb083aa	I just had to answer this question! Check with your particular hospital about toiletries, b/c you might be surprised if they do not have shampoo or soap for you! Ours didn't. Also wasn't allowed to labor in anything except hospital gown so only need clothes for after delivery and even then I decided not to ruin my own clothes and stayed in delivery gown. I found I only NEEDED an outfit for baby's trip home and picture if you are so inclined. My hospital let us take all unused diapers, formula and wipes home with us and we had a couple days worth of stuff so it was good to know.  Good Luck!!|`|IPl3Yh1kaa	No no no! Do not take a lot of junk lol. You will be in and out before you know it. Bring 3 lounge/sleeper outfits (you can get them at anywhere from Target to Bloomies) and a pair of slip ons to cruise the maternity ward in.  As far as the baby goes, they generally have everything you need there. If you really want to bring a couple outfits, bring three max. You & your new boo will be chilling 90% of the time. <br>  <br>  I can understand not wanting to look too crazy just in case people come to visit. So bring a little makeup and a hairbrush<br>  <br>  Everything from pads to diapers to blankets will be provided by the hospital. <br>  <br>  Congratulations btw :-)<br>  <br>  EDIT: 4 got about hubby. he should bring a pair of jeans, undies,  and 3 tops if he plans on staying with you in the hospital the whole time. Otherwise just an outfit for the laboring day and he can get clothes when he leaves to go home.

They suck, if anything i would get put on the pill. When I first got mine in i was bleeding for 2 months the doctor said it was normal then it stoped and my periods have been whacked out sense. Every time I start my period or am about to start my stomach turns and does weird things like im pregnant again, and you wont know if you are pregnant or not because a pregnancy test wont tell you, you actually have to go into the doctor to get checked. Im going in on Tuesday to get checked if I am pregnant because the moving in my stomach and hopefully im not because if I am then the baby will be growing in my tubs. Then I can get this thing out!!!! Those are the Cons, really there is not any pros. They make you gain weight too. But I have the Mirena, its kinda the same thing

9a3sNrEqaa	okay heres my story! get ready its long! So I got my positive hpt and had it confirmed via beta hcg @ my ob's office. I went into the hospital that weekend with severe abd pain. My hcg was 3000 and the ER dr didn't listen to me he said I must be farther along that I am. So he sent me for an ultrasound and they found nothing in the uterus. So he said he thinks i am having an ectopic he said 95% chance and there was nothing in the uterus. So i had the surgery and had to go through that and when i woke up the surgeon was like hun there is no ectopic pregnancy. I was shocked. So i had my beta hcg monitored for a while and they started increasing again. I had a scan @ 6 weeks and they could only see a yolk sac and I went back a week later and the fetal pole and h/b were there. So sometimes it takes a while for the u/s to see the developing baby. Your beta hcg is still on the lower side they say it should be over 1000 to see it via ultrasound (ur hcg isn't low like that i mean its not high enough to detect on u/s yet) And even when its very high like mine was at 3,000 its still not 100% that youll see nething yet. So don't lose hope hunni! I know that your nervous and its the worst feeling not to know but all you can do is pray and wait for another ultrasound. whatever you do WAIT if they are suggesting there is no baby for a D&C. TRUST ME ON THIS! Just wait it out! GOOD LUCK HUN!!!! please keep me posted!!!!!!!!!|`|Jjx5WWFvaa	everything you described in question happened to me last june, i was told that the reason that they couldn't see the baby was because the sac had not grew enough for them too see into but that didn't make me feel more reassured.<br>  <br>  about two weeks later i felt a sharp pain and had one tiny spot of blood which was when i knew i was miscarrying but i miscarried naturally so did not receive a dnc but not all people have the terrible cramps like i did or the clotting blood. i would keep on at them if anything for your own piece of mind because you will do nothing but worry until you find out for certain.<br>  <br>  I am writing this to scare you but to help you see that it could be a serious matter or it may well not be but don't rest with the answers they have given you.<br>  <br>  keep me up dated please  hope it is all good news for you.|`|GxJL9UjVaa	dont worry, at 6 weeks it can be very difficult for them to find anything on an u/s.<br>  <br>  Usually (if youre lucky) you mite hear a heartbeat at 8 weeks, but its difficult to pick one up before that.<br>  <br>  I wouldnt worry too much, just relax and take it easy. If you begin to bleed heavily or cramp a lot then u should go back to the docs, but other than that i honestly wouldnt worry too much.<br>  <br>  Good luck, I hope everything goes well for you.x|`|4l5XhmQvaa	you should be calling your dr. back and asking them.. instead of being on yahoo answers.. Not to sound Rude.. but Thats something u should have brought up at the Dr... never leave there with unanswered questions.|`|ad0F70IMaa	There's not much to see that early. I had an ultrasound at 5 weeks 5 days and just saw the sac. You should be fine. I'm currently 14 weeks and still bleeding a little. Dr.'s don't get worried unless the blood has clots and your cramping really bad.|`|ZNhP3mpUaa	Don't let anyone tell you any different. The AVERAGE timeframe of actually hearing the heartbeat is 10 weeks. Anything before that is luck. Most books tell you 10 weeks you'll be able to hear the heartbeat on a dopplar. If you are only 6 weeks, you're HcG levels are still up there, and you haven't passed any huge clots or had severe cramping, i'm sure you're fine. Dr's know more then us here. If s/he said you're uterus feels normal, then I'm sure you're fine. If you have any SEVERE problems, let the doc know, otherwise take care of your body and wait for your 12 week scan! Good luck!|`|627pWyVkaa	You may not be tt far along. or you may have miscarried, or going too... its hard too say. Its best to go back for blood tests and another ultra sound in about a week or two and if they still can't find anything then or your hcg levels start going down then you will know you miscarried. Not every woman "miscarries" naturally, thats why some woman have to go in for D & C's after miscarriages. Your doctor should have told you this, and hopefully re scheduled you for u/s and more blood tests. But it also could be your not as pregnant as you may have thought, sometimes being a week or two less pregnant you wont always see anything at 4-5 weeks. But if you were 6-7 they should have seen a heart beat by then... Mine was seen at 5-6 weeks.. However every pregnancy is different. Just keep going in for tests! Until you get a conclusive answer and try not to stress out in the mean time.|`|f9yORGumaa	You have to remember that you are only 6 weeks along in the pregnancy. If you have a pregnancy book, you will know that a 6 week old baby in utero is just an itty bitty baby. I'm sure that in a few weeks the ultrasound will give you the results you are seeking. I bled a little during my pregnancy too. It's a very scary thing.<br>  <br>  You have my prayers, good luck!|`|GxYtTjUbaa	With my daughter her heartbeat was found a lil later than six weeks.don't worry hun ur fine ur nt miscarryin and their right u would def know.

I know i had concerns because i still havent experienced breast soreness and the NP assured me it was completely normal to have some symptoms and not all.|`|CpiLHcTlaa	some people just don't get it... count yourself lucky... this is my second pregnancy and although this time isn;t as bad as my first I'm still so sick ALL the time. you may still get it. with the first one i got it for a week before i found out (i was probebly around two weeks) then i was fine for the next four weeks.i found out i was pregnant 3 weeks after my week of not being able to eat. so in other words i was about 6 weeks pregnant before it kicked in for me.|`|2S48PpV5aa	I'm 5 weeks going on 6 and I haven't had any morning sickness either, thank goodness! Hopefully we are the lucky ones that don't get it.. My mother-in-law didn't get it at all.. And my mom only got it with her girls, not the boys. I'm hoping it passes me up too. I hear if you are going to get it, it will be in the 6th and 7th weeks, but can be anytime honestly. I feel fine but some smells turn my stomach.. LOL..<br>  Good look, and enjoy pregnancy!!|`|GxJL9UjVaa	It's completly normal for some people not to get any form of sickness at all.<br>  U mite be one of the lucky ones! My sister in law sailed thru her pregnancy with no "morning sickness" at all.<br>  <br>  I on the other hand have been sick from day one, count ur lucky stars if you stay the way u are.|`|ECPdAeHQaa	Hopefully you are a lucky one. I thought so until I reached 6 weeks almost to the day I got extreme nausea. I hated life from then to about 14 weeks pregnant. I am not 17 weeks and it's not gone completely but I do feel a lot lot better.
jd4MzIYtaa	i couldnt help but cry over everything. I am 13 weeks prego and when i was like 6 weeks i went to a restaurant and they messed up on my food and i had a breakdown.My bf was scared for me but i couldnt help it. I have a tendency to cry when i see little children playing or dong something cute. It is tears of joy but it is so weird. Other times i cry for no reason and when something is sad i ball. It is just your hormones and i dont know if it will subside. Like i said i am 13 going on 14 weeks and i am still just as emotional...its normal,your prego!|`|fb7cf9f135155789f589f25b5c08b6c6aa	Its our hormones. I'm about 6 weeks and cry so easily now. I was watching the secret life of bees and I cried. I was reading a book and I cried. Someone at work said something that peed me off and I cried. And to top all of this off .....I am not normally a crier! Ill probably cry just thinking how much of a wimp I am! Damn these pregnancy hormones!!!|`|DksDTsuQaa	yes being emotional is part of pregnancy that's called mood swings .i have them all the time and what i do is try to not let them get to me  i overlook what people say .things will get better, i woke up this morning crying myself and im five weeks also .things will get better good luck|`|mPyN2XX3aa	Completely normal.  It will get better as your hormones even out.  By the time you hit the 2nd trimester you should be (not always though) less emotional.  I'm in my third now and it's a lot better but I still have my episodes.|`|b3XSnPXBaa	Yes its completely normal.  I'm nearly 8 weeks now and mine settled a little this week but are likely to be back up again soon.  It's just your hormones.  Good luck.|`|9DKNSq9daa	Hormones. Get use ti it lol. My daughter is 6 weeks old and still crying over silly thing!!!!|`|ZNhP3mpUaa	Quit being a baby! HA! No, could just be hormonal imbalance. If you are pregnant... your emotions are going to be all over the place for the next 9 months... get used to it now, and good luck!|`|hqogf9oGaa	Oh hunny....it really is normal to feel a little emotional when you have just found out you are pregnant.  Even if you have been trying to conceive it can still come as a bit of a shock when you realise you are pregnant and everything is about to change.  Not to mention the hormones that are raging through your body at the moment.  The best thing to do is go with it and let it out.<br>  <br>  The good news is that your hormones (and hopefully your emotions) will level out at around 12 weeks when the placenta takes over production of hormones.<br>  <br>  Until then make sure your boyfriend knows that you can't really control your tears at the moment and the best thing he can do is give you a big hug!<br>  <br>  Congrats!<br>  <br>  Indigo<br>  <br>  xxx|`|ezMoS0mqaa	yes i'm the same, i'm almost 7 weeks and most of the time i don't even know why i am crying. I think it's a combination of all the overwhelming feelings about how your life is going to change on top of all thse mad hormones. Speak to any other pregnant woman and i'm sure she will tell you the same. You have to try and just go with it and expect you are going to feel quite emotional- don't feel bad about feeling anything at this point.|`|2274dcf5eba0ee2ef3aabbe2c8b0a89daa	i was like that also, super bad. crying all the time and then around 16 weeks it slowed down. i started realizing i was crying about nothing. except tv, that still makes me cry..<br>  just try to keep your stress down, take a deep breath and it will get better..<br>  <br>  congrats buy the way|`|gTiQLYCZaa	its the hormones hun<br>  i cry at things even when ive just got my period because of the hormones lol|`|mc6YtaRbaa	Welcome to pregnancy! That's just part of it!
GFzDwIk6aa	Sticking sticks seems like a good idea.<br>  You could make it 3D using this pyramid template <a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_w-FuADvdI0c/SLBBg5N1pVI/AAAAAAAAAgc/Ph4ojANp2x8/s320/Pyramid+Box+template.jpg" rel="nofollow">http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_w-FuADvdI0c/SL...</a>|`|sz5J9V6aaa	You could put glitter on it and sequins and outline the triangles in glitter glue.|`|hR1LlS2Haa	Make it with candy bars !!!
bAp35x7uaa	Contrary to popular belief, home pregnancy tests are far more sensitive than the 25miu sticks used at the doctors.   I had a negative test at the docs a day after my period was due - I'd had my first very faint BFP   6 days before<br>  using an ultra early 10miu HPT<br>  <br>  False positives are incredibly rare so unless you have health issues that could cause one, you ARE pregnant and your doctor needs to stop messing about with wee sticks and give you a blood test pronto. <br>  <br>  Good luck! xx|`|A1S5KNUkaa	OK I've put a link to a pic showing my positive results....VERY faint positive results but positive nonetheless (just for all the people saying you're definitely not pregnant!)  <br>  <br>  I definitely think you should go get a blood test done...when you go to your GP take the positive results you have to show them.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/32974814@N05/3079171049/in/photostream/" rel="nofollow">http://www.flickr.com/photos/32974814@N0...</a><br>  <br>  Hope you get the result you want x x x|`|FcHplZtQaa	If a tests been positive then I'd say you were pregnant, maybe your body just isn't producing a lot of pregnancy hormones, wait another week or 2 and try again!|`|pVWk12oOaa	Since the test the Dr gave you was also a urine test, I wouldn't necessarily say that you're 100% not pregnant. You should ask to get a blood test, then you'll know for sure!  It's rare to get a false positive (because the hormone HAS to be there to show up as positive) but maybe your HCG levels are just so low that it's just showing up on most of the tests.  I'd say get a blood test to know for sure!  Good luck!!|`|pcdEb8kMaa	I never had luck with preg test.My OBGYN done blood work and it showed up preg when the pee test never showed anything. Two pregnancies and those pee test never worked just the blood work test. Ask your doc to do blood work to see if you are it will be your best bet.Best of luck!|`|159e15bc29abe3e551d868753b39f233aa	I would say feb 14th is +... wow the others not sure. there is a line but barely. Try testing without drinking or peeing for 2 hours before. The reason why its soo light is because your drinking too much before testing. try that ... might be darker.|`|mc6YtaRbaa	Most importantly you need to make sure you are taking the tests with your first mornings urine. If you pee or drink anything prior to taking the test you can loose you most concentrated hCG resulting in a false negative. If you get a urine test from a Dr. then yes it can be wrong, as they are the same ones you buy in the store. Your best bet is to ask for a blood test so you know for sure. All that being said, I do see faint lines and a faint line is still a line so I would guess that you are pregnant!|`|x8JRkRNkaa	Unfortunately a lot of pregnancy end very early. It looks like you were pregnant and for some reason the pregnancy did not take. Those first two tests were without a doubt positive. It's really really rare, but they could have been defective tests. Either way, if the blood test came out negative at this point I would rule out a pregnancy.|`|260f178c6fc34e7d0c73b917e2a51e55aa	well i definately see  two lines on the first and second tests, but if all the others are saying negative and even the hospital one is i really dont know what to say, i hope you find out real soon, it must really be frustrating!!!<br>  <br>  xx|`|5deb28fe9fecaef7f55e1f593df11203aa	Wow!! I think you preg, your doc need to do a blood test and maybe get you in for an early scan, good luck|`|71426c90338c6daa00b5005f598c343aaa	Wow, how confusing!<br>  <br>  A couple of things to think about....<br>  <br>  Did you use your first urine of the morning for all of the tests?  If not, the levels may just have been too low to register on some...<br>  <br>  Did the tests show up immediately with the 2 lines?  If not, they could be evaporation lines...<br>  <br>  Have you had any bleeding inbetween or anything that could have been a miscarriage?<br>  <br>  Do you know when you ovulated?  You could just have ovulated late, and so be quite early on in pregnancy...<br>  <br>  I got a negative when my period was a week late, then I got a positive 3 days later, but it was very faint, it looked exactly like your second test, but I am definitely pregnant, I have seen baby and heard the heartbeat :D<br>  <br>  I think you probably are pregnant, but still have low Hgc levels, because there are certainly lines on some of the tests, especially the second one, and if there was no bleeding inbetween, you won't have miscarried.<br>  <br>  Why don't you either ask for a blood test or an ultrasound from your doctor to make sure?  I really don't think they should be messing you around!  You should take in the tests to show them.<br>  <br>  Good luck and I hope it is a +!!!<br>  <br>  *Mummy to Alex, 6, Encarni, 1 and due 29 Aug*|`|GxYtTjUbaa	Honey YOUR PREGNANT!!! Congrats there's no such thing as a falso positive but there is a such thing as a false neg. Ur hcg levels may be very low. Some women are like tht. My friend couldn tell until she was three month prego strt takin prenatls and have an ultra sound done. Thts the only explination for negative results cuz u cnt get positive and it b wrong. Cuz with this pregnancy I got negative result I tested twice and got negative and waited and took another it was posotive.|`|IfyjeV4Raa	If you get a positive then you are in fact pregnant but my guess would be this....You may not be producing hcg like you normally would. Most people's hormone levels double every couple of days. In some cases women whos levels don't end up miscarrying unfortunately. The hospital may have run what they call an quantitative test which only picks up around 25hcg which is what an early hpt would. If they ran a qualitative test it would pick up the exact amount of hormone to the number. I'm sorry this may be a case where you may miscarry. I hope for your sake that I'm wrong|`|b6qe5syVaa	when my mom was prego with me she took like 6 urine samples (between herself and her doctor) and all kept coming up negative. Go to either your doctor or local health dept and tell them your situation, and that you need a blood test!  thats what they had to do for my mom, and it finally came back positive.  Pregnancy blood test is a for sure answer. if you think you are- thats what i would do.  But from the looks of your tests its prolly a negative...?  only sure way is a blood test.|`|JDw1RDcaaa	i would say u aren't pregnant there is something else wrong, but i didnt get a positive result on a test untili was 14 weeks but i was still having my period so the doctors said that was the reason.<br>  <br>  retest in about 2 weeks if u still haven't had a period and then go to the doctors|`|ewswVOrTaa	I had a negative urine test from the doctor first time, I just KNEW I was pregnant (had similar positive/negative home test shenanigans), the doctor tested me again a week later and it was positive.<br>  <br>  You are not imagining it - there are lines on at least two of those tests!!!<br>  <br>  Good luck.|`|JMlDlTpPaa	i would go to the doctor or wait about anothe week and test again bc if its saying u r then i think you r but idk becausr its coming uo neg. altho alot of ppl  say that test turn out neg are pos bc wen i was pregnantthe first test i took was neg then it was positive|`|ZnwKjH6waa	Was the test your doctor ordered a blood test?? get a blood test!!! i was unsure about my faint lines on my HPT's and so a blood test the next day n got my positive a day later!!! GL... hope u get the results ur lookin 4!!!!|`|RR35cmBdaa	i would go the doctors and ask for a scan its the only other think to try best of luck|`|4b58d642d6c0c0bb9d0fb9123be4e380aa	looks like ur not pregnant hun is this the test that if u have a cross ur pregnant if not i duno xxx gud luck baby dust|`|hIzQyflqaa	i dont know why people are saying your not pregnant, i can see lines on all of them, you are pregnant! congrats|`|X7DDlR1caa	doesn't look like you are to me, you ought to go to the doctors and ask them. That's confusing sorry i couldn't help much.|`|cAY3Z9wLaa	never seen that before! GO to the doctors to be sure. sounds possitive if u r that late!|`|FoDimTxCaa	My test with my second baby looked like that - and I was DEFINITELY pregnant! Obviously lol.<br>  <br>  If your last period was 20th December you could feasibly be only 5 weeks pregnant now - if the test done at the docs was a urine test it is possible that there wasn't enough HCG present at the time for his test to detect? Maybe if you are still waiting for a period in a weeks time you should go back and take an early morning sample with you. <br>  <br>  You have 3 positive tests out of 9 so my instinct would be that you are pregnant but not producing much HCG yet. I only say this because the tests have to detect at least SOME of the hormone to produce a positive result.|`|aYCjy8Neaa	I still think its a possibility that you could be pregnant. Heres why, you said that all the tests that you took first on the days that you got a positive then a negative the negatives were taken later in the day. You got your faint positives with first morning urine i'm assuming. To get a faint positive means that your HCG level is very low. Meaning your pregnancy could still be early. I got a very faint positive with my son, almost didn't see it hubby caught it after i threw it away, and now I am 35 weeks. False positives are VERY rare, while false negatives are far more common. Did your doctor do a blood test or urine? That test could still be wrong. The only other explanation would be that you were pregnant and that you could have lost the pregnancy. Buy a digital test, wait a few days, and then make sure you take the test using your first morning urine. It will be the most potent and you will get a def. positive or negative with a digital test. Hope this helps!! Good luck!|`|fb7cf9f135155789f589f25b5c08b6c6aa	I see the two lines in the first two tests..however u said u waited six minutes before reading them? What sort of test did u take? Usually three minutes is the max. Also...if u took a clear blue digital and went to the doc and they both said negative...it probably means that you are not pregnant. Even if u had a miscarriage the tests would prolly still show up positive for the next week or so. I hope this helps.good luck!
UFu0h8SKaa	yes it does sound like a lubrication thing. your hormone's might be making you a bit dry|`|wiAVa1H5aa	Could you have a bladder infection?|`|ZncV5gc0aa	You probably have the beginnings of a yeast infection and they can sneak up on you and bite hard when you are pregnant so you may want to start a treatment.|`|v3LnJycKaa	When you are pregnant the PH in your vagina become unbalenced very easily, you could have a VERY mild yeat infection (not noticible by any other symptoms) I had this for nearly 2 weeks before my dr let me know this is what it was.|`|8oAlBL91aa	Its probably because you were a little to dry, it's happened to me nothing to worry about, try some extra lube next time.|`|6yqReVEZaa	Go to a doctor and he'll reassure you that it's nothing serious.<br>  Bye|`|AA12395149	Yes, the extra blood and engorgement going on down there does make it more sensitive.  As long as you aren't cramping and don't have more than spotting and the burning sensation went away, you should be fine.  Next time, try getting up and cleaning up with a cool water or a cool damn rag.|`|1xCBR1aBaa	it's either an infection of some type or your cervix may be irrirated.<br>  I'd call your doctor and let them know what's going on.|`|WSXDQ4bpaa	It could just be irritation if you are not using lubrication if you got a bit dry during it. The best way to find out if you are concerned is to ask at your next doct. appt.|`|58JgbttAaa	did it burn when you went to the bathroom right after sex? because if it did it might be a urinary tract infection.|`|7DG99jUnaa	take a blood test to be safe.check for std.you have to think for both you and your baby
T8ksKCWCaa	Eliminate fluoride from your diet.|`|shKc7lZcaa	The One a Day that you are taking is good, that is what my husband is taking.  I also give him a zinc tablet every couple of days.  I've heard that is supposed to help with sperm motility.  I don't give it to him everyday though, too much zinc can be a little dangerous (I've heard).  Good luck!!<br>  Also, make sure to avoid hot baths & tight undies!

IDS64Eh8aa	A baby can eat normal (cooked) food after 6 months of age and by then you can actually use normal whole milk for cooking (not for drinking, though)|`|JsEd4H0raa	My neighbor when her son was under a year old. He's now 3. She mixed breast milk with his oatmeal/cereal stuff and only the food he was eating only. He seemed to like it. Only because he loved to nurse. Constantly. She always gave him food off of their plates even though they used regular milk and he loved it. She just only used breast milk when he was under a year old with just food he was eating only. I believe she is now doing it for her daughter too. I wouldn't put breast milk in your food. Just put it in your child's food if you would like to.|`|FLEXqVoiaa	I think most of those questions were coming from breastfeeding nazis/trolls. I've always heard that if breast milk is heated to too high a temperature or shaken it looses many of it's nutrients, so I guess there's no real benefit is using it to cook. And there are alternatives to cow's milk-Soy milk, goats milk.|`|h85kkDsbaa	My health visitor has just told me this morning to use full fat cows milk in cooking. as long as your baby is over six months then you can do this.|`|oKiW2JwNaa	you can use regular cows milk in cooking once you start weaning. when we started weaning i was going to pump and then i realised that there's actually a lot of milk needed to make something like cheese sauce (my son loved it!!) so i gave up on that idea. for a while i used formula (simply because it didn't go bad in the fridge because i would only use it once a week or so) and then later on when my son started drinking cows milk at one year i just started using it for cooking as well. but its up to you if you feel like pumping loads or if you just start using cows milk. as long as baby is drinking breast or formula the rest of the time, it's fine.|`|6e17cb76a30c03f25817ad13d8880dacaa	I know you can use it to make cereal for the baby. But to make your food with it no.|`|60b853fe7d4335e1b74668b328b358b7aa	I answered one of those questions just yesterday.  : )<br>  <br>  I always used breast milk for making oatmeal for my son when he was younger and I was breast feeding.  Cow's milk is perfectly fine for this too.  If a baby is old enough to eat, they are old enough to digest a small amount of cows milk when it's cooked into their food.|`|eabe4c3a6e53ede1a2078c8d7dfcf4b7aa	you can use real milk in cooking for your child...it's fine. they just can digest a ton of milk until 1 year (or close enough to it) but a little used in cooking or like in cheese is fine
PN7ELn3aaa	My little sister had this same problem until she was about the same age. My mom bought baby wipes for her for a little while so she could feel cleaner and get a better wipe. Once she was comfortable with that my mom made TP shopping "fun" by letting her pick out her own TP. (The bear one was always good lol). It sounds silly, but it worked!|`|1G3XPiq3aa	When my daughter was learning, I folded the toilet paper for her, and left it in a pile beside the toilet. I also got her a stool so there's not such a big drop between the seat and the ground, and it makes standing up and sitting back down on the toilet easier. <br>  <br>  To encourage her to try, I told her all her friends at pre-school were able to.|`|AA11109728	Leave her on the potty til she does it herself!  I've gotten in the habit of doing it for my daughter out of sheer convenience - I'm usually running late or something and it just seems easier.  So she's gotten used to that.  However, she will do it on her own other places, say at preschool and at the sitter's with no problem.  So I know she CAN, she just doesn't want to at home.  If we are home in the evening and I'm busy getting dinner and such, and she goes potty, I will tell her she can do it herself.  Sometimes she will have an all-out crying fit, but if I persist and don't go in the bathroom and she knows I'm not going to, she will end up doing it herself, even if she's crying the whole time while doing it.  I also offered to double check to make sure she is clean, sometimes she takes me up on it and sometimes she doesn't.  She must be getting better because when I do her laundry I notice her underpants have been a bit cleaner.|`|9DtJeAUKaa	That's still a young enough age it's not unheard of for a child to be asking for help w/ that. No one enjoys it, but you may have to continue doing it awhile. Joys of parenthood, huh?! lol<br>  <br>  You could try getting some of that wet toilet paper w/ aloe, you can even buy the dispenser for your toilet paper holder. Maybe she will be fascinated w/ it & try it. Or you could keep wet wipes by her potty & maybe she would use those. Or maybe buy toilet paper w/ cute animal or kid patterns. Make a chart to hang in the bathroom & when she does it herself, give a sticker & set an agenda for rewards ~ like either after each time or at the end of the week if her chart has stickers the whole week.

bc29eaf19302ac3e6d0492b8facf1027aa	That's really common and normal.  It can begin to go away and then start right back up again.  It's related to your activity level, and is a sign that you might want to take it a bit easy, at least reduce the amount of activity you're doing.  Mine does that for about 12 weeks after delivery.|`|723QHuicaa	I would contact your dr or health visitor, increased discharge can be sign of infection.|`|sbeoF50gaa	Those blood clots are so gross! And yea that happen to me after I had my kid. On and off again and gross nasty blood clots,  even huge ones! Like ew where does this come from. No worries! but if you are still concerned go see your Dr. You can even call your Dr. and ask them questions without making an apt. If it's something to be concerned about they will call you in.|`|I5C917Qdaa	they are normail, when they are the size of a softbaqll, then its time to be concerned
eytlIKITaa	It's called implantation bleeding...  it's when the fertilized egg is implanted into the uterine lining...  it usually happens 7-10 days after fertilization...<br>  <br>  And it's not all that common, it depends on the woman...

mCDopsLEaa	I think you are pregnant but you aren't registering enough hcg for the hpt to detect. You probably just need to go ahead and make a doctors appointment and get a blood test done. You are well past your period date.|`|D5fw6Cosaa	I am having the same feelings....I would take a test and see what happens - you have missed your period - so that is a great sign!!!!|`|buI2TVpvaa	Only a test can prove if u are preg or not.
wiAVa1H5aa	Ovulation means that your period is 14 days away if you don't get pregnant, count from the day of egg white mucus (from your cervix, not the opening of your vagina since that takes half a day.   It might take longer then 14 days to test positive if you are pregnant, some women don't test early.|`|c65526ea03a8624f0b023c9a6db67ec0aa	When I found out I was pregnant with my son, I tested 2 weeks after we had intercourse. I had an inkling that we concieved on May 23rd 2008 and I took a test on June7th and got my Big Fat Positive.<br>  I think you should wait 2 weeks after you ovulate or after you have intercourse with your hubby. If you don't know which day to count from , start from the last fertile day or the last time yuo and your hubby BD'd GOOD LUCK!|`|oUcLSDZ6aa	My fingers are crossed for you, and myself too =)<br>  I'm 2 days late, and still waiting for my positive (2 negatives so far, but I tested a little early). <br>  <br>  Good Luck!|`|4V4m2uZ5aa	Hey!<br>  <br>  I really don't have an answer for you, Sorry. Just wanted to give you lots of baby dust and say good luck!!!!|`|ESAM0U7xaa	def sounds like you know what you're doing :)<br>  keep your fingers crossed because it sounds like you have a good shot! after ovulation your period usually comes in 2-3 weeks, depending on your cycle. i'm 28 day and my comes 2 weeks after ov. <br>  so to give you some info that i know...<br>  fertilization can occur 1-3 days after ovulation...then the fertilized egg has to attach itself to the uterus in order to become a successful pregnancy. this can take another 3 days or so....your looking about 6-10 days total. the best time to take HPT is the day before your period but it could still come up negative. <br>  don't stress or you will NOT start on time regardless. just take it easy and wait patiently!!!<br>  <br>  GOOD LUCK!|`|tUIEWhsUaa	I got one question?

krQiDGCHaa	Take her to the doctor and tell them about it.<br>  <br>  Teeth grinding is pretty common, but it is NOT good for your daughter's teeth.  Most likely they will give you a mouth guard to have her wear while she's sleeping so that she doesn't grind her teeth.|`|DcVoq5Tuaa	my kids frind their teeth, their dentist said it wouldn't be advised to have a mouth guard at their young age since the jaw line is ever changing. They need to be at lest 8 before things stop moving on a regular basis. It's not anything to worry about at this time. If and when they are older and have severe jaw pain and tooth problems, have it looked at.|`|PEVkrOVVaa	Please take her to a doctor.  Teeth will get damaged by continuous grinding.  It could be another problem as well.  My son use to grind his teeth, he had epilepsy.  I am not saying that it can be a symptoms but it is better to make sure and get it checked.|`|dQ4XwT95aa	You need to take her to the dentist and they will make her a guard to sleep in so she doesn't continue to damage her teeth.
JjBwydymaa	hell hun,<br>  <br>  yes that happened to me this month! I had my period which lasted 8 days (very normal for me) two days later... I had a very heavy bleed..that lasted a day!<br>  <br>  Very strange... But doctor told me i may be a sufferer of PCOS from the symtoms I have.. But I havnt had any tests done to properly diagnose it. So it i just assumed it was realted to that! <br>  <br>  Maybe you should go too your doctor and get him to run a few tests on you to know for sure. <br>  <br>  Good luck TTC by the way.. Lots of baby dust to you! x|`|buI2TVpvaa	Hav not heard of this.|`|S5n5Za78aa	yes too me but thats because i have pcos and have irregular periods so with that you get your period too frequently or not often but it wasnt accually a period it was just my lining sheding because my hormones were jacked up but you should see your doctor because its not normal and unless you have been diagnoised with something like endometriosis or pcos then see OB right away
1G3XPiq3aa	It's perfectly normal too be more sexually active when you're pregnant and quite safe, so long as you're careful about not being too rough. <br>  <br>  However, you kind of have to respect your partners feelings about it too. =( Perhaps you could ask your doctor or midwife to explain to him that it's not going to harm the baby?|`|mc6YtaRbaa	Unless your Dr. tells you not to have sex due to a high risk pregnancy then it is safe to use sex toys as long as you clean them, like we all hope you normally would! :)|`|AA12395149	If you are cleared to have sex, you are cleared to masturbate, even with toys.  Just be aware that sometimes a masturbatory orgasm can be more intense than a sexual orgasm and make it more likely for you to cramp after.  If this happens, hydrate and rest after, it should pass within an hour.  <br>  <br>  You should take your partner with you to an appointment and let him talk to your doctor about sex in pregnancy so he can feel assured that he won't hurt you or the baby (and no, the baby can't see his penis coming at him, there's a whole cervix in the way)<br>  <br>  Best of luck and lots of fun!|`|3CG3rby0aa	Yes just don't use it too long as you can make yourself raw and it would take longer to heal.  and make sure you use plenty of lubrication too.  Other than that ask your doctor if you still worry about it. good luck.:)|`|GxYtTjUbaa	Yes you can. It has no chemicals ect anything like tht. So yes of course have fun|`|sIty3Edyaa	which rampant rabbit is it....<br>  i can check x|`|AA12121990	Yeah vibrators are fine in pregnancy, except near the end they can give you a little pelvic pain (so just don't over do it)
1KIwM1uOaa	My mother in law wanted a girl so bad and she kept trying and ended up with 7 boys before she finally gave up.  When the grand kids started coming of course she wanted girls and most are girls.<br>  <br>  My mom wanted granddaughters because it was easier for her to relate to them.  They would go shopping, cook, plant flowers, play dress up all of that but things you would never catch my son wanting to do, instead he is with grandpa on the 4 wheeler, shooting guns or hunting.<br>  <br>  The best thing to do is tell your mom that yes a girl would be nice but it is nicer to be able to provide for the kids you have so boys is what she gets and she can blame your husband because it is his fault their is no girls!  Then tell her someday the boys will be dating and then she will have granddaughters.|`|60b853fe7d4335e1b74668b328b358b7aa	I am feeling your pain here!!!  I don't get it either!<br>  What irked me the most was the "oh, I'm so sorry" comments from others when I told them that baby #2 was another boy.  WTH are you sorry for??????  Thanks for letting me vent, lol.|`|VHHis05Naa	Like it's your fault!  You had three beautiful boys.  What would she like you to do?  Keep trying until you have a girl?  What if you end up with 7 boys and 1 girl?  Your mom chose to have one child, so it's incredibly strange and unfair that she's pushing you to have more kids.|`|b978f631fc787a963337206aa3833370aa	Tell her that unless she's willing to get pregnant again, you're happy with your sons and that's it. It's your fertility, not hers, and she will just have to be happy with the wonderful, beautiful grandchildren she has! If she's really getting to you about it, just tell her point blank. I mean, telling someone who doesn't really want more children just to have one because you want a female grandchild is sort of the wrong motivation, in my opinion. LOL You could also say, "Well, you should have had more children than just me then!" and see what she says. LOL|`|723QHuicaa	Well, its natural to want a different sex to the majority of the one you have. My aunt had 4 boys and gave up trying for a girl - doesnt mean she loves her boys any less. My sister's first born was a boy, she was happy when she fell pregnant again with a girl.<br>  <br>  Its just wanting a different experience. My MIL had 3 boys, and was so happy when we had a girl because she got to go shopping for pretty dresses and stuff.|`|f27c7ae986058c646a62a0a9855a77f3aa	She probably wants to see a little girl again. Like when you were little. If you really don't want to have a other child don't. Its not her decision its yours.|`|1tmX7xbRaa	i don't know what the issue is. as long as the kids are healthy that's all that should matter. what bothers me more is when people tell me how many kids i should or shouldn't have.|`|pUvEmPrCaa	It is nice to have one of each gender to raise and to have around because they both bring such different things to the table.  Usually the mothers and grandmothers want a little girl to raise.  <br>  <br>  However, if it doesn't happen naturally, it's not a big deal.  There is nothing wrong with having 3 boys of 7 boys.  Either way they are still your children and they are still going to show you the same love and you are still going to show them the same love.  It's not like a daughter would be better than the sons that you already have.<br>  <br>  I think you're doing the right thing by accepting the fact that you have 3 beautiful boys and you just didn't get a daughter.  If you would really like a daughter and a fourth child, than feel free to try with your husband.  Just make sure that you and your mother know that you could just as easily get another son rather than a daughter.  It's actually more common.|`|wZAeBisbaa	It's normal to want children or grandchildren of both genders.  I think many women, especially, enjoy the idea of dressing up a little girl in cute clothes or giving her some of the toys that they themselves would like.  I gave my daughters the American Girl dolls in part because I liked them myself.  I could never identify with my son in quite the same way.<br>  <br>  But of course you're right - having beautiful healthy kids of either gender is enough to be thankful for, and your mother will accept it too. It may just take time.|`|IoQF4g1Gaa	When I become a Grandmama, I don't really care what genders my grandkids have, as long as they're healthy & happy!! :)<br>  <br>  Lol, My mother-in-law is just like your mother!! My husband was her only child and we had all girls at the time and she kept nagging us nonstop for a little boy! She was SO exited that when she found out we were pregnant with Max! Now that she knows I'm pregnant again, She wants another boy to "Even things out" haha!<br>  <br>  I agree with you, The gender doesn't matter. She should be grateful that she has 3 beautiful grandsons! I would suggest ignoring the complaints, and just live your life! :) Good Luck!|`|WQ8P57o3aa	I can see where she is coming from..I guess she just wants that little girl drandaughter to treat as a princess if you know what I mean, treat to pink things and all that, and someone she can have more in common with when the child gets older.<br>  <br>  Seeings as you are her only source of a grandchild, she probably wants you to have one of each gender because there is no other child of hers to provide this.|`|4l5XhmQvaa	after 3 boys.. bringing a daughter will stir up the mix! My cousin has 3 older brothers and they never let her do anything... always trying to be protective. Bossing her around.. etc. <br>  <br>  As far as what your Mother wants, I mean she isnt the one having the kids.. She should be happy that you have 3 beautiful boys.. and not pushing you to have a daughter.. like If you can decide what you give birth to... could u emagine if you had another boy? u might feel let down.. U dont want to deal with all that.. to much nonsence. if you are happy with the family you got... then she will get over it ;]|`|0e0a0f1828f99f87ea3d5e5bc8cbd46daa	No, there is no point. Your mother is just being selfish. Boys or girls, they both bring joy to your life and that of grandparent. Enough said, she is overreacting.|`|03n14OLLaa	Tell you she already had a girl- You! and that now she has boys and that she should just love them and accept that you are done having kids. Good Luck!
fYMWDQLGaa	it must be stress. if u had sex on ovulation days and u r on TTC dont be so stressful... relax and stay calm. stress is not good if u r pregnant. listen to music and get away from that mon'stress'. (meant monster hehe lol )|`|ad0F70IMaa	stress can cause your period to come late. Wait about a week and take another test. It should show an accurate result by then.|`|b20d252d0779b2e2744a52eb38f8260faa	Most likely stress. Chill out and give it a few days. Your symptoms are not going to be exactly the same every month. Those things change throughout your life. At 36, the signs that I'm about to start are completely different from when I was 30, or 28, or 18. From my own personal experience, the length of time it takes to start your period when you think you might be pregnant has a direct correlation to the amount of money you have spent on pregnancy tests that you didn't really need in the first place. In other words, you'll probably start any day. It's not likely to have two separate false negative tests back to back.|`|ECPdAeHQaa	How would we know by the information given?<br>  You will know in a few days if it doesn't come go take a test.
krQiDGCHaa	You can spoon one another.<br>  <br>  Typically, they recommend doggy style (or, from behind on your knees) for pregnant women.  If that doesn't work for her, spooning is best.<br>  <br>  Both of you lay on your sides, with your front to her back and enter her that way.  Then, no one is supporting anyone else's weight, and you still get great entry. :)|`|cbfb39e3aab3b803822e39f849209291aa	Only one i know would be spooning but you say that hurts her.There not many positions you can really do without it causing discomfort to her.|`|oUcLSDZ6aa	Try sitting in a chair instead of laying down, and let her be on top. Also, I know it's kind of a downer, since she's already pregnant, but use a condom, it will minimize the pleasure for you so you might last a little longer.  <br>  <br>  You could also try having her sit (on a table, counter, couch etc...) while you stand or kneel, this way she's not on top, or laying down.|`|HvbIE03saa	For pregnancies, they typically suggest her on top or doggy style...if that's too uncomfortable for her, she can try leaning over a counter to help steady her.|`|hIzQyflqaa	spooning is all i can do!

53015cf51c5f798dab95e8e9aa0f9d05aa	there is always a chance when late.. you could be prego or you could possibly have a UTI which can and will make your pd.'s late.. i had one a few months ago and i think i was 5-7 days late for my pd. <br>  you could always test in a week to see if you are pregnant.. thats what i would do, wait one more week to get your pd. and if it still doesnt come then take a test.|`|yea2hci5aa	I would take a hpt.  Either that or you could take a blood test at your doctor's office.  Every woman is different so some women don't feel any symptoms and other's have a list of symptoms.<br>  <br>  Best of luck to yea!|`|Sz7cnFRsaa	not every one gets syptoms of been pregnant.

Hope it works out for you =)|`|pxoTNYpCaa	either you're pregnant or you ovulated late this cycle.  So if a test is negative than chances are it's due to when you ovulated.  Since you probably don't chart you bbt, a test is the only way to know for sure!|`|OVZgQOkyaa	thats weird auzzies call it a period never heard that one lol|`|KWPnoqGMaa	YES!! there is a big chance you can be pregnant! frequent trips to the bathroom is a early sign of pregnancy..i also had frequent trips to the bathroom before i found out i was pregnant!! :) and when i found out a had a late period i took a pregnancy test yesterday to make sure..and it came out positive..that's because my cycle is always regular..so it also depends on the person as well!! but i would definitely take a test asap....GOOD LOOK...<br>  <br>  ima month and 1 week
chmuDZObaa	It's probably pretty likely you'll go to 37 weeks, which is considered full term but you probably won't make it to 40.  Rest assured, if you got the steroids and they were able to delay labor (even by a few days) then your baby has an excellent chance of being healthy if you deliver now.|`|67QVKHQ3aa	I think your gonna have a baby REAL soon!|`|gRtmFa1maa	Full term is 37 weeks plus...your almost there. Even if you were to go now, chances are everything will be just fine. The steriod shots will help mature your babies lungs faster, so if he does come a little early..his lungs will be ready to go.<br>  <br>  good luck!|`|Fb0wSA1Gaa	hmmm...its hard to say. But good news,and I'm sure you have been told this, even if you have your baby now, he would be healthy and fine. anything under 34 weeks is considered to be premie, so therefore I wouldnt worry too much! Congrats, I can't wait to be a mother!|`|m0DgqEcjaa	my daughter was born at 36 weeks, she weighed 6lbs9oz and was healthy so i wouldn't worry too much if you don't last full term. Good luck though!|`|igPBuDHkaa	my mum give birth to all her 6 kids 6 weeks early we were fine and healthy am sure if anything was wrong they would induce you just relax and rest loads x|`|AA12395149	Preterm labor is a difficult thing to predict.  I've had patients where we stopped their contractions and then they go to post dates.  So you could either go early, or you could go all the way and then some.  I'm sure you've been put on bed rest and possibly a medicine to take at home to stop contractions, so just follow your doctors orders so that you may complete your pregnancy as close to term as possible.  <br>  <br>  If the pink discharge continues or increases to be like the second day of your period, you need to be checked out.  One occurrence of pink discharge is probably more likely from your cervix being checked at the hospital.<br>  <br>  Best of luck.|`|rxKP7NqSaa	Sounds like you might have had your bloody show.<br>  I wouldn'tworry if you have your baby now it will be fine I had my daughter at 28 weeks and the Drs said to me that if I had have had her at 32-35 weeks she would have been ok.<br>  GoodLuck I'm sure you will be ok.|`|h5cFkP35aa	you probably wont last full term with low fluid but 35 weeks gives your baby a great chance of survival. make sure you're ready!|`|1939q5Tgaa	maybe if your on full bed rest.
a8Pq2Lmdaa	I would tell your teacher.  Tell her that you are trying to take the best care of it, but are worried that it is not eating.  You do not want to fail.  If there is something wrong with the doll, your teacher can reset it again or at least take into consideration that you were trying to feed it, just in case it did not register.<br>  Treat your teacher like a "doctor".  If you have any questions that you would ask a doctor, ask your teacher.  Unlike real babies, Baby Think It Over Dolls come with a manual you can refer to if something just doesn't seem right.<br>  <br>  Good Luck with your precious little (fake) bundle. :)<br>  <br>  <br>  Sorry, I just re-read your question and the additional info.  <br>  It should make a sucking noise.<br>  <br>  Read through this:<br>  <br>  <a href="http://justagirlintheworld.com/baby-think-it-over/" rel="nofollow">http://justagirlintheworld.com/baby-thin...</a>|`|mk2600Y3aa	I had one of those when i was 16. Mine did make a noise when it fed. I think there might be something wrong with it. Out of the whole class there was nothing like that reported back to the teacher. One had colic, that was about it. But i think it should make a noise. Get it checked out if you can. Hope this helps.|`|7kosr9mcaa	The one I had made a suckling noise when it was feeding|`|c73QkZ2haa	I think once they die they have to be reset. Your probably going to have to take it to your teacher and admit it died if you didnt already get it reset.<br>  <br>  I dont remember it making a noise when i had one in highschool it usually just cried or was quiet.<br>  Well im wrong! Go see your teacher you dont want to fail cause your dolls broke :D
UKHDlvM5aa	Anything's possible, but it's VERY unlikely. I wouldn't worry about it if I were you. In the future, use a condom every time to be extra safe (even when you're on your period and your boyfriend pulls out early).|`|67QVKHQ3aa	not very likely hun, i takes sperm to get pregnant...|`|dnG7fhnbaa	Highly unlikely to none...unless nature feels like being a b*tch...lol. There's always a chance if you have unprotected sex...but I'd say if you were actually on your period and he didn't come there's probably only a 0.02% chance or something!|`|AA12213910	Period=slim chances<br>  Unprotected sex=big chances <br>  <br>  How are u certain he did not come, even without his pre-***? Next time do wear a condom for safety.|`|zZiWxkiGaa	possible, but not probable|`|RvSHQtrXaa	A slim chance.|`|YehcUSkoaa	honey, if you didn't use a condom or other contraceptive, then you have just as much likely hood as a girl whose bf DID ejaculate.  If you don't want to get pregnant, use contraceptives (assuming your religion permits it).  If your religion does not permit contraceptives, then you should even be doing this until marriage.  Any way...you have a 50/50 chance like the rest of us.  Play safe, darling.|`|AA10072829	pretty slim to none but there is always the chance because you can get pregnant on your period and they say you have a small chance of getting pregnant with precum...the chances are very little though.
UKHDlvM5aa	Technically, it's possible to get pregnant if you have sex while you're having your period, but it would be a total fluke. (i.e. you have sex on the last day of your period, he has super-sperm that survives 5-6 days inside your body, and you happen to ovulate a week earlier than usual.) It COULD happen, but it's very unlikely.<br>  <br>  If you're trying to conceive, your period is definitely not the best time for that. If you're trying to avoid pregnancy, use protection every time, no excuses.|`|lT6WBaWIaa	probably very little, but i wouldnt give your lover a BJ after sex. it would probably taste bad. =)|`|AA11067887	you wouldnt be fertile at all|`|TQg7yubGaa	Actually it depends on when you ovulate.  I know people who were trying not to get pregnant, so they only had sex that week out of the month. Yeah, she has two kids.  It can be one of your more fertile times.  You'd have to know at least something about when you ovulate though.
1z3C0R2Vaa	take more folic acid and drink lot of nutritious juice i wish you all the best......|`|RvSHQtrXaa	There is nothing much you can do.  Continue taking your supplements like materna.  If you need additional iron according to your doctor, take them.  Eat right, consult a dietician/nutritionist for a laid out diet sheet.|`|AA12395149	Take your prenatal vitamins, stay well hydrated and follow a healthy diet that includes lots of fresh fruits, veggies, lean meats and whole grains, get plenty of rest and exercise as needed and wrecommendedmmended by your doctor. <br>  <br>  You may be only 5 weeks along even though your LMP is leading you to believe you are 7 weeks.  You may not have ovulated at 14 days after the first day of your last period.  Not all women do, most women typically do, that's why it's used.  If your doctor isn't worried, you shouldn't worry about it.  Just wait and see how things develop and take care of yourself.<br>  <br>  Best of luck.|`|71426c90338c6daa00b5005f598c343aaa	Nothing!  You don't need to do anything to make baby grow faster.<br>  <br>  If baby is measuring behind, it probably means that you didn't ovulate when you thought.  I am also measuring a week and a bit behind the date I got from the "Due Date Predictor".<br>  <br>  It really is nothing to worry about, I am somewhere between 12 and 13 weeks (lol) and everything is going fine, my doctor told me it is just to do with ovulation, and the predictor can quite easily be out if you ovulate a little late/early.

mCDopsLEaa	MIND OVER BODY. Alot of young girls fear being pregnant after they lose their virginity. So the fact that you are thinking that you are pregnant, makes your body play tricks on your head. Which means the fact that you are stressing about being pregnant will also delay your period and make you think you are pregnant for real. I doubt you are pregnant. This is how almost all young girls feel when they lose their virginitty at a young age. good luck .|`|jBEe6Sqdaa	Get a pregnancy test.<br>  Another word of advice:  Quit having sex and stay in school!  You can think about having sex again when you learn how to spell properly and can write an intelligent paragraph to support your question.  How old are you?  12?  And if you soooo afraid of having a child at such a young age then why are you having sex?  Be a kid, there will be PLENTY of time for sex later - you only get a short amount of time to be a child.|`|rxKP7NqSaa	If you only did it 6 days ago it would be too early to tell if you are pregnant and also too early to get the symptoms you are mentioning.<br>  Wait a couple of weeks and take a home pregnancy test or go see your doctor or clinic nurse.|`|0ueNppc3aa	well jade, i would recommend getting a pregnancy test from your chemist/pharmacist ? good luck.|`|yea2hci5aa	It's way too early for you to notice any signs especially bloating in your stomach.  I know it's easier said then done but you need to calm down and not worry about it until you've missed your period because the stress of waiting for your period to show can cause it to be late.  There's always the possibility of becoming pregnant even with protection.  If you're late then buy a home pregnancy test and then make an appointment with an ob/gyn, if you're pregnant then they'll be able to give you prenatal vitamins and if you're not then maybe you can discuss getting on some form of birth control.<br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|YbGULYAwaa	Honey...If you only done it 6 days ago it is probably to early to tell.<br>  <br>  And it does sound lieky ou are stressing alot about and this can cause tummy pain..<br>  <br>  Are you on the pill???<br>  <br>  You can purchase a pregnancy testing kit at you local pharmacy so you can check yourself.<br>  <br>  You want really know until it is time for your period but if you are really really worried then i would suggest going to your doctor.|`|53015cf51c5f798dab95e8e9aa0f9d05aa	i would say no, but there is always that chance. wait until your period is soppose to come and if you are late, then you can start to worry.. i wouldn't worry much at this point.. you said you just lost your virginity so that may be throwing your body for an adjustment as well.. that is something new that you body has never had.. are you due for your period soon, because sometimes when my period is coming my stomach gets tender and jeans or tight pants do irritate me.  i also eat ALOT before and during my period. good luck~|`|AA11100454	You display NO symptoms of pregnancy at all.  6 days is too early to be feeling anything.  If you do not get your period, your breasts are tender, you are sick in the morning, you could be.  Don't just worry.  Buy a home pregnancy test or go to your Doctor.  None of what you say points to pregnancy.  It all points to anxiety.|`|X8Fd2dm6aa	Most likely you are not pregnant if you used protection. I still get nervous after my boyfriend and I have sex and I notice pain in my stomach but it always ends up being related to my period. Take a pregnancy test if you want to clear your mind.|`|tsn34pS4aa	wait until you are about to get your period, take a store test and then freak out... but you probably aren't, just were way to young to have sex and are subconsciously regretting it.|`|UOdlnw6Xaa	sweety it sounds definitely like you are pregnant. . . . :-) Congrats!!!!!!!!!|`|KS5SfjHMaa	I bet ur not pregnant!!The hurt & the growling in ur stomach are not the signs of a pregnant woman esp. that it's been only 6 days!!!!!!|`|AA12212456	relax its likely that your just stressing to much im sure all will be well if the condom had tore im sure he would have told u . if you concentrate too much on being pregnant your body will think it is|`|StoyzZUGaa	It's a little early to tell, but if you used protection and didn't notice any tear in the condom afterward, I don't think you're pregnant. <br>  In your mind, you're blowing up everyday sensations into possible pregnancy symptoms, because pregnancy is what's on your mind. That's understandable, but try not to stress about it too much. Stress won't make you feel any better and it might delay your period even if you aren't pregnant - which will only cause more stress! <br>  <br>  You don't say anything about your period being late, so I assume it's not due yet.<br>  You're most fertile around 14 days before your period, so have a look at when you're due to menstruate - if it's about two weeks from when you had sex, or a week from when you posted your question, then you may have something to worry about. But if that's when you're due, your current symptoms could just as easily be PMS! Do you ever get premenstrual symptoms like the ones you've described? A lot of women do.<br>  <br>  Check out these early pregnancy symptoms: <br>  <a href="http://www.americanpregnancy.org/gettingpregnant/earlypregnancysymptoms.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.americanpregnancy.org/getting...</a><br>  <br>  Then check out these PMS symptoms:<br>  <a href="http://www.womentowomen.com/menstruation/pmssymptoms.aspx" rel="nofollow">http://www.womentowomen.com/menstruation...</a><br>  <br>  There are a lot of similarities in the lists!<br>  <br>  If you don't get your period when you're due, buy a home pregnancy test or go see your doctor. The doctor will let you know all your options. <br>  If you're not pregnant, ask the doctor if you can go on the pill or get the injection/implant. If you're having sex and don't want a baby yet, then you should be responsible for your own contraception and, ideally, you should be using condoms as well to protect against STIs. <br>  The doctor should agree with this. It doesn't matter that you're young - if you've started having sex, you'll likely continue and prescribing contraception for you could help prevent unwanted pregnancies. <br>  <br>  Just be prepared next time and you'll save yourself this kind of worry in future.

Some call it a ghost pregnancy. I think you should wait until your period is due before you worry.|`|V5TC4x6jaa	ok pee on the dot and if it stays the same you are not pregnant . just playing your proly not prego only way to really tell is to take a test but wait until you miss your period.

h5cFkP35aa	sounds like your ligaments stretching but if you've had problems in the past with cysts, you may want to get that checked out. i went through a lot of ligament pain in the beginning.|`|i8Ch743Laa	I've got that as well,I'm 16 weeks today.

AA12145826	UTI's are very common during pregnancy. It sounds like your doctor is worried that you might have a kidney infection, which could be a little more serious. I would call your doctor's office and ask to speak with him or a nurse so you can get your questions resolved. Its odd that he didn't order any additional tests to see why you have blood cells in your urine.<br>  <br>  Good Luck|`|AA12395149	There is sometimes blood in the urine from micro tears in the mucosa of the bladder.  This is typically benign, but the tears can be spots for bacteria to grow.  <br>  <br>  The best thing to do if you have recurrent bladder infections is excellent perineal care.  When you go to the bathroom, wipe front to back, drop the toilet paper and go for a second round if needed with some new squares (no scrubbing back and forth).  You can also keep baby or femininhygienene wipes in the bathroom to get it extra clean.  When you have sex, get up soon after and empty your bladder and clean up as much of the stuff as possible.  Letting it all hang out there will increase your chances of getting another infection.  Wear only cotton panties (no nylon or silk, they don't let your vagina and meatus breathe and they get really hot making for a good spot for bacteria to hang out).  Wear loose fitting clothing.  When you are at home, try going without underwear to really let it all breathe (especially when you are sleeping).  Try to take only showers and not baths.<br>  <br>  If you aren't having problems with blood sugar, drink cranberry juice daily.<br>  <br>  Best of luck with the rest of your pregnancy.
5O4Lne7Haa	i would up it ! at one week my daughter wanted 3 ounce sometimes! he might start drinking 5 oz every 3 or 4 hours so it will be about the same amount he is getting now just not as often. its like if sat down and ate a little and you weren't starving anymore and could still he some but there was nothing on your plate. if there would have been more you would have eaten it but there wasn't so now you will be hungry again in 2 hours:)|`|NSHZUQyOaa	Divide his weight in half then times by 5 and that's how many ounces he should be having in a day.|`|wi1vtSAQaa	it depends on ur baby my baby is 9 weeks and she has 4-5 oz every 2 hrs except at night wen she goes 5 hrs ive tried putting her up to 6 oz and she wont drink it. i suppose it just depends how big there tummy is and depends on birth weight my daughter was 9lb 10oz at birth and weighs 13lb now.

5b3cd64667a391942de231867c44d64caa	Oh I don't envy you.. I'm so glad our daughter is nearly 3 months old lol<br>  <br>  Look, as long as bub is having 6-8 heavy, wet nappies I wouldn't worry. Just feed him what he wants, when he wants it. They hardly eat at all during the first week and you can expect weight loss - don't worry too much about the spit up. As long as it's not projectile, he's fine. Bubby should be back to birth weight by about week 2 or 3.<br>  <br>  They say they need to be fed at least every 4 hours as their tummies empty pretty fast (and I know I'll have critics) but our baby went up to 6 hours without eating pretty regularly and shes a big girl! Formula is digested pretty well. If he wants food every couple of hours, it's fine - and pretty normal. It's going to be a rough few weeks but if you try to take turns, you'll benefit. We actually took turns but I would feed Isabella for two days-ish and then James would feed her for one night. That way I caught up on my sleep regularly and his work wasn't affected TOO much.<br>  <br>  I hope I gave you some helpful ideas. Please contact me if you need more help - congrats, you're obviously a very caring parent. Keep up the great work!!<br>  <br>  PS Nap when he does!|`|1hciyvKdaa	Gentle burping and burping more often should help this.Foods new to his stomach so some spitting up is normal. Make sure the nipples are those for newborns, each type has dif sized holes too. Keep a log of babies eating habits, go up and weigh baby at the drs whenever you want so you can watch his progress too. It takes time, as long as baby pees and poops he should be ok. Get a good book at the book store or library on infant care for reference|`|NSHZUQyOaa	Hi my baby is 2 weeks old she has been drinking 4 ounces every four hours for the past week and she dosn't spit much back. All babies are different but at the hospital a few days after she was bron she was spitting up a lot of her milk and we were told she was having too much and that babies will be sick extra milk that their stomachs cant handle. Try stretching out the time to maybe 2 hours apart and then after a few days stretch it a bit further apart then he might take a bit more milk and less often. You'll apprieciate it during the night lol. Hope this helps a bit.|`|VFJGRigZaa	No he's getting used to eating, just make sure you brup him good, and if you are concerned ask your doctor, maybe hes allergic, but i doubt it, my daughter still throw up all kinds and shes 5 months and growing like a weed! Even though i wear half her food..lol.. i just keep feeding her!
mc6YtaRbaa	What to Expect When You're Wife's Expanding is the greatest book for guys.

be8738c7b3a936fc2e865b3f0e6ad7d4aa	I read about this with my last pregnancy and asked my doctor about it. He said that he has delivered 5,000 babies an has never seen a case of listeria, none of the doctors he knows have seen one either. He told me I could eat some but not too often because of the salt and preservatives. <br>  <br>  I had a short lived craving for turkey sandwiches and I ate them :)<br>  <br>  You can heat the meat to steaming hot to eliminate the risk,|`|GxYtTjUbaa	Not true at all. I ate coldcuts all the time and subway my first pregnancy. Its perfectly okay jus check the dates and make sure everything is fresh. Thts all what u need to be careful for is the sea food becuz the amount of mecury and all tht can have a serious affect on ur unborn child.|`|jsdDgIuRaa	It's one of these paranoia things (there is a bacteria they can have called listeria but it can be found in other foods as well, veggies, etc not only deli meat)  and as you have heard even thinks like peanut butter can harm you (salmonella outbreak) so basically you can choose to avoid everything because it can all potentially be contaminated but who wants to live that way?<br>  <br>  I have eaten deli meat throughout both my pregnancies but it's up to you.|`|9a3sNrEqaa	I actually talked to my dr about this b/c I ate a turkey sub and read an article after so i had an anxiety attack but my dr said that deli meat isn't really good for pregnant bc the risk of listeria and the amount of nitrates in the meat. Also tuna has a lot of mercury in it. With that being said my dr said that most women eat whatever they want and are fine! So if your going to eat a sub try not to do it all the time! GOOD LUCK!!!!!!!!!!!!|`|F7knBX1haa	I heard the same thing and the reason to stay away from cold cut meats is because of bacteria. However, if you want to eat (or crave) you can heat up the meats or the cold cuts from the store that are vaccuum sealed are safe during pregnancy. You can have the hot subs from Subway!|`|bc29eaf19302ac3e6d0492b8facf1027aa	There's a couple reasons why they're not the best.  One is that they sometimes can contain the bacteria listeria, which can infect the baby.  Another is that they're full of salt and nitrate preservatives.
1thzSbS8aa	The morning-after pill can delay your period. It's written right there in the package literature. SInce you bought it twice, you should have read it. If you had read it, you'd also have learned that it's for emergencies only, and not reliable enough to use every time you have sex. It is no substitute for regular birth control.<br>  <br>  There is no way anyone can tell you if you're pregnant. You should take a pregnancy test now, because enough time has passed since Jan. 31, and another in a week if this one is negative (because not quite enough time has passed since Feb. 4 yet.).|`|QQE58qFQaa	Most likely the MAP worked.... I would give it another 5 days and than take a pregnancy test... It could be late due to the pill, stress, weight loss, exercising... etc...
fMilDRgLaa	It is not unusual for one breast to produce more milk than the other.  It is quite normal.  You have tried the obvious solutions with the breast shields and such.<br>  <br>  A woman's breast can have more milk ducts in one breast than the other. This is why more milk can be produced in that breast.<br>  <br>  Interesting fact is that if you are right handed....your right breast will produce more. If you are left handed...your left breast.  Not 100% true , but normally that is the case.<br>  <br>  You are doing great and don't worry unless you feel engorged in that left breast!|`|bc29eaf19302ac3e6d0492b8facf1027aa	One of your breasts is probably more sensitive to stimulation than the other.  Pumps are not as effective at stimulating your breasts as your baby is, and your breasts are stimulated at different levels.<br>  <br>  Pumps on the whole will not stimulate your breasts like your baby will.  Some women just can't pump enough even though they make plenty. I'm one of them.|`|deIzFnV8aa	I also have that problem.<br>  <br>  Let me tell you, a warm shower does wonders for both sides.  If you are work you can't use that idea, but presumably a warm compress would help as well.<br>  <br>  Also, if you only pump one side at a time, switch back and forth every time the milk flow slows/stops. Start on the side you have problems with. usually you will get at least some additional letdown after a short break.|`|OBU1eDUHaa	I have the exact same problem.  I even had a lactation consult to see what I could do.  She told me that it is completely normal that one side make more/less then the other.  In my case, I had breast implants and there might have been more damage to my left side.  I produce enough milk, just not enough as the other side.  The LC told me to pump a lot on the left side to build up my milk supply, but I never could get it = to the other side.|`|FLEXqVoiaa	I'm the same way. My daughter has always prefered to nurse from my left side, so it produces more milk since it is used more. I think the size of your breasts may also have something to do with it-If one side is smaller than the other, it may be harder to pump milk from it. At least this is the case with me. <br>  <br>  Try hand expressing from the side you can't get much milk from. This usually works for me.|`|rDPADat1aa	That's completely normal.  The large majority of women have one more productive breast over the other.  It's just the way your body is.  I've nursed 2 of my three kids for over a year (the first only 6 weeks, the second 13 months, and the third 30 months) and my left breast is always the one that doesn't make as much.  You can actually tell a difference in size when looking at them it's that obvious.

8AU0QRiUaa	My daughter does this if she thinks that mom or dad are going to spend some time together without her while she is in school. If no fever or vomiting, send them to school. My daughter once told a teacher she threw up at lunch, and they sent her home. She was fine and all she wanted to do was play.  She had only merely spit out some food in the trash that she didn't like.  The next day I went to the school and explained to her teacher how she called spitting out food, vomiting when it wasn't . They watched her more closely  after that and she learned she could not get out of going to school, unless she was really sick.|`|DcVoq5Tuaa	I do what you do, if no fever, vomiting etc. off to school they go. It's a judgment call. If I can look at them and tell they aren't feeling well, I will keep them home but for the most part, I don't let them miss school unless they are really sick.|`|hUdKYtegaa	my mom did & she made the mistake! i couldnt go a whole week without not going 2 skewl for one day! & the days i was sickk no one believed me!|`|3f0439ebe7cdf100832cada550ab973caa	Im with you on this, but sometimes a child can feel unwell due to anxiety, stress, lack of sleep.<br>  Have a little chat with your bf's son to see what's going on, maybe he's being bullied, has morning talk and isn't comfortable or a test he isn't sure of.<br>  My 8 year old is like this, if her teachers sick or wont be in class the next day she has sore tummy, morning talk-sore belly, kids not being nice-sore belly.<br>  Have a chat, you learn something that you could've over looked.<br>  <br>  Good lick|`|hZf8aJkYaa	If I do not feel good the day before but am not throwing up or running a fever I see how I feel in the morning.

I'd just started a new school and was having some trouble adjusting. It was only once in a while, and my grades never suffered. But the boy is missing weeks of school. That can't be a good thing.

krQiDGCHaa	It just depends on the level of hCG you have in your system.  hCG is the pregnancy hormone, and some women get LOADS of it right in the beginning, and other women it takes a few weeks to build up the hCG in the their system enough to read on a urine test.  A blood test will tell very early though, whether you have lots or very little hCG.<br>  <br>  How many days is your cycle regularly?  There is a chance your period just may be late -- it does happen, especially if you're worried about trying to get pregnant, it can make you miss a period.<br>  <br>  If you're that concerned, go ask your doctor for a blood pregnancy test and they will be able to determine for sure.<br>  <br>  I've never had a positive. :(  Hubby and I have been trying for 2 years now.|`|buI2TVpvaa	Am two weeks late yet no positive result.The say some people's HCG takes time to build up when the are preg.So am still waiting to test again because i hav a regular period of 29 days and have never missed my period b/4.like u said I cant wait hav my period back(If am not preg) so that I can continue.|`|mc6YtaRbaa	Each person makes the hormones hCG at different rates. HCG is what a pregnancy test has to detect in order to get a positive result. It's just one of those things that some people makes lots of it early on and others don't. Some people can't get a positive reading on a pregnancy test at all and can only us blood tests. I took my first test 2 days after my period was due and got a faint line.|`|9a3sNrEqaa	hey hun. I actually got a positive hpt about 7 dpo. *days past ovulation* I have sky high hcg levels. Some women have much lower levels tho. Everyone is different thats why drs won't tell you how far along you are based on your beta hcg level b/c everyone is sooo different. GOOD LUCK HUN!!!! TONS OF BABY DUST!!!!|`|wOyyZjY0aa	Hello.  With my daughter I tested almost every single day after my period was due. And every time I got a negtive.  Finally after a full week being late, I got my positive.  So for me......7 days after my period was suppose to start was when a HPT worked for me.  And I had a VERY regular 28 day cycle (for at least 3 years)<br>  Best of luck!!!!
tdNfQWaAaa	I've never been pregnant but I have heard alot of ladies say they didn't think they were pregnant and that their AF was right around the corner, and they ended up pregnant! So if I were you I would test! But I do now how you feel about being disappointed about a BFN... But my fingers are crossed for you! I hope this is your month!!! Best of luck and lots of baby dust!!! xxxx|`|6USJui72aa	bless, i am in the same boat.  i am gonna wait until i am a week late, cause knowing me the test will be negitive and i will start the following day.<br>  <br>  wish you luck and baby dust|`|NZrxDodmaa	you should test now if your period is already late it should come up. Good luck i wish you all the best baby dust to you guys.|`|T8ksKCWCaa	You can test now. Good luck!|`|cbfb39e3aab3b803822e39f849209291aa	You should be able to test now but if you are worried about getting a negative give it a week and then test if AF not shown.  Good luck i hope this is your month.|`|shKc7lZcaa	Since you are one day late, I would say go ahead and test.  If it's a negative and AF is still a no-show in the next couple of days, then keep testing until you see that BFP!!<br>  Good luck to you!!!|`|9osFXKPyaa	GO AHEAD AND TEST IT WANT HURT YOU A BIT I PROMISE BUT IT CAN JUST BE YOUR CYCLE PLAYING GAMES U KNOW HOW SHE START TO ACT UP WHEN YOU DON'T WANT TO SEE HER FOR 9 MONTHS LOL ....gOoD LuCk...|`|PpYl2dFVaa	weeeeeeeeee<br>  good luck on getting a little bundle full of a big blessing|`|Mj1qhzcIaa	I know what you mean! With 1 yr of experience being disappointed I too get a bit 'testy' when late. It of course always comes up 1-2 days late.[ now why does my cycle keep changing every month.....it is so weird that I think science does not apply to me anymore!]...neway...<br>  Your symptoms look hopeful but they could also be just PMS. But if you have been tracking ovulation (apprx) and it has been abt 18 DPO I think you should test. Just knowing will kill all the stress better for you and the baby. Also remember your vitamins. I wish we both get our BFPs this month....I am so sick of this! arghh!<br>  good luck and baby dust*********
be8738c7b3a936fc2e865b3f0e6ad7d4aa	If you have chlamydia you need to be treated. Why did you get it twice? You still need to use protection, even if it is "meant to be".|`|hqogf9oGaa	You really need to go see your doctor hunny!<br>  <br>  It is true that some antibiotics are not safe in pregnancy but there are lots that are safe for you and baby.<br>  <br>  Also, your partner needs to be tested and treated as well to avoid him giving it to you again.  Before he is treated either don't have sex at all or make sure that you use a condom.  If he refuses to wear a condom then tell him no way to sex because you don't want it again and don't want to risk your baby's health.<br>  <br>  Leaving it untreated will cause more problems than being treated so get along to your doctor straight away.<br>  <br>  Whether someone is your boyfriend or it's just a casual one night stand you need to take precautions to protect your baby and your future fertility.  If a guy wants to be with you then he will understand that he should get checked out by the doctor or at your local GUM clinic to make sure he is free of all STD's before having unprotected sex.  I only mention this because a lot of people don't have any symptoms (especially with chlamydia) and think there is no risk.<br>  <br>  Wishing you lots of luck!<br>  <br>  Indigo<br>  <br>  xxx|`|ewswVOrTaa	Nice guy, hope you have got rid of him.<br>  <br>  You need to be asking your doctor these questions.  Did you find out from a clinic that you have chlamydia again or from your GP?  Go and see your GP now.<br>  <br>  And no, it isn't true that that is the only way you can get chlamydia.  If you have intercourse without a condom with a man who has it, you will get it.|`|hIzQyflqaa	i dont get it... if you had chlamydia the 1st time then your bf should have been treated too! why have unprotected sex with him again when you knew he had it or did you sleep with 2 different people?|`|IfyjeV4Raa	First of all you can get chlamydia anytime you have unprotected sex with an infected individual. Second of all if you were infected with it and treated then why did your partner not get treated as well? Obviously he didn't and that is why you have it again....plus the fact that if you were clean to start with and you have been with him a while then he has been steppin out sorry to say. C is very dangerous to the baby and you HAVE to be treated. The benefit of treatment far outways the risks in this case. C can be lethal to a baby especially if the mother is still infected at the time of birth. So waste no more time and be treated!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!|`|c73QkZ2haa	Sexual partners must be treated to prevent passing the infection back and forth. There is no significant immunity following the infection and a person may become repeatedly infected.<br>  <br>  A follow-up evaluation may be done in 4 weeks to determine if the infection has been cured. <br>  <br>  <br>  Wow.Use a condom. Your baby may not die but it can get really sick and chlamydia can cause infertility. You should not be having unprotected sex with people who are gonna be your bf while your pregnant like who gave it to you last time? The other guy meant to be your boyfriend? Not taking the pills can cause early labour andmay lead to PID, scarring and ultimately infertility.STDs are STDs if you dont use a condom you can get them doesnt matter whether a guy cums in you or not.|`|9osFXKPyaa	OK WHEN YOU GET THAT INFECTION IT COME FROM THE PERSON YOU ARE SLEEPING WITH SO IF U GO GET TREATED AND HE DON'T GET TREATED OF COURSE YOU ARE GOING TO KEEP GETTING IT.|`|R3XWitoEaa	All i have to say here is dat u messed up std's while prego nt cool|`|AA12395149	Babies are not likely to die from the antibiotics they give you.  The antibiotic will help to protect the baby and keep you from going into preterm labor.  If you don't get it treated soon, the infection may cause you and your baby to experience chorioamnionitis, this is where the infection actually gets up into the amnioic fluid.  This could potentially kill the baby.  If you haven't already seen your doctor about it, do it soon and take the antibiotics again.<br>  <br>  You should also have this boyfriend of yours seek medical care and get treated.  Was he treated the first time like you were?  If not, it may not have been him cheating on you, just him re-infecting you.  Either way, after you've been treated, you should abstain from sex until the after the pregnancy is done, there are obviously some issues going on that need to be dealt with.|`|O7QyQl15aa	If you have got rid of the chlamydia and not had unprotected sex since, then you have got rid of it, and there is no chance of reinfection.<br>  If you have had unprotected sex with someone who has potentially got chlamydia since 12 weeks, then you could potentially have it.<br>  <br>  You can get chlamydia  even if they do not ejaculate, it can be contained in the pre c*m in enought quantities to infect.<br>  <br>  If you get checked out quickly it can be sorted and no effects on the baby<br>  <br>  Women who have chlamydia during pregnancy tend to have higher rates of infection of the amniotic sac and fluid, preterm birth, and preterm premature rupture of the membranes (PPROM), although prompt treatment may reduce the risk of these problems. And some studies have linked chlamydia to an increased risk of miscarriage, although other studies found no connection. An untreated chlamydia infection also makes you more susceptible to HIV and some other STIs if you're exposed to them, and raises your risk of a uterine infection after you have your baby.<br>  <br>  What's more, if you have a chlamydia infection when you go into labor, there's a chance that you'll pass the bacteria to your baby. In fact, up to half of babies born vaginally to mothers with untreated chlamydia (and even some babies born by c-section) will contract the infection. One-quarter to one-half of these babies will develop an eye infection (conjunctivitis) a few days to a few weeks after birth, and 5 to 20 percent develop pneumonia a few weeks to several months after birth. Although these infections can be very serious, babies who are treated promptly with antibiotics generally do well. Of course, it's best to get treated during pregnancy and prevent your baby from becoming infected in the first place.<br>  <br>  Chlamydia is treated with a course of antibiotics that are safe to take during pregnancy. In most cases, a single course will cure the infection. The CDC recommends that pregnant women be tested again three weeks after completing treatment to make sure the infection is gone. Your partner should also be treated and you should abstain from sex until you've both completed treatment so you don't get reinfected
IYacMZCGaa	i like Madylin and mady as a nickname..madeline reminds me of the cartoon chatarer|`|1e7f68ee6a0d79eda6c821e9a33f6438aa	I love the name Madeline and would keep the traditional spelling.<br>  I also love the nickname Mady.<br>  <br>  Madeline Elise<br>  Madeline Morgan<br>  Madeline Aura<br>  Madeline Hazel<br>  Madeline Rosalie<br>  Madeline Joyce|`|eBKJRmEgaa	I like Madeleine (which is pronounced 'MAD-uh-lin'). Madeline ('MAD-uh-line') is ok, but I'm not a fan.<br>  Any other spellings are awful.|`|RuyLwzA0aa	I love the name...but I prefer to spell it either Madeline, or Madeleine.  The nickname Maddy is cute for when she is young.  There have been studies that when names are spelled alternatively (like with a "y" rather than an I) it portrays the person as less-educated or lower class.  If you want to give her something more unique opt for a uniqe middle name.|`|3Kqe5ZrPaa	I love Madeline and call her Maddy for short. Its a beautiful name :o)|`|La1lCp0Zaa	madylin is very pretty, people will call her maddy tho but yh its very nice|`|AA11273571	Madelyn... call her Maddee.|`|1ad2771a77e03d1afa77d4cef9cdd54baa	I had the same questions running through my head just over a year ago. I still wonder if I should have spelled it differently. I spelled it Madelyn and for short Mady. At the doctors office they pronounce it Made-line so I guess the lyn at the end didn't help with the pronunciation. I ended up using the lyn at the end because 3 different family members have Lynn as middle names. I love your idea, having one of my own. Good luck!|`|Hb3MK9eeaa	I like the name spelled Madeline.  I think it is nice to just call her Madeline and skip the nicknames, but if you want a one I prefer it spelled Mady.  Melanie, Miranda, and Madison are also pretty M names.  Good Luck!!|`|pDrdCRQcaa	Madelyn is my favorite spelling but it is too pretty of a name to call her Maddy. Also, with the rise in popularity of Madison, a lot of children will be called Maddy.|`|9EgS6uQzaa	I prefer Madeline to Madylin and I think the Maddy is better because I would pronounce Mady like "maidy" . I think that it is a beautiful name, maybe you could choose a unique middle name?|`|r0MgOWMjaa	If you like unique, then have Madylin. lt depends what you pronounce the name as, if it's Mad-ee-lin then it would probably be Mady. Hope I helped!! :)|`|Lo5yiBqzaa	Love Madeline.  Hate Maddy.|`|oYmZUO8Caa	I prefer Madeline. If you like the nickname Maddy, you should consider Madison too :)|`|Ll6VpvLxaa	I think that Madylin is definitely a nice twist on the traditional. If you don't want to call her Maddy as a nickname, you could always call her lynn.|`|AA11707606	I prefer the spelling Madelyn but your's is very unique.  I would call her Maddy, I like how it looks better than the one d.
vTfEYeKQaa	I had my baby really early. Too early for her to breathe on her own, and sadly she passed away the day after she was born. I'm not trying to scare you or anything, but I've been through it, and if you want to talk, just send me a message. I know it helps to talk about it.<br>  <br>  **Edit: I delivered at 22/23 weeks.|`|ZncV5gc0aa	Not me, but my sister had her daughter who is 4 now at 26 wks. She weighed only 1 lb 11 oz and it darn near broke your heart to see a baby born so early but she's a fighter and she's a normal little girl now. How early was your baby? If there's any advice I will give you it is bond with your baby while she is in the NICU. Be up there as much as you can everyday because having your mommy by your side will make anyone feel better and nurses will notice when you are there that she does better. Email me anytime if you'd like.|`|JE8lRn7Caa	I had a niece born at 35 weeks and her mother an I were close, we are neighbors. It was really hard for her mother she was in the nicu for a month. Just make sure when they do finally send her home she comes home on a monitor. I hate to be the bearer of bad news but when they were giving her the steroids to build up her lungs it made the linings too thick and she passed at 8 weeks due to that. I dont want to scare you but when I seen this I thought I should let you know.I dont want it to happen to anybody else if they would have sent her home on a breathing monitor she would still be here and be almost 2. If you need to talk you can email me through here.|`|uN3lZayjaa	im not a preemie mother but i was a preemie.. i was 2 and half months premature.. [28 weeks] and i weighed 2 pounds 4 oz. and i had a blood infection and had to have a blood transfusion and i am perfectly fine today. they had to put vitamine e drops in my eyes bc i my eyes werent ready and i have perfectly good vision.. so just keep your head up. there are very good doctors working on her. i just figured a good story from someone who was a preemie and how they turned out would cheer you up.|`|JMlDlTpPaa	yes my daughter was preemie i know its hard you just gotta look at the positives in having a sweet child...i just kept telling myself that nothing could go wrong and well now i have a healthy 1 year old!|`|9aAO1J73aa	not a parent but my lil sis was rly rly rly premature and it was hard|`|BEVVU5jxaa	My daughter was in the NICU for two weeks, her lungs were not ready and she was jaundice, we had to go back and forth to the hospital all say to be there to feed her and well, just to be with her.  It was rough but when they come home healthy it is all worth it.
AA11958911	NO|`|f66ce5d864eadcad29348fd4a9871771aa	this is the toddler and preschool section.<br>  <br>  <br>  and if youre "shaging" by yourself you cant catch anything you dont already have..
dR4QN0gHaa	I had a baby with colic and my advice is to take all the help you can get....it is exhausting. My husband was similar when my kids were first born but as they got older he really interacted with them more and helped a lot. I think some men have a harder time bonding with a newborn.|`|723QHuicaa	Yes.<br>  <br>  If I were you, I'd be wondering why the man I married would rather see me and our child go to live with my mother, than make an attempt to be a better, more hands on father.<br>  <br>  I think you need to tackle this issue with him. I hope things work out.|`|faPKwClPaa	Yes -- you need to take care of you first.  That's the only way you'll have the strength and energy to take care of your little guy.  Do what you need to do to get help (stay with your mom) until you feel ready.<br>  <br>  Secondly, you've got to do something about your husband.  That's just effing ridiculous.  You don't need to deal with it now (again, regain stable ground first), but once you're feeling stronger, you need to lay it on the line about his behavior and your expectations.<br>  <br>  Raising a baby is HARD and you both need to be on the same page.|`|b978f631fc787a963337206aa3833370aa	Your son is TOO young to cry it out, even if you eventually wanted to let him. At this stage, there is an obvious reason why he needs comforted, and you as the mother can definitely tell. I would be telling my husband to stuff it. Right after I lectured him on being lazy for not helping when I really needed it. He's a parent too, after all!<br>  <br>  Basically by moving in with mom you've replaced your husband with your mother. That's sad, because your husband helped you create this life and should take some responsibility. I mean, this isn't 1952 anymore where it's all left up to the mother. And you can't exactly go on autopilot and do everything yourself, because you have to rest, too. Put your foot down and tell your husband to grow up and stop hanging out with the buds and spend time with his new FAMILY. Ugh!<br>  <br>  As far as the colic, we went through this with my daughter at that age. It was horrible and she would scream for hours in the evening, coupled with vomiting and spitting up a lot. I later found that she had a milk protein allergy, which was causing her discomfort and a lot more (yucky, abnormal poops and intestinal problems). You may want to look into this and, if nursing, change your diet, or his formula if you're not. It made the difference between night and day with my daughter and I could actually *enjoy* her after that. LOL <br>  <br>  Good luck. :)|`|qdFrJ21waa	I don't know...I think that would cause more marital tension in my relationship. Guys are stupid sometimes (a lot of the time) and he might just be scared/nervous about being a Dad for the first time. I would try to talk it out more before leaving, even if it's only temporary. I know that with my husband, giving up and leaving would be the worst thing for our marriage. Your husband needs to get to know the baby and become involved, leaving will only make that bonding even more difficult. I just can't see how this could help your family (I understand it will help your sleep and what not...but as far as relationships go....I wouldn't do it ). Your putting your and your husbands relationship in jeopardy and your baby and husbands relationship in jeopardy. I would think twice about it and really try to find a solution that keeps your family together.|`|y6g0RnuAaa	Yes, I do. Your husband needs to be on the same page with you and work as a team. Newborns cry when something is wrong (as your instincts have been telling you.)<br>  <br>  Unfortunately this is not a good sign of things to come. He needs to be more involved to be a father. This will cause you much frustration and resentment (if not now then in the near future.) It is overwhelming to be a new parent sometimes (especially with a colicky baby.)Your marriage will never be happy unless you two are working together. Hope you can talk some sense into him! Good luck.|`|E4o015Ngaa	Yes I think you did obviously your husband is not dealing with the constant crying of the newborn alot of men have those types of problems personally I wuld tell him to man up but he should with time having your mom help was a good idea|`|OuuYoSBeaa	you do have to do what you think is best. But then you have to ask yourself, why is your husband driving you to the point of having to leave to get some help and support? Then he has the nerve to argue the point with you. Your husband needs a wake up call, quickly. Is there anyone around that you know of that can have a chit chat with him, to maybe get him to open his eyes a little and realize he is a parent too and that you are not super woman and cant handle it all on your own. Even the best of us need help now and then, and your husband should be the first person holding his hand out to you.|`|qIWUC1Ceaa	I would say yes and no. You should be getting through these tough times togather, and he needs to step the heck up and be a father. But i will tell you first hand i am not one to preech cause my husband don't do crap and we have four kids and he has never changed a diaper for any of them. You need to whip his butt into gear before it's to late and he ends up like mine. Give him a inch he'll be all over, and so will your marraige. You do what you feel is best. My last baby was extremely fussy and cried all the time for about two months straight. I would feed her, swaddle her tightly and put her in her swing on high speed and go about my day. Eventually she would go to sleep. She grew out of this stage but yes it was frustrating. Do you think he may have reflux? My baby has to take zantac for hers. Have you tried gripe water? I hear it works. Also try giving him a nice long bath every night and let him cry through it or after if that is what he does while you are getting his jammies on. I did this with my daughter and after her bath and getting lotioned up she would eat and pass out form all the screaming and sleep great.
7DWy8mPZaa	Is it rising at all? Some women experience what is known as a 'slow rise' after ovulation, whereby the temp is definately noted to be going up in pattern, but isn't jumping up as quick as usual. If you usually have a noticeable temperature shift, this probably doesn't apply, but some women always have a slow rise.<br>  <br>  Another possibility is that your body geared up to ovulate, hence the positive OPK but for some reason - didn't produce enough LH to trigger the release of the egg. This can happen from time to time and is often shortly followed by a second surge where you'll ovulate and see your temp shift. If you have any OPKs left, it's worth to keep using them until your temps climb. OPKs are good ...but I've had the same happen to me with them and decided to not use them and just chart BBT instead, keeping an eye on CM/ CP etc too. You can definately go on to ovulate over the next few days, so keep BD'ing!|`|S5n5Za78aa	i dont like to rely alone on that temp thing i thing its stupid and not accurate for everyone! i would track with some OPKS<br>  but thats just me look at this link this kind of just sums it up on why temps dont matter to me these woman still got there BFP even tho there temps were jacked up
Nb0Gxvsyaa	Congratulations!!!  I know how exciting this time is!  <br>  <br>  I like the idea of wrapping up the positive tests in a little package for him with a pair of little booties :-)  Other ideas:  A teeshirt that reads "I'm going to be a daddy" that you wrap up.  You could go to your favorite restaurant and give the waiter a special menu to hand him that has items like "Three sleepless nights Chicken" and stuff like that side dishes including "gurgles and coos".  Okay, maybe that is corney.  I wish I would have done something cool with my husband.  Instead I just blurted it out because I couldn't contain myself.  Our little boy is 12 weeks old :-)<br>  <br>  FOR THOSE HAVING TROUBLE CONCEIVING:  Try the clearblue easy fertilitly monitor. It worked for me and it worked for someone else I know with irregular cycles.  If your cycles are 75 days it may not help (I think it has to be at least within 45 days) but if you aren't sure when you are ovulating this can seriously help you.  Best of luck to everyone!!!|`|59GymH27aa	Congratulations!!! Lol at the three preg sticks...I was the same when I first got pregnant with my little girl after 1yr of trying. I must have bought a hundred :)<br>  <br>  I wanted to do something special to tell my boyfriend but I was too excited and just ran home to tell him (I was at the shops) I had everything planned then went home and it all went out the window coz I was shaking and just so so happy.<br>  <br>  You could buy him a card that says Daddy on it...or make him a nice meal and then hand him the stick.|`|P7q9cNaiaa	Me too!!!! I just found out this morning. I'm also irregular!<br>  <br>  My fiancee was with me when I tested though, no cute "surprise we're having a baby!"|`|OvFEyvU5aa	Make a meal with like ummm baby peas baby carrots and baby back ribs and ask him if he sees somthing in comnan.|`|DU72Bf5Caa	me and my fiance went out to eat then we drove around for a while and then we went for a walk after we sat down 4 a while i told him he was so happy|`|p0prrzf2aa	congrats!<br>  <br>  <br>  your gonna have so much fun ! :) reading every week you turn, going to see your lil peanut on the ultrasound! it's so AMAZING|`|vcxdTXbraa	Congratulations!!! When I found out I was pregnant I went to the book store and got a pregnancy book that just happened to be named "I'm Pregnant" and taped my pregnancy test to it and wrapped it up like a christmas present.|`|VY4LqfLpaa	just come out and tell him...now the grandparents can be fun...especially if there is a birthday, anniversary, or some other occasion coming up soon.  Ours was a late Christmas (we moved back home about a month after Christmas so we celebrated when we came home)...gave my parents a gift each, "#1 Pops" and "#1 Grannee" t-shirts, and "I love Grandpa" and "I love Grandma" bibs...it worked out pretty good...my dad kept looking at me then at the bib and kept saying..."are you trying to tell me something!"  it was hilarious!!|`|q4rG5Dwtaa	congrats I know how it feels to wait for something like this. Good Luck. See you here in 9months asking questions about your newborn.|`|eytlIKITaa	Congrats!!!  I'm super irregular too!  28-47 days and 10 months TTC...  Thanks for the hope!  Again, congrats!!!  : )|`|N6vEZVNEaa	congrats
JjBwydymaa	Hello hun,<br>  <br>  Are you having regular periods.. if yes! then it more than likely you are ovulating. Try using a fertility chart like...www.fertilityfriend.com who will help with managing and understanding your cycles.<br>  <br>  My personal experience was that it took me 9months to regulate again after the pill (however that is a very long time and average is around 3 months after stopping the pill)<br>  <br>  When ever you have unprotected sex.. there is a always a chance hunni!! Enjoy trying to conceive....dont let yourself get too obsessed with because it then can become very draining and stressful (stress can delay ovulation)<br>  <br>  I would suggest..after you have sex to prop a cushion under your bum to help the sperm swim in and dont get up and rush to the toilet after either. Just stay lying down for at least 20-30 mins. <br>  <br>  On average...the average couple takes a year to conceive naturally!<br>  <br>  Good luck hun and lots of baby dust to you!! xxx|`|S5n5Za78aa	theres always a chance you could be pregnant after having sex but ONLY a TEST can tell and i think its way to early|`|qfCRWAw0aa	Hey hunny, there is always a chance of getting pregnant at any time of the month as long as you have unprotected sex! <br>  <br>  Its only been 2months since you have been off the pill, it takes at least 3 months for most peoples bodies to get back to normal after coming off the pill. <br>  <br>  I wish you luch and baby dust <br>  <br>  xxx|`|ESAM0U7xaa	u don't get pregnant after ovulation, unless it came late. once the egg drops, it doesn't last long. but the sperm can live 3-5 days. so it is best to track your ovulation every month. <br>  go to babyhopes.com<br>  it will show are your fertile days and your ovulation date. it is best to start a few days before ovulation and have intercourse all the way up to the ov date. <br>  there is a chance you could have conceived since you had intercourse on ov. <br>  a few things to check for on ovualation...did you notice any cm (cervical mucus) creamy white in that week. and closer to the 14th or on the actual 14th did you notice any egg white cm. it looks just like egg white and clear. that's a really good sign to tell!!<br>  <br>  good luck to u!|`|2n0B4cY6aa	Yes you can still get pregnant, yes there is a chance you could be aswell.|`|N6vEZVNEaa	yes you can still can get pregnant....and|`|kTu7UtS1aa	We are in the same situation.  I use the Clearblue Easy Ovulation Predictor and I love it.  I became pregnant the very first time I used it (back in Oct - but I had a miscarriage in Dec).  Before then I was using the sticks and I did not have any luck.  This month  the kit showed that I was ovulating (peak status) on the 16th - 17th, but it also showed when I had a "high fertility" status, which began on the 10th.  So my husband and I started to have sex every other day beginning on the 10th until the 17th.  I will not know for sure if we are pregnant for about another week or so, but we have our fingers crossed.  You still have a chance to be pregnant, but it's not as high as it would have been had you had sex on the 5 days leading up to ovulation and the day of ovulation.  If it doesn't happen for you this time, then have sex a few days before your next ovulation and on the day of ovulation to increase your chances.  Good luck to you!!!|`|6USJui72aa	i would use the clear blue ovulation kit to monitor you ovulation cycle.  to help increase ovulation look into using Vitex (talk to a herblist before you take, it helped me).  i hope you are preg but if your not also look into the conception kit, its something myself and my husband are planning on using next month.|`|9osFXKPyaa	i think it is best to try before you ovulate because it give trhe sperm time to meet the egg before it drop, but having sex after i don't think the sperm will make it in time to meet the egg
vue9NOhYaa	Yes, it sounds like a blocked duct.  Breast cancer is extraordinarily rare in a woman your age, and blocked ducts are VERY common in nursing moms.|`|9979bb6f0e03a8d3d1be61eab96d087daa	From my understanding, a blocked duct is sore, tumors are not.  Blocked ducts have a red tint to the skin where it's inflamed - tumors do not change the color of the skin.<br>  <br>  If in doubt, please seek a second opinion.  Does your local hospital have a lactation consulatant?  If so, contact her, she will be able to tell you the difference quickly, it's her job to know these things.<br>  <br>  Hope this helps.|`|v3YJq4moaa	You know it could be many things so I would not panic.I have heard of this being a clogged milk duct. You are young and breast feeding so If you have not noticed it before then chances are it could be a clogged duct. I would not mess around though. Go for a mammogram if you feel you don't want to wait the week. Do what you feel comfortable with and don't be afraid to call your doctor back and request a mammogram ASAP if that is what you want. Good luck|`|A5xpEfwuaa	Sounds like a duct, but def good that you had it checked.  I had mastitis and have had another blocked duct incident and it sucks.  Hang in there! And remember, you've been proactive so if it is more serious you caught it early.  Hang in there.|`|5DfSfyWfaa	I'll be one more person to tell you not to worry. I had a lot of those when I was bf'ing. You're soooo young. It's probably nothing.
WPI0Z47saa	My niece has the same problem. My sister in law was instructed to do the same as you were. She was also told not to lay er flat on her back. She was so bad when she was young that for the first few months she slept in a swing so she could sit up higher because the wedge under her head in the crib wasn't enough. She was also told to have her propped up for at least 20 minutes after she ate in almost a 90 degree angle. For the most part she left her in a slightly inclined high chair, her bouncer, and her swing after meals. Other than that there isn't much you can do but keep her on the medicine and used the rice and also feed her a little at a time to give it a chance to work down. My niece was about 2 before things settled down. She still has a problem with certain foods like sauce since it is aciditic. The doctor said that most kids will grow out of this by the time they are 2. Good luck and I hope I have helped some.|`|UghJ0XROaa	My daughter has acid reflux, we were never told to put rice cereal in her bottle, but i know it's a common thing people are told to do. Our doctor gave her baby Zantac and that worked for her.|`|5b3cd64667a391942de231867c44d64caa	I'm so sorry, you poor lady and poor little bubba. This hasn't happened to our bub but my cousin was told to do the same with her son. I lived with them at the time and I remember he changed into a brand new baby overnight. I know many people are told that thickening baby's bottle isn't usually the way to go but it definitely helped in his case. I would have been apprehensive if we were given that advice for our daughter but I've actually seen it work. (Mind you, I'd get a second opinion regardless)<br>  <br>  I distinctly remember my cousin saying that the doc said she'd know if it was working within a few feeds. I hope that helps!|`|SrSfZJTKaa	I haven't heard of anyone being advised to add baby rice either! I would just use the antacid you where given. Have you tried swaddling the baby and propping up the cot mattress so your baby sleeps on a slight incline. I know that works sometimes. Also, I would recommend that you take a first aid course, you will learn how to deal with a choking baby and God forbid it ever become necessary how to resuscitate a baby. It will make you feel a lot more confident and in control if you need to deal with any more choking incidents. Good luck.|`|9EkFrApiaa	HOW AWFUL!! I am so sorry but I don't have any insight.|`|OBuzcIDbaa	My daughter had that too. It's awful to deal with. My heart goes out to you. It's frightening enough to have a newborn without her choking all the time. If it's any consolation, my daughter is almost 22 yrs.old now. (-:
hw3OMoeZaa	I was on clomid from Dec. until almost March and nothing happened.  The one thing I did notice was severe cramping because your forcing your body to ovulate and over stimulate and it can be and was painful for me.  We also tried the inter uterine insemination kit and it didn't work.  I got lucky and it just happened after we quit trying.  I also found out 1 week after my dad passed away so I feel like it was a gift from him.  Good Luck|`|xGehiZDOaa	well clomid is to help women ovulate and get pregnant. i have herd that it doesnt change the risk factor or having a misscarry either way it wont protect you from having one. Also when taking clomid you have a 10% chance of multiples. I am on my 2nd round of clomid and just found out im ovulating today!!! So the pill does work! BABY DUST TO YOU BY THE TRUCK LOADS!!!|`|6PR8Cj2raa	Well I have taken two rounds of clomid. My first round I was pregnant with twins, I lost them though at 8 wks.  I just did my second round of clomid in jan and Im pregnant but I havent went for my scan yet, Im only 5 wks 2days. So im keeping my fingers crossed that this round keeps going, I go for my scan in 2 wks. Good luck!!|`|qgJLZPDJaa	how longs it been since your last pregnancy?<br>  how old are you?<br>  obviously you seem to not have had any complications with the others <3<br>  <br>  good luck with everything..but it could varie between each person.|`|e8fda8c1053040b3fa216ad2d6475ed5aa	my friend ended up with twins on that|`|1xCBR1aBaa	I took clomid and it worked for me on the second month. I do know lots of people who got pregnant on it. I don't know why he would put you on it if you aren't ovulating normally. I enjoyed the medicines and will take them again to get pregnant when I am ready. Best of luck
dwt52nrHaa	then you have more then you need.  just simply tell them you want to eat at home and have a dessert there too.
VHHis05Naa	If you went by my LMP, I would be a week more pregnant than I am.  Instead, I know exactly when I ovulated (was ttc with an ovulation kit and checking my cervical fluids), so please know that going by your LMP isn't the most accurate way.  It's easier for them because you are more likely to know that date than your ovulation day.  If you ovulate exactly on Day 14, the LMP dating system will be accurate for you.  If not, it can be off by a bit.|`|8oAlBL91aa	I would assume that since you are not experiencing any cramping than your probably safe. As long as there is no bleeding or heavy cramping then your alright.<br>  <br>  Nauseous and thirsty are good all part of being preggo.|`|HSUfe3m7aa	They base the LMP date on the fact that most women ovulate on day 14 of their cycle. I ovulate day 7, both my pregnancies were a week ahead of what they thought. If you ovulated late, that would explain the dating. If the hCG is within range and you are having no miscarriage symptoms, I think you'll be fine. If you are only 5-6 weeks that would explain the development as well.|`|P1xlrvAaaa	I think you should be fine.You are probably just not as far along as you thought,it actually happens a lot some woman are off by a month or more.Just try to take it easy and not think about it as much bc that will stress you out!Feel better in knowing once you see a heart beat there is only a 20% of miscarriage.Good luck and congrats!!!!!!|`|UFu0h8SKaa	what is lmp, is that your last period? if it is you're not much more than that anyway are you? 7 wks? so i wouldn't worry if i were you. at 12 wks they'll be able to see whether all is ok on not.|`|OPTDFRuzaa	i think the sonographer is right and your only 5-6  weeks as a heartbeat would have shown up if you were 7 weeks. sounds normal you just have to wait and till your next scan which will be your dating scan|`|1xCBR1aBaa	you could have ovulated later and that's why your dates are off, you really can't see anything at five weeks. I did see my bean at 6w6day and heard the heart beat. Just relax and go back for another scan in a few weeks. Since you are still sick that's a good sign. I'll say a prayer for you.
331444a2b76e68eeff0a4ce275773130aa	The only way a child, or anyone for that matter, will learn the error of their ways is being on the receiving end of similar negative behaviour.  That being the case, I would first ask her, "How would you feel if someone treated you like (fill in the blank here.)"<br>  <br>  At 11, she could completely dismiss you.  Given the friends she does have, she might think and say, "That will never happen to me because I'm popular."  If that's the case, I'd let it go with something like,<br>  <br>  "Things have a way of coming back at you like a boomerang.  If you treat people well, you will be treated well.  If you treat people badly, bad things will happen to you.  Maybe not right away, but in the near and foreseeable future."<br>  <br>  At 11, there's a good chance that she will shrug you off.  But when something bad does happen to her, and if she keeps this up it will, you can then point out to her how her negative behaviour created the current outcome.<br>  <br>  Good luck!  Raising young tweens and teens is not an easy proposition - but in the end, it will be well worth it.|`|kGkUG0fKaa	Talk about it with your husband. Identify your concerns and that way if a talk should be done, it will with her parents so that her mother doesn't get offended by you trying to "play mom'' with her daughter (it's a chance she may think that way) and the concern is coming from her father.|`|GqsLNUE8aa	I'd say something. Lots of girls go through that stage where nothing in life is as important as her BFF's although 11 is young for that no? Don't know what I'd say ~ but I'd say something. :)<br>  <br>  BTW ~ I had no idea your hubby had another little one ~ she's only a few years older than my son. It's to bad you guys aren't allowed more time with her ~ you'd be a great influence for her.|`|YJVmL9Ubaa	There might be some things you wish you could take back that you still remember saying to someone in school,tell her about a true story from you and tell her that you wished you could go back in time and fix what you said to someone,don't make it about her,make it about you and ask her advice.|`|gsBkLXUzaa	It really depends on the scenario what you would say exactly. I would definitely say something to her if you see her treating someone that way. She may or may not complain to her mom at that age, so I personally would expect the dad to be the one to step up. <br>  <br>  Why only 4 hours?|`|LY2LSzPJaa	I would say talk to her about it , or have her watch mean girls lol ....of course talk to her see why she acts that way. Maybe she is insecure with herself...take her to lunch , girls day out and discuss it with her.|`|JsqMSU9Haa	absolutely - try your best and something might sink in<br>  i commend you for trying|`|ocnIU67caa	The same thing is happening to my 12 year old sister. She is in the 'popular' group at school and my friend's sister(same age) is telling me my sister is mean now(they used to be great friends). <br>  <br>  Just let her know that the what she is treating her classmates is not right. Sometimes the child doesn't even know what they're doing is wrong. For example, I told my sister and she didn't even realised the way she expressed herself was hurtful to others. Does your stepdaughter have an older sibling? Perhaps the other brother/sister can have a word with her, that is always easier. If not can you ask your husband to give her a little advice?|`|tfdQxfrpaa	You could try to bring up s "situation" at your work or something of the like, that seems like you are being treated the way she is treating these other kids. Just bring it up casually, don't call her out on anything, but maybe that will get the wheels in her head turning. When you see her for only a few hours once a week you don't want to spoil it with accusations and all. Also, you could talk to the mother about it just briefly bring it up. Maybe she could be of help as well.|`|SSqwm7Vnaa	Yep, i agree with the other answer. Ask her why shes being mean, try to influence her (and her mum) into outdoor activities, and being with animals. (preferably not horses.)<br>  <br>  There are so many girls like that at my school, and eventually they end up with no friends at all (either that, or they end up with a gang.) Its influenced my msn chat on computers i find.|`|mDQZnI7gaa	Because she isnt your daughter I would speak to her father first and maybe even ask him to speak with her mother.  But its good that youre concerned because thats not a good way to treat people and young kids shouldnt act like that.  She must be getting it from somewhere (TV, mother, aunt).|`|cAtWxJG1aa	There's a good book (for parents) about girl bullying called "Odd Girl Out."  I seem to recall it more setting up the problem than offering much in the way of solutions, but it might be worth checking out from your library since it may have some suggestions.|`|VwMkiLFPaa	For our summer visits, my stepdaughter used to get made fun of at daycare because she couldn’t speak well. She begged me to pick her up at daycare instead of her Daddy (the daycares for our kids were in opposite directions) so I surprised her one day and me and her Dad switched pickups. When I got there, she was being mean to a little girl that asked to play with her. She was throwing sand at her and I totally witnessed it with my own eyes!<br>  <br>  I called her name and wow, talk about a deer in headlights. We had a nice talk that day. About how it makes her feel when kids make fun of her. And it makes her sad. So I then asked why she’d go and be mean to another girl like that, knowing it made her sad. And she apologized to me, to her “friend” at daycare, and her teacher. And she never did it again!!<br>  <br>  I think you should talk to her about hurt feelings. Because until it happens to her, she won’t quite grasp what it feels like or what it means. But I’d still talk to her about it without telling her what to do. <br>  <br>  And not sure if she likes to read, but maybe buy a book about friendships and bullying? They have them in my son’s Scholastic book order forms. I’m sure you can find them anywhere.<br>  <br>  ** ADD **<br>  For situations like THIS, my husband and I agree that we’re to act on it immediately. Whether it’s me or him with his daughter or our son, that parent deals immediately (even if I’m her stepmom) and then when we get home, we talk about it as a family together. And it works well. For some kids, you can’t “wait” to resolve the issue because its’ forgotten. You need to act right away. But if you’re always in communications with Dad and you two agree, then you guys do as you have to for her. <br>  <br>  Most parents would be appreciative that you’re stopping this behavior before it escalates. Stepchild or not! I know I sure as heck wouldn’t want my son acting out towards a child. If I wasn’t there to stop it, I expect someone else to speak up for me! And I’d be appreciative, not angry!|`|EtCRnDJMaa	Would you say something if she wasn't his daughter & you knew her other wise?  I would, I don't care if the child is mine or not, if they're being mean I say something.  It's not nice to be mean.|`|8oAlBL91aa	I would just ask her why are you being so mean to those other girls and go from there.|`|el8yX5q3aa	You can make a bigger influence than you think.  I would talk to her.  She obviously needs someone to be strong and help her see the world through different eyes too.  Do it in a loving and straightforward manner though.  Find some way to show her what you mean...<br>  <br>  If it were me I would find a good movie about something like this and watch it with her and explain that life isn't as easy as it seems.  What seems like funny now will leave her empty of friends and empty of heart when she can't learn compassion.  <br>  <br>  You could find some juvenile community service you can both do together once a month.  Call the volunteer service and ask them...<br>  <br>  You could instigate a project for her....making baskets or collecting toys and taking them to the children's home !  <br>  <br>  She does not know how lucky she is to have you.|`|oojO4WAraa	Sure, say something to her.  Don't tell her what to do, but bring it up and ask her feelings on it.  That will open up a discussion.  You don't have to be judgmental or bossy to discuss it with her.  Sometimes just discussing something helps a person see their actions in a different light.  Good luck.<br>  <br>  Maybe you could even rent the "Mean Girls" movie and watch it with her to open the discussion.  Girls night.

c3eb9cc5af710aa695ddf32e0b5e463aaa	Absolutely. There are even some ingenious pacifiers that are filled with a child-safe gel that stays cold for a while, after being refrigerated. I had three, and rotated them for my youngest, who was an early teether (one in the fridge, one in the mouth, one being sanitized).|`|Po2UqfvWaa	i would think it would cause it to become weak and crack sooner. i wouldn't do it. teething rings are specially made for this. or put a washcloth in the freezer. get 1/2 wet and freeze it. that's what i did|`|a8Pq2Lmdaa	Whats a dummy?<br>  Is like a teether or baby chew toy?<br>  If so then yes put it in the freezer, the cold helps to numb the gums and this offers lots of relief|`|V6dz395kaa	yup|`|p2Njf5gBaa	You can definetly put it in the fridge, no harm done. <br>  <br>  My son was an early teether and the teething rings where too big for his little hands.

8zdPI8Qsaa	Congrats first of all :-) <br>  Other than "What to expect" and "Eating well when you're expecting", I really enjoyed the book "Girlfriend's guide to pregnancy". <br>  <br>  Also, my favorite website has to be www.babycenter.com It'll give you weekly updates on how your baby is growing and what exactly is going on in your body (along with approximate pics of what baby looks like each week), and is a great resource for any question you might have.

IaMByOjFaa	Girl you are in the RIGHT!  And if she really wants another swing find one from the thrift store.  The swing was probably on it's last leg anyway.  She is doing it to prove she has power over your husband.  Don't give in or buy another used one from a garage sale.  Stand your ground|`|RbZDZ128aa	Hi,<br>  <br>  OK but even if it didn't look broken to you, your daughter could have broken it...<br>  <br>  I'm sure your Mother in Law isn't trying to get money out of you (you are married to her son)...<br>  <br>  If the swing wasn't new, then just get another one that works from a second hand store and give it to her...<br>  <br>  There is no reason why you have to buy a "new one".<br>  <br>  Ciao!|`|ZZMkENyeaa	That's stupid of her and unfair for her to blame your daughter. Tell her to grow up, it wasn't new, so it shouldn't be that big of a deal, and no I wouldn't buy a swing to replace that one.|`|1hciyvKdaa	Do the right thing as a couple, back down and let hubby do the thing that makes mom  happy ok. <br>  Sometimes we have to do things we know are wrong but in instances like this is it not worth fighting with your man, support your man ok. Pick your battles wisely to have  a good marriage, growing up and maturing is being able to take a back seat occassionally, it doesnt mean your weak, it shows how smart you are.|`|AA11085356	First of all, why was a 3 year old doing in a baby swing? Even if you were there watching over her, those aren't meant to hold that much weight. It could have collapsed on her.<br>  <br>  As far as replacing the swing, I would. Maybe offer her some money for it, then she can put it towards a new one since the one that was broken was used.|`|nX9qHTWwaa	Don't let it get to you. You are right. Your husband needs to focus on you and his daughters instead of his mom & sister. You should wait and let him think about it. Big mistake for him to argue with his wife.|`|AA10803292	ohh! too much drama for a mother-to-be!...evidently it DOES bother you...let your hubby handle this mess and whatever he decides, let it be...|`|8ftxES2Zaa	If he wants to buy his sister a new swing then let him.  It's his sister.  Get over it.|`|7FGsxx4Qaa	I'm sure you're right but that isn't making your relationship with your husband pleasant..Why don't you look for  a secondhand swing and give it to her yourself ? That would please everyone,especially your husband and he's the one you need to be on the right side of not your mother in law...............|`|XRX6vKNmaa	just replace it with something from the goodwill. That way they have a swing and it is not new. In case they look for ways to get new stuff from you and your husband. In the future don't let your daughter play with something you don't want to replace. As far as the stroller you can bring it up, when the swing is replaced. It will then put them in a spot weather to place yours or not. Either way your husband will see the results.|`|JE8lRn7Caa	IM sure they have freecycle on yahoo groups where you live get on there ask for a swing and give it to her, it wont cast a thing where are you any way I have an extra one.|`|3vzxSKLcaa	I agree with you- it sounds like she's making something out of nothing- that sucks.  Sounds like she just wants a new swing.|`|TljwAtxnaa	yeah i absolutely agree wid u|`|Vrdi2gL6aa	i think is BS..if its a hand me down who cares!|`|55ac03a8d518750ba6df2c938cd0df13aa	you answered your own question in the story you left.

(replace it with another "hand-me-down"). <br>  <br>  Your angry with your husband because you feel his priorties are different than yours. <br>  <br>  You need to look at the fact that YOU and NO other parent can watch their child ALL the time. (I have three!!!!! ) <br>  <br>  Ask yourself one question are you angry about the fact that your mother in law says your daughter broke the swingf or that your husband is not baking you up?<br>  <br>  Look you can not do anything about the past, just remember you only have right now.|`|IpXzFGEAaa	Oh, my.  This seems to be getting pretty heated!  Lets step back for a second, and look:  all this is about is a used baby swing that may or may not have been broken by a toddler.  You are all family.  Sometimes, even when you think your right, it is best to just suck it up and go with the flow of things.  So, you go to a second hand store or a garage sale, heck I bet if you ask around to other friends and family someone may already have one for free, and give the petty lady her stupid swing.  Your the bigger person that way, no one is suggesting you have to admit your daughter broke it, just that your willing to help out the situation.  Just try to remember, all this stress is not good for you or your new baby, and if they want to be petty let them.  Maybe they can come to your house instead?|`|OuuYoSBeaa	Well there is a weight limit on baby swings and a 3 year old should not be swinging in it nor should you have let her for the simple fact that she could break it. Now its broke, and its very possible it was because of the bigger child playing in it. Do the right thing and just buy a used swing. Go to a second hand shop, or thrift store, look in the papers and just replace the used thing. Better to do that then have a stupid fued going on cause you are determined to be right.<br>  <br>  EDIT.sitting in it or swinging in it dosnt really matter. If the swing is battery operated and she was manually pushing it, it can damage the motor, just so you know. And does it really matter if she broke it or not. Yes you want to make your point, but its causing a fight within a family, and its dumb. just go spend the 30 bucks on a used one and end the fight.
aed5cad075214254f2f176a51206a7d7aa	No, any bills paid are voluntary, the potential adopters know from the outset that the baby is not theirs until after the baby is born and legal paperwork processed.<br>  <br>  Demanding the return of money would constitute coercion and infer that a mother of a baby 'owed' her baby to the hopeful adopters.<br>  <br>  No money should change hands in adoption, the way it's practised in the USA is just a mess.<br>  <br>  ETA  Jules is mistaken, there is no legal pre-birth contract that promises the adopters a baby.   No legal 'contract' can be signed until after the baby is born.  The mother is the one and only mother until she signs away her parental rights AFTER the birth.  She owes nobody her baby.|`|8Qxb7OZOaa	The natural mother doesn't get any money...unless the Paps were participating in illegal activity and giving her bribery money on the side.<br>  <br>  They gambled with an agency's advice and lost.  If they want to invest their money unwisely its their stupidity and loss.|`|511e806a702f7f4b678843ad2696165faa	Nope.  They get nothing.  It was all a "gift" because if it wasn't, the paps would be paying for a baby.  Or paying bills in exchange for a baby.  There are no contracts that can hold the mother to giving up her baby before the baby is born.  Basically, any PAP who is willing to pay for these things should be doing it as a favor to the mother, not because they want to take her baby.<br>  <br>  You cannot enforce things like this, because then it becomes a whole other monster.|`|kf7XLE8kaa	This is one of many reasons why pre-birth matching is unethical.  Either you get screwed (which is your choice, if you're going to do something unethical, be prepared for the potential consequences), or she's going to get screwed because she feels obligated to give away her own flesh and blood because somebody gave her money.  It's the same thing as buying a baby, but as others have noted, they get around this human trafficking definition by not offering refunds if you don't get your product.|`|OQnRP6xVaa	I think that if potential adoptive parents are worried about the Money they should purchase Adoption Insurance to protect their investment in the process. Otherwise the agreement with the agency should be clear and established.<br>  <br>  I also believe that this should not happen in the first place and adoptive parents should not have contact with the mother until after the baby is born.
jCLAa8uLaa	You asked the question so here is my answer. You're heart is obviously in the right place, seeing as your not wanting to get an abortion. The next question you have to ask yourself is....... Do you want the responsibility of a 2nd child? Do to the fact that your asking the above question means your seriously doubting it. If you don't want to take the responsibility then give the responsibility to someone that wants it. Personally speaking I can't have children. So the fact that you are 15 and now have two children and are debating on whether you keep the 2nd is upsetting to say the least. The questions you are asking yourself are pretty much the questions that I ask myself on a daily basis. Let's see if I can show you.<br>  Am I ready for a baby? Your case 2nd.<br>  Do I want a baby?<br>  What will I do when it's here?<br>  Can I even afford a baby? Your case two babies.<br>  What happens if I adopt? Your case if you put the baby up for adoption<br>  Will I like who it becomes?<br>  Will the baby be healthy?<br>  Do I want the changes a baby will make?<br>  Will it make me upset?<br>  Will it make me happy?<br>  Will I be able to LOVE this baby?<br>  <br>  Did I get it even a little bit close? I hope I did. The BIG difference between you and me is that YOU can have a baby. I have to depend on others to want me to take care of their babies. Luckily you have the chance to either make your life fuller and raise this baby, or you have the chance to bless someone with a wonderful gift. Either way it is your choice, and YOU have to make it. <br>  I know that this isn't what you wanted to hear. But it is what it is!|`|A0W1ezmbaa	1st let me start out by saying THANKYOU for taking responisibility and not getting the abortion. As for putting your baby up for adoption that will have to be your choice. Obviusly you have the finacial means to raise both and it seems like the love and support of your family. However if you don't feel that you can emotionally give to both the same way then maybe adoption is the better way. There are many families looking to adopt a child into a loving home. One last thing if this is all about responisibilty well i feel like i need to say that that should have been considered before hand (u just had a baby so we know you know how they are made) I'M not trying to sound mean but every action does have a cosiquence so you need to own up to those consiquences.  Again I do applaude you however for considering what is right for your child and keep that in mind.. Congrats and i'll be praying that God will lead you to the right decision for your child|`|YNck71ahaa	first off (yes i know everyone has told you this but i'm gonna say it again) what were you thinking?!? you should have started birthcontrol straight after you delivered the first one especially since you were still having sex. <br>  second of all don't let anyone make that decision for you, if you know that you can take care of your child then do it. but if you really dont' think you can maybe you should give it up. but you have a while to decide that anyways, even after the baby is born you can still decide to keep it or give it up. Do what you feel is right for you and your family and the baby.|`|z7IYhVXzaa	I don't mean to sound shallow at all but if you knew you wouldn't be able to take care of both, why have intercourse and get pregnant again? It's really silly because you're only 15 and contributing to the teenage pregnancy epidemic. Did no one teach you about condoms? I respect that you don't believe in abortion because I don't either. I would definitely consider adoption if you are not responsible enough to take care of your actions, ie. your second baby. At least you sound like a smart girl.|`|vP8RQ9lWaa	Well that's really up to you. No one can tell you what to do with your life. I suggest you really give this some thought. Not just about your situation, but about the baby's. Are you prepared to have your child become an orphan? When he/she is 18 they may find you and hate you. Even if they find you and do not hate you, you will never have a true mother/child relationship since you missed out on all the bonding time of baby and child life. These are really the things you need to think about. You need to put yourself in the shoes of an orphan.|`|YKCIubvKaa	Children love play mates :P Right now it may be tough. Two babies so close is tough but you take it one diaper at a time. Soon they work into a schedule and it doesn't get EASY but it gets better. But later on you will have 2 kids who can keep each other company and talk to each other about whats going on. Often times a siblings help each other learn new things. Now don't get me wrong. It's perfectly fine to have just one child. There is NOTHING wrong with that. But were your pregnant and expecting I think you should welcome this baby. If in a few more months you can't seem to feel anything for this new baby maybe your right and should put him/her up for adoption. But honestly I think once you see them up on the screen or feel that first kick.. I think you'll feel too much love to give them up.<br>  I'm cheering for you and I hope you find the right answer. And I hope from now on you will take life more slow and enjoy it. Wait for the right guy ^.~|`|gvQaF0aFaa	I'm very sorry for your situation. If your parents were to pay for the food and bedding ect. you might want to keep him/her. Personally I would give the baby to someone around the neighborhood so you could have an open adoption.  If you were looking for looking for a closed adoption I would seek a professional. Again I'm sorry and I hope you find a solution to this problem.<br>  <br>  <br>  Hope this helped!|`|4SrdYUuSaa	.<br>  This made me cry.<br>  <br>  Only you can decide what is the best life for the precious innocence being brought into the world.<br>  <br>  Read my profile -- you will understand why this is so very upsetting to me.  Sacrifices are made EVERY SINGLE DAY for our children.<br>  <br>  Good luck to you in your decision.|`|OXXE3T2Aaa	If u have the room and money u need to be a women and take care of ur child if u were grown enough to open ur legs and have sex ur grown enough to take care of ur children!!!!! Stop being a selfish brat and take care of YOUR child and not try to give it away to someone else.|`|Rxi8wu5Paa	i think you should have the baby because it wouldn't be fair to give it away its your child and you no the min you see him/her you will be in love :) there are so meny ppl that cant have kids out there tat would love to be in your position right now so plz keep your child doesnt matter wat age you are your a mother|`|6VbNJOtfaa	Seriously, you have ruined your life and apparently you did not learn from the first mistake.  I say you should give them both up for adoption; a child deserves an intelligent parent, not a child who is hell bent on making the same mistake over and over.|`|2pupx6CNaa	do as much as you can for that baby stay away from the father ,don't give it uphow can sit there and look at that baby and give him up for adoption i coulnd't live with myself so think i saykeep it.|`|1cHFMzaGaa	if yall have the money an love for it then you should keep it. :)|`|1e7f68ee6a0d79eda6c821e9a33f6438aa	This baby is your family and if you give the baby up you will spend your whole life wondering if your baby is ok. If your family has money and room then he/she will be taken care of and loved. The foster care/adoption system is overloaded with children and many children do not get adopted and spend all of their lives with no family. <br>  <br>  Your baby has a family and it is you and your son. When you are 30, you will be so glad that you accepted your responsibilties as a Mom.|`|tecPZUq2aa	Do What Ever You Think Is Best.<br>  One Child Is Such A Big Responsibility- especially In Some1 So Young.<br>  So A Second Child? I Wouldn't Do It, But Im Not You.<br>  <br>  Get Rid Of The Dad, Look At The Mess He Has Caused. Once He Has Gone Tell Your Family- Study Their Reactions, Tell Them How You Feel Then You Can All Come To A Conclusion Together. <br>  <br>  You Can Bring This Baby Into The World Intending For It To Be Adopted, But Change Your Mind- That's Fine Its Your Child!<br>  <br>  Or You Can Have The Baby Adopted To Loving Parents That Have Always Wanted A Baby Of Their Own.<br>  <br>  Take Your Time And Try Not To Worry!|`|OBuzcIDbaa	Bottom line, you are way too young to be dealing with this alone. Where are your parents in this decision? And where is your common sense in getting pregnant again so soon and at your age? I do give you kudos for getting away from the abusive father.<br>  Talk to your parents. They should have a say in this decision as well. They are the ones that are being forced into being financially responsible for them. If they want nothing to do with nuturing this child and you are feeling overwhelmed with the responsibility, I'd suggest giving it up to a family that does want a baby. You have to put the child's welfare first.|`|EHY3FnAmaa	Well if your family stands behind you and is there for financial support as well as support in general. Then you should keep the baby. Imagine how hard it would be to give that little baby away after he/she was born.<br>  As  If you are a fit parent (age doesnt matter) and the baby will be going to a good home then keep the baby!|`|AA12352550	ALMOST 16 with one child and one on the way!! What are you thinking!!!???  You do what you want but geezzzzz please use protection ATLEAST!!!!!!|`|uuHPneEcaa	wow ur pregnant again and ur baby is only 4 months. U need to get on birth control.... Wow I don't know how to answer this question. U are so young.. I mean it will be kind of wrong to keep one then give the other one up for adoption. U should know better from the 1st time u got pregnant. u are just a child urself. That means u had sex right after u had ur 1st child. U need to get out of the relationship with the father that isn't good at all..<br>  <br>  Not trying to be hard on u.. just saying.. but my real answer is to keep it. BUT after this one u need to get on something okay.. cause u are very fertile once u have a baby. Make sure he wears protection too okay best of luck to u okay<br>  <br>  I am 1000% against abortion so that is WAY OUT OF THE QUESTION.|`|c3eb9cc5af710aa695ddf32e0b5e463aaa	If it were my daughter in this situation, I would suggest giving the second baby up for adoption. There are a couple of reasons I would recommend this. <br>  <br>  The first reason is that you are only 15 years old. You have already had a great deal of stress, and are already caring for a newborn. You need to have time to finish developing physically, -and- have time to make a plan for your life and be able to fulfill it.<br>  <br>  In addition, there are so many families who are eager to bring a baby into their family. Your baby may provide a family with a child that they've been waiting years for, and that is just an incredible gift to come out of a painful experience like this.<br>  <br>  If you wish, you may be able to find a family who is willing to do an open adoption, so you can still be a part of the baby's life, while giving the adoptive parents the baby they've longed for, and giving you, your current baby, and the baby you're carrying the best chance for a happy, healthy life.|`|Y5qZCpl0aa	I don't think you came on here to be criticized by completely strangers. And that's all I really see on here. I think that in your heart if you know that your not responsible enough to raise another child or your not ready for it you may think of adoption, but also maybe your heart is saying keep it. I would go with your gut. I think that you should start being safer in situations like this. I have a friend that is now 17 with two kids and her life is completely turned around..|`|UghJ0XROaa	You know obviously that you made some wrong choices, if you know you are not ready to care for this baby, yes, adoption is a good idea. But i think that's a hard decision to make for anyone. I think adoption is a better choice than abortion and i am glad you feel that way. Knowing that the choice you made in life could make a couples dream come true is a good thing.|`|RPc63EK2aa	ur too young to be soon have a 2 children...and ur first child is only 4 months...u need a birth control, girl... well, keep the 2nd one with u, i know its difficult to have a small babies, and u are not mature enough to raise these 2 kids, but still keep these two with u... if u can support the 2nd child, then go for it...who would be responsible for ur child? ofcourse, you are! be mature, u will regret if u will go for adoption. be responsible!|`|QCVzUC1baa	Have you not heard of contraception??!!<br>  <br>  You are 15! You have a 4 month old and are two months pregnant!<br>  Are you serious??????<br>  <br>  If so I think you should keep the baby and live up to your responsibilities! Silly girl.|`|aiDV9FgGaa	Apparently you don't know what is causing this. Email me and I will be glad to explain to you how pregnancy happens.<br>  <br>  Yes, put it up for adoption.|`|v0596BTeaa	Keep the baby.  Just don't have any more, ever.

ZZzQLjaKaa	TAKE THE DHA (I shouted on purpose). There are countless studies showing the importance of this fat within brain development, and the development of the eye. Some Doctors feel that you can gain this through your diet, but from what I have read your diet must be made up of the perfect components to get enough while pregnant or breast feeding.

I was using the Avent sippy cups which are similar to yours with a soft spout and no luck.<br>  When I tried the Nuby sippy cups, their whole top is soft like a baby's bottle. <br>  Here's the link <br>  <a href="http://www.nuby.com/products/cups/9661.aspx" rel="nofollow">http://www.nuby.com/products/cups/9661.a...</a><br>  <br>  But still some kids dont get it till they're older, every baby does things at their own time. My daughter certainly did!!<br>  She did things ONLY when she wanted LOL She walked at 15/16 mos.. she was perfectly healthy she just wouldnt do it. <br>  She's now 2 and she's a little tornado.. so it depends :)|`|58b352907ba2def5e2248c3df2e55128aa	My son didn't start getting the hang of his sippy cup until he was closer to a year old. I would just put it in front of him at each meal and he eventually got the hang of it. But, for the longest time he would always turn the cup upside down and try to get the water from the bottom.|`|93e5e66462cba8bcd411219422deababaa	<a href="http://www.gerber.com/Products/NUK_Learner_Cup.aspx?PLineId=60decc66-4b21-45cd-a5ac-fc1fc2cdff10&PCatId=b7533200-4df5-4295-99cd-498d36e11db5" rel="nofollow">http://www.gerber.com/Products/NUK_Learn...</a><br>  <br>   i liked these ones for that transition- thhey are very soft and are spill proof but have no stopper<br>  <br>   my son was primarily breastfed but he took bottles while i was at work- i took hom off at 11 months and this is the one he took and i gradually changed them|`|2932ee4950edd4f131a711d029cc8528aa	try the cheap take and toss cups.<br>  my 6 month old son has been able to drink from one of those since 5 months, but can't figure out the rest of them|`|HazRHf8Vaa	I have the same problem with my son (11 months), and I found out the other day by chance that he can drink straight from the rim of a cup! He isn't well at the moment and when my husband was holding him he took a sip from a glass, my son put his hand out to the glass and opened his mouth. SO my husband put the glass to his lips and when he tipped it up the baby drank from it! Obviously he is too young to hold a cup yet, but its a start. He hasn't a clue what to do with a beaker/sippy cup (I hate that term, who decided to call it that??), just bites the teat and looks confused when liquid comes out!|`|DKfScL8taa	I just put my son on the sippy cup at 8 months, I use nuk because it is silicone, but shaped like a sippy cup and you can take the handles off if you want to. So she can hold it like a bottle and just get used to the nipple part, and then you can add the handles on later. My son took right to it. <br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.drugstore.com/qxp165750_333181_sespider/gerber_nuk/learner_cup.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.drugstore.com/qxp165750_33318...</a>|`|OPTDFRuzaa	she may be too young still as my son who turned 1 today has just taken 2 feeds out of his cup for the first time. try in a few months or if she has a fav tv programme  put it on and give her the cup and see what happens. my son loves elmo so i put it on and he just drinks away out of the cup good luck.|`|HLf1QYd1aa	My wife actually got our son to switch from bottle to sippy cup by using the nuby brand sippy cup with handles. Its spout is similar to a nipple and he liked that he could hold his own cup.|`|JsqMSU9Haa	yeah, skip the sippy cup and get her a straw cup and teach her how to do it that way.|`|eytlIKITaa	Just keep offering it to her... Eventually she'll get it...  : ) Good Luck!|`|wkuCydzRaa	She clearly still isnt old enough.|`|EyKJ737daa	Sweetie, persistence is always the key but I personally didn't like the playtex sippy cup as we have that here in Australia too.  If it has a removable valve, you may want to take it out so she understands that liquid, the yummy stuff, comes out of the cup and try her like that for a few times.  You'll have to closely watch her because she'll make a huge mess hahaha!! but she will get the hang of it.  I ended up switching my youngest to a Tommee Tippee NUBY cup.  There are a couple of different tops on them but I found a soft spout one that is easily squeezed with my own fingers.  There is a similar one that I harder to squeeze and had like dimples or pimples on the top of the cup, that was the one I refused to buy. I have now got rid of them though now that she has more teeth and can bite harder (!) and have switched back to the Avent toddler spouts that still have the valves in them and she loves it now and she can't chew them so they should last longer.  She will drink out of a cup but I'm seriously not ready for a cup of water to be spilt here and there, her sisters make enough mess at the moment!!  Just keep persisting sweetie, she'll get there.  Wait till she's really thirsty too and then you may have more success.  Here's a picture of that TT Grip and Sip Nuby Cup. Hope the link works.<br>  <a href="http://www.babyzonedirect.com.au/catalogue/c13/c176/p3961" rel="nofollow">http://www.babyzonedirect.com.au/catalog...</a> <br>  xx<br>  <br>  Edit: the poster Ariana has a much better picture of the Nuby cup!!! Well done Ariana|`|PoAiGIUDaa	Maybe she isnt old enough yet. I made the transition with my son when he was 1. I bought some of the Nuby cups with the soft silicone tops. He loved them. I used them in place of a bottle too and he switched without a huge problem. I would suggest just waiting a bit longer and trying again around 1 year. Good luck!|`|Cah6nfV5aa	Just keep offering it. Eventually she'll get used to it and learn to use it. I'd give it to her a few times a day so its more familiar. Good Luck|`|rTACLd3Saa	My daughter, Avary is 10 months old now but when she was around 6 months old I bought her some of the "sippy cup" spouts that go on top of the regular Avent bottles (instead of the nipple).  She took to them just fine at first.  If you use Avent bottles you may want to try them because it's not a huge change, just a change in type of spout.  This is what they are:  <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Avent-Non-spill-Toddler-Spouts-pack/dp/B00005BQ4O" rel="nofollow">http://www.amazon.com/Avent-Non-spill-To...</a>  They make them for babies 6 months and up and they just convert the regular bottle to a sippy.  They also have big handles that are easy for babies to grip that slip over the bottle neck and the top screws over it to secure it in place.  It's awesome because it completely turns the regular Avent bottle into a sippy cup!<br>  <br>  On the other hand, although Avary took the the sippy spouts well at first, she soon decided she wanted nothing to do with them.  By 7 months of age, she was drinking directly from the cup (with me holding it of course).  She does great with it.  Now, she drinks most things from a cup and only uses a bottle at bedtime or occasionally on the go.  It's a bit more work for me, but she's happy so I'm happy.  Besides, the less bottles and nipples I have to clean, the better!  See how your little girl does straight from a cup.  I bet she'll surprise you.  Good luck!|`|AA11210211	I had the same problem with my daughter she refuses to drink out of a regular sippy cup so I tried the Tummy Tickler Apple Juice sippy cups and she loves them,they are kind of like a bottle but in sippy cup form here is a link to them,they sell them at most grocery stores in the juice aisle:<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.walmart.com/catalog/product.do?product_id=10536137" rel="nofollow">http://www.walmart.com/catalog/product.d...</a>|`|p2Njf5gBaa	Keep offering it, she'll get it eventually.  <br>  <br>  I offered a sippy cup, even when my son couldn't drink out of it.  I just did it to let him play and get familiar with it.  Then all of a sudden one day he started drinking out of it.  <br>  <br>  When first learning to drink from a sippy, babies can be picky as to which ones are best for them to learn on.  You will see that many mothers will swear by different cups.  I reccomend buying one of a few different types.  Get one with handles,  one without, one with a soft spout, one with hard spouts, and one with a med spout.  Persoanlly, I found my son had a hard time with soft spout and once trying one with a hard spout he did much better. <br>  <br>  Good luck.
XLsnuAqmaa	doctor's hear everything.  you should never be scared to tell your dr anything|`|zQWNb6neaa	I had told my child's pediatrician my symptoms at my daughter's two week checkup (he specifically asked) and he dismissed it as baby blues. It got worse as the weeks went on and I was too afraid to call my dr about it because I thought I was being silly and it would be dismissed again. Finally at my 6 week check my dr. just said "What about postpartum depression, any symptoms?" and I let loose with all of my symptoms and was immediately prescribed medication. No problems. I felt silly to have worried about it after it had been taken care of so easily. I was so grateful to have the medication and it started working within the first week of taking it. <br>  <br>  Your symptoms are concerning enough that I very seriously doubt ANY medical professional would dismiss them, especially at 8 weeks postpartum. Please call your Doctor today! You need to get this addressed you can be the mommy and wife you need to be, and more importantly- so that YOU are taken care of. Good luck, and take care.|`|CVdcrY3kaa	Please don't be afraid to tell your DR. Having PND is not your fault, it's hormonal and there is absolutely nothing you can do or did wrong to cause it. Your doctor will be able to help so much, and it will help you to feel better and enjoy your baby.|`|ed052b6f800dc43932558f491194a7b8aa	at 8weeks they will not see it as baby blues<br>  the sooner you tell him the sooner help can start, its not all about giving you pills<br>  im not sure where you are but in the UK our health visitors help a great dela with PND<br>  tell the doctor he will help you<br>  PND is a very lonely thing to suffer alone <br>  good luck x x x|`|dgRTkccBaa	Tell your doctor, he won't brush it off.  If you tell him that you believe that you are depressed he will believe you.|`|n3IoftMFaa	Oh, honey, being afraid to speak up is part of PPD. Did you know that depression is the most treated illness in North America? Yes, they write more scripts for anti depressants than any other thing! Don't be afraid - trust me, you won't be the first or the last mom that week to come in seeking help.<br>  i was so nervous to tell my doc after I had anxiety with my first (I couldn't rest, I always worried, I didn't enjoy my time with my baby, etc...) and I just went in an spilled my guts and she was like "OK, sounds pretty typical, you seem to be aware of what is going on. I can give you some medicine and I can also give you a referral to speak with a psychologist if you would like." It was over in like 10 minutes! Ha! And I waited MONTHS - all for nothing, it was taken care of so easily!
smsUZG4Iaa	well you cant get pregnant unless you ovulate, but why not try.. lol|`|bebee00e4f3a4e5d156594de8d4a527eaa	More than likely you are right. Unless it's the rare instance that she may ovulate right after her period. The only way to find that out is to buy an OPK,or a few if it says negative today. <br>  But generally you should wait after getting off birth control for a couple months and let your body get back into the natural swing of things before trying. Because most women don't get pregnant right away after stopping their birth control. <br>  <br>  She should invest in a ttc book,with tips. This way she can read and understand why you can't get pregnant unless you are ovulating. The sperm and the egg must meet. So,you've got to time it just right.|`|oHNrktxTaa	This is interesting, b/c it takes time for your cycle to go back to being "normal" & ovulating. I would agree with you, however everyone is different though & there is always a chance.|`|I4k9tQefaa	Your right about waiting for the right time to be ovulating.<br>  <br>  But anything can happen. It's actually possible to become pregnant on your period.<br>  Obviously it's not very likely at all but it's possible.<br>  Your both right.
EtCRnDJMaa	maybe you should try looking at Depends instead of Pampers|`|MxhNzW7Oaa	I have never heard of a Pampers size 7. I thought 6 was the biggest they made. <br>  <br>  You can try pull-ups. They come in 2T, 3T, 4T & 5T, I believe.|`|UgZq1pXjaa	How old is he? I know my neighbor that is 12 can wear pampers size 7 pretty good. He used to babysit my 4 yr old son that wears pampers size 7 diapers at night and was taking and wearing and wetting my sons disposable diapers. So I do know they will fit him but they are a bit snug. His mom and dad put him in diapers and they are using a youth diaper from www.bambinodiapers.com. I have seen the bambino diapers and they are happy with them.|`|wiAVa1H5aa	I don't know about the waist, but if he wears a size 5-6 in clothes the size 7 will fit him.   Otherwise, look into adult diapers or chucks pads.|`|AA12145826	They might fit. However you may want to look into the Pull-Ups or Goodnights brands of disposable underpants.|`|hgPmwYAfaa	depends would be a  better choice!|`|9kMJJ1giaa	With a 31 inch waist you might want to think about buying Depends, it is a diaper for adults.  Sounds like it might fit better than a small baby diaper.  Good Luck|`|R4GBkbiPaa	Try the depends or the size seven, any kind but what you should do is double diaper your son it will stop any leeking.
OuuYoSBeaa	sore nipples happend for me, right at, im asuming, implantion, or just after ( a week before period was due). just hang out and wait untill your period is late before assuming things, it just sets you up for a possible disappointment|`|TWm5Smlaaa	yup, sore breasts are an early sign of pregnancy, even two weeks into it.|`|P3iNXNx2aa	preggy boob pains would be towards the nipples|`|88HhRgZ4aa	definatly!|`|ZzxxcFfsaa	it usually is. you should wait a few more weeks until you start to notice more symptoms.|`|SSqwm7Vnaa	Yes, thats normal.|`|8hyxabYOaa	yes. but dont freak yourself out. it could be anything from ovulation to pms.|`|C4ibOR7Laa	yeah, but mine started down the outside my my boobs|`|eytlIKITaa	It is a pregnancy symptom and it could also be PMS... It's hard to tell most of the time...|`|sgMno1PRaa	yea, my first sign of pregnancy was sore boobs and nipples, it was about 4 days before my period was due. It doesnt mean you are pregnant though - it can be related to loads of other things too|`|ef0ef2a4a22cb84c606773ebccd24369aa	Breast tenderness can also be a pms symptom. I would think that it would be too early to have symptoms.|`|FH2iKFcJaa	yes it is a symptom. Mine were swollen and sore before I even knew I was pregnant.|`|AA10745032	youre pregnant
R3AryfXTaa	in the beginning of my pregnancy the weeks before i was due to have my period, i had cramps too. they continued until i was about 8 weeks. i now have a beautiful little girl. its nothing to be worried about:] actually during my pregnancy, the cramps were a little worse than they usually were for my period. Its called implantation cramping and it the egg attaching to the uterus. nothing to worry about unless you start bleeding good luck and congrats:]|`|ZnwKjH6waa	from wat i bin told yes... its normal... i just found out i was preg. and i bin experiencing the same thing... plus alot of it i think is just gas lol|`|Fh4B88ZGaa	Definitely- it's your uterus stretching and getting ready for the pregnancy. I had it pretty regularly until about 10 weeks, and on and off since then (20 weeks now).|`|OPTDFRuzaa	yes very normal you may even get light spotting but if it continues get help. the cramping is normal dont worry.|`|KdqaGnlwaa	yes it is! it freaked me out too! but i think it goes away once you enter your second trimester. even some light spotting, i think i spotted twice in my first trimester. but as long as there is no heaving bleeding and heavy cramping, you shouldn't worry. but if you do, then you can always call your doctor and let him/her know whats going on.|`|1xCBR1aBaa	The day my period was due I had cramping that felt like I was going to start my period but I didn't and ended up being pregnant. You may have some spotting off and on just call your doctor.  Relax and try to enjoy yourself. Don't forget to schedule your first appointment!|`|88HhRgZ4aa	Cramping can come from anything. Now that your pregnant your mind automatically assumes its to do with your pregnancy. Your body is changing in ways you could never imagine. Your best bet would be to talk to your doctor just to ease your mind.|`|9Or4EQNhaa	yes this is normal...<br>  <br>  its your womb preparing it self to carry your baby..<br>  <br>  with im first i didn't know or think i was pregnant i thought i had appendices<br>  <br>  good luck xx
PQw92IGHaa	It sounds like she is having a lot of the symptoms, and some people don't show positive on their tests until later in the pregnanct.  Did you use the first morning sample?  I hope your blood test comes back positive!  Good luck!|`|oUcLSDZ6aa	Your story sounds promising. Might I ask which brand of HPT you used? Some of them out there are really crappy. <br>  <br>  I'll keep my fingers crossed for you, and everyone else who is trying, including myself. <br>  <br>  Good luck. Try to be patient. Tomorrow will come, even if it's not soon enough.|`|fYMWDQLGaa	Hi Ur partner really has lots of symptoms to tell that she is pregnant.... many women doesnt get positive results.. change in skin on her face.. did u mean tht she loooks very pale.. tht means yes its a symptom too...<br>  <br>  I pray and hope that u ll get a positive tomo in the blood result.<br>  <br>  <br>  Goodluck to u n yr partner..|`|LY2LSzPJaa	I would be surprised if she is not pregnant , sure sounds like all the right symptons to me. I hope she is , let me know please when you findout , I will say a prayer guys ! <br>  I am pretty sure she is though with those signs and symptons how can she not be. <br>  GOOD LUCK AND GOD BLESS<br>  <br>  email:ambertrip930@yahoo.com|`|byn31lUVaa	First let me say that I hope you both get a POSITIVE with the blood work.  From what it sounds like, she could be pregnant.  However if the blood work doesn't come back positive do not loose hope.  Keep trying and get more of the FIRST RESPONSE pregnancy tests as they are the best.  If she gets to her next period and misses it let your dr. know and make another appt.  My husband and I were not ttc in Dec. but I didn't have my period and we took a number of tests finally got into the dr. and blood work came back negative.  Come Jan. I got my period right as usual so they say i just missed a month (which DOES NOT HAPPEN for me) or my favorite is it was from stress (planning a wedding in 6 mos and dealing with in-laws I never missed one).  I'm praying for you both and hopefully it comes back positive!
8qw0Cdqiaa	I've been thinking a lot about your question lately because I am going through a difficult situation with my daughter as well.  Just yesterday she was hauled off to the principal's office kicking and screaming because she didn't want to colour like the rest of the class.  I'm wondering if what your daughter is experiencing is sensory overload.  Could it be that the classroom was too noisy or busy and that she could not process what she needed to do?  My daughter is not one to conform so I applauded her efforts to stick up for herself.  THe classroom can be a difficult place for some kids and your daughter may be experiencing similar anxieties.  I would keep close track of when she complains about the voices.  Note the time of day, situation and emotions surrounding it.  I think that her behavior is just in response to stress.  We all deal with stress differently and kids often are limited as they don't know how to express themselves well yet.  Consider some therapy sessons but I would definitely avoid any extreme medical interventions at this point.  She is 5 after all and still relatively a baby.|`|hJX6Ur3taa	You don't need a doctor, you need a deliverance minister.  I know you think I'm nuts, but my 3 year old daughter had friends we couldn't see and would act violent and say things I know she has never heard.  Please just think about what I'm telling you.  If you don't, she will never get better.|`|aSRHdWIYaa	Maybe at her next check up mention it to the doctor.  If it gets out of hand again, take her in before her next checkup.<br>  <br>  I don't know what else to say about this.  I'm Sorry!|`|a8Pq2Lmdaa	You poor thing and your poor child!  I am so sorry for your troubles.  I would doubt it is for attention.  If it were she would switch to something else if she is not getting attention for it.<br>  Please get her to a doctor you trust and then another one for a second opinion.  The poor thing.<br>  <br>  There are types of seizures that kids kinda go into their own little world and space out.  They are not the same as the flop around on the floor kind.  If she had a space out seizure and then heard the voices it could be related.  Let the doctor do the EEG to see if she has been having seizures.  What fo they want to admit her for?  I would do it as long as it is NOT for a psych eval and that you can take her home at any time.  A voluntary admit should also be able to a voluntary discharge.
F2JEvYX7aa	That is normal, but just to let you know it might take awhile for you to get pregnant because of being on depo for so long. But good luck, I wish you the best.|`|oUcLSDZ6aa	You should always talk to your doctor about clotting larger than a quarter. If you are in pain, or start to get cramping you should go to your local emergency room. Otherwise, if it was just the clot, and everything else seems normal, give your doctor a call and give them the heads up, they'll point you in the right direction.|`|KoIMEqnUaa	I was on the depo too..for 4+ years. I would talk to your doc about the clot, just to inform him. I had trouble getting back to normal with my period when I was on it, it took a good 6-8 months. Now,  Im doing great and dont think I will ever be on that again. Oh definately dont smoke with this depo thats what my doc said.|`|9Or4EQNhaa	hi <br>  <br>  i would go see your doctor..<br>  <br>  it could be because u haven't had a period in a long time...<br>  <br>  i miss periods n i would clot an awful lot until a week after my period im due to see gyne on 2nd march <br>  <br>  so i say just go n get checked just to be save if your planning to be come pregant|`|oquQpY18aa	its normal..........i get those all the time!
Ll6VpvLxaa	I think it'd look better as Mackenzie Ashton.|`|3AfQ9UXYaa	um... okay. Not sure what is going on but if you know your situation and know you are not in the wrong then you shouldn't let others get to you like that.|`|oYmZUO8Caa	I don't get it either.

That makes it even worse...|`|AjqO1aJgaa	Why is your grand-DAUGHTER getting two boys names? Ew. Poor kid.|`|kPl8TTzNaa	Poor kid. Both names are masculine and horrible for a girl.

ybGG1U0saa	As a parent with teens ranging from 16- 19 years old. I can tell you that its not always a bad thing. The problems that unfortunately show up are when the older friends (18-19), meet up with their older friends. The younger members of the group get dragged into situations they are not ready to handle. Only the strongest ones opt out and go home. Your parents are not trying to hold you back. They just want to be the stronger ones. Beleive me I almost lost my oldest because of his older friends and they are good teens. Just remember you will have a lot of time to be older. Enjoy|`|wCwCp3BCaa	No its not wrong, im 17 and i have friends that are over 18. Ur 16 so ur not that far apart. As long as they are true friends, i don't think there is a problem.|`|P4CADDPdaa	My parents don't have a problem with me having adult friends that they don't know. I'm almost 15 and I have guy friends that range from 19-22. Not a big deal.|`|4HvuxHPoaa	I'm 15 and i hang out with kids from 14-19. Same as you Nothing sexual just friends. We just hang out talk. Nothing wrong with that.|`|w9TzZCt8aa	nope i hang around with people up to the age of 15 and i am12|`|rB3cyt0Paa	no im 15 and i have friends over 20 jk . but no it's ok|`|93e5e66462cba8bcd411219422deababaa	no- there is not much difference between 16 and 18- i was 16 in senior classes where most of them were 18. i was 16 when my boyfriend had just turned 18- been together for 5 1/2 years now- he graduated the year before me|`|Av9jeRAkaa	nope, i dont, i have friends through the range 14-17<br>  and im 15|`|aQ8o4w3Xaa	Friendship shouldn't, and doesn't, have an age limit. Friends are friends, no matter what the age, male or female. Just concentrate on being friends with them, don't let prejudice affect it.<br>  <br>  Good luck!<br>  :)|`|zdGpaFlfaa	no, when i was like 13-15 i use to hang out with this senior couple they were in their 60's. it was fun they lived on a llama farm. but i moved so i dont see them much anymore|`|7scxfyABaa	i'm almost 18 and my two best "girl" friend are 15 years old and my best "guy" friends are 16 and 22.<br>  <br>  its not wrong or weird at all|`|hUdKYtegaa	nooo thts gayy! i have friends that are alot older then me! & + i hang out with my sisters friends && she has ones tht are like 30! its not a big deal! as long as u dnt have sex with them!|`|I0GqKJ0aaa	Well, not really, but I can try and see it from a parents point of view, if that's the problem (I'm 20, by the way). It really depends on how well you know and are comfortable with them. It might not be sexual now, but 19 year olds are at a VERY different maturity level than 16 year olds. Also, they're gonna be able to drink soon and your parents might not want you caught up in that. I know lots of people that have friends of different ages and I do as well, but try to look at it from the parents point of view and why they'd be concerned. Good luck and be safe! :)|`|8XcRFF6Taa	No it's not wrong when I was your age I hung out with older people BUT I do have to say, if my 16 year old daughter was hanging out with older boys( platonic or not) I wouldn't approve:)  Its nice to hear that you are all just friends but your parents don't know that...... even if that's what you tell them:)|`|hZf8aJkYaa	It depends on what is going on,if you are in with a good crowd, if they are mature, if they are responsible etc.|`|mbh3eex7aa	No there is nothing wrong with that. Its only a 3 year difference.|`|HzUM8hVSaa	it's not wrong if you're not doing anything illegal.|`|3765e3159658220a8cc965318bdc4e05aa	I don't see what the problem is.

3NoDjKLoaa	you can go around to your neighbors, or post up an ad on craigslist (i dont know if they do that in the UK) or post up a sign around the neighborhood, or at your local grocery.. go to the parks around you and talk with some of the parents.. Say that you are just starting out, but know what to do with a child and you are willing to help out when a parent needs them, say things like "would you need a bit of time to take a phone call, or go to the store, or clean up the house" without having to watch the child, you can come in and play with the child.  Any little bit of time you spend with a child is gaining experience, plus references.|`|rB3cyt0Paa	oh down below is a website where you can create a profile and peopel all over the world can see how great baysitter you are and hire you<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.care.com/" rel="nofollow">http://www.care.com/</a>|`|xJKJDyyMaa	start off with family and family friends and word will eventually get out if your a trustworthy babysitter have them tell thier friends and you should do pretty well|`|ejelObdJaa	tell ur friends about it so they could help u spread the word.|`|ZDqdYhdGaa	I would start with family and friends and get experience there. You will always have a challenge because you are a male. To be honest, I have nothing against men, but I wouldn't hire a male babysitter. There are people who would so don't be discouraged. <br>  <br>  Once you get some experience with family and friends of the family, then you can create a profile on babysitting websites. (If you don't have any experience a mother is not likely to hire you since you are a stranger.)<br>  <br>  Good Luck!|`|SEzIkGNiaa	Start by handing out flyers to neighbors/people you know with children.  If you don't know any, you could ask people if they know anyone that needs a babysitter.  On the flyer put:<br>  <br>  Name<br>  Number or Email<br>  Age<br>  Rates<br>  Experience<br>  Availability/Flexiblity<br>  <br>  **Please do not advertise over the internet, as it is very dangerous!<br>  <br>  Good Luck!<br>  <br>  :)|`|LbNXxRXnaa	First you need to become certified. You may take classes online, in person, or both. Make sure the online classes are real! Then, make flyers advertising yourself and post them around your neighborhood! Make sure you have permission and that it is allowed in your neighborhood. You may want to post one in a public place, like a store. Good luck!
vue9NOhYaa	Milk first, then solid foods. (You don't want her filling up on solids, which are still just for fun.)<br>  <br>  Any time of day is fine, though I'd avoid giving new foods at bedtime. (You don't want to be up all night with a bad reaction.) <br>  <br>  I didn't have any particular pattern at first with my daughter. Just whenever was convenient.|`|CVdcrY3kaa	Milk first, and then solids. If you're bottle feeding you can offer them in the morning in case of an allergic reaction. However, if you're breastfeeding most women have less milk towards the end of the day so you can offer it to your baby then, just keep a close eye on him/her. <br>  <br>  <br>  I'm breastfeeding and I started around 5pm. I still had a few hours before her bedtime and I always checked on her a few extra times at night when I introduced something new.|`|JXHy2EHQaa	Breastmilk first, then 'solids'.  Whenever she's in a good mood.  You can feed just about anything, except egg white, peanut butter/nuts, and shellfish.  Don't bother with rice cereal...the only good thing about it is it doesn't stain.  Don't start with wheat either, gluten is a highly allergic 'food'.  Banana, sweet potato, avocado....whatever you're eating that day :)|`|IDS64Eh8aa	Milk first, at this age it's more important than food. Lunchtime is the best first time, up until now my daughter only wants milk in the morning and you wouldn't want to risk upsetting her tummy in the evening. Email me if you want any specific info, good luck|`|VU4DLpnlaa	if you haven't already start with baby rice made with some of your child's milk, then move on to 'solid' foods. my daughters first solid food was a cow and gate 1st stage jar. they do all sorts of flavours and different stages (1st is completely smooth, 3rd has bits in like peas and stuff).<br>  <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wsWbswJrbg" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wsWbswJr...</a> that's a vVidaof my daughter having her first ever solid food.|`|c3eb9cc5af710aa695ddf32e0b5e463aaa	I gave mine their first solid foods at either lunch or dinner. I nursed first, because at this point, they're not getting much nutrition from solid foods. They'll still be getting most of their nutrients from nursing or formula until they're about a year - 18 months old and can have a widely varied solid-food diet.<br>  <br>  Choose the foods you start with carefully. I would avoid egg whites, cow's milk products, and grains as starters (yes, I know most people recommend starting with cereal, but there are just as many professionals who feel that starting with cereals can cause allergies and digestive problems later on). I started mine on fruits and things like sweet potatoes, squash, etc. I had the luxury of making my own baby food, so the little ones usually got some of what we were eating for dinner, pureed in a little blender. That way, I knew that they were getting good food, and not a lot of chemicals. Mine loved sweet potatoes, squash, apples, apricots, peaches, pears, and bananas early on, and these foods are really well tolerated by most babies and don't tend to cause a lot of allergic reaction. Berries, grains, and dairy products, as well as 'dessert' style baby foods should probably wait until the baby is at least a year old -- especially stuff thickened with cornstarch or containing wheat, egg, milk, soy, or tree nuts.<br>  <br>  Stay away from 'mixed' foods, and only give one new food a week to start. Start with just about a teaspoon the first day, and as long as the baby doesn't have problems with it, increase it by a teaspoon or two a day, until you are feeding as long as the baby is interested in the food. After a couple of months, you can give two foods at a time that the baby has already shown that he or she is ok with. If you give a food, and the baby develops a rash, gets fussy, has bad gas, or seems uncomfortable, don't give that food again. You can try it again in 6 months (his or her digestive system may not be ready for it yet). If a reaction develops a 2nd time, then scratch that food from the list.|`|YKCIubvKaa	Your baby got their teeth? I started giving mine the teething cookies. I give it to him at dinner so he can nibble on it while we're eating and get a sense of fitting in at the dinner table. Depending on how many teeth he/she has depends on what you should try. Mine only has 2 coming in so the teething cookie is the best.<br>  Have you done the baby oatmeal/rice. You start with that mixed with formula. No added flavors. The taste of the formula will encourage him/her to eat. Also I recommend feeding with a spoon not in the bottle. It helps teach them the chewing motion. As time goes on you can add in the baby fruits into the oatmeal/rice. Doctors say to only try one flavor at a time separated by a few days to see if there is any allergic reactions. I didn't do this >.> but just in case.<br>  For lunch you can do it as well. I actually started giving mine a teething cookie at this time while I fed his older brother. Than I gave him a bottle. Later when I can feed him without the baby cereal I probably will give him straight out baby fruit. Right now he would find it gross even though its the same stuff I mix in his breakfast >.> I guess the formula taste is the only thing keeping him going.<br>  Than dinner could be the same.<br>  Honestly I only feed mine oatmeal with the baby fruit/veggies. (The mashed stuff not actual pieces) And only at breakfast and dinner cause mine is messy and I will be giving him a small bath afterward. Lunch is awesome for those teething cookies ^.~ followed by a bottle.<br>  As for real milk. Doctors say wait till 1 before you do. However I sneak in a bottle of real milk here and there to test to make sure he was ok with it. I could switch him right now if I wanted but I get free formula :P|`|5DfSfyWfaa	I do lunch incase he does have a reaction it won't be the middle of the night (and I felt weird feeding him peas at 9am). I try to catch him when he hungry but not starving yet. And I do bottle after.|`|PoAiGIUDaa	Try some rice cereal in a bowl mixed with the formula after the morning bottle and see how it goes. At 6 months, my son wasnt really on a solid food schedule.
xLNl0f14aa	Hey!! my brother was like this when he was little. his pedi actually had my mom take him to the childrens center and they tested him for sleep disorders .. it turned out he had nightmares/terrors and would hold his breath in his sleep and in turn freak out and wake up because he wasnt breathing. He wouldnt watch tv..he stopped playing with his toys or my other younger brother/ the dr at childrens said it was because he was still living out his dreams in his world because he was to young to differentiate between reality and dream. He was then sent to a neurologists who showed my mom calming techniques and massages and ways to make reality real to him and make him realize it was all a dream.or nightmare i mean.  Once he could start sleeping right through the night he stopped being so fussy during the day because he was no longer cranky from lack of sleep. my mom no longer had to shower with him in the exersaucer so he could see her and hes really doing great hes five now and started kindergarten and is doing awesome..|`|3331cf16d944d6e25fdb82bfbdfed4c8aa	My third child was a high contact baby.  She needed a lot of touch (and still does even now at age 13) so it may be a temperament issue you have to deal with.  Almost every photo we have of her under age 5 she is being held in arms or by the hand, or piggyback.   <br>  <br>  If you have a sling or backpack you can keep him close to you and still have free hands to get things done.  It's not worth your energy to entertain him constantly, when all he really needs is to feel your closeness.   If you think about other cultures, you will discover many different kinds of baby carriers that strap the baby to the mother and which were used until the baby was 2-3 years old.<br>  <br>  Hope this helps.|`|930a625eb301aae633a9b9d8e18e0752aa	No one thinks your a stupid mom. Sometimes it's the obvious that we miss.<br>  At this point mom let him scream. The Dr gave him a clean bill of health I'm assuming, so let him. <br>  He needs to figure out that mom can't be holding him and entertaining him every second. He needs to be able to do things by himself for a little bit. You need the sanity of being able to go finish laundry and a good nights sleep. <br>  It won't hurt him any. <br>  Would you be able to let another child cry it out? Sometimes it's easier to know what to do if you detatch for a moment and think about it in terms of what would I do if this was so and so's child?<br>  I had to do that with my second.<br>  I'm not saying become distant with him, just look at it objectively, not in mom mode.|`|ZZzQLjaKaa	You have already identified the problem: sleep. You are all suffering together. Stop looking for something to cheer him up during the day and deal with the real cause of his problem, sleep. It will not get better until you deal with this concern. The neuroscience of sleep, is that sleep begets more sleep. So a child that does not sleep well at night is less likely to nap well. You would think it would be the other way around, but it is not. I highly recommend you read Healthy Sleep Habits, Happy Child by Marc Weissbluth, MD. Skip right to 7, Months 13-36 and follow the plan to a T. I am telling you that book changed my families life when it came to helping my daughter. The plan he prescribes is excellent, but above all you have to be consistent. Good Luck...but deal with the sleep. If you started tonight in one week you could have a totally different kid. To me, that would be worth it.
Rxi8wu5Paa	may be you shoul just wait till maybe next week to do another test <br>  <br>  best of luck|`|nVeZzuFvaa	You could be pregnant, but I would wait at least until the day AF is due to re-test. Sometimes the hormone we produce when we become pregnant does not show up in a urine test until a week after AF is due. Its different for all women. If your period does not come, and you still get negative tests and are concerned, see your OBGYN for a blood test. <br>  <br>  I am TTC as well, and I know its so nerve-racking! Sometimes you just "feel" pregnant, but then you get a negative test and AF shows its face! boo! Well good luck and baby dust!!!!!!
el8yX5q3aa	the main problem is the children.  They come first.  If there is danger you have to  keep the cat locked up in another room.<br>  <br>  We had a cat that got more aggressive as the years went by.  We had to hole him up in the bedroom when the grandbabies came over and when we left the house.  She would chase our dog and jump on his back and bite him.  It wasn't until she jumped up and bit my husbands bicep and took a chunk out of it when we decided...since that was the only person she liked..it was time to go.<br>  <br>  We had her put down.  She was 9.  I talked to our vet to see if there was some reason or something to be done.  She took tests to make sure there was nothing physical about her.  (Our son has a cat that was really viscious but she had two infections in her kidneys and she was really mean until we got this controlled).  The only two options we had was to sedate her and let her sleep her life away or put her down.  Finding a home was impossible..we tried..but we had to be honest about her aggressiveness.  <br>  <br>  We had her put down.  There was no other choice.  You cannot allow an animal to attack others or people and say you have to feel sorry for the animal and let it live.  I am not heartless.  I cried for days over this decision....but harm to my family and not having my grandbabies come over here was worse.<br>  <br>  <br>  Don't put her outside...to fend for herself...don't take her to the pound...take her and have her put down and be there thanking her for her love !  There is a time to let go and do it with love.<br>  <br>  By the way..to those that think this was wrong...two vets told me...aggressiveness in animals only gets worse.  It does not get better.  You cannot give that problem to someone else!|`|JsqMSU9Haa	your cat is a cat - your brother and baby are humans - sorry but their safety comes first.  bye bye cat - call the spca - maybe a family without kids can adopt it|`|hZf8aJkYaa	Can you declaw it?|`|vbAu5SY3aa	My cat does stuff like that, but it is out of fear. She doesn't show her fear, but I know she is because I have seen what sets her off. My cat got a bit paranoid after she was severely attacked by another cat. I just make sure to give her vitamins and that seems to help, I don't know why. I have also wondered about medicines that calm your pet, if they would work or not.<br>  I try to put my cat in a calm relaxed mode when she gets like this. I have a heat lamp I turn on and then I hold my cat and stroke her until she is relaxed. I do have to make sure she agrees to this since she is easily "freaked" out. She also has a safe place she goes to hide in.<br>  I don't know your cat, so I am not sure what is setting her off.|`|wUooHVU3aa	There is no decision to be made here. Contact your local humane society this morning. Make arrangements to transport the cat to their adoption facility. It will take you roughly 30 minutes to fill our their adoption form, pay the $50 fee, and say your last goodbye. They will locate a home setting where the cat won't be around children.<br>  <br>  I had a cat for 13 years and took fantastic care of her. The minute she started urinating on my son's clothing, taking swipes at his face, and trying to attack him while he slept, the decision was made. The Human Society located a single person, to adopt her, 2 weeks later.
FsXTyGH9aa	go to your doctor
sbeoF50gaa	you can get pregnant even if he "pulls out" the pre-***, or the "lubricant" he produces has sperm in it... you can get pregnant having sex even if ur on birth control. there is no 100% safe way to have sex...|`|wzM5WB8Xaa	No, not at all. Didn't you know that you get pregnant when the baby fairy flies over you and casts a spell to put a baby in your womb? All of this stuff that you have heard about having unprotected sex, being fertile, and having someone "nut???" in you are all fiction. So, don't worry, if you haven't seen the baby fairy, you are in the clear. Doesn't anyone pay attention in sex ed anymore???|`|FASzVGrraa	your not being serious...UNPROTECTED SEX MAKES BABIES!! aahhhhh!|`|FIG58FVpaa	To the girls credit... They aren't teaching sex ed in quite a few states anymore and parents aren't talking about the "birds and the bees" apparently.<br>  <br>  To answer your question, though, you absolutely can get pregnant any time you have unprotected sex. Even if he doesn't "nut" in you... If he's in you without any protection (condom/birth control pills/etc.) you can get pregnant!|`|xNkmK0SHaa	No.  You can only get pregnant from a toilet seat.|`|H9t63i4Kaa	Yep!!!|`|vue9NOhYaa	Yes.<br>  <br>  Sigh....|`|WnlzScIyaa	UMMMM, YES! But there is only a 20 to 30% chance that a woman can fall pregnant each month. So although it only takes 1 sperm, and your chances are higher when you are fertile, it is not a FOR SURE thing that you will be pregnant.|`|4a1f0aab531da428cf287e5f3a844c67aa	Please, for the love of GOD, tell me you're joking.....<br>  <br>  the answer is yes, dear<br>  *shakin my head, praying she's joking....*|`|AA10745032	dueh!!!|`|LY2LSzPJaa	yes , that is common sense girl! of course !|`|jBIaUfUzaa	lol ha ha ha good one shannon
sbeoF50gaa	I asked the people at Planned Parenthood 2 days ago "what age are kids starting to have sex now" she said "around 13 and 14 usually but we get younger" I wanted to CRY!!! I'd take them with you! 14 is much too young for sex and at the perfect age where they wanna TRY IT :(( I feel for you.<br>  <br>  OK I've thought about this some more.. and if that was MY daughter at your house and you left her unattended with your son, I'd be pretty pissed.  You should also talk to your son about his intentions and allow him to be honest. If he's wanting to have sex, you can't stop him, but you can help him be safe. I'm not saying let the boy have sex in your house as long as he's using a condom, but don't push him away to where he rebels against you and starts hiding everything from you.|`|aOCfLAJJaa	Only leave them if you <br>  1.) Fully trust that they will not have sex<br>  2.) Know they will be responsible<br>  3.) Live in a Neighborhood where you know your neighbor would tell you if anything happend.|`|add1238669d46216eb94b39fb19e0553aa	sorry but my first rule would be no girls in the bedroom and no friends of the opposite sex over without parental supervision. that may sound harsh but im a firm believer that we cant tell our kids what they can and cant do sexually but we can make it a little more difficult.|`|8j7FCEOraa	I say dont leave the house<br>  ****, 12 year olds are having sex these days<br>  I dont know your son, but chances are if they are on the bed cuddling they might go Way farther while your gone|`|aBqJhdufaa	My friend's a girl and she's 14 and she has a boyfriend (it's like her 5th lol). She's gonna wait. They're home alone plenty and she's still a virgin, so it depends on your son and his girlfriend. <br>  It depends on their personality. Kids judgement differs. I would say you should probably just ask to talk to your son and tell him pretty flat out that he shouldn't do anything he would regret. And give him reasons. BUT, don't tell him not to, because it just glorifies it. So make sure he knows what the consequences are. But try and make it brief, and not awkward. <br>  I don't know if he even will, though, so it also depends on how much you can trust him. <br>  Hope I helped!<br>  <br>  Edit:<br>  I'm a 13 year old guy and I wouldn't do it, if that changes anything.|`|9fDkrrFyaa	Tell them you are going out the house for a bit, and tell them you want them to stay in the living room while you are not there. They will get the message.<br>  Well, this is if your son respect your wishes (not all children listen to their parents).  <br>  <br>  or <br>  <br>  Tell the girlfriend to go home, and come back when an adult is their to supervise them at the house. (You are the parent and you run the show)|`|pJieNfzOaa	i'm 14 and yea when i go round my boy friends house we do go to his room and watch a film on his laptop on his bed and cuddle..etc and his mum seems fine with leaving the house and often does... but yea well i would stay if i were you! it's just well, we do more if we know his mums not home...nothing like THAT though! Well do you trust him?, how long are you going to be? and can you take them with you?|`|0TEvBSQyaa	I know you have mannnnny answers but i am 15 years old, and have been going out with my boyfriend for just over a year. We didnt start going round eachothers houses until 6 months into the relationship!

I did lose my virginity to him though, which i am proud of and not ashamed of it, but i'm just saying this can happen with your son.<br>  You need to think whether you trust your son and if he did end up having sex what would you do? First of all it's good you have the door open for the first few weeks, then learn to trust him, and tell him you do and if he shuts the door obviously you don't know whats going on but if you walk in and he's having sex or whatever, make sure you punish him like grounding him. <br>  <br>  But yes, many do this nowadays but most end up having sex<br>  You have to trust him and tell him not to.<br>  <br>  Cazzy xoxoxoxo|`|5h0nUQODaa	14 year olds cuddle of course, the fact that they have the door open is a sign to you that they can be trusted -if they had it shut I would worry.<br>  <br>  however, seen as they have the door open and are completly open about the cuddling i would trust them. perhaps pop him a phone whilst you are out though just to check up.|`|ejelObdJaa	just tell him how u feel... not in front of his girlfriend but u call him and tell him ... then leave... theyre probably not gonna do nothin =P|`|JjXFj2EBaa	They shouldn't really be allowed in his bedroom together at all|`|mGvSEY6Saa	well i'm 15 and so is my boyfriend, and we lie and cuddle each other on a sofa or on one of our beds or something and our parents don't really have a problem with it, maybe because they know we wouldn't abuse their trust or do anything we're not meant to, because we are aware of the consequences...they should be fine on their own, just trust them :)<br>  also try to avoid having to go out while they are like that in future maybe?<br>  <br>  EDIT: reading the other answers, everyone assumes that they are going to have sex or something, stereotypical, most teenagers are NOT like that, there is nothing wrong with cuddling, and for all they know thats all it is going to be, you cannot just assume they are going to have sex when you do not know the people you are talking about.|`|Po2UqfvWaa	oh i've been there. got 8 kids ranging from 11-25. i didn't allow dating until 16 and for the most part that turned out very well. however, i would simply tell your son you are leaving and he and his friend need to come out of his room. there is no need to explain unless he chooses to be embarrassed. i have a daughter that's 18 and cuddles with everyone. that's her. but i also know the difference. it's your home, don't be afraid to set things right for you|`|oVxr5B3Eaa	To be honest, i don't think you have much to worry about. if they have enough respect to leave the door open, then they aren't trying to hide anything. <br>  He will definitely appreciate the fact that you can trust him to be alone with his girlfriend for a little bit and not watch over them like a hawk. <br>  And believe me.. Most kids,, if they're going to do something like that, they're going to do it whether you are watching them or not. Say they WERE going to do something and you didn't leave; well, they'd just do it another time when they have a chance. <br>  I would trust them. I know it's difficult but if you restrict him too much, he's much more likely to rebel. <br>  Maybe, if you have a good relationship with him, pull him aside and ask if he can behave himself while you step out for a few minutes. Tell him you'll only be gone 15 minutes (even if your gone longer), than they know their time is short and they won't be as likely to do anything. <br>  Also, remember that not every guy (or girl) is going to try something. You see MANY questions on here of young teenage couples that have been dating for months and haven't even kissed, or are asking how they ask their girlfriend to make out. Many wait by their OWN decision. <br>  There are other times they are alone. Please trust him!|`|xNEhI9XOaa	You have to lay it out on a plate.  Explain to them in simple language that they are too young to have S E X and they are certainly not doing it in your house.<br>  <br>  If something goes wrong it could ruin their lives.|`|1thzSbS8aa	Are you SERIOUS? No, mine are not allowed to behave this way. They're not allowed to have their boyfriends/girlfriends in their bedrooms at all, let alone lie on the bed making out. They're flat out too young. <br>  <br>  If you leave them alone, you're definitely laying it out on a plate for them. Be the parent. Tell him it's time for his girlfriend to go home.<br>  <br>  Her parents might not want their daughter to be doing that either, you know, and it IS happening in your house, where you're supposedly in charge. How would they feel knowing you left them unsupervised, to do whatever?|`|sgMno1PRaa	i dont think you should stop this as then he will only rebel - what you need to do is leave them and trust them and then as soon as you get the oppurtinity, you need to speak to him about it - as awkward as it may be - you need to talk about sex and contreception and get it straight, all your rules and respect. Children wont be stopped - you just have to advise and engourage them in the best ways possible.|`|smsUZG4Iaa	make her leave or you dont leave. they WILL have sex no doubt about it.. i wouldnt take the chance..|`|QiC1648vaa	do you trust your son ?<br>  do you think he would go against your trust?<br>  <br>  many 14 year olds are like this but they just want to explore the opposite sexs body and if you trust your son he wont do anything stupid and you should also sit him down and talk to him about sex and what can happen if no protection is used. its hard at first but when you get into the conversation it will be easier for him to come and talk about things more openly aswell.<br>  <br>  hope this has helped good luck|`|yotUSWcIaa	Do you trust him?<br>  Do you trust yourself?<br>  <br>  Only you can answer that.<br>  <br>  It's normal for them to be cuddling :)   But of course, whatever you feel safe with.

But, if you want to make sure he doesn't do anything try calling him a lot while your gone.|`|2274dcf5eba0ee2ef3aabbe2c8b0a89daa	make them come with you.... ikd but i know i had sex when i was 15 and would have when i was 14 but his mother came home.. so what does  that say.. and im 27 that was years ago.. <br>  <br>  good luck.|`|AA11964833	Ask them if they want ot come with you and get some food at least then you can kekp an eye on them|`|vB9y0Twqaa	im 13 and you should trust him i lay on my bed wi ma boyfriend but we dont do enything n ma mates do that n they dont do anything!!<br>  TRUST HIM|`|iPszwd8Baa	This is windys friend em, and I have personal experience. <br>  <br>  When I was fifteen, (still am fifteen) <br>  I started dating a sixteen year old. <br>  hes a really nice guy and i love him to death, his mom was doing basically what you were, was going out and came in and sat with us and talked about sex with us, told us she expected us to be good, and expected us to behave, and told us she didnt want any grandbabies out of us prematurely, <br>  <br>  it has been very close to sex, the heat of the moment type thing with us, but everytime we are about to do something we might regret he says, or I say depending on which one of us thinks of it first "mom"... everything kinda shuts down and we think about it and talk it over. we have been dating now for 6 months and three weeks...  and she talked to us the second week of our relationship.... it really made us think, and constantly makes us think about the way the relationship should go, I would think about that because I know it worked for us and we are both still virgins.|`|ssjg2wVvaa	he is too young for all this but i think you need a chat with him when his girlfriends not their - about relationships and how to respect girls<br>  maybe tell him it's ok to hang out at your house but as long as the bedroom door always stays open, maybe talk to her parents about what their allowed to do at her house<br>  but you defo need to talk so you can come to an agreement and hopefully built trust so you can leave the house with them alone<br>  gd luck|`|9FoFYfvdaa	im 16..<br>  n thats wut all teenagers do in realtionships..<br>  they like to cuddle..<br>  n lay together..<br>  its normal..|`|dYI2r7Ylaa	Does the name Alfie Patten tell you anything? If not - google it!...|`|HuXAcy6Qaa	it depends if you trust him and if you think hes a good kid. I personally wouldn't cause even if he is a good kid she could just come on to him and it'd be hard to resist. That's normal to cuddle maybe not in a bed but on the couch. Depends how there doing it there kinda young for that but kids grow up fast these days.|`|rzLGCrlfaa	i was having sex at 14 so its really on what kind of girl she is because hes going to be trying|`|w9TzZCt8aa	i would just leave them, they will be ok if you trust him. it will prove that he respects you|`|dB6MR0wYaa	hormones are RAGING at that age. of course theyre gonna do something once youre gone|`|LByNvF1Daa	Oh my! First I think it's rude for the girlfriend to come over to your house and do that. I wouldn't leave them alone, just take them with you or tell the girlfriend it's time to go home. I'm sure you can handle this situation the right way, good luck!!|`|7KvzDwwXaa	I dont think they will do anything. Unless shes a bit .. (loose)...|`|SrTY4lrDaa	I know it is expensive but i recon you need a CCTV Camera for his bedroom! lol! <br>  I say you make them go out for a while, maybe take them out with you and they don't have to come directly with you just maybe near you so you know what they are doing!<br>  They may enjoy it!!!<br>  Good Luck!|`|XKrdLIGnaa	he wont do anything unless u let him buy condoms|`|HaeYC2p8aa	nowerdays most couples are like that.  just talk to him about it and ask him if he knows what he is doing|`|LmgDTXTlaa	To put your mind a little at rest i hope.<br>  <br>  I was 14 not too long ago. I am 21 with a 8 month old daughter. I was NOT having sex at 14. I maybe thought about it BUT I never did anything. My boyfriend and I used to lay on my bed and cuddle and well, nothing happened. Not even when my mum went out. I cant speak for your son as we know that now a days some children very young have sexual relationships BUT not all of them. If you trust your son then leave him if you don't call him out his room making out you want to tell him where your going or whatever and ask him. He will surely know about sex and well, him knowing that you know this fact may put him off a little longer. But he will eventually have to make his own mind up about the situation, you can not do it for him. and well, if he makes his mind up that now is the time...wouldn't you rather you knew and you knew he was being careful than him just doing it anyway behind you back.|`|8hyxabYOaa	i was 14 only 4 years ago, and yea, they might have sex when you leave. but dont rush to assume the girl will let him. SOME girls do have morals. and if you believe you have a decent son, hopefully he picked a decent girl.|`|rB3cyt0Paa	ok dont leave i know im not a parent but dont leave things can only get worse from here. and a week that's to little time to even cuddling. huging yea. maybe even a peck on a cheeck but seriously|`|JxCXqKaVaa	I have found the best thing to do is.........Leave them as they are but before you go call your Son down and say that you are poping out and that you trust him to behave.
9bcd0af449bde02dc1f98498d7b11d88aa	Nice slacks and a sweater. No one will be looking at you anyway.|`|p2Njf5gBaa	I wouldn't wear flowers, its not spring yet and won't match.  Stick with solid colors and you can't go wrong.  <br>  <br>  I would wear a nice pair of dress slacks.....<br>  and a fashionable top.  <br>  <br>  Then a pair of semi high heals with maybe an open toe, it not too cold.  An a open toe makes the outfit not too formal but a little more fun.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://bananarepublic.gap.com/browse/product.do?cid=24905&pid=632328&mlink=24905,1016662,1&clink=1016662" rel="nofollow">http://bananarepublic.gap.com/browse/pro...</a><br>  Slacks such as these.<br>  <br>  A top such as these.   (The pink may be too bold, you may want to go with a more neutral color, but if you are young you can pull it off.)<br>  <a href="http://bananarepublic.gap.com/browse/product.do?cid=5043&pid=629268" rel="nofollow">http://bananarepublic.gap.com/browse/pro...</a><br>  <br>  Okay screw the open toe, your feet will get cold..... check out these shoes..... they are adorable..... I think I am gonna order a pair infact, I haven't bougthen a nice pair of shoes in over a year. <br>  <a href="http://bananarepublic.gap.com/browse/product.do?cid=39339&pid=644533&scid=644533012" rel="nofollow">http://bananarepublic.gap.com/browse/pro...</a><br>  <br>  <br>  And don't forget an accessory or two.   A nice Bracelet is always in.  Other wise  interesting necklace or some nice large earrings.  Warning,  don't wear a bracelet necklace and large earring, thats over accesorizing and it looks so tacky and over done.  Less really is more!|`|e7ElUQ9Raa	some black dress pants and a maybe a cute cream colored top that ties in the back. That would be cute! It still is winter after all.|`|deZArjX7aa	Definitely slacks with a nice top - bright colors or pastels are good even if it's winter. <br>  <br>  I like the open toe shoe idea too - as long as it's not too cold.|`|V6dz395kaa	A pink flowy dress with a while shawl.|`|5CD9Pe7Qaa	nice pants with nice top|`|8zdPI8Qsaa	Last year at this time I had a baby shower for my SIL to go to, and because of the weather I wore khakis and a pink top with pink cardigan. You can make pants look cute w/out going with a dress/skirt if it'll be too cold :-)
