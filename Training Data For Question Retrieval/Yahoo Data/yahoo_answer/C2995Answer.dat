IM4vCfRpaa	E infatti Roma non toglie niente a nessuno. <br>  <br>  Io sono di Roma. Sinceramente non la prendo così sul personale quando vedo queste domande (non era la prima e non sarà l'ultima).<br>  Anzi, ti dirò, il fatto che qualcuno pensi che l'acqua che esce costantemente dalle fontanelle sia uno spreco è un bene. Non perchè sia uno spreco (so benissimo che le fontane grosse hanno il ricircolo e che le fontanelle sempre aperte hanno una funzione rispetto alla pressione negli acquedotti) ma perchè vuol dire che le coscienze si stanno svegliando. Qualcuno pensa agli sprechi, volendo eliminarli. <br>  A questo punto basta spiegare, cordialmente, che quelle fontanelle hanno una loro funzione e soprattutto che non è chiudendo le fontanelle a Roma che si risolve il problema siccità al sud, ma riparando gli acquedotti che perdono anche il 90% dell'acqua che dovrebbero trasportare.<br>  <br>  _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _<br>  <br>  Lasciali parlare... tanto non c'è peggior sordo di chi non vuol sentire.

Lascia che si crogiolino nella loro, infondata, idea che chiudendo tutte le fontanelle di Roma si risolve il problema della siccità. Tanto le fontanelle a Roma non le chiuderanno davvero per questa ragione.

Al contrario di quanto si dice a proposito dell'acqua che generalmente in Sicilia manca (se ne parla sempre a sproposito e senza conoscere i fatti veri) qui l'acqua c'è ed è sufficiente sia per il fabbisogno locale che per quello di diversi altre comunità più a valle. Ce n'è così tanta che la Regione ha deciso di dare una concessione trentennale a una nota azienda francese per l'imbottigliameno e la vendita.<br>  Veniamo al problema del supposto spreco: anche qui ci sono le fontane di acqua potabile perennemente aperte alle quali chiunque può accedere. Anch'io mi ero fatto la domanda se non si stesse sprecando liquido prezioso e se non fosse meglio mettere almeno dei rubinetti da aprire quando necessario. In effetti le cose non sono così semplici: <br>  se non si fa scorrere continamente l'acqua ne risentono le tubature nelle quali possono accumularsi residui di terriccio e di ruggine inoltre, almeno nella situazione di cui parlo, potrebbero verificarsi "colpi d'ariete" nelle condutture in grado di romperle provocando perdite di acqua e necessità di interventi di riparazione. Oltre a questi motivi c'è anche il fatto che il torrente a valle del paese si alimenta in buona parte con queste acque e da questo viene prelevata l'acqua per l'irrigazione di diverse colture. <br>  Quindi anche quando sembra che l'acqua si sprechi a ben guardare non è esattamente così.

Kj02Sqseaa	Assuming you have a new shower head, you will use no more than 2.5 gallons of water per minute as regulated by the government, but if you are using an old (I would say 3 years or later is "old), you are most likely putting out around 4 gallons of water per minute.    By doing the simple math we can see that if you have a newer shower head you will most likely be using:  45minutes x 2.5 gallons/minute = 112.5gallons in that one 45 minute shower    Likewise if you have an older shower head that number will be more around:  45minutes x 4gallons/minute = 180gallons    Either way that is a TON of water you will be using, and in fact you will be using more than 3/4 of your daily average water intake (with the old shower head) or 1/2 of your daily average water use (with the new shower head).  An average American uses between 50-200 gallons a day, and the real number is more around 90ish gallons a day.  So even with 1 shower using the lower flow shower head you are still using more than the average american uses in a 24 hour period day (and to think you'll be doing that in only 45 minutes!)    I recommend you Never take 45 minute showers and to buy a low flow shower head since it sounds like you like to take longer than normal showers.  These shower heads are nice since you can turn the water off in between washing/cleaning/rinsing, they have good pressure, are pretty cheap, look nice and new =), and use on average .4 gallons less per minute.  Another thing, if you want a long "shower", just take a bath.  That will still use a lot of water but will allow you to take a long soaking without wasting an exorbitant amount of water.|`|npBCankMaa	who says it's wasted?  di all the water go into outer space?

WHAT DO YOU EVEN DO IN THE SHOWER FOR 45 MINUTES?|`|PVVsK9pWaa	Hey Man, What are you doing in that shower so long?  You must live alone, or else, there'd be a line outside for the bathroom in our house.  No, its no crime to take long showers, but I hope you have a conservation nozzle, that puts your water usage to approximately two gpm, which would account for less than a hundred gallons of water.  If you have an old shower, you're probably using up to eight or ten gpm, which puts you seriously over the limit (about 400 gallons of water).  According to our water bill, we're charged $15 per 1000 gallons, so you can see just about $3.00 to $6.00 for your little wasteful adventure.  That's not the worst case. The bad thing is that heat costs about double what you spend for the water. Presuming you didn't take the cold shower you should have, you can figure about another six to twelve bucks, depending on what kind of hot water heat you use. It's winter here, and people like to have the water steamy-hot.  You've got to ask yourself: "Was it worth it?"  I'd have to ask you: "Don't you have anything better to do with your money?"  I know I do.  I like to conserve water, but I say "screw the power company", I'm taking conservative showers.  As an additional item, consider using half as much shampoo when you wash your hair, and don't ever wash it a second time, just to feel those lathery suds. That was a ploy brought on us by the shampoo companies to get us to use more of their product. Its actually harder on your hair, stripping it of all its natural oil.  I hope this helps answer your original question, which I feel was valid.  Good luck, and don't forget your rubber-duckie,  Will In IL|`|Nkwv2hygaa	Why the hell would anyone take a 45-minute shower?|`|EmgiGg17aa	Really,  I read all the answers and I could not think of anything you would be doing in a 45 minute shower.  If it won't get up,it won't.   Obviously you don't have a life.     Heck I could have the shower, get dried off changed and go to the store and back and probably start cutting the lawn in that time period.(& having a beer as well).   If you have one of those showers which is off the tub...close the drain to see how much water will be in the tub after 45 minutes.   Then you know it was cheaper to have a bath....if you have to pay for heating the water too.
cd3db14d1e54f8f56d160141b3b7357baa	That's a good point.  We're always told that warming is bad and that we're getting too hot, but if you look at the history of the planet there have been much warmer periods in the past.    For example, Greenland used to be used to cultivate crops, but now it's covered in ice and snow.  And according to ancient Roman history, they used to grow grapes in the area we know as northern England.  You can't do that these days.    The bottom line is that the planet is much more prosperous during the warming periods.    Maybe once this cooling period is over we'll go back into another warming period soon.  I certainly hope so.|`|t1zlbOURaa	More nice beach days, and better growing conditions for crops.    Oh... and lot's of idiot liberals wringing their hands about warming. That's just as well though.

Plus, you're using coal to recharge the vehicle.|`|WewCtMpzaa	If the logistics of charging and distance can be improved, I would consider one. The only problem for home charging is that you would have to bring in a commercial grade power source, 480 Volt system to speed charging, and then have really expensive batteries that in themselves would be $20k besides the price of the car. So that investment today would cost you around $30-50k to have an electric car.    There are some neat conversion projects with Chevy S-10's and Porsche 944's. There are all kinds of solutions they have, which for one fellow, he made a gas burning generator trailer that he could drag behind his Porsche so he could go on long trips in his electric car.    Most of the realistic electric cars look like Geo Metros. They will have to get a lot more substantial and cooler looking. Many look like golf carts on steroids.    If they can get a fast charging system at 220 Volts and can get a cool looking car that can go around 200 miles per charge, and under $20K will it be in my driveway.    The current new models for 2010 are all promising 5 minute charging at 110V. I have a feeling they are over promising and will be under delivering. Everyone keeps talking about this technology that will be figured out by then, which is just next year.

20f3291b9320a302e9070bf55325531daa	I've asked this same question many, many times.  The problem is that you're asking for a scientific explanation from people who either don't understand the science, don't care about the science, or view it through denial-tinted glasses.  But let's examine the explanations so far, because a few different ones have been provided.    1) Sunspots.    This is obviously wrong for two major reasons.    a) Sunspots do not directly impact global temperature or climate.  They are a fairly good proxy for solar irradiance which does, but sunspots do not themselves explain why the planet has warmed.    b) The number of sunspots today is the same as it was 60 years ago.  http://solar-center.stanford.edu/sun-on-...    Grade for peter's explanation: F    2) TSI and PDO.    Simlarly to sunspot number, TSI has not increased by any non-negligible amount in well over 30 years.  In fact, this is the graph Tomcat uses to explain how TSI is responsible for the recent warming:  http://www.nccr-climate.unibe.ch/project...    Average TSI has been right around 1366 W/m^2 for 60 years.    As for PDO, since 1945 we have had one cool and one warm cycle of roughly equal and opposite strength.  http://jisao.washington.edu/pdo/img/pdo_...    So basically this argument is that 0+0=2.    Grade for Tomcat's explanation: D-    3) Galactic cosmic rays.    No evidence is provided to support this argument.  Which is not surprising, because virtually none exists.  It's an ultra-hypothetical theory in which the solar magnetic field (if it had increased) could have blocked more galactic cosmic rays, which could possibly have resulted in less cloud formation, if cosmic rays do successfully seed clouds.    However, there is no long-term trend in solar magnetic field, galactic cosmic ray flux on Earth, cloudcover on Earth, and studies have shown that GCRs aren't particularly good at seeding clouds anyway.  Every aspect of this theory has been completely undermined, as discussed in the 'Galactic Cosmic Rays' section here:  http://greenhome.huddler.com/wiki/global...    On top of just saying 'cosmic rays', bravo claims     "1935 or there abouts was the warmest year of the last decade".    1935 was in the last decade?  Maybe that's the problem with deniers.  They're stuck 70 years in the past!    "The fact is that it hasn't warmed in 10 years"  It's funny that deniers can't settle on the date when global warming stopped.  Some say 10 years ago, others 8, others 6, others 3.  That's the problem with not having any supporting data.  But here are the 8 year trendlines on GISTEMP data disproving it.  http://www.realclimate.org/index.php/arc...    Grade for bravozulu's explanation: F    4) The planet hasn't actually warmed.  Temperature stations are just fooled by the urban heat island effect.    The problems with this argument are many.    a) The only supporting evidence is some photographs which show some temperature stations in less than idea locations.    b) NASA GISS and other scientific groups which analyze global temperature data are well aware of the UHI effect and filter it out.    c) Rural temperature stations (where UHI is not a concern) show the same warming trend as urban stations.    d) Satellites show the same warming trend as surface stations.  http://tamino.files.wordpress.com/2008/0...    eric also claims the planet has not warmed for 7 years even though the supposed "cooling trend" his graph shows is not statistically significant.  The reason it's not statistically significant is that when you look at just 7 years of data, you're focusing on the short-term noise instead of the long-term signal.    Grade for eric c's explanation: F    5) James Hansen is a James Bond villain.    A lovely new conspiracy theory where Hansen "deleted a century of temperature data and replaced it with his own made-up crap. He got caught".    Wow.  That's amazing that James Hansen apparently falsified a century's worth of global temperature data, got caught, nobody but davem heard about it, and yet Hansen is still the head of NASA GISS, and despite this apparent fraudulence, the American Meteorological Society just gave him its top honor.  http://climateprogress.org/2009/01/14/am...    Despite all this, davem doesn't even dispute that the planet has warmed, nor does he provide an alternative explanation.  And somehow the fact that GISTEMP has the same temperature trend as the other global temperature datasets doesn't play into his conspiracy theory.    Grade for dave m's explanation: A for creativity.  F- for insanity.|`|n6xqkPhXaa	Trusting NASA GISS data, or something that ends with .uk is very risky.  Hansen, director of GISS and also Al Gores science advisor is guilty of bad professional conduct.  He deleted a century of temperature data and replaced it with his own made-up crap.  He got caught, thankfully.      Links are easy, the internet's full of foolish sites backing the global warming scam.  It doesn't change the truth that it just isn't our fault. Earth's temperature has increased by .6 deg C over the last hundred years or so.  Sites that say otherwise are incorrect.|`|4CMENEKnaa	Even if 35% of the warming over the last 30 years is due to the sun, where did the other 65% of the warming come from?  Skeptics seem a little reluctant to answer that question.      Similarly, skeptics don't explain how something cyclical like the PDO can lead to a warming trend.  Something heats up, it cools down.  Those two phases should offset unless something else is adding energy to the system.  So, while the PDO can possible explain why the temperature rise levels off for a decade every 30-40 years, it cannot explain the overall increasing trend.  You need a temperature "ratchet" mechanism, and need to explain why all of a sudden it started operating just when the radiative forcing from CO2 is theorized to be having an effect.      If skeptics would address those two issues, instead of just bringing up the same tired statements as proof that CO2 is having no effect on climate, they might make some progress in proving their case.  As it is, leaving those questions open undermines their position.    edit:  I dunno TC, aside from the fact your response is a mass of speculation devoid of any physical reasoning, I think you are reading way to much into one cold year.  If the climate is as sensitive as you think it is to small changes in TSI, why you think a change in the radiative forcing from CO2 that is five times larger is unimportant is beyond me.  Do you know something more about the physics of radiative transfer so that you are sure the theory is wrong?  Finally, I leave you with this, updated for 2008:    http://data.giss.nasa.gov/gistemp/2008/F...    You can look at that plot and see several instances where that have been single years over the 1980-2008 time period where temperature decreased from one year to the next as much as it did in 2008.  But it came right back up.  How can you be so sure that isn't happening now?  Furthermore, even with the relatively cooler year compared to 2007, the arctic amplification was huge last year.  Kind of hard to ignore that, in my opinion, since that wasn't seen when the PDO went to a "cold" phase in the 70's.|`|34BQRUMqaa	Davem: You don't like data from NASA because you read on someone's personal blog that the data was falsified or some other such nonsense? How about the HADCRUT3 from the Hadley centre in the UK? Or the NCDC from NOAA? Do you accept either of them?     If you do like one of the other temperature datasets, then I have something really funny to tell you.  They all 3 agree very nicely, with a few minor differences caused by the percentage of the globe they monitor.    If you don't accept either of these 3 datasets, then I guess you wouldn't like any data that didn't support your ideology, huh?|`|t1zlbOURaa	Sunspots.    Look up Maunder Minimum, Medieval warm period, Little ice age.    then look at the sun.    Still spotless.

(I'm also dubious that any instrument that we have could detect the minimal amount of change required to move the temperatures here by .5 degrees C in 50 years.)     Sunspots and earthly temperatures correlates better than CO2 and earthly temperatures.

The fact is that it hasn't warmed in 10 years.  1935 or there abouts was the warmest year of the last decade.  It was warmer 1000 years ago and much warmer 8 to 5 thousand years ago.  The warming corresponded to increased solar magnetism so it is likely the effect on cloud formation from cosmic rays has driven the majority of the warming.  What is left isn't harmful and doesn't require handing over freedom and properity to a bunch of radical socialists.  They will certainly do great damage.  Most likely the small amount of warming from humans would be entirely beneficial.|`|pZi3HXdnaa	A combination of an increase in TSI or solar forcing and the PDO warm cycle can account for much of the global warming from 1977 to 1998. 25 - 35% of the global warming from 1980 - 2000.    N. Scafetta1 and B. J. West1,2  GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH LETTERS, VOL. 33, L05708, doi:10.1029/2005GL025539, 2006    "We estimate that the sun contributed as much as 4550% of the 19002000 global warming, and 2535% of the 19802000"      The PDO warm and cool cycles correlate very well with global temperature datasets.    http://jisao.washington.edu/pdo/  http://data.giss.nasa.gov/gistemp/graphs...    EDIT GCN:    Why did the earth warm a similar amount from 1910 to 1945 relative to the last 30 years, it certainly wasn't forcing from CO2, and why did it cool from 1940 to 1977, while TSI was increasing through a significant portion of that time period. TSI has continually increased over the last 100 years until the turn of the century, there is no reason why the temperature should not have increased. That is why the PDO cool cycle during the 1940's until 1977 did not have a dramatic cooling effect. As soon as the warm phase occured in 1977 global temperatures rapidly jumped 0.3 C over a couple of years. Now we are in a period of the PDO cool phase and decreasing solar activity. And low and behold global temperatures are falling, possibly rapidly. And the AMO and other Atlantic circualtion patterns are just being understood which will lead to a better understanding of multi decadal climate shifts.    EDIT FLAVIAN:    Look at the temperature in Southern Hemisphere, the maximum value is 1998, associated with the well known El-Nino event. Events that occur in the Pacific affect the climate for the entire world, that is a well documented and generally accepted fact, in the field of climatology. The physics associated with the theory of radiative transfer demand that the surface of the Pacific Ocean play a major part of our global climate. As well as the Hadley cells, jet streams, atmospheric water vapor content and a whole host of other climate related variables that are not accounted from in climate models.    http://www.cru.uea.ac.uk/cru/data/temper...  .  EDIT GCN:    Time will tell, in about ten years the ""TREND"" in the following link should have continued, and the GISSTEMP will have been re-written about ten times. It's very frustating to see the climate shifting into the PDO cool phase, which will cause states like California, to see severe drought's, increased wildfires and a shortened a growing season. And listen to people like the Master of Science blame it all on Global Warming, and to see tremendous sums of money allocated to solve a problem that is caused by a natural cycle. And please explain what caused the warming from 1910 to 1940, and small changes in TSI govern the amount of water vapor Earths atmosphere holds at any given moment. And that difference in water vapor  can dwarf the forcing from an extra 100 PPM of CO2. And the PDO did not switch to a cool phase in the seventies, it switched to warm.    http://www.cru.uea.ac.uk/cru/data/temper...    EDIT Flavian:    Don't quit your day job!|`|f64a2a4ada0fcb1ea5303362c0bca8efaa	Temperatures have been flat or falling for the past seven years, this despite greenhouse gases increasing faster than before.    http://icecap.us/images/uploads/ALL_SINC...    Man is responsible for some of the 20th century warming, but these men sit behind offices and compile temperature trends and  do not take into account the Urban heat Island effect.  As Steve Mckintyre has shown temperature growth in rural cities has been less than Urban cities:    http://www.climateaudit.org/?p=1859    We also know that it can not be greenhouse gases that is causing the warming because supporters of the greenhouse theory say that if it is greenhouse gases that is causing the  temperature increases, then temperatures in the troposphere should warm at a faster rate than ground temperatures.  But they are warming at a lesser rate.
IacGsbq6aa	Solar Panels have a large range of prices. You can get a 10W panel for approx. $100 to 200W solar panels at $2000 and beyond.     You would want to figure out how much electric heat you use. Then from there, figure out how many solar panels it would take to compensate that.     If you need help figuring this out, I would suggest reading a Solar Panel How to Guide and/or looking at a Solar Panel Forum.     Best of luck to you!|`|fp9bOiVFaa	I doubt it'd supply your heat. Anything involving electric heating uses tons of energy. Also, keep in mind that you don't just need a panel but also a DC to AC converter.|`|JaezhuSOaa	The first thing to understand is that there is nothing complex about a solar  panel. It is nothing more than a collection of solar or PV cells on a board that  is fitted to the most appropriate part of your home, generally on the roof.   There are guides out there that teach you how to build a solar panel and a  windmill for just $150, and its very easy to make. Best of all, you can save  70% or more on your energy bill, adding up to thousands of dollars each year in  savings. I reviewed both free guides and paid guides and have come up with our  top to Build your own solar panels.

UyyXuU6Daa	i'm not quite sure what your asking...but i'll try my best.    if you want to make your group official or something outside of school, then you can ask your city council to make it a community thing for everyone and not just students. you'd have to register the city hall then.    also...    you can put you group online and make it a volunteer opportunity for people in your area  http://www.volunteermatch.org/    also...check this out, maybe it will help you.  http://online.nwf.org/site/DocServer/How...|`|6J006fFoaa	Try setting up a page using an online tool such as ning so that people connected with the project can work on wherever they are, and have a look at Paul Hawken's project blessed unrest which has listings on lots of groups where other people are doing similar work.    One of the most effective things that you can do to continue interest and support is to focus your effort on things that make a difference to the community that you live and study in.    Keep up the good work!

159af8323864a89fbd6da78461d571f4aa	It is probably distorted by urban effects but clearly shows consistent warming coming out of the little ice age.  There are no anomalies.  The choice of zero seems completely arbitrary and the temperature change is remarkably little.|`|npBCankMaa	it shows that by changing the y axis scale or base, you can make things look anyway you want.  If you used say absolute values, it would be a straight line.<br>  <br>  I ran the absolute values through a Statistical Process Control program and it declares that the data is statistically in control with no trends.  The CPK says it is doing all it can to stay in control.<br>  <br>  If you do not like the values then, the only thing you can do is to change the management or expectations, ie, the planet can't change, but you have to.   A design of experiment was also run and CO2 was not a correlation other than a lag auto correlation, again meaning CO2 was an outcome, not a input.|`|68a986852f756433d4bb1ec748016462aa	I would interpret it as an alarmists worst nightmare but the first two answers provide evidence that alarmists are not easily deterred by facts.

Dana that little dickens beat me to it.  He has the correct answer.|`|gOBtB16caa	It used 1961-1990 as the base period to develop the averages.  So of course when the temperatures rebounded it would look like a dramatic shift.  The issue is that we can't develop a true base period in order to develop averages because we just came out of an era where global temperatures were about 1 C cooler for a few hundred years (LIA).  The Medieval Warm Period was a time where is was still warmer than today and that lasted for a few hundred years.  The last 1,200-1,500 years of the Earth have been hectic as far as global temperatures, making it difficult to assess what the global temperature should be.<br>  <br>  I will not accept 1961-1990 (Hadley) or 1951-1980 (NASA) as time periods to develop a "global average".  30 years of recent data is not enough to truly develop a global average.<br>  <br>  The alarmists live off of this kind of statistical manipulation.|`|AA11264399	A long-term warming trend over about the last 100 years which is still accelerating today.  Crucially, there is no known natural factor which would account for this warming - things like solar irradiance and volcanism, taken together, should mean that the planet is cooling slightly, whereas in fact it's warming significantly.  The reasonable conclusion is that it's human activity causing the warming.|`|20f3291b9320a302e9070bf55325531daa	It's an average global (surface air) temperature graph from the Hadley Centre which shows the long-term warming trend (a.k.a. global warming) that we're currently experiencing.|`|fwnqB0dTaa	I take it as clearly showing the effects of El Nino & La Nina.<br>  <br>  I also see it as showing that claims of overall cooling over the last 20 years are false, and that claims that it's cooler now than at the start of the Industrial Revolution are also false.<br>  <br>  EDIT: Nice to see a denier posting a link to a graph that stops around 1950, and claiming it's better than one with current data.<br>  <br>  EDIT 2: Also nice to see the denier in chief YET AGAIN using his flawed logic. It's a 35.6% in total CO2 in the atmosphere not 0.01%, the 0.01% is the increase based on total atmosphere, not CO2 in the atmosphere.<br>  <br>  I take it he would be happy to take a poison that killed at 380ppm, while being safe at 280ppm, as it's only a 0.01% increase, so is insignificant.<br>  <br>  Also nice to see him accepting the effect El Nino/La Nina have, despite multiple denials in the past that they even exist, BUT, they affect WEATHER not CLIMATE
