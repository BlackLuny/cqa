9P6dCTB6aa	I don't have sky but they may be having minor technical problems and maybe the channal +1 isnt getting enough viewers and has shut down due to lack of fund. Its possible|`|HDZyPMMJaa	hmm mine is the same looks like they have got rid of it for some reason x|`|STUsNoNTaa	Trouble +1 has stopped broadcasting and the slot has now been taken by living2+1 which didnt broadcast before|`|5f0ad33d9668eff665c2e087d8f3dc2caa	OMG how awful for you, I'll start praying right away.
R15gMUXBaa	sony S series is the best|`|AA11629848	I'll go for the Canon, something small like the FS100 that records to flash SD cards.|`|b6e0dc8ffe2b0db9a1e3d82efa351d40aa	I'd look for a MiniDV camcorder from Sony, Canon, JVC or Panasonic.  They have the best video quality, the lowest cost (!) and once you've recorded something to tape it's safe.  If you're traveling round the world you want something that's rugged!|`|BGjzFrjtaa	GET A CANON. THEY WORK GREAT ;D|`|42tTsVuxaa	Go for a Mini-dv camera some have a slot for a sd card for pictures, but record video onto tape.     Mini-dv gives the best quality for the money, there are no editing problems as all editing packages will capture from a mini-dv. if you use Windows movie maker its very fussy about what you can edit.     I am assuming you are going to edit the video a trip like that you are going to have a lot of video. Sd card are ok but when you fill it up what do you do, you have to use another one not that cheap, unless you try to cram loads of video onto it then your quality will be not much better than a poor quality VHS tape.     Mini Dv tapes are cheap, and when you have edited all your footage you can put it onto another tape and keep it, in perfect quality.     another bonus is that they are not that expensive.    Good luck     RR|`|Qxq3tqi1aa	My expensive video cameras sit in a closet. I now carry a Flip Video. Small, inexpensive, easy to carry in a pocket and so uncomplicated to use, I end up taking a lot of pictures at any moment.
AA11165496	Well its other types, its Linux, and Ubunta, also Yellow Dog, etc. You have to have the resource info burned on a disc and have a keyboard & mouse to do installation. And you can access this in the OS system within the settings    PSN:D-Rob92|`|QoWi0hzWaa	the that thing with WWW broswer     and go on youtube and type something like    LYNEX on PS3
t9NOnCwBaa	Yep, the connectors are all the same on all HDMI cables....except for those hdmi-to-dvi cables...but other then that, yes all HDMI cables can be used on a ps3. I always get that static sound, I guess its just it has to transition from the XMB to the actual game.|`|9AR6B4ELaa	yes, all the HDMI cables are compatible with the ps3 as long as the port are the same size and shape. UNLESS its for DVI output or input HDMI cable|`|v4E8nylXaa	yes all HDMI cables will work. i don't know what is wrong with ur ps3 saying that it is incompatible. maybe as software glitch?
AQ4b4Iilaa	You should be comparing the Sony A200 too, 240 and beats the pants off the D40's feature list.|`|1abaa60b0511b1e2c248dd1b30e73037aa	here is a side by side review, and it's not the only one. and look on dpreview.com...http://www.pbase.com/dlcmh/nikon_d40_lin...|`|3zDhj57Uaa	Always go with canon. They have way superior lenses to the nikon. The actual camera bodies themselves are very similar within the model parameters.  for example you can't compare a nikon d3 with a canon 20d. It is the lenses that tell them apart. Canon lenses are the way to go.|`|EJIsHdZhaa	400D is better.   a big jump up in resolution and a far superior 9 point AF system.    Both these models are quite old now, so if you aren't buying used you should be pushing for a good discount.|`|HX6JjCTyaa	Both are great Nikon D40 is cheaper but Canon 400D come with better features.Personally I would go with Canon 400D for more reviews  http://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/B000I...  http://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/B000K...
nP1SZuUlaa	It's Madworld, a comic book-stylized, black and white game with all the blood and gore one could want.    Expect it to be out in late March.    a couple other more mature games coming to Wii this year: Dead Rising, House of the Dead: Overkill, and The Conduit.|`|hgv0bTDgaa	madworld|`|pwg8L6F0aa	definitely mad world|`|anGiS8nDaa	I think you're talking about madworld or house of the dead overkill|`|C7rV71Cjaa	That my friend is the upcoming Madworld due to come out in March. It should be really good seeing as it's a mature Wii exclusive from Sega. If you want more mature titles coming out this year then look for The House of the Dead Overkill, Dead Rising Chop Til You Drop, The Conduit(might get a T rating), and Dead Space was recently announced to be coming to the Wii.
AFzb8sXCaa	All you need is a TV tuner for your computer. These come as either cards  or USB devices. Since your VCR only outputs analog signals, you only need an analog tuner which is really cheap since a lot of people are replacing them with analog/digital tuners.     Or you could buy a new analog/digital tuner if you want to use your computer as a TV.|`|eefb86102abf768c99d76adbb2a76a30aa	my dear u can do this simply install a tv card in your Computerr  using a/ v cable u can record and view
3CJAUyqPaa	For a single layer blank DVD, your SuperDrive will use any of them, but DVD-R is probably easiest.    It would be a lot more helpful if you had included the version of iMovie yuo are using... but here goes:    With the iMovie project open in iMovie, locate the iDVD button. Click it. In this area, you can add "bookmarks" to the iMovie project - basically, when you export the iMovie project as a QuickTime file, these bookmarks will be available for you to jump directly to certain scenes you have specified. In iDVD, these bookmarks will be menu selection items that allow you to select a specific scene for the DVD player to jump to when you are at the main menu of the DVD.    Save the iMovie project so you have all changes saved.    Once the bookmarks are done (you can actually skip adding bookmarks if you want) and iMovie is saved, click "Burn DVD". iDVD will launch and the ties to this particular iMovie project - including the bookmarks, if any - will be the active iDVD window.    In iDVD, there are various templates available - and you can modify their appearance (with video or stills) for the menuing background and you can add a soundtrack from external audio if you want. Some of the templates have motion, some don't... yuo can adjust the menu selections - the scene selections - that were the bookmarks you selected in iMovie. When you are ready, click on "Burn DVD". You will be prompted to insert a blank DVD to render the video.    It will take a while - there is a progress bar that shows status and what part of the process is currently being executed. Each frame will be rendered individually. At 30 frames per second of normal NTSC video during normal playback, there are a LOT of drames to render. How fast the render is will deopend on how fast your Mac's CPU is.    A single layer blank DVD can hold up to 120 minutes of standard definition video. I usually target the video length to about 110 minutes so the DVD menu background and audio track has some room. A double layer blank DVD can hold up to 240 minutes of standard definition video. I usually target the video length to about 220 minutes so the DVD menu background and audio track has some room.|`|3e354ee85999a7bc21252e59e538dc35aa	CD's are totally different media than DVD's.

7CgqvBRsaa	You will be fine.  Polk's are virtually all voice-matched.  I'm not a big Polk fan, but they are pretty consistent throughout their lines.    Happy listening!|`|DcUoZntOaa	it should match impedance and sensitivity ratings.  and polk is a good mid level system.  peace!|`|ZNew0DANaa	It won't damage any equipment, but the only sure way to tell if they will match well is when you get them home and positioned properly|`|CCqqTw6paa	make sure the impedance levels are ok  i've blown a set of speakers before i even knew what that was.. lol    might need to hook it up via an amplifier
avDScP2laa	no i dont think so  i hav read on a site that said only the ttds will work on it|`|eeb898bd256e45f62aa2f9354d7b958baa	I haven't heard specifically. ( I have no intention of getting one either btw-)  But it most likely will- why? More space to build better games (and an excuse to make a DSi series of games  that isn't compatible with the DS)
5586ad15a09ab2f36457c1e8042071f2aa	You have the same exact problem as ALL of the commercial broadcasters in switching over from analog to digital. You need a converter... exactly like they did. The problem is not the carrier, but the data ON the carrier that is changing. They just took advantage to change not only the content of the signals, but the frequencies as well to better use the spectrum. Why do you want to change anyway? You gain nothing. Just because DTV has a better resolution does NOT change the resolution of what you already have NOW. This is like taking a picture of a newspaper photograph. No matter how many pixels your super digital camera, the newspaper photo does not get any better, but now you can see all the defects in the original newspaper photo in great detail.|`|AA10594501	Interesting idea.You're probably thinking of something like the FM transmitters that let you play your iPod through your car radio wirelessly. But I've never seen a home UHF transmitter. Most likely the FCC would take a very dim view of this, since it could interfere with your neighbor's TV reception.    The bigger problem is that the device would have to encode the TV screen's content in an Mpeg-2 stream for the TV to be able to decode it. Sounds very expensive.    There is a device called the SlingCatcher made by SlingMedia that does something like you're talking about, but using WiFi or wired ethernet. But it's also about $300.  Update: Its now $180 at newegg.com, but the reviews for the device aren't glowing.
7CgqvBRsaa	Sure you can.  Actually, Circuit City is going out of business, so you might find your best deals there.  eBay is another good place to shop.    Happy listening!
DPPDvoxZaa	It might work, but you should keep in mind that PCs always give you more power for lower price than laptops. My recommendation to you is that you get a custom built gaming pc that might run you around  300$ and then get a 100$ cheap laptop for notes, etc.|`|4FEDMxbTaa	if you can go till 1000 or 1100 then go for a xps m1530 but i wouldnt say that the laptop is bad ...but i can easily run those games in my xps..
Lyl3mHIKaa	Firstly you should understand there aren't any new.  Secondly, if you want to purchase older, obsolete items, then eBay is the way to go.|`|a9398092706b68241341a0195af9943eaa	Ever think of buying a real camera by either Fuji, Canon, Sony, Nikon etc?|`|HBNx77BBaa	If you mean instant picture polaroid then I'm afraid they're not produced any more. There are still some about but you have to catch them where you can. Fujifilm do produce some instant picture cameras and film too.|`|pxdEpIZAaa	Walgreens used to have them. they might still. if not, try amazon.com... if you find one, good luck finding the film, it's nearly impossible to. all the places i used to go to, discontinued it. it sucks too. those Instamatic cameras are amazing. especially the old ones.
bL7CeHYbaa	play it and find out
HBNx77BBaa	This is a good question for finding out which cameras people own. I don't know what that budget is in pounds or dollars, but hopefully this review is in the right sort of area. It is up to date and covers cameras that are considered good, while still being affordable...    http://www.dpreview.com/reviews/Q408budg...    My choice would be the Canon Powershot A590IS but of course I am biased too!|`|pxdEpIZAaa	canon definitely. they are amazing compared to everything else I've used and I've been in photography for about 5 years + do my own developing/printing.|`|uxWc4Ivaaa	kodak|`|SI0PhJ5naa	Panasonic|`|tNhFC1fmaa	sony and conon cameras are great. I have a kodak and it's not the best but not bad either|`|BGjzFrjtaa	canon is the best your pictures will come out crystal clear i have one and i love how they come out and ive had the sony and nikon and they cant beat the canon for nothing, GOOD LUCK :)|`|jGG4UZXzaa	SAMSUNG baby!!!! Its the only way to go!!!|`|AA11291009	kodak probably is the best  but casio will be a great option

I am in Somerset..... though we don't suffer snow like the rest of the country - clear where I am.    :)|`|RNNdRHrMaa	Ours is fine, but the snow isn't that heavy.  I have noticed that in heavy drifts the picture goes completely.  Good luck though|`|2N4j1ficaa	its your lmb get it fixed mines fine but we did have this problem before|`|xDPQ700baa	Depends. Satellite signals are best in clear conditions. Rain and snow attenuate the signal, but that is not to say it will not work. There will be figures for this, sort of projections for certain conditions. Other factors like the accuracy of the dish and how good the cabling and joints are build into this. Then accumulation of snow on the dish or LNB.    Sends the kids out to build a snow man, better for them anyway.
HAxxlee2aa	You can download it as a mod. When you've d/l'd it, it is found near Woozie's Casino in a bush. By the way, you can't ride it.

WQbJhFORaa	It probably needs to be synced with your console.    Right first look at the bottom end your guitar, there is a small black button, press and hold this.     This symbol should be right beside it =  ))    Now, on your x-box console there is also this symbol = )), press and hold this button as well.    It should be below the drawer and beside the memory card ports.    Now the rings on you x-box and guitar should be flashing in sync.    Hope this helps.

8213dbb28238df28f026dac640239fb1aa	There is nothing wrong with component video cables, but an HDMI cable is at least as good as anything component video can offer.  First off, HDMI carries both video and audio.  With component video cables you still have to worry about moving the audio.  Many times the cables come in bundles of 5--3 for the video and 2 for the audio.  This means you have only 2-channel audio, which is no problem if you're just running it to a TV.  But if you have a surround sound system you want more than two channels of audio.  You'd have to get an optical or coax cable to move the surround soundtrack.  With HDMI you get HD video and also surround sound audio, which brings me to the second point--HDMI moves audio and video in one--not 5--cable.  So it keeps down the clutter.  It used to be component video cables were less expensive, but with places like monoprice.com selling HDMI cables for $10 there is no longer any reason for you to use anything but HDMI.    How do you hook it up?  You just plug it in the back of your xbox and into your TV HDMI-in port.  Then you select that HDMI port through your TV input options and you're ready to go.    Oh, and when you're using your ears it's "hear" not "here".|`|HekFanRvaa	here is the list of video cables from worst to best:    1. Composite Cables (red-whire-yellow)  2. S-Video  3. Component cable  4. HDMI cable    just plug it...|`|AA12041546	It's only as complicated as you wanna make it.  Plug it in and turn it on.

HekFanRvaa	You are not even suppose to do any manual settings. And make sure media server is disabled if you are not using it. It complicates the setup if it is enabled. I've never done any manual settings on mine. I just scan and select my network. Connecting to PSN sometimes really takes time. If you can sign in and you see the "My Account" icon, that means your connection to the internet is ok. Most of the time, it just takes longer to connect to the game server (between 10 to 20 minutes or 10 to 20 tries). Just keep trying even when you receive the message "No Network detected".. that happens to me each time I sign in for online games.
1feIzLQ3aa	Some of the answers they have given are incorrect and others are lies! I will answer them in order.  1) They are suggesting you have a main socket ( an NTE5a) this is incorrect as your house is star wired, star wired means as you described originally the line comes in and them splits off to more than one socket, no NTE5a to start with, this is usually the main reason for poor or no ADSL.  2) Yes they are using the BT/Openreach line to provide you with service and they can't do anything about this BUT to send a BT/Openreach engineer! As we own and maintain the network. However they can request an ADSL healthcheck which will mean we come to your house to get your wiring to standard and get your ADSL working, WE DO DEAL WITH SUCH CASES!! It's our job! We deal with ALL your line internal and external.  3) They may have run tests on their equipment but if it's not working at your house, they are in breach of contract. This will be a remote test, they are never conclusive, if anything they will request that the wiring is correct in the exchange, the exchange staff are unable to test if data is leaving the exchange, this requires an ADSL trained engineer who will test your line end to end.  4)  To give you a more stable connection they have dropped your speed, but if you are receiving nothing it's an issue.  5) Your new ISP has their own equipment in our exchange and there obviously is an issue with it, Talk-Talk had a lot of issues when they first started with their equipment, there are now less issues as they are understanding ADSL more.  Tell your ISP you want an ADSL health check, this costs them money not you!! This is why they don't like doing it. If they refuse leave them and go elsewhere.   We always respond to a request from anyone to check phone wiring and we have always dealt with such cases, but it is chargeable.   I hope this helps, if you still are having problems come back to me and I will try to help, just curious who is your ISP? Good luck.

AA12180617	You CAN buy ringtones from the itunes store NOW!!    Ring tones for many phones including the iPhone are M3R files which are not just MP3 files renamed, they are a SPECIAL format.    they are LOOPS rather than plain files and have extra encoding, simply renaming .mp3 to m3r does not work.    the ONLY option to convert existing mp3 to m3r is for mac users as it needs Garageband to do the work.    full details are given in the link below. including how to import them into itunes and sync to the phone.    http://support.apple.com/kb/HT1358     Alternatively you can BUY them form the itunes store and sync them from your itunes.    No matter what you do you MUST use itunes (the program as opposed to itunes store the online music shop).    ALSO You need to tell your ipod to sync apps, Music (or Movies etc) as by default most syncing is OFF other than Music which is ALL unless its too big for the ipod/iPhone when its none.    Plug ipod into itunes.  click on the ipods Icon its summary page appears.  click on the tab that says Ringtones  click on 'Sync All' or ' Sync only selected'  click on APPPLY BOX  click on SYNC box.    voila it now will sync Ringtones.

You have the ipod touch that is in it's second generation with some upgraded features and others such as the Samsung YP-P2 is also being upgraded after about a year on the market.  There are many ipod touch/iphone knock off mp3/4 players available.  If you want a touch mp3 for the cool factor, you're probably going to lean toward the ipod touch but they are expensive for the storage you get.  knockoff type devices are not going to get the oohs and aahs the touch will get you.  If you want the most storage for the money, you most likely will not be also getting "touch" anytime soon.

R4rlYxqBaa	You can get a home theatre in a box which range from prices but a good one can be easily under 300 dollars. I wouldn't prefer these due to the fact that if something goes wrong then the whole system turns to garbage. It is rarely ever worth fixing because the components aren't as interchangeable as building your own home theatre system and they aren't worth that much from the get go. It has next to no value as well but for beginning i think it is very affordable and easy way into the home theatre world.     What I would do is get a nice amp, then select your speakers by giving them a listen at your future shop or best buy.     If you are looking at spending under 300 dollars go to walmart or radio shack. There are also budget ones at future shop or best buy depending on where you live but you can always go and test them out and see which ones you like and ask the sales rep for their personal opinions too, even if they are biased. I think circuit city is going out of business in most locations and their might be some good deals.|`|FKJaQXQLaa	Check out your local Best Buy or Walmart.

475c01dc76b1f175b986a137414d9e50aa	You really need to look at the specs on each recorder - the more independent tracks they have, the higher the price.  Most of the cheaper ones start with two (even though they will claim four inputs - only two will be recorded at any one time).  So, like I said, you need to read the specs carefully before you buy one.    This "24 track" recorder has only eight recording inputs - 4 mic + 4 line:    http://www.zzounds.com/item--TAS2488NEO    Many home recording people just get a mixer with as many channels as they need and send the right and left outputs to a recorder.
fWMat3xwaa	sounds like a software issue, un plug the 625 from the electrical outlet for about 5 mins. plug it back in and let it re-start this should up date the software.

RyvKws7Laa	Look for a good Samsung one.  They will give you the best picture quality for the dollar out there.  And its not a budget picture quality, its an amazing picture quality.  They just don't over charge you to death like Sony.    Sharp Aquos is also a really good choice.  They make very strong panels that review very well.  As Samsung changed its business practices, Sony could no longer buy its LCD panels, and is now buying the Sharp ones (the ones used in the Aquos) line.    If you have access to a Costco that would be your best bet.  They get their own models made, but are usually great prices for the features you get.  You just have to dig through the specs as their model numbers aren't the typical ones on all the other sites/reviews.    I would look for a Samsung LN40A630 or LN40A550.  I think those might be within your price range.  Or for a Sharp, try the Sharp Aquous LC-42D65u.|`|pk4dteZnaa	You should check out the HDTV guide at:    elmlife.com/guide/HDTVBuyingGuide?595    It features interactive advice from a real home theater expert...you can even click on the questions for more information on a specific topic.

There are all kinds of games/apps you can buy. I love my iPod touch 2nd gen, and I have so many apps.    There are many free apps on the app store, as well as many cheap paid ones. But I don't think you can download them for a random website-only iTunes or the app store.

If that does not work, then take it to the apple store and exchange for a new one
42tTsVuxaa	You get what you pay for, as you say Nero is average, but good to start with. Vegas is very good, have used it and liked it. It has loads of useful features.     Editing compressed video isnt the best thing to do, but as that is what you have then go for it. Try not to fit too much video onto your camera, because you are compressing the footage even more, and reducing the quality.    I think you can get a trial version of it download and play for a while. see if you like it.   http://www.sonycreativesoftware.com/prod...

BUT, the SC-MX20 is a poor choice for recording sports - it uses a very lossy compression which doesn't handle movement at all well and it's a poor choice for editing.  If at all possible I'd change the camcorder for a MiniDV model.

2VdS49MTaa	dam im debating this question myself. so far i really like my virgin mobile service but then when the announcement of the ocean 2 came out i was psyched n wanted to get one.  so far what i been thinkin is vm has been offering some alrite phones lately such as the shuttle and just today announcing the release of the Kyocera X-tc but it usually take months for just one cell phone to be out and their best phones feels outdated by my standards. despite releasing more decent phones in the market I doubt they are going to make anything that is remotely close to any of the helio devices anywhere in the long run.  so what i suggest is if your okay with jus textin, making phone calls, n listening to mp3s then go with vm otherwise if u do all of those and also spend alot of time on the internet and do alot of social networking then go wit helio. hope this helped|`|WJRise7taa	Virgin Mobile already owns Helio, so I'm pretty sure you will be able to get their phones pretty soon. I hate that they merged cause I hate Virgin Mobile, but atleast my contract is up this year. FYI I know the Helio phones look cool with all the features, but all of them, I've used them all, overload themselves and shut off without notice. I hate that, like if your in the middle of a call it will just restart itself,  if your doing anything, it will restart itself, and they freeze alot. I have had an ocean, the screen went out within 2 months, my mysto's touch screen stopped working and the screen started flickering in 3 months and my fin had internal connection problems. So think about this first.

w4I9oj2Maa	As long as you don't PAUSE your games or bring up the scoreboard 24/7 or have a weapon that ALWAYS UP....you can use a plasma.  No matter what people tell you, Plasmas inherently BURN.|`|RyvKws7Laa	LCDs are still considered better for gaming.  But I don't think you'll be all that disappointed with a Plasma if you get one of the better ones (see below).  The Plasma burn in issue is not an issue once you condition the TV (see below).    =========    LCD - is the everyman HDTV. It is cost effective, hence its popularity. It is also lighter than Plasma. It tends to draw less power than Plasmas as well.  It has a matte finish so is useful for rooms that have too much ambient light which can not be controlled. LCD whites are a bit brighter than Plasma whites (but how often do you crank your brightness to 100%). LCDs are considered better for gaming (but I don't think you'd be disappointed with gaming on a Plasma). LCDs are sharper in SD (think evening news instead of film); this isn't a good vs bad, its just a personal preference thing.    It has problems with fast motion though. That is why you see ones advertised with 120Hz refresh rates. This does not come close to Plasma though. So they aren't as good for fast motion (sports and movies).    Plasma - they have better blacks, contrast, and motion blur. They are better TVs, but you must pay a premium for them. Images look smoother. They have grader ranges in blacks/whites so you get greys instead of clumps of black and white. The colors in Plasmas tend to have more "pop" to them; this isn't a good vs bad thing, its just personal preference. Plasmas are great for fast motion (sports and action movies).    Plasma's are glass though so are glossy. They can have reflection issues if you are in a room with lots of light that you can't control (you can't turn off the lights and you don't own any blinds).  Also for SD viewing they are a bit "softer" (think more like film less like the evening news).  This  isn't a good vs bad thing, its personal preference.  Most plasma owners get used to it and don't mind it.    They do have to be conditioned. The gasses of new Plasmas need to be conditioned. All you have to do is keep the brightness/contrast cranked way down for the first 100 hours, then optimize, and you'll have a TV that blows LCD out of the water.    Plasma myth (1) - They experience burn-in. This is BS, those days are gone. Just condition the gasses and then use it as normal and you're fine.  Also, the better sets have built-in features to prevent this (on top of the technology just generally being better now than say 5 years ago).    Plasma myth (2) - They have short life spans. This is more BS. You can leave your Plasma on 24/7 for 34 years before killing it. So do you think you'll still want/own the same TV in 15 years, let alone 30?    Plasma myth (3) - They won't work in high altitude because of problems for the gasses.  This is again no longer an issue.  Current Plasmas can be purchased and used in mile high Denver, and above, so you'll be fine where ever you are (unless you're living in the Himalayas).    Plasma vs LCD - One important note though is TV size. In 42" and above you see and get the benefit of the Plasma advantages. But 40" and smaller and the benefits are diminishing. So if you're going way smaller than LCD is likely the better option.    Plasma brands - Pioneer Kuro Elite is the best, followed by Pioneer Kuro. But these can cost as much as a small car. Panasonic Viera is the next best and is much more cost effective. Then I would go with Samsung.    LCD brands - I would stick with Samsung, Sharp Aquos, and Sony (but only Sony if its on sale, otherwise it tends to be overpriced). Sony stopped manufacturing LCD panels, they now buy/use the same ones used in the Sharp Aquos sets.|`|0GngTBaFaa	plasma|`|VZPiLBVgaa	LCDS DEFINTELY!    but remember the only bad thing about these Tvs is that they pick up dust really easily|`|fWMat3xwaa	i taught jf everything he knows...not really..he just answers so thoroughly,leaving me nothing to contribute|`|HX6JjCTyaa	LCD is the way to go.Not burn-in,last longer.|`|J36Rc5DKaa	get lcd, DONT Get plasma. plasma will burn an image. plasma is crap. if u look at a plasma u can see the light reflection in the screen. u need 2 have all the windows and lights off for a good pic. lcd u can have ur blinds open and no light reflects off the screen|`|XbNQflFaaa	anyone who says plasmas are crap either doesnt do their research or already bought an lcd and plays ingnorance to the new changes in plasmas. burn in is no longer an issue, see the cnet reviews on plasmas. They purposely burn in an image for 48 hours and within 2 hours of regular watching its gone.     everything the first review says is right on the money, but tvs for gaming will always be a personal preference thing. I had a sharp aquos lcd before with my 360 that looked amazing. but when it got smashed i switched to a panasonic pz80u just last month that i picked up for $899. anywhere you buy it just try to get a good deal with them. best buy has huge overhead to the tvs always have alot of markup on them. they want your money, theyll drop the price. if not, someone else will. but the new plasma looks even better to me, everything is more realistic. as long as the setting isnt on "vibrant" lol    i think the refresh rate and color levels on a plasma make it ideal for gaming but thats just my opinion. other people say the brighter whites make lcds better. matter of opinion. although if you have a brightly lit room with lots of windows the light refraction off the plasma is going to drive you nuts. they can say theyve fixed it all they want but its still a pane of glass that reflects back like a window lol|`|PgIJfsTAaa	Plasma.

aLyJe1b3aa	no|`|Ur6H8gwkaa	I'm not afraid, I'm happy.    I was never a huge fan of VHS or DVD. I use/used them because it was the only thing available. Also, when hi-def TVs started coming out about 9 years ago, that was the signal not to build a big DVD library. I knew some hi-def format would have to come out.    Blu ray is amazing, it's better and what we need to feed all these high def TVs.    Yes they are more expensive now, but people said the same thing in 1997 when DVD came out, they were more expensive than VHS, but of course as popularity gained prices dropped.    I don't know what percentage of people feel the way you do, or feel the way I do. But I can't wait to see DVD die, it won't happen soon enough.|`|w6sVLYlUaa	yea me too.. jus imagine everyones gonna have to buy a new system that plays blu ray and new movies.... i love my surround sound. i use it for everythin t.v..music..sports..movies|`|7G8pvOPcaa	No Blu Ray is fantastic and blu ray players can still play dvd's!

I've got over 500 DVDs and then all of a sudden Blu Ray shows up and tries to replace them    But really I dont think so because there are too many DVDs out now for them to just say "Hey **** DVDs we got Blu Ray now"    Besides, there aren't enough movies that really belongs on Blu Ray    Pineapple Express on Blu Ray.....Come on....whose gonna tell the difference between Blu Ray and DVD unless the movie has a bunch of Special Effects in it|`|EtWIJrR2aa	it well happen, i think give it at most 5 years

pC2jGRKraa	My Canon 300D has a 2.5FPS motor, and a 4 shot burst in 6 mp RAW. And my Kodak Z650 compact can shoot 3 shot burst at 6mp (full quality). Finally with my 35mm SLR I can take a full reel of film at 5fps.    So no, not all cameras (including some compacts) lower burst quality. But some cameras will restrict the number of photos in the burst at full quality.|`|1abaa60b0511b1e2c248dd1b30e73037aa	do'nt quite understand your question. it wo'nt drop MP's. need to know what camera you're talking about. if it shoots RAW files then it would only slow the burst compared to jpeg.|`|Ur6H8gwkaa	some cameras lower the pixel count to allow for faster shooting.    I was just looking at a Fuji megazoom digital camera. It claimed to shoot something like 11 frames per second. That seemed high since dSLRs can't even do that. But it had a little asterisk next to that number. Sure enough it said, images drop to 3 MP I think, and if you shoot at 6 frames per second, it's about 5MP.    Only dSLRs allow you to keep full image size and quality when taking long strings of photos. Compact digital cameras don't have the computing power and they lack the ability of super fast write speeds (to memory card) to take lots of pics without lowering the quality.    Most compacts even knock down to 3MP or so if you shoot at high ISO, usually 3200 and 6400, but that's another post.|`|MOxT5QEuaa	you mean to say continuous shots on a single shutter release? quality is the same and not changed.

mnQXmZbeaa	At first it was going to be early 2009 but last i heard Sony said they were going to keep it going till 2011. ps2 is only going to get maybe less then half the games that come out on the ps3 but you have a good 2 yrs before you have to upgrade|`|3AChQgbZaa	well right now the ps2 is selling well at $140.  so when those sales decline the ps2 well probably get a price cut to $99,   Sony will keep making the ps2 as long as its profitable.

j5Apt8hWaa	Any 3 CCD sensor mini-DV camera will produce compatible video.    Panasonic, Canon, Sony and JVC all make cameras that can produce broadcast quality video.  The slight differences in colour hue or white balance that may be perceived will be not a result of which camera is being used, but the way the DP adjusts the WB on the camera before shooting each scene.  To make sure you can later balance the white balance between various camera, shoot a Macbeth colour chart at the beginning of each scene.  Then in post, you can have your editor make the necessary changes in each scene take.    http://www.filmtools.com/maccol.html|`|EJIsHdZhaa	Any miniDV camcorder with 3x 1/3 true widescreen chips will give similar results.    The most common will be:    Canon XL2  Sony FX1 / Z1    If you are dead keen then another DVX100b    There will be different qualities to each of the lenses (diaphragm shapes, subtle colour casts from the lens)    The main thing is that the controller takes absolute control over all of the exposure and manual settings, so that they are consistent.  Also, take into account shooting style (was regular op handheld or tripod?  static frames or zooms etc)  make sure footage is shot in the same picture aspect, as the DVX100 is switchable.  If you try to rescale in post it will show.
Jcz29H2Oaa	i just bought the env2, and my sister just bought the voyager, so i've been playing with both of them a lot. their both very good phones, but i personally like the env2 better. my sisters voyager lags a lot, and its brand new. also, sometimes the touch screen doesnt work and she has to push it a thousand times. my phone has had nooo problems. i love it. im a big texter too, i hate talking on the phone... so this phone is perfect for me :) its really quick and easy to text. good luck with your choice!|`|1BbnyTfBaa	Cell phone reviews and ratings:  http://cell-phones.toptenreviews.com/  http://www.consumersearch.com/search/rev...

tGw60KJUaa	Garmin is the best gps system, Garmin's interface is a key to their success part of what makes their devices such a pleasure to use. Simple controls and sub-screens make it easy to enter or search for destinations and get data about your trip. Simply touch the color screen to enter a destination, and nvi takes you there with turn-by-turn voice directions, 2-D or 3-D maps and smooth map updates as you navigate and more feature.    I suggestion a Garmin model is a 205, 205W, 255W.    205W: same as 205 but has a wide 4.3-Inch screen.    255W: same as 205W but has text-to-speech, you get turn by turn spoken directions with the real names of streets (e.g. "turn left in 50 feet at Nebraska Way", rather than merely "turn left in 50 feet").  http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0015EW...|`|MOxT5QEuaa	garmin|`|C9th0daNaa	tom tom 720|`|88E3oEm0aa	TOMTOM or Navman are the most trustful gps's.

QFqMgL42aa	Trust me... you get your money's worth from an iPod. You could get him the iPod nano 8gb, which is the cheapest iPod with a screen, and it comes in a load of different colours plus plenty of space for music, video, etc. It's small, lightweight, and you can buy your husband an arm band for it so he can use it at the gym with more ease. Other mp3 players might be cheaper, but they also don't give you as many options such as accessories. Plus iTunes is pretty extensive, allowing you to download music, tv shows, movies, free podcasts, etc.    As for playing it in the car, you can buy an iTrip, which transmits the iPod to the car's stereo system via the radio:  http://www.amazon.com/Griffin-iTrip-Tran...

7CgqvBRsaa	Sure.  It's all a matter of taste and how critical you are.    Happy listening!|`|Ur6H8gwkaa	Everything will work fine.    The Onkyo sound system does decode the new surround sound codecs found on blu ray (dolby digital plus, and dts HD etc) but you should understand the sound won't be much better than standard 5.1 and 6.1 dolby and dts. These all in one systems usually don't have the best receiver, and the speakers are usually on the cheap side.    Will the system bang? Hell yeah it will rock, but the sound won't be refined, nothing near what these new sound codecs can really do.    The samsung is good, but for that money, you are in Pioneer Kuro plasma land, why not take a hard look at that set.     Regular cable is going to look like crap on a large high def set, I won't sugar coat it. Step up to HD cable or HD SAT. DVDs usually look ok, blu ray will rock or course.    HDMI cables, the number will depend on how you want to connect everything. If you run everything to the onkyo, and it has enough HDMIs to handle everything, you run HDMI from the 360, the blu ray and HD cable or SAT if you get it, run it to the surround sound. Then one HDMI comes out and to the TV, and that's about it. There are more ways to do this, but I don't want to confuse the matter, that's just one way.    But for now, you'll just run regular cable to the TVs tuner in the back. Get the cheapest HDMI cables you can get, don't buy into the hype.    You could pay 100+ for monster cables, but I doubt you will see the difference over the 30 dollar philips cables you see at wal mart.    The blu ray player is fine. I've seen the cheap 200 dollar ones, and the super expensive Pioneer Elite blu ray, to be honest, It's not a huge difference, it seems like any decent brand name blu ray can deliver a killer pic since it's all digital anyway. The days of cheap vs expensive digital to analog converters it seems is over. I remember when that was a big deal, before HDMI ever existed on DVD.    And finally, I think that ps3 and 360 only support the older surround of dolby and dts, so that's fine, the onkyo can handle all that too.|`|8213dbb28238df28f026dac640239fb1aa	Yes, those things will allow you to do it all.  I put together a list on Amazon that you might be interested in reading.  I wanted to put together a list of products someone would need to go from nothing to HD in the most effecient manner (i.e. budget/value) possible.    http://www.amazon.com/The-Best-Hi-Def-Ho...    The TV - That's a fine Samsung.  You have a good size picture, a good contrast ratio and the 120Hz refresh rate.  However, I fail to see any difference between the 750 and the 650 except the price.  So maybe you could go with the 650 to save a hundred bucks or so.  It appears to have the same features.  Personally, if I were to recommend a TV I would go with a plasma.  They have a better picture and are now less expensive than LCD.    For example, the Panasonic TH-50PZ850U, like the Samsung LN52A650, is on cnet's "Best HD TVs" list.  The Panasonic is $1,650 while the 650 Samsung is $1,818.  (The model you mention, the 750, is $1,927.)  Are the extra 2 inches worth $300?    http://reviews.cnet.com/best-high-defini...    The HTIB - This is a nice system as far as HTIBs go.  It can handle the "HD audio" formats, it's 7.1 and Onkyo makes a good value product.  The only suggestion I might make is to buy an Onkyo receiver and a set of 5.1 speakers, because although Onkyo makes a fine receiver they aren't known for their speakers.  That said, this is a fine system and is exactly what I would buy if I didn't want to assemble my own system.    The Blu-ray player - You said a BD-P2500, but I think you meant the BD-P2550, right?  Either way, Samsung doesn't make the best Blu-ray players.  The  1 player in my (and cnet's) opinion is the Panasonic DMP-BD35.  It decodes the HD audio formats where the Samsung doesn't.  Costco had them for $230 last month.  It can be hard to find, but it's the player to get.    The HDMI cables - Sure, those are fine.  I would normally recommend monoprice.com because their cables are 24 rather than 28 AWG, but many of their HDMI cables are out of stock right now.    I swear I'm not a Pansasonic shill.  I actually really like Samsung products.  I love my Samsung LCD, so please don't think I'm trying to talk you out of anything.  I'm all about bang for the buck.  So while you could buy the Pioneer Kuro Pro for $3,000 I don't think it's worth the money.  Panasonic is the best value.  Onkyo is the best value.|`|DcUoZntOaa	yes it will give you what you're looking for.  peace!|`|sER6UGMWaa	Hey Panda     imma give you some better recommendations....     the television switch it up for a little more you can go with the Pioneer 5020 Plasma    dont need to worry about sports and lags or a screen that can be damaged easy  or the BIGGEST THING CONSUMERS ARE WANTING SO BAD THE GIMMICK 120HZ.(hahahahah)    the surround sound from what i was looking at i would say go with a denon receiver 1909 and seperate speakers... that system u picked does everything except the dolby true hd and dts master audio.. AND ALSO ONKYO IS RIGHT NXT TO SONY WHEN IT COME TO AUIDO ...HORRIBLE    blu ray keep that the same     AND THOSE HDMI CABLES U CAN GET THEM IF YOU WANT TO WASTE UR MONEY.. THEY DONT EVEN LIST THE TRANSFER RATE ON THE CABLE AT ALL SO IF YOUR WATCHING SOMETHING OF A HIGH BITRATE ITS GOING TO INTERMITT..     GOOD LUCK WITH YOUR PURCHASE..

DVD disk isnt ment to be used for audio(such as mp3 or wma format). so you will gave to wait till u get a blank cd to burn the music to and transfer it to the 360 HDD. hope this helps

jbYOq247aa	The Logitech Harmony 720 offers a slighter better color screen and a slimmer, sexier design than those of Harmony's original color-screen model, the 880. This model also includes a rechargeable lithium-ion battery and docking station, and like other Harmony remotes, the 720 is Web programmable and is compatible with Windows and Macintosh machines.    The badThe bad: The remote could sit a little more securely in its dock, the Web interface may intimidate nontechie users, and the painted text labels printed on the case under the transport control buttons may rub off with extended use.    The bottom lineThe bottom line: The combination of a color screen, a battery charger dock, and a sleek design makes the Logitech Harmony 720 one of the company's best universal remotes to date.     The Logitech Harmony 880 was the first Harmony remote to feature a color screen and a built-in rechargeable battery along with a docking station. Overall, we liked the design of that model, as well as its nearly identical RF-capable (radio frequency) sibling, the Harmony 890. But as soon as Logitech came out with its thinner, sleeker 2006 line of monochrome Harmony models--the 520, the 550, and the Advanced Remote Control for Xbox 360, we knew it was only a matter of time before the company found a way to throw a color screen and a rechargeable battery into the new, slim chassis. And now it has.    Priced at $200 (list), the Logitech Harmony 720, like the less-expensive Harmony 520, is currently sold at discount stores such as Wal-Mart and Costco. Measuring 8.1 inches long by 2.1 inches wide and less than an inch thick, the 6-ounce 720 is a little more than an inch longer than the Harmony 520, 550, and Xbox 360 remotes. As noted, the biggest difference between this model and those is the color screen and the rechargeable lithium ion battery.
HBNx77BBaa	I don't know why you needed to put them back on the SD. If you do, they will need to be in the right folder. When you format the card in the camera you'll see that it creates at least one folder, possibly more than one. One of them is the folder it uses for pictures and if yours are not copied back into that folder then the camera will not find them.
HBNx77BBaa	You say you charged both batteries. This camera as far as I can see takes the Sony NP BG1 lithium rechargeable. If you have two of those and neither works then it's likely the camera has now stopped working and I think any repair would be expensive.    I wouldn't risk a repair if the camera has had a bit of a hard time in the past. You could pay out to get it going only for something else to fail. Apart from wiping the battery contacts with a lint-free cloth there's not much else you can do. You could try taking out the Memory Stick. If that brings it back to life it could just be that the Memory Stick has gone faulty.|`|tLBcDE6naa	try take the batteries out put them back in. if not. then buy some new batteries

Xtq5L6jpaa	Hi, it all depends on if you mean - the 6600 has newer versions, which are NOT discontinued... you see...    The NEWER Nokia 6600 Slide: ( http://www.ibuymobiles.com/show.asp?netw... )     Or the NEWER Nokia 6600 Fold: ( http://www.ibuymobiles.com/show.asp?netw... )    OR... The OLDER Nokia 6600 - ( http://www.nokia.co.uk/A4221191 )    Although personally, if you like your music, I would go with the Nokia 5800 XpressMusic - In RED!!!

Rather take the phone to a Samsung authorized service center where they will just replace the port.  It shouldn't be too expensive.  You can locate the nearest service center on http://samsungmobile.com.    Good luck

Cl8FwsI2aa	It is highly likely for the next Xbox to be called Xbox 720. It's expected to launch in 2011-2012 according to Microsoft. The features of the console haven't been revealed, it's too early. This is just an estimate.|`|b2af104a189227ec51e22f6b307ab4eeaa	the new XBOX will not be called the 360, or 720, or any other names proposed here, so don't beleive any of it.  It will probably come out in 2012, since the life of the 360 has been extended by the addition of HDMI support and the NXE.  Since chipset technology will become about 4 times faster between now and then according to moore's law, it is impossible to say exactly what features it will have.  Probably blu-ray and built in 802.11n Wi-Fi, if i had to guess.|`|WQbJhFORaa	It will be called Skynet.    Now think about that one!    Features include (but not limited to) Self thinking and learning capabilities and the ability to obliterate all life on earth with nuclear weapons, mechanized humanoid soldiers and giant assault vehicles that look like E.T on acid.
vgxEN4MGaa	Hey Matt, just wanted to let you know your an idiot. =)    The PS3's price is its price, you'll be lucky to cut about 50-60 off the price if you get it used or refurbished.    Brand new its going to cost the same amount, its going to be expensive.    What i suggest you do is get off your lazy a$$ and get a job instead of playing your PS2 and thinking your PS3 upgrade will come outta nowhere. Once you have enough money, you will exchange it for a shiny new PS3 and bask in the glory of this gen's most powerful console.    Oh yeah you could try eBay or craigslist|`|iW2jdfkJaa	Here you go.

fZqvuKHuaa	You can buy a wireless internet dongle on contract from pc stores or phone stores, they usually throw a laptop in with it, so you could be paying between 15 and 30 a month.    Mobile internet is terribly pricey, slow and quite annoying considering half the time you only get a bit of the page before the phone runs out of memory and tries to reload it.    If it were me, I'd just get the laptop. You can make calls over the internet using skype if you need too. :)|`|jsW45ETkaa	IN THE U.S. I THINK WE STILL USE THE TERM "MOBILE PHONE" TO MEAN A PHONE HARD WIRED TO A CAR OR OTHER VEHICLE WITH AN ANTENNA USUALLY MOUNTED ON THE BACK GLASS AND THE PHONE PERHAPPS IN THE CENTER CONSOLE.  SO, I THINK YOU MEANT A CELL PHONE. CELL PHONES WITH INTERNET CAPACITY AND A TINY SCREEN ARE MORE EXPENSIVE THAN A PLAINER MODEL, BUT ARE MUCH CHEAPER THAN A LAPTOP FOR DAILY OR YEARLY USE.  THAT ANSWERS YOUR QUESTION, BUT I HAVE ADVICE OR RATHER A GUEST, BACK TO YOU.  COMPARED TOP THE BIG LAPTOP SCREEN I'M LOOKING AT NOW, STAIN YOUR EYES ON TINY PRINT OR HAVE TO SOMEWAY SWEEP YOUR TINY PIN-HOLE VIEW AROUND EACH PAGE TO SEE ALL ( I NEVER SAW ONE CLOSE ENOUGH TO KNOW HOW IT'S DONE) AND DINKER AROUND WITH THOSE LITTLE KEYS IF THERE ARE AS MANY AND IF ANY TOOLS OR WAYS TO CLICK ARE ON THEM, PLUS CONSTANTLY STOPPING TO FIND A PUBLIC PLACE TO PLUG IN AND RECHARGE AND TRYING TO QUICKLY FINISH AN EMAIL WITHOUT DROPPING THE CELL WHEN YOU HAVE A LOW CHARGE INDICATOR ?

AA11525080	DFU Mode (Windows/Mac Compatible method)    Before you begin, turn on your iPod Touch (make sure it won't auto lock, to prevent mistakes), and connect it to iTunes. Once iTunes shows your device, perform the following steps:    Step 1: Hold down the Home button    Step 2: Hold down the Standby button    Step 3: When it says slide to turn off, ignore it. It should restart with a blank screen. Look at iTunes, and your device should be removed. Now lift the Standby button, while still holding onto the Home button.    Step 4: Keep holding the Home button until the iPod reconnects on iTunes. When the device shows up in iTunes, thats when youll need to lift up your button. If you wait any longer, it will go into Recovery Mode, and thats not what you want. Your iPod should be blank.    Step 5: Now iTunes will tell you that the iPod Touch is in Recover Mode. You can now perform a manual restore on it.

However, if it is not the Elite, it does not come with the needed cable.  So obtain a cable if needed, and plug the cord from the XBOX to the TV. (Make sure to take out the old cord). Whatever the resolution of your TV (either 720p or 1080i or 1080p) set the XBOX to match it in the Dashboard, and that will give you your best experience.

HBNx77BBaa	Empenage2003 is right. dpreview.com is a good place to compare camera specifications. You can choose any cameras to compare side by side. It helps to pick out the key features.    Canon Powershot cameras are a good choice. I'm very biased but I don't think many people disagree, even Nikon fans like Ken Rockwell...    http://www.kenrockwell.com/tech/recommen...    As far as your two choices go, these are the things that strike me:    The A650 is more expensive, quite a lot smaller  and just over half the weight of the S5.    The A650 has more megapixels BUT it has a much bigger sensor too, so the megapixels are not wasted. The pixel density figure is actually lower on the A650 so it will have less problems with image noise despite the higher resolution.    Neither has a particularly wide angle of view at the short end of the zoom. I'd prefer to see something like 28 mm equivalent.    The S5 has a 6x zoom compared to the A650's 3x zoom.    The A650 can focus right down to 1 cm from the lens. Great for super close ups. The S5 can focus to 10 cm.    The S5 has the better LCD. Same size but more dots.    The S5 has an electronic viewfinder which gives an accurate view of what the camera will photograph. The A650 has a peep-hole finder. These never quite line up with the photograph that you will capture though you will get to know what to expect once you've used it a few times.    Both cameras were released mid 2007 and must be due for replacement pretty soon. Replacements are not always a step in the right direction though. More pixels for example can be a bad thing.    If you can't decide then flip a coin. You always have an uneasy feeling when the coin falls the wrong way up!

More than 1/2 people never mention how much they plan to spend. So, how much ya spending?   I will let the experts guide you to a digital SLR. $700- is a lot of money, basically out of the point and shoot range. Be aware one can get get excellent 8X10 photos from point and shoot cameras and very acceptable 11X14s.   Digital SLRS is where you have complete control over all photos, ranging from setting shutter speed/aperture, changing lenses etc. So if you want to fuss and bother, put the time into every shot, and carry a fairly large camera around; then a digital SLR is for you. They start about $450- and go up.

joQ6cZ5Maa	For hard core gaming, it is a little weak.     Your graphics is good as the HD 4870 is a good card. The ram is low, but it also would depend on the OS you are running. The HDD is not that bad but a second HDD would be good as many games are now requiring a few gb to install and 250 can be filled quickly.   The biggest issue with this rig is the cpu at 2.33 as it would be considered "weak". You should have a cpu clocking at 3ghz as there are many games that are requiring 2.4 dual core to run. I know that you can overclock this issue but you run many risk such as voiding any warranty.     Depending on the OS, you have a mid range machine (Using Vista)that can be a possible mid-high range (Using XP or Linux). It will still be good for gaming but there might be a few rare titles that you might not be able to run.     On a side note, anybody that states you need a quad is "out to lunch" as there are no programs that will use a quad. Quads right now are just status symbols for power users (I know many and none could use all four cores at max level)  The closest program is suppose to come out in 2010 around Q2 or Q3.|`|7dedb1d505bc774b219a42c84ed2ca4caa	Eh?

Thats because I have exactly the same E6550 and 2GB system, with a 9800GTX+    HD 4870, is a more expensive and faster video card    Well, it may not be exactly hard core, depends on how you define it    But it can achive above 60fps in COD4 with 2xAA, much more in CS source. Unreal 3 also should hovers above 50fps    If you are into those multiplayer shooting game, then yes, 60fps or more is fast enough for most hardcore player|`|ggKeBL7Laa	it is good enough ..|`|HAxxlee2aa	no its hopeless you won't be able to play anything!|`|MPCKTIvaaa	ur pc is weak wat a weast of money i paid 1500 and got 2 gigs of ram 300 gb harddrive sli mother board 9550 qua core chip plays everything out|`|pacGKaYFaa	hardcore gaming, probably not.  Good specs though, you won't have problems running games on high; just not Max.  Processor is decent.

wQiGnJepaa	Different frequencies, satellite dishes are receive only, wifi is send/receive, so the electronics will do you no good.    You could build a cantenna, and at least one person has used a satellite dish as a reflector to hopefully boost the range even more.|`|9mTctb7jaa	The loss in the coax running up to the roof will more than compesate for any gain. Satellite works because there is a frequency converter (LNC) at the feed. While the dish is frequency independent, the LNC is not. Also you need a 2 way connection for wifi which makes any outboard LNC/Amplifier a difficult construction project.
k3Zjfxgnaa	Well an iPod technically is an mp3/mp4 player. (depends which type of ipod)    An mp3 is the format of the file which makes it an audio file (music)    Whereas an mp4 is the format of a file which makes it a video file (movie)    When your in the shops you may see mp3 or mp4 PLAYERS which just access the files to be heard/viewed.    iPod is owned by Apple which dominates 95% of the mp3/mp4 marketplace and makes brands like sony, samsung etc. just want to hang themselves because they can never match the power of the iPod.  You may notice in commercials that some of smasungs new products look alot like Apples designs. Although that has not been too successful.|`|DjOVM9jeaa	MP3 and MP4 are different file formats and an iPod is an apple branded media player i think :D|`|AA11821715	The price and program used.

F67IRVmvaa	I doubt you can get it off of the iPod...    You CAN get it off of HIS iTunes. All you need to do is set your iPod to "manual". With you iPod set to manual you can connect to your friend's computers and your iPod won't sync his library.    To do this:    (1) Connect the iPod into YOUR computer.  (2) Click on your iPod, once it shows up on iTunes.  (3) Click on "Manually Manage Music and Videos"    A message will pop up telling you that you'll have to eject the iPod manually - click "yes" or "okay". This means that you'll have to hit the "Eject" button before removing your iPod from the computer.    Now, all you have to do is connect your iPod to his computer, click-and-drag the episode onto your iPod and you're done.

I'd highly recommend them.    ** edit **  The 1 gig gives you about  225-250 songs, depending on the length.  Mine holds almost 12 hrs of music and about 15 hrs of  battery.

vgxEN4MGaa	You connect PS3 to internet via 2 ways.    Wired way. You plug an ethernet cable into back of your PS3, and the other end into your WIRELESS ROUTER. You dont plug it into your laptop or any other device, it has to be plugged into the router itself, or if you dont have on it needs to be plugged into your internet modem's ethernet port.    Wireless way. In PS3 go to system settings > scroll down to wireless network settings and that guides you through the process of connecting your PS3 to your wireless router. PS3 has built in w-fi so you dont need anything else, just follow the on screen instructions on how to get online.|`|SwdWPAmBaa	you need to either 'bridge' your ethernet adaptor to the aircard adaptor in Vistas network settings or enable internet connection sharing (but i dont know if that works without windows ie: a ps3)

Use your PS2 to play games. Leave the computer alone.|`|vgxEN4MGaa	Yeah you could via USB, but nothing would happen...    To play PS2 games on your computer you need an emulator software. This is basically 'the virtual PS2'. And then you will need to download ROMS, 'the PS2 games' off the internet and play them on your PC.    All in all its quite a stupid process. Most people do it if they cant afford a PS2 game or just love their computer too much.
TwIK4Ivlaa	You can easily use the mentioned Nikkor lens and most of the earlier Nikkor lenses too on new DSLR bodies.    The mount has remained the same. The only problem is with some specific ultra-wide lenses and some fisheye which had a rear element which projected back.    One another thing to keep in mind is that in the lower DSLR bodies, you'll be able to use the lens only with the aperture wide open. With bodies like D200 and above, you'll be able to use the lens with proper aperture control and 3D matrix metering.    Nikkor 50mm f/1.4 or f/1.8 are very good prime lenses and can be used without much problem on DSLR's in terms of picture quality. However there's another problem that needs to be considered. Most of the old lenses when being used on a DSLR can cause unwanted flare. This happens due to mirror like surface of the sensor (low pass filter) which reflects the light (unlike the surface of film) and can cause problems.  Most of the lenses meant for digital use have special coatings or construction on the rear element too so as to reduce this.|`|1abaa60b0511b1e2c248dd1b30e73037aa	yes but you lose auto focus. and unless your camera is full frame, the focal length increases by 1.5x|`|eVptHOOBaa	You're lucky, because you have Nikon, which is known for most compatibility between older glass and newer bodies, so you have a good chance. There are some reservations, and some lenses require minor modification...    Here's a great page that lists all Nikon lenses and all bodies, and tells you what is compatible with what and with what kind of limitations:  http://www.kenrockwell.com/nikon/compati...    You didn't mention specifically what lens, so you'll have to look it up there.     LEM.|`|3TqPF1zMaa	Nikon has used the Nikon F mount since 1959, so your older f/1.8 lens should connect to any Nikon SLR camera. How much function you get from the lens depends on the camera, however. If it's an AF autofocus lens, you will need a camera with a AF autofocus motor & screw to operate it. (The entry-level Nikon D40, D40x and D60 cameras do not have an AF autofocus motor) Depending on the specific lens model, you will likely need at least a Nikon D200, D300 or D700 camera to get working automatic exposure control.

Just the 2-13 and 20-69 .  If you want cable channels call your local cable company .|`|nQ7G1nBVaa	In a manner, yes. It will the the digital version of those channels though, which would be numbers like 2.1,4.1 and so on, as well as any sub channels, like 7.2 and 7.3.    That is assuming you receive those respective digital signals.|`|TJGje2blaa	Yes.  You'll get a few more channels, mostly for kids & spanish, but mine doesn't pick up our Ch-10 or Ch-38.  The converter  says NO SIGNAL, but the Rabbit Ears got the signals on them, though Ch-10 has always been a weak channel to receive.   Ch-38 is a strong signal station, though, so don't know what the problem is, there.
HBNx77BBaa	They're pretty similar. If you need an optical viewfinder then it's the Sony. You can compare the other features using the side-by-side feature in the 'Buying Guide' on dpreview.com.    These caught my eye...    Sony has the 4x zoom but very small aperture (f7.1) when zoomed in.  Lumix has 3x zoom but maintains aperture of f5.1 when zoomed in.    Lumix can do long exposures, up to 60 seconds. Sony only up to 1 second.    Lumix can shoot at a rate of 3 frames per second on continuous drive, but only for 7 shots. Sony only does 1.5 frames per second but can take up to 100 shots in a continuous burst (if 1.5 fps can be called a burst).    The LCD on the Lumix is much better - twice the number of dots. Both have a 2.5 inch screen.    Lumix has face detection (your call on whether that's a feature or a gimmick...)    Not many user opinions post on that site for either camera. Given a choice between the two, I would go for the Lumix.|`|UXz53E6Qaa	They are both good ultra compact cameras. The decision probably comes down to image quality - which do you find more appealing?    Here are some sample shots from each:    FS3:  http://www.pbase.com/cameras/panasonic/l...    W120:  http://www.pbase.com/cameras/sony/dsc_w1...
MUERDKyzaa	Yes they can provide coverage by you unlocking your iphone.  For the guy above me, unlocking is NOT the same as jailbreaking.  Unlocking a phone is not illegal here in the UK, but certain providers in the US and Spain for example do not condone it.   Unlocking is illegal when the phone in question is reported stolen.  So you can get a different network on your iphone by unlocking but I'm not too knowledgeable in that department as I haven't tried it. But there are risks, such as if you try to update the iphone software through itunes, your iphone will become "bricked", but I hear you can even still fully restore the iphone lol. The guy above is just trying to scare you man.|`|AA12180617	Legally not in the UK.    the iphone has an exclusive agreement with O@ (partly because it has the best 3G coverage and speed in the UK).  in France its Orange and Germany T-mobile/vodafone.    you can get SIM unlock overlays that fool the phone into thinking your SIM is from O@ and allow it to work but other 3G networks cannot cope with the traffic!    NEVER be tempted to jailbreak (HACK) to get the phone unlocked..    Cydia (and other jailbreaks) have cause more problems for people than its worth.. (I never jailbreak but buy apps like Air sharing to enable limited disk use) as the only other extra is unapproved apps and background wallpapers (which are distracting).    NEVER JAILBREAK! It causes so many problems and yet adds nearly nothing!    the 2.2 software from apple is stable and works well and lets you add hundreds of apps (many free) from the itunes App Store, many with features available in jailbroken items.    Jail breaking became redundant when the 2.0 software was released as it add almost nothing to the ipods abilities (other than the ability to browse its file structure which also makes it less secure).    Jail breaking also voids the warranty and does cause many issues form files vanishing, memory leaks and loss, rebooting and even failing to boot.    Jailbroken ipods cause so many problems (just search on here for them).  It alters the boot code so its not really an iphone at all.
VcNHahtgaa	Wii is the worst console out there right now. It's just basically a new Gamecube with motion sensor. Barely any good games, and can't even reach HD. It can't play all the good games 360 and PS3 has like Grand Theft Auto 4 and doesn't have a good online as 360 and PS3 has also.    ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~  PROS:  PS3 -  1. Free Online, keeps getting better. Soon to match Xbox Live.  2. Full 1080p resolution  3. Built In Blu Ray  4. Cheaper HardDrives to Add [320GB for $80]  5. Comes with a USB device to charge your Controller.  6. Internet Browser  7. Home and Life have a lot of potential to get better, FREE also.  8. Browse Youtube with "TV" option. [Only Wii + PS3 have this]  9. Might make a deal with Blockbuster to make something similar to Netflix with 360.  10. 0.2% chance of failing. Most consumer products have a 2% fail rate.    Xbox360-  1. Netflix.  2. 3 year warranty    CONS:  PS3 -  1. New PS3's can't play PS2 games  2. 1 year warranty  3. Cost $150 to fix it if passed your 1 year warranty.      Xbox360 -  1. 33% fail rate meaning you can't play it and if you want to fix it you have to send it to microsoft for them to fix it and you will get it back approx. 3 WEEKS and has 33% of it failing again [PS3 has 0.2%]  2. Pay for online gaming $50 a year  3. Have to buy many add ons  4. Buy a recharger for controllers.  5. Cost more for HardDrive [60GB $100]  6.

Nintendo is just milking us all with the wireless gadgets and low resolution image quality games.  If you want a real next-gen game console, consider either the PS3 or the Xbox360. Xbox360, sadly has already established itself in the gaming console history as an unparalleled technical fiasco! 33% of all Xbox360 have the red ring of death problem. That means, 1 out of every 3 Xbox360 that comes out of Microsoft's factories, are doomed. Now, what most people would say about the PS3 - it has no games. LOL. This is so very false, as the PS3 is the real innovative platform for new games and breakthrough graphics. Xbox360 didn't have anything worth playing other than Halo and Gears of War. And Xbox360 came out a whole year before the PS3, so it's perfectly understandable why it should have more games, right? Take a look at the lineup of games for the PS3 this year, and you will see that most (like 90%) of the best great new games scheduled for 2009 and 2010 are on the PS3. Xbox360 had to buy Resident Evil 5 to its console along with a few other exclusive PS3 titles, as it  couldn't have held up to the game giant Playstation3.|`|thqxoja1aa	wii is the best|`|pl2SocVKaa	ps3
VMVW3E7Aaa	People so often ask: "Which one is a good camera to buy?"  Here is my 10 cents on the subject:    Point & Shoot cameras are wonderfully handy because of their small size.  When light conditions are ideal, they even take really nice photos - all of them do.    However, they all DO have limitations - they don't do very well in low light situations  (i.e. noisy photos, hard to avoid blur, etc). The little onboard flash is very harsh at close range, and doesn't reach very far.  Many of them have no manual functions, so you are limited to only very basic photos, you can't compensate for unusual situations, or do many fun "tricks" and special effects.  P&S's  also suffer from  frustrating shutterlag and many of them chew through batteries rather quickly.    However, if you're ok with all those limitations, then go ahead and pick one, most of them (the same type and same price range) are rather similar. Personally I would pick either a Canon or a Nikon, and would certainly stay away from Kodak.     A higher end P&S will give you more manual options and better quality.  Many of those even give you the option of adding a proper flash (which makes a big difference to your flash photos).    Don't worry too much about megapixels. there is a limit to how many pixels you can squash into a tiny P&S sensor before you actually LOSE quality rather than gain it.  Don't worry about digital zoom, in fact, don't EVER use it. It simply crops away pixels , i.e. destroys information. The only real zoom is optical.    Decide which features are important to you, and look for cameras that have that feature.   Then go compare a few models on www.dpreview.com  .      The very best thing you can do for your success is to borrow some books and learn about basic photography.  A bit of knowledge will make a much bigger difference to your photos than your choice of P&S camera can.    For what it's worth - if I was in the market for a P&S camera right now, my choice would be a Canon Powershot  SX10 IS http://www.usa.canon.com/consumer/contro...|`|0JV3tQm8aa	These cameras are really great    Canon SD1100 IS  Canon Powershot A590IS|`|a9398092706b68241341a0195af9943eaa	The camera I suggest you can not adjust shutter speed nor aperture  (if that's what u want to do). But image is very good quality. canon SD1100 IS. 3X optical zoom, 8 megapixels, has image stabilizer. It's a subcompact, on line at Buydig is $149-+ shipping.|`|cc030d61dc9bcfd7d41ed6138df0d0b1aa	canon sd1100|`|HBNx77BBaa	You don't give a budget, but from what you say I think the Panasonic Lumix LX3 was made to measure...    http://www.dpreview.com/reviews/Q408enth...    Second thoughts now I've looked at those Stylus cameras. They were both weatherproof and quite small while the LX3 is a bit bigger and not weatherproof... Still worth a look. Image quality sounds important to you and so many compacts are over-choked with megapixels.
vLvfjCNLaa	It does work, I have had one for a few months now. It costs $39.95 for the first year and $19.95 a year after that. You do get free long distance and local calls too. I read a good review on the service from the following site and it has a link to the 30 day free trial. The nice thing about this is, they don't charge you credit card for 30 days. So, you can try the service out for a month without being charged.    http://www.squidoo.com/MagicJack_Reviews      Hope this helps!
d64OgIXFaa	Go inside the house (make sure you put a door) and press the + button on your wii remote. That should put you in construction mode. The stuff you need to put inside is under the interest blocks category on the menu at the bottom of the screen when you go in construction mode.|`|GxaGHGBNaa	OH thats nasty...|`|EJO1Gznnaa	Well on just the normal my sims you just come out of the build mode, Then walk into the house and go on the option, Give stuff or something like that, On the top right hand side of the screen. I'm guessing they're the same      Sorry not much help x
AA12116276	The kind of computer you have is not really the issue; it's more about the turntable. If the turntable has something like a headphone jack on it, then you could probably get an audio cable (the one where on both ends, looks like the end of headphones, so you can plug one end into the headphone jack of the turntable and the other end into the computer's line-in jack if there is one or the mic jack). You can record using a wave editor, for example. Can find free ones online.    Way simpler, unless these are scarce mixes or such, is just finding the music online again by using something free like limewire or torrents, or paying a bit for a site like mp3skyline (which has a lot of converted records on it).

You have to have completed at least 21 months of a 24 month service agreement to become eligible for an upgrade.  Your choices now are to get a cheap GoPhone and put your SIM in it; buy a new phone at full retail price; or go to eBay or Craigslit or amazon.com or places like that and purchase a replacement there|`|8nwWNExiaa	hurry and go to dtoppdesigns.com...they will fix and insure it for you.  on the site it says that they only fix iPhones but they fix other phones as well
Q3gYvxq3aa	First I just want to say that the delivery time for this object from Amazon was very quick, and very convenient. At the time I thought I would be going home soon, and so the quick-paced delivery made me happy. I was low on cash and this gift seemed perfect for my situation.    The Pro Ebiz 4 GB Video MP3/MP4 Player with 2.8-inch TFT Touchscreen stands at a nice simple payment of 47.95, which does not include shipping, but who cares?! Its cheap right?! It looks and is advertised like an "i touch", and with the holiday season at our doorstep, it is  the perfect gift for the nephew, or young child in the family, or even sibling, correct?    It all depends on you...    You see, there are two kinds of things in this world...awesome...and not...    I sat there on that day when it finally arrived to my PO Box, hoping that it would be the day that my low-grade version of the "i touch" would finally get there. It did finally get there, and I sat it aside so that I could complete my  photography final due that evening. I soon took a break however and found myself opening the white rectangular small box which housed my new gift. I was in a state of instant disappointment. At first, the dust and dirt on the unprotected screen left me to believe it had been used, when I had bought it new. With a few quick wipes, the grudge found its way off of my new MP3 player. I looked further in the box, a car charger, billing statement, cheap headphones which I shall return to, a charger/usb chord to go with it, and a tiny CD. Turning it on I had wondered if the MP3 player had been charged at all, and was happy to find that it had been until 3 seconds later when the opening graphics welcoming me looked like something out of one of those cheap videogame arcade's that you plug into the back of your televisions. I found myself pressing against the screen at all the icons displayed and realized that the screen was not so much a touchscreen as it seemed to be a LCD screen over a series of buttons. The screen pressed in, especially in the corners, and even seemed to crack once under the weight of my thumb. About this time I realized there was suppose to be a stylus included with it that I had not received, and after further research I found that nobody even mentioned the stylus in reviews or complaints, I am guessing it was never going to come even though the webpage for the Pro Ebiz 4 GB Video MP3/MP4 Player with 2.8-inch TFT Touchscreen lists the stylus as part of the package, and includes one in the pictures of the MP3 player. It did not bug me too much though as I pressed down with the tips of my fingernails to try to replicate a stylus as closely as possible to no real avail. I then found myself continuing my thumb pressing technique. I only played around with a few of the icons at the time, music, video, and games were the big ones. After solving the labyrinth and puzzles of the format in which things were kept within the player, The music icon contained only one song, but the built in speaker on the MP3 player was really not that bad, I have still not figured out how loud it can get but set at about 33 was more than loud enough to hear the quality of the song included in the player. I then decided to try out the headphones...cheap, bulky, plastic, are a few child-friendly words that come to mind... They sucked basically, just holding them brought forth small rattling sounds within the poorly crafted object and the ear-buds themselves were huge, not like ridiculously so, but not comfortably so either. I was not impressed. About this time is when I also realized that the screen did not rotate like an itouch, I was not necessarily expecting it to, however it would have been nice. The icons themselves look like 12 bit colored icons, something off of an old Mac computer, kind of pixilated, nothing special. The LCD back lighting is pretty nice and nothing to complain about. The Movie quality is very good for the sample given however that's another adventure altogether because apparently the movies must be in avi format, and the software included, contains this converter, however when I used it, it did not work, and is more than likely out of date. The games on the MP3 player are stupid for lack of better term. They are not touch screen and this quote from the instructions booklet will hopefully make more sense to you than to me... (the instruction booklet is 6 very thin pieces of small paper stapled together with horrible low-contrast pictures and the appearance of a dying ink cartridge) ..." Push the power switch to the (unclear picture) direction for one second to start the games. Short press PLAY to perform..." I'll stop there simply because nobody knows what a "short press" is. Does that mean half way? For a second? What? Further examination of the MP3 player revealed NO play button and the games besides not being touch-screen compatible, seem to operate off of the volume buttons???? PLUS only one game comes with the player, and the
