20090225145211AAyeemD	Business & Finance;Personal Finance	Getting divorced, financial question?	My husband and I are getting divorced. He supports me financially and the plan was that he would continue doing so while I am in school.    I am lost and need some spousal support for awhile to get myself on my own feet.    I do not want him to pay any of my school loan debt, but I would like around 400 a month for a year to supplement what I cannot cover in my own rent.       I have around 10,000 dollars of student loans. I have heard that he is financially responsible for half of that debt. Again I do not want him to pay this, but should I include it in my first petition to gain leverage?      I hate this whole business of asking for financial help from him because before we were married I was financially independent, however I just can not pay to live on my own while in school (although I will be able to soon!)   I cannot get anymore financial assistance from school, since I still have to claim his income on my student aid forms. I will be able to next year though.       I'm hoping someone with experience and legal knowledge can give me some advice   41 minutes ago - 4 days left to answer.    Additional Details   It was my husband and my choice for me to focus on school so that I can have a prosperous career.    He has his career now because I picked up the slack when he was in school      Our divorce is amicable at this point, I just am not sure that it will stay that way. You never know!         I do not plan on getting a lawyer, I plan on filling online.

All of them said if you don't come with your realtor on your first visit, they don't get commission.  When our house in the other city sold, we got a realtor to show us around and signed a buyers agreement.  Everything in our price range is a dump but the new houses are perfect.  We have decided that we want to live in one of the ones that was NOT introduced to us by our realtor that we saw before.  Since he did not introduce the property to us and we saw it before we signed the buyers agreement, do we have to pay him?

We aren't sure how long that will take to fix and the foreclosure bank is saying if the deal isn't done by the 27th its off the table, along with our hand money and expenses.

I would like to get a Bachelor's degree in either marketing or business with a marketing emphasis (depending on what they offer), but I've heard stories about a lot of organizations/companies who hired the job seeker who had a non-marketing background rather than the job seeker who had a marketing/business background, because the guy who was hired was more familiar with the products/services that he would be dealing with (i.e, Microsoft hires someone who majored in computer engineering to work in marketing some hardware/software)      My question is this: If I know that I want to work in marketing or some related field in the future, is it better for me to go for a degree in marketing, or is it better for me to ignore marketing in the 1st 4 years of college and study a "concrete" major instead?

My husband graduates this May from college and we both work full-time jobs. We are both covered as well as the pregnancy under my husbands insurance through his work which is a group plan.  After he graduates he'll start his internship with the company he'll hopefully be working for.  That baby is due June 7th, which is after my husband will be graduating and starting his internship.  He's trying to find a company that will start us off with insurance right away during his internship so we are covered for the birth of our child and the baby its self, but if this doesn't happen, what can we do? Does anyone have any ideas?  I don't think a private company like State Farm will cover me during the transition cause it's a preexisting condition.  Any advice or suggestions would be great!

20090129005640AA2oDts	Business & Finance;Small Business	Any recommendations for accounts packages for retail business?	I run an internet based craft retail company and have been doing our accounting with a spreadsheet for a few years but this method usually means having to spend a week doing the accounts just before the deadline so would like to move into a package which will make it easier to keep up to the accounts on a weekly basis.      Our sales are all over the internet so payment at order point, hence we have no need to be able to invoice.  My internet package produces stock inventory reports so again no need for the accounts to deal with stock reports.   I basically need to be able to enter invoices I have received, dates paid and method of payment.  I need to be able to enter sales in quite a bare sense i.e. daily sales not nec. individual sales with customer details.  I want to be able to budget and get quick overviews of my income/expenditure across different areas i.e packaging, postage.      Being able to tie in my personal accounts as a separate 'business' would be a big benefit as we are home-based so this would allow me to easily enable the business to pay it's share of utilities etc.      Any tips greatly appreciated

I am currently living in the state of Maine and I am trying to find out information on how to forcible seize or in any way seize the home that I am living in from the landlord. The house that I am living in is in many code violations and is in a great deal of disrepair. I  would like to make this a home for my family and I but there is becoming a great problem with the landlord.     We have tried on numerous accounts to come to some form of agreement between us but nothing has resolved.    The landlord refuses to repair a broken back door allowing the frigid winter cold into our home and refuses to compensate us for the expense of oil (reimbursement was promised in part).     So what I am trying to find is a course of action that I can take to seize this property from him or have it so that this property is turned over to me.    Any information on a course of action that could possible be taken please feel free to give any thoughts or information that may help me.    Thank you.

Only buyers can use.  They rate you on various things, from 1-5.  If you get below a 4.1 or 4.3 in any one of the four possible areas like shipping time or communication, you cannot sell anymore until your monthly average goes up.  This past holiday season, I had a printing company I use make things impossible for me to ship fast.  Of course, then I got below ebays standards.  Now I can't relist anything and have around $100 in eBay fees, and no money to pay it and no way to make it back.  Do you think this sounds unfair?

So let alone my shaky situation of being amongst the recently laid off, since I am a Salaried Employee and basically "willing and able to work" doesn't my employer have to still pay me my full salary? If I am missing a day from a week of work , unexcused , they can deduct monies. But I thought they would still have to pay me no matter what, especially when my absenteeism has nothing to do with my own actions? TRUST ME...... i have a ton of work I could be "catching" up on, but my employer will not allow anyone to come back to the office during this time. We are supposed to clear our heads and come back with clear minds and goals so that we can regroup and function properly as a "team" to achieve our goals.
