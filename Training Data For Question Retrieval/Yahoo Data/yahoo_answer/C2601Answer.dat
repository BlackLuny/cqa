You have only 2 choice,though. One is Take the money (1300) The other is don't take It and go to court. This is your right. I know your wanting to "Fight the Bast***s" And rightly so. Now, lets figure this out; your talking about a difference of $650.00. Say you go to court? Whats this attorney going to cost you? What about court costs? Now the biggy. What If you lose? A distinct possibility. The price they gave you is probably the Kelly Blue Book and/or the price of your car If you had to replace It. They get this figure by looking in the want ads in your general area and on the PC for your car,today. If they take 3 estimates and then divide the prices by the amount of the ads-total the prices then divide by the amount of ads. Sound good? I thought not either. But the fact is because your NOT there client they got you by the short hairs. Not pretty. Actually 2 & 1/2 years ago this happened to me. It was a low end car I used for work only. I did accept the offer having first contacted an attorney, etc. Good luck in whatever your choice is. But don't throw money at them either or rather throw your money away. Insurance companies if nothing else have batteries of attorneys on hand just for this sort of thing.You also have to consider some estimates from a few different body shops. Also, consider the price if parts. Because your vehicle is 8 or 9 years old. the assemblies can come from other then new. Its called or coded on your estimate as LKQ. Like kind and quality.

AA10207878	O how I love scouts.  You may just want to try to get a replacement.  Check AnythingScout.com.  Axle will be in the $500 range, and it is not interchangable with other vehicles because of the widths.  A '65 may have a Dana 44 in it, which is a very nice axle.  If the housing is good, put a new set of bearings and ring&pinion.  Is it the slant 4?  1965 was a transition year for the 800 series, where they moved the front frame beam forward, eliminating the Ramsey winch option. Also, this increased the length of the front engine bay allowing installation of a V-8 or straight 6.  For an extremely limited time, there was a turbo-charger available for the slant 4 152 cu. inch engine, installed by the dealer to up the horsepower to a whopping 89 HP. <br>  <br>  No axle work is cheap, and you need to make sure the person working on it knows what the hell they are doing.  The Dana 44 is a definite keeper.  If it is the older Dana 27, it is not nearly as rugged an axle as the 44.  Good luck.

Soy estudiante de ingenieria (electrica) y siempre me mandan en el laburo buscar cosas como la que vos buscas (especificaciones técnicas, costos) en internet nadie ofrece información util del todo, como la que vos buscas. sobre todo la parte de costos nadie te la quiere dar salvo que quieras pagar. Te recomiendo que para conseguir lo que queres te vallas hasta la pagina de algun fabricante aleman (BMW,MERcedes VOlSKw) o suecos(Volvo, SAAB Scania) , son los unicos que saben tratar a la gente, ahí podes encontrar especificaciones técnicas seguro. Si les mandás un mail te lo contestan ,si no son ni suecos o alemanes o quizas holandeses no te dan pelota<br>  Te recomindo una direccion (piratas/Haker ojo con los banner pornos) Para bajar libros <br>  <a href="http://rapidshare.de/files/" rel="nofollow">http://rapidshare.de/files/</a><br>  Podés bajar 1 libro, luego por 1 hora  desde esa misma IP no podés bajar más nada.<br>  Busca un libro técnico del tema , (handbook que son los libros utiles que leen los ingenieros y no las porquerias de la universidad, la escuela, o el liceo).<br>  Suerte

Si es uno de carga, debemos especificar si es un granelero, un petrolero, un containero o un frigorífico. Los dos primeros son mas lentos que los últimos dos, casi que pueden llegar a duplicar su velocidad.<br>   Así que te puedo decir que de Buenos Aires a Barcelona un barco puede estar demorando entre 2 y 3 semanas.<br>   Depende también si en el camino no hay ninguna tormenta, cosa que te puede atrasar significativamente el viaje.<br>   Los barcos de pasaje no hacen mas los viajes a Europa, así que por ahí no podemos hacer cálculos.<br>   Y una aclaración: un nudo es igual a una milla marina, que es igual a 1852 metros.

6baa978e49901f1b633d1d97d6a98568aa	If you are inexperienced I would suggest ignoring top speed for the moment. The VFR 400 might hit 130 on a good day but on UK roads I'd be VERY careful trying that.<br>  <br>  CBR600 is an excellent bike for comfort, even with a taller rider such as yourself. It'll also be a lot more reliable. <br>  <br>  The little 400 will be good at going round corners but you may get bored with the power sooner than the 600.<br>  <br>  Have fun and ride safe whatever you do!|`|aeb402d05a12cfdaa9c6483a1c4f5dbcaa	try it for yourself or buy a motorcycle mag, should tell you in there.|`|e8e37a60f89adf3e0588b1c9c0f011a8aa	Standard, about 130 (ish) and no I don't think a 6"4 person would be comfortable for any length of time on it.<br>  From personal experience a similar age CBR 600f would be a much better bet.|`|336340aa09a4c75bf04d9319650d82f5aa	hahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahaha... so funny...<br>   <br>  a VFR  4oo is a toy for girls... the VFR750 and VFR1000... arent.
AA10016294	Check the chain adjuster to make sure you rear wheel is properly aligned.  If it doesn't pull when you are going straight or under acceleration then it's probably fine, but it's worth checking.  Definitely check the tires, balance the rims, also fork oil level.<br>  Stay safe.|`|AA10408696	a bad front tire|`|6baa978e49901f1b633d1d97d6a98568aa	Sounds like the throttle cable is stuck somewhere. When the bike is parked up with the engine on try turning the bars full lock. If the revs rise its sure to be the throttle cable pulling somewhere. Check its not caught.
2c6dca00af5416fdb5b3970d9b634144aa	The rule is:  There must be three things present in order to make and engine run. 1. Compression  2. Fuel  3. Fire.  You are missing one of these.  Do a compression test, to check for bent or warped valve, blown head gasket, cracked piston, and broke ring.  Compare the reading to a known good cylinder, and it should be within a few pounds of each other.  Carb, or injected?  Dirt in carb, injector not firing, no fuel pressure on cylinder.  If you got fire, then you either have to be missing fuel, or you have a mechanical problem.  You should be able to use a pipe to listen to the injectors to hear them clicking when they fire.  If no click, replace the injector, after you make sure it is getting power on the pulse rate.  A noid light will tell you this.  I hope I have been able to help you.  Good Luck!!!|`|6baa978e49901f1b633d1d97d6a98568aa	As an aside the term "Slingshot" was given to the carburettors on the GSX-R's. It won't be injected. Other than that I'd frllow the advice of our mechanic friend if its not too technical.<br>  <br>  However, Before going for all the compression testing I'd check electricals thoroughly. I showed good spark on an RD500 but under compression it bailed out.<br>  <br>  HTH|`|14bfa5c3488c57f392e4b34421f9e6b8aa	Have you checked fuel is getting into that pot? could be fuel shortage or timing out|`|91680cd6dcecb5da5e1a404b22467457aa	If there's a good spark and fuel getting to it, I would suggest a compression check on that cylinder, as it could be a burnt out valve leading to low compression.<br>  Another possibility would be a leaking inlet manifold gasket, but this is unlikely to cause a complete loss of firing.|`|cc71251dd2b32a8d4cc1899de568581baa	swop the ht leads between 2 and 3 cylinders, is 2 now the problem? that would make it a lead problem. a plug maybe breaking down under compression( new plugs)<br>  failing that take all plugs out and do a compression test.... they should all be pretty much the same! is number 3 plug wet after a short run? if not then its fuel not getting in. remove float bowl and float and check for blockages in fuel line. you only need a bit off silicon or somthing to block it. shield and blow thro' fuel line in carbs with compressed air. if both 2 and three are a problem then it is either faulty coil, pick ups on end of crank or low tension ciscuit from pick up to coil( check resistance with ohms on multimeter.|`|db0decfd02ac588eb247f3ead60af4b0aa	there may be a mouse living in there check it out

93836810fa3cd78c753b051c8d739082aa	I have a 04 Intrepid, I blew the head gasket and it did the same thing that you just explained......  Id take it to another mechanic, cause Id say thats what it is....|`|AA10021848	Sounds to me like a timing chain tensioner losing oil pressure|`|b5420c82aba894dfe48b97ebf8b19781aa	Depends if it is a 2.7 or a 3.5 . The 3.5 is the high out-put for that model and came in the ES version, the 2.7 came in the base (most have 2.7) The 2.7 is built like an anvil and rarely had crank or head problems, what you describe could be 2 things a piston slap would blow oil into 1 cylinder and make it smoke and knock and burn oil. Pull the spark plugs one should have an excess of gummy buildup on it. the second thing you describe sounds like the fuel pump is failing in the tank, they will work intermittently before they quit.

Your warranty will be pro-rated as to the age of your battery, they will check to see if it is good or not ! If not they will allow you a small credit towards a new one. Sorry, but that is how it works !!  Good luck !|`|9ZaoTkwwaa	Can you just leave lights on?  I've heard that sometimes when your car doesn't start, it could be because lights.. So i would think that would = a dead battery.  I'd try that but i'm not 100% sure.  It has been years since i had a car that had lights that didn't automatically turn off.  This would probably work with leaving alot of things on but lights are the only thing i can thing of without leaving the car on.|`|lmSoNMhPaa	put a small amount of baking soda in one cell on the battery, it will kill the cell and will not hold a charge. but if your battery is good why do you want a new one?un hook you cables and put a couple of asprain in a cell and it will over charge it and kill the cell.|`|MGfi5tUIaa	hook it up to a battery charger backwards|`|AA11606487	sounds like fraud to me .|`|AA11970314	haha hook somthing that has a high-power need up to it or just leave your headlights on for a week and the radio while your sleeping or at work or just around the house and soon, WHA LA lol|`|SNDxHMjQaa	If the battery still works then keep it.

ysclTmCoaa	American built cars are only rated as the best by America, the rest of the world think otherwise, and rightly so.<br>  <br>  Inspect any US built car and the quality of materials used is Absolutely appalling matched only by their inability to put it together with anything like a degree of pride.|`|AA10447831	nada, toyota and honda and bmw and saab are better|`|H8XpaaPDaa	their muscle cars look nice...other than that, can't really think of anything|`|d7oxOMT6aa	The build quality of American cars is appalling. cheap, poor quality materials are used everywhere.<br>  <br>  Even non american companies building cars in the USA, like Honda and Toyota, downgrade parts for the American market, compared to european and japanese equivalent models.<br>  <br>  The Ford Focus is a good example. A very good car in europe, but shockingly poorly made in America. They have downgraded it for their own market!<br>  <br>  America has still never built a car that can corner properly. the rest of the world has known how to do that for years now. even cheap, poverty spec models have competent suspension. its not like the yanks don't have corners, so why can't they build cars that can go around them?<br>  <br>  Oh,and the Rover V8 wasn't built under licence, the rights were bought outright buy Rover, as Buick could never build them properly so they went back to cast iron blocks. Rover sorted out the aluminium casting techniques and the engine was a huge success!|`|MsivfKoAaa	Very little. Nobody seems to want them. Thats why Ford, GM and Chrysler are in trouble. Outside America their build quality and design are seen as poor.|`|Dfppbeo8aa	The best thing I can say about American made cars are they are made by American workers.|`|yeT02UVCaa	The only good thing that I can think of that came out of the American motor industry is the Buick V8 engine that was built under licence by Austin- Rover / British Leyland and was used in Rover cars, Land Rovers, TVR and Morgans.<br>  <br>  Additional.<br>  Rover may have bought the rights for the Buick V8 which was to become the Rover V8 but I'm old enough to remember that originally the engine was built under licence.|`|RLPM48F8aa	They are made for American roads for which they are perfect, but not suited to European roads.<br>  Also they are in fact very cheap over there.<br>  I hired a Buick back in 1981 & it cost the same as a Mini in England.|`|wg4XdI5taa	My opinion is just the pride of the the cars actually being american.

Plus if you live in america and you own an american car they are soo much cheaper to fix than a lot of imported cars|`|lB7uvA73aa	most cars today are about equal in reliability. american cars are built by americans so by buying an american car you are helping to give americans jobs but if you buy asian car...<br>  btw ford sells very many cars in europe and actually make a profit there|`|XkidpdPWaa	Nothing, apparently.|`|7AUqSr4uaa	i dunno where you are hearing that but its not true.<br>  German, Italian and Japanese cars are the best|`|a900a3c97144751e6e1dd7cc809d0122aa	they stay in america!!|`|D7ikv9Zaaa	None go for a BMW like me you will be vary happy you did.
tO7Rpjmqaa	A reciprocating internal combustion engine has at least one cylinder with a reciprocating piston arranged therein. Two parallel crankshafts connected by a toothing rotate in opposite direction. Each one of the pistons has first and second rigid connecting rods, wherein the first connecting rod is connected to the first crankshaft and the second connecting rod is connected to the second crankshaft. Various connecting rod arrangements are possible. In one embodiment, the connecting rods are curved toward one another and toward a center axis of the cylinder. The piston may have two connecting rod bearings spaced apart in the direction in the spacing between the crankshafts. The first connecting rod connected to the first crankshaft may be connected to a connecting rod bearing that is remote from the crankshaft, and the second connecting rod connected to the second crankshaft may be connect to the other connecting rod bearing remote from the second crankshaft. The shape of the piston may vary, for example, a disc-shaped piston bottom with a central bottom projection is provided. The projection has an end portion to which the connecting rods are connected, and a constriction is provided between the bottom and end portion. In an another design a piston with curved cross-section having a concave top side and convex bottom side is provided. The concave top side faces the combustion chamber, and the convex bottom side has the connecting rods connected thereto.|`|9TsiMhp6aa	Me sorry as i am not able to answer this question ,being little Technical.Thanks.|`|GEkLdveFaa	'

8YBiVlcTaa	Because he goes by the maxim, 'there is no such thing as bad publicity' and it works. He pulls stupid stunts and says things just to get in the papers and works time and time and time again. The press love him, and although some people wouldn't be seen dead flying with Ryanair, lots of people love a cheap ticket price despite the fact most of the airports they fly to are in the middle of nowhere and you have to pay for everything extra even the ticket itself. He once tried to have the window blinds and pockets on the backs of the seats removed to lower costs.|`|3904bf9cec60af77f3ce3e9dfcd8c007aa	He owns ryanair,|`|v6NdNE4xaa	does he not own the company i dont get what the problem is he tells it how it is they are the cheapest you pay for what you get! if you want all the trimmings go with ba and pay double generally rynair flights arent that long anyway so its not a major deal not to go to the toilet cant you use the airport toilet before you get on or would this be too much forward planning. personaly i like ryanair i can jump on a flight too dublin and have a good day out for less than a taxi cost from my house too the nearest city last time 2 of us flew from prestwick and back all in for ￡20|`|9EoV0ppmaa	Pay 2 pee hasn't been decided on yet.

He just tossed the idea out there and everyone started talking about it. He's even made the news channels in the US with this idea. <br>  <br>  The whole point was free publicity. He gets prime time exposure and doesn't have to pay a penny for it. His attitude is that even bad publicity is better than none at all. When this all dies down, you'll find that the lav policy at Ryanair will not have changed a bit. He's just coming up with this stuff for the publicity. The press and public are eating it up.|`|4sKs9blyaa	he has to die...... we all have to ....it may be soon .....it may be years
3ft5T559aa	I really wanted to like the HHR, since it was reasonably priced and could haul cargo easier than my current Pontiac Sunfire.  Unfortunately, once I test drove it, I didn't like it.  Driving in the city was OK, but driving it on the highway was scary.  I felt like I had to struggle to keep it on the road and keep up with traffic.  Chevrolet does have some nice incentives on this vehicle now, though.|`|AA11502638	Personally not my style for the money. I like the PT Cruisers more and I'm not a Dodge man. Chevy's just started a new program where you can lease a Corvette for two years for 20 grand. Then again, you have to give it back. You could always buy a Mustang GT! :-)
XBUeYE41aa	New Jersey Mopeds question awhile back had answer covering the 50cc scooters- You will need a motorcycle endorsement on your license. 50cc scooters aren't moped licensable in New Jersey so they are NOT speed restricted- 4/5 hp engines with top speeds capable of 40 to 50 mph. Yamaha ZUMA models instead of speed restricted Vinos. Honda Ruckus tuned and geared for 40+mph. You can ride on city streets and state highways -but can't get on interstates system as 50cc is still a 'motor-driven cycle'/less than 150cc'.|`|jFwuiRKxaa	And you have to be old enough to drive|`|fdIanvsUaa	you need a CBT, you need the scooter to be taxed, MOTed and insured
f0cbe2f5865becaa86d82f96e2cd91d6aa	the v-tec engine was introduced in 96 model civics so it is not. the first answer was correct on the b16,b18 question.|`|8ff73d595313dab1f967beb8b7608b1baa	Not too sure if your engine uses vtec technology but most likely it doesn't since only the higher end engines have vtec technology. The difference between the b16 and the b18 is that the b16 is a 1.6 liter engine while the b18 is a 1.8 liter engine. There are more differences but those are the main points.
MmTe8W8uaa	As far as the car insurance company, you can sue them only for those things for which you have insurance coverage, which must include liability for injuries to others and liability for property damage to the property of others and may also include damage to the vehicle, medical payments, and injuries caused by uninsured or underinsured drivers.  If you do not have insurance coverage for pain and suffering not caused by other drivers, then no.<br>  <br>  As far as the state, government is generally not liable for "failure to protect" you from things.  If the government caused or contributed to the accident, for example by putting the ditch too close to the road, then you might have a case.  However, if the only things that the government did wrong were not removing the ice and deciding (for budgetary reasons) to use a ditch instead of a drain pipe with sewer grates, then no.|`|f038db3294ca7b44e88aa5770e91bbdbaa	No automobile policy, that provides Accident Benefits coverage for injuries related to an automobile accident, provides coverage for pain and suffering. The most it will cover is, generally, medical and physical rehabilitation bills, lost wages, certain living expenses, etc. If you want money for pain and suffering then you have to sue the at-fault party, which, in this case, is: you (the state is not responsible for the weather). Last time I checked you cannot sue yourself.|`|379b18fddd29f1b64385008f275bdd61aa	Why would you want to or need to sue anyone regarding this. I expect your insurance will cover the damages and pay costs for any medical treatment. That's all you are entitled to.|`|fdIanvsUaa	you should go to a lawyer and see what they can advise you about something like this|`|JLayHNZCaa	Sure you can sue, the lawyer will be glad to file.  He will then take 33% of whatever you are entitled to.  Just take the insurance and be glad they pay even when as drivers, we make mistakes by diving too fast for the road conditions.  Good luck.|`|8GDBr2U9aa	In order to sue for personal injuries, you need to be able to prove someone caused those injuries through negligence, criminal acts (beat you with a bat, for instance). You knew the road conditions were bad, but you chose to drive anyway. That puts most of the responsibility on your shoulders. In this case, it appears you placed yourself in the situation that caused your injuries. The state isn't responsible, and your insurance company should cover your losses.
9740e5e8ead5b37471166c9abd4dfaa7aa	I will have to side on behalf of your mechanic. Whenever removing an axel (front wheel drive) it must be removed from the wheel bearing. Sometimes this putt's extra stress on an already weak bearing so when reassembled, problems occur. Without wheel bearings, your care will not move and because it is a moving part, they wear out. Just have it changed an it will last for quite a while.|`|Og3vKQeWaa	a wheel bearing is a set of ball or roller bearings, within a cage, which the axle or stub axle turns in. <br>  When they wear, you get a sort of rumbling noise which varies with speed and cornering. A clicking noise when turning, is usually a CV joint on it`s way out, with a front wheel drive car!|`|0718dad4abab8922913de42dfc359d12aa	The bungee cord couldn't hurt anything. Sounds like a CV joint to me. If its a front wheel drive car it may need replaced. It's kinda expensive $250 for the part plus labor.|`|c4c68b032b3f303e52a013f1376dc505aa	your wheel bearings are what allow the wheels to spin. you have caged roller bearings that fit over whats called a spindle. your wheel bearings are contained in your wheel hub, and your wheel fits over your wheel hub. if your bearings fail your wheels will not turn properly and could possibly cause your wheel hub to become damaged. and theres a possibility that your wheel can break off the axle because of it. it sounds like your original problem might have been a bad constant velocity joint (c-v joint) , but it also could have been bad bearings also. take your car to a reputable mechanic and get a second opinion|`|D7ikv9Zaaa	If the car was not doing the "whomp, whomp, whomp" noise when you took the car to the shop they mess it up they should fix it.  Oh they are mechanics their job is too mess your car up so you keep coming back.<br>  <br>  Sorry butt that's the way it is!!!|`|1OkhqlgIaa	Well I ride a Skate board and a skateboard bearing is the same thing as a car bearing except smaller. The car bearing helps the wheel spin on the axle. Its basically inside of the wheel and wont spin right if its not on right so instead of having the mechanic fix the rusty bearing have him check to make sure that it's on right. That causes the same sound on a board when its not properly put on. probably just something happened when he removed the wheels to fix the axle. He might be ripping you off.|`|1xkc6Ktmaa	It is what allows your tire to turn. Characteristics of a failing one could be grinding, squealing and noises in general. I wouldn't think a sound that a failing one would make would be like anything  you described unless it was creating a lot of friction messing with the differential.|`|bLjGM9yNaa	The only thing that bothers me is why the mechanic let you leave<br>     the shop with a different noise in the front end. Or did this happen<br>     down the road , after a few miles ?<br>  <br>      No, the bungee cord was not the reason, although it shouldn't have<br>      been left behind. Kind of like a doctor leaving a patient with a thermometer stuck in their #$$.. But these thing do happen.<br>  <br>      So , it sounds like you need a new wheel bearing. But for peace<br>      of mind, I would ask the mechanic , why they did not notice this<br>      during a test drive after the cv fix.  I'll bet they never did test drive<br>      it.  I hope you know your mechanic well enough to tell you the<br>      truth,  or I would be looking for a new one.<br>  <br>       Good Luck to you.

uxUvpVHqaa	I have a Honda XR250 R and the bike is bulletproof for weekend riding in the hills. It can be plated if it has the right safety equipment.  If you want a bike for dirt, use good dirt tires, if you want it for dual purpose there are tires for that also.  I would not spend an arm and a leg for a new bike if you are fairly new to dirt biking, or any biking for that matter.  There are plenty of great deals out there that will save you a lot of money, and get you a good bike. As for the headlights,  buy one with lights that work, not just for looks.  Really, how often would you be riding in the dirt at night?|`|d72a8e15b90497f4f828744386c193a2aa	Dude you have me totally puzzled here. First off it is a WR250F not R, second it is not fuel injected nor is any other 250F made, only 450F's have FI and not all of them do. Also I am totally confused by your tire remark. The WR-F has full race knobbies that are not at all suited for road use. The WR250F is an all out woods race bike, not a trail bike. The KLX250S is the bike that has dual purpose (street like) tires, not the WR. If you plan to do some road and trail riding the WR-F is not the bike for you, it is a race bike. The reason it can have tags is because in enduro and some hare scrambles races you have to either cross a road or even ride on one for a very short distance. That is the only reason it can be tagged, it is not intended for road riding. The KLX250S is a dual sport bike. It can be ridden on the road and some off road, like a dirt fire road or very open trail. It is not a real woods bike.|`|fdIanvsUaa	both bikes are good but the f-j will be faster than the carb one but thats about it there both fast as well so the klx would be the better one most likely|`|4tuyvIDRaa	All these bikes yamaha, ktm, honda etc have ONE thing in common.

Unless you saw some type of ID that he is in fact a judge, I wouldn't believe it. If he was a judge he would know that in order for him to recieve damage payments from you he would have to have a police report to prove what happened. If you want to do the right thing pay his and your damages out of your own pocket then do it. If you want to be an as*hole just act like it never happened, he can't prove a thing without a police report or witnesses. Unless he takes you to court with no witnesses and you tell the truth.<br>  <br>  I'd just go ahead and let the insurance pay for it, that's what its there for, you'll have to pay the first $500 anyway and in 3 years your rates will go back down if you ddon't hit anyone else.|`|2wIOaTzDaa	Try to deal it out of pocket, otherwise insurance rates will go up much more.

2XusVa4jaa	No. Is your Check Engine Light On? If so, have the codes pulled out of the PCM and that should point you in the right direction. You may have a restricted catalytic converter.

AA11317575	If the blend is 10% ethanol you will be fine.  Most cars made within the last 15 yrs can run on 10% ethanol with no problems.  E85 which is 85% ethanol is not recommended unless you a "flex-fuel" vehicle with is specifically set up for burning E85.  The problem with ethanol is that it destroys some seals and metal parts.  E85 vehicles have eliminated these components and replaced them with materials that are not damaged by the ethanol.<br>  <br>  The below answer says all gasoline is ethanol blended.  That is true in some states but certainly not all.  If every state in the union required that mandate, the US couldn't produce enough ethanol to meet those needs.<br>  If you don't put "heat" or gas-line antifreeze in your car in the winter you could also run into problems.  Regular gasoline doesn't keep your fuel system very clean, and alcohol can loosen up debris and build-up in your fuel system.  This can clog your fuel filter or other systems.  Regular users of "heat" don't have this problem because once a year the isopropyl alcohol cleans out the system some.  So if you have initial problems with ethanol you might need your fuel filter changed.  You shouldn't have a problem with this, however.|`|AA11633246	NOTE: All gasoline now includes Ethanol in certain percentages to make up for the MTBE that was previously used.  MTBE is (or is almost done) being phased out in favor of a more environmentally friendly alternative.  <br>  <br>  All cars are capable of running the gasolines with the 10% +/- blend, BUT only cars 2006 and newer can run E85 without any of the long term problems associated with it.|`|9504cb8ab388013c9b1ffbca1ebfb359aa	You have no choice all gasoline is ethanol blended now a days.

Gm and others make vehicles specially designed to run on E-85 which is 85% ethanol.  Most stations in the united states sell a blend of ethanol, but most are 10% or less.  Sunoco lately has been selling 15%ethanol, i would stay away from this if possible.  Some companies are selling additives nowadays to couteract the bad effects of ethanol to your car. i.e. www.wellworthproducts.com|`|oc2Acc6zaa	The easiest answer is to read your vehicle's owner's manual as it will tell you what you can use safely in your vehicle.

If the solenoid in mounted on the starter and not the firewall the wire will be a 1" long copper strap.  If the answer was no, check the small #14 wire supplying +12 volts to the solenoid coil.

zbliqvDIaa	I would go with the Mustang. The only thing is, you're not going to be able to find a 2000-2003 model within your budget, unless you buy one with a lot of problems. I would definatley go with the stang though! If I were you, I would try to get one of the older models. Not really old though. Look at like the late 80's to 90's models. The only one you need to avoid is the 95 model, it is problem prone. Also, at first you should use your money to make sure you get a good car. Worry about the aftermarket mods, once you get used to the car and everything. And if the Impala is in half decent shape, you might be able to buy it off your mom for cheap and then sell it for more, maybe make a few bucks. Use that money to mod your car instead of buying a street bike. You should probably keep the car stock until you sell the Impala (if you do*). You can probably find some cars for a reasonable price on either ebay or craigslist. But if you buy one off the internet, buy it from somewhere close to you so you can go see the car before you purchase it!|`|Pjm9pg7iaa	I have a 2006 Malibu so i vote that you take the Impala.  Then you can spend the next few years dreaming about your perfect fun car.  I owned a Mustang and it was fun.  Not much space inside, needed more work than i hoped,  not too comfortable.  Camaro's are built for speed but have reliability problems which makes them less than wonderful to own.  I later got a Mazda Miata.  At 35 mph you feel like you are at the raceway.  You are only inches off the ground and you are flying.  I only kept it for 1 year- cramped, no storage, did i say "cramped"???    <br>  THere is no dream car.  Your desires will shift every year.  Then you will fall in love and your lover will want something completely different.<br>  How did you get $7,500?  That is great that you saved that much.   Or did grandpa give it to you?

BTvlYvZKaa	Sorry- no motorcycle is "safe" to ride on.  More accidents happen on side streets and roads, then on freeways.|`|wpgRMjgraa	Life is too short so no motorcycle is safe.......|`|U24VtSlZaa	Which rattlesnakes make good pets for toddlers?|`|jYy6dDAZaa	Bikes are as safe as the rider. Any bike can get you there or let you kill yourself. Pick a bile that can be handled easily  and wear a helmet.<br>  <br>  Incidentally the freeway is 1 of the safest places to ride,everyone is going the same way.|`|H08vPJ2Maa	There are no safe motorcycles. And there is nothing to stop an idiot car driver knocking a teen off a bike in a side road.|`|nAK8bm91aa	CLEARLY PUT ?  NONE !|`|jFwuiRKxaa	 No|`|pU6AwuOZaa	I ride a motorbike and I'm sorry to say that there are none that are intrinsically safe.<br>  <br>  The only protection you have with a bike is what you are wearing. Also, the majority of accidents are collisions with other vehicles so you have very little chance.<br>  <br>  I do love my bike though and I would not put them off. It is dangerous, but as long as you are aware of the risks then you can minimise them.<br>  <br>  I would advise getting them a few lessons from a qualified riding school. There they can learn how to ride a bike safely and the instructor who would be riding with them could give them feedback about their riding and identify problem areas. I would especially advise this if they have never been driving before and have no "road sense".<br>  <br>  As for bikes, I learnt on a 125cc and that had just the right level of power. They can hit 70 though (but it is a struggle and they do not feel good at high speeds) so they need to be careful they don't go too fast. On roads and side streets cars should be going slower which will give them more time to see them.<br>  <br>  If they do venture out on the roads, ensure they wear ALL the protective gear. I have a helmet, gloves, boots, jacket and trousers (with impact protection) and I wear them every time I ride. Ensure the boys do the same. I wear them because I have come off and even at low speeds hitting tarmac or concrete will hurt.<br>  <br>  It is more the size of engine that is the problem. The style and make of bike are largely irrelevant when it comes to safety (there are no safety ratings for bikes because if you hit anything you will be flung from it). I live in the Uk and we are restricted to 125 cc until we pass our full test, where we can drive a bike with power less than 33bhp (typically a 250cc). After two years we can ride what we like. This is a lot stricter than in other parts of the world, but it seems to be a good idea as the more powerful the bike, the faster the person will go and the more acceleration they have.<br>  <br>  I am glad you asked this in the safety forum and not the motorcycle forum as there you would get people saying "if they get anything less than a 600cc bike they will be bored with it in weeks". Its better to risk boredom than death! I think a 125cc would have all the power you need for driving in side streets. If you think that is not powerful enough then go for a 250cc, but do not give them anything more powerful than that. remember that although engine sizes on bikes seem tiny, because they are so light the power to weight ratio is huge.|`|mNO21E5kaa	No motorcycle is safe for teen or adult they are great fun but very dangerous,plus how would you keep him from riding on the freeway?Give a teen an inch and they will dive a mile!

As beginning riders there are motorcycles that are better suited for their type of riding.  I recommend going to a cycle shop and asking the salesman which models are better geared for the beginner.  Also, I recommend that they take safety courses for riding safely and that they are properly licensed and insured to be on the road.|`|db3fb0709c0e414a28ec9815d6c3d12aaa	None.

mzBVR0lzaa	It may be time-consuming to figure out an electrical problem, just depending on the problem itself, the person that does the job and whether they have the correct tools to diagnose it. I would personally start with checking the battery to make sure it would hold a charge...pretty easy to do. If that's okay, check the alternator to make sure it putting out juice...also pretty easy. That would be the two places I would start with. If both of those check out okay, then you may be looking at some money to diagnose the fault.|`|PYHTML4Xaa	the problem with electrical is you could run up a 2000 dollar bill without ever figuring it out. though spot to be in.|`|bf7e5158fcc3432d92ed4db83be63d4faa	Are you for certain the battery does not have a dead cell in it?|`|AN1EpGMqaa	A common reason for this is a component drawing current when the car is not in use.Look for a light bulb in the glove box or trunk that doesn't shut off.There is a procedure to follow to find a drain involving a meter in place of the fuses.
QOqvZybJaa	To answer your question, no it is not dangerous to use the car. The only consequence other than getting stuck with a dead battery is that battery and alternator life will be shortened.<br>  <br>  One thing you can do yourself is to check to make sure there isn't a light on in the trunk, under the hood, in the glove box, dome or in the center center console.<br>  <br>  Good luck|`|AA12261615	so i take it you have had a draw check ran on it,first off you need to do the draw test and pull fuses one at a time,if that doesn't help it try disconnecting relays on it,this usually finds the problem with it,check the amount of voltage you have on the draw,and if its a heavy draw its a large object causing this,it may take some time to find it ,but it can be found though,nothing is impossible,check every fuse and every relay one at a time,with the key off,you will find it,and don't forget about the alternator wire,that can cause a bad draw also,good luck with it i hope you find it.

Before you repaint tho, how about an option?  Buy some rubbing compound from a parts house along with some good wax like Meguiars?  The rubbing compound goes on like wax but deep cleans the oxidation from your paint.  Once that is done, wax your car to protect the paint.  Total cost will equal 10-15 dollars and the results will speak for themselves.

What a repo man does is take all the information that the bank gives then including all references and personal info that they have on you. If you have moved or changed jobs it is very difficult for them to find you. But not impossible, the best way to avoid a repo is to switch cars with a friend or relative until you can catch up on the payments. If that is not possible the bank will work with you in some cases if you contact them because they only want the money. Banks are not in the car business and with today's economy they stand to loose a lot more money by doing a repo. <br>  <br>   If you do get a Rep it is not the end of the world. There are banks out there that do people with recent repose but be prepared to pay a higher interest rate for that loan. The rate will depend on how well you did on your other bills. The rate will be usually between 17.99% to 27.99%. Even on the higher interest rate you can still get a good vehicle with the current value of cars at the moment. <br>  <br>  Please use this experience as a way to not let this happen and try to make all payments on time because in the business this is considered a second chance and if you mess it up it only makes life more difficult. Good Luck.  |`|Ww2dxIyEaa	they are given all the info that you put on your loan application. They can also cruise the internet and find out some info there.

So if you are going to reupholster it and change the top, you want to pick materials that look right for the age of the carriage. If it is real old, say of wicker, you could even add lace trimming and it would fit the style. <br>  If it's a newer one, then about any fabric selection will be  OK. For padding, just match up what might be inside the envelope with what they have at the local fabric store. You may have to double it over to get the right thickness. <br>  Good Luck!

Red diesel is used as farm diesel and may not be as pure or filtered as highway diesel.  So be aware that it may clog your filters and ultimately your injectors.  That may be more costly than the "free" diesel.  Also, though very little chance of being caught with a car, if you was caught with red diesel you would be heavily fined.

It is used to transfer force under pressure from where it is created through hydraulic lines to the braking mechanism near the wheels.<br>  <br>  Hydraulic fluids, also called hydraulic liquids, are a large group of liquids used as the motive medium in hydraulic machinery. Liquid types include synthetic compounds, mineral oil, water, and water-based mixtures. The fluids — with which are meant liquids in the context of hydraulic machinery — are found in machinery and equipment ranging from brakes, power steering systems, and transmissions to backhoes, excavators, garbage trucks and industrial shredders. Hydraulic systems are very common in aircraft flight control systems.|`|b8208188f0ca135b5b995487a583c91eaa	i wouldnt recommend putting powersteering fluid in the brakes you might not stop also brake fluid in your power steering resrvoir you might not be able to steer very well|`|KuWLNfYbaa	They are both hydraulic fluids with chemicals added to suit their purpose and the type of rubber involved.Brake fluid is hydroscopic--it absorbs water to prevent corrosion of the braking systems inner components.It has a high boiling point and a low freezing point.Power steering fluid doesn't need these characteristics so much as the heat isn't generated like in a braking system|`|5xxuKzXPaa	one will allow the brakes to work and the other will cause a systemic failure due to swollen seals. brake fluid is actually an alcohol, where as power steering fluid for the most part is very close to automatic transmission fluid unless you drive a honda.

43DHFQnKaa	basically the increase in HP provided by forced induction can be calculated by a formula based on:<br>  <br>  .extent of forced induction provided by the the supercharger or turbcharger installation (referred to commonly as boost) & measured in p.s.i.<br>  <br>  .underlying hp rating of the engine<br>  <br>  .the constant in the formula is atmospheric pressure  (aka bar = 14.7)<br>  <br>  so for example if your turbo installation can generate 10 p.s.i (10 lbs boost) it will increase the rated HP of the engine by<br>  (10 divided by 14.7)  68%.<br>  <br>  that is HP at the crank (not at the wheels).<br>  <br>  therefore if your car is presently capeable of 300 hp,  a relatively mild boost installation of 7 p.s.i  would provide a power gain of approx 47% (7 divided by 14.7) or 140HP at the crank.<br>  <br>  it is important in all of this to understand that forced induction creates a tremendous amount of heat (engine stress),  higher the boost - more the heat/stress,  so an engine to withstand high levels of boost besides being modified has to be built out:<br>  <br>  -stroker kit for the bottom end (forged rods, crank, rod bearings, pistons and performance rings<br>  -top end,  race heads,  possibly improved cams, injectors, fuel rails<br>  <br>  -engine management system has to be tuned to function with new levels of air & fuel delivery<br>  <br>  cooling is dealt with by :<br>  -intercooler installation<br>  -necessity to run high octane gas (not for power,  high octane fights heat by preventing pre -ignition.  in a normal engine pre ignition causes "knocking" ,  but in a performance engine pre ignition can likely cause engine damage - burnt piston and valve).<br>  <br>  with forced induction extreme numbers are possible out of built up small blocks.<br>  a subaru WRX sti,  can be taken up to more than 550 HP at the wheels (means likely 600 HP at the crank),  small block mustang 4.6l is now being taken to over 1000HP (approx 300% over stock).<br>  <br>  for specific turbo (turbine) information you can dial up the websites of best name turbo manufacturers - like garrett  or turbonetics to understand what turbocharger would be best suited for your installation.<br>  the turbo installation itself is fairly basic (only expensive),  and universal fit key components (turbocharger, BOV, wastegate) are all available,  other piping, plumbing, linkages are relatively easily fabricated (only money).<br>  <br>  the above is all very general because i have no idea of your engine,  its capeabilities, underlying issues (compression ratio for example - which for a turb install should be relatively low).<br>  <br>  cheers 04 cobra,  built out,  supercharged-whipple blower at 15 p.s.i.,  measured on a dyno at 575 rwHP

0me6vDF3aa	Why not just match the tires you have right now if they are original equipment.  I have had several new Toyotas and I have never had any problems with the tires that came with the car.  <br>  <br>  I do rotate my tires often including the spare and I always get up into the 45,000 - 60,000 miles on my tires.  When I get rid of my tires the center tread would probably still pass inspection but I want more traction in snow.<br>  <br>  These original tires do wear down and sometimes I will buy two and put them in the best place and run down the other tires until they are not safe.   Experts claim it is best to put 4 of the same type new tire on your car.<br>  <br>  Where I live we have snow every winter so a good all purpose mud and snow tire (M&S) is what is normal on our cars.  <br>  <br>  Now do you intend to take off like a rabbit every chance you can burning rubber and wait until the last minute to cram to a screeching stop - if so then you may go through tires a little faster.

oCvxEA2oaa	There is no reason you cant change to a different type of tire.  Just make sure you keep the same size that was originally on. Changing the tire size may affect the ABS system, the 4x4 system, and may throw off your speedometer.

xVNatAY5aa	First, THINK SAFETY, loosen the wheel nuts, put wedges front and back of the front N/S+OFFS put in Ist gear, Jack up the rear of the van & place axle stands forward of the road wheels & forward of the Springs, place a Scaffold board across from the Rear N/S To the OFF/S, get enough height for you to remove the road wheels, There are 4 bolts & nuts on the prop rear end,Tie up the prop & remove them, Undo the shocks, N/S + OFF /S, Put a Good Trolley Jack under the Diff & raise, where the spring hangers are on the N/S + OFF/S  clean & loosen the nuts & drive the pins out, but be very careful you do not damage the thread, when they are out Lower the Axel & reove from the rear of the van.|`|KuWLNfYbaa	To recondition the axle it is better to remove it from the vehicle.Undo the prop shaft,undo the rear spring u bolts and shock absorbers,undo brake pipe from flexible hose and remove from vehicle.Then remove both axle half shafts,undo pinion shaft bearing bolt and differential case housing bolts and remove housing .Then strip planetary gears and crown wheel and pinion.There are shims on the planetary gears and on the pinion and you need to measure accurately when reassembling the meshing of the gears otherwise it will be noisy and seize up in no time--best of luck rather you than me

213f725a793437432aac3cd6e080d27caa	IF you are going to put the car in your Dad's name, then he will have to be the one signing the papers. As far as insurance, you will still be listed as a driver so you will have to pay one way or another. Good luck.|`|3MTYGEbWaa	No. And it won't save you on insurance, since your dad would have to list you as the primary driver, regardless of who owns the car. If you think you can trick the insurance company, think again.|`|AA10191024	NOPE. He has to be there to sign the paperwork.<br>  <br>  Incidentally, I used to carry my daughter on MY ins policy, until she got into an accident, and even though I wasn't in the car or even in the same county when it happened, the resulting lawsuit had MY name on it too, and MY ins rates went up.<br>  <br>  She has her OWN policy now.
vQANppluaa	it cant be done.   you can only wire your subs at 4 ohms or 1 ohm.   so if you havent bought an amp yet make sure you get a nice mono block 1 ohm stable amp.|`|gstBWswfaa	u cannot<br>  your wiring options for 2 dvc 4 ohm subs are<br>  4 ohms and 1 ohm|`|AA10323599	you can always connect a higher ohm speaker to a lower ohm output and not vice versa. I guess you are fine here.
8fN13NQJaa	Almost sounds like it could be a computer issue. And hooking up cables wrong could very well cause this. If car is under factory warranty you might want to take it in.But if you mention the jump start mis-hap Im quite sure they wont cover it<br>  <br>  do what maj said and unhook battery for a while if your lucky it might reset computer.Good luck|`|lmSoNMhPaa	try disconnecting the battery for a hour or so and it might reset your computer on your car. your lucky that it did not blow up in your face and burn the car to the ground,i`m not trying to be mean i just letting you know how lucky you are.|`|51d9e39c71aaaed7424c9ac49e9069c5aa	Somehow, I suspect the battery terminal last connected will tell on you as far as what happened.<br>  Hopefully, you've fried a fuse link, a maxi-fuse or some other fuse. Check all of the above.|`|s3E3KfBsaa	It is not the battery. You probably messed up a computer or part of the electrical system, that is why the car is not running right. I doubt the warranty would cover it if you told them what you did. Take it in and tell them you have no idea what happened and you will be better off.
BGPa2DqYaa	The usual time span in almost all states is 45 days. They are set to arrive at your last known address 45 days before yours expires. You appear to have ample time. Its figured that If you get it and immediately mail it back to renew you will get It (The renewal) In more then enough time. You didn't move did you? If so, unless you told both the DMV AND the reg. department of the change,chances are you won't get It. Most times people change there address on there drivers license figuring that this will cover both, No way. They are actually 2 different entities.They have to be addressed in 2 separate operations.. In this state I see It happen all to often. Unfortunately the States DO NOT tell you this. Everyone concentrates on the drivers license only. So, good luck.Also, Not related to any Cut Backs. this has been going on for years.|`|17236f2a8f333b3a2a3252e2a5c82aabaa	California usually sends out the renewal notices 2 months in advance. If you don't get it by the end of the month call or go to a DMV office and inquire. DON'T wait until it expires to avoid extra fees.  <br>  <br>  Yes, the budget cutbacks are partly responsible. DMV employees must take off one or two days a month which will increase their workload on the days they do work.<br>  <br>  I had the same problem a few years ago. Unfortunately my registration had already expired. I was lucky to have been served by an understanding DMV clerk that waived the late fees because the delay was the DMV's fault.
fFrdimDBaa	You didn't mention the year so I assuming it's at least a 1982 or later model. Here's the kelley blue book value of a 1982 in good condition.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.kbb.com/motorcycle/retail/1982/honda/vf750c-magna-v45/69210" rel="nofollow">http://www.kbb.com/motorcycle/retail/198...</a><br>  <br>  You also mentioned it has hardly been ridden. Make sure the carbs aren't gummed up and all the seals don't leak. <br>  <br>  If it starts and runs good then go for it. They're great bikes and are very fast.
Sf42uFB6aa	It depends if your subs are rated at 600 watts RMS or 600 watts MAX. You want an amp that matches you subs RMS power as closely as possible for best sound and sub life. So if your subs are rated at 600 watts RMS you would need a amp that puts out close to 600 watts RMS per channel. As for the amp you could either use a 2 channel amp or a mono channel amp and wire the subs in Parallel|`|RiQA4Epraa	obviously need a 1200 watt amp<br>  <br>  depends if were talking rms power or max watts power<br>  <br>  and either mono or 2 channel|`|AA10323599	if these are powered subs you do not need an amp at all just connect to your receiver's sub pre-outs... one to each pre-out.<br>  <br>  if these are not powered you need an amp with the total output equal (or slightly more or less) than the power rating of your speakers (rms or pmpo). You need to connect each sub to a differnent channel, so in your case 2 channel output is a necessity. there are cases where you can connect subs in series but there could be other considerations... so try and avoid this.|`|ie4sXMrmaa	how many watts do the subs run rms or continous
tUiLuRMHaa	try turning the handelbars left in to the stearing lock position when you turn the key if not the did you do it yourself and are all wires connect properly none touching ?|`|3qenINMHaa	got an electric drill with a wire wheel ?buff the edges of the key to take off any burrs,or take it back to where you had it cut.you could also gently do it with a small file or sandpaper.<br>  let me know if it worked.

qeoVhRONaa	It depends on where you are. Most range somewhere between 55mph and 70mph.|`|aDCDwyieaa	Normally it's 65mph on most highways.<br>  <br>  But highways don't really have a set number.  You are suppose to go with the flow of traffic.  If you're going the speed limit and EVERYONE is passing you going around 75-80mph, the cop will pull you over for going too slow.|`|lCQaT4Vpaa	well it depends but usually its 70 mph

They have a number of good dealerships all over the continent.|`|420WrT5uaa	id say VW . benz is good but expensive to maintain.<br>  <br>  check google for locations
gniDPosZaa	Your fuel in the carb may have turned south. Drain your tank (if you haven't already) and the bowl on your carb and replace the fuel with new. To drain you carb find the very bottom of the bowl and locate the screw on it, turn it counter clockwise (be sure you have the fuel petcock OFF on the tank first!) and let the carb empty itself. Tighten the drain screw, turn on the gas, wait about 60 seconds then go thru your cold start routine.<br>   Since it was just one winter the carb should be fine, you might run a couple tablespoons of fuel injection cleaner thru one tank of gas if it acts wonky. Goodluck.|`|AKl3Twuuaa	Type in The Milk Barn on your search bar,  then ask your question. The people there are very knowledgeable, and also very helpful.

BUPiXrxVaa	Because they are single wheel applications. The wheel is made to fit over the brake drum and keep the tire under the vehicle instead of sticking out past the fender. If you look at the back wheels on a truck, you will notice that the inside wheel(s) is mounted the same as the steering axle wheel. The inside wheel fits over the brake drum and the outside wheel is reversed so that it will fit on the truck. So actually it is the rear wheel that is flipped.|`|ZzXK3nAAaa	Those are called Budd wheels. The offset increases the width of the front track for handling stability.
