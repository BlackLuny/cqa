20080109084342AA5EcRN	Entertainment & Music;Polls & Surveys	Women, would you go out with a guy that refused to wear pants casually?	I mean, instead of pants he'll wear kilts and kimonos. He looks 'good' in them, but it's really different. He's 27, and a really nice guy.  He says a real man doesn't give a *bleep* about what other men think of their choice in style... Which I take to mean it might matter a little what a woman might think.

I read a survey done with teenage girls and sexualised jobs seem to be perfect fulfilment. Does anyone know why this is? I admire old school sex symbols like Marilyn Monroe and Marlene Dietrich because they seemed to be in charge and still retain dignity. A lot of Page 3 trendy idols like Jodie Marsh and Katie Price seem to degrade themselves and don't have the pro sex feminist factor a lot of old school ladies had.     If you idolise page 3 girls, what do you find good in them?

Resulta que el a?o pasado  se decidió a declararse y yo le contesté lo típico, que lo veía solo como a un amigo. Pero el problema es que ahora eso ha cambiado. él y yo nos llevamos super bien, somos super amigos y eso yo creo que incluso empeora las cosas. A mi me ha empezado a gustar pero él e ha echado novia. Y además no puedo hablar con mis amigos/as porque nos movemos en la misma pandilla y no quiero comprometer más la situación y tampoco quiero que él se sienta incómodo, porque él en su momento consiguió no molestarme y que todo siguiera igual. ?Creeis que debo contarselo a él, o simplemente debo callarme y quedármelo para mi? Lo que me da miedo es que siga con la novia y al final se enamore de ella de verdad y yo ya no pueda hacer nada para hacerle cambiar de opinión. POR FAVOR, AYUDA ='(

20081007151643AAhqFDD	Entertainment & Music;Celebrities	What Does Everybody Think About Kurt's Ashes Being Smoked?	On the 11th of October this year, artitst Natascha Stellmach plans to smoke the ashes of the legendary Kurt Cobain as part of an art exhibition. Full story here:  http://www.nme.com/news/nirvana/40130        What does everybody think of this? I myself have mixed feelings about it, although she's doing this in the best of intentions and with the idea of setting him free in her mind. But it just doesn't seem like the right thing to do with them, although it does seem a perfectably suitable homage to him and a fine way to dispose (for lack of a better word) of the ashes it still just dosn't feel right to me.       Then there's the matter of how this woman got them, which nobody seems to really know.       Though I have to say I do think that the ashes are better smoked than in the hands of Courtney!      So anyway that's a rough summary of my thoughts on it, what do you guys think?

20081122012602AAj9p5y	Entertainment & Music;Celebrities	Lindsay Lohan- What do you Think?	A 22-year-old lesbian with a gay past which probably started when she was age 14 or 15 is treated like royalty around the world.  And she is treated like royalty because and not in spite of being a lesbian and living openly with a butch lover.      Now I don`t give a damn what people do but to make a cult out of Lohan merely because of it really, really stinks it up.      When you consider the real geniuses of passion who barely get a look-in (Van Gough for one) you realize what a sleazy, contemptible society we live in.      I was at the Winter Wonderland event the other night- on press night and as I stood outside with the photographers I was able to reflect upon who was photo-worthy.  The dregs believe me.  The dregs.  Using their kids for photo purposes.  Posing and I mean posing for photos.      Forty years ago Britain extolled well  maybe not the Van Goghs but certainly people of elegance and substance.      Today, in a sort of tribute to Hitler, we extoll scum.

(Este é um Enigma, você sabe a resposta)???	.      é noite, um homem deseja ir da cidade A para a cidade B e o único meio de travessia é uma ponte, e o tempo para atravessá-la é de 10 minutos.   No meio da ponte há um guarda que passa 5 minutos dormindo e 5 acordado. Esse guarda rigoroso, sempre que vê alguém atravessando a ponte, em qualquer ponto, manda-o voltar, pois é proibida a travessia a noite.   Como o homem faz para atravessar a ponte e chegar na cidade B?       .

20070407000249AAvP55s	Entertainment & Music;Jokes & Riddles	*** Il PONTE di PASQUA ......................?	Due amici, Alex e Max, devono raggiungere le rispettive fidanzate (partite prima) all'hotel per il lungo ponte di Pasqua. Per essere più liberi decidono di andare con due macchine.       Alex e Max partono nello stesso momento, dalla stessa città e vanno verso lo stesso paesino sulla costa, in direzione dello stesso hotel, ognuno con la propria automobile.      Alex e Max percorrono la stessa strada e guidanno tutti e due alla stessa velocità SENZA fare soste o tappe intermedie.      Nonostante questi dati, sappiate che Alex arriva qualche minuto prima di Max.            SUGGERIMENTI:  a) Le città di arrivo e partenza NON contano. b) le loro auto sono uguali e hanno stesse prestazioni. c) Le auto funzionano benissimo e non hanno guasti o forature. d) Hanno fatto il pieno tutti e due 5) Non hanno trovato incidenti o blocchi stradali 6) tutti e due conoscono bene la strada da fare 7) Non hanno fatto scommesse a chi arrivo primo e ad Alex non importa essere arrivato 1°.

Trocou dez mil dólares por   fichas e dirigiu-se à mesa da roleta. Lá chegando, anunciou que apostaria   todo o seu dinheiro e que acertaria os números em um único lance. E,   fitando os dois empregados responsáveis pela roleta acrescentou:   - Olha, espero que vocês n?o se importem, mas tenho mais sorte quando estou   toda nua...   Dito isto, ela se despiu completamente, e depois colocou as fichas todas   sobre a mesa. Inteiramente abestalhado, o "croupier" acionou a roleta.   Enquanto esta girava, a loira cantava:   - M?EZINHA PRECISA DE ROUPAS NOVAS! M?EZINHA PRECISA DE ROUPAS NOVAS!...      Assim que a roleta parou, ela come?ou a dar grandes pulos e a gritar:      - GANHEI!!! GANHEI!!! QUE MARAVIIIIILHAAA!!! GANHEEEI!!!   Ela ent?o abra?ou e beijou cada um dos croupiers. Em seguida debru?ou-se   sobre a mesa e recolheu todo o dinheiro e as fichas.   Vestiu-se rapidamente e se mandou. Os croupiers se entreolharam   boquiabertos .      Finalmente, um deles,voltando a si, perguntou:   - Em que numero ela apostou, você viu?   E o outro:   Eu n?o.. Pensei que VOCê estivesse olhando...

20090205174555AAgAJ5D	Entertainment & Music;Music;Rock and Pop	Why do 13 year old girls love Fall Out Boy?	It just seems odd that so many of their fans are 11-14 year old girls because they are a rock band. Usually, that age group listens to bubblegum pop. When I was 13, I listened to New Kids On The Block. When my younger sister was 13, she listened to Hanson. When my younger cousin was 13, she listened to Backstreet Boys. Why are today's 13 year old girls listening to rock instead of bubblegum all of a sudden? Are they finally realizing how cheesy bubblegum pop is?

20090205163104AA4gaLT	Entertainment & Music;Jokes & Riddles	Joke: The Night watchman....this is funny but true?	Once upon a time the government with Ruling Party XYZ.. had a vast scrap yard in the middle of a desert. Ruling Party XYZ Said..   - "Someone may steal from it at night."        So they created a night watchman position and hired a person for the job. Then Ruling Party XYZ Said..   - "How does the watchman do his job without instruction?"        So they created a planning department and hired two people, one person to write the instructions, and one person to do time studies. Then Ruling Party XYZ Said..    - "How will we know the night watchman is doing the tasks correctly?"        So they created a Quality Control department and hired two people. One to do the studies and one to write the reports. Then Ruling Party XYZ Said.. ,    - "How are these people going to get paid?"        So they created the following positions, a time keeper, and a payroll officer, then hired two people. Then Ruling Party XYZ Said..,    - "Who will be accountable for all of these people?"        So they created an administrative section and hired three people, an Administrative Officer, Assistant Administrative Officer, and a Legal Secretary. Then Ruling Party XYZ Said..   - "We have had this command in operation for one year and we are $18,000 over budget, we must cutback overall cost."           So they lay off the Night watchman.

To this day, he'll listen to Aaliyah's music before he will listen to Beyonce's "mess" (as he calls it).      Honestly, she's one deceased celeb that I think about on a regular basis as well. She was down to Earth and made great songs without going overboard..unlike Beyonce'.      Anyway, I've seen stuff on the web that said she died of traumatic shock and suffered from severe burns and a blow to the head.       Traumatic shock leads to a weak heart, right? So...does that mean that she suffered from such a state of shock that she died instantly and didn't actually have to feel the suffering of burning?

But nothing too dark like death note (i watched the anime, i loved it but hated it at the same time, and i prefer other anime better)      also please no mecha manga like gudum, i just don't like it for some reason, not my type.      anime i am watching right now is...      bleach,   naruto,   rurouni kenshin      please do not ask me to read any bleach or naruto b/c i already have the manga      so if anyone has any ideas on what i should read please tell me!      thx :)!!!

He wants to meet, I do too, But, I hate myself for being so fat (288lb) and it's stopping me living.''      Now I met him, he said he loves me, and help me, we even talked about sex, I asked him if he would wait, he said he'd wait as long as I want      He was perfect, and much better looking than I expected, My question is, what if he's doing all this out of pity? should I break up with him and say I need to concentrate on getting my life back together?      I'm a Capricorn

Then recently one of his friends was flirting with me hardcore and he saw it.. and i act. enjoyed it/him      Then he asked me if wanted to study on a Sat and I hesistated bc he is pissing me off. Then without waiting any longer for my response, turned to the girl to the right and asked her if she wanted to study. Ive noticed he flirts w this girl in a way or gives her attention or asks her questions about things before he would me.. but i swear it feels like he is trying to act like he doesnt like me and or is attempting tomake me jealous subconsciously.. or perhaps consciously. Anyway.. she isnt attractive and she has a bf and i dont think he really likes her.      What should i do about the situation and the study session

At school we are doing a service project where we are using the computers to make podcasts of books for illiterate children to teach them how to read. I chose Where the Wild Things are. We are allowed to bring in music from home to put in the podcast-as long as it is something that NO one could possibly be offended by if their pre-schoolers heard it. I am looking for a good party song that is clean and appropriate. (we have the copy-right thing figured out. don't worry, we're not stealing). I have some good ones, but, well, they aren't pre school material. This is to represent the scene in Where the Wild Things Are where they are all having fun partying. Also, I want the music to be good- nothing too babyish, something that sounds good but is appropriate. Just write the name and artist of the song and I will find it.      Thanks!

I just wanted some feedback to make my list as great as possible. Thanks! This will hopefully be a big year for billie, tre, and mike.      Top 20 Green Day Songs      1. Boulevard of Broken Dreams   Ballad of the ages. Steady, powerful, beat with amazing repeating guitar riffs in entirety of song.        2. Holiday   Amazing powerful message to the world. Guitar blazing with upbeat tempo and a capella madness. Message to everyone: get off your butt and go on Holiday!      3. American Idiot   Upbeat, fast pace, powerful message to a nation that explains just what was going on at the time.       4. When I Come Around   Great vocals with great tempo and easy going.       5. Good Riddance (Time of Your Life)   Soft and soothing. Very different but very, very, amazing.      6. Christie Road   Great guitar with great vocals and up beat song.      7. Wake Me Up When September Ends   Very, very, different from regular Green Day which makes this one so great. Great ballad with amazing transition of guitar, feeling, and memories.      8. Give Me Novacaine   Attempting to put all the pains away with calm and hard sounds. What all people want in life.      9. Waiting   Regular amazing Green Day. Guitar complements drum/vocals and vice versa.      10. Working Class Hero   Steady, slow, and one of the best covers of Green Day. It’s something we all want to be.      11. Jesus of Suburbia   9 minutes and 8 seconds of amazing transition, plot, and constant variation.      12. Basket Case   Classic, regular, Green Day with crazy guitar and vocals to hit hard punk rock in an insane kind of way.      13. Only of You   Best of the very first album. Comfortable vocals complement guitar riffs and drums.      14. Warning   Amazing flow of the guitar with the vocals as you find yourself getting sucked along. A foot tapper kind of song.            15. Brain Stew   Awesome guitar riffs with vocals as you find yourself nodding off to be hit with each guitar strum. Try to get more sleep with this song.      16. I Fought the Law   Upbeat and flowing single with a sense of true truth in life today.      17. St. Jimmy   Fast pace, firing guitar, screaming vocals and rocket roller coaster Jim: don’t mess with him.      18. Are We the Waiting   Amazing drum leads this one with the muffled vocals leading up to Jimmy.      19. Letterbomb   Amazing music. Guitar leads out the coolest melody with the vocals screaming the pain of breaking up.      20. Whatsername   Constant strumming, complementing the whole album. Sorrows cannot overcome and memories live forever.

Just found a site predicting when Jade will die and I am really appauled by what I read. All for the promise of a phone? People are so shallow.    Its all based on the 'racist' comments that she supposedly made. Anyone with a brain themselves would realise it was never meant maliciously but simply that she isnt that intelligent without being horrible, peoples intelligences vary but this is no reason to wish cancer and death on a mother of two. People also argue she is milking the media attention, i've just turned twenty and her situation has made me make sure I go for my smear test and im sure im not the only one so good has come of it? Also being a celebrity is her job in a sense so she needs interviews for income? its nobodys business, if they dont like her dont read the magazines dedicated to celebs!!! idiots.   anyway, I hope you survive Jade, ive seen the disturbing effects of cancer on a loved one and feel so terribly sorry for herself and her family!!
