20090226155850AAxMI4Q	Cars & Transportation;Car Makes;Honda	Transponder keys: anyone know any shortcuts?	Kay, I bought my 98 Honda Accord used and got one key with it.  I needed another one for backup, so I bought an exact duplicate online and had it cut.  Even though the dealership told me It'd cost $100 to program it to work on my door locks and my ignition, I got it to work on my doors.  It works perfectly fine.  It doesnt start the car however. Is there any other person I can take it to to have it programmed, or are there any shortcuts to program it myself to avoid the hefty dealer fees?

20090226160349AAHDwOY	Cars & Transportation;Car Makes;Dodge	99 Dodge Ram 2500 Pickup Transmission problems?	I have a 99 Dodge Ram 2500 Pickup with an automatic Trans. I had the transmission rebuilt at a local trasmission shop and the problem keeps coming back. I am taking it back for the third time and am just wondering if anybody might know what the problem is because I have lost comficonfidence in them and might end up doing it myself. When I start to move from a complete stop it acts as if it is starting in a higher gear, much like driving a manual and starting it third gear. However if i drop it into first on the steering column it takes off fine, and the problem seems to go away after it is drivin awhile. I am very familiar with fixing engines, but have always had someone work on the tranny, but i think I will need to do it myself this time around.

I've found the Moog brand, which i've found out thru research is the better brand. The other brand is Master Pro...which is cheaper. But the Moog brand includes "front suspension." I'm trying to figure out, what is front suspension???? Does it matter??? I see that they come in a boxed set of two...will I need both put on or can i use one for each front wheel? I was told that it was better to do both. I'm tryin to figure out does 2 go on each wheel or not. Be gentle w/ ur answers. I'ma chick and I have never had any ball joint probs or know anyone who has...so ignore my not having any ball joint knowledge. Oh and do u need any special tools to perform this procedure? My mom's boyfriend told me he could do it and i'm tryin to figure out if he's lying or not.

I am looking to buy a new/newish car (2007-2009) and I am wondering what some good cars would be to consider. My main concerns are reliability and gas mileage, although I would like a car with substantial power. I'm also worried that it is a waste to purchase a new car because of the drastic drop in value after you drive off the lot, is it better to buy a car a few years older with still some warranty left? I am considering the Corolla, Civic, Jetta (City) and Focus. Thank you.

This auto place is a national company and when I called today the associate said he'll talk to the technician who did the work tomorrow morning. I plan on taking it over tomorrow to get this resolved! My question is should I ask for some sort of a refund? If I didn't check, I never would have known! Also, I just purchased a thermostat, should I ask them to install that at no charge for the inconvenience? How would I word this? Thanks in advance!

My credit score is right below adequate and was told I need a cosigner. I recently have had a big promotion and make well more than enough to pay for the car but my credit score is not so hot. They told me that my mother could co sign. My mother was told at another dealership that if she cosigned for me that she would have slim chances to get a loan herself. She has had 2 new cars within the last 8 years that have been paid on time and told her that they are taking advantage of her to jack up interest rates. Is this really true and could you link to something I can print out to give to her? Thanks guys!      So does her cosigning for my car reflect her ability to get a loan?

Since October of 2008, I have had to have quite a bit of work done (about $1100)      I took my car for an alignment to Jack Williams Auto Care, and the guy told me that I need about $900 worth the work done. I couldn't believe it! It was for the same problem I took it to them before in October (I spent $800 of the $1100 there for them to fix it)      So I'm thinking he's just trying to take me for all I am worth again and the problem won't be fixed. I am getting a second and third opinion this friday.       But if I do need this work, should I pay for it? Or just consider a new car? I really can't afford another one, but I can't afford these repairs either. Is there a limit I should be willing to put out (like no more than $500)???      Thanks!

20090225121507AAif4lf	Cars & Transportation;Buying & Selling	Friend defaulted on car loan, agreed to voluntary repossession with finance co., but car was never picked up?	This is a perfectly good vehicle less than two years old and just sitting parked.  It's been over a year since they've defaulted on their payments and over a year since they agreed to let it go back to the finance company, but no one has ever shown up to pick it up.  We could use a 2nd vehicle and would be interested in this one.  Our friends have no interest in the car whatsoever and just want to wash their hands of i. They don't care if we want to just start driving it.   But I'm not comfortable doing that, for many obvious reasons.  I understand it wouldn't be a good idea for us to buy a license sticker, insurance, etc.,  and just start driving it the way things stand right now.   I don't want to be caught up in the middle of anything illegal or dishonest or anything like that.  Is there any chance, if we contacted the finance company and offered them a small amount of money, that they would surrender the vehicle to us?  Or would that just light a fire under them to come repossess the car and take it away for good?  I just hate to see a perfectly good vehicle rotting away that no one is even paying for, especially when our family could really use a 2nd vehicle right now.  Any advice or suggestions?

20090226173541AAlyuQk	Cars & Transportation;Maintenance & Repairs	What should the timing be on a 350 Chevy engine ... (please read details first before answering)?	I took a 350 engine out of a 1993 Chevrolet truck. It originally came with a throttle body injection and was computer controlled. I took a 70's model intake and with a  modification to the two center bolt holes on both sides ... I mounted it to the 93 block and mounted a Quadrajet carburetor on it.      I'm not sure what the timing is originally suppose to be with the TBI because I don't have the original truck body any more. I believe the timing may have been 4 degrees BTDC. Most of the late 80 models were 4 BTDC according to Chilton but my Chilton doesn't cover anything later than 1990.      Since I am not using a computer and I am using the HEI distributor with vacuum advance then what would be the ideal timing for that engine? Would 10 BTDC or 12 BTDC be about right or would 8 BTDC be better?      I do plan on experimenting with the vacuum advance using a vacuum advance curb kit. I just need to know where is the best place to start as far as timing the engine goes?

Heres what im looking for   -lets just say up to $28-30,000 for now   -2 door, dad doesn't want me driving friends around (which is illegal to drive anyone around if they are under the age of 21 until you are 17 too i think)   -Fair to good gas mileage   -Nice looking (dont want to look like a dork :P)   -The smaller the car, the better. But feel free to post bigger cars      So what i have in mind so far is an 09 Nissan altima coupe (which i think i managed to convince my dad to think about it) and also i showed him the 2010 Genesis Coupe (which is the same price)

I am not gonna order it online unless its a hard case because its too dang hard. The place where I got my windows tinted refused to doing it as well, saying they dont attach stuff purchased online. So can anyone help me out? Thanks

The person doing the work suspects a cracked block.      1.  Should we have known that before machining the head?      2.  What option is best at this point and are these good prices (includes work done to this point)?  His suggestions are:      -Short block for $3500 (saving my newly machined head) and a 6 mo warranty   -Long block for $4000 and an 18 mo warranty   -Brand new for $5000 (or more)   -Sell the boat as is for???
