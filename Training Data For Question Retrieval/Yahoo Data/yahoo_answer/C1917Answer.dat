The previous version used to load in about 10-15 seconds. This version is taking nearly 2 minutes. Once it has loaded, though, I don't have any problems with it. But if you do want to install another browser, Mozilla Firefox is probably the best, much more secure and versatile than Explorer. Also worth considering are Google Chrome (still in it's early days but very fast) or Opera (again, quicker and more stable than Explorer).|`|KpoR3MiQaa	The 'new' one that you downloaded may be the beta (incomplete) version which is unfortuantely not very stable    Try firefox or google chrome|`|WeZcSZvKaa	If you had read the notes before you downloaded it would have told you that it is a Beta version for webmasters, programmers and designers to test and play around with.    It is not the fully finished program that's why you are having problems with it.    Go into Add & Remove, find it and click on Remove. That will take it back to IE 7.|`|f7jICJo2aa	Try Firefox or Opera ..    www.mozilla.com/firefox/  www.opera.com/|`|IqkxbmI4aa	use firefox browser its the best or you can also try google chrome...

But it wont get rid of virus problems. And re-installing an OS sucks!    Heres my suggestion... Ive had to do this b4 and it worked. It takes some time, but worth it.    You have 1 or more virus or malicious files in your System 32 folder. Heres how to find them... Or rather, how I did it...    Go to http://www.prevx.com/freescan.asp  It will download a scan, but its safe and will also protect you in the future. Click download free scan and so on. Run that scan. It will find the corrupted file(s) on your computer, particularly in system 32, where they like to hide, and will display a list of them. Now you can either buy the csi cleaner... OR...    Do this for free...    Write down all the file directories that csi gave you. The should say something like, C:\ProgramFiles\System32\  and so on. Download a program, Move On Boot. You can Google "Move On Boot download" or here is a link from Softpedia... Copy and paste if it doenst link. Its safe!    http://www.softpedia.com/get/System/Boot...    Now after you download Move On Boot and start the program, it should give you some options like rename, delete, move file... obviously click delete, or remove.    OK, so now you have to find your corrupted files csi gave you. Do this simply by following the directory. Should start something like C://programfiles/system32/ and so on.    So click start button, go to my computer, double click local disk (C:), double click program files, double click system 32 or whatever the directory says. Thats just an example.    Now, Move on boot will allow you to drag and drop those files into its directory bar. You can only do 1 file at a time. Tell it yes and I agree and yada yada yada. Then reboot your computer. Repeat the process with move on boot until all your bad files are gone.    NOTE: Make sure it is ONLY the files csi gave you and that you have the right ones! Once you delete with move on boot, its gone forever! So double check!    Deleting to the recycle bin doesnt work.     Hope this isnt to confusing. You can email me if you need help.

If so, you can use a XP install CD to install XP onto it and when you have everything configured and installed, you can load the drivers from a USB or any other device.    If there is no way to go to XP, you can always go to Windows 7 which is a tweaked version of Vista: http://www.microsoft.com/windows/windows...|`|zzvDybEiaa	First Back up all of your files / I would recommend , (cloning to an external HD) Then search out all of the HP Pavilion Slimline Model drivers for Windows XP.    Unless you have extensive PC experience, I would not recommend that you do it yourself.    My computer was a 1 month old IBM Lenovo Desktop.  320GB HD and 2GB Ram / K210 Celeron. Jan. 2009    I tried, and Vista would just not allow it. I ended up with a blank computer, and had to buy a new Windows XP OS, plus install fees, to a total of about $200.00    But like you, I couldn't live with Vista / I now have a wonderful Windows XP.|`|QEVKWLVQaa	That is not  a safe idea ... first off ... most manufacturers only use Vista Compatible hardware in these machines. Linux may work depending on what distro you get. Otherwise just stick with Vista it's not that bad. Like if you have the Realtek HD Audio Sound on your Vista machine, then you WILL NOT have sound for XP, because XP does not support the HD Audio. Secondly all those fancy pause, play, and skip buttons that most new PC laptops have are configured to work with the drivers for your laptop and most do not have drivers for XP. So basically just stick with Vista. I kind of like it better than boring old XP anyways (even though I'm now using XP.) I have never came across any issues of any type with Vista.

AA10834300	It sounds to me like your some of your system files files are corrupted. The specific files that deal with Internet traffic are called the Winsock files.    http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Winsock    The winsock files are system files that provide the networking interface between your applications, your web browser and the Internet.    The fact the more than one browser has a problem tends to lead me to believe this is the case.    This could have occured due to a virus infection or other malware. They generally try to attack the winsock files to get external access from your computer to the Internet.    In you have got a Windows disk, you could try running a Windows repair. Shown here for XP:    http://www.michaelstevenstech.com/XPrepa...    or here for Vista:    http://www.bleepingcomputer.com/tutorial...      If one of the winsock system files got damaged, both of the above processes should repair the damaged file.    You could also use System Restore if you know that your system was working properly a week ago, then use System Restore to roll your system back to a week ago.    http://www.microsoft.com/windowsxp/using...      Another helpful document is this one which has got links to further resources about directly repairing the Winsock files if they become corrupted:    http://windowsxp.mvps.org/winsock.htm    or use Netsh to reset TCP/IP (winsock files) to the default settings here:    http://support.microsoft.com/?kbid=29935...

Several versions of XP require a clean install. What that means is that you'll have to remove all the files from your computer, install the new operating system and start over. You can also upgrade to Vista without removing files. Visit the "Make the Move to Windows Vista" page on Microsoft.com (see Resources below).  Step2  Use the Windows Vista Upgrade Advisor. This program will thoroughly evaluate your computer and tell you what version to get. You can download it easily (see Resources below). Just download it and run the program. When it's finished, you can move on to the next step.  Step3  Choose a version. To do this, you'll need to visit Microsoft.com. You need to use the information you got from the Vista Upgrade Advisor. You will also need to decide what version you want for yourself. You have some choices: Ultimate, Home Premium, Home Basic, Business and Enterprise. You will need to read up for yourself on the Microsoft Web site to see which version best fits your needs.  Step4  Pay up. Now that you have decided on an edition, you need to buy it. You can either get it shipped to your house or just buy and download. Once you decide, click on the little shopping cart icon and follow the prompts to pay for the item.  Step5  Download the program. This will be the easiest part of the whole process. Just follow the prompts to download the program and it will tell you what to do. If you need more information, print out the download guide available with the product when you buy it.|`|3oNcHdgCaa	Many times it's actually OEM copies of Vista (or installations upgraded from XP) which run like a dog, and a clean Vista installation from an original Microsoft setup DVD tends to work better. However, XP performs faster on any given hardware, so unless Vista has something that you really like then you're usually better off with XP. But you'll need to backup all your files and format your hard drive if you're going to replace Vista with XP.

If you like doing things with your hands, building things and fixing things then hardware would be easier.    Personally I think hardware is easier to learn because it involves many of the skills that you already employ in every day life, such as putting parts together, moving parts, removing parts.     Software requires learning new skills like the syntax of commands and the structure of programming and for that reason, I think it's more difficult.|`|ye1tS9a2aa	you have to learn both, you need software for the hardware to work...software is like an engine, its like having a car with no engine in it|`|WaI693jHaa	Good question.

You can't download the songs but it's easy to use and there is probably any song you want on it.  http://listen.grooveshark.com/|`|tfuPCVzOaa	Here you go Tomboo, help yourself to as much as you want.    http://www.nubeat.org/|`|QWFvw2yvaa	You could always ask a friend.

9ykPS8Mqaa	Well, like bob said, internet explorer 8 is really bad. Dont use it. internet explorer 7 is so far the best and safest version yet. Also, you might consider firefox also, its safer then any version of internet explorer.mIt also comes with built in anitvirus, so when you download something, it scans it for viruses before you can open it. Internet explorer does not do this.     try it out, you wont be upset.     http://www.mozilla.com/en-US/firefox/|`|BByDc3PAaa	Personally Internet Explorer 8 is not good but I will give you the link for it:    http://www.microsoft.com/windows/product...

67a03774b3647b0531fb9965b58ec6d6aa	You will struggle to find someone that will give you an invite unless they know you. If you get warned or banned, they do too.  Your best option would to sign up when they open their doors to the public.  I saw it open for a few hours a day from 26th to 29th Jan, a shame you missed it. Previous to this it was open for for 2 days that ended on the 21st Jan.  Open Registration days can be any day of the week, are not necessarily every month and can last hours or days.  I'd advise you to check the site EVERY day and eventually you will get there.  If you can't get an invite you will need to follow this path, good luck.  Please try and keep your share ratio above 1.1 when you get in.    You may find this tool useful, it's called Tracker Checker and you can leave it running in the background - http://www.stamcar.com/2007/07/25/tracke...  If you use this tool you will need to edit a few trackers, the Demonoid one needs the 'find string' changing from 'sername' to 'Desired username'    Hope this helps.

m07z3IiAaa	I just had this virus 2 nights ago, kept me up all night to figure out how the hell to get rid of it.. but in the end i prevailed and that virus was crushed.. well idk if u can do the same as i did. but maybe u can...i had a program that shows everything that is running and i can delete it right on the spot. its called "hijackthis" it doesnt tell you what is actually running like "alt cntrl del" does. but somewhat shows u with a detailed description where its running from. i only needed it to delete this one thing that prevented me from running regedit in my start menu RUN.. then type regedit, from there i could delete MS Anti-virus 2009, but i wasnt done there, i went to this other site that the virus actually let me go to. it is called http://www.pchubs.com/blogs/antiviruspro...    there i hit the scan now button and it installed the scanner to detect where all the viruses was in my regedit (registry) and i manually deleted them, then i used the free program that that site i gave earlier called smitfraudfix, i ran it in safemode, and it fixed most of it. then i managed to download bitdefender, free version and ran a scan, and it caught alot. then i manage to download the malwarebytes(mbam) from download.com and it got rid of the rest...i think..    Step 1: Get Hijackthis if u can, if u can accept things on msn, i can maybe send u a copy, my email is the_legendary_jab@hotmail.com, maybe i can email it to you (you only need this if u cant Run regedit in the start menu RUN..)    Step 2: Go to http://www.pchubs.com/blogs/antiviruspro... and Press Scan Now and let it install and find that damn "MS Antivirus 2009" Virus. but while youre there at the site, u should also download the smitfraudfix because u will need it later.    Step 3: all the problems found in the scan, u must delete yourself because this scanner is not free, and wont remove it for you.. but to delete yourself u need hijackthis( i personally wouldnt buy this scanner because i think these guys are inlink with the guys that made this damn virus, so u would buy there stuff. And there smitfraudfix was detected as a trojan by an antivirus i had. so it just raised suspicions on them)    Step 4: launch hijackthis. look for a file called regedit =1, only delete this one, because everything listed isnt a virus, its only telling u what was running. so deleting everything will not result good for your pc.    Step 5: press the start menu hit RUN.. and type regedit.    Step 6 start deleting the files that the scanner found    Step 7 Hopefully u deleted some of the files that are preventing u from going to sites or installing programs. now is the time to restart your computer and run it in safe mode with networking    Step 8 go to that site i gave before and download smitfraudfix if u havent already, and run that in safemode. that should get rid of most of it.. but unfortunetly bitdefender said that smitfraudfix is a trojan itself so i got bitdefender to remover it which is step 9    Step 9 get BitDefender free version and run it to remove other viruses    Step 10 get malwarebytes (mbam) to fully remove the rest of MS Antivirus you can get it at download.com or its homepage site( i used download.com because that was one of the sites that the MS AV2009 virus let me go to)    Step 11 Get yourself a damn good antivirus to prevent this in the future...i recommend buying one     You may be able to skip a few steps if u can run smitfraudfix in safemode without deleting anything from the regedit..     just follow the instructions on the site i gave u if u can run programs. i had the worst version of this "MS Antivirus 2009" virus and could not do anything but use hijackthis    here is the site again that help me   http://www.pchubs.com/blogs/antiviruspro...|`|rMSJ6Gqcaa	Allow Microsoft to handle this one!!

9ECwMzZXaa	When you press the ON button, if one or both of the indicator lights (there's usually two, one for power, one showing disk activity) on the front of the case lights up but nothing else happens, it probably is the motherboard's problem.     If it was the power supply, usually you press the button and absolutely nothing comes up, nothing happens. BUT in your case the orange light turns on.    Just to be sure, you can test your power supply on another computer, if it works then its the motherboards problem.

HBAMQJPLaa	On startup press F2 for BIOS and select to boot on HD first.|`|hXHBm1BSaa	You need to install by booting from the cd, and then tell it to install. At the screen showing the partition you should tell it to delete it, then create a new one. This guarantees NO spyware or viruses left.

I am in china and I bought an HP nx6324 laptop with one core processor for about 5600 Yuans. BUt that laptop comes with 2 cores, but that was expensive, about 8000 yuans with 20 GB more HDD space, So I took the opportunity and got that one core. at least NOw I can upgrade to two core for just a couple of hundred yuans.

n7UCMIFLaa	I have Nero 7 Ultra, but there's probably not much difference with Nero 8.  For audio CD's use Nero Express (in StartSmart under Applications).  DVD-RW disks are rewritable & not all DVD players recognize them.  It's better to use DVD+R (Sony or Verbatim).  To burn DVD's use Nero Vision.  If Nero doesn't recognize your video format you can convert your video to avi, divx, etc.  You can download free converters at download.com.  Personally, I use Format Factory.    Hope this helped.

AA10834300	To give you an example. Adobe Photoshop costs anywhere between 500 to 1000 depending on the version used.    Photoshop Elements costs between 40 - 70.     Adobe Photoshop is the industry standard package used by professionals in the graphics design and photography industry.    Adobe Photoshop Elements is what you sometimes get free when you buy a digital camera.      It's a little bit of marketing from Adobe to tempt you into buying the full package!      Elements is fine for home use but if you are a professional then you'll want to have the full package.    Adobe Photoshop comes with loads more functionality than Adobe Photoshop Elements.|`|0a6f37ff97b71253871297bc4face75aaa	Yeah, elements is very basic in comparison.

812793fbbb1f4d6a8b07ee04d74ebb7daa	Well, you need to make sure you match the symbols, they are both on the printer and the cartridge.   To replace the ink cartridges  1. Make sure the device is on.  CAUTION: If the HP All-in-One is off when you open the front access door to  access the ink cartridges, the device will not release the cartridges for  changing. You might damage the device if the ink cartridges are not docked  safely when you try to remove them.  2. Open the front access door.  The print carriage moves to the far right side of the device.  3. Wait until the print carriage is idle and silent, and then lightly press down on an ink  cartridge to release it.  If you are replacing the tri-color ink cartridge, remove the ink cartridge from the slot  on the left.  Chapter 8  100 Maintain and troubleshoot  If you are replacing the black, photo, or gray photo ink cartridge, remove the ink  cartridge from the slot on the right.  4. Pull the ink cartridge toward you out of its slot.  5. If you are removing the black ink cartridge in order to install the photo or gray  photo ink cartridge, store the black ink cartridge in the ink cartridge protector or an  airtight plastic container.  6. Remove the new ink cartridge from its packaging and, being careful to touch only  the black plastic, gently remove the plastic tape by using the pink pull tab.  1 Copper-colored contacts  2 Plastic tape with pink pull tab (must be removed before installing)  3 Ink nozzles under tape  CAUTION: Do not touch the copper-colored contacts or ink nozzles. Also, do  not re-tape the ink cartridges. Doing so can result in clogs, ink failure, and bad  electrical connections.  Work with ink cartridges 101  7. Hold the ink cartridge with the HP logo on top, and insert the new ink cartridge into  the empty cartridge slot. Make sure you push the ink cartridge in firmly until it  snaps into place.  If you are installing the tri-color ink cartridge, slide it into the left slot.  If you are installing a black, photo, or gray photo ink cartridge, slide it into the right  slot.  8. Close the front access door.  If you installed a new ink cartridge, the device prints an ink cartridge alignment  page.  9. When prompted, ensure plain white paper is loaded in the input tray, then press OK.  10. Load the ink cartridge alignment sheet face down on the scanner glass in the front  right corner with the top of the page to the right, and then press OK. For more  information, see Load an original on the scanner glass.  The HP All-in-One aligns the ink cartridges. Recycle or discard the ink cartridge  alignment sheet.

It will let you decrypt and then burn out to DVD again.   You'll need something like Toast Titanium or such though to burn out, MTR only does the decrypt for you.

ahRXIkbmaa	It depends on several things. War driving is cruising neighborhoods in order to map undocumented wi-fi access points. Many wireless routers used on dsl and cable internet connections are installed using default settings with no encryption which can allow someone to connect to the network and access the internet, and if the pc in the house is turned on and had file sharing enabled, can make it possible for someone to access files on the hard drive.     The guy on COPS was simply using an unsecured WI-FI hot spot to buy stuff over the internet. The card numbers  were not taken from the computer in the home, but were obtained from somewhere else. He had a bunch of names, addresses and credit card numbers in a notebook.The reason for using a  wifi link is that it can't be traced back to the crook.     By the way, Identity thieves often get the credit card info by buying it from data thieves who use  techniques like phishing, pharming, trashing, and skimming to collect the info.     One really common method is to pay restaurant servers a small fee for the name, address, credit number expiration date and security code from customers cards. From the handwritten notes in the notebook, I suspect his list was obtaind this way.|`|14d0ad3dfdb4dd36a9f896b96a702e69aa	'War Driving' is the name of this tactic.  Pro's looking to pull a score will concentrate on upper class neighborhoods in order to find a 'bigger'  target, and start compiling a portfolio on the house; times people are there; what banks are used and so on: but anybody will do just fine.  So, yes for non-encrypted wifi networks, thieves can and will take advantage.|`|ue2Tb7sRaa	wifi only has a short range, depending on the type of router it can go from a few rooms to the whole house or larger. usually routers for home use only give wifi to the house and on the street you might get a little signal, if any.  just make sure you have a password on your wifi so people cannot get into it.  also if you dont use a bluetooth headset and your phone has bluetooth, turn it off, there are programs you can download on to your cellphone that can find people with bluetooth on and look at their contacts, read their messages, and make calls and send text messages from their phone.  so just be careful about how much wireless stuff you have turned on and you should be fine

I'm only assuming your asking 'Why do guys cheat with their real life g/f's with on line women?" I personally do not consider chatting cheating. However if there are plans to meet and talk of sexual pleasures such as cybering then that's different. I do feel if one is going to cheat they should split from their partner upon doing so.

I chat with a couple guys that are involved with other girls and a some of them are even married! Am I a homewrecker even though we only talk about my problems or movies or music or just random stuff that doesn't even matter?    Chatting online is no different than chatting in person except you can't see each other. Like I said before, totally different story if they are talkin' all sexual and sharing naughty pics, but talking is just talking.

This supplies with proper voltage and stops over fluctuating of voltage.  6) And the most important thing is charge your laptop full, when you buy it first time as it is directed in the user's manual.

If it is a software issue, it might be due to a virus, spyware, or corrupted operating system files.    If it is a HARDWARE problem, which it sounds like it might be, then it's a much bigger problem.  On such an older computer, it probably wouldn't be worth the cost to get it fixed.. considering that you can buy a used Pentium 3, 1.0 gigahertz machine these days for less than twenty dollars.    Also, if it is the original hard drive, it is probably very small, too small to be useful anymore.  Your best bet might be to remove the hard drive and destroy it to protect any personal data that might be on it, and then sell the computer for parts.  The memory and CD-rom might be the only useful parts left in it.    Can't say for sure, since I don't know specifically what you have.

0abf52e9048e05a852e90e1316728b92aa	There is no default Username or Password for accessing the printer thru the network. Unless you set one yourself, all you should need to do is open an internet browser (i.e. Internet Explorer) and type in the printer's IP address or Host Name in the address bar. That should take you into the printer to set it up as you need. If you don't know either one, then you'll need to print out a printer configuration page (usually by pressing and holding the Go button for 5 to 6 seconds {usually a status light will change} while the device Ready light is on and no other jobs are printing.)    If it is locked up, then you'll need to do a cold reset to reset all the printer and network interface parameters:  To perform a cold reset:  1. Turn the printer off.  2. Press and hold down the GO button.  3. Turn the printer on, and continue to hold the GO button for at least 5 seconds, but not longer than 15 seconds. During this process, the Attention LED turns on.  4. Release the GO button.    Hope that helps. Best of luck.|`|13cc03f46e318a1a2bae06264512cbc6aa	I am a beginner but this might help  http://www.papercut.com/kb/Main/Resettin...

If you have Sony Vegas 9 it is a pirated copy posing as Ver 9.  I suggest if your version says Sony Vegas then you have put spyware and malware on your computer. The other possibility is that you have Sony Movie Studio which is in version 9.  It helps no one to pirate a copy of software and in so doing spread viruses. Sony Vegas is cheap enough compared to the competition to purchase a legit copy and then benefit from Sony's excellent product support and users groups
zorYTX59aa	Unfortunately for you, any music that is not your creation and which   is used in your video is considered "copyright infringement". The big   music/media corporations such as UMG, Warner and Viacom don't  just "own" their music, they also own the "rights" to them, including  how and where "their music" can be publicly presented.    Even if you gave credits to the song, the artist and/or the label, that  should never be construed as an excuse or justification for you and   really YouTube to "break the law". You could contest the takedown  trying to claim that your video is for "personal use" only, but the big  corporation lawyers could ask some intriguing questions of you like  A) why did you upload your vid to YouTube; B) why did you, in their  minds, rip off "their music"; and C) how did you acquire that music?   Even if you bought it legally (and can prove it!), that does not entitle   you to, in their eyes, "distribute" it illegally for free -- or to have your   video potentially come across as though you may be a commercial  agent or official representative of theirs. It may not be your intention,   but for the copyright owner, you may be involuntarily defaming them,  the music or the artist. And if they did not object to your video or do  anything about it, it could be perceived that they "officially" endorse   you, or that you are a part of them.    If you're willing to take the chance and re-upload your video with the   same music, do not write the name of the song or artist in your title,  description, or tags. Also avoid irrelevant phrases like "no copyright   infringement intended", "I do not own the music" or "I don't take any   credit for this song". The upload servers at YouTube actively search   for words and sentences like that. As well, it also reaffirms that you   have knowingly taken, used, copied or maybe even stolen someone   else's copyrighted material.    You should also consider the fact that the music-recording industry   is starting to use hidden "watermarks" or "fingerprints" buried within  their music, in order to uncover and identify their illicit use. As such,   it is possible that no matter how many times you try to upload your   video, it may always be rejected because of "copyright infringement".  You would thus be better off trying to find a different recording of the   music you want to use. If you've noticed that other videos are using   the exact same music, those videos were probably uploaded before   this new technology really started coming into being.    The only possible exception to everything that I've just written above   is for you to use music that is shorter than 30 seconds. If you listen   carefully to any talk-show on radio or TV, they will never use or play  other people's music for longer than 30 seconds when introducing a   guest or going into/out of commercials. Can you guess the reason?  (Hint: it has to do with "licensing fees" and "royalties".)    I hope my info has been helpful to you.|`|pJOvD6Nlaa	Ok first if you have any music in that video in the description put the title and the writer. Second if you have anything such as Movie clips or websites you have to put the copright in the description.

We are still not done. The next thing you will want to do is apply some registry tweaks (you can either do this manually or download the .reg file to do it for you), I have that guide over at XGA Tech what you do is up to you on that one. The link to BootVis (boot optimizer) is in the article. If you do all of this your PC will be running faster than it was when it was brand new out of the box.|`|AA12108934	Would it be too much to ask you to elaborate....just a tad?

p6SIyTWEaa	So why did you put this question in the Facebook catagory...? You crazy Canadians    Harvey's Burger's and any other beef patty should be able to be frozen for about two years. The problem is the condiments on the burger will go bad rather quickly. Mayo will start to spoil within a few days.     Besides that I would give it a day before it would be too soggy and disgusting to eat anymore. Why don't you just throw it away and buy another burger when you can eat it...? They can't cost more than 5 bucks tops.

There are some freewars that avilable on net for Trojan removal. Freewares can run scan and deduct Trojan virus but for elimination one has to pay.

If you are using Norton or some OTHER mechanisms, you must also consider that files might have been QUARANTINED and in some cases DELETED.    IF you have "FILE UNDELETE" tools, such as those provided by Norton, you can TRY to SCAN for the files and try to UNDELETE what is REMAINING *however* do REALIZE that from the point of RECOVERY AND ONWARD that FILES which are just remaining as "ghost fragments" CAN BE TRASHED and lost forever.

When a selection is made in the dropdown the function showContent() will be called (which is in the  tag). This function will display the image followed by the text. the  tag is the tag for the image, you just need to replace the v1 with the path of the image. You might also want to use some layouts like tables . You can find the information for tables in the website www.w3schools.com. I hope this is what you need, and that I did not confuse you any further. If you have any questions please do not hesitate to ask me.

9e414a1211a7e5076be6b0772af4831baa	downloading Ghz - you made my day! :D    fun aside, depends on the type of CPU you have. if it's a newer dual core CPU the 2.66Ghz is sufficient by far (the 3.0Ghz is a reference to the old Pentium 4 processor).  concerning the video card - you need something better than an integrated graphics in order to play Mirrors Edge.    as you didn't tell what brand and model your computer is i have to make an assumption. desktop computers less than 3 years old have most likely a PCIe x16 slot. in case you can upgrade the graphics card (from an integrated graphics) i can suggest 2 affordable cards that surpass the requirements for Mirrors Edge, they both have Shader Model 4.0 or 4.1    Geforce 9500GT  http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.as...

They are pieces of internal hardware. GHz referring to your CPU speed and video card referring to your nVidia GeForce 6800 are both internal hardware. They must be bought. The drivers however can be downloaded. If you want to play that game you have to upgrade some parts of your system. You will need a compatible motherboard, cpu, and videocard. Mirrors Edge is a high graphics game. If I were you I would give it back to the store unless you are willing to upgrade your system by adding new hardware. I am not sure how much this would cost but there are some stores that upgrade your computer for you. If you want you can do it yourself. Do some research on your computer and your motherboard. You might be able to get a 3.0 GHz processor if you check your motherboard's compatibility. You can ask me other questions if you want through email.|`|U9QTcTvFaa	I suggest to buy Nvidia 8800GT or Nvidia 9600GT. I purchased 9600GT card for my Desktop Computer.

AA11345844	First thing, change your passwords, both on your email account and on your computer.  Make it at least 12 characters with at least 2 uppercase, 2 lower case, 2 symbols, and 2 numbers.  That complexity should keep him guessing for a while.  Change your password every 90 days.  That will keep him from being able to bruteforce crack it and get any value from it.  Next put up a new firewall.  If you are using the MS firewall, be sure to turn it off before installing the new one.  The conflicts between the two will render your box useless. Next, update and run your AV software to ensure he has trojaned your computer.    This isn't perfect but it should help, the unfortunate part is he probably already has a list of all of your contacts, so the harrassment probably won't stop.  If it persists you may be able to take legal action, but tracking this guy down won't be easy.

616e6e4ce97e5d75f04738b560555915aa	Instead of installing 5 separate PCs with their own individual copies of Windows OS, consider following option...    Invest in a PC Sharing system that allow up to 6 operators to work on 1 system simultaneously. This legally allows you to run your business with 1 licensed copy of any software.    Each operator have their own monitor, keyboard and mouse and are sharing the 1 pc system.    A PC sharer allows multiple users with a keyboard, monitor and/or mouse each to access a single PC (CPU) on a first come first served basis. The sharer will also split the monitor signal allowing the same screen to be displayed on all connected monitors. All connected keyboards, monitors and mice will act exactly as if they were connected directly to your computer.    Each operator can run different applications and all can surf the net at the same time.    It's all done through a switching box/router hardware.    This way you invest all that money in 5 pcs of up to $7,500 in one real hot main PC system (go for the top line) dual processor, etc. You may even have some spare change left over for some nice chairs.

ITS INFORMATION ABOUT TECHNOLOGY!! HMMMM|`|804d73b21c4b7751aa614ce8a206dfdbaa	Information technology   Information technology (IT) or Information and communication(s) technology (ICT) (also Infocomm, esp. in Asia) is a broad subject concerned with technology and other aspects of managing and processing information, especially in large organizations.    In particular, IT deals with the use of electronic computers and computer software to convert, store, protect, process, transmit, and retrieve information. For that reason, computer professionals are often called IT specialists, and the division of a company or university that deals with software technology is often called the IT department. Other names for the latter are information services (IS) or management information services (MIS), managed service providers (MSP).    In the UK education system Information Technology was formally integrated into the school curriculum when the National Curriculum was devised. It was quickly realised that the work covered was useful in all subjects. With the arrival of the internet and the broadband connections to all schools, the application of IT knowledge, skills and understanding in all subjects became a reality. This change in emphasis has resulted in a change of name from IT (Information Technology) to ICT (Information and Communication Technology). ICT is now a subject present on many (but not all) UK school timetables and should be understood as the application of digital equipment to all aspects of teaching and learning.  source: http://www.answers.com/topic/information...|`|AA12223903	data stored in a type of computer also data stored in a computer for a special type of job.each data is different there is dif.kinds of datas without data computers are almost useless and without data the computer cannot store nor do the job you witch.data is stored   by the Central processing unit  (cpu).if you want to know more go to http://www.answers.com/Central%20process...

It kind of just stops in the middle of what it's doing, and when you turn the screen back on, it continues.    of course, I have issues if I run anything other than solitaire while it's doing it's thing. That's why I have it run while I'm asleep on Fridays or so.     If you're concerned, you may want to try that.    Hope that helps!

070ee9751d87be394ab71b98e4b61904aa	Hello.    This is rather simple.    Let's say that you want to display the name, phone number and address for each of the 10 service providers.    First of all, you will have to insert the data in a database table, so you will create a table with 3 columns: name | phone | address, then insert the data for each of the service providers in it.    Then, on the php page, you will have to use a parameter that will tell the script what service provider does it have to display on that particular page. Basically, you will have to access the script somehow like    www.blabla.com/script.php?name=TheName    When you access this from a web browser, the script will run a query on the database and it will return the values of the name, phone number and address fields from the row that holds the info on the "TheName" service provider.    The query will have to be something like this:    SELECT * FROM `{table_name}` WHERE `name` = 'TheName";    where {table_name} is the name of the table that holds the data.    After that, you will use PHP to output each of those fields to the HTML, which will then be parsed by the browser.    Also, since the number of of service providers you might want to list can vary, you can generate the links on the fly, using the data stored in the database. In order to do that, you will have to run a query  on the database that will select the "name" field on every row of the table, and then use a "while" loop, that will output a HTML link for every record in the database.|`|d0bda7c229a405e70f5cb289deec30aeaa	PHP is a programming language designed to process web pages. It is interpreted, not compiled.    A PHP page on a website is a script (it may be contained in more than one file). The extension .php tells the web server not to simply send the script to the user, but to run it through the PHP interpreter and send the output to the user.    A PHP script can do what it likes to generate its output. It can connect to a database. Or not. It can perform calculations. Or not. And so on.    The thing that makes PHP easier to use is that the interpreter simply echoes to the user lines that are not in PHP. This means a PHP script can be an HTML file, and only the dynamic bits need to be specially coded for. A special tag (which is usually configurable, but is typically ) contains tells the interpreter it has met some PHP script that it has to execute.|`|434830b9975bbfc52ab3c8ee53d11e9aaa	http://www.randomsite.com/blah.php?id=1.... :  Not Found  The requested URL /blah.php was not found on this server.

b01b9b8b0e203b0d4b6a0a8d1710068aaa	Your choice for IT certification would depend on which field of IT do you want to go for..  For example if you want to go for Hardware/Networking/Sys. Adm. sort of roles/field then your choices would be    MCSE(Microsoft Certified Systems Engineer) in case you want to focus on MS Windows products.  MCDST(Microsoft Certified Desktop Support Tech.)    and others on the same line..  In field of networking it would be  CCNA(Cisco certified Network Associate) in case you want to go into networking and want to work on routers/switched made by cisco systems.  CCND(Cisco certified Network Designer)    If you want to goto Sys Admin role in Solaris or Linux or Unix then following would be helpful  Sun Certified System Administration   Linux Red Hat System Administration    These were some of the paths and common certifications in case of you wanting to go into Networking/Hardware/Sys Adm field.    In Case you want to go into Software Development field  then most common certification would be   MCSD (Microsoft Certified System Developer)  Sun Java certifications    In case you want to go into Database development/admin role then you can go for   Oracle Certifications (OCP)  MCDBA (Microsoft Certified Database administrator)    So as you can see you have so many options intially you need to decide which field you want to enter into IT and then choose the certifications accordingly.

It falls on the last two days of the dark half of Kartik (October-November). For some it is a three-day festival. It commences with the Dhan-Teras, on the 13th day of the dark half of Kartik, followed the next day by the Narak Chaudas, the 14th day, and by Deepavali proper on the 15th day.    There are various alleged origins attributed to this festival. Some hold that they celebrate the marriage of Lakshmi with Lord Vishnu. In Bengal the festival is dedicated to the worship of Kali. It also commemorates that blessed day on which the triumphant Lord Rama returned to Ayodhya after defeating Ravana. On this day also Sri Krishna killed the demon Narakasura.    In South India people take an oil bath in the morning and wear new clothes. They partake of sweetmeats. They light fireworks which are regarded as the effigies of Narakasura who was killed on this day. They greet one another, asking, "Have you had your Ganges bath?" which actually refers to the oil bath that morning as it is regarded as purifying as a bath in the holy Ganges.    Everyone forgets and forgives the wrongs done by others. There is an air of freedom, festivity and friendliness everywhere. This festival brings about unity. It instils charity in the hearts of people. Everyone buys new clothes for the family. Employers, too, purchase new clothes for their employees.    Waking up during the Brahmamuhurta (at 4a.m.) is a great blessing from the standpoint of health, ethical discipline, efficiency in work and spiritual advancement. It is on Deepavali that everyone wakes up early in the morning. The sages who instituted this custom must have cherished the hope that their descendents would realise its benefits and make it a regular habit in their lives.    In a happy mood of great rejoicing village folk move about freely, mixing with one another without any reserve, all enmity being forgotten. People embrace one another with love. Deepavali is a great unifying force. Those with keen inner spiritual ears will clearly hear the voice of the sages, "O Children of God! unite, and love all". The vibrations produced by the greetings of love which fill the atmosphere are powerful enough to bring about a change of heart in every man and woman in the world. Alas! That heart has considerably hardened, and only a continuous celebration of Deepavali in our homes can rekindle in us the urgent need of turning away from the ruinous path of hatred.    On this day Hindu merchants in North India open their new account books and pray for success and prosperity during the coming year. The homes are cleaned and decorated by day and illuminated by night with earthern oil-lamps. The best and finest illuminations are to be seen in Bombay and Amritsar. The famous Golden Temple at Amritsar is lit in the evening with thousands of lamps placed all over the steps of the big tank. Vaishnavites celebrate the Govardhan Puja and feed the poor on a large scale.    O Ram! The light of lights, the self-luminous inner light of the Self is ever shining steadily in the chamber of your heart. Sit quietly. Close your eyes. Withdraw the senses. Fix the mind on this supreme light and enjoy the real Deepavali, by attaining illumination of the soul.    He who Himself sees all but whom no one beholds, who illumines the intellect, the sun, the moon and the stars and the whole universe but whom they cannot illumine, He indeed is Brahman, He is the inner Self. Celebrate the real Deepavali by living in Brahman, and enjoy the eternal bliss of the soul.    The sun does not shine there, nor do the moon and the stars, nor do lightnings shine and much less fire. All the lights of the world cannot be compared even to a ray of the inner light of the Self. Merge yourself in this light of lights and enjoy the supreme Deepavali.    Many Deepavali festivals have come and gone. Yet the hearts of the vast majority are as dark as the night of the new moon. The house is lit with lamps, but the heart is full of the darkness of ignorance. O man! wake up from the slumber of ignorance. Realise the constant and eternal light of the Soul which neither rises nor sets, through meditation and deep enquiry.    May you all attain full inner illumination! May the supreme light of lights enlighten your understanding! May you all attain the inexhaustible spiritual wealth of the Self! May you all prosper gloriously on the material as well as spiritual planes!

b01b9b8b0e203b0d4b6a0a8d1710068aaa	new version of NTFS supports new features such as disk quotas and file level encryption.  The essence of NTFS encryption is that its designed so that only the creator of a file can view the files contents. To the creator, an encrypted file appears as any other file would. The files creator doesnt have to go through any special decryption procedure to view the files contents. The decryption process is completely automatic. Likewise, applications that try to read the file can do so without having to go through any special procedures. However, any one else who tries to view an encrypted file will see gibberish.      To encrypt a file on an NTFS version 5 partition, select the file or folder that you want to encrypt. Next, right click on the folder select the Properties command from the resulting context menu. When you see the folders properties sheet, select the General tab and click the Advanced button. On the following dialog box, select the Encrypt Contents to Secure Data check box and click OK twice. At this point, if youre encrypting a folder, youll see a dialog box that asks if you want to encrypt only the folder that youve selected or the folder, all sub folders and the files that they contain. Make your selection, click OK and the files or folders will be encrypted.

Multimedia also refers to the use of computer technology to create, store, and experience multimedia content.

You can have two network cards in your computer, and have each of them connecting to a different ISP device (Whether its dial up, or broadband. The easiest way of doing this is to "bridge" the two connection within the "Network connections" dialog window. right mouse click on one of the network connections and choose "bridge connection" and follow the onscreen prompts. When you do this, it will link the two ISP's and make a "shotgun" connection, drawing the data stream through both the connections.    I hope this helps|`|734e69034868b48967493fb024921276aa	Yes, you just need to set each isp with it's own internet connection configuration.

rEqKlpbcaa	An IP address consist of something like a series of numbers and dots in the form of XXX.XX.XX.XX or is alphanumeric value, say yahoo.com.<br>  <br>  Thus, there is no guarantee that by knowing only the IP Number or the domain, you could contact A PARTICULAR PERSON. IP addresses specify a particular computer and they are not synonymous or assigned to particular person like a Social Security Number or Tax ID. Also, it could be probable that the IP address is used as a host or a server which routes other users as in a local or wide area network, and thus the IP address is used by a number of persons. <br>  <br>  But if you are sure that the IP address is used by a particular person you personally know, then of course you can contact that particular person either through Telnet or other protocols.

With dozens of new malwares being coded and released every day, an anti-malware program without daily updates is useless.<br>  <br>  If you are looking for a free alternative, I would suggest Avast, the newest version 4.8. Avast now includes anti-virus, some anti-spyware capability and anti-rootkit components. And all for the low low price of free.

otir4W0caa	The best solution I have found is to put my Linksys SPA2102-NA VoIP ATA directly behind my cable modem.  The SPA 2102-NA has built-in Router and QOS and gives all VoIP traffic priority over all other data.<br>  Then, I have my Linksys WRT-54G after the SPA2102-NA.  Then, my PC is connected to the WRT-54G.  I have VoIP Softphones on the PC that are working just fine this way.  The WRT-54G does have to Port Forward SIP Ports 5060-5061 (UDP) and RTP ports 10,000-20,000.<br>  <br>  Previously, I had the Linksys WRT-54G NAT-Router directly behind the Modem.  And the WRT-54G was port forwarding VoIP SIP ports 5060-5063 (UDP) and RTP ports 16,384-16,482.  Then, my Linksys PAP2T-NA VoIP adapters and PC were connected to the output ports of the WRT-54G.<br>  <br>  I'm finding that I have better results with the Linksis SPA2102-NA directly behind the Modem.  Then, everything else after that.  I am getting very good VoIP quality with my VoIP carriers this way.<br>  <br>  I highly recommend the Linksys SPA2102-NA adapter configured with your own BYOD VoIP provider of choice.|`|95279c3e886c01fd779498ebe313bee8aa	Speedtouch 780 WL with 2 built in Voip ports

bdd85ece2158f2891e3cc6046cb57b8daa	Webpage design are often an easy way to get started. It can involve from a limited amount of coding to a whole lot (when he gets involved with scripts and scripting languages). The result will often be graphical, so you always see what you're doing, contrarily to other things where you only see words and numbers. Since it is graphical, he/she will also need to create some graphics for the webpage (2 birds with one stone).    If he likes animations and graphics more than coding, Macromedia Flash is fun and doesn't require an extensive amount of coding (sometimes none at all).    For writing simple programs, he/she can look into Visual Basic. That is the language that is being taught in high school and often in business courses. VB lacks a bit in power though and it is not possible to make more advanced games on it, so when he feels comfortable with it and he's really up to the challenge, C or C++. Those have really everything he will ever need for game development. My friend (he's a genious though so we can't really compare) was able to rewrite the whole original quake game by his first year in college in C++.

First, let me say that any Internet use by a 9 y/o should probably be directly monitored by a parent or responsible adult.  It would probably, IMHO, be appropriate to set up a system in the child's room with no Internet connection and use another machine to surf together.  Once you've resolved this to your satisfaction, I'd recommend that you try the first URL below as it has a lot of links to compilers ( the software to translate source code into a working program ), articles, tutorials and editors that are free to download.  The second URL is a site that hosts freeware development projects.  It has a lot of game software and game engines for creating it.  All are free and Open Source (the source code is distributed freely with the software and can be legally modified) so it can be examined to see how it works.       p.s.  IF you choose to isolate a machine that the child can use for learning about programming, I'd find an older machine.  Hopefully, one with no less than Windows 98 or ME on it, and not more either.  This makes learning a language easier since the reverse compatibility with DOS is better and the Windows are compatible with the newer versions to a great extent.  I hope that this helps you out.|`|AA10780214	I would start off with a basic PC class, move into various levels of programming (computer language, graphics or animation) and such....

They may not have highly specialized classes, but taking a few of the creative writing classes wouldn't hurt for a game designer.  You could also get him started in some programming languages, so that he gets used to them, even if he doesn't stick to the same language once he enters a field of study.  Note: if you do this, he will be extremely young compared to the other people in his classes, but I can't see why he wouldn't be allowed to pursue this route if he can keep up.    Can't hurt to give him a PS1 or PS2 and some of the RPG maker games too.|`|cd5b5664ee4d6ffee07176858aaad009aa	I'm glad to know that you've identified your child's interest and would like to nurture it. :)  Your 9 year old may be interested in the Kid's Programming Language, which may be found at http://www.kidsprogramminglanguage.com/ , which is a simplified programming environment which your child may explore that will allow him to make his own games.  If you are proficient in programming yourself, you may work with your son using the LiveWires modules which may be freely downloaded from http://www.livewires.org.uk/python/ . These modules should take you from the basics all the way to making simple games, including SpaceWar, Asteroids, and Pacman.  Both resources are free, so you may evaluate both of them to see which will be a better fit for your child. Or you can let your child try them both!  I think that game development is a great activity for children, and it will expose him early to relatively more advanced math and computer concepts that will really help him later and even in his professional life. And it's a good outlet for creativity - it's good for both sides of the brain :). Good luck and I hope that this be a great start for your child in the game development industry.

The invention of the telegraph, telephone, radio, and computer set the stage for this unprecedented integration of capabilities. The Internet is at once a world-wide broadcasting capability, a mechanism for information dissemination, and a medium for collaboration and interaction between individuals and their computers without regard for geographic location.    The Internet represents one of the most successful examples of the benefits of sustained investment and commitment to research and development of information infrastructure. Beginning with the early research in packet switching, the government, industry and academia have been partners in evolving and deploying this exciting new technology. Today, terms like "bleiner@computer.org" and "http://www.acm.org" trip lightly off the tongue of the random person on the street. 1    This is intended to be a brief, necessarily cursory and incomplete history. Much material currently exists about the Internet, covering history, technology, and usage. A trip to almost any bookstore will find shelves of material written about the Internet. 2    In this paper, 3 several of us involved in the development and evolution of the Internet share our views of its origins and history. This history revolves around four distinct aspects. There is the technological evolution that began with early research on packet switching and the ARPANET (and related technologies), and where current research continues to expand the horizons of the infrastructure along several dimensions, such as scale, performance, and higher level functionality. There is the operations and management aspect of a global and complex operational infrastructure. There is the social aspect, which resulted in a broad community of Internauts working together to create and evolve the technology. And there is the commercialization aspect, resulting in an extremely effective transition of research results into a broadly deployed and available information infrastructure.    The Internet today is a widespread information infrastructure, the initial prototype of what is often called the National (or Global or Galactic) Information Infrastructure. Its history is complex and involves many aspects - technological, organizational, and community. And its influence reaches not only to the technical fields of computer communications but throughout society as we move toward increasing use of online tools to accomplish electronic commerce, information acquisition, and community operations.|`|8918d594ed32ca879c7a663a05a8e1e7aa	The Internet was first used by the US Military|`|56cd87acf7fd68f91483de04ee0bf7d6aa	there is a very old computer locked away in a secret government facility, thats where it all started.

This can include whether to use CHAR or VARCHAR for some columns, how the tables are indexed, and how the underlying storage structures are set up to ensure adequate performance for each table. Deciding whether to use views or derived tables is also a physical design decision.     The logical design is the public interface of the database, such as tables, columns, functions, and procedures, the outward appearance of which can be unchanged, even after the DBA performs significant restructuring of the physical design.|`|4a23df3d7976b5387d61c0c08de40c32aa	Physical design is data as it is actually stored in bit , byte form in the physical devices.

b01b9b8b0e203b0d4b6a0a8d1710068aaa	Firewalls are designed to keep your privacy and your PC safe. A Firewall can either be hardware or software. Hardware firewalls are generally used to protect large networks of computers whereas software firewalls are generally used to protect one computer at a time.     Software firewalls offer basic defense from outside and inside attacks. In addition, they let you move from network to network. Hardware firewalls provide an additional outer layer of defense that can more effectively hide one or more connected PCs, blocking miscreants via a secure, dedicated platform.     Hardware firewalls are important because they provide a strong degree of protection from most forms of attack coming from the outside world. Additionally, in most cases, they can be effective with little or no configuration, and they can protect every machine on a local network.     A hardware firewall in a typical broadband router employs a technique called packet filtering, which examines the header of a packet to determine its source and destination addresses. This information is compared to a set of predefined and/or user-created rules that determine whether the packet is to be forwarded or dropped. A more advanced technique called Stateful Packet Inspection (SPI), looks at additional characteristics such as a packet's actual origin (i.e. did it come from the Internet or from the local network) and whether incoming traffic is a response to existing outgoing connections, like a request for a Web page.

AA11723706	ISDN stands for Integrated Services Digital Network, a system of digital phone connections which has been available for over a decade. This system allows voice and data to be transmitted simultaneously across the world using end-to-end digital connectivity.     With ISDN, voice and data are carried by bearer channels (B channels) occupying a bandwidth of 64 kb/s (bits per second). Some switches limit B channels to a capacity of 56 kb/s. A data channel (D channel) handles signaling at 16 kb/s or 64 kb/s, depending on the service type. Note that, in ISDN terminology, "k" means 1000 (103), not 1024 (210) as in many computer applications (the designator "K" is sometimes used to represent this value); therefore, a 64 kb/s channel carries data at a rate of 64000 b/s. A new set of standard prefixes has recently been created to handle this. Under this scheme, "k" (kilo-) means 1000 (103), "M" (mega-) means 1000000 (106), and so on, and "Ki" (kibi-) means 1024 (210), "Mi" (mebi-) means 1048576 (220), and so on.|`|4a4dad36c5968ff195685fc061272716aa	Although Integrated Services Digital Network is the most common,  the Acronym Finder has 4 other meanings.|`|AA12281242	Integrated Services Digital Network|`|AA12070412	Integrated Services Digital Network     Find out everything about ISDN....    http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISDN|`|efd4363c4373db793891632ff29c1683aa	Integrated Services Digital Network    From wikipedia:  The English term is a "backronym", thought better for English-language advertisements than the original, "Integriertes Sprach- und Datennetz" (German for "Integrated Speech and Data Net").
AA10349787	It is only about 1 megabyte. . .and it's always been free.    This guide should get you started:    DVD Shrink is no longer updated, so it cannot remove new copy protections from the last approx. 6 months.  Unfortunately, you can waste blank discs using only DVD Shrink.  To burn newer DVDs, reference the following guide:    Copying Movies can be a slightly complicated process if you're not familiar with the programs used to do it. However, once you're accustomed to using the software, it's much easier.    So here's how to get started:    Burning DVDs with DVD Decrypter, DVD Shrink, and Nero.    Before you start, youll need to have the following programs installed on your computer:    DVD Decrypter  http://www.mrbass.org/dvdrip/     DVD Shrink  http://www.mrbass.org/dvdshrink/     Nero (version 6.3 or higher recommended, which you can download from oldversion.com)  http://www.oldversion.com/program.php?n=...     serial number for Nero 6.3  http://computer-tricks.blogspot.com/2006...     (Note: DVD Decrypter and DVD Shrink are free online.)    (Note: Always try to use a new, unscratched DVD movie disc whenever making copies, as discs in poor condition may not copy, or will likely pass on glitches to the copy.)    Its also recommended that you dont run other programs while burning DVDs unless you have over 1GB of RAM or more.    Insert the disc you wish to copy.    Close any DVD player program that opens.    Phase 1    Open DVD Decrypter.    Click on Mode > ISO > Read    Now click on the folder icon that shows where the DVD file will be saved. Choose a folder.    Now click on File > Decrypt.    The process of making an exact copy of the disc to the hard drive should take approx. 30-40min. depending on the length of the movie and extra features.    When DVD Decrypter is finished creating the file, you can close the program and eject the disc.    Phase 2    Now open DVD Shrink.    Click on File > Open Disc Image    Browse for the file that you saved when copying with DVD Decrypter.    DVD Shrink will now analyze the movie for a minute or two.    Uncheck boxes for extra audio Languages that you don't need on the DVD    Click on the plus + sign by the Extras folder.  (This is where the bonus materials are on the disc)    To have higher movie quality, remove the extras by clicking on the individual files and selecting Still image/still images from the dropdown menu. (You can preview the extras if you want to see the clips before removing them.)    If you'd like to keep the extra features on the DVD, select the clip and change the dropdown menu to custom compression and lower it to about 50 or 60 percent for each extra.    Click on the main movie folder. If you've removed enough extras, or compressed them, the movie quality should be around 60-70%, the HIGHER THE BETTER.    Note: Target quality is about 65-70%, anything higher than 65%, and on regular size  TV's you won't be able to tell the difference between the copy and the original.    I personally either remove the extras or compress them to achieve the best quality.    If a movie is not too much over two hours, or doesn't have many extras, it will copy  closer to 100% quality.    Insert a blank DVD disc.    When youve achieved the quality setting on the main movie that youd like, click on the Backup! icon.    Before clicking OK to start the burning, click on the Burn Settings tab and change the speed to 1 or 2 speeds lower than the highest available.    DVD Shrink will now compress the file that DVD Decrypter made and create DVD video files. Afterwards, it will automatically burn those files and the disc will be completed.    This will take about 20-30 min. to create the DVD video files and approx. 10-15 min. to burn onto the blank disc.|`|09b2deaf36206664a2ebbe7f912a1177aa	it costs no money.  maybe a few kilobytes in terms of what is downloaded, but a relatively small cost.  of course, like i said before, it's free.  check the link in the sources section to download it.  the hero strikes again!
b01b9b8b0e203b0d4b6a0a8d1710068aaa	Internet Protocol version 6 (IPv6) is a network layer IP standard used by electronic devices to exchange data across a packet-switched internetwork. It follows IPv4 as the second version of the Internet Protocol to be formally adopted for general use.    IPv6 is intended to provide more addresses for networked devices, allowing, for example, each cell phone and mobile electronic device to have its own address. IPv4 supports 4.3109 (4.3 billion) addresses, which is inadequate for giving even one address to every living person, much less support the burgeoning market for connective devices. IPv6 supports 3.41038 addresses, or 51028(50 octillion) for each of the roughly 6.5 billion people alive today.    Invented by Steve Deering and Craig Mudge at Xerox PARC, IPv6 was adopted by the Internet Engineering Task Force in 1994, when it was called "IP Next Generation" (IPng). (Incidentally, IPv5 was not a successor to IPv4, but an experimental flow-oriented streaming protocol intended to support video and audio.)    As of December 2005, IPv6 accounts for a tiny percentage of the live addresses in the publicly-accessible Internet, which is still dominated by IPv4. The adoption of IPv6 has been slowed by the introduction of network address translation (NAT), which partially alleviates address exhaustion. The U.S. Government has specified that the network backbones of all federal agencies must deploy IPv6 by 2008.    It is expected that IPv4 will be supported alongside IPv6 for the foreseeable future.    IPv6 addresses are normally written as eight groups of four hexadecimal digits. For example, 2001:0db8:85a3:08d3:1319:8a2e:0370:7334 is a valid IPv6 address.    If a four-digit group is 0000, the zeros may be omitted. For example, 2001:0db8:85a3:0000:1319:8a2e:0370:7344 can be shortened as 2001:0db8:85a3::1319:8a2e:0370:7344. Following this rule, any group of consecutive 0000 groups may be reduced to two colons, as long as there is only one double colon used in an address. Thus, the addresses below are all valid and equivalent:    2001:0db8:0000:0000:0000:0000:1428:57a...  2001:0db8:0000:0000:0000::1428:57ab  2001:0db8:0:0:0:0:1428:57ab  2001:0db8:0::0:1428:57ab  2001:0db8::1428:57ab  Having more than one double-colon abbreviation in an address is invalid as it would make the notation ambiguous.    Leading zeros in a group can be omitted. Thus 2001:0db8:02de::0e13 may be shortened to 2001:db8:2de::e13.    A sequence of 4 bytes at the end of an IPv6 address can also be written in decimal, using dots as separators. This notation is often used with compatibility addresses (see below). Thus, ::ffff:1.2.3.4 is the same address as ::ffff:102:304.

If you have @yahoo.com email address you would need to switch to yahoo plus to use yahoo mail through outlook express.      Process for setting up your yahoo account in outlook expres :    From the Tools menu, choose "Accounts."   Select the "Mail" tab.   Click the "Add" button.   From the Add menu, click "Mail."   In the text box labeled Display Name, type your name and click "Next."   In the Email Address box, type your Yahoo! Mail address (be sure to include "@yahoo.com") and click "Next."   Under "My incoming mail server is a..." select "POP3."   Type "pop.mail.yahoo.com" in the Incoming Mail (POP3, IMAP, or HTTP) Server box.   Type "smtp.mail.yahoo.com" in the Outgoing Mail (SMTP) Server box.   Click "Next."   In the Account Name box, type your Yahoo! Mail ID (your email address without the "@yahoo.com").   In the Password box, type your Yahoo! Mail password.   If you want Outlook Express to remember your password, check the "Remember password" box.   Do not check the boxes labeled "Log on using Secure..."   Click "Next."   Click "Finish."  Important: The Yahoo! Mail SMTP server now requires authentication. To turn this setting on:     From the Tools menu, choose "Accounts."   Select the "Mail" tab.   Double-click the account labeled "pop.mail.yahoo.com."   Select the "Servers" tab.   Check the box next to "My Server Requires Authentication."   Click "OK."   To control deletion of messages from the Yahoo! Mail Server:     From the Tools menu, choose "Accounts."   Select the "Mail" tab.   Double-click the account labeled "pop.mail.yahoo.com."   Select the "Advanced" tab.   In the Delivery section at the bottom of the window, check "Leave a copy of messages on server" if you want to save your Yahoo! Mail messages on the Yahoo! Mail server as well as on your local computer. Do not check this box if you want your messages to be deleted from the Yahoo! Mail server once you have received them in Outlook Express.     If your ISP blocks port 25 or if you're unable to send email, then you will need to use port 587 when sending via Yahoo!'s SMTP server. To make this change, please follow the directions below:       From the "Tools" menu, select "Accounts"   Select your Yahoo! POP account and click on the "Properties" button   Click on the "Advanced" tab   Next to "Outgoing server (SMTP), change port 25 to 587   Click "Apply", then click "OK" and "Close"     Hope this helps.|`|1bbccae8afa7f8657458767541e5bf62aa	i've also had the same problem downloading from yahoo via outlook express and i also have tiscali as isp. given that it used to work very well between 2003 and early 2006 i don't think that there is a problem with the settings. it does work sometimes even now, but is very haphazard.  could there be a problem with tiscali?

Nearly all individual Internet service provider email accounts are accessed via POP3.    The Internet Message Access Protocol (commonly known as IMAP, and previously called Interactive Mail Access Protocol) is an application layer Internet protocol used for accessing email on a remote server from a local client. IMAP and POP3 (Post Office Protocol version 3) are the two most prevalent Internet standard protocols for email retrieval. Both are supported by virtually all modern email clients and servers.    Main difference between IMAP and POP3:    The POP3 protocol assumes the currently connected client is the only client connected to the mailbox. In contrast, the IMAP protocol specifically allows simultaneous access by multiple clients and provides mechanisms for clients to detect changes made to the mailbox by other, concurrently connected, clients.    Simple Mail Transfer Protocol (SMTP) is the de facto standard for email transmission across the Internet. SMTP is a relatively simple, text-based protocol, where one or more recipients of a message are specified (and in most cases verified to exist) and then the message text is transferred.|`|7f4984e93705b52de5e32e9c41354488aa	smtp is receiver email    pop is sender email    imap is taker from server

To fix this problem:    Open Outlook Express, and click Tools   Then click on Accounts   Then click on your Tiscali connection and click Properties   Then click Advanced   On this screen remove the checks from the boxes This server requires a secure connection for both Outgoing mail (SMTP) and Incoming mail (POP3).

Once you are in Outlook, click on Send/Receive button. If it does show any errors, then you have entered invalid email server settings. Correct them.  3.

As for the password is a bit trickier, and the password inside the file needs to be encrypted. For example the password encryption for the word 'test' is 'vq3OGHpnFivDI' (or something like that depending on the encryption you use), and it needs to be preceded by the username you created in the other file and a colon.<br>  <br>  For example let's say you want to have the username 'george' and the password 'bush'. <br>  <br>  You can open any text editor (not a word processor, something like Microsoft Word won't work, but Notepad will do the trick) and type  the word 'george' (minus the quotes) inside of it. then save the file with the name .htaccess (note that there is no other extension, like .txt, that is the WHOLE name).<br>  <br>  then create a new document, inside of it, type 'george:dyl5rNY6/mL0U' (minus the quotes) and save the file with the name .htpasswd (again no .txt after it)<br>  <br>  Upload them to your host account in ASCII mode.<br>  <br>  If you want to use a different password, here is a web site where you can get any word encrypted: <a href="http://users.abac.com/cgi-bin/pass.pl" rel="nofollow">http://users.abac.com/cgi-bin/pass.pl</a><br>  <br>  Keep in mind usernames and passwords need to be 2 to 16 characters, lower case letters or numbers only, no special characters. And also this will protect ALL files in that directory, there is no way to protect just one file with this method.|`|7941ed304d87e78feb6e83c8db829e93aa	Put a .htaccess file in the directory that contains the information you don't want to be seen.

u4pzeQ7Zaa	I am assuming the ISP you found in the rural area is a wireless provider or satellite provider. 20Mbps would be plenty fast enough to play xbox live. Now if it is a wireless provider you have to look at what could cause slow downs in service. Some have issues during bad weather and some have issue if they get over subscribed. With satellite you can have issues with bad weather and they can also slow your connection down if a contiunous download speeds are sustained such as if you were downloading large files or torrents. Might want to ask the ISP you found about some of these issues.<br>  <br>  Oh you should ask them what if they have garunteed speeds? The 20Mbps is a max or a peek speed that they use for adverting usually. See if you can find anyone else in the area using the same service and what they find with speeds and quality of service.

However, given that you have USB 2.0 to overcome a bandwidth bottleneck from the use of two cameras, it is possible to connect two from DIFFERENT manufacturers.  This comes into play with the drivers and port recognition (all the USB ports tend to share the same address because most computers have 1 USB hub built-in).  I don't think there's any special software for it, because I've never seen it.  There is video editing software that does accept input from multiple sources simultaneously.  I'm not exactly sure what you're trying to do.|`|AA10632429	I've set up as many as 6 webcams from the same computer :-)  Use a USB cord splitter -- the kind that has 4 plugins on one side and plugs into your usb outlet on the other. It WILL be slower or the video quality not as good if you do it this way, but on my computer it worked for running 2 cameras for each of my computer's original USB ports. My cameras were 3 different brands.    You do NOT need a program if you're not wanting to display them all at the same time (like if you have one camera being used by yahoo, another being used by MSN, another being used by AIM...). ... but if you want someone to see ALL your cameras at the same time, you do need to be running special software.     I used webcamxp because it's VERY user friendly. The program is pretty self explanatory (click on a box and select the source you want the box to display).      The only thing with webcamxp (and other programs, I assume) is that you will need to figure out the ports thing--- our cable company blocks the default port (8080). There's documentation and help on the site though...    Another useful source is splitcamera -- you can split your camera stream so that the person on Yahoo is seeing the same thing as the person on MSN or whatever (I used it to split the same camera image between 3 different sites and programs, including webcamxp).     A great place to ask about more technical webcam stuff, btw, are amateur "adult" boards or places like ifriends -- those people do it to make $$ and know what they're talking about (and rarely snotty)...|`|AA11384977	If you have 2 usb ports you should be able to just set them both up the same way.
b01b9b8b0e203b0d4b6a0a8d1710068aaa	WINS stands for Windows Internet Naming Service     The purpose of WINS is to allow a NetBIOS name to be converted to an IP address. Therefore computers using WINS must be using NBT (NetBIOS over TCP/IP). WINS was originally put in place to compensate for a shortcoming of NetBEUI which is the fact that it is not routable. Therefore on large Networks IP is used to transport NetBIOS and rather than using broadcasts, information is sent to the WINS server.  The WINS server solves the problems inherent in resolving NetBIOS names through IP broadcasts, and frees network administrators from the demands of updating static mapping files, such as LMHOST files. WINS, which is compliant with the NetBIOS Name Server (NBNS) RFCs (1001/1002), also automatically updates the WINS database when dynamic addressing through DHCP results in new IP addresses for computers that move between subnets. Neither the user nor the network administrator needs to make manual accommodations for such name resolutions.    Steps for installing WINS server  http://www.microsoft.com/technet/archive...|`|AA12356578	WINS is Windows Naming Server, this is used by a Microsoft Windows network to provide name resolution of NETBIOS names (Computer Names)    But with the Advent of Microsoft windows Active directory, WINS has lost it importance and now DNS is used by Windows Network predominantly for the NAme resolution.

AA12349888	What is CDP?    1)The Cisco Discovery Protocol (CDP) is a protocol for discovering devices on a network. Each CDP-compatible device sends periodic messages to a well-known multicast address. Devices discover each other by listening at that address.    2)CDP operation can be enabled or disabled on the FastHub through the object cdpInterfaceEnable. When enabled, the network management module (NMM) SNMP agent discovers neighboring devices and builds its local cache with information about these devices    HOW CDP WORKS?    1)CDP is a media and protocol independent protocol that runs on all Cisco-manufactured equipment including routers, bridges, access and communication servers, and switches.  Using CDP, you can view information about all the Cisco devices directly attached to the switch.  In addition, CDP detects native VLAN and port duplex mismatches.    2)Network management applications can retrieve the device type and SNMP-agent address of neighboring Cisco devices using CDP.  This enables applications to send SNMP queries to neighboring devices.  CDP allows network management applications to discover Cisco devices that are neighbors of already known devices, in particular, neighbors running lower-layer, transparent protocols.    3)CDP runs on all media that support Subnetwork Access Protocol (SNAP), including LAN and Frame Relay.  CDP runs over the Data Link layer only.  Cisco devices never forward CDP packets.  When new CDP information is received, Cisco devices discard old information.|`|AA11022617	Cisco Discovery Protocol (CDP) is primarily used to obtain protocol addresses of neighboring devices and discover the platform of those devices.

CDP can also be used for On-Demand Routing (ODR) which is a method of including routing information in CDP announcements so that dynamic routing protocols do not need to be used in simple networks.

You would have to turn it on.. you can do this by going to control panel on your laptop.  You would have an option for Bluetooth devices, in case you are using Windows XP you would have to switch to classic view for control panel as in Windows XP default view Bluetooth device icon wont be visible.  Double click on the icon, in there you would have options.  Select all the options, press apply and then ok.  Then again go back to the bluetooth icon and goto devices and then click on add, the follow the onscreen instructions.

b01b9b8b0e203b0d4b6a0a8d1710068aaa	Steps to creating Wireless LAN.    Choose a Flavor of Wi-Fi     Your choice is 802.11b/g (2.4GHz), 802.11a (5GHz), or dual-band that includes both 802.11b/g and 802.11a.   For most applications, 802.11b/g will suffice. You'll have up to 54Mbps data rates with fairly good capacity. The slower (11Mbps) 802.11b is interoperable with nearly all wireless LAN enabled devices, and probably considerably cheaper -- if you can even find them anymore.    Purchase a Wi-Fi Router  Something to keep in mind is that you need a Wi-Fi router, not an access point. Unlike an access point, a router supplies the necessary network layer functions, such as network address translation (NAT) and dynamic host configuration protocol (DHCP). This enables multiple devices on the network, such as PCs, laptops, PDAs, and printers, to share the single official IP address that a broadband ISP supplies. If you connect an access point directly to the broadband modem, usually only one device on your network will receive an IP address -- the access point itself.     Centralize the Router Installation  Install the router within reach of the broadband modem, using Ethernet patch cable. If you haven't already had a broadband connection established, consider having it installed somewhere central to the areas where you'll be using the wireless network. This is typically the center of the home.     Ideally, install the broadband connection in the same room as any device (such as a printer) that you want to connect to one of the Ethernet ports provided by the router. With two floors, choose installation on the floor where you'll be using the network a higher percentage of the time.     Default Settings Gets Things Going  Default configuration settings on the router will enable users to immediately associate and begin accessing broadband Internet services. Most routers have DHCP already enabled for obtaining the official IP address from the ISP through the broadband modem, and DHCP and NAT are ready on the router to hand out private IP addresses to user devices.     This truly makes the router installation straightforward. Normally, all you have to do is plug in the router and users will readily associate and have access to Internet applications. Be sure, however, to follow vendor-specific installation instructions.    Configure Security Mechanisms  By default, most routers don't have any security enabled, which means that all data packets are sent unencrypted in the clear. A unscrupulous person sitting in a car outside your home, for example, can wirelessly monitor these transmissions and see e-mail contents, user names, and passwords. In addition, unauthorized users can access files on computers inside the home and use the Internet through your broadband ISP connection.     If you don't want this to happen, then activate encryption supplied within your router. Wired equivalent privacy (WEP) is better than nothing, but take advantage of the more advanced Wi-Fi protected access (WPA) if it is available.     plus some more links below giving you more info on setting up wireless network.|`|afd4b8038842a4a59005b24c49ff3895aa	It depends.  Simplest solution, you will need the following:  1. wireless adapter on each laptop  2. wireless access point/router  3. Assuming you are using windows and all you want to do is be able to "talk" to each other: ensure all computers are in the same workgroup/domain, under the network connection properties enable file and printer sharing, share some folders (if you want).  4. If successful, all computers should be visible in network neighborhood    If what you want is a full-featured LAN with authentication, etc., the complexity and the cost will be higher.  See the link in the sources for an example.

b01b9b8b0e203b0d4b6a0a8d1710068aaa	Fragmented simply means the file is not stored in one place in its entirety, or what computer folks like to call a contiguous location. Different parts of the file are scattered across the hard disk in noncontiguous pieces. The more fragmented files there are on a drive, the more performance and reliability suffer as the drive heads have to search for all the pieces in different locations.   The scattering of parts of the same disk file over different areas of the disk. Fragmentation occurs as files on a disk are deleted and new files are added.

If it is so...boot up system in safe mode, by pressing `F8 ' key while booting is taking place & remove that program while PC is working in safe mode.  3.In case that too do not helps & if that program is just newly installed you have option of system restore in `help' .  4.If you are aware of `msconfig' file...run it & disable the start up of that program while windows start up & the remove it from system.        I will suggest you to try 1st option & 2nd option before going to 3rd or 4th .  Thanks :)
b01b9b8b0e203b0d4b6a0a8d1710068aaa	First of all rememeber for the future that you shud never compress the primary partition (one where your OS is installed).    The NTLDR file is compressed. Because NTLDR runs before the Operating System is installed, normal booting is prevented as there is no way to decompress it.    Now to over come this problem you would need to install recovery console for Windows XP.    Steps to install recovery console :    if you can get hold of the full installation disk, try the following:    First you need to set your PC to boot from CD, to do this you need to check a setting in the BIOS.    To Enter The BIOS:    Usually tapping the F8 key as the PC starts will bring up the BIOS [F2 is quite common as well].    Once in there you are looking for Boot Sequence, you navigate by using the up and down arrows, selection is by hitting the Enter key.    Put your CD in the drive.    Save changes [F10 key or select the option]    When your PC reboots you may be asked to "Press any key to boot from CD"    Do so.    Lots of files and things will load and eventually you get to a screen asking if you want to Install Windows, Carry out a repair or Exit.    At this point press the R key-this will take you to the Recovery Console [black screen, white writing - looks like DOS]    You will be asked which Windows you want to log into press 1    Hopefully you have no Admin password and pressing Return at that prompt will take you to the next prompt.      after installing recovery console you would need to run the follwoing command from    the Recovery Console prompt run these commands:  CD \    ATTRIB -C NTLDR    hope this helps.|`|AA11623590	first off, never compress entire disks, esspecially your primary.    take your computer into a professional.

To activate Content Advisor, you set yourself up as the Supervisor of Content with a password. Don't lose it!    1. On the Internet Explorer Tools menu, click Internet Options.      2. Click the Content tab, and click the Enable button.     3. In the Content Advisor box, click the General tab, and then click the Create Password button.      4. In the Create Supervisor Password box, type the password you want to use.    5. In the Confirm Password box, type the same password again.  Internet Explorer requires this to make sure you haven't made a typing error.      6. In the Hint box, type a hint to help you remember your password, and then click OK.  Make sure the hint is one your child won't know the answer to. If you can't come up with something, leave it blank. (But then, of course, you're on your own if you forget the password!)      7. Click OK in response to the message about Content Advisor, and then click OK once more.  Now every time you bump into Content Advisor's protective walls, you'll need to type the supervisor password to get through.    Limit Access to Web Sites  With Content Advisor activated, you can create a list of Web sites that can always be viewed by your family. If someone attempts to access a Web site that is not on your approved list, they will be prompted for the Content Advisor Supervisor password to proceed. To create your list of approved and disapproved Web sites, activate Content Advisor using the instructions above and then follow these steps:    1. On the Internet Explorer Tools menu, click Internet Options.      2. Click the Content tab, and click the Settings button.      3. You will be prompted for the Supervisor password. Enter your password and click OK.      4. In the Content Advisor box, click the Approved Sites tab.      5. In the field for Allow this Web site, type in the Web address that you want to allow or disapprove.      6. Click the Always button to add the site to your list of approved Web sites. Or you can click the Never button to restrict access to the site. To remove a site from your list of approved and disapproved sites, click the site name, and then click the Remove button.      7. When you're finished, click OK.|`|AA10535164	you can go to toold from your internet explorer and click on tools and internet options and then click on security tab>>Restricted sites>>click on sites and you can add those porn sites that you dont wnna to be accessible.|`|AA10112700	You really don't need to. Just teach your kids to be careful on the Internet. Filtering software has been known to block fine art, breast cancer information and sex education sites.    One thing I would block is the release of personal information. Most Firewalls come with a feature to detect an address, phone number or credit card number as it is about to be sent, and block it.    However, if you feel you must use a filter:    Despite what some people seem to think, Internet Explorer is not the only browser available. Upon seeing that a site is blocked in IE, somebody could just install Firefox (speaking of Firefox, it's a much better browser than IE. You can download it from getfirefox.com), Opera, Maxthon, Netscape or any number of alternative browsers. Thus, blocking websites from inside IE is a very bad idea.    I would try seeing if your Firewall has a content blocking system hidden away somewhere. Otherwise, I hear Cyber Patrol is pretty good.|`|9c8bda6e7b634e7d6b175fdb499f6645aa	I use Trend Micro Security. It has a very good firewall.

Turn off your moded, computer, monitor in this order. Let stand for a couple of minutes. Restart everything in reverse order.  A cluttered DSL modem can cause this.    If that doesn't do it, then do this. Tools>Internet Options>General tab> go down and Delete Cookies, Delete Temp Files, and just below delete the history. Go back up to the Setting button and click. Go down to the box with the number and up/down arrows. Reduce that number to 50, but not higher than 100. 50 is prefered. Click the Apply and OK buttons.    This should clear up any problems. If not then go here and tell Yahoo Mail. It could be on their end. Do the above first, cause that is what they will tell you to do.

b01b9b8b0e203b0d4b6a0a8d1710068aaa	You create an Adjacent domain document when you need to restrict the transfer of mail from one adjacent domain to another. For example, if you are in domain B and want to prevent mail from an adjacent domain A from traversing your domain to reach another adjacent domain C, create an Adjacent domain document that names C as the adjacent domain and denies mail from A.     Non-adjacent domains are Domino domains that are not directly connected, but have an intermediary domain, adjacent to both of them in common. For example, domain A and domain B are adjacent and have Connection documents defining the route between them. Similarly, domain B, in turn, is adjacent to domain C and mutual Connection documents exist between them; and domains C and D are likewise adjacent to each other and linked by Connection documents. Domain B is thus adjacent to domain A on one side, and domain C on the other; and domain C is adjacent to B and D, respectively. If no direct connection exists between A and C, these two domains are considered to be non-adjacent domains. Similarly if there is no direct connection between B and D, these two domains are also non-adjacent.     hope this helps

tOCESHLYaa	I got this from About.com I think it explains it very well.  If your antivirus encounters an infected file, there are generally three options available: clean, quarantine, or delete. If the wrong option is selected, the results can be catastrophic. And if it's a false positive, such a mishap can be even more frustrating and damaging.    As an example, if you instruct your antivirus software to delete all infected files, those that were infected by a true file infecting virus could also be deleted. This could impact the normal features and functionality of your operating system or programs you use. On the other hand, antivirus software can't 'clean' a worm or a trojan, because there is nothing to clean - the entire file IS the worm or trojan. Quarantine plays a nice middle ground, because it moves the file to safe storage under control of the antivirus program - so it can't harm your system - but it's there in case a mistake was made and you need to restore that file.
1NBe2Jo7aa	The 750w might work, but I wouldn't risk it as it could damage your motherboard. Also, don't trust dell customer support, they don't know anything! They just don't want you to make upgrades to your computer because it is just easier for them that way. You really don't need the 750w though, I don't know what you could fit inside a dell vostro that would use that much power. Only thing I can think of that would use that much power would be an overclocked i7 and two graphics cards running in sli or crossfire (you won't be able to fit two graphics cards in a dell vostro, nor will you be able to fit a high end card like a 290gtx inside it). Plus, it is a common misconception that the more power you get, the better, as if you don't need the power, it will cause a shorter lifespan of the psu and other components and will cause more noise. I would stick with 500w, although I don't think you need that psu that says it is dell compatible, as I am pretty sure dell moved the vostro and inspiron desktop psu's to standard atx power supplies from the old proprietary psus. Hope this helps!!|`|vc3maF3Faa	Yes it may damage your computer ! You said that Dell has only 9A input and the one you want is 12A , so there is a 3A difference and it can heat up your motherboard especially if you'll be using it for several hours everyday. To be safe, get a compatible PSU for your computer !|`|6594714b8deeef4517df131be9164157aa	Also in that tower the room for the power supply is small. A normal psu may not fit in that space.

b7w8JaWzaa	not sure about ati but for nvidia one powerful is for sure better than 2 sli.  The reason is cause one if you have xp , xp doesnt not support sli very well and you will get many problems and bugs.  also NOT all games support sli even if you do have vista so what happens is say you use 2 9800gt and u play this game that does not support sli, the game will run crappier than as if you are only using 1 9800gt card.  just buy one powerful card, saves u money on psu too|`|jHgLq9boaa	im building a computer and im going ATI crossfire dual HD4650 thier ok cards but both have GDDR2 1Gb of graphics memory and dual SLI Nvidia 9800 would be similar. for my computer to run dual HD4650 i need around 400watts of power which isnt much. but if you want one decent card for windows vista that is i would get a Nvidia GTX285 or the ATI GDDR5 2Gb one forget wat its called. they are quite pricy but they will be worth it

2arZOZWgaa	I think what you are talking about is the wattage required of the power supply to safely run the CPU.     To determine how many watts in a power supply you need, you add up all the components wattage needs and then add maybe 50w or so for a little leverage and peace of mind.    Maybe you should show me the review you were reading.    EDIT: There is not an easy way to figure it how much your power supply can handle. First, you need to know how many watts your power supply is. The only way to do that is to take off the side of the computer and look at the side of the power supply for the number. The parts you have to worry about are the video card, the motherboard, and the CPU. Their watt requirements usually can be found in the manuals that come with them.    I found this to explain the numbers: "Processor manufacturers usually release two power consumption numbers for a CPU, the typical thermal power, which is measured under normal load, and the maximum thermal power, which is measured under a worst-case set of instructions. For example, the Pentium 4 2.8 GHz has 68.4 W typical thermal power and 85 W maximum thermal power. When the CPU is idle, it will draw far less than the typical thermal power."  The whole article can be found here: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CPU_power_d...    As far as determining whether a CPU will work with a certain motherboard, look at the socket size. The motherboard you have supports AM2+ and the CPU you want is just that. I think everything should work.

Remember, flickr is part of yahoo.  4 - I've been on flickr for a long time and it seems safe to me. Although, there are some dodgy people... but it's rare to come across them, and there is something on flickr that tells you if something is marked as unsafe.  5 - Not that I've heard, haha.

Theres a decent guide covering this that you can work through at My Slow PC (http://www.MySlowPC.co.uk/)  click on the Troubleshooting link.  Heres my advice from it:    1.) Turn System Restore OFF so any infection that you remove is not restored.    2.) Scan with a combination of the best detection utilities as youll find different scanners can sometimes pick up different infections.  E.g.       * McAfee Stinger  a free stand-alone utility used to detect and remove specific viruses.     * SpyBot Search & Destroy  a spyware/adware scanner     * Lavasoft Adaware  for spyware/adware    Note  it might be a good idea to disconnect your network connection once youve updated them with the latest virus/spyware definitions.  This is due to the fact that often an infection is trying to spread over your network.    3.) If the above fails or youre not sure if youre still infected, when you start your PC tap the F8 key, select Safe Mode and repeat the scans once youre connected.    I hope the above helps, as mentioned the guide above is a lot more detailed and the My Slow PC site is pretty useful.  Good luck!|`|PMOhhTFAaa	You could try AVG or Avast.

Fp0jrUtOaa	Spybot Search & Destroy still gets pretty good rankings.  The last time I saw a bench-test on the effectiveness of anti-spyware tools, they were in the top 5 or so.    Disturbingly, though, none of the rated tools found much more than 60% of the spyware in the test.  (For comparison, antivirus applications are mature enough to identify 99.9...% of viruses.)  The strong implication from the study was that you should have and regularly run two different programs.  There will be some overlap but there will also be a good chance that your secondary program will be able to deal with at least some of the spyware that your primary program missed.|`|HaYgmffHaa	Its a good tool for its extra features however, the best removal tools these days are superantispyware and malwarebytes antimalware.

af8f6770b15b6c503e14747e6605b2d3aa	Professional Edition: Superset of Home Edition  At its most basic level, XP Professional is a business- and power-user oriented superset of Home Edition. Because this orientation, it includes features that wouldn't be appropriate, or would be too complex, for the typical home user. The most obvious difference is security, which is vastly simplified in Home Edition. Each interactive user in XP Home is assumed to be a member of the Owners local group, which is the Windows XP equivalent of the Windows 2000 Administrator account: This means that anyone who logs on to a Home Edition machine has full control. Likewise, the Backup Operators, Power Users, and Replicator groups from Windows 2000/XP Pro are missing from Home Edition, and a new group, called Restricted Users, is added. Hidden administrative shares (C$, etc.) are also unavailable in Home Edition.|`|AA10368751	The prof. vs. home is very simple.  With prof. you get windows networking capability.  Like joining domain and forest.  Supposely, the prof. and home are identical product except for minor difference in the registry which turns on and off product feature.  If your not planning to deploy a 2003 server and use domain for logging then you'd be fine using home.    To answer your question, you have to know a little about hacking.  Most window hacking comes from vunerabilities the windows comes with.  For example, most window when installed uses the default "workstation" work group.  This is dangerous since any hacker can guess the "workstation" work group as being default, combines with your IP and "careless" folder sharing enabled, you can let anyone hack in to your prof. or home with ease.  The trick is what and how to protect your computer.  I'd strongly suggest you let a professional pc guys help you secure your computer.  Just installing protection software doesn't do the trick, it needs to be configured properly.    A really good professional pc guys will configure everything from your firewall to pc.  Pc guy can securely locked down such that no external hacker can be let in no matter how good they are.  However, there's no software or patch that can fix user mistake like clicking a fake site to give out your login/password or opening a wrong file.    A final word, when I say a pc guy, I usually mean a guy with good 10 to 15 year experience dealing wtih pc.  If pc guy isn't available take it to a local ma&pa pc shop that's been around a long time.|`|AA10613315	I do everything mentioned above on XP Home.

Prof is usually for business or heavy computer users that want more control over there PC. The only limits on home that really matter are networking. You can only have a certain amount of network clinets... and i dont think that is going to bother you. As long as you have SP2 i would say both are as protected as each other.
RoMxIa1Jaa	Ad-Aware is useless, and Spybot is better for immunization than for detection and removal.    Download, update, and run a full system scan with either Superantispyware or Malwarebytes Anti-Malware, or both.    > Superantispyware: http://www.superantispyware.com/  > Malwarebytes Anti-Malware: http://www.malwarebytes.org/mbam.php    *** And stay away from that Antispyware 2009 as suggested by Sir Lucious.|`|dkpIjt5jaa	Two affirmations to start: 1) Do not reformat or use system restore to start from new as it is too harsh and you should do it only as a last resort.    2) Do not copy your documents elsewhere as this will only spread the Malware and do NOT use your Email until this is cleaned.    Now for the main part: You have Malware, deeply rooting itself in your system (some even hide in your router's firmware). Virus scanners and the Restore Point Utility are not good things to use against such invasion for this reason alone.    Get the programs I listed from another computer (Internet Caf, Public Library or friend's computer) onto a USB stick as Malware blocks you from downloading protection. A word of caution, be sure to read all programs help files completely before using them. If you still cannot use MBAM, rename it Alteregobytes to confuse the Malware (but be sure to keep the .exe extension on it) and use it as alternative for part A of the following solution.    TRYING MBAM ALONE IS NOT ENOUGH AS YOU NEED A COMPLETE SOLUTION, here is one (use programs in the order stated):    A) Download MBAM (MalwareBytes' Anti-Malware): http://www.download.com/Malwarebytes-Ant... - Install the application and make sure a checkmark is placed next to Update Malwarebytes' Anti-Malware and Launch Malwarebytes' Anti-Malware, then click Finish ( If an update is found, it will download and install the latest version ).    Once the program has loaded, select "Perform Quick Scan", then click Scan ( The scan may take some time,so please be patient ). When the scan is complete, click OK, then Show Results to view the results. Make sure that everything is checked, and click Remove Selected ( When disinfection is completed, a log will open in Notepad and you may be prompted to Restart ).      B) Try the tricks and free programs I use: 1) Clean browsers junk.    Method One (now): In Internet Explorer (IE), click the Tools menu, then Delete Browsing History and in the box, click the Delete all button (bottom left) and Yes.  In Firefox (FF), go to tools, clear private data, make sure all boxes are checked and then click on the clear private data now button.    Method Two (Normal use: Every 14 days - Heavy use: Every 7 days): In IE, click the Tools menu, Delete Browsing History and in the box that opens, do these: a) click the button near Temporary Internet Files, click Yes and wait for the box that opens to close.  b) click the button near History, click Yes and wait for the box that opens to close and finally, click the close button (bottom right) to finish.    In FF, Go to tools, clear private data and uncheck all except Browsing History, Cache and Authenticated Sessions boxes then click on the clear private data now button.    Note: Close browser when done to clear cookies still in memory. For other browsers or versions of the programs, check help files for guidance on doing cleanup.    2) Turn off the restore point utility ( Guide for XP: http://support.microsoft.com/kb/310405 and Vista: http://windowshelp.microsoft.com/Windows... )    3) Use this free cleaner: http://www.glaryutilities.com/gu.html to remove junk and remnants files.    4) Use your "Disk defragmenter".    5) Turn restore point utility back on. (see part 2)    6) Do not use toolbars (chances of spyware).    7) Persisting problem after this, get Avira: http://www.download.com/Avira-AntiVir-Pe... plus an Email scanner ( http://www.spamdel.com/ OR http://www.glenn.delahoy.com/software/fi... ) or if you already have a scanner, make sure its database is updated BUT stay away from (or get rid of) AVG free (no good).    8) If the problem is very stubborn and you have a router, visit its web site and check for firmware that is more recent than your version. If FOUND, download and install, if NOT, use the router's reset switch, both methods return it to factory settings. "WARNING": Gather router install CDs, guides, passwords before doing this as you will need to do all connections again.      By doing so, you are on your way to being well protected BUT never relax your guard !    P.S.: Forward this message to all the friends you exchanged Email with since you started getting this problem but only after you have completely eradicated it !|`|ULw1777caa	Pick one there are plenty.

Here are some problems you have to overcome...    1: Stop asking for help concerning possibly illegal activities.  2: Learn how to be self sufficient.  3: Learn C, C++, Perl, Python, X86 assembly and shell scripting  4: Learn Linux inside out from the command prompt. No Xwindows.  5: Buy several computers to run all this stuff on.  6: Learn networking and firewalls inside out.  7: Learn how to use Google and other search engines.  8: Study source code for flaws.  9: Study all the legal and ethical ramifications of your intended actions.  10: Learn how to keep secrets and tell no one.    In a few years you might be capable of actually doing what you think you want to do. You'll need to be really motivated. You'll have no life. No dating, no friends.    As one answerer suggested, go ahead and look at Backtrack 3. Then someone with Helix 2008 or other possibly expensive forensics tools will be saving your mess as evidence. After that, some nice law enforcement type will come knocking and have a nice chat with you. Shortly after that you'll probably receive a nice summons. Get to talk to a nice judge and a lawyer or two. And after that maybe have a nice chat with your cell mate Bubba. This is just one possible outcome of your actions. Don't ever think for a second that you won't get caught.    Oh and as for your hacking kit. Did you try Hacking Kits R Us? I think they were having a BOGO sale. You might want to try Amazon also.

B) Try the tricks and free programs I use: 1) Clean browsers junk.    Method One (now): In Internet Explorer (IE), click the Tools menu, then Delete Browsing History and in the box, click the Delete all button (bottom left) and Yes.  In Firefox (FF), go to tools, clear private data, make sure all boxes are checked and then click on the clear private data now button.    Method Two (Normal use: Every 14 days - Heavy use: Every 7 days): In IE, click the Tools menu, Delete Browsing History and in the box that opens, do these: a) click the button near Temporary Internet Files, click Yes and wait for the box that opens to close.  b) click the button near History, click Yes and wait for the box that opens to close and finally, click the close button (bottom right) to finish.    In FF, Go to tools, clear private data and uncheck all except Browsing History, Cache and Authenticated Sessions boxes then click on the clear private data now button.    Note: Close browser when done to clear cookies still in memory. For other browsers or versions of the programs, check help files for guidance on doing cleanup.    2) Turn off the restore point utility ( Guide for XP: http://support.microsoft.com/kb/310405 and Vista: http://windowshelp.microsoft.com/Windows... )    3) Use this free cleaner: http://www.glaryutilities.com/gu.html to remove junk and remnants files.    4) Use your "Disk defragmenter".    5) Turn restore point utility back on. (see part 2)    6) Do not use toolbars (chances of spyware).    7) Persisting problem after this, as you already have a scanner, make sure its database is updated.    8) If the problem is very stubborn and you have a router, visit its web site and check for firmware that is more recent than your version. If FOUND, download and install, if NOT, use the router's reset switch, both methods return it to factory settings. "WARNING": Gather router install CDs, guides, passwords before doing this as you will need to do all connections again.      By doing so, you are on your way to being well protected BUT never relax your guard !

You may want to contact ATI or Dell to see if the graphics card will be compatible.

Remove the cover on your computer tower.  This is usually done by removing screws on the back of the tower or by pressing the release (if equipped) on the back of the tower.  2. make sure the computer is turned off and unplugged.  3. Before touching anything, either wear a grounding strap or work on a surface that does not have carpet and touch the metal case of your power supply to remove any static electricity your body may have built up.  4. Disconnect the power cable that is plugged in the back of the hard drive.  5. Disconnect the ribbon cable that is plugged in the back of the hard drive.  6. Remove the 2 to 4 screws on the sides of the hard drive.  7. Slide hard drive out of the rack.    Installation is in reverse order...although if you are putting in a new hard drive, it will have to be formatted before use.  Hope this helps!

f13c56892e11d84c2873b37622c95f9daa	I would highly recommend a clean install of XP.  First, download all drivers from the internet for your system(Video, audio, NIC, USB drivers, printer drivers, etc.)    My recommendations on an upgrade are:  1) backup all information to a cd/USB stick/external hard drive.  - this is incase something goes wrong, and you might lose information, or you choose the wrong selection and your HD is wiped out.  2) Purchase a new Hard drive, and install XP on it. Make your old hard drive the second drive, now a backup drive. Install all software on the new XP drive, make sure everything is updated/working, then transfer your data from  2 to  1. This way, if you make a mistake/install error/incompatibility error with XP, you can simply remove  1, and plug  2 as the original, and you are back and running  - this method is overall the fastest and most reliable. Besides, it's time for a bigger drive,faster drive, and one that is more reliable.    - also, this will give you a fresh, faster system than an upgrade.  If you can, upgrade RAM to minimum 512MB.    If you need more help, email me!|`|971219b7b9676f36e1d3018b525db8e1aa	Save the data you want, make a backup to a CD-RW, then install XP, then put all your files from the backup onto the XP.

Almost every animation you have seen on the web is most likely a product of Flash. You can find more information on Flash at http://www.adobe.com under Products.    However, Flash is not so good for making 3D graphics. I would suggest Erain's Swift 3D. I find it extremely easy to use, and it also quite compatible with Flash.

Good security requires a multi-layered approach, and the least important layer by far is running some kind of anti-malware program (in fact, if you take care of all the other layers, you don't even need an anti-malware program using up extra resources).    In order of importance:    1. Create and use almost exclusively a limited user account instead of the default administrator account Windows sets you up with    2. Read up on social engineering and how to avoid it    3. Don't download illegal copies of software, music, or movies    4. Set Windows updates to install automatically    5. Make regular backups. If possible, back up your entire installation (using Norton Ghost or Acronis True Image)|`|tOCESHLYaa	You need a current anti-virus program. There is new malware released  every day.

I would be willing to bet that it is the power inverter on it's way out the door. If it were to supply poorly regulated voltages, it could cause the issues you mentioned.    Especially if it is a poor solder joint or some other circuit issue, as the monitor warms up the circuits expand and make a better connection thus causing the issue to fade away.    There is no guarantee, but a replacement inverter could solve the issue and it is much cheaper than the alternative.    Ebay would be your best bet, or a local repair shop should be able to order the part for you if you are inclined to try the replacement on your own.|`|n2lxsCiUaa	no the Ultrasharp monitors aint cheap!! but they are the best around and yours is failing , i thought they had a three year warrenty? make them give you another

9fHm7zb8aa	It seems like your operating system installation is corrupt. Try reinstalling your operating system.    Though, it could just as well be your power supply if the reboots happen at various points (eg. midway during bootup). Just because it turns on doesn't mean it works. It has to continuously supply a stable amount of power for the entire duration the computer is on. It may simply be that at one point of bootup, the power supplied isn't reliable enough to handle the load, thus causing the reboot.    However, I suggest you try reinstalling the OS first. The PSU is a pain to swap and you don't really lose anything by reinstalling your OS.

Now for the main part: You may have Malware, deeply rooting itself in your system (some even hide in your router's firmware). Virus scanners and the Restore Point Utility are not good things to use against such invasion for this reason alone.    Get the programs I listed from another computer (Internet Caf, Public Library or friend's computer) onto a USB stick as Malware blocks you from downloading protection. A word of caution, be sure to read all programs help files completely before using them. If you still cannot use MBAM, rename it Alteregobytes to confuse the Malware (but be sure to keep the .exe extension on it) and use it as alternative for part A of the following solution.    TRYING MBAM ALONE IS NOT ENOUGH AS YOU NEED A COMPLETE SOLUTION, here is one (use programs in the order stated):    A) Download MBAM (MalwareBytes' Anti-Malware): http://www.download.com/Malwarebytes-Ant... - Install the application and make sure a checkmark is placed next to Update Malwarebytes' Anti-Malware and Launch Malwarebytes' Anti-Malware, then click Finish ( If an update is found, it will download and install the latest version ).    Once the program has loaded, select "Perform Quick Scan", then click Scan ( The scan may take some time,so please be patient ). When the scan is complete, click OK, then Show Results to view the results. Make sure that everything is checked, and click Remove Selected ( When disinfection is completed, a log will open in Notepad and you may be prompted to Restart ).      B) Try the tricks and free programs I use: 1) Clean browsers junk.    Method One (now): In Internet Explorer (IE), click the Tools menu, then Delete Browsing History and in the box, click the Delete all button (bottom left) and Yes.  In Firefox (FF), go to tools, clear private data, make sure all boxes are checked and then click on the clear private data now button.    Method Two (Normal use: Every 14 days - Heavy use: Every 7 days): In IE, click the Tools menu, Delete Browsing History and in the box that opens, do these: a) click the button near Temporary Internet Files, click Yes and wait for the box that opens to close.  b) click the button near History, click Yes and wait for the box that opens to close and finally, click the close button (bottom right) to finish.    In FF, Go to tools, clear private data and uncheck all except Browsing History, Cache and Authenticated Sessions boxes then click on the clear private data now button.    Note: Close browser when done to clear cookies still in memory. For other browsers or versions of the programs, check help files for guidance on doing cleanup.    2) Turn off the restore point utility ( Guide for XP: http://support.microsoft.com/kb/310405 and Vista: http://windowshelp.microsoft.com/Windows... )    3) Use this free cleaner: http://www.glaryutilities.com/gu.html to remove junk and remnants files.    4) Use your "Disk defragmenter".    5) Turn restore point utility back on. (see part 2)    6) Do not use toolbars (chances of spyware).    7) Persisting problem after this, get Avira: http://www.download.com/Avira-AntiVir-Pe... plus an Email scanner ( http://www.spamdel.com/ OR http://www.glenn.delahoy.com/software/fi... ) or if you already have a scanner, make sure its database is updated BUT stay away from (or get rid of) AVG free (no good).    8) If the problem is very stubborn and you have a router, visit its web site and check for firmware that is more recent than your version. If FOUND, download and install, if NOT, use the router's reset switch, both methods return it to factory settings. "WARNING": Gather router install CDs, guides, passwords before doing this as you will need to do all connections again.      By doing so, you are on your way to being well protected BUT never relax your guard !|`|NtpzGR0Aaa	why don't change the password?|`|PvPZYFr5aa	Inform the provider of your account.

It can only actually deliver whatever the system asks for.

wUqeZl3Saa	The procedure below can make your system crash or not boot at all. Malware sometimes renames and replaces existing files in such a way that incorrect removal could render your operating system useless. You have been warned.    If you have a good firewall that blocks outgoing communications, then you have a chance to catch malware as it is trying to get out. That doesn't mean it can catch everything. This is just one possible warning. There may be other unusual activity when malware is involved.    Run and examine the log file from HijackThis. The program was originally designed to combat the coolweb search hijacker, but it is a good tool that will read most of the possible run locations for other types of malware. Many forget about the win.ini and system.ini "run" sections that are still used for backward compatibility. Also there is the obvious start section in the regular start/programs/startup menu. Make notes on the full file paths and registry locations of any suspect files.    Research the file name(s) with Google. See if other people have identified the problem or if it is an actual program that belongs there. Sometimes this will turn up fix solutions and possible removal tools.    There are several tricks to short circuiting malware. Once you have it identified, reboot to the command prompt only. Not even safe mode and no networking. For safety, only change the name(s) of the suspected malware and add the new file name to your notes. Changing the name stops it from being executed automatically and leaves a chance to restore the file in case it breaks something and really wasn't malware.     Once you have the name(s) changed and you are sure it saved the changes, unplug the computer. Some malware checks to see if it is still in the registry among other things so that it can stay in your computer. By unplugging, you bypass any checks and prevent them from being written. The malware may even be running in the command prompt mode and we want to prevent it from doing anything.    Reboot your computer in normal mode. If you did your job right in the previous steps, the malware has been rendered harmless. Hit CTRL-ALT-DEL and check your running processes. If all is well, start/run/regedit and remove the entries from your registry from your notes. If HijackThis found them, you can simply run that and remove them that way.    The file(s) that you changed the name(s) on need to be moved to a safe location. put them in a temp directory and zip them with a descriptive name so you don't go opening them by accident. If no problems surface after a month, it is probably safe to delete the file.    All of the above assumes that your anti-virus and other anti-malware programs failed. Most of the better anti-virus programs have a mechanism to report malware that it didn't find. Send a copy off to them once your system is clean. You may have found a new variant that no one knows about yet. Usually, the next virus definition update will find your version and at that point let the anti-virus program put it in it's vault    There are even safer ways to remove malware using live CD's. The procedure is nearly the same except you don't boot the Windows command prompt at all. You boot the live CD and change file name(s) that way. An advantage of the live CD is you get a Linux GUI environment. This is also one possible way to recover if you change a file that is important to the operating system that prevents normal boot. If you have a Zip drive or other emergency recovery disk or flash drive, then you may be able to boot from that instead of a live CD and have more familiar Windows tools available.    Manually removing malware is generally not very difficult. It is just a matter of circumventing all the possible ways it might try to keep itself on the system.

Remove the malware it finds. Then restart your computer again and everything should be cleaned.

Instead, I go to the folder that you store your music in and I copy them all and then go to Computer then my MP3 Player and I paste my music files into the MP3 Player.    Much faster and easier, without any annoying problems.

8Yd3UO0Baa	There's not a great deal to differentiate between Kaspersky, Norton, BitDefender, Avira, NOD32 and maybe one or two others when it comes to the anti-virus side, apart from personal preference. All are very good (Including Norton 2009). McAfee I wouldn't touch. Avast is a good freebie, the other two freebies (AntiVir and AVG) are lacking essential elements. Comodo AV may be good but hasn't really been tested yet.    Where most suites are let down is in the other parts, especially the firewall, see http://www.matousec.com/projects/firewal...    If you want a suite, Kaspersky is the clear winner as I see it. Otherwise, consider NOD32 anti-malware (AV) as it uses few resources and is very fast. It's also very effective and was Anti-Virus of the Year 2006 & 2007 and close second 2008, according to http://www.av-comparatives.org  Pair this with OnlineArmor free firewall, which is excellent and easy to use, and you'd have a good combination.

In order of importance:    1. Create and use almost exclusively a limited user account instead of the default administrator account Windows sets you up with    2. Read up on social engineering and how to avoid it    3. Don't download illegal copies of software, music, or movies    4. Set Windows updates to install automatically    5. Make regular backups.

Since you are ruling out Norton I'd say Kaspersky is the one you should try first. I like kaspersky but it did slow down internet surfing. Eset Smart Security is also something you might want to look at. It has good protection, and runs very light. It also has the fastest scanner out of all the av. It's anti-spyware protection is a little weaker than Kaspersky. Eset does not have as many features as the other security suites.

AVG is also trying to act like a cyber-police, it detects working keygens, cracks, and reports clean peer to peer sharing sites as malware websites.  I strongly dissagree on AVG's point of view here    AVG Free does not contain Anti-Rootkit protection so rootkits may be hidden in your system.    AVG Free does not contain the new Safe Downloads & Instant Messaging protection (Web Shield technology) so it does not screen your downloads and communication for viruses and spyware.

Here are my suggestions (and warnings) for free software (I tried all personally):    Do not use more than one Antivirus on active mode (it is OK to have one active and others in passive (manual scan) mode), one "software" Firewall (no options there as war between them will shut down your communication system if you have more than one), one good cleaner, two or three Anti spyware/Malware (they each detect something that the others have not seen) and one Email scanner (if your Virus scanner does not include one) but have at least one of each (for security) as there is no excuse to leave yourself wide open.    Cleaner suggestion:     Glary Utilities: http://www.glaryutilities.com/gu.html to remove junk files, remnants of installs and clean your registry (there are other utilities too) .    Do not use Ccleaner ( In my time at helping others, I have found it more destructive than helpful and I had to rebuild systems nuked by it in the past ).    Virus scanners and Firewall:    Avast is good but takes a lot of resources in the computer.    If you need both Virus scanner and firewall, then the Comodo firewall http://www.personalfirewall.comodo.com/d... is the top contender.     Use it in combo mode (Antivirus/Firewall) at installation.    The firewall itself is very robust and the just-released version 3 includes a well-designed intrusion detection system and Vista compatibility. Comodo also supports internet connection sharing, whereas the free versions of Kerio and ZoneAlarm do not.     Make sure that you install it in "Advanced" mode, because the "Basic" installation has the HIPS ( Host-based Intrusion-Prevention System ) disabled.     If you just want to use Comodo as a Firewall then for Virus scanning, use Avira instead http://www.download.com/Avira-AntiVir-Pe... It is very light on resources and the detection rate of viruses and rootkits is outstanding.    However, it does not include anti-spyware and anti-adware protection so add an Email scanner ( http://www.spamdel.com/ OR http://www.glenn.delahoy.com/software/fi... ) and see below for adware scanning.    Anti-Malware/Spyware suggestions:    Malwarebytes' Anti-Malware: http://www.download.com/Malwarebytes-Ant... is a good choice and has gotten many people out of jams if you keep it updated.     Spybot: http://www.download.com/Spybot-Search-am... is also a good choice if you use it regularly and keep it updated.      And of course, NEVER have them working scans at the same time.    When you scan, only the Firewall should be running alongside (in learn mode if need be).    Use a methodic "one after the other" kind of scan !      P.S.: DO NOT USE toolbars as they contain a form of spyware (even the ones from big names) and stay away (or get rid of) AVG (no good crap)|`|901930fc8f0cb1ce4a9483207715497baa	Most registry cleaner can do more harm then good.

esxPib2Haa	You need to determine if the motherboard will support an AGP or PCI-Express graphics card.|`|9gdJNTajaa	The compatability depends on the port on the motherboard the graphics card is going to be plugged in.  If you edit your post and put the model and brand of your motherboard people can help you more.  But as our friend just said, PCI-Express 2 is the newest and all new graphic cards are compatible.  I also agree with getting an ATI 4850, because it has the new R770 chipset which is used in the most powerful graphics card (4870x2) and also the price is reasonable.    :) hope to have answered your Q|`|AA11703028	hi mate             upgrading your graphics card is quite straightforward however lets go through some important factors before i recommend a card    1)compatibility : most of todays graphic cards come in the pci-express interface however some still use the ageing agp interface so to check which your pc requires you need to download the excellent utility "gpu-z" from http://www.techpowerup.com/gpuz/....afte... downloading this you only need to run this from the file(no need to install) and when the window appears you will see several specification regarding your pc,s graphic card...look in the "bus interface" box and you will see which type of graphic card your pc requies   2)specifiations : now you have discovered which type of card you need you now need to know what all the specs mean when buying a card   there are many specifications found on a graphic card however the main ones are   a) core clock : Video cards have two clock speeds of interest, the memory clock, and the core clock. The core clock is the speed at which the graphics processor on the card operatores. The clock speed of a chip, combined with the number/configuration of the pipelines in the chip, give a pretty accurate picture of what the performance of the chip will be.    b) memory clock : The memory clock, along with the size of the memory bus, tells us the amount of memory bandwidth a graphics card has. The more memory bandwidth a card has, the better it can handle higher resolutions and high levels of AA and AF.    Memory comes in several different varieties, most of which are some form of DDR (double data rate). DDR memory can read from/write to memory twice every clock cycle. So if your DDR memory clock is 500MHz, the effective clock speed is 1000MHz. You'll notice, for cards that use DDR memory, the card pages show both the actual clock speed and the effective speed of the memory.  Like the core clock, the memory clock of most cards can be manually increased through the driver. Though highly overclockably memory is somewhat rare.  c) memory bandwidth : Memory bandwidth is equal to the size of the memory bus multiplied by the speed at which the memory is clocked.  The higher the memory bandwidth, the better the card will be able to handle large textures and anti-aliasing and anisotropic filtering. Not to say that you don't need a lot of memory bandwidth if you don't want to use these features, you still do. Memory bandwidth is important in nearly every part of graphics processing.  The amount and speed of the memory matter very little in comparison to the overall memory bandwidth. If you want a card with good memory, this number says it all.    d) memory bus interface : There are several different types of slots that video cards can fit in. Initially there was ISA, then PCI, then AGP 1x through 8x, and now PCI-E.  Currently almost any motherboard purchased within the last 2 years will support either AGP 8x or PCI-E. While most AGP specifications were backwards compatible with one another, PCI-E is completely different and will not work with an AGP card and vice versa.   e) direct x compliance : DirectX is an API created and maintained by Microsoft for the purpose of programming 3D applications. With different versions of DirectX new capabilities are added, and the minimum requirements for support go up. For example, version 9 of DirectX introduced pixel shader version 2.0 support, so in order for a card to be DirectX 9 compliant, it would have to support PS 2.0 (as well as other requirements).  Game developers target their games to these DirectX levels. Often they'll create multiple different modes to support different versions of DirectX and thus different generations of video cards. Older cards which don't support the latest DirectX version often have to use downgraded visuals in order to get a game to play.    f)  pixel and shader model  : This relates to a cards DirectX compliance. DirectX can be divided into two specifications, the Pixel Shader Model, and the Vertex Shader Model. Each model has different hardware requirements, and when you take both into account you can determine the overall DirectX version.  Think of this number as a more specific description of the DirectX version. Specifically, what pixel manipulation capabilities it has.   f) memory type : All video card memory is RAM, or 'random access memory'. Over the years there have been a bunch of different variations of ram used to try to get higher performance and lower costs. Early on (the mid 90s) there were several different types of ram used including VRAM and EDO. By the end of the 90s everyone had pretty much standardized on SDRAM.  Since then, DDR memory has been the big deal. DDR stands for 'double data rate' and means that the memory can be accessed twice during every clock cycle. This translates to double the effective memory speed. Since DDR was first used on the GeForce 1, it has been an evolutionary process. DDR2 was introduced with the GeForce FX 5800 Ultra, and later GDDR3 was introduced on the GeForce 6800 Ultra (in each case ATi followed suit very shortly after nVidia).  DDR, DDR2, and GDDR3 are all just double data rate SDRAM. But the specifications for voltages and timings were adjusted with each specification to allow for higher clock speeds (and thus higher performance). In general, the only real difference between DDR, DDR2 and GDDR3 is the speed at which they run.  --------------------------------------...    so theres the main specification and as with most of todays hardware the higher the better,however at a glance i allways look at the memory bandwidth,this gives me a good idea of the cards performance,since the memory bandwidth is calculated by multiplying the memory clock by the memory bus ( e.g   1800mhz x 256bit = bandwidth)     so whats the best(and be|`|066a3072b2a697635921e0eb4d7507ddaa	just get the best u can afford it will work ok|`|5XavPJJ1aa	Most computers today have the PCIE slot for any PCIE video cards, however if your main purpose is for gaming, then I suggest that you get a video card for gaming.

Two affirmations to start: 1) Do not reformat or use system restore to start from new as it is too harsh and you should do it only as a last resort.    2) Do not copy your documents elsewhere as this will only spread the Malware and do NOT use your Email until this is cleaned.    Now for the main part: This is Malware, deeply rooting itself in your system (some even hide in your router's firmware). Virus scanners and the Restore Point Utility are not good things to use against such invasion for this reason alone.    Get the programs I listed from another computer (Internet Caf, Public Library or friend's computer) onto a USB stick as Malware blocks you from downloading protection. A word of caution, be sure to read all programs help files completely before using them. If you still cannot use MBAM,  rename it Alteregobytes to confuse the Malware (but be sure to keep the .exe extension on it) and use it as alternative for part A of the following solution.     TRYING MBAM ALONE IS NOT ENOUGH AS YOU NEED A COMPLETE SOLUTION, here is one (use programs in the order stated):     A) Download MBAM (MalwareBytes' Anti-Malware): http://www.download.com/Malwarebytes-Ant... - Install the application and make sure a checkmark is placed next to Update Malwarebytes' Anti-Malware and Launch Malwarebytes' Anti-Malware, then click Finish ( If an update is found, it will download and install the latest version ).    Once the program has loaded, select "Perform Quick Scan", then click Scan ( The scan may take some time,so please be patient ). When the scan is complete, click OK, then Show Results to view the results. Make sure that everything is checked, and click Remove Selected ( When disinfection is completed, a log will open in Notepad and you may be prompted to Restart ).      B) Try the tricks and free programs I use: 1) Clean browsers junk.     Method One (now): In Internet Explorer (IE), click the Tools menu, then Delete Browsing History and in the box, click the Delete all button (bottom left) and Yes.  In Firefox (FF), go to tools, clear private data, make sure all boxes are checked and then click on the clear private data now button.    Method Two (Normal use: Every 14 days - Heavy use: Every 7 days): In IE, click the Tools menu, Delete Browsing History and in the box that opens, do these: a) click the button near Temporary Internet Files, click Yes and wait for the box that opens to close.   b) click the button near History, click Yes and wait for the box that opens to close and finally, click the close button (bottom right) to finish.    In FF, Go to tools, clear private data and uncheck all except Browsing History, Cache and Authenticated Sessions boxes then click on the clear private data now button.    Note: Close browser when done to clear cookies still in memory.  For other browsers or versions of the programs, check help files for guidance on doing cleanup.    2) Turn off the restore point utility ( Guide for XP: http://support.microsoft.com/kb/310405 and Vista: http://windowshelp.microsoft.com/Windows... )    3) Use this free cleaner: http://www.glaryutilities.com/gu.html to remove junk and remnants files.    4) put order in your HD with a "Disk defragmenter".    5) Turn restore point utility back on. (see part 2)    6) Do not use Google/Yahoo toolbars (spyware).    7) Persisting problem after this, get Avira: http://www.download.com/Avira-AntiVir-Pe... plus an Email scanner ( http://www.spamdel.com/ OR http://www.glenn.delahoy.com/software/fi... ).  Already have a scanner, make sure your virus database is updated BUT stay away from (or get rid of) AVG free (CRAP).    8) If the problem is very stubborn and you have a router, visit its web site and check for firmware that is more recent than your version. If FOUND, download and install, if NOT, use the router's reset switch, both methods return it to factory settings. "WARNING": Gather router install CDs, guides, passwords before doing this as you will need to do all connections again.      By doing so, you are on your way to being well protected BUT never relax your guard !|`|PvPZYFr5aa	It's possible, if it has a picture embedded in it, or a link that you click on.

Don't take any notice of anyone who tries to make you feel guilty about anything that brings you pleasure (as long as it doesn't hurt anyone, which masturbating, within reason, doesn't).    The only time you have to worry is when an activity, any activity, becomes obsessive to the exclusion of everything else.    Carry on doing what you're doing. It's far healthier and safer than sex, especially at your age.    Be careful with the porn sites.

It wasn t shared that way.     It seems so ...innocent.  At times though, something may happen, you may become so accustomed to letting go with a certain favorite image,  that the real thing will be there and the only way to get into it will be to turn her around so you can get that favorite image in your mind.  She will feel this lack of connection, truly.  The friction , grip, and speed will be different with the real thing  you may be so used to your way of taking care of yourself that you will slowly close yourself off from being able to feel pleasure from other touches, pressure, etc....  Your partner may feel they cannot please you,   and feel sorrow for the lack of connection.  You may develop a certain fetish ( image again) for instance red shoes and red nails , ( or _____________ ) you fill in the blank.  This sounds harmless.  Sometimes, however, it might become like a computer worm, it grows and infects other parts of your thinking and actions.  Lie you may meet a perfectly suitable lovely person for you, they meet your needs on several levels , and you can make them happy in ways , and then- they just don t wear pantyhose! Or they refuse to wear red shoes! Or they wear them sometimes because you asked and they were amused, but then you just couldn t get off unless they had those shoes on!  They will figure out that it is not them that you are sharing your mind and heart and energy with.

I have a Mac, my fiance has a PC - we use an HP printer/scanner combo because it's compatable with both the PC and the Mac.|`|AA12351099	Step 1: well you start by throwing that over priced fail boat of a computer out the window and then get a good PC for half the price with more compatibility, and better hardware inside it.     Step 2: Use the scanner that is part of your printer...

Honestly, it does not matter. Youtube is not going to find out how old you really are . Some people even say that are 101 years old!|`|SFGNnKfWaa	i think you have to be 13.|`|mOMoltVMaa	18. It used to be 13, but they changed it for some reason.
6xijgfxDaa	rofl gay guy you cant change it but you can make a new one called batty boy haaaaaaaaa|`|zjXLbGnJaa	You don't have one... but you do? Hmmm, we are going to need Sherlock here.|`|eQRJFXO7aa	No. You have to create a new one.
2dkCdd3Yaa	If the Dimension 3000 is stock from Dell it will not run this game because of the minimum specs required: http://blogs.sega.com/totalwar/2009/01/2...     I am not sure how fast your 3000 is configured, or how much ram is in it, but the main reason this system will not be able to play this game is because of the video card. Stock from Dell this system came with an integrated graphics card which will not be able to play this game. You would need to upgrade the graphics card, but since this system can only accept PCI cards this will leave you with limited options. Newer systems use PCI Express graphics cards and these cards will not work with your system.     If you are planning on playing new PC games you might want to consider buying a new system. Here are some new systems from Dell that should run this game quite well: http://www.dell.com/content/topics/segto...      If you have any questions please let me know.    I hope this helps.
bs4EQtkvaa	tools>delete browsing history|`|jMzWwAw1aa	depends, for mozilla firefox it's, tools - clear private data   internet explorer you right click on the i on your desktop, click properties and do it from there.
b301fdd2f7f0f686b01337263980d14baa	Go to Control Panel / Sound & make sure that the mic you are using is set as the default device under the "recording" tab".    regards,  Philip T
xaaZSbnVaa	Wow that IS old. I don't know if it's the same as the new one but it's worth a shot. Go to Menu > Tools > Messages > Message History  make sure the box is checked to automatically keep a history of conversations.|`|pkjADvNRaa	If the auto save feature isn't working save n paste for now into word....check for updates....if still a problem, "remove the program" and reinstall should you find that file, however I know I have saved chat sessions on the latest version....Good Luck|`|zhIVzJj8aa	you just have to go to the options and then go to settings. From their you want to click on archives.  click save archives and you will be good to go./ good luck
7R9rizrmaa	They're being mean to you. However, at the same time, I wouldn't brag about reading their convos. But as the previous person said, you're just giving them ammo to bully you.    Find new friends and be a bit more discreet with your facebook activities.|`|ldi4iSgCaa	Facebook is BS.    FaagBook|`|T7SBu63Aaa	lol yeah i don't get that either. Sometimes you can be a stalker. Like if you see that your friend commented on their friends photo and you don't know who their friend is you look at the album. lol I'm only saying this because I do this sometimes. XD|`|CKE9oLlZaa	why go on there  they are not friends  find a real friend - people who have friends, plural, don't know what a real friend is. If they don't want you there then you are a stalker. You're giving them the ammo to bully you.    http://www.samaritans.org/
SkpRC2Nmaa	Try to install the phone's driver and check if it works then
MHxeLTUPaa	I used to use WMP but someone had told me about VLC player. After I've tried it. It's the best. I use that for all video formats and use WMP 11 for music.|`|fMfBAgOUaa	Winamp is totally kickass.|`|hplJxGa2aa	VLC media player. It will play ANYTHING. I love it. Here is a link.    http://www.download.com/VLC-Media-Player...|`|nHmDVehAaa	VLC/mplayer are great video players that can play nearly any video file with the correct codecs. If you want music then foobar would be your best choice, with winamp right after it.|`|AA12095978	I"m a fan of Winamp.  it does everything.|`|0ed48a5e0bda094ada9c3a81b4586a92aa	VLC
