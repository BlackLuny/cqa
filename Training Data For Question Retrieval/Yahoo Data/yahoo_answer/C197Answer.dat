VKgD1K3baa	Do you think it could be a coincidence that she stopped the screaming when switching formulas? This is the age when they can start to have night terrors. Has she been on this formula for a while and not had problems before? Is there any new food you have introduced lately? Best of luck!|`|oWAUb6vpaa	It sounds like to old formula was giving her gas - they have OTC gas drops for baby that will definitely help. <br>  <br>  It's good if she's able to hold down the new formula and not cry in pain. At this age, she should be able to drink some baby juices that will help keep her hydrated and shouldn't hurt her belly. Cereals and other baby foods will also help to give her the nutrients she needs - I mention this since you're concerned about her getting enough. <br>  <br>  Good luck mom and baby!|`|3xH6GdnCaa	I have a nine month old that has never drank more than 4 oz. at a time. When he started eating solids at 3 months he started drinking even less. The doctore says all babys are different but they should be drinking 16 oz daily -in a 24hr span- give or take. Some days we do good to meet that 16 oz. but thats just and average he says so that means babys are drinking much less and much more. Hope this helps...
tMeN2fm0aa	maybe with time he will come back.  Guys mentally age slower than women.  I know that it stinks and it is awful and I am so sorry that you have to go through this... I just pray that things work out for you.  He could grow up and realize what he is throwing away, and what he is missing and then it will be up to you, who knows by then you could have gotten over him and his immature ways.|`|bDcawsx1aa	I'm sorry you are going through this. He may come to love the baby once you have him. Its wrong for him to say he doesn't want the child. Its even worse that he walked out on you while you are carrying his baby but no one can say if he will love this baby like he loves your first one. I really hope he has a change of heart.<br>  Good luck!|`|K0Oh0p6Daa	That's gd that he loves ur child to death. If yall aint working dnt worry time will tell if yall belong together or not. He will love this second baby. U never knw this might bring yall closer together just pray on it.|`|3505983107c631451310c5009361ae76aa	aw that is a horrible situation. maybe you should try talk to him and see if ye can work things out.
TQW5E6olaa	I'm so there and just recently (within 10 minutes) posted a similar question. I've spaced out our visits and it works out better 1-2 hours  twice a month seems to be working out pretty well.<br>  <br>  They don't compare my daughter to someone else or question my parenting though (besides being overprotective, but I ignore that)<br>  <br>  If its a strain on you, baby will feel the stress and it won't be enjoyable for her either. Let them make some effort, if they don't write them off.<br>  <br>  In the past 4 months, I've seriously pulled back and they haven't asked about her or to see her, so we've seen them only once or deice a month where we used to see them weekly. <br>  <br>  It's their loss if they don't want to know their grandchild, try not to let it get to you.|`|1tmX7xbRaa	i know almost exactly what you are talking about.  i live less then a 3 minute drive from my MIL's house. the only thing that his family does is buy my daughter things that she doesn't need. like huge expensive toys that she can't even play with yet. it really gets to me because they NEVER make the effort to come and see her, spend time with her or anything. my husbands sister is the god mother and she has NEVER ONCE offered to spend ANY kind of quality time with our daughter. when i do go over their house (she lives with the parents) she stays in her room the whole time and NEVER comes out to see the baby. i very rarely go over to the parents house because it's very rare that his mother invites us over. and it's also very rare that they come here to see her and even when they do come (the mother mostly his father really adores the baby) his mother will sit in the kitchen for 10-15 minutes, say a couple words to the baby (not really baby anymore 19months) and then she will leave. she always tells my daughter 'oh when nana cleans the house you can come and play' but NEVER have a recieved a call to come over so she can see the baby. not to mention there are plenty of times where i have asked her to watch our daughter because of an appointment and she will say yes and then an hour before i have to drop her off she calls me and tells me she can't watch her. and this is the same woman who was on my case about getting a job (she said she would watch our daughter while i worked but how can i trust that?) not to mention when my daughter was only a few months old she tried pressuring me into having a nother kid! it's also only my husband and his sister (other then cousins) and me and hubby are the only ones that have kids (19mth ld and due in may with #2) and their whole side of the family is this way.<br>  anyway i didn't mean to go on like this i just wanted to let you know that you aren't alone. some people just don't seem i don't know...attached. like his mother will go on and on about her 'baby boy' and she will do everything for her son and her daughter (almost 30 living at home) and yet it's like her granddaughter is chopped liver. i don't know it upsets me and my husband but some people are just jerks. i have quit making an effort to include them in everything and i am cordial when they call or stop by but other then that i just don't care anymore. why try to include someone who doesn't seem to give us a second thought?|`|Oxl4cyCyaa	That is messed up. I would be very upset with them and try to have as little of contact as possible. I have 3 kids (11, 5, & 2) and family is very important to me! Even though it would hurt me so much to not have their grandparents part of their life, if they don't try to get to know her and love her. Than they don't have the right to know how precious she is. I am not sure what I would. I would probably try very hard to get through to them that they are hurting not only the relationship with their granddaughter, but our relationship too.<br>  If that doesn't work and they don't seem to listen or care. Than it's not worth caring about. What does your hubby think about this? Could he talk to them about it?<br>  <br>  I wish you the best of Luck!|`|y6g0RnuAaa	My husband's family lives far away so I am not in exactly the same predicament. They have visited my son once during his almost 11 months of life. I understand they are far away but... they MOVED across the country to be involved with their other grandkids and the excuse I always get as to why they don't come down to visit is that they have to watch the other grandkids after school. <br>  <br>  My son will be turning 1 in April so I made it pretty clear that I expected them to be here for that. They acted like they had to completely screw up their "routine" and kept making comments like "where are Nathan and Andrew gonna go? I was so pissed- I told them they should have been planning for this a long time. I said "why can't their PARENTS take care of them?" So they make travel arrangements to come down and are only staying for the day of his birthday (my husband runs several hotels and can get them free rooms ANYTIME.) My husband was so afraid to tell me...lol. I called them up and let them have it. Needless to say, our relationship is very strained now and I could care less if they are still coming. <br>  <br>  You have given more than enough effort. I understand that it hurts you, your husband and your daughter will probably be hurt one day too. It is out of your control- you did everything right. Don't allow them to continue to make you feel upset. Put the focus on her relationships with your family.  It really IS them that's missing out.
eeyGYRcPaa	wow what a whore. you should worry about stds...duh.|`|k0QRfQ00aa	Yes you have PLENTY to worry about..unwanted pregnancies and STDs if I were you I would go to the doctor tomorrow and get necessary testing.

bDcawsx1aa	Demoral ( I think that's how its spelled. That's how its pronounced) through the IV. Didn't work for me but I heard its worked for others. There might be more intravenous medications. Ask your OB.|`|FtBqmFDEaa	Pethidine given by injection but it can make you a little woozy and out of it. Gas and air is good when the contractions get really strong. You could try a TENS machine in early labour but I just found it extremely annoying and couldn't wait to take it off. <br>  <br>  I had an epidural both deliveries although not straight away. I had an emergency c/section the first time after 36 hour labour and a ventouse delivery after 14 hours the second time. Sometimes I do wish I had experienced a more natural delivery but the contractions were so hard and lasted so long (my son was face to pubes hence the c/section) that I was glad to get some relief.|`|3505983107c631451310c5009361ae76aa	a few people i know have gone with the gas because they couldn't get epidurals. they said it still hurt but your not as aware cos your kind of out of it a little bit. as far as i know there isn't anything else for the pain.|`|e7KgSz7eaa	It depends on what the hospital policies are where you end up delivering. At my hospital, you can have IV Stadol, Nubain, or Fentanyl, but only under a certain set of circumstances: * No IV pain meds past 7 cm dilated, because they pass along to the baby and cause respiratory depression. * If your baby is not "reassuring" on the fetal monitor, meaning showing activity and movement and not having any dips in the heartrate, then you cannot have IV pain meds, for the same reason.<br>  <br>  Ask about a walking epidural.  It is a low dose, and will allow you to get out of bed so you can still have a "kinda natural" labor.  One thing to consider about epidurals is that the medicine does not enter your bloodstream, so it does not affect the baby like IV pain medicines do.  Also consider: if your labor is being induced or augmented with medication (like Pitocin), your pain WILL be more intense.|`|a1fAaig3aa	There are a lot of medication available to help you deal with the pain.<br>  None of them will work like the epiduarl but they can serve as pain management, like take the edge off a little.<br>  There is a medication called Nubain.<br>  It is administered through IV and can be given every two hours. It will take the edge off.<br>  Also, dermerol or simply Ibuprofen.<br>  It all depends on your pain tolerance.<br>  Always go into labor with an open mind, dont dread it because you KNOW it will hurt, you may be able to deal with the pain quite well, or you may not. Either way you are not a failure.<br>  Don't go in completely against any pain intervention, unless you have strong beleifs of an all natural birth but it doesn't seem like you do.<br>  Just keep an open mind there are many options available to you.|`|K0Oh0p6Daa	That's the  only medicine they got to help. Patocin is gd but that helps u dilate more. If u wanna do it natural then leave the epidural alone and just breathe u can do it. It'll be over soon. Gd luck.
oWAUb6vpaa	There could be a number of issues in baby's stomach or intestines (many that would not require surgery but don't disregard that idea either.) <br>  <br>  If baby's doctor has known that baby's been doing this for months and doc hasn;t come up with anything to help this poor infant, then I seriously suggest you find another pediatrician - doc can't just keep blowing this off like nothing - you need someone else, mom. Get help for baby asap.* Poor thing.. <br>  <br>  Good luck to you and baby!|`|AA10405438	I had this problem with my baby.  After months of doctors telling me she was fine, I went to a good doctor that did allergy testing and I found out she's allergic to milk.  Take your baby to another doctor and ask for allergy testing.  You will sleep better!!!
UMtxht9Laa	i think it depends if u have got enough money but i think u can|`|AA11366224	At 18, you can do what you like provided it's legal.  However, if you run out of money, don't expect them to take you back.|`|RQvLrKMXaa	Theoretically you can do all this, but are you certain that you can afford to pay your own way?  Including college?  If you move out against your parents will they may stop any and all support of your college education and with only a p/t job, there's no way you can afford it.|`|Z9xwKUt4aa	at 18 you can do whatever u want, ur an adult|`|6PbyKpHzaa	Yes.

I wish you luck.|`|eba7fefdf839622869be8b19d9b9ca2baa	Yes.|`|1s3nddaYaa	yes sir|`|VG2X9Ihkaa	Yes you can move out of your parents house because with British law, you are considered as an adult at the age of 18.<br>  <br>  It would be better to agree with your parents if possible which will be more beneficial for you because if you are in trouble, they might be able to help you emotional, financial and even moving back in with your parents in case of trouble.  But if this is not a choice available, then move out and make your life.<br>  <br>  Good luck :o)|`|OZ3XmVDWaa	Yes you physically can, but out of personal experiance:<br>  It will likley weaken if not destroy your friendship.<br>  Greatly upset your parents (if you care)<br>  And you can't live of full time let alone p/t employment.<br>  Stress kills your school work.<br>  And how do you plan to pay for college on your own?|`|tUeH8HDdaa	Yes you can.<br>  <br>  And can I just say from a parents point-of-view how excited they must be feeling.<br>  <br>  They will now be able to plane and afford all the holidays they have been dreaming of for the last eighteen years.<br>  <br>  Personally I think I would save about ￡200 per week if my eighteen year old moved out and took responsiblity for himself.|`|3061ed3a2f1d09c904ae44f8dc455d7daa	In the U.S. if you are 18 years old you are legally an adult.  Do what you want, when you want, how you want without consent of parents.  You do not have to disrespect your parents.  Just tell them you are an adult now and ask them to respect that.|`|8146e347ad7537c819ea87c18358a194aa	Yes at 16 you can actually move out. not suggested at all because 16 is not enough real world experience to be on their own.|`|f98093c5efc4ff7a072f987cac7a9d42aa	Uh, yeah. At 18 you would be a legal adult. The fact that you're asking the question, however, has me concerned about your maturity level.|`|qv493CGiaa	Yes, i can't wait till i can :) 3 more years (Y)|`|cc58f25f135e1b74853908d6277ffe1daa	you are an adult at 18 so yes|`|HJwFwXUoaa	You could, and perhaps it may be a good experience for you to be more independent. After all, you can't rely on your parents forever. Of course, it won't be easy. But since you are now legally an adult, act like one. I mean, discuss this with the attitude of an adult (although some adults don't act like adults). They will respect you for it and see that you really have grown up. Even if they're initially against your decision, they'll eventually get used to it. One of the reasons why they're against your wishes is because they love, care, and worry about you. After all, they have raised you for 18 years. <br>  <br>  Never take your parents for granted. While you're living under their roof, I don't think anyone knows just how much their parents support them.  And of course, parents also need to learn how to one day let their kids go. Hopefully, as you get older, your relationship with your parents will grow stronger and that they'll become your best friends. <br>  <br>  Wish you all the best :)|`|kLSx9NGTaa	when i was 17, i was renting my own flat, working full time during the day, and doing part time college in the evenings, so i dont see any reason why some one couldnt do the things you listed|`|xjearCOPaa	Yes, when you're 18, technically, you are an adult. Therefore, you can do whatever you want.|`|vr8pvPRTaa	Yes at 18 you are classed as an adult and can do what you wish without a parent/guardians permission.|`|fAN8snFdaa	yes you can to all of the above|`|f94fc93dcfa5beac8700d2c8a5a2ffb6aa	Yes, it is possible but it will be hard work. <br>  <br>  Good luck if you choose this path.|`|QYotXeB7aa	Yes, but you will regret it.|`|6gM98TRjaa	yes, yes, yes and yes|`|r0k8dKXKaa	yes.
CdJtH0xdaa	Lack of proper knowledge of sex.|`|lGKq9NXbaa	stupidity... not enough information on contraception. parents not talking to their kids about sex and methods of birth control.|`|WGAFP6mSaa	I think it's the lack of proper sex education.<br>  <br>  or..<br>  <br>  Just curiosity without protection.|`|AA12305061	Education teaches us abstence only, media influences *cough cough* jamie lynn.

You can have the best parents in the world but when those hormones start raging anything can happen. Its just the way of the world.|`|eba7fefdf839622869be8b19d9b9ca2baa	I think its the family structure. <br>  Because they should do better.|`|gP0gYbBaaa	attention.|`|vr8pvPRTaa	I have heard a few girls say they want to get pregnant so they can live on benefits and get a council house - sad but true, this country is far too easy when it comes to situations like this.<br>  Some girls have a lack of love/structure in their family and want their own to do right with their child where their own parents went wrong.<br>  Having a baby these days isn't as serious as it use to be, girls will fall in love within a week and think a baby will secure their relationship - again I don't think it helps that they know if the partner leaves them they will be ok finacially and it won't matter.<br>  These are just a few opinions of situations ive known of.|`|YjoFsZuyaa	myself personally i think it is a mixture of lack of family structure ... ie people dont have the staying power to work out problems so teenagers see broken families and feel they dont need to take responsibility or be in a long term relationship, but that is not to imply that it is those that come from broken families are the ones that get pregnant,<br>  <br>  possibly a major factor is that teenagers dont seem to have hobbies and with binge drinking increasing I am not surprised that many babies are concieved under the influence of alcohol. Myself I was busy with various activities throughout the week until i was 17 or so.<br>  <br>  Teenagers try to grow up a lot faster and think having kids will make them be "adults"<br>  <br>  i could go on for ages .... it is a mixture of so many factors. parents, school, moral values etc etc|`|AA12020110	Ignorance, stupid is taking over the gene pool.. Girls do not think about the consequences and boys don't care about the consequences.   <br>  <br>  Parents can talk to these kids every day but they cannot put condoms on their sons, though many Dad's provide condoms for their sons, or put a pill in daughters mouth every day. (I have heard of parents who take their daughters to the doctor and have the doctor administer the 'prevention shot'  without telling the girl until after.   Pretty traumatic I would think. ) <br>  <br>  Kids need more than education.  They need to work after school and have less free time.  Years ago most of the labor force was 18 and under, boys worked on farms, in construction, they logged, did mining, --hard physical work and that served to keep their minds out of their pants.  What time off they had was spent with family if possible   Girls often had to work also and they went to work as young as 14, being the 'house girl' cleaning the front steps, scouring the pots and pans, mopping floors on hands and knees,  carrying huge buckets of water, doing laundry, helping in the kitchen when needed.  <br>  Today that would be considered 'abuse'. It served it's purpose though.  Our kids have way too much time to play.|`|Xj2LO9iHaa	I'm guessing that its because preagnancy has been glamorized in hollywood a lot lately: with the octuplets, angelina jolie and other baby-bearing celebs, juno and the secret life of the american teenager.

CdJtH0xdaa	Tell her that her dad is going to be all right. The best thing you can do is just reassure her that everything is going to be all right. Reassure her that her father is going to be fine. Be by her side, and comfort her when she cries, because it sounds like she'll need a shoulder to cry on. All in all, you just have to support her, be her shoulder to cry on, and reassure her that her father will be all right. Good luck to you and your friend.|`|Qydtjz2naa	This must be so hard for your friend, and she probably has no idea what to think of it.  My parents got divorced last year, and although her situation is much worse than mine, I had friends who were able to cry with me.  My best friend said "most people will leave when things get hard, simply because they don't know what to do.  I promise I won't leave".  It was really good to hear that I had someone who would help me go through everything.  That's what you have to do.  Be there 110%, listen, and also give advice, although it will be hard coming up with the right words to say. <br>  <br>  My friends brought cartons of ice cream over, and a funny movie, and we just sat for hours talking and eating straight out of the cartons.  It helped distract me.  I am somebody who wont talk about my problems, so it was good to have my friends there, but not have to talk to them about it.  If she is someone like that, bring her a movie, or do something that you can be with her, but not have to talk about it.  If she is able to talk about it, listen, and let her talk for as long as she wants and needs.  Just tell her you will always be there.  Let her sleep at your house if things are hard at hers.  She probably wont want to be in her house.  The best advice I can give is comfort her, she needs it.|`|gP0gYbBaaa	take her out. she needs to get her mind off of things|`|abELhjcoaa	comfort, listen and be there for her and her family, there is not much you can do as far as the divorce goes, but support will really help them through such times|`|mPCSbit3aa	Tell Liz you love her.|`|8e5YBwd7aa	Ive been in a similar situation before,and the best thing that you can do is Tell her that you are here for whenever she needs a shoulder to lean on!When she says something ,all she really needs is someone to listen to her,My best friend sounds similar to you in a senses that she Really cares and I love her for that LOL :)<br>  You sound like a good friend!<br>  <br>  Hope I helped !<br>  - Adrianna ?

FNyMpITTaa	as helpful as the people above me were in suggesting you smack a child that is not yours...<br>  <br>  I have a cousin that used to be just like this, and the reason she kept it up is because everyone let her get away with it.  Except for me, when she was in my company I did put her in time out til she shutup or whatnot but i've found a really good thing to do is just flat out ignore the child, and i don't mean just a little, i mean 100%, the kid will stop following you, and stop whining if you pay him literally no attention.  Don't get me wrong though, it will definitely get worse first as he tries to get you to pay attention but he does it because he wants a reaction.  He enjoys seeing you irritated.<br>  <br>  He'll grow bored of whining to you when you stop caring.  You've got to get your boyfriend to agree to this too though otherwise the child is not going to take you seriously<br>  <br>  i promise you, this works<br>  <br>  and for the really rough times you can always try bribes but you try it too much and they'll realize "hey if i act like a butt i'll get rewarded"  so don't bribe to often|`|aCrZRrEDaa	you can spend some time with him, explaining to him about karma - what come around goes around. :)|`|CIruiZJsaa	Do you know Jesus Christ and have you read the bible it says not to spare the rod and that is not literal but if you do not discipline early you will pay later. Children want continues constant discipline not wishy washy discipline and each child is different it must done not out of your anger but out of love for his future. Find the pages in the bible and read it to him about obeying you parents it will not come back empty God promises this to you and will not fail you.|`|fRI8Lsjyaa	This is not so easy because the kid is already 9. I have worked a lot with kids in my life and I can definatly say the parents are guilty. I also get the feeling you are partly guilty. The kid has learned that by constantly whinning people eventually give in. The best way to deal is to let the kid whine and try to act as if it doesn't bother you...or even laugh...tell him that may work on his parents but you can see through his acting. <br>  There is a commerical I love on TV in Austria, where I live. The kid throws down a box of cereal and rolls on the floor whinning to get what he wants. The mom just grabs a box throws it on the floor and does the same. The kid stops whinning after that. (He just stares confused.)<br>  <br>  She showed the kid it doesn't work and she can't be embarressed. Often parents give in because it is embaressing, which is a terrible response. You  have to let him understand no means no! But.. also give small rewards even when just with words when he is being good!! And hitting is unnecessary!!!!! Parents who hit do it because they don't have control over their kids!|`|1s3nddaYaa	the parents should pop him in the mouth. make him sip hot sauce or put soap in his mouth for the talking back.  thats what my mom did to me lol.  my brother threw tantrums and his dad spanked him. or made him stay in his room with no tv or anything for an hour or so... it worked for both of us no harm|`|rNvXWMOMaa	you put him over your knee<br>  and tan his butt|`|sB5dyaczaa	Put him over your knee and smack his butt. Tell your bf that you are sick of him. Make your voice heard.

Personally I use spanking for various infractions, but scoldings, time outs, and other things work as well.  What you need to do is to put him on time out when he does it, but only do that if he says no and goes to his parents they will back you up and put him in there longer for saying no.  He needs consistent discipline for his actions.... CONSISTENT discipline, knowing that every time he crosses this line, this is what would happen.  Without consistency you are just whistling dixie.
1Du4Rudvaa	A. I would grade him as a C.  He didn't really help to much with anything dealing with the pregnancy.  <br>  <br>  B. I would give him an A.  He always sat up with me while I nursed and when he wasn't working he would always change her diaper without me asking.<br>  <br>  C. I would give him and A.  He puts me and my daughter above himself.  He is my best friend.|`|5QDouy4Uaa	a. I'll give him a B. He never does anything over and beyond. Unless I ask or nag haha but I think he's doing the best he can considering this will be our first child. <br>   b. the baby isn't due till the end of this month but I think he'll get an a for effort for sure.<br>  c. overall I'll give him an a because he really is good to me and treats me how I deserve to be treated.|`|fuN8BZp9aa	C. i give him An A+ i love my hubby and he is a good man.|`|21Lnhdfeaa	My hubby gets straight A's.

JOVWBOOCaa	Well you are certainly on the right track. Have you discussed this with your mom? You should try looking into your family history and whether endo runs in your family. Have you been bleeding along with the pain? If you have large amounts of blood often I would be sure to make note of it. Keep track of when you are bleeding and how often you need to change sanitary products. Take this to your doctor. At your age there is not much they will do for you. You are too young for a hysterectomy. They will probably put you oon depo provera which has some awful side effects. If it is too bad the will give you depo lupron which is not much better. It looks like you will either be in a lot of pain or sick unfortunately. Make sure you explain to your doctor how concerned you are about this, it wouldn't hurt if your mom went in to back you up and explain how bad it has been. At 17 they will have to okay any treatments with her anyway. She would also be a good tool for fam history. Just don't give up and don't let your doctor push you around and or blow you off, this is your body!! Good luck|`|GPkcg8Rqaa	First of all I totally understand your frustrations sweetheart....<br>  I tried for years to tell my old gyno and her answer was always that they pill would just stop it from developing...despite all my symptoms and the fact that my mother had it she never once suggest a lapo.<br>  <br>  fast forward ten years and I finally got my diagnosis last month...I had to switch gynos and he found a cyst...first they did ultrasounds and then I explained that I was in pain all month (I was off the pill since my hubby and I were trying to conceive) and I had to stop working...finally he performed the lap and low and behold I have severe endo.  My uterus is fused to my colon wall and he removed three cysts from my ovaries....<br>  <br>  Basically I convinced him to do it sooner when I said I was missing too much work to pay my bills and that I couldn't take the pain any longer...it sounds silly but EXAGERATE if you have too...say your schoolwork is at risk and that you have no energy to even go out with friends when you are in pain...say you want a laporascopy and definetly bring your mother with you to help....it may take a while but if I'd known at 17 that it was going to be so hard for me to get pregnant I would have started trying much sooner...<br>  Also if your on facebook join the groups I hate endometriosis and endometriosis sisters....it's a great support!<br>  <br>  Good luck my dear and don't lose hope...if you have to see many doctors so be it....|`|OhYE3GhKaa	Is your doctor a man? You seem like you have a pretty good handle on things. <br>  <br>  Getting a second opinion is good sense. <br>  <br>  Get back-up too. If they don't want to listen to you get your mom to back you up. Or your big sister or even brother if you have to.<br>  <br>  Can't imaging reveal the condition of endometriosus?|`|1xsUVtzBaa	Your ultimate goal is to have a laparoscopy performed? Why is that?<br>  You seem to know a lot about your condition. Is it attention you are seeking or real medical help? Maybe your doctor feels you are seeking attention. Change doctors..|`|2midwmuhaa	I would also like the answer to this question! I'm 25... I have been to so many dr's... I'm in so much pain... No doctor will give me that d*mn Laparoscopy.. I have all of the symptoms... I've taken pain killers and contraceptives.. I just want to know what this is... I am almost certain it's Endo...<br>          Have you ever seen John Q?... yeah... I've thought of that.... It's fiction but you know what? Dr's don't give a damn and they won't listen.... They treat you like you're stupid and don't know anything about the medication they give you.<br>              I wish all dr's could suffer, that way they would treat their patients better.|`|6nn7f41Faa	I have endometriosis. I had severe pains during my period to the point of passing out. I needed Tylenol 3's just to numb the pain so I could get through my day. After my first miscarriage in October 2007, my pain became so severe, it never went away. Then I became pregnant, and the pain went away. It came back when I miscarried again. I needed to go to my OB more than once explaining how excruciating the pain was, sometimes in tears, before he would agree to a laparoscopy. Before then, I had always been told that I was too young for endometriosis, because "it's a late 30's, early 40's thing, not early 20's or teenage years".<br>  <br>  Sure enough, in February 2008, I was diagnosed with stage 3 endometriosis.<br>  <br>  Don't lie about it, just explain gently that the pain is very bad, and the many conraceptives you have tried have not helped. You suspect endometriosis might be the case, but are not sure. However, you'd really like to find out one way or another, and start on treatments for it sooner over later if diagnosed.

OLW0Irbhaa	Unfortunately, not all parents know how to be parents nor are all parents warm, loving and attentive.  Sounds like your parents don't or can't do this for you.  Therefore, you have to look to yourself.  Learn to be a strong, secure and independent person.  Surround yourself with kind & loving friends.  Don't look for love and comfort in random people.  Build strong friendships and relationships that are equal.  Don't fall into the trap of trying to be a super-giver or savior to feel needed and loved. Don't fill the void your parents have left with people who will use you.  Stay strong and positive about the person YOU are not the person that feels emotionally left out by your parents. You are making very positive changes in your life and you will meet all kinds of people in college.  Get out there and experience what your school has to offer and you will find good people to add to your life.|`|968837a2f6943f22a9655689e9626ee9aa	I'm amazed an 18 year old can accuse anyone of being self centred, is this because they aren't paying you enough attention? <br>  <br>  <br>  If this is the case who is really the self centred one here?|`|OBzIzElFaa	If you feel your parents do feel this way, you need to sit down w/ them and talk to them and tell them how you feel.

It just looks misspelled. Molly August is a combination of two very nice names.. That don't flow together at all. So no.<br>  <br>  Mollie Blythe, again, is misspelled. Blythe is nice, and VERY unique. I love that name. :) Molly Blythe is nice. <br>  <br>  Mollie Ingrid, NO !! Molly is just gorgeous, but Ingrid is so.. Not. It sounds like the name of a woman in her 90. One of those bitter old ladys. Aha. <br>  <br>  Lydia Ingrid is just a big no. Both names are just not the right name for baby born in today's society. They were popular 100 years ago.. :\<br>  <br>  Lydia August flows well. I love August, bbut not Lydia.<br>  <br>  Josephine is nice. But, with Ingrid, they are both very, very masculine names. Try one name always being more feminine for a baby girl.<br>  <br>  Josephine Blythe is absolutely gorgeous. It is rather masculin, but a beautiful name. So far, this by far takes the cake. Great name, and extremely unique. It has loads of personality to it. Really nice.<br>  <br>  Blythe Ingrid is not as nice.. Blythe is nicer as a middle name. And with Ingrid is sounds just horrid.<br>  <br>  Margeaux August.. I love this. Margot or Margeaux are lovely. The name is extremely genuine, and feminine. I love August as well. Not too sure about the flow of the name as a whole, though. How about Margeoux Josephine, or Margeaux Blythe.<br>  <br>  Elliot Felix is cute. Elliot is one of my favourite boy names. Sooo cute. Felix seems too old, not sure on that one.. I love Elliot though. :) How about Elliot Michael, Elliot James, or Elliot Kayce.<br>  <br>  Felix Alexander sounds pretty good, the flow, just the names are both very common. Your other names are so unique, then this. I suggest that you go with one of your other options. <br>  <br>  Julian Felix is just average. Julian is cute, not a favourite of mine, though. How about Julian Rae, Julian Levi, Julian Trace, or Julian Samuel.<br>  <br>  Julian Alexander is very nice. Alexander is a great name, but very common. I don't think it's a big deal as a middle name, though. You both seem to favour the name Julian, so deffinately go with that. Julian Alexander is the better option. :]<br>  <br>  Favourite Girl Name(s):<br>  Molly Blythe - Best.<br>  Margeaux August - Second.<br>  <br>  Favourite Boy Name(s):<br>  Elliot Felix - By far the best.<br>  Julian Alexander - Second.<br>  <br>  Favourite Single Girl's Name(s):<br>  1.

It is adorable and unique, as well as being feminine, and as for the boy's name,<br>  <br>  I personally Love Julian Alexander, but you seemed attached to the name Felix, so why not give him 2 middle names, Julian Felix Alexander __________ or it cn be Felix Julian Alexander ___________<br>  <br>  giving your child 2 middle names it not unheard of, and the names flow beautifully together.|`|gu1sEQN8aa	I really like Mollie August or maybe use Augusta?

ltfeYdr5aa	You are doing a great job parenting. I think as everything this sounds like a phase and of course the constant testing, hang in there they do eventually come around to realize who is more fun, loving and involved( sometimes around 30 or so). I know what works with mine is taking a moment to breath and then listening to their feelings( I know I didn't want ot be one of THOSE parents but it works for us), at first they need to understand you aren't mad you just need to help them work through their feelings, b/c they are new and sometimes unmanageable for a little person.|`|FkGh0LuWaa	She wants you to leave so she is going to try anything she can to get you to.  Even at a young age they understand this.  Just to your guns.  If you tell her no then it is no.  When she lies about something have her father put her on time out.  Also try to become her friend.  Make cookies with her, do crafts, etc.
3505983107c631451310c5009361ae76aa	the birth control isn't always a 100% effective so the fact that ye took the plan B also should mean she is ok. the only way your going to know if she got pregnant or not is if she misses her next period but more than likely she wont be|`|EnYKNyPxaa	haha you will be fine lovely :)<br>  dont worry!|`|yZkf3zFeaa	I don't think its over kill. I think it was the responsible thing to do. Well you should have some form of contact with her, or a number she can reach you at should she become pregnant, which if she is indeed on birth control, and used plan b, is not going to be very likely. Stop worrying so much. Breath.|`|jZKCYlh9aa	there is no such thing as "over kill" when it comes to preventing pregnancy. no birth control is 100% so no matter what type she is using she can become pregnant. Plan B was a good idea, next time have a condom in your wallet.|`|p6cOZJYWaa	Nah.. Some people use bc and condoms like me.
MhotbrKEaa	It could be your period about to happen. The exact same thing happened to me last month. I got a BFN and I was so sad. But then again our bodies could handle each pregnancy completely different from everyone else's. Try retesting with fmu in a couple of days for your definitive answer. Baby dust to you!!|`|qkNbcWjjaa	if you are 10 dpo it could be implantation bleeding but if you were 13  dpo i could have been period starting. <br>  <br>  i would wait a week and test if the bleeding  doesn't pick up. <br>  <br>  best of luck and baby dust to you !
p1k5GOvgaa	Honey,what age are you?<br>  I'm thinking that(as you are asking this question)you aren't old enough to be getting as "intimate" as you did yesterday.Be careful.<br>  No,you cannot possibly become pregnant through 2 layers of clothing..or 4 layers if you were both wearing under-wear.<br>  The advice that I would give you is to stick to holding hands & kissing.The worst that can happen is that you could pass on warts or cold-sores to each other if you have them.<br>  Getting THIS "carried away" with each other can lead onto the pair of you going too far...something that you WOULD regret.<br>  Be sensible Girl.Look after your physical & mental health.|`|8U50QEBhaa	take a breather. :) don't worry girly. you can't get prego that way. if it is pretty much inside, more than likely one of his little babys coulda swam up your uterus. don't worry. just be careful :)|`|jUneJXEIaa	Definetely not if you were both fully clothed.|`|DutTBV3caa	calm down. you cant get pregnant that way and i'd say, if by some crazy line of events you did, obviously you were ment to. but the odds of that are slim to none. dont worry and if it'll make you feel better take a pregnancy test.|`|bzQNHfunaa	nope!
TYErFAAzaa	Were you wanting to get pregnant?  I would probably wait a little bit if you took an at home test and then go see the doctor in a week of so if you haven't gotten it yet.  I am proof that the blood tests don't always work.  I have done 5 already and they have either said indeterminate, positive and 1 said negative.  I am NOT pregnant but there is some form of hormone making the tests come back wrong.  I hope you are able to get the answers you are looking for. <br>  <br>  Oh I also forgot to mention I have taken 2 at home tests and they were both negative.|`|Ql09WZa8aa	A blood test is the most assuring way.. anyways, it's a possibility since you had sex around your ovulation time .

b978f631fc787a963337206aa3833370aa	Man ... I don't know ... At least you have the sister on your side. She can either relate to them what your feelings are, or perhaps you can take key family members aside and tell them exactly what is going on. Who can blame you for not wanting to pay his freaking bills? WTH is up with that?<br>  <br>  Otherwise, ignore grandma - even though she may apparently be influencing people to see you negatively, from what it sounds like. As bad as it sounds, she won't be around forever ... As far as the asthma, put your foot down immediately and tell them exactly what the problem is. If they won't listen, then refuse to allow your daughter to be around them, plain and simple. Maybe talk to his parents and be up front and say, "I feel like you're holding back on me - what's going on?" or ask the sister if she knows anything. If your daughter's father wants to be with you, yet just wants to use you and your money, then the problem obviously lies with him, not you. <br>  <br>  Good luck.|`|Jo2DfRzaaa	i'm probably not the best person to give advice as to how to get back on their good side....<br>  <br>  i will however add, that at the end of the day, as long as you do what is right by your child and you, they can say what they like.  they can think what they want.  it really doesn't matter as long as you know the truth.<br>  <br>  coming from someone who also is a bit sensitive and other peoples criticism of me (truthful or fabricated) affect me a great deal, i can honestly say, i could give a rats behind what my in laws think about me.  really dont care.  that has taken a LONG time to get to that point.  really they are idiots and truly dont care what those idiots think of me.  <br>  what can you do?  be who you are and be it best.  don't stoop to his level and be truthful to yourself.  it is what it is at the end of the day.  you can't change them.<br>  <br>  good luck.|`|AA10504458	i wonder if they know everything .or just what he is telling them .i would go to the family and have a good talk to them ,put them in the know .|`|8tqgOoE9aa	Remember, your the mother. Your word is law. Ultimetly, it's up to you. If this is recent, and following your refusal to get back together with their son, it's probably bc of him. He might be saying contradictory things. Try to talk to the grandparents, find out what is bothering them, and address the issues. If they think you're overprotective, tell them you always will be, bc your daughter has health issues that aren't fully appreciated by them. If they think you aren't being on the level with their son, offer to have the same conversation with him in the room also. If that is the case, also make them aware that YOUR familys life has been, and will continue to move forward, with or without them. But, as adults, they need to either be willing to try to communicate and move forward, or be willing to step aside. You cannot stradle the fence. It needs to be talked about, and if it isn't resolved, just let it go. This is their problem, that is effecting you, but only as long as you let it.|`|DnNkCF6Taa	I would say to go to them individually and if you have a good relationship with them or did, for example invite his parents over for dinner one time and talk about it just the three of you, and find out what is going on.  I mean the best way to resolve this is through open communication and the best way to not get interrupted is to invite them over when he is out of town or doing something else.|`|prqrQcd1aa	I've dealt with far worse from my oldest daughter's family before...and we still get along in some ways.<br>  The best thing to do is just continue to be nice to them. They may be kind of "put off" because you don't want to take him back. For the time being let them be that way and feel what ever way they choose to feel. Don't let it get to you, and continue to be nice and cordial to them! <br>  You will find out that by continuing to do so, it will save you a lot of fights and heart break in the future. They will get the point that you are doing what is best for you and your children and in time they will respect you more for it all!

OxFV92hJaa	My kids are:<br>  4years 4months old.<br>  1year 3 months old.<br>  3 months old today.<br>  <br>  With a miscarriage 6 weeks prior to concieving #2. (no more for us...4 pregnancies, 3 kids in 4 years time...I'm done with all that, got fixed)<br>  <br>  I'm an at home mom. My husband works 12 to 14 hr shifts, and we have 0 support from family/friends. It's doable, but support is ideal if you have it available. <br>  <br>  My husband and I have been together 7 years on the 25th, married 5 on Aug. 13th.  Done it all together, and that's been tough at times. Family/friend support is the only think I wish we had more of. I'm 22, he's 27...maybe our young age comes into play....but I'd assume anyone around would like to have decent family/friends aroubd to simply pick up the phone on a bad day, or have lunch with.....you follow. <br>  <br>  Other than that, no it isn't that hard. You just need to figure an extra 30 mins prep time per kid when leaving the house!!! It took us YEARS to figure that out lol.|`|RLtzqQB9aa	your decision babe|`|AA10504458	well dear i my daughter has 2 girls  both born on the same date ,two years to the day , my son has two boy's both born on the same date two years apart also  ,and my sister and i were 18 months apart .my sister had 4 children they were all one year apart ,she thought it worked great because they always had a friend to play with and they were all in school together , its a saving  to pass down cloths and baby things so it has its good points.my children were born 4 and 5 years apart ,i think it would have be better closer together .|`|Oxl4cyCyaa	I personally don't but my sister does. She has 4 kids and they are all around a year or 18 months apart. <br>  She has : Owen who is 6, Jack who is 5, Sophia who is 4, and Sean who is 2.<br>  Owen and Jack are 13 months apart, Jack and Sophia are 14 months apart, and Sophia and Sean are 18 months apart.<br>  I have a 11 yr. old, 5 yr. old, & a 2 yr. old. That gap works good for me, but than again I would always liked to see how it is when they are close in age. She likes having them so close, but they fight a lot, because they are so close in age.<br>  My kids don't fight as much, because there is such a huge age gap. My first son was born when I was only 17, and his dad left me. So that is why there is such a big gap. But than my fiance came into my life and we had 2 daughters together! <br>  So I'm not really sure what wouldd preferer, but I am happy with the age gap have now!<br>  My son is great with his little sisters, and because he is so much older he looks out for them and they always know that they can go to him for help.|`|mVXBOI6Qaa	If that's what you want to do and feel that you are ready, then go for it!  I think my boyfriend and I are going to try shortly after our baby is born in May.  He is 45 and I am almost 30 and we don't want to be 99 years old and having to raise teenagers!, but still want one more after this one.  I actually had a dream that our babies were only a little over a year apart!  I have a cousin that has his 2 kids 13 months apart and they did fine!|`|0781f56992749b6d9de1b9aa61424bbbaa	Mine are 21 months apart and the older had a broken leg due to a playground accident at the time the younger one was born! <br>  <br>  Sure, it's hard having them close in age like that, dealing with a toddler and an infant, but it's not insurmountable and any age gap is going to have it's own unique challenges, anyway.   The baby spent a lot of time in her sling, being with us as we gave attention to her big brother.  She liked cuddling up like that, though, so it worked out well.  <br>  <br>  And, the close age gap (along with some encouragement from mom & dad) does have the benefit of helping them to be best friends.  Mine are in grade school now - 1st & 3rd grade (missed being one grade apart by 12 days...).  They are still friends.
7e02335d8db7a10c3a3a227b20d16521aa	I have short hair and I think 4 weeks is very reasonable to maintain my hair.  I can see where he is coming from about every 2 weeks as he must really like his hair right after it is cut.  If I were you I'd agree to every 4 weeks.  Boys and girls of this age are so insecure, your sons appearance is a tool to security and self confidence.|`|ZMGZ79fsaa	Well, to me that sounds very normal. I mean most guys I know are all obsessed with their hair (and all the girls I know too). I understand exactly what he means about not letting it get too long because then it just ruins the whole look. Every 2 weeks I think is a little silly but every 4 weeks sounds good. As long as you can afford it, if not, tell him to work for it.|`|EumQhRTgaa	Well, My dad gets his hair cut once a month on the same exact day. So four weeks. He always goes and gets a haircut on the 8th of every month. My point is that guys are weird about certain situations that not even girls would freak out about. But since they really don't freak to much just let him have his moment. ha ha. And it seems to me his arguments are hard to rebuttal with. lol.|`|Emputg1taa	That's so cute!!!! The guys at my school HATE having their hair cut short. They don't get theirs cut until they have to. We have a rule about how long guys can have their hair.I would reason with him and do every 5 weeks. That's like $20 a month and I'm sure he's worth it.|`|hWdSTmfDaa	He is correct with both aspects. my mother cut my hair herself every 10 weeks whether i needed it or not. i guess that's why im sitting here answering questions rather than enjoying the day with a women. you go boy. $40 a month is worth it. sorry mom.|`|oJlfgrPoaa	Wow. I'm 17 and have never cared that much about my hair... haha. But, i would think 4 weeks is a good comprimise, you think 6 he thinks 2... sounds fair to me. He will start not caring so much after awhile I'm sure.  <br>  <br>  Hope this helps|`|RLtzqQB9aa	tell him  hea can have it cut every 4 weeks and he has to pay ￡5 for a ￡20 hair cut|`|5KGiumXNaa	I'm a girl around that age and I had my haircut two weeks ago. <br>  <br>  It's perfectly normal to want one but my mother refuses me one- just every term max- for a trim and one major haircuts a year. <br>  <br>  If you allow him to do so, he'll might become spoilt like my older brother who's hair is now ruined (in my oppinion). <br>  <br>  Every two weeks is actually really rather stupid- no offense. It's a waste of good money and popularity doesn't entirely come from looks if that's what he's aiming at.|`|8j7FCEOraa	My husband is full grown and is picky about his hair<br>  <br>  Its not really a phase, men want to look good and be groomed well just as much as females do.|`|fFCNZrLKaa	your the parent, take control, he wants to impress the ladies i understand, but you can't stoop to his level and give him what he wants if your know it's wrong. you decide when he gets his hair cut, but he can decide how he wants it cut. its probably puberty|`|bMZ7lOfVaa	My son is the same way but now, his friend does his hair with a buzzer so he doesn't want it cut as much from the barber. I think every four weeks is reasonable.|`|DQkDQraOaa	Every 4-6 weeks is the norm. If he wants it more often, give him chores to do to earn the money for more frequent haircuts.|`|V2679vucaa	every like 3 months since when do guys care about their hair that much and i also think long hair is way more sexxy...(just my opinion)|`|xK75gTz9aa	wow ! I get mine cut every two or4 months. Thats insane every month he has to get it cut! well if he wants to be "mr. perfect" let him. As long as his grades are good!
7SKVCPcSaa	the reward system is wonderful. i do the same thing with my son.<br>  <br>  an example.. if we go to the grocery store and he is a good boy the whole time i'm shopping, when we're checking out he gets to pick out one candy to buy. he LOVES it. talks about it the whole time i'm collecting my groceries.|`|p07RwZK2aa	It's not just a good week generally... my kids have different charts for specific goals that they need to work on. <br>  <br>  For instance, my four year old son recently relapsed in his potty training and started peeing himself a lot. I now have a chart when we put a dot on the day if he pees himself. If he gets more than two dot a week he doesn't get a reward. Soon I will change it to one dot a week. <br>  <br>  My daughters are nearly 7 and they have chores to do. If they do all of them they get stars which result in a reward at the end of the week if they get enough.|`|6EXOZu6Vaa	i reward them with a thing called special time or family time. basically that night, all the attention is on the one who does good. usually we watch a movie but i only allow g movies. i have a 6 yr old, a 2 year old and a soon to come baby.|`|GcgBX392aa	yeahh it encourages them to behave
OxFV92hJaa	Hazel/greenish with a lot of brown in them...probably will eventually turn to mostly brown by the time he's hitting puberty. Pretty eyes though!!!!|`|ZYlr9TSBaa	Wow I see what you mean! I'd say a hazel/greeny colour. Lovely eyes though, he's gorgeous :)|`|1s3nddaYaa	hazelish greenish? more of greenish i think lol... they are beautiful eyes.|`|OHq5gSjJaa	He's got beautiful eyes!  I would definitely call them hazel as they seem to be in that in-between brown and green color.|`|d092475deaa61dba856bb6c8d78f69d3aa	The look green in most of the pictures. Maybe a little grayish too.|`|PDHCOrOSaa	I'd say hazel...they are greenish brownish and probably change w/ what he is wearing or w/ the lighting in the room.|`|p6cOZJYWaa	I thought they looked brownish/hazelish with a hint of green. But my eyes change colors too. They used to be blue and then they turned green and now they're turning more blueish again.|`|1CwYnj6Haa	they look hazel now.. but they also look very dark they ay change to brown. its common for babies eye color to change as they mature|`|a1uoxczTaa	they look more green. my eyes change colors like crazy also. but ur son has eyes like my brother and his eyes are beautiful. they just change alot.|`|mVD3TQkFaa	They look green to me.
8vSYo9Gqaa	In order to predict your luteal phase you really need to do some charting and temping for the next few months. If you have been TTC for 10 months, and your cycle is normal then it could be your luteal phase. You should seek the help of your doctor, TTC for 10 months is a long time without knowing what is wrong. Its always good to rule out things or get a handle on anything that might be wrong. You will thank yourself for it later.<br>  <br>  You should get a basil body thermometer ( BBT ) from EBAY. I got mine there for like 10 bucks, it works great. Check out sites like <a href="http://www.fertilityfriend.com/" rel="nofollow">http://www.fertilityfriend.com/</a> for free charts to keep track of your temperature taking and an absolute must you need to get the book called " Taking charge of your fertility " It will show you all the ins and outs of everything you need to know. I reccomend every woman buy this book!! Here is a website where you can read about it or buy it : <a href="http://www.tcoyf.com/" rel="nofollow">http://www.tcoyf.com/</a><br>  You can probably find it anywhere, its a very popular book. <br>  <br>  Those are the three things you should have to figure out your luteal phase!<br>  <br>  Anyway hope i helped, good luck!!|`|oqUlYXqtaa	your luteal phase with regular periods is usually about 14 days and it'll be the amount of days between the first day of your period and the day you ovulate.<br>  you can also ask doctors online for free, try fertilityties.com<br>  good luck!|`|V8JoRHnnaa	BBT CHARTING. I did that this month and it showed up when did i ovulate soo now i can count luteal phase.|`|CYSKtiCNaa	So, I'm in the same boat, 29 day cycle "usually", and it is a total drag  trying to fig. out the darn luteal ph.!! <br>  <br>  Is your cycle ALWAYS, ALWAYS, 29 or does it vary a day or two at times?<br>  <br>  I am going to keep an eye on this question, and also try mymonthlycycles.com....I go there, and they usually give you a FULL chart after you enter all the necessary info!<br>  <br>  Good Luck!

Lactaid is only the lactase enzyme which breaks down your dairy foods.  Some people naturally produce enough of it to break down the lactose in dairy.  You definitely should take lactaid so you can have proper nutrition and not get sick :/  You are not putting a medication in your body, its lactase which people naturally produce.  <br>  <br>  I took a college Health class last semester and learned something really interesting about it.  I guess lactose intolerance is actually the norm.  As babies, we are born producing a lot of lactase to break down the milk we need.  But as we get older we produce less and less of it because our bodies don't need as much dairy.  However the way we live and the common diets of people don't agree with this too often.  Usually our healthy meals consist of some dairy.  I thought that was interesting.<br>  <br>  Anyways, go take a pill and drink your milk!|`|ppG2smDWaa	You need to call your doctor anytime you are unsure of a medication to take while being pregnant. I would take the advice of just anyone and risk your baby's health.|`|MRvMgV7iaa	well if it makes you feel that way you shouldnt because that might be hazardous, and you should ask your doctor because he will give you the best answer.
DnNkCF6Taa	If she wants you to take her son in, I would probably see if you could become the guardian for the child.  If you are willing to take the son into your family, I would see if you could become the guardian.  If not I think the mother would toy with the son taking him away from a happy home when she breaks up with her boyfriend and giving him back to you when she gets another one.  I think all in all the boy would be safer in your place, it is either than or cal child protective services... I would say to take him into your care, and in a few weeks ask if you can become his guardian so you can make decisions involving his care if he gets injured and things of that nature.|`|CIruiZJsaa	Yes I adopted two myself if I would have not they would be pushing drugs and whoring right now. I did not do it legally  i was afraid the parents would take them back because of the financial part of it and the children wanted to be with me. I love them like they are my own they are in college now had them 9 years before they went on their own and would do it again in a heart beat. Know this that is compassion God has given you and he will help you through it if you ask. Pray upon this.|`|ggETPqedaa	What about the kids father? Does he not get a say in all of this?
bzQNHfunaa	if they have stopped then its prob bh cont..preparing u for delivery. the sex might have agrivated ur cervix bc u havent made love in a while. im 10 days frm edd and miserable and nothing ahs wked to speed me along!!!|`|bdc81a350221a05348d3b5708b5daa86aa	You probable annoyed poor baby in his/her comfy little house - I would think your waters are about to break so get your bag ready to go to hospital. You should maybe phone the hospital because you shouldn't have had pain like that just because you had sex, is baby still moving about ok?
kX1PolCUaa	Awwwwh, completely normal =] srsly, don't worry about it. And 17s not that old, I know a lot of people older than that who haven't kissed anyone. Totally just hormones =]. Don't rush it, just let it happen... it will, i promise. x|`|SLTlvqRlaa	sorry, you HAVENT kissed a girl? WTF have you never been drunk and done anything? wow|`|7SKVCPcSaa	thats normal! just because all your friends are getting girls knocked up doesn't mean you have to start kissing and having sex with random girls.<br>  <br>  anyway, i hope your friends aren't getting pregnant, but you know what i mean.|`|l8Qh5zJqaa	Its natural im 16 and I have kissed a boy and i think  about kissing my BF all the time believe me Its just Hormones|`|H90uflbFaa	hormones. believe me your completely normal & its not pathetic you just never found that girl.|`|deAyKj2Uaa	its completlet normal|`|PJSSdgf6aa	i dont think its pathetic that you havent kissed a girl and your 17.....diff. people have diff. times and what not...everyone isnt the same! and it is just hormones or i guess you just want to know/feel how it feels ...you know when a person doesnt have something they want it...just so they could know what it feels like to have it?<br>  for Ex. i never had a sidekick, i really wanted it when it first came out...all i could want was tht! lol now you can call tht pathetic! lol...its the same thing with you! jus wait for it to come to you!|`|BKHyUgs5aa	I actually find the fact you havent kissed a girl yet attractive. <br>  and as for the being shy part, dont worry too much about it, just be yourself, my first bf was to shy to even hold my hand. <br>  <br>  <br>  and yes its normal.|`|G3LuWqeLaa	Don't worry, when the time comes it will be amazing , because hopefully, you'll be doing it with the right person(: <br>  <br>  and yes it is definitely hormones|`|xarKlp0Oaa	It's completely normal. It's just your hormones.|`|RiQA4Epraa	thats fine<br>  <br>  i dont get why everybody makes a big deal outta it|`|FDXnufOaaa	just hormones, U long for the  feel of a girls lips agianst yours!!! im shy too don't worry|`|6pEDLnrzaa	Hormones<br>  Awww I think thats cute(:|`|bMZ7lOfVaa	Don't worry...it's totally normal.|`|6284df4410fd23c31eb95599791ea7abaa	What you are going through is perfectly natural. Don't feel pathetic and don't allow anyone else to make you feel pathetic! There is nothing wrong with the place you are at in your life. You will find a great girl someday and you can both practice kissing together. Trust me you aren't even close the only 17 years old out there who has never kissed, there are people much older than you!haha! GOOD LUCK!|`|aQ4SNA0faa	it could be just a phase, discover yourself and what you are meant for. And if you are meant for girls then thats great. No one will judge you, this is the 21st century. As long as your happy. And dont worry you still have lots of time..... dont be talking like you are running out of it. <br>  <br>  good luck|`|q3zTenfpaa	I don't think this is strange at all.<br>  One day, you will find the right girl, and you'll be happy that you shared this special moment with her =D<br>  <br>  best wishes to you, the shy Yuuki|`|Emputg1taa	That's ok. My bestfriend's sister is a senior and she's 18 and she just had her first kiss like a week or two ago. It's perfectly normal. :)|`|Nq34622paa	Ist normal, but you better stop being so shy or you might end up the 72 year old virgin.|`|jyVqvRxHaa	Wow normal you must be realy late bloomer|`|nFDkpoa6aa	of course its normal.... you're still really young so just chill and you'll find a girl|`|WyOYt9UJaa	i was 10 when i had my first kiss XD|`|U2PNiWHcaa	Yes, that is normal. Nothing wrong with it.|`|BmQh7wmOaa	I'd say thats normal. You just need confidence and thats really all.|`|AJFWLkjEaa	completely normal. i was shy too. but if you don't try, you will never know now will you!|`|A59qhZ1Faa	umm thats normal|`|sAu3dGB8aa	you are fine:)...|`|mXBsxKVLaa	thats very normal|`|kqk1Mqqsaa	you're a guy, right?|`|e2NKXhoOaa	its normal|`|Ni3BLlfWaa	It is 100%  natural
CdJtH0xdaa	It's better to just leave whatever they were doing in the theatre to them.|`|mpq95NF9aa	I have no idea what you're talking about, but if you're saying that a 15-year-old was doing something sexual with a 12-year-old then you need to tell an adult NOW that is disgusting and wrong.
CpevWaQ7aa	I'd kick them out and let them fend for themselfs. If there old enough to get pregnant their old enough to mind and support the child.|`|a1uoxczTaa	i would want them to finish school or work on getting a GED. i would help out, but they need to take on most of the responsibility.|`|69IbmEtaaa	Take them to the abortion clinic like it or not.|`|0BjfEel2aa	Wow your really mean. Your probly the mistake.|`|th7C1aoaaa	WOW. Now that's good parenting. LOL|`|GcgBX392aa	take care of it i guess....|`|wHnhj9ckaa	xcept it. its a blessinq if u didnt want it..<br>  id cry like crazy but its a beautiful thingg.. jsut like u :D --no gay ****|`|gpxcUtL1aa	You'd force your kid to leave school and sacrifice their entire future because of a mistake?<br>  <br>  Your job as a parent isn't just to provide food and shelter. You need to teach them how to function as adults, and when they make mistakes, you need to help them learn from them and also recover from them.<br>  <br>  If your kid makes a mistake, you can't just write them off as a failure and hope the next child does better.<br>  <br>  I my child got pregnant, I'd probably strongly suggest she put it up for adoption. If for whatever reason that wasn't an option, I'd help however I could. But you can be damned sure that I'd try to help her continue her education so she could still have a happy and successful life.<br>  <br>  You apparently would choose a year or two of financial ease for yourself, over the entire life of your child. I'm not quite so selfish, I guess.|`|nnRBufFoaa	depends on the kind of family and home life you had with your child.. but your child is human just like you, and unless your perfect, this is really hypocritical of you. if you love your child, you'll accept them for who they are and their mistakes. this is going to be your grandchild, they have your blood in them and for you to turn your back on them is disappointing. if i were you, i would stop criticizing and look for a better solution.|`|fRI8Lsjyaa	I think it sounds terrible how you talk about your child. You should love your child unconditionally. That is your own flesh and blood!!! First off I am wondering how this could have happend? When my parents noticed I had any interest in boys they put me right on the pill. Even if it was just a first kiss. I thought it seemed cheesy but they checked to make sure I took it..because they cared about me and wanted the best. They weren't going to play blind. <br>  I believe you are partially responisble. If you love your kid you would help her with raising the kid as long as needed. Don't force leaving school or doing something that will hurt them or make them resent you later in life.|`|we8adFNkaa	Thats horrible.<br>  I would give my kid a long lecture and be pissed.<br>  but I would help her as much as possible , she would still be your daugter and her kid is still your grandaughter. people make mistakes and you have to be there for people you love when they make mistakes. Even if it was a big one like that.|`|Ipj0dbrQaa	i would tell them to think about what they wanted, tell them what their options were. i would offer to bring the baby up. I would support my child in whatever they decide. i can see your point about not paying for their mistakes but my mum would have done it for me.|`|Svo5Kqbyaa	they would get all hell from me!<br>  i think i would love them too much to kick them out but i would make them go to school, then to work, and then come home to take care of the kid. during the day, i would expect the father to be taking care of the baby.|`|mwW4zIwIaa	Ask what they want to do with the baby.<br>  If they have enough responsibility to look after the baby.<br>  Tell them all of the circumstances of being a young mother.<br>  <br>  After that, support them full way.|`|mLUHItNWaa	seriously just let them stay because my sis had a baby at 17. its really hard to find a job these days. let them finish school so that they can get a better job and get paid more. make them get a part time jopb and make her pay rent or something|`|cc7a9e602a34331d1b8fc3083e410395aa	that sounds fare!<br>  <br>  although you can still be there emotionally and supportively that costs nothing!<br>  <br>  there are worse things in the world than a baby!|`|b75f927c9f10fa43476cc2ab92b409e0aa	Since boys don't get pregnant then it really isn't a child its a girl.  She has to decide what she wants to do in terms of the pregnancy.  Keep the baby, place in adoption, or terminate.  Personally, I would help her to raise the child.  Pregnancies don't always go to term and when they don't it is heartbreaking.  I wouldn't look upon it as being a negative as long as the child will be loved and wanted.  Raising a child takes a family not just a person.  The duress of raising a child is a teacher and can be looked upon as an opportunity to learn not punish.|`|pbaUAznbaa	Cause you've never in your life made any mistakes, right?  Someone under 17 wouldn't be able to find a job to pay for the kid alone.  Why would you compromise your child's future by making them quit school?  What does that accomplish?  It shows extreme bad parenting on your part.  It would be nice if you raised them properly to begin with that they would be careful and not make such a mistake, but, if you are that ignorant and feel that strongly about it, then you need to have them give the baby up for adoption.    Your kids need your support, not you tearing them down because they made a mistake.|`|AQku1KTeaa	Well,I have two boys but if one of them would get a girl pregnant at a young age,I would take the responsibility as a grand parent and watch the baby until both parents graduate from school.Meanwhile,my son would get an after school job to support their baby,with a little help from me,as needed.She wouldn't be able to move in with us because of her young age,unless her parents would disown her and the baby and they had no other place to go.|`|adXllZxsaa	If you want to maintain a relationship with your daughter I would show the child that you are there for support. I would not pay for everything but just help out. Don't desert your child.  Yes it was a huge mistake, but there is nothing you can do about it now and if you leave the kid that's not doing anyone any good, just shuffling up drama.|`|6nn7f41Faa	I would actually offer to look after my grandchild so my child could finish school. School is VERY important and crucial these days, to get anywhere in life, and will be moreso when my children are teenagers. I would encourage my child to find at least a part-time job to help offset the expenses of raising his/her child, but would not force it. As I said school is more important.<br>  <br>  I would make sure my child and grandchild, and boyfriend if necessary have a safe, loving, warm roof over their head, food in their stomach and clothes on their back. There is no way in hell I would let any of my family go without necessities.|`|KlWWh3fgaa	I'm in school full time<br>  <br>  I have a 16 month old<br>  <br>  I work weekends & somedays after school<br>  <br>  I'm not on welfare (don't worry, you do pay for her!) & I don't pass my daughter off to anyone<br>  <br>  I buy my daughter everything she needs, and I buy my necessities too with my well earned money.<br>  <br>  I don't get any financial aid from ANYBODY<br>  <br>  When I'm at school, my mom looks after my daughter, and I pay her 20 $ each week for doing so<br>  <br>  I'm graduating in June, and I'm going to be going to Collage in my home town come September, from my own money & my Collage fund. <br>  <br>  I'm moving out of my parents house in January, into our own rented house which I'll be sharing with one other single mom, in the same collage .... there is a daycare on the campus, so I'll be able to leave my daughter there, and pick her up in between classes<br>  <br>  I have to say, you personally offended me with this ''question'' ....|`|O9YU89fraa	I think you should support the child's baby. Everyone makes mistakes because they're human. Besides, the baby didn't ask to be born so its not the baby's fault. Support the baby & let it grow up not to make the same mistake. As for the mother, lecture her & tell her the downs of having a child at a young age.|`|eGn09jolaa	If my child did that, I would never ever I mean never ever kick them out of school. Thats a baddddd thing to do there. They need schooling if there going to take care of a baby. Yes I would make them to find a job but never "MAKE" them drop out of  school.you talking about a bad move on your part and a huge mistake. Use your head. You need schoolin to live in this messed up world that we live in. As a parent I believe that if you love your child you will help them through thick and thin. Thats what a parent is all about. What if you made a mistake. Would you want someone to be there for you? Well that kid needs her parents more then ever.  Never make them drop out of school thats stupid and making them live on there own. Wow what kind of sick hearted parent would do that.|`|9PaRdlwcaa	I would help out as much as I could, just because I know that I would have wanted my mother to do that for me, but she would be in a WORLD of trouble. She would have to finish school, get a part time job to pay for daycare, and basically, we would find a way to make it work simply because it has to.|`|f66ce5d864eadcad29348fd4a9871771aa	wow, then id say no wonder your daughter got pregnant young, she was looking for acceptance that she wasnt getting at home.<br>  <br>  it wouldnt be an ideal situation by any means, but if i were dumb enough to allow my child you be out and about dating and running around, i would know there was a chance, after 16, then most are old enough to date ,you need to teach them birth control,and safety. you teach them the best you can and hope for the best, if accidents  happen you deal with it, and by  ALL means help them finish school  before they try to get a full time job. do you want them doing menial labor their whole life because you wouldnt help them finish school over a mistake?....if you have kids were they planned? if not did you have help?? maybe some people ought to tihnk before they speak|`|PDHCOrOSaa	ACTUALLY.<br>  <br>  I would be there for her.<br>  <br>  Okay lets say my daughter got pregnant at 15.  Well would I insist on an abortion?  NO.  Would I kick her and my unborn Grandchild out of the house? NO.  But what I WOULD do is make sure she finishes school......but it won't be easy because she would also be getting a part time job to pay for diapers/baby clothes and she will not be given a free ride just because I'm there.  If the baby cries at night...SHE will be the one getting up w/ them and still getting up at the crack of dawn and getting her butt to school.  She will have it hard for a high school er when it could of been easy....and maybe that will make her think twice before allowing an unplanned pregnancy again.  <br>  <br>  Might I add that I'm sure my Grandchild...just as my daughter is now would be the light of my life and I would adore them.... but since it's her child regardless of her young age she would still be fully responsible for her child's needs.|`|lbmFP6ayaa	wow ur mean..its not the babys fault|`|1tmX7xbRaa	i would deal with it. although i will try to teach my daughter morals and all that other stuff it's not always easy to get a kid to do what you want them to.so after i freaked out (Hopefully not directly at her) i would just try and be as calm as possible, discuss the options and go from there (although i personally don't agree with abortion and i would hate to see my own grandchild be adopted by someone else). what else can you do? i would deal with it. however i don't think making her quit school adn get a full time job would be the answer.|`|3678a63c227fb95efdb295c02f4aa475aa	Good to know you are not short on compassion.<br>  <br>  I would encourage adoption. If she  has decided to keep it, we would have some serious decisions.  I would NOT make her drop out.  I am a single mom and if not for a college education, I would be totally screwed. Although I am a divorced single mom, it is still my burden.<br>  <br>  I have the support of my parents, friends, boyfriend, etc...I am going back to college to further my education and earning potential, as well as teaching my children that you never stop seeking knowledge, at any age.<br>  <br>  I hope you stay single and childless the rest of your life.  Good thing you are perfect.|`|zHRWklEWaa	I would make them get a part time job and support the baby, but encourage them to stay in school. I would give any additional support that my daughter truly couldn't come up with the money for.|`|RyYV3aXlaa	I guess we know that you would make a very bad mother.........good for you....I'm sure they have a club you can join or some thing........|`|uQZQTAAlaa	I would support them....and work extra hard at my job to get a little more money....but I wouldn't be giving all the money...my child would have to get a job herself.|`|p07RwZK2aa	Oh God. I have three daughters all below the age of 6 and I am dreading them being teenagers! <br>  <br>  I would try and encourage them to stay at school until the age of 18. That way they will have A levels under their belts and can get a degree later in life if they want. <br>  <br>  If it's one of my six year old daughters then I would probably still be a SAHM as my current youngest would be below the age of 10 (plus I am hoping to have another baby). So in that case I would take care of the baby for them, until they reach 18. Then I would expect them to fend for themselves with a preschool, job, rent (or their own house).|`|N89HLv92aa	Thats a little harsh. Everyone makes mistakes. But I agree that she should take respronsiblity for what she did.  I dont think you should make her quit school since she probably doesnt have long until she graduates anyway. She should find atleast a part time job though to support the baby. If she is staying in your house then that will save her a lot on rent and all of that.  Be happy that you get to be included in this joyous event in her life. I know it may be hard but being angry about it isnt going to help. Hope you find piece with your daughter. Good Luck and God Bless!!|`|rGav3F9laa	thats what wrong with some parents now a dayz<br>  well why don't parents sit down and discuss about what happened and who is really at fault here<br>  then give the teen options on what she could do,<br>  if she decides to keep it i would support her decision and expect her to take care of the child but i would help her out|`|MNY5gMGBaa	I would support them, they know they have done wrong, but they want to do right by bringing up this child. I would make them get a job, so they could stay in the house, but i would support them all the way :) Hope this helps|`|nLXfeQbpaa	Your obviously not a loving mother. <br>  everyone makes mistakes. <br>  I would love and care for her. Yes she would work. But she would also finish school because that is the most important thing to be successful.|`|DQkDQraOaa	You are still responsible for your child until they are of legal age to leave your house.
VSpqYAabaa	Sounds a little too close to "HAZMAT",<br>  Imagine the teasing she'd get at school...<br>  Just a thought.|`|CkecSp4Uaa	Not particularly, no.  As so many others have pointed out it can so easily be changed to hazmat, and you better believe that the bullies in school are going to do just that.  But as weird names go, it's not really that bad.  It could certainly be worse.|`|pWoMaxwkaa	If you live in the time of Ancient Aztecs , sure.<br>  But if you're in America , I think if I had that name I would be a little insecure about it.<br>  Your choice.|`|j0zDQQG2aa	Any name considering how they would feel about the bullying that may result.|`|CkIeCNS4aa	It sounds a bit like hazmat...  As in hazardous materials.|`|Cdp02p0Xaa	eh its alrite.|`|f1006988bdbdd7ae5e5276623f046308aa	Kind of sounds like a machine to me.<br>  (A Azamat Machine)<br>  But hey if you like it , then that is what matters. And I do not think your little girl could or would be embarrassed by it.|`|dUeDmb7raa	its sounds dangerously close to *** mat. be careful, you don't want to giev a kid a name thats just begging to be made fun of<br>  <br>  <br>  remember that kids are mean|`|Fx9nJ6mPaa	I think its very nice & unique, & we need more names like this, great choice :)|`|6iCOMx8laa	It sounds like Hazmat, which here is Hazard Materials...  I'd vote no.|`|2pQUMKb2aa	Probably not unusual but not my favorite|`|RyYV3aXlaa	I don't know......it kind of sounds like a door mat or some thing ?|`|iyEYXiq8aa	It's ok|`|QLC16aRCaa	no... not at all... sorry but i can't even say it|`|mUB0EiJoaa	The question bodes... is this an regional name, something to do with your family?  If it does no problem but remember kids can be cruel, so Azamat rimes with HAZMAT, the people that respond to chemical disasters and such.  One has to alway think what someone else might say or think, and how is that name reflect on your child. Example we just bought a puppy, a mini schnauzer (german breed), we called her Schatsee, meaning cutie in german.  What did the kids call her in the neighborhood...Schatsee the Nazi..soooo we changed it to Star.  You have to alway think one step ahead and how it will possilbly change your child's life.  Its not about you or your family, its about your kid.  GOOD LUCK TO YOU and enjoy her.|`|491081dc98460e2ecf56d3757c340053aa	I think what ever you want to name your baby girl! Its a unique name and you have a say in it so if you change you mind then that's ok. The mother always picks a perfect name for the baby! LoL good luck and i like the name! =)|`|qjjY07Lsaa	No, that's not my favorite name for a little girl. Make sure you give her a name that won't be made fun of. I like the name Kari. Pronounced like the word "car" with a "y" on the end of it.|`|2MtDp74raa	sounds like "HAZMAT" if your pronounce it like it appears (in US english anyway). you know, the abbreviation for "Hazardous Materials"|`|xp0t4Iasaa	Perhaps if your baby girl is ruler of a demon underworld.|`|fAN8snFdaa	is a bit weird to be honest - you have to look at what the kids at school will call her for short ?? <br>  so best get back to the drawing board|`|6g554wvIaa	idn it depends on if ur name is Imaneffingcrackhead?|`|5GYbkhjQaa	I don't like it.<br>  But it's your choice!<br>  Hope this helps!|`|1EeVYus1aa	ooh not really.<br>  i think your kid might kid made fun of|`|ryHdojcIaa	noooooooooooo!!!!!!! they will have a tough time in school|`|OSQOnrnHaa	NO it sounds like a pet name|`|mEimKc7Haa	nah|`|vrImLiv0aa	erm how you pronounce it?
k3V2CA81aa	I tend to ovulate around CD16 or CD17.....but in my 18 months of TTC, I have ovulated as early as CD12 and as late as CD24.|`|ObngKaoWaa	i just started ttc and as i had read,according to my 28 days regular cycle i shud've ovulated on march 3rd(i had my period on teh feb 17th and usually lasts 6 days) but i got a neg on opk that day and i also didnt have any cm,i got a positive on march 4th.so i guess i am one of those who ovulate later than 14 days.|`|gVa8nO2Laa	personally im like clockwork but i have a friend who Os kinda late in her cycle. everyones different!|`|u2enNfTJaa	I ovulate between day 15 -18 of my cycle. <br>  <br>  I think this month it was day 16.|`|oqUlYXqtaa	if you have regular cycles (get your period every 28-31 days you'll ovulate most likely half way through your cycle. but if you're taking fertilty meds you could ovulate early or late in the cycle, you can also ask doctors online for free try fertilityties.com<br>  good luck!!

You say you and your boyfriend have been together for two years.  I am sorry but you can't be a 100% sure he was true to you.

It might be embarrassing to you, but they probably get asked questions similar to yours often.
7SKVCPcSaa	if its a clear to milky-ish white sticky liquid, you're fine. if its anything other than that, go to your doctor. but its most likely just colostrum that your breast start making around now. which is just storing up for baby so you can breast feed if you choose to do so.<br>  <br>  everything is normal!|`|eeyGYRcPaa	you should always tell your doctor about everything your body does while pregnant and he/she will let you know if there is something to worry about. most things that happen during pregnancy, such as leaking breast, cramping, discharge, etc are normal but sometimes they can lead to problems. like i said just keep you dr updated and you'll be fine. :D|`|WLLqdPXeaa	Yes, it is normal.
f779f67dd34b7dc477bf39dc3b5542bbaa	I noticed that my son was trying to walk a lot more at daycare than at our home. I figured out that out furniture was spaced too far apart, so he was scared to start walking, as the next thing he could grab on to was so far away. At daycare, however, there are tons of big toys for the kids, so he would go from one to the next.<br>  <br>  Try arranging furniture around a little so if your little one wants to venture out, there won't be quite so far of a distance between her start and finish. I think that will build up her confidence.<br>  <br>  Or let her walk and hold one of her hands, so she doesn't fall. good luck, time to baby proof everything LOL.|`|GfMTp3Woaa	kick her down a flight of stairs :)!!!<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  hopes this helps!!!|`|ltfeYdr5aa	She will walk whne she is ready, 8 mths is before the average so be thankful and enjoy her progress as she makes it.|`|0vpDDM8aaa	get a walker-toy.  they have toys with wheels and a handle that kids can hang onto and that way they can balance better.  check walmart.

FkGh0LuWaa	If you don't need the money then stay home.  I am a stay at home mom and I would not go back to work unless I had to.  Just tell your husband that you will go back to work if you need the money or when she starts school so this way you can be with her and don't have to worry about someone else watching her.<br>  Edit:  Their is no way I would get a job and have my kids stay with others just because my husband doesn't whant to work as hard any more.  You need to put your foot down and tell him that other you are not getting a job or he will be the stay at home dad and take care of her while you work.
mpq95NF9aa	That depends on when you usually get your period. It hasn't been a full month, so it's hard to tell from the information you gave. Get a test or go to the doctor. I doubt you're pregnant if you used two condoms and neither broke, but any time you do any sexual act there is a chance of pregnancy. So be careful, and if you're worried just take a test or see your gyno. Blood tests for pregnancy are pretty foolproof. Good luck.|`|X9JSlC6Iaa	Take a test.<br>  Duh.

eMSP740Taa	NO...man up to your mistake and if she is pregnant...you both need to be responsible about it. Don't listen to anyone who says to drink this or that in order to abort the baby, if she is pregnant. Cause all that will do is make the baby come out with a defect. Ask her what day of cycle she was on when you guys had sex. Because if she was on a day that she wasn't fertile, chances are that there is very little chance of her being pregnant. If she doesn't know how to tell what day of her cycle she was on, then ask her what day did she begin her last period. The first day of her period is day 1 of her cycle. Women are most fertile and likely to get pregnant between days 12-16.<br>  <br>  RE: THERE ARE NO OTHER DAYS TO CONSIDER.THE FIRST DAY OF HER LAST PERIOD IS DAY 1. SO COUNT THE DAYS FROM DAY 1.

2wyDALHgaa	Something doesn't sound right to me with all of this (aside from the fact that it's posted in the wrong section).  If the animal was dropped off at a shelter it was not abandonment unless someone just dropped it off by tying it out front in the middle of the night and leaving it there for someone to find in the morning.  <br>  <br>  I've worked for two large animal rescues over the years and people surrender animals all the time.  The only person I've seen get charged was the guy who tied up his underweight (purebred) Bloodhound outside of the local PetSmart one night so that the manager found her tied up there in the morning.  <br>  <br>  If she (or you) just tied him up and left him at the pound then yes, I can see why someone was cited for that.  <br>  <br>  As to the state of the dog when your friend got him.  Kennel Cough is a fairly common ailment and it's essentially just an upper respiratory infection brought on by contact with other dogs in a kennel type situation and by excessive barking.  Its easily treatable if you wanted to and generally goes away in two weeks on it's own if left untreated.  The worms are the same way.  One or two pills (depending upon the size of the dog) and the worms are generally gone.  In most cases they want to give a second dose in a couple of weeks just to make sure that they are gone.  If your friend had taken the dog to a vet she would have had, perhaps, a $100 vet bill for everything.<br>  <br>  It's entirely reasonable that the dog was up on the shots (excluding rabies), had been dewormed and was vet checked and that it could still have worms and kennel cough after having been in a kennel.  They are common and easily treatable conditions for a dog in that situation and was nothing to panic about.  Any contract from a shelter that I have ever worked with does state what the condition of the animal is at the time it was adopted BUT it also says that the new owners are to get the animal vet checked within a period of time after adoption, usually 7 days.  Sounds to me like she didn't do that and that everyone over reacted and left the animal in some unreasonable situation at the shelter that constituted abandonment.  <br>  <br>  Next time, take the animal to the shelter when it's open and drop it off properly.  People who do that do not get cited for abandonment.|`|eKtEWrcmaa	There isn't anything protecting you from this except yourself. You have to do research when adopting an animal just like you do in any life decision. Honestly she sounds like someone who should not adopt or has no idea what she is doing. <br>  <br>  Kennel cough is a common issue in shelters because it is airborne. Its not an expensive treatment and can be resolved quickly once treatment begins. <br>  <br>  The dog likely was dewormed but it takes some time for them to be eliminated and the deworming must happen 2-3 times 3 weeks apart from each other. <br>  <br>  She had the contract and failed to read it over properly before signing and that is her own fault. They shouldn't have to read it word for word for her. She is a grown up and should know never to sign anything without reading the entire document. That goes for any contract not just with getting an animal.<br>  <br>  Heartworm and the worm you saw are not the same thing. The one you saw was either a tapeworm or a roundworm. Neither are a big deal for treating. You do not see heartworms.<br>  <br>  If she dropped him outside of the facility when it was closed then yes she will face charges and should. If she went inside and filled out proper paperwork with the shelter then she shouldn't. Was it the same shelter she got the dog from?|`|UO1QE8phaa	This is the PEOPLE adoption section -- you should have posted this in "pets".<br>  <br>  As the saying goes -- caveat emptor.|`|E7MgO2pZaa	All of the conditions that you described are pretty common. Worms and kennel cough aren't extremely contagious to people. The only way you can get worms from an animal is if you are not washing your hands after you handle their feces. You can normally find a lowcost vet clinic in your area that will deworm your cat or dog for ten to twenty dollars. I would check with my local humane society to find out what programs are available in the area. <br>  <br>  Your friend signed a piece of paper saying that the shelter cannot guarantee a healthy animal. In a court of law, what the gentleman said about the shots would not hold up over the contract that she signed, because since there is no evidence that he said that, its considered "heresy".<br>  <br>  The best thing she can do at this point is to get a lawyer and fight having to pay the fine and possible jail time. If she can't afford one, I would suggest you google "legal aid" and your zip code in order to seek legal aid services that are provided to those who cannot afford to pay for a lawyer.|`|iVcaB9h7aa	Not that I've ever heard of.<br>  <br>  We found our Heinz 57 at a shelter.  She was three years old.  Within a few months she had a bite record with Animal Control.  She came with serious anxiety issues and she bit when she was nervous.<br>  <br>  We paid the fines and had her quarantined per law.<br>  <br>  Flash forward a little.  Her anxiety got worse.  We spent about $800 on aggressive dog training to help us understand what her triggers were and how to help her relax.<br>  <br>  Flash forward to last fall.  She got desperately ill.  We almost lost her.  She was diagnosed with Addison's Disease, a serious and lethal disorder.  Her vet bills over the last five months have been $2,000+.<br>  <br>  Shelter animals often come with issues you don't see on Day One and those issues can be dangerous, heart-wrenching, and/or expensive.  I'm truly sorry your friend found this out the hard way.  I know how sad it can be to find out your furry friend came with "special needs".
3F8f1SoQaa	I would give him a week or so to get used to not having the cast on. My son was in a body cast for a broken thigh at 19 months old. He was casted for 5 weeks. He stood up very shakey the first few days, and we encouraged him to step holding onto our hands. Within a week or so he was walking on his own, although with a bad limp ( he would actually drag his bad leg behind him). Within a month or so he was walking stright, and within 6 months no one could tell that he had been casted. As a matter of fact, at 3.5 years old he is gross motor advanced!<br>  <br>  I would try to help him the best you can...encourage him to stand up and take little steps holding onto furniture. Maybe explain to him that his muscles are not as strong in that leg since he could not use it for 4 weeks. That he needs to stand and do things to make it stronger and it will feel better every day.|`|a1uoxczTaa	he probably can walk ok, he is most likely just scared because of hurting it before.
rq3Q0PbPaa	With each pregnancy, everything gets stretched out a bit more.....and with that and age...your skin looses elasticity. So with each pregnancy you are going to show sooner and sooner. My first pregnancy I didn't show until almost six months, my second one you could tell at about two months...although second time was twins, that might have had a bit to do with it. This being your third, you are likely going to show much sooner than with the other two.|`|GxlkhRfoaa	I am on my first pregnancy and I noticed a difference in my body very early on as well.   I have been showing through clothes since about oh 16 weeks.  Maybe a little earlier.  I am now 20 weeks and it's very apparent.|`|oWAUb6vpaa	Every pregnancy is different. However, women tend to show earlier in subsequent pregnancies as the uterus has previously stretched out and so stretches out easier for the next baby. <br>  You could be simply experiencing weight gain or if you really think it's baby, there's always the possibility of twins (or more.) Yikes! lol <br>  Most people can tell when a woman's pregnant around 4.5-6 months gestation. <br>  <br>  Congratulations on your new baby!|`|JkBbdg72aa	The thing to remember is you are older with this pregnancy than you were with the first two. I think age has alot to do with your body, and with weight gain. Your metabilizim slows down as you get older.|`|bzQNHfunaa	it depends...every pregnancy just like every baby is different. im now wkin on #7 and didnt "show" until i was about 5 mos..then i just looked like i hadda huge turkey day meal..lol|`|5puE2Qfpaa	With my 3rd it was noticable at 2 1/2 months.

t1fx6kXcaa	It wasn't what I thought it would be either. I didn't find it fun. I found it stressful. Just when I thought my son was eating, he'd smile and slowly ,deliberately dribble out the puree until he was covered in it. Then he'd cry for more. I also got freaked out by all the gagging. He picked up on on this and would deliberately cough and even turn red when I tried to feed him. When my family or in-laws would come over and feed him he was good as gold. As soon as I went anywhere near him, he'd start the fake gagging. He didn't stop doing that until he was 11 months old.<br>  And it is time consuming and I (secretly) dreaded feeding him solids three times a day. It gets easier though. Soon Kyleigh will be eating finger food and throwing bits of food far and wide and painting with it, lol. And when she's older she'll feed herself while deliberately spitting out huge mouthfuls all over the floor. So much to look forward to, Lol.<br>  My son has only just become a "good boy" at meal times and he's nearly two.....|`|5e4e7e69ebfb2ce16276f743ee45219eaa	This is just the beginning of many 'disappointing' milestones.  You can't wait for them to walk, then you realize how much more they can reach.  You can't wait for them to talk, then you realize the only word they say for about 3 years is "why."  It just goes downhill from there...  ;)|`|8yTP3jO8aa	I was also really excited to start my baby on solids.  But, then I realized what a mess and pain it was, researched baby-led weaning as opposed to parent-led weaning, and decided that there really is a reason that I could let my baby determine when and how he ate solids.  So, I threw out the cereal and chucked the jars, waited until he was between 6-7 months old, and let him start eating family foods with us.  Really, once a baby can pick up a piece of food, get it to her mouth, gum/chew, and swallow, there is absolutely no need for purees.  And, since solids are just for practice until about 10 months old anyway, there was no reason I needed to fight through spoon feeding.  Yay!!!|`|wTeJulT5aa	Maybe your baby isn't quite ready yet.  I started feeding my baby rice cereal at 5 months, and she was ready for it.  She eats it very well.  She doesn't intentionally spit it out.  She does start to put her bib in her mouth sometimes, but I just move her hands away, and she's fine.  I'm quite pleased at how things are going.  She's 5 months 2 weeks, and I've only fed her cereal, carrots, and banana.  She doesn't seem to like the banana much, but I'm going to keep giving it to her everyday until she loves it.  :)|`|g4KHXYFPaa	The way I see it is if babies are hungry, they'll eat.  <br>  <br>  You might want to google what's really in baby food.  I know parents who cook food, and puree some of it for the baby.|`|z6IekuwSaa	Wow you just described our experience. lol. Hopefully it gets better. I'm not even sure how much really makes it to her stomach|`|KDb96QS7aa	I held off till 7 months to give solids. I tried twice as soon as my son turned 6 months, and his stomach was upset so I decided to wait. But I will confess this was definitely in the back of my mind ... "I won't have to wash any extra dishes or clean anything up off the floor for another month."  So even when I started solids I basically skipped all pureed foods. At 7 months he got hard breadsticks to chew on and I made him teething biscuits. At 8 months he started getting soft finger foods. That's a much easier clean up!  I can't imagine searching out dried up rice cereal in the crevices of the high chair!  That's so cute that she does that though, you have to get a video of it.|`|OHq5gSjJaa	Ugh I was sooo disappointed with how feeding solids went for my baby.  I started at 6 months.  I was especially disappointed because my niece (2 weeks younger than my baby) took to solids like a pro while my baby did exactly the things you described.  Feeding her was an awful chore...  and then it got even worse because instead of just happily blowing raspberries as the spoon got close, she started to get angry, and cry, and hit the spoon away making an even bigger mess.  At about 7 months I decided to skip the pureed stuff because she still wasn't getting the hang of it, and decided to start feeding her little bites of table food.  I started with gerber puffs, tiny bites of banana and avocado, and she actually started to eat and like these things!  Then I moved on to very well-cooked carrots, squash, peas (not mushed, but just individual peas), well cooked bites of pasta, toast, muffins, etc.  Now she is almost 9 months and she will eat basically whatever I do, just in teeny little bites.  She still doesn't eat very much, but she is learning to feed herself and it is ok that she still gets most of her intake from formula.  <br>  <br>  What I would suggest for you is to wait another week or two and try again.  When she hits 6 months then start offering her a solid meal of either pureed fruit or veggie once a day.  Try giving her her own spoon to hold.  When she starts to bring her spoon up to her mouth to chew on, then sneak-attack put a spoonful of food in her mouth.  If spoon-feeding continues to go badly after a couple weeks I would start table foods kinda like I did.  You can google an idea called baby-lead weaning which is basically the idea of skipping pureed foods and going straight to table foods.  I didn't really plan on doing this with my daughter, but she had such a bad time with the pureed baby foods that I started doing this, and it has worked really well for us!  Good luck!|`|ay8tXLD2aa	Ohhhh my son did that as well.  I started him at 6 months, and he was at the "raspberry" stage as well, and LOOOOOOOOOOOOVED to make raspberries with pear puree. In fact, that's about all he thought pear puree was meant for!  Little stinker!   <br>  <br>  I just didn't react - no laughing, but no getting angry either - kept it relaxed and low key.  It's all new for her - she's never had anything other than milk in her mouth and it will take her a while to figure out what she's supposed to do with it.  But, once she does, she will be grabbing at your hand to get more more more!  <br>  <br>  I admit though, many days I was silently fuming mad -- I have taken the time to choose, buy, wash, peel, chop, cook, puree, measure, freeze, thaw, warm, and feed you this food. And all you do is spit it out!!! Argh!   It will be a while though before she is up to three meals a day, remember at first it's just all about learning and fun, and so there's no pressure, if you miss a meal, oh well.  By the time she's up to three meals it will be because she's ready for them. And as someone above said, then you'll be cleaning it off of the walls!|`|nyZMtNFfaa	I went through the exact same thing!  My daughter is now 8 months old and it's become MUCH easier.<br>  <br>  A few tips:<br>  <br>  1) Be patient - sit with her at the table and have bites of your food in between trying to sneak the spoon in her mouth!<br>  <br>  2) Let her suck on the soon - sucking on the spoon helps her get the food down more easily<br>  <br>  3) Try giving her cheerios for finger foods.  Surprisingly, cheerios (or even better yet Nutrios - the Heinz version of cheerios without added sugar or salt) are a GREAT 'first' food.  This was recommended by the nutritionist from our local health authority.  They 'melt in the mouth' so are safe for younger babies.  I found that finger foods gave me a (kept her more occupied) while trying to feed my little one and helped refine her fine motor skills.  Note: I would hold off introducing any other finger foods until she is better able to move the food around her mouth.<br>  <br>  4) Try biscuits - I used the Heinz toddler biscuits, which are great occasionally, but do have added salt and sugar, so I'd limit their intake.  I 'cheated' and used the biscuits to dip into the cereal or the veggie mash and she enjoyed sucking the food off the biscuit.<br>  <br>  5) Try a variety of cereals.  The doctor recommended a beginner oatmeal, rather than the rice cereal, which can cause constipation.<br>  <br>  6) Plastic bibs rock!  I found a great bib at Shopper's Drug Mart which is a soft plastic and easy to wash - much better than washing 3 bibs a day as I was doing before.<br>  <br>  7) Hang in there!  It gets better  It took a month or two, but my daughter is now a champion eater.<br>  <br>  Best of luck.|`|68c6B8dRaa	Did you know you don't even have to do that? The cereal is junk and a healthy baby does not need to be spoon-fed.<br>  <br>  Useful: <a href="http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index?qid=20080321134522AAJdBps">http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index?...</a><br>  <a href="http://www.borstvoeding.com/voedselintroductie/blw/engels.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.borstvoeding.com/voedselintro...</a><br>  <br>  Google "baby-led weaning."|`|lGcpXteaaa	Oh, i still hate dinner times!<br>  I didnt like the spoon feeding route so i decided to let her decide what she wanted.

fI0BcqxUaa	When my kids were 4 years old I loved playing games with them.  We played all kinds of games and I especially liked the ones that I could interject a little bit of learning into...these were our five favorites:<br>  <br>  1. Math Egg Hunts - We would do egg hunts with plastic eggs (great for indoor or outdoor) filled with pennies.  Once all the eggs were found we would sit down and practice counting them up for extra counting practice.<br>  2. Word Recognition Game - I would hang signs up around the house labeling simple items such as "door", "chair", and "clock" and we would practice saying the words.  Then a few days later I would see if they could read the words without the objects!  This sight word recognition helped both my kids become early, confident readers.<br>  3. Build The Highest Tower - My husband would play this game with the kids over the weekend and they loved it!  They would build a tall tower with their legos and try to touch the ceiling with it before it fell.<br>  4. Rock/Shell Painting - If we had collected shells from a beach trip, the kids loved to get their washable paints out and spend an afternoon painting shells outside.  Or, we would go on a rock hunt around the yard for great rocks to paint.  We still have lots of these painted items decorating our children's rock garden in the backyard.<br>  5. Hide and Go Boo!  -  My son loved this game and still talks about it today (he is 7 now).  We would turn out all the lights and play hide-and-seek in the dark!  The kids would be supplied with flashlights to help them guide their way during their searches.  Then once found, hiders would have to yell "BOO"!  Great game for Halloween!<br>  <br>  Hope these inspire you to create even more games for you and your little one to enjoy!  :-)|`|1F0nKNpIaa	Monploy checkers cards connect 4 hangman hide and seek and old maid|`|1VdgsZPoaa	Hide and Go Seek and the rules change all the time.

Kids are the best piece of exercising equipment you could own IMO ;)<br>  <br>  Sometimes she gets on the computer and I get on my laptop and we play online games together against each other and if she wins them she gets a piece of candy or a cookie and if *I* win (which is always ;) ) she has to give me a kiss.|`|WqkFJ2Pgaa	My son's three and can't yet follow even simple games like Memory, Chutes and Ladder, or Candyland, so we pretty much make up our own games. In checkers, you can switch colors with your opponent without warning and move any piece to any space on the board, red or black. The object of the game is to knock as many pieces off the table as possible. I really like your idea for hot and cold! We'll try that one soon. When the snow melts, we'll be playing some outdoor games, too.

Like Erin said it will shrink and your baby won't Lol The way i see it is that sizes usually shrink to in between sizes, which don't exist. A 6 months will shrink into like something in between 3-6 months. Or i also like to think of it like this, a washed and dried 2T is like a size 24 months brand new Lol 24 months are a bit smaller and are onezies whereas 2T are usually t-shirts.|`|9fCjtbfaaa	Janie and Jack for my daughter runs a little big.

Please don't use the rag mag as a baby name book!!!!|`|1OpcR7bZaa	Landon sounds dumb<br>  Names like London and Paris<br>  Mackenzie is a last name and should not be used as a first name!<br>  People misspelling names on purpose so their kids name will be more unique and when they use capital letters that are not needed.|`|CkecSp4Uaa	"Unique" spellings probably has to top my list.  More often than not there is nothing unique about them because everyone is misspelling the name in exactly the same way (generally by substituting Y or X for I or S) and it just looks like someone failed their third grade spelling lessons.  Clearly "hukt on fonics" didn't work for them!<br>  <br>  "Combination" names has to be a very close second.  Occasionally you can come up with a nice name by combining parts of two other names, but most of the time you just end up with something stupid.  And if you're really unfortunate you end up with a name that sounds more like a social disease than something you would call a child.  Why do you have to combine two names anyway?  Doesn't a child who is going to grow up to be a unique individual deserve their own distinct name?<br>  <br>  Which brings me to the traditional naming trend of giving the child their father's or mother's name (except maybe if the mother or father is deceased).  It just seems bizarre to me to give a child the exact same name as one of their parents.  Really, who has that little self confidence that they need to name their child after themselves.  I'm also not big on naming a child after a living relative regardless of their relation...it just gets too complicated around the holidays.<br>  <br>  I'm also not a big fan of any of the -ayden names.  I just don't like the way most of them sound.  I do still like Aiden, but Hayden, Jayden, Kaiden, etc just don't do anything for me.  I don't know that I'd go so far as to say I despise it though.
S3qmkm2Vaa	yes it is. my daughter goes to bed between 7 and 730pm and sleeps through the night. when she goes to bed later (like 9pm) she will wake up in the middle of the night. the reason they say that is because babies who stay up later get more tired and fussy and so it is harder for them to fall asleep. i'm sure you've seen evidence of this!<br>  now, your baby is very young. all babies are different in setting in their sleep schedules. mine didn't start sleeping a good 4-5 hours until she was almost 5 months old. <br>  some tricks that could help are: giving him a teaspoon of infant cereal in his last bottle for the night. my pediatrician recommended this so that my daughter could have a fuller stomach and therefore not wake up so often to feed. <br>  establish a good nighttime routine. whether it's a bath and then reading and then sleep or something else (this is what i do), the baby will get used to this and then realize when its bedtime and eventually fall asleep on his own. make sure to consistently do this at the time you want him to go to bed. the earlier the better (730 works best for me)<br>  make sure his room is not too hot or cold, that it is sufficiently dark and not noisy. <br>  these were all things that helped my daughter sleep a little longer each time. as he gets older he will start sleeping more. <br>  hope this helps!|`|44BEm1Uhaa	Good luck...I have the same problems.|`|1hciyvKdaa	At this age, babies rule the situation. Its best to follow along, get helpl with feedings so you can rest more. The more they become observant to the world around them, the more they want to be a part of it. Make sure your still swaddling baby, if you use a swing or bouncer try using it less so that baby is ok with feeling of nothingness. My oldest daughter relies on a swing and bouncer so much she has alot of problmes with keeping her baby down. My youngest has a baby a few weeks old and after seeing the lack of sleep her sister gets, she does not use a bouncer or swing ever yet. Her baby can lay down and sleep, my oldest daughters son is now 4.3 months old and still barely ever sleeps unless she lays with him, put him in a swing or bouncer. My kids once they were a few months old finally got somewhat of a pattern for sleep, none used a swing until way older and all did pretty good sleep wise.<br>  I took my children for a nightly walk around out apartments, and when it got tough, thats when I did my grocery shopping, they would fall asleep in the car and stay asleep as I brought them upstairs. You might try that too. Good luck, it will change soon enough, I know we all wished it was way sooner than later though eh!!|`|0zkCGlNUaa	I had the same problem with my triplets. When they were about 2-3 months old, they weren't sleeping as well through the night.  One thing that may help, is to not have him sleep as much during the day. That way, in the evening, he will be more tired. Get him in a good routine. Give him a bath.. Then give him a bottle right before bed. Maybe sing him a song or read him a book. Soothing music, I find helps my triplets go to sleep. It gets them more tired & ready for bed. After doing this a few times, they got in the swing of things. They started to realize that around 8:30-9, that is when they were most tired & went to bed. It takes time, just be patient with it.  =)  Good Luck!|`|fUMbnU6taa	You could by one of those mobile things that hang over the crib. Or feed him a warm bottle of milk before bed and sing him a song. Or just put him in your arms and rock him to sleep. He will go to sleep and stay asleep for awhile. If u did all the options and he still only sleeps that much, visit the doctor. :P God bless you.|`|d21b8a886cea9e7687d2a1f509f75f80aa	if your problem is night sleeping then you want to let him sleep less during the day<br>  <br>  if it is sleeping for longer periods then just do more activities with that will make him tired. also don't let him sleep for as long as he wants, it is ok to wake him if you feel he has been sleeping too long|`|GyRIM1Uyaa	Right before you put him down for the night, feed him in a quiet dark room and whenever he wakes up, dont flip lights on or talk to him, quietly feed him or rock him in the dark back to sleep. Good luck!
rhPCJfeuaa	I would absolutely get a restraining order against him.  I wouldn't allow him anywhere near me or my kids.  And, I would come clean with the court about anything illegal that his family is into so that they wouldn't be able to take the children for unsupervised visits, either.<br>  <br>  You don't deserve to be treated that way, and more importantly, your children don't deserve to live in fear.  they may both be under the age of 2, but the stress and tension is absorbed by both and very damaging over time.<br>  <br>  Do what's best for YOUR family.|`|mZi7R0Enaa	YES get that restraining order ASAP! This man doesn't deserve to be with YOU or YOUR KIDS and you need to make sure you never let him around you again. He needs to take a look that Chris Brown is facing *jail time* for beating Rhianna and that you too will send him to jail! Good luck, sweetie!|`|fdnbXfvfaa	I would without doubt get a restraining order, and make sure he didn't come near my children.<br>  Do whats right by yourself and your kids. No one deserves to be treated like that.|`|1VdgsZPoaa	I would without a doubt get a restraining order.  If he is willing to hurt you, who's to say he won't hurt the kids.  You need to get yourself out of that situation no matter what sort of family problems you could have.  I am sure your family would rather see you getting out of there, then you and both of your babies dead.|`|LMza4vO7aa	YES! For the benefit of both you and your kids!
dnG7fhnbaa	It's good to start talking to her now because between the ages of 8 and 10 is when silly rumors start circulating the playground and kids end up with the wrong idea about sex.<br>  <br>  I was brought up knowing the basics from a very young age, as was my husband and when out daughter is born we will answer her questions openly and honestly.<br>  <br>  By the time a child is 8 she should understand how the reproductive system works in men and women and should know the difference between male and female genitalia. She should also be beginning to understand the basics regarding contraception. It's also a good idea to teach her the emotional side of sex as well as just the physical to avoid promiscuity later in life.|`|fdnbXfvfaa	My 5 year old know the basics of sex, because she asked where babies come from. Whenever they are curious I suppose. 8 is fine to I would think|`|1VdgsZPoaa	I started talking to my daughter when she was 6 and she asked where babies came from.  She knows the basics, like the difference between a vagina and a penis and how each reproductive system works.  <br>  <br>  Honestly, I think 8 years old would now be the time because she is entering puberty and changes relating to these reproductive systems will start to take place.|`|x5ftqjo5aa	I think i learned about sex when i was six and it grossed me out so much that i wanted to be a nun for years<br>  <br>  not even kidding! LOL<br>  <br>  now i'm a nympho!|`|0d8fd99482e78511337c03d547560306aa	I think when they start to ask you should answer, but be age appropriate with your answers. Maybe ask your ped for advise.|`|nfb6VTK5aa	By 9 or ten she should know.|`|HtyUrjrFaa	They'll learn either from school, doing it themselves or you. By talking to your child it'll set a better example. I think that 8 years is a good age to tell them some about sex. Let her ask questions about it. She might be comfortable knowing very little or she may want to know a lot. <br>  <br>  Schools teach sex education from K-8th even if you don't think it.. they do. It might not be about "sex" but it'll come off as showing the differences "this is a girl, this is a boy". etc.|`|1F0nKNpIaa	I think that is a good age but you start with basics and keep it simple like You're wondering where you came from? You were made in Mommy's tummy, and that's where you grew until you were ready to be born." While you don't want to sound like a doctor, you should use the correct names for body parts ("penis" and "vagina," not "wee-wee" or "pee-pee"). It will lessen any sense that sexual topics are off-limits and embarrassing.|`|FLeHvtcAaa	Well, I'm not a parent, so I'm just going to take a shot in the dark here.<br>  <br>  I don't think a child, especially a girl, would really take in that kind of knowledge until it became relevant (i.e. puberty).|`|AmSBaEeQaa	To be honest there isn't a set age. If your child is relatively mature then go for it. They'll be learning about it at school in a year or so.|`|cZwFPjt3aa	I have been thinking about this too..my daughter is 3 and I think I am going to start to help her understand about it when she is around 5/6
wG9vlIoJaa	Congratulations, your baby is officially a person of his own.<br>  He just realized that he can do more than just lying in his crib, that he has options.<br>  The carrier idea is great (I was too stupid to use complicated slings).<br>  <br>  Soon, he will want to crawl and explore all the dangerous stuff in your lower cupboards while you clean, etc. And as soon as he stands up, he begins reaching for breakables on your tables.<br>  And the best thing about it is that there's no use disciplining him for those thing, because he won't understand any of those, until much later.<br>  <br>  That's just the way it is. Babies grow.<br>  I wasn't prepared for that either... lol. I have no breakables left.<br>  But we can't expect a 7 year-old to just lie in his bed staring at a mobile, can we?<br>  But I'm sure a 17 year-old would do exactly that (lie in bed while you do all the works).|`|723QHuicaa	He isnt spoiled - he doesnt have the cognitive ability to even know how to play you. He is likely at an age where he is noticing his surroundings and doesnt want to be laid in his crib when he can be up and seeing things. Have you thought of a baby carrier, he is happy to be up, you have 2 free hands to do the dishes or whatever.|`|68c6B8dRaa	"he was able to just lay in his crib and hang out and watch his mobile while I'm cleaning, doing laundry, whatever the case may be...I definately think we may have spoiled him by holding too much."<br>  <br>  Huh?|`|OHq5gSjJaa	Well he sounds like a really normal baby.  You might have just gotten lucky with the days when he would lay patiently in his crib.  Does he take naps during the day?  Why don't you try to get your chores done while he is sleeping?  And that way you can spend time and play with him while he is awake instead of doing housework.  Another idea is to carry him in a baby carrier while you get some work done.|`|IDS64Eh8aa	If he was, as you say, able to play by himself from day 1, how could you have spoiled him by holding him too much? I wore my daughter for the first 3 months of her life, co-slept too and she definitely isn't spoiled....Makes no sense|`|8t8NjjnVaa	You can't spoil a baby under a year old.  I was in the same position as you are, only my baby was like that from the very beginning.  I know it's hard to get stuff done, but you just need to get inventive!<br>  <br>  If I had to cook, I'd put the baby behind me or to the side of me (far from the oven of course) and dance and sing and interact with her as much as possible while I was cooking.  I also gave her measuring cups and cooking utensils to play with...something different than the usual toys.<br>  <br>  If I needed to vacuum, I'd do the same thing, interact with her a lot while I was doing it.  Push the vacuum right up to her chair so she can feel the vibration...make it a little "I'm gonna get you game".  <br>  <br>  Or you can try a carrier or a sling...that really helped when interacting with her wasn't enough!|`|fd34d7830f1987fa091fa8de50613944aa	Some of the other answerers are right. He is getting older and able to realize that there are more exciting things going on outside of the crib area. Ideally, he would really only be in there for sleeping/naps and when you need to quickly put him in a safe place for a minute or so. You have not spoiled him, most babies like to be held and he is used to the comfort of that. A Baby Bjorn is a great idea. We had one and would tote around our little one when he wanted to be held. He is 10 months now, we held him LOADS when he wanted it, and he is nowhere near "spoiled." He plays contently by himself at different times throughout the day. He will grow out of always wanting to be held, it just takes time and patience.
KCJ1X6efaa	Wow that's a big baby. My niece is 13 months and weighs 22 pounds. I thought she was big 4 her age. U got a NBA star right there.|`|pCxM717naa	My little girl weighed 20lb 11oz at one year, not sure about height. Although at 15mths she was 20lb 6oz and 29in.<br>  <br>  It doesnt mean anything really. Mine follows the 25th percentile curve while your little boy might be following the 90th percentile curve. Both equally healthy. If he was a good size at birth he would be likely to be on a higher growth curve. His weight and height are in perfect preportion, so although the 'average' one year old is 20lb and 30inches many babies reach this size by 4, 5 or 6mths and some not until 18 or 24mths.<br>  <br>  Congrats on a healthy happy little boy!x|`|K0AwEuhuaa	1st Child - 36 inches, 20lbs - At 1yr<br>  2nd Child - 35 Inches, 25lbs - At 1yr<br>  3rd Child -  29 Inches, 20lbs - He's 9 months right now.|`|1ezYfkX7aa	My kids at 6months were about 18pounds and not sure of the length i would have to dig out the baby books lol, but at a year old they were about 25-27lbs.|`|f4d85845a950087316840c62c9b31c06aa	My son was big like that, he was always in the 90th percentile in height and weight. My first girl was much smaller as most girls are. She was below average and my 2nd daughter was about average compared to other babies. I don't remember exactly their weights and heights as they are 8, 4, and 3 now but my 4 year old weighs 32 lbs now, which is amazing to me considering how tiny shes always been and my 3 year old only weighs 27 lbs which I also think is amazing since she eats everything. Maybe my kids have a fast metabolism. It usually gets faster once they start walking.
HpNmpH8Daa	I think that you should try out. Even if it's going to be your senior year, it would be nice to know if you were going to make it. If you make it and you like cheerleading, pursue the dream of becoming a professional cheerleader. Or if cheerleading doesn't capture your attention the way it used to, there's probably something else that's there , just waiting for you to see it. This is my opinion.

Keep your head up and remember it will get easier.|`|BGqnorAEaa	My daughter is one and she knows that when she is in her crib its night night time. Sometimes she will cry and throw a fit, but if she's ate and been changed and I know there is nothing wrong with her I just let her cry it out. I know that sounds mean but it doesn't hurt. Trust me I also have a 3 year old and anytime he cried when he was a newborn I was right there picking him up and now I fight trying to get him to lay down. But my little girl goes to sleep or just lays there in her bed when it's nap time. It will get better as long as you put him on a schedule and stick to it.

So I was having trouble with Biology and Geometry and I was seriously bombing every single Bio test. Like F's on every single one. But, I was so set on getting a good grade on the test I had this past Friday. So, I studied for like 10 minutes everyday for a week, just real quick, looked over my notes. And on the ngith before the test, I studied for an hour. And I got an A on the test! So, long story short, just study for a little bit each night. Take 10 minutes out of your day, and read over your notes. I know it can be really hard to make time. Like, I'm at track practice every single day until 5, so I basically go home, eat, and go to bed. But, do it while the kids you babysit are having dinner, watching TV, anything.  A B- isn't bad, but I can see why you want to raise it- everyone wants As haha But, seriously, I didn't think studying would work, but it does wonders!|`|ejelObdJaa	i think thats actually >really< good BUT you can try not goin to the youth group or work like only weekends or babysit a lil less.. so u have more time to study :)<br>  <br>  <br>  EDIT: 4.0 is excellent !  my sister had a 3.5 and she got a becca & now she doesn't have to pay ANYTHING. :)|`|bMZ7lOfVaa	You're being ridiculous. Those are great grades. There are people who have been accepted into colleges with worse grades (including me). Just because you have a B- doesn't mean you won't get accepted into a good college.|`|gP0gYbBaaa	i wish i was getting a B- in algebra 2<br>  in fact i wish i wa sgetting a D<br>  <br>  <br>  no ur good.<br>  <br>  keep up the good work!|`|sMuMfuAgaa	Really, geometry is a difficult thing to do.I'm in 9th grade and in acc geometry and I think I have like a C even though I try so unbelievably hard to do good in it. An you're grades are overall good. They equal up to a high 3. someting. Really, you don't need a 4.0 to get into college otherwise almost no one would be in college. Maybe, if you can, try and add more study time for geometry into each day. Don't put so much stress on yourself, mabye see if you can cut down on work in order to focus more on your studies.|`|lHlFxeaCaa	Step 1: Drop school, get out of it.<br>  Step 2: Make some links to drug dealers <br>  Step 3: Try a versatile amount of drugs<br>  Step 4: Start drug dealing<br>  Step 5: Get caught by the cops<br>  Step 6: Realize that your grades weren't bad and that you were having a retard moment<br>  Step 7: Make some chain links with the Palestinians<br>  Step 8: Gain an astronomical amount of Nukes<br>  Step 9: Declare yourself a terrorist<br>  Step 10: Make an independent country<br>  Step 11: Fight America<br>  Step 12: Bomb ever college in America<br>  Step 13: You've succeeded|`|abELhjcoaa	i guess you get what you get, maybe try to work out a schedule so that you can find time to study, or lessen the extracurriculars or get a tutor, and you can get into some pretty good colleges with b's because the rest of your grades are fine, but if you want to improve then you have to make time to do so.|`|6pEDLnrzaa	oh no, a b- whatever shall we do?!<br>  you'll be fine, i don't know study more. Take less shifts<br>  and if you have a b- no collage for you, HA!|`|4ZY1gfJyaa	those are great grades colleges would love to have you but ivy leagues are the only things you shuld worry bout|`|L8qpPXsdaa	Just because you have a B- in ONE subject, that doesn't mean a college won't accept you!|`|CEWIP3AHaa	Whoever told you that is LYING. You have a GPA of 3.8, that's AMAZING!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!... You're definitely going to go to college with that! Like majorly going! <br>  A few things I want to clear up:<br>  -Just because you don't go to college/university doesn't mean you are destined for some crappy job. You could be  A LOT of awesome things, like a fashion designer, interior designer, day-care owner, business owner (but it may be easier/you will have more knowledge if you go to business school, but you could manage without it)<br>  -If you are getting As in everything, except one subject, but you get good SAT/exam scores, college people won't really care<br>  -If you are going to college for something that involves geometry, you may have to pull it up to an A, but if you are going for something like psychology, or business, or whatever, colleges won't really care that you have a B- in Geom. because it isn't involved in the course!<br>  -Whoever told you that if you don't get 4.0 you're screwed is WRONG. My best friend's cousin is at HARVARD and her GPA was 3.8! Just like you :) And she got in on a partial scholarship!!!!! Getting 4.0 is incredibly hard, so schools know not to expect that from everyone. They realize you are human.<br>  <br>  Anyways, you might want to think about getting a tutor, if it is bothering you that much. Also, ask your geom. teacher if there is some project or extra homework you can do for extra credit. Talk to your teacher about why you are getting a low grade, and how you can fix it. <br>  You should also give up one of your activities. Instead of working 6 days/week, try working like 4 days/week. Yeah, giving up stuff sucks like hell, but sacrifices must be made.<br>  <br>  Good luck!

Any fish you eat must be cooked properly.  You also can't eat large amounts of the bigger fish like swordfish or shark due to the abnormal amounts of mercury in them.  If you're in doubt about your seafood choices, please talk to your doctor before eating it to be safe.<br>  <br>  Good luck with the pregnancy!|`|cd7a815aadd36875b0d7dabeed6e75bfaa	You can only eat them if they are heated through - cold seafood, even if already cooked and ready to eat, is a no-no.|`|3505983107c631451310c5009361ae76aa	there are certain types of seafood your not supposed to eat during pregnancy. best thing to do would be to ask your doctor|`|N1IqgXfvaa	No shell fish i thought.|`|zjH9MDYyaa	I don't know about seafood because of the mercury that's in it and I know for a fact you can't eat any raw seafood I'm not sure if it's cooked though Also if you have a cat you can't change the litter box because of all the bacteria or something|`|7Kz7uA2gaa	congratulation<br>  you should avoid sushi or any uncooked fish or meat.<br>  i dont know about cockles, but if it was sterilizes it should be ok;<br>  ask your midwife
qQv2cZ9zaa	I wasn't. And while there's nothing wrong with being pregnant now, I would warn you - when I was a month along with my daughter, morning sickness hit me HARD. There are a lot of women who feel fine the first time or second time, and then suddenly, they're sick with their next kid. I'd hold off until after the wedding because it would be awful to have your special day ruined by not feeling well! Better safe than sorry!<br>  <br>  Edit: I'm sorry people are being so judgemental and disrespectful toward you. I totally understand where you're coming from - you're an adult, you want a baby, you're getting married either way, and you're considering the timing. It's very unfair that rather than answering your question, they're acting like this. By the way, I read your profile, and it looks like 4/30 is a really special day for many reasons - congratulations and I hope it's wonderful!|`|6nn7f41Faa	I wasn't supposed to be. My doc said I had a less than 1% chance of conceiving and carrying on my own. I ended up being exactly 5 weeks pregnant on my wedding day.<br>  <br>  EDIT: It also wasn't a shotgun. We already had a 13 month old daughter on our wedding day and married 2 years to the day that we met. Our families tried to force us to marry when I was pregnant with our daughter, but we don't believe shotguns work very well. We wanted ours to work so we waited until we were ready.|`|ELivjd6Maa	i was pregnant when i got married. we got married june 23rd and i had my little girl august 22. so i was pretty big considering i was 7 months along. i say go for it and start trying if it happens that is great and no one will even have to know since you wont be showing if you dont want them to know. Good luck.|`|G3bETlH7aa	I was 6 months pregnant on my wedding day, and still had an incredible time.  Would not have changed it for anything.  Being it was my first child didn't show, but a dress one size bigger to take in consideration I was going to be pregnant and had to get it taken in.|`|3BnF5juxaa	i'm pregrant right now<br>  and my wedding day is in october and i am one month pregrant<br>  he wants date because i'll be huge but i don''t want to <br>  i want to get married in the snow<br>  like a winter wonderland|`|MW6WOTDIaa	i was going to get married, because i am pregnant, but my idiot boyfriend left.|`|bzQNHfunaa	i was 8 mos preg when i got married the 1st time....i looked like i was wearing a big white sheet. it was aweful!|`|hcH1AQ8faa	no,, I have morals! I also has balls.|`|cal9mFF2aa	i was 4 months along when we got married. Finding a dress was tough!|`|03ec65bf77c70de35e61bf195676e487aa	No, I waited until marriage to have sex so that my child would have parents who were committed by marriage.|`|dnG7fhnbaa	I SHOULD have been 4 months pregnant, but sadly lost the baby so I wasn't actually pregnant on my wedding day.<br>  <br>  Will be our anniversary April 25th and I'll be 28 weeks pregnant. :o)<br>  <br>  Good luck! xxx|`|8c4kRTnPaa	I was originally supposed to get married August 1st, but I'm due August 20th so we moved it to May 9th, and I'll be 6 months pregnant then|`|GGH0HVdvaa	Nope, I wasn't pregnant. No shotgun wedding for me!|`|d7a221dc65e9541431ba88edec210e7aaa	no but my mom was with me... she was 7 months i think...|`|GxgZAzpQaa	no
mhBQrnw8aa	Emergency Contraceptive you have up to 3 days from when insemination occured.|`|AA11785285	Nope.  Sorry.  Plan B is likely not available there.... <br>  <br>  Get her back to the state for an abortion if being a daddy isn't in your immediate plans... but it is still her body, her business if she wants to keep the pregnancy.  Then you, hon, are on the hook for 18 years of support.<br>  <br>  It is said that a man doesn't have enough blood in his body to run his big head and his little one at the same time.  Hmmmm... Why wasn't she on bc pills???|`|gN7HT4gDaa	umm, nothing you can do pal. just pray and hope the baby is healthy :)|`|oWAUb6vpaa	Nothing. I guess you can always try Casteroil - supposedy works.** <br>  <br>  Good luck..|`|ISljRZIRaa	if she doesn't get her period around the time she should then get to the U.S and get an abortion if you don't wanna be a Daddy!|`|fIDWcViHaa	She should probably go see a doctor.|`|zWB3jHHPaa	lol that blows!!|`|EYZKexFVaa	Well, nothing I can say can help you right now.<br>  Should she be pregnant, this is both of your faults. <br>  The only thing you can do is HOPE TO GOD you don't reproduce.<br>  But, in the end, its her choice what she wants to do.|`|AA11258834	ask her to take two pills  and see if she ll have her own period in 4 days or 5.If nothing happened then take her a doctor.|`|ak0T96CQaa	Falcon Punch her in the stomach. SURPRISE ABORTION|`|856df45cd220b8db7117dd899c6e5ae2aa	Nope.  Day after pill is the only thing she can use now.  It's too late for anything else.  Just pray....lol.

sXVkRGJIaa	Ya babies learn to sit up by themselves. If you just lie him on his back and lift him up by his arms in a sitting position and praise him then that should help.<br>  Teething rings and things like that are only good to ease the pain of teething really, theres nothing to make the teeth come out any quicker. Some babies develop them faster that others thats all.<br>  P.s. I heard them things where you place the baby under a pole with toys on it encourage the baby to sit up and play with the toy so that might work!?|`|3CVfUiiJaa	He will learn to sit up when he's ready to...but you can sit behind him and let him practice sitting up.   As for the teething, that will happen when it does.  There isn't anything you can to do force a tooth to come through.  Just keep doing what you are doing.  But, what are wagon wheels?  I am thinking about the old chocolate snacks I used to eat as a child.  I wouldn't use those if that is what you are talking about.
AA10280194	We thought my cat was pregnant once and so did she!  She would nest and lay in "special" places.  We didn't feel any babies either and started to worry when she didn't have any kittens but just kept getting bigger.  I took her to the vet and what it actually was was an infected uterus!!  Her entire uterus was filled with infection and that's what was making her look, and I guess to her, feel pregnant.  That did immediate surgery to remove the uterus.  The vet said that he had never seen an infection to that extent and even took pictures of it to send off to a vet medical journal.  I go have her checked out ASAP!<br>  <br>  Hope this helps :-) <br>  <br>  PS - she was perfectly fine after the surgery but I think she was a little depressed because she couldn't find her babies.|`|6ITgXvBWaa	Cats are only pregnant for 4 weeks.. so she would have giving birth already.|`|XdvMxyg9aa	My cat is also pregnant i know because her sides are big and she is eating more and more, at first I didn't feel any babies either but then I did. I am sure that if you wait then you will feel them. Good luck on your kittens!|`|P03VfBFAaa	she's probably gaining weight b/c cats only have a gestational periods of 3 months so if she was pregnant she should already have a litter  and another on the way take her to vet to be sure b/c it can be a tumor or something
obN6p3Cgaa	when is your time nothing you do will stop it so just continue to make the best love you can your day will come Good Luck*****|`|DN6XtoViaa	your chances of concieving go up just a tiny bit if you do the "lay in bed with your butt on top of a pillow" thing... but i don't think it makes a real differents.<br>  <br>  i heard peeing after sex will wash the sperm out... but where we pee from is compleatly different from where the sperm would be.. so i wouldn't think it would make any diff. :)<br>  <br>  the sperm that will make it up to the egg will have already been in the uterus waaay before we stand back up (after sex)<br>  <br>  BUT if you want to help those little swimmers make their way easier then lay down on your back with your butt on a pillow... for about 20-30mins.<br>  <br>  good luck :)|`|1xsUVtzBaa	Do raise you hips with a pillow and stay for at least 10 mins. Dont shower or pee for as long as you can. Do relax and enjoy and take the time to get "turned on" as the mucus you produce then can help hold the sperm while it lays in wait. And don't take a bath or spa.|`|gtGDr73Taa	keep u pillo under your nipples and do not move for 10-15min <br>  do not wash u nipples for one day <br>  do not pour urine upto 30min after sex
DN6XtoViaa	if you didn't have any kind of period flow and only had spotting then i wouldn't consider it a period. <br>  <br>  it could be implantation! and if it is, then you won't get a positive for at least 3-6 days after implantation.<br>  <br>  wait a few days.. maybe even a week and then test again :)<br>  <br>  good luck!|`|3foSwZpWaa	I'd say it was your period, even if you haven't had one like that before. <br>  Implantation usually only is a one-time thing, not days worth, even if it was light. <br>  With that said, implantation occurs around 7dpo, so if it WAS implantation by chance, I'd say you tested a little too early. Try one more time now if you want.
qhjti2j7aa	we are in similar situations.  My last period was feb 19 and I also had unprotected sex on march 1st and 2nd.  A total of about 4 times.  I am not due for my period around st patricks day also.  <br>  <br>  I think its all metal.  We are so worried and stressed out about it that our bodies start to have pregnancy symptoms.  <br>  <br>  All we have to do now is pray LOL and wait to take a pregnancy test<br>  <br>  Good luc|`|RupgeGLcaa	hi! i would give it a couple more days. before i found out i was pregnant i had really sore breasts, peeing alot, had really bad menstural-like cramps, and just tired. a couple of days later i took a test and came out positive! Just rememeber the pre-ejaculate has sperm, so even if he pulls out, there always is that chance : ) good luck sweetie|`|bzQNHfunaa	if uve had unpro sex then maybe otherwise id say u most likely have a uti thats getting severe. u might try getting in to see a dr!
oUcLSDZ6aa	Diapers = $1200<br>  Formula (should you choose to go that way) = $1200<br>  Clothes, I spent about $3000 in the the first year. <br>  Furniture and large baby toys (swing, bouncer), about $2000<br>  Food, add about $250 a month to your existing grocery bill.<br>  Transportation varies from person to person. But a good car seat will cost between $100 and $200<br>  Stroller, $200<br>  Don't even want to think about what I've spent on toys.<br>  Rent, about $12000 for the year.<br>  $1000 on medical necessities (baby tylenol, orajel, bum cream etc...)<br>  $500 for laundry.<br>  <br>  The first few months are the most expensive. Especially if you don't have a health plan, or insurance. <br>  <br>  Then there are also outings, and other miscellaneous things I'm sure I'm forgetting. Our family is just barely getting by on a little under 40k a year. We don't have a car. We don't "date", we never go out. We are strictly parents 100% of the time. <br>  <br>  Also keep in mind, that children get more expensive with every year that goes by. And that things break.|`|KtBusSeXaa	I wish I could get 50k for a year.  I only get about 43k a year and I have to work my *** off for it.  But anyhow I have three babies and we live just fine on 43k|`|7kX5yTooaa	People have supported babies on far, far less.<br>  <br>  Do you have health insurance?  Most plans charge a flat rate for all prenatal visits and delivery.  Otherwise this will be out-of-pocket.  Depending on where you have the baby and the interventions you choose, you can look at several thousands in the delivery alone.  Midwives and/or birth centers charge anywhere from $4,000+ and physicians may charge more for non-medicated, non-intervention births.  This doesn't cover baby care if something is wrong with him/her, either, or any of the testing, vaccinations, and other new baby fun.<br>  <br>  Are you going to be nursing or formula-feeding your baby?  Nursing is free, although you may need lanolin, nursing pads, and some accessories (bottles if you eventually plan to pump, for example).  It does not cost anywhere near the cost of formula-feeding, but you should factor in a couple hundred.<br>  <br>  Are you using cloth or disposable diapers?  Cloth diapers can save you thousands of dollars in the long run.  Think $500.00 initial investment instead of $3,000.00 for the duration of potty-training.<br>  <br>  Clothing and furniture are not as big a deal.  You can buy secondhand clothes at any number of baby stores (plus people give you a ton - check on Craigslist) and you really don't need the furniture you are encouraged to buy.  You don't need a crib (just a secluded area or bedshare with mom and dad), a changing table (use the floor, the couch, the bed), and all that nonsense.<br>  <br>  The same goes for toys.  Bouncy things, swings, sit-n-spins, none of those are necessary.<br>  <br>  If you're nursing, you need about 300 more calories a day (the equivalent of a candy bar, though you'll probably want to eat something healthier), so your grocery bill won't increase much till baby starts eating solids.  Then it's really only mushed bananas and things like that, which can be done yourself and without the need for baby food.<br>  <br>  You absolutely have to have a car seat if you own a car or plan to transport your baby in one.<br>  <br>  This all assumes you have a place to live, utilities, groceries, transportation, and entertainment covered.<br>  <br>  $50,000.00 is plenty to last you a year, but please plan to have something going on after that year is up!  You never know what emergencies will come up or what your baby may need on its way here.<br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|Nm4SH4U7aa	It's your choice.  If you need to save money, look for good quality second-hand equipment or clothing.  There's a lot of baby stuff for sale that you don't actually need.<br>  <br>  Essentials:<br>  Cot (worth looking for second hand)<br>  Car Seat (buy new and look for something that will last through different growth stages)<br>  Stroller (I'd probably buy new, it can get a lot of use if you plan to do any walking)<br>  Diapers<br>  Clothing - you'll probably get given a lot as gifts; hand me downs are great & sometimes second-hand can be really good quality.  Once your baby has messed in clothes a few ties you really won't care about dressing them in hand-me-downs.<br>  Toys - you'll probably get given a lot as gifts.<br>  <br>  Apart from this, biggest costs are either your loss of income, or cost of childcare once you return to work.  Food costs aren't that high in the first year unless you use formula (they don't start on solids until around 6 months).
QoVL5cDHaa	You shouldn't get Braxton Hicks yet. That is more towards the end of the pregnancy, perhaps say a couple of weeks before due date. Even then, not everyone gets it. With twins, you may well deliver early, so be prepared!<br>  As far as your Dad is concerned, confide in your midwife, and if you have met her yet, your Health Visitor. My daughter had a baby last summer, and her partner was very abusive. Although there was no physical violence, the threat was there, and he was constantly shouting at and bullying her. Apparently pregnancy and just after birth are the trigger times for physical violence, so you need to get away. Our midwife got us registered with the police domestic violence unit, and contact for Women's Aid, also the number for the local shelter. The Health Visitor threatened to call in Social Services if my son-in-law wasn't sent on his way.<br>  Your healthcare workers could help you by arranging for you to go elsewhere. At 15 you can't cope by yourself, but you must put those babies first. It may mean Social Services being called in, but in a situation like yours, they do all they can to keep Mum and babies together. Your Dad has threatened you. They can get you out of his way, so that he can't get at you. As the pregnancy progresses, you will get more and more vulnerable. They can also advise what benefits are available, although at 15, I think you may have to be found a foster parent who can help you through the difficult weeks ahead.|`|UYfqzCoMaa	First question I started getting braxton hicks about 35 weeks. Second, you need to go to the police. Once you do they will help you and not let anything happen to you or your babies. Then you need to get a restraining order against him so he can't come anywhere near you or you girls when they are born. Fight for them, if you feel like you can't fight for yourself. Do it for them!|`|iADIEEI8aa	hey there, right first thing i didnt get any braxton hicks so i cant answer that and the second is, if you went to the police then your dad couldnt hurt u any more, i really feel for u and you twn babies, you should get out of there, you'l get put up have to in some sort of a hostel and they will really help you, no one should have to put upwith any form of abuse, im here if u ever need to chat x|`|433165e2c7b432dcd07898d64f6f19c8aa	Braxton hicks aren't something every woman experiences. You may get them later on in your pregnancy or you may not get them at all. It's nothing to worry about. <br>  Your father is another story. You have to go to the police because what he's doing is abuse and has to be stopped. If its only for the sake of your daughters, seek help and tell the police. They'll move you to a place of safety because of the risk he poses to you and your children. Your father needs to be stopped so please dont put up with it one moment longer.|`|98WKYtfwaa	1. Not everybody experiences braxton hicks, you can get them at any point in the pregnancy, most people experience them from about 25weeks onwards though.<br>  <br>  2. If your dad hits you, don't you think you should get out of there, if not for you for the sake of your babies? Go to the police, tell them what's going on and they'll help you get accomodated else where before they speak to him about it. <br>  <br>  In the UK you have alot of help.|`|CpiLHcTlaa	1) i never got them. <br>  <br>  2) go to the police show them the bruises. He only threatens because if you go to them he'll be taken away and he knows then he can;t touch you. you'll be relocated somewhere that's safe for you and your little girls. please don't risk bringing your daughters into that. leave before he can hurt them. the police will help you and they will arrest him right away and get you to a safe place where he won't find you. i had a friend with that problem (no babies but got beaten) and we lived in a small town so they sent her to the next city over to keep her safe.|`|Fzd4484paa	Hi, <br>  <br>  you have to go to the police or seek for help from a family member you can trust! Your dad cannot do anything to you if you go to the police and report what he is doing to you and how he threatened you not to tell anyone what he  is doing to you! What about your mom? Can she help you?|`|KtBusSeXaa	First question, I had braxton hicks toward the end of my pregnancy around 36-39 weeks.<br>  Second: Go to the police, your father can't do anything to you once you are in there protective custody.  If you have bruises and such to prove it he will be in jail  before you know it.  You have to do what is best for your babies.  Good Luck!
TJusfEnlaa	That sounds alot to me like teething - is she drooling alot? my nephew got his first teeth at 4 months - so it is definately possible. It could still take a few more weeks, even months for the teeth to break through. My son was born with the white caps visible but they didn't erupt til he was 6months. <br>  Good luck!!|`|w3ob12X6aa	yeah she probably is, my daughter is 3 months as well, and im going through that right now..my daughter is usually always playing giggling and this last week she has been crying and crying and i have done everything to try to calm her and nothing works, she has been trying to bite her hand off and drooling soo much, but what i have been doing is giving her tylenol too and i got a washcloth and wet it a little and let her chew on it, it seemed to soothe her gums and she loved it so you could try that, good luck
8t8NjjnVaa	The absolute best car seat is one that fits securely in your car.  Yes, some have better safety ratings (Britax ones usually score high), but if you can't get it in your car really tight, then it's not safe.<br>  <br>  The best thing for you to do is to choose one, read the instructions very thoroughly, then try to install it in your car.  Put it in the middle of the backseat because that's the safest...he's got space on both sides in case of a side-impact accident.  <br>  <br>  Once it's in, try to move the car seat side to side and forward.  If you can move it more than 1/4 of an inch (it's best if you can't move it at all), it's not tight enough.  Try again.  If you just can't get it in tight enough, return the car seat and try a different one.  One with great safety ratings won't do your child a bit of good unless it fits tightly in your car.|`|OLW0Irbhaa	Britax all the way!  The have strictly infant seats or you can get one that goes from 5-65lbs.|`|S3qmkm2Vaa	you are initially looking for a good rear-facing INFANT car seat. they usually go up to 25lbs. I would suggest one that has a base that you leave permanently in  the car and the seat attaches to.This is both safe and convenient. The brand Graco consistently gets top marks from both experts and consumers. Good luck and congratulations!<br>  <br>  "All infants should always ride rear-facing until they are at least 1 year of age and weigh at least 20 pounds.<br>   The seat clicks into and out of the base so you don’t have to install the base each time you use it. Parents can buy more than one base for additional vehicles."|`|23601a2348cb3f972406062ffa7f9839aa	don't buy anything Evenflo. I recommend an actual infant seat with the detachable base. It makes getting baby in and out of the car so much nicer as you don't have to worry about bumping heads or stretching to buckle and all that. Also don't buy a used carseat you never know what they had done to them before you. I have heard good things about Britax although I have never used them. They are way out of my budget range. Right now my son is in a Cosco convertible seat. Look for reviews. Read them all and then decide. You also may be able to "test drive" some models from the stores if you as to check the fit in the car itself. Good luck with your baby.|`|JvM44Bx5aa	I would suggest Graco Nautilus 3-in-1 Car Seat in Matrix.  <br>  <br>  It is the only forward-facing car seat your child will need. It helps keep him safe in a 5-point harness longer than most car seats, all the way up to 65 lbs.<br>  <br>  You may see more details of this car seat or other interesting ones at the following online store:<br>  <br>  <a href="http://astore.amazon.com/healthy-care-booster-seat-20" rel="nofollow">http://astore.amazon.com/healthy-care-bo...</a><br>  <br>  Some useful information regarding "Booster Seats Protect Children" is provided in my blog here below :<br>  <br>  <a href="http://babyandtoys.blog.com" rel="nofollow">http://babyandtoys.blog.com</a><br>  <br>  Good luck and congratulation for your new baby.
Ka52nbhNaa	Many years ago, being a godparent used to go along with taking custody of the child in the event that something was to happen to the parents . . . therefore you would need to be 18 or older.<br>  <br>  Now it is more symbolic - an honor to be the godparent, that you will help support the child and be involved in their spiritual development therefore there is not an age requirement in this area.<br>  <br>  The parents will set up other guardians if it becomes necessary.<br>  <br>  Best wishes!|`|1hciyvKdaa	Well for fun you can be any age. If God forbid something happens to the parents, you are not old enough and would not be considered for gaurdianship of the child. Her parents are correct for what they are saying. I never had a god parent for any of my kids. If something happend to me, whoever was in the right place, and had the desire and financial means to support my kids would of been the ones to take care of them. Its about being able to take care of them, financially, mentally, and at the right place and time in life. When you turn 18 still it doesnt mean you have the money to feed them right? So for fun she can name you, but if she wants to tell someone you will be the one to raise my children, she needs someone that is already able too. Someone older, married and loves kids too.|`|SCY0bOr5aa	My Niece is 18 she is the GodMother to my 12 month old Son. I don't think there is any age restriction.|`|LhvKTYftaa	In the Catholic cjurch you have to be over 16.  We found this out when we baptised my son, and my BFF cannot use the girl she wanted since she is only 15.<br>  <br>  You are fine!|`|lD0VcAlpaa	There is no age restriction, it's a personal decision.|`|KCJ1X6efaa	Any age is fine. Age is just a number. My son's Godmother is 18 years old. She loves my son and thats all that matters.|`|EJMwqU3caa	I think that you should have been through confirmation, and know what it means to be a Godmother.  Your age doesn't neccessarily matter as long as you know and understand what you are committing yourself to for this child.<br>  <br>  Good Luck!
kVBDpAMTaa	I had kind of the same problem but I have hypothyroidism and levels were off. They will just change your medication to a higher dose, or lower dose depending on what is needed. Make sure to get your tsh test every month now. It is very important.|`|TohAUyjjaa	I am sorry to say this but my grandma had werid thyriod levels when she was pregnant and she lost three babies. She didn't have problems when she wasn't pregnant through. She also had three babies too. So yes I can effect your baby. I am not trying to worry you because you may have a heathly baby. Go talk to your doctor and make sure. I would hate to see you lose your baby with no warning. good luck and i hope everything goes ok.|`|znW4b0Mfaa	I have hypothyroidism,you need to get your meds adjusted.<br>  I am also 8 weeks pregnmant,and my meds have had to be adjusted once already.It is extremely important that you have your doc closely monitor your thyroid and are adjusted as needed.<br>  I miscarried in 2007 due to my thyroid being so "off".<br>  Good luck to you.
CmxJdPh2aa	i've read that often times the most common reason to bring a baby in to the doctor is ear tugging and, contrary to popular belief, it is not the most common symptom of an ear infection. often it is just a habit, or curiosity. but if she is showing other symptoms or feels warm, of course take her to be seen just in case. after 6 months though usually they try not to give antibiotics right away because it can usually go away on its own after a few days and using antibiotics when not necessary causes resistance in the future sometimes.|`|lbmFP6ayaa	maybe she doe it to comfort herself ..like when kids roll their hair or when they want to get their backs patted b4 they fall asleep awww|`|UYfqzCoMaa	My son does that all the time. He has since he was a baby. He is now two years old and now he just does it when he is extremely sleepy. As long as she is not screaming in pain and pulling on her ears I wouldn't worry about it.|`|S3qmkm2Vaa	I don't know your specific circumstance, but are there other symptoms of an ear infection?<br>  it can be out of itchiness, habit, comfort...there are many reasons for why she could be doing this. <br>  the thing to look at is: does she have a fever? does she show signs of pain or discomfort? is she feeding fine or are her sleeping patterns disrupted? these are better signs in determining an ear infection.<br>  Most ear infections hurt, so your best indicator is Evidence of Pain!<br>  if your baby is otherwise fine, it could just be a comforting habit. <br>  Read the article from the link I posted, it really helps. :)|`|ImDoKKdRaa	My nephew did that and he had a bad ear ache he does it when your son does it too i suggest you take him to the doctors because the sooner the better don't let him suffer ps:my nephew was 8 months too|`|0d8fd99482e78511337c03d547560306aa	My little one is almost 8 months and she is pulling at her ears because her bottom two teeth are breaking through.

FiUprYsvaa	That's actually awesome!<br>  20 pounds is a lot. <br>  <br>  Keep going and keep playing soccer. It is an amazing sport.<br>  <br>  Remember, you are gaining muscles as well and muscles weighs more than fat but muscles are good because its what gives you that lean fit look.|`|T3OGT4Ntaa	That's good!  It was smart to lose weight by exercising and not dieting (which can often be very unhealthy).  The thing about exercise is that your body adjusts to it, so try doing different things.  Maybe run a a couple miles, 2-3 days a week, swim, cycle, etc.  Don't worry about the amount of weight as much as the quality of your health!  Keep up the good work.|`|lTUXdbCTaa	That's awesome! You should be super proud of yourself :)<br>  Just keep trying if you want to lose more, but don't beat yourself up for losing less than you wanted to.|`|CdJtH0xdaa	That's really good. Twenty pounds in 5 months?? That's four pounds per month. You should be very proud of yourself. Keep up the good work. =)|`|UIILEn0Uaa	That is ah-mazing!<br>  There is nothing wrong with just loosing 20lbs!  Thats great, and ur doing it the healthy way. (:|`|AEfIgkHEaa	thats about how much i lost by going to the gym and dieting, since september.. about 23-25 to be exact... but that's a good tihng you should be proud. At my gym the trainers said a healthy and reallistic goal is 10 lbs per 3 months..sounds like it isn't enough but the more slowly you lose the slower it would be to gain it back! especially if you're close to your normal weight, it's harder. If you were obese, or mobidly obese you'd lose weight faster in the begining..<br>  <br>  when i was very heavy i lost like 30 lbs in a month or so, now i am happy if i lose 5 in a month.|`|7nOkNtw4aa	I think 20lbs in 5 months is Absolutely amazing since you were just playing on a soccer team.<br>  If you still feel bad about your weight maybe you and your friends can go for jogs every weekend. Or when you go out any where, walk instead if it's a short distance.<br>  <br>  You should be really proud of yourself for losing 20 pounds.<br>  <br>  Good Job and Good Luck.|`|HOdblqIkaa	You probably lost water weight 1st and then began to lose fat, but were replacing that weight loss with muscle weight and muscle weighs more than fat. You have lost fat weight and water weight which is good and replaced some of it with muscle which is better. It doesn't matter how much weight you lose but how you are losing it. If you were to stop eating you would eventually gain weight back after the initial weight loss so that's bad, the way you are going about it is healthy. Be happy you are losing some and be happier you are getting into great shape.
9q2RmVHRaa	I have a nine month old baby boy and it sounds like your little one is teething.  His routine was interupted.  It was like he had a bad cold, diahrea due to the mucus that he swallowed...obviously can't blow his own nose.  He had a slight fever and putting everything in his mouth.  He also went off of his bottle a few times.  Teething is exhausting for a baby so taking more naps isn't unusual.|`|sgua3lH6aa	Your baby will continue to suddenly change her schedule many times throughout her baby/toddlerhood.  It is all normal and natural.  Just go with the flow and adjust.<br>  <br>  By the way, my babies didn't "sleep through the night" until they were 3 years old!  So don't feel bad if other people lie about their babies' perfect sleep habits.|`|TVx4iWlGaa	Babies tend to sleep more when theyre going through a growth spurt. My first daughter always did (my second one is only a month). But there was one time when she started sleeping more often and longer and I thought it was from a growth spurt but it turned out to be a natural gas leak... (Carbon monoxide detectors dont detect this).|`|n6XYYyoLaa	probably just bc she hasn't felt well; if ur concerned, call your doc; that's what they are there for..|`|az0KD0POaa	Count your blessings. You have a good baby!
sYsfI856aa	I've been having BH for over a week now. Went to the doctor since I am already 1cm dilated to be sure they weren't doing any harm. They feel like your stomach completely tightens up, then lets go and softens again. The cramping you are feeling sounds more like round ligament pain. Just more stretching and normal cramping. If you have any bleeding or severe pain or lower back pain with them I would call your care provider.<br>  <br>  To see if the BH are the real thing, I would told that when I feel them to lay down with a glass of water for an hour, sipping on the water and if they are 5 min apart and increase in intensity then to go in, if they are not consistent and don't get worse then nothing to worry about.|`|y5sWmbtnaa	It could be BH Contractions. I had them starting around that time. The crampiness could be due to the fact you may need more water in your system.. Try that before getting nervous about anything.|`|mqHL4UcRaa	Braxton hicks feels like a tight little squeeze in the abdomen. It's almost like having a cramp in your calf (it tightens up then releases) only its in your abdomen. They are not painful, just uncomfortable. I noticed mine at around 26 weeks also. Now that you have recognized it, you will notice them more often. I notice mine when I get up real quick or change positions, and almost always when I have to pee real bad. They are involuntary and random.|`|a7c44ca57676a0db1e3d8ad650499612aa	It very well could be hicks or the baby moving. As you approach the end the baby starts to run out of room and it starts hurting more and making you cramp. I would try doing stretches, walk, stay pretty active do lots of stretches and when its happening lay on your left side and just relax. Always your left side it keeps the blood flowing and your not laying on any nerves that could cause you discomfort. Drink lots of water. If you get dehydrated that could cause cramping that is actually a VERY common cause of hick ands cramps.|`|AEXJcpmHaa	could be, braxton hicks are good they prepare your body for labor....walking or changing positions can stop them...thats when you know they are braxton rather than true labor contractions....real contractions strenghten with walking etc......braxton hicks are nothing compared to labor contactions so get used to them quickly! congratulations and good luck with your little baby!!!!|`|hmcQJnTraa	if your feeling ur tummy tighen up then yup there bh|`|JzycBd4saa	Yeah braxton hicks sometimes the pain (uncomfterable) feeling come as if it were suppost to be contractions. but it isn't if it is 3-5 min and starts to get worse and it lasts for 40 min then it is real and you need to get to the hospital drink lots and lots of water is wat the doctors told me before! GOOD LUCK!|`|TVx4iWlGaa	It doesnt sound like braxton hicks it just sounds like regular pregnancy cramping. Braxton hicks feel like a tightening in the uterus.|`|sIr2fWh6aa	Sounds like BH since there's no regularity to them.  There's no way to prevent them, either.  It's your body's way of gearing up and practicing for real labor.|`|zRQmWC5saa	sounds like it.
ki5hZbcTaa	no its not true. When you have a baby and you're not married, the father has to sign an affadavit of paternity which states that he acknowledges the fact that he is the father and then signs the birth certificate.|`|NOjcTeT4aa	No it's not true. <br>  <br>   You can put any last name you want and any man off the street can sign and say he's the father. However you cannot put a man down as the father, he has to do do himself, at least where i live.|`|ZOgcqaEIaa	If you are not married then yes.  It's to prevent the father from denying the child later, and saying you just threw the name on there, if something happens between you two, and you want child support.|`|t4HXotwEaa	It depends on the state.  But, most states only require a notarized paternity affidavit from both parents.<br>  <br>  here is your state:<a href="http://www.ors.state.ut.us/faq_paternity.htm#Q3" rel="nofollow">http://www.ors.state.ut.us/faq_paternity...</a>|`|5ItOGyVHaa	ok.. i know in TX and CA and i am guessing every where else. <br>  <br>  you can put down anyone as the dad. however the dad doesn't have to sign it if he doesn't want to. <br>  <br>  in TX they tried to pressure my husband into a DNA test because we weren't married yet. in CA they just said "here sign this"|`|sIr2fWh6aa	You don't have to have a paternity test, but the father does have to sign an acknowledgement of paternity (which you'll sign to stating you agree)...|`|EmhBDHMtaa	uh never heard of that...|`|01Mu3wUeaa	No, that is not true.<br>  <br>  You can put the father's name on the birth certificate and he can sign it without taking a paternity test.<br>  <br>  (Note: if you put his name but he doesn't sign it, he is not recognized as the father...even then, if you are unmarried and pending on your state's rules, you will have to go to court in order for father to have rights.Paternity test more than likely is requested then)|`|syrh8J6Vaa	No its not true.  The dad must be present and sign a paper saying he is the father of the child.  Then he signs the birth certificate.
qHwI9ev8aa	Kids are expensive, no matter what age you have them at. I had my first when I was on a post-doc salary and my husband was in school. We had to pay for daycare and diapers and all those things that babies need (clothes, furniture, baby transport) and it was very stressful. You can avoid unnecessary expenses (exersaucers are NOT worth the money) and buy some things second hand. If you have any friends or relatives who have unneeded baby stuff borrow it!<br>  <br>  You also seem to be avoiding the worst cost which is daycare. Good for you. I think it's really important for children to have time with their parents, even if it is a sacrifice. <br>  <br>  If the state of the economy is any indication, many people can't afford their kids (not to mention lots of other stuff) they just live beyond their means and worry about it when a creditor calls. You are doing a good thing to be considering your finances now, staying on top of your money will serve you well your whole life.|`|sVn0Sy7taa	hey i dont think anyone should take this question in a bad way, its just life & what happens!!!<br>  <br>  personally im 21 my first boy is 15 months old & we're due to have our second son ANYTIME now! <br>  both my partner and i have ALWAYS worked hard for everything we own, even before we decided we wanted to be parents but the thought of being parents actually made us work harder.. i dont work now and i wont be going bak to work until my second child is at least 1! .  we dont struggle AT ALL, we are very financial & happy - my partner had nearly finished his apprent when i had my little boy so now he is making a very good wage, i managed 2 family businesses doing around 50-60hours a week for 2 years when i knew i wanted to be a mum, i knew i had to be getting somewhere before i bought a child into the world.... so we worked very hard, we are completely debt free, own everything we have (new cars, furniture etc)  APART from the home loan we just took out to build our first dream home :). <br>  so no we dont struggle at all & cope extremely well, only because we planned a head & had everything ready when our first boy arrived... i see a lot of friends who had their kids young (planned) but they didnt have an education or job to back them up, so now they are struggling to support their children who are nearly at school age! its sad, but being a parent isnt optional when u already have kids & they just have to work harder now!! <br>  <br>  sounds like ur trying your hardest to give your child whats needed, so dont feel terrible about asking this question..xx|`|bwKZ8MWWaa	it's all priorities|`|sAhAEC2qaa	i am a stay at home mom. my partner pays for everything for my son. i am on wic for a few groceries and formula.|`|dwhClJ1Haa	with a job.|`|MeYILJeSaa	My husband supports us. He's working hard and going to school. At the moment, I'm able to stay home with my son which has been amazing. I'm trying to find a part time job on the weekends so my husband can be with him when I have to work. I'm paranoid about sending him to a daycare.<br>  Most of our money just goes to bills, groceries, gas, and diapers. (I breastfeed) We hardly ever go out. We also have family to help us out and they've been amazing. Both of our families are well-off, so I feel blessed that they're able to help us. They even give us money every once in a while so we can have a pizza date. :)<br>  <br>  Edit: The plan is when my husband graduates from college, he'll be able to pay for me to go back and get my education too.|`|ZCSOJUYVaa	Well I wouldnt exactly classify myself as a young mommy (27) But my husband and I do have 6 kids all under 8. We are for the most part finacially stable, but I can remember those times when we struggled on one part time salary while we were both in school and raising a baby. Its by no means fun! I as well know people that have several kids already and are only in their early twenties. I say if you are old enough to have sex, old enough to have a baby, than you are old enough to take responsibility and not rely off of your parents or the government. But thats just personal opinion. There are some mommies that have 3 kiddos, are  23 years old, and are super mom with a full time job, I commend them for being able to do that!!|`|wYiaokysaa	Ideally, you would have gone as far in school as you could and gotten a good job before you had kids, but it happens that a lot of people are not prepared for parent hood.

I'm learning to cut back, and this has been easier ever since my boyfriend moved in as he has been amaze helpful with budget and all. We both work and Ana's preschool is public so we just pay $50 per month for materials instead of the thousands for the private schools around here. I am getting two salaries for my job at the local figure skating rink and as I am 20 I still qualify for some paying figure skate competitions. Since I work at the rink Ana's lessons are much more inexpensive then normal, so holding down two jobs has been a plus for me. I am a real estate agent and occasionally I do have to sacrifice time from Ana but as she gets older it is in turn getting easier. My daughter is on the way and I will get two months off work..my boyfriend and I are still discussing possibilities.|`|uCLenopbaa	well i don't work.. i live with my dad and stay at home with my son. i also get WIC and my boyfriend pays for everything else.. our familys dont pay for anything. we were able to get some hand-me-down clothes for our son, from friends.<br>  <br>  in a few months i am hoping to either go back to school or get a job (preferably go back to school, i haven't even graduated) although i am scared that my son will need to be in day care.|`|UseJjREjaa	Where I live is actually not an expensive place to live.. Southern Ohio...<br>  <br>  <br>  My husband supports us.. While I am still doing highschool.  He makes more money than anyone else we know.  We don't get any assistance except WIC and we only qualify because we had twins. <br>  <br>  I have 3 sons.. and I just turned 18 on the 4th.  My husband is 19.  We're still in highschool doing great actually.<br>  <br>  You have to sacrifise things.. Like we settled for this smaller house because his mom sold it to us for cheaper.  Instead of buying the 15,000 car we traveled a little further for the 9,000 one.  I mean we gotta cut down and get the basics.  We don't live a lavished life.  As long as my kids are fed, clothed and comfortable I don't need a thing.  But we do still afford some luxuries.  Everyone needs to.<br>  <br>  But there isn't much you can say to "how do you afford kids"  really no one but the rich can.  You know that old saying "if you wait til you can afford kids, you'll NEVER have them"<br>  Kids are just something that adults crave for.  They are part of life.  You have them and do whatever you can to take care of them.  I don't think that people living off a LITTLE BIT of welfare (as long as they are trying to work) should be deprived from having children<br>  <br>  I plan on staying at home with my kids (were homeschooled) until they are in preschool and kindergarten then going to college.. getting a job.. then I plan on supporting the family while my husband goes to college and then we can both work after he is done.  We're tryin to do the best for our family and only have our children in mind.

45xNJ7Ncaa	I got pregnant while nursing.  The biggest difficulty is that prolactin (which makes breast milk) decreases lh which you need to mature an egg and cause ovulation.  You don't have to wean or stop nursing.  <br>  <br>  You do have to reduce though.   They recomend only nursing 4 times or less a day and to not nursing for more than 10 minute  each time (total of 40 mins per day or less).  Minimize any stimulation beyond that to keep you prolactin low.  Woman in Europe commonly nurse while they are pregnant.  You will lose your milk around the 4-5 month of pregnancy due to pregnancy hormones.<br>  <br>  Be sure to take vitamins and get plenty of calories to fully support your bodies needs and the demands of nursing.<br>  <br>  I would ask your gyn for Provera to start your cycles.  You need to get your estrogen levels up which work with fsh (which causes an egg to grow).|`|6Z4fKZ8aaa	My sister-in-law got pregnant shortly after giving birth to her first son while breastfeeding.

EtCRnDJMaa	they color everywhere in the house & even outside & in the vehicle.  They love to color in the living room, on the floor or on the couch,while watching TV.  In my bedroom on my bed or on the floor.  At the kitchen table or on the floor.  They probably would even color in the bathtub if they could!  One thing I do not let them do is take the markers around the house.  They have to stay at the kitchen table to use markers & that's if I even let them use markers. They never seem to remember to put the lid back on & they always dry out.<br>  <br>  <br>  I just bought some sweats from AE too....I love them!  I found some online in the clearance section for a great price.  One was an icky color, oat meal, & the other forest green, but they were cheap so i bought them.  I love them!  The I had to get the new ones that came out for full price.

LOL) then hit the table with a rag to get off anything fresh. If it didn't wash off easily, it wasca stain which was go big deal because it was a cheap plastic table and I didn't care. I ended up giving that table away when the kids got bigger and it got passed to another art loving little kid to enjoy.|`|kSZx9cY5aa	They can use pencil and crayons at the kitchen table but NOT markers-2 days after we got our new table we got a stain from a marker that is still faintly there.

lGSUToFQaa	you know i volunteer at HOPE which is an organization that deals with domestic violence and in the last 5 yrs they said in our state alone date violence has increased 50% between ages 16-24 that freaking scares the crap out of me, i have an 8 yr old daughter, i don't want her dating now, but you know you hear about it all the time, but no one is talking about how it's wrong, or how you can get away from it, or how there is help, and her going back to him, is just telling women it's okay, you know we actually had a meeting yesterday and not only is it up 50% but the homicide rate is up 20% and the sexual abuse is up 38% that tells me we aren't doing a good job today, it's never right to hit another person, but you hear about all the celebs doing it and then the kids are like oh well Chris brown does it or so and so does it and he's rich and famous, and then we meet with the guys who have to be in control so they abuse and they say, well my dad did it or whatever, how about you grow the balls and say, i like being in charge i like beating my wife, gf, kid whatever, i  need help, and go to therapy, not anger management, but therapy, i did my senior report on dv. and i was in shock at the women who die every year at the hands of their love ones, it's scary, and no one talks about it, like rihanna going back to him, that's saying it's okay, i know women do it cause they think it will never happen again or they can change him, but it never happens. <br>  <br>  my old roommate's hubby beat her so bad every time he was drunk so basically every weekend, and she was like well he never hits the kids so that makes it okay? then he did hit her son and she was like it's my fault, her son called me and i called the cops then i told her i would help them take her kids if she didn't leave him, she finally did, but so many don't, and it's crazy, i grew up watching my dad beat the crap out of my mom, i had 3 blood transfusions by the time i was 8, but my parents had money and were high standers in the community so everyone turned their heads, so when i hear the guys blame it on their past it makes me so mad, i didn't grow up to beat my kids, nor did i marry a man that beats me and i don't beat him so no its' not i can't help it i was raised that way<br>  <br>  sorry for the rant, good question|`|P544Sbmqaa	Being a star doesnt make you invincable to abuse, nor does it make her any less susceptable to the mental aspects of abuse. <br>  <br>  Instead of critizing her, people should be offering her the support she needs to get help.  <br>  <br>  We can all sit and say that if our men ever hit us it would be the last time, that we wouldnt put up with it.  But it can happen to every single one of us.  Leaving an abusive partner that you think you need and maybe are even still in love with is an incredably difficult thing to do.

If I had been her, my father would of came and got me, taken me home for counseling, and since all violence is wrong, he would not of hurt the guy physcially, but the guy would of never worked again again in the entertainment industry, and he would be in jail.....and thinking how lucky he was to be in jail, so that my brothers and dad didnt hurt him...|`|ntdGOZqGaa	First off I think its sad..I think she should have walked away from him and never speak to him again..but then yet again that's how abuse works right? I think it does send the wrong message to girls and boys, girls it tells them its ok if he hits you as long as he is sorry and he loves you. And boys to me I think it tells them its ok to hit girls that are weaker then you are as long as you tell them you are sorry and you love them. I think its very sad and a bad cycle to be in with. I don't care how old my sons are if they ever even raise a hand to a female they will have to answer to mama even if I'm 80. I think us parents have to raise our children to be strong and independent and know that they don't have to put up with being smacked around guy or girl.<br>  <br>  Edit: Also this is NOT the first time he has apparently smacked her around.

Leaving an abusive partner is hard - really, really hard. Some studies have shown that it takes an average woman 4-7 tries before she can leave her abuser for good. Why? Because abusers aren't transparent assholes all of the time. They can be very manipulative, and most of the time will wear down their partner's self-esteem quite thoroughly long before they start with the physical violence. They're also often charming and can be very loving and doting and romantic when they're not being violent. They can talk real pretty about what they've learned, how sorry they are, how they're going to change, how they can't change without the help of their wo/man. And of course, we want to believe that we haven't been so blind in choosing a partner for ourselves."|`|YlveXYHUaa	adorable little chrissy browns needs  his cocky little ***** *** beat back into its place. <br>  <br>  yes, men, you're generally stronger than us. and you generally last longer in fights. but we are not your bitches, no matter what society tells you.<br>  <br>  my ex hit me one time, and i used a hot frying pan on the side of his head. eggs got all over the floor, but it settled his *** down.<br>  <br>  why is rihanna holding back what we all know she has in her? some of these men are getting too cocky, black or white.  i think she needs to show every woman of every race what we all should do when a ***** man thinks he's high enough above us to kick us around like dogs.<br>  <br>  the story goes that eve came from adam's rib....under the arm to be protected, not above the head to be worshipped, and next to the heart to be loved.|`|g9vw4ovGaa	These young kids' parents should be teaching them better than that. I can say from personal experience. My husband returned home from Iraq with an extreme anger issue. I tried to take myself and my daughter out of the situation, he flipped out and knocked me out cold. Thats PTSD for you. My daughter seen it all, and her father feels incredible guilt for it, and probably will for the rest of his life, now every time he play wrestles with me she freaks out. These parents should teach their sons' that it is NOT ok to hit a woman, no matter what she does to you. It is wrong to put your hands on a woman. These mothers should teach their daughters respect. Most men do have trouble controlling their anger, so it should not be toyed with. I am a very strong independent woman. I'm still with my husband, no I don't take into account that he has PTSD, he did what he did. He apologized for it and is now seeking professional help. Do I think this is sending bad influences on my daughter? Maybe, But I will be for damned sure that she knows that no man should lay his hand on her, and she shouldn't do the same. Keep your hands to your self, hitting solves nothing. I will teach her to have self respect and to not stand for abuse. The first step to change is to realize that you have a problem, and from the news, Chris Brown is seeking help. I don't think it is wrong to send out to young girls that you shouldn't give up on someone that you love. If every person gave up at the slightest sign of trouble, then there would be nothing left. You can't give up on once occasion, if it would have happened more than once, then I would say yes, this is a bad situation and it should be dealt with properly. I can't say that it was the smartest thing to stay, because maybe it wasn't, but I want to prove that people can change if they want, and you shouldn't give up so easily, if it were ever to happen again, then most definitely my bags will be packed.|`|on5NQxhkaa	I don't think setting a good example should be the objective of whatever Rihanna chooses to do regarding her abuse.<br>  <br>  She needs to take care of herself first and foremost.

But we don't know the whole story... if Rihanna chooses to stay with him, I can only hope it's for a very good reason that we just don't understand as a public.<br>  <br>  I don't think celebrities need to cater to what we believe they "should" do, they need to live their lives just like everyone else.

Unfortuntately, holloywood is doing everything in it's power to set bad examples for today's young people and sadly way to many young people are looking up to these bad examples. Someone once told me young people should spend their time with elders because elders know a lot about life and have had many experiences. These elders teach, encourage, and guide the young. The problem with today is the young are guiding the young. Elders are no longer looked to and are no longer respected. They have been pushed from the for front to the background. This is unfortuntate. God Bless!
HBgnkltfaa	I'm not a fan of Regina.  For some reason, it strikes me as kind of a "mean-girl" name, much like Sabrina and Selena.  Also, I worry about the fact that some people pronounce it like ruh-GYE-nuh, which obviously has a very unfortunate rhyme.<br>  <br>  I think most people will like Magdalene better than Regina, but part of the reason Niamh Magdalene may have gotten higher ratings is the rhythm.  For example, I find a combo like Rose Madeline slightly more pleasing than Rose Miranda.  Eve Gwendolen is better to my ear than Eve Gianna.  If I wanted to use Regina as a middle name, I'd probably pair it with something two or three syllables and stressed on the first syllable.  Examples:<br>  Catherine Regina<br>  Alice Regina<br>  Helen Regina<br>  Seren Regina<br>  Charlotte Regina<br>  Emily Regina<br>  Elodie Regina<br>  Madeleine Regina<br>  Caroline Regina<br>  <br>  Perhaps Regina pairs best with a current-sounding common classic name -- the only combos up there that I really like are Catherine Regina, Charlotte Regina, and Emily Regina.  It needs something a bit happy and sunny, I think.  Helen Regina and Alice Regina are far too stern.<br>  <br>  I would rate Regina as a 4.  There's nothing really wrong with the name, and it fits well with the style of names I like, but I don't like it.<br>  <br>  On your list, my favorites would be, in order:<br>  <br>  1.  Magdalene (10/10)-- With the popularity of Madeline and the classic status of Margaret/Maggie, this name feels very wearable.  It's sweet and delicate.<br>  <br>  2.  Agnes (9/10) -- I love Agnes, though it doesn't fit my usual style of names and I'm not sure how usable it is.<br>  <br>  3.  Theresa (8/10) -- It feels like it should be a timeless classic, though it's actually quite unpopular now.  Still, I think people would be pleasantly surprised to hear this on a little girl, and its sounds are very current.<br>  <br>  4.  Regina (4/10) -- This is significantly below the other three.<br>  <br>  5.  Bernadette (3/10) -- I'm always surprised to see this name on people's lists.  I'm not sure what the appeal is.<br>  <br>  I already voted on your name list, but I wanted to say that I love your names.  It bugs me how the really good names ALWAYS get more thumbs-downs than thumbs-ups.  It seems like the only way to get more thumbs-ups than thumbs-downs is too choose common, predictable combos like Olivia Rose or Aidan James.|`|AA10166553	Regina is a very nice name. <br>  1.

It's the name of my past-aunt (she's not a blood relative, and my uncle and her were divorced a few years ago). She's not exactly a pleasant person, and tends to call our family on a regular basis because of her money problems that result from being spent on other not-so-long-lasting things... <br>  <br>  I think Regina makes a brilliant middle name, though. I agree that "Gina" is kind of an uncool nickname... I really don't like. But Regina minus the nickname isn't as icky. <br>  <br>  I suppose I'm not really a fan of Niamh as the middle name... to me, it seems to kind of clash with the "N" in Regina...it seems to run together a bit and sounds like "Regine Nuneeve" or something similar to that. Niamh is a gorgeous middle name, though. <br>  <br>  I suppose I would pair Regina with a different middle name...but I'm not really sure what kind of style you're looking for. So, I suppose your getting my own middle name style here, which tends to be in between odd and French. :)<br>  <br>  Regina Mireille /or Mireia -- This would probably be my favorite middle name for Regina (and almost any other name). It's pronounced "mee-RAY /or mee-RAY-a". <br>  <br>  Regina Laure -- pronounced "Laure". It's another French variant. <br>  <br>  Regina LaRue -- I know this one sounds a bit sing-songy and annoying... But I do love "Rue" middle names for some reason (though the only ones I can really find that are that pleasing are LaRue and Reuelle<br>  <br>  Regina JoAnne -- This is a bit odd... I'm pairing it with one of my other Aunt's names (JoAnne). But I JoAnne is one of my all-time favorite middle names (because of my aunt), and I thought I'd throw it in here. Even though the "J" clashes a bit with the j-sound in Regina. <br>  <br>  Regina Violette -- Violette is one of my favorite first names, as is Violetta (after a friend). I find it much more attractive than the similar Violet... but Violet is quite pleasing as well. <br>  <br>  Regina Marcheline -- I new middle name favorite of mine. <br>  <br>  Regina Carys -- Carys is a bit more "heard-of" today, but I love it anyway. It was my mom's favorite name (along with Carissa) but my dad vetoed it.<br>  <br>  Regina Christine -- I think this one flows extremely well, but most people I meet aren't really fans of Christine... In my own defense, it's my cousin's middle name, and I do love the Phantom of the Opera. :)<br>  <br>  <br>  Regina gets about a 6 / 10 from me. I think it's a fine name, but I would never really want to use it because of the ties that it has to my own previous aunt. <br>  <br>  As for the list...<br>  Bernadette -- I love Bernadette, surprisingly. I know it's a German name (I think, at least), but the "ette" ending seems rather French to me...which might be why I love it. It's a great name. <br>  <br>  Magdalene -- Magdalene is a nice name. It's absolutely gorgeous. It's another one that I wouldn't actually use, though...because of a person I know with the last name of Magdalena. I think it's a pretty name, though. <br>  <br>  Regina -- I've said, I do like the sound of Regina. But I wouldn't use it for personal reasons. <br>  <br>  Theresa -- Theresa sounds rather "motherly" to me...haha, probably because of "Mother Teresa" and all. It's another "pretty" name, but it just seems slightly old to me. Not quite classy, but on its way there. <br>  <br>  Agnes -- I can't say that I'm a fan of Agnes... I like Aggie, and prefer Agatha much more... Agnes doesn't sound old to me, but I've always associated it with being rather like an annoyingly trendy word... Like saying that something is full of "agness"...does that make sense? It just seems like a "made-up word" to me, rather than a name. And I know that's not true, but I can't picture it any other way... <br>  <br>  Well, good luck and I hope this helped!<br>  <br>  -- Amy|`|kaqPSgTVaa	My best friends sister's name is Regina so I like it cause I like her.|`|VmSKQ40Caa	I don't have a problem with it, but it is very open for teasing as it obviously rhymes with vagina, so don't name her that.

lGcpXteaaa	My daughter has gotten constipated quite a few times since i stopped breastfeeding. My Dr said its pretty normal for a baby to go more than a couple of days without pooping.<br>  I would definitely give him prunes. <br>  Is he ok with juice and being spoonfed? If so, you can buy little heinz pots of prunes and jars of apple-prune juice. Worked wonders for my little one.<br>  <br>  Ok, so you have started solids? What have you introduced? I was introducing bananas at 1st, it tasted good and she loved it!<br>  But bad idea, it really constipated her and ever since i stopped its been fine....also rice cereal...or any of the powdered cereals in fact. There a big no no.|`|a7c44ca57676a0db1e3d8ad650499612aa	If you have started him on baby food then that could be why it tends to make it harder for them to go. Babies can sometimes go up to 10 days w/o a bowel movement it is just their bodies adjusting. Now I don't suggest you wait that long before doing something just because that is uncomfortable for them. Prune juice will help. Feeding him applesauce can help him go. If you have a jumperoo kind of toy that will help sometimes because they are jumping up and down using those belly muscle and it can get things moving. You can try a warm bath and rub his belly and back with lotion in downwards motion. <br>  I would get too worried yet unless he is really fussy. If he is fussy try some of the ideas and if it doesn't help I would call the dr. and see what they want you do but I can almost be he will go before too long his bodies is just not ready.|`|xRZ1PRZwaa	*Edit<br>  <br>  Yes - it's most likely the solids! Try to avoid rice and bananas (my daughter became constipated with rice). Add a little prune puree to his oatmeal, and you'll have his little tushy under the shower in no time!<br>  <br>  ______________________________________...<br>  <br>  What a little cutie! Honestly, if this is not a normal pattern for him, I would strongly suggest bringing him in. While some babies don't poop for 4 days, that is usually the norm for them. Since this is out of the ordinary, there may be something going on.<br>  <br>  The likelihood is that everything is fine, and the change in his bowel activity could be attributed to a new food or perhaps a little tummy bug, but on this one, I'd still have it checked if it doesn't clear up by the morning.<br>  <br>  In the meantime here are a few ideas: a warm bath, gentle leg stretches (like a bicycle), gentle back and tummy rubs, prune juice, Karo (Corn) syrup, no bananas or rice cereal.<br>  <br>  If you're breastfeeding, try eating a nice big hunk of chocolate too (it tastes great and can have a laxative affect on a nursing baby).<br>  <br>  Hopefully some of the 'remedies' will work, and you won't have to bring him in.<br>  <br>  I hope he's feeling better soon!|`|1WBimx1laa	My daughter had the same problem. The doctor told me to go to walmart and get an adult suppository and half it and use it and that really helped. Its not the most convenient way in the world but it helps your baby feel better and the prune juice will help. Mix it with his formula and see if he will drink it.|`|AOvtRBU9aa	my baby went 6 days without a bowel  movement and the Dr said it was normal but she is breast fed so I'm not sure if it still applies to you guys. If your unsure call your ped. Is there an advice line you can call?|`|iLlEoIiiaa	My daughter use to get constipated all the time. If your baby eats baby food. Gerber makes a stage one prune food. It works so great. I would feed my daughter that and in the next day to day in a half she would poop. If your baby is not on foods yet try the prune juice. If that does not work they make children's/pediatrics suppository's. My doctor said to cut one of those in half jet some plain ky jelly and make sure you use a good amount so it is more comfortable for your little one. I believe you can give half a suppository ever 8 hours. If you have to go the suppository route make sure they are pediatrics though because there is a dose difference.|`|7fog5OKfaa	I have used the prune juice and it always worked for my babies - they also have apple prune that taste a little better.|`|r4E2zXL8aa	kyroooo sryup|`|n6XYYyoLaa	ur doc knows your baby and their health history, i would call them and ask them what they suggest specifically for your baby instead of doing something someone suggests on here...

SKJb6eLKaa	Make sure he knows to use a condom!<br>  And knows how to use it correctly.<br>  Make sure he knows the risks of having sex (STDs & getting a girl pregnant)<br>  <br>  My bestfriend is 14 and her and her boyfriend are sexually active, their relationship is healthy and they've been going out for 1 year..<br>  <br>  All you can do is educate him and make sure he's ready.. Not just doing it because the other guys are, that sort of thing.|`|kRaVa0Wraa	all you can do is educate him (like you said) and tell him how you really feel about it.<br>  encourage him to think over it carefully and for a long time before making his choice.<br>  whatever choice he makes will affect him some way, good or bad.<br>  he just needs to understand the pros and cons.|`|0DtWgXxUaa	Talking about sex with anyone besides friends is awkward for people who aren't mature enough for it.<br>  What you told him is very true. Once they have sex, there are so many strings attatched, and often, realise they have 'no further' to go with eachother. (Unless they love one another, a lot.)<br>  Your brother is a male, but let him know what it would be like to be a father. Could he handle it? If not, he can't handle putting his penis into a woman either! A lot of kids are nieve "i'll use a condom". 1 in 33 "I'll use a condom" couples have a pregnancy. <br>  It is 100% ok to wait. He is a normal teen and sex is something reserved for people who love eachother, if he just wants to pleasure himself really, there is another way to do that and you won't have any risks! It's good! Go for that one!<br>  Having sex with someone does not prove your love, at that age, it does the opposite. It likely makes it seem like you are just trying to get the girl 'into bed'.<br>  He shouldn't convince her. They are too young. Especially when they "don't know" if they "love" eachother. ("Love" when you're 14 is a whole lot different to real love, and if they haven't even got that, they got nothing!)<br>  <br>  Tell him, NO.|`|3ERx4opSaa	at 14, boys dont feel true love, or that is mental love. They are only driven by hormones, and thats all. tell him just because he gets an erection doesnt mean he needs to have sex, in my opinion even dating at that age is meaningless.<br>  <br>  oh and he should feel comfortable talking about sex with family and friends, not everyone, not those pediphiles.|`|FiUprYsvaa	I have a 14 year old brother and I would tell him NO WAY IN HELL. <br>  My brother is the youngest and is used to getting his way too. <br>  <br>  I would tell him that no way in hell for atleast another 2 years and even then he better be in a relationship for atleast 6 months and really committed to that person. And he better use protection or i'll go ape shyt on his ***. <br>  <br>  And if he has sex at 14 or he doesn't use protection when he does around 16 or 17. Then if my mom doesn't I will take away all his video games and his cell phone and they'll stay in my apartment till I feel he isn't a dumbass anymore. <br>  <br>  <br>  But thankfully my brother is smart and I won't have to go ape shyt on his ***.

N2AKuvVkaa	The easiest way to tell if you could be pregnant would be to go down to your local chemist and get a pee on a stick pregnancy test. Get the one that has 2 tests in it - if one fails, then there is always a back up.<br>  <br>  Hope this has helped.<br>  <br>  Kym J|`|dLHAUn0Saa	most women when they get pregnant leak a brown substance from "down there" and get this pain between "down there" and there belly button. not the chest pain ... thats just something else wrong with you ... but yeah you're 90% likely to be pregnant ... good luck ... and im sorry but its just pretty weird that you remembered the days that fornication took place ... =]|`|AA11291778	Just take anti Spasmodic pills 1 tablet thrice a day.it will help in menstrual cramps....i think you are not prgnant...|`|kaqPSgTVaa	Maybe yes.

I am a nurse in labor and delivery and that last thing you need to do is go get pregnant! Your 18 in 3 years you won't be with the same guy, your hormones are raging but you do not need to screw some innocent babies life up cuz you wanted to be selfish at 18 and have a baby cuz there cute and cuddly and cuz its the cool thing to do like all your friends.<br>  Do you have a job to support a kid?<br>  What are you gonna tell them when they resent you for not being able to take care of them cuz you were to young? What are you gonna say when the kid asks where the father is?<br>  <br>  Your to young to be TRYING to be pregnant! If I had my way everyone 15 to 20 would be on birth control! Do yourself a favor and get on the pill. In 6 years you'll be happy you did.

Not your mama's gravy, no, our special gravy!<br>  Him: Okay, do you have parsley?<br>  Us: NO, we do not have parsley! We're not one of those frilly expensive places!<br>  Him: Alright then...<br>  Us: So, we're gonna deliver. What's your address?<br>  Him: I don't know.<br>  Us: I DO NOT HAVE ALL DAY!

The friend who was doing this prank call put on her weakest voice, and since he didn't answer his phone, left the following voicemail:<br>  *random name<br>  <br>  "Andy...Andy...Help me...I'm at the dumpsters at school...I messed up...I'm sorry, Andy...I need you...Help me, Andy...Andy..."<br>  <br>  The next morning he texted our other friend asking if she left him a voicemail.

Muahahahaha!|`|FiUprYsvaa	I have 3 stories. <br>  <br>  My friend and I used to love making prank phones. <br>  It was her and I in these 3 stories.<br>  <br>  Story One: We were both 13/14. We were prank calling a bunch of numbers, it was funny. It was night and winter and we had nothing better to do. Christmas was a few days away. My friend and I were sitting in my living room in my mom's apartment and all of a sudden we heard sirens. We were so scared. We turned off all the lights and looked out the window and we saw lights coming around the corner and we thought we had been caught. <br>  It was just a fire truck with santa on top. Going though neighborhoods giving out candy and little toys. <br>  <br>  Story 2: We pranked called an eating disorder hotline and told the lady we ate people and they just tasted so good and like chicken. <br>  The woman said with her most serious voice, I have your number on caller ID. We hung up. <br>  <br>  Story 3: We were picking random numbers out of the phone book. And one of the numbers didn't answer and it went to voicemail. Well, we wanted to leave a funny message but couldn't think of what to say in such a short amount of time. So when it beeped my friend quickly stuck the phone by her but and farted as loud as she could. <br>  <br>  <br>  I miss my friend so much. We live a few states away now but we have great memories.
P5Iq6nufaa	LOL, I think the core problem is better addressed with the question "What's a good bedtime for a 17-year-old?" You are clearly not getting to bed at a good time, as you are getting up as late as possible in order to make it to school on time. If you need to be at school by 8:00 and need to leave at 7:00, you should be up by 6:00. For a teen, that means to bed by 10:00. An hour to take your shower, get dressed, and eat breakfast (which you should do, even if it's just some fruit and orange juice) should be plenty of time. This all might mean reorganizing your schedule between the end of your school day and bedtime to fit in extracurriculars, homework and some downtime, but schedule organization is one of the best things you can learn in life.|`|7nOkNtw4aa	Well, the night before put your homework in your backpack/purse whatever, make your lunch if you have to, and choose your clothes.<br>  Also shower at night.<br>  Then in the morning eat a quick breakfast, get changed, brush your teeth, do your hair/make-up, grab your books and go.<br>  <br>  Doing your work at night will help you have more time to get yourself ready in the morning. <br>  <br>  Good Luck.|`|0DtWgXxUaa	Go to bed at 9.00 on weeknights.

n6XYYyoLaa	if this is true:<br>  i am sorry to hear about your wife..try being calm and relaxed when holding your son, they pick up tension and anxiety....walk up and down the hall with him, pat his bum or back in a rhythmic pattern, he may be too old, but if he's not moving around a lot or you are there to watch over him, try swaddling him, or swaddling him and then carrying/patting etc....you will find what works for you before you know it..|`|tyuxbdrnaa	I am so sorry for your loss.<br>  You will soon learn what sooths your baby...every baby is different.<br>  Some like rocking, swaying, bouncing, singing, humming, lullabye music, car rides, warm baths.<br>  Best wishes...and cherish your son.|`|Bm5TLWgdaa	stay close. be interactive. hold him more. all attention exercises.|`|mPCbFcwbaa	babys can feel your mood so if your sad your baby's sad, but still keep him close and stay calm and i am sooooo very sorry for what happened.|`|zHG5gjBZaa	Sorry to you for your loss.  Go outside for a walk it will do wonders for the both of you.. Do you have family there to help you usually in the first month or so you would?????|`|PTKiTblZaa	omg im so sorry. id just try to be there|`|V3ZyGJMtaa	He understands your feeling if you are stressed which i now you are he will pick up on that and it will be harder to calm him down. Lay him in his bed or on a blanket take a second to calm down your self and then go back get him hold him close talk to him smile show him everything is okay.. Sing to him if nothing else the ABCs everything will be okay. It sounds like to me your wife did the most when it came to taking care of him and theres nothing wronge with that but thats what he was used to as well.. You will both get though just let him know everything is okay even if your feeling its not.|`|XE2uBcSJaa	you could try a massage if you get johnsons baby massage oil try massaging him with that sometimes it calms the baby and relaxes them, try putting him in front of a tv big pictures help to focus him on something else and the flickering and noise will keep him destarcted. hope it helps!!|`|mQg5SVQXaa	Just hold him a lot, sing to him, read to him, play with his toys with him--do a lot of one-on-one activities like most moms do.  If you have a stroller, taking walks (or drives) might work wonders.
CdJtH0xdaa	Firstly, I should tell you to make sure you're pregnant. Have you taken a pregnancy test? That's what I'd say first. Then, talking about not missing school, I'd consult your school principal. He/she will know what is the best for you, and he/she will know how to help you, and could possibly transfer you to another administrator who will be willing to help you. Good luck to you.|`|ejQ3yg9Naa	Talk to your counselor. Here we have two high schools that have a program for pregnant girls and mothers, find out if any of your schools around there have this. They give you a break on attendance and they have a day care on campus. Or ask if there's high schools that specialize just in pregnant girls and young mothers near you. I'm glad your smart enough to know you need to finish school. I'm sure you, your parents and counselor will find a way you can do it.|`|0DtWgXxUaa	Take a test as soon as you can, only start worrying about these things then.|`|XrKviWgSaa	yes talk to your school counselor and your school principal about getting something set up for you to do school and when you go into labor for you to have a tutor so you do not get behind in your school work, or do what i did and do online schooling. its free and the classes are really easy and you can do them whenever you can.|`|NOjcTeT4aa	Go to the counselor and say exactly what just said. I applaud you for owning up and trying to make a plan that works.|`|Vv6Dg6Q0aa	I sure can bet I'm as good as I think I am because I graduated without being knocked up.<br>  <br>  If you're planning to work full time and go to school, where does this baby fit into this plan?|`|HLKb961Qaa	Yes, talk to your counselor, there are acedemic plans for pregnant high schoolers, so you can take normal classes up until a certain point in your pregnancy. Then there's courses on line and part-time in-school programs that also offer child care. It's also a possibility that you can take a high school equivalency test during your junior year to get your GED and start working full or part time with a high school diploma in hand, which can increase your earning potential. Good luck!|`|W16vRFTNaa	well what i did was i started home schooling idk where you live, but you really should look in to it they helped me saty in my grade and i even graduated early. I only went to school one day a week since i was pregnant and had bad morning sickness. but they halped alot . i am sure your counsoler can refer you to a school like that. <br>  <br>  also just some advice dont go to those pregnancy schools they suck and they treat you bad there from my experinces and some friends.|`|RH4PM3fEaa	i would talk to a counsellor or maybe the head of your year. or even a teacher that you trust.<br>  congratulations, you've made a mistake but you and your bf are owning up to your responibilities<br>  well done|`|NYJgiVxraa	this one girl at my school was pregnant and she got off when she was close to delivery. mind you she is strong, not everyone is like that. on jobs they let u off a year. i think for schooling, they can let u continue but when you are near delivery or are in sever pain at that time, they can probably ask u to find someone to bring the work to you of each day. idk  talk to ur guidance couneesllor. they owuld no for sure. if you dont feel comfy going such as in physical terms, talk tto u r parents and then let them deicde of how to approach the school with the isssue. if u feel hurt that people wont liek u that is not true. ur true friends will stay by ur side. that is what i witnessed with the pregnant teen at my school. they will not make fun of you if the uytruly care about you and to the people who d ont, ignored htem. they obviously do not know enough about what  happens to judge.|`|eFGXMRsGaa	Talk to your guidance counselor. Thats what I did in high school. I had my baby when I was 14 and I talked to my guidance counselor and she set up some temporary plans for me. You could also go into independent studies which is what I would probably recommend while being pregnant. You have so much time to take care of yourself and the baby when it comes (if you are pregnant). If you are pregnant I wish you luck and I hope that the baby will be healthy and strong and I am also proud of you for caring about your school, thats a great first step.|`|nmJrgVrEaa	I am just giving you advice on what i would do because i have been through the same situation my self i am 17 and having a baby. Let me first say good luck on whatever your decision is... but I got my GED it only takes 4 to 6 months and it gives you enough time if you dont even know for sure yet to get your education sqared away and then have time for a job and a baby because i will tell you if you are going to get a job and go to school and take care of the baby it will be VERY VERY VERY hard. But as far as what you said about how to tell your parents is tell them the truth IDK your parents so i dont know how they would react to the news but being truthful is the best option. There are programs you can go through with getting help with diapers car seats infant formula child care classes ect that would be very helpful... Good luck hope all goes well.
AOvtRBU9aa	it's very common. I do CT scans on a lot of children with this condition. Most of the time a shunt will be place. If not treated early on, it can cause convulsions or mental retardation. Make sure you guys go get the cat scan done ASAP|`|0cfba6ec58258d9277443cf769413b9eaa	I don't have any experience with this but here is a website that may help you <a href="http://www.hydrocephalus.org/facts.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.hydrocephalus.org/facts.htm</a> I wish you and your son the best I hope everything turns out alright for you God bless and good luck|`|XT0sGJchaa	Different Treatments:<br>  1.Drugs- in case of infection, Only used if Infection is causing the Hydrocephalus.<br>  2.Surgery- Either a small catheter is inserted to drain fluids or a shunt is put in place(normally for Congenital hydrocephalus). <br>  3.

The dr. sent us for an MRI, where he was put to sleep. It was so scary, but he came out just fine.  We got a call the next day saying that he did not have hydrocephalus, he just had a little extra room in between his skull and his brain.  He is a very big boy, and his head fits his body perfectly! I hope that you get the same results. I know how scary and worry some it can be, but try to stay calm until you know for sure!
Cx5Zo7IIaa	Was your friend on here? diannnners, if so her data was very flawed. That being said your opening a can of worms with this question, you're gonna get mean and sanctimonious answers. I am for right to chose. I've had an abortion and I'm not sorry I did, it was the best thing considering the circumstances. I am now the mother to a three month old daughter who is healthy and very much wanted.<br>  Check out ImNotSorry.net|`|kaqPSgTVaa	I don't think anyone is "for" abortions. <br>  <br>  I'm pro choice.|`|S4DNQkFraa	I'm pro-life. But, I feel that need for an abortion would be if incest, rape or if the baby caused a risk for health issues resulting in death, then yes, have one, other then that, no.|`|ZqGlQTFDaa	I am a pro-life College student and member of Students for Life. Rapes only consist of 5% of abortions. The vast majority (95%) are from unprotected CONSENSUAL sex.|`|459948c9c4124486ce62f73d24b95fe3aa	I am pro choice.  I don't think anyone (but idiot trolls) calls themselves pro-abortion.|`|vSTtAfOWaa	I am completely against it. I mean getting raped is a horrible thing. And I'm pretty young  myself and getting pregnant WOULD destroy my life. But really, that is NOT the babies fault. And the baby should NOT have to be torn apart limb for limb just because the babies father did what he did. Abortion is a very touchy subject for me. I feel very strongly about it. Think of all the human lives who are destroyed each day. All the possibilities of this world...lost. The man that you were meant to marry...even he might have been lost. I believe humans are made in the "image and likeness of God" so we are destroying THAT. It is not the woman's choice, just because there is life inside her. That is GOD'S life, inside her,  to work with. Not her's. We are living in a holocaust of mother's destroying their children. It isn't meant to work like that.<br>  <br>  EDIT: I was just reading some of the answers. Yes, a baby CAN feel pain in the mother's whom. Anyone who has a heart beat and can dream, can feel pain. Also, like, basically the moment of conception cells start being made. Nerves start being made, and nerves cause PAIN. Nerves are the reason we can feel.<br>  When babies are very young (meaning small and they can move around easily in the mother) they do turns. Turn around, flip around. Imagine a little person doing that not knowing that his mother is driving to an abortion clinc to get him ripped apart, limb for limb. I've SEEN pictures (worse things I have ever looking at in my life) pictures of bloody, small, baby hands. Yeah,suuurrre THAT doesn't cause pain. Yeah right! And the "burn" abortions. Is that what we have come to?  BURNING helpless children inside their mother's????!!!!!!!!!!<br>  If you want to talk about this please email me. (I promise I won't be too crazy. lol.) I am all for discussing this subject. I can go religious, if you are religious. I can go non-religious if you are not. Whatever you'd like.|`|4Uuehq2Faa	Im for abortion, if someone needs it, the option should be there especially if the woman and fetus would die anyway, e.g ectopic pregnancy, pre-eclampsia,too young to carry a pregnancy (e.g the 9 yr old girl situation),cancer,fetus had abnormalities etc.. also i believe if someone is very mentally unwell to the point of suicide/wanting to harm the child i dont think they should be carrying a baby if they feel this way.<br>  <br>  Not everyone is able to carry to term and adopt.|`|T3OGT4Ntaa	I know it's easy to think that getting pregnant before you're ready can destroy your life, but it happens ALL the time.  Both of my sisters got pregnant outside of marriage.  One chose to give up her baby for adoption and the other chose to keep her baby, and both of them have great lives now!|`|mQBwQKtOaa	I'm not for abortions. i think it some cases it is nessary tho. Like you said if someone got raped. I dont think they should have the baby. I also feel that abortions are not birth control and you shouldn't be having unprotected sex if you can handle having a child!|`|tR36oILvaa	it really depends on the situation. <br>  If you are raped then yes have an abortion. one shouldn't have to live with the memory  if one doesn't want to.<br>  <br>  but people shouldn't think abortions are another type of contraception. using it like that is really wrong|`|gQpswYdsaa	I think people should be allowed the choice. It doesnt cause the baby any pain and if the parents dont want it or cant take care of it, its better then giving birth than dumping out the front of a hospital when noone is looking.|`|qzY6TuQmaa	i don't like it but i will say if ur ganna get it get it b-4 the baby can feel pain i forget how far it is when they start feeling pain|`|HFWLYMD6aa	I agree with the first answer. I agree we should have the choice. But if you need to have one a second time, you should maybe try some birth control!|`|hAuemuWTaa	I think in that case u r still killking a baby.|`|xHHBr4jgaa	I am against it 110%. I don't care about the situation; if you don't want the baby you can always get it adopted. I think anyone who gets an abortion or even considers one is selfish and is just thinking about them selves and not the baby who is also a human being that has feelings just like everyone else in the world. I think more people should follow how the bible says a person is born at the moment of conception.|`|nQQs4HFgaa	I am totally against it but I do understand where you are coming from I have been raped and got pregnant from it I had a miscarriage. I am a bit older then you but there is always other options you can give the child up for adoption. Think about that child he/she didn't do anything wrong why doesn't he/she deserve to live?|`|q0Ju2pO2aa	im AGAINST it!!!<br>  im 17 and pregnant and would never kill my baby i dont care for no reason its wrong and selfish!<br>  if your thinking about gettin raped and having a baby your really stupid for that you dont need to do that for your somewhat a baby yourself <br>  getting raped is a bad thing i have gotten raped 2 times and its no good and it scares you for life its not funny nor nething to think about NEVER!|`|zdWDkadraa	Pro-choice. I know too many neglected children (many who have been taken away from their parents eventually) and think it would be best to abort a child if you can't take care of them, and know so.<br>  <br>  Having said that, after watching the pro-life video "silent scream" on youtube I personally will never be able to abort a child of my own.|`|98bxBr20aa	I think you should get it if you get raped, incest or if it posed as a major health risk. I think it should banned for randoms, as they need to understand abortions arent birth control. They had a choice to use protection so they should have to continue on with the pregnancy.|`|UFGDrqUlaa	AGAINST!!!<br>   <br>  one of your reasons could be that having an abortion is just as (if not more) painful than giving birth- so if the mother was young and was raped, she should just have the child and give it to adoption.|`|Og09Q7ylaa	Abortion at any stage of pregnancy, on demand! I cannnot figure out for the life of me how anyone can honestly believe that these blobs of cellular yuck take precedence over the women carrying them. FOCA supporter all the way!|`|whVTbDnMaa	I'm against abortion. There are so many options after giving birth that wasting a life isn't one.|`|EmhBDHMtaa	Soo Against it!!

vygYFdsSaa	I'm right there with you sister I'll get in fights with the bf and just like even when I'm doing it think in my head "I'm being so crazy" its normal. It sucks but we can't really do anything to stop it.|`|96HWpdkFaa	I'm the same way right now with my husband my moods are ALL over the place. I'm 11 weeks.<br>  It's the hormones..try not to stress to much..I know it's hard.<br>  I don't have alot of advice cause I'm being the same way but it's normal.|`|9hrJfhIIaa	Uh.... that's the hormones. There's nothing you can do except relax. I found that driving around calmed me down when I felt myself going out of control. I'm 18 weeks now and it's been getting better - hang in there.|`|YNH2fmYWaa	maybe the best thing to do for now is to just think before you speak..and your boyfriend needs to understand that you are pregnant and that you are going to be bitchy!<br>  <br>  good luck sweetie! i hope it gets better!|`|yaAhsEwxaa	its the hormones dont worry about it.<br>  itll pass.and i think that if hes with you then it wouldnt matter if you were prettier than her because once again hes with you.|`|3f3ba2deef7e904bc28bbb494ec7b708aa	Pregnancy is a crazy thing and hes gotta hold on for the ride..When I was pregnant with my first I broke a couple cell phones and bounced one off of my hubby's head(kinda funny but not right i know) Just ask your man if he can help you to calm down...he needs to reassure you that hes happy about the baby and that he thinks you are attractive and all that. Your body takes on many changes during pregnancy and a woman needs to be reminded that they are still beautiful!|`|G5kEfkOUaa	There's nothing you can do about your mood swings, dear...They're perfectly natural, even if they're insane and annoying. lol I'm 25 weeks, and I've had those conversations with my boyfriend. He's also said that he wishes I wasn't pregnant. <br>  <br>  In early pregnancy, you have so much more hormones in your body (progesterone, I think) that your body and brain really don't know what to do with them, and that's why you have mood swings. It's supposed to even out as your pregnancy progresses into the 2nd and 3rd trimesters. If it's any consolation, mine have...<br>  <br>  It will get better, I promise. Just let your boyfriend know that you're gonna be a little crazy for a while but it'll get better.
on5NQxhkaa	You gotta take this directly to the board... that is NOT acceptable. No one should be able to lay a hand on your daughter.<br>  <br>  Tell the principal\teacher FIRMLY: "The next time this is an issue, I am going straight to the administration. I have given you the opprotunity to handle this situation and if you can't then I will find someone who will."<br>  <br>  Hopefully they will take your threat seriously, because if the school board finds out they aren't doing anything to help your daughter, they will probably get into trouble.<br>  <br>  Good luck, hope your daugher feels better :)|`|DZvhiX8Raa	i dont have any kids acually i am a kid but wat i would do is take her out of school untill they knock some sence into this girl.|`|S5WsBJI4aa	Contact the school board of education or file a police report if you have to be extreme. We have had our share of educators who would rather turn their heads to things like this...<br>  Good luck.|`|TzSg9ZEnaa	You have no clue if her mom is teaching her manors or not so don't assume this.<br>  <br>  she obviously isnt learning her lesson if they keept talking to her.<br>  <br>  You NEED to DEMAND something happens to this child..that she gets suspended or some kind of punishment.If she was a teen, her *** would be expelled if she kept on hurting other kids.<br>  <br>  write to the school district or call the cops and ask them if they can do anything (maybe the can scare the crap outta the kid)|`|ob9oJpKbaa	Aw, your poor little munchkin!<br>  <br>  I would go straight to the mother- the school obviously isn't. Come from a positive place so the mother doesn't get all defensive. Say you really like the little girl (even if you dint), and that you would love the girls to be friends, but your little girl has been hurt by her several times, and is scared of her. The mum might have no idea she is doing it if the school has been slack about contacting her.<br>  <br>  If that doesn't work, take photos, say its physical abuse, & tell the school you'll report them for negligence! Isn't that the norm these days?! Lol!<br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|AA10943329	there is a very good chance the mum is trying to break this habit too. Don't presume she is not.<br>  Tell the principle you want something done NOW. Drawing blood is serious. This kid needs a couple of days suspension for this behaviour. <br>  Go to the doctors about the bite (human mouths have many germs) and get photographs. Then ask the principal who is above him, in the chain of command as you are going to take this further if something is not done.<br>  In this day of HIV I would be thinking the mother does not want her daughter biting. And until then tell your daughter to stay away from this kid|`|prqrQcd1aa	If this is an ongoing thing and the principal and teacher have not done anything to satisfy the safety of your child then it's time to go to the school board about it! <br>  <br>  I've not been in this situation, but i have a child that has behavior problems (she isn't a bully) and my child was put on a bevahior plan for school....sounds like this child that is bitting your daughter needs to have the same thing done with her!|`|vNgDz5Jnaa	Teach your daughter that it's ok to defend herself. If the classmate bites, bite back.|`|AaoclPYCaa	The school is responsible for keeping your daughter safe when she is there.  Tell them that if they can't keep her safe you are going to file a complaint with the school board.  Next time she comes home with a bad bite I also would call the police and have them make a report.  This is very abusive and I am sure this has got to be damaging to your daughter in more ways than you can imagine.  Five year olds should not have to worry about being safe.  Its up to parents and teachers to keep them safe.  If the child is doing this to other children too she needs to be removed from the class.|`|YlveXYHUaa	i hate to say this, but my little sister went through the same situation and my mother told her that if she didn't go to school the next day and bite, scratch and punch the other little girl with all she had, she was losing her tv for a week.<br>  <br>  The teacher had to pull my sister off the other little girl, but after that the kid never treated my sister bad again. My dad just made it clear never to hit anyone unless they hit you more than three times total. That's just the rule in our family and we are not bullies, not violent, and yet are not bullied or abused. <br>  <br>  Just what I learned. People are going to give me a million thumbs down for it, but I don't care. It just depends on how much you want to see your own flesh and blood get treated like crap.|`|qPbKJeXzaa	Bullying is vile and there should be a program in your daughter's school to address this issue.  If there isn't, shame on the school and it might be worth canvassing other parents to push for such a program.  At very least the oldest children in the school should be buddying the youngest ones.<br>  <br>  In the meantime, it is important that your daughter be able to defend herself.  The first stage is for her not to present as a victim, but someone who is assertive.  You might want to rehearse at home body language and assertive statements your daughter could make to this bully.  The most basic one is - with one hand raised as a stop sign and facing the bully, legs a little apart, "STOP THAT! I DON'T LIKE IT" in a loud firm voice.<br>  <br>  Hopefully there are classes in your area your daughter could attend to help her learn to defend herself appropriately.
ggfE4rlvaa	38 weeks with my first and 39 weeks and 4 days with my second. My water broke with my first, second kept me up all night with severe contractions before she decided to get me dilated enough for the hospital! lol.
AiJeS6I1aa	You need to go in to the ER if you are losing that much blood.  It is possible that you have retained placenta.  This can become infected and cause heavy bleeding and pain.  Do you have any other signs like foul-smelling blood or fever?<br>  <br>  Please go now.|`|kaqPSgTVaa	If the clots are bigger than a quarter that's not ok. You should probably get a hold of your doctor or go to the ER if the bleeding continues to be so heavy.|`|fe6fcbf713d0ed0538de9c9304001a52aa	If you bleed through more than one "super" tampon, or one pad per hour contact your doctor.<br>  <br>  If you have clots bigger than a US quarter -contact your doctor.|`|8b9e5894f70e3364d0f2490295d49b82aa	I don't think so.  You should contact your doctor right away. <br>  <br>  Good luck!
VHHis05Naa	*hug*<br>  <br>  I had/have HG, too.  It's lessened a lot since my second trimester, but the nausea has not left.  My husband seemed to resent me, too, but really, he just resented the HG and the huge burden it placed on all of us.  You can't help having HG, geez, if we could help that, no one would ever put themselves through that.  It's hell on Earth to go through months feeling like you are dying.  I know you're upset that your husband isn't having fun, but you're not having fun, either.  Parenting is a partnership and so is pregnancy is many ways.  He promised to be there for you in sickness and in health, didn't he?  And this will NOT last forever, even though it feels like it.<br>  <br>  I definitely questioned my ability to get through this pregnancy...but I am getting through it.  I had HG to 20-odd weeks, with nausea and once a week vomiting continuing to this day.  I've also been sick with virus after virus, which left my husband having to pick up the slack again.  Oh well.  You know what?  He got through it.  Sure, he complained a little, but what he's been through is nothing compared to what I've been through and he knows it.  <br>  <br>  Just take each day as it comes.  And hang in there.|`|Cx5Zo7IIaa	Things will get better in your second trimester just hang in there the best you can.|`|nlKZRNqmaa	You will get through it. This pregnancy is really affecting my body too. I am sure as time goes by.. your body will feel better. Just try not to stress too much and relax so your baby will be relaxed. Talk to your partner about your concerns and I am sure ya'll can talk things out. Trust me...bringing a child into this world is no easy task! Good Luck|`|ntdGOZqGaa	Well, yea it might be hard on the hubby but he will be ok. If you can get through the pregnancy he can too. Maybe you guys can see if a family member can watch the 19 month old for a night or something and you guys have dinner and spend time together bc it sounds like you both need it a lot. Talk to him too, let him know that you are sorry that all of this is happening and that you didnt want it to turn out like this and once you are better things will be different. Trust me I'm all for men helping but he does work too and it is hard. But I think if you guys just talk and maybe let him get a break from the baby and you guys spend time together it will make things better. Good luck|`|vygYFdsSaa	Oh sweetie it seems like every obstacle possible is being thrown in your path. I'm so sorry for everything you're going through. It will be ok though. Honestly you don't really have a choice, you HAVE to get through this pregnancy. I believe you have the strength to get through this. Always remember that what doesn't kill us makes us stronger.
qzY6TuQmaa	ummmm i don't think so but if shes in his apt or other then yea.... and its just plan creepy!!! (also y would a 23year old man want to talk to a 13 year old he must b a loser!!)|`|CTN8bnVgaa	That depends.  A guy from Pakistan told me about a guy who saw his nephew talking to a girl who wasn't related to him, so the uncle got his rifle and killed them both.  Then the guy said "They're too strict over there."|`|vygYFdsSaa	If you're using "talk" as a euphemism for "hook up" then yes absolutely.|`|rMuBHXg5aa	It is not illegal to TALK to anyone but if you are thinking of having sex...BEWARE!! <br>  Thirteen year olds are minors and 23 year olds are adults who could face serious charges if they have sex with a minor.|`|FiUprYsvaa	No, you can talk to anyone you want to.|`|yXx1nB0Qaa	Not unless the talk is sexual in nature.|`|rBq189W1aa	No it's not.<br>  <br>  No spanking this time, I'm afraid.|`|31269476570b3829c86de1e8c487e423aa	uh its not illegal for anyone to talk to someone are u kidding me?|`|eoV0NWjSaa	baby i talked to a 23 year old when i was 6. i wasn't ARRESTED. free country talk to whoever nothing happens. hold on i live in the US. you might not. anyway it doesn't matter if you talk to them but dating? no|`|Rk87mqkoaa	Hahahahaha! Yeah, it's illegal for a 13yo to talk to her older sister (23yo) or her 23yo friends. OMG idiots.|`|kaqPSgTVaa	Not just talking. If they are having sexual conversations it can cross the line though.|`|LKIhUMCgaa	no, but it would be illegal for a 23 year old to talk to a 13 year old lol<br>  <br>  well it's not illegal unless the conversation is sexual.|`|01Mu3wUeaa	No.<br>  <br>  <br>  It would be illegal for a 13 year old to have sexual relations (verbal/physical) with a 23 year old.|`|nrqWwQBXaa	what do you mean by talk. just talk about every day things then no but if they are boyfriend girl friend then yes it is not ok for that?|`|prqrQcd1aa	if it is in a sexual nature then yes!
mqHL4UcRaa	You need to know how to time them, and you need to start now. When you have a contraction (like braxton hicks) time when the contraction started and when it ended. Write it down. Then when you have another contraction, time it. Then you count the time between those contractions. When your contractions are 5 minutes apart, then you need to head to the hospital.|`|kpnSKV6Eaa	your pretty close, anything can give you contractions now i guess... also you time them from the beginning of the contraction starting to the beginning of the next one starting... you will also need to separatly time how long they are lasting|`|Uoukx6Pdaa	Start timing when your contraction stops to when its starts. If it is getting shorter in between and the contraction seems longer and stronger start to the hospital.|`|O954jjpcaa	Yes.  The irritation to the cervix can start the ball rolling.  If you can't talk through them comfortably, go to the hospital or call your provider.|`|DBKV3g4baa	There are many websites you can use to help time contractions.  Try Contraction Master, simply hit the space bar at the beginning and end of contractions and the website calculates and displays the duration and length between contractions for you.|`|y5sWmbtnaa	It could but you could probably never prove it if you had wanted to. You may just be going into labor naturally or you could be having "false labor" which is different from braxton hicks contractions but isn't true labor.
hoX7hoINaa	You can still go full term. Walk alot, have sex, and do squat exercises. All this should help at least get him into position|`|JreuGwJYaa	It all depends on what your body wants to do. I was dialated at 2 and 80% effaced for 2 months then finally and 37 and 6 weeks I drank some castor oil, took a hot bath and talked to the baby and went for a walk I had him the next morning.|`|XzbRZCPUaa	you can actually be dilated for weeks so there really is no way to tell sorry|`|04833260a508ecf8d2a4938012444526aa	You could go tomorrow or it could be 2 or 3 weeks yet.Is it your first?Even with my second I was at 2cm. for 2 weeks.|`|7SKVCPcSaa	until you actually start pushing, its so hard to tell... even  with all the info the doc gives you.. you can stay 2 cm for weeks.<br>  <br>  but no more than 5 weeks. they wont let you go past week 42.
y5sWmbtnaa	Your body will absorb calcium better if you take or eat more vitamin d rich foods.|`|mqHL4UcRaa	Milk is not the only way to get calcium, although it is a good source. You can eat cheese, yogurt, white bread, Brazil nuts, sardines, cream cheese, or even take calcium supplements. <br>  <br>  TUMS may be mistaken for a calcium supplement, but it is not a reliable source because the active ingredient actually inhibits the absorption of the calcium.|`|h5cFkP35aa	any dairy product - yogurt, cheese, even chocolate milk if you get tired of regular. just check the label on everything you eat. also, taking your prenatal along with a calcium supplement will help a lot. <br>  <br>  it's very important to get your calcium. if you dont get enough, the baby will take it from you. your bones, decaying your teeth, etc. <br>  <br>  good luck.|`|vygYFdsSaa	Calcium supplements, yogurt, cheese, other dairy products...of course milk isn't the only way!|`|duinadV4aa	all dairy product yogurt, cheese, milk etc
h5cFkP35aa	definitely a possibility. all the signs point to yes. i would suggest going to the hospital but if you'd like to wait until they get closer, i understand, the hospital sucks. i'm excited for you and good luck hun.|`|tivpa7Vlaa	try doing some walking now that you are near the end and bub WILL be here by tonight|`|duinadV4aa	sounds like you'll be having him by early morning to me|`|Uoukx6Pdaa	You can never tell how long it will really be. I would say you may still have a good 5 or 6 hours left depending on if its your first baby or not.
8259f37f3bb63217d47d975af43b7855aa	Oh yeah, I've had it.  Achey, and leaves you feeling crampy & miserable.  <br>  <br>  "The uterus changes position, color, and shape during your cycle and during sexual excitement. During the first half of your cycle, the cervix will feel relatively firm (like touching your nose) and dry to the touch - and the position of the cervix will be low in your vagina (easy to reach). The entrance of the cervix will feel closed.<br>  <br>  As you aproach ovulation, the cervix will become increasingly soft and will increasingly moisten in order to create a more fertile environment for the sperm. The entrance of the cervix will feel open and begin to lift. At the highest point, the cervix may be a bit difficult to reach and the entrance of the cervix will increase in size. The feel of your cervix will be softer - like touching your lip. At this point, you are at your most fertile time.<br>  <br>  Following ovulation, the cervix begins to return to a firmer state and the entrance will begin to close. Also, the position of the cervix will again drop and become easy to reach."<br>  <br>  This is why we experience uncomfortable sex sometimes around ovulation time.  Hope this helps!|`|yp9rEMSraa	I did in December....after BDing I had a really sharp pain in my stomach that I could barely move.....It went away finally and i have not had it since....dont know what it was but yes i have felt it
8259f37f3bb63217d47d975af43b7855aa	Sometimes there isn't any implantation bleeding.  I didn't have it with my son, and I know several others that didn't too.  If you do have implantation bleeding, it can occur 6-12 days after ovulation, and should only last a couple days with cramping.  It should be light pink or brown in color, meaning it's old blood.  So, if you're going to have implantation bleeding, it'll be between the 18th & 24th.  Good Luck!|`|XyRzSzjtaa	coud be around 6 days later
KHhRgzXtaa	if bubs normally moving then u should b fine, if u have no cramps, bleeding, ect, sounds like its all good<br>  i fell at 27 weeks cos i tripped over my 2 year old, i didnt go dr cos i felt fine even though i kinds landed on my tummy, bub still moved heaps<br>  youd have to haVE been kicked or pushed quite hard in the tum to cause injury as i know someone who pretty much got battered round the abdomen while heavily preg and her child is handicapped now , but she said she was bashed in the tummy on purpose by her bitchy sister [this was 30 years ago], some people!!!!|`|iLlEoIiiaa	If you are still feeling the baby move I'm sure your fine but I would call your doctors and get in for an ultrasound just to be safe.|`|giKCTfnfaa	if you are concerned, call your dr.  she/he will probably have you come in and make sure everything is ok.  i'm hoping you pressed charges.<br>  <br>  btw, i checked out your baby names.  my cousin had a baby 6 months ago and named him nolan matthew. he's such a cutie! ..so...that's my personal favorite :)|`|jWmnSXlLaa	You need to go to the doctor and make sure the baby is ok. If it isnt moving go NOW. WTH is wrong with people are you pressing charges on her? You need to who fights a pregnant woman anyhow.. I hope your ok. !!
cEgI5ogLaa	Def. find out what is in her birthplan so you can help make sure everything goes how she wants it, also I would suggest bringing some relaxers (music, magazines, snacks ect) for all 3 of you. Everyone is so stressed out it will be nice to have something to kill time when she is resting (between contractions ect) or if dad gets overstressed he can step aside. Also the snacks because a lot of time the "coach" doesn't think to stop and eat, this can help avoid crankiness later on! Be aware while your there, offer her ice chips ect, make sure the lighting is dimmed when she is resting and people are being quiet so she can get the rest she needs. Offer to take pictures/video for her. Also pay attention to the room temp, she may get really hot or really cold, offer to help take her blankets off or get her more as she needs, bring her a pair of comfy slippers, new slippers were the greatest gift anyone brought me to the hospital (and chapstick!!), both were used a lot and very much appreciated by me.<br>  All these are things my husband and mom were there doing and trying to do for me and were great, you will be great, sounds like you really care and want everything to go good for her, I'm sure it will!<br>  Goood luck, Toni LYnne|`|tivpa7Vlaa	you can ask her now whats her birthing plan so u can ensure her birthing expectations go as planned. be in charge of keeping her lips chap free and cold or warm compress which ever one she gonna need while she is going thru it. my sister took the pictures cause i suspected my hubby would be able to keep up with that task....i guess u can be in charge of that 2.|`|jfTK5Ckjaa	sure i can help you.get the list from doctor what she will be needing at the time of birth...generally nursing homes provide list of items they need from you....pack that in a separate bag which generally includes...baby front open garment,nappy,diaper,baby powder,baby oil,cotton pack sterilised one,towel and one holding cloth.in another bag pack these for your Friend when she will be in labour...Night With petticoat,towel,her personal belongings like tooth brush comb hand towel, napkins,front open nursing bra,nipple cream,pair of socks(if she gets cold while taking labour pain),,,,,for your Friend you should take some warm milk in Thermos in which added some dry fruits powder...so she is not drained when in labour.lots of love and support that you are there with her all the time will land both of you in happier times ahead!....good wishes to both of you dear!|`|kziIf0r6aa	Just try not to take over let hubby do most of the work to make him feel like he is doing something useful even if it is keeping the cold compress wet and cool.  Support is what she wants you there for incase her hubby needs time out.  Offer her a back massage or a cool drink ice chips paw paw cream for her lips or just a shoulder when she's up and about trying to walk thru each contraction.  Good advice pump her ego up tell her what a great job she's doing or keep quiet when she gives you the "look"....lol<br>  Be reassured there isnt much you can do wrong the nurses will be the ones in charge, just keep reminding her what she gets once this is all over and remind her that she's been thru it a few times before and knows that the pain isnt forever.....
7nOkNtw4aa	I don't think it's inappropriate to say that. <br>  Especially if it's your party. <br>  You don't want to be having a great party then have unnecessary drama come up and ruin the whole thing.<br>  Maybe say " Leave your drama at home please" to make it more polite.<br>  <br>  Good Luck.|`|9e6a66fe8592d126c6b207054fb2fa7aaa	No, party fliers can say just about anything.  It's a PARTY, I think that's funny.  I like it.  If they are too sensitive after they read it, it will probably be because they feel guilty of the charges.  Better for you if those people don't come.|`|obzOgcaPaa	NO!!!!!!!!!<br>  Alot of parties I get fliers for say it. Or the person givn them out says it. U dont want anybdi bringn stupid drama & ruinin ya nite. If they think its rude and wont come then they the ones that would bring the drama anyway.|`|AA12383391	if i got a flier like that in the mail, i throw it away right away. its rude and assumes that people will just bring drama there.|`|XrKviWgSaa	yeah just a tad, because no matter what there will be drama anywhere there is a party no matter what.|`|Zq5EzjGeaa	Nah lol<br>  Bold it and put it as the header<br>  how is that rude???<br>  drama is unecessary|`|E7ViD8EWaa	It seems a little rude, yes.<br>  <br>  =]|`|T1q4GWLkaa	It seems like a weird assumption.  Just don't give the invite to the people you don't want to come, case closed.|`|FiUprYsvaa	Yeah, you are assuming they are going to bring drama. <br>  Which shows you don't think they know how to conduct themselves and that they are immature.<br>  They won't like it.|`|Cg4fWi3Baa	With all the gate crashing going on these days it's probably no considered inappropriate.... in saying that I don't think I would invite anyone to a party of mine if I thought for one second they would cause drama or trouble.|`|CdJtH0xdaa	It would seem a bit rude, but I don't know what else in on the flier, so it's a bit difficult to help you.|`|kRaVa0Wraa	it's rude. why would you assume that? if i got  a flier for a party like that i wouldn't go.<br>  psh.
kiAQi91laa	If you're pregnant then it's more than likely your mood swings.  I know I can cry and laugh within one hour of the other.  My husband stated that he gets really nervous because I'm so depressed sometimes and he feels really bad.  I know I don't show emotions swings like this before I was expecting and now I have really have no control over them.
vEBfp8yHaa	It's possible - it could be genetic but it's most likely caused by other stuff.  If there is a history of pre-term labor in your family make sure that you drink a ton of water when you're pregnant, rest as much as possible (don't worry if other people think you're lazy - you have do this for the baby). and stay off your feet as much as possible during the third trimester. Also don't get stressed out - that can cause early labor too - if somebody pisses you off - just walk away - trust me it' better than sitting in the hospital and getting stabbed w/ needles for 2 days!|`|V3ZyGJMtaa	They dont really know why some babies come early and other late.. It might have smething to do with it it might not nobody who tell you one way or the other.. All i can tell you is when you do choice to have a child go to the doctor as you are suppost to and do as you are told. My son was 3 weeks early and there was nothing wronge. He was the first baby in our family (both sides) that has been early.|`|TVx4iWlGaa	Im not sure if it matters or not. When ever I had questions like this about my pregnancies the doctors always asked if my mother, grandmother, sister had the same experiences. You should ask the doctor. thats an interesting question|`|aXm6wS8paa	if ur stressed etc some times<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  good luck<br>  <br>  my nephew was suppose to be born on christmas instead he was born in the 1st of December<br>  idk if my sis was stressed <br>  good luck again :)|`|c23e2e9ba321447351d3dc720a353187aa	It depedns on WHY she had early labors but usually, no, it won't affect how your carry.<br>  I had my first at 38 weeks and my best fried just had her first at 36 weeks.  Actually we were both a day shy of those milestones.  It happens, not a biggie as long as the baby is healthy.|`|vsFJZRkGaa	any baby could be born early - but it's more likely if it runs in the family.<br>  <br>  So yes, i'd say you've got a good chance of an early delivery. <br>  <br>  My mum and all my aunts had their children right on time, and i had my first 3weeks early. So you just can't tell.
WWcaKZ7Qaa	Yes, actually they do. I have a picture from a 3D ultrasound I had where the baby is yawning. It's pretty cute. There's also one where she is sucking her thumb, and one where she is sticking her tongue out. It's pretty amazing what they can do in there. :]<br>  <br>  Edit: They are yawning and taking in amniotic fluid just like they practice breathing with that.|`|tivpa7Vlaa	yep i even seen on a 3D that a baby had the expression of crying...i believe most of these faces are reflexes cause what reason would the baby be smiling in the womb? lol|`|xeS8pUfbaa	yes, i have a video of my little girl yawning and sucking her thumb at our 20 week ultrasound. youtube it|`|pkZBBvlzaa	interesting question. didn't know they yamned.|`|duinadV4aa	yes|`|TVx4iWlGaa	If yawning is something you do to get more oxygen to your brain and babies in the womb done breathe on their own, then why would they yawn? Just a question to answer your question. It doesnt make sense to me.|`|eKOgRHa6aa	They may make a face that appears to be a yawn but they wouldn't technically yawn because there's no air|`|4hSqT6i0aa	yes of course, unless they dont have complete human appearance to be able to see it.|`|kpnSKV6Eaa	yawn and hiccup and smile.. if you get a 3d ultrasound you might be able to see these.its so cute|`|7geLpG6Oaa	yes! I have seen both my kids do it on an ultrasound. My daughter was always sleepy.|`|9THRCVtOaa	of coarse!|`|LKIhUMCgaa	kind of. they make a face like they do, but not actually yawning bc there is no air for them to inhale. they move their mouth to learn the movements.
kziIf0r6aa	It hurts like no other pain.... almost undescribable nothing seems to ease the pain no matter how many hot showers or heat packs or massages you get its just all the pressure pushing against your spine.  Sometimes it can go from back to front labour which helps but if you are going to have back labour it will be constant and will eventually feel like its your whole back that is in pain.  Sorry to be blunt but there isnt any point skirting around the issue Id much rather of been told up front exactly what the expect than to go into labour thinking that having a baby was like baking a cake, at the end of it all tho you will say like majority of us "Id do that all over again".... Nothing beats the feeling of holding a little baby you created in your arms no matter how crappy you think you feel.|`|lV3Hk7M1aa	My cousin went through back labor two days ago. She was in so much pain and it was not progressing that she had to have a c-section. Its extreme, constant pain, and you carry all of the labor pain in your back.|`|giKCTfnfaa	quite honestly..it's pure hell.  the pain doesn't seem to quit. there is no position that's comfortable or provides any kind of relief.  i don't trust epidurals (long story), however, i almost broke down and got an epidural with my second child.  i was miserable.|`|8d76f8b8e5f5db785811fc316c86ca44aa	I'm sorry....but it was the worst pain I have ever had.  It was excruciating constantly and then it was just unbearable occasionally.  I hope you never have to experience it.  But just to let you know...you do forget once you have your beautiful baby.
ybexjS2Paa	I did, I actually got a few bags of it as a sample at the clinic where I gave the birth, but my midwife also recommended it. Not a cheap thing though. It did help me, at some point I felt like my breasts are gonna burst they were so full of milk. Eventually I had to stop drinking it.|`|prqrQcd1aa	I've not tried to take anything but fenugreek. It helps to increase the amount of fluids that you are drinking a day, and it also helps to use an electric pump if you aren't already.
WWcaKZ7Qaa	Well if you missed your period you could be pregnant, assuming you had sex. Why don't you just take a test and find out? You would likely get an accurate result by now. Your symptoms could be pregnancy, but there's no way of knowing without testing. Good luck.|`|kaqPSgTVaa	Visit your doctor or take a pregnancy test.|`|Qd0sFMdHaa	you are getting sick because you are stressed out over not knowing whether you are pregnant or not. nerves can do that to people; constipate you, make you nauseous, give you headaches, mood swings, all the things you mentioned. pregnancy can cause it too. so take a test already and find out for sure. it's been long enough; ept or first response are good brands of home pregnancy tests.
bbe253b8bd16b56edbb017e1a281d44eaa	Get a blood test they are 100% accurate.Most women only spot if they do bleed during pregnancy.You could be stressing out about being pregnant messing up your period. Good luck~|`|kaqPSgTVaa	You should see your doctor. Even if you are pregnant you need to see your doctor about the bleeding because that's usually a sign of something being wrong.|`|t8HPCzrOaa	something with me hun but it could be my period am not sure but i did have sex around my ovulation date i think well i think you should go see the doctor okk good luck|`|2yusiREnaa	Well maybe because your asking so many COULD I BE PREGNANT questions your thinking you are because people are saying possible! and then symptoms could be comming bc your thinking of them tooo much PMS and pregnancy symptoms are pretty muc The same! <br>  <br>  Yes you can be and yes you can have a period i did im 4 weeks and 2 days. i had a 6 day period.  <br>  <br>  But relax Dont think about it hard i know and test once a week for a month and if you still think you are go to the doctor!|`|ybexjS2Paa	I had a light spotting in the first and third month of my pregnancy and everything was ok but I went to the doctors as soon as I saw the blood. I think you should too because if you are pregnant any bleeding or spotting could be dangerous and should be consulted with a doctor.|`|tZ1XPd1paa	I bled at 7 weeks. But it was light light pink and I only saw it on the toilet paper. Are u late? If so and your getting negatives, go to the dr. I had many negatives after I missed my period, but I was pregnant :]
dcWN4v6Jaa	Oh that is a hard one. I know what it is (duh). Well, tell him that he isn't old enough to know yet. And if he says "No". Then tell him that ''Fine, I'll tell you. Babies come from god". God sends them down into your mom's tummy." That is a good lie. Then when he is 14 then he will know.|`|OMcIR0gYaa	just tell him to ask his mom and tell his mom that hes asking those questions. its up to the parents to tell him something and what to tell him|`|ERTWwBieaa	Don't tell him the truth daaaaa.<br>  Ok so tell him  an angle comes down from the sky with the baby and leaves it in a mothers lap. He's a kid and kids are dum he will believe it.<br>  And if he dosen't that means he knows how babies come and he just is bugging u.|`|TlFnIei0aa	Tell him you dont know, then if he really wants to know he will ask his mum, and it's up 2 her if she wants him 2 know or not|`|8c766083ad434c1d839541a412dcec60aa	Try this one----"Your mother brought you home from the hospital".  <br>  <br>  It's her responsibility to discuss stuff of that nature not yours.|`|2kIoIhqyaa	Say it flat, but use animals as an example. Just dont freak out the poor kid.
vygYFdsSaa	What does it feel like when your ovary tightens?? I'm just curious I've never experienced that. Take a test tomorrow morning (first morning urine is most concentrated in hCG). The bloating can be caused by any number of things.|`|kaqPSgTVaa	Take another test...The pregnancy hormone doubles every 48-72 hours. IF it was a faint positive you'd get a positive again for sure now. Just take another test.|`|AA10949869	Take another test. HCG hormones double every 2 days or so. If the first test was really a positive you will definitely get a positive now. No need to wait another week hun. Go test! GOOD LUCK!|`|Uoukx6Pdaa	yes I would say you are prego there is no such thing as a false positive
rDw9N09iaa	it depends on how far along you are. you actually have braxton hicks contractions throughout your whole pregnancy, but normally you dont begin to feel them until your third trimester. for example im 31 weeks and i have been having them for the past two weeks. my doctors dont expect me to have my baby for another 9 weeks!! good luck and congrats on the baby|`|BsDv3k5iaa	How close are you to your due date?  Braxton hicks don't give you an idea on when the baby is coming.  I never had them with my daughter.  If you are close to your due date you might want to time contractions and talk to you dr!|`|5MBdJK4Baa	i started having braxton hicks at about 20 weeks..|`|WZQKevt8aa	Not necessarily. I started getting braxton hicks from 24 weeks when I was pregnant with my son (now 2), and I didn't have him until I was nearly 42 weeks and they had to induce me.
xUNowEfQaa	The Womanly Art of Breastfeeding is a good book, as is So That's What They're For.<br>  <br>  Teach grandma about counting diapers--that's how to know if baby is getting enough.  Also if baby conistently gains weight obviously she's getting enough.<br>  <br>  Invite her to attend La Leche League and/or breastfeeding classes with you.|`|qHwI9ev8aa	Good luck with that. My experience with my grandmother is that no matter what you use to try to educate her she will not change her mind. You can give her the book "The Womanly Art of Breasfeeding" but don't be disappointed if she still disagrees. <br>  <br>  You're the mom, you do what you think is best for your baby. This is likely the first of unwanted parenting advice you will receive in your lifetime, learn to laugh it off!|`|uMIvRRjoaa	If you're really set on it you can get some of the books mentioned or check out the LLL, kellymom, and askdrsears site. BUT I would caution you on this. If you justify your decisions to her this way she may expect you to do so for ANYTHING she finds "weird" or "objectionable". Do you really want to spend your time doing that? Tell her you've read up on it. you know how to reach professionals for help if needed, and most importantly, YOU are the parents and don't like the implications that you would harm your baby. "Thanks we've got this covered" is a good response to her doubts/inquiries/demands.|`|5ItOGyVHaa	there is a lactation consultant at the hospital and she has bunches of information that you can use. flyers, books. and free samples are always good (since you are there)<br>  <br>  i am really surprised that G-ma is trying to talk you out of it. usually that is something younger people try to do. <br>  <br>  if this is 2nd baby then just remind g-ma how great #1 baby is
AA10984198	Australia is a pretty family friendly place, even for budget travelling. You have several options. One is to hire a car and a caravan (large camper vans are less common in Australia).<br>  <br>  The car/caravan option is better because many locations you will need to drive around the local area.<br>  <br>  I would recommend that for 6 months you try they buy/sell trick. You buy a caravan for the 6 months and sell it at the end.  try www.tradingpost.com.au or www.ebay.com.au<br>  <br>  An alternative option is that most caravan parks have onsite vans and cabins, with some locations heading up into the luxury range. <br>  <br>  With Australia's long holidays (4 weeks standard) many families traditionally took long summer holidays and so pretty much everywhere is dotted with such locations.<br>  <br>  This means you can stay in motels, cabins and vans in a range of different locations.
NaJPIOheaa	there is a chance to have ewcm and not ovulate. before ovulation your body produces estrogen, and when you have the surge your body gets ready for ovulation and secretes LH, which in return produces all ovulation signs, ewcm, and even a positive OPK. but sometimes there is not enough hormones(progesterone, estrogen) to actually pop the egg out, hence you would not of actually ovulated. since you noticed this CM right before intercourse, it could be your bodys own lubricant from being aroused. we cant really tell you for sure so i'd be BDing anyways! good luck xo
XrKviWgSaa	first off men are stupid and do not know when a hint is being given, just be like hey i wanna go somewhere to night but have no one to go with do you wanna go to the mall or movies or something.|`|pYEdlL75aa	my opinion is bring up something like "I wanna go see a movie tonight but cant go alone" or something like that and then let him put 2 and 2 together.|`|sMuMfuAgaa	Maybe have one of your really good friends let him know otherwise I think it might be a while before you get what you want.|`|lMHy05Lmaa	How i got my last bf is i just talked 2 him a lot on the phone and myspace and things like that so if u want him 2 like u just talk get 2 know him better|`|bwKZ8MWWaa	men don't take subtle hints, we are kind of dense.  If you want something, go get it
lb8FBhWnaa	Lucky! take advantage of it! I wish my mom would want to constantly buy me clothes!|`|P5Iq6nufaa	I am not an expert on how girls should dress, but I do have a teen daughter and it's appreciated when she dresses up for certain events. My thought on this is that your mom needs to respect you as an individual and not force you to be someone you are not. On the other hand, maybe you can give her one day a week where you can dress up like a "girly" girl for her (perhaps you go to church on Sunday...that would be a perfect time if so). In addition, trips to a grandparents home or another relative or when your parents are hosting guests are times you should indulge your mom and dress up.<br>  <br>  Your mom punishing you for your individuality would be wrong, but I wonder if that's the whole story. Is it?|`|PoSgTKfEaa	Tell her that you don't want to be something you're not. You can't make her do things she doesn't want to do and if the things she wants you to do don't make you happy then don't do them.|`|1F0nKNpIaa	Tell your mom that you want to be a tomboy and accept as the way you are|`|8q3SKzgUaa	You can tell her that you're an individual with your own likes and dislikes. There's nothing wrong with choosing your style and it's fine if not every girl would want to wear make-up or dresses, just like you. She wouldn't like being forced to wear something she hates, would she?<br>  <br>  Aside from that, you can ask her why she wants to do these things. It's best that you understand how she feels so that you both understand each other. Maybe she's going through some midlife crisis or something.|`|a690350ec67921d073511d8377b69a12aa	sit down and talk to your mum..it wil help. also, make her read these answers. however, sometimes do listen to her and wear a dress on any occasion and make her happy. there has to be a compromise from your side at first. Your mum wil eventually understand..<br>  Good luck!|`|IqcQ7pnfaa	Tell her that she has to accept the truth about your 'identity' and it's about time that she open her eyes to reality and not be blinded by her own fantasies. The truth hurts, reality bites- that's nowhere near fantasies.|`|788IKdCSaa	Have you tried talking to her? Telling her that what she likes isn't always want you want, And that punishing you won't change what you really are, and really like on the inside. Try asking her why she dresses you up all the time.|`|QSodlfMraa	buy her a life size dress up doll of you? :)|`|FZQ2KHDvaa	Don't try to convince her.  You will like dresses, skirts, blouses, etc.; one day.  When that day comes, you will probably want to get rid of your skateboard.
32fa7268fd210c30ef24617cf0e76c6baa	I like Leah,but I dont like Shawn,sorry..|`|6yD5k9Azaa	it's adorable :]|`|61NKzPzMaa	Shawn is a masculine BOYS name. Awful for a girl. There is nothing feminine girly or unisex about the masculine BOYS name Shawn.<br>  <br>  Leah is nice. <br>  <br>  Look for another GIRLS middle name.|`|iy8C03vaaa	lol that is so funny cuz my name is Leah and my boyfriends name is shaun...so i love that name  :)|`|UbCzA2JVaa	I love Leah, but not so much Shawn.<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  :)|`|oMDB0oipaa	It has a nice ring to it. I like the spelling too|`|MklhprnLaa	I like the name Leah but when I say "Leah Shawn" I think it sounds like "Leash On".  So with the last name tacked on the end of there it becomes actually pretty comical.  Unless you pronounce Leah differently (I've heard that spelling pronounced as both Lee and Lee-Ah).|`|JvBGKmpyaa	Leah I love, Shawn is pretty awful for a girl.<br>  <br>  How about....<br>  <br>  Leah Grace<br>  Leah Rose<br>  Leah Ellyse<br>  Leah Jane<br>  Leah Ann<br>  Leah Louise|`|aYVJTSCWaa	I honestly don't care for it.  Sorry.<br>  <br>  It's the shawn part....reminds me of Lafawnda from Napolean Dynamite.|`|xsT9YJP9aa	I really like the name Leah, but Shawn is more of a boys name to me!!

I actually named my daughter Leah!.. good taste :)|`|8rTHANk5aa	ooh i love leah!!<br>  Leah Belle?|`|6lBWoKrgaa	i like Leah, not Shawn.|`|n7ykcFz5aa	awh i think its a cute name!<br>  btw if you want more ideas you could try going on <a href="http://www.babynames.com/" rel="nofollow">http://www.babynames.com/</a> they have some ideas on there
32fa7268fd210c30ef24617cf0e76c6baa	Audrey Mae is a beautiful Name,and I like it a lot..|`|VmSKQ40Caa	I personally, do not like the name Audrey. It reminds me of an obese, unattractive female who went to my middle school. Mae is okay but kind of boring and one syllable names are odd in the obvious reason<br>  (not trying to be rude, just giving an honest opinion).|`|UbCzA2JVaa	It sounds really nice. It flows really well. I personally like Aubrey better, but Audrey is still nice!<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  :)|`|B7nqTcttaa	It's a little bit hill billy for my taste|`|H9Nvo2gxaa	I like it! :D|`|v5fEfmO8aa	I Love It!!|`|oAcJPS98aa	I like Audrey or Aubrey.  The name Mae seems to old.  <br>  <br>  All of a sudden, I'm thinking Noel, Neveah, Maya, or Madison.<br>  <br>  You stick with your name.  It will be a cute name for a cute baby!|`|80piiicYaa	2 part names are stupid, its like the parents coldnt decide so they give ya both, either Audrey or may|`|tnRO5gB8aa	I like Audrey but not Audrey Mae, though it flows well<br>  I like Aubry better. it's not a terrible name|`|zdWDkadraa	Cute, but strong and feminine. I like it =)|`|6lBWoKrgaa	i actually like it|`|HvX6KvK1aa	not really. i prefer alyssa marie|`|U2w775zZaa	What a great choice. Its beautiful both stunning names and i love it :)|`|jOj0Dlncaa	really cute,i like it very much|`|7nOkNtw4aa	I really like it.<br>  I think it flows really nicely.<br>  Audrey is an older name that you don't see a lot any more, so it makes it even more beautiful.<br>  <br>  Good Luck.|`|DKee9eSlaa	i say that it goes well together and i say its best to think about when the baby gets older the name cant be made fun of and this is a preety name<br>  so no one can make fun of it|`|EShqVoDDaa	Awesome!! Audrey H. is my fav actress<br>  <br>  If your naming something, I always wanted someone to name their pet/kid Elliot. It sounds spunky. :D <br>  AND IF IT'S A DOG: EGGROLL or ROWDY would be cool.|`|xsT9YJP9aa	Like Audrey ok, but definitely do not like Mae|`|XIykYrCnaa	i ,like it.
EmhBDHMtaa	i do not like it...i like unusual names but that is just out there. true is okay but the first name is just awful|`|b328a9d35b4d38f11fb5ea37fe0b727aaa	It is horrible. Poor kid.|`|B7nqTcttaa	Yuck!|`|4863f8dd77952e57a9c03006243c12c6aa	RIDICULOUS.

If she is gonna live in the city then its fine. i live in the city and names like that are really common. my best friends name is daniqwa lol..but if she's gonna live outside the city i suggest you dnt name her that. she'll end up getting teased bacause nobody has names like that and she'll stand out|`|bbe253b8bd16b56edbb017e1a281d44eaa	I feel sorry for the child!Anyone that hears this name would know the child is automatically black(not rascist just hate names that are so stereotypical).Why make up a whole new name when there are several names already out there lol~|`|DKee9eSlaa	i think that when this baby gets older people are gonna make fun of her or him and the mom will regret it like how bout something  in english!<br>  this name is so not true|`|7PRPZeBwaa	That's the ******* dumbest name I have heard in a while.<br>  <br>  You should tell that blackula to break the stereotype for once.|`|elk3AnNXaa	im not racist or sh*t.<br>  but thats sucha black name.<br>  holy god!
yZS9M0Ctaa	wtf. obviously 80 percent of these people didnt even read your question correctly. of course you could be. research it. you can get pregnant ANY day of the month. now. if you had had sex and missed your period maybe like a week later. that would be different. but the next day, no. it wouldnt make a difference. RESEARCH IT. because your getting incorrect info on here.|`|wzM5WB8Xaa	You might be. Although the average female ovulates around the middle of her cycle, there are exceptions. I was one of them. When my husband and I were trying to get pregnant, after trying for 3 months, we decided to try while I had my period, and I got pregnant. If you're not sure, wait to see if you get your next period. If you don', then take a test.|`|kaqPSgTVaa	No, not likely. You would have ovulated 2 weeks prior to that.|`|3zxVzPBxaa	very, very unlikely.. it is possible however, because the egg might not have attached to the lining yet.<br>  <br>  a lot of women will bleed when they are pregnant because of the baby growing ext. and mistake it for a period, when in actuality it is not possible to have a period while you are pregnant|`|t8HPCzrOaa	no hun cuz its close to your period i had sex on jan 20 and got my period jan 24 and i turned out not pregnant but after i did have sex again during ovulation after jan 24 in feb to get pregnant but yea i didnt get pregnant cause you ovulated alreadyy ttc alsoo good luck|`|dwvVg4A3aa	Not likely, if you have a normal 28 day cycle, you generally ovulate mid cycle. which would be day 14, day 1 being the first day of your last menstral period.|`|iEXAhnAQaa	YES its possible. these people are silly. you can get pregnant ON your period.|`|28hc0D0laa	well if your on your period you definitely arent pregnant that means your body is slothing off the layer of your uterus meant to help protect and nourish the fertilized egg...soo if your body is slothing it off that means there isnt a fertilized egg...no baby im very very sorry..try again|`|PmOc9qdDaa	it's possible that you could be pregnant because when i was first pregnant i still got my normal period for two months. so you might want to wait a week or so and take a test or go to the doctors.<br>  good luck|`|lj3hNR9baa	While it is possible, it is very unlikely. Sperm usually reach the egg within a few hours.<br>  But hey, keep trying.|`|uLlwcUbsaa	Hopefully your both responsible adults and not two teens.|`|eVZIqtgPaa	possible.. consult a doctor.. that would be better..|`|9QKu9ynxaa	yayyyy the 16th is my birthday

Cx5Zo7IIaa	Congratulations! You are becoming a woman. You should buy some pads and celebrate. You should stop soon in a day or two. You also should buy a small calender book to record your periods in, so you will know when they are suppose to come that way you won't be surprised. This recording of your periods can also be helpful much later when you are trying to have a baby / preventing one because then you will be able to track your fertile days. A lot of the times when you go to the doctor they will ask you about your last cycle and some women don't know when it was so keeping a record will also be helpful then.|`|X67Y1BACaa	It's your period. It usually lasts for about 7 days. You need to tell your mom, and wear pads, not panty liners.|`|iTi26ojQaa	Its your period.

Ask your mom.|`|qnOiHSgKaa	Aw you got your period.<br>  Don't worry about it unless it hurts down there--normally you would just get cramps.<br>  Don't be too embarassed to tell your mom because she's probably expecting it around this time, and mom's have that instinct, trust me, she'll figure somethings up, not to mention she'd probably end up finding your bloodstained laundry.<br>  When you tell her she'll probably take you to the drugstore to buy some pads or tampons and you'll be much happier.<br>  It'll probably last up to a week.<br>  Good Luck :]|`|FiUprYsvaa	That is your period. <br>  Go tell your mom and ask her to take you to the store. <br>  <br>  Grab a box of Tampaxs Pearl tampons and always maxis. tampons during the day and pads at night. <br>  <br>  Pads are so gross during the day. You are just always covered in blood and it is soo messy. <br>  <br>  The first few days of your period you should change tampons every 1-2 hours. The last few days every 4-5 hours. Or as needed. <br>  <br>  They are sooo convient and make life sooo much easier. <br>  Its like the best thing invented.|`|svdZrJfbaa	This is def. your period. When I first got mine I was as confused as you are. Most periods end in 5 days some a few days longer. It's nothing to be worried about. It will end soon, probably tomorrow or the next day.

fNv2Re6baa	Try giving her rusks or teething biscuits. Even milk arrowroot's will do the trick. If she has something chew on, it will take her attention away.

If not then put it within reach and when she grabs something again repeat yourself.<br>  <br>  Eventually she will get it. This is a phase all kids go through and don't necessarily get out of for awhile.

Carlin said that Cameron is a goofy name.|`|NssTULHfaa	I prefer Cameron Lee but both are nice. You have good taste.|`|eUbLPI4Baa	I love Cameron Lee|`|roytWpP9aa	Cameron Lee For sure
n6XYYyoLaa	i would contact playtex; i would imagine you have the reg ventaire, bc i have the ventaire advanced and they were used daily for 8 mos and still look new! they should replace them with something that is going to work better for you....gl<br>  if you got them at babies r us or somewhere else that has more than a 30 day return policy i would simply return them as defective....|`|6AvVVzsnaa	Try getting the bottles with the measurements aren't in ink like the Dr. Browns bottles for example. I feel you on this one because I had the ventaire and every time I washed them, the print disappears.|`|dRKGXQmeaa	Try getting some clear, sticky tape (like packing tape) and stick it on there good, using something flat to press the bubbles out. Write with your sharpie onto the tape, then stick and press another piece of tape over top of it.|`|HqOkC2YHaa	I feel for you on this one...I have 7 of these bottles and now have resorted to a measuring cup to get the right amount of water because all of them have lost their writing!<br>  <br>  and yes this is also a problem with the new ones
nrqWwQBXaa	i would go get the kid and when the parents got home talk to them see what they say if they act like it was no big deal i would call cps?|`|aLAmvX5Naa	In this day and age you pretty much have to call the police. 10 years ago you could give neighbor kids a drink of water and let them play on your porch till the parents were found, now doing something like that makes you look like a pedophile no matter your intentions, especially if you are male.<br>  <br>  What really bothers me is why did "they" go to the store? If there was more than one adult surely one adult could have stayed home with the child while the other went shopping.|`|LKIhUMCgaa	well first of all, u weren't the one who called CPS, the cops did. u only called the cops, which was the right thing to do, wut if something happened to that boy? wut if he was hurt, how were u to know that the parents were bout to come back. i don't understand why one of the parents can't just stay home to watch the kid. that's ridiculous! i'd understand if the kid was like 8, but not 5!|`|AA11371251	Ya I would've they should never have left him like that|`|aqto0hJTaa	yes|`|q2AsDnjpaa	yes without hesitation.<br>  Unless I was friends with my neighbours and knew them well. I would call them first to see why they have left their child unattended.|`|yXx1nB0Qaa	Yes, whats next at 6 they go out to the club after he goes to sleep?|`|AA12174100	you definitely did the right thing. You'd have felt real bad had something happened to the child. I leave my 9 year old for 15-20 minutes to go to the store which is across the street but he is wide awake and knows where I am.  And he knows how to reach me on my cell phone.But never if he is sleeping.|`|TiaoTFecaa	Yes|`|mx3YK5rLaa	Yeah, I would have.|`|prqrQcd1aa	My god yes.. that poor child. Why didn't one of his parents stay there with him? I seriously doubt for some reason that they were simply getting something to eat alone... honestly if you are that irresponsible as parents then you don't deserve your children!|`|OI3bf4yjaa	I think you made the right decision. I would have called the police also. Any parent who leaves a 5 year old at home alone, are clearly NOT responsible. You did the right thing.|`|xssqrr7Yaa	It shows irresponsibility on the parents part.  Why did the two of them have to go to the store?  You did the right thing. <br>  <br>   We had the same thing happen to us.  I was working and my husband asked the neighbor in the next apartment to watch our baby in the crib while he came to pick me up from work late at night.  When we got there, the police were there, because the door was left open to our apartment and someone reported our baby was left alone when our door was open. Our neighbor figured if the baby was asleep, he would keep the door open to hear him if he cried.  We almost had our son taken away from us and we had to have the neighbor report what had happened.|`|CkIeCNS4aa	Yes, absolutely.  A 5 year old cannot understand where or why his parents have "gone to get dinner" nor can he take care of himself.|`|5P3spnOWaa	Wow that's a tough question...truth is though, it depends on the situation.  I mean, if I knew the parents were normally responsible and took good care of the kid, then I would probably just wait until they got home.  When they finally got back I would warn them and say that if it ever happened again that I would then have to call the cops.  However, if I knew that the parents acted like this regularly, then I probably would've done the same thing you did and called the cops to begin with.<br>  <br>  Hope that helped!! :)|`|IpzapGwgaa	YES!!!!! I call the police when there is a dog running down the street, are you kidding me, OF COURSE!!!!!!!|`|CWgVyAM4aa	I would definitely call the police! I mean really the kids parents are irresponsible and they even admit to it, they obviously aren't ready to raise a kid. That's just ridiculous. You did the right thing, I would do it to. It may be a sad ending but you know what , he'll most likely be in a better/more caring environment now than with people who obviously don't care!|`|VuUz8NgKaa	I would have called the police.|`|lTUXdbCTaa	Of course I would! That is terrible! My dad told me about this one time when a family was going on vacation and was leaving their baby with a babysitter. The babysitter was running late and the family was going to miss their flight, so the babysitter told them to go ahead, that she was 5 minutes away. Turns out she got in an accident and was killed on her way. No one knew where she was headed. So the baby, who was left alone in a highchair, died. I think that's the saddest thing ever!|`|zHBDriInaa	well i might have called the police, depending on how bad the situation was, but first i would have a talk with the guardians of the kid and if the situation kept on going on i would have no choice but to call the police, so yea it was good that you called the police but you should have had a talk with the family first.|`|078bdda067d82a0dc6b47d9639e39c3faa	Yes. I'd definitely do something. It's illegal. Poor kid =[|`|Wt3t6rUPaa	Absolutely.  If I thought a child was in danger i would have done exactly the same thing.  What the parents did was neglectful and a little cruel.  Maybe they thought he wouldn't wake up while they were gone. But that is not an excuse.  Anything could have happened while they were away.  He is 5 years old!!!!!  What were they thinking?  Were there 2 parents there...why couldn't one stay home?  <br>  Anyway...don't feel bad.  You did the right thing.  <br>  Your actions could have given them the wake up call they need.|`|ki5hZbcTaa	yes I would. A five year old should not be left alone.|`|2aJ7gHQgaa	I think you did the right thing.  Don't feel bad.  It seems strange to me that there were 2 parents, and it didn't occur to them that maybe one person should stay home with the sleeping child while the other one goes out to get dinner.  They had a choice, and they chose poorly.  Maybe your call to the police will make them think about it next time.|`|Zdvx8uBcaa	Umm....who wouldn't?|`|VsaEOX9vaa	Yes, they don't deserve to have a child and hopefully they'll never get him back, poor little thing.<br>  <br>  I'm convinced that people should have to qualify for a licence to be able to have kids.|`|rHMQs5cSaa	oh yea|`|AA12000585	in a heart beat with a wink to the child|`|46StihsPaa	YAH!!!!<br>  <br>  Who would leave their kid at home ALONE? He's only 5! You don't even know how many times they've done it.|`|kkM8vFfKaa	Yes I would. Sadly, sometimes child services are involved when there's no need. When I was little my dad called child services on my mom because he was upset he didn't get custody of us kids. He pretty much lied to them about the way my mom treated us. We always had my older sister (who was 7 years older) to watch us, since she was 13 and older. Child services were involved in our lives when there was no need for it, my mother treated us fine.<br>  <br>  But it's times like these that the police need to be called.<br>  Don't feel bad for what you did. It wasn't right for the parents to leave such a young child home alone. My niece will be 5 in August and I could NEVER imagine leaving her alone in a house.|`|wUVUXHZtaa	You did the right thing. I probably would have done the same too, since I doubt the child would have opened the door for me. And don't feel bad about CPS getting involved, it's not like he is going to be taken forever. The parents shouldn't have left their child home alone at all, I doubt they went to the store, and if they did, then the child should have been taken with them. You were doing what you thought was right, and that's all the matters|`|wX46Gv4naa	Yes, anything could have happened to the poor boy|`|gmXGNP0Taa	I would definitely call the police!<br>  <br>  How can someone leave a 5 year old all alone!!|`|xw0APfuraa	no doubt... i am the mother of 5 and cannot fathom leaving the kids by themselves you definitely did the right thing|`|M21c8MQ9aa	No, I would not. If they leave a 5 year old when he's sleeping, good parents will know not to be gone any longer than they have to be. The thing is, if you ever notice them leaving their child home by himself when he's awake, or if they repeatedly leave him home while he's sleeping, then it's time to take action|`|2xg9TpEZaa	Yes! That is crazy!!!! One of the parents should have stayed home!!! What are they thinking??? Poor baby shouldn't have to live his life in foster care... Why are some parents so stupid and careless?|`|AA12290212	Yes! you did the right thing. The child was obviously distressed about being left alone. Imagine how scared he must have been to wake up and find his parents not home. You absolutley did the right thing. If you had not called the cops and the situation was more serious than turned out to be, you would have regretted not stepping in.<br>  <br>  Its better to be safe than sorry!|`|DjAKQrtraa	I would have called the police, but for them to remove the child is pretty extreme, costly, and ultimately unnecessary. The parents needed to be scared into taking their responsibilities seriously, and I think the police just showing up would have done that. Their taking of the child was overkill.|`|i0y3CYoHaa	Well, YEAH, if he was shouting for help, that's the only thing you should have done. Good job.|`|AA11524181	Yes|`|OK3UMa28aa	It would be a hard decision to make but what is important to keep in mind is your ethics...and if I was put in the situation I wouldnt hesitate to call the police....maybe it was all for the better that he was taken away...But I think you did the right thing|`|4DAL6Vytaa	Absolutely. That is negligent parenting and shouldn't be tolerated. I'm 19 years old and a guy and I have more common sense than that. The nerve of parents these days astounds me. You did the right thing. Kudos for having the courage to do something that bold!|`|wz9FN3ybaa	Poor kid - why did it take the two of them to go to the shops?  Couldn't one parent have stayed at home to watch the kid?  Dingbats.|`|HJ3Wx1UXaa	Of course I would do that! I would be afraid of the boy's safety because these parents were obviously irresponsible. They didn't even have a good excuse and didn't even feel bad. You definitley did the right thing.|`|TiunEkVVaa	Um ya!!!! You can't leave a little boy home alone, something could happen, a fire, break-in, etc. You made the right decision :)|`|sy40JGgTaa	it depends if they treated the kid well.<br>  i mean i would just look after him until his parents came and let them off with a warning or something.<br>  your neighbors must really dislike you now.|`|6sJhoXAAaa	First, I probably would have thought the parents were in the shower or back yard thinking their child was safe in his bed, especially if nothing like this ever happened before.  I would not have called the police unless the parents remained missing much longer. I would be calming the child like a good neighbor.<br>  <br>  I would have given the parents heck when I found out the truth, but I would give them another chance before allowing a child to go into the system at age 5.<br>  <br>  Maybe that's because I grew up in a neighborhood where everybody on the block watched out for everybody elses kids, and everybody knew everybody.  Or maybe that's because I saw someone's kids taken because she had to leave for work 5 minutes before her sitter arrived.|`|pZGVI9dPaa	I would have. You just don't leave a five year old alone, something really horrible could have happened to him. Do not feel guilty!  You did the right thing to protect this child.|`|1oVOyDUUaa	5 years old home alone. You did the right thing. If the house caught on fire or a  scumbag thief came in what would a 5 year old do?good decision.|`|xrEIAD2aaa	Yes,  what if something had happened while they were gone.  A fire, the child could have hurt himself, someone could have kidnapped him.  Anything could have happened. It was just the store this time, what about all the other times they weren't caught?  He was only 5 years old.  I can't even imaging leaving my seven year old at home.  I'm sure it makes it hard living next to them, but you did the right thing.  If it wasn't a big deal the police wouldn't have come. One of them could have went to the store alone to pick up dinner anyway.  There's no excuse.|`|STLYxP39aa	You did the right thing. Somebody that young shouldn't be left unattended. The parents should have got into legal trouble.|`|btgxidCUaa	i definitely would! the little boy could have seriously hurt himself being home alone like that. i think you did the right thing. good for you =)
kQMt51iraa	As per my Doc its 20mm after which the follicle must release egg to get fertilised. <br>  No, its not for sure that your right ovary is having some problem. Its further for more two three cycles your right ovary wont show any follicles only then you should consult your doctor. <br>  Generally ladies with normal cycle release one egg follicle at time from either of the ovaries. It doesn't mean their other ovary is having some problem. <br>  <br>  Don't worry just relax. Let them grow further.|`|tSKBsbIyaa	Are you trying to say that, your follicle test showed f1 and f2 on left side? If so you should visit your Doc, as this could be PCOS, which is normal in many women. Which shows heavy growth of follicles at a time.<br>  About keep ing intercourse, is generally, size of 14mm + indicates ovulation within a day or two. Although it depends upon invidual too.<br>  All the best.
Rk87mqkoaa	If you want a big family, like more than 10 kids, you won't be able to pay attention to all of them but you should start giving birth at 15-16yo to have some time between one and another. You should have as many children as you can afford and can take care of. Do you feel having 10 kids or more is a good idea for the kids? I suggest you hae 3 kids - you will feel the big family, trust me. Start when you want.|`|LKIhUMCgaa	omg, i have a feeling we'll have another "mother of octuplets" on our hands asking for donations and living off of welfare and in her mother's house soon. lol|`|rSWX0CZ7aa	I'm 17 too and I can't imagine having the responsibility of raising two kids at this point in my life.  I mean, there would be absolutely no way I could focus on school and spend time with my friends!  I can't imagine having to juggle school and take care of two kids at the same time.  Don't have a baby just because they are cute.  They are a huge responsibility. You need to start having them when you're mature enough to take care of them and are able to support them financially, which no one is able to do while they're still in high school.  So I really don't suggest you have a baby right now.  It will change your life completely, and not necessarily for the better.  Get through high school and college first, and then you can settle down with the perfect man and start a family!|`|2Hot9EJiaa	Your friend is very misguided.  She already has these 2 precious children, so I pray that she is able to care for them.  She had her first baby at 15- OF COURSE IT IS TOO SOON TO HAVE A BABY. 15 is too soon to be having sex too. I believe that sex and babies is for those that are married. She wants 15 kids? Not another Oct-a-mom?  Please don't have a baby, just because they are cute. Cute can get very old, when you are up at 2am feeding a child. However, cute even gets older when you realize that it takes time and money to raise a child correctly- love is the most important, but the love should come out of a committed marriage relationship first.|`|ntdGOZqGaa	Right...well at 17 I didnt even like kids lol Thank gosh that has all changed since now I have a 2 yr old and i'm pregnant. At 17 I think two kids is too much and 15 kids she better have a rich husband or make really good money. I think people should have kids when ready how many do you want to have? I think thats where you need to start good luck|`|01Mu3wUeaa	Sure.|`|g9vw4ovGaa	First of all how old are you? No you don't have to start early, women have children well into their 40's now. You need to worry about going to college and being able to support your children. She is more than likely miserable because she won't have the chance to  be young and free because she is tied down to these two helpless things that need her. Trust me, I had a baby at 19, I was married and I do have a good job. But it's tough to see all my single girlfriends go out to clubs every night and I'm on diaper duty and bath time. Don't get me wrong, I wouldn't trade my child for the world, it just makes you wonder sometimes. Enjoy you're freedom, kids are cute, until they have you up all night with spit up all over your shirt. Dirty diapers aren't cute, and neither are the prices of formula and diapers!|`|NOjcTeT4aa	Don't have a baby just because you think they are cute, how are you going to care for it ? How does she care for hers ? What i think of her situation is that her parents should have paid more attention and she should have learned a lesson in responsibility the first time.|`|46StihsPaa	DON'T!!!! It'll ruin your life later. Wait until you finish high school AT LEAST! I understand I think babies are adorable too, and I wish I was old enough to have one (I'm waiting), but at your young age just stick with baby cousins. <br>  <br>  If you really like babies start baby-sitting.<br>  <br>  You don't get ugly after high school or college.|`|dwvVg4A3aa	This is not a game. Being a mother is the most important job you'll ever have. At 15, 16, 17 you are not mentally or financially stable enough to care for yourself, let alone another human being.|`|ki5hZbcTaa	Are you stupid? Sure they're cute but see how cute they are when they're up at 3 am and won't go back to sleep because they're teething. Babies aren't toys and you can't just set them aside when you don't feel like playing with them anymore.|`|WiveFaO3aa	Oh goodness there go our taxes!|`|qzY6TuQmaa	she is crazy and so r u?? i bet shes on welfare that's y she wants so much she don't half to work and still get paid|`|jJZFShbeaa	what i think is your friend should keep her legs closed|`|8CbknQuDaa	I am amazed at how teenagers don't think anymore nowadays. Were has your sensibilities gone?<br>  <br>  Babies are not toys.  They are responsibility - BIG responsibility.  You have to have a job to take care of the baby.  Where would their food come from, clothing, health requirements?  from your parents??????<br>  <br>  If you can't even think for yourself, how in the world can you take care of an innocent child?  They grow too you know.  And as they grow, their requirements and necessities grow too!|`|rMuBHXg5aa	Babies don't ask to be born and they deserve to have parents who are mentally and financially prepared to give them a fighting chance in this world. They shouldn't have to be born to people who can't take care of them (without government aid). They are not play toys and they grow FAST!  It costs a lot to raise a child the way they deserve to be raised.|`|STLYxP39aa	It's not a good idea unless you're finished with school and are financially stable. It may seem like a good idea at the moment, but it's not. What kind of life are you going to give your child if you're working minimum wage without a diploma? My mom did it but it was really rough.<br>  <br>  Please think it through.|`|zRQmWC5saa	I think u should stay out of ur friends bussiness.  and u need to carry around a baby all day long and feed it , bath it, change it , etc. then come back and tell us how cute it really is. They r cute but alot of work and no sleeping, u ready for ur privledges to be taken away?|`|YlveXYHUaa	if you're still typing the phrase "OMG"<br>  <br>  and if you want a baby because they're "so cute"...<br>  <br>  then you need to stop thinking about babies...<br>  <br>  and go finish your math homework.|`|6oKKTkbDaa	OMG ! Isn't it too early to have a baby at the age of 15 !|`|zylldvvwaa	I think you know what we think.
AA12327015	Don't burden a kid with this name, please!|`|c08708aebaf627e023dde432dde5dc5aaa	Sipio would be the way to spell it...but don't name your kid such an odd name...it opens them up to ridicule...|`|CxRJwJsraa	I would have thought sippy-o to begin with. Since, in English, a C followed by an E or an I or a Y make an S sound. I would think Skippy-o would have to be Skipio or Schipio.<br>  <br>  I've never heard this before. and I'm not sure I'd recommend it. While I think it's interesting, it might be a bit too out-there. But, maybe as a middle name.....|`|Aj99vuqYaa	While it's an interesting name, I know several people who wouldn't want to be named that. So, if this is for a story, go for it. If it's for naming your future child/child on the way, then I urge you to reconsider. Imagine growing up with that name.. being mispronounced too many times and prolly be made fun of. <br>  <br>  It reminds me of scorpio when i see it.<br>  <br>  Its good to be unique...but this...kinda crosses the unique boundries out to "just dont do it" boundry.
kRaVa0Wraa	no, i cannot help you.<br>  however, you can help yourself.<br>  <br>  go up to him and say "i want a straight answer. do you like me or not? i'm getting mixed signals."|`|AA11959207	he is using you,|`|XCDd3hELaa	i agree with the tofu chick.|`|sMuMfuAgaa	I do agree that you should ask him but on the other hand...if he does like you he might be trying to cover it up.
dHREHByPaa	I would have to say no. He shouldn't be eating that much already. Maybe you can try to supplement some of his feedings with water. He should honestly be on about 5 to 6 ounces. If you don't control it now he might be extremely overweight.|`|sh4iTc6caa	well first of all based on many different clinical studies, formula milk is not advisable for children under 2 years of age. I would strongly advise so stop formula feeding and stick to breast feeding until the age of about 1 year and 6 months. You dont have to worry about the your baby's appetite, it is natural for newborns to experience physiologic weight loss during the first few weeks of life but they should gain weight after. Continue feeding your baby per demand and consult with a pediatrician if u have any further concerns. you can also find plenty of information on the internet.|`|TVx4iWlGaa	Every baby is different. Most babies dont eat this much but you should ask your doctor to be sure. My mother said when she brought my brother, who was almost an 11lb baby, was eating 8 oz bottles a week after she brought him home from the hospital. Btw, dont feed your baby water that was stupid advice.|`|7JPXyNHwaa	nope this is not healthy.<br>  because he will become over weight,<br>  and a child that age should drink no more then 4 oz every 3 to 4 hours.|`|YCJz2DiWaa	everone has an appetite. his just seems bigger. if he spits up a bunch...then it's too much.|`|5ItOGyVHaa	at 3 weeks the tummy isn't much bigger than a golf ball. that seems like a lot. is he spitting up much? i would try 4 and give him a break. however if that is Truly what he wants then maybe you are going to have  a big baby. <br>  <br>  never give water or anything else other than breast milk or formula for about 6 months. i see some one said to give water. it is empty and baby needs nutrient.
CNSGz12zaa	Theoretically yes but it would have to be less than 2-3 hours, as it would be dead by then.|`|AA11371251	Sperm can survive outside of the body for no more than about an hour. In general, if the semen is still wet it may well have live sperm.<br>  <br>  Once sperm enter the female body, however, their lifespan increases. Inside the vagina, sperm can only survive for about six hours, as vaginal secretions contain acids that break the sperm down pretty rapidly. Vaginal infections or the presence of a spermicide may destroy sperm, and not allow it to reach the fallopian tubes.<br>  <br>  Once sperm travels through the cervix, however, its lifespan increases even more dramatically. Sperm may survive in the Fallopian tubes for as long as 7 days, but generally survives for around 3 to 5 days. This means that fertilization can occur even if the sperm are deposited as much as a full week prior to ovulation.<br>  <br>  If a woman’s cervical mucus is not very hospitable to sperm, lifespan of sperm may be shorter. There are aids, such as “pre-seed lubricant,” that may assist with this process.<br>  <br>  If you are trying to conceive, it may be helpful to try to elevate your bottom in order to encourage the sperm to travel to your cervix more rapidly. Some studies have suggested that the contractions that accompany orgasm may pull the sperm from the vagina to the cervix.|`|5HTylrjGaa	Spem can live inside the body for up to 7 days. Outside the body they only last a few hours.<br>  <br>  Having sex during a woman's time of ovulation (when she is most likely to get pregnant in her cycle) and ejaculating will still only give you about a 25% chance that she will become pregnant (not that the sperm will meet the egg, but that the fertilized egg will actually attach and become a baby). Based on that, you can imagine how unlikely it is to get pregnant from splashing water.|`|iiUKFLY3aa	sperm dies outside of the body pretty much right away, longest i would say is a minute or so. no way could she get pregnant.|`|YNH2fmYWaa	anything is possible but i highly doubt it.<br>  <br>  i know that sperm can live in the female body for up to 3 days at the most...|`|yp9rEMSraa	average around 3 days...some live longer some live less....|`|W16vRFTNaa	idk about getting pregnant from sperm in the bowl but i know sperm can live for 1- 3 days out in the open.|`|SwJIeyCJaa	I do not think so.Many women who try hard to get pregnant they would get crazy if this was possible...
145RUNQHaa	I can tell from what you wrote that you don't think spanking is right and it's eating away at your conscience.in a situation like this you really have to put yourself in your childs shoes and try to understand why he acts the way he does.this is a tough age gap you've got between the two you've got two toddlers on your hands there that's a challenge for anyone.i think you need to stop making a big deal over what he's doing it's only adding to your sons anxiety.he's crying in his sleep bless him he must be feeling terrible.quite honestly when a child gets to the point where they are biting and lashing out they are very wound up inside so are already suffering.no need to add to that he feels bad enough already.you really need to help support him through the feelings he is experiencing.once he knows you are there for him unconditionally he won't feel half as angry and will probably start to relax.he probably doesn't want to be the big brother and wants to just be your baby again.this is not a time for discipline.remember you are his best teacher and he will only learn by the example you have set.by spanking you send all the wrong messages and all you achieve is a loss of trust.instead when he start lashing out at the little one just remove him away from her calmly and try to divert his attention which might dispell his anger a bit.don't make a big deal but spend time with him teaching him how to be gentle with his sister if you act calmly and lovingly every time the behaviour will eventually stop.don't give in to any knee jerk reactions if you feel you are reaching that point get on the internet and e mail me instead!|`|ntdGOZqGaa	I personally dont agree with the terrible two and threes stuff. I think if its allowed then they will do it. He probably feels like he isnt getting the attention that he once got from mommy since the baby has come. I would see if maybe he would help you more with the baby or things around the house and whenever he does something nice to the baby or for you make a big deal about it and tell him how he is so nice and what a good big brother he is and see thats how its done. Also try to take some extra time out of your day just for you and him time. Like when the baby is sleeping you guys bake cookies, or watch a movie or wrestle. I know its hard my 2 1/2 year old keeps me hopping too. Dont feel like a bad mother you are just frustrated, if you never got frustrated you wouldnt be human. Its ok just take deep breathes. Good luck|`|TVx4iWlGaa	Most often when an older sibling acts like this towards a younger sibling its because theyre not getting enough attention. It doesnt sound like he needs to be punished it sounds like he needs to be reassured that hes not forgotten about and that you love him as much as you love your other child. If he's already feeling left out then punishing him will only make it worse.|`|AA11969873	Give him more attention, take him out for ice cream get him a toy that he really really wants so he'll be occupied with the toy all day. he needs love!|`|FBUEi2Pnaa	I feel your pain. My daughter did the same with her brother but she grew out of it.|`|bpZp8UjKaa	Well I'm going through this right now I am a stay at home mommy and I have 2 girls... my oldest just turned 3 jan 30 and my youngest just turned 1 thursday. My oldest started out like that but now she isnt as bad I take her in a room to herself when her sissy is sleeping we play dolls and I read to her and we nap together..... they just need mommy time too. We color a lot together. I hope that you can fix this because our children don't need to feel this way... I know that my daughter didnt like the fact of another baby having her mommy I have to give her mommy time. If that dont work and you still need to punish that child stand him in the counter for 3 1/2 minutes make his nose touch the wall and dont give in and dont let him turn around. Thats what we do with our daughter and if that dont work and she stills acts up when she gets out we send her to bed for about 25 to 30 minutes.... I know that sounds bad but it isnt as bad as whipping the child, Good luck with your son I hope you can make him act better.|`|V3ZyGJMtaa	I also have a 2 year old going on 3 in june and i went though the same thing i thought i was going to go crazy nothing was working with him then one day i lost it took favorite toy and put it in time out and that has worked better then anything in the world for him... Now that we have that he knows if he gets 3 time outs or if he gets out of time out his toy goes into time out. Since i did that i havent had any of the problems i was haveing with biting and acting out.. Good luck|`|H1ZR6y1Vaa	Hey, don't beat yourself up about it. Its so strange as we ask other peoples opinions on raising our children but then beat ourselves up when their opinions don't match with ours. At the end of the day, you love him and are doing your best by him, thats all we can do. <br>  <br>  I would say that he is feeling threatened and frustrated. Remember not all naughty behaviour is bad behaviour, sometimes it is frustration. I am mum to a 2 year old, he was two in October and at the moment is really too big for his little boots, slightly bossy and wants his own way a lot. I started losing my patience with him, but now i tell him that naughty behaviour makes me sad and try to ease him through and reassure him through sticky situations, rather than repremand him a lot, it felt like all i did was shout. I still get angry but tend to express it in a more 'disappointed' voice than angry voice. It seems to work, when he still pushes, he has naughty corner and he comes out when he has calmed down and said sorry, the two minute thing does not work for him as he is so stubborn that i would go get him after two minutes and he would say no and say he did not like me! Now he comes out when he has calmed down and always says sorry, we have kisses and cuddles and all is forgotten.That said though, he is my only child and so maybe i have a little bit more time. <br>  <br>  Also, I give him 'big boy' jobs round the house, he always fetches the milk from the fridge for example, and switches the tv on, i am constantly telling him thank you and well done, as he is helpful, so i think the suggestion to rope him in to help new baby is good. Good luck chic, please don't beat yourself up. Also, i think his mind is probably capabale of thinking more than he can communicate, hence the frustration. Bless him.|`|ITCknAHVaa	One immediate thing is for three year old kindergarten.  Or child care for one to two mornings a week.  Children bite out of frustration, usually because they can not talk well.  You also nee to keep command simple and short, like stop biting.  I would also try taking kids out to playgroups, library story time.  Activities were they can interact and play with other kids.  Try and get into groups with kids his age.<br>  <br>  I do not think you are a bad mother kids at this age are very hard to deal with.  I think time out is a good idea and spanking if nothing else works is good.<br>  <br>  How about painting, or playdough l;ego to help keep him stitmulated?  Also when the baby is aslepp try just to spend positive time with him.  Give him lots of activities, take kids to the park, give him a little football or something.  Priase his postive behaviour.<br>  <br>  As I said child care or kindergarten for a morning or two will do you both wonders.  I would also talk to the child health center or doctor for more ideas and get them to check on progress of your children.<br>  <br>  Importantly you need to take care of yourself.  Time yourself out at some point from the kids, even if its one morning a week (while they are at either child care or being looked after by grandparents, dad etc).<br>  <br>  You need time for yourself.  Noone handles anything well when you are tired and stressed.  You are not a bad parents having too small kids is very hard and you do the best you can.|`|NET3qhGuaa	Well, is it possible that discipline isn't the right remedy?  To me it feels  ;ike he has some major upset about her, not at her. When did you see a change in him, and what was the change  that you saw?<br>  Try to pull as much information from you own memory as you can. When you think you ve gotten the reason or even just the time frame  you probably start to ask him some questions . Simple ones of course.like  Why are you doing that to her?  Make it  safe for him to answer you, that hes not going to get into trouble. When he does answer you I found it best to confirm the answer  with them , checking to see if you've got it right.  It may very well be that he just wants the audience  for himself and doesn't want to share it with her.   If that the case then  spend a little time with him each day asking him about different stuff. Mostly kids want an audience so they can practice  acting like themselves. I think he might be trying to take the stage back from her, He is certain that if he he bites and pushes her you  WILL notice him . I would try the above and then make sure that every once in a while you throw him some one on one and let him have a few minutes of  keeping your attention on him. Good luck!|`|bbe253b8bd16b56edbb017e1a281d44eaa	Sounds like he is going through the typical terrible twos or showing signs of jealously.I see nothing wrong with spanking your child...I spank my children and plan to do so throughout their childhoods..until they reach an age where is is less beneficial.Spanking and abuse are two very different things. Spanking is tapping your child lightly on the butt...not smacking them wherever on their body..even slapping their hands to let them know something is not okay is tolerable in my book. I also tend to use a lot of timeouts and take toys away when my children misbehave. As a parent you got to set limits and be consistant.Since he is showing signs of jealously you should try to take a day every now and then to plan something just for Mommy and son w/out the youngest child....might make him feel special.Praise him when he is nice to his sibling and tell him he is her protector to make him feel needed in your growing family.Hope this helps~|`|kziIf0r6aa	Maybe try getting down to his level and talking to him, its amazing what he understands they are absorbent little creatures who need all the love and guideance possible.  At such a young age is spanking really necessary it just gives them the indication that they have your attention wether it good or bad.<br>  <br>  Mayb try and spend some more one on one time with him he might be feeling left out and like his sibling gets more attention and does no wrong.  When bubs is asleep make that your time to sit and draw paint play games do puzzles read books.  Talk to your little one like a person you'll get more from him.  I only say this as bluntly as I am cause I've been going thru the same thing with my lil man who's 22 months.  Good luck
wUVUXHZtaa	If both of you are trying to get pregnant, then after you ejaculate in her, have her lift her hips up.|`|kaqPSgTVaa	Your semen WILL leak back out of her. It doesn't just stay inside her. That's how it works. It doesn't mean that your sperm didn't get in her. She will get pregnant eventually.|`|pWDYcBA7aa	No that is normal...<br>  When it leaks out, some sperm stays inside of her vagina and any little sperm can get her pregnant!
1z3C0R2Vaa	see your doc but i don't think you are good luck........)|`|kaqPSgTVaa	You should probably see a doctor at this point and get a blood test done.|`|duISQSSWaa	Hi, <br>  <br>  Just don,t panic there is still something you may do talk to a doctor for a prescription & he may refer you a medicine you are supposed to have to start your periods again. Though the medicine is gonna cost you much but its not as expensive. Even i can prescribe it here but i am not a doctor & if you are feeling shy than try talking to any of your married female friend to get you the contact no. of a gyno.|`|dHREHByPaa	I would try to take another pregnancy test right when you wake up in the morning. That is the best time to do those. It is also possible that now you are stressing so much that you are just late. All that you can really do is try another test, or go to the doctor if you are uncomfortable with that.|`|NigoVXX1aa	Feb has 28 days so don't worry if you don't get your periods in 3-4 days then get a checkup.|`|t8HPCzrOaa	maybe its cuz your stressing alot go and take a bleed testt okk hun|`|tSKBsbIyaa	Don't worry, as you have just missed 3-4 days n not more. <br>  If you don't get you r menses in next 7 days, then you need to check, and for assurance, you may check your urine again every alternate days. <br>  This happens due to many reasons, so can not conclude unless the test is showing.<br>  Good luck|`|pTDaG04Aaa	it's only 1 day late right now, take a couple different pregnancy tests, but wait a few days to see if you get your period. if not, and you aren't getting any results, go to the doctor and have them test you|`|G6Zm8QDxaa	If ur test was negative u will need to see a doctor and get a blood test done because if ur not pregnant there may be something else causing u to not get any periods.|`|YUrQfauwaa	Use I-pills , Mala-D  as much as possible with Doctor's advise.....otherwise In the beginning abortion can be done at any time.<br>  Still better is ,getting answers from maternity home for such questions....
MwcNwpIvaa	I was on BC pills for seven years. When I got off them, I had unprotected sex ONE time, and was pregnant within a month of getting off the pills. So to answer your question -- ABSOLUTELY. And don't listen to the person who said a child would have birth defects if you get pregnant too quickly after getting off BC. They are obviously an idiot.|`|kaqPSgTVaa	Of course you could be...Take a test.|`|k4Ek3jAqaa	Yes there's always a chance you can get pregnant when you have unprotected sex even while on birth control as it's not 100% effective. It could have just been the change from depo to the patch then back again but I'd get a test just to be sure.|`|vEBfp8yHaa	I hope not!  If you have a kid too close to the time of stopping your birth control, the kid could have birth defects!
prqrQcd1aa	I've heard of other children doing this before as well. I think that it can sometimes just be something that happens when kids are "curious" about things. I am not so shure that they actually had "sex" at that age. If they aren't showing any signs of things being wrong now, then leave well enough alone. If the kids are bothered by it, then it would be wise to take them to a counselor, counselors have heard stuff like this before...<br>  I'd just tell your cousin that sometimes stuff like this happens, that there is nothing to worry about now, so stop worrying about it. Of course she needed to get it off of her chest..who wouldn't!|`|AaoclPYCaa	You said it already, they just did it because it felt good.  I would just move on.  We all do things in life we wish we had not done.  If they do not have problems because of it now then why make it an issue.  They were just kids and probably had no idea what they were really doing.|`|ntdGOZqGaa	Wow, well thats different!! hehe It happend when they were 7 &8 I would just let it go, I cant believe she told though wow. There is nothing that can be done about it now and as long as they arent touchy feely with eachother now then just let it go. I never had those good feelings at 7 or 8 I hated boys and thought they were nasty. So I say just let it go they were just kids...even though thats kinda freaky sorry no offense|`|Xaw48PZ7aa	whats the point in even discussing it then?  if there arent any problems now, and they arent showing signs that they NEED therapy, then leave it alone.|`|qzY6TuQmaa	everyone i know has done something with a family member i think its theses days ya know u learn that stuff in school u cant stop it in less she takes them out and home schools|`|Hx0a0Q8Uaa	you'd be surprised at how common this is. Before I became a housewife I was a psychologist, I had to listen to a lot of f-ed up s-h-i-t  but one of the top 5  most common things i'd hear from otherwise normal people (i.e. without a mental illness) is " when I was a child I played 'doctor' with my <insert playmate/relative here>" usually it happens with same-sex siblings, brothers and brothers,  that kind of thing. Actually if there is no history of sexual abuse in the family, this act is called "Early Sexual expression and exploration"  and 1 in every 10 children under the age of 10 will have an experience such as this, tell her to got to counseling and tell her not to feel so guilty. <br>  <br>  By the way the other 4 common issues are <br>  1. Tie between: I had a sexual experience with my dog/cat as a child (usually between ages 10-16) and I have sexual dreams and thoughts about a family member (usually mother or father)<br>  2. Depression after positive life changing event (marriage, new baby, etc) <br>  3. recurring nightmares <br>  4. mild anxiety problems|`|jQhyQGCiaa	i dont know, sorry. but i think shes be mad if she saw this whole detailed thing for ppl all over the world to see.|`|TZMBn5z7aa	I would tell your aunt that most kids experiment at that age   like the playing doctor games kids play the only dif is that they are siblings   but so long as no one was forced than no harm done really    <br>  <br>  if your aunt is really upset tell her that she should maybe find a way to let that go or maybe speak with a psyciatrist to work through her feelings<br>  <br>  and if the daughter is feeling guilty or ashamed then maybe she could seek help too  but in all honesty nether of them needs to feel badly about this  its just kids being kids   I have read a couple studies that said for most people  their first sexual experience was with a sibling or  cousin  most of the time its just things like looking or touching to see what other kids have that might be different   <br>  so really the daughter is just one of many many people who have had something like this in their childhood and that she isn't perverted in any way  and as long as she doesn't want to do anything with little kids she is a perfectly normal kid   except she is close enough with her mother and trusts her enough to tell her this   which most people cant say they are that trusting of their parent <br>  <br>  so yea I would tell her that its no big deal really and that she should let her daughter know that as long as no one was molested or forced in anyway  she is normal and didn't do  anything wrong|`|on5NQxhkaa	Wow.<br>  <br>  First of all, I don't think your aunt should have told you that, that is not fair for you to have to deal with... but whatever.<br>  <br>  Secondly, those kids need some therapy. I am not judging your cousins, because at that age they were very niave however it's obviously something that still bothers your cousin and she need to talk to someone about it. Tell your aunt to get them to a counselor... she might need to talk to one herself to deal with it.<br>  <br>  Also, assure her that it isn't her fault what they did... she is probably feeling guilty like she did something wrong as a mother to cause this to happen. That's not necessarily the case though, children get into a lot of harm that sometimes has nothing to do with the parent. So just try to be there for her and comfort her.<br>  <br>  Good luck with your family's situation.

The only thing Id suggest is not to overreact, just sit down and explain to her that its not nice and that teddies need cuddles too.  She may just be acting out to see how you will react dont get worried over it she's exploring so many different things each day just run with it.  She'll be three before you know it lolx|`|AA11383122	my 2 year old daughter is usually a really good kid also but when she gets mad she throws her toys, knocks things over, and throws herself on the floor.

You ever hear of the terrible twos?|`|bpZp8UjKaa	Girl, I am still not over these terrible 2's and my daughter is 3! It's just a stage that all children go though!
aca803aafd407291581b58b9be71df4daa	That is normal for breastfed babies.  Newborns have to nurse often to help stimulate your milk production.  If they don't nurse a lot then you don't make the milk for their growing body.<br>  <br>  This is why people end up supplementing with formula.  They think the baby is still hungry.  It isn't.  It is just their biology helping them survive.  Keep nursing.  It will get better.|`|7gRIGupCaa	how old is your baby? Newborns have a groth spurt at around 6 weeks so are much hungrier then. Also he could act hungry if something else is wrong so check that he dosnt have wind or need a nappy change.|`|D1LNlk3Saa	well, since you have a newborn and he just can't get full then you need to call your pediatrician.  sometimes a mothers milk may not work for her child.  i would not feed a newborn anything other than breast milk or formula.  also if you are eating anything that would cause you gas it will also cause your baby to have gas.
AMGDW3LYaa	It's too early to tell that your symptoms suggest that you are pregnant. But there is a possibility that you are because some cases show pregnancy symptoms to show during even the first week.

I didn't even like car rides bc they made me so dizzy and crabby just by getting dizzy. and all this started happening at about 4-6 weeks. I started throwing up, but I don't think I ever forced myself to do it though... cramping? are you getting the type where your stomach just feels kinda numb? cuz thats normal.. and a lil below the belly button? it's normal to feel that way i had all these symptoms in my pregnancy =]

OQnRP6xVaa	It all depends on the rules and needs in your community.<br>  <br>  In some states they prefer to allow the addition of a New Family member by birth or adoption to have at least a year before adding new members. <br>  <br>  Once children are placed into a Foster Home there is a huge effort to not move them around any more then is vital. So, in some cases they would not make any change to the family status--they may just not place more children for an extended period of time.<br>  <br>  These questions are very different depending on the rules and policies of the agency placing foster children.|`|8DnIXwnyaa	we had children placed with us both times i was pregnant.|`|yDWcYXl5aa	Typically, since you already have a 16 month old, there won't be any children placed into your home that would be an endangerment to your child nor the baby.<br>  <br>  I'd be honest and talk with the social worker.  Many times, they have children who they're 90% sure will be reunited with the parents after a short period of time.  There's also respite care, where it's almost like babysitting, and you can take care of kids in the home, and it's strictly temporary.  An example of this might be that the normal foster parents must attend a funeral out of state, and foster children typically can't be taken out of state.  There's also cases where a natural parent is involved in an auto accident, or even if they get put in jail for an offense such as not paying on an old traffic ticket, so they have to spend time away for just a little bit.<br>  <br>  Foster care's main goal is to reunify the natural family if possible.  Further along in the pregnancy, I wouldn't take any children that could be considered long term care.  During your pregnancy also, it's a good idea to keep numbers to the social worker and the respite care providers in your area, just in case you have a problem like pre-term labor, and have to go into the hospital.|`|Alyvp37Maa	i guess my suggestion would be to prevent pregnancy from happening for a while.  Let these kids be the absolute focus of most of your love and affection for a while.  Once they feel safe and loved, some issues might come to the surface, so be prepared.  It will not be the same as raising your biological child, because she has not had the trauma of losing a parent(s).  This is different for each child and each situation because we are all individuals.  Loss is a common expression felt by many children through adoption.  Be present for them in their moment of need, they deserve that.  They have been through so much already.<br>  <br>  If you feel like you want another pregnancy soon then maybe foster care adoption isn't right for you at this moment in time.  Best wishes.|`|01a19d2b8982bebcfca1b5520fa5d1e1aa	Its my opinion that conditions could vary from place to place. Perhaps it would be better to call them, and find out, than ask the public on here.

I think that Lillian Taylor is good. But I got to say that I love Lillian Claire|`|fznvQptlaa	i like it. i like it better with sophia than taylor or emily. i also really like claire|`|VHHis05Naa	I think both Lillian Sophia Brown and Lillian Claire Brown are absolutely beautiful names.  Your daughter will be a lucky girl, either way.<br>  <br>  Not a fan of Taylor at all and Emily doesn't flow to me.|`|8RfmosODaa	I like Lillian Sophia and Lillian Claire they are both very pretty|`|7uznrLBXaa	Lillian Sophia or Lillian Claire are both lovely names.  They flow nicely.  And Lillian is a classic, feminine name that suits a toddler *and* flatters a professional adult.  Good job!<br>  <br>  Lillian Emily is awkward.  Lillian Taylor is ok, but I'd go with Lillian Sophia.|`|KOcCenrEaa	I like Lillian Claire better then Lillian Sophia, Lillian Taylor or Lillian Emily.|`|o9Ckf0h4aa	lillian sophia sounds the best out of them all! but, i do like emily claire also.|`|Z6NlNRLoaa	I like all of the middle names you have in mind! However, I prefer Lilliana over Lillian.
Y8ZmuWwgaa	Sofia is the European spelling; Sophia is the anglicized one. Both are pretty, I think. <br>  <br>  Sofia is the capital of Bulgaria, so it's a fun fact if you like place names. If you think they're terribly cheesy, then it may be a con for you. Sofia looks more lively in the US, in my opinion; the -f adds spunk and character. <br>  <br>  Sophia is the more commonly seen, demure version. It's more likely to be spelled correctly and looks softer and more classic -- at least in an English speaking country. <br>  <br>  With Lillian, I'd spell it Sophia, personally. It seems to "match" more -- Sofia sticks out a bit while Sophia blends in. If you like the boldness of Sofia, though, by all means go ahead. Neither combination is bad!|`|D0pQFlMIaa	I like Sophia. The name is an elegant name, and the "ph" spelling seems to be elegant too. Sofia looks more trendy, but I don't think the name itself matches with trendy. Also, it reminds me more of Sofa. But choose whichever one you like best!|`|hh892gJfaa	Sophia. It looks SO much prettier, Sofia looks like sofa.|`|DwkUUQqhaa	I like Lillian Sophia better.

kSZx9cY5aa	Before you contact them ask the other moms if they have hired them before and whether they're any good. While you're at it ask your friends if they have any babysitters they can recommend. I'm much more likely to trust someone who my friend trusts than hire someone from a flier.<br>  When we go out my 15yo daughter watches the kids for us and she is more capable than a lot of parents. If she's busy we usually have a friend or family member who's happy to sit for us. The only time we have used someone else, we hired a 16yo that had babysat for a close friend, and she did a good job.<br>  <br>  Call the girls and ask for references. Call the parents who they have worked for and ask them what they are like. If you hear positive things then I would go ahead and hire them. It sounds like they have good intentions, and i'm sure they'll be fine. Just make sure they have had experience with children within the same age group as yours.<br>  But my first choice would be to ask a friend or family member if they would mind sitting for you. <br>  <br>  Good luck :)|`|1U7yLEf9aa	I would go with my gut feeling. You can NEVER be too careful... but you can NOT be careful enough... Do what you think is safe. I only leave my kids with my mother and close family members.|`|jUneJXEIaa	I don't think I would to be honest, 14 years old seems a bit young to babysit a 17 month old baby.  Although legally they can at 14 years old and if they have experience they might be ok.  Maybe invite them round to your house to see how they are with your children.|`|kSlycVwnaa	I don't have kids, but if I did, I wouldn't let a 14 year old stranger look after them.  <br>  <br>  Find out what baby sitting experience the girls have had.  For all you know, it may have been very minimal.<br>  <br>  If you are friendly with any of the mums who have taken the girls phone number, speak to them and ask if they were happy with the job the girls did and if they would ask them to baby sit again.<br>  <br>  If you need a baby sitter, a better idea would be to ask the carers at your son's pre-school.  It will be more expensive than paying a teenager, but you know you will be getting someone who knows your kids and has experience caring for children.|`|AA10943329	I would not leave my kids with strangers. I would only use those recommended by friends.|`|W380tuKiaa	Ask the girls for refernces from other parents and not from thier friends or family

nrqWwQBXaa	not always there are a few things i learn from my son. so no we do not know every thing?|`|SnQvsOPwaa	There are some teens who outgrow some adults during the teen years. It has to do with life experiences and when an adult stops learning. I have a 16 year old that I make a habit of telling him how things will play out within his life. He then sees them happen so he still listens to me about that kind of stuff. Some of the things he learns at school weren't even around or known when I went. So he has the opportunity to teach me as well. I believe if you don't pretend to know it all and listen instead of always tell your kids things. Then they will learn to trust you in some areas.|`|Rk87mqkoaa	Adults are wiser than children 13-14yo or younger. When they are teens, they become almost as wise as adults. It's different with experience. One adult may often be less experienced than a today's teen.|`|t1fx6kXcaa	Generally with age comes wisdom. Certainly this is not true of those adults who are ignorant and closed-minded. A racist adult is a good example of a person who does not have wisdom. Children and teenagers can be wise beyond their years if they question what they are told. If they question beliefs and statements. If they read and research beliefs and statements and don't take everything at face value. Another sign of wisdom is realising you are infallible and that you don't have all the answers.|`|rNvXWMOMaa	absolutely|`|XOnSRoR2aa	Not necessarily.<br>  <br>  The more life experience you have, the more knowledge and wisdom you are likely to have acquired. It all really depends on the quality of your experiences and how much of what you've learned from life has truly soaked in, though. I mean, just because two people are in the same class for a year doesn't mean that they will both receive the same grade on the final exam, does it? One may have spent the whole time daydreaming and learned very little, and the other could have been inquisitive and attentive and inherently more intelligent and acquired lessons that will serve him well the rest of his life. Similarly, one 50-yr-old man may be a crackpot racist as shallow as a kiddie pool and someone not worthy of your time or respect, and another 50-yr-old could offer you sound advice and profound wisdom. There are some incredibly foolish and immature adults (ahem, OJ Simpson), and some very wise children (Dakota Fanning blows my mind).<br>  <br>  Children can be very wise, too, for the opposite reason; they have not yet been jaded or become cynical by life experiences, and their view is more simplistic and clear. Young children are also less likely to be impressed by credentials and wealth, like the way the little kid in the Emperor's New Clothes was the only one wise enough to be able to point out the truth. Also, everyone acquires experience and knowledge differently, and matures at their own rate, and some are are more insightful and intuitive than others and "wise beyond their years." I'm 17, and feel like my family's passion for traveling and our experiences abroad have opened my eyes and given me a broader perspective than most people my age, but I can be naive in other ways. Reading, paying attention to what's going on in the world, and having a curious mind thirsty for knowledge will also lead to wisdom.<br>  <br>  You should show respect for most of your elders, but not necessarily take their advice or follow their lead all the time. Sometimes they are right, and sometimes they are not, and sometimes it's half and half. Do research and deliberate on your own. You'll become wise by learning when to follow and when to go your own way.

NVfqk0rnaa	Hola. Por lo que cuentas, no parece probable que estés embarazada. Las náuseas no aparecen nada más en el embarazo, hay muchas otras cosas que pueden producirlas. Si tu menstruación de hace dos semanas fue normal y abundante (aunque haya sido irregular) y desde ese día hasta ahora no has tenido relaciones sexuales, no estás embarazada. <br>  <br>  Es extremadamente difícil que te embaraces con semen que está en los dedos de tu pareja (no imposible, pero sí muy difícil), así que no te preocupes. <br>  <br>  Es muy importante que aún cuando te estés poniendo la barrera de que no tienes dinero, trates de cuidarte a ti y a tu cuerpo. Hay opciones gratuitas de atención para el tema de la sexualidad y la anticoncepción y las puedes investigar, de verdad que con un poco que le pongas de tu parte puedes ir a ver a un médico que te oriente sobre el tema de ser irregular y qué método anticonceptivo puedes utilizar, no sólo para cuidarte sino para regularizarte. Espero que no te moleste esta sugerencia, en verdad es para que te sientas más tranquila y feliz con tu sexualidad. Saludos y mucha suerte!|`|F8ynw8t2aa	?Ya tuviste un embarazo, LO ABORTASTE y sigues jugando a quitarle los condones a tu pareja?.... EL QUE JUEGA CON FUEGO SE QUEMA MI NENA....

Jef1GPTaaa	Hi, I had the same problem when I was TTC.  I am really tight, but I was afraid to use lube because of what I had heard.  I did a lot of research, still wasn't sure, so I asked my RE.  He told me to use ConceivEase lub.  He said it's better than preseed because it does not affect sperm motility.   I got pregnant while using it, so I can say firsthand that it worked for me.  Good luck, I hope this helps.|`|zKEgGwhxaa	It's possible for lube to kill sperm, so it's best not to use it near ovulation if you're ttc.  It may not kill it, but it's a good idea not to just in case.  It really doesn't matter if you use it when you're not near ovulation.|`|HLlIKDWkaa	If your not fertile it would be fine to use lube.

You may want to keep on formula longer or discuss any other options (like using soy milk) with your doctor.

Just leave them alone and gargle with salt water.<br>  <br>  Have you had a sore throat lately?<br>  Or are you eating in a hurry lately? <br>  <br>  Anyways mine looked exactly the same way so have no fear!|`|08j3Gs1oaa	i get those all the time when my immune system is low. i take two b12 tablets under my tongue a day until it clears up. i also gargle with listerine. if they don't go away in a week, then go to a doctor and maybe ask for some antibiotics. all the best!|`|d4ac61414fc4c240b01f3cc34a7003c9aa	It looks like the early signs of strep throat.  You may need an antibiotic. I hope you feel better.|`|YKYh9Z72aa	i get something like that if not the same thing..... i typically only get one or two at a time though. mine are clogged salivary glands. they are kinda scratchy and hard and they usually get irritated cause i always mess with them with my tongue.... not cause i try to but cause it feels like something stuck in your mouth, lol.... there's really not much you can do about them but wait it out. they only seem to last a couple days. spicy foods or acidic things will irritate them more and may even cause you to get more of them so i'd avoid that. my dr says to drink plenty of water and it should help. yours look the same there's just more of them at one. good luck!|`|ybexjS2Paa	Could they be mouth ulcers? I'm not an expert but they look like that to me. You could try gargling with salt and water. You need to ask your doctor though.|`|MFWEkkd9aa	Ouch!  looks to me like they are mouth ulcers, try gargling with salt water.  <br>  <br>  Take care you, Lulu x|`|zHG5gjBZaa	As soon as I started to read your question my eyes got wider as I have always got these on and off I get them before I get sick so its usually when my immune system is low. I itch them with the top of my tongue mainly at night. Good Luck..|`|8G42oyydaa	Go to the Doctors, make sure it isnt herpes.  It is probably something not very serious, but honestly, get it checked especially if you have a fever or feel sick. Canker sores have a red circle around them, yours dont appear to have that. Fatique can have a negative affect on your immune system, and may you more suceptible to infections.<br>  <br>  Check on the internet for free walk in clinics, google "youth free clincs"  They will generally see anyone, even if you are an adult and dont have medical|`|dXVA1wHDaa	It may the beginning of tonsillitis, google image it, but NOT if you're squeamish!

0W8M6weFaa	Yes, there certainly is hope! I know that I am not giving up hope and I was diagnosed with PCOS in 2004. You will most likely be put on either glucophage or metformin to help control your insulin levels. If you are over weight, then you should start a low carb diet. Sometimes losing weight can help PCOS'er's get pregnant from what I have been told by my Gyno. Never give up hope! Getting pregnant is possible and controlling PCOS is possible as well!|`|stRWElvPaa	Can I just ask you one thing, are you overweight? <br>   I read that losing weight can solve the problem of ovulation due to the fat being responsible for insulin resistance (the root of pcos) and it also produces too much estrogen, delaying ovulation. <br>    They will probably put you on metformin like the other poster mentioned, or even give you clomid. good luck!|`|HLlIKDWkaa	Yes....there is alot they can do now. They will probably start you on metformin and chlomid to help you ovulate. They did me when they though I had PCOS, turns out I don't. Also, if you are overweight exercise and losing weight will help. Women ovulate at different times. For example one month I ovulated on 14 days past my AF then the month I actually got pregnant (which ended in miscarriage)I ovulated 10 day after AF. Good Luck and don't lose hope. God works in mysterious ways!|`|pPRYtaUdaa	Yes! There is hope! Ask the doctor to give you some fertility medicines.  PCOS just have low chance than normal women and normal women only have 25% chance to get preg every month.  I have PCOS and I got pergs on Clomid but had miscarriage.  But at least we got pregs, ya know.  Keep your head up high. God will send you your little angles.  Sometimes things are mean to be I guess. No matter how ready we think we are, when God doesn't think we are, we are gonna have to wait. Baby dust!!! Best wish!
j01zBZmZaa	I absolutely love it! Old-fashioned names (aka granny names) are my favorites: they stand the test of time.|`|htfyL6I2aa	I am a Nancy named after a Nancy.  I'm 37, not fat or old fashioned!  I was one of the only Nancy's in my school so I had an original name, not a trendy one.  Nancy means 'full of grace" and it is a name that stands the test of time.  It is a good adult and little girl name.  Yes, I did get called Nancy Drew sometimes... but kids will always find something to rhyme or relate a name to.  Like all Hannahs will be Hannah Montana or Hannah Banana...  I say go for it.  Not many people are naming their kids Nancy.  They are naming them all emily and emma so she will probably be the only one in her class.  :)|`|t8JhViXPaa	I love it, i have a friend called Nancy, it really suits her, because she's really funny. It just seems like a name for a really bubbly, funny person to me.|`|gQEFy4BVaa	I actually love the name Nancy. I would prefer to use it as a nickname for Anne, but I don't think that's very practical nowadays.<br>  <br>  I say go for it!|`|e76k5edZaa	Its s'okay but why dont u choose something a little more unique like..<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  Happy,<br>  Hope, <br>  Princess :) hehe<br>  Kyla<br>  Sugar<br>  Crumble|`|YVpWpg6Saa	Personally, not a big fan, a little too old fashioned for my liking.|`|g7wQij2Oaa	no one's gonna like me for this, but i think it's ugly. very very ugly.<br>  <br>  :)|`|aKnoADs1aa	only if she will be a detective wink wink.|`|JBoRCQpOaa	Old fashioned|`|3AfQ9UXYaa	it's not bad but it's not my cup of tea... sorry.|`|DxL3u9spaa	cutee =]|`|Vtcu0MV9aa	so cutee wat About Emma or ORLA (: ... xx|`|s2F6pK9Xaa	I think it's great!|`|5b73ZOhkaa	Love it...|`|DwkUUQqhaa	It's a cute name. <br>  <br>  Congrats, and have a nice day! <3|`|eo0DKI0qaa	Not that good too old of a name|`|nPHJndGOaa	My honest opinion is that it's a cute name for a little girl, but not good for when she is an adult. Reminds me too much of Nancy Drew and Nancy from Little House on the Prairie. <br>  <br>  In all honesty, I couldn't take an adult named Nancy seriously. <br>  <br>  I would suggest something that's cute for a little girl, and you could add "Dr." to as an adult.|`|a153400c02cc95fc922554b970dac85daa	Not my favorite, but okay. Some parents want the name of their child to help them stand out as they grow up; that's not important to others.<br>  To me, Nancy is plain and inoffensive, but not at all memorable.<br>   I'm told old-fashioned names, like fashion, are coming back.|`|xw74UzjMaa	I love the name Nancy for a girl. I especially like the combination Nancy Isobel. <br>  <br>  Rose|`|WQp3uGglaa	I think it is sort of out dated try something from this decade.

She is really called Anne and Nancy is short for Anne.  I like it.|`|tQPvv0Glaa	I don't see it as a name for a little girl, but more of a name for an older woman.

2HETgiwgaa	Fertility treatments containg hCG (human chorionic gonatdotropin) can cause false positive HPTs rather than false negatives. hMG (human menopausal gonadotropin) is the general name for the group of hormones that include LH (luteinising hormone), FSH (follicle stimulating hormone (FSH)) and hCG.<br>  <br>  Fertamid = clomid, which is used to promote ovulation.  It can cause a false positive on an OPK (which tests for a surge in LH), but shouldn't interfere with pregnancy tests.<br>  <br>  Lexapro is not recommended during pregnancy - if your mother is pregnant, she should talk to her doctor about an alternative, but she shouldn't stop taking it without medical advice.  I didn't find any information to suggest that it would mask the test, though.<br>  <br>  How long is it since your mother had her last period?  Sometimes the reason for a negative test is testing too early.  Blood tests should be more accurate than home tests, so she should see her doctor about getting one.  She can check with her doctor if it's possible that her medications could interfere with the results - there may be some interaction between the two drugs for example, but it's unlikely.  <br>  <br>  If the blood test is negative and she still thinks she may be pregnant, she could ask for an ultrasound.  There are reports of false negatives even well into pregnancy, but they are rare.  There could also be other explanations for pregnancy symptoms - for example the side effects of Lexapro which include nausea and fatigue.<br>  <br>  Good luck :)|`|17ae94f98003e0b9fdcbfa3f8583e9f1aa	Neither lexapro nor fertamoid contain Hcg. I am sorry but idk what hmg is?  At any rate, neither drug would "mask" the results of a home pregnancy test ir cause a false negative test.  If the test says "negative" and her period is already overdue, then she is not likely pregnant.<br>  <br>  Hopefully, if she is taking fertamoid, she is being followed closely by a OB-GYN or a reproductive endocrinologist.  She should follow up with her doctor right away for a serum hcg and to see what's going on.<br>  <br>  Also, your mom should be aware that Lexapro is NOT safe during pregnancy and if your mom needs to take Lexapro, she shouldn't be trying to get pregnant.  It can cause birth defects.

oVxr5B3Eaa	My parents let me get one at 16.... The legal age with consent in Ontario. They also let me get my navel pierced when I was 14 (which is again legal age with consent in ontario).. The navel took a lot of begging, the tattoo took less, but I wasn't allowed to get a second one until I turned 18.... Actually, I'm not sure I asked but I went and got one shortly after my 18th birthday and they didn't look pleased (as I shocked them with it) but they got over it fast.. Neither of my parents have any piercings or tattoos as generally dislike them.|`|nZPGdcKJaa	If the teen is 18 and living on their own then it doesn't matter, but if they are not 18 and still living with mom and dad then they should ask and mom and dad should have the last say.<br>  Kids don't realize that they are a direct reflection of a parents ability to be a parent and don't understand how other adults see their parents differently when the child does something like get a tattoo or dress a certain way.<br>  <br>  but to answer your question:<br>  it depends on the tattoo, where it is going to be, and WHY the teen wants it.  Also, who is paying for the tattoo?<br>  <br>  There is a reason why you need to be a certain age to do things. 16 to drive, 18 to smoke, 21 to drink (in the US) and there is a good reason why you need to be 18 for a tattoo. But if there are good reasons behind a minor wanting a tattoo and their parents agree then that is why the teen can get a tattoo with a parent's permission|`|TORBP6QIaa	18...<br>  <br>  I probably wouldn't like it but it would be their choice and at their expense. <br>  <br>  I have 3 teenage sons...18, 16, 13 and so far none of them have expressed a desire for a tattoo...one had his ear pierced at 16 for about 6 months but took it out after he got bored with it...|`|IHw2qUtcaa	My bf was 15.|`|1U7yLEf9aa	It's actually illegal for anyone under the age 18 to get a tattoo. With or without a parents permission. In most states at least. Don't worry about it. If he/she is over 18 then they don't need your permission.  The only thing you can allow someone under the age of 18 to do is get a piercing (nose, eyebrow, tongue, belly button exc.....) But only with parents permission.|`|XvvZFkTRaa	I think 18 is the legal age for a tattoo, isn't it?  So, 18 would be my answer.  It would be my daughter's decision though, I would not influence her one way or the other.  I would stress that she would have the tattoo for life and ask her to think carefully, though before taking the plunge.  She would still be my lovely, bubbly girl with or without a tattoo.|`|Cg4fWi3Baa	Any responsible parent would make the child wait until he/she is of age. There's reasons these laws apply.<br>  I remember wanting a tattoo at 18 when I was living at home. My mum told me that even though I was of age she didn't approve. She told me I could do what I liked when I was no longer under her roof.<br>  I knew I could have got it done but I didn't out of respect for my mother. About a yr after I left home, I went and got it done.|`|3LEPfzVhaa	I'd make her wait until its legal, but talk to them about how you should only even get a tattoo if your sure its EXACTLY what you want on your body for the rest of your life.<br>  There's a girl at school who's around 14/ 15, she has a tattoo of a star behind her ear and it already looks botched...|`|jchCJZxTaa	my mum says to me!<br>  18 or 16 when i can get a tatto with my own my money! but 18+ is the best age i think!!<br>  <br>  I am too much of a sook to get one!|`|lb8FBhWnaa	uhhh i would NOT want my kids getting tatoo's ever!!!<br>  I guess once they turn 18 then it's their choice, but i would never support it, or take them to get them.<br>  Lol i just hate tatoo's <br>  Sooo trashy!!!

Our son is all the time happy when he has his dad is home, so he doesn't act out much. <br>  <br>  We have had that fight countless times. <br>  <br>  The best thing to do is discuss both your parenting styles, and agree together what's best for your children. Explain to each other why you feel strongly about such & such, and show him why it's important to you, and have him show you some of his styles, and how he would want to deal with a certain situations.

His father show obvious  favoritism, his brothers were violent and sold him into slavery, his master's wife lied about him, falsely accused him of rape, he was put into prison, forgotten, and so much more. but in his own words he said "God meant it for good" <br>  <br>  I sometimes like to look at my life and compare it to Joseph's. no I haven't been sold into slavery or put in prison, but I do come from a hard family situation. I have the advantage to look at Joseph's life in hind-sight to see how God worked it out for good. Joseph didn't have that. In my life there are things that I cannot see the future to see how God is going to work them out for good. but like Joseph I will continue to trust in God and let Him take control. <br>  <br>  Romans 8:28 "and we know that all things work together for good, to them that love God, to them who are called according to His purpose."<br>  <br>  my other favorites are paul, and titus.|`|I1obSjwbaa	Judas.

I wouldn't be ashamed of that-Les Misérables is one of the greatest novels ever written in any language!|`|1bRRODd2aa	I'm not surprised she was reluctant - It sounds like a made up name - was she conceived on the Euphrates?|`|T0NvgQTUaa	It makes me wonder how long it took her to learn how to write her name.|`|AA11391968	It has meaning and it's a middle name.

wKuQC4yTaa	during pregnancy, spotting is normal after sex. but since your early on, if you start bleeding more than a pad an hour, go to your ER|`|kaqPSgTVaa	Not really...I would call your doctor.

I don't know about that.|`|ppX0xoeFaa	It is normal.|`|DSbcSVnWaa	Depends how far along are you with pregnancyy...?<br>  <br>  Because technically it is said, you aren't suppose to have sex while your prego, its a huge no no..<br>  <br>  Might want to call your doctor.|`|ZcpefUf7aa	how far along are you?

hmX4ko0Eaa	Fantastic!<br>  All 4 of my children had dummies and I took them away at 18months-2 years. All 4 have straight teeth! <br>  There are children in my kids classes at school who are sucking their thumbs in class, have warts on thumbs and fingers, and wear braces to straighten teeth. All because they didn't have a dummy!!!<br>  It is still regarded as a "class" thing though. <br>  Do what you think is right for you and your baby, not what every other tom, dick and harry think!|`|B24W8w43aa	Bad idea. They carry germs, bad for teething and are not necessary anyway, once you start using them it becomes something difficult to take away..|`|t1fx6kXcaa	I didn't use a pacifier with my son because they increase the risk of ear infections and gastritis. There is also the risk involved with a baby sucking on a pacifier which contains hormone disruptors and possible carcinogens (bpa, pthalates and pvc) With that being said, If your baby is suffering from colic, when all else fails to console, including breast milk, a pacifier can help calm the baby down. If I had another baby who suffered from colic, than I would use one but I'd use a natural one (natural rubber) that did not contain bpa, pthalates and pvc. And I would only use it during the colic period.<br>  You need to do what is right for you and your infant and if using a pacifier is right for you and your baby, than use one and ignore comments from family.<br>  Good luck|`|8wnvhBQTaa	I hate dummies but use them wih my 10month old twins, I try only to give them at nap & bed time but sometimes when they are really upset it acts like a plug!  lol.  If your baby seems settled with a dummy then I have no problem with them but I hate seeing 3 / 4 year olds walking around and talking with a dummy!|`|eV7rtxmuaa	Iv used one with my daughter since she was 2 weeks old. It was the only was I could get her to sleep. If it settles baby I dont see what the problem is.|`|tivpa7Vlaa	family say dont give it to my 3mth old son but they not the one home 7days a week wit baby...i will avoid any unnecessary crying as much as possible...|`|oSig1lQoaa	Bad idea.|`|txGRbdLSaa	Hi,<br>  All my children had a dummy up until they were around two years old. Their teeth developed fine and dummies were always sterilised up until I stopped sterilising bottles and they started putting toys etc. into their mouths. <br>  Also it's easy to wean off a dummy by taking it away. You can't take a thumb away.|`|ded4210b2d8375997cd6719be107446baa	there are many pro's and con's to using dummies.<br>  my first two son's had one and they were very useful. They have straight teeth. My third son didn't have one and still sucks his thumb now and he is four. his teeth are beautiful, but obviously his dentist is concerned because of them changing shape. i think a dummy is ok as long as its used properly, what i cant stand is seeing people desperatly trying to shove the thing i the babies gob while the baby is spitting it out, this makes me feel like getting it and lobbing it as far as i can! if it works then use it, but always change it regularily and sterilize it every time its been dropped somewhere. Sucking on it yourself is not good enough, yuk yuk yuk!! Good luck with whatever you decide to do.|`|Ihfq3Ih5aa	Sam will not take one during the day, and he is just beginning to stop becoming reliant on them at night time. to fall asleep.<br>  <br>  I don't know how some people can be so rude, and so misguided.<br>  Dummies quite obviously should not be used to 'shut a baby as' so to speak, but they aren't the devil, like people are making them out to be.<br>  <br>  They only carry germs if they are not washed and sterlised.|`|yIdgG8b1aa	Well. I put a dummy in my 4 daughters mouth and i can tell you now how much i regret it lol. Its a soother for her so it's ok but it there are other ways to comfort your baby i'd def choose that over a dummy,  as the thing is my daughter is 4 weeks old & hooked on the thing!!! lol. When its 4am and she is crying just because her dummy fell out her mouth and its every few mins its falling out and it becomes annoying lol. As a general i don't think dummys are too bad, aslong as you take them away from an early age, my friends 9yr old still has her dummy and i think its terrible. I am gonna take my little girls dummy from her when she is 1 as she is small enough to not get into such a mess about it, as they get older i find they get more attatched to things, and she wont have too many teeth for the dummy to affect but she has had her comforter for a while & time to go to a new comforter like a snuggly lol.|`|7PXFXcKfaa	i dont like them either - BUT they can lower the risk of SIDS (cot death) if used to help the kid fall asleep - so throw them back at them if they ask. Noone can argue with that!<br>  <br>  There are some risks involved - like if you use them too much then it can cause crooked teeth and problems to the roof of the mouth, and babies who use them get more ear infections than those who dont. <br>  <br>  However if you only use it to put your baby to sleep, and not ALL the time it will probably fine.<br>  <br>  Hey whatever - its your baby its your rules!|`|yNoENquTaa	well if it's the only way to sett;e her and you choose to do so then it is fine despite what you family speaks. the dummy won't kill your baby so i don't know what the fuss is all about.<br>  i think they are ok to use and some babies take to them more than others. =]<br>  ???|`|hWe8vhKKaa	i dont like dummies , but if it settles your baby and your ok with it o for it|`|zHG5gjBZaa	Ignore your family and go with what you think your baby wants.. My son who is nearly two has one still only for sleep time and our 8 week old has one as he has reflux and its the only way to settle him.. The downsides to a dummy is getting them off it (we are going thru that with two yr old) and our 8 week old wakes up everytime it falls out of his mouth..good luck and go with what you want.|`|I5DUJh1kaa	one can use dummies once you have establised breastfeeding or not until ur child is 4-6 weeks old as before that children can have nipple confusion.<br>  one can use dummies at times to settle ur lil one. the mechanism behind the dummies is that they help to setttle lil ones breathing to normal and also that sucking is very soothing of them. also its better for them to suck on dummy than their thumb because u can control their dummy use but u will not have control on thumb sucking which later becomes a difficult job for parents.. u can use orthodontic dummies if u can find one( v. difficult to grt one). and yes remember to sterlise dummies before giving it to ur lil one.<br>  good look|`|fBGIUSfaaa	i think its up to you as mum to decide, i find that there will always be someone praising what you do and someone shaming what you do... rules change as the generations do.. some say dummies some say no dummies.. I say what works for you and your bub is whats right. You dont see anyone walk around with a dummy as an adult so they obviously do outgrow this stage, if you need to use them do. Its your choice so dont worry what others think, even your family.|`|MFWEkkd9aa	I LOVE DUMMIES.<br>  My 9wk old has one in as we speak and she is fast asleep - Ahhhhh.<br>  20mins ago, she did not have one in her mouth and she sounded more like WWAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAHHHHHHHHHHHHH!!!<br>  Now I know which sound I prefer, lol.<br>  <br>  Seriously though, I feel that if a dummy will help a baby settle, there is absolutlely no harm at all in using one, it's just another way of comforting them, same as rocking, singing etc.. some Tinies need to suck, and who are we to say no :)<br>  <br>  Take care you, Lulu x|`|RIBS2ay1aa	If it settles your kid down then its fine<br>  Its your child, your decision<br>  Both my girls had dummies, or 'dee dee's' as they called them, and its done them no harm<br>  It also makes them feel 'grown up' when it comes to the time to put them in the bin.|`|dnLL4J71aa	if it works for you then go with it. i didnt give one to my little boy till he was 4 weeks old coz i wanted to get breastfeeding established first, and then he wouldnt take it! lol but its alrite, if your child needs it they need it, just go with the flow|`|hIoxij6eaa	Whatever works I reckon. Just make sure you sterilise and replace them frequently. Oh, and take the dummy out for photos... we have heaps of baby photos of my eldest son, but that dummy hides half his face in most of them!|`|ybexjS2Paa	My son used to use them and now my daughter does too. Mostly it is only for sleeping I try to hide them during the day and take it out once she's asleep.|`|CwXe7OgIaa	Don't like them used at night as bub gets used to it and wakes up for it during the night as can't settle on their own.

45xNJ7Ncaa	It sounds like an imbalance in progesterone which is causing your lining to not shed properly.  PMS, hormone imbalance symptoms and early pregnancy symptoms are so much alike that you can't tell what it is until you have a period, get checked or have a positive pregnancy test.<br>  During the first two months of pregnancy, the uterus is tucked behind the bladder between the pubic bone and the underware band line.  You can't feel the uterus, just the bladder.<br>  <br>  I would say your hormones are unbalanced due to the cyst issues (cyst can mess up your lining due to throwing off your estrogen & progesterone a few months after the cyst is gone).<br>  <br>  If you were pregnant and getting symptoms, you would have a positive result.  It's the high hcg and progesterone levels that cause pregnancy symptoms.  The hcg levels double ever 48 hours.  The only exception is a tubal pregnancy or a pregnancy in trouble but the levels would still be high enough to show a positive result if the woman is getting symptoms.<br>  I would suggest going to your ob/gyn and ask for a sonogram to rule out pregnancy and a cyst than ask about taking provera or progesterone (if there's no cyst or pregnancy) to cause the lining to fully shed itself which should reset your hormones.<br>  <br>  I get that cervix pain.  It feels like a sharp fingernail like pain that shoots downward.  I had it during pregnancy but also had it last month when I was dealing with lining issues after having a cyst for 6 months.  I tried progesterone but it didn't work for me.  My past two af's had the slimy pink/red.  It reminded me of the lochia -- discharge you get having a baby & the heavy bleeding.|`|t0jC2o0Jaa	If you feel your pregnant, don't give up testing. I think the doc should do an ultrasound within a few weeks to see if there is anything there. Every pregnancy is differen't, and you won't always feel the same things. I really hope you get your answers soon. If I were you I'd try to test again within a week or so, or wait atleast a few weeks and get an ultrasound done. Good Luck Hun.<br>  <br>  <br>  *note: I've sometimes had weird periods that would only be spotting anywhere between 1-2 sometimes 3 days at random times and I wasn't pregnant even when I thought I was. Don't get discouraged, and if at all possible get that ultrasound*

Sure enough, the kids get on your nerves some days but it is just like life.  Everybody has good days and bad days.  You could say the same about work, a really bad day does not mean you're not mentally ready or able to work!  We just have to sail through the little storms of life.|`|Ihfq3Ih5aa	Agree....to an extent.<br>  <br>  No one can be 'fully prepared' for a child, but there are certain situations that are better for the child.<br>  <br>  For example,:<br>  <br>  A. A young woman, earning 200 dollars a week, separated from the child's father who is unemployed, living in a one room apartment, in the rough area of the town, with no family near-by.<br>  <br>  B. A woman, working from home earning 400 a week, has a husband earning 1000, lives in a good area, with plenty of family near by.<br>  <br>  Now, of course it is not discrimination, but the child has a better chance of a great life in the latter option.<br>  Both options can be done, but if it were to be planned out, I think the second option would be the easiest, and best option for the baby/
IdoZbO39aa	I am 40 weeks today aswell! Congrats, hoping its close for both of us. The last few days i have been having back pain on and off and woke up the other morning with about 4 hours of timeable contractrions and then they just stopped (great!). Been for two really long walks today and bub seems even now to have moved down even more and had a very spicy curry for dinner (fingers crossed that gets the ball rolling - haha). Apart from that i have been doing nipple stimulation the last couple of days on and off. I find when i do that i am noticing contractions and they last for a little while but then always subside. Hoping if i keep doing that on and off then the contractions might stick and it will be all systems go.<br>  This is first bub for me and obviously all very unknown.<br>  Hope that it all starts up for you soon  - Good luck with it all :)|`|XQDGbofOaa	While i was walking i felt bub niggle down too, i also had back pain.

I'd start getting ready to go to hospital. If you start feeling like you want to go and do a #2, don't. Go to the hospital. I was like you are, I left it too late and I had my baby at home. My first was induced too and it was totally different. This time the midwife said to me that contractions didn't have to be frequent, regular or intense to be the real thing. If you are getting more mucus then yep, I reckon if you aren't in giving birth right now then you very soon will be. Congratulations!|`|tivpa7Vlaa	you wont be here next week typing u will see real labor in two days...
RH4PM3fEaa	i think you cshould call your mum or an older lady who can help you. they are very wise.<br>  take your baby to the hospital<br>  better safe then sorry it may be whooping cough|`|692c8795f68a0ba95a0d09139d70c98caa	Have you tried the humidifier?  It works wonders for the stuffy nose, also sleep with the baby propped up on your chest, he will be able to breath alot better while propped up, and you can feel every breath he takes and be comforted and get some sleep.|`|qqiVKUBpaa	Go turn your shower on in your bathroom and close the doors so that it steams up the room, then take him with you into the bathroom and stand outside the shower so that he can breathe in the humid air. This will make it easier for him to breathe. Do this for around 15 minutes. Then spray some saline in his nose and use a bulb syringe to suction out the snot. If he has a fever give him a luke warm bath (not cold) and some infant tylenol, put him in some comfortable jammies and let him sleep in his carseat (one night won't hurt him) or elevate his mattress so that his head is raised. This is what I do for my daughter and it really seems to help her when she's congested. Also try running a humidifier in his room.<br>  <br>  Good luck! I hope he starts feeling better!|`|MFWEkkd9aa	Oh my love!  Get him to the Doctor as soon today.  Also a steam filled room will help with his breathing, take him into the bathroom and turn the shower onto the hottest setting and just let it run, keep the door shut, the room will fill up with steam in about 5mins :)  Stay in there as long as you can.<br>  <br>  Good luck, I hope your Tiny feels better soon <br>  Take care you, Lulu x|`|KkjOXRRWaa	Maybe ask your mom to help you out. You don't sound old enough to care for the baby at all.<br>  <br>  I think someone should call a social worker.|`|BbdWpp1Caa	better to be safe then sorry. if he has a fever esp. go to the hospital!|`|IjkPBYlkaa	try taking him a warm bath and put a babyrub from vicks to help him breath better|`|jCkLYey7aa	Do not panic, but if your baby has a fever with abnormal drowsiness, flat dark red spots that do not fade on pressure, a seizure that have lasted more than 5 minutes , refused feeds under 3 hours (if under 3 months) 6 hours over 6 months. <br>  Call an abulance.<br>  If the babys temperature is higher then normal then take him to the hospital.<br>  Otherwise Call your doctor.<br>  You may need medical help|`|CwXe7OgIaa	warm salt water drops up nose will clear that up. I would go to hospital if you haven't already and be sure it is the flu. Also a warm bath could help. Oh the poor little fella, I hope he feels better!|`|Ae6eA9nlaa	Use a bulb syringe to clean his nose, make sure you squeeze the air out before you put it in his nose. If he has a temp get him to the hospital.|`|YjlU5Bqnaa	give motrin for the fever & pain...  then GO to the ER.  dont let your baby suffer, a baby having flu is so serious!|`|kkQHX0qdaa	call the hospital or make him blow his nose somehow :( i'm sorry
Jf3DIPcNaa	My daughter had an overactive bladder and couldn't help her accidents. The best thing to do is not make a big deal out of it because that stresses them out and seems to make it worse. I got her those overnight underwear so she wouldn't be soaked in pee when she woke up in the morning. Then I taught her to clean herself up well in the mornings so she didn't get rashes or smell bad. <br>  <br>  She outgrew it just fine, it just took her a while. I always had her go potty right before bed and I was a night owl so when I went to bed a few hours later, I would wake her up to go in the middle of the night. That also helped a lot. <br>  <br>  Also, certain things really irritate the bladder and make it harder to hold your pee: citrus and caffiene are big ones. Try to cut out any of that and it may help.|`|oAJi0s3Waa	yes, by brother and my stepson had this problem, do not let him have anything to drink about 2 hours before he goes to bed and it helps if you can get up during the night and wake him to go to the bathroom.no stress or action packed movies before he goes to bed. it helps. after a while you will be able to set the alarm for a certain time during the night so that he can wake himself to go to the restroom|`|HvX6KvK1aa	my mum`s best friend, pearl, from high school used to wet the bed every single night. she won a scholarship to study music at a private musical academy. only very talented musicians can get chosen. it was the opportunity of a lifetime. pearl was in tears for days because her parents will not let her go. they were afraid she might wet the bed there(it was a boarding school). she is now in her forties, has three children, is happily married, and still has that bed-wetting problem. she will have that problem all her life.|`|55ac50ec591a2bbc757c20a9ce8c4322aa	it's normal just takes small percentage of kids that long|`|oLj0VTX5aa	Ahh, yes.  Do not give him liquids at least two hours before bed, do not make him feel insecure about wetting his bed, and check to see if he is warm enough or too warm in his bed.  If he is getting chills from below the matress, but he is warm on top, it will make him need to pee.  If he is too warm, he could be waaaay too comfortable and miss the signal to wake up to go to the bathroom.  <br>  <br>  The important thing is to also find out if he is stressed about anything - one stress might have come from what might have been a one or two night stint of really bad dreams or fear of something or someone that might hurt him or he might be stressed about something at school or else where and needs to be reassured that he won't be in trouble for coming forward and there is help.  <br>  <br>  When I was a kid, we had moved and because my mom was busy, it was a while before my bed frame was unpacked, so my bed was simply on the floor in my room. I also had a really big, creepy tree outside my window that would smack against the house in the wind - I was getting chills off the floor and I was freaked out by the tree, and started wetting my bed. <br>   Once the tree was trimmed, I was less freaked out, and my mom figured out I was getting cold off the floor, so we put my bed together and she put one of those egg crate bed covers on my bed, and I stopped wetting the bed.|`|SnQvsOPwaa	I've heard of this from other parents. Everyone seems to think that it is normal and kids do grow out of it.|`|RsFxgN4Gaa	Yup.... my 11 year old had the same problem.. he just stopped wetting the bed a few months ago. There are still occasional accidents when he is really, really tired... but for the most part we are past it.<br>  <br>  It is very normal, it's not your son's fault, and he will grow out of it. Just make sure to let him know you understand and you aren't blaming him.
8G42oyydaa	Here's a thought, why arent you on birth control? You say you have used the morning after pill a number of times.  You are being foolish and playing russian roulette. Get yourself on some permanent birth control.|`|kaqPSgTVaa	No. It messes up what your cycle was so there is no way of knowing.|`|9ARNK0Bzaa	The morning after pill messes with your cycle.  About 7 days after taking it, most girls experience some bleeding, which is basically just the pill doing its job. Your period should come around about the usual time still. It's not unusual if it doesn't, but do a pregnancy test if you don't have a period come when it should.<br>  <br>  -x-x-|`|OoTScJLPaa	it kinda depends on when it was due to begin with. usually makes it come earlier than your reg period.
145RUNQHaa	Push for the doctor he might have a chest infection best to get him checked.in the meantime give him plenty of fluids and warm drinks.if he's got no other symptoms he'll prob be fine but i always take my son to docs if he's chesty.|`|aLAmvX5Naa	The doctor can't do anything for a cold. Just make him comfortable. Push fluids to keep him well hydrated.|`|AA10120592	my 19 month old is going through the same thing right now. Get the johnsons vapor bath, and bathe him before nap time and bed time, the vapors from that stuff is really good. Also, you can get the vicks baby vapor rub. at this age they can't have any meds and the doc won't be able to do a whole lot, unless he has a fever, which would tell me an ear infection has set in.|`|TVqXrOq2aa	Try to get him in to see the doc asap. You never know what he may have picked up at daycare or at the babysitters house.  You can;t give him any medicine, but vapor bath is good. So is vicks baby VapoRub. Also, push fluids and put a humidifier in his room when he naps and at bedtime. Good Luck
oHNrktxTaa	Everyone is different & it does sound like you are having a few early symptoms. Most of the time, the symptoms begin a week or two after your pregnant.<br>  <br>  GOOD LUCK & BABY DUST!|`|AA10747402	you should really see a doctor about this. They can give you other tests besides urine tests that will confirm if you are pregnant or not.|`|aJGAXYUIaa	yeah
EFc8VGwRaa	hot baths help as it relaxes your body and when you relax your body can work on doing other things such as make baby come (water should never be hot though it should only be warm and not make your temperature go up!!!).<br>  it is quite possible that this baby will come around the same time but nobody will have a definate answer for you as baby comes when baby is ready.<br>  would be a good idea to do the expressing colostum if you had trouble last time..and you could be getting your milk in if your breast is starting to hurt, or you have blocked milk ducts, but a good idea would be to talk to your midwife about that one as it can be a number of things..a good thing to do is get cold cabbage leaves and put them on your breasts as this relieves the soreness...and honey also works.(i no that sounds weird but it helps) good luck|`|Ihfq3Ih5aa	Baths do not induce labour, so lets get that out of the way.<br>  <br>  WARM baths are only suggested as a good pain reliever, or stress relief, they have NO inductive properties whatsoever.<br>  <br>  As for the tender breasts, it sounds like you have 'over worked' them, and that trying to get the colostrum out early is almost causing your milk to come in.<br>  <br>  You can stop it by cutting back on the amount of colostrum collections per day you are doing.|`|UdICTUnaaa	u are probably seeing a doctor or midwife quite regularly now so if your breast gets worse or doesnt feel better, ask him or her about it<br>  <br>  and these people are right about not taking HOT baths, and if you get into a hot-tub like at the hospital, if yours has one, it will prolong your labor... my labor was 40 hours long and i think it had a lot to do with that tub...|`|dAgtW3G0aa	a hot bath is dangerous as it can raise babys temperature and theres no evidence that it can help induce labour. <br>  <br>  <br>   I'd call your midwife about your breast as you could have a slight case of mastits <a href="http://www.nhs.uk/Conditions/Mastitis/Pages/Symptoms.aspx?url=Pages/What%20is%20it.aspx" rel="nofollow">http://www.nhs.uk/Conditions/Mastitis/Pa...</a>|`|eV7rtxmuaa	Do not ever take a hot bath!

f9sL3WgQaa	One of my kids they misspelled her name from what I wanted..so we had to get it corrected. It does happen.. They are just human people!|`|0SIhrYCbaa	My grand daughters was changed over and over. The same women kept making the same mistake. My daughter gave her daughter the same middle name she has. The registrar kept adding an E to the end of it. Over and over.<br>  I looked at the hospital copy and laughed. you can see its been changed, a lot! Plus on the mothers name line the middle name was erased, with a big blank space, and nothing put back in. I guess the lady was too stressed at the drama.|`|VuUz8NgKaa	I don't know about the date, but on my daughters her name was misspelled.|`|45nSn7Rcaa	I've never heard of it or thought about it before, but now that you mention it...I suppose it is somewhat common with human error and all.|`|4di2FUSUaa	well idk about the date, but the name is comonly misspelled|`|4WyUrWaIaa	They didn't put my middle name on mine. My mother only realized when she needed it for my registration starting school !!|`|hKJIDdVqaa	on my son's they had a minute time difference when he was born.  They said 7:38 and it was 7:37.

l4gqo2LBaa	wtf?|`|TKDi70uTaa	pretention comes to mind, 1/10.|`|dK6YGyNyaa	I used to know a girl with that name, but it was spelt Charnee. I prefer the Siany spelling, but I'd suggest using Sian as the actual name, and using Siany as a nickname.|`|okgr5aPCaa	Nothing really springs to mind... maybe wine. Perhaps because it sound a bit like Chardonnay?<br>  <br>  It's not a bad name at all, but it sounds and looks kinda awkward and I hink people would have trouble saying/spelling it.|`|DP48dIxhaa	Nothing really comes to mind...but it's an awkward name! I don't like it. I would give it a 1/10|`|FrLDHBLfaa	The first thing I think of is TV and stereo electronics.|`|cn2rvsdOaa	I don't like it!|`|D2Vkk5WDaa	I would never guess that is how it was pronounced.  Now that I know that is how it is pronounced, it reminds of Charmin, the toilet paper brand.  Not trying to be mean AT ALL. I still think it is your opinion that matters when naming your child, no one elses.<br>  <br>  I would give it a 2 or 3.|`|qLSbV8qqaa	it reminds me of my little sister, she is calles sian and we used to call her siany when she was little. I think it a nice name and if you like it you should use it. Maybe the spelling sharnie would be better though?|`|Szwmr19baa	How Sean Connery might ask for a sandwich as in "Can I have a cheese and tomato Sharnee?".|`|WqkFJ2Pgaa	It loses major points for no one knowing how to pronounce it.|`|iqku0QOQaa	I prefer Sian. Siany could be the nickname, cause it's cute, but i'm not sure Siany would suit an adult. x
HUlK3soAaa	I've had 2.5 pregnancies (one loss at 23 weeks), and each time, from shortly after conception until giving birth, I had no drive.  Absolutely zero.  Didn't want to be touched and didn't want to touch anyone else.<br>  <br>  I had no interest in even trying.  My husband was INCREDIBLY patient during those times.  And since the loss was shortly followed by our first child, he went nearly 16 months of barely getting anything.  However, he was very richly rewarded afterward, when the hormones righted themselves and it all came rushing back to me about a month or so postpartum.<br>  <br>  If this is killing your marriage, then your husband needs to chill out and get a little perspective.  You're pregnant.  This isn't personal--it's hormonal--and you cannot control what it's going to do to you or how it's going to make you feel.<br>  <br>  There's no telling when this could change.  Could be in a few weeks, a few months, or not until after the birth.  Hang in there!|`|kaqPSgTVaa	It is due to the hormones. It shouldn't be killing your marriage. Sex is important but not more important than that baby you two created and if it's painful for you DON'T do it. Usually in the second trimester you'll regain your sex drive and sex becomes more comfortable. Hang in there. <br>  I hope your husband isn't being annoying about this. I'm pregnant and both emotionally and physically hormonal and while it's not fun it's understandable. I hope your husband can see this. If it is from his side then take him to your next doctor's appointment and have the doctor explain what's going on and why. Maybe he'll be more understanding.|`|EFc8VGwRaa	hi,<br>  it is normal to have no sex drive anymore as your body just doesnt feel up to doing it and it is a hormonal thing as all your hormones are scattered everywhere at the moment.<br>  try using kyjelly or any other lubricant that you can almost pick up anywhere..you would usually find it around the condoms..<br>  try having alot of four play first to get things going (i mean quite abit...go exploring haha)..and it may change later on it pregnancy as some people usually find themselves not wanting it at first and then in the second trimester (when you have your energy burst) they find themselves being animals in the bedroom..good luck and i hope you can have great sex soon|`|UUtTDAJraa	Well it's normal to not have a sex drive while pregnant. It really is different with everyone. Who knows if after you will regain it back. It could be months, even years. I was in your situation with a no sex drive and it's not pleasant. I tried dieting and exercising but it didn't do anything. Until I tried this natural herbal enhancer which is meant to increase the sex drive along with other things I've noticed. It's a topical oil called Hersolution Gel which is like an instant libido boost. Along with that my sensations are just blasting and my orgasms are then best. Read up about it at herenhancement.com where I saved on it at the time. It got better with every application. I was skeptical at first but the companies return policy made me commit. From what I remember you have to try out for a couple months but then after that you can return it if it doesn't work. It would work great for your situation considering your pregnant and theres no need to swallow anything. Well good luck and I hope this helps.|`|hoX7hoINaa	It varies woman to woman. Theory is that sex drive lowers in the beginning, and slowly increases as your belly grows...weird but I find it to be true in my case. I had no sex drive, and as my tummy got bigger, my sex drive slowly increased.|`|KHhRgzXtaa	ive got 4 kids, for me my drive disapeared totally, i dont know how women feel like it, i fully didnt, , my husband was so frustrated,,lol|`|eV7rtxmuaa	Im 9 weeks pregnant and iv got no sex drive at all. My partner thinks im not interested in him... but thats just not the case.|`|azE51WGRaa	I know exactly how you feel. What my husband and I have done is make love in different ways (i.e. oral, foreplay, etc). Unfortunately, for many women decreased sex drive does come with pregnancy due to the hormones. If you would like to still have sex sometimes, buy some lubricant (ky jelly works great and is pretty cheap too. You can buy it at walmart in the same aisle as tampons and pregnancy tests). This will help so that it doesn't hurt so much. You can also try having sex in the shower because the water will act as a lubricant plus it will help to relax your muscles so that way you can have some pleasure too. Just try experimenting with what works and what doesn't. It will get better. Good luck|`|dAgtW3G0aa	Its perfectly normal in the first few months to go off sex completely!  And virginal dryness is common too. Lots of  women experience a raise in the sex drive in the middle of the pregnancy so wait a month or so and see how you feel then.  If lubrication continues to be a problem try using ky jelly to help.|`|UseJjREjaa	When I got pregnant with the twins my sex drive didn't change much.  Some months were high than others.  But AFTER I had them I have been a horn dogg.. LOL  <br>  My hubby tells me I am gonna get sex overdosed if I don't slow down.  HA HA<br>  <br>  But it is ok.  It will change alot because of your hormones.  Just buy some lube and try to really get into it.  Sex is a very important part of the relationship.  Plus it is a great stress reliever which you really need while being pregnant :D<br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|wK4kqhHkaa	Sorry to tell you but i had a killer sex drive before i got pregnant and after i did it died.  My daughter is now 8mths and it still hasn't returned.  Lots of foreplay and making sure your in the right mind space helps.  <br>  Hope yours returns|`|AA10626836	Its hormonal some girls it gose WAY up and some it gose down or it can stay the same <br>  <br>  Buy lube!
SEzIkGNiaa	Bike Riding<br>  Jump Rope<br>  Go for Walks<br>  Sprinkler<br>  Side Walk Chalk|`|Hx0a0Q8Uaa	Get them a pet and require that they spend 30mins a day taking care of them. You can get them something exotic since you live in the country, may I suggest a capybara or a goat. This will also teach them about responsibility, and can be lots of fun. Capybaras are good because they are nice animals that love children, and are often used in petting zoos. Goats are great for the same reasons + they are easy to maintain. <br>  <br>  Another option is, talk to them about it, sit down and have a talk about why they sit in their rooms. <br>  <br>  If those two ideas don't work try enrolling them in classes at the nearest community center. The average class is usually about $100 for 4 mos. You can enroll them in almost anything baseball,karate, swimming.<br>  <br>  May I also suggest assigning them a project, buy some materials so they can build something, a fort, a tree house, a play house, something  of that nature, sometimes when you give children the tools to do something great they will get out there, work together and surprise you.|`|541ni2a9aa	the most important thing for children is activity.<br>  <br>  Unfortunately you are going to have to invest a little into this (financially).<br>  <br>  Buy them bikes, buy them materials to build a fort, buy them chalk so they can display their beautiful art on the sidewalks, buy them unique seeds like watermelon seeds and tell them to plant a garden and have them tend to it and watch it grow, buy them water toys and buy a sprinkler, buy a slip and slide.<br>  <br>  These are just a few, all the things I enjoyed as a kid anyway.. hope this helps!|`|PTdy6TWRaa	If you make hanging about indoors less comfortable the kids will come up with lots of reasons to play outside and lots of ideas on their own for things to do out there. Keep the TV off and when you see too much laying about going on start suggesting chores they can help out with. It won't take long before the kids disappear and get busy doing other things.
fOxS7EE7aa	on the first visit, you will be asked about your menstrual history.  so it would help if you could bring a record of your menstrual cycles if you have one.  this is so the doctor can check if you have regular cycles since irregular cycles are usually the first indicator of fertility issues.<br>  <br>  the doctor may also prescribe additional tests.  for me, she wanted to have blood work and transvaginal ultrasound (to check ovaries and uterus).  and we also had a papsmear and internal exam.<br>  <br>  the first meeting for me was very general and quite informative.  she will also give advice on the best positions to use (which depends on the position of the cervix), as well as the days to do it to maximize your chances of conceiving.<br>  <br>  so that's usually what happens on the first meeting.<br>  <br>  second meeting you bring the results of the exams done, and that's when he/she will give you meds to help only when necessary based on the results.<br>  <br>  with my first OB, she just gave me clomid since my periods were regular.  she didn't even do any tests or whatever.  that's why i changed to a new OB specializing in infertility.  my OB now always performs tests before prescribing anything because she understands that work ups can be expensive and emotionally taxing.  so she wants to ensure that she will give meds only after diagnosis.<br>  <br>  so also be weary of OBs who would give you instant medication or a miracle pill.  you should be checked thoroughly first.<br>  <br>  good luck!

You have plenty of time.  If you still feel this way in 4 or 5 years, after you get your degree and are able to support yourself and any children you might have, then give it a go.  Having a baby does not mean that someone is going to take care of you for the rest of your life.  It's not an insurance policy.  The only way you can make sure you get the things you want and need out of life are to get a decent education and work for them.  Of the young women who have a child before the age of 20, only 2% obtain a college degree by the time they are 30.  You have plenty of time to have children, you do not have plenty of time to get an education.

DONT GET PREGO that's the best advice I can give you WAIT..|`|GpdYgi4Zaa	you might want to get married first but isnt he a bit too old? I mean you wouldnt wanna support your baby alone. idk what kinda health problems your husband might have but at 56 that is like 20 years past the middle of your life. so by the time u have a baby now...when your baby is like a teenager its dad will be like a grandpa..bones get weaker when you age. you would want someone with more energy!<br>  its ok if u wanna have a baby with this guy but do a lot of thinking. and being married would be a good thing. and possibly going to school to get a degree in something so u can have a job that will support you and your baby. but once your bf becomes a seinor..his retirement wont cover a lot. my moms a seinor and retired and its hard for her to support herself.|`|LjeAymnhaa	not for nothing if you have dry sex it is harder to conceive you should get this product called pre seed it cost 14.99 and there is mad different products it will help you out i am going to get it tomorrow i will make sure i will let you know when i get pregnant <br>  sprinkling baby dust on you and other TTC<br>  <br>  until then don't use spit it will kill sperm with the bacteria and also don't use ky jelly it make a barria so the sperm can bailey get threw|`|MLB9Z3qOaa	your such a weirdo...anyway its not much about having lots of sex hes probably to old to make a good sperm that can travel all the way to the egg. 11 months is too short of a relations ship to have a big commitment of a child. maybe its not meant to be...seriously|`|4e41debb3a890a8f2a8498469a897dcaaa	first find someone younger with better sperm. second your 18 and not married. don't rush. enjoy being young before you become a mommy. but if you REALLY want this. talk to a doctor. get on vitamins so you and the baby to be are heathly. and good luck

Do you just not want another baby right now? Maybe you could come up with a time frame together. If you don't want one at all you need to express your reasons to him, but you need to be willing to listen to his too. Will it be more of a benefit to have another baby for everyone involved including your daughter or not?

fMilDRgLaa	I had to take progesterone pills with both of my "successful" pregnancies. My second pregnancy I bled for almost 6 weeks. It was from week 10-16 weeks and found out I had a blood clot in my uterus with the baby. My body ended up absorbing it and getting rid of it, but it scared the heck out of me.  <br>  <br>  It is hard to say what will happen.  Just keep praying those numbers continue to climb.  Take Care!|`|UTCkWYl1aa	I dont want to scare you but i was 6 weeks when i started getting light spotting people told me it was not unusual to get bleeding in the first three months so i stayed calm and thought i was fine. when i went for blood tests and ultrasound at 9 weeks i found out the bleeding was early signs of a miscarriage. i miscarried at 9 weeks I was hart broken. But after having one normal period after the miscaraige i got pregnant again and im now 6 weeks and ive had no problems (knock on wood) miscarraiges ae very common. The best thing you can do is get some rest.
7UEv9Sdwaa	Yes it is normal for at least the first six days after giving birth.|`|kaqPSgTVaa	She should call her doctor. I'm kind of suprised he didn't tell her about clots and whatnot.|`|tivpa7Vlaa	i guess so. i know after i had my son 3mths ago i passed some cloths a couple times. during the first 2wks of bleeding. man i don't know what the vagina be doing sometimes. she can call up any nurse in labor and delivery and she can get advice form them|`|1jwbQaZTaa	yeah its normal. make sure she is relaxing enough and not doing any strenuous activity yet. her body will tell her when shes doing too much, for example passing large blood clots. its normal to bleed a lot though, just make sure she keeps an eye out for abnormally large ones and make SURE she takes it easy ok|`|XR4auwQ8aa	They told me, at the hospital if it was bigger than 1 inch to get them to look at it. I would run it by your midwife and keep an eye on any further bleeding. I think 6 days in is a bit late for a large clot.<br>  <br>  Take Care x|`|vNgDz5Jnaa	Yep that's totally normal. Try not to worry about it but if you're really worried, advise her to go the doctor and ask.|`|yUyx2nhmaa	yep|`|BQoPlsl3aa	you should for daf call your doc coz they do tell you bout abd clots and all,
IjkPBYlkaa	you can have it right after you have the baby i suggest waiting atleast for 6 weeks or else all the weight you gain during pregnacy will be really hard to lose lets just say it will take twice the time to burn it off

Felicidades.|`|f2a6f2e41be2652e7f4431a1db9c2e4daa	Cuando yo voy a arreglarme el cabello, veo a un sin numero de mujeres embarazadas cortándose el cabello o usando químicos. Las morenas (llamadas africo-americanas) acostumbran a ir semanalmente al salón de belleza pues tienen que estirar su cabello profesionalmente. Los químicos que usan resecan y parten el cabello por lo cual acostumbran a recortárselo una o dos veces al mes y si lo llevan muy corto lo hacen con esta frecuencia para mantener la forma de su recorte. Esto lo hace aunque esten embarazadas. Si hubiera una relacion los salones de belleza ya lo hubieran advertido o prohibido.
2184dd96bf7e305613ddd13f9cbeec4aaa	I would demand to have the Progesterone checked. I have PCOS and it does tend to make you have lower progesterone. I was also taking Metformin when I conceived. My doc and a perinatalogist said to stop taking the Metformin at 12 weeks pregnant as it can harm the baby after that. <br>  I work for a doctor so as soon as I found out I was pregnant I ran a progsterone test and it was low, my doc put me on progesterone pills until week 12. My best friend also had this problem, she kept misscarrying until they found out she had low progesterone and once they put her on meds she had a successful pregnancy|`|f3tGAH5vaa	i would ask him one more time to take the test and then if he didn't want to do it i would like for an other doctor that would do it. A second opinion is always good|`|lfaWNouzaa	It is never inappropriate to ask for a second opinion. You are right. Why don't you undergo consultation to other OB-Gyne doctors. It would be a great help for you.|`|d7J9WCSOaa	YES!!<br>  What I did was stay on met during pregnancy AND  find a doctor who put me on progesterone supplements immediately.<br>  That is from experience.  It's the only thing that helped me to get my children here after several miscarriages.  And it took being insistent to get it.<br>  Pulling for you!!|`|2948423bf32d621c192777b791381727aa	maybe
e298a5f6160975d21c9e41ccf16aade3aa	It depends on what you believe.  I just tell my kids that God wanted that person back with him.  I tell them we will all get a chance to be together again when we go back to see God as well.  They are usually fine with that.|`|73d7612c8b58ce2a391689bb8c7a7f2faa	Well, it all depends on what you believe in (or don't). We just went through this with my 5 y/o because my SIL (his aunt) passed away on saturday. We told him that she had gone to heaven to be with Jesus. That she wouldn't be hurting any more (she was very sick). He understood this as we attend church regularly and it's our belief. <br>  Whatever you believe in, tell them what you feel happens to one when they pass. You know your child best and know what they can understand. Talk to them openly and honestly about what you believe and what you think happens to one when they die.|`|iIgjg66Laa	Depends on the age of the child, but there are several good books that can be read to a child.  One of them is: <br>  <br>  "Water bugs and Dragon Flies" by Doris Stickney|`|yJ58Xcl4aa	For me it would depend on how close that person was to the child. My sister told her daughter that our grandpa had gone look after some lost sheep and he would always be in her heart.
mzbiB39zaa	take a test, i know its hard but its the best thing to do. <br>  You are unlikely to be pregnant as your bady hasnt got into a cycle yet but there is still a possibility. It isnt good to worry about things like that so put your mind at rest. |`|ZncV5gc0aa	Since you were breastfeeding you don't ovulate and you don't have a period. Who knows when you will ovulate again, since you stopped nursing... so keep using protection. |`|avx7bLnKaa	besides what everyone else said [i don't need to say it again]<br>  <br>  you need to also remember that it may take a while for your period to return even if not pregnant.... you can ovulate now because you are not fulltime breastfeeding thus you can get pregnant... ubt your periods may be late or irregular because you are still partially breastfeeding.....|`|YJnj54tHaa	my son was born 7/31/08 nd i had this scare too bust we used condoms. take a test.. im telling you its better to know than not to know. if it happens again and you get scared, go to the pharmacy and get plan b, its a contraceptive for the morning after. it will not be effective if you already are pregnant though. Good luckk!|`|MEVg0LBGaa	breast feeding and pulling out are NOT contraception. the is still sperm in pre-ejaculate, therefore still chance of pregnancy.<br>  <br>  the only way you will know is too take a test, as you cannot use your period as an indicator.|`|omfxPGyraa	I got pregnant while breastfeeding.  Pull out method is not very effective. Take the test!!  And enjoy baby #3.  |`|Fa130w6Gaa	Yes, it is possible for you to get pregnant even if he pulled out. It only takes 1 sperm! Since you are still breastfeeding, even though only at night, it is possible that you just haven't gotten your period yet. Worry about it can also delay your period. Just take a test and see. You need to know either way. Good luck!|`|qrVrkooRaa	it is absolutely possible dear!!!! It is very likely that if your periods were normal previously to having the child that you could be pregnant. You are more prone to getting pregnant shortly after the birth of a child. Be careful and don't rely on pulling out. It is not effective at all and you should go buy a test ASAP! Tell your hubby to go buy some condoms!!!|`|Xq9iLKoIaa	Do the pregnancy test just so you don't worry.<br>  <br>  I've breastfed two kids for a total of six years, not bleeding is normal when you are breastfeeding. It doesn't mean you are pregnant.<br>  <br>  Don't panic, but do the test. Then use a condom.<br>  <br>  The withdrawal method... I have my son thanks to it!|`|zATQaiwIaa	Yes its true that semen can still "sneak up in there."  I learned that when i was in high school YEARS ago.  there are reasons you are told to wait 6 weeks, its for your body to heal and so you can be put back on birth control!!!!!!!<br>  <br>  Take the test|`|OoBhPOkyaa	Pulling out early does not mean you won't get pregnant, ejaculation and sperm are a little more complicated than that.|`|AA11004428	i dont understand what breastfeeding has to do with it. are you sure youre even old enough or ready to have another baby? i mean shouldnt you know these things? |`|etqcUt3taa	Sounds like you need to take a preg test hon. It sounds pretty unlikely to me but better to be sure. x|`|4opLqGDOaa	yes it is possible to get pregnant while breast feeding. just take a test!|`|QE5VvVC8aa	yes, you could be pregnant but just take a test.. its been long enough. and its also possible that having a baby threw off your cycle, thats normal but the only way to find out it take a test.. |`|r7CiJMtUaa	I think u should just wait even thouw he pulled out u can still be possible to get sperm in there even if he was to clean with a towel sperm is all over it until he washes it with soap really good brestfeeding and having sex. makes no difference u can still get pregnant. There's a 50/50 chance i would wait like 2 weeks and if u don't get ur period u might be pregnant if not ur body is getting used to your cycle again but just to be on the safe side use protection next time! Tell me how it goes!!!
9WHX7ZXxaa	Kehamilan hanya akan terjadi apabila terjadi pertemuan antara sel kelamin jantan dan sel kelamin betina. Dalam hal ini, sel kelamin jantan adalah Sperma, dan sel kelamin betina adalah Ovum.<br>  <br>  Sel kelamin jantan, dalam rangka bertemu dengan sel kelamin betina dan mengalami pembuahan, akan terjadi bila ada ovum, dan seperti kita ketahui, ovum hanya ada di bagian alat kelamin wanita.<br>  <br>  Pembuahan akan terjadi apabila Sperma masuk ke dalam liang senggama wanita dan hanya akan terjadi jika sel sperma bertemu dengan sel ovum di sana. Biasanya terjadi pembuahan pada bagian rahim, namun tidak tertutup kemungkinan juga terjadi pembuahan di tuba vallopi ( leher indung telur). Hamil hanya akan terjadi jika terjadi pertemuan sel Sperma dan Sel Ovum. Terkadang, ketika mereka bertemu, pembuahan juga tidak terjadi. Hal ini disebabkan banyak hal. salah satunya adalah sel sperma yang tidak sehat. ( ini akibat pria kurang fit). dan ini merupakan salah satu problem mengapa ada pasangan yang tidak menghasilkan keturunan dalam waktu yang lama.<br>  <br>  Mulut, merupakan saluran yang berbeda dengan saluran kelamin. Tentunya sel sperma yang masuk ke mulut tidak akan menghasilkan kehamilan karena tidak terjadi pertemuan sel kelamin jantan dan betina. Kehamilan tidak akan mungkin terjadi jika sperma keluar dan masuk ke mulut.<br>  <br>  |`|18DprWncaa	jijik bnget wa dengerinnya but gmana carana hamil kyakna gak dehh|`|10avRdr2aa	gagh hamil <br>  <br>  <br>  paling tuh cwe muntah2 !<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  hahahahahahahaha|`|1Qgrq1Taaa	Kehamilan Terjadi Karena Bertemu nya Sel Telur Yang Berada Pada Rahim Wanita Dengan Sel Sperma Yang Berada Pada Laki - Laki ...

GpdYgi4Zaa	when I test I make sure I didnt drink anything for at least 2-3 hours so my pee isnt concentrated. Ive also read that you shouldnt use your first urine for ovulation. so I would pee in the morning..than test later at around 10am or 2pm and pee and hope for a result. I always get a negitive at night like after dinner cause my pee is so concentrated. so try not to drink anything for a while before you test.|`|MHQkgpdqaa	buy new one|`|mCDopsLEaa	dilution will result in negative. same with pregnancy tests. it is advised not to take after drinking alot of water, soda, etc. as it may not be accurate.
ijDfRIyoaa	Yes I did, I think it has a different affect on you if your a parent because it's about losing a child.<br>  But it is still one of my favourite movies, it is great and Angelina Jolie fit the part perfectly.<br>  <br>  I think its appropriate for 14 and 16 year olds.<br>  <br>  :)|`|LwbwMFX9aa	it is NOT good for a 14 yr old. this movie is rated r  due to children being murdered|`|esVYVUAEaa	It is good.

um29wkUPaa	It was very early, soon after we started.  All I did was make the sign for Milk or Cookie every time I said the word.  If I said Milk three times in a conversation, I made sure I did the sign every time.  I didn't ask him/her to do it back to me though.  <br>  <br>  Over time, very soon afterwards, they would do the sign.  It's a survival skill in communication and where they can't talk, they know that by mimicing that hand movement, it's a communication.<br>  <br>  We used sign for basic words they need.  Milk, eat, juice, mommy, daddy, play, happy, wet... I can't remember them all (they're 6 and 9 now).  It was a FANTASTIC alternative to whining, which is what kids will do if they can't communicate.|`|sw2R5A9iaa	this is a great age -never compare.  continue teaching as ASL is recognized in the schools as a 2nd language.|`|e8cnMHpDaa	I started signing with my son since birth and did not produce his first sign until he was 5 months...his first sign was milk but when he would make the gesture he was not communicating yet he would just randomly make the sign...it was not until about 8 months that he started to sing 'dad'...<br>  <br>  He is now 12 months old and knows many signs and communicates with us A LOT...it is so much fun to know what our baby is thinking otherwise we would never know  he is hungry or simply wants to tell us about the man in the store who is wearing a hat and he has noticed him...<br>  <br>  Now that he is a little older he picks up the signs a lot quicker....I recommend "Baby Signing Time" videos they are the best and the babies love it!!  That helped me with the signing a whole lot.<br>  <br>  Some of the signs my son can make now are: wash hands, hat, dad, mom, water, shoes, grandpa, more, eat, milk, juice, change diaper, frog, cat, dog, fish, and a few more I can't recall now....
hstwNjNaaa	When you're okay to get up and do stuff again, do a little something for her for the same amount of time she's looked after you. So if she took care of you for two weeks, get a her a card, a flower, chocolates, dinner, a kiss etc (anything nice!) for two weeks to show her how much you appreciate her!|`|FZQ2KHDvaa	Right now, just let yourself heal.  When you are better, take her out to dinner.  As a way of saying thanks.|`|7mYsoMUvaa	Believe me, if you just tell her how amazing she is she will appreciate it! Maybe get her a nice bunch of flowers and chocolates? Or prepare a romantic dinner for the two of you?|`|U4MyeZd2aa	tell her everything on your mind, and just be yourself!|`|OqQPzYfHaa	get her some roses|`|zRgPoJtraa	Rest for a while and when your fully recovered take her camping in a solitary place beside a lake were theres no one else my boyfriend did this for me once and it was real romantic sleeping out under the stars and having a dip in the lake at midnight.

l4mMBe5Aaa	My daughter loves to get kisses (she better like it - she gets plenty of them!), but is very stingy when it comes to giving them out...  She's now 12 months old, but still has a pretty open-mouthed kiss.  She will kiss me when I leave for work (heartbreaking!), or when she feels like it (super sweet!), but almost never on command.  Mostly, if I say "Give mommy a kiss", she'll pretend like she's going to, but then turn away at the last second and laugh.|`|3RFu4W38aa	My baby does love kisses all over her body, they make her giggle. My nephew was like your son, loved kisses a LOT. I would say eat it up and enjoy, because you never know when that may end, kids grow up fast! Soon he'll find you "icky", lol.|`|MavosJHYaa	I just developed pictures of my mother-in-law trying to kiss my 4/12 month old daughter on the cheek and every time she would try, DD turns her head and gives a huge open mouth kiss. It looks like she is trying to eat my MIL's face off. Soo funny. She also loves the kissy monster game :)|`|J2bnw5EZaa	It is ok!  My son loves kisses and I think that is how we keep passing this cold back and forth.  It's ok.  Makes me smile.|`|MQp40L2gaa	Whats so bad about that? Its cute... My son doesnt laugh about kisses but he gets PLENTY of them from his mommy and daddy <3|`|AA10826403	all baby's love kisses. Mine really like them too.
P0Fjh59Eaa	My oldest son never ate "baby food" he hated all of it and preferred what we were eating, only it was mashed up for him. which was kinda like baby food anyways so i have no idea what his deal was! lol<br>  <br>  My middle son was about 8 or 9 months old. He was a Chunk too and ate well and loved almost all of the variety they had.<br>  <br>  My daughter never really took to baby food either, she preferred breast milk and cereal w/a little applesauce in it. once she was around 9 mths she wanted what we were eating and so got tiny bites of it.<br>  <br>  My youngest son never had baby food. He was breast feed and just refused to eat baby foods. Again i just chopped stuff into tiny pieces and he ate w/us.<br>  <br>  There's no rule that says babies have to eat baby foods and quite honestly i probably saved thousands of dollars by not buying that crap.|`|n6XYYyoLaa	do u mean stage 2 foods? he should prob be on stage 3 at this point, almost ready for table food....you will probably have to make his a little different, let him eat with you guys, then give him some jarred food if he's still hungry....|`|XmJZkFuMaa	My daughter is 15 months old and she still gets 2nd foods.  For the most part, she gets table-food.  I mean, almost 90% of her diet is just normal food.  But there's certain babyfoods in the 2nds category (the DHA oatmeal/granola mixed with fruits and veggies) that she still likes.  It's an easy way for me to ensure she's getting her veggies (she likes the harvest veggie of this line) and it's a good "dessert" for her to have a fruit-gelatin (which is basically what this stuff is) after eating well.  <br>  <br>  Really it's up to you, but if you feel like he's not getting enough right now then let him have the table-food like you have been, and then babyfood afterwards to fill in the gaps.<br>  <br>  Add:  I don't know about her being a very picky eater (except for her not liking meat.)  She eats just about everything we put in front of her.  Just sometimes we follow it up with a baby-food chaser to make sure she got enough.  She's very small for her age, and I prefer not taking my chances that she might not get enough.  She LOVES broccoli and cauliflower, steamed carrots, steamed sweet-peas, sandwiches, and actually hates anything runnier than the babyfood I mentioned.  Mac&cheese is a standby favorite, and really just about anything we've tried.  Sometimes she just doesn't get enough and that's when we use the babyfood.<br>  <br>  At under a year though, we were doing a lot of babyfood.  A lot of times we thickened it with her oatmeal.  She saw our food as things to try out, and just wouldn't eat enough.|`|48b2b41f5c4a3bc51bd8f89661550c98aa	We were pretty much done with jarred baby food at 8 months.  My son was eating table foods at 6 1/2 months and feeding himself at 7 months.  You need to slowly transition to table food so that he doesn't only wanted pureed food.  Children who get too used to pureed food, tend to be picky eaters, due to the smooth consistency of jarred food.  Even 3rd foods are still pretty smooth and just have a few chunks of food in them, but it is better than 2nd foods.  I really suggest sticking to table food.  He is definately old enough to feed himself.|`|EFYkci30aa	Lol, I saw this question and just had to answer it!  My son who is over 2, still eats the green vegetable 2nd and 3rd baby foods!!  It's the only way I can get hime to eat green veggies!  Regular peas. . .no way, Gerber baby food peas. . .YUM!  Same with garden vegetables, green beans, and mixed veggies.  He won't eat any of that raw or cooked.  Baby food is obviously good for babies, keep giving it to him until you are comfortable stopping.  It can't hurt him.  My son will have "normal" people food, say pizza or PB&J with a side of baby food:-)  He loves it and it's great for him.|`|1dueLOdvaa	My oldest was 8 months when he wouldn't eat baby food anymore.<br>  <br>  My youngest was 6 1/2 months old when he refused baby food.<br>  <br>  I never went to stage three. I then started them on table foods.|`|AA10622097	My children started eating table food when they were a year old, I used very little baby food in jars, and then for the first year only.|`|J2bnw5EZaa	My son DISLIKED baby food period.  I had to get a manual food processor and mash up what we ate starting at 6-7 months.  He goes to a home daycare and I think that he loves the way the 3 sisters cook and baby food wasn't cutting it. My daughter stopped stage 2 at 7months or so.|`|AA10826403	I stopped feeding my son baby food when he was a little over a year. He started wanting what we were eating which was great and made it so much easier. He may just not be ready, no worries, all kids are different, He'll let you know when hes ready. Good Luck.
ca9dEvSAaa	Congradulatons! I'm so excited for you! I hope you have a wonderful birth!|`|zKEgGwhxaa	That's exciting, I know how you feel, my baby girl is due on Wednesday!  My doctor sent me to the hospital on Tues after my appointment and they said they are definitely going to induce that evening or the next morning because of high blood pressure, so we called everyone in our family, but then the nurse came in and said the doctors changed their minds since my blood pressure wasn't getting any higher.  So it was a little disappointing, but we're hoping she doesn't take too much longer to get here!  Good luck and congrats!|`|MuflptJVaa	congratulations!<br>  Sweet name :D<br>  <br>   It's obious that you already feel a bon with the little nudger inside you.You've been with "him" 4 at least 8 months.Hope all goes well and that u have a "gr8 time" with the little one.Hope he doesn't wake you up 3 am in the morning when he's about 3 months old!|`|fMhXju8baa	well congrats!!!

I'm so happy for you you are just going to love being a mommy!!!|`|eabe4c3a6e53ede1a2078c8d7dfcf4b7aa	good luck sweetie.|`|4e67Pdfvaa	great news...  get some meals in your freezer and the house ready!  congratz
JjU4L8L7aa	i definitely feel that way especially since im a hairdresser i see alot of really cute hair cuts, but ill tell you what i tell my clients (and myself lately), first of all when you have a small child you need low maintenance hair, which for alot of moms is long hair that you can pull back easy that you dont neccesarily need to blow dry and style, however if you have crazy curly hair it may be more high maintenance to be long, and second your hormones are crazy right now and you could just be looking for a change or a pick me up, but i tell people to just think on it for awhile that way you can decipher if it was just an off the wall thought or you really want it... also i tell people to just go in baby steps and cut alittle off at a time that way you can get used to it and if you do regret it, atleast it wasnt too short...good luck|`|0lOGuMYNaa	Trust Me...dont cut your hair! I did that because I thought it would be easier...and Boy was I wrong! With long hair you can put it up or pull it back and you're dont..w/ short hair you have to take time to style it. That's way im growing it out! =)|`|Oq2B7I4faa	with my first daughter I had very long hair and I cut mine very short when she turn two month old.  Now I am 37 week pregnant and I cut my hair very short again last week.|`|ybexjS2Paa	Yep, it's been driving me crazy for 14 months now :) Problem is I have curly hair and can't see myself cutting it off.|`|MDgVPwU3aa	yep|`|rdpEvwyUaa	yes! after both my babies i had my hair cut into a bob - much easier! :-)|`|Fd4lITkvaa	I have curly hair so it's harder to deal with short, at least long I can just pull it back. It's been tempting to just shave my head though, not that I ever would, but it's tempting.|`|pXSKSS3daa	Yep, and I did.<br>  <br>  It was probably right below my shoulder blades before I cut it and now it's up to my shoulders. It's soooooo much easier to look after now and Noah doesn't get a handful easily.|`|1tmX7xbRaa	yes. my hair was almost to my waist and after a few months of it getting pulled on and throwing it back in a pony tail for lack of any time to do anything else with it. so i ended up cutting it all off. and when i say all of it i mean it went from my waist to a little higher then my chin. now i wish i didn't do it but oh well|`|rAkWoweOaa	Mine is very long. My son is 5 months and yes it is a pain, but I hate short hair on me, so I leave it long. I just pull it back a lot.|`|zwctZ812aa	I'm cutting all mine off mainly because I'm tired of my son pulling it out all the time!! He just loves to hang onto it when I'm holding him.|`|fe6fcbf713d0ed0538de9c9304001a52aa	No, and I have two now.  I keep it the same lengths as I always did.|`|iOSEVRPPaa	OMG, yes!  When my baby was 8 weeks, I went to the salon and said - I want a cut where I can jump out of the shower and just go.  Luckily, the guy did a great job.  And I love my cut.  I can just let it air dry and walk out the door.  It's great!|`|4iXL4C6paa	I have been considering chopping mine off to keep my little man from pulling it all out lol and yes it also is alot of work, I have 4 small children and I just dont have much time for hair lol I usually just throw mine up and go|`|QOvUS6xVaa	i thought about it but then i didnt do it. i just went a few inches shorter,, after a few month a went back to doing something with it,, cut into layers and had my hair " did" lol|`|IuJjYz6gaa	Nah, I just pull mine back and up in a messy bun all the time.<br>  <br>  That way if I want to leave it down or do something with it for a special occasion, I can.|`|WPI0Z47saa	No. My hair is below the center of my back and I just carried a band on my arm and if it got it the way I put it in a pony tail.|`|jPIyZRTqaa	Yes...totally.  All he did was barf in it, hang on it, get tangled u up in it.<br>  <br>  It's now short and way better.  I felt like a wild cavewoman before.|`|JnLoHaoAaa	Yes! Especially since my hair is long and super curly. It's just a pain in the butt|`|sw2R5A9iaa	never -use a clip or ponytail holder.  see your hairdresser for a new style.

I like Haylie Marie for a girl and for a boy I like Tyler Mitchell and Shawn Avery|`|CTmWS6dMaa	I like Samantha but don't care for Raynelle. Samantha Brielle sounds prettier. <br>  <br>  Natalie Taylor is very pretty and I don't usually care for Taylor. It works well in this combo though.<br>  <br>  Jenna Marie sounds dull to me. Try Jacinda or Marielle to spice it up a bit. <br>  <br>  Haylie Sienna is okay. <br>  <br>  From your boys<br>  <br>  I really like Avery, Christopher Gianni, and Nicholas Orlando. <br>  <br>  Shawn is a bit dull and I have seen to many little Tylers lately.|`|D0pQFlMIaa	Natalie Taylor is my fave, don't really know why. Pretty but strong I guess. I like Samantha, Jenna, Haylie and Sienna because they are very pretty. but not Raynelle (kinda wierd) or Marie (the most common middle name ever). <br>  <br>  I like the last 3 best for boys. They sound like they'd be popular and maybe a movie star, but not so much that it seems like you're trying too hard. Very classic. I don't like Avery because it seems a little feminine to me. I like the sound of Shawn, but none of the spellings appeal to me (Shawn, Shaun, Sean). Mason seems too trendy.<br>  <br>  Hope that helps.|`|MQp40L2gaa	Natalie Taylor is OK, so is Jenna Marie but the boys names arent much better, Shawn Avery is cute.|`|5b73ZOhkaa	Girl<br>  Natalie Taylor- Really Modern Hip Name<br>  <br>  Boy<br>  Christopher Gianni- It Sounds Handsome<br>  <br>  <br>  Why do people fking answer this questions if they bother them!|`|DyI2XKsMaa	haylie sienna<br>  <br>  and shawn avery

Slowly add the cold water and knead, making a soft dough. Cover with a damp cloth and set aside for 1-2 hours. <br>  <br>  Divide the dough into 10 portions and roll each one into a round ball. Flour your working surface and roll (here's where your rolling pin takes place =]) each one into a round pancake about 5-6" in diameter. Shake off the excess flour and set aside until they are all done. You can also start cooking after the first one is dome. Heat an iron frying pan or Tawa on medium heat. Oil the pan and place the chapatti on the pan and cook for about a minute or bubbles start to appear and then turn over. The chapattis might puff up on their own or place over a gas flame for a few seconds. Place the chapattis between napkins until ready to be served.
I8lFqyyFaa	Yes, I had this experience.  I lost a lot of weight initially after childbirth, but then regained some pounds while breastfeeding.  I didn't lose those and the rest of the baby weight until my child was weaned.  Something about the nursing hormones, I guess.|`|Fd4lITkvaa	As strange as it sounds I had to eat more to lose weight while breastfeeding. If I cut calories and exercised I actually gained weight. I got fed up and made myself a chocolate cake and lost 5lbs. Backwards I know but it worked for me. I lost the last of my weight at 9 months and am now 7lbs under my prepregnancy weight at 11 months.|`|zlGb9NkZaa	i've had a hard time losing weight. i read somewhere that some women actually have the OPPOSITE effect to bfing (gaining or retaining wt) because of different hormone levels. i noticed when my girl started eating solids more than bfing (she's one now) i started losing more weight. it's one reason i'm looking forward to weaning!|`|sw2R5A9iaa	increase your physical activity -put the kid in a back pack or in a bike seat and get outside.  eat smaller more balanced meals.  avoid processed foods and drink more water.  see your doctor to rule out a medical cause.

P7jug5GSaa	The large the baby gets the slower the heart beat will be.  Our hearts don't beat that fast because we are large, so it is absolutly normal that the bigger your child gets, it will slow down...  It is good that there is a variety in his heart rate.  That is perfectly normal|`|I91DbTXFaa	You Win the award for most disturbing Yahoo Avatar ever!|`|kvUIjNJqaa	my first appointment the heart rate was 163 the last appt it was 148 you just listened to it while the baby decided to nap you only have a little while to go and that baby is getting bigger and bigger so that means it has less room to move and swim all over so less activity makes for a slower heart rate. to reassure yourself lay on your back and watch the kicking. you will be fine and good luck|`|nynF5phSaa	The heart rate will change depending on the activity of the baby.  If the baby was sleeping, the heart rate will drop.  If the baby is kicking and wiggling the heart rate will go up.  Honestly, there is no need to worry about the change in heart rate.  As the baby gets bigger there is less room to move, so there is less workout room.|`|n7da31KOaa	He may have been sleeping, was he active the other times you had it checked?  Also sometimes there machines get a little screwy or pick up your heartbeat, which is slower than baby's.  I wouldn't worry, you should be doing your kick counts by now and as long as those don't slow down, your good.  Good luck!|`|t72BUaRBaa	I just had an ultrasound yesterday (at 30 weeks and 2 days).  She was sleeping the entire time, and her heart rate was 132.  The ultrasound tech said that it is completely normal at this stage, especially for a sleeping baby.  No worries!!  And Good Luck!!|`|1ffc303db15fdc00d04d05f7b03f2f53aa	Don't worry.  When I was pregnant with my daughter, her heart rate fluctuated between 133 - 160.  I am currently 21 weeks pregnant with a boy and his heart rate has already fluctuated between 136 -160.  A lot can depend on if the baby is sleeping or active.  Your doctor would tell you if there was any cause for concern.|`|17ae94f98003e0b9fdcbfa3f8583e9f1aa	Yes, its normal.  Normal range at that gestational age is usually 120 to 160 or so, give or take. <br>  <br>  Also, its good that it varies.  The doctor told me they like to see a 15-point variation in the heartbeat in a short period of time, like 5 minutes or so.  Trust the doctor -- why would they lie and tell you its OK when its not?
AA11191613	i'm a little freaked out by my blood pressure myself.. i'm 38 weeks and when i have been getting mine taken they keep saying its lower than normal.. eeek.. <br>  i think in your situation they will probably induce the baby and keep you monitored.. its a good idea to ask your doctor what your options are.|`|2ed0d0090ad4c96539ccb5a473beaab4aa	yes sometimes when the mothers blood presure is real high they well induce labor but dont be afraid your baby wont be very early my daughter was 2 month early and shes just fine now .if they didnt hospitialize you yesterday then they obivoulsy thought it might go down on its own they proubly want you to come back tommorow just to be on the safe side|`|2c9fb68d35230128c7dbc70667cf4512aa	they are more likely to keep you in hospital to keep an eye on you till you av the baby|`|7886cc89bfcd97a6875d46bee945acb8aa	that all depends on you im glad taht you wentto the doctors now he will make the right choice for you good luck|`|AA10972504	they'll be giving you pills or get u in the hospital over night...depends on what the doctor thinks|`|ba30c9b84725091dfcbb402b4a73f45aaa	They'll do more test, like protein in urine.

I8lFqyyFaa	You don't say how long you've been nursing.  In the early months it's common to have an overabundance before your body adjusts to what your baby actually needs.  That's a great time to pump and store milk if you'll be going back to work or need it for a later date.  You can donate milk too - I found a list of milk banks here. <a href="http://www.breastfeeding.com/all_about/all_about_milk_banks2.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.breastfeeding.com/all_about/a...</a>|`|Fd4lITkvaa	How old is your baby? I was the same way the first few months then after that my body adjusted supply to make only what my son needs. It's much more comfortable but I have nothing extra to pump anymore. I didn't regularly pump though, my over supply caused my son to get too much foremilk which resulted in an upset belly.|`|fe6fcbf713d0ed0538de9c9304001a52aa	<a href="http://www.kellymom.com/bf/pumping/pumping_decrease.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.kellymom.com/bf/pumping/pumpi...</a><br>  What is normal when it comes to pumping output and changes in pumping output?<br>  <br>  Most moms who are nursing full-time are able to pump around 1/2 to 2 ounces total (for both breasts) per pumping session. Moms who pump more milk per session may have an oversupply of milk, or may respond better than average to the pump, or may have been able to increase pump output with practice. Many moms think that they should be able to pump 4-8 ounces per pumping session, but even 4 ounces is an unusually large pumping output.<br>  <br>  It is quite normal to need to pump 2-3 times to get enough milk for one feeding for baby (remember that the pump cannot get as much milk as a baby who nurses effectively).<br>  <br>  Many moms are able to pump more milk per session when they are separated from baby. Milk pumped when you are nursing full-time is "extra" milk -- over and beyond what baby needs. Don't get discouraged if you are trying to build up a freezer stash when nursing full time and don't get much milk per pumping session -- this is perfectly normal and expected.<br>  <br>  It is very common to have more milk than baby needs in the early weeks, which regulates down to baby's needs over the first few weeks or months. When your milk supply regulates (this change may occur either gradually or rather suddenly), it is normal for pumping output to decrease. For moms who have oversupply, this change often occurs later (6-9+ months postpartum rather than 6-12 weeks).|`|mqvxIgRdaa	PROB YOU WILL BE|`|sw2R5A9iaa	nope cuz demand=supply.

0nZrPxPeaa	Try Planned Parenthood.  They aren't just for birth control, they also have pediatricians and they will help you with Medicaid and you probably won't even need a copay.  If you can't get places, look up your city's bus system or make friends with a generous friend with a license.  Your situation sucks, and I'm sorry about that, but it sounds like you need to get out of your mother's house because she isn't helping.  If you do end up going to PP, ask them how to get other assistance, like food stamps and social security.  Also, you are eligible to send your son to Head Start so you can work and make a bit of money.  There is plenty of help for people who are willing to work for it.|`|i9QFC9apaa	Um Hi lyssa, as we've discussed im the last person to talk to about babies,lol, but im sure you do qualify for some help.|`|jvHIqtp2aa	Being a 15 year old, single mom, you qualify for all kinds of assistance. Don't wait for your mom to help you, you are a mother now. Start making some phone calls to your local health dept. etc. Be persistent that they direct you to the right people to talk to. You should qualify for medicaid for your son and his medical bills will then be taken care of. In my state, you would have received that when you were pregnant. You need to get your high school diploma and I am sorry but its time to grow up quickly. It isn't your mother's job anymore, you made that decision when you had irresponsible sex outside of marriage and now have a child. Good luck.|`|rdpZrBc9aa	He's just getting overheated.  He needs his own crib, or at least lighter blankets.  It's time you start taking responsibility for your child.  Don't wait for her to show you.  Try it yourself and ask if you need help.  I don't understand about re-registering for insurance, but you need to get this taken care of.  If it's something your mom has to do, remind her, nicely, until it gets done.  Go with her so you can learn about how it works.  Your baby needs to be having regular checkups and all the childhood immunizations.  <br>  <br>  All babies are born with a soft spot on the tops of their skulls.  It's to make childbirth a little easier.  It usually closes up by maybe age 2?  It sounds like your son's soft spot is closing.  That's normal.<br>  <br>  Time to grow up now!|`|jEtqDiTWaa	Alot of people sweat alot..so I dont think that this is that big of deal...but the lump under the cross should definately be checked out.

Please dont let your son suffer because of no insurance.  You are 15 and he is ELIGIBLE for medicaid.  Maybe you should just put him on a onesie and no footies and socks.

I didn't start vomiting untill I was about 4-6weeks and before that the first symptom  I got was i was very tired and dizzy.<br>  <br>  but you might just be pregnant! so just wait it out awhile that's the best you can do unless you get a blood test those can detect pregnancy a few days after conception. good luck!|`|rdpZrBc9aa	Sorry, you just won't know for a while!

a110d17d2efa9551adeba5b30532c00eaa	How to get Pregnant Faster – Top Ten Tips<br>  <br>  1. Have sex three times a week.<br>  <br>  Having regular sex is the best way to get pregnant. Couples often try to time everything perfectly for ovulation but do not have sex when they think they are not ovulating. It is true that sex that is not within the time of ovulation will not result in pregnancy. However, because women do not always ovulate when they think they will, having sex three times a week will help to a woman cover her bases, so to speak, and not miss an opportunity to get pregnant.<br>  2. Use an ovulation prediction kit or fertility monitor. <br>  <br>  Using an ovulation kit to predict when you are ovulating will improve your chances of getting pregnant. For many women charting or other methods of ovulation prediction are too confusing. Ovulation prediction kits work by reading LH surges prior to ovulation. They are relatively easy to use and are generally accurate for predicting ovulation. Fertility monitors, such as the Clear Blue Easy monitor, are also a worthwhile investment if you would like to get pregnant faster. Fertility monitors are similar to ovulation prediction kits in that they read changes in LH but they also read changes in other hormones and don’t require any guesswork for couples. They are easy to use and will tell you when the best time to get pregnant is.<br>  <br>  3. Have sex before ovulation (not after). <br>  <br>  Sometimes couples get confused about the best time to have sex in relationship to ovulation. You have a small window of time each month to get pregnant. After a woman ovulates the egg will survive approximately 24 hours. Sperm, on the other hand, will live for up to three to five days. This is why having sex two to three days before ovulation will increase your chances of getting pregnant. Don’t wait until the day you ovulate to have sex. Your partner’s sperm will last longer than your egg and you don’t want to miss an opportunity by waiting. <br>  <br>  4. Don’t rely on the Calendar method for predicting ovulation. <br>  <br>  A lot of couples have heard to have sex around day fourteen of your cycle. This is based on the calendar method and assumes that you have a regular 28-day cycle and ovulate mid-cycle. Although this is better than just picking an arbitrary day to have sex, it is not a very accurate way to predict when you ovulate. Many women do not ovulate on day fourteen and knowing precisely when you ovulate will help you time intercourse better. Ovulation prediction kits, looking at previous months bbt charts, or watching for body cues will help you to determine when you ovulate.<br>  <br>  5. Charting may not be the best way to predict ovulation. <br>  <br>  Charting is great for tracking your cycle but it does have disadvantages. By the time you can see ovulation on a bbt chart, you have already ovulated. It is good to chart so you can track your cycles, see if you ovulate the same time each month, and also so you can look back on your cycle and see if you timed things right. But if this is your first cycle trying to get pregnant or if you are not ovulating at the same time each month, an ovulation prediction kit would be more helpful.<br>  <br>  6. See a doctor before you start trying to get pregnant. <br>  Make sure you are in good health and have had a regular check up from your OBGYN or medical provider. Untreated infections, sexually transmitted diseases, or poor health can affect your chances of getting pregnant. Its good to see a doctor as well as start taking prenatal vitamins prior to trying to conceive.<br>  <br>  7. Don’t smoke, drink alcohol, or abuse drugs when trying to get pregnant. <br>  This may seem like common sense but many women do try to get pregnant while smoking, drinking or using drugs. Smoking, drugs, and alcohol can affect your fertility. It will also affect your unborn child. It is important to stop smoking or using drugs and alcohol before getting pregnant and not wait until you find out you are pregnant.<br>  <br>  8. Have enjoyable sex.<br>  <br>  Sometimes when couples are trying to conceive, sex becomes a job or function of reproduction and is not as enjoyable. Plan a romantic evening or try something different to spice things up. How you are feeling sexually may factor into your chances of getting pregnant. Some researchers believe that having an orgasm during sex increases your chances of getting pregnant. For women, the spasmic movements of orgasm will help pull the sperm into the uterus and for men a better orgasm may increase the man’s sperm count.<br>  <br>  9. Have sex in positions that keep sperm inside the vagina longer.<br>  <br>  The missionary position is a good position to use when trying to get pregnant. Avoid positions where the woman is on top. Gravity will allow sperm to leak out with these positions. Also try placing a pillow under your hips to help tilt your pelvis and keep the sperm in longer. Don’t get up right after sex. Try to relax and allow the sperm to stay in the vagina as long as possible.<br>  <br>  10. There is no such thing as trying too hard to get pregnant.<br>  Most couples get pregnant within a year of trying. If you have not gotten pregnant within a year consult your doctor for advice. <br>  <a href="http://www.justmommies.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.justmommies.com</a>|`|AA10275501	get the book how to choose the sex of your baby by dr. shettles.  it tells u how to "read" your body to find out the particular moment of ovulation.  it is sooo amazing.

I just purchased a Ovulation Scope. You can get them at any drug store. Its easier than peeing on a stick. And cheaper if you are going to be checking for months. It will give you a gauge when you are the most fertile.

cY8DgJv5aa	I also think 16 is the appropriate age to start dating.  I guess just because that's how I was raised, so it makes sense to me.  I was allowed to "date" prior to that (at 14 and 15), but it was only on group dates with friends and there was always a chaperon of some sort.  If we all went to the movies, then at least one parent was there too.  They didn't sit with us, but they were in the theater somewhere keeping an eye on things.  I found it perfectly acceptable.  Didn't bother me a bit.  My husband and I plan on incorporating the same rules with our children.|`|7wsYl1Gjaa	I think 16 is a good age, although some 16 year olds still might not be ready for it.  Obviously each teenager is different.  But dating is like other life experiences, people learn alot during dating, and everyone willl eventually go through it, so it might as well be at 16.  I really think that younger than that is too young to be in a serious relationship, although, you shouldn't think that your kids aren't kissing or maybe more before you allow them to date.  You can't really not allow them to do stuff like that, sometimes it just happens, and to be judgemental just cause lots of uneeded guilt that they will have to deal with.|`|pnL5WTXMaa	i guess it depends on what the date consisted of.... my son is 13 and if he wanted to take a girl to the movies or something, i would bring them. i wouldn't let them hang out in his room or anything... too young for that. my daughters on the other hand... are only 6 and 8 so we'll have to wait and see.... (30?) jk|`|PxawVQ7Xaa	Any age they want, they need to learn social skills, they just shouldn't have sex until they are adults.|`|z0ro3VkJaa	13-14 is when you can start "supervised dating", you know, where you are nearby at all times, you take the kids out somewhere to do something. Take them to the movies and sit a few rows back with your own date, that kind of thing.<br>  <br>  Around 16 is where you can start allowing "unsupervised dating", where the kids can go off somewhere on their own without you hovering nearby, so long as they still follow your curfew rules.<br>  <br>  Now, of course, if you are comfortable with a 13-15 year old your child is dating, you might decide to allow unsupervised dates, but that is entirely up to you and how well you feel you know this other person.|`|MQp40L2gaa	I think 16 is a good age to let your child start dating. By then they may have a car and are learning their responsibilitys, maybe having a job too. The main thing you should make known is that abstinence is the best way to go, but also teach them about protection (condoms) because really teens are going to do what they want to do when it comes down to it.|`|biBJAzUoaa	like 16-18|`|f66ce5d864eadcad29348fd4a9871771aa	i agree with 16. there is plenty of time for all that as they grow, no need to rush it.|`|prqrQcd1aa	I have 3 girls.. they will also be allowed to date at 16. why..because that was when i started dating, I would have been allowed to do so earlier, but I made a choice to wait until that age!
8XcRFF6Taa	Maybe when the oldest is about 5 or 6( as long as there is supervision, kids are curious by nature).  If you as the parent are comfortable with that.  I don't think it is a bad thing when kids ask questions, My son 4 still takes bathes with my daughter 17 months and occasionally still hops in the shower with me.  He knows he and daddy have boy parts and his sister and I have girl parts, not a big deal.|`|LwbwMFX9aa	my son is 5 and my daughter almost 4, they still bathe together, they are aware they are different and they dont obsess over it or make an issue out of it.<br>  <br>  sometimes when they undress my daughter will go there's his penis and ill be like yes and so what of it<br>  <br>  I think another year of bathing together just cause its easier and quicker than they can bathe alone|`|rBq189W1aa	My son is eight, my daughter is nearly five, and they still bathe together sometimes. They know what each other looks like naked, so it's no big deal to them.<br>  <br>  When one (or both) of them starts getting uncomfortable with it, I'll start bathing them separately. Usually though, these things are only a big deal if you make it into one.|`|H74F8jxuaa	I would say at the very very latest, 5.  At that age, that start to notice more things and ask a lot of questions like "Mommy, why does billy have a thingy hanging between his legs?" and it really isn't a good age to start telling stuff like that just yet.  Just my opinion.|`|fniHoVyaaa	about 3 years old, they start to understand that boys and girl have different parts at that age. My daughter is almost 3 and my son is 6 months and she looks at me funny when i change his diaper, and asks me why my son has a tail, lol.|`|zkbBdUXQaa	I would say around 3.<br>  Once they are 4 they understand better...maybe even 2 would be a good age to stop..Kids notice theirs differences and can become very very curious.|`|0781f56992749b6d9de1b9aa61424bbbaa	As long as there is nothing abusive going on, they can bathe toghether until either decides that they'd like a little more privacy (or until they can't comfortably fit in the tub together).  Mine made that decision a couple years ago, when the older was about 7yo.|`|sxecXFgraa	When they are no longer comfortable with it.  My kids are 7 and 10 and they stopped bathing together maybe 2-3 years ago, I don't remember exactly when.  We never made a big deal about nudity and one day they just decided to stop.
j01zBZmZaa	Well, since he had no problem helping you conceive this child, I think you should worry a little less about his being upset and realize that your fears and worries are also valid. Just sit him down privately and spill the beans: there is no easy way to do it. You are both in college; you are both old enough and intelligent enough to make a wise decision. A baby is a blessing, and whatever decision you make, I wish you all the luck in the world. Be strong.|`|0UnmZdrJaa	I would tell him. If he loves you, he will be willing to make some changes in order to make it work. <br>  I believe in adoption only under special circumstances, and I don't think that your fear of disrupting your partner's "big dreams" would fall under that category.<br>  Most people who give up their children for adoption regret it every day for the rest of their lives. Besides, how do you know the child will get a better quality of life with someone else. AND, what if something happens and you and your boyfriend split up? Where would you be? Beating yourself up about that choice.<br>  I know this all sounds harsh, but you need to tell him. No matter how you do it, he needs to know.<br>  Plan a quiet dinner at home. You don't want to be in public... avoid causing a scene. Just make a nice meal at home and muster up the courage. See, if you do want to have the baby, you're going to have to tell him before he finds out and wonders why you didn't.|`|nPHJndGOaa	Honestly, the only way to tell him is to sit him down, and just say it. He is going to find out anyway, and yeah, he will be scared. But, you guys can discuss options and make a mutal choice on what to do. <br>  <br>  Just explain to him that it is possible to be a father and to have your dreams come true. It's harder, but it's 100% do-able!|`|bR4BgFLlaa	I got pregnant at 16 and both me and the father went to college and now have good careers. Although we did split up and I ended up with all the hard work! Its totally do able, but it is hard.<br>  <br>  As regards adopting or keeping the baby you will have to do some hard thinking and sit down with your partner to discuss your options, at the end of the day do what you know is the right thing for you in your heart. It is often easier these days to make the decision to keep a baby rather than give it up because society sees adoption as a negative thing when there is so much help for young families and single parents. <br>  <br>  However sometimes it is the only or the best option, if you decide to do this don't feel bad about it! there are many people out there who would love a child. It is a myth that most birth parents regret adoption for the rest of their lives. I have done extensive research in this area and this is the type of thinking that will pressurize you into keeping a child you're not ready for. Be careful, think hard.<br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|lA0PNkchaa	Adoption is always a great alternative.  There are many great families out there like my husband and I who want to adopt.  First you need to tell him.  Being honest with open communication is the best.  His plans will not be ruined and neither will yours.  If you work hard at your goals you can achieve anything that you desire.  Remember, there is also always help for you out there, you are not alone.|`|hpsPleM8aa	alright im a dude so i know you should find a time when he is in a good mood so he doesn't freak out. and just tell him.and then explain to him that he can still stay in should and if ur willig to taker care of him and have to baby vist him|`|2IATHTXwaa	Have an abortion it's the best thing to do|`|prqrQcd1aa	Just sit him down and tell him about it.. Tell him that he doesn't have to give up his dreams or ambitions...but that if you are going to keep it that he is going to have to help you out in some way with the child!|`|dR4QN0gHaa	You just have to tell him. Just because you are pregnant doesn't mean your plans are ruined. I got pregnant in college. Had the baby and still kept going to class. Actually there are a lot of programs designed to help younger parents and your financial aid may increase because of your new family. Once you have a child you take independent status and your financial aid isn't based on your parents. Contact the job and family services in your area and see what programs are available for you like food stamps, daycare assistance, wic, etc. You could do this research first and present it to him when you tell him.

I8lFqyyFaa	It's normal.  You may even be having normal postpartum bleeding up to the 6 week point.  Most women who aren't breastfeeding will have resumed having periods again by 4 months out, but it's an individual experience, so it's still normal if it hasn't returned.  You don't mention whether or not you're breastfeeding.  If you're breastfeeding it's typical to not have your period back yet.  It may be many months in that case before you see it again.|`|fe6fcbf713d0ed0538de9c9304001a52aa	If you are breastfeeding anything before 56 days post-partum isn't a real period.  You may not get your period the entire time you are breastfeeding, or you may get it back at any time.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lactational_amenorrhea_method" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lactational...</a><br>  Return of fertility<br>  <br>  Return of menstruation following childbirth varies widely among individuals. The closer a woman's behavior is to the Seven Standards of ecological breastfeeding, the later (on average) her cycles will return. Average return of menses for women following all seven criteria is 14 months after childbirth, with some reports being as soon as 2 months while others are as late as 42 months.[citation needed] Couples who desire spacing of 18 to 30 months between children can often achieve this through breastfeeding alone.<br>  <br>  Although the first post-partum cycle is sometimes anovulatory (reducing the likelihood of becoming pregnant again before having a post-partum period), subsequent cycles are almost always ovulatory and therefore must be considered fertile. However, some women find that breastfeeding interferes with fertility even after ovulation has resumed. Luteal phases being too short to sustain pregnancy is a common example.|`|sw2R5A9iaa	time to see your gyn.|`|IuJjYz6gaa	Take a pregnancy test.

5ImnKqsyaa	I agree with the other answers it sounds like it may have been a chemical pregnancy, it is the term given to a pregnancy that ends very early. Unfortunately, chemical pregnancies are actually quite common. In fact, between 50% and 60% of all first-time pregnancies are thought to end in miscarriage.When it comes to chemical pregnancies, many women don’t even realize that they have experienced one. This is because the vast majority of these miscarriages occur within the initial six weeks of pregnancy. During this time, typical signs of pregnancy are not always present just yet and a missed period may not have happened yet, making it somewhat unlikely for most women to take a pregnancy test. As a result, many women don’t even know that they were pregnant in the first place.<br>  <br>  However, because pregnancy tests are becoming increasingly sensitive, it is now possible for women to detect pregnancy up to 3 days before their period is due. As a result, more and more women are able to recognize their pregnancies ahead of time, making it more likely that women will detect a chemical pregnancy.<br>  <br>  Please don't let it worry you though honey just carry doing as you are doing and little bub will be with you soon x|`|67b593074209317bd1b3aab7850f7176aa	I am really not for sure but I think you should keep you appt for monday and just let your doctor know what happened.  You may have had an early miscarriage.  Which means that the sperm met the egg but as it was traveling down to be implanted there were inadequate nutrients and a miscarriage occurs.  The symptoms of this type of early miscarriage is bleeding that is usually later and heavier than your normal period, but most women just assume they’re having a late period and have no idea they were even pregnant.  So I would keep the appt just in case.  Hopefully I dont alarm you to much but I wanted to give you an honest answer.|`|56q4sy3Haa	Sounds like a chemical pregnancy. It happens quite a lot, especially for first pregnancy. Lots of women don't even notice it, because it resembles normal period. <br>  Don't dwell on it, just keep trying, and I hope you get your little one soon. x|`|Di7KqbVQaa	It could have been a chemical, which means things did not successfully implant, and AF arrives.<br>  <br>  Many women get this without realising in their lives. <br>  <br>  Good luck in the future xxxxxxxxx

I've actually got this obsessive compulsive thing that makes me like to use three periods at the same time...<br>  <br>  Women always complain about how they hurt, but I've been experiencing them for 22 years and haven't had any trouble with them. Sometimes they happen when they shouldn't.<br>  <br>  <br>  As for your symptoms, I think you are dying. Either that, you ate way too much for dinner. One time I went to an all you can eat seafood buffet. They had awesome crab legs, and the steak was really good, too. Needless to say, I ended up crying because I ate too much. I ate so much that I was tired, and it hurt to walk. All of the ice cream I had for dessert gave me a killer headache, too. The next morning, you didn't even want to be in the same building as me, instead of wind coming "from bottom" it more like hurricane coming "from bottom".<br>  <br>  Are you sure you didn't just eat a lot at a seafood buffet?

If it doesnt go away after a bath and a change of clothes.. its most likely not a heat rash though. Hives/allergic skin reactions can be localized.. so it is possible he is allergic to something. Best to check with his doctor just to be sure!|`|2019e5deef4c0f270a4ec62663690b34aa	it is either eczema , heat rash or the products you are using on his skin, renewall gel will help with his rash and for products that wont harm his skin try the neways range, the baby products are being re designed cause they had no preservatives in them and they were going off to quickly but there are other products there available like the bubble bath and the barrier cream, if you want to check out the gel go to<br>  <br>  www.kristie.4healthdirect.com<br>  <br>  and the neways products<br>  <br>  www.neways.com<br>  <br>  i hope this helps :).|`|676765d198deec8e708cda415fb84551aa	que que puro spa?ol|`|d01c3192a43dc4ff45372cd876b20685aa	you should definitely take him to the doctor just in case. But I would not worry too much.  My ten month old also develops rashes every now and then.  Usually his are on his hands and feet. I was just in the process of eliminating things to see if I can find whats causing it.   Finally turned out to be my DRYER sheets... My first son always broke out on his stomach and it took forever but finally realized it was the Johnsons and Johnsons lavender bed time lotion I was putting on him.  Though I rub it all over him the rash only appeared on his stomach.  I only say that to forewarn you that sometimes even the "baby" items can be the cause of the problem! Try to see if there is anything new you are using and change it first.  But wait a week before changing anything else, because it can take that long for the rash to go away. Best of luck~~|`|d153c90e59ac0021024025c84ecf55f8aa	Hey there,I think you should bring him to the skin doctor just in case.But I just saw in TV yesterday that he might be allergic to cow's milk.Are you still breastfeeding him or have you given him formula milk?Because they say these symptoms maybe allergic reaction to cow's milk.They also say it might be because of allergy to fish,but I doubt 10 months old eat fishes.It could also be eczema,or chicken pox(did he get immunised?).If he has fever and coughing,please please bring him to the doctor yeah!!Hope he recovers from it soon.

0e9e0fd70c4104cae7d4bb923534c3baaa	Well, as someone who works in an elementary school I see this same situation every single day. I can tell you a few things. First, that when parents try to choose their children's friends it only leads to the kid acting out worse (or begin to act out); not to mention children in elementary school are very blatant and you don't want a bunch of parents calling you mad that you said their daughter's were mean- even if they are. Second, kids change friends on a daily basis; especially girls, one day they are best buds the next mortal enemies- give her skills to work with the mean kids not against them and help her learn about self confidence and self respect so in the future she will have the tools to handle any mean girl. Third, sometimes one nice child who has a good conscience can rub off in a good way on the kids who tend towards teasing and rule-breaking. The best way to get her through this situation is not to demand she stay away from these girls; but to start conversations you should continue althroughout her school life and beyond. She will be a stronger person if she has a mom who tells her that it's okay to be friends with everyone, but sometimes those friends aren't real buddies and only want to use you to be mean to other's. Real friends are the ones who will stick around when you are in trouble or sad or not wearing Hannah Montana or the latest and coolest clothes.|`|h6YdTiyUaa	She is too young to understand how mean the other girls' behaviors are so it probably wouldn't do you a whole lot of good to talk to her. She will learn and there isn't much a parent can do to stop it. It will only get worse up until about high school and then the "meanness" drops off a bit. However, if she is being mean to other kids, then you can explain to her that that's not nice, and if she continues, punish her.|`|z0ro3VkJaa	So these girls are mean because they don't let other children play together...<br>  <br>  So your brilliant solution is to not let your daughter play with them...<br>  <br>  Hmm...|`|SLSX6QQsaa	Tell her a little story about a lonely little girl who went home and cried every day because the mean girls picked on her at school.  Make the story as sad as possible, maybe even find a real story about this online and put it in little kid terms so she will understand.  My Mom and Dad always told me about things like that and I always was nice to everybody, even the kids that nobody else was nice to.  Funny thing was, I had a choice (according to the "popular" group) which was to stop hanging out with "dorky" friends and be friends with them, or they wouldn't be my friends.  So I chose my real friends who were friends with me unconditionally, and so what if they were sometimes a little different or didn't wear the coolest clothes.  I somehow became like the Spokesperson for the dorky kids and they loved me for it.  After K-12, I graduated and realized that it all means nothing but hey at the time it seemed like it did.  If your daughter still chooses to hang out with the mean girls after you tell her about the poor little girl who cried everyday, theres not too much you can do.  One day she will find her place and it's sort of silly to get involved in kindergarten politics.|`|tRXA3wlUaa	Ok so I have almost the same problem. The difference is my daughter is 6. My daughter has never been mean to another child. Even if the other child takes her toy away, she would just walk away. She is not mean. Now that being said. I talked to my daughter about the other girl, and asked her why she thought the other girl was being so mean. At first she said she did not know, but later in the conversation my daughter said at the beginning of school she asked if they could play together and my daughter said no. That's when the problem started. So maybe your daughter did not mean to be mean, but the girl took it that way. I would have a talk with the teacher and ask to keep them at a distance. I know you don't want you daughter to follow her, but you have taught your daughter not to be that way. So don't worry to much about them being friends, right now. She could be the one who calms that other little girl down. Plus, if you tell them not to be friends, they will have to go the rest of the 12 or 13 years of school and not be friends because of something that happen a long time ago.|`|LW1OIy6Daa	first suggestion maybe you gotta talk to the Principal <br>  or talk to your daughter<br>  Second:maybe she will find her answer herself|`|fpgC3f27aa	first suggestion maybe you gotta talk to the Principal <br>  or talk to your daughter<br>  Second:maybe she will find her answer herself|`|NJwIXIrHaa	Find a nice girl in her class that she could play with instead.|`|p31xjIFWaa	kill her and have another one... this one is a lost cause|`|nuGcrAbbaa	Nothing.... she is there to learn how to deal with kids socially, let her make her own mistakes ...just support her...|`|ZcrsqMbcaa	the teacher needs to take charge of her class and make sure everyone in her class behaves and treats others well.

wHOQXToHaa	Two ways, my friend had the same problem. Cold turkey is best, but painful for you & your baby will be SO crabby & hellish for a while. But she found if she kept nursing & trying to wean he didn't understand that mommy was stopping. She had to cut it cold turkey & suck it up for a few weeks that was rough.Good luck.|`|WPI0Z47saa	You have to do it slowly for both yours and you baby's sake. It is hard to give advice because I don't know how often you nurse but I will try. First you can cut down on the amount of time you allow them to nurse slowly fazing out one whole nursing sessions. Keep doing this until you get down to 1 feeding. During that one cut down slowly on the minutes you let them nurse and you will start to dry up. Once this happens your baby will lose interest and stop. If you stop cold turkey your baby will be miserable which will make you miserable and you will feel engorged and uncomfortable so it is better the other way. Hope this helped.|`|rRVzWFYZaa	wean him off.  If he's hungry enough, he'll eat.|`|z6IekuwSaa	My mom said that when she weaned me she ate a lot of garlic, and Cinnamon. I guess those things taste really strong and it it made me not want to nurse anymore|`|sw2R5A9iaa	keep the breast out of his mouth -use a cup.|`|427abcdfcd8e012fe37537ef1426e40faa	It will be easiest on you and baby if you take it slow.  Try dropping just one nursing session at a time.  You can either just stay busy at one of the times that he/she normally nurses, or you can try replacing it with a snack or a drink.  It's often easier to wean after 18 months, so you may want to try to hang in there another month before trying to wean if you feel your little one is too attached.<br>  <br>  You may also find that if you can get down to just 1-2 nursing sessions per day, your little one will be happy with that, and that will also seem more manageable for you.  I partially weaned my oldest shortly after her first birthday, and once we were down to twice a day (first thing in the morning and right before bed), I felt like I could have gone on like that indefinitely.  It was so easy for me, and it was nice to still have that cuddle time with her.  She eventually weaned at 14 1/2 months after she bit me suddenly and then never latched on again.<br>  <br>  My middle child weaned at 2 1/2 years (and I never imagined I'd be nursing a 2-year-old), and I'm still nursing my 18-month-old.<br>  <br>  Some info for you...<br>  <a href="http://www.kellymom.com/bf/weaning/how_weaning_happens.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.kellymom.com/bf/weaning/how_w...</a><br>  <a href="http://www.kellymom.com/bf/weaning/index.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.kellymom.com/bf/weaning/index...</a><br>  <br>  And techniques for weaning...<br>  <a href="http://www.kellymom.com/bf/weaning/weaning_techniques.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.kellymom.com/bf/weaning/weani...</a>
AA11140814	I have a two-sided view on this. keep in mind i am 24 and have been out of school for a long time.<br>  <br>  When i was in school (god i feel old :s ) we were not allowed to have any electronic devices, cameras, cd players, tape players, especially NOT cell phones. Education is so important, and these devices could cause distraction.<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  however, <br>  <br>  <br>  i agree with spike (the second answerer) they can be a good social tool, and help in emergencies. with the way the world is today, who knows when a school-shooter is on the loose. or a stranger person lurking around the corner.<br>  <br>  If there was a way to control the use of the phones like, no texting or phone calls to friends during class that'd be great. but we all know about 90% of kids wil rebel and use the phones anyway.<br>  <br>  if anyone was caught at my schools with any of the listed devices above, it was taken from them and not given back till the end of the year. (I brought a camera to school to take pictures with my friends. a teacher saw me with it in the hallway and dragged me to the principals office. i got 3 days ISS and i never got my camera back btw :/ )<br>  <br>  <br>  you have my permission!|`|j01zBZmZaa	Under no circumstances should students be allowed to use their cell phones during school hours: just like in the "old days" when students were discouraged from passing notes in class. It's too distracting, encourages cheating, and is just plain rude. Once the bell rings to dismiss school, I see no problem. Many students participate in after-school activities and need them to call parents when the office may already be closed. Otherwise, they should not be allowed. Feel free to use my response.|`|11a867519828ee7f2df6eda7cb34fb8faa	I do not see the use of cell phones and texting as good social tools.  In fact, quite the opposite.  We can no longer speak in full sentences or write complete sentences.  We can't spell.   People hide behind cell phones.  They break up and fire people by texting.  Cell phones should not be turned on in churches, schools or work meetings.  They should be used by students for emergencies only.  Cell phones cause car accidents.  Cell phones are curse of this generation.|`|876e05e5fb4225d5d27c03023eb578b5aa	hmmm...i will give you a negative and positive<br>  <br>  negative:  i don't think that teens should have cells at school only because a lot use it for cheating on tests and so forth.  A lot don't pay attention in class because they are chatting with their friends through their cell phones.  I know i have done that numerous times.  But i think if i didnt have my phone, i would've paid attention a little more.<br>  <br>  positive:  i think it should be allowed in school for only emergencies or for after school when a teen needs to be picked up.  For after school activities.|`|a2a497c2fe250c674d923a61da7822c5aa	I think they should be able to keep them on vibrate incase of an emergency but to just be sitting there texting your friend, who you probably are just saying "hey whats up", is not really needed. I'm allowed to use my phone [I go to a college and a highschool] so I use it because I'm allowed to but I noticed I don't use it for much then socializing if I'm on the phone but sometimes my mom does text me so I keep it on vibrate. Other then vibrate the phone should not be on unless they have a free period or lunch.|`|kQA7SbY9aa	My kids have cellphones and I agree with their schools: They cannot be used while school is in session. During school hours, they must be in their lockers and if they're found with them in the halls, they are taken away. If there's an emergency during school hours, they can always go to the main office and call home, which will save me money anyway. Using them during classes just distracts from what they are supposed to be doing there, which is learning. <br>  <br>  P.S. I go to college and I'm considerably older than most of the students, and even there, I see young people taking them out in class and texting or playing games. Instructors have to tell these people to turn them off and are sometimes given a attitude for doing so. I find that very rude and disruptive.  College is not free (at least not for me) and if they can't stop socializing for even part of the day while working toward a career, their priorities are in the wrong place...Just a sad situation. <br>  <br>  Every new convenience good and not-so-good sides. <br>  <br>  You may use my response.|`|5ba049abc44fd99ab0e13d585c2beddaaa	yes of course<br>  because there could be an emergency<br>  some classes could be canceled, so they would have to call their parents<br>  they could have a medical condition that their parents need to check up on<br>  a parent or family friend could be injured in a car accident or something|`|BCIfeHAqaa	Yes, in case of emergency. But i think they should be kept on silent, and not used except for at lunch and breaks. <br>  <br>  Dont think you'll need it haha... but you've got my permission. :)|`|dEb85e07aa	you can totally use my answer...<br>  well i think yes they should be allowed because you never now if there is an emergence going on and your parents want to let you now. all they have to do is either text you or call you...|`|Vzy5mpDIaa	I think they should.<br>  Sure sometimes they can be distracting, but they serve a useful social purpose, and can come in handy in emergency situations.<br>  I give you permission by the way.|`|oXpTspmhaa	i love my cell phone and everything but no deff, not.... =]<br>  <br>  unless it was a complete 911!!!!!!!!!|`|i1gesbh5aa	No it's too distracting.  There was a time where kids and parents had emergencies when cell phones weren't around and they managed just fine!|`|DREPOcuGaa	yes, i believe that they should be allowed at school for emergencies|`|RtmfVevbaa	To be used before and after school!|`|lTsPX04jaa	only if there is a family problem other than that nothing|`|IAzCsvaNaa	yes|`|794eeb906c2eeff6ec45d9217ea0ebaeaa	Only for Emergency not for texting and calling friends|`|ZOvJLl5eaa	yes I think they should for emergencies. but it should be turned off and in their locker so its not stolen.|`|aLAmvX5Naa	No. The only students who truly need to use a cell phone during school are people with true emergencies. If my daughter had a severe peanut allergy I'd want a phone on her at all times just in case. If my daughter was 8 months pregnant I'd want a phone on her just in case she went into labor. There are valid medical reasons where you'd need a cell phone and shouldn't have to count on a teacher or other student to save your life.<br>  <br>  As for socializing, you are in school surrounded by people to TALK to. There is no need for teens to text in school or play games on their phone. I have no problem with phones turns off or silent and LEFT in the backpack all day.<br>  <br>  And you can use my statement.|`|SEzIkGNiaa	Only for emergencies|`|7a9ca1e0d676415430d900245a7c2d25aa	There were people in school long before there were 13 year olds that "had" to have a cell phone. There weren't any emergencies that we couldn't use the school phone for. Like another poster said, there are problems with people taking pictures in the bathroom or locker room and sending them all over school. That would be a disaster and the damage would be done already before the person was caught. If someone were to take a pic of me like that and send it all over school I'd be out for revenge. That is just something to think about when allowing cell phones at school. Oh yeah, you can use this answer for you paper. Good luck with it.|`|HOdblqIkaa	reasons why kids should be able to take them to school-<br>  emergency<br>  call for ride after school/practice/club<br>  reasons why kids should not be able to take them to school-<br>  distraction<br>  theft<br>  <br>  kids rarely have an emergency while at school and if there is then whoever is calling can call the school who will then notify the student. it makes it easier if the student has his or her phone there but its not necessary. there are phones at the school that kids can use if they need to call for a ride so both those arguments have positive and negative.<br>  phones are a huge distraction in class and whoever has their phone out should have it taken away only to be picked up by a parent later that day. phones kept in lockers are more susceptible to being stolen so again both arguments have a negative and positive. <br>  in my opinion students should be able to take their phones to school but not use them in class, who cares about use in the halls as long as its not during class hours. if the student gets caught thats their fault and the school should have a 3 strikes your out policy, if the student breaks it so many times then they have lost their phone priveledges and if it continues then they should be suspended from school, suspended from a team or club, detention, kept from going to homecoming or prom, kept from going to sporting events, it may sound harsh but when one person has a phone out in class so many others are distracted by the buzzing and the tapping and its not fair to those who are actually following the rules. <br>  i dont care if you use my ideas good luck on your paper.|`|ZX2so3twaa	i think we should be able to have them, but like maybe restrictions on when to use them. like the last 5 minutes of class and at lunch and stuff.|`|4e67Pdfvaa	on vibrate only during lunch and brake times. Not in class.|`|6gthdHpnaa	I think that teenagers should be allowed to have cell phones in school and be able to use them as long as they are not disrupting other students in any way. <br>  When students are using cell phones during a class, they won't learn anything and therefore will fail the class. Then, they will have learned their lesson the hard way and will probably not find it necessary to have cell phones in school again. <br>  But if they're just banned from school, students will still bring them, so what difference does it make if they're allowed or not?|`|vBwVheaXaa	Sometimes you’re not allowed to use it in lessons but people use it anyway and it becomes an on going problem for the teachers to tell them to put it away all the time.<br>  <br>  Also if you bring it to school it might get stolen and that happens quite a lot and that happened to me aswell. <br>  <br>  You can use my statement btw i don't think it's very good but if you want you can.|`|FiUprYsvaa	I think teenagers should be able to bring their cell phones to school. <br>  First off, if they don't how would they be able to have them right after school when they need them. <br>  <br>  In high school if I would have left my phone at home during school I wouldn't have been able to have it after school. <br>  My mom always went straight from work to get me and then to get my brother and then we would have went to run errands. Meaning not being home till about 5 or 6 at night. <br>  That meant 3-4 hours without my cell phone. <br>  <br>  And if plans changed I would have had no way of getting in contact with my mom or her with me. <br>  <br>  I think it is just so much easier to just take it school, keep it on vibe during class and then have it immediately after school.<br>  <br>  <br>  Secondly, I think that they should be able to text during passing period, lunch, before and after school, homeroom and study hall.|`|Bw18seFqaa	no..<br>  <br>  they dont need them..   cellphones makes it too easy for kids to cheat on tests by txting and sending pics.  Its also a distraction.<br>  <br>  There have also been problems with kids taking graphic pics in the school restrooms and sending them to each other.<br>  <br>  You dont need it for an "emergency" at school.. there are adults present, a school nurse, and the school phone lines..  if a call needs to be made, or you need to be reached, it can be done on the land line.<br>  <br>  <br>  Most teens dont even "need" a cell phone.. period.  Its an over-indulged luxury.|`|egqveuPjaa	Yes- how about if there was an emergency? Like, God forbid, they got attacked? Or if they wanted to contact somebody privately i.r didn't want to use the schools phone? I have mine with me all the time- it's not that distracting- all I use it for is to check the time!|`|o8uGsZxmaa	At my school we are aloud to have our mobile's with us.<br>  <br>  We are just not aloud to use them in class.<br>  <br>  EDIT*<br>  <br>  I take it that you disagree with cell phones in school since you have thumbed down everyone who has said that it should be aloud?|`|XuKj2TLwaa	Well like the first person said for emergencies otherwise no because they can get distracting to you'r school work and the answer is kind of convoluted|`|AmqQ9it5aa	Only if they aren't turned on during the school day.

They were hard to read, and it was difficult to tell when it was positive.  Also, it will only give you a positive result one day, when you actually have a window of about 3 days in which you can get pregnant, so it's best to be aware of that window so you can have sex as much as possible at the right time.  Instead, I would recommend charting your BBT every morning.  This gives you a better idea of when you ovulate.  Check out the book Taking Charge of your Fertility by Toni Wechsler, or you can find a chart to print out online.  Here's one I found:|`|iX0IgOCxaa	I totally agree with Jen.

My Husband and I were TTC for many years (at least 6 years in total) without any BFP's! <br>  I had PCOS and hardly ovulated alone.  I tried Clomid for quite a few cycles before we decided to try IUI in August last year.<br>  We used injectibles (Puregon) for 21 days prior to our IUI and I had two mature follicles at the time of my IUI.<br>  Our first IUI worked and we are now 29 weeks with a little girl, a baby I never thought I'd ever have after the 6+ years spent TTC!<br>  <br>  Hope you have the same luck!

My husband and I sought advice from my OB/GYN who referred me to a fertility specialist I was actually hoping for explained infertility but oh well. After several failed inseminations, we tried IUI. Went through the IUI injections and the whole bit and mid-way through the cycle, I developed some kind of infection and my Dr canceled the cycle. It was devastating to say the least. We forged on and decided to change clinics to a very well known and successful consultant in India called India Med Guru Consultants recommended by a family friend of ours. Be very choosy when you find a doctor, I chose Indian Med Guru Consultants in India because there success rates are quite high. There are so many setbacks along the way, but working with Indian Med Guru Consultants made the process less stressful. We cried and thanked God for this wonderful blessing. By way of hope and encouragement, we got pregnant first time with IUI and ICSI and I'm now 6 months pregnant with a baby boy! I pray every night for people who are trying to conceive because I understand how awful it is.

1384a4fd63c3904cfbbb488d344adfc4aa	when you first wake up, try massaging them VERY gently, it may hurt a little bit at first but if u keep massaging them they should start to feel better. also try keeping a warm washcloth handy, or going straight to the shower to take a bath. you could try getting a support bra, a nursing bra would be even better, do not get one with an underwire. hope this helps. good luck and congratulations|`|AA12096501	yes your normal and the pain or discomfort will last thru most if not all of your pregnancy becouse your breasts are inlarging and are at the begining stage of producing colostrom for your baby you need to use warm pads on them you can also take tylenol for pain . no other meds w/o/ talking to your dr. but i do know tylenol is safe.|`|AA12084255	Wear a good fitting bra that supports them completely.

These rising hormone levels cause increased blood flow and breast tissue changes, which may make your breasts may feel swollen, sore, tingly, and unusually sensitive to touch. Some women describe the sensation as an exaggerated version of how their breasts feel before their period. Breast tenderness is one of the earliest signs of pregnancy. It usually starts around 4 to 6 weeks and lasts through the first trimester. <br>  -----------------------<br>  <br>  When I was pregnant, however, it lasted through  the entire pregnancy... I guess it depends on the woman... =)

I have 7 children very close together. The closest are 15 months the farthest apart are 28 months. Of course, I stayed home with them.<br>  <br>  Also, about being an OB/GYN, save yourself time and money and become a CNM instead. They give better care than obs and have better outcomes (according to the Cochran database). (I'm also writing a book on pregnancy and childbirth, so I've done the research and can speak from personal experience as well).
4dd15940df01fa3629425d84cdc5bd10aa	Clomid is to help you ovulate (or produce more eggs when you DO ovulate, in order to help sperm reach one easier).  <br>  <br>  Now...your doctor is talking about giving you a shot...I think you are meaning HCG, not HSG.  HCG is a hormone that is produced during pregnancy, but it is also used for various other things as well.  If you are working with an infertility doctor, the HCG shot will be giving to you by the doc (or you may have to give it to yourself at a certain time) to force ovulation after taking the clomid.  This process of forcing ovilation is needed so that you and the doc KNOW when you ovulated (when teh shot is given) so that sperm may be introduced into your body via intercourse, or via a medical procedure to hopefully achieve a pregnancy.<br>  If you are correct and the doctor was talking abotu HSG (not HCG), it is NOT a shot.  It is a procedure that involves putting a tube/catheder up through your cervix and inflating a baloon in your uterus.  Then they put in dye and watch on an ultrasound machine as the dye flows through your uterus and fallopien tube, to make sure nothign is blocked or damaged.  <br>  <br>  In a situation where you woudl use the HCG shot, it woudl be given to you/yourself in the back of the hip area (upper buttocks) and then is usually followed by a IUI (intra uterine insemination) procedure, which involves inserting a tube up through the cervix and injecting sperm that has been 'washed' (the good ones seperated from the bad ones) at a certain time (usually 36 hours after the HCG injection is given to you/yourself) in hopes of achieving pregnancy.<br>  <br>  These procedures are not that bad...I have been through them all.  They are slightly uncomfortable, but nothing I woudlnt do again to achieve pregnancy.  The HCG injection was the worst part for me, because I had to give it to myself at home.  I couldnt do this, so I had to have my husband give it to me...it's not that bad at all...it doesnt hurt very much, and afterwards, the area feels almost like a sore muscle for abotu 15 minutes...but thats it.<br>  <br>  I hope this info helped you.  If you are unsure of what exactly is happening (if you havent discussed any procedures with your doctor), please give them a call and ask questions.  You shoudl be aware of what to expcet, and what the exact plan is that you are doing...whether it be, justtaking clomid, or having an actual IUI or IVF done.<br>  <br>  Good luck.|`|3441aa71ada9d6a1d64a9831d0c2f721aa	An HSG is a test done to check if your tubes are blocked.|`|AA11338368	I had this procedure.  I had polycystic ovaries too.  She is doing an ultrasound to check your ovaries.  A VERY small percentage of woman have complications where their ovaries become very large, filled with fluid(me).  She will monitor your ovaries and watch the eggs inside.  When they become the correct size (where a sperm can fertilize them and have a healthy baby) she will give you a shot to release them.  They will travel down your fallopian tubes and go to where the sperm will meet them, either through natural intercourse or through artificial insemination.  Good luck, think happy thoughts!!|`|AA11226298	Chlomid is a medication used to treat female infertility, it causes the ovaries to produce more eggs.  I don't know HSG, there is hCG which is a hormone.  It's normally produced during pregnancy, and is detected by home pregnancy tests.|`|cb063eb20a605b09164eaf9d59750a28aa	(HSG) is a specialized X-Ray of the uterus and tubes. An HSG is done after the menstrual flow has just stopped - usually on Day6 or 7 of the period, at which time the lining of the urerus is thin. It is done in an X-Ray Clinic. The patient is advised to take an antibiotic and a pain - killer before the procedure by many doctors. After being positioned on the X-Ray table, the doctor places a special instrument into the cervix, called a cervical cannula, which is made of metal. many doctors now prefer to use a opaque dye (a liquid which is opaque to X-ray) is then injected into the uterine cavity. This is done slowly under pressure, and pictures are taken- perferably under an image intensufier. The passage of the dye into the uterinw cavity and then into the tubes and from there into the abdomen can be seen and X-Ray pictues taken. These provide a permanent record.
208959a94dbed2a74606295c6e482e53aa	I know two different women that home pregnancy tests didn't work for when they were pregnant.

But you sure as hell do not know it within the first few hours after conception.<br>  <br>   If you are unclear on the definition of sexual intercourse, as your question gives the idea that you are, than you need first to educate yourself on that subject.   <br>    How far do you have to go? Well- the seed must be planted.<br>  If you do not understand this- than you have no business in any sexual activity, period.|`|703c83fe1a687f02e99bde09a9966ecfaa	You usually won't have any feeling until at least three or four weeks after your last period.  Right after you have sex, you aren't pregnant yet.  Sperm can live in you for days and wait for you to ovulate so they can join with an egg.  Then if an embryo is formed, it has to implant and that takes several days.<br>  <br>  Your nausea and bloatedness was probably just from excitement after what you and your boyfriend did.  If you are pregnant, your stomach doesn't start to feel bloated for a much longer time, and it takes a month or so before most women are nauseated too.  The first sign is often breast changes or weepiness, but you really never know until you miss your period or take a pregnancy test right before you expect it.  You can get a good digital one now that'll tell you several days before you miss it.|`|5e615f35f2d78e58c4d333d354d8cb50aa	UNFORTUNATELY IT ONLY TAKES A GUY A MINUTE ,IF THAT ,TO GET A WOMAN PREGNANT.BUT YOU WOULDN'T KNOW IT RIGHT AWAY,NOT FOR AT LEAST 2-3 WEEKS.IF THIS WAS YOUR FIRST TIME BLEEDING AND FEELING SICK (FROM BEING SCARED) IS NORMAL , BUT YOU WOULD DEFINITELY KNOW IF YOU HAD SEX OR NOT.

Depends on the person. But you cant tell right after you have sex.|`|92d5bd611fb80ceb0579d4dbc834938caa	If you did actually have sex, the sperm can live inside you for up to 5 days I believe.  Therefore, you could become pregnant up to 5 days after intercourse.  About 2 weeks after conception (sperm meets egg), you might begin to have symptoms....and you might not.  The most decisive symptom is your missed period; so wait and see if that happens before you worry yourself too much.<br>  <br>  I wish you luck and please be more responsible with your body from now on.|`|fc3c790cf538d750638b1af2e00a79a0aa	You would not feel pregnancy symptoms straight after sex.

JYGCF6USaa	At my work, we usually turn off the lights and have everyone sit down for a little bit (about a minute). It used to be an almost daily thing, but after a while it became a lot less common.  One factor may also be specific kids (we have two currently) who get everyone else started, and watch for them to be starting something.  When that happens, just have seperate them and let them cool off, but MAKE SURE THEY KNOW THEY ARE NOT IN TROUBLE!  This also seemes to help.  Overall, just make sure they know they have to listen and follow the rules.|`|AA10275501	blow a whistle then whisper what you want from them. they will concentrate real hard to listen and forget what they were doing.  they may even think it was fun and whisper back to u.|`|0ca2b53ccf7bfa29bcf1d35de2c42092aa	You either break into song or re-evaluate what is not working in the classroom.  Clap your hands loudly to get their attention, and then start singing loudly or play a song on the CD player.  Do something silly to catch their attention- like break into 3 Little Monkeys Jumping on the Bed, and be animated!!  Surprise them, and get them involved.  This is the easiest way to stop the chaos and bring them back together.  After the day is over, take some time to reflect on what went wrong during the day to cause the chaos.  Is the environment set up in a way that encourages running in the class or distractability?  Are there too many kids in the room with too few staff?  Do you have the respect of the children in the class so that they listen to you, or do they run the class?  Was an activity too stimulating or out of order?  Did they get outside to burn off steam?  Evaluating the situation later on (and especially with the help of a co-worker) can shed some light on what you can do differently next time to avoid chaos.|`|3bd059856fb623e23b213d4ec09db870aa	Wow I deal with that everyday! Hopefully you have an assistant in your classroom that will help you but normally I start singing a song which calms them down and then I can have them start to clean up their area. I am not sure how many children you have in your class but we have about 15 and sometimes they are all just so crazy running around, hitting, spitting, and lord knows what else! I guess its hard to do but songs usually work for our children! Good luck they are a handful!|`|FmsgNFfMaa	slap them

AA12069779	It's too early at that point to actually give birth.

I'm sorry if this is something you are going through.|`|a0d6dd0a39d9780e1f9491ff538495d3aa	That would be a miscarriage at 10 weeks gestational age and you wouldn't go through labor.|`|1nmpUn9daa	It will have to come out.

The baby's body still comes out vaginally but the doctors take it out.|`|0gXbHyPmaa	It depends, what you had was a miscarriage, some women experience bleeding which can possible get rid of everything in the uterus, and if not you will have to have a D&C.  It is a minor surgical procedure, I had on about 3 months ago and I was eight weeks pregnant.|`|B9P02XUdaa	yes|`|cd7cc5dcc825bbe50622bfa3024a6416aa	Unfortunately, the answer to that is not necessarily.

AA10098295	It really depends on which vitamin B you are taking.  B6 can be dangerous in higher doses in your first trimester.  <br>  You are best off taking a pre-natal multi-vitamin.  If your doctor didn't prescribe one for you, there are plenty of them over the counter<br>  <br>  If in doubt ask your doctor.|`|2948423bf32d621c192777b791381727aa	i don't think it will hurt you|`|73cb039952ad6950d2aa03da91eb849eaa	I think it's okay.  But aren't you taking prenatal vitamins anyway?  B-vitamins should be included in those.  Whatever you do, make sure you are getting enough folic acid. It is very important in protecting your fetus from neuro-tube defects.
WHlrwRFmaa	Before the two of you have sex, since it seems you are young I want you to go to Planned Parenthood and talk to a counselor, they will talk to both of you about birth control, std's and what risk are associated with birth control.

If all you are worried about is a pregnancy, then your GF needs to make a visit to the family doctor and get some birth control.

The pill makes your body think it is pregnant so it doesn't release an egg. When there is no egg the sperm can't fertilize it. You can also use spermicide that way you both  can  feel each other and not get pregnant. be sure to read directions. Enjoy|`|qZXTSIT3aa	you can always use different forms of birth control.

1fe7548a38e463d0ef61dedc26dcf9c4aa	Increased cervical mucous is common during pregnancy, especially late pregnancy.  But even if you do lose your plug, it doesn't guarantee immediate labor.  I know someone who went into labor 2 days later with her first and 5 weeks later with her 2nd.  <br>  <br>  Good luck.|`|AA10275501	that is probably your plug coming out gradually.

Unfortunately, you can't tell how long it'll take for before you go into labor from this.  Check out this site|`|AA10293042	Now I can't say much cause I haven't had kids. But my sister in law is pregnant with her second child.

Congratulations with the baby and good luck with it all.|`|HCfVu9NNaa	I lost my mucus plug about 2 days before I went into labor.  But everyone is different. You can lose it weeks before labor is imminent. If you are close to your due date than get ready! My mucus plug looked like you described.
8a3da568d050731202110da78d36ac48aa	No you can't loose your job. Unless you are doing a job that can impact your pregnancy (risks like chemicals and heavy physical labor) then you don't need to or are even obligated to inform your employer. It's personal info that they can't legally descriminate you on (ie: pregnancy, sexual orientation, marriage status, children etc). When I say this I mean that they can't not hire you becuase you are pregnant and they can't fire you becuase you are pregnant. You're fired on your own conduct or laid off by company restructuring. Just ask yourself if it's a job you can see yourself doing through pregnancy becuase that's the important part. Do they have a maternity leave policy? These are things you can find out w/o disclosing your state. When you are ready, when you feel it may inhibit you work ability or when you are getting to the point you can't hide your pregnant body you can tell your boss. It's the law that they can't even ask you the question and you don't even need to tell them until you want to. If it doesn't inhibit your ability to work and you don't have to leave work to go to appointments then you don't even need to say anything until it comes to a point of arranging maternity leave.|`|AA10219752	It depends on the company you work for... You may or may not lose your job, but you will not be entitled to any maternity leave, you have to be with a company for over 1 year to get that. They can let you go before you have the baby, and that is their right. You need to ask them what their rules are about that.<br>  <br>  They cannot fire you for being pregnant, but they can let you go for other reasons. Employers want employees who are going to be with their company for along time. If they see that you are pregnant they can let you go for something else. Dont be surprised if they do. Just talk to them about you being pregnant and see what they say.<br>  <br>  You do have an obligation to tell them because like I said they want someone they can count on, not someone that is going to leave in 9 months and take time off for dr. appts ect....the person who said no worries, wont have her job for very long. Trust me|`|FSzkr2lYaa	If you are pregnant by law it is ILLEGAL for your employer to fire or force you to quit due to pregnancy. It is agaisnt the equal opportunity employment act. So when you know for sure you can tell your employer. If you are in most cases you can work up to your due date. Good luck!|`|WOyCgGYGaa	No worries, seriously. I'm 16 weeks pregnant and I just accepted a new job. You have absolutely NO obligation what-so-ever to tell your future employer and they are NOT allowed to ask you that question either. Also, you can not be fired for being pregnant - it's against the law because it's a form of discrimination, and I'm sure all businesses know that. I read on a website that you should tell your boss you're pregnant at around 15 - 20 weeks, but you are at no point obligated to do so. I guess they would figure it out eventually!|`|aT8mS4gnaa	no where did you get that idea i see pregnant people working all the time|`|e298a5f6160975d21c9e41ccf16aade3aa	Well, first of all, they cannot fire you for getting pregnant.  it's discrimination.  Once you have confirmed the pregnancy, you should let them know at a comfortable point.  Probably not until after 12 weeks when the risk of miscarriage goes down.|`|YOqCvMuZaa	This just happened to me actually.  I started my new job at the end of January this year, thinking I was pregnant but wasn't confirmed until about 2 weeks into the new job.  As an employer, they can't come out and ask you if you are pregnant or planning to be.  I'm not sure where your obligation lies.  I started my job which included about 5 weeks of training, I went through the training then broke the news to HR.  I was very scared but knew it had to be done sooner rather than later because my job involves heavy lifting and climbing ladders.  They were very supportive (very large corporation) and told me they didn't want to loose me.  They stuck me in the office thru my pregnancy (currently 22 weeks, due 9/3/07) and will be put back out in the field afterwards.  I didn't have my 90 days in yet and they still kept me.  The thing is that they can't fire you or not give you the job just because your pregnant but employers can be sneaky and think of other reasons not to hire you or fire you.  I should've told them sooner, but I was very scared.  This is my first child and we really needed this job to be able to give our child the life she deserves.  I wish you good luck and hope you are as fortunate as I was/am.<br>  <br>  Edited to say that some employers (as in my case) offer short term disability to their employees.  When I have my baby I will get 6 weeks 100% paid leave and I will not have a year in yet.  FMLA protects your position after 12 mos.  Technically, my employer could backfill my position but its unlikely.
AA11975117	You guys are so young! Don't have another baby. What's done is done. I'm sorry that this happened to both of you. Yes, you should stay with her. NO, you should not have another baby until way later in life, like maybe early to mid 20's....and I hate to tell you this...you won't be together then.<br>  <br>  Good luck.|`|H51UD0vlaa	She is still somewhat a child call child protective services on their azzes. Just have a relationship for a while without thinking of sex and babys. I know it's hard for you but, she needs to find out who she is right now. If you have to, use mary palm and her five sisters, hint hint. i hope this wasn't a bogus question.|`|AA11624675	The reason you're having this harshness is that both of you are too young to be having sex and that neither of you is married. Either age or marriage would have prevented this. The fact is that her parents are still responsible for her and pretty much control her. I would avoid continuing your relationship as long as this is the case because you've no idea what the ones in control, her parents, will do to you.|`|4ccfa336e8d721730deaa2e0cdead710aa	Yeah great go have another kid that the taxpayers have to pay for. wear a rubber kid|`|PrWZCtvIaa	I don't think getting pregnant again is a good idea given your ages. It was her choice to get the abortion not yours and you shouldn't leave her because she made a choice about her body. I think if you guys still like each other or love each other than you should stay with her. However don't stay with her because she is having a difficult time. You should consider reporting her parents for beating a child (not to mention a pregnant child).|`|djs36Cl9aa	She's 14 and she wants to get pregnant. I PROMISE you dude, do NOT get her pregnant again. You will regret it soooo much. **** love, you're not ready for a kid.|`|041fa5eb5f95f4ccb8124df70f8a5016aa	wow!! thats deep...it was your baby?? And she didn't tell you?<br>  She needs to get out of that situation! Will your parents let you live with her?<br>  Sometimes girls who are abused feel the need to concieve because they want someone to love them.|`|1mXySkYEaa	Please please don't try to have another baby in this situation.  A poor innocent life should not be forced into this.  I think you should go to another adult figure that you can trust: a teacher, preacher, or even the police.  You are much to young to decide right now to have a relationship with this girl.  She needs help beyond what you can provide.  Please think about helping her by telling the proper authorities, not by getting her pregnant.|`|32f8fe63afce4db27a606844198a1c4aaa	If you do stay with her don't get her pregnant again! Abortion is not a form of birth control. Use a condom! I don't think I could be with someone who killed my baby.|`|6b2cebca3008238e98ab2e775c8a7f5aaa	This is truly a sad situation for one I would definetly let the authorities know that she is being abused. You guys are so young........|`|8npP6xfHaa	Wow, you guys need to talk to a trusted adult outside your families.  Somebody needs you guys to talk to the authorities to protect your girl friend<br>  <br>  No person, especially a minor should ever be hit or beaten.|`|flKV6kFXaa	ABORTION IS BADDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDD!!!!!!!... thats like killing someone retards|`|kKIVomBvaa	History shouldn’t repeat itself. Please don’t get her pregnant again. You guys are still young. Having a baby need responsibility. Obviously, at such a young age, you guys are parents’ responsibility. What your girlfriend needs right now is LOVE. She needs someone to shower her with plenty of love. Apparently she doesn’t receive that from her family. After what she has been thru (at such a young age) I don’t guarantee her family will let her near you. Beating doesn’t solve problem. By showing and giving has a better chance. Of course, you have to be convincing enough to get right back on track. Provided you are serious about your girlfriend. Again, please don’t make her pregnant now.
a9e3ce9d0d2e43f48fe490c8cba25589aa	I had strep b as well with my first child and they gave the antibiotics during labor and he was fine they will keep the baby for at least I think (sorry been 5 years ago) 48-72 hours I know I was discharged before him, but they do that has a precaution.  My son is healthy and had no problems at all.  Good luck and don't stress too much cause that is not good for your baby....lol|`|VAToKGwSaa	I had it with my first pregnancy.  The antibiotics worked just fine and my son turned out to be a very healthy child.|`|P7jug5GSaa	I devloped it as well, with my first child and not my second.  Both my kids are 100% healthy.  They say that when your baby passes through tthe canal they can catch it if you don't get antiobiotics.  The Antibiotics will most definetly be enough, not to mention if you get a C-Section there is no way the baby can get it, so maybe ask if you can schedual a C-section if your very concerned, but I promis you, your baby will be fine, I know many people who devloped Beta and all their kids, including my own are just fine!|`|UUAHGY9jaa	My sister had it with both her kids and they were both fine, best friend had it and antiboitics did not help her baby still got sick.  Its not that bad though because the docs know you have it and test your baby as soon as they get here and can give necessary medications right away.  FYI best friends baby turned out fine, she only had to spend an extra two days in the hospital and only for precautions.|`|eVHI2mcCaa	My beta strep was positive for both of my children and they were born healthy.  My second labor went very quickly and I was only able to get the first does of antibiotics and that was not a problem.  Just remind the staff as soon as you check in at the hospital and if you notice that they haven't hung your medication with the IV bag, remind them again.

Teniendo una estabilidad emocional, y economica buena.Saludos.|`|1007842685ef56a25fb9bea493df57f8aa	Segun lo que yo he leido es que la mejor edad podria ser a partir de los 22 o 23 a?os, q es cuando por lo regular el cuerpo de la madre ya esta mejor desarollado y en condiciones de soportar todo lo que un embarazo conlleva, pero cuando ya se habla de una pareja, talvez la edad deba ser mas, eso si estamos considerando que la pareja estudia, o se kiere superar mas, haí talvez la edad pienso yo, seria a los 25 a?os o despues, ya q a esa edad, podras tener tu carrera, un hogar mejor, y probablemente un matrimonio mas solido, mucha suerte!!|`|08gJFUJHaa	el nivel de madurez varía mucho de una persona a otra.. quién te dice que se es maduro con 25 y quién te dice que lo es con 35.<br>  Yo he tenido a mi hija con 36, es una decisión personal. Hay que ser muy consciente de lo que se te viene encima y si vas a estar preparado para ello.|`|VkAosWnnaa	la edad recomendada es de los 25 a los 30 para tener la sufisiente madures para cuidar un bebe|`|c470662bfa58783402c3a95cef365b8baa	cuando te lo dicta tu reloj biologico|`|wkKGiKNqaa	Para eso no hay edad. La pareja debe estar en un buen momento, es decir, sin problemas pendientes ni recientes.<br>  Tambien deben tener estabilidad laboral y económica, y si es posible, ya deben estar establecidos en su casa, aunque sea alquilada, pero no es recomendable que aun vivan con los suegros.<br>  No hay edad, depende de la estabilidad de la pareja.|`|FnSdpiATaa	fisicamente no antes de los 20, emocionalmente hay personas ke nunca maduran muchas veces la madurez emocional no esta ligada a la edad. Nadie nos ense?a a ser padres muchas cosas las aprendemos en el camino, lo mejor es estar informado y darles el cari?o ke necesitan.se me hace un poco mas importante el nivel de educacion y socioeconomico ya ke un hijo en una responsabilidad completa y hay ke ofrecerles las mejores condiciones no crees?como educacion, salud, vestido, alimentacion,diversion y todo eso cuesta$$$$.|`|L40Aj8Twaa	La madurez en cuanto a los ninos solo la logras teniendolos y por que la verdad hay gente muy mayor y todavia no a madurado lo importante es k tengas para mantenerlo|`|LEvJLcsFaa	depende decadapareja ydesu situacion. La vida cambiamucho con hijos|`|QHjpxwULaa	yo creo que apartir de los 25 porq a esa edad uno se empieza a hacer mas responsable como para cargar con eso!<br>  minimo 20<br>  maximo... no aii|`|TRvS8DcYaa	Creo que no hay una edad determinada, ciertas personas maduran antes por experiencias de vida y otras tardan mas, no te guies por la edad cuando sientas q podes hacerte cargo de otra personita ese es el momento justo|`|UgacOtioaa	Yo creo que la madurez no depende de la edad, la madurez varía según la persona, pero lo que si sé, es que la edad más saludable para que una mujer tenga hijos es de los 25 a?os en adelante.|`|b1d2e5ed4c299cc05bbba0b67ac5a8ecaa	La madurez no tiene edad especifica, es cuando la pareja se sienta lista para afrontar esta gran responsabilidad LLENA DE SATISFACCIONES.<br>  <br>  en cuestiones fisicas para la mujer, se dice que la mejor edad es entre los 25 y 32 a?os. Recuerda que la paciencia y energia si vienen con la juventud de las personas, asi que lo mejor es tenerlos en este lapso de edad.<br>  <br>  Suerte en esta nueva aventura.|`|wiaCvQT6aa	17 minimo<br>  <br>  esas son cosas ke se deben pensar antes de hacer
