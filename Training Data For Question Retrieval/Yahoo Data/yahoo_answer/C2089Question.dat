Their new ads are obnoxious and extremely overbearing, forcing you to sit there and endure them run thru their little show and actually stopping you from reading your email (click click click click and it still won't open) until AFTER their little show is done, such as the jiggling ugly stomach or the ugly wrinkled woman.  Only after their lousy animation is done are you able to open or work with your mail.  I hate it, and am looking for a better service.  It's one thing to have the constant ads and did not mind it.  It's entirely different to be forced to sit there waiting until their disgusting peepshow is over with, and yeh, sick of the sex stuff too.  Looking at alternatives....

Okay, stupid question, but I'm having issues here.   -_____-      Yesterday I changed my 360 primary pic so I could change my avatar here on answers (and yes I made sure it was set as my primary). It was jpg and followed teh guidelines and whatnot.   But answers refused to show the new pic and it still had the old picture showing as my 360 avi.   <.<   I tried saving it a few times... I tried deleting my old avi picture thinking that might make it realize I changed it... and it kinda worked....   Except now the new pic still won't show up....   Its just a link with my name.....   ;___;      Is this a glitch? Am I making some simple [stupid] mistake?   Help would be appreciated.... I want my avatar back...

I realized a problem: I am not able to invite to join to our yahoogroup to any user in which address got the word "info" in the address because the system does not recognize it as an email address.      I was thinking it was a problem with the domain name, and thus I made a brief test: I was able to invite to any user to join with another name but with the same domain: in this case using:    inf@(domain).com I tried the same sending to another info@(domain2).es with same result.      Does the system filter automatically every invitation sent to user name "info" before the domain name? Is anything can be made to solve this situation and thus sending invitation to another addresses with user name"info"?      Thanks in advance.

20090222134923AAEv5jk	Yahoo! Products;Yahoo! Mail;Address Book & Calendar	Hijacker Deleted My Yahoo Mail Contacts. Can I restore them?	I fell victim to a very common web intruder. My Yahoo Mail account was compromised, a mass email was sent to all my contacts, then the contacts were erased.      For more info on the hijack, do a Google search for "dear friend, i would like to introduce a good company".      I see that Hotmail users are also being victimized by this. Hotmail has a web option to RESTORE ERASED CONTACTS. My question is...does Yahoo Mail have the same?? And if not, how can they be tipped off to add this option??
