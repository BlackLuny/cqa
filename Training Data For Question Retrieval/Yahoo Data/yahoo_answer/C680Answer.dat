anLAHKQEaa	Oh girly-I am so sorry that you have to go though something like this!=[  You do NOT sound snoopy, I would do the same exact thing that you did.  He is smoking probably because he has been addicted for all these years-which you probably already knew, and the thing he is growing, did you know about this before, maybe it has been a while since he has been doing that, which is probably worrysome too=[.  Well, it is really not easy to say why he is doing this to himself, but I sorry you have to deal with this.  I wish I could give you a big hug! Don't cry [I know i would be too though.]  Is your dad the type of person that you could talk to like saying, I am really worried about your smoking-I want you to be around for a long time, dad I love you! And say maybe say I was getting the dirty cloths to put in the laundry, and I went in your bathroom to check and in your room, and i found things that really scared me-I can't get it out of my mind, and I can't keep it to myself.  Would he get really mad at you if you did this-you really should talk to him.  Do you have a brother or sister or a family member like a cousin or aunt that you could talk to about what they suggest you do-try talking to a close aunt or uncle because an adult may be better to ask what to do than a kid like a cousin.  If you have a brother or sister what do they think about the situation are they on the same page as you? I hope everything works out!!! Everying will work out! It ALWAYS does!!!! Keep faith and I will keep you in my thoughts and prayers! =] <3Stella|`|S1S0pxHQaa	I think the only way to find out the truth is to talk to him.|`|AA10558731	It sounds like you're being far too nosy and need to stop snooping through your dad's things. How would you like it if I went snooping through your things and then went on Yahoo Answers to tell everyone what I found? Mind your own business and let dad mind his.|`|6VJ1etR4aa	First of all I'm sorry.<br>  The thing is your dad needs help, he is screwing up his life and his family which is you.<br>  Be sure to tell him that you care about him doesnt want him to go down the wrong path.<br>  He will probably argue that you are a kid but show him the side-effects and the downsides of people who smoke. Messing around like this will eventually lead to death, and show him the victims of that.<br>  He could do so much more with his life.<br>  I hope your dad turns around and that this helped!|`|nGhqwEdpaa	Well, sounds like your pretty upset. I think you need to catch your dad when he comes home and ask him to sit and talk for a few. Tell him you love him, but are worried for him and yourself. Let him know you went to his room because you were wanting to know whats happening with him, tell him what you saw. Maybe he can explain his actions to you and try to clean up his act. I know parents are going to do what they do, but ask him to put you first. Tell him you love him and need for him to SHOW you he loves you. Good luck hun|`|ru89rMEmaa	yea that sounds like pot. lol umm well if your worried about him talk to him.

Ask her out. You seem really sweet. But if she says No and yu keep on at her .. You will be called a stalker so ... GOOD LUCK DUDE X|`|a0E9CuELaa	Ok you have two options. Say nothing and spend the rest of your life wondering what could have been OR take action and control over your own future. You don't necessarily have to make asking her out so obvious at first. Ask her out for a coffee or lunch say you need an excuse to get away from the office for a while and would she like to meet up with you for a coffee, make it informal, more of a friendly thing, continue to stay in contact with her but don't go Over the Top, take her out again the following week for dinner slowly build the dates up and then after a few weeks Kiss her and take it from there. My boyfriend was in the same situation as you but we got there in the end. Nothing is impossible. Best of Luck :)
b24419ce48ad9d3e0a137227f09dc215aa	u should definately talk w/her. i cant believe she would do tht...even though idk her still it sounds like yall r really gr8 friends and then her do tht! well i've been havin the same sortof probs my friend trys 2 fit in w/other ppl and will not act the same w/me jus 4 the other ppl 2 accept her. but we've talked bout it and shes got a lot better. u made me think of my bff cuz u said she invited ppl tht arent even her friends. well i hope yall talk and resolve yalls probs|`|jHyDO7rcaa	Talk to her about it. Find out what is the problem. Maybe it isn't her, maybe it's her parents that like the other girls (or the others girls parents') better. <br>  Probably it's not her fault.|`|zbPNN4Ndaa	I would just shake it off. If she stops inviting you to places or parties, then I would as what is going on, but for now I would just ignore the fact that she didn't invite you. It's just one party. Maybe next year you could have a surprise party for her to see how she reacts, then she'll know you are good friends.|`|fHrYRXXFaa	ya i think you must talk to her and find out the reason why didn't she invite you? but remember one thing that you should ask her in very polite language and don't try to hurt her otherwise you may be loose her friendship.|`|Qbjpft5aaa	if you feel comfortable talking to her...do it. but she doesn't seem like <br>  a true friend to me. so, if you DO talk to her...be careful. you might get<br>  really hurt.<br>  <3 good luck..|`|lFTynrRVaa	Don't take it seriously, be easy n ask her with politely , she will say every thing ,if you both are go friends . Keep patience.|`|nWHNbKIfaa	talk to her
WvZHrBfxaa	Well , a relationship won't work if you cheat on her . If you want to keep her , don't cheat on her anymore . Girls are very emotional & she might not show how much it is really hurting her . & She must really love you if she hasn't left you let . I think you need to show her more respect before she does leave . If you can do that , then things might work out .|`|rUMGPXqwaa	Well you don't cheat on her anymore, right?<br>  <br>  Obviously she still likes you. She is comfortable with you and she knows that a serious relationship takes work and there is going to be drama. <br>  <br>  I think you should just chill out and try and be the best boyfriend you can be. Always treat her with respect, be nice to her, protect her and prove to her you are the man for her.<br>  <br>  If she already forgives you and wants to keep being with you, you shouldn't have a problem keeping her around if you treat her well. Maybe take her out on weekends and just try and make her happy.<br>  <br>  Good luck :)|`|sKUb0BOBaa	If you loved her so much you wouldn't have cheated on her in the first place. Of course she could find somebody better. Somebody that loved her more than anybody else, and stayed faithful.|`|ea073069c581a3e342f2f7ec101708f1aa	I'm sure she can find someone better, because you cheated on her.  Yes, guys get tempted, but try not to let it get to you.  If you love her, you would go back to her.  Just STOP cheating on her!  That's it, and start being honest and truthful with her.<br>  <br>  Hope I helped...=/|`|2f7c84a9d74e2f539d626705265b06c5aa	Honestly, YES...she can find someone better.  Someone that respects her!!...If you love her so much, why would you cheat on her??  You are LUCKY this woman is still with you!!!  Stop cheating on her.  Why would you do that if you love this woman!  Be strong, remember how amazing she is!  And I honestly doubt she is over it...|`|qxJ4KauPaa	she can always find someone better than you. but since she decided to accept you and even forgive your cheating on her, u should treat her really well and appreciate her. show that u r a different man now n u won't ever do that kind of thing again|`|026463f641c91751757ddeacfc3bac71aa	you don't know what love is.  she can do better then you.|`|8V38MYL3aa	You obviously have an insecurity problem and have affairs to make yourself feel more desirable.   She does deserve someone better and the fact that she takes you back each time has allowed you to carry on cheating on her.   <br>  <br>  Communication is very important, talk to each other and try and find out why you need to cheat.   Is it something she isn't giving you? maybe she doesn't re-assure you enough and you think she doesn't love you.   Ask her why she forgives you each time ( she must also have issues), she may feel she deserves that sort of treatment because of the way she was treated in childhood.   Would YOU forgive HER if it was the other way around?|`|G3p7cglxaa	my gf cheated on me 2 times and i got past it yeah it sucked but she changed. if u show her u changed then she will forget about all of it. i think people only think theres better people out there.|`|ge5x9NHxaa	It will be honest if you change your attitude and love her.  Stop cheating.  For her not to have messed up means she love you.  Stop hurting her.|`|lTsONvwQaa	how about you just stop cheating on her and if you cant do that then you should be single for awhile|`|C7KzBGlDaa	She can find someone better, and you know it.<br>  Buck up, or she will eventually come to her senses<br>  ?|`|UhWQuxLVaa	SO STOP CHEATING ON HA!!!!!!!!!!!SHE DOSENT DESERVE DAT KINDA PAIN|`|DybOqfGpaa	then b that better one and b with her forever|`|gxuMbZzdaa	Not to make you feel like ****, but she can find someone who won't cheat on her. Don't cheat anymore and maybe you'll be fine. In every other way, there is no telling. There are some weird people out there and girls are strange especially. Because you cheated on her, she may see you as the bad boy and have that desire that all girls have of fixing you. If you are fixed (not cheating anymore) then she will have a wonderful sensation every time you are the good guy, simply because she thinks she changed you. <br>  <br>  Don't hurt her again and you and her will live happily ever after most likely. On the other hand, (and this is very pessimistic) she now has three "get dick for free" cards. She may have no desire, but it will be easier for her to justify cheating on you after a big fight.|`|bmhT1IrTaa	make yourself a better person, show her that you can be the good guy and that your bad guyness is over. charm her with flowers and tell her how much you love her. breaking up with her would just break her heart, cause if she's been with you for this long and through all that she must love you more then anything. be luki to have a girl like her. treat her like the princess that she is. take her out more. expirement some in bed. spice things up. make sure she knows that you care about her. and that no other girl in the world can replace her.|`|2LARJIQqaa	hmm well lets see my boyfriend did that to me and i told him that as lond as he didnt do it again we were cool and we have been going steady now for about a year....i thnk that if she was unhappy should have talked to you now...if it helps try talking to her ask her what it is that you can do to make it up to her for what has happened. mean it when you say this-i know you will-say that your still upset over what you did and u want tp make it up to her no matter what. i know how much you love her so things WILL work out|`|lcp7uvoXaa	if u really loved her u wouldnt have ever cheated on her in the first place<br>  soo yeah she could probably find someone much better then u<br>  which means that when they say i love YOU they really mean only her.|`|YDVkBETnaa	DO YOU LOVE HER OR FEEL SO COMFORTABLE THEY SOMETIMES FEEL THE SAME<br>                                                     THC

If she has that much control over him, you in big trouble.|`|f9crUDTwaa	You can either let this tyrant control your life forever or you can leave home have a small wedding and get on with your life .

I mean what good is dating a hot guy who's as dumb as rocks?  I need mental stimulation as well, not just an amazing physical package.<br>  <br>  On the other hand, I also expect that there be a physical connection; something about his looks that draws me towards him, like his eyes, his smile, his posture.  I don't expect to be attracted to Mr. Universe, but a physical aspect that pulls be to him.|`|4VN9nmPAaa	well with the guy i like now, they're not that important because he is an amazing person, and i've always known that. but lately i find my self throwing his looks aside because he is such an interesting person.|`|xNMPvgFhaa	Not too important, as long as he/she has the quality.<br>  <br>  I would think more if the looks are too far below avarage, though...|`|C4N3TM3maa	Beauty is in the eye of the beholder

nsXNsanaaa	Well, I can't say for sure, but this girl sounds like a total flirt. If she said she'd go out with you when she was 'free,' I don't really think she'd take your relationship seriously. What other things could possibly be occupying her time? You guys talked a lot on the phone, but some girls just enjoy this and are extremely talkative. It depends on what YOU'RE looking for. Are you looking for a serious relationship, or just a 'teen thing'? I'm 14 and I'm 80% sure that she's just flirting for fun.|`|62chOZxcaa	wow dude were about the same age. haha <br>  um but yeah, i think shes big on the flirting part, maybe a little to big and/or she seems to be laidback a little to much, knowing my friends when they get asked out to anything by a guy they like regardless of how many they bf dey had, they wouldn't take it as a "ya probly", they'd be more upbeat about the situation.<br>  i'm guessing shes just not sure what she wants yet.|`|gxuMbZzdaa	Long distance relationship rarely work.

If he thinks, for one minute, you will take your panties off so he won't be mad at you, he has another think coming!  You did the right thing by stopping when you did and you should be proud of yourself for it!  He isn't even your boyfriend! He doesn't take you out or give you presents.  And now he is acting like he doesn't even know you.  No more stip card games, please. You aren't anybody's girlie magazine! Sorry if you lose a friendship but it sounds like it was going the wrong way, anyway. Good luck to you.  Stay the good girl that you are!|`|3lqjbusaaa	it seems like he was just using you. a lot of guys do that. i used to be used by guys that i liked a lot. so just find some other guy. it may take a while but you'll eventually find someone that likes you for who you are.|`|KZoGvD0Raa	i think what you need to do is find him and pull him aside.. just you to.. and say what you have to say... you arent going to get a word out of him in public with people around.. and he wouldnt have sat next to you if he HATES you... maybe he just felt rlly awkward and didnt say anything... i think you needa just get you two togethr and talk and say what you need to! hope i helped!|`|eLH97QiEaa	He just want sex without commitment and since your not willing to do that then i would just stop talking too him because it is not going to work out in the end. just make sure before you do anything like sending pictures or getting naked that you are in a relationship already.|`|bGQwz9yXaa	guys are like that.<br>  they use you for sex, and that's what he did.<br>  im sorry. next time you should build a relationship before having sex/sending pictures to eachother.|`|fZowCigGaa	uhm... im sorry to say this i know u like the guy but based from what i read... it sounds like he just used you to see u naked or something like that... just bcuz u didnt want to remove your panties he didnt talk to you anymore? he didnt get what he wanted so he's not treating you right... uhm... i suggest you forget about him and move on.. i know its hard since you have feelings for him but for a guy to let you get naked that's just not a right guy...<br>  <br>  hope i helped :D|`|7kQOU3raaa	well, first of all, i'm not judging you by what you did.<br>  <br>  but jake, like most guys his age, will say they dont want a relationship because blah blah blah. when really, a] they really don't and b] they just want a little something from you.<br>  <br>  you should be very hurt. he used you for his pleasure and you let him.<br>  learn from your mistake and his jerkness, and be stronger when the next guy comes around. <br>  <br>  because once you get older you will realize that most great guys grow up and want a good girl. not one that flaunts her body.<br>  so make sure a guy likes you for the amazing person you are and not for your body!!! :)
eLH97QiEaa	That's just what happens sometimes, you shouldn't be embarrassed because your dad is not as strong as you may be. I am also taller and stronger than my dad you just have to look at the bright side, you will be able to defend yourself in a abusive relationship.|`|I6WkplSmaa	It's totally normal to be stronger than your dad. In my culture, there is a saying whose meaning says that it's a fortunate thing for a family to have stronger children than the parents. So you're good!<br>  But not because you're stronger, you will disrespect your dad. Ultimately, he's the one giving you all this strength!<br>  Embrace your family and your strength, you will go very far... <br>  Good luck!|`|gRXy66dOaa	joke with him|`|f2Rgpvaraa	No, you should be proud.  My daughter is stronger than me and i'm fine with it.
OHfZFR31aa	No, not unless you can get a judge to grant you emancipation, showing you have enough money to financially support yourself or you are in a dangerous home situation|`|tGlnumvKaa	Yeah, but you have to go back home when your parents tell you to. <br>  <br>  Wait till you turn 18. It's not that far away.|`|th7C1aoaaa	My question to you, would be why?
gxuMbZzdaa	All guys want to have sex. The difference between guys is how much honor they have. Let him know you don't want to have sex with him until you are ready. If he is cool with this, then he is an honorable guy. If he's not he will make a big deal about it, and then you know he just wants sex. <br>  <br>  He likely told your friend that because he doesn't want to be in a serious relationship right now, but that doesn't mean he is just looking for sex. He just doens't want to get hurt. <br>  <br>  Bottom line, if he respects your wishes then he really likes you and actually cares for you. If not, he is an asshole waiting for his chance to get laid and get out. Or to just repeatedly get laid. <br>  <br>  Hope he's not an asshole! Best of luck.|`|4bfad7ab1091410a8f457928ef047b92aa	He seems very passionate, so he probably likes you. All men love sex and I'm sure he wants to have sex with you, but it doesn't sound like he only wants that. As far as the relationship thing goes, I would get to know him better. You may find that something has happened in his past that forces him to feel this way. Give a shot!|`|u8MOrhnvaa	he does, he likes you and wants you. I'd outside influences and don't analyse the situation so much. take things slowly. don't see him as much and don't say yes everytime he asks you out|`|HF2mVkiJaa	He already said he doesn't want a relationship.  If you are still confused, ASK HIM!  Otherwise I would say he probably wants to get laid, trying to be smooth.|`|RBpa5v1uaa	I do the exact same thing with my girlfriend. I do it because I want to feel her and make her happy. No it does not mean he just wants to get laid. He deff likes you.|`|8EEJJpK9aa	i think he REALLY likes you.<br>  <br>  whats wrong with liking someone, and wanting to do stuff with them?<br>  <br>  so no, he does not JUST want to have sex|`|054bfce8ce5933a083f96a2cc71caf09aa	He seems like a nice guy. If he goes too far tell him to knock it off.|`|ge5x9NHxaa	He does not want to have relationship with you, but do you think he is doing with you.  Study him very well before you fell head long for him and have sex with him.  Because after he must have feeled what you have under you he might bolt or better still long for another girl.  Be very careful because I am a guy.
IbhX8kHxaa	I have no clue...?|`|3mtDGwaZaa	The Shintoist wedding ceremony in Japan is a typical invented tradition. It began in the 20th century and, in its early years, it seemed to the Japanese a phenomenon of modernization and the anti-traditional. The truly traditional Japanese wedding ceremony took a long time and involved many steps of complicated rituals, involved high expense to both families, and often finished in a vulgar or unsophisticated manner. However, the invented ceremony involved none of these things. It was short and simple, economical and solemn. The intentions of its inventors were modernistic and nationalistic, but the ceremony was accepted because of its convenience. As long as it seemed new and anti-traditional, it was supported by the urban salaried workers and government officials, including military officers, who were the constructors of modern Japan but who hadn't changed the traditional wedding ceremony. The development of the Shintoist wedding ceremony came after the Second World War. High economic growth changed the industrial structure, many people moved from farming areas to the big cities to become salaried workers. The organizations and networks which had maintained local traditional wedding ceremonies fragmented, and the Shintoist ceremony together with the bridal industry took their place. Then the popularity encouraged by the bridal industry, plus the lack of choice, made the Shintoist ceremony a real tradition. At the same time, the Japanese style of wedding reception, newly put together and advertised by the industry, became another tradition. <br>  <br>  to tell u the truth i just coppied and paisted this from this web site.....maybe theres more info there!!! =) thnx for picking me as best answer on the other question i answered o yours!! answer mine please! =) <a href="http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;_ylt=Ai4X7Lwj57VWur8mfP8reszsy6IX;_ylv=3?qid=20090307115406AA91mqc">http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;...</a> <br>  thnx!!|`|dXZdcrTeaa	A shintoist wedding looks so traditional. it might be nice if you are a fern believer of shintoism in japan. the way they dress seems interesting. but it looks like they may work hard to make it so ritual like. Shintoism is a belief of like 800,000 gods and origami is one of the ways they pay respects to the tree god  and there is a sun god. it all seems Very interesting to learn about but it is not a religion that would be easy or possible for a foreigner to practice. my opinion if my girlfriend asked me to marry her first I would thank god but he is not invited to my wedding only want him to look over us. you know what I mean. shintoism just seems more about the rituals than it does the actual wedding. I would want every one to just be comfortable at my wedding and so nontraditional.  besides im gay so don't even get me started on traditional weddings. whats right and whats wrong. lol. I'm sure you would have to be born into Shintoism in order for it to be an easy religion.  japan does look like a  beautiful place. but it just appears to look that way its actually meant to be nontraditional. but who knows unless you are actually there. go to ask.com/images/shintoist wedding maybe just look so  ritual
c07v7O80aa	What you've got is AfrAIDS, a syndrome induced by incessant warnings about AIDS. You've had a lesson. You do risky things when you drink that much. Don't do that again, or get a more sober reliable friend to rein you in. <br>  <br>  There's no reason to believe the guy was poz. And you engaged in the lowest risk sexual act for HIV risk. (HIV is attacked by components of saliva.) But be warned. HepC does well in body fluids, and Herpes is everywhere. You have no doubt done any number of other non-sexual things in any given day that present a risk of chronic infection. You likely have a perfectly adequate immune system that is busily handling al sorts of things you're not even aware of. And that includes low virus count exposure to HIV, which is not a "super virus" that can overcome you with exposure to a single virus. <br>  <br>  Relax. But next time you audition for first chair skin flute, remember the feeling you have right now and take precautions like a sane person. Defeat AfrAIDS, get educated.|`|qZXIm3Ksaa	I seriously doubt that you were just "a little" drunk :|<br>  <br>  yes get tested!!! hiv can be contracted from oral/anal or vaginal intercourse.|`|gfHutvEFaa	did blood get into your mouth?<br>  <br>  This is 2009. If you still don't know how to get an STD/AIDS you need to google it and read up.|`|Sm9cq8KKaa	small, small chance. But get it checked out, anyway.|`|akcGfgdcaa	You should be ok. but here's a little snippet from an HIV/AIDS program website:<br>  <br>  The risk of getting HIV through receiving oral sex is very, very low.<br>  <br>  We can't say that there's zero risk, because there are a few cases of HIV infection in people who have no other known risk factors for HIV.<br>  <br>  Also, we can imagine a scenario where an HIV-positive person's mouth is bleeding when he or she is giving oral sex. This could increase the risk of infecting the partner. But, in general, transmitting HIV to someone receiving oral sex is probably a very rare occurrence.<br>  <br>  The risk of getting HIV through giving oral sex is low compared with unprotected vaginal or anal sex, but there is some risk. The risk appears to be higher if you have cuts or sores in your mouth. Risk also appears to increase with the amount of your partner's fluids that contact your mouth and throat. If there is blood in these fluids, that probably increases the risk as well. <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  If you feel paranoid that you may have caught something, then get yourself checked out. It will at least put your mind to rest.<br>  <br>  Good luck.|`|ULUpOqplaa	HIV is actually very fragile.  The saliva in your mouth probably killed it, unless you have any open sores in your mouth.  That doesn't do anything for the other dozen STD's you could have gotten.|`|HzCBOwlyaa	haha stop being freak out so much ...first what you did was eeek soo smutty but i wouldnt worry bout it too much..unless you bite him and made him bleed because sweetie thats the way you can truely get aids/hiv...also dont do that stuff anymore ! lol casual head isnt back!|`|Mxe36NZEaa	At least your not pregnant...<br>  <br>  You could have an STD, not especially good chances of that, but I would get tested just so you can have a little peace of mind.|`|d6bb91335d2d467b86fe9b280c4c812eaa	Best thing to do is go to doctors any way.

By getting tested now you can stop worrying about it if they find you didnt get it, and if you did, the quicker you get ARV's the better your chances are of killing it.

Take me out drinking with you next time. You will have to be tested several times over the next 1.5 yrs. BTW are you married?|`|E638ukebaa	You can get aids from oral sex. if there is any open wounds cuts etc.<br>  I assume you're joking so I won't worry too much|`|MHMndoCcaa	high chances if yu dont know the dude or where he's been!<br>  And get tested asap|`|bGQwz9yXaa	you should get tested right away.<br>  and drink less next time :]|`|MjSLQlIHaa	WHAT??????

You could also have other nasty STDs like Herpes...|`|OHfZFR31aa	Yes you can get HIV from oral sex. It can take up to 6 months for HIV antibodies to show up. Besides HIV, there are other diseases as well like herpes that will show up within a few weeks of contact
7d768c46ae3bc8900df03faec5161f4eaa	I had some friends divorce over one of those games.  Two couples did now that I think about it, though one of them may have been World of Warcraft.<br>  <br>  Look... you can't change his mind for him, you can only present him with the facts on the ground and lead him to make the right decisions.  I would suggest that having a heart to heart isn't working, so maybe its time for some counseling.  That would give you an environment that will give you a chance to express your feelings.  If it was just the two of you I'd say that maybe you should join him in playing.  That would be something you both could share... but its tough when you have kids to find the time for that much playing.  Still.... you might give that a try... join him in the game, get some idea of why he's so into it.<br>  <br>  Finally, you will need to decide how YOU want this to go.  If he refuses to give up the game, then he's decided what he wants.  Now it'll be up to you to decide if you can live with a part time husband.  Keep in mind that if you do leave him, he'll have the kids at some point for visits and he'll either realize that he needs to step up...... or.... he'll ignore them for the game like he does now.  Hope for the former, but fear the latter....|`|0AShsMsoaa	take all the game consoles ect, and all his clothes and drop them off at his mothers, with a note that since he acts like a little boy he really needs to be at home with his mommy and not in an adult marriage with you and his children.  <br>  <br>  and change your locks and block your phone.  <br>  <br>  this wouldnt work for me for a week, much less for 3 years.   <br>  <br>  try it.|`|c07v7O80aa	His addiction is up to him. You can't fix it. How and whether it affects you and your kids is up to YOU. YOU have to decide how many rounds of quit (when you threaten) and restart you're willing to try. Set a time beyond which you're NOT going to keep wondering and waiting. On that date, if there's still a problem, carry out your plan to move on.|`|AA12322129	Time for an ultimatum.  You need to tell him in no uncertain terms he is avoiding your marriage and that is causing problems by playing this game.  He is not even giving you time nor the kids and if he does not quite you will leave or toss his stuff out when he is gone and change the locks.  I am not saying divorce this guy but maybe this will wake him up.|`|z7BTeUKvaa	Oh, that's sad.  I'm sad for your husband, because he's missing out on so much.  The kids won't have many memories of him.  I would really suggest marital counseling.  At least you'll know that your concerns were heard.  Find a counselor today.  If your husband refuses to go with you, go alone.|`|Mn1ilPECaa	when i say lol, im not laughing at u its bc i have the same scenario. when i start felling as if im being set on the side lines, i make future plans with with hunny. go to a movie, bowling, whatever to get him away from the house. I don't nag him about it it just makes u look insecure. your making a step in the right direction doing things by yourself in this u will become more confident. ull branch off from felling u need his attention to fell validated. me, im glad hunny likes his game he is home and surely if he is not out and away from the house i take it as if he is content in his life. truthfully there is not a lot u can do to detour him from what he enjoys, and if u did succeed he may pick up a worse habit that mentally or emotionally u may not be able to handle. when people ask u about ur marriage, just tell them we have a mature relationship and it Works for us. (with a smile) I think u have been handling it well. it sounds as if u have. felling as if ur falling out of love is normal especially as the relationship matures, but putting little reminders of each other still being there is the key. like doing things together every now and then. my keys i a relationship are, forgiveness(bc it is for you not the other person) understanding, hugs kisses, space and individuality.|`|LT5HlW3kaa	Addition is addition and it sounds like he is addicted to this game. I would make him choose because it will only get worse. He will keep playing the game and not spending any time with you or your children as long as you put up with it. Put a stop to it now, or move on. Good luck.|`|bGQwz9yXaa	you should tell him it's either your family, or the game. and tell him that if he ever signs up for it again, it's over.|`|th7C1aoaaa	Ask him how half sounds. Tell him that's what he will be paying after you leave him.|`|FQNwJM2Waa	if that is on the computer then try to delete it from your computer if that does not work put a parental control on it you can do this with most game systems too. and if he gets mad try to make it up to him usually when guys start to realize that the game is completed they get really bored of it and stop playing it to.|`|Klb8kTtDaa	A lot of men have this crazy video game addiction. <br>  It is time to talk to him about it again.  Do you eat dinner together? Then after the kids are away from the table, have a serious (and rational) discussion with him.  Don't give an ultimatum unless you are going to follow through.  <br>  He should be able to have that stress release, but not at the detriment of everything else.  Maybe work out a schedule of a few hours a week for him?  My husband had this same kind of passion towards his video games, but after a few discussions, he realized that real life is much more fun than a virtual life.|`|f1907Oehaa	First of all... tell him life is so short, what is he gaining from playing games all day long? What is his purpose in life? Eat? Sleep? Play? ..no. give him materials on religion, both of your should learn about Islam.... Our main purpose is to worship one God... and time is given to us so that we do good deeds. <br>  Spending time with one's family, making your wife and children happy is good deed, being intimate with one's wife is good deed... etc<br>  I sincerely want you to supplicate: "Oh Lord, If Islam is the right religion that I should follow, then make my husband turn away from the video games and if he does, then surely I will enter Islam as a Muslim"<br>  There is no harm in trying!<br>  <br>  I would also take charge, and just hide the game, Playstation etc.|`|fb9074afcf17de2b9a0eb50aef064c6eaa	This sounds all too familiar...I went through this. It sucks soooo bad so i totally know how you feel. I basically said ok if this is really what he wants...then let him have it. I stopped cooking for him, I left him in that room to play and would act as though he didn't exist. When he decided that's enough and he wanted to go to bed...the door was locked! After day 3...we sat down and had a talk...so far he plays maybe 2 times a week 1-2 hours. Husbands are like children!!! It's crazy. So i would try that since talking didn't work for you...just like me. Don't give up no matter how long it takes...if he comes to reality every once in a while and askes you whats wrong...tell him to keep on playing if that's what he wants to do...But that you have more important things to do then to be with him. I hope it helps. I know it sounds drastic but it worked for me. My husband acted like he didn't care and then slowly realized i was right!!! <br>  Good Luck :)|`|ocG7G0N2aa	When I met my boyfriend of 2 years he played world of warcraft, this caused many fights and me feeling alone, uncared for and unloved due to his excessive nature of gaming.<br>  I think that you have to look deeper than the game, it had more to do with commitment issues than gaming. In the game, they can be whoever they want, there are no bills, no arguments, you can be the king, warrior, whatever you want. Reality is much more difficult, you have responsibility, commitments and often the game is just an escape from all of that, they feel important.  Perhaps what he is lacking is feeling important, not that it has anything to do with you, it is something internal. I am not sure why being a boyfriend, husband, father isnt enough. <br>  I think you both should try counceling, to try to figure out where he is feeling inadaquate, and how the 2 of you can being to communicate again.

That means that you are the good person so do not think for a minute that you screwed up.... you  were just being good and chose to see the best in a person. IT IS NOT YOUR FAULT. <br>  <br>  You will later find a man who does not lie and truly gives a squat about life, love and commitment. We (as men) are out there.<br>  <br>  Be advised. You should break off all contact. For one he can not get you locked up for texting him..... and him saying that says much.<br>  <br>  My bet is that when his other thing does not work out at some point he will come sniffing around again with a big old sob story. Problem is trust is the basic issue in a relationship. You would always wonder.<br>  <br>  If he was screwing around he could have at least been smart enough to do it on the sly. I in no way condone it. It is more in the way that he has utter disrepect to not even be smart.... that means he has no care for you at all.|`|SovaFpN8aa	No, he is a cheater, and he has made it clear he has moved on.

0bYcYz2jaa	It is a sad thing to have to leave everything you know behind.  When my parents separated, we had to move across town.  I had to leave my nice little neighborhood with our three bedroom house to move into some rundown apartments.  My mom bought the apts so we converted one of the buildings into a house and lived there for about 4 years.  Then we moved again, to another part of the city.  I love that house more than our first one now.  We were so much happier there, that we made lots of memories to ease the loss of our previous life.  I was 10 or 11 the first move and 14 on the last.  My mom still lives in that big old house, that I helped sheetrock, tile, carpet and so many other things.  I love to visit.  My dad made us miserable in those last few years and breaking away from the memories helped I think.  It wasn't easy and I hated it at first, I mean what 12 year old wants to learn to install a ceiling fan?  My point is that if you and your mom are happier, then you will be happier even while your heart breaks for the memories you are leaving behind.  I know we were.  Good luck, it won't be easy, but it will be worth it in the long run.|`|tY4hOjqdaa	Divorce is not a good thing no matter how u play it. The kids suffer the most. There is not much you can do. It is a decision ur parents have made. The best u can do is try to focus on the other parts of ur life and hope for the best. My parents divorced when I was 10 yrs. old. I focused on school and had my brother and sister to help me along in school if i needed help. In your situation things will change in the short term but after the dust settles you will get into more of a norm and things can progress positively from there. I wish you the best and hopes things work out well for you.|`|57XKYEEKaa	My parents just got divorced as well. I was upset.

Sound good>?|`|DgFhlJvYaa	My mother & father divorced back in 99 & I've been living with my mom ever since 2000. It's up to you what you wanna do. Since you don't like your father your better off living your mom because as you get older your mom will no how to handle you & certain situation's that life is gonna throw at you & your dad might not be able to give you good advise. It's up to you what you wanna do. Just because you move with you mom doesn't mean you don't love your dad but every girl needs their mother more than their father. My dad hardly came around & I was living with my mom but in the end it all turned out good. & as for my dad I have a step father that's been taking care of me since the day I moved with them & it's been 9 year's. Just don't worry about it to much. Thing's will fall into place & you'll find that you made the right choice.
1k7LIZVWaa	I have seen a thousand sunrises with a man I love.  I am lucky enough to be married to him.|`|th7C1aoaaa	travel the world.... and you will see them too.
g9vw4ovGaa	The best thing for you to do, if you love this new guy, is to stop talking to him. You're just leaving the door to the past wide open. It makes a man feel insecure. My ex waited til the night before I got married to my husband to tell me that he was still in love with me and had bought me an engagement ring. It took me a very long time to shut that door on the past, I had to look forward to my future with my husband. Trust me, you broke up for a reason, and this new guy deserves all of you. This is from personal experience, and honey I know it is hard. If you don't shut the door to the past, a new one can't open.  If this Patrick truly loved you as much as he says he does, he would have moved closer to you. A man will do anything for the woman he loves.|`|th7C1aoaaa	yes|`|z7BTeUKvaa	You actually CAN stop talking to him.  Pretty easily too, if you really wanted to.  I'm married to my first love.  We broke up and were totally apart with very limited contact for 5 years.  Then he moved back to where I lived, we were both available, and we got to know each other again.  Now we're married.  So it can happen, but I don't believe making Scott feel bad and insecure is the right thing for you to do.  So be an adult and make a choice.  Pick Scott, Patrick, or neither.  But make a choice.|`|veZLfnGFaa	Please put this in Singles & Dating - thanks :)|`|1k7LIZVWaa	You might try your question is 'Singles and Dating'.  <br>  <br>  My first love told me he never regretted our first time, (we were both virgins).  He didn't say he was still in love with me but it was 15 years after the fact.  I was surprised he thought to mention it.  It made me feel good.  We both married others and had been married for a long time.  No sparks or flirting just a chance encounter that was brief.  It was nice to see him.  Haven't seen him since.  That was over 10 years ago now.
cZ8XXVYCaa	I'm sure you're a good friend and you really shouldn't worry about it, but I'm sure just by saying that wont make you feel better but all you need to do really is just show that you're there for them, and about you becoming jealous and annoyed you just need to relax and just catch yourself doing it, and I know that sounds difficult but you just need to try to be friendlier to your friends and just try to apologize when you get moody. About the arguments thing, you just need to realize that you're not always right, and you need to be the bigger person and say that you're wrong and that you apologize, and if you're arguing based on opinions you just need to say that everyone thinks differently and instead of telling people they're wrong just say you accept their opinion but you just so happen to feel differently|`|nc0hg3H1aa	that is completely normal! when you get jealous, think "what do they  NOT have that i have?" Remember, jealousy is NORMAL! Its not the end of the world if they always win arguments, try to out smart them..<br>  Good luck|`|2K6hHhUaaa	well i spose trreat them how u want to be treated<br>  ignor them if they piss u off and let them no that theyve done something wrong then talk to them again after a while and like arrange to dos tuff<br>  always think happy and try to laugh and dont care if they try to put u down or anythin cause u noe that there acting jelous|`|18oPqW2gaa	just be nice to everybody so nobody can say anything bad about you i have a friend and shes really loud and mean to most people i was turning into her but i caught it, even if you really don't like someone just say hi and maybe ask he or she to sit with you @ lunch make there day and just be the best you there is|`|UEJDlUWJaa	To admit when your wrong and not to always try to win arguements and just try and keep eachother happy!<br>  Trust is a key point<br>  always winning arguements isnt the best thing to do it can annoy your friend so just try and sorting things out not argue about them|`|uojR7vmEaa	always boost them up like if they ask you does this look alright then say yeah that looks really pretty.Randomly  ask them if they want to go out and always listn to there problems even if you dont want to.
xNMPvgFhaa	Yes, when I was young I did not talk with my brother for a long time.<br>  <br>  Sometimes it is best not to say what you think too much. Before you say something back at her, ask yourself if it's really mattered. <br>  If it does not, then hold your tongue. If it is, then try to talk to her, patiently.|`|sSTuay1Vaa	Yes and it's awful.  It tears up your mom and dad really bad.  Been there done that.  Recently though my 16 year old nephew, son of the sister I do not get along with just took a combination of pills and did survive.  For my nephew I'll do anything and that meant having to be social to my sister, it was all worth it.  Put it behind you and grow up.  More people are missing out than just the two of you.
kn2glb6zaa	Threesome! Problem solved!|`|QP8LdPLeaa	Cynthia hes not the only dain guy on this earth. its not his fault if he likes someone else. why get depressed over a guy.|`|MbHwygxbaa	Honestly, you cant change how your best friend feels, just let them deal with it, and if doesnt work out you can see how it goes with your guy friend|`|ge5x9NHxaa	Don't throw yourself on a guy.  If you do there's always a consequence, regret.  Forget him and move on, you find another person that love you most.  That event will not be the only event you will attend in life.  More is waiting for you, which you will attend with someone that really love you.|`|xJ4ooDT4aa	Ask someone else you think is cute and nice to the upcoming social. It will get your mind off things.|`|1WQTxqUmaa	go on with your life, forget about him, be happy for your friend.|`|upVQxbmwaa	It will be hard, but the best thing to do is probably just let them be together. She will realize that she doesn't want to be with him, and he will realize that he made the wrong choice after she used him. But remember she could realize that she does like him after they spent time together and want to actually be with him. I've been in this situation before. I just hid it, and told myself to stop liking the guy. Mind over matter, and it helped.|`|eLH97QiEaa	find another guy there are plenty other the fish in the sea. Guys will come and go, friends 'may' come and go. So just don't get all depressed over a guy who has no clue you can also let him know you think he is attractive|`|8bWIL8RXaa	i know exactly how u feel ...the same thing is happening to me he wants to go to prom with my best friend!! well im just trying to be happy for the both of them!!maybe you should try finding someone else|`|8EEJJpK9aa	confront your friend , tell her everything|`|epD0VxFkaa	try your hardest to forget about him it will be hard but thats the onl yway|`|dSA7TEwUaa	get over him|`|htz7NwT3aa	wow, don't listen to the threesome guy. <br>  Honestly, I've been in your position before. STAY AWAY!|`|7kQOU3raaa	the same thing happened to me.<br>  i liked this guy and my bff knew...then all the sudden he started liking her and she started liking him...<br>  and they are dating now...<br>  its sucked at the time but i value our friendship.<br>  and its awkward at times but i don't like him anymore.<br>  and sometimes i get really bitter about it, because friends aren't supposed to do that. but she really is a good friend and you can't help how you feel so i can't blame her, he's such a great guy! lol <br>  <br>  all i can tell you is to move on, theres someone better out there for you and worth your time. and when you meet him, you'll be able to give him your WHOLE heart and not the pieces that are left from previous relationships. :)<br>  <br>  oh, and about your friend playing with his emotions, i would sit her down and tell her what she might be doing. if she's really your friend she'll understand and not get mad at you for telling her. just make sure your not attacking her with everything.  make it casual.|`|34JOgL75aa	Don' tdo anything...life happens this is part of life. It's better to loose a crush than a best friend. And if you like him it's probably just jealousy because he told you he likes her. SO don't worry it'll turn out alright, that is if you listen!|`|prqUBLkRaa	what u need 2 do is make him into u , like the things he likes <br>   guys allways want a girl that loves the stuff they r into <br>   he will lose's his mind off of her and so go 4 u.
AA10652010	The best  thing is to keep it simple. You can go up and say" HI,i"m  so and so" But that's kind of hard , especially if you feel like she'll be wondering why your talking to her out of the blue .<br>   So you can start with something more simple. Just something like when you're sitting near her, you can ask her what time it is, or you can take out some gum and ask her if she wants some. I know it sounds stupid but it shows her you are friendly and willing to talk and you're  not really putting yourself out there on a limb..<br>   Then maybe next time you can just say Hi.. Since you have already talked to her this would be a normal thing to do. <br>  You can play it by ear. If she' s friendly she might say something to you,to start more of a conversation, if not ,remember, there are always three things you can talk about. You, the other person, or the situation your in. So you might want to ask her a question about the situation you're in. <br>  Also remember most people like to talk about themselves. You could  tell her she has a nice shirt and ask her where she got it. What' even better is if she got a logo or design on it or something you can ask her about it, or say you like it. Then if she seems friendly you can say "I'm so and so by the way"<br>  You don't' have to start out with anything great. start small and relax about it.|`|S9jmWU7Yaa	Is she new to school all-together, or did she start in September? Because if she's new, she might appreciate someone talking to her, especially someone older.<br>  If she's ever sitting alone or something, just go and say hi and ask her if she'd like some company.|`|yaAhsEwxaa	when i was little i used to just go up to people and be like "hey im monica" that always worked.or just go up and ask what classes they have or if they like the new school and such.be friendly.|`|htz7NwT3aa	just walk up to her and say hi. Let the convo flow from there|`|a8XOrp8maa	Yes I fully know how u feel... so akward I find it to talk to people but porobably compliment her like "wow I that's pretty nailpolish" or something like that to start the conversation|`|04F4149yaa	Well, if you see her in the hallways say hi and introduce yourself. If she smiles that's a good thing :D Keep doing that and maybe you can ask her to join you at lunch sometime :P|`|YkJeYixnaa	ok go to her,find a time where youre free and she's free too and say<br>  "Hey,so youre new here right,anyways my name is ........(watever youre name is),whats youre name?....hmm i was just wondering would you like to be my friend?"and keep the conversation going and youll become great friends.
SvjjIJwiaa	Why don't you ask him who he fancy's? But without asking him out. Good luck xx|`|MbHwygxbaa	just ask him if he wants to hang out sometime, thats a pretty fool proof plan|`|pberHIRPaa	Guys are hard to read, but you have to do something or you'll never know. Suggest hanging out, pretending "as friends" and see where it goes from there. Good luck!|`|1Q9D7pzAaa	Well he could just be acting friendly. But I don't think you can get him to tell you if he likes you or not without asking him. What I would personally do is walk up to him/ call him/ text him and say/ write Do you like me more then a friend? Because I have been feeling some vibes from your direction. I did that do a guy and it turned out that he like me, ALOT!|`|gxuMbZzdaa	Sound to me like he likes you. Just wait for him to get the nerve up to tell you. Otherwise you pretty much have to tell him. Give him oppurtunities to ask you out, or both of you go out with a group of mutual friends. If he likes you he will tell you at some point. If not, no sweat because your still in high school and you won't care about this situation (maybe) in a couple of years. Good luck.|`|8EEJJpK9aa	idk, i would just ask him who he likes, and if he doesnt answer its prob. you|`|epD0VxFkaa	lol wow ok yea its always hard to get someone you like that you know likes you to admitt it and sometimes what couldve been flies away but i think what you should do is play a game...i like to call it what comes to the light...ok it works like this...you go back and forth asking questions about eachother that you dont already know and let him start and then after you asked like 5 questions be like do you like me? and im pretty sure hell tel you it worked for me several times goodluck

1k7LIZVWaa	He's a lying, cheating, and abusive man.  Why you want to put up with that plus his drinking is beyond me.  I would be gone.  You are being made a fool of and you are letting him act this way.  Quit being nice and move on with your life.  You need help.|`|7e8be8f471de4c60d8884f52a597ddc2aa	First you need to get a back bone and stand up for things you don't like. You need to be strong for you and your family. He is never let me repeat that NEVER going to change and why should he you stay there meaning you have no problem with this type of behavior and he will continue because he has no problem with the way he is living...<br>  Next get rid of him pack his bags and leave then outside and file for divorce and get what ever monies you deserve for you or your family. Next after you find yourself inside and out and heal from this move on there are a lot of men out there that do not treat their woman like this and you could have one just take a deep breath and move forward you deserve better and you will be happier with someone else you don't need to spend your time checking up on all day everyday you has that kind of time, honey you are a good person maybe too good I know I couldn't do it. Take charge and live the way you deserve and believe me ts lots more than this. Good Luck.|`|8ac2e5cbdd946ee60c803052559873c5aa	I don't think it's going to be possible for you.  It wouldn't be possible for me, anyway.<br>  <br>  And for all that you are telling him, how much listening is he doing--I mean really hearing you?  <br>  <br>  Because I've been where you are.  It doesn't get any better.  And so you're bringing a precious life into the world.  Decide how you want your home life to be for this child and act accordingly.<br>  <br>  I believe marriage is sacred, that it is even above the mother-child relationship.  But when a man will not be a man, will not put his family first, when he puts his wife in the position of having to choose between what's best for herself and her child and her husband, it's time for the man to be set free.  A man who wants to be married doesn't act like this.<br>  <br>  Added:  My son is now 12 (ex left when he was under 2).  I will be surprised if he ever takes one drink.  He knows that if his father could have gotten sober we'd all still be a family.  He doesn't hate his father, but he knows his father and is a great kid, all around.  I don't know if I could feel as good about his future if I had stayed with my ex.|`|veZLfnGFaa	You must really love him to stay in this.  He messes up - says I'm sorry and you forgive him. It's time to stop.  Find someone to watch your daughter and get a job.  Get out of this.  Don't be his doormat.|`|AA11278694	The best thing you can do is let him rot in Jail . I would get a divorce as soon as possible and get child support . Get the H as far away from him as possible. If his commander knows all the information you just talked about here then hes going to get kicked out of military . I know you dont have money and its going to be tough . Probably you should go back to your parents till you get a job and settled|`|gfHutvEFaa	He acts like this and does these things because of one thing.<br>  <br>  YOU LET HIM.<br>  <br>  He cheats~you take him back. He hits you~ you take him back. Do you see a pattern here.<br>  <br>  When your daughter grows up, chances are she will choose a man just like her father, because that's all she knows. Do you want you daughter in the same situation you are in?|`|th7C1aoaaa	Tell him what you have told us.|`|LX0EOsCHaa	Get rid of his no good cheating a$$. he will never stop. go find a good man|`|BLaEQfdDaa	you need to tell him, how you feel and what you want, changes for you and him but mostly him. EX my ex wife didnt tell me things on how she felt or what I was doing wrong until one day she told me she didnt love me anymore and wanted a divorce.  After the divorce was final we have talked about everything for hours on hours, to the point we both was able to see what had happen, and it was both our faults, but is done and over now. she has moved on. BUT for you its not to late to try to fix this, you have a child that is very important to think about. Love isnt easy but if its there between you and him, if really cares, loves you he will stop what he is doing to you, but you have to tell him that its hurting you, to the point if things dont change you want out, because you said you told him before maybe things were for awhile but now there not. THIS TIME MEAN IT, BECAUSE YOUR THE ONLY ONE GETTING HURT HERE!!!|`|fLU63N4kaa	OH MY GOLLY GOSH WOMAN! Are you blind?! Why are you with this horrible, sorry excuse for a man? Open your eyes, have some dignity and respect for yourself.|`|fb9074afcf17de2b9a0eb50aef064c6eaa	Wow!!! I think that you should go to a therapist to help build your self esteem because you don't realise how much your worth. No one has the right to treat you this way. You should have left when he pulled your hair....or the first time he layed a hand on you. I know it's hard, but do it for your Daughter. <br>  I went through something similar...not the cheating thing but the abuse and there is no way you can live like that. Despite all the crazyness i went through it was so hard to leave. Once i did...I met an amazing man and realized that i was worth alot more. You should concentrate on your daughter and on youself above everything. File for divorce...try to get a job that will allow you to have enough money for a nanny and your bills or move in with a friend or family member who will babysit for you while you work and figure things out. Your husband...or rather your hopefully soon to be ex husband needs to give you child support!!!! I would go public with this and tell his Military Officer. Good Luck!!|`|rNUB8B6Vaa	This is what you call a severely abusive relationship. I know. I've been through that too.  He does these things to you because he knows there is nobody else thats gonna take his ****. He knows that you will always be there. No matter what hes done or whatever.  No matter what he does or however he tries to fix it, it will always be in the back of your mind.  My best friend is going through a similar situation, shes only 31 mind you, and this is aging her. In her mind he is the guy she is supposed to be with.  Because of him she got her kids taken away.  She is completely brain washed. She pulls his *** out of  bars. this one time he insisted on driving they wrecked and now she's living with severe backpain.  If you don't listen to anything anyone ever tells you, Im begging you leave him, for your kids, for you and for your own sanity.  I will be hard at first but you will know you made the right decision. Our kids don't need to see this. We don't realize how much it affects them. They are the ones that take it the hardest. Right now, take that money and get out as fast as you can. The police will surely understand especially if there are prior records. If someone does find out and report that. You don't wanna find yourself in that situation. Im now gettin angry at this I better stop.  Good luck to you and If you need someone to talk to. Im here.

sSTuay1Vaa	Is mom single?  Is the neighbor single?  If yes in both cases they are consenting adults and can do what they want.  However, mom might want to consider the fact that he's isn't treating the girlfriend too nicely by running to her all the time and possibly flirting and who knows what. If it's that easy to do that to the girlfriend, how will he treat mom?  Once they cheat they usually do it again.  And both mom and neighbor need to consider the kids are involved in this too......|`|2C2WY3H1aa	Sounds like he likes her, and that she should ignore him.

LT5HlW3kaa	I think that is smart, and I would just tell him exactly how you explained it on here.

Good luck.|`|gxuMbZzdaa	If he wants to be in a long term relationship with you, then letting him know that you would rather go out on a public date is good. He will understand.

Yes i made the effort|`|qW0WodEVaa	dont use any of the "advice" others gave you..<br>  <br>  Just come up with some good excuse , eg family in town etc.<br>  <br>  PS: if you tell him you are not ready to go with him to camp -- he will most likely take that answer that you do not want him and he will start looking for other girl who does want him..<br>  <br>  so you decide|`|42A0cw0Faa	I think you need to come out and tell him how you really feel. If you can't do that then maybe you need to step back and look at this relationship you want to have with him. If you can't tell him where is the honesty and trust|`|hnCDmgyEaa	I agree with the 1st person it should be about you and him together.|`|TkgVGbj5aa	Just have sex for him, make your man happy...but make sure you take birth control pills.|`|oY1YzPMzaa	I would just tell him exactly what u wrote on here. If he shares the same feelings about u, he will understand and will have no problem waiting!|`|CxRJwJsraa	I'd pretty much tell him just like you told us.<br>  <br>  You really like him and you want to see this last, so you want to be careful. You aren't ready for a camping trip, but maybe suggest something else you can do to spend some time together.|`|9c16f104f9589fa27971d779def0ac39aa	The best way.. since your both mature adults (hopefully..) is to not beat around the bush and be honest.  Don't make it about him either, make it about both of you.  It's not an issue, you just feel that he's really important to you, you don't want to rush things.|`|lTsONvwQaa	tell him you want to go on a few date b4 you go camping with him and that you want to take things slow so they dont get complicated|`|3aeBqLORaa	"honey im not ready but when i know you i will i still want to go out before i get intament plz dont take this the wrong way"<br>  And tell it to his face!!!not text or im or phone|`|XkPgw7ZRaa	Dear Angel,<br>  <br>  I have the easy answer.  Tell him that you insist in bringing your own tent and get his reaction.<br>  <br>  Anthony|`|K5SGG1QYaa	just say 'sounds great, let's do it in a few months' and he'll get the idea. if he does ask why, or just jokingly say you want to save your first trip together for when you've run out of things to do on dates/in the town you live in (and say it in a way thats implying that you want to date more before going away with him). if you don't really want to talk about it, just say your too busy right now, but you'd love to in a few months.<br>  <br>  i know everyone is all 'tell him you're not ready, tell him all your feelings' but i think that will just make a serious issue/conversation out of something pretty minor, and make it seem like you've read too much into his invitation. from what you've said, it sounds like you do really like him, and would actually like to go away with him, its just not the right time. i think big relationship conversations are uncalled for at such an early stage, and he might see that as a rejection, even though you seem happy with him. keep it simple, like i suggested, and it'll be fine :)
whmkGDG8aa	Whoa... so I think you're me. Hahaha<br>  <br>  I am planning my wedding not in 6 but yes in 8 months.  We're practically done now anyways so yes it can be done in 6.<br>  <br>  We are having our wedding on a Tuesday at Fyvie Castle because the two weekends around the time frame we wanted were booked up.<br>  <br>  My fiance lives in Scotland, and we are getting married there.  Mind you I am living there after so it is a bit different.  But my family is very understanding.  They make money jokes from time to time "Don't expect a present!" they say.  But I'm not bothered in the long run.<br>  <br>  I have always wanted a large wedding (coming from a big family)  but am understanding that having 50 people in an amazing place will be so much more what I want in the end.<br>  <br>  I wish you the best of luck, and feel free to ask me any other questions if you have any!|`|hsZnjZvoaa	This is just what I'd personally prefer...<br>  <br>  A little elbow grease, and you can plan a wedding in 6 months - it takes focus, and the ability to make a decision and stick by it.  Often a weekday ceremony will cost less because the weekends are a premium.<br>  <br>  As far as my partner coming from a different country and having my ceremony there it would depend on their rules for international marriages, and also any marriage filing requirements in my country <br>  <br>  I'd consider a weekday wedding IF it were a small event -- it is often hard for guests to travel, or even to be out late, on work/school nights.  My first wedding was not huge, and being a little bit older, if I were to do it again, I'd probably want something small and intimate - of course I'm something of an introvert, so it would suit me fine. <br>  <br>  best wishes.|`|mkA615Ataa	well, I'm going to be getting married on a thursday and my sister was married abroad so you can do what you want, getting married in the week can sometimes save money so you can then afford more food, wine etc. getting married abroad though you have to consider all your family and friends may not be able to make it, vice versa for him. as for intimate or large wedding, that is entirely your choice, hardest part is trimming the guest list for an intimate do.|`|CQsD09D6aa	Of course one can organize a wedding in 6 months or even less. It would depend on how elaborate you want it to be. I would prefer a small intimate wedding to a large one.|`|REvNbUMxaa	It is possible to organize a wedding in 6 months i know lots of people who have. My Mum and Dad did it in 2 months!!!<br>  <br>  It is an option but i'm not sure i would.<br>  <br>  If my family and friends could afford to come with me then that's a big possibility.<br>  <br>  I think i'd like a large one. Most of the time you only get to do it once so why not!!|`|Xzvoz6mcaa	I planned my wedding in 7 months, and I know alot of people who have done it in 6 months or less.<br>  I might would get married on a week day if it was somewhere I loved, but I probably would try to find another place if it wasn't a date we wanted.<br>  I would get married in my own country/state.<br>  I had a large wedding and loved it!|`|AA12040504	I think you should get married on the day that is most convenient for you and your fiance. I don't think God would be angry if you don't get married on a weekend day. If it saves you money too why not!! Weddings are expensive. I think you should also get married where you both agree on. If you like it better there why not? My fiance is from Mexico originally and it is waaaay cheaper to get married there and you get 5 star treatment the WHOLE time!! I want an elegant but simple wedding with my family and closest friends.. It's your wedding day !! Best of luck and congrats!

veZLfnGFaa	You can expect him to deny it.  You can expect going through court with blood tests to prove it's his child and maybe you can expect some child support from him.  You can also expect that he will probably have nothing to do with this child.  Plan on raising this child alone and being the best parent you can be.  :)|`|c07v7O80aa	You DO have a relationship with this man. If you have the child, he's father to your child. You have to decide if you let him know about this and if you want support for the child. If you want support or if he wants a relationship with his child (which is his absolute right), you're going to have a relationship with his crazy wife, since you will be sharing her family income, and your child will be sharing her husband, if she stays with him.|`|CcgDj9GIaa	You're despicable<br>  <br>  *edit<br>  <br>  I'm not married to anyone; therefore I do not fear you.<br>  <br>  If I was married to a good man, I wouldn't have to fear you, because although you may try to flaunt your "goods" all over him, he will never give you the satisfaction of a passing glance.<br>  <br>  If I was married to a douchebag like your baby's father, I wouldn't have to fear you either.  I would quickly get a divorce, and move on with my life.  Have someone like you deal with his "inabilities".|`|0AShsMsoaa	his wife is a nut job? uh, she isnt the pathetic, utterly immoral  single mom  who is knocked up by another womans husband.  <br>  <br>  you couldnt even bother to use foolproof birth control?  <br>  <br>  imagine that!!!  <br>  <br>  this is why denny's will always have waitresses working the graveyard shift.<br>  <br>  i dont fear you, stupid.  i am the person you will have to wait on at 3 in the morning.  i dont fear you, i pity you.|`|5ajPMlrqaa	What can you expect? An angry wife.<br>  You already know what it's like to raise a child alone, so you know what to expect on that front. If you're absolutely certain that this man is the father of your baby, & it was not a relationship, you can't expect he'll want a relationship with the baby. If that happens - good chance it will - you can expect your child will grow up not knowing his/her daddy, & from that, you can expect a lot of pain. If your baby is a girl, you can expect that she will, probably for much of her life, go looking for love in the arms of men to fill the hole in her heart left because her daddy was never there.<br>  <br>  So what is your real question- you already knew all this from your current experiences?|`|fLU63N4kaa	Well people come onto these kind of questions to judge, which I'm not going to bother doing. I'll remain impartial to my views on cheaters and "mistresses" for my answer.<br>  <br>  I wouldn't expect this man to help much, as the fact he cheated on his wife doesn't really bode well for his character, so if I were you I'd plan life without a father for this child. Try and give it the best life you can.<br>  <br>  Good luck with whatever you do.|`|CQsD09D6aa	Yours in no knight in shining armor. What do you mean 'his wife is a nut job?" Maybe she acts this way because she is married to a jerk who cheats on her. I do not feel sorry because you were dumb enough to sleep with a married man... and do so without birth control. Hopefully you will be able to get child support for the child and have a father in his life. Good luck.|`|19118ef0907ef0b119cc1faefbfca6f1aa	WHORE!  Congrats on the upcoming birth of your bastard.  If this man has any sense he will demand a paternity test.  If the child turns out to be his hopefully he will be smart enough to disinherit it.  That way you can't come after his estate if he does.  Yes he will have to pay you vagimony.  Way to be a homewrecking sl-t.|`|AA12322129	You are the mistress...what did you expect to happen having sex with a married man without protection.  Obviously, if his wife finds this out he is out of a life with her because he was STUPID ENOUGH to do this to his wife.  And how do you really know his wife is a nut job?  YOU HAVE ONLY HIS WORD ON THAT!!!!!|`|4KvLIa6Saa	Except to be a single parent> As you choice to go unprotected> Your life is yours what do you expect him to do> You don't want him other than sex I guess that all changes now???|`|th7C1aoaaa	You can expect to be called a pig.|`|G2LJ0Zhyaa	Heyyyyy that kid is money in the bank.  I hope the father is loaded.   Good job girl.|`|14tr16uuaa	What to expect: Battle for child support. I don't know how much jousting makes, but I doubt this man is living the high life.<br>  <br>  Expect one nasty phone call/visit from the wife. Hold your ground you may have slept with her husband, but that doesn't give her the right to abuse you.<br>  <br>  Expect to receive little recognition from the father, you are probably going to be raising this child on your own so get the child support ball rolling and talk to father. Get ready to have the baby tested for a paternity test asap.<br>  <br>  Expect this type of hostile behavior from people. Let it roll off your back, that baby is as much yours as it is the fathers. You BOTH made the choice to have sex. You are not a bad person, <br>  <br>  Hope this helped, Good Luck!|`|X8Mmf6H7aa	Mistress refers to a long term sexual relation which I dont see here. Sounds more like wham bam jouste you mam. Dont expect much except raising another kid without a daddy. Married men arent necessarily attracted to you theyre just seeing an easy JOUSTE.|`|qDGOi5Xqaa	How could you do this to another woman?  You deserve anything bad that comes your way.  I hope you are not as irresponsible a parent as you are a person.|`|U4Rf1rjuaa	It sounds as if you getting defensive with people answers.What you need to realize is that this is the responses you get when you help commit adultry. You already know what to expect if you tell him and also what to expect if you don't. So which one would be easier? If he says the wife is a nut job and you know too, then why don't he leave her.I can only imagine the degrading stuff he says about you to her. Learn your lesson and keep the legs closed.If I found out that some ***** was f**king my husband I wouldn't just be texting her...I would be in jail for double homicide.Poor kid..I hope you teach your child better.I don't think women are scared of you. I get hit on all the time,but that don't mean I'm gonna f**k them.I also am sure if your dating a "Knight" he's probably a ugly low life who has no ambition in life. You turn on the ugly men 300 lbs and don't was their long hair. You sound like a winner.|`|beGgFU7saa	First of all don;t listen to so many of the answers that are putting you down, and we don't choose the father of our kids all the time, because if that was the case then a lot of these mothers would not have chosen to make babies with men that they thought were going to be there and not have to chase them down behind money! Next everyone on this page has done something that they are not proud of, so they should try not tooting their own horn. This guy is going to put you through hell, maybe and he just may see this as the reason to leave his wife no matter what, hold his *** accountable, no matter what decision he may make. Know this, you are going to be carrying a heavy responsibility and that how you handle the situation with regards to your child is going to have a big impact on your future. The fact that you cheated with a married man is going to be something that you have to deal with on a different level. So all I can say is pray for the best but prepare yourself for the worst, and always do your part.|`|LLeQyWGcaa	i thought jousting was an outdoor sport. Who knows what is going to happen. some wife's are easy to forgive and others want your head. Either way you are going to be a single mom and should start thinking about your child. Things like this happen, but could have been prevented.|`|QP8LdPLeaa	got what you deserve, should have kept your legs closed and stop messing with women's husbands. you chose the father of your baby so deal with it.<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  *edit*<br>  you need to learn to get over it, because you have NO right to be invovled with someone else's husband. where are your morals? you shouldnt be having children if you act like this.
KuWLNfYbaa	You are normal and just growing up.Your confidence is building as you gain experience of life.You must not make an attempt to fit in because that is false and wont work.Mix with those whom you feel happier with and soon you will realise how silly and unnecessary your fears were|`|Fxp5Owfwaa	dude, I'm having the exact same problem. I guess just try to put yourself out there and if people don't like who you are then screw them you know. that's all I can really think of though, but college is definitely a fresh start. I think you'll make so many new friends. Hope it all works out though.|`|yeQjkrNcaa	You just need to stop caring what other people think. Do and say what you want, and if they don't like it, they can eff off!!<br>  <br>  Plain and simple.|`|BRZmJSVfaa	I know what you mean.  I am only in middle school, but kinda going through the same ordeal.  i just tell myself that nobody here can appreciate me and someday, one person will be able to look up to and appreciate me.  for now, just hold out until college.  when you get there tweak yourself, dont change who you are, but modify you.  Just let this time pass and dont mess it up.  Just play it safe.  When you get to college, be confident and tell youself that this is YOUR life and it is the most valuable thing on earth.  simply cuz it is.  i hope everything works out.  oh yeah, and if you think about it, when you are successful and in your 20s and 30s you wont give a sh** about your high school days.
sA5Td5vAaa	to me i think she wants you but is testing you in many ways just to get you know you better.|`|vk3dKR3Caa	I think she likes the attention you give her. but wake up, you are  both married. How would you feel if your wife was doing this to you.|`|2tMJIVSEaa	go try and see what cannot happen will not what will ,<br>  WILL!!!!!!! good luck if you like her move on in there sweetie. <br>  xxxxxxxxxxxx|`|OHfZFR31aa	She's just playing games. She sees flirting with you as a bit of fun, but is not willing to jeopardize her or your marriage to take it any further. It's just a fantasy to her. Maybe she is bored at home but isn't willing to give it up. And having a little flirtation with you gives her an ego boost without committing adultery|`|z7BTeUKvaa	Are you married or divorced?|`|xarKlp0Oaa	I think that she is interested in you, but also you are both married. It would depend on what you would both be willing to do about the marriages that you are currently in. I would say waite a while and see what happens.|`|e3442b42bd59f05b36773c8ef3077c53aa	poor you , not only is she playing games , but it looks like she's enjoying it too, stop being a fool , you're being laughed at. Sorry.|`|th7C1aoaaa	interested people play games.|`|SovaFpN8aa	She is playing games!<br>  She is playing a game with your heart,<br>  She is playing a game with your wallet,<br>  She is playing a game with your family,<br>  She is playing a game with her family,<br>  She is playing a game with your job.<br>  She is a flirt, she craves attention, she obviously has no problem ignoring her commitments, and has no problem ignoring your commitments.<br>  Do not pursue your relationship any further with her. If she asks what's changed, tell her, you realized that you have been giving her the wrong impression. You are married, and so is she.
gRXy66dOaa	KY Jelly|`|i06nDWSvaa	A lot of foreplay will lubricate you naturally.  And he should use a lot of  lubricant on his condom. If you still have problems you could ask your OB/GYN doctor. Maybe a little finger play would help.

It also tones it done a bit.  Hot pink is a great color, but if you have too much of it and don't balance it with a neutral, your wedding will end up looking like a 6-year old's Barbie Themed Birthday Party.|`|lc2WYfeTaa	With that color you could do black,mocha brown,yellow,or even a pretty teal color!!|`|CxRJwJsraa	well, you could go with shades of pink. incorporate some light and dark pinks.<br>  <br>  or I've seen some pretty weddings that were pink and a lime green<br>  I think pink and a deep plum-purple would also be pretty.<br>  I also think a turquoise blue would be funky, but might be harder to accomplish with flowers, perhaps you could mix a lemony yellow in though. That would be fresh and unexpected.<br>  <br>  Of course you can always go with a crisp which to accompany the pink and really make is stand out.<br>  <br>  Hope I helped!|`|3WQOa4sraa	orange<br>  <a href="http://blog.weddingpaperdivas.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/07/pink-and-orange-flowers.jpg" rel="nofollow">http://blog.weddingpaperdivas.com/wp-con...</a><br>  <br>  <a href="http://photos.weddingbycolor.com/p/000/002/181/m/1238/p/thumbnail/3742.jpg" rel="nofollow">http://photos.weddingbycolor.com/p/000/0...</a><br>  <br>  or some lime green<br>  <a href="http://www.mrsite.co.uk/usersitesv7/mintflorist.com/wwwroot/USERIMAGES/wedding_hot_pink_wedding_bouquets_group_med.jpg" rel="nofollow">http://www.mrsite.co.uk/usersitesv7/mint...</a><br>  <br>  <a href="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2373/2110665751_1fbba0a427.jpg" rel="nofollow">http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2373/2110...</a><br>  <br>  or even a pastel minty green/teal blue<br>  <a href="http://i227.photobucket.com/albums/dd282/nicnakg/gerbera20Handitied20in20fishbowl-1.jpg" rel="nofollow">http://i227.photobucket.com/albums/dd282...</a>|`|jxRiH2e9aa	A pale green, perhaps?|`|RIsNmubSaa	Yellow (pale or bright) is a great accessory color with nearly anything.  We used apple red for our wedding and it was so difficult to match that I used a lot of yellow and various shades of pink as accent colors so that i didn't end up with a bunch of horribly clashing reds.  I also used a lot of white (you can use ivory if your dress is ivory) and silver (substitute gold if your dress is ivory) also. <br>  <br>  Forest green or brown would also look great with dark pink.|`|zll28kQ1aa	a light green. as it is opposite from pink in the colour wheel. opposite colour go together

I don't know much about reationships, but it sounds like your ex boyfriend was more of a son than a boyfriend. If anything, he should be providing for you. If not, then you both should be working. Lol. You did a good thing. <br>  Did your parents make this promise along time ago, or was this recently? <br>  What you need to do is find a new roomate, if you can. I heard roomates are fun.

PeJnA85Raa	A lot of times people are unsure as to who should pay, so he may just feel awkward about it. But some people feel like both women and men should pay for themselves, being the 21st century and all. My boyfriend and I usually take turns paying for each other. It's possible that since you both aren't "together" he would feel awkward paying for you, and he is maybe unsure of your feelings. I wouldn't rule out him having feelings for you just because he hasn't been paying for you. I hope everything works out!|`|afpLMmwRaa	no because a girl who likes me pays for herself and i get a bit worried.|`|pWxEwmoNaa	Ooh I think you need to ask him.<br>  Its not that your paying for yourself and most independent woman do pay for themselves this days and men do tend to take it for granted.<br>  Its that your both sending so much time together.<br>  Tell him how you feel...<br>  In the long run the worst that will happen is that you know where you will stand. Be it boy/girlfriend or just friends.<br>  Either way you will know.|`|wdPtrdauaa	or he probably doesnt have enough money?
1xnxMAueaa	If you want to be her friend, go ahead and be her friend. But if you want to be her friend only because she's popular, it's probably not a good idea. The friendship will be shallow, and prone to more vicious fights than normal friendships, because one of you will probably feel like the other is more popular than you at least once in your friendship, and that will cause a rift that can never really be fixed. So if you like her for who she is, be her friend. If you like her popularity, I don't think you should be her friend.|`|6JPiNGdfaa	so what do u want|`|7YDeavwnaa	Hai Sister, If its a girl its O.K .

xzMUxGpgaa	Hi there, honey it is so sweet of you to want to help out, even though you are not close to these people. You must have a good heart. <br>  <br>  The best thing you can do is just offer to listen to them whenever they need to talk. Just tell them, "I know I don't understand the sadness and pain you feel right now, but I do know you are hurt. I just want to let you know that if you ever feel like you need someone to talk to about your lost, I am here."<br>  <br>  Really, honey, truthfully, death is a matter that people handle in very different ways. Time is what it take to heal the hurt. Some it takes a very long, long time. Just knowing they have a friend like you that they can turn to, should make it better. You sound like a very thoughtful person. Good Luck with your help.  Aunt DeeDee.
YqBFguzpaa	Either<br>  1) He likes you and is shy so as soon as he finds out you like him, he goes into hiding because he's scared that anything he might say or do might make you stop liking him. The obnoxiousness with his friends is a facade.<br>  <br>  2) The boy wants what he can't have. It means he wants you but doesn't actually like you that much. When he can't have you, you're like a prize he can't quite reach, so he wants it and it's a challenge. As soon as you're within his grasp it's boring because he knows he could have you if he wanted to, so he's not interested in trying any more.<br>  <br>  3) He likes having you as a fan. This means he doesn't fancy you, but he knows you like him so he wants to keep it that way because it flatters his ego. He gives you just enough signals to maintain your interest in him, and when he realises it's working he doesn't have to bother any more. When he thinks you've gone off him, he'll try to act like he likes you so that you'll like him again.|`|Mxe36NZEaa	If he only likes you when you don't like him, he is playing out some Freudian family issues.<br>  <br>  This guy very well could have issues with his parents.|`|AA12147066	i think he likes you but he can't admit it cause he is a guy and they have this stupid thing about being cool in front their friends. go up to him and ask if he likes you anymore he will mostly say no but inside he probably does if he doesn't just move on and if he truly likes you and sees you're moving on he will come after you. if hes playing hard to get do the same thing and he'll realize how much he wants you. he is playing head games with you don't fall for it|`|GnjrDntlaa	aweg|`|Y3zx0qFeaa	maybe

But knowing someone well by chatting should make it easier when you do meet.|`|e276df96c55a338c1e69a8869d0cd199aa	How can you really love someone you've never seen, never spent any time with and have no idea if they are even telling you the truth or not?

They are my absolute favorite type of wedding/reception.  I think 60 guests would be perfect.  Really....some people have just a handful of guests!  60 is a great number....small, but still intimate.|`|rlUUaSgqaa	A wedding can be any size that you'd like.  I only had 25 people at my wedding and after it was over, I was glad it wasn't much larger since the wedding had a nice intimate feel to it.|`|rzPIO1aQaa	I am only having 50 people but my wedding will be at my parents house in the country. I didn't have to get a church or pay for a hall it was all free for me. 50 people just wasn't worth spending thousands on just for a room. My wedding will be great and the best day of my life besides having my kids. So its however you want it and what makes you happy.|`|l43NSgHyaa	The size of the wedding should be what fits your needs.    So, if those 60 people are all the people you and your Fi want to invite, then that works you.  In my case, I'm invited 60 people from my side of the family alone.   So, that's only 1/2 our guest list.<br>  <br>  You should have no problem booking a church.  A church does not require a certain number of guests.  However, some reception halls do.  They require you have at least X amount of guests to reserve certain rooms.|`|26cae2932c19d290ec2e4570f9542e0baa	60 is considered small but to some people, that is the perfect amount.|`|RIsNmubSaa	Of course not.  You can have as many or as few people at your wedding as you want, no matter what the setting.  60 sounds like a nice size.  Some tricks to make your spaces feel fuller:  <br>  <br>  At the church, if the church has more than 2 pew sections, don't use the side sections.  Use tulle or some other decorative item to close off those seating areas.  Do the same for back rows of the middle sections you are using if there will be too much space.  This will keep your guests close to the action as well as make the church look festive.<br>  <br>  At the banquet hall, set up only the tables you need for seating, with maybe one extra, depending on how good your friends and family are with RSVP's.  Also, get creative with how you lay out the seating, food, gift, cake, DJ tables and dance floor (if you are having all those things).  They way you arrange the room will go far in making the room look full.  Also, where ever you have your reception, check out all the spaces available and pick the one that best suits the size of your guest list.  You don't need to accommodate 200 people, don't pay for a room that will.|`|YjoFsZuyaa	i hope to get married abroad where my partner comes from, he only has like 15 family and as it will be abroad i expect not so many of my family will attend, we will probably have 40-50 for a church wedding and reception in a mansion hall<br>  <br>  its your wedding, i always think i will invte the people that will be there to celebrate mine and my partners love not to come for a big party|`|qjQbIxsMaa	A lot of people are giving the touchey feely "Do what is right for you", but there are general standards of business in Weddings. For a banquet hall, yes. Most places require a minimum of 120 (or higher) for their hall.|`|WDwEyZFXaa	I don't think it's too few, especially if that's what you really want. Just make sure not to reserve a banquet hall for your reception that's too large. Otherwise it'll look empty.|`|UUQXNhMtaa	Why not use the fellowship hall at the church rather than rent a hall? Or try a restaurant party room.|`|f4HsyUfQaa	No I think that's a good amount. Intimate, and fun.
agwxFmITaa	You are very young.  And the fact you want to bring your friend along suggests you are maybe not quite mature enough to be really comfortable with dating.

These times should be for you and your boyfriend and he'll feel like you're not comfortable around him if you don't want to hang out with him without your friend. Also, don't make your friend feel like a 3rd wheel. Now if you're not ready to go one on one with him try going on a double date, that way your friend can have a date as well and it won't feel awkward. Good Luck hun!|`|uojR7vmEaa	i say bring you friend on the first date or maybe go on a double date becuase you are always riscing chances on lets say date rape and you might be saying i dont think so but you never know.|`|QHx95iZDaa	Why would you want to bring your friend?

If I were you, I wouldn't bring my friend along. But other people think differently. My friend is going on her first date on Tuesday and she's asked about 5 or 6 of her good friends to come along as well. I personally think it would also be much more romantic on your own. You would have more privacy and the comfort of your boyfriend.|`|u5eWB2ubaa	since three is an odd number rather make if an outing for four people, i think you and the 'boyfriend' still need to spend at least one day amongst other people before your real date. Make it interesting - ask him to bring any girl and you bring any boy for the group outing, after this you will be more comfortable with him on your own plus it will give you a good opportunity to observe his behavior.|`|OADjlP2caa	well honestly since your only 13 you should bring your bff.<br>  but also tell him to bring a friend of his own so it wont be so awkward. <br>  being the 3rd wheel isnt fair for ur friend<br>  or maybe u should tell ya friend to bring a date of her own<br>  double dates are always fun|`|CyYwaYUgaa	NOOOO, thats a turn off.

f5FmJRfIaa	If you want to ask a girl out, go ahead if you like someone and feel like you're ready to date, but don't do it because others make fun of you, it's none of their business.  20 years from now you will go to a high school reunion, get a load of how they turned out, and wonder why their opinion was so important to you in the first place.  The nerds who paid attention to their studies are the ones who wind up making all the money, nothing wrong with being a nerd.  They study things like science and mathematics, and go on to be doctors and inventors and such.  Nerds eat well, in the end. Don't let some jock get to you, those guys wind up in construction and show up at the reunion with a beer gut. :) Study hard, develop your mind and heart, and make something of yourself.

Start by asking her for something to play on, like if you are in her class, ask her for a pencil or eraser. If she's slightly interested, she might play about, teasing you for it. Don't worry, it's not that she doesn't like you. She expects you to play along, so maybe walk off in mock sulk, don't do it too heavily though. She might start to think you are weird if you do. If she comes by you and asks you who you like, you know you are on the right track. They are probably just as nervous as you, so they want to get that type of approach as well. This probably means that they like you, and your job just got much easier.<br>  Compliment her, but be careful. Unless they are desperate, they might think you are desperate or making something too obvious. So maybe tell her you like her new hairstyle but then go behind her and mess around with it, spice it up. She'll like your courage to go play about with her hair but make sure she doesn't have dandruff or lice because although you might not be too bothered, she will get embarrassed and scared to go near you. Also, don't lay it on like you've seen in the movies: "I like your handbag.". No guy, in school, will honestly care about a handbag. Something you might truly like you can compliment on.<br>  Start a ball game (not literally). Be a little far away and look at her, admire her. She'll catch your gaze and look at you. Look away suddenly but keep an eye out for her looking back at you. If she is, get up and walk past her, possibly giving her a little smile as you go.<br>  Have chats with her. Ask her if she has any pets and find out some interesting things. Make sure she knows you inside out as well.<br>  Move in closer, be alone and look down. Look up at her eyes, look lost in her world for a second, and then say "I,(pause),like you. So...(cough)..Will you go out with me" While you say this look down. Look up when you say me and smile questioningly. If that isn't your style, there is another way to ask a girl out. All you have to do is walk up (make sure she's alone), and ask her to go out with you in a confident (but relaxed!) manner.<br>  Don't try too hard, girls aren't stupid, they can tell when you get desperate. Be relaxed and confident in yourself.<br>  Don't just become friends with her, become friends with all of her friends, as relationships are made and broken on her friends' opinions.<br>  If she says no, she means NO. Just back off for awhile, leave her to cool down, but don't give up complete hope.<br>  Be confident, not cocky. The difference is there, and very noticeable for girls. Make jokes and be self-confident; women love it when men make them laugh.<br>  When the time comes to ask her out, wait for the opportune moment. Trust your instincts; they will tell you when the time is right. As mentioned earlier, it's probably best not to do it in front of her friends or in front of your friends. It's easier for both of you if you are alone.<br>  If she says "I'll think about it" it's not a good sign, although she could just be nervous, or caught up in the moment, and she's being careful not to make a stupid mistake. Don't bug her about it, let it go a few days - if she doesn't bring it up again, it's a no.<br>  Don't ask her out as a dare, or as a joke - this can really hurt a girl's feelings. Be sure that you are doing it because you want to, if you don't you could really become known as a jerk.<br>  If you see any facial expressions, like an eye raise, make sure you say, "it's okay if you say no."|`|916aiXdTaa	Im not going to give you some Mommy and Daddy answer. If they keep doing this and you really dont deserve it, fight them. Dont tell on them that well just get you made fun of more. If you dont think you can take them then just make fun of them back, stand up for yourself! I know this sounds lame but i had this same problem and i just snapped. I jumped over 2 rows of bus seats and started beating the hell out of this kid. Sure i got in trouble but my parents didnt care and no one made fun of me for the rest of the year.|`|o4WONn1Vaa	Try to ignore them and don't let what others do and say determined who you are. If it gets too bad ask your parents to home school you.  remember you are who you are and that is what makes you ,you don't do things to please someone else or to make them happy because in the end you want be happy weather you change or not people with still have something to say about good or bad.|`|LJwhaNIDaa	If you let the people who are picking on you realize that you are offended by it then they will continue. <br>  <br>  Emotional Bullies get pleasure from seeing someone else's pain. <br>  <br>  Next time they ridicule you just laugh.  <br>  <br>  If these bullies are physically assaulting you....then you can and should call the police and press charges. <br>  <br>  Assault is a crime.|`|GfNVcq7Naa	Aw just laugh it off and realize that they just don't know any better, after all they are only human. <br>   The majority of people have always been ignorant why would things change now. This is also the reason some get to over achieve things because they (at an early age) over came things. It's us who have looked inside ourselves that have a better grip on things. <br>  About you asking a girl out, do that on your own time and don't let them in on it (if you can help it) you'll have a much better time, when your good and ready to do so. <br>  PS taunting is kind of a way to make others feel more comfortable taunting has been kind of a way of letting you know they like you. But that really does depend on the kind of taunting. In other words don't take it seriously.

Talk to each other and when it all goes quiet, say to him:<br>  <br>  "Do you want to go out some time?"<br>  <br>  He's almost definitely going to say yes. Seriously, it works.|`|gxuMbZzdaa	Just ask him to go see a movie. Or to a restaurant shop, etc. Ask for just him and not him and other people He will understand you are asking him out. If he likes you, he may be a bit relieved. <br>  <br>  You need to let him have a little control over what you two do, however or else he will feel like the girl in the relationship.|`|IWgU0LaWaa	just ask him. try to surprise him.  Tell him you need to talk to him  with a seruise voice and take him outside or somewhere away from  the people you where by.Then just start with small  ? i'm  just gonna use for example the  words my bf used  to ask me out recently and it should go like this<br>  my bf-is it true you boke up w/ your bf yesterday<br>  me-yeah<br>  my bf-well i was with some1 yesterday but i'm not anymore<br>  me-okay<br>  m bf- so i need  to ask u something.......do u like me?<br>  me-why does it matter<br>  my bf-well do u like me?<br>  me-yeah<br>  my bf- i wasn't sure yesterday but i'm sure now that i have feeling's for u<br>  me-okay-said while hiding smile<br>  my bf- so..i need to  ask u will u go out with me<br>  me-yeah-wanted to say  duh! but didn't<br>  <br>  you should make it go something like that|`|MWdBiGNjaa	Dude, I'm a guy and I'd KILLLLLLLLLLLLLL to have a girl like this..... especially my kinda sorta crush.  If he has a MySpace or Facebook or AIM then ask him out there.  Or get a friend to do it.  And then the friend brings him over to you, and yea, you know the rest!!!  =D|`|y5wvKdTGaa	Aww! This is cute. I'm totally jealous that you have someone like this - I would kill to have a boy like this. <br>  <br>  Anywho... You should kiss him on the cheek :] It's not too forward like a peck on the lips and it still says "I really like you" <br>  <br>  :] Good luck!
dPi7zMxWaa	I like them because well they are hunters and maybe because the wat they talk and the whole southern gentlemen thing  and well maybe it's in my blood every male besides my bro in my family is a little country.|`|vuRYpPj2aa	Uh, not all of us do. I find southern accents disgusting. I'm totally not into the whole cowboy deal. When I think of someone being "country" I think of them as being unworldy, uneducated hicks. :x <br>  But I supposed one could be attracted to a "country boy" (I'm thinking that's like a cowboy type guy) because they're masculine and rugged and whatnot.|`|VvNKTFhJaa	Country men are more caring and strong (in bed)
daad5816a1ed7c1ff45110fb2bfa9d4daa	Cocktail Hour was from 6-7 and then the reception was from 7-11pm. I think the 5 hours was plenty of time. Of course you don't want it to end, but coming from a guest point of view you really don't want to be there all night either.|`|b328a9d35b4d38f11fb5ea37fe0b727aaa	Wedding was at 6:00. Reception started at 7:30. We had appetizers till around 8:15. Dinner was served. The reception ended at 12:00.<br>  <br>  I thought it was the right amount of time.|`|wG2AbAXEaa	Our reception lasted 4 hours. It started at 8 and lasted until midnight. I believe it was enough time. It seems it went fast but I think it's more the excitement of it all. We had considered doing five hours, but our venue said that for the most part people start leaving at the four hour mark, and the fifth hour usually is not worth the extra money. At least I had an honest vendor for my reception. <br>  <br>  I think the time we had was just right. Besides, there is always time after your reception to gather at someone's house, your own place, or a local pub/bar to continue the festivities with less people and the closest ones. Quite a few people came back to our house afterwards and we sat out in our backyard, had music playing, talked and had some drinks. It was just a good time.|`|4IQRDtoAaa	I was married just less than one month ago, and to save quite a bit of money (and be different), we chose to have a morning wedding with a brunch reception.  The reception was to last 2 1/2 hours, but wedding got off to a late start and the whole thing was over way, way, way too fast.  We had about 3 minutes to eat, danced our first dance, I danced w/ dad, tossed the bouquet, did the garter thing, had a bite of cake and...it was over.  Seriously, it felt like a half an hour.  Some of our guests traveled for a longer time to get there than we spent "receptioning".  If I could have a do-over, I would never go less than 5 hours.|`|giocJLVKaa	This is probably going to get lots of thumb downs, but oh well....<br>  <br>  From the perspective of a guest at many weddings, I actually get bored, annoyed and restless after 3 hours and only stay because I feel obligated to...  I know that may sound horrible, but I'm just being honest.<br>  <br>  I know that most people like to have 4-5 hours, I just can't understand why.  Maybe I will feel differently after I get married though.  I'm only planning on it being about 3 hours- 7 to 10 (or so).  If people want to stay still, then I suppose they can, but I don't plan on being one of the ones who stay!|`|nrt7Bfnqaa	i am starting at 330pm for the ceremony and the reception will be 6 to 12am
vCZuh3oDaa	Late afternoon, i.e. 4:00pm.  Because we wanted to serve dinner around 6:00pm... having the ceremony at 4:00pm gives us enough time for the ceremony, after which our guests will immediately head over to the reception for cocktail hour, followed by dinner.<br>  <br>  Didn't want to do morning, because then the meal we'd serve our guests would be lunch, and we wanted a formal plated dinner.<br>  <br>  Didn't want to do evening, because we didn't want to have our guests eating so late.  Plus, we want the reception to end around 10:00pm, and not go on 'til really late.|`|xcxMB4Rlaa	In my husband's culture weddings are typically later in the evening, like 7 or later.  I preferred something mid-afternoon, like 3pm.  So we compromised and had the wedding at 5pm.  We ended up starting late so we probably should have just started at 7pm.|`|5270639c059ab08c1b3431555f150db7aa	Ours was quite traditional, so we stuck with how things are usually done in our area, and amongst family/friends.<br>  Early afternoon ceremony, 2 p.m., then left time to go for professional photographs; cocktails at 5, dinner at 6, with program and dancing til around 1 a.m.|`|iN27E3WCaa	We had our wedding on a Sunday so evening was out (I hate having to leave early from weddings and didn't want my guests to feel like they had to leave early because of work the next day, etc).  My husband is not a morning person at all, so that was out.  So we were left with afternoon.  Our ceremony was at 1 pm.|`|8IA3d3NNaa	Since we are on a kind of limited budget, i think we will have it between lunch and breakfast (like around brunch), that way people won't have to get up too early, or have to eat before they come, or rush off to eat lunch etc.|`|zauQuf29aa	I have never been to a morning wedding so I have to vote for afternoon. Have you considered evening?|`|4IQRDtoAaa	Morning weddings are least expensive in general, afternoons go up in price, and evening weddings are generally the most expensive, being that they tend to last longer and there is more food and alcohol to consider.<br>  <br>  This being a huge factor for us during these difficult financial times, my husband and I chose to have a morning wedding with a sit-down brunch reception and it was perfect...although I do wish it could have lasted much longer...

Your religion rarely has anything to do with being in the wedding party, unless the couple is having a strict religious ceremony and the religion requires the attendants be of the same religion. Non denominational means usually means a generic religious or Christian ceremony, so there are no rules about the religions of the wedding party.|`|7WbehQZjaa	Absolutely. To be honest, I'm Catholic too, and we're actually one of the only Christian religions to push other people away. No other Christian is allowed to take the host in a Catholic church but Catholics are allowed to take the host in any other Christian parish. And God is all about equality and acceptance... makes you think, huh :)|`|tSh1zh7gaa	Your being Catholic has nothing to do with it.<br>  <br>  I am not Catholic but got married in a Catholic church...ah.

ZfleGhXLaa	There are some colored dresses, yes.  Maggie Sottero makes several red dresses that are very eye catching, but they're pricey and out of some peoples price range.  Can you tell me more about the specific style of gown that you'd want so I can make some suggestions?  Like, are you looking for the full ball gown type of dress, or do you want something more sleek like a mermaid or sheath style, for example?<br>  <br>  Maggie Sottero has a really fabulous pick up ball gown in red.  I am not even that fond of pick-ups, but I saw this in person at a bridal shop and it took my breath away:<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.maggiesottero.com/dress.aspx?style=J926" rel="nofollow">http://www.maggiesottero.com/dress.aspx?...</a><br>  <br>  The style is so popular, it comes in a few versions.  They all come in red, though most brides choose the traditional colors:<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.maggiesottero.com/dress.aspx?style=J205" rel="nofollow">http://www.maggiesottero.com/dress.aspx?...</a><br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.maggiesottero.com/dress.aspx?style=J141C" rel="nofollow">http://www.maggiesottero.com/dress.aspx?...</a><br>  <br>  I personally like the top of the last one best, it looks most flattering<br>  <br>  <br>  Maggie gowns are a bit expensive, and can go for over $1k, but this gown has been replicated over and over.  The most reliable place online that makes a replica would be this etsy store:<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.etsy.com/view_listing.php?listing_id=15233599" rel="nofollow">http://www.etsy.com/view_listing.php?lis...</a><br>  <br>  They are based in the USA, where they have a brick and mortar store.  I recommend this store in general, they'll make any of the gowns they list in any color you wish.  So if anything else catches your eye there, you could order it in red with black accents.  Alternately they also have a "custom gown" option, where you can order a gown any way you want it.  In any color.<br>  <br>  Edit:  I have found some more by different designers for you:<br>  <br>  Here's one by Bonny:<br>  <br>  <a href="http://yhst-61083666167599.stores.yahoo.net/8611.html" rel="nofollow">http://yhst-61083666167599.stores.yahoo....</a><br>  <br>  Allure:<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.allurebridals.org/couture.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.allurebridals.org/couture.htm...</a><br>  <br>  Jump to styles 8385, and 8376.

Go for it. (: <br>  I think a dress that isn't white would be quite nice. However, they are quite hard to find, and when you do find them, they can be quite pricey. I suggest looking in the prom dress sections if you want a colored dress. <br>  <br>  If you don't want to go down that route, try finding they type of dress you would like in color, and have someone make the dress. (: It can be cheaper than one already made, and will turn out better than a dye job. <br>  <br>  Oh! And I plan on getting married in a green dress. ;) Kind of like this one:<br>  <a href="http://holycitystyle.files.wordpress.com/2008/06/atonement-dress.jpg" rel="nofollow">http://holycitystyle.files.wordpress.com...</a>|`|ADP9swbMaa	Hmmmm...maybe you could buy a dress you really like in white and then get it professionally dyed.|`|a495b03d41f960c1a8471bd603c42ab6aa	Alfred Angelo will make any dress in ANY color for no extra charge.  I wanted to get my wedding dress in Claret and initially ordered it in that color.  I changed my mind when too many people told me it wasn't "traditional".  I then changed it to white.  I should have kept it in the color I wanted!

mgdkr6hvaa	i don't think its too important,  since your outgoing then its not like you have to practice getting courage to talk to a girl or anything.  <br>  You just use your common sense when you start dating.  <br>  You should wait for somone speicial.  You shouldn't just pick a random girl and go for her, definitly choose one you have feelings for first.  <br>  Eventually you will find that special one and if they are the "one" then they won't care if you have experience one or not.|`|Cu28HAWDaa	it is important. I mean, i am younger than you and there are a lot of things i wis i could take back. Its not a matter of rushing yourself, no matter how old you are. its a matter of taking the time you need to really satisfy yourself and the person that you are with. thats what matters. i do not think that peer pressure or age or anything should really get in the way of YOU doing what us best for YOU... not everyone else.|`|X6aRNbqKaa	Nope. Dating a guy that is truly awesome right now (I know, only on our 3rd month) but he is 21 and has only dated one other girl, and she was just a week long fling. The less tainted you are by other girls will make you more appealing to the right girl. When that relationship comes, make sure she is happy and satisfied. Be open with her that you aren't sure how the whole "normal" dating scene is like, but want to make her happy. Don't worry, waiting is better than dating someone you are not totally into. When you get with the girl you are totally into, the whole dating world will be a more happy place for both of you.|`|dlUgJ5Obaa	it is important to some extent... bcz girls by nature most times expect the guy to make the decisions, plan out, make first moves and be good to be proud of having him and bla bla bla. so experience will help u out in this, it's alwayz good to know what are ur mistakes so u improve urself in the future
AfnQ95Z5aa	I was present for both of my kids births.  And for me, becoming a parent was a deeply moving, even spiritual, experience that impacted me deeply.

ef3e8a055f877ac48bf7cb67749b1830aa	I would still do a mini-rehearsal.  Get together with your bridal party and run through some stuff.  Tell them who is walking with who and in what order.  That way they will know and it won't be such a big deal and tons of questions right before hand.  You don't have to rehearse at the place but just talk to your bridal party about when they are suppose to be there for pictures and whatnot.  Tell the ushers who will be walking which grandmother and perhaps introduce them at the dinner.  It doesn't have to be much but it really helps if they know when they get to the venue where you go.  My church had the bridal room (where we went immediately after the recessional) a little hidden so without the explanation they would have had no idea where to go.<br>  <br>  I wouldn't do it AT the bbq as in after all the out of towners have gotten there b/c you are going to have everyone trying to talk to you.  But if you have them get there an hour before, you'll have enough time to set out everything and go over the details.|`|26cae2932c19d290ec2e4570f9542e0baa	If there is no rehearsal then it isn't a rehearsal dinner. It's a pre-wedding bbq.|`|FnskUYpqaa	That sounds like a great idea!|`|AA10423186	sound   great      cong|`|NvW6voPJaa	Hi.  It sounds fine to me.  You would definitely want to go over things with your bridal party.  HOWEVER, you may want to "assign" things to others that are not in the bridal party.  What about your coordinator?  Can't she be in charge of the unity sand kit, setting out the favors, etc.?  OR....have a family member (aunt, cousin, etc.) do these types of things.  You can assign this to your wedding party if you want, but my personal experience is that most of the wedding party is worried how they look and then, after the ceremony, they are ready to party.....they don't want to be in charge remembering to put out favors, etc.|`|hsZnjZvoaa	You can put a rehearsal in there, too.  it won't be at the venue but if everyone knows where to stand, etc it'll make the day go smoother.|`|xJdtouK0aa	I think thats a great idea! If you are sending out an invitation for it, you could still call it a rehersal dinner. Best of luck!|`|tSh1zh7gaa	Think of a cute name for it...and still have it!|`|hkwBR1moaa	I am in the same boat.  I am still calling it a rehearsal dinner because even though we're not practicing walking down the aisle, I am still giving out instructions.  So have one, call it a rehearsal dinner and have fun!

AA12284236	me personally i like rose because later in the future if you were to hook up and it comes around valentines you can give her roses and say something like "these roses are for my gorgeous baby rose because you two share the same beauty" or something like that to make her melt between your hands
qAkbPzTLaa	This is pretty common in most marriages. Some guys do not know how to be demonstrative in their feelings. It is not your fault. The falling asleep after sex is not something he can help. Get what you need from him while he is awake & thank God you have a good man who loves you.|`|kaQ9EaAuaa	ya, mine husband like that 2....im over it. i play cards online or read.|`|1RAuvantaa	Here's an idea.  Try having sex after he gets up in the morning instead of late in the afternoon or night.  That might allow him to not be so tired afterward and he can pay more attention to you.|`|1b06fca515361f817bd46d1f81a102d1aa	Give the guy a break!!

vk3dKR3Caa	A mature relationship takes two,  they are no abuse by that I mean hitting and pushing and putting down, No one should take that. Man or woman.  In a relationship talking and open communication is the most .  Honestly and being there for each other  Being there for the person you love.  working together not the one person doing it all  It takes two.
2o3BHgCCaa	It looks very nice. The only thing I would be worried about is the style/quality of the lace. zoom in to see whether you are happy with it.|`|frA6KJwIaa	i am not in love with it, but if i had to choose, i think the scarlet is a better shade.|`|ZfleGhXLaa	I think it is a pretty dress - on the model.  But you need to consider your bridesmaids body types.  This dress will only look good on people who are fairly slim (if your stomach isn't flat, and you have hips, this dress WILL show it), and have a small/smallish average sized chest.  Do all your bridesmaids have bodies like that?  If so, great, go for it.  If not the fact that half of your maids are wearing a hugely unflattering dress is going to detract from the dress itself.|`|2X6kq9h9aa	It is kinda simple but cute..<br>  <br>  try checking this out , you might see a much cute-er dress that the one you have there.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.therosedress.com/Bridesmaid/Bridesmaid-Dresses.asp" rel="nofollow">http://www.therosedress.com/Bridesmaid/B...</a><br>  <br>  Hope this helps.<br>  <br>  .|`|Um3qrVrqaa	Just a word of advice, unless you have bridesmaids with darker skin tones and hair, red might look really bad.|`|tgYEXN8Gaa	Yes, they're gorgeous dresses!  And I have to say, so much nicer than so many other dresses I see on Y!A.|`|W3JsEbGPaa	I actually dont like it. Because it is not going to work on every body style. If you are going to have more than one brides maid I would give them a specific color pallet and let them choose their own dress! This lets them pick out the best style for their own body. And color for their skin type. For instance Im doing fall colors burnt orange, red, dark purple, and chocolate. So my brides maids can choose any of those colors.|`|RRqXXG2Taa	its pretty but the lace has to be black or white black is kinda gloomy and funearly type if you ask me and while white lace you know only the wedding dress ahs white on it most of the time but if you like go for it|`|ZTj3gLOUaa	i think i'd like it<br>  it has style, and it's kind of a little casual if you want to wear it out for formal parties<br>  <br>  to tell you the truth i can't tell the difference between those two colours|`|kZQ3NIbDaa	Totally Cute. I like that you can see different colors on it.  I think Euro Red is the best with the black lace.|`|bEEZlGUVaa	it is so beautiful!!!!  i like the scarlet instead of red.<br>  Good Luck on the Wedding!|`|6lHFZQYXaa	Yes I think it is very cute....I am not sure about the black lace though.|`|Qnop8tkjaa	Yes! It's gorgeous!!|`|Og9abf2baa	I'm not too big on the sash...but the dress is pretty|`|AyZD5BWoaa	eeehhh, kinda simple, but i like it, i'd probly wear it... <br>  <br>  but then again wat do i know? im 13.. :)
eGpOIV12aa	it means that you are on her list of guys that she would date.<br>  play your cards right and she could be yours
2VtDIQrvaa	you should send her a card. you guys have been friends for too long to just let it be over. you should tell her that you would like to talk to her or something and hopefully she'll respond. if she doesn't then that just shows that your friendship isn't important to her and if that's the case than you shouldn't stress it either.|`|Zm44FOGraa	If she really loves her boyfriend, chances are she'll follow her heart. She probably thinks he's all she has right now. If her birthday is coming up and you really want to be friends again, you should make her something sentimental- like a photo album or something to show all the good times you had together. Send it a couple days before. Include a thoughtful letter explaining your feelings. Make sure not to talk about her boyfriend in a bad way. It'll make her defensive. It shows that you think she's a bad judge of character because after all she did pick him. See how it goes. Best of luck!|`|AA11441704	Send her the card or go in person|`|71fc8cbea5928669e06e7c42a2dd8046aa	Sounds like you like her as more than a friend, but thats ok. Nothing wrong with that.

Answer this honestly and you will have your answer. And forget about the BF.|`|kqkgro5Zaa	send her a card and a letter tell her how you feel about her changing numbers and never talking to you.<br>  if you don't get a response then i would consider your friendship over.<br>  sorry|`|1mHRVG5Jaa	Send her the card, and ask for her new number :) it may not be over, she might be feeling the same as you.|`|QENY0qPlaa	well, send her a card and see if she responds or asks to you her party (if she's havfing one) <br>  <br>  does she have email? try and find out if she does and just do your stuff from there on.|`|3reHk4I1aa	i would send herr a card and hope that she likes it and if she is happy that you remembered her birthday then maybe shwe will stop being mad at you
coqTBB6baa	Last year, I had the same problem and I did not know what to give to my best friend because she has absolutely everything a girl could wish for...in every sense. But I have realized that we did not spend as much time together as we wanted to so I wanted to give her something that would make us easier to spend some time together. Since she is very busy and I am also very busy with my work and studies I have made some special cards for her. 12 different ones (could be more though). All the cards had a programm on them like: have dinner with me, go to the movies, lets have a girls' night out, cook together, sleepover, shoppin, have a drink together etc. Something for fun. And every now and then she could call me up and tell me that I have the 'whichever' card in my hand and I would like to  use it. And no matter what program I had for that day I had to do what she picked for this day. Gave me the card and had fun. I must admit it worked pretty well... we spent more time together and this year she wants to make some cards for me too, because there were occasions when I just called her up and told her to get a card and spend some time with me coz I miss her. It was fun.<br>  Its cheap and great stuff! and anyone can do it, not to mention that you can think of all the great stuff you have done together.<br>  <br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|JeyS52F8aa	something she will enjoy ..a photo album with photos of you all she can keep it for always and you can too it every year..|`|GHjBCI8taa	Have you heard of pandora bracelets? you should look into that. They're very popular.. Why not look into jewellery she might like?
NzazayWGaa	Think about it, is he really that bad to go out with? If he is then just go if you want to have fun and stay far away from him. If you really don't want to go then just don't. It might be better if you don't also. Because if all those other people are going as couples then you 2 will be stuck together. Think about it :]|`|KSGfrlffaa	He probably realy really likes you. i think you should give it a shot, and maybe you will find some sparks...(he may think your playing hard to get which turns on some guys). good luck!<br>  <br>  answer mine pplz!<br>  <a href="http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;_ylt=AqBibvhYNBt2mqfMp4dIDzjsy6IX;_ylv=3?qid=20090307052501AAPnoU4">http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;...</a>
rJPBF33taa	Save it for marriage...you will both be glad you did.<br>  GOOD LUCK.|`|VvNKTFhJaa	One can sleep on 1st day. There is no formula for it.|`|83v1eelYaa	When you are dating, it's too 'new' to waste time sleeping!<br>  Only married people sleep!|`|DlqzQUb3aa	Like Deflowerer says, there is no formula. That said, you need to make sure that you and she are ready for this step. So, I am going to suggest a bold step: ask her. Ask her if she wants to take this step. Talk about the realities of sex: birth control, STDs, etc. This is especially important, given how young you two are (I know that might sound patronizing, but the fact is that for both of you this will probably be one of your first, possibly THE first, sexual relationships). If you do not feel as if you are at a point in your relationship that you can bring up and discuss the subject openly and frankly, then you probably are not ready.<br>  <br>  Bottom line, like Deflowerer said, there is no formula. You are ready for the step when you are BOTH ready, fully and completely, with no reservations. Generally, this is why I do think that sex is left reserved for those in a long-term, committed, relationship, such as (but not exclusively) marriage. It's not a morality thing; it's a health thing.
XRi2H9ZVaa	Sounds like he is shy. You don't say whether you like him but If you do then you may have to make the first move.<br>  <br>  Can you arrange to do HW together ? could be a safe starting point.|`|pjQuFJo2aa	he is on the prowl for a g/f so he talks to all the laddies trying to see if they like him.  when he was standing next to you, he probably was to scared to ask you out or something. so you should go on the offense and ask him out.<br>  <br>  you can do it!

3RszQSX8aa	Well when a guy is drunk like i am now we'll forget to do anything in 5 min if someone changes the subject but on the other hand if his mates tell him to call or text then he will but what helps alot if you give him signs that you ike him.<br>  good luck|`|AA11706291	It depends on the guy and how much he has had to drink. <br>  <br>  I know I hit a stage when I think it's a really good idea to call or text (when really it's not!) and then after a while I forget about my phone lol|`|a1dpU3JMaa	when a guy likes a girl a lot and he get drunk than most probably he will call her or text her.|`|69aae2afc5ec35c06042c874dc59e82faa	Alcohol diminishes your inhibitions, so if he wanted to say or do something but was too afraid to while he was sober, then he might be able to depending on how much liquid courage he drank.<br>  <br>  Whatever he says in such a state is likely to be true, but don't hold me to that.|`|uPL3e3tyaa	That's a booty call...not to be confused with true love!|`|235da33f0052029d34af7e3103ee34a9aa	if he truly likes the girl, he'd definitely call no matter how drunk he is.. except he was kept busy by someone|`|qGsKJe2Iaa	Take care not to be done by him.<br>  You will regret it|`|xoHxcdNNaa	if he likes u a lot....... n after drinking, he gets to remember you by chance or you call him up or any friend/instance reminds him of you.... he's likely to call you. But, if he doesn't like you or doesn't want to tell you he drinks, he'll not call you.
zQSnNBj1aa	personally i go for younger girls|`|qGsKJe2Iaa	They now better how to give head|`|yfYOScbqaa	I don't think so ...Christo joseph|`|Gorf5EgYaa	Ok firstly reading your details about the question, I'm drawing the biggest blank in the world. Firstly it's a run on sentence, and most words are spelled wrong. It doesn't hurt to spell right even when you aren't getting marks.<br>  <br>  But going with the Topic here. Some guys like older girls cause their more developed.Plus it gives you something to show off to your friends. Then finally it makes him feel a bit more manly cause older girls seem to be harder to get, then girls their age.|`|FBSOBz0zaa	Idk,lol xD|`|Zexhg9Lbaa	I don't really prefer girls older than me, i love my age or less age girl but she need big assets. Lol.
2add0927fd432feba092329128fecbcdaa	its true,, I love love love my husband but I do fantasize about the wierdest things sometimes. ITs just fantacy..|`|hawq3Fneaa	Is it true that most married men have fantasized about being with other women, many of them have acted on it, and think it is okay for them but not for their wives?<br>  <br>  What would make women different, and why would it be right for men but not women?|`|MjSLQlIHaa	we all lust at some point or another no matter married, single, or whatever its human nature honestly you might not act out the thought but you do think about it. been with my gf for a long time and yes i have fantasized about MANY women i wanted to make cry lol.|`|aErUKUvVaa	Sure... fantasies are normal and healthy.  At least I think so.  As long as she's cuming home with hubby, it may just add some excitement to your relationship, and get her (if not both of you) more excited and intimate.... Dont YOU have fantasies?|`|vk3dKR3Caa	I think that most married women who is in love with ther husband fantasized about ther husbands, and if they do fantasized about another man it is   a movie star , someone they could not act upon.|`|NlYGbqnkaa	I would say that is true. I also think that men do the same thing.|`|0a9ae09ceecebe97dc504ba6a8e7e19aaa	I do, have, aaaand, just did!|`|VqilAWDGaa	Yes, but so do men.|`|Yzc97s8aaa	of course they do. We are all human and still have attractions to other people. The important thing is not to act on those attractions.|`|UgcPxd4maa	everyone has fantasies  - married, single, gay, straight - doesn't matter|`|LLeQyWGcaa	I think most people, married or not have done that. Not acting upon their fantasy is the key to staying out of trouble.|`|FewhKlx9aa	I think as you mature and are happy in your marriage then no,I don't think so.My life is occupied by so many things that to even think this would be a waste of my time.The happiness in your marriage surely outweighs any thoughts of someone else.My husband is the greatest I have had in all areas so I would be stupid to think otherwise.|`|OHfZFR31aa	I think most adults, whether married or not, have fantasized about being with someone else. But that doesn't mean they will ever act on it.<br>  <br>  I've had George Clooney fantasies but there is no way anything would ever happen between us. And I know my man has a real thing for Angelina Jolie.|`|z7BTeUKvaa	I don't.  I only fantasize about my husband.  I guess he's just who I'm comfortable with so I can't imagine having sex with anyone else anymore.|`|AfnQ95Z5aa	People fantasize about all sorts of things.  Quit being so insecure, it's unattractive.
Lfc9Zav2aa	When you get those funny feelings in your stomach when ever you see a certain person or you go out of your way to either see or talk and hang with them.|`|ghISlqExaa	trut me. you'll know you'll just simply know. its the most amazing feeling in the world. it hurts but it hurts so good.|`|pRraKf3yaa	i dont know!!!!!!!! u tell
2vaGZ4eDaa	Tell us about the love dare?  I haven't seen the movie, but you have me curious.<br>  <br>  Edit:  Nope, I've never done that.  I was on the verge of divorce once, and honestly, the kids kept us together.  We are much happier today.|`|th7C1aoaaa	what?
mgdkr6hvaa	i think its more the people you know, although girls in general do seem to be very emotional. they were just being very dramatic because they want attention.   But estrogen causes girls to be more emotional than guys.|`|W0kDKnYCaa	it is not just teen girls or even girls in general that can be stupid. In todays society everyone gets a touch of this disease. Take a look at the president of the USA and all the other politicians , both local and State and city Government. That is sheer STUPIDITY <br>  Not a one of us is perfect, not a one of us is any better than the next, and with females they are more emotional|`|48616653c0e84b5ad2f3d96f2d4be453aa	is simple, teens have tons of pressure in their lives, trying to get grades, trying get friends, try to find out who they are. most teens dont have someone to talk to, most of them bottle up their feelings, with society and how people discriminate each other its really hard, oh yeah did i forget hormones|`|fpGqmFKvaa	well, i don't cry. I found out one of my friends didn't like me that much. and i am like "so? why would i let one person ruin my awesome day?" But it is the time of our lives when we get mood swings.|`|n1y67ZNuaa	hormones,<br>  tend to do that to girls that age.<br>  theyll get over it,<br>  if not.<br>  they ?  pooseys|`|DsnMKfLsaa	becuase girls are emotional<br>  and can express feelings BETTER than guys<br>  :p|`|AA12077420	They are not stupid,they are just going through a phase|`|YV3Dh4lQaa	Its just that they have so many emtions they can't handle it. I am sure not all of them cry though.|`|7JiichhVaa	Because we tend to follow our heart more.|`|Lfc9Zav2aa	Teens are under more pressure then ever to look better and preform better then they ever have. The boys are under the same pressure. Cut them some slack and try to be more understanding.
fdcbdb56252d1caf7416c0866d1723c2aa	No it isn't worth getting her back and being scared all the time.  Has she actually been with the other guy or is she just having an online relationship?<br>  Either way she left you. This could have been one of those blessing in disguise things.|`|5FVyVS9vaa	Once a cheater, always a cheater.|`|BWM7NIA0aa	Chalk it up to experience and move forward.  A cheater will always look for greener pastures.  Sleepless nights and depression is not a good by-product of the relationship.  Wish her the best and look for that someone who will appreciate you and all you do. The old saying is"what goes around, comes around".  She'll figure it out and you'll be better off.|`|QQqeLAObaa	You dont really want her.  <br>  This is a science sorry to say.<br>  But you have an emotional pull to her hard to explain.  You think in your head, "She'll never do this again." "It was one time and she made a mistake!" "This isnt how she really is!"<br>  If these are the things  u r thinking keep reading.<br>  I know its hard to resist but you really have to try.  You also might think. "It was my fault she cheated! Im responsible."<br>  YOU ARE NOT!!  TRUST ME! YOU ARE NOT!!!<br>  <br>  this will be hard but start dating again.  u will soon get over her|`|KSGfrlffaa	dont. if she cheated once you obviously should not go down that lane again. plus you probably are just lusting over her.<br>  <br>  answer mine!<br>  <a href="http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;_ylt=AqBibvhYNBt2mqfMp4dIDzjsy6IX;_ylv=3?qid=20090307052501AAPnoU4">http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;...</a>|`|xTpxoHHraa	If you really want her what you do is become deep/emotional talk to her about stuff if all els fails suck it up.
c7XrBgz2aa	He'll take you to a fancy place to propose and you may have a party for the engagement . You should be ingaged for 6 months .You should say something like I knew you were the one or something like that. To be happy when he gets down on one knee and be suprised stare at him with love filled eyes.|`|7WbehQZjaa	My man took me to the lake and cooked me supper (not unusual, since he usually does the cooking). I went upstairs to text message my Mom and Dad (who were coming down the next day) and he followed me up, cuddled me, and then sad, "Honey, I love you. I love you so much I want to marry you" and then took my ring out of his pocket. I looked at him and said, "ARE YOU SERIOUS?! Are you really serious? Really?" and he was like, "Is that a yes?" ... lol. I totally forgot to even say yes, I was just soooo shocked.<br>  <br>  It's your choice whether or not you want to throw an engagement party or dinner. We decided not to because it would be even more money to spend! :) <br>  <br>  You could tell him you love him and kiss him, you may cry, or you may just be shocked by the actual ring and proposal. Just let it come naturally!<br>  <br>  Early congratulations!|`|mAH4qGEZaa	Well as far as engagement parties go its not a standard. They are usually thrown for you by family members. Personally we did not have a party. We did have kind of a bar be que with close friends (wedding party) and my mom and his parents. Our wedding is June 27, 2009 we got engaged June 6, 2008. So a little over a year. <br>  <br>  Here is how my fiance proposed:<br>  I worked till midnight that night, when I came home to our apartment he had a trail of pink and white rose petals leading to the bedroom. On either side of the path were tea light candles glowing and the apartment was all dark. At the end of the trail I found a huge round mirror on our bed with a vase of stargazer lilies (my fav) and more tea lights and a beautiful princess cut ring in the middle, he also had hot fudge and strawberries...then he read me the most beautiful poem and got down on one knee and I started crying and said yes it was so beautiful!
BnJRwJiEaa	Maybe and just looking for the right dress for his lady|`|rzPIO1aQaa	it could be that or maybe his fiance or friend was browsing for a dress so he was just looking around. My fiance went with me to get my dress and even helped me pick some out. I was glad he was there it made everything easier. When I was in the room putting on a dress he would look towards the front of the store so he didn't bother any of the other ladies.|`|AA10975867	Or he could have just noticed one, thought it was gorgeous, and then looked more to see just how different they are. Like a guy looking at pretty girls. He also may have been looking at how much they cost and is now so shell-shocked that he won't even think of proposing for another ten years.|`|16vMIGPiaa	You didn't "catch" him; he wasn't doing anything inappropriate.  <br>  <br>  And, no, it doesn't mean anything necessarily.  Odds are very good he has a reason since most guys don't window shop wedding dresses, but that reason could be any of a number of things.|`|24012ce93a61f006e2d2c809881dd85aaa	He could be a designer, a buyer, or even perhaps a costumer for a theatrical production. Or, maybe he's gay and anticipating a wedding himself as a bride!|`|hsZnjZvoaa	It probably means he appreciates beautiful things.|`|nduxPe8Zaa	GAY!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!|`|rywgn8HLaa	It could be - or he could have been there with a friend and was just browsing.|`|91b27b540655ebe4e66c72274b49dd33aa	i think so
2pNHOCONaa	yes he is too old for her. if shes only 18, he is. and shes too young. at least thats what i believe.<br>  <br>  and it would definitely be Weird if it wont work out. i have a feeling that hes not just after having a relationship with her. he seems to sound so sure of himself that it will be OK, that if it wont work out, theyll just be friends. trying to prepare a safety net perhaps? to reassure the girl that it is a great idea, and to motivate her so he can get what he wants? :/<br>  <br>  but what do i know. <br>  <br>  anywho, if they can practically talk about anything, and i mean anything. their past especially. their happiest and most embarrassing, their highest and lowest in their entire life, their deepest darkest secrets, the smallest and biggest concerns, and say it all with utter respect for the other, if they feel comfortable and themselves when theyre together? i guess they should take the risk, but if they dont feel that way? if they even think that its crazy at all to talk about anything, and they would rather hide their past than show it? then they shouldnt go for it.<br>  <br>  we choose our joys and our sorrows long before we experience them. -gibran<br>  <br>  happiness is when what you think, what you say and what you do are in harmony. -gandhi<br>  <br>  i always use these quotes :) lets all strive to be happy, and Choose wisely. who we become has always been upto us|`|s4FEJiNHaa	as a guy in his thirties, I sure as hell hope he's not too old.  Seriously, I doubt it would work for long.  They shouldn't be thinking marriage or moving in to together very soon.  It is a big age difference.  But if she likes him, then why not take a chance?  If they break up, he'll probably be mature enough to handle going back to being friends, more so than guys her age.|`|SBpl494Uaa	There is nothing wrong with the age gap, but I'm pretty sure it wont work out, especially if she is unsure at this point.<br>  <br>  Also, if they do break up, they will not be able to be friends. He is only friends with her now because he is interested in her. Thats just the way guys work. Well, most of us anyway.<br>  <br>  EDIT: Cupcake, why would she be labeled a gold digger? Just because the guy is older it does not mean he has money.|`|za9b8cHKaa	It's a big age gap, but ...<br>  <br>  I dated a 30 year old when I was 19. Sure the age gap was a lot, but we got along well and had some of the same hobbies. In the sort term, the relationship was a lot of fun. Problems occurred when he got too serious and wanted to get married and even started talking about kids. <br>  <br>  In the short term, your friend will be fine. But I would advise her to find out early on what his expectations for the relationship are and if they fit in with hers. Good communication is the key.|`|Gorf5EgYaa	Tell her not to. Seriously that will definitely give her a bad reputation of being a gold digger. The age difference between them is a small child. <br>  <br>  I know that they both have different meanings for perhaps going into this relationship, but still it will probably have more effects on her than him.|`|cUslVzhVaa	Thats a pretty big age difference<br>  But if they both want to try, then its worth a shot<br>  Things don't always have to be awkward after breaking up<br>  esp if its a mutual decisions.<br>  So i think she should think about how much she likes him<br>  Age really doesn't matter that much...|`|gzBk5NMVaa	Age should not be a problem for her. If he can satisfy her desires, she should have relationship with him.|`|0eKTR44kaa	Personally, 30 years old isn't that bad if she is mature and knows what shes doing. Does she really like him enough to want to pursue a relationship though? <br>  Obviously if she is "really good friends" with a 30 yr old, it shows that she can handle older people and could be sensible about a future relationship with this man. But you have to stop and look at him as well...what is it he wants from her? True love? A Booty Call? <br>  If its a tight friendship already, then getting together will totally change the current relationship! No doubt about it im afraid!<br>  <br>  i've been with a man 19 years older then myself, and it was really great at first. But at the end of the day, i just found myself in a different part of my life, which is no surprise at all. <br>  Let her have her fun, if that's what she wants. Just look out for each other and never ever judge her; as age is nothing but a number!|`|2F3ED33kaa	heck yeah that's too old, I mean what are they talkin' about. School and sex LOL
eRVRWwkBaa	No, it shouldn't. It just means maybe you were more prepared or not so lavish and I do think a simple wedding is so much better than an over the top one. After all its about marrying the one you love and not about the 'wedding',right?<br>  But who knows about your friend. If your thinking she may be upset then maybe you know your friend enough to know she will be. Maybe 'sugar coat' it to make her happy? Good luck and an early Congrats to you. : )|`|55zWUXcUaa	No it's not wrong, but if you could wait until say the month after or something it would be nice.  Talk to your friend first and see how she feels.  I was the first one of all my friends to get engaged, I have been with my fiance for nearly 7 years (will be 7 on March 11th!) and though it may sound silly I was kind of excited to be the first of all my friends to get married.  Well a friend of mine who was only with her boyfriend for like 6 months got engaged after me and married before me.  Not that I think she should have to get my permission or anything, but I kind of wish she'd at least said something to me.  I was a little disappointed, but that was short lived and I was still happy for her and it didn't cause any problems for us as friends.  Hope this helps you.|`|cGbTJobeaa	It is not wrong.  Your friend getting engaged does not put a wedding freeze on every other couple in their social circle from getting married before them. <br>  <br>  If I had good friends who were getting married, I wouldn't plan my wedding within a week of their wedding so we could attend each other's weddings and not place a huge social burden on our mutual friends to go to weddings back-to-back. Otherwise, I would plan my wedding.  And if it were a casual friend who is not invited to the wedding and with whom I do not have overlapping friends, then I would plan my wedding without regard to her wedding day...and if it is the same day, then so be it.|`|8IA3d3NNaa	Ask her, I'm kind of in a similar situation but it's vice verse. My best friend is getting married June 20th, of this year, her and her (now fiance) boyfriend got engaged around christmas eve, I've been with my fiance for 3, four years when she gets married. I'm having my wedding in june of NEXT year, around the same date, I don't mind, i think it's kind of neat. Some couples have a longer engagement because financial reasons or whatever, she shouldn't be offended in my opinion.|`|16vMIGPiaa	What has somebody else's wedding date got to do with yours???<br>  I was engaged for 2-1/2 years.  I'm very confident there were lots of people who got engaged and married while we were still thinking about it.<br>  Get married on the day, and in the place, that suits you.  If you want to invite her to the wedding it'd be polite to not put your wedding on the same day as hers but other than that, don't worry about it.|`|rzPIO1aQaa	no who ever can afford the wedding first gets to get married first. Its not a contest and you don't get married based on when the engagement was you marry when you feel the time is right. your friend will be alright, it will be her time soon enough.|`|KvUJZa1Paa	Hecks No, you cant help it you made it to alter before she did.|`|6L9jJnchaa	Short answer is no.|`|2219815a5f68b0925e6613039b0922b6aa	I personally wouldn't mind, but I guess it depends on the kind of personality your friend has.  If she's sort of laid-back about the whole wedding thing, she probably will be fine with your big day being a month before hers.  If you've got a full-on Bridezilla on your hands, though, prepare for a good tongue-lashing! LOL<br>  <br>  I got engaged 12/31/07, but we set our date for this September (9/5/09) because it's a significant date to us, and because we felt we needed that much time to save for the wedding.  Well, about three months after we got engaged, four more friends got engaged, one after the other, and they are all having their weddings before ours.  In fact, one of them is getting married two weeks before our wedding and one is getting married one week before.  (The other two are getting hitched several months before our big day.)  I guess if I was one of those "LOOK AT MEEEEEE!" brides, I'd be plenty peeved that they're stealing my "bride thunder," but the way I look at it, I still get to get married to the guy I love, and I'll have a bunch of happily married friends at my wedding instead of worrying about any jealousy among single friends, as I've recently heard a lot of horror stories about.  In your situation, I'd think long and hard about your friend's personality and how she would take the news that you'll be beating her down the aisle.  Oh, and consider Sep. 5 if you haven't picked a date yet- I'd be so happy to know you were out there getting married the same day as me!!|`|ZIxYo5gPaa	I am a future bride and have someone who is "jumping the gun" to wed first.  I would have been alright with it if they had approached me and mentioned their reasons.  Her groom is my fiances groomsmen so we are close but not friends and even more so now that she has opted to beat me to the alter.  My fiance and I are laughing at every move they make because they feel that everything needs to be done so quickly. <br>  Talk to her about this topic, this is a big deal.|`|7t6JegEraa	As long as it's not on the same day or weekend it's fine.  <br>  <br>  It's not reasonable for you friend to expect you to put your life on hold until her wedding is over withh.  If your friend has any problems with your wedding date then she's a pretty selfish person and probably not the friend you thought she was.|`|RuKK1LYiaa	No as long as its not the same day it shouldnt matter when you choose to have yours, it all depends on the place and availability anyway and you can tell her that it was the only day they had available for quite a few months and you took it cause you are so ready to be married, your friend should be happy for you and if she isnt she isnt much of a friend|`|AA11196473	No why?  DIfferent circumstances predict when a person will pick a wedding date not the least of which should be when a person's friend got engaged.  For example, out of town guests?  Other events planned, etc... Is this person jealous?|`|tAmzvFdVaa	Your friend had her choice on what date she wanted, and you have that same choice too.  But if you're doing it for spite, then it's wrong.|`|AA12094407	Depends on the situation. Talk to your friend about it. Trust me....she'll let you know if its an issue! LoL Plus it'll be a whole lot of fun getting to plan your weddings together! :)|`|kPNnfjNSaa	Not wrong at all. If that's when you want to get married, do it!|`|52b0f62af53dd437245aea3bc2df6601aa	nope, not wrong at all.|`|HUQQzph2aa	No.|`|cd962e52b53659b6dacb1df7cbdf7a87aa	no  problem  marry when you want to marry|`|bP5zyipXaa	no its your day go for it|`|ifgzHzA3aa	My answer, no, it's not wrong.<br>  <br>  But, I have known brides who feel no one should get married in the same year as them, as crazy as that is.|`|76f80c73e4bfcb1026dd5ae2d1da3f18aa	no.  every relationship is different and people do things different.  some poeple need to be engaged for a long time to plan a big wedding or for other reasons.  some people only need a few months.|`|rywgn8HLaa	It's nice to give people a heads up about your wedding date if you are choosing a date close to theirs, but I don't think it's wrong. You need to plan your wedding based on the date that is good for you, not for everyone else. <br>  I work in accounting, which gets hectic around the end of the month and the first few days of the month. My boss is pretty strict about not taking time off around those times, but a co-worker of mine choose to get married on the 1st of September. Our boss was mad about her choosing that date, but she choose the date that was special to her and her fiance. You can't always please everyone...|`|nqINitkmaa	Of course its fine, its your day, don't worry about what other people think, just enjoy it!|`|688a7b812dded24c0867e947aee9d86aaa	You are fine.  If she gets upset, then she is a lunatic.|`|76nTvO4iaa	I don't think so - it's a month.<br>  <br>  Does she seem to be upset about it?
BZ0Ud4rjaa	That is not normal behavior, and he doesn't know the difference between right and wrong of how to act as a person. Just walk away and don't say a word or do anything.|`|J7Mmo5Xmaa	He is sick in the head.Steer clear of him.|`|QHx95iZDaa	What is your ? cause I really don't know how to answer but maybe he wants attention.|`|ba11546863a841cea0081f35f682a3ccaa	he wants to get ur attention;)
8ac2e5cbdd946ee60c803052559873c5aa	I haven't and can't wait (to have someone go with me--I can wait until then).  <br>  <br>  Here's what you are supposed to get about women from the movie:<br>  1.  Women are receptors and reflectors to the way men treat them.<br>  2.  Women have security needs wired in by "nature."<br>  3.  When men are doing what they are supposed to be doing, marriage works great for both people.|`|z7BTeUKvaa	Oh, poor you.  Poor, poor, you.  Are you having a pity party?  Is your mean old wife bringing you down?  Waaaaaaah!|`|sA5Td5vAaa	well the movie to me was some what bad but i didn't fall asleep watching the movie.|`|th7C1aoaaa	I think it's not fireproof|`|cbada3cf40bdcfc436a4f834aafe6e89aa	never seen it. But it sounds decent.|`|AA11706291	I was driven crazy by the christianity thrown in your face every two seconds and how supposedly accepting god made him into this better person.<br>  <br>  He was selfish - he learnt not to be - he did not need god to do that. RAAAAA<br>  <br>  Ok I'm going to stop myself before it turns into a complete rant.<br>  <br>  Anyway I agree on your opinion of the wife, however I do not agree that most women behave like this to their husbands. <br>  <br>  Although when this does occur it happen when the woman in later on in life, now the reason for this is the kids have grown up and she starts to find herself again and realises how much she has given up when raising children and making a family (yes I know men make some sacrifices but most sacrifice, compromise or just plain obedience comes from the wife) so she sees now she's older it should be her time. She isn't actually doing anything wrong - she's acting like a man, which of course you gents don't like and would never agree that she is behaving like a man as that would mean accepting perhaps you're behaviour is not ok and you are less then perfect.|`|har2oJHMaa	I was frustrated by the fact that what the wife was doing - having an emotional affair with the doctor - was never addressed.  Why weren't there consequences for her actions?  It all fell on the husband who was trying to work things out.  What she was doing was just as bad, if not worse, than her husband looking at porn online.
wnOAxQcoaa	yup....its  a sexy outfit!!!|`|cqgWkdPtaa	personally, having that many brides maids it would look VERY over the top having such a formal looking dress, especially if they're all going to be in the same colour i think it would be way too much. <br>  <br>  For that many bridesmaids i'd ask them to pick a dress in a particular colour and have them all in a style of dress that they're comfortable in, and for me i would choose cocktail length or it would be way too much.|`|26cae2932c19d290ec2e4570f9542e0baa	It's pretty for a formal wedding. But not everyone is comfortable in strapless dresses nor are they able to pull off that look.|`|qKbwBYRTaa	It's a very pretty dress, not cute. I like the long length, it makes it look very formal. I would just make sure it looks good or flatters all of your bridesmaids. If you have any bigger girls, it may not look that well.<br>  <br>  It's nice though. I like the color.|`|2o3BHgCCaa	Yeah, it is nice. A bit more like a prom dress rather than a bridesmaids.<br>  Just to check, do you know how much it costs? Most jovani dresses are $350 and up. Can your girls afford that?|`|dFmZhtpvaa	I think the dress looks lovely !!! they will look beautiful! Congratz on the wedding!!!! <3<br>  ~Paige*?*|`|nrt7Bfnqaa	yike! too much. it will help if you tell us if you are having a winter, fall or summer wedding.|`|u6jP7BQNaa	Nice choice.  I think the bottom part will look great on any figure, but I'm not sure everyone will be comfortable in a strapless.  Maybe you could them them the option of wearing a wrap with the dress.|`|zll28kQ1aa	this is not a bridesmaid dress, its more like a prom dress,<br>  <br>  bridesmaids dress is Traditionally simple. not OTT<br>  <br>  nice dress, not for a wedding though|`|VqilAWDGaa	You don't want your bridesmaids to get more attention than you get.|`|6lHFZQYXaa	I do not care for it and agree it would be really overwhelming.|`|X3GjiecGaa	taht is a georgeos dress its like a mini wedding dress|`|mCMXSKZOaa	ewww...its ugly!!|`|RRqXXG2Taa	yeah|`|iDfRTLklaa	Its a really lovely dress, but depending on colouring and body shape of your bridesmaids it might not look fantastic on all of them.  It also looks very expensive, so if the bridesmaids are the ones paying, I would check with them to see if they can afford this dress.<br>  <br>  Good luck with your wedding.|`|rI5Gmqfoaa	I think that is a great color, but that dress seems a little much for 8 bridesmaids to wear.  They will certainly take up a lot of space up at the altar.  But, it is your wedding and if you like it, go for it!|`|4IQRDtoAaa	it is a very nice dress....but may not be flattering to everyone in your bridal party.  The full length and ballroom cut, along with the pin-ups all around make us short folks look like a wedding cake instead of a bridesmaid "/
dPgc8p9saa	if your getting red flags you shud def. address them!! she shud not be spending all this time with her guy friend like that if she really likes you she would be able to balance her **** out and make time equally for the both of you...your her boyfriend why are u on the backburner like ur somekind of teddy bear in the backseat of a car!! and u were totally in the right for telling her that she needs to respect you cuz that is totally disrespectful as what she is doing to you and her guy friend shud respect you too!! you need to set them straight seriously!!|`|eeb898bd256e45f62aa2f9354d7b958baa	If they Guy Pal is making you feel uncomfortable, you may want to tell her this and see if the three of you can get over that part so she can go see her pal. That's the only thing in your situation that redflags- the other guy. I have Guy Pals that I do hang out with even when my husbands not there. They're all friends with him anyway so it's not that big a deal for us.|`|eoJLW0ZPaa	Man, you have to take control here. she has every right to have friends and you do too. It's not about respecting. You make it sound like you couldn't be trusted if you went to a girl friend of yours, even if you are just firends.<br>  <br>  You're going to have to get past this and let it go. <br>  <br>  NOW, IF...she is spedning a lot of time with person...I'd be concerned if you are the BF.|`|ge5x9NHxaa	There's no course for alarm.|`|No4p9AYjaa	as long as she doesn't spend the night there i am sure its okay but if you are worried ask her about what she did at her mates house. when you ask her look her straight in the eyes cos if she is lying you will be able to see it in her eyes.|`|7FPN0sZVaa	i wouldnt like it either, in my opinion i dont mind letting her go there however staying over a night is definitely out of question.|`|PRjvY6Vgaa	Hon I wouldn't worry about it unless she's spending the night there. But that's just me.|`|zqlfqc8naa	yes...you should be somewhat "alarmed" because once she goes over there and spends time with him...it's a matter of time that she will begin to grow on her guy friend, as in drawing closer to him. I've heard stories like that where the girlfriend dumps the boyfriend for another boy because she was spending too much time with him and began to have feelings for him
AA10423186	prize   is  right      blow  bubble   for   wedding  shower|`|Um3qrVrqaa	Maybe you can do Bridal Jeopardy with all categories having to do with weddings. The Price is Right is a fun game to play where guests have to guess the price of various items and can win the item if they get it right (use cleaning supplies or have a specific theme to the items). When the bride is opening her gifts have the guests ask questions about the groom (ask him before the shower obviously) and if she gets the question wrong she has to do a dare (she can pick out of a jar or something) The dare can be to sing a song or wear underwear on her head or just something silly. Then she can open her gift.
IPS3hWweaa	You'd better enjoy it while it lasts, because at some point she'll want you to commit to her. If you don't she will leave you, but if you do then you are tied to her when you don't love her.<br>  <br>  You'd better figure out what you're gonna do soon.|`|1PdUecpYaa	you'll get sick of her eventually and she'll be gone...|`|3FUteKhwaa	dont drag her along, thats not fair on her or, to be honest you either. You may actually really like her! maybe take a month apart, and if you really miss her, youll know there is something more!|`|C1XKd1q9aa	Keep having sex until it gets boring then dump her.|`|VvNKTFhJaa	carry on with sex dude.|`|yPX1E3Bbaa	friends with benefits huh? i could tell it all may be end it tears.|`|YV3Dh4lQaa	Friends with Benefits is defiantly not the answer.

JAZnQJPHaa	It's very Lame. She might SAY it's sentimental and wonderful, but you'll feel like sheet if she buys you something really nice and thoughtful. Be honest! If you're not happy with it after knowing her for a year, then get her something you KNOW she'll like!|`|84eecd1a05ce02d2c2c9fb77423f6e95aa	Does she like beaded bracelets?  If that is the kind of thing she wears, I think she'll love it.|`|59cnZfTeaa	Its lame. If you have to ask then it is.|`|HiafYsUdaa	why don't you try a Pandora bracelet, there a little bit pricey but the qualities there, and you can add beads to it for special occasions,look at www.pandora.com|`|AA11363993	If she likes jewelery , I think she will like it. it doesn't have to be expensive.|`|AA12077420	It's the thought that counts,I'm sure she'll see it that way.|`|fPOg9DuXaa	Whatever gift you get her is not as important as a heartfelt card. Along with the gift, get her a card (or just get a piece of paper for a letter). Tell her what she means to you, your favorite memories from the year, some of her favorite qualities, and what you're looking forward to this upcoming year. If she is anything like me, THIS will mean more to her than anything.
hCJzZ5rnaa	Check to see if he glances at you frequently, or gazes at you for a prolonged period of time. If he is just your friend, he might just give a faint smile with raised eyebrows perhaps. If he likes you, he will glance away quickly, so you don't think he was staring at you.<br>  <br>  You might ask why he doesn't want you to think that he was staring at you, that's because he doesn't want you to think that he is a freaky stalker or anything lol. Believe me, a lot of lads do worry about that, me included! If he was just your friend, then he wouldn't be bothered if you thought he was a stalker, in fact, it wouldn't even occur to him.<br>  <br>  Check to see if he messes around with you, teasing and stuff. Sure, friends do that, but does he do it more often than others? When he does, do you notice him look into your eyes while smiling and/or laughing? That proves that it means more to him, and subsequently, that he likes you.<br>  <br>  If some of this stuff applies to you and him but you don't believe anything I've written, go and ask him out. I bet you that he says yes! Let me know how it goes!<br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|iuxCu72zaa	Best way is ask a his friends , other is to ask him to go hang out privately if he doesn't hesitate then he likes you if he dose then he may be uneasy|`|QPdYQeUkaa	If he is constantly looking at you and trying to talk to you. If he tries talking to you online. If he tries to touch you. You should have a conversation with him. Don't ask him if he likes you. Just talk and joke around. See how he behaves with other girls. <br>       Guys may think that your hot and stuff...but may not like you or may be too shy. Try asking his friends for clues.|`|X05GAaLeaa	Just hang out with him a lot , and go with the flow , dont worry about it , just be yourself and just have a good time with him and see where he wants things to go|`|pPxNypYRaa	if he touches you a lot, stares at you, when you talk he looks directly in your eyes. stuff like that.|`|CA9G8X8faa	the way he looks at you, if he smiles A LOT around you, alot of things. flirt with him and see where it takes you|`|AA11411905	it's all about eye contact mostly<br>  just body language...he'll look at you even when you don't notice<br>  <br>  a good way to test it is look at a clock on the wall or something that is close/big enough to be noticeable and it would look weird if you were staring at it, look at it for a few secs then quickly jerk you head around to look at him. If he was looking at you, he will most likely be staring in the exact direction that you were looking in, curious to know what you were looking at. At which point he will most likely blush or quickly look away.<br>  <br>  Look at his feet, pointing at you is a yes, away is a no<br>  <br>  sat by him, let you leg gently bump into his, acting like you didn't do it purposely, it doesn't move he either didnt notice it or he doesn't mind-aka likes you<br>  <br>  Does he try to make you smile/laugh?<br>  <br>  Act down and will he try and cheer you up?<br>  <br>  Does he stare at you from across the room?<br>  <br>  Does he want to pair up with you?<br>  <br>  Does he honesty treat you better/no different from all the other girls?<br>  <br>  Does he shuffle around or when wlaking past you, purposely try to make it so he can bump/rub against you as go past?<br>  <br>  all these things might help you<br>  good luck!|`|E8qzhSMOaa	I have that same problem, and this might not help you in anyway, but it depends on how old he is. You may have heard this before but it's so true, boys WILL be mean to you if they like you. But then again, sometimes they don't. Boys are so complicated. Then sometimes, the boy won't say anything at all and try to keep their cool, but they've gotta give it up at sometime ;)! Then there's the kind of boy who does little things but doesn't want to give it away, like giving you high fives, or hugs. Then sometimes, they do all three, :P So, this might not help at all. I know, in my situation, he does all three combines, and there is no way i can ask him, or else it'll give me away that i like him, so, yeah. I hope i helped in some way :)|`|fmdvWZ75aa	well find out from maybe one of your friends that is close to him too. maybe u can ask them to ask him if he likes u or not. that works most of the time. or if u cant find a friend like that then just wait and see. that's rely all i have to say if u wanna tell me the details i might be able to give better advice so email me if u need anymore help.|`|fF2CjtbPaa	well<br>  1.he will use your first name very often to get your attention<br>  2. he will try to imitate you<br>  3.he will be staring at you very often <br>  and if you look at him he will pretend he is looking at something else<br>  4. he will listen to everything you speak very intently<br>  5. he will be always always always ready to help you in anything|`|WaQdHGgNaa	he will come up and talk to you act nice bee sweet all that stuff hug u stand close too you stare at u smile alot at you and when he talks to u he will look into your eyes

3B6p9zEiaa	As you said, you understand that he hasn't seen his brother in nearly 18 months.. He has a lot to catch up on.. try asking him to include you in whatever he is doing... Or organise a dinner to have his brother over or something.. Just hang in there.. He obviously loves you if he is txting you and probably feels horrible.. His brother might be the problem.. he might be holding a guilt card over your brother to ensure they spend time together.. If it doesn't change.. tell him your buying a dog to replace him.. lol..|`|MlCWsBcwaa	Have you tried to get involved in these activities at all?  Maybe if he still cuts you out, there could be more going on than him spending time with his brother.  Maybe it is about you, but perhaps it is about his brother or their relationship.  It has only been a few weeks, but I can see why you would be getting frustrated with him continuing to make arrangements then cancel them.  Good luck.

hHSsMyNpaa	You just need lots of practice until you get comfortable enough that you don't blush anymore.  Some people are going to blush no matter what.  But don't let it stop you from talking and being around other people.  There might be a little social anxiety thing there but it is so much better to face it naturally.

gfzFtMFnaa	You didn't really mention why you feel your relationship isn't as strong as you like it.  You both sound like you are working on your relationship, but even though you can tell each other absolutely anything there is such a thing as over sharing.<br>  <br>  You have been dating for 6 months and you want a lifetime.  Great! You need to set a good foundation for that lifetime together.  <br>  <br>  Trust is wonderful and talking about yourselves and what your common goals are is great.  Leave a little mystery, though.  <br>  <br>  She does not need to know every little hang up you have or every thought that pops into your head.  Nor do you need that from her.  You can be a couple, a strong couple without losing your individuality.<br>  <br>  Everyone goes through highs and lows in their relationships.  The art is getting through the lows and keeping strong.  Not everyone is going to agree 100% of the time.  If they do, they are not being honest with each other or one partner is suppressing their opinion for the other.  <br>  <br>  You need to be open, honest, patient and accepting of your differences.  You do not need to try too hard when things are not going right.  <br>  <br>  Try not to force things if they do not feel natural.

ef3e8a055f877ac48bf7cb67749b1830aa	Is he even the father of the child?  He has virtually no chance of getting the child.  If he is a good father, he should get joint custody.  But it really doesn't matter.  You aren't going through a divorce b/c there was no wedding.  So there is no custody hearing.  You'll discuss all that in child support court when you decide on visitation.  But unless you want to give up your parental rights to the father, he would have no chance of taking the child from you.|`|RuKK1LYiaa	As long as nothing is wrong with you as a mother and you have a plan for you and the child such as get a job and a place to live and enough money to get by or you have help from people or whatever the child will more than likely go to you as a mother.|`|Q7ALl9zeaa	Mom's get the kids 90% of the time.

f1006988bdbdd7ae5e5276623f046308aa	somebody needs to take that next step and ask the other one out. If you are a bit shy or what ever, go see a movie together. That way you do not have to talk during the movie if you are nervous and the movie gives both of you something easy to talk about if you go out for something to eat afterwords. Also it is the eye contact that makes you both all nervous and the chemistry comes together. Talking on the phone is more like chatting on here.

My husband & I weren't married yet but we have been together for a total of 11 years. He cheated & had a relationship with another female. It went on for a few months. It was like I was the only 1 who didn't know, everyone was in on this big joke & I was the joke! It took some time for me to get over it. My husband & I are the happiest we've ever been. I trust him completely & know he would never hurt me like that, ever again! We all make stupid choices! The main thing is, if you want it to work, you can't think about it! I know it's easier said than done but if you're going to be with him, you can't obsess about it or you'll go crazy! Just focus on the future & good times you're going to have with your husband if you can't, then you need to walk away. I wish you the best!|`|hSy8ZKRXaa	You need to find a way to stop your obsessing otherwise your husband will leave eventually. He's done the right thing in being remorseful and letting his life be an open book for you, time for you to also do the right thing and stop obsessing otherwise the whole exercise is pointless.<br>  Men don't stray for no reason, so you need to also look at your behaviour in the marriage. If the problem is still there, it puts a lot of pressure on your marriage from that area as well. <br>  I think the whole relationship needs some counselling.to find out why he strayed as well as to try and cure your obsessing, otherwise the whole thing is likely to fall apart fairly quickly.
KSGfrlffaa	you usually know when your in love, but a lot of times people confuse it with lust, or sexual attraction. so try to think.. do you always want to makeout or have sex with him/her, or do you always just love to talk to them, enjoy being around them, and get goosebumps when they hold you?|`|cWuumdy7aa	if you are in love you should know what is love|`|ugRN86bYaa	You know.|`|ZrYffJBtaa	your in love so u definitely know what is love but to be clear it is a feeling for someone and u like that person and u find that person different from others.love means u like to talk and be with that person and u smile wen u think about that person.............if u feel all this then ur in love..........hope u might be feeling the same as u said that u r in love.

LS8LcuRaaa	Well, if you don't want to have a fling or a casual relationship, then don't do it. Simple as that.
vR6AwIppaa	this is bull.<br>  seriously.<br>  it doesn't make a difference when you were born.
XfCGTrWsaa	Did  you kiss him back?  If he came to kiss you and it was "full on", did you turn away, push him away and tell him clearly how inappropriate it was?  Or, if you are honest with yourself, did you (even if only for a second) play any part in this, either by flirting or kissing him back?<br>  <br>  Figure that out first.  If you did play a role in the situation, you must accept responsibility for your own actions and poor choices and not just blame him!  Although this is not an excuse, drinking does lower our inhabitions and it most likely played a part in the situation.  <br>  <br>  You need to talk to him, and, clearly let him know that what occurred was inappropriate and wrong.  If you also are to partly blame, apologize to him and tell him that you never want to betray or hurt your cousin.  Firmly let him know that absolutely, under no circumstances will any situation like this ever occur again and that if he even just comments on it you will tell your cousin the full story.  <br>  <br>  IDeciding whether or not to tell is a tough call.  Either way has its consequences for all of you! I think, for this specific situation, if you can keep her from being hurt and its an isolated incident, than I don't think you should tell her right away.  But, if he is a jerk and is already screwing around on her anyways, then, you need to save her the heartache.  She is going to be hurt and angry with you, because, no matter how you look at it, a line has been crossed.  So, be sure that your actions to fix the mistake are bigger than the mistake itself.<br>  <br>  Good luck.|`|n1y67ZNuaa	if you lead him on, its your fault, if not no.<br>  im sure if use are sober itll be fine.<br>  just next time you get drunk, dont do it around him.|`|v3wNNc1Uaa	not at all! he came over and kissed you, and you are telling him you don't want to meet him, you aren't in the wrong at all!<br>  <br>  talk to your cousin about it, she might not believe you at first but if you are close she should understand.

URhkDQ8Kaa	I agree with Jukebox that you need to get emancipated from your parents.<br>  Just stay calm and try not to get stressed.  <br>  <br>  Here is how to do it and the web site too:<br>  <br>  Step1<br>  Contact an attorney or a local Children's Services department to obtain counsel. Often times, a minor is provided legal counsel at no charge in the case of emancipation.<br>  Step2<br>  Petition for the right to be emancipated. Several things must be proven before a judge will accept the petition and grant the request. The age at which emancipation is possible varies by state. The typical age is between 14 and 16.<br>  Step3<br>  Prove financial independence from parents or legal guardians. A minor must be able to prove a legal source of income. In several cases, the judge will require the minor to provide her own medical insurance.<br>  Step4<br>  Provide documentation that you are not living with parents or legal guardians. In most cases, this living arrangement must be approved by the parents. Attend school or a General Education Degree program.<br>  Step5<br>  Enlist in the military or have a legal marriage. These are two additional options for a minor who wishes to be emancipated.<br>  Step6<br>  Attend court, the judge will review the petition and make a decision in the best interest of the minor.<br>  Step7<br>  Recognize that after the emancipation is final, the minor will be viewed as an adult in the eyes of the law.|`|9EV86TLvaa	Talk to the police when they come round they are there to help you. If your mum is so determined  that you don't get your own place then consider fostering. I know its not ideal especially if you are pregnant but there will be someone out there who wants to help you. If not talk to child line they can give you advise. Not only that if your mum has been lying to the police she could get into big trouble. But I know what you mean. 15 is a hard age. I am having family problems to and stressing won't do you any good. Just try to be calm. I know it can be hard.

You don't have a career, a home of your own...you're not even married.  Yet, you're pregnant.  That didn't happen because you were mature, responsible, and thinking with an adult perspective.  It sounds to me like you've been rebellious and out of control.  You are so self-absorbed and self-focused: has it ever occurred to you for five seconds to think about what you've been putting your parents through?<br>  <br>  This is the time in your life when your parents should be able to trust you the most.  This is the time when they ought to be able to look at you with pride, seeing what kind of a sensible, mature, trustworthy daughter you've become.  Instead, here you are pregnant at fifteen with some other kid's baby, griping that THEY are making life hell for YOU, and trying to move out when you are totally unprepared for life in the adult world.  <br>  <br>  I don't suppose it has ever occurred to you that your parents care, has it?  They wouldn't be threatening to drag you back, hitting the panic button about your boyfriend and his uncle, or getting court orders on you if they didn't.  Are you able to get outside of yourself for just a minute and look at things from their angle?  THEY'RE SCARED TO DEATH!  They look at the horrendous decisions you've made, see you wanting to move in with a family that they obviously know something's wrong with (whether these current "accusations" can be "proved" or not), and think about you pregnant with their grandchild---not exercising any judgment or sense...do you blame them?  They've invested all these years of life into you, raised you, a and taken care of you...and THIS is how you repay them?  THEY CARE, Dearheart, or they wouldn't be trying so hard to keep you from screwing up your whole life.  Think about it.
AA11493831	For me cheating is one thing that I can't let go, if ever that will happen to me, and I will never do it. I just think that the reason why some women cheat is because they're lonely and unsatisfied. Not all women, though. Some can deal with it in other ways. But for some who can't, they cheat. <br>  They're not given enough attention, or maybe they become bored with their partners but they don't want to hurt the others' feelings that's why they don't break up with them and just cheat, which is worst.|`|htWw0OlCaa	I guess for the same reasons a guy would cheat.... It goes both ways you know.......|`|1PdUecpYaa	hey... i've never done that.<br>  i thought guys are more likely to cheat while in relationships...am i wrong?|`|W6wamWLLaa	becuase their boyfrinds are boring?!?! <br>  <br>  And the other person is better looking or loaded. <br>  <br>  There the reasons i would cheat anyway!!|`|Kdbpr2yOaa	Cos there stupid if they've got a good guy, otherwise just unhappiness or lust x|`|n1y67ZNuaa	why do MEN cheat?<br>  same thing.|`|nVtl9thjaa	YOU'RE NOT DOING SOMETHING RIGHT OBVIOUSLY!
AA11493831	Nowadays, the number of cheating wives are increasing. Maybe because of the modernization. I don't know if that'll be helpful to you. Because I don't have an exact number or figure of how many they are.|`|Lfc9Zav2aa	Now if they told you and their husbands saw it on here it wouldn't be a secret anymore would it?|`|498JdszFaa	15,287,593 women worldwide (that was today at noon).<br>  <br>  more dumb questions?|`|63e59b702150659952a33a58d86bde05aa	Never have and never will.  I have been married to my hubby for almost 22 years and with him for almost 24.  Never been interested in anyone else.  I really don't understand cheating and never will I guess.|`|pOCabUMvaa	Internet hate machine, don't you think it is over 20 billion served???<br>  <br>  LOL :-)<br>  <br>  Pathetic, isn't it?????|`|b8yHFum8aa	I have never cheated.

LS8LcuRaaa	I'm sorry to say but he's not interested in you and you can't make him change the way he feels about you. You're making excuses for him. He's not shy. If he was shy he wouldn't have kissed you like that at the nightclub. And no guy is worth waiting for. If you wait, you might wait for years. Put yourself in his position. Have you ever had a guy that was interested in you but you didn't really like him? And no matter how much he would have tried to get you to like him it wouldn't have worked. That fact that he doesn't want a relationship with you doesn't have anything to do with you, the chemistry is just not right. I have had guys who were interested in me but I didn't feel the same way. I did like them and I thought they were great guys, but I just didn't feel I wanted to be in a relationship with them. <br>  <br>  If you keep pursing this guy you will push him further away. It's better to stop pursuing and enjoy life. Go out, flirt with other guys. Guys don't respond to phone calls and text messages guys respond to no contact. If he does have some sort of interest in you, he may come out of his shell, if you ignore him for a while. Remember, we all want what we can't have. Try that, but don't wait around for him. Life's too short.|`|KIH1xNEDaa	be open to him,ask him  what he feels about you and let him know about your feelings to him.i think both of them are mature enough to move this relationship a head.if u both are interested to sleep with each other go ahead but be safe.i feel u have started loving him but not sure what he feels about u ?<br>  talk to him that u want to have a long term relation and finally decide if he is ok go a head.<br>  <br>  all the best|`|USMRrv4Paa	forget him

AuTmKSjVaa	Yes, I believe you are.<br>  Well done!|`|J7Mmo5Xmaa	You told this guy you would have kissed him.That would be the same as telling your b/f "Yes I would cheat on you in a heart beat if the guy looks good enough".<br>  Next neither of you were not "drunk".If you were then neither of you need to ever drink again or go to a club because you can not handle that life style.It is strange how you both remember all the details but you were "drunk".|`|vR6AwIppaa	wow.<br>  pretty much.<br>  congrats.|`|dlUgJ5Obaa	I hate the type of girls like you. I feel disgusted.|`|pjQuFJo2aa	yeah you make a week gf. thats why everyone hates you
X4Owk0xTaa	When I had problems with my boyfriend, I would turn to this guy called josh. josh eventually started to develop feelings for me. I got back with my boyriend and we are good now but everytime I look at my good mate josh, I just feel sick and annoyed and feel like he's too needy and clingy even though he hasn't done anything harmful towards me. I think it's just because you've lost that attraction towards reece and get sick at the thought of him having the possibility of liking you in a sexual way.|`|9lT4e8Efaa	you like him! and you don't want to like him because you have a boyfriend so to protect yourself you've convinced yourself everything he does you hate... but if you really think about it Im sure you'll realize you actually like this "Reece" guy... good luck with it x|`|SRZza0cWaa	oohhhh.. you like Reece but you don't know you like him cos maybe you think is not fair on your BF that's why you find him annoying? think about it yeah..good luck...xxx

w9W3wPCOaa	idk look on google, ask ur parents... <br>  <br>  go to the movies or the park, go bikeing, or just play on the computer, smoke a joint idk have gay sex!? u can do anything geez put ur lazy mind to it

h5ghD3Zxaa	This situation calls for your opinion on the matter. Sometimes, people need to hear it from more than one person. She probably only visits like that because you seem to not mind it. That and the fact that she may not have taken her brother seriously because they are so close. <br>  <br>  Being nice to people is a great thing, but we all have our limits. I say if you want your privacy then you talk to her about it. It may have more of a lasting effect if the both of you express your opinions about it. Or hey, both you and your fiance can talk to her together. Either way, something needs to be done, because that is not a very good reason for leaving your fiance.<br>  <br>  Best of luck!|`|yrKq382paa	You and your boyfriend have to decide how much visitation works for you and then he needs to be the one to tell her.

z7BTeUKvaa	Yuck.  That's just wrong.|`|LLeQyWGcaa	i don't think the going out is illegal, but if they have sex it sure would be.|`|8ac2e5cbdd946ee60c803052559873c5aa	Aside from being illegal in MOST states, you mean?  It is because the age span is more than 4 years and he is over 18 and she is not.  It's because our society cares about children more than the proclivities of men.<br>  <br>  Well, we have this thing called the legislature.  The legislature is elected by the people.  The legislators make laws based on public policy, which generally reflects societal opinions and beliefs or the legislators don't get reelected.<br>  <br>  And we have this thing called Police Power, and if the police don't act on criminal behavior, they get fired/ replaced/ not reelected, as the case may be.<br>  <br>  And we have these things called parents.  Parents bring these darling squawling baby girls and boys into the world and have hopes and dreams for them which do not include becoming impoverished by teen pregnancy or diseases.|`|OHfZFR31aa	If she's over 16, it's not illegal but it is creepy. He's old enough to be a college graduate and is fooling around with a high school girl. I'd wonder why he can't find girls his own age to date and has to go out with a high school kid who isn't even old enough to vote.|`|ghz5D5iLaa	You can look this up at legal age of consent. I am not sure which is right for Florida. It says 16/18 bill pending. It is not illegal to date either way. It would be what is legal for sex. I personally would not complain about this if she were my daughter.|`|8103f5a386f35ec2420460c4f3b3dcabaa	a 22 years old to toooo old for a 17 year old..think about it..dating a minor..too many things can happen..legally can get yourself into trouble..|`|NCvvwPEdaa	That is not at all illegal. She is mature enough to understand her responsibilities. You are making a wrong choice by making it illegal.|`|9yurQ85Eaa	The "legal" age of consent in Florida is 18. Is it wrong legally yes but 5 years of an age difference is really not that bad.|`|4KvLIa6Saa	Jail bait in florida> and it could destroy his life as a Predator if convicted >|`|lYZ71zYAaa	As long as they aren't having sex.And who is going to complain? Her parents, if they don't like him.
Zm44FOGraa	You should try talking to the person and see the way they interact with you. If it's positive, maybe they just wanted you to put in the initial effort. Then, you can start rebuilding your friendship. If it's negative though you can a) accept it and move on or b) talk to the individual and ask them why he/ she is treating you that way. Bring up good times, past support, etc. Be apologetic though if you really want them back. Refrain from using the word 'you', (example: "you did this to me.") Instead, say 'I' (example: "i felt...") see how it works. good luck.|`|xc8f2Bunaa	You should. Ask him/her why arent u talking to me anymore. And try to be caring and be attentive to what he says. Just say u're sorry and maybe something like "Can we be friends again?" But dont overdo it. Dont let friendships go past you like i did with mine. How i wanted to kneel infront of my friend and tell him im really sorry cuz i made him real irriatated and embarrased.|`|tTbJWVTiaa	a verry simialr problem happened to me.. its been awhile, and we talk agaain. but its not always the saame.. she doesnnt call me or invite me voer all the time liek we used to, but liek i said we tlak like friends..juust not best ones anymoore.<br>  <br>  you have to understand people change, and friends drift away. try to work ti out with the person, but dont push it. that will sjtu make it worse.<br>  <br>  i hope me and my friend can be bessties again&yours too!<br>  <br>  goodluuuck!|`|kqkgro5Zaa	try talking to them again, but be aware of the tone in their voice if at any point you seem to hear resentment or anger or if its a dull tone then they may be holding something against you still.|`|3reHk4I1aa	i think that she is in a way even though you two said sorry she might be mad deep down inside and maybe you should go confront her and tell her that you feel like she is ignoring you. hope this helps
E7RhMRKhaa	PLEASE , please , please.. This is how the chaos works.  You get offended ( ego) .  I agree that the whole situation would have been better had she said nothing.  However, now she has said something (ego) .  The key is to NOT react to both egos.   The truth that you don't get at that instant,  the other side of the story if you will , is you love her enough to buy her jewelry.  She loves you as much.  Now.....Forgive her and yourself.   Do not react.......and seconds later everything is all right .   Life goes on , perhaps without the chaos.|`|vyNlyfczaa	she did not like the chain - and what is the whole drama about? she is your sister and probably she did not want to make you feel bad! forgive her!

She seems to think very little at times about peoples feelings and how she would feel if she gave you that and you did the same thing as she did.  She did realize how wrong it was, and sorry doesn't take the hurt from you.  But your sisters.  If your going to let something come between you two it should be something MUCH bigger then this issue.|`|yRCBRNOgaa	I can understand how that must have hurt your feelings.  People sometimes say dumb things without even realizing it.<br>  <br>  I think your sis truly regretted saying what she did. She just has a big mouth and she probably wanted to complain about something for attention.<br>  <br>  Next time get her a cheap t-shirt and tell her... "hope you don't have chain closure problems with this gift."<br>  <br>  Don't think about this too much though. She didn't mean to hurt you. She's just spoiled.<br>  <br>  Good luck with your sis in the future.|`|JfeLb2Ptaa	yes. of course forgive your sister. Tell her to go out and buy a new chain that works better for her so that she can wear the pendant. It's just a necklace. Of course forgive your sister. especially if she is trying so hard to apologize.|`|vk3dKR3Caa	Yes, you should forgive her, she has said she was sorry. forgive and forget.  She is your sister.  Don't let this push you apart.  It sounds like you two had a pretty good relationship before,  forgive.|`|4KvLIa6Saa	Show her how to remove it> If she has issue than take her and the chain and get a new clasp that she can handle> Being angry is not the correct way to handle it>|`|nVjhBavpaa	Yes she's your sis and that can never be changed.|`|nEQZtD7Daa	I agree with Cherriz|`|g7uMKvEzaa	Forgiveness is the best thing..Without it there can never be peace.|`|8v5ZtvF2aa	She is your sister, and even if she's hurt you or made you angry she'll always be your sister, unlike friends which u can loose instantly<br>  <br>  so yes you should try to forgive her =]
ymHzdfblaa	so aka latinas jk lol basically because you are probably the same way and I think it could be a crazy sexual turn on for you, was their fighting a lot in ur home when u were little maybe you associate love with fighting cuz everyone fights with their family and you love them, but idk that just my look on it you might like to be dominated or think it hot when u tell a chick to do something and she stands up to you mb ur a bully and like to get with Mean Girls who aren't afraid to tell ppl crap if they get pissed off|`|3Q4Hq99Faa	Hi there, if you're searching for love try this site <a href="http://geratild.myperfectescape.com" rel="nofollow">http://geratild.myperfectescape.com</a> it is free of charge, plus you don't need a credit card.

Take her back IF and WHEN you feel you can and want to or end it.  Whatever suits you.  Kudos baby!!
pRF5LLloaa	No.<br>  <br>  1) DO NOT date co-workers. They talk behind your back, and if something don't go well everybody in the office will know what a jerk you are.<br>  <br>  2) NEVER "dip you pen in the company ink".  DO NOT have sex with co-workers.  Same reason as above, but add this:  If somebody get pregnant or gets an STD, you are really in Deep S--t.<br>  <br>  Not to mention the fact that if YOU say anything it cold be construed as Sexual Harassment, adn you could be fired ---even though it was between consenting adults.|`|YJV2TU6taa	No because if your boss finds out you could get fired.

He is asking for your father's blessing and it would probably be a better impression if he did it man to man.|`|rzPIO1aQaa	He doesn't need to bring anyone and he can do it alone. That way when he asks your dad they can have a man to man talk, do there respect thing and then he will be ok with it or he will not. It is a lot for a man to ask the dad so that is a lot of respect in itself.|`|eSkNDqLKaa	Traditionally, he is to go and ask your father all alone.  That way, they can have the customary Q & A about providing for his daughter, etc...It may seem awkward if anyone else is around.|`|bP5zyipXaa	go alone is best but if he wants to make it a family afair than that would be nice best of luck|`|tAmzvFdVaa	If you're American, it's usually a private matter between your boyfriend and your dad.

iN27E3WCaa	Maybe they want the cruise with you to be entirely focused on your wedding, and so they've booked a cruise beforehand so they can focus their attention then to the sights around them.  The specialness of your wedding will in no way be diminished.  Besides, the SP islands are so beautiful that even seeing them a hundred times would still take your breath away.<br>  <br>  I think you just need to relax and remember that your parents have wants and needs, too.
Q7ALl9zeaa	Uh huh and you better! Maybe she wanted to have that experience, isn't that what a wedding is about..to say you did it and to remember those moments. She probably had people asking, how you asked here, and she didn't know what to say. Ya, it may be a little over rated in a way, but it will spark her love, and is a way for you to show some creativity and expression of that love. Women are complicated sometimes, just like men can be simple...it's what makes men and women such a great team. It sounds like you guys don't get to see each other all the time, so that makes things all the more difficult. Be strong, be there for her and do what is right. Now let your lovin' juices flow and think of the perfect way to show her how you feel. think about time you have spent together, crazy stuff, anything that will show her you remember a special time or embrace spontaneity. Good luck and congratulations!|`|HcboXOmjaa	Good call on still proposing when you see her. My only guess a that this was simply a miscommunication between the 2 of you. You should have told her you weren't planning on proposing with a ring because most girls expect that and she probably just assumed you were going to to "make it official"|`|RRqXXG2Taa	every girl dreams as a young child about mister right coming and proposing the reason shes upset is because without the ring and the proposal you kinda wreck one of her childhood dreams i recommend taking her dinner or something and proposing WITH A RING|`|Og9abf2baa	The girls want the perfect story to brag to everyone about for the rest of their lives...it's important for you to be apart of that PERFECT FAIRYTALE Story!|`|tSh1zh7gaa	I did not want anything fancy. I knew I was getting married, I picked the ring. He did not have to ask me but he did after we knew we would anyways...<br>  <br>  I was in a towel when he did it and it was very special...do it anyways..<br>  <br>  Get her a ring and do it anyways...it does not have to cost anything or be expensive....|`|gg3QGBspaa	you know what's funny, i'm almost in the same boat as your girlfriend.  i have been with the same man for almost 6 years, we have a 2 year old, but i'm still hell-bent on him proposing to me and having the "fairy-tale".|`|6eGZGEw4aa	It's important because it makes everything official and complete for the girl. And like someone said, every girl dreams of what her proposal will be like. For me, I would want my boyfriend to express how he feels for me through his proposal, just because it's cute! :)|`|VsLSJ65Paa	Ill agree with Cynthia on this one. GUys dont seem to realize how much girls talk with one another and compare life experiences.  Girls dream of the day that the man that the love finally proposes to them.  Dont look down on it~! Im sure that you can make it fun and exciting foryourself too . Dont you want the day that you commit yourself to someone special?~
997sxSawaa	You would just need to get a permit from the park in order to hold your ceremony there. Go to the town hall and they should be able to direct you on how to go about doing so. Good luck with your big day.|`|26cae2932c19d290ec2e4570f9542e0baa	Yes that is fine. Call up the parks dept to see if you need a permit or not.|`|EppioSNtaa	I don't know about you but public parks are meant for everyone so if you want a wedding there then go right ahead, just expect some unwanted guests there if you plan on doing it.<br>  <br>  Congratulations and good luck!

qMnuRO50aa	It's a good thing that you write about your penis in the Friends forum. Penises are our friends.<br>  <br>  I remember I had that same kind of bump once, and they had to cut it off. My penis that is. Then when they removed the bump and tried to re-attach the penis, they accidentally attached a carrot in its place. I get all the chicks now.|`|YmwzubmFaa	penis equals love ?.
SnpP6dGFaa	I'm more attracted to athletes, but I would never think a guy was lazy if he didn't play a sport.  Unless the guy was huge and ate maccas all the time lol|`|gFHzuIrUaa	No, girls won't think your lazy. Some girls like jocks, some girls don't and some girls just don't care.|`|rAvZ9yGcaa	Your knees are more important.<br>  <br>  I personally don't like guys who play sports because they're usually the obnoxious type that I can't hold a conversation with.  Although, soccer players are very cool.  (I'm one.)  However, if a girl doesn't see that you have a good reason for not playing a sport, she isn't even worth the worry.  <br>  <br>  Do what's best for your body at this point.|`|dr3ar8SKaa	Yer so a sporty guy is cool but it doenst matter what you do people might not be looking for that<br>  <br>  x|`|M0KLWw54aa	yup
MD8Sg6knaa	I would try talking to her, if you have any classes with her try asking a question that has to do with the assignment or class. If she answers you and you feel brave enough bring up something different. You could try talking to her about something you both have in common it makes it a lot easier! Trust me!|`|AlDUph0Paa	just tell her how you feel but don't make it obvious like say it in a kind of joke and if she looks at you weirdly then tel her it as a joke and move on. if she goes red then she likes you.|`|zQSnNBj1aa	u have a crush its cute i remember when i was ur age but i was kinda a man hore coz i came from an all guys school to a co-ed school i went out with pretty much all the girls in my year but yer do wot that guy said in the first comment
pZGVI9dPaa	Sounds like he wants to keep you to himself but he doesn't want to be tied down to YOU. It seems that he wants you but wants to be free from the "labels" so he can still go out with other girls. I don't know why you would put up with the way he's stringing you along and confusing you. Maybe you should give the promise ring back and tell him you can't wear it because he made no promises to you about exclusive dating or about anything that would make the relationship feel more secure. It's up to you but I wouldn't want to be his girl that's waiting for him to toss you some crumbs once in awhile. You deserve better than that. Think about dating the next time you two are off. I wish you all the happiness that you deserve whether it is with him or with someone else.|`|P4fBHZGdaa	what kinda promis is that. sound kinda messed up.<br>  dont let him play with ur feelings. be straight up with him and ask him whats going on. if he doesnt want to get serious than u should probably stop ur relationship with him since u said u want to be with him so bad.|`|kSIbucMjaa	whats a promise ring?
g2ghIJ0Aaa	Dude, it's fine.. you can't be around each other 24/7 or your never gonna last.  Have some trust.. woman appreciate trust.|`|zkyFY8xYaa	I'd say it just means she still loves you but she wants to spend time with her friends too. Remember that they're important to her aswell. And maybe they haven't seen her as much as they want to and thats why she's saying this. But I think your relationship sounds like its fine and I don't think this is a very big deal!!!<br>  x|`|J7Mmo5Xmaa	A break up is definitely coming.<br>  Little fights, her wanting to not be with you.She can see her friends and family with you around, but she wants to be away from you.|`|yPX1E3Bbaa	she just wants to spend some times with her family and her friends.im guessing since she's been with you she doesn't spend a lot of time with them. so she needs some space and spend time with them.|`|0DSQAIM9aa	I think maybe she just needs a little space.|`|AA11363993	from a women's point of view , I  would say she ready to breakup|`|7LvHehqaaa	like she said she just needs a break! u was friends before so she'll come back to you! give her space might be good for your relationship!
8XKmMBU7aa	1. No<br>  2. No<br>  3. No<br>  4. My thought - if I find my dream girl, I will start with each & every stuff, not only these.<br>  <br>  have a nice day and nice dream.<br>  Any one can add me in his/her contacts, So you may remained in my touch.|`|1PdUecpYaa	i don't usually call or text first, just out of habit, but i do like to text a couple of times every two days or so. i always give them some space. i don't want them to think i'm clingy.<br>  i'm not in a relationship right now though...|`|c6g92RRVaa	i am normally at work during the day but he doesn't answer his phone so I stopped texting lol. I sometimes text him when I am with my friends. Normally during the day I try to text a couple times to catch up but like  I said he doesn't answer his phone much and only get about 2 texts out of him. He doesn't phone me and I can't afford to.|`|YV3Dh4lQaa	this guy i'm talking to texts me in the morning, through out the day, and before we go to sleep.|`|85ENTqo9aa	allways text them
RD0yaJlgaa	seduce him by wearing only your undies or by taking your clothes off in front of him. That is if it's ok to you|`|W0kDKnYCaa	I have several suggestions, but seeing as you may be under 18 and yahoo will not let me answer the way I could. You are welcome to email me if you wish. Good luck and safe sex otherwise|`|AA12138902	Hi! first I wanna know what does it mean of "get kinky" <br>  so if I were know the meaning of that I could hlep you so ... ...|`|nVtl9thjaa	ROLEPLAY!|`|VvNKTFhJaa	arrange an over night stay with him.|`|DsnMKfLsaa	Watch porn?<br>  What eles?|`|Nf286ct2aa	why don't you ask him what he means? Maybe it's a good idea to discuss how kinky both of you are willing to get before hand...
IPS3hWweaa	You should move on. Some guys get stuck in their ways and are in no hurry to get things moving. If you want a marriage in your life its going to happen with someone else. If he hasn't done anything in 3 years, he's not going to do anything in the next 3.<br>  <br>  Additional deatails<br>  Yeah, I knew you meant "tie the knot."|`|htWw0OlCaa	If you are feeling like this now, then maybe it is best that you move on. I think you did pretty much answer your own question, but it doesn't hurt to get someone else's opinion....Best wishes|`|EZKe92TTaa	Before you take a drastic step, you didn't write if you're still in love with him. What steps have you taken to remedy the present situation? What are his views about being in this state of limbo? Have you tried counseling together or even tried taking a break to see how you both feel apart? There are some options which you should look into before a firm separation. If all of these have been explored or discussed and you still remain in this situation, then there's nothing more to think about, is there? Your fiance obviously isn't ready to commit, so you must think of yourself so you can hopefully find a brighter future. Right now it seems pretty dim. Good luck to you.|`|J7Mmo5Xmaa	After 3 yrs he has no intention of marrying you.I mean why should he?Sex, financial help etc. HJe has ALL the perks of marriage without the commitment and has the :one foot out the door" mentality in case something better comes along or you become hard to live with.<br>  Move on out and then next time, date the guy, get to know him without sex or shacking.It takes about a year or so and you do not run the risk of getting pregnant by someone it  will not work out with, and you do not end up getting used for sex as in your case now.|`|uPL3e3tyaa	Whose idea was it to get engaged in the first place? Was he doing it to hold onto you, or because that was part of a master plan for the future?? You don't have to marry someone to love them; most men aren't built for the job and most women aren't willing to sacrifice what's necessary for a marriage to succeed. Your question bears out this theory...
32xAPpvvaa	yea...i had to kick him off..somewhere he didnt want to be kickeed|`|2VO4dc30aa	no but one of my ex's said he was going to rape me<br>  if i didnt sleep with him.. i slept with him :./|`|SW1j22IIaa	that is rape love no means no|`|SRZza0cWaa	OMG.. yeah some guy i went out with never took no for an answer.. & it could too much so i stopped seeing him...:(|`|n1y67ZNuaa	No.|`|5H8kjwHDaa	No but I've forced myself on my girlfriend after she said NO plenty of times, and she always gets into it. That's just us though, and if she didn't enjoy it once I got past her "defenses" I wouldn't keep going, because what fun would that be?|`|Zdj6wmaiaa	I've had people persist to the point where I eventually gave in, but never if I flat out said No.  That should be respected.|`|kDz9gcMuaa	Im a boy but if he had sex with you said no before that is rape.

I mean if we are all honest nobody particularly loves spending loads of time with the LOUD member of the group..the one that talks about what they had for breakfast lunch and dinner. The shy people often make better listeners and more enjoy more Genuine Friendships :)|`|c8RbKtD3aa	Only in groups.

TQW5E6olaa	To be blatantly honest, he's lost interest. He isn't making any effort to spend time with you, he's making it your fault, saying you don't appreciate him since he's not cheating, what are you supposed to be worshiping him for not being a cheating asshole? He's no longer interested and he's blaming it on you. It isn't you, he's just moved on.  He sounds like a real jerk.|`|y1gsXEwOaa	He's losing interest in you.<br>  I'd put the baby up for adoption.<br>  Live your life more freely.|`|9580a1e44dd3d2bae7d2f867611ab353aa	? I had a friend that did this.. He was dating a girl, and wasn't happy with her, so he would come up with reasons to be away from her, take on more hours at work, help out friends all the time, anything to be gone from her (eventually they broke). Kind of sounds like your man is doing the same thing, sounds like he is coming up with excuses to be away from you :( sorry. And it probably has nothing to do with you, your probably a great person, he just is not 'feeling' it anymore. I would just flat out say to him, Either you want a relationship with me or you don't, but if you do, you need to start acting like it, and if you don't then you need to say so now (but be ready for the answer, it might not be what you want to hear)|`|bb713fc490338057a5e1c0768ae1fb0baa	it sounds like he's mad and resentful you dont spend a whole lot of time with him and he's taking it out on you. you vshould confront him about it and if it doesnt go over too well suggest taking a break... i hope it all works out for you|`|r23H0m30aa	I think u should start look after urself and do something with ur life instead of just thinking about ur bf wat he would do or wat he doesnt do to u..<br>  He behaves like typicall guy ..he just want run away from taking care and taking responsability of his baby..<br>  He works 40 hours a week Does he give u the money to support the baby>?<br>  First u should involve him more in care of his child so then u could have some time for urself!<br>  Instead of going 2 hours early to work he should spent that time with his son...Im telling u be straight with him and sort out the hours and days he would care of child and u ll have some life gal..Go out shopping,meet with friends etc..]<br>  He might be bored or at least hes got the life ..at work u havent got any<br>  I bet when u start to have some life u ll feel better and u would look at that guy in diffrent way im sure he would appreacited u more!!!!<br>  Believe me..
2MoU921aaa	YES , that happens alot  . in fact it happened yesterday , and when people say are you okay it makes it worse!. I wish could deal with my emotions better sometimes its embarassing.

UpFgHQ9caa	i would say past relationships & or knowledge of your or other peoples  past relationships... low self esteem could have a lot to do with it but that cant be it all. he is probably listening to what other people are saying or maybe u are doing sertant thing that he over thinks and that will make people get paranoid. hope this helps a little there is nothing u can really do about just try your best to let him kno that u are faithful to him

If she's the kind of person you say she is, nobody will believe her when she starts talking sh!t about you.  Besides, those who know you and who are worth knowing would tell her to get lost.

Whd6tqLzaa	Its never okay or will be ever okay to get involved with someone who is married to someone else. If you think that man is your soul mate then you should wait until he is divorced. How do you know someone else's husband is your soul mate? Because he is paying extra attention to you. Believe me, this attention will evaporate once you get him under your clutches.|`|OHfZFR31aa	Do you really think her husband went with her because he was in love with her, or he was in love with her $500 million inheritance from her father?<br>  <br>  Who is to say what is a soulmate. You don't know that until you really get to know a person. If that person really is your soulmate, they will leave their spouse and file for divorce if they wanted to be with you.|`|AA11538662	NEVER!!

If someone is willing to leave their spouse for you, who's to say they might not leave you for someone else later on?  Besides, you would be looked down upon as a homewrecker.  If they were separated or in the process of getting a divorce, however, you would be in a better position.  In that case, I'd recommend taking it slow.|`|qw7BmBq6aa	No it isn't okay.  Stop watching those hollywood sluts.  They'er all just a bunch of self absorbed bimbo's who don't care about anyone or anything but their own selfish wants.<br>  <br>  It is NEVER okay.

How do you know that someone is your "soul mate"?<br>  <br>  2. Never use Hollywood marriages as an example! Even the best ones never last long anyway! A couple who is noted for staying together "for so long" with a "rock solid love" will be divorced within a few years! It happens constantly, Hollywood is another world.<br>  <br>  If you really think somebody is your soul-mate, why not practice the self-control to not get involved with them on a sexual level until you have finalized your divorce? Then you will be able to hold your head up high knowing you did the right thing, and you & your "soul mate" won't have to walk around in any type of shame, on any level. If the two of you were to get married, your future marriage wouldn't be soiled in any way by past actions committed together while you were still married to somebody else.|`|omalHCZ1aa	"Some people think if someone else is your soulmate, then it is okay to be with that person even if the person is married to someone else."<br>  <br>  The only people who think that are the ones trying to justify sleeping with   a married person.

No self respecting person would get involved in the first place.|`|48Q4XUA5aa	I would imagine that it would depend on the situation and the person.<br>  I met my current love while I was yet LEGALLY married to some one I was divorcing. This process was already well underway. In fact at that point he, my baby cake, was my very good friend and was just a VERY good listener, and of course we were on the phone only at that point. Finally my ex left the state and got himself a girlfriend <br>  ...another one,(or maybe that was other way around). <br>  I knew I wasn't ABOUT to be n2 him anymore whether or not I had met my new friend. The marriage was OVER like Michael Jackson jackets in summer time and we were WELL past the point of return, like YEARS past it.<br>  <br>  I wasn't willing to not talk to my friend simply because of a court procedure. <br>  <br>  My ex has since remarried, ( and no, not to the new girlfriend, a different one among many) and I have my same wonderful exciting respectful ambitious friend, who is now my fiance. <br>  I ammmm sooo much better for knowing him.<br>  <br>  This time I chose to be with a man that is whole.<br>  <br>  I will say however. I was GLAD when that divorce was final, but it was just a closing step in the process of divorce. I was DONE loooong before that day.|`|9IT6iTswaa	No, I don't feel it is ok to get involved with a married person. Bottom line, they are taken. Regardless if they tell you the marriage isn't good or whatever.  Until they are single again, I say stay away.|`|qGeTeZRnaa	I don't think its ever ok but then again I don't believe in "soul mates". There is always someone else out there that you can be a happy and in love with.
Njx3roeDaa	Zoe,<br>  <br>    I was in the same situation. Sit down with the person stalking me after class and say, "No offense, but I kind of need personal face. I don't want to hurt your feelings, but can you please stop following me around? It's really uncomfortable when your following me around and calling me? I know you like me, but I don't really like you back."<br>  <br>     Perhaps you just want to be friends with him? Though he could be an odd friend. Just make sure you say that. It will knock some sense into him, ya know. :)<br>  <br>     Good Luck!<br>  <br>     -Julz|`|AoPcWYvdaa	You should maybe give him a chance. I mean you can hang out with a guy even if you don't like them. After hanging out with him for a couple weeks then see where it goes from there. Don't be all worried about it, happens to me all the time. And like I said, give him a chance, he might end up to be a great guy!|`|1dP7Viiuaa	you just have to be firm and direct about him. tell him hes bothering you and to leave you alone. if you keep worrying about whether your treating him nicely or not, your gonna be the one who suffers in the end.|`|0qxMI0sSaa	Nxt time you see him just point out very clearly that you don't like him and he shouldn't be wasting his time coz your never gunna change your mind. Make sure your not too harsh just tell him straight.|`|Cm1EYRnSaa	a brave boy, i appreciate him.<br>  tell him you don't like him is enough,|`|Zq1mWeIiaa	I once got a girl not to like me by casually picking my nose and eating a bogey in front of her.|`|PuMsIIL6aa	You seem nice not to kill him like I probably would do if someone was stalking me, but just tell him how you honestly feel yourself and if that doesn't work file a report with the cops (or punch him).
vg2xABZjaa	I don't think your find any sympathy here Tom. You do not own a house and you have no job. If it was not for your mother owning a house you would live in a alley in a box. I am guessing your mom gets a check that can cover food and other necesities. That check would probably buy some other things if you were not mooching off of her! I myself would never put a parent in a situation like this. Get a job today! give half your check to your Mom every time you get paid until you move out. If  your Mom can not make it financially on her own it is your duty as her son to help her out.|`|XlGjBPBTaa	Well Thomas; since she has no money and you have no money then her greatest asset is you.<br>  Get out and hustle some coins to get a toilet.<br>  You can pick up cans or scrap metal; you can go door to door and do odd jobs.<br>  The work is out there if you want it.  Just look around at all the Mexicans working in your community doing what you believe is beneath your station while your station doesn't even have a working toilet.
215dfe0c283eb141a2ed0b4dcb32274caa	My SIL's hubby was cheating on her and there were some obvious signs that this was going on. They had lost complete emotional connetion, he didn't ever kiss her, he was always "working late", odd charges on their bank statement, he started sleeping on the couch instead of in their bed, he found every excuse he could to get out of the house. He got caught because I believe he wanted to be caught. I know how it is being a woman, the last thing we want is for our husbands to be cheating so that is the first thing that pops into our head when something isn't going our way. That is the lastthing we want but the easiest explanation. When my hubby goes out with his friends, which is once in a blue moon, they are always doing things I would never do or things my husband is embarrassed of, so he "forgets to mention" things about their excursions. That doesn't mean he is cheating, it just means he is embarrassed of his behavior and would rather not share it. Maybe this is the reason for the lying. He wants you to think of him as a better person so he lied about the events of the night/day to spare you. What was the reason he gave for lying? Only having sex once per week doesn't point to cheating to me, at least. If he works long days he is most likely just tired, nothing more than that, but if he seems emitionally detactched you may have a problem that needs to be worked out. My last question, (I know I am not suppose to be the one asking question but....) Is there any reason for him to cheat? I mean, has there been problems in your relationship that would lead him to want to be with another woman? He married you, he vowed his forever love to you, he would have to have some serious reasons to want to mess that up, especially with 2 children and another on the way! So I guess what I am saying here is not to jump to conculsions, talk with him and tell him you are feeling this way. I know this is the last thing in the world my husband would ever want me to think, but we are only human and our minds get the better of us sometimes! Best of luck in this situation!|`|KqQlWbYsaa	I honestly cannot say with certainty one way or another.  However, I suggest that you submit your case to television-famous Cheaters Licensed Detective Agency via the following link:  <a href="http://www.cheaters.com/?page=submit-a-case;" rel="nofollow">http://www.cheaters.com/?page=submit-a-c...</a> and I sincerely hope that you get the resolution you are seeking.<br>  <br>  By the way, though you may not like hearing this for obvious reasons, while hubby may not be cheating, it does appear that he does not for whatever reason want to have sex with you with greater frequency than presently occurs.|`|HE56Jra6aa	Sex once a week does not make him account for Cheating. you need to step up and make plans for him and you to be alone. His drinking with friends, because you don't do it. Try to get a sitter and invite yourself out with them and see for yourself. Chances are he isn't.<br>  Don't make something out of nothing.<br>  Check before react.... Good Luck.|`|yB54t7ZFaa	You need to just pay attention more to the things he does and the way he acts from on now. No one can really say right now because there is no evidence. But always follow your gut it never lies. I hope the best for you.|`|LNSiLxlBaa	Well I will say that catching him in ANY lies, is not a good sign. ESPECIALLY lies about where he is at any given time. Sounds sketchy. You didn't provide enough info. or circumstantial evidence for us to convict him of the crime just yet though.|`|b99c02d2efcaf0924dc72f729d7ae118aa	If you're instincts tell you he's cheating, then he probably is.

I also had 2 children and one on the way. My husband was cheating on me. He was spending time away from home drinking, saying he was out with his friends. It seems to me you need to stay focus on your children and the one on the way. Try to think of ways to spark new interest in your home life. (not necessarily sex life) Find new things to talk about, things you both can do together while the children are asleep. Try being more interested in what he does and says even if you're not.Most of all smile more.|`|pxygDg7Aaa	You have sex once a week??!!  You go girl!!|`|YjaVT2JHaa	i dont think he is cheating but the lieing is a problem. tell him how you feel|`|F3LBgfvwaa	No way to tell just by what you have said. Keep watching for bigger signs that he's cheating. If you don't find anything else, you can assume he's still faithful to you.|`|ZbnxGIsnaa	Well, that's a tough one dear.  I wouldn't sling a finger QUITE YET.  Does he stop saying, I love you, etc. . . There has been quite a few times recently that my husband and I have only had sex once a week and it's not because he's cheating.  Just work was stressful for him and I was tired.  What you want to look out for is when he stops being affectionate to you and doesn't want to have sex with you at all anymore.  That's a big one!   How should I put it.  You know your husband and if the warning bells are going off for you then go with it.  I sure hope he's not!|`|AA11857949	If you had a basement in your house i would let them in there, or a garage, i guess it would be better than having him go out to the bars, in which like you said its kind of hard to do. I don't understand why you wont let him drink at home as long as the friends and him keep the noise down or there ain't an violence going on, I would rather have him doing it at home if you think that cheating is going on.|`|34b40Vu3aa	There have to be other red flags other than that.  Have you told him you want more sex?  And you are the one that wanted him to leave to go out with friends and I don't think every weekend is too much.  If you want to spend more time with him, communicate that to him as well as your concern.  You will better be able to judge what is going on once you open the lines of communication.|`|MOMb0Amoaa	its sort of unclear.  The signs you have mentioned are sure negetive but not enough to conclude that he is cheating.  Keep looking for signs sooner or later whatever is the truth you will come to know.<br>  <br>  My parents have been together for 26 years and hardly ever sleep together.  And i know for sure my dad is not cheating because he is very dedicated to his family and loves us all.

That would help your relationship and put your mind at ease....or confirm your suspicions.
a9edf71cdaa0f9ac307e3492a0235c8faa	Wow. Look he told you he likes you. It's not the same as love but it's a start. Clearly there's something about you that he deemed worthy enough material to show to his family. When a guy likes being with you; that's a good thing. He can't just love you before liking you. It shows that he's in good company when you're there and you're pleasant to be around. That's a good thing in the long run. If he's hiding the fact that he can't say I love you, yet again or is holding back for some reason; maybe he feels that it's not something that should be thrown around like snowballs on a snowy day...they tend to camouflage back into the snow. Who knows, maybe he just appreciates you a little more and wants it to mean something than just a response to your "I love you". Try to find out what's running through his mind, or better yet, relax a little and go with the flow. I've been with my boyfriend 4 years. I know he likes being around me and the moron can't propose to me yet because he hasn't saved up enough money for a ring he feels worthy of it. I told him I didn't care if it was 20 dollars from Macy's as long as I knew that he wanted to spend the rest of his life with me. Then I through an ice at him because I got mad. <br>  <br>  Lol. For all it's worth I don't think you're going anywhere anytime soon. He's thinking of you and I'm sure he cares about you dearly. <br>  <br>  Good luck; and don't pull your hairs out for what could be nothing.|`|F3OFvSWvaa	it depends hOw lOng yuh been tOgether ; i think with every relatiOnship a pOint cOmes where it feels like "its nOt the same" i went thrO it every time and sO have my frends. juss have a seriOus cOnvO with him abOut it and tell him what yuh dnt like and ask him nOt tO dO it anymOre. i dnt think he lOves yuh any less especially cuz he wants yuh tO meet his family . i think its just becuz yuhve been tOgether awhile and its nOt as exciting as it was wen yuh first gOt tOgether . i hOpe it wOrks Out babe :)|`|J0VzIyYjaa	I know how you feel =/ i had the same problem  with my boyfriend. you say you've talked to him about it...idk what you said but i would tell him that when he jokes about it, it really hurts a lot. You just need to be reassured and that he would love you with or without the sex because him saying "i have sex with you, i like you" doesn't mean a lot =( tell him if he doesn't listen to you then things are going to get worse. Tell him that if he really loves you he will listen and make sure you know he really does love you
wXaGIPSPaa	People never like change and always frown on something different. <br>  I think its gotten alot of bad plublicity. Every time I have seen a show on tv about it it portrays polygamous as welfare dependent, foodstamp using, sex maniacs hungering for l4 year old wives, with rampant spouse abuse and domination.  Then there are the children...people fear they are also being victimized. They think the partners are always on the prowl for new people to add to the "family".  <br>  Its lack of understanding about how partners are selected, how sex is arranged (they imagine it as kinky ....orgies etc or other partners doing without when main one is with another)  And while society is somewhat tolerant of men who are with multiple partners they have always thought since women have one egg and carry a baby that they can only be with one man....? It also has been linked to cheaters (as you admit) <br>  I understand about the income...makes alot of sense esp with the way things are. <br>  I think its wrong for people to make cruel comments. you are right to live your life true to yourself as long as you are not hurting others. <br>  No matter what you do someone will critisize you for something. That is just how selfish greedy arrogant people are. <br>  If you are happy and so are your partners then you have somethign special and maybe other people whose lives arent working may be a little jealous since they followed the "rules" and you didnt and your way works? ! <br>  good luck and have a great week.|`|djUMvICoaa	Most people would be appalled that you would go against social norms and live like this and have all kinds of names to hang on you.  For me what you do behind closed doors is none of our business so why do you flaunt it?  That's the only way someone could end up being appalled at you.|`|ULUpOqplaa	As most philosophers have said since Plato, and ever psychologist since Shakespear, what they protest so much about is what they secretly want themselves.|`|tvUAO4ioaa	Maybe it bothers them that you are practicing something you don't even know the name of. It is polyandry when women take multiple husbands, not polygamy.|`|gfHutvEFaa	I couldn't care less what you do in your own home.|`|OLnmXeWDaa	You are telling us they both get all they need? Sure. I know lots of women who want twice as  much sex as the men. Some. one. none.<br>  <br>  What happens when you get pregnant? Paternity test? Do you seriously think they will both be able to treat another guy's kid as well as their own? Do you not read about all the boyfriends who abuse and kill the kids from their girl's earlier marriages?<br>  <br>  You no longer have the strong bond of monogamous love to hold you to either of them. When you are 50 and they bring in an 18 year old who is more attractive to them than you?<br>  <br>  Your little fantasy is a recipe for disaster, and as a taxpayer, I'll be stuck taking care of your kids after you all split.|`|krQiDGCHaa	It is my honest opinion that I do not give a rat's *ss what you do behind your own closed doors.<br>  <br>  As long as all three of you are consenting adults who are happy to be in the relationship, I see no issue with it.  Personally, I could *never* live that like because I would be way too jealous.  My husband and I have a very strong connection that I wouldn't be comfortable sharing with someone else.  However, it is also my opinion that not everyone shares the same thoughts, feelings, or opinions that I do, and if that life works well for you than that should be YOUR business.<br>  <br>  I do not understand why it is against the law.  I do not see how this harms or effects other people.  I think laws should ONLY be in place if they are to avoid harming or affecting others, and I do not see how polygamy or polyandry affect anyone but the parties involved in the relationship.  It's just like gay marriage -- there is NO REASON for it to be against the law.  It doesn't affect anyone but the people involved, so who cares?!<br>  <br>  Live and let live.<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  ADD ON:  I also must add, to all the Bible-thumpers, United States was supposed to be founded on freedom of religion.  Therefore, something shouldn't be against the law simply because it is morally "wrong" according to the Bible.  Laws are not supposed to be based on religion.  Religion is a PREFERENCE and a CHOICE, not something that is supposed to be forced upon you.  No one HAS to obey the Bible, they choose to.|`|qw7BmBq6aa	Because you'er having an affair on your husband.  It doesn't matter if he's okay with it, because it is still an affair and a breach of what marriage is.  <br>  <br>  Why is it people like YOU think it's okay to get married and then crap all over the meaning of it?  YOU shouldn't have gotten married.<br>  <br>  People frown on it because it is not what marriage is.  Marriage is the bond between one man and one wife.  Not one woman who can't stop herself from falling in love with every man in sight.|`|omalHCZ1aa	This is far from the norms of society so it probably scares people.

I wouldn't personally do it.|`|efd58f9f10255a49b40c8ada4aae33d8aa	I think, it's totally fine if your husband has accepted it. Actually this idea is very interesting and I wish, I will see the day when polygamy will be totally legalized form of marriage in all or some of the EU countries. The more than 1 partner arrangement would be useful in my home as well.  Basically it could be very practical and make daily life easier. Currently being a polygamist is not possible, because it's legal to be married to only one person at a time. Naturally sharing a home with more than 1 partner works out. <br>  <br>  Probably the problem of yours has to something with american culture.<br>   and taboos.  People back in there seem to be still relatively conservative and imagine that only their way is the best possible to live. Other women may also think that you would be interested into their husbands as well. <br>  <br>  Just live your own way as you wish and do not care what other people say. They may be annoying at you if they find you immoral, but they can't take your life away from you.|`|8ac2e5cbdd946ee60c803052559873c5aa	You're flaunting it now.

How about the compelling need for society to uphold the sanctity of marriage for the sake of society?

But other people are welcome to their own opinions ont he matter, and part of living your life in a strikingly different way is understanding that other people may not agree.|`|bXmRWbEdaa	I can't believe that your husband prefers this situation over having you exclusively.  Maybe he puts up with it because he adores you, but you are being mean to him by having this arrangement.|`|AA11447210	Because hundreds of years of church control and dogma has brainwashed people into thinking monogamy is the only appropriate way, even though humans weren't wired by Nature to be naturally monogamous.<br>  <br>  What you do is your business if it harms no one. I don't feel I'd make the choice you have, but I'm 100% behind your right to do so. I feel any consenting adults that desire to marry should be able to so do...no matter what sex they are, or how many spouses they would like to have.<br>  <br>  If the gov't were clever (wishful thinking, I know) they'd figure out a way to tax it and use it (multiple spouses) to their advantage. There is absolutely no reason why it should be illegal...it may just require fairly frequent DNA testing to determine the biological father of children in such relationships as yours (but that should be at your cost).|`|Whd6tqLzaa	If both of you (you and your husband) are satisfied with the arrangement, then why does it matter what other people think?<br>  <br>  Personally, I find it unacceptable, and surprises me how your husband could accept such an accommodation. <br>  <br>  What the hell is wrong in your marriage? Most probably your husband has an ED and he doesn't care if you satisfy your sex drive with another man. <br>  <br>  What will you do when you have children? Most probably your children will learn to grow up with two dads in the house and following your foot steps when they grow up. What a dysfunctional example your're setting for them!

AA11909552	Women are "catty" in general, but those in the "adult industry" are NO exception. These women are professionals and they *know*exactly* what to say to a man. Did you read me? "They are professionals!"<br>  I was "in love" with 2 different escorts at separate times. My guy friend who was the manager at Goodguys Gentlemens club in D.C. said to me, "You do NOT make those kinds of girls your 'girlfriend'". But, of course, I didn't listen. I was overwhelmed by the idea of how good it was, both separate times.<br>  Granted, strippers are not generally prostitutes, but it is alllll the same industry and they all "know how to manipulate a man", cos they are pros. Even the fully dressed bar maids. THEY actually get hit on THE MOST, cos they are down-there in the pit with the galking men.<br>  I highly recommend you do NOT involve yourself with these kinds of women, but if you insist that you can take the heat...<br>  Now, as far as your unique situation, the "bar maid" might actually have some sort of feelings for you, which is unique in itself. (but that is *her* fantasy-part) It is all a sham, though. These kinds of girls are *truly* messed uP in the head!<br>  Imagine working in a bar for years-on-end getting hit on all the time by mostly ugly women (this is their train of thought). You would certainly view women differently, would you not? But lets say you come across a "Jane" that peaks your interest. Then, she (all of a sudden) starts to flirt with one of your male stripper co-workers, wouldn't *YOU* be standoff-ish?<br>  I highly recommend that you forget about these girls and find yourself a real woman in the real world. The stripper world is fake and a "fantasy". There would be nothing-but trouble to come out of it, you watch. (that is IF you stay in your current situation, of course)<br>  This is all coming from a fellow "man" who is a long-time "fed uP with adulteresses" type. That's the only reason I put sssO much into this answer.<br>  Good luck my brother!<br>  -Thrasher<br>  [I'm the only ans.

D1beU6MPaa	Well you know what they say, misery loves company, so by the time I finish telling you my story, you will think again. LOL<br>  My MIL is gone now, but Oh Lordy, just listen to this.<br>  Shortly after me and my hubby married, he had to have surgery on his arm. The next thing I know here comes a box in the mail with some very large shirts. In the bottom of the box were several thank you cards. Her SIL gave her the shirts that belonged to her husband, and the cards were sent to insure that I thanked them for the shirts. She didn't think I had sense enough to think of that on my own. I was 40 at the time.<br>  <br>  One night I was talking to her on the phone and dumb me mentioned that my husband sometimes said his head got cold at night.Next thing I know here comes another package. This time it is a yellow terry cloth women's turban.<br>  <br>  <br>  One time she came for a visit. I was still in bed one morning with the window open. We have horses and I had just been to the Coop for feed. I buy them in 100 pound bags. I had left the bags in my car and told my hubby to get them out. I heard him open the door of my car and the next thing I hear is "Can't Vicki do that?". He was unloading the 100 pound bags out of my car, and she thought I should do it.<br>  <br>  Another time we were visiting her in Michigan. She was standing in the  dining room and my husband and I were standing in the living room. All of a sudden she looked at me and said, "I saw you pounding on him". I was six feet away from him.<br>  <br>  I could tell you things like this for the next three days. Just to let you know, you ain't got it that bad honey. LOL<br>  <br>  I know it seems hard on you, but read this again, and you will probably feel grateful. Hugs honey|`|QFf9phAmaa	you just ignore it.|`|qxJ4KauPaa	wow...that sounds really annoying. if i were u, i would move to some other place. rent an apartment somewhere a bit far from her so she couldn't come and annoy u every 5 min. but of course, u would have to discuss with your boyfriend first|`|f5a8d99afbb73cd0703df99b87996901aa	Oh, my God!  I'd have to move!  My hubby suggested we move next door to his mom and I said I'd rather divorce him!  Without being rude, it's going to be hard.  Maybe work into the conversation that you've been really pressed for time lately and hope she gets the message. Try setting up a weekly lunch date with her.  At least if you do that, you can fall back on it by saying "remember when I said I was doing *insert pressing activity here*? " Well, I'd love to talk but I'm sooo behind right now I just have to go." Tell her you'd love to hear all about it at your lunch date but right now you have to run.  I soooo don't envy you!|`|hXz9jZnCaa	shes jst worried about her son most mothers are and she's also jst trying to get on ur nerves.. if i wer u tune her out... practice to listen but not really be there.... listen in a way that you can answer her but think of other stuff so that you don't get bothered.... did u ever tell ur bf wat she does??|`|nGhqwEdpaa	Well, I'm going through that with my ex-husbands mom right now..and I understand. She is lonely..period. How is the relationship with you and her bf? Maybe you and her son could talk to her bf and let him know she needs more attention from him etc... I talked to my ex's moms friends and now they take and invite her places more. She's happier now to be away from her house more, and so am I. They weren't aware of how alone she was, everyone is smiling more these days .Good luck to you!!
jZbDOdwjaa	WAS SHE FROM EASTERN EUROPE? THEY SEEM TO LIKE IT THAT WAY. GETTING SLAPPED AROUND AND CHOKED.|`|pVnUhYLQaa	Not wrong. She's a masochist.<br>  <br>  What makes something "wrong"? Who's the victim here?|`|AA10531094	Yeah it's wrong!  What if you got lost in the moment and choked her to death?  I hope you learned from the experience. . . as in not to do it again.  Good Luck!|`|xG6sznSiaa	It's a fetish that can be found in both men and woman. Having someone choke you means you want them to be in control, a form of domination. It is wrong in the long run because excess choking can lead to fatal respiratory problems. I would try not to do this when you are drunk however, since you do not know what you are doing and could easily have strangled her.|`|Likst1Mxaa	If she likes it and you like it then I think it is okay :) You're both consenting adults, some people just get off on weird stuff like that.|`|AA11706291	There is no right or wrong, you either like something or you don't.|`|sr0vZPQqaa	It's dangerous, you may end up killing her.|`|hnCDmgyEaa	NO that's because you have a heart and a mind and you know that you shouldn't put your hands on a women like that so NO your not wrong for feeling awkward about this.|`|dvvQQ6eRaa	That is wrong.

This is dangerous.  She needs to know the risk.|`|4ltupRctaa	noo its kinda normal for some people. thats just how she likes it.. i seen that choking thing on tv.. looked kind of full on!! i wouldnt do it but yes people do.|`|3YiZ63OVaa	very strange|`|XGsuxRR2aa	Wrong is only wrong if you feel it is wrong.<br>  <br>  Choking can be fun, if desired and carefully executed. Depriving the brain of oxygen in controlled amounts can actually result in a euphoric state, combined with orgasm, has the potential to be a very powerful experience. Of course it's dangerous, and if used in excess can lead to extremely dangerous.<br>  <br>  I don't think it's wrong, but some people would, and that's fine with me. I wouldn't encourage people doing it, or do it myself though.|`|zPRvlZcaaa	some people like that during sex some like it really rough bondage rape sceans and so on and yes being strangeled is one of them being chocked is supposed make you climanx a lot harder then normal but its also deadly because most dont know there own streangth more so when there drunk so be very freaking carefull|`|a7fOMAbuaa	Uhh, I had a girlfriend A LONG time ago who enjoyed this. She had this thing about being strangled before we did anything, and then while we were going at it. Very strange, but I gotta admit it had it's moments. =\|`|hhr3A1bSaa	eh some people like that stuff. but always be careful when you do it, because it could get dangerous.|`|AA11563076	Dangerous? - Yes,  Wrong? - That's up to you.|`|Qb7tEPC3aa	that's wrong!And be careful
AA11706291	Maybe not if he's busy as he may get her message read it carry on with what he is doing and forget to reply.|`|yvRrvSyPaa	maybe.. its all up to him really|`|dvvQQ6eRaa	I guess he would.

bFvCI3iZaa	well you could go both ways with this problem she could be hanging around with other guys and stuff and then looking at you to get you to become jealous so she might be playing hard to get or she could just be friendly but be liking someone else but  i doubt that because she keeps on giving signs like saving you a seat,and asking you if its annoying when she say hi if it were me I would talk to her alot and then finnaly go out and ask trust me|`|xarKlp0Oaa	I think that she likes you but also has alot of other guy friends too. Maybe you should talk to her and tell her how you feel and take it from there.|`|M5yDMjlLaa	oppo|`|4gC38fKsaa	nope she doesn't|`|JQZzI49Paa	maybe|`|4I2iOOqIaa	maybe she likes you, but you aren't doing anything,so other guys are going to be around her if you are not.(so if you like her, go talk with her,ask to hang out with her more and be her friend and get to know her more)
AoPcWYvdaa	a. He definitely likes you. You should make a move by giving him a note or my simply telling him you like him. If he really likes you then, you will end up going out.<br>  <br>  b. He likes you. Send him a note saying "do you like me or not?" then have him answer and go from there.|`|AA10558731	I think you're a silly girl who already knows if this guy likes you or not.<br>  <br>  What do YOU think?|`|Uu8iCur8aa	I think he honestly likes your friend more. If he is always giving her hugs, calling her pretty, and inviting her to his place, well thats gotta tell you something right there. Sorry story B but I think A is in the lead|`|KfMuu1s0aa	a. he does like you!!!!<br>  <br>  b.hmmm. i'm not really sure. He might just be a good friend.
mc5WAc7Vaa	I would suggest finding new friends to hang out with<br>  but don't completely ditch your old ones,<br>  you should still talk to them<br>  <br>  but you need to be with people you feel comfortable around|`|2mGE9mgNaa	You can't blame your friends for becoming boring.  Just find some new people who are more like who you want to be.  If the friends you are with at the moment don't accept you for who you are then forget them.  It doesn't sound like you want to be with them so don't feel guilty about being a 'bad friend'.|`|oNkxVdSjaa	i guess they're not your true friends..get yourself a boy friend to pass time..but den again you'll have boyfriend problems..everyone has boyfriend problems. Life...wat can we do about it..<br>  <br>  i'll pray for you hun..<br>  xxx|`|GDPUGcmRaa	get new friends or eat sugar to get hyper.|`|aca3cf96daa4d53db0a6c38aa32047beaa	sorry to be harsh, but your a freaking retarded  One if your not happy then go do what makes you happy. Two they are starting to ignore you and you still care if they get jealous of you having fun. Three you can't take a joke and get all uptight about them joking that you're a whore. So chill out, learn not to take things so seriously, and go have fun. Still hang out with them if they are your friends, but if they're that crazy tell them to shove it cause they're illogical assholes.|`|TUJBZVMCaa	They almost sound like they're jealous of you.  Are you pretty?  Because then they might be insecure about themselves and their personality and looks.  You sound like a really happy go lucky person and they're probably jealous of you're personality and looks.<br>  <br>  If that's not the case, then you just need to get some new friends.  If you don't enjoy hanging out with these people then you can't really call them good friends.  You can still talk to them and all, but definitely try to meet new people.|`|H0sPCJQPaa	Honey you need to just be yourself. Maybe there is somebody there that is exactly like you. Be yourself. and you will eventully find yourself a friend just like you. sounds like they are gay! no offence they sound like mean brats who like anime.:S<br>  <br>  TANK TOPS AND SHORTS DO NOT MAKE YOUR A WHORE!!! that made me mad.|`|HtwhcFdfaa	Find some new friends in addition to the ones you have. That way you can hang out with the laid back ones or have fun with the party friends.|`|EyaqiWPwaa	just go make everyone a sandwich...then they will get up and go out with you ...sandwiches always cure boredom|`|Wy3wddFlaa	do what you want and wear what you want <br>  just be you<br>  if they don't like it then that's there problem|`|iSJ2iCUAaa	I had the same problem. Just go do what you want and if they get all pissed at you tell them that you are just gonna do what you wanna do and it's not fair that you have to be put down by them. When you go to the beach go in your bikini and when they say something just tell them if they have a problem with you being yourself they dont have to "hang out" with you. :) It's tough, but worth it.|`|KzmrWzOJaa	Be yourself. You will get new friends with your own image. Do the things you like to do, even if you are doing them on your own for a while.Things will change, and you will find people you have things in common with, rather than having nothing in common at all. It might take a bit, but you will get through it.|`|FLWuVKWnaa	You really need to make some better friends. They are supposed to care and be Uber fun. If what you do makes them insecure then thats their problem, not yours. You may become a Loner for a while, but someone will befriend you, I promise.|`|qJNevpELaa	I think you should be honest with them, but you could also slowly bow out of their lives and find a new group of friends who accept you for who you are.|`|ACVUcKzCaa	Try to party it up or just make new friends.|`|EgfL2c86aa	get new friends..no, i'm not being sarcastic.|`|JbrJgJGjaa	Suggest them to come hang at your home and don't let them make you feel down! You are what you are inside. Don't be friends then!|`|LETd2hQwaa	You're right, life is too short to be bored. You have to do what makes you happy. Tell your "boring" friends how you feel and suggest that they come along with you for a night of fun. Just don't get too wild the first time you guys go out. If they don't wanna hang out with you in Funville then thats fine too. You are entitled to have more than one set of friends. As far as the way you dress around them for fear that they won't accept you... let them know that this is who you are and if they can't accept that then they can't be real friends because real friends accept each other for who they are. Just tell them everything you just said here and see what they have to say... that's the joy of having friends, you get to choose them, so choose well.|`|QMcuXXrlaa	I don't know, I'd tell them openly how you're feeling... Think of why you hang out with them in the first place. Its your choice, you can hang out with the fun people or not... Try to go with what you want, and try to hurt as little people as possible in the process... Talk to them. Be yourself. You'll probably look back three years from now and see how little this problem was, so don't worry :) Its a good thing that you want to have fun and enjoy life :)
eseLtD9Haa	wow, that really told me what the presence of a woman was like, wow soo beautfiul<3|`|TJiGs8S4aa	Okay, that's very nice.  And your question is?|`|uvOhOUllaa	i love that. it's beautiful, really.|`|DjMTnSxmaa	aaw<br>  i like<br>  <br>  -<br>  Like the moonlit night.<br>  -<br>  Like a poet's dream.|`|hXehbPVqaa	Like a dancing peacock.
NeTNnvSZaa	No, if a dude treats his LADY like a "broad" then she might have little self esteem.|`|kbz5S3waaa	False! If i'm not in the mood, then by all means brother, wack it<br>  <br>  (i just ask to get consulted first)|`|WvOvoxLxaa	False. But if a man has a wonderful woman in front of him, why would he want to watch porn.  I would think he would rather be tapping what was in the flesh and not just watching somebody else.|`|dd2d386096f95b4c9c13d046234f4dddaa	False.<br>  <br>  A woman with self respect and self esteem doesn't get all bent and insecure about nameless women her husband can't have.|`|AdeD0xMuaa	False.|`|AA11193401	false|`|vVka4ZA0aa	Most women don't mind p0rn because it's very common. As long as it's not interrupting the sex life (meaning he still finds her attractive), then it's not an issue.<br>  Some women, though, find it offensive because of a more conservative outlook. Where other women are just insecure about themselves and feel that if their significant other looks at p0rn it means that they are not attractive enough for him anymore.<br>  If you discuss it with your girlfriend/wife, and she doesn't mind you looking at p0rn, then by all means, look at it, just not all the time.<br>  If she doesn't like it, then try to respect her by staying away from it, or hiding it VERY well.<br>  <br>  <br>  So basically, if a woman does NOT already have insecurities, then looking at p0rn will not make her feel like she is not respected or have low self esteem. But if a woman IS insecure, then looking at p0rn will only make those insecurities worse and make her feel less respected, and it will lower her self-esteem.|`|pOCabUMvaa	False, my husband and I look at it together, and it really helps our se* life!!!!<br>  <br>  Some women find it offensive, I guess I would find if offensive also, if he were to watch it on his own, but I just join in on the watching, and pretty soon, we are not watching the movie!!!!<br>  <br>  ((((wink)))), ((((wink)))) :-)|`|LNSiLxlBaa	I read that question from some other woman on here. She's probably the one that has low self esteem while she's running around accusing all the women who don't mind their husbands watching porn. I'm voting for the false here.|`|i1rDJY2aaa	My husband and I look at porn together - it's a huge turn on.<br>  If he ever referred to me as a "broad", or his "old lady" , he would find himself locked out of the house along with his crap.|`|5R9d1U2Iaa	according to Y/A ~ TRUE! <br>  <br>  according to MOI ~ FALSE!!!!|`|JaNE0HKyaa	False he should ask her to look also.|`|88bDvyiwaa	Hey Giorgio, where the heck have you been?|`|130816e5bf662924b68497e6577df429aa	What decade are you living in? We are not broads, we are women.|`|Fi2nUvYcaa	If a dude looks at porn that means that he is a dude like any other dude. However, when it bothers his significant other to the point that she leaves him, then maybe it's time to quit or moderate the porn intake. Trust me when I say that porn can ruin a good relationship! Beautiful women in porn, can make other women insecure about themselves, that much is true. What in the heck you can do about it is anybody's guess.|`|USooqQlWaa	No, not really...that is totally false.<br>  <br>  I look at p0rn with my dude all the time and I am totally confident.<br>  <br>  But this is a good observation as it seems most women are this way.|`|pfisYml0aa	depends on the broad! (told my wife i was going to start calling women broads, and was told that shed kick my @$$!!!....she scares me)
5AFKm191aa	yeah he did, and he probably loved that you kissed him first, it showed that your comfortable around him.|`|1pggu5aSaa	Yep.. he certainly did.

She looks utterly perfect with all her curves.<br>  <br>  It all depends on the girl.|`|bb713fc490338057a5e1c0768ae1fb0baa	i personally dont like dresses/skirts<br>  <br>  but i like dresses that are knee length, form fitting, but allows movement... if that makes sense|`|knNNkPMJaa	i think 10 - 14. im a 6 - 8 myself, but i think bigger is beautiful, unless its all hanging out. size 4- & below is gross,.
gCPu04gTaa	There is a "half-your-age-plus-seven" rule, that gives you a good idea of what would be seen as an appropriate age gap.<br>  <br>  For example:<br>  If you are 15 (the lowest age this works for), your other-half should be between 14.5 and 16.<br>  If you are 20, your other-half should be between 17 and 26.<br>  If you are 50, your other-half should be between 32 and 86.<br>  <br>  Obviously this is just what is considered "normal" in an intimate relationship. You can work it out for yourself using your age.<br>  <br>  If you feel comfortable with the age difference and it is not illegal, eg 15 and a 19 year old, then there is nothing wrong with it. Of you don't have a problem with the age difference then its okay.|`|4ltupRctaa	its ok for adults. when you are 18 you can date whoever you want.. im guessing your young?! please be carefull. when i was 16 i thought imy boyfriend was 19.. turns out he was 28!! there is something very wrong with older men & teenage girls..  VERY wrong.|`|yvRrvSyPaa	it is, age is nothing but a number|`|xcvuJfKMaa	This depends upon your age.  4 years is not a great deal if you are already an adult, however if you are a teen, 4 years can be a huge difference for your parents to accept.  And your parents being 8 years apart has nothing to do with their decision to not allow you to date someone 4 years older.|`|ghbaAWOCaa	depends how old you are at that moment

(But remember there young, so dont go into all the details obviosly.) <br>  I was 6 months when my dad moved out, and from experience i will say this...<br>  -Do NOT talk badly about there father infront of them please. It kills us inside, especially as we get older.<br>  -Let them see there Dad, on a regular basis. (My mom moved across the world, and thats screwed my brother up alot, and me a little.)<br>  -Be civil infront of them, they dont need to hear your fights, or who is at fault.<br>  -LET THEM KNOW THEY DIDNT DO ANYTHING.

I would also ask you to consider getting some support to alleviate your shyness such as hypnotherapy.Also why not try writing down all your positive and negative points..if your negatives outweigh the positives ..you're honest , and if I'm honest, a fully fledged member of the human race.It might be useful to list how you most like spending your free time..if for example you enjoy stuff like photography, reading, music, languages or walking, why not try typing  "meet up group" in your search engine which will take you to a site where you can meet others with similar interests or, you can start your own group - who know, there may be one for people who are shy.|`|05SVYlXBaa	the best way is to accept all invitations to go out with your friends and join clubs.

I know it's hard, your wanting for something bad to happen, because you where in that abusive mess for 2 years, and for those 2 years "waiting on the bad'  to happen, probably happened daily.

Good luck|`|vWPq8nS2aa	From personal experience I understand that its really difficult. But it seems like this guy is really a good guy. He says he'll make time for you and he does.

I hope I helped.|`|n1LWkT0paa	Its hard becasue subconsiously you are expecting him to beat you or harm you often.

Parents like to brag about their children and before you know it they will blubber about everything.<br>  Does he have brothers an or sisters. get to know them. And so my dear you got the whole enchilada...<br>  From your description he seems to be an upstanding guy<br>  Good Luck|`|QP8LdPLeaa	this is WHY its mandatory for women to get out of an abusive relationship and read the warning signs as SOON as possible, because it follows them to the next relationship. you've been with this abusive guy for TWO years? <br>  <br>  i have always heard men complain that they get the cold shoulder just because of some OTHER guy that treated their girlfriend wrong. don't do that to this guy you're dating now, he has NOTHING to do with that jerk you dated. yes hes in the army, yes he teaches students, so yes hes going to be busy alot. <br>  <br>  i think you should have just taken time and relax and try to get over your past relationship instead of just jumping in another one with someone else. but since he seems like a nice guy, don't push him away.

X55EHXeVaa	you asked people to be honest but i think most answers are judgemental and with generalisations that people who regret having children must be either abusers or poor parents.<br>  <br>  life doesn't always turn out like you planned it, i had high hopes for a career and a loving marraige with a man that adored me, in real life i married a mn who i found out married me only for my money and passport and we now exist in a love/hate relationship and we are together for the sake of our kids. My 2 youngest are boys aged 4 and 2, i had 3 caesarean sections and my husband took a job away from home a few days after the last baby, we are both drs and he had just completed his training as a gp and decided he wanted to earn millions thro agency work. Life was really tough, the 4 yr old was quite aggressive and used to wake at 5am every morning and kick me in the belly, i used to be in tears and had enough by breakfast time. <br>  <br>  Now while my husband works away and enjoys his evenings at the cinema or with friends socialising i am stuck at home with the children. He tells me i should go out and get some hobbies then i would be less resentful of him but when am i supposed to do that?At times I feel so worn out and seeped of energy, i have nothing left for myself, my career suffers and i suffer-my hair, face nails and feet are a mess, i ahve just enough energy to get by daily and literally feel as if every day i am drowning in chores etc etc<br>  <br>  I love my kids so much but i feel i am not a good enough parent for them, they deserve better, i wish i had been better prepared for parenthood and marraige.|`|AA12349214	Yes.<br>  I know of some people who had children and their marriage suffered terribly because of it.  The girl particularly was a blooming monster who came between her parents at every available opportunity - but didnt really seem to actually like either of them and was only happy when causing problems.  For their part, parenthood just wasnt what they had thought it would be.  They were both academic and both wanted to keep pursuing their academic goals but couldnt make it work with the children - so in the end no one was happy!  So the answer to your question is - yes!|`|8ac2e5cbdd946ee60c803052559873c5aa	I have never questioned the existence of my son.  I have only questioned my choice for his father.  I reconcile that by the realization that my son wouldn't be here if I hadn't have married his father.<br>  <br>  Life would be different for my son and myself if I had chosen differently.  But I believe that God has ultimate control over life and it is always good.  Becoming a mother changed my life for the better and being a mother gives me a constant reason to get up every morning and do it all again.|`|TepR1rACaa	Yes. My sister regrets having her children as she does not feel she was ready to handle the responsibility. She is now 10 years older and still feels that many great life opportunities were passed by because she had children. <br>  <br>  My aunt also regrets having her child. She quite literally worked night and day to make him happy, He is 30 years old now and still expects her to cater to him. She stopped catering to him years ago and now he wants nothing to do with her.|`|dRj9FoHzaa	Let's face it.  Children are our continuation of life.  They are our replacements.  The only way to achieve immortality is by having children, but by having them we will die at a faster rate.   IMO.|`|ba11546863a841cea0081f35f682a3ccaa	yes..and usually it comes to three things:<br>  1) they are too young to have children<br>  2) they are not planning to have children (accident)<br>  3) financially not stable to have children yet|`|bXmRWbEdaa	Of course.  And sadly, these children are often physically and/or emotionally abused.|`|FasxVeohaa	I think the only ones who regret it is teenagers who are not mature enough to handle it. Also if you are a selfish person and I don't mean that in a bad way either. There are people who like to come and go whether it is to the mall,travel,work etc.. But don't want to be tied down. Some people aren't willing to stop their habits as playing house,shopping,traveling etc, so that is what i mean as selfish. In that case they have the kids and regret that they did because they don't have the freedom to do like they use to or spend as they use to. But if they regret it they should give the  kid up for adoption even if the kids is not a baby their are plenty of people out their that would love to adopt and share everything with a kid. That way also they don't take it out on the kid that they had and don't want any more.|`|VG2X9Ihkaa	I don't regret having kids at all but then again, my children came with the package of my wife... lol... No seriously, I love my kids and I could not live without them.<br>  <br>  But I did know one lady who is a single parent and has a daughter.  She doesn't know how to take care of her daughter (8yrs old) from my personal point of view.  She rather smoke weed then spend time with her daughter.<br>  <br>  She spent more time talking to my wife about her future plans then she ever did with her own mum.  So unfortunately, there are people who just don't realise the level of responsibilities before having children.|`|djUMvICoaa	I think that sometimes people regret having children but don't honestly regret having children.   While there may have been times when it wasn't the easiest for us because of the kids, I can't think of how I could ever regret having them, they are so unique and I know my world wouldn't be the same without them.|`|b7FbWNmlaa	My son was planned and i love him more than anything in the whole world, however - sometimes i just wish i had my old life back, i had more money,sex and sleep, not sure which went first and which i miss the most!! All in varying degrees i guess, also when you are ill, tired, hungover you still have to get up and be mum, so hard some days!!|`|AA10639728	My mom tells me not to have children because this world is a bad place. Maybe some people regret having children because they have to watch them struggle and get hurt, and no one wants to see their children go through pain.|`|ownoc1ZJaa	I think a lot of people should not have children - but unfortunately do.<br>  And I'm sure there is a lot of regret out there.|`|s5N28gsDaa	What do your parents say about this?|`|BkYQh4Yhaa	Some people do...I love my boys and do not know what I would do with out them but there are days that I ask myself where I would be with out them.

KkTJf8kWaa	Most women are good actresses and you may never know the truth.<br>  If you're in a strong relationship then do your best to keep the lines of communication open. Get her to tell you what works for her because all women are different. What works for one girl, may not work on another.<br>  I was in a relationship for a year and she waited till we broke up to tell me that she had been faking most of the time. She thought that she was going to devastate me as a man "instead I laughed" I told her that she had robbed herself of all those orgasms because I would have done whatever she wanted, if only she would have communicated.<br>  If you want to know what it's like, watch the movie "when Harry met Sally" about 35 minutes into the movie, Meg Ryan shows how easy it is for a woman to fake it.|`|qtlzdtMVaa	Well first of all you shouldn't be doing anything or shouldn't know until you can spell ORGASM correctly.

After recovery, I later relapsed, and I  literally didn't go out of the house for months, I lost contact with all of my friends, and the ones who did stay in contact, I made plans with and then bailed all the time til I felt more and more guilty. It's not fun, and I knew I was living such a sad extistance but I didn't know what to do about it until at some point I somehow managed to slowly pull myself together, realising that If I wanted to get anywhere in life, I couldn't continue, and if I wasn't going to let anyone else help me, I needed to help myself! I had my ups and downs of course and it took time, but I made plans with my old friends who were desperate to see me (and may I add, didn't actually know I'd relapsed) and the thought of going out for the first time after so long was terrifying.<br>  <br>  I had no idea how to act, or what I would say and I was scared I'd regret it afterward; I thought they'd ask me lots of questions and get angry, or even dispose of me as a friend completely! (I felt like I didn't have friends anymore either) But you know what? I went out there, and afterward I just couldn't understand what on earth I'd ever been worried about; it was fine, just like old times! Geeky people are great; I'm a geeky person and so are my friends, and they're often the most genuine friends you'll find; I assure you they wouldn't care if you just fallen into a pigsty, gotten a black eye and landed in a wheelbarrow covered in wet superglue; they'd push you around in it just to hang out with you; ok so it's a bad analogy, but what I mean is they're not there to judge or be insensitive with you about anything. They just miss you and want to spend time with you again! To have friends like that, is something to be so thankful for and they don't deserve to be taken for-granted.<br>  <br>  Perhaps it would be a good idea to also query why you've been feeling this way. Worrying about things like weight is often used as an emotional smoke screen, to avoid dealing with the real underlying problem that's bugging you; perhaps you have a touch of depression or anxiety as well. If these feelings and attitudes persist, please do get help. There are plenty of books, therapists, homeopaths, doctors, etc. that can help with such things. If you can, try and make sure you confide in at least one friend or family member. It helps tremendously.<br>  <br>  Please believe me though, you'll feel so much better about yourself when you start having your friends around you again; after all, that's what friends are for. I still have days where I prefer my solitude and worry even now, but I make sure I regularly socialise and see my friends, as it's the best confidence booster, and it feels so much better laughing in company than laughing (or more often crying, sulking, wallowing) alone.<br>  <br>  I hope that's some insight and helps somewhat. I wish you the best of luck; you have my total confidence. <br>  <br>  Please take care :)

Us2bzL7Raa	awwww. well since u added her on facebook then its even more of a perfect chance. just do it. just say a simple hi or hey or something. then strike up a convo. if u talk to her shell no ur interested then shes gonna get interested in u too. and who knows what would happen after that lol. but if u dont then ur gonna always wonder what wouldve happened. soo jusst talk to her. its better than not doing anything at all. so cmon what do u got to lose? =] good luck and hope i helped|`|hEcKmleVaa	If she accepts your friend request, go for it.  All you need to say is:  I enjoyed meeting you the other night.  I know I was pretty quiet, but would like to get to know you.........If that doesn't get her attention, nuthin' will!  What do you have to lose?|`|Te9odBWCaa	Well, if she was trying to catch your eye that night by looking at you for a few seconds without other people noticing, then she more than likely wanted to be alone with you. Or, she could be used to attention and was wondering why you were the only one not giving it to her. Either way, she is now probably interested in you. You should have more confidence in yourself, because as a girl myself, I like a guy who is blunt and fun-loving. Also, once again as a girl myself, girls tend to be attracted to guys that seem unattracted to them. So give her a compliment and start a conversation from there.|`|oOD3dYaNaa	It's alright. Don't beat yourself up over it. Just make sure you make the first move!! She's obviously interested based on what you've told me. So I'm sure she wouldn't mind you making the first move at all. =]<br>  <br>  She won't think you're weird, I promise. Just write something like "Hey! What's up?" or say that to her when you see her. She's probably just looking because she's shy. So, you're going to need to give her a little nudge by making the first move. =]<br>  <br>  I know it is nerve wracking, but think of the positives that the first move could lead to versus the negatives. And most people respond very well to people making the first move. <br>  <br>  Just go up to her and say "Hey! What's up?" Even saying that could be the start of something amazing. <br>  And what's the worst that she could say? No? What human being says no to another saying hello? LOL <br>  <br>  But anyway, then just keep the conversation going from there. Ask her questions that don't have a yes or no answer, because that'll keep her talking to you. Like "So how's your day?" and stuff like that. She'll think you're nice and sweet. And you'll definitely have her attention. =]|`|giFaS1qDaa	just say hey and be yaself ask her whhat she's been up to tell her you saw her at bowling and how good she was that'll hint that you like her but only in the slightest way juss be nice and listen arrange to meet up make yourself into thinking u don't like her it makes it so much easier for me to talk to someone I don't like If I make myself think I don't like him|`|4O1wAwayaa	Goodness, I get tired of answering these - Open your mouth and just say hello. We girls are human beings too. We'll probably be more embarrassed than you.<br>  <br>  Funny how people can say mean stuff without thinking twice, but a compliment has to be dragged out with a team of wild horses...|`|No4p9AYjaa	i'm sure if she liked the look of you she will talk to you about anything. you got over the first hill by getting her to add you on facebook. well done <br>  good luck|`|HVTONOSnaa	one. I wouldn't take anything by her "looking at you" that is a very sketchy thing.. <br>  two. to start a conversation on facebook I would suggest to go online and when ever she comes on line chat with her..|`|9Q07kREJaa	start up a regular convosation with her so that way she won't feel that you are ignoring her|`|NOYvRabiaa	ouch!<br>  well i think you should messange her and say i think i saw you before...at the bowling alley (whatever night it was).  and she will respond back. then introduce yourself...and start getting to know her.<br>  i know this will work b/c guys i dont no but saw before do this to me all the time when they don't speak to me when im out in public and miss the perfect chance..but the always write me a message that night.<br>  so hurry up before it gets to late and she doesn't remember you.<br>  good luck|`|RDIGrQoKaa	Send her a flirty message on FB. Like, "So pretty sure we dominated you guys in bowling last night." or something like "Last night was fun. We should definetly do it again soon." or something like that. That shows that your interested in talking to her.<br>  <br>  How do I know this? I met my current boyfriend at a football game. That night he added me on facebook and left a comment saying "Hey! It was nice meeting you tonight!" And the convo continued on from there! Something like that isn't creepy and it's a friendly way of starting the conversation. <br>  <br>  Hope this helps! Good Luck!|`|XKoVjG2kaa	well if she was staring at you a couple of times then that ment she liked you and that she wanted you to talk to her . so you should of just went to talk to her while she was waiting till it was her turn to bowl but now i think the best thing to do is to talk to her more on facebook and ask her if shes single and if she says yea say o ok well i was wondering if you wanted to go out and then tell her you tried to ask her at the bowling alley but she as distracted . so go ahead and then from there yall can meet .... <br>  <br>  hope this worked =] contact me if you need to|`|6h0eCVwpaa	Who says that was the perfect chance??? I mean maybe it was not meant for you two to talk that night. Anyway when she was looking at you maybe it was because she saw you staring at her before and maybe she likes you. Now about facebook ....just say hi or what's up or something like that. If she just says yes, no, ok or thanks then maybe she's not really interested(although you never know, she's maybe shy) But if she asks you something and it seems like she wants to talk then i guess she likes you. Just start talking to her and see what happens<br>  <br>  PS Be "the funny cute guy" you know...make her laugh and be sweet :) Girls fall for that<br>  <br>  Hope i helped and good luck :)|`|NgawN7Pcaa	well since you added her on facebook, you got better chances.<br>  write on her wall and be like "hey how was bowling lol it was good seeing you" or something like that.

Also is there a chance of anything happening between this guy and either of you? If its not likely to happen then don't put your friendship in jeopardy over a crush. Just talk to your friend about it and try to work out an agreement about the guy. For example since both of you like him the fair thing to do (and what i would do) would probably be to agree that neither of you date him for the sake of your friendship....In the end whatever you decide to do just make sure it makes you happy|`|WOSYsAonaa	you are best friends for a reason and this situations really makes it show!

Just be vague about the subject if you are ever asked, and when you want to have sex with a guy you can tell him after you do.  The guy won't mind that he was your first, most are probably just hesitant to go any further because they think that if you are still a virgin, you won't have sex, so if you have sex with him and then tell him, its good because he'll know you aren't a slut but he'll still get laid.  Make sure you like the guy a lot though because you don't want to lose it to a random guy just to lose it.|`|RkPDhEuLaa	you are not gross if you are a virgin... for me, that basically puts you on top of the list. if you constantly rub it in peoples face that you dont want sex and maybe wear ankle long skirts with a bun constantly - yeah i could see guys turning their heads.|`|sr0vZPQqaa	They're just saying that as a nice excuse not to go out with you, guys don't mind an innocent girl so there is another reason they are not going out with you.

If you answered yes to LDR, this possibility is the STRONGEST. Perhaps you'd ignored him unconsciously? this is the frequent thing that most of the couples do.<br>  <br>  Or had you did something wrong? Or were you in a quarrel before he turns weird?<br>  <br>  the second is... well, not intending to offend you,  this is just a GUESS as it's well Split, it's just a guess.<br>  <br>  He might have someone who he treasures more than you now, perhaps this is the main cause.<br>  He ignores you in order to ended up all of the memories and starts making one with the new girl.<br>  <br>  But these are just some guesses of mine, you are the one who knows his personality more than anyone.<br>  <br>  But if you want to know the truth, you may ask one of his closest friends, to ask him about it. but remember, don't shoot it on spot, or I mean to the point, because he might know your plan and declined to answer. a good way to ask is in courtesy(ask his friend to say such as a light greeting when he met him, then talk more about his life, by asking 'How's life', then ask him to choose any topics that they usually talk about and finally, after there appeared the best timing, shoot is on spot by asking 'How's your GF?' and so on. remember one thing; do not include any force to answer. just ask him to ask your bf as usual, as the way they comfort each other, or discuss their issues.|`|Likst1Mxaa	maybe he just wants space.<br>  <br>  maybe he wants out of the relationship and can't be bothered dealing with it.<br>  <br>  maybe it isn't all about you.

He may just not have the energy yet to give to a relationship and texting is "easy."  Ask him to tell you honestly how he's feeling (physically) and could he be depressed?  Calmly explain that texting is fine, but you need face-to-face time as well.  He sounds withdrawn, but the reasons why are unclear.  Tell him that.

Once again, wow!<br>  I know how you feel from the perspective of the quiet little neighborhood.  My own used to be like that... until teenagers (not like myself)  moved in.   From there it was wild pot parties, alchohol, and lots of illegal activities.  <br>  Honestly, the situation with your neighbor just sounds illegal.  Living around the things that I do,  I would say that the lil ol ladies are smoking marijuana, as well as growing their own in the garden.

You can request that the caller remain anonymous, or when you call in simply dont give any identifying information about yourself such as you live next door, your name etc.  If you remain anonymous, the problem can simply be solved without much fuss.  Seriously, what is a little old lady going to do with a knitting needle if she is high?

And then, your front lawn'll die....<br>  <br>  I read that in a book, so it must be true.....|`|e8a42257dd2b34817d2020222ee63839aa	What are they sewing?  Wild oats?|`|YUAegpPoaa	I would be concerned about her becoming reclusive. Sometimes older folks make excuses for that behavior which could seem a little like paranoia. Unless she is Jewish I'm not sure what her issue is with pork though.<br>  <br>  If you haven't already I would limit the favors you do for her, like dropping things off at the post office or running things by her friend's houses, so that she will get out more and interact with more people.<br>  <br>  I wouldn't be too concerned about the allergy symptoms or the smell; spring is rough on may people with the pollen and mold and old people's houses just smell funny.|`|PAA4uWPuaa	Cozies for Bongs!!<br>  I am sure they are just trying to supplement their income and they need to test out their products before selling them.|`|8b006ad2547d67b6ee6de41af44054b9aa	Take up sewing and join the circle. You won't regret it !|`|fyKydb6Iaa	Good story, Have you ever tried writing a book, Fiction sells well|`|8e5366e765c8313efe9053e58aec2eeeaa	Get some neighbors together for a betting pool, and tape a line across the street about 50 yards from the door. Take photos of all the little old ladies one Thursday (use a telephoto lens as you need to ensure secrecy). Then take bets on which one of the LOL's will cross the finish line first. Next Thursday tie some fishing line to a bag of cheetos, have a stout fellow with the fishing rod on the other side of the finish line. Place the bag of cheetos on the porch, ring the doorbell and run. When the door opens start reeling in the cheetos - and watch those Mary Janes dance out the doorway. Keep reeling until one of them crosses the finish line. Pay out the cash to the winner, and crack open the Cheetos! Fun for all!
AA12349214	Tell him that you had fallen for him and finding out that he had been lying hurt you and thats why you responded the way you did.  You can then but say you are sorry and hope that he forgives you.  If he doesnt - lesson learned.  It never pays to lose your temper and say things you know you are going to regret afterwards.<br>  Honesty.  Its your only option now.
4T9fZzITaa	ohh yes. our stories are quite different. i left my ex.. i was with him for over two years. i left him for sooo many reasons. [he was jealous, thought way too differently, complained about dumb things, ddnt like any of my friends, argued too much and he was pushy etc etc etc] i just dealt with it cuz i loved him that much. for me it didn take that long to get over him.. pretty much when i broke up with him. for him id say it proly was about 3 months. [i heard he was seeing my best friend's best friend] but idk if they were dating.. anyway i think its true what they say.. you don't get truly over him til you find someone else. thats how i was able to be so ok .. i found someone else. well more like i left my ex for this guy. the time to get over someone varies with pple really. why don't you try to hang out with him  [dont mention that you would like to get back with him] just as friends and keep that up in time you'll see if he shows signs if he still has feelings for you. but if he doesnt seem interested enuf to go back with you and isnt willing to work it out then just keep hanging out with your gfs. they can keep you preoccupied. distract yourself. and in time your pain will ease trust me. and think of the brighter side.. you can do things he proly wasn't ok with you doing. meet new pple if you want. best of luck.|`|AA11969208	it will take you more then one month to forget him, even after a couple of years when you will see him you will feel something inside. try to hold on, it will get better one day but not now... one day you will look back and smile when you remember all this.... because by that time you will find already your true love|`|P5GhUEvoaa	Yeah I've been like this.But when I love other guy I will start not to think of him.It took me about more than a year to somehow not to think of him too much though.|`|36PrVK7Oaa	Yes.|`|qxJ4KauPaa	i'm still with my bf right now but he wanted to take some time off with me. even though we didn't break up yet, i still understand ur feelings. it's been so lonely. i can't seem to forget him. whenever i'm alone, i feel like calling him n want to meet up with him.<br>  <br>  i tried my best to avoid this feelings by hanging out with my girlfriends. but i still can't seem to get him out of my mind. i guess, the more i try to push him away, the more strong he stays in my head. so i just let it be. i didn't force myself. it still hurt though. but i do find myself occasionally forgot about him.|`|jdV5o8NMaa	A general rule of thumb that I have read when I went through this is half that you had feelings for them.
bb713fc490338057a5e1c0768ae1fb0baa	dont give it to her. if you do she wont regret breaking it off with you. it's a sweet thing, but it wont help your case any. just give it time... if you guys are really close, she might give you a chance.|`|bSiKrblGaa	Just.. move on.

Save it and give it to the next one that comes along. But make sure that you have dated more that 3.5 months|`|NGBP65luaa	its really really sweet and it would flatter her but if she broke it off with u then she doesnt feel the same way. Save ur poems for someone who will have mutual feelings for u. She will love it but it wont change how she feels so maybe you should save it for someone who will feel the same as u. U seem reli nice though and im sorry she doesnt feel like that about u.|`|foRjMCd8aa	I think you should wait a month or two.<br>  Once you guys start to become even closer.<br>  Then, one day out of the blue when it's just you guys, give it to her.<br>  She'll possibly love you after that.<br>  And, if she has a myspace, she can put it up in a scroll box or whatever if she wants.<br>  That's adorable.<br>  :)|`|1pggu5aSaa	Aww.. that's so adorable!

SxqYguUCaa	Well, if she's being a backstabber, why are your other friends being HER friend? Tell Emily to stand up to her on your defense. If she doesn't shut up, then ditch all the girls. If no one is willing to stand up against her for you, then who needs friends like that?|`|IdY8lmMfaa	ignore the ***** give ha the sielent treatment ya kno <br>  screw isabella|`|ZMxgHl4xaa	There is the possibility that Emily is lying. You should try to find a way to confront her about what she said. This sounds like an important alliance. It needs to be clearly understood.
5QbDnnWMaa	Tell her you love her. <br>  But give her ur reasons.<br>  (Shes pretty and Intelligent,,, not fit! that's stupid!)|`|AA11447210	Wait 3 yrs when you're both old enough to date...and actually drive somewhere instead of having to be taken.<br>  <br>  Good luck! ?|`|RD0yaJlgaa	Plan a simple date, I know you don't want a very expensive date. Just take her to a place where you have a privacy and talk to her.<br>  Never ask her to have sex, you guys are too young.|`|f1006988bdbdd7ae5e5276623f046308aa	Can you just ask her to hang out together without a bunch of other friends around. Maybe get together at a park or some place. Just do some simple things together. Her parents may not allow her to really date at her age, but that does not me you 2 can not just try to be alone together just a little more often, and see how it all goes from there. Mostly just try to relax.|`|eIWhpSt0aa	make sure that your alone without any of her friends there. Its just you and her, then you say whatever u wanna say to ask her out. then she'll answer. i hope it works....BUT MAKE SURE YOU ARE ALONE!|`|rNmekxLcaa	There is nothing wrong with two 13 year olds hanging  out, just don't put your hands down her pants.|`|c4qZRoQgaa	just ask if she wants to "go out sometime"<br>  if you say hang out it will be more like friends.<br>  just go to the movies or something if she says yes.<br>  good luck!<br>  [=|`|d0WQ2pZNaa	let her know that you don't want, what you're about to tell her to ruin your friendship if that's the way it turns out, then straight out tell her that you've started to like her more than a friend, and if she is too you'd love to take her out.<br>  <br>  It doesn't have to be along those lines, but something like it.<br>  Guys worry that they are going to sound to mushy and scared and that the girl is going to laugh at them because they're being open about their feelings. The majority of girls absolutely LOVE it when a guy is 100% honest with them and tells them how they feel. The ones that don't are generally girls with pretty much more testosterone than most guys!!|`|4wJVc8L2aa	you know if you like her then ask her out.<br>  dont waste your time trust me! ive been there and it didnt turn out right! <br>  the boy i liked ended up going out with someone else :( <br>  and trust me it WASNT a nice feeling seeing them two together nearly everyday! <br>  i think you should just ask her out.!|`|CdZK7XjOaa	Maybe you should just keep with the conversation until she feels that she really likes you. If she already does then just go up to her and say "Hey do you wanna hang out sometimes?" Well that's what i would do. <br>  <br>  Good Luck!|`|XK0sOxbzaa	ok, at 13, going out is just holding hands and spending time together. its not really going out on a date or anything. ok. so, its not a big deal. just ask her out. its very easy. just tell her that you like her.|`|Zyy7isCeaa	Easiest way is to just come out and ask, if she says no then she will probably think that it's sweet that you're thinking of her.|`|WjkiAzcDaa	Your gunna hate everyone for saying this but you should wait. If you can definately see that she likes you just go for it if your not sure just wait trust me.
TCqrS8Vqaa	hiya, if its not working out between you,then split.it will be worse later on.|`|C7KzBGlDaa	It could go both ways.<br>  <br>  It could heal your heart like that! <br>  and everything could be great.<br>  <br>  or<br>  <br>  if you're just not happy, its not fair<br>  to him, to even pretend to be. & do<br>  you think its fair to be dating your ex's<br>  best friend, thats another factor. <br>  <br>  Your heart has to be telling you something.<br>  follow it ?|`|kYpcrJGSaa	l think so.|`|gCPu04gTaa	"the thing is I'm on a downer now... this always happens when I'm in a relationship my heart hurts and so I'm guessing I'm just not ready"<br>  <br>  That really doesn't sound too good. It seems you do things just to please others. He may be really nice and treat you well, but he is not making you happy. <br>  <br>  Did you not know that a boy and a girl can just be friends? Perhaps you should tell him you are not ready, and after all you did just break up with his BESTFRIEND. If he made you happy when you were friends then why change things? Go back to how things were and should be on an up.<br>  <br>  Sorry if I sound a bit sarcastic, but do whats best for YOU. If he does like you then he should understand that you need time to get over hte bad relationships you've had.
zzaScg0haa	Why not do things you are interested in and try meeting girls at those activities, if your not into clubs and bars the girls you meet there will never be right for you
WKAqqYXEaa	I would date him, all of us have a run of bad luck in relationships. <br>  And the past is the past<br>  <br>  <br>  If you like him give him a chance.|`|UdatjYEQaa	this guy seems insecure and unsure about what he wants.<br>  ever wondered if he's gay?<br>  perhaps?<br>  <br>  don't date him.<br>  he'd be way to confusing.<br>  and you may be to mature for him.|`|dB2cGBD0aa	Dont see anything wrong in that, you can train him exactly how ud like then too!!!|`|pFz3pc5maa	there must be some reason why nobody wants him....|`|RXKGSNtqaa	It's fine. I would date him :D|`|orGvWwhBaa	Yes. I like men with experience !|`|V20PTwMmaa	no|`|wV3Fs9Ebaa	ya<br>  so its better to be the first, special<br>  lol<br>  it wuld be wrong to not go out with a guy just cause he never went out wit anyone<br>  i am curently in a 1 year relationship with my bf and im his first gf|`|3Y7RJu3taa	If you like him enough it shouldn't be an issue.  I however would be put off by that.  When you are considering a relationship, you need to think about what you can live without.  I for one, love guys who are kind of sexually aggressive, bold and hands on.  I know that someone who has never had a first kiss can't very well be that type of person, so I would probably look elsewhere.  But not everyone is like that so you have to think about it yourself and see if it is something that bothers you.|`|0AXgXFpraa	no thats prefectly fine !!<br>  answer mine ??<br>  <a href="http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;_ylt=AmqR4kxcfd9khY4ToYz6ioPsy6IX;_ylv=3?qid=20090307054336AA95gRs">http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;...</a>|`|U4ek1lCLaa	It'll probably be over soon but at least he can say he had a girlfriend but sometimes they become crazy if you break up with them and that gets weird so proceed with caution.|`|JC7If6Naaa	no at all >> its good to be the first gf in his life >> good luck
S4VVE0onaa	going out should be for the fun of being with friends not looking for a date<br>  <br>  your better off meeting a girl some other place like clubs and societies that you are interested in.
lMR4PpATaa	Sounds like PMS.  Or, you're just very judgmental and arrogant.  Next time, invite some of your friends to your pity party.  Misery loves company.|`|xwtpvK9maa	Typical teenagers' life. Seriously. We all have been there. My mom and dad were waaay bossier than yours. Trust me. But mine love me, and yours love you. You don't like you family, but you love them. You know whatever they say is "for you own good." How many times have you heard that one? LOL. <br>  Tell your mom that your dad cannot hit you, if she disagrees, you need to tell someone else, a teacher or someone. because "scars" are not acceptable. <br>  Talk to your parents calmly and understandingly if they could maybe let you take a break. <br>  Try talking to a guidence counsler about your problems.<br>  Hope it all works out.<br>  x?x?|`|iblT1HJpaa	Are you ready for the truth? <br>  This will be one of the hardest things you'll do.........<br>  you need to look really deep inside and see "what is the truth and what is a lie." <br>  If someone tells you that "you are stupid and ugly and worthless" - is this a lie or the truth? <br>  If it is a lie - what do you care? It's a lie and is not worth anything. It tells you the character of the person that said it. If they are trying to "get you" and you fall for it - it just shows your own lacking character. Listen up! It was a lie! It means nothing. You can listen to it, but it's not for you to EMBRACE it! <br>  On the other hand - is what they say the truth? It matters not from where it comes - this is about YOU! Is it the truth? Any part of it? If it is, then you have to show some kind of maturity and accept it for the truth and see where you can be better at whatever.............<br>  This is where you, as a child, (sorry) have not the faculty as yet to embrace WHO you really are and stand on that as stone. <br>  You are being twised in the wind for you do not yet know who you really are yet. Your hormones are humming, you are on the threshold of independance and crave it, yet you do not have a job that can support you and you have other responsibilites as a child. Know that you will be a "child" until, oh, 25 or so. Most women do not have a full grasp of themselves until about 29 so you've got a long way to go. <br>  Know that your parents love you but they can't deal with the disrespect that comes out of your mouth. They are just weak and insecure and their only recourse is to "fight back". This is not right. It's just the way it is. Most parents do not know how to be parents and each day is a new thing to find out something they do not know. You are a test in progress. Allow them to love you the way they always wanted too. It's not about YOU! This is about them and their ignorance of how to deal with you. <br>  Your grades are of importance, but what does that do for your parents? <br>  Nothing. They are for your benefit and yours alone. What you do today will be your future tomorrow. <br>  Advice? Get two books and learn from them. Give them to your parents so they will learn.|`|kJ7YFQiEaa	Dang girl that sucks.<br>  is talking with them an option?<br>  i would hate to live there.<br>  I couldnt survived not going anywhere on the weekends. that would suck big time. i feel bad for you. :[|`|d30f07a15879f4c7bb74b100b34135afaa	Spoiled brat!|`|f8CN2qIvaa	Leave home when you're finished school.  It may seem like you're in prison at the moment, but the next few years will go by very quickly.  There's not much you can do about your parents, but you can tell your siblings to mind their own business.  For now, spend your time thinking about what you want to do when you're out of school.  With your grades, you should be able to get into any college or university you want.|`|4QoHrLfqaa	Your family is so shitt|`|ogF1pwtRaa	Sit down with your family and tell them exactly how you feel, it can't be all that bad if you do it.<br>  Or if you don't fancy taking that approach, you can always talk to a teacher at you school or maybe a close friend.<br>  Good luck (:
OZHEkcGEaa	i would tell them 2 get lost or talk 2 them first, plus if he really love u he wouldnt say 2 go away :(
faOBk7qtaa	Relationship is "on and off" for 5 years and you are engaged? That is your first problem.<br>  <br>  Second, the reason someone wants to marry someone is to make them apart of their lives, and for him to keep you away from your family says a lot.|`|RjpGomsyaa	If he doesn't include you perhaps he doesn't want a family life, are you sure you want to marry someone like that?|`|AA11139702	UHH yea!  Maybe they thought is was understood that you come.|`|85vDqn6naa	Yes, there is definitely something wrong after 5 years, even if it is not consistent. Seems he just wants his milk for free, if you get my drift. no disrespect|`|58624ad5fd2dd57e6a4e665efe1fee92aa	Yep! That's absolutely not normal for someone who wants to have a family.|`|UT2tv5N3aa	maybe he thinks its easier on his boy not to confuse him
dyZ6XtEVaa	get a dog|`|jdRKZe18aa	Well at lst glance it sounds like a terribly insensitive thoughtless thing to do - UNLESS the son & parents & grandparents have some ISSUE with you.  But even then - it needs to be discussed openly, addressed and taken care of or it might just ruin your relationship and any forthcoming marriage!<br>  <br>  Should have been no excuse to not INCLUDE you in the birthday party unless the exwife was there maybe....  but then just MAYBE.  If you are to be his WIFE you need to have some serious discussion here and settle this.|`|NeTNnvSZaa	Um yeah there's something wrong with that.  He's going to marry you so you should be getting aquainted with this child.  He may be hiding a secret, like he's a bad parent or his kid has issues that will become a problem in the future.  You need to call off this engagement if he doesn't include you, it's not a good sign.|`|SHARt1k3aa	Yes, there is something very wrong with that.  I would be totally hurt.  But, it may stem from being "on and off again." Maybe he only wants you to become close to him once he feels in "on" for good.  That's mean though, I would be really hurt.  Have you asked why?  Why he doesn't include you?  That you are important part of his life and so is his son, so why the distance?|`|MmfMJq9Paa	Yes Sweety, There is something VERY Wrong with that situation, you should be with the both of them or all of them at any given time. NEVER should you take Second Best, EVER....  You need to step away from the bubble and look at the situation from an outsiders view, and adjust whats going on within your mind.I don't know you, but I do know that this is not good ground to start a future with your boyfirend. Don't marry him, you will always be second best... He has already established this behavior. take such care! I hope for yourself to see this in a different sight....|`|yd2SP7d6aa	Yep.  I'm uncertain if I would marry a person with children but if I was considering it this would be warning sign.|`|AA10911598	Yes it was wrong for him to exclude you from this family event.|`|RC6Dn6zoaa	YES!!  OMG ,girl how can you marry him? I really want to know...Dont you understand that his son is the #1.most important person in his life..why wouldnt he want his long time girlfriend to meet his son? Whether he has custody of his son or not, 5yrs is too long for you NOT to have had some kind of bond with his son. I do respect people for not wanting their kid around when they are dating off and on different people, but with your situation it's not the same. you need to figure out what the REAL reason for him not wanting you around and honey it ant cause he's overprotective no more!!

I1w0HfQbaa	Women are the more crueler and nastier when it comes to the break-up than men. You women are soooo cruel you should be renamed Cruella Deville when it comes to the break-ups. When my girlfriend broke up with me I cried, cried, cried like a little b***h all night long!! I remember the day she broke up with me I was staying up late night watching my classic boxing DVDs of Buster Douglas and eating away at a nice, delicious and hearty Mexican meal--tears rolling down my eyes onto the melted cheese of my beefy tostada.

rHuAhN3iaa	You need to do a combination of ab work and cardio. I do the ab work every other day and the cardio five days a week. <br>  <br>  I do these three ab exercises: <br>  <br>  Bicycle crunches:<br>  1. Lie on your back bring your left knee towards your right elbow then do the opposite, move in a rhythmic fashion and do about 15-25 of them. <br>  <br>  Then I switch to Hundreds, which is a pilates move: Lie on your back and go into a crunch position with your arms extended straight out beside your body. Hold the crunch position while counting to one hundred while bouncing your arms lightly at your sides. <br>  <br>  Finally I finish with a plank pose: Balance on your elbows and toes (its almost like doing a push position but you rest on your arms instead). Make sure you keep your back in good alignment (completely straight). Hold the pose for 30-60 seconds. <br>  <br>  Then I go back to the first ab exercise and do all three again.<br>  <br>  Finally, cardio work is the most important part of weight loss so you need to incorporate some type of cardio to the workout. <br>  <br>  You can decide what you like best. I prefer using an elyptical machine, but when I can't get to gym, I run eight flights of stairs at home as a substitute. You can also ride your bike, go for a walk or a jog or run on the treadmill.<br>  <br>  I would cut out pop and junk food as much as possible. I avoid fast food as much as possible as well and drink lots of water. I also snack on fruits and veggies instead of chips, chocolate or popcorn. And it may sound weird but skipping breakfast is a really bad idea, even if you just have a cup of yogurt, it gets your metabolism going.<br>  <br>  I started my routine about four weeks before I went on holidays and shed ten pounds and I felt really good too. Now I just do it to maintain my body weight and shape.<br>  <br>  Good luck and congrats.|`|0AShsMsoaa	no soda no alcohol no bread no sweets no fast food.  <br>  <br>  no eating after 7pm  dont go to bed right after eating.  <br>  <br>  walk whenever possible.  <br>  <br>  if you possibly can, swim.  <br>  <br>  dont do anything drastic 3 weeks or less before your wedding.  everything i have listed is fine, pills, drugs, ect are not.|`|QFf9phAmaa	you start running in the park and also start crying that you are getting married.|`|nxeQFPEfaa	**please read this** It looks long but I PROMISE it works!!<br>  <br>  You are going to be so busy so, I am not even gonna suggest going to the gym. Only things that you can do in a few minutes that will help.<br>  <br>  If you have a treadmill this is a plus...<br>  I have one and got on it it for 5 minutes every hour that I was home and awake. If you don't have a treadmill you can still do the same thing but jog in place for 5 minutes every hour that you are home and awake.<br>  <br>  Every time you watch a tv show and it goes to commercial do situps! Only during the commercials. Then the next commercials attempt to do push ups [[have your arms looking great!]] during the commercial. When I first started this, I could do like 2 pushups, now I can do like 50. Alternate these two betweeen commercials.<br>  <br>  Drinks only water. Its not hard at all, it makes me feel full so I don't eat as much, it will do wonders for your skin as well.<br>  <br>  Make sure you eat a good breakfast every day. It will be the essential key to making your day go better.<br>  <br>  Starting now: eat whatever you normally eat but ONLY EAT HALF THE PLATE!!!! <br>  <br>  Starting next week: eat 1/2 your meal like the week before but replace your lunch with a special K bar. [[it will keep you held over until dinner and you should have had your power breakfast! so you won't be starving]]<br>  <br>  The Last week: eat only grilled chicken,fish,veggies and fruits fat free yogurts. That's it. The combination of nervousness, stress, eating this will help you lose those extra few pounds, I promise! The reason for starting only one week prior is because with all that you have going on you are going to cheat because of convenience, that is whay you may have what you like but only eat half. The last week is when you really need to buckle down. I followed this EXACT format for a weight loss challenge that me and my family had and i did this exact method in the last three weeks out of the 4 week challenge and won losing 12 lbs. in about 3 weeks. Good luck!!|`|RuKK1LYiaa	you really should have started dieting earlier and you really dont want to do it withint three weeks of your wedding cause you will more  than likely have to alter your dress. i dont get why all of you women think you have to diet and become thinner for one day, your fiance doesnt care how much you weigh obviously. but if your serious drink water and eat as little carbs as possible and go for a jog in the morning, dont eat or drink anything 2 hours before bed time as well.|`|tvUAO4ioaa	Don't drink anything but water, it helps flush your system and is calorie free.|`|twMOCaUAaa	The carbohydrate chains in raw potatoes are rather long compared to their cooked counterparts.<br>  <br>  The longer chains require more work to digest than the smaller ones. In turn requiring more energy from your body. <br>  <br>  Based on your body chemistry, you _should_ lose weight eating raw potatoes as snacks.

xcvuJfKMaa	Most guys love when they are the first at anything with a girl.  Whether someone continues to like you, is usually not based on a kiss.  If you do not hear from him, oh well, his loss.  But as well, after the kiss, he could have been just as shy as you, which could be why everything became silent.|`|6h0eCVwpaa	I agree with the first answer it is possible but i don't think that's the reason he doesn't call. I think guys usally call after a few days. but i think that he is shy and worried too,and maybe you should call him after a few days if he doesn't call. If he ignores you he's a jerk and you're too good for him, he just used you and doesn't know what he wants. He's not the last one But i think everything will be ok...<br>  <br>  hope i helped :)|`|NgawN7Pcaa	lol just give him a little while .<br>  and if he is turned off by it, thennnn that tells you something right there.<br>  <br>  and btw - i know this is completely random , but your name is adorable lol :) thats my ex boyfriends name .|`|4ltupRctaa	it really depends on the person. some people believe everything they need to know about the person you can tell from a kiss..lol  im one of them. there is no way in a million years id call back a bad kisser!! sorry..|`|dvvQQ6eRaa	No he shouldn't be put off by one kiss.

84IdrMqsaa	A week....when I actually have my period.<br>  <br>  My boyfriend doesn't usually ask, he'll just put his hand down my jeans without warning or in my underwear as we lay in bed. So excuses are useless.<br>  <br>  But. Now i just tell him if I'm not "at my tidiest" in that area, he actually doesn't care, he just shrugged and then asked if it bothered me enough for us not to have sex. I was only scared it would bother him.<br>  <br>  So I just make sure I'm decent as much as possible, other than that, it doesnt bother me at all. He finds me beautiful however I am.<br>  <br>  So maybe just talk to him? If not, he'll start worrying you don't want him.

UfhE3k1baa	My husband is my best friend in a lot of ways. I am closer to him then anyone in the world and he knows everything about me. We have been together for almost 9 years, we started dating when I was 14, so we grew up together in a lot of ways. But I feel it is important to have someone I am close to outside of him, because there are times when I am mad at him, and need to vent. It would not be nice of me to expect him to listen to me rant and rave about him after all. It also helps clear my head so when I do go to him about our problem it is more logical instead of anger driven. Also, he doesn't want to talk about girl stuff all the time. <br>  <br>  As for manipulation, I think that is a very bad word for what you are trying to get across. No one can be logical all the time, anger, jealousy, sadness and irritation get the best of everyone, even best friends. My husband and I are very honest with each other, but I do know a few strings to pull. If I want him to do the dishes, I may offer to do a chore he doesn't want to do. Or just say pretty please and flirt with him. I don't think this is manipulation, it is just working things out. Manipulation to me is my saying something sneaker and more coniving, which will always come back to bite you in the butt.|`|4EWCegiRaa	I think the idea is that you're putting all your eggs in one basket.  If your husband is also your best friend, who could stop him from convincing you of anything he wanted?  And sometimes it's best to get an objective viewpoint on your situation if your having marriage problems.<br>  <br>  Personally, I don't think it's that black-and-white.  You should be completely invested in your partner and trust them wholeheartedly but that doesn't mean you should naive, stupiid, or irrational about it.

She might act either louder if she's with friends or she might be quieter when she's by herself.

Since women take longer to arouse, it is best that she start the exploratory action to culmination of what ever events progress.  <br>  (You know what I mean, I hope)<br>  <br>  Another advantage of girl on top is that she is in control.<br>  <br>  Anthony|`|KhyPqoFIaa	Totally it says the girl is in control and knows what she wants<br>  That is ultimate sex self confidence<br>  <br>  From the surfer!|`|qQq23yziaa	I have no clue why but I love it.|`|vGh3WsU2aa	big turn-on|`|KjRqLqbuaa	i think the girl on top is a turn on when they are just making out.<br>  most guys like it.<br>  but when you're fully naked thats a different story, because there can be many different positions...
b2e454d13dcb8c58423bb1cc2b44f33caa	Not all guys like popular chicks.. atleast i dont. <br>  Just try to talk to him about his life (outside of school) like <br>  "What do you like to do after school?"<br>  "What type of music you listen to?"<br>  <br>  Just stuff to make a interesting conversation, and eventually get into that flirty stuff and he will begin to really like you back.|`|qqHx4KmMaa	really pretty yourself up for school, walk with him in the halls when you can, touch his arm when he says something funny (not in a forced way) and really start to pull out the flirt in you. if he responds well, keep going and start texting him (go out on a limb, ask for his number!) and if still he isnt turning you away you might as well go for it, because it may just be that he doesnt want to say anything that you should go for him. it may be scary but you can do it! if you really just cant say it out loud send him a cute little note in class asking him out... and it will all be worth it. if it doesnt work, then at least you know when he is with that other girl that there was nothing else you could do. no regrets is the way to live your life.|`|FLWuVKWnaa	LOL.

And not all big girls are ugly.|`|3ab0562924ae58daee1fe664ccc36a9daa	Just because a woman is obese or over weight doesn't mean she doesn't have taste or know what she wants in a guy, I have seen plenty of picky obese or over weight men out there as well. Why should anyone over weight have to lower their standards because of how they look on the outside?  It's whats on the inside that really matters.<br>   Let me ask you this lets say a few years down the line you happen to gain some weight making you quite chunky and your still single do you think you should take what you can get in a woman? weather shes not that attractive or over weight? I've got news for you even if your small right now you may not always stay that way you have a 50/50 chance of being over weight yourself some day and do you really want people to look down on you for that?<br>   Its not exactly real easy to lose weight for a lot of people and its to easy to gain it, some people have a thyroid problem and can not help being bigger. Do you really think people that have weight issues want to be big? Probably not! I'm sure they would love to be smaller and have tried every diet out there and nothing works for them, yes they could have surgery but a lot of people don't have insurance that covers that or they don't have the money to get it done those kinds of surgeries are not cheap you know.<br>   I myself have been on both sides of this issue i have been overly over weight and i have been really really thin, yes i was much happier when i was skinny and i felt a lot better health wise as well, but to maintain my weight while i was thinner i had to eat very very little and that wasn't healthy for instance a peice of skinless chicken breast a day, or one cheese burger a day and i had to exercise to the point of exhaustion  EVERY DAY if i didn't i would gain weight, thats how easy it is for some people to lose weight.<br>   There are some people out there that are naturally thin they can eat all they want and not gain a pound, they have real high motabolisms so its easy for them to stay thin, my boyfriend is one of those people. And its really hard for those people to understand why people are over weight they have never been big in their entire life so they have no idea how it is and how hard it is to lose it.<br>    Lets say you fall head over heals in love with  a real thin gal and you marry her and a couple years down the road she gains a lot of weight are you going to divorce her because shes now " fat"? If your answer is yes then your the one with issues and you should get some help.|`|J7Mmo5Xmaa	The same reason anyone is picky.No one wants someone they think is ugly.Even fat folks.|`|OpiJAxr1aa	same reason ugly guys are picky, cause they can.|`|fQ7nIwVqaa	cuz its better to b alone than to b with sum1 who u dont like.

xfgVGqvXaa	One thing I'd say is: try not to be too hard on yourself.  From your other questions, you seem worried you will do something that ruins your health.  If you feel like eating a carrot as a snack, for example, I would suggest that you eat a carrot!  One of the bonuses of being a human is that we are designed to deal with lots of different kinds of food.<br>  <br>  I'm a bit older than you, and I remember life being quite difficult at nineteen.  You get a lot of new responsibilities loaded on to you, because you are legally adult.  It's tempting to get involved with a controlling relationship or a controlling group, because it seems to make things simpler.  As you've found, it doesn't really work that way.  The people who want to control your life only think they know best!  In reality, they are just making it up as they go along, like everyone else.<br>  <br>  Eventually depression does come to an end, although at the time it feels as though it never will.  Time passes and we find better relationships to replace the ones that didn't work out.  So don't give up.  We can change our lives for the better, however much depression makes it seem as though we can't.<br>  <br>  BTW, feel free to email if you want to ask anything else (pete@friendlyfrog.net).|`|9xICsp5oaa	I think in order to move on you need to look at helping yourself feel better, i.e. maybe taking up an interest that would help you make more friends and also take your mind off things.  Your 19, so there's so much life ahead of you, take the chance to be yourself and I'm sure when you're happier there'll be more opportunities to meet someone.  Good luck,

oOD3dYaNaa	She's probably quiet because she's shy. So, you're going to need to give her a little nudge by making the first move. =]<br>  <br>  I know it is nerve wracking, but think of the positives that the first move could lead to versus the negatives. And most shy people respond very well to people that make the first move. <br>  <br>  Just go up to her and say "Hey! What's up?" Even saying that could be the start of something amazing. <br>  And what's the worst that she could say? No? What human being says no to another saying hello? LOL <br>  <br>  But anyway, then just keep the conversation going from there. Ask her questions that don't have a yes or no answer, because that'll keep her talking to you. Like "So how's your day?" and stuff like that. She'll think you're nice and sweet. And you'll definitely have her attention.<br>  <br>  From there, just say "Hey, so I've seen you around alot, and I was wondering if you maybe wanted to hang out with me?" Short and sweet.<br>  <br>  If she says no, then just play it cool by saying "Oh, that's okay. I was just wondering if some people wanted to come with me to the movies. I'll find some more." And then there's your answer. <br>  <br>  If she says yes, then great!

RDIGrQoKaa	I think you already know your answer.<br>  <br>  If you really do love her and care about this sophomore, you wouldn't be "getting with" this other Erica girl. Even if the sophomore wants to wait, by you using another girl on the side shows her that you really don't care about her. Because if you did, you wouldn't even think about being with another girl.<br>  <br>  And who knows, maybe you're not ready for another serious relationship with commitment. The flowers are cute, but I'd really think about using the "L" word unless you truly mean it.|`|gCPu04gTaa	Stop playing around with other girls would be a good start!<br>  <br>  Be nice to her and become her friend. Most girls in serious relationships like to know that they can talk and just "be" with their boyfriend, and like to know its not just physical.|`|azbt1xddaa	well girls love getting flowers so good thinking there. You can try taking her out on a date.  Maybe to see a movie?  thats always a good start and its cute.  Just tell her how you feel about her and how you will never break her heart or do anything to hurt her.  Things should take off from there
cGbTJobeaa	Men are not great with babies. It just is.  Babies are breakable and you can't play rough and tumble with them.<br>  <br>  Just wait a little while and he'll be best pals with the kid and you'll be feeling on the outs.<br>  <br>  BTW, quit arguing with him all the time.  When you feel yourself starting to get angry, STOP and give your husband a long hug.  It really helps both of you to reconnect with each other and to lose the attitude.  Seriously.|`|SHARt1k3aa	First child?  This happens all the time.  Mothers are usually the primary parent, that's just the way it is.  Daddy's like to play.  Maybe he isn't comfortable with the baby totally, and she is a girl, so there is a difference there as well.  Give him time, she is only one year old.  Maybe as she gets older he'll be more comfortable doing more.|`|XlhBBZPxaa	if he doesn't want to take any responsability for your child together and you are not happy at all then leave or try counseling|`|0jhzFOV8aa	My husband is the same. My family actually has commented how I'm like a single mother. The men in my family are great with kids so my husband's behavior was a surprise for me. My husband loves our child but is clueless and absorbed with work and hobbies. For patience, I just try to remember that there was a time when Dads only saw their kids to say goodnight and for "lectures" in the study.  And, it is still easier to live with a husband with a job than as a single working parent. Plus, I'm scared to think of what could happen in a visitation weekend. <br>  <br>  It's getting better now that our son is a pre-schooler. However, I'm hesitant to leave him alone with Dad because Dad 'forgets' to watch him all the time. I like the babysitter idea.<br>  <br>  I wish I had realized when our child was 1-year-old that my husband was never going to "get the hang" of baby and child care.  It would have saved me a lot of anger, arguing and tears.|`|n8lXItGraa	I really don't know what you could do.  When I was married...I tried everything.  He just wasn't daddy material...no other way to put it.  I had to hire a babysitter whenever I had somewhere to go...even when he was at home!  he always had "things" to do.  he had a weight room for those all important workouts, and a wood shop that he would retreat to.  He was always big into exercise...jogging...walking..stuff like that.  Yeah...we just didn't fit into his busy lifestyle.  I tried talking to him.  I tried just leaving the house a few times just to see what would happen.  The kids were basically un attended during those few times.  That's when I decided that a baby sitter ( I couldn't really afford) was better than leaving them home "alone" with him.  I hope you can find the responsible adult in your partner.  I couldn't find one in mine.  Hope this helps....|`|faOBk7qtaa	If you are going to leave do it now while your baby doesnt remmeber having a daddy, if you wait any longer it will screw the baby up.<br>  <br>  Sounds like he is just a typical man and a loser father, good intentions can go to hell, it is all about action.|`|43InAotDaa	Talk to him tell him how ur feeling if its not working leave.|`|130816e5bf662924b68497e6577df429aa	Yes- I feel that way. My husband uses the "She doesn't like me. She only likes you." excuse. It's true, she does prefer me. (We have a 3 month old). She cries when he holds her and calms down when I take her. But, my point is- #1 She's probably feeling his tension/nervousness/whatever #2- She needs to get used to someone besides me taking care of her now or I'm afraid she'll have major separation anxiety in a few months.<br>  <br>  I've been tempted to tell him I may as well be a single parent. It's not like I'd have more work and I wouldn't have someone bickering at me. But, I do love him and I don't want our kids growing up without a dad. He's wonderful with our 4 year old, so maybe he's just nervous around the little one.|`|5PwfscCjaa	I know exactly what your talking about! I feel like im raising 2 kids instead of 1! He'll play with my son and feed him occasionally but other than that he'll only do things when HE wants to. He still doesnt understand that baibies are 24/7. Im seriously debating leaving him.....not just for this reason but its definitely contributing to it. Goodluck and I hope if you do decide to leave you will be much happier|`|AA12366897	I understand what you are talking about because my husband was the same way. We have two children, with the first one he was worse and with our second one after many arguments before she was born he is better.   I believe you should have a long serious talk with him.  He may think because he is the one working outside the house that he has nothing to do with childcare at all, but that is not true because even though he's working so are you.  The child is half his.  Taking care of a child is a selfless kind of job and requires care from both the parents.  Raising a child is the hardest and most rewarding thing you will ever do.  Please don't let it go on without talking with him because your moods also affect the child's too.  How you interact with your husband is how your child will learn about relationships and working through differences.  If you yell and scream for example, that is how your child will think a relationship should be. The best course of action is to communicate your feelings to your husband and what you are going through.  Make sure you are getting enough sleep and taking care of yourself because that can also affect your moods and make you less patient. Hope everything works out, relationships are hard work.|`|ft8t98Pnaa	tell him he needs to man up... dont walk out... he needs to pitch in point blank period... how about you take him for child support? you can do that even though you are living with eachother if your not married... then that way.... he is obligated to pitch in

otTMXJvRaa	Hi </33,<br>  <br>  Your ex-BF definitely no longer loves you, or he would not have broken up with you for another girl.  Can I assume that you are in High School?<br>  <br>  Love can fade away if it's not nurtured.  You don't know how fast it faded away.  Maybe your BF thought about breaking up with you for weeks or months, and you weren't aware of it.<br>  <br>  Also, people change as they are growing up... and their emotions typically do not stabilize until their 20's.<br>  <br>  Perhaps a general crash course all about guys, BF's, crushes, dating, and love would be helpful for you to think about while your bruised and tender heart recovers.<br>  <br>  </33... crushes, dating, and love can be confusing... extremely confusing... for adults as well as young people. That's why it is a good idea not to start dating too early. Age 16 or 17 would be a good age to start dating. <br>  <br>  First off... in High School, young guys and young girls can be pretty unpredictable, and change their minds very quickly... for no reason whatsoever… even at age 17. That can lead to hurt feelings and heartache. You and some guy might both agree that you like each other one day, and literally the next day either one of you could call it quits. Just remember that.<br>  <br>  Don't assume that you will marry your first crush or your first serious BF... it won't happen. The odds are literally 100-to-1 against it. Sorry!<br>  <br>  Keep in mind that the purpose of dating is generally to determine if a person will make a potentially good future spouse. Therefore, don't ever date someone that you know would not be good for you in the long term.<br>  <br>  </33... crushes/love/kissing/sex are wonderful intimate expressions that can all be compared to fire.<br>  <br>  Both intimacy and fire can be dangerous if used improperly.<br>  <br>  When used improperly, you know that fire can cause serious damage. Intimacy, when used improperly, can also cause serious damage... such as heartache, pregnancy, and STD's.<br>  <br>  Be advised that girls and guys often have different views regarding physical affection. Kissing will very likely make you feel closer to the guy. There’s no guarantee it’ll make him feel closer to you, though. You could end up with a serious crush on him, while he might be willing to just walk away.<br>  <br>  As a decent and trusting young lady, you will need to be aware of a few of the potential hazards of dating. These hazards certainly apply to young people as well as adults. That's also why you need to not start kissing or making out too early with guys (even though you might want to).<br>  <br>  </33, here are two major dating hazards for you to consider:<br>  <br>  1. There are some guys out there (young and old) who will tell a nice girl that he loves her, just to see how far she will let him go with her body. There are guys out there who are ready and willing to use you and your body for their own selfish pleasure... and then leave... breaking your heart in the process, and possibly leaving you pregnant... or with an STD (a nasty disease in your private parts). Hopefully, you will mature enough when dating to recognize these losers, and say "No".<br>  <br>  2. You could meet a genuinely nice and decent guy, and you both really do think that you love each other. After a few weeks or months, you both might be tempted to take off your clothes together. That would be a good way to mess up both of your young lives. It's happened to a lot of nice girls and decent guys out there. Hopefully, you will be mature enough to resist this type of temptation... and the temptation can be very strong.<br>  <br>  The best way to avoid getting into trouble from either hazard listed above is for you to never be alone with your guy... anywhere. Not his house, not your house, not a friend's house, or anywhere else. A responsible (and awake) adult should always be nearby.<br>  <br>  You should also never attend a party where no adults are present. Nor any event with drugs or alcohol abuse.<br>  <br>  Ideally, before you start dating, it would be wise to make a conscious decision to remain a virgin until you are happily married. That means no premarital sex. Having sex too early will make you feel sad, cheap, and make it less special (same thing with kissing in case you do it too early with the wrong guy... but kissing is much less dangerous).<br>  <br>  OK, why no premarital sex? <br>  <br>  Because having sex without marriage is going outside of the laws of man and God that civilizations on this planet have lived by for thousands of years.<br>  <br>  Because there's the unnecessary risk of excessive heartache (any break-up will cause heartache... virgin or not... but heartache will be less if you are still a virgin... that's just the way human brains are wired).<br>  <br>  Because there's also the genuine danger of an unwanted Baby... or an STD.<br>  <br>  Because your parents would very likely be extremely disappointed.<br>  <br>  Because your "no sex" rule will pretty much eliminate the players, the losers, the creeps, the clods, and the selfish manipulators. <br>  <br>  By refusing to participate in premarital sex, you'll find out pretty quickly if the guy you are dating just wants to get into your pants… or if he truly respects you, your body, your heart, your soul, your feelings, your values… and your family. <br>  <br>  </33, just take a look at a random selection of the questions from girls in this category... a significant number of problems here directly involve premarital sex... coupled with immaturity, foolish expectations, and invalid assumptions.<br>  <br>  You need to date nice guys who will treat you with dignity and respect while you are having innocent fun together during your youth. Trustworthy guys who would not ask you to do anything inappropriate.<br>  <br>  Long term, you need to find a special guy who will be honorable and be very good to you as you grow into a decent young woman. He may not be the hottest-looking guy around, but you will love him just the way he is. He should be a guy who is proud to take you home to meet his parents and his family. A guy that you would be pleased to take home to be introduced to your parents and family. A guy who will ask for your hand in marriage. A guy who is willing to stand together with you in a wedding ceremony before both of your families in church.<br>  <br>  You don't want a guy who is not honorable and just wants your body... for a while... and then he would be gone. A problem like that is much more likely to happen if you give away your body without the commitment of marriage.<br>  <br>  Keep yourself out of trouble by thinking smart. Don't believe everything a guy tells you... watch him carefully, and evaluate whether or not his words are consistent with his actions. See if he respects you and your values.<br>  <br>  Don't be afraid or embarrassed to talk to your parents or your family about dating and boy issues as you are growing up. They know you, love you, and will certainly give you good advice.<br>  <br>  You will be really happy when you are older, and you look back over your life... happy that you made the right decisions about finding, dating, and evaluating guys when you were young.<br>  <br>  That's pretty much the big picture that you should be looking at, </33.<br>  <br>  Someday, you'll make a lucky guy a fine wife... provided you stay out of trouble and make good decisions.<br>  <br>  Take care, and God bless.<br>  <br>  Best wishes,<br>  -Charlie

Boys and girls have different behaviours and skills. Such obsessive behaviour and drive built the modern world. Inventors are often thought of as 'odd' until they come up with something great!<br>  <br>  With regard to the game, the makers build in 'hooks' to make the game so attractive. Perhaps some romantic fiction novels, (can't put it down) have similar effect on girls?|`|BuP1JlIxaa	everybody is odd.|`|AorhZF06aa	who knows?|`|U5iTOlm1aa	Lol at this point I don't thank it's about the game.<br>  Its the fact that some one said.

e1a7bc55a49362ce6489ded532083a8eaa	Step 1: Make contact - approach her with a pretext conversation, start with something neutral then shift to more personal stuff. Keep it short, intelligent, and amusing. Tell her your name. Ask her for her name. Ask for her phone number. tell her you'd like to chat some more with her some time later. Your interaction should not last more than 10-15 minutes.<br>  <br>  Step 2: Make a connection - contact her and take her on a tour of your world, show her the person you are and things that you do. Ask her about her world and the things that she does. Dwell on your common experiences, interests, ideals, etc. She will feel connected to you in this way. Remember to be sensitive, shy people can be very sensitive creatures!<br>  <br>  Step 3: Take the shot - once she seems comfy with you, take a shot at getting things further. She will not really be too shy around you anymore!<br>  Remember not to wait too long or play too nice because you might slide down the dreaded friend lane! And once go friend, you never get back!|`|wV3Fs9Ebaa	act normal<br>  not too quick<br>  go up to her and ask her a simple normal question<br>  excuse me, do u know the time<br>  and then go on from there<br>  to more longer conversations<br>  become close friends and see if she is the one|`|8qbM2j16aa	talk to her<jus start a random conversation it works>|`|eWTjH5U9aa	Go up to her and start a good convo,<br>  make her smile, but let her do most of the talking.<br>  Bring up the fact that she looks at you and tell her that you admire that.<br>  Be yourself, be who u r with your friends not someone else<br>  Eye contact look for one second till she does than look away the next<br>  No glairing <br>  CALM DOWN|`|0AXgXFpraa	hmm,<br>  just go up to her and talk to her,<br>  honestly the more u talk to her, the less shy she'll become with you<br>  - experience -<br>  <br>  answer mine ??<br>  <a href="http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;_ylt=AmqR4kxcfd9khY4ToYz6ioPsy6IX;_ylv=3?qid=20090307054336AA95gRs">http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;...</a>|`|RkPDhEuLaa	flash her - if she smiles/blushes she is yours... if she squints/storms off she probably doesnt want to get to know you|`|AA12088442	just b like hey whats up?<br>  durrr|`|92uAYdmaaa	Go up to her and say "hey"<br>  and just chat about your interests, and ask her questions about what she's into.

racnq84Vaa	It is over.  And odds are your friendship will drift away too.  It is very difficult to remain friends after a relationship ends and both parties have new interests.|`|EgA87yR0aa	It might be a very long shot for her to want to be your girlfriend again.  I think the best thing is to make sure you can honestly be a good friend to her and not worry how close you are.  I believe girls will be good to you unless they have something to worry about and they can worry a lot.<br>  <br>  I would very seriously kill all thoughts of getting back together so that you can focus entirely  on being an honest good person who can support her (by listening to her, not by doing things) and whatever you do, absolutely do not try to push her or get information or feelings from her that she doesn't want to give.  She will probably run if you do that. Don't cling on to her, don't cling don't cling, just be a good guy who is ready to listen and doesn't write her all the time.|`|LdNqobiqaa	This is a hard one. I understand the whole "friend" thing. I think it's different for guys becuase as close as I am with my boyfriend and as much as we care about one another He tells me if we ever broke up for good he wouldn't be my friend, for the simple fact is would "hurt" too much. IDK but honestly maybe if you continue this friendly relationship with her you'd get a chance to get to know her more and her mother. You could build some kind of a more stable foundation and things might just work out better that way. Don't give up though, becuase if you really like her fight for it!!<br>  <br>  --GoodLuck <3
mSHxDFcJaa	You've gotta learn how to discipline yourself. It sounds like this girl believes in you and so now you have to believe in yourself. If you really want to get rid of your bad habits, you have to try.. as hard as it may be for you. Maybe you could try going to school and educating yourself, finding a better paying job that pays more, and try talking to your friends and letting them know your situation (hopefully they understand). Good luck with everything, hope it works out. Your not only changing for your girl, but also for yourself. You have this girl to give you support so just put your mind to it and believe in yourself.|`|n1y67ZNuaa	if its upsetting her, ud stop your ways if you loved her.<br>  let her help you out if she wants to, you can always repay her back later.|`|iF94LMuyaa	Just tell her you don't want to take her money, because you love her so much. (also tell her how much you love her) And tell her your keeping the job so you get some kind of money. Dont mention your friends unless she asks. If she does, say how you really feel, and make sure you add "thats how I really feel"<br>  <br>  <br>  If you want stopping to be an option, you need to (i know this may be hard) But you need to stop hanging out with those friends of yours. If she is who you love, your friends are just holding you back. Sorry if thats not what you want to hear, but its the hard truth. Good luck.

DnK0e4wcaa	Well I have a story that is sort of related, but in my case, I wasn't the one to love. He was. I met him where both pretty young. We both lived overseas with our families for a long time and our families worked together too, though they lived quite a ways away. Because he lived so far off, (like two days drive away) I saw him only like 2-4 times a year. Anyway, we've known each other now for three years. Ever since be beginning of our friendship, he's loved me. Real love too. But to be honest, I really did not want to be in a relationship with him and though he indirectly said that he loved me, I didn't believe him and I rejected him thoroughly. We were still very close friends and we chatted and emailed each at least several times a week. He went through a serious depression because of my rejection, but we were still friends. For two years we did this yo-yo thing of getting close then me freaking out and pushing him away. But a year ago we saw each other again and there I told him definitely that I could never have feelings for him. He was crushed. We sort of moved apart over the summer and he went back into depression. Around fall we started corresponding again, but it was on a very different level. He was very wary of me. How could I blame him? He didn't want to get hurt again. About two months ago we were chatting and we both opened up. For the first time I understood that he had loved me and that I had hurt him. It was amazing. But I still didn't love him back. It wasn't something I could change. Even if I did fell some romantic attraction I wouldn't want to get involved because I know his character too well. So he loves me and I don't love him back. He thinks he'll always love me, but I think it will fade with time. Or at least I hope. We've talked before about the future, about what will happen when I actually do get into a serious relationship... and it's not with him. He's let me go. Because he loves me. You're not alone, one-sided love happens all the time. Don't give up hope, feeling subside with time.
7bLrZOAvaa	Well i would say thats the rule of life. We meet so many kinds of people in our life.

So dont trust her too much. I had a similar experience with a girl I used to date and it was v painful in the end.

FewhKlx9aa	First thing to do is get him to a doctor to see what his hormone levels are.Was he always into sex before you got married? The other thing I would want to know is does he act differently in other areas,does he spend more time with his male friends.He may of just married to show family members that he is'nt gay (there are plenty of guys that do this).I'm not saying he is but I would want to know more as it's hard to say with such little information.How are you two outside of the bedroom? He definitly loves you but something is wrong and the docs office is the place to start.If he says no he won't go then you have to question further.Is he out of work? Depressed?|`|iblT1HJpaa	One thing that you don't understand about men - men generally find intimacy through sexual union. That sounds crude - but that's the way it is. Women generally find intimacy through communication. Which is why there is such destruction in marital conflict. They argue - she "cuts him off" so then he leaves. Both lose. They have both lost their source for intimiate relationship. <br>  So the question is - "why does your husband not want intimacy?" <br>  1. He's afraid of coming close, too close. He's got "issues" that he does not want you to know about. Typically, they are family-of-origin issues and that's for you to delve. <br>  2. He is finding resolution to his intimacy from another source. Sorry - he could be having an affair. People do not have affairs for the sex. They have affairs to be affirmed as good and wanted and desired. The sexual affair has little to do with sex. It's all about intimacy. In an affair, neither party has to disclose anything really deep. The superficial is all they want. This is why people that do affairs are so lacking. They do not / cannot have deep interpersonal relationships. This is why 80%+ of people that have affairs and get married - get divorced. They are really lousy at meaninful relationship. <br>  3. Your husband is finding sexual satisfaction from another source - and that's pornography. Do not think that this is not an epidemic in the entire world. The internet has allow this addiction to become rampant. You cannot satisfy what he has dreamed. No woman can. Nothing can!  He's doing it himself and your marriage is in the way. If you think that porn, any porn, is okay - you are really, really wrong! You don't understand the nature of men. You are a woman. You can't know where this goes in a guy's head. <br>  <br>  Why doesn't he want you? Because one way or another, he's found a replacement. Your job now is figure out what that replacement is. Hopefully he will be open enough to tell you. <br>  (99% of guys are too embarased to say) Good Luck.|`|qw7BmBq6aa	For a guy that is REALLY weird.  I mean, guys get hard and want it like every day, atleast my husband is that way.  <br>  <br>  I think he's been doing something on the side and hiding it from you.  Sounds like another porn addiction to me.  Ask him if he has been watching porn when you're not around.|`|sr0vZPQqaa	If he is not willing to do something about it then i'd get rid.|`|ce53a9f68093b2a6cf60a521947320d0aa	wow .. sweetie i think your husband is secretly in the closet..|`|29hcn9JRaa	Many women tend to be to hard on themselves and blame themselves for the lack of desire that they think their husband doesn't have for them, and take it quite personal. However you need to understand it is not you, it is him, and at this point in your husband's life, for reasons that only he knows, is capable of only giving you what he can give, be it a small amount of affection here and their, if that is all he has then that is all he has. Not all two men are alike, and contrary to many peoples beliefs and notions, men are not seeking sex every few minutes, some  men may feel the need to have it daily, while others are quite content on having it once a month, it is all based on the individual man?  Ya know, rumor has it that men are not needed to find sexual gratification? and I even heard once that some of the best sex is sex we can have all by ourselves! I am of course kinda making light of the situation, however at the same time I am being serious.|`|LywVUxsTaa	When he says he wants to, what is the reason he gives for not going ahead and doing it?  I'm wondering if maybe he is afraid of getting you pregnant?  Or it could be some physical thing that he isn't admitting to you, like it is painful for him.  Some men can have painful ejaculations due to prostate problems.  The only way to find out what is going on with him is to have an honest discussion.  It sounds as if you tried this, but I would try again, just be as gentle with him as you can.  (Men can have such fragile egos!)  And don't be hard on yourself.  It is very unlikely that there is anything wrong with you.|`|djUMvICoaa	It's hard to say, but what I would do is invest in a vibrator and the next time he says no or pushes you away, I would reach over to the night stand and pull it out and have a good old time right in front of him, saying that you need something right now and can't wait for him.  If he doesn't get the message then you have bigger problems than we can help you with.  Are his parents as distant from each other?  He may know how to do the things to catch someone but his upbringing tells him some of these things are just wrong because it's not what his parents did.  But  I cannot understand your wedding night.  The other thing is does he want children?  Is that what's keeping him from stirring the fire, he doesn't want any?|`|Ovcwe5qAaa	This isn't about you, it's about him.  You have a couple of choices.<br>  1) accept the situation, and stop pressuring him.  Some people just don't have that strong of a sex drive<br>  2) see a counsellor to find a middle ground<br>  3) begin a frank and unaccusing discussion on your own,  come clean about your true desires, take your time, and accept what your partner tells you and go on from there.|`|lHynYc4Aaa	Maybe he just doesn't need it as much, you have a higher libido than him and that's fine. You need to let him know you want more sex though.|`|5UIdcMgIaa	He has a lover???<br>  Actually I dont know, there may be many reasons, talk to him|`|9IT6iTswaa	First I must say, do NOT blame yourself for this. There is NOTHING wrong with you. Too many times a spouse will put the blame on themselves when this sort of phenomenon happens in a relationship. 'am I not sexy enough?....do I not turn him on?'''and so on. Forget about putting the blame on you and your ability to spark his engine. <br>  Now, the key to any relationship is communication. Especially when it comes to trouble. nagging and arguing is not communicating. Talking and listening is. Choose a time when you are both relaxed, preferably NOT in bed. Go out for lunch, take a picnic somewhere or just be together. Do not point fingers and blame him  either. Defense will only kick in and you will probably not get very far. I say tell him your upset, tell him your needs and wants. tell him how you feel. ask him how he feels. ask him what his wants are. communicate!! if you then find out that he just doesn't have the desires or need for sex as much as you do then you will either have to accept this or move on. Sex is important in a relationship but it isn't the end all be all. weigh the pros and cons and make your decision. His not desiring sex could be a medical issue as well. If this is the case then it would be up to him to find out. Bottom line, quit blaming yourself! Hope this helps

That dumb friend just became a very useful conversation tool for you. As soon as he walks away to turn in an assignment or to go to the restroom say something like..."He knows that I like you so he tries to make it as hard as possible for me to even start a conversation with you. He's just jealous cause you're prettier than him."<br>  She'll blush, she'll smile and laugh, then you can continue from there. Quickly get into movies or other stuff that isn't so open and close ended on the questions. If you see he tries even harder; I think the answer is pretty clear. He likes her too but thinks she's like you so he's trying to avoid you and her getting too close for comfort. <br>  <br>  Good luck!!<br>  <br>  BTW, if you feel she's into you too, catch her after class and ask her what she's doing in the weekend. She'll like you for trying hard and catching her after class. The trick is catching her alone so that her friends don't immediately chime in with their opinions and she can make up her own about you.|`|zOIgzIy4aa	wait and catch her by herself then talk to her.|`|P9HuD4Qgaa	talk to her after the bell rings. and make sure you two are alone, by walking her to class really quick, and then ask her for her number. or when the buses leave. once again, catch up with her, making sure ur alone.

Tuck, Porter. ok? dont be afraid to change the names. the best storys have been changed severl times almost to the point where they aren't the same story that the whole thing was started with. good luck. (I got this following info from a site about how to write a book about vampires. there is just some good infor here) Do NOT decide on the title first. You can do this as the story develops. <br>  Think of the time the book happens. Is it modern? It can be set at any time at all. <br>  Decide whether it will be from a first person viewpoint (eg. I, me) or third person (he, she, it). You won't usually find a book written from second person point of view, which is you, you did, you will.

Think about that if you give in to that impulse, you could possibly hurt her and that can prepare you mentally to resist that impulse.<br>  <br>  Its our curse most 15 year old boys think with their head but not the one on our shoulders:P|`|AazkuVzqaa	You're 15, your hormones are going crazy right now.  There is nothing you can really do to stop it, it's just something you will have to deal with.  At least you are masturbating instead of going out and having sex, I must say I am glad you are trying to do something to keep it under control.|`|sauE94zVaa	Anything that will stop your sexual urges at your age will harm you later. You are probably going to regret it. Just keep on masturbating.
IgivEx1Vaa	What you did was not a good choice ... and you are wastin your time for sure....
gCPu04gTaa	I does, as you have guessed, mean you like him a bit more than just a friend.<br>  <br>  You now have to ask yourself "Is your friendship is worth fighting over him?".<br>  If the answer is NO then accept that you can't have him an try to stop thinking about him. <br>  If the answer is YES then you have to ask yourself "Has he shown any signs of liking me?" and "If I did tell him I like him and ask him to choose me instead, would he accept?" Consider whether he likes you back, because if you take the risk you may lose two friends in the process.<br>  <br>  OR, you could tell your guy-friend's girlfriend that you like him, and see what happens.<br>  <br>  Its up to you now. So good luck with whatever you choose to do.|`|ErmcT4uUaa	I would go see a doctor. He might have given you the cooties or the heebee jeebees.|`|SRZza0cWaa	you are in love with him|`|877c11ba0aaa509142a50e675e9f83c6aa	It means you are crazily in like with him. Maybe even, like you said, falling in love depending on what it is  you appreciate about him.|`|XK0sOxbzaa	you are so in love with him, but in a bad time. do not interfere with their relationship. when it ends, be there for him and then go to him. dont mess up things between him and this girl or you and this girl|`|cBKpDtWNaa	Oh it meaning you are in love with him and very much .....I do hopping you can find a way to him without hurting anyone ....I wishing you many much luck....Katie :-)|`|S4VVE0onaa	i have no idea maybe you are just still longing to hug him again

5GPDrBPLaa	This is how my husband and I were.  It's perfectly fine...just don't change your outlook on purpose just so you're compatible with her.  That changes who you are and eventually will cause a blowup or breakup. <br>  <br>  No one knows for sure if it true love except for you two.  Be patient, take it slow and enjoy getting to know her. :)|`|NOYvRabiaa	i mean its cool if yall agree on lots of the same subjects but on every subject it will start to get annoying. you guys dont want everything to be the same b/c your relationship will get boring really fast.  its cool most of the time..just make sure its not all the time|`|dvvQQ6eRaa	That's fine.

ef900587f42a3006a5209f45881cb638aa	Sure why not......My daughter is a 3rd grader and if I got an invitation especially with detailed information I would let her go.  Of course I would have to talk to the parents first especially if I did not know them and possibly talk to other parents to if they know the family.  <br>  <br>  In today's society I understand if parents would not let their kids go.  I remember when I was a kid my parents let me go to the party however pick me up before bedtime.|`|SxqYguUCaa	Yes. If there are numbers to call, then I'd say it's safe.
jZbDOdwjaa	LET NATURE TAKE ITS COURSE|`|AA11706291	You keep saying you love your boyfriend and wouldn't break up with him for this guy then I fail to see the problem.<br>  <br>  Be friends with the guy from the summer but don't speak to him as you did then just treat him as a friend. If you think he may be feeling things for you tell him you are with your boyfriend who you love very much and you only have and only ever will see him as a friend.|`|hEcKmleVaa	Take a deep breath and think about this:  You have a boyfriend you adore and he's the nicest, sweetest boy you could ever meet.  The other guy, who hooked you up, is difficult to read and mysterious to you.  Therefore, you feel compelled to figure out what he's all about. Even if this guy has feelings for you and you don't want to lead him on or hurt him, his feelings are his problem.  You aren't responsible for how he feels.  I would not be spending time with him or communicating with him if you care about your present bf.  Shooting stars having nothing to do with reality.  The answer is obvious:  If you love your bf, don't muddy the waters.  You don't "owe" anything to Mr. Mysterious.|`|JjS4ARPYaa	It looks like you like both boys, and you seem to want to date this one for know, but you seem to really like having this one around kind of for a back up or someone to want you.|`|DaXBSLtaaa	Honey...life is to short to be worrying about things like this and you are way to young for it to matter....enjoy being your age!|`|XK0sOxbzaa	the guy who hooked u guys up is a freind. a really good friend. dont let go of him. he will help you out when things go wrong
DcVoq5Tuaa	If possible, explain to her parent's what their daughter is saying so they can address the issue. Daughter needs a swift kick in the ***. One day she will really need her parent's and they won't be there.
ZKsSnT64aa	first of all,you CANNOT help what you are attracted to.<br>  <br>  Ive advocated this fact for a long time because throughout my life Ive been told by girls what I SHOULD be attracted to but I continue to live my own life MY WAY.<br>  <br>  LIVE YOUR LIFE THE WAY YOU WANT AND GO FOR WHAT YOU WANT.
Qn1nRtVNaa	...seems you are having some trouble!<br>  Start by becoming "close" friends with her, and build some thing out of that first. <br>  She will get over it sooner or later, so untill then, let her know that you are here for her. Try to take her mind of of the situation if she starts talking about it.<br>  Once she gets back on her feet, and forgets about the other guy, then  tell her how you feel about her! ...hopefully she will have some of the same feelings for you!<br>  - From Holly, (South Wales)|`|NiQxQuqtaa	I don't think you should approach her until shes really over her ex boyfriend and it doesn't seem like shes really into you so wait
yBKw1P7jaa	shreya you dont want him  ,you want ur self esteem.the more you ll trythe more you crave for him ,the more happy you ll make him and the more bleak you ll make chances of getting him.you know he has a soft corner for you,so you dont have to try hard.you humiliated him and take it from me that he ll never forget you,and he is still has hope left.<br>  <br>  now dont make it too easy for him to figure out that you want him back.just have a body language which is inviting but dont say a thing.smile at him look confident,be at complete ease,slowly slowly  he ll start to melt.but ya all this time dont appear with another guy<br>  <br>  bt remember its not love its  a game|`|6wluqXMzaa	hmm hez nt a true lover...co i ws in da sme situation(although wasnt insulted) bt m still behind dat gal n shez my frnd..so hw cn he dump u if u reject him?|`|AA12056497	no sis u have insulted her n now u want him back, its very wrong leave him n moved ahead|`|JuylwCxsaa	hey!!! u insulted him nd still he helpd u..must b crazy abt u.

I understand how you feel.<br>  <br>  <br>  As girls, I will tell you a secret - there's only one way you can win his heart totally and that is seducing him.<br>  <br>  Sometimes you see "bitches" getting all the men they don't deserve to have or sometimes you see your guy is being seduced by another man.<br>  So to win him back, you have to learn to seduce him!<br>  <br>  Before I married my boyfriend he was constantly being wooed by many other women.  Some are prettier than me, I have to admit.  Some even have bigger "assets" than me.<br>  At one point, I nearly lost him but luckily I learn this seduction secrets.  Because of this, we are happily married and everyday he loves me more than ever as if we JUST got into a relationship!<br>  <br>  Sometimes, we have to "cheat" by seducing to win our man, my dear sis.<br>  <br>  Here's the site that helped me on seducing my man back: <a href="http://xurl.jp/fcm" rel="nofollow">http://xurl.jp/fcm</a>
IXskJPlVaa	Just take it easy and don't try to read too much in what is said. Do what is comfortable to both of you. A little break from the routine is  ok. It is not the time spent together as in case you have a more committed relationship/marriage you spend much more time together - it just perception and don't worry much about what is happening. Believe in your love and trust. Best of luck.|`|htWw0OlCaa	If you two spend that much time together, then maybe she does feel that you two need a little break and not hang out as much. You both need to still spend time with friends and family.|`|Xfgy7Wwkaa	as a girl, what that means is that she feels smothered a little bit and doesnt want to not like u anymore so in order to stop that from happening, she wants a little "vacation" away from u. she wants enough time away to actually miss u. it seems like u guys spend alot of time together and never really have the opportunity to miss eachother. dont worry, shell be back.
zzaScg0haa	It depends on who is in the room, not the room itself
AA10639728	Yeah it is a little shady. It sounds like she has a new texting buddy. She probaby flirts with him and doesnt want you to get upset. I don't think she's actually cheating, just talking to someone new who probably likes her. Just ask her calmly who the guy is, and drop it after that. If she keeps acting that way tell her you feel like you can't trust her, and want a break.  Losing you over some guy shouldn't be worth it to her.|`|H5DdF6V9aa	Yep, shady. Any friend of hers is a potential friend of yours. Invite him out for some good conversation.|`|dHPA390Qaa	No, it isn't 'shady'.  <br>  She is tired of you injecting yourself into her phone conversations, and making yourself part of that when you are not part of it.<br>  She was probably just tolerating this before, but is tired of it. You will be on the way out for sure if you can't respect her request to stop snooping, and keep calling her a liar.|`|kXKjsI1baa	I would think only because she use to let you go on the phone all the time that there is def something there that she does not want you to see.. I would confront her about it...
6X2p6Zkwaa	that sex after marriage is bullshit! either hes gay or he has a STD hon!|`|J7Mmo5Xmaa	It DOES make sense that he wants to wait until you are married and here is why.I do not care how long you have been together UNLESS 3 yrs ago you both had your own homes, transportation and jobs and could support yourselves.EVERYONE between the ages of 15-25 changes.<br>  You do NOT want to get pregnant and sex makes babies hon.<br>  ALL birth control has a failure rate and "safe sex" is a myth it is more like "Russian roulette".<br>  He does not want to risk you getting pregnant and each time you have sex, you risk getting pregnant and he is not ready for that.<br>  That is for married people whohave committed to one another.<br>  Either accept him as he is, or find a guy who will have sex with you.Chances are that guy will dump you when you turn up pregnant.|`|bRghNySvaa	well i believe you should wait till your married even if you aren't virgins ha may have felt guilt for giving in even though he may still be tempted to do it if you have been together that long you should get married and by waiting it will make the marriage bed better because it wont be the same old thing that is the most important thing in a marriage is being intament in that way andcontinuingg it befor marriage will make it a common place thing|`|Zdj6wmaiaa	I can't say that I've ever had a boyfriend that didn't want sex, but if you love the guy and believe he genuinely feels the same for you, you have to respect his wishes and wait.|`|qp8y4Hs5aa	respect what he wants, and if you cant...find someone else.|`|JC7If6Naaa	wait|`|IEbAHp0gaa	Talk to him, sit him down and tell him what you have told us, clearly it is bothering you but don't talk in a condescending manner, it will only make him more upset and he will close himself off even more.<br>  <br>  Talk to him in a nice way and be understanding, tell him what is the real reason and whatever he replies with support him and help him with his decision, obviously he is a good guy but you too are good girlfriend who clearly has his best interests at your heart, good luck.|`|2VO4dc30aa	relationships are about both people not one. <br>  this seems to really be bothering you and if you guys <br>  are that close it shouldnt be hard to talk to him about<br>  it. when you are cuddling sometime bring it up.|`|m9MT3Nsoaa	you should wait<br>  you probably should have waited for marriage in the first place.<br>  but it happens.<br>  It's better in marriage.|`|pFz3pc5maa	hm... maybe he's gay... i don't know i would probably break up with him, i kind of have this problem right now and it's not working out for me either|`|RaC4qpRIaa	Hate to say it but, he might be gay. That sounds like the guy from the movie saved.|`|d1tyTq6Saa	IF U TRULY LOVE HIM, YOU WOULD BE ABLE TO WAIT
ejuJiZAAaa	never happened to me. i am an airhead|`|q2AsDnjpaa	They remind me of the attractive, intelligent  men that date attractive airheaded women.|`|kWjy7uzAaa	What? Men do this to women not the other way around, air headed men don't mind if their getting laid, when I sleep with attractive air headed women they act all surprised when I don't call them back the next day lol.|`|AA10458195	I think it is up to the person to determine who they will date. I have<br>  dated a few air heads. It was the one and only time. I like intelligent<br>  conversation.

He told me over and over<br>  all the problems one can have with such a machine.|`|OKPFeBtYaa	Isn't that the natural order of things?  Rich people also usually marry money.  And a corollary to your theory is that rich, beautiful people only marry rich, beautiful people (unless the guy is really rich, where looks may not be as important)<br>  Stupid ugly people can often be seen together too.<br>  Fat, stupid, ugly people as well.  Maybe society is becoming like the society in HG Well's the Time Machine, where we are evolving into different species.|`|AA11447210	No different than guys who do the same...to each, their own.

Or, perhaps these intelligent women are looking for some sucker type of guy to spend a lot of money on them.  Sometimes people's motives are not always above board.  Also blame the attractive airheaded men for being too stupid to notice the difference...if that is the case.|`|fdcbdb56252d1caf7416c0866d1723c2aa	It sounds like they are just playing around and having a little fun with them.  <br>  I don't think someone who is intelligent could be totally into an airhead--you can only talk about how attractive each other is for so long.|`|bvwYVGJOaa	Don't like it just in it for sex<br>  <br>  and i prefer intelligent, smart guys who can make me laugh, sweet as sugar sexy as hell and has bigger heart to love me enough!|`|J7Mmo5Xmaa	Some women like the guys looks and figure he is easy to control in a relationship.Guys do the same thing with girls.|`|4I2iOOqIaa	I think they like the guys because they are attractive.|`|6X2p6Zkwaa	they don't value themselves( if   the relationship is serious)!   well if is just sex than....its sex!|`|zOFJZg3eaa	shame on them.|`|eOCHKCRSaa	I think it's just science. It is actually very common for women under the age of 25 to date men that are considered to be complete and total idiots. It's just science. Our hormones don't allow us to mentally process that the guy we want is a complete loser (sometimes :D). Also women are very territorial and enjoy being in control. Younger or less Intelligent men are often more attractive because it allows us to have the sense of superiority.|`|VPAMzE3uaa	Intelligent does not mean secure.  I think it's an insecurity based decision - make your mate a fashion accessory instead of a life partner.  <br>  <br>  I don't think anyone who's intelligent would have a happy, long-term relationship with an airhead.  Then again, stranger things have happened, but it's probably the exception, not the rule.|`|5GslKD4baa	I find them attractive and intelligent.|`|AdtWG66Qaa	If they want to date an "airheaded" man, then go for it.Its up to that person to decide who he wants to date.|`|UoUzfHKCaa	2 of a feather flock together.|`|aldF7qNjaa	Pay Back, Turning the tables.

See those stars around it? That's what it is. Stars. It happens instantly and can last up to a year or 2. That's when you give it time because the stars wear out but the chemistry is still there and you work out at being together. However you simply don't like him anymore. If I were you I'd do this: "You've been really sweet and patient with me but I don't think I want a boyfriend right now. I think it would be better if we were just friends. What do you think? Friends?"<br>  <br>  Don't let him think that you're still into him because you're only going to dig a bigger hole for yourself. Good luck and think of the feelings you'd have if he just made you feel like he still cared about you but didn't.|`|fydj54JZaa	no no no no dont break up. its natural to feel like you dont like him anymore because your together. once your together, it takes away the fun of wanting something so badly. the best thing to do now is (and this might sound a little strange) but set goals in your head about different levels in your relationship, like i want to get to know him better, i want to send him and get from him flirty texts and ims, i want to flirt with him at school, i want to hug him, i want to kiss him, i want to makeout with him. setting these goals puts more of a spark in your relationship and keep you hooked on that guy. but make sure you take the goals very slowly so you dont scare him.|`|cEU9vA9Zaa	just tell him its to much for you to sneak around all of the time. and that its to hard for you to only see him on the weekends...!! just break up with him thats the best advice i have|`|oB1WQJHgaa	tell him your parents found out and they are making you do it so he is not mean to you... :) hope I helped.|`|n2cWT1Mpaa	I am sorry, but that was just plain STUPID of you to go out with a guy you JUST met.

Honestly, I wouldn't have even said yes to him, but yes yes yes yes yes yes YES!!! break up with him. <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  It's just like some kid 2 years older than you, your in the Middle School and hes in High School. Would you go out with him just because you think hes cute???!!!!! No, you don't even know him, and you may think you know him just because you think hes sweet and cute, but he could be a bad guy, and it would be your fault if you go hurt because you had to be dumb and say yes to some idiot on the street|`|gBAJrBxmaa	if you aren't ready for a BF then break up with him, and you shouldn't stay with a boy if you dont like him.|`|LdNqobiqaa	Honestly you sound as if you really don't even care about the relationship.

You're going to find this can be a problem for some women.  I have always dated petit women (I'm 5'11") and you'll know when they're uncomfortable or you're hurting them.  It's kind of a tricky question and it requires a lot of patience, maturity and self awareness on your part and understanding and willingness on your partner's part.  Also, sometimes it just won't work and you have to realize this could be a big relationship issue that won't ever go away. The key is: pay attention and be kind.|`|O9VN7SGiaa	well its hard to explain. as long as its not 2 or 3 inches long its fine. and as long as its not 12 or 13 inches its okay.|`|fd66aff7ba1b7cc65b9e118bdcc73be6aa	Yes, if they say it doesn't they are just lying or they are virgins.|`|EPc8Wvkpaa	women that say size doesn't matter, it's how you use it are just trying to make you feel better.

But, while it was disrespectful for you to go through her email, it's by no means a deal breaker in a serious relationship.<br>  <br>  If she cant trust you anymore for something like going through her email, how the heck was she going to trust you when you're married?

gM2eyQFKaa	Wow, that sounds... interesting. <br>  <br>  I bet she wasn't laughing at you, just that she actually saw you like that. (She's probably plenty of years older and was excited to see a 29 year old nude anyways!) <br>  <br>  Anyways, I bet she's already seen your parts... She's your Aunt, she's probably changed your diaper plenty of times. Trust me, I have changed my nephews diaper so many times! <br>  <br>  If I was you, I just would try not to worry about it.<br>  <br>  Hope this helps!

Relatives usually  laugh at you for everything and they probably will keep on doing it, but if she keeps seeing you naked, then that will cause other people to wonder about you.|`|8ac2e5cbdd946ee60c803052559873c5aa	Give me a break.  Any 29 year old with these issues needs psychological help.  Please get it now.<br>  <br>  I've got more news to share:  If she is your mother's sister, she has seen you fully naked many more times than that.  Probably changed some diapers and wiped a poopy butt or two, as well.  lol|`|jBigEy0Caa	I've seen my dad naked, yuck!  My SIL has caught him in the nude too, and we both laugh about it.  Shrug it off.  I'm sure she is not laughing at you and just at the situation.|`|UUrqECXIaa	How did that happen? Maybe she was just laughing because she was embarassed about the situation.

Do something extra sweet.  Or, just show him you love him through your everyday actions.  There's no one thing that is equivalent to "I love you."  So,  just be there, be supportive, be kind, and be loving.<br>  <br>  Or, then there's always other ways of saying it.<br>  I adore you.<br>  You mean a lot to me.<br>  I need you.<br>  I like you so much.<br>  I care so much about you.
SovaFpN8aa	If the wife's name is not on the accounts, she has no responsibility to pay. However, the credit card companies will file a claim with the husbands estate, to claim what they are owed. Contact the credit card company, explain that he has died, and negotiate a smaller payoff amount. They will be motivated because they will not have to "jump through the hoops" required to pursue a claim against his estate.|`|gfHutvEFaa	sorta. they will go after life insurances or what not to pay off the balances.<br>  <br>  they can't make you sell your house, give them your SS or deduct money from your check.<br>  <br>  Also, google it.|`|19118ef0907ef0b119cc1faefbfca6f1aa	Yes.

877c11ba0aaa509142a50e675e9f83c6aa	I don't think a break will help you.<br>  <br>  In a relationship, there is no "working things out separately." It just doesn't exist. You either do it together with honest and open communication or not at all. (And I mean honest and open..spill it all on the table and just talk through even the tiniest details so that you get it ALL of your chest and don't keep bringing it up in later arguments.) <br>  <br>  Communication doesn't mean you blame the other person for this, this and this that they did. Communication means you attack the problem, not the person. If you don't know what the problem is talk to him about how you feel, and vice versa until you can figure out what the problem is. <br>  <br>  If you both can't do this, a permanent break will do you guys both good because any lasting relationship NEEDS good communication.|`|NRQXmIcwaa	compromise.

I went through a windshield and was in a coma for almost a week a long time ago.  I had to relearn almost everything when I came out of the coma and now, years later, I still have no short term memory. I've just learned to compensate for that over the years and ways around other problems I've experienced from the accident.  There are sticky notes all over my house now and have been for years to remind myself of things I have to do.  It's the only way I remember anything but you just to make up for things so you can live your life as normally as possible.  Good luck with everything.  I hope everything works out for him.
s2JvJ5alaa	Just go up and start a conversation.<br>  Ask him his name and stuff because you've never seen him before.<br>  Ask him what he likes to do or if he plays any sports.<br>  Find a common interest.|`|0WHJhEXZaa	Hey Sis, there there..

1AdzD6bmaa	Don't tell him anything he doesn't need to know.  You've only been seeing him for a month.  If you're okay NOW...that is all he needs to know.|`|PPwsaeUxaa	The longer you wait the more you risk him being upset that you hid it from him for so long. If he already senses that something is amiss, then you might just want to tell him.<br>  <br>  Broach the subject with him in a neutral way without revealing any information about yourself. That will help you gauge how he feels about the issues. <br>  <br>  I wouldn't worry too much about it. Besides, if he really cares about you then it shouldn't matter so much. <br>  <br>  But then, you and he are young and you may want to consider the possibility that this new information might put him off and if it does then what is the chance that he will reveal your secret and gossip about you to others? I can't answer that, but you would have a better idea.|`|YV3Dh4lQaa	Since you have only been dating for a month, i wouldn't really get into detail with him. its not really hiding it, but you guys barely know each other, you don't want to unload everything on him at once.|`|s2JvJ5alaa	You need to tell him if you guys stay together for more than 4 months.<br>  Before then, it's probably too early. He might not be able to handle it.<br>  You need to develop a specific trust between the two of you before you just tell him something big about your past.|`|LO563QTnaa	i think u should tell him, if he had something like i'm sure u would wan't him 2 tell u. SO tell him n jus c how things go from there.!|`|eMSP740Taa	In my opinion, since you are only 15 years old and you have only been with him for a month, you shouldn't feel any pressure to tell him such a personal matter just yet. I mean, if you were a little older and you had been with him for a long time and wanted to move on to the "next level" in your relationship, then I would tell you that maybe it was time to open up about it. But at this early stage in your relationship, and at your age, I would say it isn't necessary to have to tell him. Just focus on your recovery and I'm sure I speak for all of us when I say that I am proud of you for not cutting and for starting to eat healthy. It is very important to take care of yourself. You should be very proud of your achievements. Keep up the GREAT work hun!! =]

C8DOT8Y7aa	Establish a more-than-just-friends relationship. Start by asking her for something to play on, like if you are in her class, ask her for a pencil or eraser. If she's slightly interested, she might play about, teasing you for it. Don't worry, it's not that she doesn't like you. She expects you to play along, so maybe walk off in mock sulk, don't do it too heavily though. She might start to think you are weird if you do. If she comes by you and asks you who you like, you know you are on the right track. They are probably just as nervous as you, so they want to get that type of approach as well. This probably means that they like you, and your job just got much easier. <br>  Compliment her, but be careful. Unless they are desperate, they might think you are desperate or making something too obvious. So maybe tell her you like her new hairstyle but then go behind her and mess around with it, spice it up. She'll like your courage to go play about with her hair but make sure she doesn't have dandruff or lice because although you might not be too bothered, she will get embarrassed and scared to go near you. Also, don't lay it on like you've seen in the movies: "I like your handbag.". No guy, in school, will honestly care about a handbag. Something you might truly like you can compliment on. <br>  Start a ball game (not literally). Be a little far away and look at her, admire her. She'll catch your gaze and look at you. Look away suddenly but keep an eye out for her looking back at you. If she is, get up and walk past her, possibly giving her a little smile as you go. <br>  Have chats with her. Ask her if she has any pets and find out some interesting things. Make sure she knows you inside out as well. <br>  Move in closer, be alone and look down. Look up at her eyes, look lost in her world for a second, and then say "I,(pause),like you. So...(cough)..Will you go out with me" While you say this look down. Look up when you say me and smile questioningly. If that isn't your style, there is another way to ask a girl out. All you have to do is walk up (make sure she's alone), and ask her to go out with you in a confident (but relaxed!) manner. <br>  Don't try too hard, girls aren't stupid, they can tell when you get desperate. Be relaxed and confident in yourself. <br>  Don't just become friends with her, become friends with all of her friends, as relationships are made and broken on her friends' opinions. <br>  If she says no, she means NO. Just back off for awhile, leave her to cool down, but don't give up complete hope. <br>  Be confident, not cocky. The difference is there, and very noticeable for girls. Make jokes and be self-confident; women love it when men make them laugh. <br>  When the time comes to ask her out, wait for the opportune moment. Trust your instincts; they will tell you when the time is right. As mentioned earlier, it's probably best not to do it in front of her friends or in front of your friends. It's easier for both of you if you are alone. <br>  If she says "I'll think about it" it's not a good sign, although she could just be nervous, or caught up in the moment, and she's being careful not to make a stupid mistake. Don't bug her about it, let it go a few days - if she doesn't bring it up again, it's a no. <br>  Don't ask her out as a dare, or as a joke - this can really hurt a girl's feelings. Be sure that you are doing it because you want to, if you don't you could really become known as a jerk. <br>  If you see any facial expressions, like an eye raise, make sure you say, "it's okay if you say no."

It seems as though you guys are better as friends so I think you should accept that and have fun with the friendship, or if that seems too hard, then you need to stop talking to him all together. Everything that you said above has been on his terms. He comes out of the blue and just grabs you and makes out with you like you are some object and that it's ok just because he says so and he is ready. <br>  <br>  What he did to you before was a dic* thing. He says he wants to go out with you, then he breaks up with you to go back to his ex, and even worse, says he will ask you back out again when he's over her. He is treating you like some toy and you dont deserve it.<br>  <br>  Dont give him the note. You've already put it all out there and he knows how you feel. You cant force someone to love you. If he cares about you and wants to be with you, he knows how you feel and will eventually come around, but you have to let it be on his terms. But to be honest, I'd work on moving on cause he doesnt have the best manners.|`|gxuMbZzdaa	I don't mean this to be insulting, but it sounds like your still in high school. In which case true love likely doesn't enter into it. <br>  <br>  My advice, however. He needs a bit of space. You need some too. Give him the note, but if he doesn't talk about it anymore, deal with it. <br>  If he doesn't want to be more than friends and not just make out with you, then eventually he will. If a guy wants you, he will do everything he can to be with you. If he isn't doing everything he can, then it's likely he isn't wanting to be with you. <br>  <br>  And if I'm right, and you are still in high school, you won't even remember this guys name in ten years.|`|I0vLqbMIaa	yes! give him the note! you're so brave to even do that...to let all your feelings out like that. good for you, girl! good luck!

Because of this, we are happily married and everyday he loves me more than ever as if we JUST got into a relationship!<br>  <br>  Seduction, if done right, is like chaining your guy to you - till death do both of you apart.<br>  <br>  Sometimes, we have to "cheat" by seducing to win our man, my dear sis. <br>  <br>  Here's the site that helped me on seducing my man back: <a href="http://xurl.jp/fcm" rel="nofollow">http://xurl.jp/fcm</a>|`|MHMndoCcaa	Dudes are sooo difficult...but to tell you the truth i broke up with my new bf who liked me soooo much because i wanted my ex...and my ex moved on....with another chik...so i mean...i want a guy to love me the way i love him and to be like my ex...but idkno...its just hard to move on.....thats all....so im like Alex....but idkno....just see how it goes....give him the note and tell him to stop messing with your head and to get real....and To STOP making excuses not to be with you|`|xcJwxyRRaa	Sweetie, you are trying to force what is not real.<br>  Do Not give him this note.<br>  He already knows you, what you want, what you want from him and he just isn't feelin it bc it's being forced on him. You already stated he has tried a couple of times to feel it for you and it's not happening. <br>  Give him the gift of missing you for a while. Just be there for him but don't be around him or call, text, IM email. let him be himself and when he is ready to like you, come to you or just be a friend , it's really up to him now isn't it?<br>  If someone was writing this "note" to you wouldn't you feel some pressure or kinda weird about it?<br>  I think you're in love with the idea of bring in love someday. You have plenty of time ..after all time is ALL we DO have, huh?<br>  You can't hurry love, like or anything..it has to happen in it's own time.<br>  sound good?
Lg53hDHraa	Be friends with her. Text her, talk to her, ask her what she's interested in.|`|JIvvg6f7aa	give her money thats how I bought my wife. I mean got my wife to like me. She was on page 5 of the cataloge.|`|O9VN7SGiaa	start talking to her, and hanging out a little bit, and once you get to know her more tell her how u feel about her and ask if she feels the same way (:|`|oOD3dYaNaa	Just go up to her and say "Hey! What's up?" Even saying that could be the start of something amazing. <br>  And what's the worst that she could say? No? What human being says no to another saying hello? LOL <br>  <br>  But anyway, then just keep the conversation going from there. Ask her questions that don't have a yes or no answer, because that'll keep her talking to you. Like "So how's your day?" and stuff like that. She'll think you're nice and sweet. And you'll definitely have her attention. =]|`|S4VVE0onaa	well talk to her get to be friends first and see where it leads.<br>  most girls can't tell the difference between a guy that is into her or who is just friendly in general.|`|f3xNSnGkaa	just hang out with her. try to be her friend first. increase the things u do together. she would want to know u first b4 she likes u. be patient as this may take a couple months|`|30Hk5bazaa	be nice|`|USFXA2juaa	go grab her **** <br>  if she turns round and lamps you one: run<br>  if she turns and smiles or laughs: grab her tit, right hand on left tit<br>  if she then lamps you: run<br>  if she continues to smile laugh or moan: grab her hand pull her to one side and tell her how much u like her|`|MHMndoCcaa	You can't force someone to like you back, it just has ta happen naturally...but just be yourself, try and talk to her, and make her laugh...get her number, try and txt her, if possible...and flirt a little|`|kqYiyAvLaa	Show her yer weewee and if she likes it she'll date you xD<br>  <br>  ahahahahahahaaaa but really just be nice.|`|z1nk2d9Qaa	ask her if she want to go on a date to the movies to a resturant ect...<br>  then she can really get to know you and could start liking you|`|g9gre5ADaa	talk to her<br>  <br>  and shave ur pubs

Is your 'boyfriend' mistreating you or you just want to talk to someone else?
wPD3BGEHaa	Yes, she's cute but you should not post someones pic online without their approval..I just did that and my friend is not speaking to me...think about it.|`|707gOCvbaa	Her looks should not decide if you risk your friendship or not. He probably gets pissy because he wants every girl he sees and I know a lot of guys like that. If she's available and you want to make a go for her then do it. It's either you or Art and there can be only one. good luck.|`|SbiNNM3Caa	she's hot<br>  your best friend (guy) is an *** hole<br>  but hey what can you do....<br>  try to talk to him about it<br>  if he's really your best friend then you guys should be able to confront each other without violence or ignorance<br>  weather your gonna tk a shot at her or not you just gotta have that talk with him<br>  so he knows that your really into this girl<br>  ----if he is a true friend then he'll tell you to go for her (since he already has girlfriends)<br>  -----and if he still acts lk an *** (even though your being mature and serious) then well you know what to do ;-)<br>  good luck<br>  nothing comes before a bestie<br>  but mk good and sure that he IS your bestie<br>  peace|`|O9VN7SGiaa	your friends just jealous. i would tell him to suck it if hes ganna be like that to you. and if i were you i would just go for the girl.|`|Un9CElCaaa	no girl is worth ruining a friendship|`|i06nDWSvaa	It sounds to me like Art is afraid of losing your friendship.  He isn't used to you having a girlfriend so he doesn't know what might happen between you.  Ask him why he is being an a** when you talk about her. First, I believe friends are more important than trying to cultivate a girlfriend/boyfriend situation.  BUT, on the other hand, if he isn't supportive of your happiness, how good a friend is he? You and Art need to have a good talk.  If you don't hurry up and ask her out he might beat you to the punch! If he does that then 'can' the friendship!|`|X3GjiecGaa	well if he gets all pissy obviously he likes her. u can looka t it like this<br>  <br>  1.

Ask him whats the problem with you talking to her?|`|qbvjOFvHaa	go for it. if he is your real friend he wont care especially since he has so many girls of his own|`|Mubj1o2eaa	Hey, is she pretty? Yes. But thats no reason what so ever to ask if shes worth it because of looks. Thats just shallow and if she finds out about it, you wont only ruin it with her, but you'll ruin it with your friend too. It's whats on the inside that counts. And to act like that, maybe you don't deserve either. But if you really want my help, hes not a real friend if hes mad because you like one girl. If he already has a lot of girlfriends, it sounds like hes a player. And if hes being that way to you, hes going to be like that in the future. A controling friend is not a fun friendship. So you need to try and think what is more important to you right now. Do you value the friendship, or the girl more?
n1LWkT0paa	Hes probably still used to pulling out. You can reassure him that its safe to stay in and he will probably do so. He might not right away but he will soon. Most guys prefer to stay in anyway:P|`|LS8LcuRaaa	Sounds like you've been doing this even before you got pregnant and he might just be used it that way.|`|HR79w5Ziaa	I think he is bothered by the fact that you are pregnant, maybe he just wants to anyways..

vGZte26Eaa	You should do nothing. This girl know in her heart that her boyfriend can't be trusted. If he did it once he will do it again. Your friend did nothing wrong.  Let it die a natural death and don't contact this girl anymore.|`|4XCg1mIMaa	ignore this girl and move on......that's all u can do........if she is making threats to harm her physically I would have your bestie contact the police....Nissa|`|HtwhcFdfaa	This girl obviously doesn't want to blame her boyfriend who is REALLY at fault.<br>  <br>  So she's going after your friend.<br>  <br>  She's probably just mad at her BF but won't admit it.|`|bmJxgKADaa	confront the gf and tell her to back off b4 things get ugly just ACT like your serious but remember violence is NOT THE ANSWER|`|oNkxVdSjaa	I'll pray for you..That is pure bitchy though..forgive and forget..that's what i'd say..|`|A9bSNTwTaa	Blogs are not about being mature- they're classic  for venting on problems and just being emotional.  She's looking for a reaction because her life sucks.<br>  <br>  Your friend sound like a ( kind of easily led) Lady at heart- so don't take the blog too seriously because it makes everyone look like an emotional wreck when they just want to express what they're thinking but would never do. <br>  <br>  If this problem persists  send off a calm email to the fit pitcher and express your ( real or not) sympathies and point out what she's flipping about is somebody's life being ruined for no reason.
3Tc8Aol5aa	tell him your gonna give him space until he can give you what you need, which is someone who will be fully committed to you and treat you right.|`|YFs3fowHaa	Well if I was ignoring a girl, then I probably have "friends" that have told me some things. Do his friends know you perosnally? Or maybe you started too fast. That whole "I Love You" stuff, ease up a little on that. No guy wants to rush into a relationship. Just don't call him; Have him call you and a day or even two may go by, but that will only make him miss you more. <br>  <br>  Good Luck|`|vGZte26Eaa	I would give him a few days.  If he doesn't call you, you know the answer and need to move on.  If he calls you, act normal but stop talking about love, etc.  That makes some boys uncomfortable.  If you take the pressure off, he may want to be around you more.|`|b7yvPsiVaa	He obviously liked you but once he realized he has to be COMMITED to you now he is freaking out. <br>  He is going to dump you, girl. Don't be exited when he calls. It won't be good news. Beat him to the punch it will make you feel better :)|`|LLapx5x3aa	Maybe he got hit with some bad news. But either way, if he doesn't wanna clue you in on his thought process, i would say find someone that will. No point in waiting around for him to pull his head out his butt, to realize maybe he has someone that can help.|`|wvsPOFY4aa	It depends on what type of person he is. Maybe he avoids you cause he is shy... or is cheating on you. He might not say "i love you" back, because he might feel awkward saying that, its not his style o__O...|`|pHSo9DPMaa	he might break up with you but he might just be thinking about something else. or he might be thinking that he likes u but he also likes someone else too..|`|8JgFKfpUaa	I hate to tell you this, but maybe he has something big on his mind and thinks he doesn't have time to love another.<br>  But then again, he may just be trying to think of something to say...idk<br>  but everything will work out!!!<br>  I promise!!!|`|lMu2J3pNaa	he wants to break up....same thing happened to me....<br>  he might be confused about something and its distracting him from the relationship...just end it|`|UTCkWYl1aa	He is seeing someone else and doesnt know how to tell you you need to break up with him and find someone new|`|a2FHCgetaa	It must be YOU.

I think he wants to break up with you but doesn't want to be a jerk.  If this keeps going on, break up with him (I mean, if you don't too much).  Besides, you've only been going out with him for a few days.  Might as well end the relationship if it isn't going anywhere.|`|foKDFigOaa	Well tell him that while he's "thinking" your going to go find a different boyfriend. A good boyfriend doesn't avoid you.

Make him miss you when your gone.|`|5uEAHEQJaa	Boys never know how to come out and say they want out of the relationship.

Tell her you like her alot and want to take her out and spoil her rotten like she friggin deserves.  She will love you and BAM you'll have her.  End of story.  You guys need to think before you ask these questions.  Remember, everyone loves attention!  Go get her tiger!  Call her up and ask her to the movies or something you know she will like.  Girls loved to be wooed.  She's teasing you because she likes you.  If she didnt like you, she wouldnt bother with you.  Dont you get it?  She's a free agent and can flirt with every guy she feels like flirting with.  Put 2 and 2 together, mate.|`|143f9530216dfb9e78a759118b56a704aa	Just tell her: for me now you are more than a friend, you know?<br>  And kiss her.<br>  Then you will know.<br>  Just do it|`|rj57MKHYaa	well you can NEVER convince a girl to like you if she does not. you may think you can but let me say again you can NEVER no matter how hard you try. she likes you or she don't i don't mean to be rude but lots of people ask this and i even wonder about this. maybe she does like you but is hiding it or just teasing you because she wants to. hope this helps.<br>  <br>  P.S. dont change if she dont like you if she dont like you it wasnt ment to be. (learned that from a great guy)
cJZL83pLaa	If you and him love each other to death, what are you doing looking for other guys???? Of course, he'll be hurt. If you can see your future together, why not stay together so that you'd at least have a chance of it coming true? Right now, you're showing him that you're not very committed to him and that he may like you more than you like him.<br>  <br>  If I were you, I'd continue being with him and laugh and smile together. Only if something very bad or un-fixable comes along, then it will be over and I will move on. Don't start some love triangle. Not only will you hurt yourself, but you will hurt the boy more than the pain inflicted on you. I don't understand why you'd want to dump such a perfect guy. Don't let your selfish ways takeover. You date one guy at a time. Like I said before, only if things don't work out with him and you break up, THEN you go for other guys.|`|jr9iEmuoaa	no, its not wrong.<br>  just when you graduate from highschool & you both go to different colleges, break up with him and say that you need to experience other people. if you dont like what you see with the other, go back to him!
i6Ix28IPaa	Not me, thank God!  Seems like a lot of posters on Y!A are in this predicament, though.  Tough situation--usually a result of bad decisions that stem from insecurities and immaturity.  <br>  <br>  These days it seems that females are in such a hurry to get married and have the "happily ever after" fantasy.  When reality sets in, they are ill-prepared for it.|`|OHfZFR31aa	Nobody is really stuck. They make a choice to stay.<br>  <br>  If you get divorced, you are entitled to half of what you earned in common when you were married, so you won't have no money. And there is no reason you can't get a job. You don't need job skills to work in a grocery store, fast food restaurant, cleaning hotel rooms or lots of other entry level or unskilled jobs. It's not tons of money, but it's more than welfare. And like everyone else, you have to start at the bottom and work your way up.|`|SHARt1k3aa	Nobody is stuck.  All I hear is no this no that ... well, get some then.  Get a job, get a car, and put your ducks in a row so you can leave.  Stop being a victim!  I mean, it drives me crazy when women depend on a man so much that they have no self worth!  My god, get a back bone and start to take care of yourself.  Every one has skills they can be paid for.  And if you don't, go to a tech school, that's quick and you can get in and out and start working.  Stop feeling sorry for yourself.  You can't hold anyone responsible for your happiness, you have to be responsible for your own happiness, so start doing something about it, other than feel sorry for yourself.|`|pfisYml0aa	no, i dont feel that way at all, but thanks for asking.|`|fH1RYFjUaa	There's ALWAYS a way out if you try hard enough. I was in a similar difficult situation--bad marriage, no close family, no friends. It wasn't easy to say the least, but to stay would have been even worse. Try your local social services or churches to help.|`|NeTNnvSZaa	It's an excuse to be lazy in my opinion.  If it were truly that bad you would leave.  My bet is you're too afraid of not having enough money, not to live on but to get the extras that so many have become addicted to.  It's amazing what you can do when you don't have a choice.|`|4HoVVCenaa	I can't leave because my honor won't let me.

Otherwise you will always be wondering 'what might have been' and trust me when I say, that is the worst feeling in the world.<br>  <br>  Invite him out somewhere and tell him, who knows you maybe be rejected, but you may end up with the best relationship you ever had.

Why? It sounds like he was just trying to make a joke. Not a very good one, but not so bad as to be offended!
RIsNmubSaa	It depends on where you go.  Many bridal shops will have at least a dress style or two in any size offered by a designer to help gage a size.  They will use that in combination with your measurements to determine the best size once you've settled on a specific dress.  <br>  <br>  Just like other women's cloths, wedding dress sizes will vary from designer to designer.  Unfortunately, women's sizes aren't as universal as they should be.  I found that the dress I bought lined up pretty well with the dress size I typically wear. But one of my bridesmaids found she needed a dress a size smaller than what she normally buys. The style of dress you select will have a lot to do with this. If you want a dress with a fuller skirt or a ball gown style, start out with whatever size top you typically wear.  If you want something more hip hugging start with whatever size skirt you buy. The sales person who helps you should be able to adjust up or down from there.  <br>  <br>   But I wouldn't worry too much about size when you are dress shopping. A good Bridal shop will be able to let you try on nearly any dress style and let you see what it will look like on you even if they don't have it in your exact size.  Remember, the dress you try on might not be the right size, but once you're done with all the fittings the dress you buy will be.|`|4POGapREaa	Wedding dresses run really small.  When I was shopping for mine I was about a US size 4 in street clothes & I had to buy a size 8 in my wedding dress.  Unfortunately I gained weight & ended up exchanging that for a size 10.  Most of the stores I went to had 8's & 10's.  The bigger chain stores like David's Bridal had more sizes & were actually organized by size going up to like 26 or something.|`|rzPIO1aQaa	Lets see I am a a size 5 and I wear a medium shirt. When I went dress shopping I went to an 11 talk about making me feel fat even though I am not. I don't know many places where you can walk out with a dress. The dress I had originally wanted was at Alfred Angelo's but they didn't sale anything off the shelf and it would take to long to get. and I called a lot of other places in town as well and they all ordered them when you found the dress you wanted. The only store I found where you can buy right off the shelf if your dress is available in that style was Davids Bridal. I walked out with my dress that day.|`|rTibvdiVaa	the largest size they usually have is 11/12, but they have a lot of other smaller sizes. they usually carry like 4-5 dresses of the same size, different styles.

14tr16uuaa	Your going to have to tell at some point that you don't have time/interest to listen to her rant and rave about her asinine problems. Or else you will just flip out on her one day because you kept it pent up for so long.<br>  <br>  I'd try calmly and rationally explaining to her that you would rather talk about other things. Control the conversation, make it about your day. She will eventualy lose interest and 'have to go.'<br>  <br>  She will start talking about you behind your back because that is what she does. And the truth is if she talks to everyone like she talks to you; they already know shes a liar! Let her run her mouth, at the end of the day no one will believe her and you have a husband to back you up!<br>  <br>  Hope this helped, Good Luck!|`|SxqYguUCaa	Ignore her calls(:<br>  <br>  No really, Just try to tell her you get busy a lot and can't handle the calls. If it really bothers you, tell her the truth, After all you said you hate liars!
3y0w1qIBaa	Well, in my opinion, I am attracted to both of them.  Personality is what makes them unique.  It may depends on some guys if they want to go for looks or personality.  Sometimes, it's a little bit of both.|`|AA11899313	'Chemistry' ~ between the two.  From there, all else flows.<br>  <br>  <br>  Sash.|`|Cbom3Lweaa	I think personality goes a long way. However, I think looks are also important; you can be friends with someone who has got a good personality. However when it comes to a relationship I'd want someone by my side who was reasonably good looking and had a good personality. So I'd go for a bit of both.|`|c9c6ba4e6a773b109f77d912d6322ccaaa	Sincerely, I care about both appearances and personality.

Even if one person in the relationship doesnt care about looks, if the other person is obsessed with looks or a particular aspect and that makes them unhappy, then it will be in the interest of the other person, too, as it is also part of the obsessed person's personality. Complex things, them relationships.<br>  <br>  What is more important though... personality, every time. Looks can be taken away instantly and then what do you have? Nothing.|`|68a1e5dbdd5ec20b337195fe1d2b54ddaa	A twist of the two.  Kind of like a manual transimission in the car its gotta be a balance of the two.

XojxC4xxaa	All I can say is--You are who you want to be.  You are not who your parents are, and you are not who your brother is.  You can be whatever you want to be.  And in these ugly situations in life, we may just feel like lying down and dying.  But in these ugly situations, there is always a good and beautiful thing that will bloom from them.  <br>  <br>  You can be the person of your family who succeeds in life, who blooms like a beautiful flower.|`|be7cnxhIaa	Ok sweetie breathe!<br>  I know what your going through i just recently lost 3 family members to death. and my life turned to **** i started experiencing the exact same things you did. and my family went from perfect to **** in one day! At first i handled it really stupidly i started cutting myself i did this for almost 5 months.<br>  My- parents didn't know<br>  My two older brothers-were doing drugs<br>  i knew my brothers were doing drugs but they didn't know i knew but they anticipated it. So the one day when my Eldest brother left to go outside and smoke some weed with my second eldest brother and his friend I said have fun smoking weed. He turned looked at me and then ran out and came back a minute later and ignored me. But later on my second eldest brother(who I'm way closer to) texted me asking why i thought he was doing weed. At first i thought was i wrong? but i decided i wasn't but we got in a huge fight and he came home to talk to me and we sat down and bickered for a moment and then something really amazing happened we started talking like really talking. in one of the txts i sent him i think i slipped in a hell or god damn or something like that. and he asked me when i started talking like that and i simply said i didn't do it around our parents and then he started talking to me about what it was going to be like when i went to high school with him next year. and we got onto the subject of drugs and he asked me if i'd ever seen weed and i said no so we went to his room and he showed me some and we talked for over an hour about how we need to have each others backs and all that stuff and he admited to me that he was high at that very moment and that i had been right the whole time. Then he asked me something i didn't expect if i wanted to do it with him. i said no only because our parents would be home soon and i didn't want to be high with them around. But after that conversation i found out so much about my brothers and some of the stuff that happened right under my nose and I'm a lot closer to my brother for this. Now I'm not telling you that you need to go smoke pot with your brother and all that stuff but talk to him i thought i had no one to lean on but i do now my brothers. And i'm proud to say i don't cut anymore. Which hell it's probly not a good trade to some of you cutting to weed but hell i'm kid. It gets the stress away and I have my brothers now. I'm happy =)<br>  <br>  (Ok so this is a repli to your email) No i'm not telling you to smoke pot and i said that in my answer. And yes i know i can die from it or **** up my life more, but it works for me. I was saying talk to your brother about it not go and smoke with him! And if you really want to be someone then...Haha well I can't answer that because i have no clue. I know what drugs/alchol does to people i have alcholics in my family. And to clarify I'm not telling you to smoke pot but i'm also saying it didn't throw my life off track. I'm an all A B student and so is my Bro hell my bro is a baseball/football player and one of the best on his team. Also i don't do drugs hard-core just a little here and there. But i guess it seems less dramatic to me because it seems like such a better trade compared to cutting But thats just me. You'll find what makes your life better it doesn't have to be such dramatics has breaking the law, but stuff like sports teams or hanging out with friends. Hope that helps your confusion!! :P|`|Y5pDh9ryaa	listen i probably don't how feel right now but i hope my advice helps. im sorry that your parents are alcoholics and what other problems your brother might have too. but you have got alot goning on in your life right now like parents,family,homework,grades,friends,a... afterschool activitys. that might be why you are so confused about most things. also maybe you should discuss this with someone you feel most comfortable with, i know you said like you can't trust anyone any more but there must be someone. it would be good if you talked to someone  and to be free to be yourself and express how you feel. you hide your feelings because you don't want anyone to see whats really going on in your head but if you keep hiding your frustion is gonna get bigger and bigger. thats why you feel that you have no one to lean on. sometimes its good to see what is goning on the inside. you are very confused about life because you have all these things going on in your head. i wish you the best of luck to you and your family. i hope my advice helped. also i hope everything turns out ok.
ViK719Gkaa	I don't know what he is like but as for myself I would very much like that however I would be careful with what I apologize for. <br>  <br>  Ask if he is still to busy with work, if so just call every once in a while just to talk for a short time. I mean just to keep in touch as a friend and don't expect more. It's nice to have a babe for a friend. <br>  <br>  DO NOT GROVEL!! Not that you would, just be a friend and tell him sometimes I get a little frustrated. He will understand, that is if he's the kind of man you want. But than I don't know what kind of man you want. What I mean is there is the kind of man you 'say you want' and there is the kind of man that is not that way but your subconscious will  draw you to and you will give your self to, even though concisely you would never do such a thing. It's just what you need and for some reason a man like that will resonate deep inside, I'm sure you can feel it. <br>  <br>  Any way good luck baby and I hope you get what you need.|`|ZndKWmTHaa	Hi - yes a guy would appreciate this but be careful how you do it, by all means say sorry but explain why and put some terms in place if he wants to start up again - play a bit hard to get and ensure that he is prepared to make you an important part of his life.<br>  <br>  Hope this helps|`|yHoMTLZHaa	Yes!|`|FGa7V6ODaa	yeah id like it its nice to hear a girl say sorry for once!|`|kLK2peV1aa	Sure!!!

You should really trust your heart on this one.  The avoidance may be due to the fact that he might actually not like you, BUT it could also very well be that he is truly busy.  I have a 5 year old boy that I have full custody of; there's this girl Rebecca, I have not called in weeks; I would LOVE to maybe start a relationship with her, but inside I feel down and crappy over the fact that even if I DID call her, going out and dating is almost impossible as she has 2 children of her own, we both have busy work schedules, etc.  And its not like I can make time for it.  Im usually off work at 4-5 pm, then I get home usually by 6 pm and by that time, its too late to drive 85 miles one way, go out for an hour or two, drive 85 miles back home, then expect my little 5 year old to get get up at 6 am the next morning.... its just not possible.  Hope this helps!|`|lPXscuKSaa	He might be a nice bloke Nina but he is to wrapped up in other things and he probably always will.

T5v2JqfBaa	i hear you gurl..what you should do first is REFLECT. think and analyze yourself first why you are feeling this way. weigh your options and its best to communicate with your partner. but analyze the situation first before confronting coz if you dont, you might just end up squabbling over stuff that you both dont understand. ask yourself, why is it that we are drifting apart?..what's the cause? or if you can still compromise. Probably you guys just need space, who knows?.. sometimes couples need time and space to better understand theirselves and to improve their approach to relationships. Its true that no matter what, if you guys are meant for each other, things will eventually work out in the right time. Relationships need to grow coz if not, it is not a healthy relationship. Just a piece of advice for you.|`|ru89rMEmaa	dang I just went through this myself ok. Sounds like what was happening to me.

dFHkSkCpaa	Dont worry about it.<br>  I lost my dad two years ago, and when I found out the news I didnt cry at all. He was my best friend, and we spent a lot of time together, but I couldnt cry. There or at the funeral. It will probably come at a later time. You could be suffering from shock, or your body just might not know how to react. Its easier to cry for friends because you spend a lot of time with them, and its easier to notice that missing person. With family it feels like they might just be coming home late. I still feel that. So dont worry, its the common reaction. Its hard because its harder for you to face.|`|nGhqwEdpaa	Its probably because you spend more time with your friends, you feel closer to them. Don't feel bad about it though, its a normal thing.

There is just to much pressure on your generation to have sex for the sake of getting it done--how awful!<br>  <br>  Sex is an amazing thing when it is with someone to whom you are committed, and when you are ready.

I think its a good thing to wait until you find that 'special someone'.  There is a reason having sex is called 'making love', and that reason doesn't involve a girl who has had 15 'lovers' in the last 2 months.  Hold out until you meet the girl who you actually WANT to do this with.  <br>  <br>  I'm 18, and i just recently lost my virginity, but i have known this girl my entire life, we have been friends since we were 4, and 3 years ago we start going out.  After knowing her for that long, i felt comfortable with her.  I didn't do what half of the guys i know did in High School, and just go find the local whore, and get into her pants.

If he got mad at you for messing with his mind at that time you would not know whether it was because he was mad at you or just because he was sick. I would stay away from him when he was sick because I would not want to catch what he has, but you could say to him that you hope he feels better soon and that you want to talk to him after he feels better--that would get his positive attention, knowing that you care.|`|l1iMHPK5aa	I'm a girl and I wouldn't really do that to my crush.

f5FmJRfIaa	If you've been on the pill for 9 months, I don't understand what you're worried about.  Getting pregnant on your period happens once in awhile, but if you're on the pill you should be protected anyway.  If you're really weirded out, you can take plan b for up to 3 days after unprotected sex.  If you're worried about getting pregnant even though you are on the pill, maybe you should read up about different methods of birth control, and how they work, and also how your body works.

wovoZ5Z0aa	I see a question mark, but can't really pick out your question.  It sounds like you're unsure of how he feels about you, and unsure of how you feel about him.  <br>  <br>  A wise man once told me, "decide what you want, and what you should do will become obvious." (B.K.Preslar)  Do YOU want to date HIM?  If you don't, then there is no problem.  You don't want to date, and you're not.  <br>  <br>  If you DO want to date him, then you'll need to get him attracted more.  You noticed something important when he paid more attention to you when you paid attention to other guys.  Jealousy is a very powerful emotion.  Some people think that it is the most powerful motivator that we have.  Flirt with other guys, but include him in the interaction if you can.  <br>  <br>  Playing hard to get is an old trick.  It has been kept around for so long because it works.  Just be careful that you don't hurt innocent guys in the process.
IiHTk7ZHaa	I doubt there will be any good, I'm talking from personal experience and what I've seen in other relationships. I doubt she's ready to get anywehre and he's always going to have issues. She cheated on him and I'm uncertain that he's going to be able to forgive her so fast! <br>  What if another guy comes along when he's 'unavailable' again? <br>  The only way for the relationship to work out is to start slowly from the bottom and work their way up in terms of trust and everything and working out suitable times for the both of them. She needs to talk to him more, give him feedback on how she's feeling, what is causing them to abstract and he should do the same in order for there to be any progress. <br>  <br>  If you want something, leave her alone for a while, she needs to figure out what she wants first. She likes you but she wants him too, and she has strong emotions so you're the rebound guy. Sorry to say it, it's how I see the situation right now. The moment he says yes, she's going to forget all about you and you'll just be that great supportive friend that was there for her.<br>  <br>  In my case, I had one boyfriend we were together and then he found someone else and when I found out things got bad and then she found out about me and he was left with no-one, and then he did everything to get me back because he would end up being alone. You need to give her time and be supportive, explain to her how he's not going to condone so easily and that she needs to learn to move on. What made her cheat in the first place? She should understand that it can happen again.<br>  <br>  Another case though different, I was friends with a guy for 2 years and we had one night together, as a date, and I never heard from him again. I later found out that he got a girlfriend soon after and that they were together for some 2 years and now, 5 years later, he's trying to get me back, and I know the situations slightly different, but I was hurt and there was no way I would go back to him. No matter how much he may beg and plead, it's hard, I'm not a weak person to give in like that. <br>  <br>  He might fall for her and think she's changed and she's realized the error of her ways and that the whole time she was with the other guy she was thinking of him well I see that as one reason he might change his mind, if any, but I doubt that he will and I wouldn't advise to be with a person like that. <br>  Not until you are sure they don't have all that emotional baggage with them, or at least no interest in their ex. If you two ever decide to go for it ask her one thing. If he walked in here right now and asked you to be with him, would you? Make sure she's over him completely before going anywhere, and be a part of her life, don't be too controlling, but to some extent you need to know what she's doing and what direction she expects, what if she does the same to you? Just be careful with the situation. There is never a reason to cheat, if you're unhappy, you quit! You don't go hurting people. Good luck!<br>  <br>  Sorry for writing so much, sometimes I get carried away, haha!|`|TLQsMu1raa	No I do not think that is the best plan....because of their issues with each other Im guessing that there will be a large amount of trust issues, it happens a lot, if you really like her tell her you don't want to see her get hurt, and tell her how you feel. say if this is what will make her happy, your happy. She will love you for being there for her when she needed it :) I wish you the best of luck <br>  <br>  Hope this helps, Kory
SovaFpN8aa	It is insecurity on our part. We have become vulnerable to this person because we have opened our heart to them. If they betray us, it will tear us emotionally. We took a risk, we took a big chance, and now we are afraid we will get hurt.<br>  The self doubt creeps in, "what if I am not good enough for this person to continue to Love"|`|HKkbqlIuaa	When people are insecure in anyway, which most are, they are very afraid to lose that person. Therefore, they subconsciously start controlling them, in prevention of their cheating on them or finding someone better. <br>  We don't like to find our significant other in the bed with someone else because it hurts. I have made a commitment to my fiance to be with him and only him for the rest of my life. If ever during that period would I find him cheating, I would be very upset. 1. He destroyed all trust I had for him. 2. He put myself and himself at risk for disease and/or pregnancy with another woman. 3. I have held back from all of my temptations and lustful thoughts, but apparently for nothing. 4. It's embarrassing for me. <br>  No it is not their body that people try and possess. It is their love that we are trying to control. Many people, women at least, think that if they control them, then they won't ever leave them. Those who are controlling are either SEVERELY jealous (usually men) or very insecure (usually women).|`|NCvvwPEdaa	Possessiveness is definately for someone we love and care about. We dont want them to be with people who are not worth them or dont care about them as you do. You want them only for you and dont want them to be influenced by people your partner is with.|`|th7C1aoaaa	why ask why|`|2tMJIVSEaa	Its what makes us HUMAN im afraid.<br>  Great as it is it can wreck lives.|`|eoHgZpPZaa	It is actually society that makes us feel this way. In many other countries, they do not put as much weight in romantic love as we do, and therefore do not feel the same sort of jealousy. There are actually cultures with members sleeping with a different person in town almost every night, even if they are married. The married couples have love for each other, but they were raised under a different standard and therefore do not feel the pain of the "wrong" they are performing.<br>  As a monogamous society, we have a difficult time understanding we are actually the minority in population. True, many polygamous relationships can become possessive of the members within the household regarding outsiders, but they have an understanding within the house that life is just carried on that way and they accept it.|`|0tL4zgTPaa	I think its totally natural.......and not your fault at all!!!!!!!!<br>  its obvious to be possessive........it shows how much you love dat person and how much you care for that person.......<br>  but do not be over possessive as it may cause problems in the relationship as i have seen many of my friends break up as their loved ones have become over possessive......<br>  just remember that she loves you and will always be yours........|`|r5w32XFHaa	sometimes its insecurity... when v r in love the other person becomes a part of us... no matter if v r physical or not... & that is what which makes us possesive abt the other...|`|8ac2e5cbdd946ee60c803052559873c5aa	WE don't all do this.  SOME of us fight that instinct, because we recognize it for the damaging instinct that it is.  It is a need to control others and we come into the world with it.<br>  <br>  You have made one illogical leap here.  Not wanting our partner to cheat isn't from the same controlling instinct as  possessiveness.  <br>  <br>  Although possessiveness in a relationship comes from a need to control another person, wanting our partner to be faithful comes from somewhere else, and it is a good place.  These needs are loyalty, fidelity, faithfulness.  These are GOOD things and we should not confuse them with jealousy and possessiveness which are BAD.  Loyalty, fidelity and faithfulness make relationships stronger.  Jealousy and possessiveness destroy relationships.  See the difference?
NyB4JfWCaa	Hey sweets!<br>  There is NOTHING worse than what you are feeling now- we do all get very badly hurt though.<br>  My ex told me he loved me so much and that he could not explain it blah blah blah.

I unblocked him and called him a couple days at 2am cuz I missed him, and a girl answered his phone and told me he is her man and has been for a while. I couldn't believe it so I checked things out for myself and I found out that he had been cheating on me with her for a month.

You can be cute and flirty without wearing overly revealing clothes|`|e276df96c55a338c1e69a8869d0cd199aa	If you don't want him to see you as a ****, then quit acting like one.  Wearing low cut tops and leaning over so he can see down your shirt is slutty.  Obviously, you are advertising to him that you would let him do what he wants.|`|LaE7ksIaaa	Maybe, uhh, don't go with the low cut shirts.<br>  <br>  Especially if you're doing it just to keep his attention. If he likes you, he won't care about how much boob you're showing.|`|TNjKwlA9aa	I think it's half and half. There's a chance he might like sluts though. HAHA.
cJ01b9Fhaa	Well, if you guys hang out or just chill alone.. Make that first move. Talk about things that would lead up to kissing. Or just say,"look I want to do something and I want us both to have an open mind." and just kiss the guy!
Bbfaqawbaa	GOOD Idea<br>  <br>  For Male : Hiv , Hbsag , Hcv<br>  For Female : Hiv , Hbsag , Hcv , Pap smear|`|4a3a7d2a2bd6aa1d3814d6d9e39a668daa	yes, yes,yes!!!<br>  i actually made my husband get a blood test to make sure he didnt have any disease or std's. i did this before we got married and way before our first sexual intercourse... it better to prevent than to regret.|`|tGlnumvKaa	YES!!!<br>  <br>  Blood tests are required in some states to check for STDs. Also, you want to make sure you're healthy in case you decide to have kids soon.|`|a026394b1571d2c430767a9dde2844deaa	Not every state requires that. I live in Wisconsin and when I got married we didn't have to do anything medical before we got married.|`|th7C1aoaaa	YES. Blood test for everything. This way if you or her get something later. You know it happened after marriage.
Lzk24WGcaa	Yea. I'll take a shot at it.  I want to let you know that you are the most sexy woman I have ever seen on Y/A.  You are totally hot.  When I get stressed out, I think about what people would say if I took off all of my clothes and streaked down the office hallways.  You have the looks that would make most people's day if you were to do that.<br>  <br>  I think you could have any man (or woman) you wanted.
nGhqwEdpaa	Well, 13 is 13. Some are more immature than others. Maybe if you pull her aside and have a "girl" chat with her and explain the things she does, how they make you feel and how it makes her look. She probably doesn't realize the extent or annoyance of it. Just be kind when you talk, so she doesn't feel she has to get defensive with you. Gotta love her. shes your cousin. :-) Good luck hun|`|evEJxv06aa	talk to her tell how she annoys you a lot make her understand that sometimes you need to have your personal space to your self right.|`|sPtRjRBEaa	Tell her what shes like but to be honest shes just a normal 13 year old girl. Good Luck :) x
veZLfnGFaa	Keep a copy of the email that he sent to his ex.  He admitted that his marriage is not what he wanted, so you need to talk to him and decide what you are going to do.  The trust is gone - and it isn't your fault. Sorry - but it sounds like you were second choice.|`|CWgJ7Yyxaa	I think you should think things over carefully.<br>  IF you love him and want to try to save your marriage, go to counseling. Both by yourself and as a couple.<br>  <br>  Get a good lawyer's advice, as well. <br>  Talk to your family if you decide you want to go back to your country, because you will need their support.<br>  <br>  Good luck. It does sound like he is in love with her...Sorry.|`|HzCBOwlyaa	ok if they arent sleeping together than forget it , he was married to her and she was his first wife right? so of course there are going to be feelings there and maybe he was just saying sorry for things he hadnt admitted to her from the past.just dont make waves into oceans ..relax and calm down you have a child together.and you are a woman so most likely you will get the child or at least half.|`|1k7LIZVWaa	You have to weigh the pros and cons and decide what is best for you.  First, it was wrong of you to snoop.  Now that the truth is out in the open, you should suggest counseling.  If you can discuss this issue and find out where his heart really is, perhaps you can move forward from there.  If he is really wanting to be with the ex fiancee, he should be willing to give you custody or go for joint custody.  You wouldn't want to stay with someone who didn't really love you would you?  That is no environment to raise a child in either.  Be honest with one another and yourself.  The custodial parent would not be able to move the child from the country.  If you choose to go back to your home country, you are making a choice to not see your son anymore.  It's your call.  Can't you make your life work there and have your son with you if you leave him?  Better get your ducks in a row before deciding what to do.<br>  <br>  Quit snooping and grow up.  You have some adult decisions to make and they don't only affect you.  You sound pretty bitter and angry, not a good time to make a final decision.|`|f1907Oehaa	If he is in 'love' with her, doesn't mean he doesn't love you. Men and women have the capability to love more than one person... but I don't think it can be equal. He misses her, they were probably together for a long time... give him time to heal, don't always go after divorce... divorce is a baddd idea, especially in your situation.|`|th7C1aoaaa	Stay married. Start your own account. start putting away money. Then start doing whatever you want. When he asks you why. Tell him you made a huge mistake.|`|XTBlOf9baa	It's right in front of your eyes. He's having an affair with her. Textbook infidelity, I assure you.|`|aXYiOskmaa	he sounds like he doesn't really love you. sorry.<br>  as far as the custody of you child goes, if you are in the states now, you most likely won't be able to move your son to your country with you. it can be stated in the divorce papers that you are not allowed to move him out of the country.<br>  unless he can prove you as unfit, he can't take your child away from you
r2j2PgIBaa	Just try smiling at him.  Say stuff (if your in one of his classes) like "didn't Mr. Happy look so dorky today?" or "did you get the homework?"  Wave at him in the hall and smile too! Just be friendly and start out with being his friend, maybe it will turn into something more, if he likes you he will ask you out.  Hope it all works out!  =D|`|MsXIWAdZaa	ooh that does make a big diff if dats the kinda guy who would care about age n if he would even be seen with a freshman. one great conversation starter is "what's up?" try it in a crowd and if he ignores you, try to get him in a place where nobody he knows is around and ask "what's up?" if he still ignores you hes not worth it|`|ARycuiedaa	start talking to his friends, than mention what you think about this guy to them they will tell him and hopfully he wants to talk to you too... then smile at him when you see him and one day, go up to him and say 'whatsup?' and just start talking! but the right moment is key!!!|`|vGZte26Eaa	Sometimes a simple: "Hi my name is Manda!" will get the conversation started.  If you can't do that, just continue to give him a nice smile and a nod of the head when you see him. If he is interested, he will let you know.|`|gekVXz9eaa	ok girl this is my speshalty.... u need to draw his attention... next make him think ur in 2 him so start with looking at him at the tip of his nose then move up the his eye brows down to his cheek bones meet him at his eyes then flash a quick smile. make this fast or else they think ur staring. Then u give off the weirdo vibe. hope things work out!!!!XD|`|OCMrQVRxaa	just walk up say hi and b ur sellf
61TcS8NBaa	well If you really want to get back with him then you need to talk to him about it but if you just want to be friends tell him that, but don't be afriad to move on. let your self get lost in just being you. Enjoy these great things that are happening.|`|SzubaKbuaa	It depends why you guys broke up. Think back to that. If you still want him after all that caused and built up to the breakup, then maybe you should talk to him. Otherwise, I suggest you find someone else...that'll take your mind off him very quickly.|`|783Ve5Pnaa	If you've ever seen the Notebook: They say you never forget your first love. They are right. You loved him. It's up to you to decide if he is worth all the silly little arguments. Do the good moments with him outweigh the bad moments?|`|AA11866559	Ppl seem to break up all the time and get back together. It gives them a chance to miss ea other, grow a little and figure out what they really want. Five months seems like a long time but it's not. <br>  <br>  Maybe take it slow. Start as friends only with no expectations except to treat the other right and be treated right in return.<br>  <br>  I have MAJOR insecurities, as you'll see from any of my threads! If you work on them and he goes into things knowing what to expect, you can work on things together.<br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|MzanmVtdaa	talk to him. get hints... does he still like u?<br>  then go for it!<br>  if not, ask for a strong friendship..<br>  finding sumone else always works for me|`|8UmwjcE7aa	Thank for answering my question!!!<br>  Anyways I had the same situation happen to me.  I would get an IM from my ex every couple of months and I still missed him.  I missed him especially when he moved on and found someone else.  He has dated 2 ppl since me but you know what he always tells me non were like you.  And guess what I've been with one man since him and he is not like him.  I think that if it was meant to be you will find a way again.  This might not be the case here though.  There was a reason the two of you broke up.  It is hard to get over that love that you once had.  I know I still think about it and I'm in a going on 3 year relationship now.  It took me 2 years to move on from my ex.  So its been almost 6 yrs now since we broke up.  It is just one of those things that take time.  Depending on how close you were I would say it would be ok to say I miss you.  Because I do with my ex all the time because it is the truth.  Ok then hope that helps.  Take care hun good luck!|`|h99Mcg6taa	Thanks for your answer!   I felt he was doing it naturally, 'cause he realized how much he missed me and wanted to make it work, but once the fight starts he loses focus.  Maybe that's the same case w/ you.  Did he do something to bring up these insecurities or did they exist prior to him?  If it wasn't him, he probably doesn't deserve to have it taken out on him when he's not the one that caused them.  Try telling him that you've realized that it wasn't fair to him and how much he means to you and you've grown in the past 5 months and want to give it another shot.  He might be feeling the same way if he still contacts you.  Good luck|`|kp5dyDz2aa	You should try to talk to him and not be to unsecure because that doesn't help at all.. i was like that well i still am and i am trying not to be because they don't like that..call him tell him how you feel and you will do anything for him like changing a bit and stuff.. what it looks is that you love him and you should do everything for love and if you can't find someone else maybe you guys are meant to be together.. call him and you'll know that if he loves you or not..go for it..good luck girl... don't get anything get on the way if you love him...|`|dymHSSgVaa	I agree it depends on why exactly you two broke up in the first place. If it was something small and stupid, then maybe you should try talking to him and see if he really is what you want again, but if you broke up over something huge, then maybe you two are better off without each other. either way i'd definitely talk to him about how you feel and see how he views you two. And if your talk doesn't work out the move on stop wasting your time!|`|42A0cw0Faa	Talk to him, just say hi work into all the other stuff, it all takes time|`|VTxvR2Gxaa	talk to him. and let him know wats runnin thru ur mind, but dont turn it into a argument.|`|A3UVbX2Eaa	Thanks for your answer to my post- means a lot!<br>  Anyways, this is so interesting to me because I was in the same situation. Why did you two break up to begin with? <br>  In my situation I still liked him a year after we broke up and was the one who called it quits after he cheated on me. <br>  It sucks to like someone even after all that happens. Maybe you should hang out with him and see how it goes?<br>  Has he tried to date/ hook up with any other girls? <br>  It sounds like he doesn't contact you very often... maybe thats a sign that he is trying to move on? I know it hurts, but this will eventually pass and you will become stronger because of it. You get sad because you can not share your happiness with him... but does he wish he could still share his happiness with you? You miss him a lot, but does he miss you? Really think about these questions and think about how he has been since the break up. If he hasn't really cared, then he doesn't deserve your kindness and care. <br>  Its good that you are not pursuing any of the guys that do not interest you. Im sure you feel like no guy will ever make you feel the way your ex did, but trust me- you will. Either talk to him about it, or literally steer clear from him and just focus on yourself.<br>  Even though I was still in love with my ex, i would put post-it notes (like 3 or 4) on my two mirrors (each post it would remind me about something he did that was just sick and horrible) eventually I ended up disliking him and realized I deserved so much better.|`|ihMzlNZVaa	Thanks for answering my question! Its natural to miss your ex. I know I still miss mine. I know what you are going through. My ex and I used to get into petty arguments all the time. I always thought he was cheating on me or lying to me, when in reality he wasn't. I, like you was insecure with myself, and let my past follow me into the new relationship. <br>  <br>  I lost the best thing that ever happened to me that way. One day he just walked away. The thing I think about now is if he was with you and spent all his time with you, he truly cared about you. I didn't realize it until it was to late and now I am scared to talk to my ex.<br>  <br>  If you really love him, talk to him before its too late. Tell him that you are sorry that you hurt him and that you were just so afraid of being hurt again and explain why the arguments happened. See if he still has feelings for you, and if he does, see if you can work through your insecurities together. Any relationship is a partnership. You have to work together on everything. So if he is willing to give another chance, work together. Maybe he is the one who will show you not all guys are the same. I wish you the best!|`|mFflyixfaa	I have the same problem but I never dated the guy.  We were flirty for a bit but he didn't like me so I am forcing myself to get over him.   But I have the same kinda feeling.

You are  entitled to your opinion, however many people meet their long term partner or next spouse on dating sites and other social sites online. They are not any more unsafe than meeting strangers in our every day lives...probably less so actually because you have more time to get to know the person online.<br>  <br>  Everyone online exists offline too anyway...a creep can be online looking for victims, or offline. Anyone meeting people should use caution and good sense, no matter what method they choose.|`|XssPCV5laa	In my opinion, I think it's fine for your mom to go on dating sites. She is an adult, and I'm sure she knows how to take care of herself. You could give her advice about being careful - like only meeting in a public place... but it's no less safe to meet a stranger that you met online first than it is to meet a stranger in the street. Both could be dangerous. But internet dating can also be a great way to make new relationships.<br>  <br>  My mother found her partner on the dating site called www.match.com, and they've been together for 3 years now.

BTW|`|4E6rrI09aa	i don't know..you don't seem too comfortable to do it! It shuld be special between two people & I would NEVER let my boyf have sex with another girl right infront of me!! the green eyed monster would cme out, lol! It depends on what type of person she is|`|xarKlp0Oaa	I would never do that because you may just end up losing your boyfriend to your friend and regret it.
kqkgro5Zaa	well i don't think you really have to be like everyone else, you should really try and find out what type of person you are. like are you funny? nice? caring? or are you more like mean? selfish? sneaky?<br>  i think that you should just try talking to someone next to you when your confused, i am also like you so i know how it is, most of the time (for me) they will explain it. Just slowly build a conversation. but if they answer in a dull voice that probably means they want to get back to work. so the main thing is to try to start a conversation, and if they don't want to talk let it die.<br>  <br>  lol i know this seems really hard, and i know i can't take me own advice but it may work.|`|xc8f2Bunaa	Hey dude, I am something like your case too. I was very silent all the time. I didnt feel close enough to be in a group. Even worse, I had 2 friends whom i treated as my best friends but they kinda abandoned me too.. Im sure you'd have this feeling of wanting to get into the conversation that everyones been having. Same here. I nvr got help u know..I am still like this and sufferring from depression. But one thing i learnt is that to BE LIKE EVERYONE ELSE, YOU HAVE TO BE THERE FIRST. I was extremely afraid to enter a group. What a loner i was...most importantly, BE YOURSELF. That is also one ofthe factors that can get your mind to relax and say what u want to freely. Gd luck.<br>  <br>  It seems that i could help ppl more than i can do it with myself. :)
e224e1489b387127b36ae2f2d9fcd098aa	Yeah sure it looks like they were talking about u<br>  what dd u do in return to that?<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  _K_|`|CxRJwJsraa	possibly. Don't get all egotistical about it though, but it sounds like they very well could have been talking about you.<br>  <br>  Then again, they could have been talking about anything...or even joking.
2pNHOCONaa	we choose our joys and our sorrows long before we experience them.|`|xwtpvK9maa	You should be a little mad,\.<br>  Ask him to care, ask him to look at you more, and ask him to take you out more. if he says no, ask urself "is he worth it" if so, deal with it. if not, break up.<br>  ??|`|jPt4iwICaa	You are totally justified to be mad - but with yourself, for allowing it all. <br>  Especially the bit "never takes me out".|`|GgkCiNvBaa	You are definitely justified for being angry.  And after 7 months! You let this slide this long?<br>  <br>  I would recommend talking to him about this. Tell him you need some more support from him. Perhaps that you feel unloved and unneeded. Whatever really defines what you're feeling, tell him! After 7 months, you should probably be able to express yourself openly with him.<br>  <br>  If he continues on his current path after the talk, I would break up with him. He isn't good enough for you, then.|`|AA11918707	Hard to get anyone to change.  They are the way they are in general.  If he is not showing you the respect you think you deserve, move on.   Why sit around being mad at some jerk.  There are plenty of guys in the world.
CyYwaYUgaa	Knee him in the balls, poke him in the eyes, punch him in his abdomen or neck. Bite him, do w.e to try and get away. Just try to stay away from him as it is. Why u hanging with him anyways. Or yell, im shure sumone will hear you|`|BAoTINvkaa	Use your knee to kick him in the balls, and when he hunches over smack him in the nose with the same knee >.> But if you're not very strong, it won't really do much =P<br>  <br>  You could always poke him in the eye with your free hand, I suppose...|`|y5wvKdTGaa	Tell everyone he is gay. hehe.<br>  <br>  as for the stopping him next time - just run. don't hang around him. he is BAD news.|`|FM5gBNe6aa	you could call the police and have him done for harassment and grevious bodily harm. That'll stop him from coming near you!
0ClA7HlEaa	Is she cheating on YOU? ASK her about it!
ZKsSnT64aa	Tell her yes and then you go out with someone who "likes" you and see how she likes it<br>  <br>  P.S. Dont listen to her when she tells you its "different" when you do it.  Thats most girls favorite line of defense.
e224e1489b387127b36ae2f2d9fcd098aa	Come on yr just 13, txt him back and tell him yr busy and dont like such things from him or yr friends?!!!<br>  <br>  <br>  _K_

yVmiztAwaa	this probably doesn't seem like an issue in your situations, but it's probably really hurting your friend. i'm in this situation, but i'm the friend. i'm watching my boyfriend flirt with this girl that i really don't like that's my "friend"... it is NOT fun. you should probably stop talking to him for a while until he realizes that you want nothing more.. return the favor? <a href="http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index?qid=20090306215635AAPJ4XI">http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index?...</a>

s3iruA0raa	Wow! Are they stupid or what?  Here you show your power as a MAN by restraint and they run.  Dude!  You have the greatest gift to give your future wife... purity.  Find a girl that is a virgin too.  You will never have to worry about disease or meeting the man that had sex with your wife.  You will be able to proudly say to your kids that Mom and DAD were virgins.  You will be in a position to give the greatest moral testimony to everyone.    There are a lot of women out there.  You are on the right road man.  Stick to your morals.  You are the winner.|`|EVhB81dBaa	if i were them i would've respected that and they should too. Some girls don't agree with virginity and thats ok just find one that does and has the same prospects that you do. I think you can go very far in life so don't let women drag you down. Do what you want not what others want.|`|ROyLq4Jvaa	Dont worry about them apparently they didnt have very much class just consider yourself lucky you will definetly find the right women|`|kLK2peV1aa	some women prefer experience, personally i prefer virgin women, but whatev. try to find the right girl.|`|cnq9VQsdaa	**** that man. Try to find a girl with morales like yourself.|`|AA10731562	play it cool|`|lIQhB56Oaa	what bitches!  those women were just sluts.|`|dwok9z8faa	don't give up ur virginity becuase that is supposedly what women want- its not. you will find a girl out there who is saving her first time for the wedding day. she will appreciate u waiting 2.<br>  the girls out there who rejected u b/c of that, they obviously aren't good enough for you-much less respect themselves enough- esp when sex becomes a factor determining whether you want to date someone...<br>  just don't feel like you won't ever find someone b/c of that- thats not what all women want.|`|6nO14vOkaa	my friend don't be upset you would find a woman it just take time to find the correct one and for loosing your  virginity don't rush you never this days what people got.Take your time finding someone you can loose your virginity with it|`|OBemKKwoaa	they are sluts and are no good. u are a virgin so u obviously are more interested in things than just sex so find sum1 better than them. sex shud not be a contributing factor in a decision for a relationship. move on and hope u find sum1 nice|`|CpevWaQ7aa	Some women want experience. Just lie next time though and pretend you have more expiernce. <br>  <br>  A lot of guys act the same way towards girls though so I wouldnt blame it all on women. There are some decent women out there looking for a decent man.|`|6VJ1etR4aa	Wait, were you trying to ask both of these women out?<br>  <br>  I wouldn't worry over this because if they simply reject you because you are a virgin then they obviously don't like you for you.<br>  The time will come when someone doesn't care about things like this and this person will like you for you not your sexual expierences!|`|lVk3ZSnEaa	Gosh! I read on Yahoo Answers this morning about a young woman, your age in fact, with the very same problem...guys run in the opposite direction because she's a virgin, maybe the two of you could hook up.  Seriously, virginity is precious, save it for someone who appreciates it.|`|jXAbTovcaa	Watch some porno and masturbate|`|YGYMocGRaa	just lie! and have a few drinks b4 jumping into bed|`|3lqjbusaaa	you just have to find a girl who doesn't care about just that. i mean i had sex at a young age and i met a guy that was still a virgin. and i was actually glad cause he was a nice guy and i knew he wouldn't take advantage of me. and he had never kissed anyone or anything. it was weird at first but as the relationship progressed. i taught him things and we are still together. so don't lose hope you'll find a nice girl eventually you're still young.|`|SHXvUSd4aa	obviously these were not the right woman for you<br>  <br>  To quote the wisest sex expert Dan Savage (savagelove.com), "every relationship fails until one does not". <br>  <br>  These women were "not that into you" There are plenty women who would love to initiate you, but probably they are not young girls who are them sleves inexperienced. 2 virgins is a disaster. Maybe you want to try it out with an adult more worldly woman just to learn the ropes, so you could be the one leading the way with "the one" when you meet her.|`|UwnHkvvzaa	Then those women obviously aren't the ones for you. If a girl has a problem with you being a  virgin then she ISN'T the one for you.There's more girls out there, and alot who don't care if your a virgin, and alot who are virgins at your age. It's a good thing you don't go sleeping around with every girl you meet, girls don't like that. Don't worry one day you will find a girl who likes you for you, and won't care your a virgin.<br>  <br>  All you have to do is waite! :)<br>  <br>  Good Luck.:)|`|YJ7KdBFbaa	I had the same problem in a way. Im only 20 but got rejected by a couple girls cause they knew i was a virgin and were looking for more experience. Honestly, as obvious as it is, you just have to keep looking. I finally found a girl that didn't care about how i was a virgin and we've been dating for about a year. Also the sex is now long and amazing so let the girls know if the give you a hard time that you will just need time. You'll find a girl that won't care, you diffidently seem like the kinda guy a girl would love.
5f5e536951c9ab9a35b76b038514f369aa	tell your bestie first that you are gonna confront the girl for being mean and rude to you. Dun bring up the copying stuff and its between them and none of your biz.

373aa613c0008fa4b49c5a5fadc039c0aa	Well, this is very elusive but if you feel like she was flirting and you like her then go for it and ask her out.|`|8Initt1aaa	If I were you, I would ask her to hang out with you (not necessarily a date) but go to the mall/shopping, movies or a mutual activity you both will like "as friends". If she says yes, then there is a good possiblility she likes you. When you two hang out, I would then proceed to ask her out or if she wants to date you (because if she hung out with you in the first place she is probably interested).  If she says no she doesn't want to hang out with you, then she is probably not interested. She could be shy too, so be a little persisent if she doesn't give you a good reason. I believe you will land this girl.  good luck.

DxtUaqkMaa	I'm kind of in the same situation. Its weird because you think that's all what everyone around you is doing. Don't let them pressure you into anything and YOU do what you think is right. They will regret the consequences later in life anyway, don't worry. I say, just talk to them and if they don't understand how you feel then just find some other people to hang out with.|`|QP8LdPLeaa	keep your distance when they are doing that crap, you might get dragged into trouble that was never intended for you. they can still be your friends, but just stay away when they're doing THAT.|`|u5eWB2ubaa	i have a friend of some fifteen years, i started drinking beer/wine and have also dabled with smoking and quit, he never expressed any interest and nor made any anti comments but we enjoy each other's company, in fact after so many years of i admire him as having a stronger character and wish i was as strong as him. So keep the company and take what only you want from it not what it exposes you to. Good luck. Keep being happy with yourself just as you are.
JzylRP84aa	Wow, that sucks. I'm Indian too, but my parents don't forbid my sister or me from dating people of other races or religions, and I think they'd feel the same way about marriage, seeing as we know quite a few Indian guys in our community who've married white or Chinese girls, and Indian girls who've married white guys. It's because some of our parents want us to remain true to our culture and have children who are true to our religion. I suggest that you just wait until you're 18 and at college, like the other answerer said. Or you could try to convince your parents, which would be difficult but possible. Tell them that you live in America and that you cannot be expected to follow all aspects of Indian Muslim culture.|`|UgcPxd4maa	because you're religion is full of lies - thats why you will never be happy!|`|OHfZFR31aa	The best thing you can do is go away to college somewhere and start living your own life. You won't be under the thumb of your parents. And if you are only 17 you are too young to think about getting married in the first place<br>  <br>  And when you are a mature adult, you can make the decision on your own who you want to please - your parents or yourself. You might even meet some nice Indian/Pakistani Muslim guy at university, but one that you met on your own without family interference. Or even go on Muslim dating sites to find a guy on your own that your parents would approve of.<br>  <br>  And sorry, if your parents wanted you to grow up in a Muslim culture, why did they move the family to the US? They could have gone to Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, UAE, Egypt or even stayed in India if they wanted to stick with their culture. They moved to the US and can't expect you to behave like you are living in India.|`|aSE7sihFaa	I agree with Kittiesue, focus on school right now and going to college. I'm sure your parents are more than supportive of this. I know its hard. I have met a few muslims and hindu's and know what its like. When you're in school you'll have more freedom and can think about the marriage thing later.|`|lYZ71zYAaa	Kitty-Sue said it all, but more politely than I would have. Have you heard the saying "When in Rome"? It means you are leaving here now,And your Religion I respect, but not some of your customes. You have to decide for yourself how you want to live your life. With your parents Blessing or with out.|`|SXp6p1q9aa	my friends are asian, they are allowed to marry whoever you want, it depends where  you are from , back in india|`|9E54gDcLaa	I think if you and your family are going to live in America you should live by the American laws. There is no " I can't " If you are 18 then go to court! I understand that your parents would probably disown you but are you Happy? Do you still have to wear your religious clothes too? I just think that most of you people move to the U.S. for more freedom and opportunities so why don't you use them?

Done, you're guaranteed a girl will be willing.<br>  <br>  But where's the fun in not being able to even remember your first kiss, etc.<br>  I found my first boyfriend online, i didnt do it on purpose. It just happened, and since then I've had a lot of guys ask me out. It boosted my confidence, making me more attractive.<br>  So you need to find someone that will install confidence in you.If you are too shy to get really close in your real life, then start talking online, you'd be surprised how much it can improve your social skills with new people.|`|AA11861088	Try joining a social networking site like myspace or facebook. In facebook and myspace you can "talk" to people but edit what you say so that you can be confident in what you have to say. Ask your friends and siblings to introduce you to women and tell them to let the women know how shy you are so that they can figure out how to get around it. Just try to act friendly around women. I'm shy too and didn't have a proper girlfriend until I was in my early 20s. I'm 33 now and have had 3 serious relationships and slept with a few more women. So my point is it will happen. Take care of yourself, be patient and don't force it and it will happen.|`|tFbdkxyIaa	just ask girls out. talk to them like real people.  i knew a guy who would ask women on the STREET out for a coffee. i was stunned but he said it was a question of odds. if he asked 20 women, one would say yes. sounds horrible, but the lesson is, if you can let the inevitable rejection fall off of you like rain, you can get through it and find someone who will say yes.|`|Z51fjE2Raa	Snap... but 18 and female. <br>  <br>  I think instead of going out and seeking them... carry on with things that please you... and have the girls come to you.<br>  <br>  The more accomplished you are, the more girls will come to you. <br>  <br>  Are you going to Uni? - The right girl will be there.<br>  <br>  (So my friends tell me...

They are lying/do not know what they really want.<br>  <br>  If there is you, a confident guy (not arrogant) and a woman in a room then 9 times out of 10 she will pick the other guy and you will be invisible.<br>  <br>  2 - CHANGE - As much as people will tell you "Be yourself" it will not get you anywhere im afraid.<br>  Learn to be more assertive and speak clearly.<br>  Always voice your own opnions and views even if somebody disagrees, dont just agree with what everyone around you says.<br>  <br>  Take a confidence and assertiveness course if you think it would help you, take everything they tell you in and do it.|`|elY5vkVyaa	Short answer?

2pNHOCONaa	ok here's an insight on me and my husband's life Now. im 26 turning 27 this year. i have had past relationships with two guys before. and he has had more, but let's say less than than ten. :)<br>  <br>  as harmless as it sounds? because most people think it is in the past? its ok? it really isnt. i used to be like you. i used to be 17 and my first boyfriend was 3 years older than me. i intended to marry him. i never would have accepted if he said he was not certain that we would end up together.. i forced it on him that we would be our last boyfriend and girlfriend. and we kissed, and touched, and experimented, one thing led to another, until we finally did it. i made excuses in my head that it was ok, because i was going to marry him anyway! it was fine.. but it wasnt about being so certain and sure that we were going to get married eventually. it was about who i was back then. and i was immature. i was not ready. i did not know myself well enough. meaning, if someone asked me what pisses me off? i wouldnt be able to tell you specifically. i wouldnt be able to tell you what makes me truly happy. what little things that bother me. and what little things i do that would bother anyone. i was manipulative, jealous, angry, confused and incredibly lost. but i did not know this. i thought i knew everything! i thought if i just believed we would end up together, then that is what would happen. but the truth is, we dont know what tomorrow brings. and we never got married, i cheated on him with some other guy, and we broke up, while the other guy became my 2nd bf for the next 4years. we did it too because i made him believe he would be my last. it was a vicious cycle. and i was more confused than i ever was. <br>  <br>  while all of that happened in my past, my husband now was then hooking up with girls and doing practically almost anything you can think of just for the excitement of it. and then broke up with them when hed had enough. to him, it felt ok, because the girls said yes.<br>  <br>  now that were together for almost 2years, i know we have talked about our past, who were my boyfriends, who were his girlfriends, did he like them and etc.. but we never talked about the details. what we did with these people. and why we did them. until just last month.<br>  <br>  i figured, if me and my husband are out, and we see this girl from his past in the mall. she would call to him, and he would reply, and shed give him a knowing smile, and i would be nothing but left out. though it was already done, and i am who he loves now. they would always have that moment. because they were the only ones who know about it. right? of course. even if he or she wont even consider it special anymore, as long as we dont talk about it, then it stays a secret, and it remains special, and just between the two of you. and me being left the ignorant but blissful wife.<br>  <br>  but thats not really true. i would rather know than not know. and i thought how it would be if it was me and my ex that saw each other? we would always have our past, because i never told my husband about what we did before. i didnt want that. i dont want to feel as if my exes seemed more closer to me than my own husband. i want him to know everything. so i suggested this. and he agreed. and we talked about our past, about the detail of our past. and we could not help but cry and be so hurt about every little minute thing we did before. it was embarrassing, and disgusting, and it made me and him feel so ashamed of ourselves. we cried for an entire week, because it took us almost a week to cover everything! we went through being depressed. but it eventually passed. thank God. we thought, we have made love with each other, but we realized, Wow. its not so special after all. because i am not your first. someone has been there before me. and it hurt so bad. but every time we revealed a detail of truth, we followed it up with reassuring each other that it disgusted us now, that we wished we never have done it at all! because Now we understand why it needs to be within the marriage. not before.<br>  <br>  and where i used to think it was ok to do it because we were going to be married anyway? the fact is, THINKING we were eventually going to get married and Actually BEING MARRIED are two incredibly different things. <br>  <br>  this is what ive come to realize. that the moment we kiss someone not our husband, before we are married, or touch someone sexually outside of marriage, we are causing our future husband/wife to have a fresh open wound. and unless we talk about it, and apologize for it, and reassure each other that were so sorry, and that we love him/her now, then the wound would forever be open. hidden but open and still bleeding. <br>  <br>  because most married couples wouldnt even dare talk about what me and my husband talked about. maybe because they lack trust? that they know their partner wouldnt be able to endure the truth of the stories? we talked about it because going back to the possible mall incident, she would ca|`|G3p7cglxaa	its fine me and my girlfriend are waiting. if you like her enough its worth the wait. its also safer. im 18 as well.|`|Jn4u6rEuaa	do what you want but sex is very important in a relationship|`|QTnI05AJaa	Continued:<br>  <br>  she would call to him, and he would reply, giving him a knowing smile, as if they shared something special in the past, but then she looks at me, and sees in my eyes that I Know. i dont think she would feel so proud anymore. because the moment we talk about things that are supposed to be a secret, so dark and embarrassing, it loses all sense of value. and its not their secret anymore. its not special anymore. it becomes me and my husbands reason to be closer than we were before. because he trusted me enough to tell me Everything.<br>  <br>  wow. am i vocal or what?! i guess i just wanted to have other people learn from our mistakes, now that its too late for us change our past. because we wanted it so bad to be our gift to each other. our virginity. but its too late for us. so there. if you want to give the best possible gift to your actual future wife? which is Not the same thing as someone you are Certain you would marry :) then dont do it. but if you dont want to learn from our mistakes, then thats your call :)<br>  <br>  <br>  we choose our joys and our sorrows long before we experience them. -gibran<br>  <br>  happiness is when what you think, what you say, and what you do are in harmony. -gandhi<br>  <br>  choose wisely, and strive to be happy :)<br>  <br>  ps. if someone tells you that you need to test drive someone first before actually marrying them? that's just being full of it. when youre married, as long as you are so comfortable with each other? you tell each other Everything? little by little you will be able to ask each other what you like him/her to do for you, and vice versa, it will get better in time.. so theres no really need to hurry. :) goodluck anywho!|`|GtxgcRqZaa	just to help u check somethign out, i think that she is very legal to u, legal age isnt 18 every where, and usually age of sexual content is 16, u should check ur state laws, and u should check her willingness and i heard (but dont know for sure) that even if she is underage and u are an adult if there is less than a 4 year difference then its ok (but dont go building upon my speculations without checkin|`|6mtgvusqaa	ya that is the right thing to do.

All I can advice is to give her a "space" or time out..If she really likes you too, she will contact you again.Try to send little notes to her on mail but no to the extent that you are forcing her to be online.Accept the fact that all things might happen.Just let her know that you are there but don't push too much yourself at her.
hcRGqk2gaa	Oodles and noodles. spaghetti.(and sauce), Banquet Meals(frozen meals)..(I know here in Virginia at Food Lion and Kroger and Walmart they are like $1.00 each.) Bread and Bologna.<br>  <br>  You need to get stuff that can last a while as left overs or food that's cheap that you can put together everday.<br>  <br>  A good leftover meal...... if it's just you, that might last 3-4 days .......<br>  Buy: a pack of hotdogs (the cheapest you can get), white rice, onions and bbq sauce or Onion Gravy mix.<br>  <br>  Cut the hotdogs and onions(as many as you like) I would suggest frying them together in the same pan. Or you can boil the hotdogs and fry the onions.<br>  Boil rice.. (as much as you might need.. can eat in a weeks time)<br>  add whatever seasoning you have or want to the rice. <br>  Mix the onions, hotdogs and bbq sauce (or oninon gravy mix) in with the rice. <br>  kinda a low budget goolash meal. (goolash usually includes beef  or some additional meat).<br>  <br>  I make that when I don't feel like cooking for the next few days. <br>  My ingredients for that meal usually include:<br>  Kabelska beef sausage, boneless chicken(cut up into little peices), onions, mushrooms, rice-a-roni (herb and butter or long grain), season salt, pepper, onion gravy mix or bbq sauce and some frozen vegetable.<br>  <br>  Other than that, I'm not really a cook, my bf is... but for quick meals that is what I would suggest. My mom used to cut up potatoes, fry them and cook with bologna. That would last for a little while. Frozen Vegetables are pretty cheap.. I would say you can get more out of the frozen bags than the cans if you like vegetables.<br>  <br>  Good luck...|`|0bYcYz2jaa	Things that expand.

t5NLfSmAaa	Hey man,<br>  <br>  I'm sorry to hear this. I just went through the same thing as you.<br>  <br>  I met my ex last year, and in November we started a relationship and things were going quite well. We would talk everyday, we would send each other all of these text messages etc. During our relationship she had promised me that she would stay with me for a long time and she told me that she loves me with everything in her. I really loved her a lot and I really cared for her.<br>  <br>  Back in december she was supposed to go away to BT but due to a complication she came back home. She told me that she would stay with me until she would go away to BT again.<br>  <br>  It looked like things were going well or so. But last week I got the shock of my life. My ex tells me that she needs to talk to me about something. So, at first, I thought it wouldn't be too bad. But then she tells me she met another guy and that she has strong feelings for him and that she wants to be with him over me and that she has to let go of me. I was completely devestated inside when she told me this and I am still shocked. After all the times that she told me and promised me that she loves me and that she wanted to be with me and she would wait for me while she would be away, and then she meets this guy and I get dumped.<br>  <br>  The ironic thing is that I was writing a letter to give to her so she can take it with her while she would be away. But she called me and after the called I stopped writing the letter.<br>  <br>  Don't worry. I know how you are feeling. Love does exist, but we just gotta find the right girl and hopefully you and I won't go through the same experience again. <br>  <br>  And also, my ex, when she dumped me, told me that I'm a great guy and that I'd make a girl very happy someday when/if I were to meet her, but that didn't help me. Hearing that made me feel worse cause I truly had a lot of love and great feelings for my ex and outta nowhere I felt like half of my soul died.<br>  <br>  You'll see as time goes by it'll help you feel a little better. With me I've been hanging out with my friends and I'm occupied with school and work, etc so that helps to distract my mind a bit. But I can't help of thinking about my ex and the relationship we had and how it ended almost all day long.<br>  <br>  Like I said before, I am sure that you can find a girl that will treat you right and won't pull a stunt like this on you.<br>  <br>  I wish you the best and take care of yourself. And see if you can get a smile on your face cause it'll help to make you feel a little better =)

He's extremely machista (idk the word in English). You must beak up with him immediately. Discuss with him, tell him how angry you are because of the nonsense of his attitude. But make sure there is people close to you in case he attempts to hit you. If he ever does, call the police. That kind of men are really dangerous.|`|AW0072SFaa	leave him while you still can|`|oLli98mMaa	If he does that all to you, you definitely shouldn't be with him. Leave him now, because the longer you stay in the relationship, the harder it will be to get out of it. Leave now!
61TcS8NBaa	the best thing to do if you are considering this guy is to tell him that you want to talk to him face to face this way you can really get a sense of his personality. Then you can decied weather or not you want to go out with him. As for your parents go on a group date where you and a group of friends some of yours and some of his this way your parents, your friends, and you and him can be happy. Good luck|`|Aw4pbnYBaa	thats really sweet and some guys can be big *** holes so you should go for it ...whats the worst that can happen<br>  x|`|PvaxJHLuaa	i hate to tell you this, but guys can turn their sweetness on and off like a faucet. or atleast i can. i mean i can bull s h i t it and just ramble on about how "great" a girl is. i mean its just a skill developed because ive had to help a lot of girls through rough times and thats just how it is. but enough about me, gauge the guy. get in a good deep convo with him.. and obviously do NOT go too far too soon. if he starts demanding something then just dump his lame ***.|`|DsnMKfLsaa	the same stuation i was in<br>  When i was your age<br>  Dont give him a chance<br>  He only wants you for your looks|`|I7jXyZoIaa	something wrong with middle schoolers and younger girls, and kids in general. they think they have to go out with the kid. you and him need to just go on a few dates, without "dating". take it from there|`|O7inFMXVaa	i think you should give it him a chance. giving him a chance doesn't mean that you would be immediately jump in a relationship right? just try it and see where it may take you|`|CA9G8X8faa	aww go for it, he  sounds sweet and if you have a crush on him you should definitely give him a chance.<br>  <a href="http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;_ylt=Aqbef_QCroOjfFr0SHa6pFfsy6IX;_ylv=3?qid=20090306220954AAb4yPs">http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;...</a>|`|du09EKkoaa	i would go for it & if it doesnt work out then okay.

vUZy6JIxaa	one word KIDS|`|aErUKUvVaa	sometimes its just that they grew apart from eachother and lost interest in eachother.  sometimes its hormones. sometimes its affairs.  could be any of a number of things, but either way its not a healthy way to go thru life.|`|ULUpOqplaa	When men get involved or married part of their brain shuts down.  Part of that has to do with sex.  Not sex in general, just sex with their partner.  Their partner begins to become invisible to them.  So far swingers have been the only ones to come up with an answer.|`|MjSLQlIHaa	ive been with my gf for seven years now, and our sex actions simmered a lot from what it use to be, i think a lack of interest plays a big part for sure. trust me if you were single youd have no problem getting it on with who you desired.
YaolmzEXaa	well, from what you've said, it sounds as if it could go either way. It's possible that he doesn't fancy you, and that he simply likes the idea of being liked, and wants to keep that going for a while. Or maybe, he's not sure just how *much* he fancies you yet, and is taking some time to figure that out....although in most cases, a guy should already know.  <br>  <br>  I know that there are a lot of inexperienced guys who do actually get very intimidated or generally shy with girls they like, so you do have a point there.  He may fancy you a great deal, and simply not know what to do! If this is the case with him, then regular flirting tactics will not get you very far.<br>  <br>  If you really fancy him that much, you owe it to yourself to get over your shyness and be little more assertive. Take matters into your own hands, and ask him out. When you are together with him, try to make him feel as comfortable as possible. If he is into you, then he probably feels very awkward and anxious in your presence, to you should try to mitigate that with warm and open body language. It may take a few dates/exchanges, but you'll figure out where the two of you stand a lot quicker.  Good luck.|`|KljiuCH0aa	He's never had a gf before? okay this is easy lol<br>  The most important thing for guys is relationships and having girlfriends.So I think he was waiting for a girl to like him so he can ask her out...and as long as he talks to you and stuff and HE KNOWS you fancy him then I'm pretty sure he'll do the first move<br>  But girl,if he didn't,then go for it !! =P|`|W20KslFzaa	LOL....I love you kids across the pond.... "does he fancy me?" "does she fancy me?"  LMAO...<br>  <br>  Brittish English is so much different that American English.<br>  <br>  I'm not trying to make fun, but it just gives me a good chuckle.|`|z2pfYJjuaa	start off by just talkin so he get commfortable around you and then you could maybe ask him if he fancies anywon and he might tell you or if he looks at you and then says no he might like you.|`|FLWuVKWnaa	Hey at least you can talk to this dude. Go for it.|`|PnMfou3eaa	its hard to tell because everyone expresses their feelings differently. try asking him out or if your that nervous have a friend talk to him, just remember, its not bad to make the 1st move|`|a2FHCgetaa	Honey. Rub up against him.  Limit personal space in his presents.  Always touch on him and rub him.  You'll hook up and have a good time!|`|8HVK9Lyaaa	U might as well go for it. He's probably just as shy about it as you are and using the 'big mouth' thing, to cover up for his insecurities.|`|SQekGM8gaa	hehehehehe. are you british?<br>  <br>  I fancy that.|`|yGTJfcF5aa	oOo lala :P|`|ilx6DeVYaa	i think he's just shy because he's never had a gf before. he probably doesn't want to sound stupid. i don't think you'd make a fool of yourself if you made the first move. if nothing else, you'd find out whether he really likes you enough to date you or not, and you can either be with him or move on. i'd say go for it, though. why not? : ) good luck|`|IuJcKGroaa	if he was into you then he'll make a move so if he hasn't HE'S JUST NOT THAT INTO YOU!!!|`|143f9530216dfb9e78a759118b56a704aa	kiss him and see|`|qjy5OirNaa	yes
ZKsSnT64aa	I will answer by saying this FACT:<br>  <br>  When I was younger,had a better body,had ALL my hair but made 24,000 a year,I RARELY got any girls.<br>  <br>  Now I weigh more,I am almost bald,and Im almost 36..... But I make over 100,000 a year.<br>  <br>  I know thats not rich,but alot more comfortable,and even though Im taken,I constantly have girls asking me for my number or to go out.<br>  <br>  <br>  HMMMMMMMM|`|jXCjw64Iaa	sadly for most that is what it has become.|`|TzppP7otaa	No, i'm not exactly rich myself, but i've had loads of girls calling me cute, and loads really like me, and as for ugly women, they'll always be an ugly man to go with, nobody's screwed, just harder to attract than others.
AA10887916	Try a bottle of vodka 1 hour before sitting your test.....|`|YJRCC0vbaa	Ask your instuctor to take you on a mock test and ask if you would have passed or failed. It might be a good idea to do a few, and if you're failing the mock tests then it will give you things to work on, but if you are passing them then failing the real test will probably be down to nerves. Everyone gets nervous on their driving test. If you find yourself starting to panic a bit, ask the examiner if you can pull in (somewhere safe obviously) and take a moment to breathe, or ask if you can have a minute when they ask you to stop at the side of the road. They know how you are feeling. In my test I asked if I could take a minute to breathe and he was really nice about it. <br>  Don't give up because you will pass. It takes some people a good few attempts but you're getting all this experience with every one, so there's a positive. Think of all the money, time and effort you've spent on lessons and tests. You don't want that to go to waste so don't give up and believe that you will pass! As for nerves, just remember to breathe through it and remember that examiners are just people, and if you see them mark something on the paper don't worry and don't try to guess why because you'll just stress yourself. It might also help to review why you've failed on your previous tests and work on that with your instructor. So the best advice I can give is to be proactive, don't lose your cool and don't give up! Good luck|`|mkA615Ataa	you could give up but if you really want to get it passed try asking your instructor to behave like he is examining you so you can get used to the way it feels to be tested. I passed my driving test by taking my mind of the fact he was sitting there. I did this by talking myself through all the manoevers in my head as I was instructed to carry them out which kept me calm. also you could ask your instructor if you would be able to sit in the waiting room at the test centre a few times so you could get used to being there without building up your nerves.|`|kqkgro5Zaa	i think that you should talk with your examiner, he/she is obviously doing something that makes you nervous, explain it to her/him and im sure they will understand.|`|kykmpr0Caa	id give up and get a bus pass|`|uvTUtYXgaa	like we all need YOU on the road!!!!!!|`|dTnOa3qcaa	First of all, I want for you to study for your driving test. Relax! Then sit down and read it in a casual way. There is no rush about this. You should use paper clips to separate each chapter. By the way, the examiner shouldn't be frightening to you. Is he or she supposed to be better than you or perhaps more powerful? I bet you NOT. So, drop the pity party and get on down to the driving facility. YOU are the power behind the wheel. You must take your time studying for the exam. Remember that there are 'trick questions' in there as well. I want for you to keep on taking the test until you pass it. <br>  <br>  YOU WILL PASS THE DRIVING TEST!<br>  <br>  Most of all, I will share the scriptures that have been helpful to me. What shall we then say to these things? If GOD be for us, WHO can be against us? - Romans 8:31  The Lord daily loadeth us with BENEFITS, even the GOD of our salvation. Selah. - Psalm 68:19   Peace!|`|qbvjOFvHaa	try asking for a new instructor you might be nervous by the way they teach and i hope you pass!btw view my profile

DbVOtAIBaa	Ok. Well i think probably its cause your being conscious about yourself. Its quite possible that you also don't moan much or make some noise during your climax. Isn't it ?<br>  Well there is nothing really bad in this. This happens naturally and can be changed with time.<br>  You should know that letting go of yourself and your body will enhance your pleasure manifolds and elongate the orgasm.<br>  Just be comfortable during the act and keep your mind all free. Its very necessary that your not thinking of something else (like how you look or how you sound) in your mind. Also where your doing it, like if your not sure that people can't hear you...you will not be comfortable or able to let go.<br>  <br>  Just concentrate on what your doing and why your doing it (for pleasure). It will get better and better with time.<br>  <br>  Regards from India|`|71VRvldJaa	An orgasm is a contraction or spasm.  Think of the clitoris as a mini penis because that's what it is.  When a man ejaculates it's the same type of contraction or spasm.  That's why everything is so sensitive to touch after. It's almost imposible to relax your body when you're having an orgasm.|`|th7C1aoaaa	The problem is all mental. Your are afraid to let go. You think it's not good if you just orgasm and squirt all over. Well the truth is it's not as abnormal as you may think. Just try letting whatever happens happen. Let me know how that works for you.
XBy7am73aa	I dont think she was ever into you, 80% isnt very good or a good thing to say to someone. I suspect shes young. Move on, it sounds like you deserve someone better, shes obviously not interested. Dont bother speaking to her on msn..you'll find someone else|`|c9cTrfqEaa	Don't judge your opinion on this msn convo msn is always hard to tell She may not of necessarily gone off you, maybe shes in a bad mood or something if she acts the same again on a different day then maybe shes trying to scare you off.
3aeBqLORaa	well, do you just want to get this girl in bed or do you like her more than a loyal girlfriend?its you choice im just here to help|`|4WlYjTYxaa	It depends. If she were a whore you pays and you have a very nice day screwing her.

Lay off dude and back off. She probably feels so awkward since she probably wanted just to be good friends with you and find someone to talk a lot and once you asked the question she gets embarassed possibly due because she's shy and onyl wanted to be friends, etc.<br>  <br>  Yes, I understand man girls give us guys the biggest mixed signals ever. I have dealt with this 2yrs ago over a girl and it ended up in complete diaster cause I thought she liked me since she always giving me these signs.<br>  <br>  The truth is....you never know if a girl likes you or not.|`|RmQzb0Avaa	she has a bf and shes suppose to be loyal to him so leave her alone and it was best not telling her that you like her b.c now its gunna be awkward!!<br>  <br>  and stop reposting this ive seen this post everyday so STOP!|`|8t5S2aiOaa	prolly cause she likes you and has a boyfriend?

xK75gTz9aa	talk a lot|`|8uMXFWgyaa	pay me some attention. they do things that aren't sexy. like drunk, drugs, fall all over other guys and just kinda difficult all around. they never try to improve themselves.|`|GfNVcq7Naa	Nothing, if a guy is bored then he himself is boring.|`|aikop3TXaa	Okay, being a guy myself, i believe i can effectively answer this question.<br>  <br>  1) When one of your guy friends comes up and you don't even introduce us, you just start talking to him.<br>  2) When one of your girl friends comes up and you don't introduce us, or you just talk to her about your opinion of another guy.<br>  3) When we look you right in the eyes from RIGHT beside you for more than 3 seconds, we want a kiss. When you just look at us and turn your head away, we get very bored. To correct this one, either just kiss us, or say, "Not now... Save it for later" or something. That doesn't make us bored, that makes us look ahead to said "Later".<br>  4) When we put our arm around you standing up and you don't put your arm around our waist, we get bored because we feel like we're the only ones showing affection.<br>  5) When we're at the mall, don't sit across from us at the food court, sit next to us. Most of us guys honestly don't mind going into girl stores as long as we're actually WITH a girl as well. When we go into Spencer's or Hot Topic, at least come in with us, we're not asking you to go into a crypt, it's a clean store owned by people wanting to sell accessory items and clothing. <br>  6) In the car, when you just sit there silent, it bores us. Find something to talk about so you won't become a back seat driver, because that not only BORES us it annoys us. If we start talking about cars or something, at least to make us happy, just ask a question like, "What type is in your car?"<br>  7) Last thing i can think of. Don't stop what we're doing to text someone. It doesn't only bore us, it strikes us as very rude. That's almost like pausing a conversation with us to talk to someone else. When you're with us, tell your friends you're with us and you'll text them later.|`|ge5x9NHxaa	When girl continue nagging a guy will get bored.|`|sR4HjV9Paa	Nothing when he's in heat.|`|Fxp5Owfwaa	not talking can make things really boring.

And unless we tell you we are interested in a specific thing, don't talk about your day. Gossip is sometimes okay, but only when we ask for it or if it's about someone we care about or know really well. <br>  <br>  The thing to remember here is that girls talk. Everything they do is talk. When you go eat lunch, it's not really the point of the lunch to eat it. It's an opportunity to talk. Guys like to do. Go do something with him. Games, t.v. movies, sports, any activity besides talking. We do enjoy the occasional conversation, but not all the time.|`|upVQxbmwaa	Probably not being as exciting. Guys like to keep moving and doing stuff, they mostly don't want to be doing the same the over and over again. It drives them nuts. Like making him do stuff that he doesn't feel like doing. Like going to your little sisters soccer game or family outings. If he isn't interested in it, dont make him go. He gets bored when he can guess your next move, make him laugh, be crazy, and outgoing, no nagging too.|`|EpkDA2FOaa	Well Ash, for me personally what bores me as a guy is when my g/f won't talk and acts shy alll the time, even after months of dating, i mean we're t/g for cryin out loud, she can say w/e she wants i'm not gunna like look down on her.

ea073069c581a3e342f2f7ec101708f1aa	Talk to him about it.  Maybe he wants you to feel jealous because he likes the fact that you like him and he finds it sweet that you do.  But tell him that it really hurts you and that you love him.  It's normal to be jealous, it happens with everyone.|`|NqCMbeL1aa	I know this sort of thing is tough, but there's really nothing you can do about it.<br>  <br>  Some people are just inherently more likely to become jealous than others. You just need to give yourself time to mature, and try to think rationally.|`|p6I881Lwaa	You have the right to feel uncomfortable when a guy compliments someone else on purpose, especially since he is doing it on purpose. But you know, just like girls, boys want to feel appreciated and get attention. So in his mind, he might be thinking, 'i want to see her face react to me when i'm pretending to like some other girl'. Oh, isn't that smart of him, right? Of course, we find it dumb. But that's the only explanation for this--otherwise, if he wasn't interested in you, you wouldn't be dating him. So you see the guy is actually forcing you to be attentive to him that way, because he wants to feel special. But you need to let him know how un-special you feel. The next time he does that, try not to let your jealousy show because he is craving for that. Instead, simply and calmy explain to him that he isn't doing a good job at being a good boyfriend. Don't comment on what he says about another girl. Be more independant. He'll probably become more concerned about your feelings, and try to keep it to a minimum. No one likes being betrayed.|`|AA12212403	Pay back time?  Give him some of his own medicine and see what his reaction is.<br>  Sounds like you both are pretty young, as you mature these feelings will diminish weather you are with him or someone else.<br>  It's part of a growing up process.<br>  But, I would seriously control myself and stop appearing bothered by it and just start to do what it is that annoys you so much, see how he likes it.  This might teach him a lesson or you might just end up breaking up.  Either way, your pain and agony will stop.|`|F0uLexezaa	this trait of yours will ruin every relationship if you don't get it under control. ask yourself, what really did happen? am i seeing it thru tinted glasses? if need be, seek professional help since you will drive yourself crazy and your bf or husband, too|`|GGEAttkgaa	Just say to him "Why don't you ever talk about me?" and then "am i good enough?"|`|GfNVcq7Naa	Ok here it is, If you are jealous by nature (meaning you were jealous with others before him, I mean even with your friends too) then you have to break yourself from it. He might be trying to break you from it  by taunting you with it, hoping you'll give it up. Or he's just mean and playing head games. Either way, you have to get over it because that is no way to live. I don't know you so I can't really be all that much help but it's kinda simple. When your in doubt (or feel jealous) you have to repeat certain phrases in your head. Like oh I don't know. Things like, I'm a good girl, I'm cool, I am what I am and my family/friends/people loves me. what ever it is that makes you feel grounded in your life. And sure enough that feeling will pass you shouldn't have to tell anyone about that ugly feeling if you have no reason to doubt. BUT, if you are not jealous by nature but have this gut feeling and he IS being mean then well obviously he's not what you deserve and you owe it to yourself to move forward.|`|KZoGvD0Raa	i think you should talk to him about it... adn be like you talk so good about this other girl and it hurts me to not see you talk about me in that way.. you need to tell him how you feel and that its bothering you... then maybe he will understand if not.. then hes not the right person for you cuz he doesnt care about you enough to listen to you|`|VF14bk8iaa	What a jerk, I say leave him! Does he get pleasure from seeing you mad? That's messed up. Saying that someone on TV is pretty or sexy is one thing (still rude) but saying all that stuff about the play sister is really really not right. REALLY not right.|`|xoobWcWxaa	tell him to stop and if he still does it then i would tell him you cant stand it and your think about leaving him and if he still doesnt stop leave him|`|YQUrWyH3aa	don't do anything his still loves you. how do i know well, us guys like to make our girls jelous its human nature|`|1WQTxqUmaa	talk to him.|`|4E6rrI09aa	find someone better! i'm a jealous person so my boyf helps me through it  as best as he can & doesn't wan me to be jealous at all & hates when i'm upset!<br>  have a serious convo with your boyf!|`|htz7NwT3aa	sounds pretty lame, leave him if that's what u wanna do

RMMwK30iaa	Well if i were you i'd just start slowly by being friends with him first, i certainly wish i'd done that with some of my ex-s......maybe they wouldn't be my ex-s.......anyway, yeah, its hard to tell, try being his friend for a while that should give you a better idea if he likes you, atm its hard to tell, he could just be looking for a conversation or something, i don't know, and if he's not making eye-contact with then i dunno, because that's a big sign. If your friends with him a while and you think he likes you and you still like him (becoming their friend can actually put you off because you find about their personality, if its bad though its better to find out before going out) then ask him out!<br>  I can't really understand your story either, its babbled, calm down and take another look at it, try and edit it a bit cos the second paragraph doesn't make sense :P <br>  Good luck :)|`|uFqLPODSaa	ok, ur paragraph is kiiiiinda confuzing, not gonna lie<br>  but i think he might like you. become friends. get to know him. tlk to him a lot and just be yourself.<br>  <br>  if uve never tlked before, ur never going to get anywhere, and he cant like u unless he tlks to u. so far, he proly thinks ur cute. just get to know the guy :)|`|UZZHJsnmaa	yes he likes you :)|`|xzo9MbMAaa	maybe....yes|`|ls8KNu9uaa	Why don't you sit down, and ask yourself this question<br>  <br>  <br>  'So what if he does like me..<br>  <br>  And<br>  <br>  'So what if he doesn't like me<br>  <br>  <br>  From then on, you'd know what to do..|`|HnKCUcd0aa	Probably yeah but if I were you I would look for more proves if he likes you.|`|NyB4JfWCaa	Of course he fancies you babe!

gfzFtMFnaa	It sounds like you are a little shy, but we all have the jitters when we like someone.  Just take a deep breath and ask the crush if they would like to go to the movies, go bowling, go for a soda, etc.  <br>  <br>  Just be brave and ask.  You'll never know if they like you back unless you take the time to ask. <br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|AA10800575	so....<br>  do u wannt go out with me?|`|oLli98mMaa	Ask her in a text.
kqkgro5Zaa	i don't think that's really a friend, this happened to me too i split the work evenly between me and my friend.<br>  turns out she did everything wrong and now i got a D.......<br>  im not really friends with her anymore,but what really makes me angry is that i had to re-do her work and then she gets a B and so did i.<br>  <br>  now that i don;t really talk to her anymore, she tried to get me to be her partner again and when i say no she'll get mad and say "some friend you are"<br>  <br>  i think that your friend is just like my ex-friend. And about your depression, i think that telling the lecturer would help,because you shouldn't let people get credit for things you worked hard on!

I'll probably sound like a pedophile. She looks very young and when I say she, I mean you. Why is the youth so interested in looks now a days? It just shows us how down this generation goes.|`|D1KT9ioJaa	she looks kinda pretty..kinda innocent looking to|`|gRXy66dOaa	Do i think she looks pretty?? That pic is you.. LOL<br>  <br>  yes you look pretty*
X0AAQra9aa	Unfortunately, things like this do happen in senior schools. They are scary places. I know as I go to the biggest high school in the whole of the town that I live in. It has nearly 2000 students. Sometimes, people do say nasty things to the year 7s, only because they are the youngest. But if you make friends with some nice people that you know you can trust, you will survive the first year perfectly. In fact, once you've made a group of friends, you will barely even realise what is going on around you. The year will fly through - time flies when you're having fun!<br>  <br>  Don't be afraid to date either. Yes, a lot of the boys are very immature but they are easy to recognise. Just ignore them. Some of the boys though are nice and tend to have a better sense of maturity about them. For example, my friend is going on a date with a boy in our year on Tuesday. Me and my other friend knew that she secretly wanted to go out with him. There are two other girls in our form that know the boy she fancies. I asked them to ask the boy out for my friend. And now they have a date!<br>  <br>  The best tips I can give you really are to stay away from gangs of people that are older than you, just incase. Don't try to interact with immature boys. Try to make friends with as many people as possible quite quickly, maybe some other people in your form or in any of your classes. I am quite lucky really because all the classes at my school are single sex until year 10. Also, don't feel pressurised by any of your friends into taking drugs or smoking, etc. Your health is way more important than friends.<br>  <br>  That's all really. So good luck!!|`|rmnUrL35aa	When you are finally in high school, don't be so anxious or scared. Or atleast just dont show it. The older people their will think you are a freak for panicking like that. If someone says something to you, just act casual or cool. NEVER GO NEAR ANY OF THE GROUPS OF GIRLS. Because if you go near those cliques they will be really mean to you. Don't raise your hand for a question during classes because then people will think you are a big know it all. As for all the bad things that are at your school, try to avoid them as much as possible. Try to meet up with your friends and dont hang out with the wrong people. If someone says something that really bothers you, then dont stand around and cry. Just walk away with some dignity. Dont punch him or her or something. That will always lead to something worse. As for your apppearences, look at what everyone else is wearing . That will help and always stay in the fashion. ;)|`|Oy1BTxbJaa	Moving schools is always scary, You're going from being a big fish in a small pond, to being a small fish in a big lake.<br>  <br>  Yes those things do happen in high school. But it's all a learning process of how to grow up. I'm sure you'll make some nice friends once you start. And you can usually tell which are the kind to stay away from. Only you can find this out for yourself. Trust your instincts. If something feels wrong then you'll know.  I'm sure you'll do fine in your new school. :)  Good luck for September!
6ulA6MVVaa	welll personally no because im outgoing with and withut my friends and i have a lot of confidence......i wuld ask out the guy the minute i liked him hehe......anyways she is just shy, and my best friend is shy tooooo, and yeah she ususally avoids guys she likes, but now im teaching her otherwise but still......so, it seems like she might like u...... i hope this helps! and if u have anymore questions or just wanna chat email me at neon_rainbow99@yahoo.com :)|`|rmnUrL35aa	Well for starters has she ever even talked to you? Just a normal conversation? If she has, then its just that she's really shy when around you and Im guessing she likes you. But if she hasn't talked to you, than its just cause shes shy when she is alone and doesn't want to be around anyone.|`|uLyBjMonaa	yeah i do that when i REALLY like a guy <br>  <br>  PLEASE ANSWER!

However I'm not shy, so I would just go up to the guy and talk. <br>  <br>  If you like her (and since you know she is shy), go to her and make small talk.
MvIEWl4paa	The main thing i would say, is don't try and plan it.  If you plan it, things won't go well.  If he is experienced, and he really cares about you, then he will know how to take care of you.. Most guys shouldn't expect the first time to be great, because you won't be able to do much.  It will hurt bad the first few times, so there is nothing you can really do to make it good for HIM. for the first few times, you should just worry about yourself.  I would be on bottom for the first time, and he should know to go slow at first. honestly it probably won't be that great the first time.. So don't plan it out, and dont expect it to feel amazing, lol, the best thing about the first time, it the feelings that come with it.  i hope this helps. good luck|`|ea073069c581a3e342f2f7ec101708f1aa	Take it slow first, it's going to hurt. :/<br>  <br>  THEN RIDE HIM HARD<br>  <br>  That's all. :D<br>  <br>  Answer mine please?<br>  <a href="http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;_ylt=AooECL40JgtzAw75S4.3yR3sy6IX;_ylv=3?qid=20090306181000AAAKYBC">http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;...</a>|`|jNrOj0bgaa	Just be yourself and do not over do it or fake it.

vWPq8nS2aa	Depend on what you like to do. You would want someone you have things if common with. If you like to read, check out libraries, you like dogs go to a dog show. Just do want you like, and the right guy will come to you.|`|AA12346188	Genuine guy?! next to impossible.<br>  You do not get in your ten births on this planet.<br>  whoever comes in your way, take him, consider him as a genuine guy.<br>  When you are fed up, change or exchange.|`|KhyPqoFIaa	Try www.match.com<br>  It works!<br>  <br>  From the surfer!
xNMPvgFhaa	How old are you two now? Do you still love her?<br>  And what do you want from this relationship? Do you want to get back to her?<br>  <br>  If you're both an adult and really would like to work it out, then you should communicate with her and see what she has to say. You both made the commitment to be in a long distance relationship and you both should really talk about it, if you want to end it up.<br>  <br>  From what you wrote, I see that you still care about her very much. It also seems to me that she cares about you too. <br>  <br>  I can only suggest you to try to get to her (either by email, message or anything).|`|WoRaXE73aa	Sounds like you need to distance yourself from this mess. Let her know you do care about her, but are giving her time to recover from whatever she is in before you can be her friend. Which is all you can be for her. And that is exactly how I would state it. Sorry, dear.|`|gRXy66dOaa	If you worry about about than that means you still love her<br>  everything is possible*|`|Mubj1o2eaa	Well, if it's a long distance relationship, you never know whats real and whats fake. Unfortunately, it's very possible that it's true. Shes suicidal. But it's also possible that she is so in love and obsessive over you, that she would go to any length to get you back. Such as guilt tripping and lieing to you. Long distance relationships are very complicated because you don't know whats real and whats fake. But if you don't want to be with her, explain it to her that you think it would be better for her if you don't lead her on. It isnt a real relationship if your both not happy. You are only causing yourself pain by being with her. So just follow your heart. And maybe for a while it would be best not to torture yourself by listening to her suicide attempts. You need to stop being so easy for her to get through and manipulate you. She is an obsessive ex, and the longer you stay with her, the more obsessive she will get when it's time to call it quits. The longer you stay, the worse it will be when you end it.  Good luck

YqBFguzpaa	She's treating you almost the same as if you cheated, because she feels betrayed in the same way. Since you never told her the girl existed in the first place, how is she expected to believe you have cut her loose? You could easily be lying and she just caught you in a lie (a lie of omission anyway) she'd be a fool to just believe you just like that.<br>  <br>  You're going to have to make it up to her. Give her some time to think about it, but then spoil her with massages, pic-nics, all your attention, and tell her you're trying to make it up to her with all this attentiveness. Make her not doubt in her mind that she is the only one you want. (By the way you have to spoil her with your time and attention not gifts and stuff or it'll just seem like you're trying to buy her off).<br>  And leave your phone lying around so she can look through it if she wants (which is not that sneaky of her since you have just given her grounds to be suspicious) and let her access your computer and stuff so she can see that you are not having any more communication with this girl.|`|088k8bRYaa	Stop calling every second and if shes that mad you need to talk to her and say whats going on you havent been answering my calls and we need to talk|`|SzubaKbuaa	I think you should drop this internet girl.
5f4c88c0a5c372fa2858b980a5e9f942aa	I would say neither. How about this option: being a honest dad who recommit his fidelity to his marriage & family?<br>  <br>  I am amazed by how many people nowadays are taking the easy way out of a marriage whether it is divorce or cheating instead of working at it. Marriage is challenging at times. No one is perfect. <br>  <br>  <br>  However if you are set on either destroying your marriage by cheating or divorce, I would say divorce. Both cause pain to a degree. Either way you set an example to give up when it is tough. Have you try every resources to work out your differences/issues with your wife?|`|8ac2e5cbdd946ee60c803052559873c5aa	Divorced dad.<br>  <br>  Children do not miss a thing.  They are learning from their parents' behavior all the time.  Men are nowhere near as discreet as they think they are, either.  Sons are learning how to become husbands and fathers.  Daughters are learning how to become wives and mothers.<br>  <br>  I cannot estimate how many marriages today are falling apart because of cheating, but it is huge.  When you add in the complexities of a man dealing with a wife whose father was a cheater or a man whose father was a cheater, how do you make this problem go away for our society?  Our society is monogamous.  <br>  <br>  Because adultery is seen as immoral and also legal grounds for adultery, people need to see people held responsible for this behavior.  Same as when someone commits a crime.  Otherwise, everyone in society feels victimized, because good behavior is not properly rewarded if bad behavior goes unpunished.|`|FewhKlx9aa	One who is involved in their life and nothing else.The fact you can't put your lust aside and these are your two options says you suck at being a Dad|`|e50e6ca9411acd39c8aec91e4abe2b89aa	Divorced! Children feel the tensions within a household with a divorce they have time to heal hopefully if the parents involved are mature and work hard at ensuring the children know it was not their fault and they are loved. <br>  <br>  In a cheating relationship the children as well learn that lying is okay, cheating is okay or at least acceptable. As well they feel the anger, hurt and frustration that goes along with being cheated on, etc. My opinion. <br>  <br>  I would say divorce. Which would take maturity and honesty to accomplish.|`|8103f5a386f35ec2420460c4f3b3dcabaa	divorced dad..cheating whether married or not, is not setting good moral standing for children to have role modeled for them..the selfish parent is in this kind of relationship for themselves..they are not thinking about how it affects their own children...how sad is that?????|`|OHfZFR31aa	Divorced. Discreet cheating never stays discreet. And what happens when the wife and kids find out. I have a few friends who are still bitter about their father cheating on their mother and can never forgive him.|`|JfeLb2Ptaa	Definitely divorced. Discreet Dad could get caught and then the kids find out about it, they will hate that Dad for a very long time for ruining their family. Divorced Dad leaves on good terms (hopefully) and stays in the good graces of the kids (eventually, when they get over the divorce issue).|`|ckr2be5daa	Neither. Both are A-Moral.  We're all sinners in different ways....I strongly suggest that your repent. Call up your local parish church and ask to make an appointment with the Pastor to talk about some personal issues....they are bound to confidentiality.<br>  <br>  I believe that your kids will eventually find out (even if you say you've been discreet).  Divorce is absolutely terrible.  Nothing shakes a kid's self esteem like the family being broken up.<br>  <br>  Do you really feel like you can't get what you need sexually from your wife?  You should work WITH YOUR WIFE to get what you need sexually.  There's no reason that either of you can work to satisfy each other.   As a wife, I would rather have my husband tell me, "you need to do x or y to make me happy" rather than have him divorce or cheat on me.<br>  <br>  You're being selfish.  You need to think of your family before you ruin them.<br>  <br>  May I suggest taking your wife out to dinner tonight as a start?|`|TZ815QKDaa	DIVORCED.HANDS DOWN.|`|lYZ71zYAaa	A Dad who is divorced.

If you don't like how he treats you, play him at his own game or just tell him to shut the F*ck up. <br>  If he's sharing that kind of personal info. with others, then watch what you tell him in future, seeing as he can't REALLY be trusted. <br>  If he's being alright with you, being nice, just keep things as they are.

Talk about your problems.|`|AA11238703	that is really sad.  you have to talk to him without accusing.  talk to him about what he enjoys about texting and calling with them.  understand what he gets from that.  empathize with it.  <br>  then you can tell him how you feel when you sense that he doesn't want you to see his phone.  don't accuse him of cheating or anything, just say the exact facts:<br>  "when i see a text from xxxx on your phone, i feel scared, because i need security"<br>  or i need trust<br>  or...<br>  tell him how you feel when you see it and what you need (not what you want him to do but what you need for you)|`|qmMCGKl9aa	if he is hiding his phone from you, then something is going on.<br>  maybe hes cheatting.<br>  <br>  he shouldn't be talking to his ex anyways, and his co-wrokers shouldnt be caling and texting him either.|`|AA10397495	go through his phone while hes sleeping and look at his text messages :P ik it sounds wrong but.. thats probably the only way that u can REALLY find out if hes cheating on you or not.. cuz if u ask him.. he may lie to you..|`|Yv6pa3QAaa	find his phone and look at his text messages<br>  if they are dirty or sexual, then leave him but<br>  at least then you will know without worrying about it anymore<br>  just make sure he doesnt find outtt :)|`|93Pq7zVtaa	My ex used to hide his phone-That's why he's an ex.

I think the best way to resolve your problems to confront him about it. If he's unfaithful there really isn't any good reason to stay with him.|`|TrEDiWR7aa	yikes.. you need to talk to him and ask him what's up. soon.
Ga2dMpB7aa	If you still say I love you, you haven't broken up. Why did you "break up"? Was it because of a petty little fight that doesn't matter that much? Or did one of you do something really bad, like cheat on the other one or lie? Were you together for a long time, and just got sick of each other? If it's the first one, go ahead and get "back together" with him. If it's the second, stay away at all costs, and if it's the third, take a little break from him for a while--a real one, no "I love you"--and then see how you feel.|`|XBy7am73aa	Noooo rule number one..never go back always move forward
4bfad7ab1091410a8f457928ef047b92aa	It's very possible that he does like you, but has had a bad experience with a relationship in the past and doesn't want one now! I would give him a chance. At least go on the date. We (girls) know when a guy is giving us BS or if he really likes us, even though sometimes we act like we don't. If he seems genuine continue to see him, if not get the heck out before you get too involved. Good Luck! :)|`|T33Za7jiaa	The Cow saying sounds very familiar! hehe poor girl.|`|L1r3IcYIaa	Maybe he not ready yet. He's probably afraid he might get hurt.<br>  But just wait and stick around.

NgawN7Pcaa	only you two can know if things will work.<br>  if you make eachother happy, and can trust eachother then thats all that matters.<br>  noone elses opinion is needed on love, because if so trust me, a lot of people would not be together .<br>  good luckk :)|`|xarKlp0Oaa	I think that it could work out if you both want it to.

How to do this, insist on watching the news channel when with parents, look up a topic of the day about government or the economy or health and start making up a lead question, make comments about observations of negative behaviors of teenagers - you will be selling yourself. And if the time comes for you to ask to go out, don't be overtly cautious and start over explaining things - keep it short and simple without raising any suspicion. Ensure you explain the transport arrangements and time frames beforehand without being asked.|`|2ncu2vmuaa	hmm do ur mom and dad trust u. building up trust will help alot :D that stinks u couldnt go...try showing them that u r responsble and no the basics (dont talk to strangers blah blah blah)...<br>  <br>  i hope this helps.....try going over to your friends house? do they let u do that?? or invite them over for a sleepover at ur house. <br>  <br>  oh yea...dont yell at them or anything...it makes the problem worse becuz they think u dont respect them. just say please and say im reponsible, i have a phone and i will call you a lot so u kno im all right, and that theyve taught u better than to do stupid stuff.<br>  <br>  <3 if they still dont let u than all i can say is wait till ur older :D they r just protecting u! <br>  <br>  good luck!|`|S9jmWU7Yaa	Have you established a curfew and all that jazz?

A guy that speaks minimally may have a lot going on in his mind. That's never a bad thing, to be soft-spoken.<br>  <br>  Heck, I'm 17 and I like a quiet guy right now. Though he seems a bit shy as well.<br>  <br>  All that's important to me is his personality. How he jokes around, spirituality, friendliness (which is still possible for a quiet guy)... there are multiple things that girls look for, besides how talkative people are. <br>  ___________<br>  <br>  It's okay. Don't change yourself for anyone. Just be who you are, and allow people to like you for who you are.|`|CXxdpkTIaa	Quiet people can be attractive because they're mysterious. <br>  However, you will need to start talking eventually otherwise yes, it will get boring. <br>  I think generally girls prefer guys who are charismatic, but not necessarily because often charismatic guys are arrogant or players.<br>  If you are reaally reaally quiet and want to stay that way, you should probably look for someone who also doesn't mind not talking much, unless you think you could step out of your comfort zone.|`|mH7XfYoVaa	it depends, you probably need a girl that's a talker though.  I'm a girl like you that doesn't talk much and I met this guy that is a talker and it helps so much that he talks even though we are just friends.

It makes them mysterious and makes a girl wonder what's going on in their head? What do they think about? <br>  <br>  It just makes me keep on thinking about a guy if they don't talk much or when they do, they are very vague. It's like.. what do I make of that?<br>  <br>  Uhm, I'm 14 and I wouldn't get bored of you. In school I'm quite shy, but out of school I'm a completely different person. I'm laid back, but energetic. I can remain quiet for hours at a time with no problem. You know you're in a good relationship when you can remain quiet together in a room without it being awkward. If that made sense. I guess some of us quieter people just have to wait for someone to come along or try to break out of our shell.<br>  <br>  Don't worry, you will find someone. :)|`|EKRUEYGRaa	Tell you the truth mate - No<br>  <br>  I was and still am shy and quiet into my 20's.<br>  It has meant i have never touched a woman.<br>  <br>  I can tell you two things about this that will get me lots of thumbs down but i wish somebody had told me this harsh truth at that age:<br>  <br>  1 - DO NOT listen to women (EG. above) when they say they like shy and quiet guys (confidence is key, this shows a lack of). They are lying/do not know what they really want.<br>  <br>  If there is you, a confident guy (not arrogant) and a woman in a room then 9 times out of 10 she will pick the other guy and you will be invisible.<br>  <br>  2 - CHANGE - As much as people will tell you "Be yourself" it will not get you anywhere im afraid. <br>  Learn to be more assertive and speak clearly. <br>  Always voice your own opnions and views even if somebody disagrees, dont just agree with what everyone around you says.<br>  Take a confidence and assertiveness course if you think it would help you.<br>  <br>  Good luck

That is whay when you find a friendship like that it IS a blessing,|`|VGij9p0Taa	I think friendship is a blessing because it is so hard to form and make proper friends most of the time your so called 'friends' are just acquittance's and not actual friends as you wouldn't tell them everything etc and you probably don't trust them 100% where as when you make a proper friend you trust them with everything and this is called a strong friendship. So this is a blessing as it takes longer to make real friends that's why I think it is called a blessing. I have only a few proper friends that I would trust 100% where as I have lots of acquaintances that's why I think people believe friendship is a blessing.|`|AA11441704	u can say anything and everything to them and still they are there......|`|jiqcLFdvaa	Dere is loadz of reasons.....<br>  <br>  And Im guessing you already kno them.<br>  <br>  Can you answer my question:<br>  <a href="http://uk.answers.yahoo.com/question/index;_ylt=AgCtd7WuUaLQvAJVHrkhvoggBgx.;_ylv=3?qid=20090307035013AArIjQK">http://uk.answers.yahoo.com/question/ind...</a>|`|2K6hHhUaaa	well because good friends really are a blessing and ur closest friends would be true to you and you can practicaly see yourself throught here eyes and therte nbetter for some things then parents <br>  Xd|`|ZO6QXAY5aa	Friendship is a blessing cuz not everyone has a friend.|`|xc8f2Bunaa	As what i have understood, the true meaning of friendship is never found.

Obale78taa	First.  Deep breaths.  Shake it off a bit.  Realize that what you created in your mind was an ideal of this wedding guy.  Not the real person.  You let yourself get swept up with the idea of this ideal guy who doesn't really exist.<br>  <br>  If you were to take the time to know this fellow, he might turn out to be alright but he'd never meet up with your fantasy ideal that you created.  If you were to date him for awhile you might find out that he's mean to the restaurant waitstaff, or that he shoplifts, or that he's a possessive little twerp.  You just never know.<br>  <br>  As to him being disappointed in meeting you, well he too had developed some fantasy as to who he was going to meet.  He'd thought it was going to be your cousin.  Don't take it personally.  You were Filet Mignon but he'd already got his tastes set for a juicy, swiss & mushroom burger.  Both are great.  But if you're thinking the burger when presented with a great tasting steak, well it is a disappointment.<br>  <br>  If you find yourself obsessing over the fictitious character you created in your mind still, there is a way to move past it.  Time will take care of it of course, but to move on quicker you need to distract yourself from the thoughts.<br>  <br>  To do this you set yourself a goal to speak to 5 new guys a day.  The conversations can be short, like 5 minutes.  But the goal is to put yourself a little outside of your comfort zone.  These guys can be young, like the teenager who bags your groceries; older, like the neighbor you meet going to your apartment; or around your age, like the guy one cubicle down from yours who you've never spoken to.  The guys can be your type or not your type.  Doesn't matter.  But your goal is to spend time talking to 5 new guys a day.<br>  <br>  A little stressed by this assignment?  You probably are, but did you notice that while thinking about this task you never once thought about "Mr. Fantasy Wedding Guy"?<br>  <br>  This is one of the useful techniques used for when you have a bad breakup and are sulking around about your old love interest longer than what is healthy for you.<br>  <br>  Also you need to allow yourself to trust that his decision was the right one.  That you're not his type at this moment.  That it would have not gone well if you two had tried forcing it over a date or two.<br>  <br>  So, do your task of talking to 5 new guys a day.  Chat with your good friends about this obsession that occurred for awhile and laugh about it.  Wish the fantasy guy good will and hope for the best for your cousin.  <br>  <br>  You'll do just fine, but good luck on moving past this quickly.

How are you?" or send a joke or ask something you know he understands a lot, something that interests him, but make it casual.<br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|Ujh2TE1daa	u should start conversation with for,al talk..like hi hw r u and howz study and talk related abut studies thus later on u will be friend....best of luck...|`|BnvHNVNvaa	say hey, whats up mr. ___(his name/last name)____. its friendly and flirty ;o|`|lKgzccMwaa	hi..your question is very interesting..<br>  if you and him are studying in same standard then you can ask for notes.<br>  you can ask i was looking at my old pictures and saw you in them....haha..i think this does help..hehe<br>  moreover you should tell him what you feel for him.<br>  you never know if he likes you too..<br>  good luck..!!|`|AC7x0keUaa	jus start of with <br>  "hey wats up?...im relle bored..talkin to random ppl.."<br>  then yu guys will start a convo...ask about skool ONLY IF YOU HAVE ABSOLUTELY NOTHING ELSE TO TALK ABOUT.|`|SvDjEdTnaa	did you see ( favorite show) last night it was so funny ( example Peter ate a pig)|`|UFWmwDS7aa	just send him a message. hey whats up?  it works for anything|`|ErmcT4uUaa	I would learn Klingon and talk to him that way.<br>  If he is into Star Trek he will think you are the Bees Knees.<br>  Good luck.
BRRcuXaZaa	well, in my opinion.. <br>  obviously not guy 1! dude, if you've asked him out twice before and he said no both times, he obviously isn't interested in you enough.<br>  <br>  and OBVIOUSLY not guy 3! so not worth any more of your time or effort! you've already gone out with him fourrrr times, and DUMPED him all four time! you even said "or i just didn't like him". trust me, he doesn't need to waste anymore of your time.<br>  <br>  guy 4 is a maybe. you said he seems to like you. smart and friendly are also good signs. looks don't matter too much. and having a lot of classes with him is a good way to get to know him.. so it depends on how you feel.<br>  <br>  guy 2 seems to be your favorite by the way you've described him. if your best friend went out with him and you two are no longer friends, then theres no harm in going out with the guy if you like him too. if guy 2 seems more reliable than guy 4, then go for it.<br>  <br>  all depends on the vibes you share with them, yah ? :]|`|6DxEDRReaa	Go for #2! He seems like the best guy by far. He seems like he has everything you want, while all of the other guys have some things but not everything.
9c16f104f9589fa27971d779def0ac39aa	And why do some men get needy and possessive when they're feeling insecure.  A coin has two sides.<br>  Honestly I think the entire fight was probably all built up on tension and stress.  You can't say either that you've never said things you didn't mean right?<br>  <br>  <br>  I would give it a day or two, let her cool off, give her some space, and then call her up and ask her if you could share your side of things, and allow her to share her own.<br>  When you're angry, your emotions get in the way of everything, you don't think clearly.. let the air clear ok?<br>  <br>  And don't point out all the things you've done for her in the past, I mean if she's neglecting everything you've done for her, then why's it worth being with her in the first place.. but if you truly love her, don't hold that over her head.  I'm sure she notices.. and remember all the lovely things she's done for you too!|`|ZKsSnT64aa	Get away from her and wait for perfection.<br>  <br>  I took my time with life and didnt just settle.<br>  <br>  Im 35 now,about to turn 36 and I found it 2 and 1/2 years ago.<br>  <br>  Weve been together ever since and yeah we fight but she has NEVER said a hurtful word to me.<br>  <br>  She thinks before she speaks and I like to think that I do likewise.

aWEybdDFaa	How does it make you feel when they come to your house? If, you don't mind it, so leave it alone. It's cool to have friends, so if you feel strange being around 7 men than call your friends and spend time with them.<br>  <br>  If it does bother u, sit and tell him when you two are alone.|`|LLeQyWGcaa	it is your house and you should not have to leave. I can't see anyone having to spend that much time with their friends and not with you. Tell him how you feel and that you cannot do the things that you would like to do around the house when they are here.  maybe they can go to someone Else's house once in a while. I sure wouldn't put up with it and if i asked him to cut back on his friends visits and nothing happened, i would send him a strong message by kicking him out.|`|OHfZFR31aa	It's your house too. Your husband needs to man up and tell his friends that they can only come over when he invites them - which might be maximum one night a week. He's got to realize that he's no longer a single guy who can just have his friends hanging out whenever they want. Why can't they go to one of his friend's houses once in a while?|`|97b7d9795e7ae2ee4648b9cbb2fe32a4aa	im in the same position. its so annoying to hear video games every night after work. i occupy myself. i clean and cook and do laundry and around 730 i tell him its time to pack it up. they usually listen. if they dont i scream. that always works too.|`|z7BTeUKvaa	You don't know how to ask your husband if he'd prefer you hang out with them or give them some time to themselves?

Just be glad they're not all out partying and leaving you at home.|`|AA10250918	I had the same problem not too long ago. You need to first try to become friends with these 6 people so that when they do come over, you can be involved and not be left out....and secondly you need to make some rules that everyone is aware of...Your husband needs to realize that he is a married man now and that you need his time and attention more than his friends do right now. These rules could consist of only 2 or 3 days out of the week for them to come over, out of the house by a certain time so that you and hubby can enjoy your evenings together, and maybe they should have a guys night out a couple times a month. (and a girls night for you!) <br>  <br>  You have to remember that to keep a relationship healthy, you have to balance your time with each other and with friends. Both are good, but too much of one or the other and you're headed down a rocky road!<br>  <br>  Good luck

Ic2DIR5Caa	The more you have available, the more customers will take you up on.<br>  <br>  I even read an article in the New York times a while ago about people increasingly wanting every wedding moment captured and hiring photographers to be "waiting in the wings" during the proposal to get those perfect first reaction shots.<br>  <br>  With the rise of social networking sites, people want to share more and more of their lives online, especially their wedding day. I think these packages could be really successful. I think it is a great idea, especially the posing lessons.|`|hsZnjZvoaa	Wow... <br>  <br>  I think if you structure your pricing right it may work.  I had never thought of a photographer going on a honeymoon.  That could cost a bundle... Of course, then you get to travel and do what you love at the same time.<br>  <br>  By structuring your pricing I mean if you set things up 'cafeteria style' <br>  each element of the package has a price, then a 'discount' for purchasing multiple pieces or a 'package'.  <br>  <br>  Good luck...|`|3WQOa4sraa	yea I like the idea of the hen and stag do pictures and the posing lessons, you could teach then this during the engagement shoot???<br>  <br>  But for the honeymoon, Its a lovely idea but personally would not really enjoy myself with someone taking photos of me and my man on our honeymoon, yes the pictures would be super but to me it could ruin it. <br>  <br>  that sounds a lot of money though

Honestly, my first time, it was with someone whom I loved and who loved me back, we respected each other, simple as that. :)  Don't go into bed with crazy expectations.. you'll probably be to distracted thinking about them, you'll miss out on the experience.<br>  As for the whole, being married, and sex afterwards, myself I'm not married, but from being a bridesmaid at a friends wedding, I can tell you, that my friend was way way way too plastered to be thinking of anything that night other then passing out.. same with the groom.  Pretty funny.|`|ZKsSnT64aa	On a first date,or any date, I keep my hands to myself and let the girl be the agressor.<br>  <br>  That way I never have to feel like I rushed someone.<br>  <br>  Ive had sex on a first date six times and I NEVER made the moves.<br>  <br>  The girl Im now engaged to slept with me on the first night.|`|4CMx1uzXaa	Property and profession eh.

But I like the thing that you are frank about what you are. You have pride in being what you are and what you have accomplished and even what you posses.<br>  <br>  Well about your first night. Hey don't complicate. Just be yourself and be willing to have sex with your partner on the first night. When you complicate and feel insecure you could make your spouse feel deprived or hurt or make them confused even if they are good to allow you to take your own time. You are marrying a guy they why make him wait unnecessarily?<br>  <br>  You too have by the age of 22 definitely developed a lot of expectations for sex. Don't you have a passion for it? Once you know who your would be is concentrate on the guy and try to give him all he wants don't make him just a doll on your bed. He needs to be a live person. Don't make him play patient and crown him a SAINT. He would rather have loved you moaning his name in Ecstasy!<br>  <br>  Treat your man with care and he is not someone who is robbing you of what you posses. The guy is gifting you himself and is to try to satisfy you in passion why do you want to curtail someones passions for having chosen you in marriage.<br>  <br>  Guys or Girls will want sex on bed on the very first opportunity provided you are wed in consensus and you both have a good understanding and you know each other  well. Your first night bed is not a round table conference for you to both interrogate each other as how true you both are etc etc. Bull S h i t I say be genuine. Play the games of youth that are meant to be the topic on that day!<br>  <br>  Sex will not hurt when you are prepared in mind. And preparing yourself for the same is your duty towards your beloved. DO it with DEDICATION. God Bless You.

YXRRpodKaa	I went though a similar problem back in September with my boyfriend. I told him numerous time before that incident that I didn't approve of him watching porn. He "promised" never to do it again, only for me to discover that he was behind my back. The last incident I almost ended the relationship.  I trusted him to stop and I actually believed he did. I felt so betrayed. It was the day of my mothers brain surgery. She was diagnosed with brain tumor and it was extremely risky and had to be removed. The day of the surgery was the first day of his classes at college. As much as I wanted him to be with me, I understood that he had to go to class. So we left for the hospital early in the morning. I remember calling him to make sure he was awake and ready for class. After a few missed calls he picked up. I assumed he was just getting ready. After the crazy wait of surgery. I returned home to spread the news of my mothers surgery to family via the internet. Right when I opened my laptop there was porn pop ups. I thought hmm, thats odd. but maybe its from one of his computer software sites. Then I hit back and the list came down, and it was a porn link. So I calmly closed the screen excused myself from my family. Brought him in the room and showed him. I remember his face. I felt sooo betrayed. I took 5 minutes away from being with my mom before she was wheeled into high risk surgery to call him, and at that exact time he was home masturbating to porn. I remember just punching him and he fell off the bed. Was weeks until I could even look at him. I cried for hours each night. Feeling so hurt. I never thought I could move on from that pain. Then in the midst of it all. I found out I was pregnant. So we had to discuss it. I had no problem in raising the baby alone and moving on from being with him. He promised never to do it again. So much that he got rid of his laptop, and we use mine now. He's barely on the computer and it records all of the history. He wanted to do that to prove that he could be trusted, and that he didn't "need" porn in his life. Its been 6 months, and he has so much pride that he's kept his promise. I'm just now starting to let my guard down, and realize hey.. He can be trusted. Our relationship has been great since. I find that he even respects and appreciates me more. He calls me beautiful and makes me feel pretty even though I'm 30 weeks pregnant and huge as a house. He's improved and grown as a person because he over came that. While he started out to prove he could be trusted, he also proved something to him self.  <br>  <br>  - Comment about Ashscorpio's answer - Obviously we know they are adults and welcome to do as they please. Like I've told my boyfriend on several occasions. You can do whatever you please but there are things I don't want in my relationship, drugs, porn, and lying. I told him that there are plenty of women out there who allow their men to walk all over them. Women who even allow their men to watch porn, and even join in. I'm not of then nor will I ever be and I stand by that. I told him he was welcome to walk if he couldn't meet those standards. I don't believe I'm asking for too much but if he thought I was he could find someone else because apparently "all" women aren't phased by it, and porn is "harmless." I think a lot of women lie about being okay with it. Pretend its not an issue and that they are "completely" fine with it. It's expected of us. To just sit back, shut up, and take the submissive role and accept a guy the way he is, THE END. Which I think is bullshit. <br>  <br>  So yes it is possible to rebuild. He has to be willing to make changes, and you have to be willing to put whatever you have left on the line to allow the time to change. You know your man the most. So do you honestly think he's capable of doing this change? I knew my boyfriend was capable, I just didn't know how long I could wait and suffer before I walked away. I'm happy I gave him another chance. At least now I won't be raising a baby on my own, and he's a better person. I think some people just need that extra push. My boyfriend is one of the people, otherwise he won't ever realize his wrongs.<br>  <br>  Good luck.|`|JlBcSqwpaa	Right now with his lying, no you should not trust him. If you confront him with his problems, or your issues with the internet porn he needs to be willing to make some changes or sacrifices. I have been married for five years and one year into my marriage my husband was injured on the job and began taking pain killers, I went through two years of him being addicted till he ended up in the hospital about to lose his life. It took us a very long time to get our relationship back to where it needed to be, but that required  changes on his part. Understand that lying and trust do not go together. If you love your boyfriend and he loves you he will give up porn, if it is an addiction then he needs help. But do not be fooled into thinking that you can trust a liar. If he lies about one thing he will lie about another.|`|DetuFlnDaa	Honestly, I am a female.. and anyone should be allowed to watch porn as they please. Unless of course its kiddie porn. He is obviously an adult, and you should treat him as such.<br>  <br>  If you would be a little more accepting of it, there would be no need for him to lie. So come to a common ground on that.
JxlaxOJTaa	Listen to me!<br>  My EXBF was exactly as mature as you are. I became unaware of loosing him and believed that he will never leave me coz I know he loved me so much. I hurt him many times(kind of same situation she is doing) though I love him so much, but i like it when he cried and beg me to not do such stupid things. i became so over confident that this guy love me so much. (I am actually 10years older than you guy's but still in same state of mind). Eventually he broke up with me told me his tired of all the fights, but he will love me forever. He is not kind of a guy who fool you, I know and I will trust him as always. He say whatever on his mind.<br>  <br>  Should I wait around for her to grow up and mature? Most of my CLOSE friends tell me to slightly move on and that she will come around realize what she has done and she will be suprised to see that im there for her or that im not there for her. and she will see that i really do care about her.....I wish my ex was thinking that way.<br>  <br>  I realized how much I love him and wants to be with him for the rest of my life, but he had moved on. Lesson for you is- even though you love her, don't let her to walk all over you. Show her that you will be fine even if she's gone, but even deep down inside u are hurting. In that way, she will respect you. She will realize every thing about you when she know she will totally loose you. I did! I just realized what I lost when my ex totally decided it's over. I didn't know it was coming, but now that I want to fix everything and will not hurt him anymore but it's too late. I can never fix it anymore. I was crashed, and felt like I lost the most wonderful guy in my life. I still and will Love him forever(I know I will because I never felt like it before and I am way too mature now). I gave his space, but i am not hoping that he will come and fixx it again. If he will I will let you know! I will never let him out of my life again, i will treasure everything and never let tears run to his eyes any more.<br>  But you guy's still have a lot of things ahead of you since you two are still on teenage stage. Just live for today, keep your love for her. I won't go and chase for love if you know somebody own's your heart at the moment. Just hang-out with your friends to ease the pain. Friends are helpful, but they are your friends-they will say everything that they think you want to hear from them. Pray, and pray! coz his the only one who know's what's best for you
QBCdt7K1aa	He's being a boy.  Boys are indecisive.  Also, it sucks to say but you might be moving to fast, how long have you known him?<br>  <br>  Your best bet is to talk to him soon and say exactly what you are thinking.  The best way to get a boy's answer is to be HONEST and DIRECT.<br>  <br>  Speak with him and say that you wonder why he is allowed to do things that you aren't, like asking him where he is.  Tell him you like him, and if you are willing to do it, say you would wait for him to decide if he's ready to get into a relationship.<br>  <br>  If he's not ready, then he's not ready.  There's nothing you can do about that except wait it out and be his friend, or move on to another guy.<br>  <br>  EDIT:  Yeah, screw that guy if he's talking like that.  Just shrug it off and say "Well, good luck with that".  If he likes you and is just afraid, he'll ask you to stay.|`|G40biNWMaa	i think he wants you to wait until hes ready to date...maybe he likes you but hes scared of being hurt or something..or maybe hes just looking for someone to get close to..friend wise. just someone he can be comfertable around and tell things to.|`|fTLwGi5Waa	i think he feels the same way just not ready to make the move to let you know he feels the same way. i guess he is having some problems committing due to past relationship going wrong. give it sometime hang out some more and go out on dates. let him you that you wanna get to know him more and build the relationship to where he is comfortable. i am like that too where i dont talk much, but once i got comfortable i can talk up the storm. so yea he just need sometime because i think he doesnt want to be on lock just yet, but he also dont want you to leave him alone so he has some feeling there just not ready to take the next step just yet|`|e224e1489b387127b36ae2f2d9fcd098aa	Just give him some more space dont rush things on him, and dont ask him lots of questions here and there, dont answer any as well, tell him u wan tto make sure how he feels, and if he still feeling NULL then leave him alone ad move on, maybe these stuff in his past life r still stuck and u dont want that in yr life.<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  _K_|`|EYNcybzLaa	well...take it slow let the love grow stronger....

Show him how much you care. Just don't be to stalkerish about it. XDD<br>  <br>  Give it time. I say, if he takes 3 weeks, forget him and move on to somebody else who deserves your time.|`|jXCjw64Iaa	Give him time. He is probably just a little apprehensive and unsure of what he is getting himself into. He is probably changing in ways he never imagined he would because he is going out with you...and sometimes its hard to surrender immediately to these new feelings. Give him time. Hes shy already so don't push him too fast. He will come around if he likes you as much as his friends say.|`|o2JQz9Pxaa	Some guys are really shy until the girl makes the move. They wont show any affection because he doesnt know whats gonna happen. So make sure he knows you really like him. Go up to him. Talk to him, try to hold his hand, just keep your hands on him. He'll like this. This will give him confidence. He should start talking to you and more:) goodluck|`|FOWQ8d0Qaa	make him feel comfortable, make him feel that hes a great person, eventually hell open up and be comfortable around u and will be able to talk to u bout anything ;)<br>  <br>  good luck!<br>  <br>  answer mine plz?<br>  <a href="http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;_ylt=AqSGyDlSVeycExmC.Mw4Sbfsy6IX;_ylv=3?qid=20090307080403AA8oTEt">http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;...</a>|`|XkPgw7ZRaa	Hold his hand and talk with him sharing your feelings.<br>  <br>  Anthony|`|zbiL6uMEaa	If his friends say he does still like you then i would go by them..they know him best.Boys always support each other when it comes to girls..believe it or not they talk about us as much as we talk and think about them..he's a little shy but he will open up more and more to you..dont give up on him yet..i think he still likes you !!..hope things work out for you too !!!  :P|`|gxuMbZzdaa	Talked to you about what? Maybe his problem is he feels like he has nothing to say. Make him feel interesting and he will more than likely open up. But be prepared, because you might find yourself listening to him talk about something you couldn't give a **** about.|`|G40biNWMaa	maybe if you open up to him it will show him that he can open up to you. show him that he can trust you (if you can be trusted) and just let him know that your there for him. dont pressure him into it though..he will tell you things when hes ready..|`|vqhet16kaa	go up to him maybe?... or tlk to him and say hey why dont u ever realy tlk to me?... i kno ur shy but since u dnt tlk to me tht much its kinda making me a lil bit unsure that u stil like me so do we need to tlk?... say that to him...?|`|TkgVGbj5aa	He likes you so much that he is nervous around you, after a while he will just be comfortable around you as if you were brother and sister give his some time to be comfortable around you.|`|RfthDLZ9aa	if you ask me, he likes you so much that hes afraid to loose you, you need to let him know how much care about him and like him, then he should open up to you, reassure him that yo wont leave him|`|zd08n44uaa	i think tht yu should hang out with him in person and tell him how yu feel bcuzz he probably doesnt kno what he is doing wrong bcuzz yur not telling him, so yu should tell him. but tht is probably rly annoying tht he doesnt tlk to yu. ha|`|Y3zx0qFeaa	give it some time, he will open up eventually|`|khTkA6Dqaa	maybe you should start talking to him and making conversations with him..asking questions can get you started and maybe making him open up a little bit. he does like you you just have to make him feel comfy..it should be the other way around but hey guys will be guys.|`|de47e4549c666a4e7558d1259d797024aa	if he is shy, you can start a conversation about something you both really like. I'm sure he'll be more than happy to talk about that, and maybe from there he'll talk about other things :)

8XKmMBU7aa	You are right. If you think the situation annoys you, No need to be her brides made. Some people are annoying and they always try to insulates. Don't care about them. Your relations are very nice with your friend. If there any problem comes in her marriage, your relations will be serious. So you think properly. I think there is no profite to be brides made. what can you say to your friend about her. Last thing, there is not any friend in whole the world. Please try to make God as your best friend. or yourself is your best friend. Don't take tension. eat, drink and be marry, far tomorrow we die. You may go to her marriage and after enjoying only a bit, you may come back.<br>  <br>  have a nice day and nice dream.|`|rlUUaSgqaa	I would talk to the bride alone and explain how you feel.  It sounds like the friend has a domineering personality or maybe is jealous of you and feels like she's in competition with you to be the bride's "best friend".  The bride probably doesn't even realize how you've been feeling as she's only been hearing one side of the story.  You can even print out what you've written here and show it to her since it explains your side very nicely.  <br>  <br>  I would be the better person and let the bride know that despite the drama you would still like to help her and will be there for her.  That will make you seem like the better friend.  If you just bow out of the wedding now, then you are letting the other girl win.  She will talk the bride into thinking you didn't want to be involved and that she is a better friend than you.  You may save yourself the hassle of this drama,but it will cost you your friendship in the end.|`|cdL4wzGbaa	Talk to the bride.She needs to know this.It sounds to me like her friend is jealous and is trying to be your friends new bestfriend.Oh no girl,you being the bestfriend need to step up.Dont let that other girl get to you.Thats exactly what she wants.|`|a93474086f6fa35adcb7945afb0f5aa4aa	if i were you i would say to your friend that you feel pushed out of her plans and that you don't think you can be a bridesmaid for her.|`|X3GjiecGaa	id say talk to the bride because the last thing u want is for u 2 to clash heads before the wedding its best to et everything resolved NOW. I know u dont want to bother her but she needs to control the situation before she looses you as a bridesmaid so i say talk to her about it n see what she has to say<br>  <br>  if she shows no interest then just either deal wit it or tell her ur not going to be a bridesmaid. the other chick shouldnt be starting drama this isnt her wedding|`|mkA615Ataa	It's a tricky subject to deal with especially if you want to remain friends with the bride to be. Best thing you can do is to maintain the peace with the other bridesmaid, if she says something snide, bear it as best you can. If she sneers at your ideas, say to the bride in a friendly tone "well it's your choice at the end of the day, just an idea", be civil and polite with the other bridesmaid to ensure the preparations and actual day go smoothly for the happy couple. Secondly, have a quiet heart to heart with the bride to be, apologise (even if you don't feel like you should) for not having been involved in the preparations so far, explain you've felt a little sidelined but you understand she and her old school friend have been catching up on old times, and let her know you really want to be involved, ask her what she would like you to do and if there's nothing right away, make sure she knows you're there when she needs you. If this fails you have done everything you can and have no reason to feel bad.|`|iDfRTLklaa	Just go ahead and keep on planning the part of the wedding that you are responsible for.  Some one has to act like the adult here.  The friend sounds like she is back in high school, and insecure about her friendship with the bride.  I would suggest not talking to the bride about it, as she is probably over whelmed with planning her wedding as it is.
MtQ9ea2Uaa	I ALWAYS THINK THAT!<br>  <br>  I don't think I am super paranoid but I don't post some questions because the situations are too distinct (even though I change the names and everything) that I'm afraid someone will recognize me. My friends love this site and whenever they mention it I always like to casually add "Oh, me too but I don't have the guts to make an account. Maybe one day". <br>  <br>  Okay, I'm pretty paranoid.<br>  <br>  But then again I have a picture of myself on here..<br>  <br>  Okay, I'm pretty stupid!|`|AA11447210	If that's the case, don't ask the question in a public forum.<br>  <br>  I don't ask many questions here, but I wouldn't ask a question at all if I didn't want someone in particular to see it (and I knew or suspected they also used this site).|`|IDnIo7wYaa	i think that all the time. and i even used his first and last name in one of my questions and then that account got suspended. he would obviously know it was me if he ever searched his name because of the situation. :\<br>  <br>  but maybe if he saw it he would really realize how much i love him. :)|`|oY1YzPMzaa	Lol its funny u say this! There was a question I answered a question about 20 minutes ago about a girl stumbled apon her guys question on her askin about he cheated on his girlfriend and what should he do.

So I would say be careful on here, it could come back on ya!|`|nVdYIHhzaa	lol no i never thought about that<br>  <br>  but i don't as a lot of questions and i'm not too paranoid to begin with|`|lTsONvwQaa	lol yeah i didnt tell any of my friends that i use this for that very reason|`|3Y9Gl6lQaa	well, first of all ur name doesnt look like it gives much away lol, and second out of all the millions of questions on here i doubt  theyd see yours. third, just dont give out identifying info like school name or ex's names or anything<br>  hope i helped.<br>  =))
61TcS8NBaa	well go into the conversation with some topics espically if you are going to call this girl simply write down some things that you like but you think she may like too. Also you could find things that she is interested in, Girls love it when you ask things to get to know them. Start with simple stuff like what things she does in school or her favorite things. This will help start off the conversation. The best thing is to just be you and let her know that you are interested in what she has to say.|`|0tL4zgTPaa	Ok.......lets see........u dint mention if you are from a boys school or co-ed......<br>  if you are from boys school i guess most of them have this problem......<br>  well.........its easy to talk to girls.......all you have to do is.....be confident about what you are talking........<br>  actually......most of the girls love talking so just let them talk you listen carefully as if you are very interested.......that helps......<br>  well topics are.......<br>  movies<br>  favourite colours<br>  hobbies<br>  food<br>  chocolates<br>  movie stars<br>  the first time where u saw her or what you thought about her<br>  jokes<br>  be sarcastic<br>  what you dont like<br>  keep asking her wat u doing???????<br>  wat plans next<br>  and that......regular normal stuff<br>  i hope i helped u......
cGbTJobeaa	Find the balance point between being a witch and an overly nice doormat.<br>  <br>  Don't waste sleep on the people who used and abused you not liking the fact that they can no longer use and abuse you. They need to get over it.  The more  you do to please some people, they are never satisfied and only increase their demands of you. <br>  <br>  The problem with being too nice and giving is that people don't respect you.  If you think about it; even Jesus set limits on when and who he would minister to. He didn't hang out with the rabbis, and He went off  alone to pray.  If He could set boundaries and limits, so can you.<br>  <br>  Find new friends who are worthy of you.|`|2JKt3Nkqaa	People used to walk on you and that's how it felt. I was the same, doing everything for everyone and when I started to get more confident they thought I was a mean b***h and they were really mean to me. I thought it was my fault as-well and I couldn't do anything. I felt trapped what should I do?<br>  Be stepped on and used as a chore machine or<br>  Be called a b***h all my life.<br>  <br>  I became both, mean when people deserved it and kinder to nicer people<br>  <br>  I hope I helped :)|`|SHARt1k3aa	Well, it's probably the way you go about it.  I mean, there is a way not to be a doormat, get your point crossed without being a "b."  You're most likely acting in a defensive mode and they feel that negatively from you.  Try approaching issues differently.|`|h6NqNzHAaa	The were not truly your friends in the first place. Continue to stand up for yourself and the "friends" who stick around are truly your friends. We all like to think we have lots of friends but actually we have many acquaintances and only a handful of friends.|`|P3RVJ1Y3aa	this may sound stupid but-- <br>  Going from door mat to ******* , Well find some peace in your self first.  It may be you tried to make others happy to make yourself happy. Then that having not worked moved on to throwing your weight around to get people to take you seriously.  Balance your mind and soul and people will feel that come from you in every thing you do.  Then people will be more a ease around you.|`|xr8j9Tjhaa	now is the time to start taking care of yourself. <br>  <br>  it is difficult for some people to care for themselves because sometimes we are taught that it is selfish but you would take care of yourself if you had a broke leg and your emotional/spiritual self deserves the same treatment.|`|YjaVT2JHaa	OMG! me too? im afraid of sitting in the front of the room bc im afraid that ppl will look at me|`|447b3c2cce6bc6d60c0a2667a9e8a9a9aa	Feels good to know I'm not alone.|`|i6Ix28IPaa	They treated you the way you allowed them to treat you--just like now.  You went from one extreme to the other and that was confusing to those who already knew you.  Settle somewhere in the middle.  <br>  <br>  Tell them what you've been going through, explain that you've been struggling and are trying to get a grip on who you really are.  Ask them to bear with you, and I'm sure that they will be more understanding and patient as you adjust.<br>  <br>  In the meantime, I recommend that you make new friends.  A fresh start will give you a new perspective and allow you time to settle into this new person you're becoming.|`|jdRKZe18aa	Well to be honest it isn't their fault that you allowed yourself to be a DOOR MAT for years nor is it their fault that you suddenly have decided to do a complete 180 on them and become someone that they don't recognize or know how to treat now?    Some adjustment is understandable for them and for you.  Maybe you need to find a happy medium in all this "CHANGE" your attempting.<br>  <br>  The change doesn't have to go from doormat to bee-otch.... there is a way to be strong, sure of yourself, be honest and straight forward with your feelings & opinions without being a turd too!  I think it helps to be honest with the people you honestly love, trust and NEED most in your life about what you are TRYING to morph into - so they can support, encourage, help and understand the process you are going through too.<br>  <br>  THe people that are genuinely your friends will be there and stick with you - the ones who don't - aren't worth your time, in my opinion.|`|dd2d386096f95b4c9c13d046234f4dddaa	If you started treating people badly, it's not surprizing they aren't in your life anymore.  There's a big difference between speaking up for yourself and being a b1tch.<br>  <br>  The fact that you recognise you are bitter and cynical at this point means you haven't resolved the issue.  You just substituted being a doormat to being a bully.  <br>  <br>  Consider being just who you are.  Do nice things for people because you want to, and expect them to treat you well at the same time.
2YKUepLjaa	I think it's pretty clear she isn't ready yet. <br>  <br>  Just wait until she's ready, don't push her and when she wants to go further, she'll let you know.<br>  <br>  Also, well done for waiting.<br>  It's so uncommon to find couples like you<br>  *applauds* <br>   :)|`|kTvn2Nltaa	If this is a really good relationship, don't F it up by trying to get some.

No one should be forced to go further than they want to, so there is no way to "get her to go further" without breaking the law.  She obviously doesn't want to go further with you or she wouldn't "take your hand off" when you try to touch her.  You are just going to have to wait until she is ready.

2cb46ea6e0285a7d419967ceaef6f993aa	We used a song by Stephen Curtis Chapman called, "I Will Be Here".  It would be perfect for a vow renewel ceremony because it talks about growing older and how no matter what you will be there for each other.

If you go ahead with the pregnancy, you can force him to get a paternity test or you will sue him for child support.<br>  <br>  D. Stop recruiting your army-of-friends in what is still pretty much a personal issue between the two of you.

Most of them offer free consultations and you are under no obligation to retain their service. Set up an appointment with one, tell them your story and see what they think. <br>  <br>  I hope it all works out for you, Seems like more and more 'females' are starting to suck the life and money out of their men. Thank god I'm not and NEVER will be a materialistic woman.|`|SHARt1k3aa	I don't think you can get any of it back.  Are you sure it's because of the money.  Sometimes people like to blame their faults on other things.  I know this guy that recently got a ton of money, almost two million.  He bought a house, car for him and his girlfriend, toys, but then started treated his girlfriend bad, he wouldn't come home, not call, so she started to stay at her moms, more and more until she moved out of the house.  By that time this buy blew all of his money, in two years time.  He's blaming her for the same reason... "now that the money is gone you want to bail," but it had nothing to do with the money at all, it was his behavior.  So, just make sure that it's because of the money.  There is no way you can get money back for a wedding that's done and paid for, no way.  You consented to it.|`|KwNpyp3saa	Let me try to understand this. You spend 36 on the wedding or in general since you've been married to her?

Sorry.|`|Chib4b8saa	If you can in some way prove that she was only in it for the money and then left when it ran out; then you stand a pretty good chance in court.

9HCA1sdlaa	There is a ringleader in the group. That leader is the most insecure person and has other friends around them that are also insecure so they group together and validate eachother so they can feel secure. Pretty much the more they prey the better they feel. If you completely ignore them they will see they don't have power over u which will definitely mess them up.

You can often rent parks, community centers and halls from the city for a good price. The nice part about renting from the city is that they usually let you bring in your own food and alcohol...not to many places will allow you to do that these days. <br>  My friend had her reception at a local Elk's Lodge. She was able to get a great price on the lodge and they were fairly acceptable of outside food/drinks...but each lodge is different. <br>  You can check out the Elks lodge in Grand Rapids. Looks like they have some nice banquet facilities:<br>  <a href="http://www.grandrapidselks.org/banquets.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.grandrapidselks.org/banquets....</a><br>  You can also try places like Women's Clubs, Knights of Columbus banquet halls, etc. They usually have halls available to rent as well.<br>  Good luck to you!

ocG7G0N2aa	I am going through a similar situation. My boyfriend of 2 years has lied to be several times, all over looking at internet porn. I am having trouble with trust issues. I think that he sounds very similar to your man. I think that men are afraid of commitments, afraid of letting go. Men are raised to think that once you enter a relationship, thats it, your life is over, so naturally when faced with commitment, many shut down and push away. I am not sure if it has anything to do with us at all, I feel that it is more to do with the insecurities they have. <br>  You have to find something outside of a relationship that moves you, that gives you passion, mine is art. I just have faith that there is that person that will give me everything I want, and that I am too good of a person to settle for less|`|SxgOy9uPaa	Forget about his "EGO"that's his problem not yours..Just be yourself & enjoy life..|`|jHyDO7rcaa	Dump him and move along.

SxqYguUCaa	It sounds like you don't trust him. I think that's the issue here. He wants to see his daughter- what isn't to understand about that? She's his own flesh and blood. What is so wrong in that? It seems like it's a lack of trust and that he may do something with his ex wife. If you don't trust him fully to visit his daughter with his ex-wife then you shouldn't be talking marriage.|`|Mubj1o2eaa	Of course it's natural to think something fishy of that, but if you really love him, you just need to trust him. A relationship is based on love and trust, and if you don't have those 2 things, then you arent going to be good in the long run. It isnt a crime to want to see your child, but if your really that uncomfortable about him staying with his ex, then talk to him about it and tell him how you feel. If hes worth it, he will try to understand and see where your coming from, and he will make plans to stay at a hotel or his sibling's house. Good luck =)

DgFhlJvYaa	Nothing in life is free. That's the way my sister was but I told her to get off her a$s & earn what she wants. She lived with my mom, stepfather & myself but she was always so lazy & I couldn't get her to do anything. I was in school at the time & my sister would make me clean the house when I got off of school which only gave me 30 min to do so. Finally 1 day I just walked in the house & it was disgusting. I walked back to my room & lay-ed down & feel asleep. My mom came home yelling at my sister & that day my mom told her either you clean my house since your not in school & don't have a job are you can get outta my house.

SovaFpN8aa	Contact your local child support agency. Ever state has slightly different rules. He probably will not have to replace the car, and any previous support he can document, he will be given credit for. But the state agency can set up a child support plan. This might make him refuse to give you any extra money when you call him for help.|`|03ec65bf77c70de35e61bf195676e487aa	Unless there is a court order, no he doesn't have to pay you child support.

It doesn't matter where you live - he is still the father. Go to county court where you live and get a hearing for custody and child support so everything is legal. The courts will base his child support amount on his monthly income - and if he doesn't pay it will be taken out of his paychecks.<br>  <br>  As for the car, he does not have to buy you another car. He was under no obligation to buy you a car to begin with. If you were not legally married, then he doesn't have to pay you anything now that you are apart. If you were legally married then the courts would award you alimony as well as part of your common assets.

At least by purchasing the things himself he can make certain that his son is being provided for.  No the court will not make him buy you another car.

If not, then he is legally obligated to support the child (state laws differ though), but only with a court order. <br>  Look in the phone book for the phone number for family court and ask them how to go about applying for child support. You will have to go to court and the judge may set up visitation as well. You said you are in a different county (or did you mean "country"?) - be prepared to have to get  this child to dad's house or find a way to pick him up.  <br>  You said he refuses to give you money, but yet he buys the kid things - that is a good father.  Everything he has done so far has not been a legal (albeit is a moral one!) obligation. <br>  You are lucky he bought you a car too - he is not obligated to do that. He will NOT be forced to buy you another either. <br>  You are supposedly mature enough to have a kid, so you need to start making a life for yourself and the child, and not rely so heavily on him. It sounds like you expect this man to supply everything for you. Stand on your own two feet.

uwkA651Baa	It's cheating whenever you voluntarily have sex with someone else, male or female. Maybe if you were drunk or somehow forced into it, then maybe not cheating.|`|CSWNU2REaa	Yes.|`|tSjJpjzKaa	yes it is
ErmcT4uUaa	Your day will come and we'll have everything. <br>  You will share the joy falling in love can bring. <br>  No one can tell you  that you're too young to know <br>  Your day will come|`|LGCLmUTnaa	Um.. I'm not exactly sure, but if you're asking yourself and others "Do you think we're too young," you're probably too young. I bet you guys really do really like each other, but it can't be actual love. I went through the same thing as you are now, and once you get older you'll realize you guys were just infatuated with each other, you weren't actually "in love." To the idea that you guys will stay together forever, I can't argue with that. No one can tell the future, so it could go either way.|`|zd08n44uaa	im 15 and ive had a lot boyfriends haha.  i dnt think yur too young. . yur living in the moment and what yu think is right and thts good. the ppl tht are saying tht just really care about you and dnt want yu to get hurt. my mom didnt want me to go out with anyone until h.s too but tht didnt happen ahah i told my mom and she was like uh ohkay ha but yur deff not too young.|`|6ulA6MVVaa	aw tht soubnds really sweet! i had my first boyfriend in kindergarden and have had boyfriends ever sicne so u are nawt 2 young......in my 8th grade class (13-14 year old) out of the 30 kids in one class, 20 of them had a boyfirned on girlfriend.......most people wil at your age! if your in love, u cant change that! im happy that u found your man cuz im sitlll looking! 0 i hope this helps! and if u have anymore questions or just wanna chat email me at neon_rainbow99@yahoo.com :)|`|RCpGtKwOaa	HOnestly, you sound like your age. <br>  <br>  I'm not going to say its not love (who am i to know?) but there's a higher chance it is only lust. I know that may not be what you want to hear, but its the truth. <br>  <br>  If you love him, age shouldn't matter. :) Its not about what WE think, its about how YOU FEEL :)
e224e1489b387127b36ae2f2d9fcd098aa	Well it might be this or it might not be, what u should know and tell him that he should respect yr wish and leave things as it is now, u will do it when yr ready not before.<br>  <br>  And sure do it with someone that respect u for what u r and not just for sex.<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  _K_|`|SGjhNidDaa	the fact that he pressures you when he knows that you arent ready shows that your relationship might be based on lust. im sure he will say he loves you but it sounds to me like he is looking for a physical relationship right now, and you are not ready. if i were you, i wouldnt want to do anything that sexual either and i would probably move on to someone who could respect me for that and not make me feel pressured or uncomfortable. best of luck :)|`|zFqJpKrraa	oh. well, nobody can ever ever make you do anything you dont want to. if you feel that the relationship you have is real love, then by all means, do what you feel's right. but if you're totally not ready and he continues to pressure you, then just dump him. you would be able to find someone who respects your boundaries. good luck, luv!!|`|myZB9DV3aa	Firmly tell him that you are not ready yet, and do something else with him..... but don't just dump him yet, see how things go after your talk, then. Lmao, poor guy's gonna be heartbroken IF you do dump him|`|AA11388175	he's making you do things you dont want to<br>  he doesnt LOVE you, he just wants sex...<br>  get rid of him|`|QqY8YgGDaa	First marriage<br>  -If you two are ideal partners ,any one will be happy to help you to marry.

And if he can't take your answer then get the hell out. And mean it.

Best of Luck.|`|Mxe36NZEaa	Don't do anything you aren't comfortable with. But don't wreck a 3 month relation ship over a small issue.|`|3aeBqLORaa	no leave him if he wants you to do sex but your not ready tell him and if he dosnt like it lose your virgenity after your in love and hopfully maired!|`|0y64qUHOaa	aNYONE WHO PRESSURES ANOTHER PERSON TO HAVE SEX ( OR CLOSE TO IT)  DOES NOT CARE ABOUT YOU OR YOUR FEELINGS!!!!

If your answer is no, that should end the discussion.  It's only been 2-3 months too.<br>  <br>  Maybe he's feeling that the relationship isn't growing, since you only see each other once a week at your house.  Try mixing it up a little!  Call him up, go for breakfast, go to a movie, go for a walk!  He's dating you!  I think you can still see him more then once a week and still give him space!<br>  <br>  I would definitely mix it up a little and if you're still feeling pressure from him, then break it off, but first give it chance, do something new!  Go biking together ya know?  Lots of options!|`|0H9Y99Kwaa	Yes should be saved for someone special...you should never feel uncomfortable. A boy that pressures you to do things doesnt really respect you, personally i think you should end it or talk to him. If you are not ready you are not ready, and if he doesnt respect this dont you think he is just with you for the sex? I know so many people who haven't done anything sexual or lustful yet....itsd not something you should be rushed into|`|rNUB8B6Vaa	If you don't wanna do anything, you don't have to, period. Don't let him pressure you into it. If he can't respect you for that then get him outta your house. I mean if you wanna wait then wait.|`|dMjqsxD3aa	Don't get pressured into doing anything you dont want to do.. and if you feel he is often pressuring you into doing uncomfortable things you should break up with him.|`|S9jmWU7Yaa	If that's really how it seems, then END IT RIGHT NOW.<br>  Don't ever let him pressure you into having sex. EVER. You'll regret it.|`|RfthDLZ9aa	you have to explain to your boyfriend that it's not his desicsion for you guys to have sex, or things like sex. if one of you guys dont agree to have sex, you dont do it ! my boyfriend would never pressure me into sex or things sex related. if you explain to him that you feel pressured by him to have sex, if he really likes you he will stop, if he dont you desserve much better ! And it's definately not normal for teens to have sex ! its very dangerous and theres no such thing as safe sex, or sex related things ! If your not readlywhich i agree your not, DO NOT DO IT !|`|eLH97QiEaa	he's a guy and guys do this i myself used too do that with my girl friends. It is really hard for a virgin not too ask or beg for sex that often because people make it into such a big deal. Sex is going to ruin a relationship so just stay strong and keep saying no. I've been there and done that and at the end of the day i wish i was a virgin again. If you do do it he will have no clue what he's doing and you will try to pleasure him. You might even get to the point where you want to break up but can't because he was your first.|`|ls8KNu9uaa	That depends.<br>  <br>  If you're a girl or woman, then you'd have to understand that the best way us men can communicate our love, is through sex.<br>  <br>  Women show their love by giving sentiments, showing care, and talking just about anything.<br>  <br>  Now, it's not really a matter of right or wrong. Because when you think about it, in a relationship, there really is no such thing.<br>  <br>  What I'm trying to say is, that it's up to you and your partner. If you're not ready for sex, then don't do it. If you're having second thoughts since he persistently insists, then it's up to you if you want to have it with him.<br>  <br>  You may want to have a little values clarification as well. And find out for yourself, what is holding you back. Guilt from parents? Pregnancy scare? STD? Fear of the unknown? or religion does not permit? <br>  <br>  Once you identify what is keeping you from having sex with your boyfriend, then you might as well help him understand. <br>  <br>  Communicate with your boyfriend about this. If you guys really love each other, I'm sure you'll both be able to meet half way about this.|`|y5wvKdTGaa	I had an ex that did the same thing! He would ask me when I walked into the door "Are those pants going to come off? I want to know so I can get prepared" and he would push and push. <br>  <br>  Don't have sex if you don't want to. I'm 16 and I just don't think I'm ready because sex can lead to a bunch of different things. It also doesn't make you feel used or dirty - basically meaning it doesn't feel like he is just using you for sex. <br>  <br>  Don't give into him, your first time (I would assume by the question) should be with someone you care for a lot. Not someone you have dated for 2-3 months. I have had friends who have gotten pregnant and have had the guy leave them and another friend got HIV from a one night stand. <br>  <br>  I don't think you should if you don't want to - or if you are willing to accept the consequences. I have a lot of friends who would die to still be a virgin because the say sex makes everything complicated.<br>  <br>  Good luck :]
etV271ARaa	I think he got spooked and reacted like an idiot and regrets now. But having said that, you need to know if youre reading too much into this. He could be trying to be friends with you and nothing more. Or maybe he likes someone else. Like the other answerer said, the ball's in his court now. Let him make a move. If he doesnt, too bad for him. He could also be trying to move closer to you now that he's had time to think about it. But dont appear too desperate. You broke the ice. He knows how you feel about him. Let him make the next move|`|AA10887916	Leave it be - you asked, he refused.  Ball is in his court now.  The only possible thing you could do would be to let some of your mutual friends know that you are still interested in him and see if that brings any developments.

I mean sure you can be busy a lot but why ignore your bf when your with friends? That really annoys me and also saying "oh im ugly" bla bla bla, etc, etc when they probably are 1 of the most beautiful girls you'll ever see seeking for attention.<br>  2- No I'll work out slowly as just starting as a friend or hopefully she'll feel the same about me.<br>  3- It's the same thing with girls when they are on their 'period' or have moods swings. You take all your anger out on your boyfriend giving him a lot of crap. It's just the natural way of life...mood swings, hormores, etc.<br>  4- What's the point of having a girlfriend then? No I have never loved any girl in my life when I was with my girlfriend but it's a possiblity and you never know what goes on through their mind. Time will tell.<br>  5- I don't know every guy is different. Some guys move their legs or shake a lot. Other guys will mumble while speaking. Other guys will act just natural.<br>  <br>  And what I'm thinking of is why do girls always are never satisfied in a relationship and have the need to cheat or find a problem with the guy and then dump him and break his heart.
f5FmJRfIaa	When you feel ready.<br>  When you are in a relationship you feel good about.<br>  When you feel your relationship is committed and long term.<br>  When he is ready to consider your health and well being.  No glove, no love.  If he's not ready for that, he's not ready for you either, and likely to get you pregnant or give you an std for not thinking about anything beyond his own selfish sensations.<br>  Never when you feel pressured.<br>  If he tells you that if you don't it means you don't love him, dump him.<br>  You absolutely should wait for a special boy, you deserve for your first time to be special, and because you are giving yourself in love to him.  If all you want is an orgasm, you can give that to yourself.<br>  You'll never get another chance to do it right, so do it as right as you can.<br>  A lot of girls will throw it away early because they want to feel like adults or something, but many of those girls you know will learn to wish they had waited later on.|`|x2tX5GiWaa	How old are you?<br>  And it should be in your own bed !<br>  When no body is in or it will spoil it, use protection and make sure there will be no disturbances and don't rush it, take it one step at a time or you will regret it.<br>  Hope i helped = ]<br>  Good luck ; ) <br>  x
AA12322129	He is your ex.  What he pays out for other kids is not your business.  What you should worry about is the kid you have with him.  Find out what you can get for her instead of worrying about what the other kids get.  Actually, that is set in stone.  You will get something but not as much for her as the other kids get depending on how many there are.|`|OHfZFR31aa	$2400/month does not sound like that much for alimony plus child support for 2 or more children. It all depends on his salary. I know a guy who is paying $3000/month just in alimony to his ex-wife.|`|e276df96c55a338c1e69a8869d0cd199aa	He's your ex, it's none of your business what he pays.  Get over yourself.|`|z7BTeUKvaa	It's none of your business.  If your daughter is still young enough to receive child support, take him to court.  How much your daughter receives is your business, how much his ex receives is not.|`|th7C1aoaaa	check with the states court system.|`|NlYGbqnkaa	I pay child support on 2 children. When I go to court for support evaluation my wages for the prior yr they are openly discussed in court in front of my ex-wife. The way it seems to work in Michigan is I pay a lot for the first child and it drops for the second. I only have 2 so that is where it stops. On that scale tho if I had lets say 5 kids by the time they would get to the 5th I wouldn't have to pay much at all for that one. If you have the friend of the court re-evalutate your support they will figure out what your supposed to get. I know in Michigan all you have to do is pay like $60 and fill out a paper.<br>  If you don't think he is being fair.... have them look at it. <br>  I don't think their is any reason he should not have to pay for his child whether he see her or not. His daughter should have all the financial benefits of having 2 parents whether he is in her life or not. Its not her fault he wants to disappear and leave her fatherless. So regaurdless if he is active in her life or not he should help pay her way. That is a choice he is making not her.

HnEcgVGiaa	If you're asking him to go to sleep at a "normal" time one night so you can sleep in and he can take care of the kids, it could be very difficult for him. Remember that he's used to sleeping at 3 and getting up at 9:30 throughout the work week. It's rather difficult for him to alter his sleeping pattern, and this can really frustrate people when it's disturbed. It's not good for his health either. Maintaining a constant sleeping pattern promotes a healthy and alert brain and a good mindset. So without a good night rest, it's difficult for anyone to be romantic. They only care about re-energizing their body somehow.<br>  <br>  Perhaps you can ask him if he can change his work shift. It's a long shot, but worth asking. Or perhaps you can try those medications that help you get a long, restful sleep.<br>  <br>  Don't let this change how you first viewed him when you accepted his proposal years back.

FocBqCqlaa	she will love the question! dont worry, you wont ruin it. She most probably can sence that your going to ask her out anyway. If she says no then just tell her, your just going to be her best friend still. She wont mind you asking her out! infact she will like that idea! and actually when you ask her, say it kindly, and not embarrasing! Good Luck. ;) hope she says yes! ;)
AA12346188	Both of you are possessive.<br>  She as a Mother.<br>  You as a Girl friend.<br>  Both are right in your own way.<br>  What is there to comment.<br>  Both of you should learn to share the person equally.|`|71VRvldJaa	If it's HIS mother, it's up to him to resolve the problem.  If it's YOUR mother, it's up to you to resolve the problem.<br>  If you try to tackle it on your own, without your boyfriend's support, you're going to bury yourself even deeper in her bad books.|`|Z1NlYGExaa	The question is is she coming between you for the good or bad?  Also, the way she acts towards you could tell you something about the relationship... how far do you plan on taking it? Because, how will your relationship be effected if you marry into the family?|`|X05GAaLeaa	Ummmm , ignore it depends on why she is doing it , if you think its for some bullshit reason , then dont let her win the war , just ignore her , if you think there may be a reason then think about it , her judgement may be correct|`|xarKlp0Oaa	Try ro respect her because she is his mother.

gRXy66dOaa	Here are some tips for on how to get a guy to like you*<br>  <br>  Be an all-around great person. If you focus on being a clean, motivated, kind, and humorous individual, how can anyone resist? <br>  <br>  Some guys might be intimidated, and they're too insecure to be worth your interest anyway. But it's only a matter of time before a guy who can like you for who you really are will come around and see that you're an awesome person to be around. <br>  <br>  Some people prefer being friends first, others prefer to avoid the "just a friend" zone. Ideally, you can be a little bit of both--a friend and a romantic interest. <br>  <br>  Keep in mind that you cannot control what other people think and do. <br>  <br>  He may be the object of your interest, but that does not create any obligation that you be his. Turn the situation around. If there was some random guy who took an interest in you, is there anything that he could do to make you like him? Probably not. You will like him or not. <br>  <br>  You will find him attractive or not. You will find him funny or not. All he can do is try to be the best person he can be, and hope that you agree. The reverse is also true. Be the best person you can be, and let it develop--or not--from there. <br>  <br>  Don't talk about your other prospective guys with the guy you're interested in. It's just not good form, and it's a good way to get rid of him. <br>  <br>  If there is no sign of him being interested in you, that doesn't necessarily mean that he isn't interested. He could just be shy, or be a little frightened, especially if he hasn't dated anyone for a long time. <br>  <br>  And don't forget to smile! It's an age old, safe way to extend and invitation to a guy to socialize. Plus it's totally free and increases your face's real estate value instantly!|`|MzanmVtdaa	u dont. love isnt a force. its just nature. it goes how its supposed to go. move on, coz hes not teh one if he dont like u|`|I1fQi4Ubaa	you can't MAKE him like you.<br>  guys dont really like clingy girls.<br>  <br>  just first get to know him, and talk to him.<br>  one day when your in class or in the hallways just say hi and start from there.<br>  <br>  answer mine please?<br>  <a href="http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index?qid=20090307085456AAkghJz">http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index?...</a>

XGn2NREraa	Exclusivity<br>  <br>  When you are dating, there is an unspoken statement that you cannot see other people. She is implying that yes,m she went out with him, but there was nothing beyond a kiss or two.<br>  <br>  If she had slept with him, then he has a full right to be upset. This is considered a "no harm, no foul" situation
61TcS8NBaa	That is a big emotional commitment. I would say to wait because the probablitly that the two of you will stay together is already low and once you venture into this emotional connection you are much more likly to break up.
2a93295e665a94d49d03426e34243078aa	????????Well, I'm on my fourth marriage and I'm pretty ashamed of that fact.  However, I didn't actually find a true relationship with Jesus until 1995 -- which was during my third divorce.  Each of those divorces were due to adultery on the part of my wife.  I wondered what was wrong with me that I keep picking those kind of women.  This marriage, though rocky, is different from those before -- in some way.  I'm pretty confident that this one won't commit adultery.  I've made quite a mess of my life, but I'm thankful Jesus accepts me the way I am and then encourages me not to stay messed up.  As the song goes, He will make something beautiful of my life.  The same goes for you -- as long as you make God your number one priority.<br>  <br>  God bless.|`|NlYGbqnkaa	In my opinion you need to put your life back together and fix it before you worry about getting married again. I know you can do it. I had to do the same. Once you become used to taking care of yourself and not relying on someone else and become comfortable with that, then if you find the right person feel free to pursue marriage. I think a lot of people try to find happiness with someone else and aren't happy with themselves. This doesn't ever work...Discovering the difference between wanting someone and needing someone is huge!|`|UUrqECXIaa	It's not wrong to remarry again if it feels right to you. But I certainly would not make finding number 4 your priority. Enjoy life as a single person. If you do find yourself contemplating another marriage, remember what went wrong the first three times and make sure you are not going to repeat the same mistake by marrying a person who is not right for you. Sometimes I think we are attracted to people who really are not right for us, subconsciously we seek out the same type of person over and over again.|`|RgceFQ9Caa	If you find someone who shares your standards and the two of you find you can love and cherish each other then, no, it would not be wrong to marry again late er in life.  Since you say " after 30" I assume that you are less than 40.  You are young yet.<br>  <br>  Good luck|`|GsSRY7quaa	you need to figure out why the first 3 marriages failed. then try to correct those problems before even considering a 4th.|`|vk3dKR3Caa	You take one day at a time, I to have 3 failed marriages, the only different is I am 50. No it would not be wrong to get married again, but this time take your time and make sure he is what you want and need, date for a while.  ONE DAY AT A TIME.  there is someone out there for you. good luck.|`|ULUpOqplaa	I got married at 25.  It lasted about a year.  I got married again at 40.  It is now pushing 20 years, and there were a lot of adventures in between.  Almost 10 years ago we ran off to a tropical island and hacked a paradise out of the rain forest.  There is a lot of life after 30 and 40 and 50 and 60.

xoXkHOVsaa	I don't think she misses you.  If she broke up with you to spend time with her friends, that says it all.  You were never that important to her.<br>  <br>  Make sure your next girlfriend isn't under 18.  You could go to jail for what you did!|`|AA10905966	Yeah she misses you girls try and cover it up but you should wait for her to go to you although she would better yet want it the other way
ErmcT4uUaa	I can solve your problem real easy. Set me up with the anorexic Canadian chick. That way she will be with me and leave your boyfriend alone.<br>  See how great a plan this is.<br>  Send me her photo so i know if she is worth my time and we will go from there.|`|r5w32XFHaa	sweety guys cant stop lusting even after they get married to the hottest chick in the town... they want all the unavailable women... something which is in there genes... so relax... ur guys seems to b honest to confess all this 2 u... some1 else might not have done that|`|QWo8Wgzcaa	i've been with my girl for over a year, i plan on getting married and spending my life with her. i love her very much and would do anything i can for her. but i'll always like to look at an atractive girl and will never turn down flirtatious behavior. if a girl wants to hug on me or touch me, i'll let her. guys like to know that they're atractive and could get a girl if they wanted to, it doesn't mean they'll cheat on you but it does mean that you need to keep letting him know he's "still got it" or you could lose him down the road. and don't forget the part that you need to please his desires as well
AA12198711	The family that cares enough needs to get him in rehab and learn with him how to rise above the disease.
JfeLb2Ptaa	Don't feel bad. I feel like the type of person that would get herself in a situation like that also, but you totally did the right thing. Guys can be immature and dumb at any age. You told him straight up that you didn't want to talk to him anymore and he reacted in a way I've seen so many guys react in. He started saying how much he loved his wife, as to say that you took it the wrong way or something and that it was never like that with you. Ugh. Men. That is the sh*t he gets for playing games like he did. Let him be stuck with that b*tch of a woman. He was the one that kept it all a secret and made it more than it was. He was just making the whole situation bad for you. Good job on doing the right thing.|`|sA5Td5vAaa	why do you not feel so bad about it all,<br>  think hard and you'll find the answer!!|`|r5w32XFHaa	what u did is right... u need to get over him... if possible get out of that friends circle as it will hurt u more & more... start beleieving that u were 100%right & move on in life...|`|yRCBRNOgaa	I think that this guy is not a good person. He should have not kept your friendship a secret. Don't worry about hurting him, frankly, in my opinion, he deserved it. He sounds like a total player.<br>  <br>  The wife is just jealous but can you blame her? Her husband likes to talk to other women online... I would be mad and hurt too. I really don't think she's the enemy in this. <br>  <br>  You did the right thing by disassociating yourself with him. He was a PLAYER. Get over it. You deserve better relationships. Don't settle for a lying, two timing, jerk like that guy. Focus on getting a 100% baggage free guy who can focus on you without the drama.<br>  <br>  Good luck and strive to be with the best guy, you deserve better.|`|G4dP3wbSaa	He is a married man, meaning off limits.  I don't think you should email him anymore since you know the situation and that his wife is not feeling the relationship.|`|5a5a587925ecd245838b8446f97300fbaa	HE IS MARRIED,stay away from him..............u have a huge problem,and u shouldnt try to have friendships with a married man its OFF LIMITS...........its a holy thing that single woman need to just stay clear of.his wife has all the rights to question u and any friendship u think u can have with a man that is married.find someone who is single and have a healty relationship and stop trying to get drama in your life.........|`|lYZ71zYAaa	And so what is your question??
m5AN26Voaa	yeah if she passed on this day 5 years ago than yeah|`|BddRfJ2caa	She probably is depressed, so stick by her and try to comfort her. If she gets emotional its better to leave her alone and DO NOT make fun of her.

First love!|`|rlUUaSgqaa	My parents did and they have been married for over 40 yeas.|`|8ac2e5cbdd946ee60c803052559873c5aa	No.  He was 14.  I was almost 16.  It was brief.  I don't think it went beyond some hand-holding, but he might have kissed me on my 16th b'day.|`|lvzlpjl2aa	technically yes... i met my husband in college many years ago. we hung out a few times but weren't interested in each other as much back then. we weren't very experienced relationship wise, plus we were only 19. then i met another guy whom i became involved with very briefly. and now years later i ran into my (now) husband outside my old job, and we've been together for 3 yrs... married for 1. <br>  <br>  but my aunt and uncle were first loves. they met in school.. like middle school back in Mexico. Now they've been married for about 40 years.|`|OHfZFR31aa	Some friends of mine did. They met when she was 14 and he was 16. They didn't get married until they were 26/28 and are now 43/45 and still going strong. He's the only person she's ever slept with. He did sleep with another girl when he went away to college his first year but that's it.
8vTLjNzfaa	thats not strange, sometimes you may just feel that you cant be bothered and just because you dont go out with your mates every weekend isnt strange at all<br>   <br>  to be quite honest, family are more important and you should have close bonds with each of them, friends are important too, and spending time with family when your younger can be better to build a stronger relationship with them. <br>  <br>  i think staying in, in any case, is better than going out and getting drunk.<br>  <br>  hope this helped<br>  <br>  -------<br>  Usman|`|izBsVtXJaa	Well i do go out with my friends every weekends but i found it borring well it is up to you but my advise would be don't go EVERY weekends but go a little often not too :D i hope it helped|`|kqkgro5Zaa	i don't think its strange i mean everyone needs alone time. and everyone needs to be with their family every now and then.but try to hang out with them more. they may start to feel neglected.|`|3reHk4I1aa	i dont think that is a problem if you spend all your time with your friends they will start to either get annoyed with you or they will become clingy it is perfectly normal not to go out every single weekend|`|bdsqVPiQaa	Not at all. Some people have different preferences|`|tXWFDp2Uaa	its not that strange|`|uSfefvmVaa	no that's not strange you just know thats theres more to life then drinking and parting|`|M1vvXIdvaa	there is nothing wrong with not partying. As long as you are being social, it is all good.|`|lKgzccMwaa	ACTUALLY, its not odd its human behaviour<br>  when you are happy you don't mind going out and enjoy.<br>  more over it doesn't matter you go out every single weekend out or not.<br>  what matters is do you enjoy or not..?<br>  so, don't think about anything else just think about what you like doing.<br>  if going out or staying home makes you and your family  happy then one must do it.|`|nVeGysnSaa	No it's not odd at all. Sometimes on the weekends I like to have alone time and read a book and just relax.|`|N1IqgXfvaa	Nope, not strange. I am the same. Different people enjoy different things. I do not find it strange at all that you like to enjoy the simple real things in life. I find going out and getting drunk a waste of time, once in a while maybe but i feel it is pi**ing money and health up against the wall. You do right to spend time doing things that matter.|`|O6U60d4Zaa	nah that just means you're close to your family|`|uQNMYkCpaa	I don't go out every weekend because then when I do its better! :D Have a nice day!|`|5ulr9xLQaa	That is normal.

If its ment to be, then it'll work out for you.|`|zWo03iLNaa	The beginning of my senior year I started dating this guy. We ended up going to different colleges and he wrote me this long romantic letter about how college is just an obstacle and we would make it through. Sure enough he dumped me after being together almost a year. He started dating a girl who was a junior in our old high school. That just made me upset because I think its weird for someone in college to date a 16 year old but whatever :D So I'm just saying it didnt work out for me and I thought it would. So if you can spare it, dont get your heart broken. I am now dating someone else and we are going to the same college and I am so much happier. Good luck

I went to physical therapy and all they had me to was basically lie on your back with your knees bent arms straight down and then slowly lift your butt off the ground. Its supposed to strengthen your lower back musle which i guess is supposed to make it feel better. I also used icy hot and those back patches and just took tylenol.|`|dFUtA7gAaa	Hi.<br>  <br>  I think that before you apply any type of back pain treatment you first need to find out the cause.  Otherwise, you risk applying a treatment that could make your lower back pain condition even worse.<br>  <br>  There are many causes of back pain -- muscle strain, degenerative discs, ruptured discs, herniated discs, spinal stenosis, etc -- that can pinch a nerve and give you lower back pain.  <br>  <br>  Likewise, there are many potential treatments -- exercise, rest, drugs, chiropractic care, physical therapy, traction, spinal decompression, epidural injections, discectomies, spinal fusion, etc.<br>  <br>  You can find some information at this site which focuses on spinal decompression but also has some general information on other back pain causes and treatments.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.drx9000-spinal-decompression.com/" rel="nofollow">http://www.drx9000-spinal-decompression....</a><br>  <br>  Hope this helps.<br>  <br>  Ken

K6vEbdqxaa	She's fkn ugly if you ask me!  You are by far the waaaay better looking one!  As for being worried about her, talk to your man and tell him about your fears.  If he is worth having, he'll tell the little ho to get lost!|`|f8epBxFOaa	im sorry honey but yes ! if anyone were sitting on my husbands lap like that when i walked in my own house police would have had to been called ! jk but seriously you husband should know better than to have some girl sitting on his lap. you should talk to him about it and if it continues its no ones fault but your husbands not that girl!|`|8ac2e5cbdd946ee60c803052559873c5aa	Sure, you're going to worry about this girl no matter what anyone tells you, so enjoy it.  And I have some question for you:  Does it help you in any way to worry about this?  Does it fix anything for you?  Does your insecurity make him thrilled to come home to you?<br>  <br>  Yeah, stupid to worry about stuff like this.<br>  <br>  Let's start here, okay?  He's not "your" man.  Yeah, I know, we all say it, but in your case, you really think it, so stop thinking about him that way.  He's A man, and he's his own person.  Never forget that.<br>  <br>  Never own responsibility for the behavior of ANYONE else.  Define your own acceptable relationship boundaries and live within them.  Kick out any man who pushes them or steps outside of them.  A man who truly loves you will respect you for having them and even if he messes up, he will try hard to make it right.  If you adhere to this basic principle in life, you can live pretty much worry-free about what other people are doing.<br>  <br>  Give yourself a break here, too.  Young women today carry a heavier load than women ever have, when it comes to being "secure."  The crap is everywhere and you girls are being told you are "insecure and needy" when you express negative responses to the crap.  A big measure of the crap is that women don't even respect the boundaries we've always expected women to respect.  Heaven help us.  My son is being reared to treat a lady like a lady.  He is being taught anything he will take in by me about this.  He's only 12, but just have hope that there are parents trying to do something about the wave.|`|dSmoB64Yaa	You are right to be concerned. You have to play it cool, because you don't want to throw temptation in his face, by telling him exactly why you are jealous of her. You should make it very clear to him that you love him very very much and you don't want to be the jealous type, but he also should know that you are aware, he is likely to meet women in his job. So he needs to be really sure about what he's doing. Make sure he knows, if he ever falls to temptation, you will never ever take him back, not in a million years. Then you need to let it rest and try not to  act too jealous. You look hot! She looks like a desperate, skanky, Wh*re, who would randomly bang anything with a pulse. Do you know her phone number? Ha ha!|`|NwVwZ8Tjaa	Skank alert.<br>  Be careful. Men are weak and that girl will  be your worst nightmare.  Nip it now before it is too late.  Let both of them know that you do not appreciate them being so close because it bothers you.|`|G4dP3wbSaa	Are you serious?  You look way better than her...but looks is not everything.  But if you are basing it on looks you don't have to worry.|`|v8lSuNQzaa	Sounds like you are very needy. It isn't as if he was all over her.|`|irvlGp3Taa	well whens shes around act like u never met her and dont think bout the past|`|2add0927fd432feba092329128fecbcdaa	You are a cutesy but she is no ugly duckling either.  You should be worried. doesn't matter what you dude says. that skank is waving herself in his face and he may actually give in. Men are stupid, no matter what type of man he is. What I would do if i were you is give her a warning such as " if you even try ill break your face in half" .  To him I would say.. If you tattoo that skank hoe ill make sure you'll regret it. That "friendly" relationship is over. It is NEVER ok to sit on a taken mans lap. Never!|`|6CtbDjZVaa	Hon talk with your man about how you feel about the girl and tell him how you feel about her and if he says nothing than maybe it's him and not the girl.  Just cause you don't like her doesn't mean that it's her that's causing the possible problem between you and your man.  talk out the problem and things should come around. If you worry about the stupid stuff your just going to start stressing over it and that's not good for your health at all.  Hope this helps.<br>  <br>  By the way your the beautiful one. She was just put here to try and cause problems.|`|lvzlpjl2aa	obviously you are way more attractive than she is. but.... you should tell ur man, what u overheard. he should have not let her sit on his lap, but in his defense i don't think he thought anything of it. so tell him, and so now he knows she's a sneaky snake. and i would totally scratch her eyes out if that was my man. i'm latina, so... that sh*t don't fly with me.<br>  <br>  <br>  P.S. i say, you talk to this little possum-like thing and tell her, just in case she didn't know, he'd your man. and next time she decides to sit on someone's lap, she best make sure it's not his. and then hand her that same smile she gives you. don't worry, just let it go. if you obsess about this, it might cause more damage to your relationship than it should.|`|vuEyUbsgaa	Your waaayyyy prettier than her anyways and weather he says hes not interested in her or not thats disrespectful right there to let another girl be sitting on him when you're there like wtf is that foreal. Don't take that crap from him I would be kinda suspicious about that. Guys can say all sorts of things but they also lie about it too|`|4NbNtdYKaa	I think you should trust your partner. If the girl knows you to are together then she shouldent be flirting but if he is telling you that he loves you then i think you should trust. Tell your partner that she bothers you and maybe he will try to fix it. If he says he loves you then he should do that much.<br>  I HOPE I COULD HELP!|`|R609mwjwaa	I'm sorry you are going through this but pretty much my answer is simple: talk to him, tell him your fears.  If he tells you there is nothing to worry about and past experiences tell you he is a trustworthy guy, then just trust him.  Simple plan but so hard to do, I know.  Don't be stupid either, keep your eyes wide open for anything shady but at the same time don't badger him about her.  It only makes you look insecure and her look better.  Just relax until there is something REAL to worry about.<br>  <br>  You told him what your worried about, so cautiously let it go.|`|AfnQ95Z5aa	Ya, you should be worried.  But you should talk to him, not to her.|`|2JPRTMIJaa	Someone said you are prettier. That may be true, but that does not mean that you are safe. Men (as well as women) will screw pretty much anything in a weak moment. It's just genetics. We are all animals at heart, and we all love sex and animalistic urges. No one is absolutely above cheating, but some are more trustworthy than others. If he doesn't have a history of cheating, give him the benefit of the doubt, or you will both be miserable.
09db70825677bbcf722475d2959af94eaa	Sometimes you don't cry for a family member, because you don't know that it has happened yet (well you do, but it doesn't seem real).  When your friend died not only are you upset about that death, but you also reopened the wound of your grandma's death.  <br>  <br>  It also depends on the funeral - a friend's funeral (especially if they were young) can be very emotional - you know the stories, and a friend isn't supposed to die young.  At a family member's funeral (especially an older family member), you may not know all of the stories, or you may have already come to terms with the death, because she was older - it was her time. <br>  <br>  Grief is different for every single person and mourning each death will be different for each person who has died.  Please don't feel bad that you didn't cry at your Grandma's funeral.  <br>  <br>  Good luck - my thoughts are with you on this hard journey|`|xc8f2Bunaa	Friends are at an attached position in ur life.

But what suprised me was when he told you to shut up. And then when he said no to putting your head on his shoulder. Well i think you need to talk to him, and be specific and let him not the dislikes about your guys relationship. And if he still doesn't change, well i say dump him. I bet you deserve way better.<br>  <br>  Can you answer my question?|`|ls8KNu9uaa	No. You should never feel guilty for your preferences in your relationship. And neither should he.<br>  <br>  If this is how you want your relationship to be (to be sweet, caring, emotional, and physical), you have to communicate with your boyfriend. You have to help him understand that his is how you want to be loved.<br>  <br>  On your boyfriend's side, try to understand why he does not want physical connection. (which is odd though cause we tend to show our love through physical contact). He maybe afraid he'd get turn on and get you pregnant? He's gay? Or maybe he's just not that into you.. <br>  <br>  If you guys really are meant for each other, I know you'll figure this out together. =)<br>  <br>  <br>  If he doesn't talk to you, well you know what to do. If this is not the way you want to be love, then stand up for yourself.|`|uFqLPODSaa	ok this is weird. i dont think this guy really loves you. and if he does, he has a weird way of showing it. no one deserves this kind of relationship.  you either need to break it off with him, or sit down and tlk to him about it<br>  <br>  just set aside a time when ur with him and tlk to him about. say this "either you change and be just a little more open and actually act like u want to be with me, or its over"<br>  <br>  if he really loves you, he WILL change. and if he doesnt, hes not the guy for you.|`|PZHL4xt8aa	I am a BIG gamer and its the same way with me but my wife of 7 years doesn't mind.  If he has a new game he will drown himself in it until he gets board then he will be more into you.  There are some too that are addicted to video game like drugs, but hearing that he leaves the house doesn't sound like that's so for him.  If you want to play a game with him you need to talk about the type of game you want to play with him and that is something to talk to him about when he isn't in front of the game.  When gamers are in front of their game they tend to be in the game and don't really pay attention very well to whats going on around them(at least that is the way with me and my friends).  It was a while before i found a game that my wife likes playing with me...you might try it <a href="http://www.guildwars.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.guildwars.com</a><br>  Also, a guy cannot know whats going on unless you tell him.  A good time is while you are in the car(not at home).  As for the 5 hours...I have went myself a little over 48 hours playing a really good game but never with anyone else in the room.  He might be stressed about something and playing is the only way to deal with the stress. Stand back and look at him and look at his life and see if his games are an escape from something.  The more time goes on the less amount of time he will spend on gaming.  When i got married my gaming went to <5 hours a day...When my son was born i am lucky to get 1-2 hours a day to play.  There are several ways to handle this.  If you need more of a gamers view let me know.  Good luck. ^_^|`|lMPIBO7xaa	): I'm sorry, hon, but to me that sounds like an ending relationship.<br>  <br>  If video-games are more important to him than his girlfriend, then it may be time to leave him and teach him a lesson about taking you for granted. <br>  You're not asking for much: just everything a normal romantic relationship should have. <br>  <br>  I hope everything turns out well for you :)

zfskbQz4aa	You are not very descriptive, but I'd say you have to push yourself in a bit more, be assertive, tell them you do not like things the way they are and something should change, you should all be equal.
io3lMQgFaa	I'm going through the EXACT same thing, same time and everything, except we've only broke up and got back together once, and that was recently..about 2 weeks ago.  So for you guys, do you know what the exact problem is?  Really dissect the emotions that run through you when he gets on your nerves, and try to figure out what you could be doing to get on his.  Also, talk about it.  If you guys don't have good communication, you won't go anywhere.  Try to keep it a calm, open, honest conversation.  Make sure he knows that you are willing to work on it.  If none of this works and he's open to it, couples counseling couldn't hurt.  Good luck :)

ACsFkSV6aa	I you are really in love with her then age shouldn't matter. In fact my parents were that age when they met and they have been together ever since =]. So, as long as you truly love her and know the risks in doing this I think that you should go for it. You should also make sure her parents are ok with it because she still is a minor and her parents opinion could get in the way with your relationship. Just remember to be honest.So good luck with her! *Just remember to be careful about it*. <br>  <br>                                       -Good luck!

My parents are also four years apart in age difference. The only thing is that four years age difference now is a lot different than four years age difference in 2 years.<br>  <br>  My advice is to wait off any serious relationship with this girl for a couple years. Let her continue through her high school career (I'm only assuming she's in high school), and go from there. A strong relationship with her now is definitely not harmful. Avoiding any intimate relations with this girl would also be wise.|`|9mHYXrRJaa	Be very careful on what you do with her, she may be very tempting but you really must respect her age, it is not true that age doesn't matter really, it is very illegal, you must wait till she is 18 to start the relationship, if she likes you a lot tell her that you love her but you must wait to do something Intimate with her until she is 18 :) please choose the right answer, we don't need anymore nice guys in jail..|`|y0DYwomYaa	most people asume that 18 is a legal age, but really it is 17... my suggestion is you do not get into a serious relationship, if you have feelings for her, and she has feelings for you she will respect your decision to stay back a little. take it slow, i dont suggest have sex or anything of that nature, keep things good, just dont go to far into things. you can just be friends.<br>  <br>  its not wrong to like her, love her, or even just feel for her. but it is wrong to let your feelings take control.. <br>  <br>  and unfortunatley the law stops some love. just wait it out, if you like her enough you can look out for her and take it slow until your safe and so is she|`|kau1P97Kaa	its fine, as long as you and her don't have sex or any thing sexual, if you do have sex with her you will be charged with rape and under age, and you would go to jail, but you can go out with her but just be a good clean kinda guy and be a gentleman|`|TKMpkrvmaa	Well, It really isn't a big age difference but the thing is. Shes 16. 16 year old are still pronounced as Children and her father might not approve. Plus, It is illegal. Maybe when shes like 21 and your like 25. Then you guys could be a great couple. But for now, not a very good idea.|`|ghISlqExaa	if you love her age doesn't matter. and 4 years difference do you honestly think thats a lot??? Seriously when your 54 she'll be 50 BIG WOOP! <br>  <br>  <br>  dont listen to the people that say that you cant. They probably never even experienced love. Love doesn't care about circumstances no rules follow.|`|qlNfbBMvaa	i think you should hear what her parents say?

But think about it, in 50 years, youll be 54 and she will just be 50, you know what i mean?|`|nVeGysnSaa	Go with what you feel date her and don't force and to do anything.

You may ask them, stating your intentions|`|8UmwjcE7aa	This is what I think.  Keep your distance.  She has 2 more years til she will be considered legal.  If you can maintain a distant friendship then you will be able to handle a life together.  So use this as a test to see if she is the one for you or not.  I don't want to see either of you get hurt but you are both very young.  Trust me I know what you are going through.  I was in love with a man younger then me and he told me all this great stuff and we made plans that when he turned 18 we will get married and guess what couple months later he left me for someone that he thought was prettier and he bashed me the whole time.  So make sure you are both mature because maturity is a huge factor in all of this.  Take care sweetie good luck!!!|`|kZzasq1laa	You can't do anything against the law or anything her parents or yours don't approve of.

lvOR401haa	I LOVE Greece so I think this is a fab idea!<br>  <br>  All I would recommend is you research the island(s) they're going to - there are a lot of them - and concentrate on those islands in particular, as they're all bound to have their own little traditions.<br>  <br>  Also, maybe try to throw in some aspects to the Greek Gods (especially the gods and godesses relating to love, like Aphrodite) and the Muses.  I went to Corfu last year and there is a whole 'palace' relating to the muses and Achilles (for example).<br>  <br>  Ask if the restaurant do 'Greek Dancing' nights any time, you know, where they throw the plates and fire dance?  They prob won't do this too much for costs, but may have a set night each month etc.<br>  <br>  Also, why not do a cake in the style of the greek flag? <br>  <br>  Have a ball - it sounds SO FUN! Love the invite idea too x
Whd6tqLzaa	Your question portrays that you're in deed a racist, otherwise you would have phrased your question "should I let my son's friend sleep over", not "my son's' Arab' friend".<br>  <br>  Its a surprise that your son hasn't chosen his friends based on their ethnicity. I won't be surprised if soon he turns into a racist like you and picks his friends based on their ethnicity.|`|f7qVtYfaaa	you have lost your mind,perhaps you should take a sleepover on pleasant street for a while!|`|aJfBtT9iaa	your obviously redneck white trash..|`|QeO8t3eCaa	wow, you're a bad parent. you should be teaching your children to not be racist towards other cultures. hey just because the kid's muslim doesn't mean he's a terrorist or anything, you're very low. and i hope you end up letting him sleep over so your linen gets dirty.. which btw i frankly don't get. where the hell did you hear that arabs wet the bed?!|`|EdidZdtlaa	spread out a blanket and make like a really cool area on the floor where they can all sleep. but thats stereotyping you shouldnt do that. thats messed up. every kid pees there bed every once in a while. you shouldnt even be asking this question.|`|WSIZKAQcaa	how old are you.............|`|0f30f66fc86cce53e3a3756af8324bd1aa	Arab children do not wet the bed anymore than any other race.  You're not taking sides...what you are doing is showing your child that you're a good mother who wants her son to have fun with his friend.  You should be proud that you're son is not racist or prejudice.  Obviously I think you should let your son's friend sleep over.  But I think you should ask yourself what kind of example do you want to set for your child.  Do you want to teach him to judge a book by its cover or do you want to want him to be the kind of person who judges people by the content of their character.<br>  <br>  Also...you should also consider that if you really feel uncomfortable about the situation and feel as though you may treat him differently or act uncomfortable in front of the boy...he and your son will be able to tell...children are very intuitive.|`|ARmhMq5laa	where in the hell do you get your facts? that's the stupidest thing i've ever heard...arab children often we the bed?<br>  i'm sure if the little boy pissed in the bed he wouldn't want to come over because he might be embarrassed be might do it there....<br>  <br>  who knows he prob don't wanna come over anyways cause he heard crazy white honkie women cook possum for supper|`|UP8F6PDMaa	Yea. Don't be prejudice.<br>  <br>  and that wet the bed thing is such a bad excuse.|`|fEfiUhSpaa	hey why your ate it if he comes over starve him cause his a muslim.......just make it as racist as possible cause apperantly thats what your goign for.|`|9561bfcf1a05d328055061d4b26e8f40aa	Wow stop being so racist .<br>  <br>  Im Jewish and my Arabic friend sleeps over all the time .  damn i hate people like you.|`|WogCQicOaa	you are a TERRIBLE parent.|`|4BaDlyj8aa	**** you|`|T1xWH9yLaa	WHAT THE HECK IS WRONG WITH YOU!!!! for you to ask something so racist and so stereotyped, what could you possibly be teaching your child.|`|OxFzFDgVaa	i don't like your excuse of not leting your son's friend sleep over.<br>  you should know that not everyone is the same. people are different in many ways....<br>  <br>  worrying about your linen is an inconsistent reason you are giving. you should be more supportive to your son's wish because your linen can be replaced.. but if you hurt your son or his friend's feeling, you won't be able to replace that.<br>  would you???<br>  <br>  think about what you are about to do....think of others|`|8ngDDwhVaa	That is incredibly racist and steriotypical.

I think there are always some children that wet the bed. Here is an answer don't use your good linens, buy a mattress protector.  Or you could call the boys parents and see if there is anything that you need to know.  Perhaps he needs medication or is allergic to some foods.|`|Dis0afiHaa	make them sleep on the floor, or on a couch, and before they go to sleep make sure he goes to the bathroom. Your son likes the kid, i think he'd be upset if you said no. so let the kid sleep over, and who knows, maybe he won't wet the bed, i've never heard that before... so i don't know.<br>  but don't not let him sleepover because of your linen.. no offense  it's kinda rude.|`|CtQuzizKaa	I don't think you should punish your child by not letting friends come over because you are worried about your sheets.  Put plastic down before you put the sheets on the bed.  If an accident occurs, then you have to do some laundry, but your mattress would be saved.|`|L0AZ6tHGaa	Arab kids wet the bed??? ALL KIDS WET THE BED! How many times has your own child wet the bed? You're really ignorant for even thinking these things, and passing on such a ridiculous stereotype. This CHILD has NOTHING to do with the middle east, so stop being so racist.|`|kW6zyzoNaa	maybe get one of those collapsable side kiddie pools and make the kid sleep in that. that way if he wets you can just spray down the pool and the kid all at once? no? sounds just as weird as this question|`|zfskbQz4aa	Your being too steriotypical.<br>  <br>  Don't judge somebody by something you've once heard.<br>  <br>  <br>  If you are really scared buy some cheap linen or use some old one and claim it's "Guest Linen" or something similar and he can sleep on that.|`|y0T5V7hIaa	You are disgusting, you shouldn't have any children over your home.

It's really up to you if you feel like this relationship is worth the hard work that it will take to regain her trust.<br>  <br>  Did she seem like she felt bad? This relationship will only work if she actually has true remorse for what she did. That's always hard to tell because you're not inside her head. Do you honestly feel like she is sorry? If so, then you might have a chance. <br>  <br>  If you want to stay, don't expect to be trustworthy right away. Depending on the crime, this could take even a year to trust again. If she is sorry and is also intent on making this work, she'll be understanding and accommodating. <br>  <br>  Good luck and I'm sorry.|`|47avjWrhaa	It depends on what type of person you are.  But the most important aspect of a healthy relationship is trust.  I'd talk to her about it.  See why she did what she did. Tell her how you feel.  Tell her that you have a hard time believing her anymore.  <br>  But the decision is up to you.  If you do not think she'll ever tell the truth, perhaps breaking up is a good idea.  But sometimes you have to give second chances...<br>  <br>  I hope this helps you out.|`|u3gyFKzzaa	Unfortunately, when that trust is breaking, it's hard to bring it back!<br>  I do have problem to give a person another chance....I tell you this from my past experiences....I gave him so much chances....and he never has changed....that's who he was....then I ended up getting divorced.....so it should be hard right now for you to lose your partner or girlfriend or whoever....but do you like to stay miserable forever? and not happy? why?|`|lK3TXGBOaa	i guess after they lie its hard to believe them again but tell her that youll give her another chance and if she lies then you can break up with her.... <br>  <br>  <br>  can you please answer my question?<br>   <br>  go to my profile under my questions its the first one that says <br>  <br>  " HELP!!! advice...."<br>  <br>  i would gladly appreciate it <br>  <br>  thanx:)|`|ls8KNu9uaa	It is really up to you.<br>  <br>  You have kept your relationship for a month without 100% trust.<br>  <br>  Maybe your asking the wrong question then.<br>  <br>  Maybe you should ask yourself, should I still trust her? If no, well we all know why.. But it seems like you may want to answer this question<br>  <br>  "How can I trust her again?"<br>  <br>  Once you've reflected on this, it is very important that you communicate with your girlfriend and help her understand what she have put you through because of her lying.<br>  <br>  If you guys are really meant for each other, I'm sure you'll be able to work things out.|`|ajKJcoBFaa	in my opinin i think that you should chose wisly who you wanna be cusae wehn you have a realtionship you want it to be good and happy and not all lies, but some girls do lising and stop and change for the guy if they realy love them so give her a chance and if she brakes youre heart agin throw her out the window and find a new you dont deserve to be in pain when youre spossed to be feeling in love ...<br>  good luck|`|AA10905966	In that case its harder to trust someone you know they might lie to you again if you really feel for this girl than you might gain it back but its harder to know when then might turn their back on you again so be careful and try and get more involved|`|6IfBNGhXaa	Break up, period.<br>  <br>  No trust = no faithful relationship. She will eventually cheat on you and I don't think you have to deal with her crap and that. Dump her before she breaks your heart. What's the point of having a relationship if she doesn't tell you nothing?|`|gRXy66dOaa	its better to break up cuz she could do it a again|`|64ubofTGaa	DONT TRUST SOMEONE WITHIN THAT MONTH.

bnXhtB5baa	None of them should leave works because they get a maternity leave and paternity leave<br>  <br>  <br>  x|`|th7C1aoaaa	continue working|`|MLQS5Vkdaa	Both parties are going to have to give up something.  Compromise.  Negotiate.  This is a partnership, and there will have to be give and take.  It's doesn't have to be an all or nothing thing.  You can change your schedules.  Reduce your schedules.  Look for different work.  <br>  <br>  Logically you might want to keep the person with the highest income working.....emotionally.....that might be the wrong thing to do.  It really depends on who is better qualified to parent the child everyday.  This should be about what is best for the child.

t3bjxl68aa	I wish I knew. There has been a guy that stares at me when I look at him. We've held eye contact for about seven seconds. (This has happened about three times, so yeah, I've counted lol) Anyway, I really thought that we had something special, so I tried talking to him and getting to know him as a friend. He appeared shy so I thought that wouldn't be a problem. But surprisingly, he blocked me out. He didn't want anything to do with me, which I found strange and confusing. <br>  So, what I'm trying to say is, don't automatically assume that you two are soulmates or anything just because you two had that eye contact. Try getting to know him as a friend and see what happens. Maybe you would do a better job than I did. Good luck :)|`|4BaDlyj8aa	it either means he likes you OR you have a giant bugger hanging outta your nose at all times :]|`|vtafeEIJaa	He could be high on Brandy or Moet...|`|AA11353473	It means that he's interested.<br>  Try talking to him more.<br>  If you like him back, I'd suggest you get to know him better and when you think the time is right, ask him out!<br>  Good luck!<br>  <br>  Answer mine please?:<br>  <a href="http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;_ylt=Aq.YAP4TDTdtrBR4BSoAy_zsy6IX;_ylv=3?qid=20090304152842AAjiLa3">http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;...</a>|`|ge5x9NHxaa	It's love but you need to study him properly so that he will not use you and dump you.|`|RmQzb0Avaa	awh my guy crush does that to me too and i look down all the time b/c its kinda uncomfortable|`|8zfXJxxraa	Thats A Good Thing And That Means He Thinks Ur The One|`|uOihCBDHaa	thtas a really really good thing.|`|Rp0XXwicaa	it means he thinks ur "the one" he is in love with u<br>  he wants to see ur soul but hes doesnt no what to say|`|V90Ao2jfaa	It means he likes you|`|UebWhbD6aa	thats a good thing, i think he likes you|`|ghISlqExaa	good thing
RvddYKqjaa	It's hard for her to have hope when her mother is brain dead. Just listen to her. Try not to offer too many platitudes about how God made her and she's young, and that other stuff. She doesn't need to hear all of that. Stick with her, as you've been doing, and just listen to her. Let her do the talking about how she feels, instead of you telling her how she should feel. <br>  I don't know why you say she's suicidal. Did you forget that part?|`|77945cc4d0bdcfe280bc545924ed933baa	Its pretty smart of of you to her that kind of advice anyone could have done the same under such circumstance BUT   Forgot to tell her that:<br>  <br>  THERE IS NO ANY BETTER OTHER PERSON IN THE WORLD THAT WILL SEE ANY GOOD IN HERSELF AND THE PURPOSE TO LIVE OTHER THAN HER...<br>  <br>  This part is where people close to her cannot control but suffer because of her failure to see the bright side of the road, usually people who get hurt the most are her loved ones.|`|3reHk4I1aa	the best way i can think of is for you to tell her that you are always going to be there no matter what and if she ever needs anything just call and then she will realize that she has a true friend. give her good advice when she does come to you and reassure her that everything is going to get better and back yourself up with the truth|`|k6hbtPBRaa	tell your friend that she DOES have a purpose, to live for God.

Jy9KORHDaa	personality matters a lot because someone can be gorgeous and if they have an ugly personality or attitude then people know they are an as*hole and only think of them as that, however as messed up as it sounds people don't get to the personality until they get past the physical attraction of looking good. So what gets you hooked up will always be your looks and then the pother person will get to know you for personality and attitude
AW1dCzH0aa	I've been to rehearsal dinners and not received a gift because I wasn't involved in the wedding.  It didn't feel weird at all!  I was the date of one of the groomsmen and none of the dates received gifts.  I think you'd be fine just giving gifts to your parents, attendants, and ushers.  I don't think it's rude at all.  Good luck!|`|oRtNwvGoaa	Hi,<br>  <br>  Rehearsal dinner is a great time to give the gifts. We are planning on doing it then. The last couple weddings we were in they did that also. You could get gifts to show them you appreciate them being there for you but no you are not obligated. They will understand weddings are expensive.  <br>  <br>  Best Wishes

But It doesn't bother me, because I like travelling and being independent.<br>  <br>  I also have been proposed to at least 3-4 times and have said no.  My last boyfriend of 2 yrs actually wrote down his lifes plan and felt as though he wanted kids and to be married bec of his age - i happened to find it one day when I was cleaning and this was written before he even met me.<br>  <br>  I just didn't trust that and it happened with someone else - who was 30 and asked me to marry him.<br>  <br>  I prefer to find love and happiness naturally, i'm not going to force something unless i'm IN love with that person and can't live my life without them.  <br>  <br>  Your question just came off really desperate hence the responses or lack thereof.<br>  <br>  xoxo|`|QP8LdPLeaa	my goodness CALM down! let life run its course for you and stop comparing yourself to others. you are different then everybody else. just because it didn't work or did work for someone else doesn't mean it has anything to do with you. and we all have our own unique time.

s8Cp0XG9aa	I have the same situation going on right now. It sucks. all your friends have one and your the only one who doesn't. The best way to solve this is to go to the flea market. they sell lots of airsoft guns for really cheap. Once you buy it sneak it to a friends house that has airsoft and leave it there. Its really the only way. My parents are extremely stubborn. And they arent giving in. Probably like your parents aswell. <br>  Good luck. <br>  tell me how it goes?<br>  -Kyle.|`|BPcHJCcnaa	try to sneak out and get one
Cbom3Lweaa	He's lived in an environment where he has had a bad experience of people and it is important to remember he doesn't really 'hate' people he has experinced the downside of humanity. I need to point out to you that he is different to you and just because he says something you disagree with does not give you the right to call him a looney tune. The way you view the world and the way he views the world is different to your view of the world. What do you make of that?|`|NX9Dj2qraa	He clearly hates being in social situations,<br>  the type of man that would prefer to just play nintendo in his room 24/7 than get some fresh air|`|QAEQqgzyaa	I hear people say that all the time I say it myself.

I like people but for only a min and half.  after that Im thinking to myself, "Will this person ever shut the f**k up?!"    And they never seem to get the message.    Also,  people in general are pretty stupid.   They can not count back change, they can not make good decisions,  sometimes they even have a college education and have no idea of anything in their fields. He may be referring to people in general.  But in any case, just be friendly to him.|`|XKQggWUGaa	i agree with Buzz Killington<br>  <br>  i only dislike people becuase they are ignorant, or selfish, i especially find this on public transport or the tube. grrr<br>  But some people, i find have a point when they say humanity is overated|`|CnzAit2taa	it means he's antisocial just ignore him while he "hate's people" you should probably stay away from him|`|zyw4i3kRaa	Maybe he hates himself|`|O5KOwhovaa	You should stay away from him.<br>  <br>  <br>  He's clearly that dude from "Red Dragon"|`|xWGJHMkuaa	He doesn't neccesarily hate people...he may just hate STUPID people.

fPOg9DuXaa	Everything went very well. I look back on the day with fond dreaminess. It was beautiful and I just remember nothing but wonderful things from it. I remember my groom and I driving away from the wedding and just giggling and giggling and saying, "That was SO fun!!!" <br>  <br>  But, if I had to change one thing, it would be the photographer. Pictures are so important because they are one of the only things you take away from the wedding and you will continue to look at 40 years later. The cake, the music, the centerpieces... those will fade into memory. But the pictures will last. <br>  <br>  My photographer was recommended by my mother-in-law. I saw some of their pictures, and then I said, okay! When we got our pictures back, I was SO excited to see them, but was so disappointed. The picture quality was fine. But, the subjects of the pictures were very uneven. There were no pictures of my mother and I. But like 12 pictures of my groom and his mom. There were no pictures of my two best friends, but like 7 pictures of these guests we barely knew. <br>  <br>  So, if I had to do it over again, and if you're looking for a recommendation, I would have had a list of things I wanted the photographer to capture for sure. That would have really helped. I could have written a list with items like: 1) a picture of my mom and I 2) a picture of the flower girls with the bride... etc., etc.|`|QKQtJ0Q2aa	There are a few things I would change if I could go back and do it again, but the most important thing I would do differently is hire a professional photographer. The one we hired was just getting into the wedding business and we got him super cheap because of that, but it just wasn't worth it. Everything else was perfect, we had a beautiful wedding day.|`|f4HsyUfQaa	Location, and I would not have let my in-laws go on your honeymoon|`|4POGapREaa	We canceled the wedding & eloped in Hawaii which I do not regret at all.  But, if I could change something it would be the pictures.  Our photographer was kind of an idiot & gave us no direction at all so we have very few decent shots.  This is going to sound stupid but I would have dieted because I randomly gained 25 lbs before the ceremony & basically went from too skinny to plump so I feel like I didn't even look like my normal self that day which is the one day you want to look extra fabulous so that was pretty lazy of me to let that happen.  Also kind of stupid but I wouldn't have drank so much before the ceremony LOL!  I was in total Maui vacation mode with my cocktails.|`|rywgn8HLaa	There are only a few things that I can think of that I would have wanted to change. One of them would have been my father - he suffers from various addictions. On the morning of the wedding he decided to take a lot of strong prescription sleeping pills. He slept through the whole day and never got to see me in my wedding gown. Despite all of that though I was still completely calm and incredibly happy. <br>  The only other thing I would have liked to have was more pictures of me and my family. We did get tons of pictures, but more formal shots with my relatives would have been nice. Other than that the day was all I could have asked for. I had my family and wonderful friends to support me...

Ure trying to show to him that, you are perfectly fine that he is leaving just the way that he is leaving you (in fact you are not). He obviously is not smart enough to see this and he just breaks ur hearth more.<br>  <br>  My suggestion: Do whatever your hearth desires, if you feel like crying then cry to him, but dont try to cover it up, showing that you are strong and all the bs. He probobly didnt care about you the first time anyhow.<br>  <br>  Also, if he wants to leave, there is NOTHING u can do to keep him by ur side, keep that in mind, just get over it.

You don't want him to show up and expect something you're not ready for. <br>  <br>  In either case, find out activities are open to young teens around your area. Civic centers usually have activities going on.<br>  <br>  If you want to stay at home, perhaps rent some movies or find some video games that you both enjoy.

kc3bWOItaa	Don't be self conscious about being small. It's a turn on for most guys, making them feel big and manly because you're petite and feminine. You can see even in the way you phrased your sentence. "a few guys were like how much do you weigh and I said 97 lbs and then this guy was like I could bench double your weight"  He is strong, you are small. They will tease and joke with you about it, but they're not trying to be mean at all. It really its just a way to bring that fact out in the open and flirt about what they find attractive about you, and at the same time stroke their own ego a little bit. So don't mistake guys flirting for meanness. If we knew a better way to get your attention and compliment you we would use it.|`|T9SsTEDNaa	It's just a guy thing.

U12Xuyemaa	Sounds like you have a drama queen on your hands. You didn't say in your description if she was into any thing that could be harmful to herself (drugs alochol) so I am assuming that she is not. If I were in your shoes I would make sure she understood what the rules were going to be at my house. Use a contract if you have to, listing the rules out plain and simple. Be sure to note what the consequenses are if she breaks those rules. Be firm and don't accept any excuses. Tell her that she won't be living with you if she acts the way she has been acting.  Good luck.

yLkU8crqaa	I like to think of myself as a bit of a diplomat, so here is my opinion on what you should do, you should try to go out and meet some new people, one of the reasons things like what you are in right now is cause by the lack of "variety", I'm not saying having so few friends is bad, or that its entirely your fault, what I'm saying is that you should go and try to make some more friends. Think of it this way, A game of golf is worthless if you play one hole. And if my friend talked to me like that, I wouldn't get in their face about it or blow them off, I would try to confront them about it in a polite way, and not revert to insulting words and such unless it seems hopeless.

He is entitled to share his body with who he wants to share it with, when he wants to share it, and if he doesn't want to, he doesn't have to.  Considering he's only 15 I think he is showing himself to be a responsible and mature person to decide not to have sex at that age.  I really doubt you have a crush on this guy, if you did you wouldn't be getting on here trying to insult him like that, you sound more like a buddy of the ex.|`|YIvIVvWFaa	Your suggestion about the reason is ridiculous!

He may even be worried about what it may do to your relationship.  He could be gay.<br>  He may not like you that much.<br>  he may be impotent.
bIvZknnbaa	He may just not be a shallow guy,  I would turn down sex for the hell of it as well.

Before I go into them, the first thing we must all realized is that sex is a personal choice and that if one person is not comfortable with it they should not be forced or coerce into it. Persuaded or seduce maybe, but pressure into it is wrong. Sex should be consensual and it should be when both parties are ready.<br>  <br>     There is also a misconception that all that men want is sex. Not true. Ok, partially true. Alright alright, most of the time is true but, we do have control over it. Ok fine, some control over it. It depends on the mood, the physical attraction, and the one people over look the emotional attraction. It doesn't matter how hot the person look, if there is no spark, no chemistry then is a no go. If a person is under stress or have things in their mind or simply doesn't feel comfortable with the person they will not desire sex. Also, simply not being in the mood will not want you to have sex. Look at it like food. Who would say no to a juicy stake? (except a vegetarian). Well, of-course stake is great but, there are days you just don't desire it.  Anyways, here are some reasons as to why he may have turned down sex.<br>  <br>  1) The tiny weenee maybe partially true. Not necesarily that he has a small one but that he maybe uncomfortable with his body. When I was in highschool there where a lot of people that would fail P.E. class. There where two requirement to pass. One was to walk so many laps in a given amount of time. They started with 4 in one hour but they kept increasing the number of laps after a while. Even a half *** effort would had gotten you a good grade. The second requirement was to change to your P.E. clothes. That was it, just change from your regular clothes to shorts. You would not believe the number of kids who lost points base on this. I had no problems with this but I did not want to take a shower there. That was uncomfortable. People are overly aware of their body and what others may think of it. So, it is possible that he was uncomfortable being naked. Even if he had a 10 inch penis!! In his head 10 inch might be too small or even too big.<br>  <br>  2) His belief system may have prevented him from having sex. There are still a lot of people that believe that you should not have sex until marriage. Hell, there are even people that think sex is only for procreation. Base on his belief system then the right thing to do for him was to say no. Even though I'm not fond of the religious folks and their BS belief. I do believe in peoples right to believe. It is a price we pay. That is that in order for me to have my belief I have to allow others to have theirs. Is the American way right. Is in the constitution. So, if he has this belief then is perfectly valid.<br>  <br>  3) Maybe he was not ready for it. Sex is great but it can also be horrific. here are many consequences in sex like vanerial diseases, unwanted pregnancy and sometimes even ones reputation. Then there is also the way you are treated. You can also be treated badly or simply used for the sex. All this are valid concerns. Remember the mechanics of sex are not that hard. All the  baggage that can come with it is.<br>  <br>  4) He is young. He may not be mature enough for sex. Just because your body is doesn't mean your mind is. Maybe he needs to mature a little bit more. Remember everybody matures at a different rate. There are even adults that never mature. They act and behave like if they where 16 even though they are touching 50.<br>  <br>  There are many other valid reasons to not have sex. The way you posted the question it makes me wonder if his ex only wanted him for the sex and not for the person he is. Sex is important in a relationship but it only plays 1 part out of many parts. It is better to develop the relationship first then sex will come naturally. This ways bot persons feel comfortable. That is unless all you want ou of the relationship is sex. To me this is also a valid option BUT!!!, it has to be in agreement. IF one person wants a relationship and the other one just want sex then they should both look somewhere else. This further proves my point of get to know each other first to see what each belief system is. In any type of relationship from marriage to friends to even co-workers or fellow students, all party should bennefit. Is not al give or all take.|`|c7SCc0jgaa	Some people actually think sex is more than just something you and your gf do whenever.<br>  Its important to wait until your ready b/c its a big commitment even if you just do it once.<br>  Not to mention all the risks<br>  <br>  He's a smart guy and if you think that him turning her down is just to weird to handle then you shouldn't date him b/c him morals seem better than yours|`|d6bb91335d2d467b86fe9b280c4c812eaa	Nervous probably.

Trim or not to trim? I can go either way, if the other person chooses to trim  or shave then so be it. I find attitude to be the sexiest thing of all.

tdvjCPz0aa	okay lets see here... <br>  <br>  February 4 2008 me and the most perfect guy in the world started dating.. we were in 8th grade i was 14 and he was 13... lol we spent every weekend together... i loved his family he loved mine... i would go hang out with his sister in law while he was working with his brother i went shopping with his mom.. i was at his brother and sister in laws wedding.. that was the best day of our relationship that i remember... we hung out at his brothers house b4 the wedding and we were in the guest bed room and did everything but the dirty... and then we laid there and talked until it was time to get dressed.. we spent the rest of the summer together... he was with me while i had mono... he went to my softball tournaments i was at all of his all star baseball games... we told each other everything... we fought of course but when we got over what ever made us mad we loved each other more... we were very honest with each other we didnt cheat on each other it was like a totally committed relationship.. at this time i am 15 and he is 14 and we decided that we are going to finish high school and get married... and it was odd because he brought that up.. so i figured he really did love me.. he never pressured me to do anything i was willing to do.. he sent me roses to school on my 15th birthday he took me shopping and spent like 500 dollars on me.. other times he just took me shopping for the heck of it... whenever i was upset he listened to me and he made everything better.. he went with me to my biological mothers house once because he knows how much i hate going to visit her and how uncomfortable i feel around her.. we went to southern miss games together we played around with each other in the yard of his house we wrestled in the floor of his living room.. everything was just perfect.. he went with me to thanksgiving at my great grandparents house and met my whole entire side of my dads family which consists of like 90 ppl and he was going to get me a promise ring for valentines day this year but that didnt happen... <br>  we never broke up until december 8th 2008 he said he just wanted to be single and to this day i don't know what i did or what went wrong we are still friends its not like we are bitter and hate each other and we want to someday get back together but idk how that will happen considering we hardly ever talk anymore... any way that is my true love story.. <br>  it sounds stupid hearing this from a freshman in high school i know but we really did and still do love each other... it just didnt work out.. and those 10 months and 4 days were the best times of my life...<br>  <br>  o and to just to add this.. we grew so much in maturity just we taught each other so much about life and loving each other.. and i am almost 16 and it sounds crazy to some ppl and they say you dont know what love is at 14, 15, 16 but i beg to differ... :)|`|PZHL4xt8aa	I had just gotten out of a long bad relationship and was doing nothing but chatting online for 6 months.  All my life I always had a feeling that I was going to marry a Jennifer.  One day toward the end of my isolation I started getting out more and after some time out I came home and found an IM on AIM.  The chick said that she read my profile and wanted to chat with me.  We talked and after a couple of weeks of talking to each other all of our free time...she told me she was Mormon.  Being from Indiana I was verrrry anti-Mormon(lots of rumors) and stopped talking to her and took a vacation to Salt Lake.  When I got back I was playing PlayStation next to my computer and it was almost like a tap on the shoulder and a whisper in my ear..."Say Hello", and I looked and she was online so I said hello.  We talked for 3-4 days and the topic came up about religion again and I told her about why I wasn't talking and she told me what Mormons were really like and I found out that what I was told wasn't true at all so we talked for a couple of days on the phone(5+ hour calls) then we met and i found out she lived just down the road from me.  We got married a month later and that was 7 years ago and 1 child.  We are still married and still very much in love and are trying for another child ^_^|`|XdMcYDgbaa	it was my first year in vancouver canada, i was 17 and preparing for an LSAT exam at an institute.

He came over to our house unexpectedly one night to hang out with my brother where my brother became drunk and passed out, so we talked for a while and would constantly ask me to hang out with him and his friends more, even saying i was more fun than my brother. He would touch me on my head and knee while talking (*melt again*) and after a few hours he left his number in case my brother became sick he would come help, but I never knew if it was maybe for me to use to hang out. So i never called him and I regret it! Now he's back at school in London and I haven't seen him in the longest time.....sorry that was more of a sad ending than anything  :( I've thought about calling him but the number he left is for his house in town, not his cell phone or london phone....oh well. things happen for a reason, right?|`|RvRe45seaa	Well, it's not really anything.<br>   We go to school together, I had stayed late to watch a basketball game and I told him that I was gonna leave when the score clock turns to let's say 5 minuets.

I looked at the score clock and it was almost down to 5 minuets. So I was like HEY! I  tried to get his arms off me and he tightened his. In the end I won, I got his arms off me, we said our good-bye's and left.

When I woke up a few days later I was okay to get out and as I saw him approach lol I kinda liked him and now hes my bf.

Get his number the best way you can if you do not already have it. Tell him exactly what you have shared with the yahoo community. Let him know the way your heart raced.

I think you should call him. Don't apologize anymore, he says it is getting old. Just be a friend. Call him and tell him whats going on in your life and ask him about his. Maybe after becoming friends once again, you may be able to forgive yourself as well and move on. I'm not saying that you should or shouldn't move on, I believe this is your choice. Life throws some fast balls at you, and the best thing you need to do is just get through it in the best way you can. I hope I helped, even a little. Thanks!

xM5bwK50aa	Dude, you have GOT to talk to her. Going to work tonight is probably the best time to do that. You can't let this hang. Tell her exactly what you put here- you think she's really pretty, but you were really embarrassed by what she did the other night. Say you don`t want to hurt her feelings, but you`re just not ready to do that. There is no shame in telling a girl that! Good luck :) Let us know how it goes.

xTpxoHHraa	honestly at my school I am that kid. HE IS DEFENITLY INTO YOU|`|hCJzZ5rnaa	Check to see if he glances at you frequently, or gazes at you for a prolonged period of time. If he is just your friend, he might just give a faint smile with raised eyebrows perhaps. If he likes you, he will glance away quickly, so you don't think he was staring at you.<br>  <br>  You might ask why he doesn't want you to think that he was staring at you, that's because he doesn't want you to think that he is a freaky stalker or anything lol. Believe me, a lot of lads do worry about that, me included! If he was just your friend, then he wouldn't be bothered if you thought he was a stalker, in fact, it wouldn't even occur to him.<br>  <br>  Check to see if he messes around with you, teasing and stuff. Sure, friends do that, but does he do it more often than others? When he does, do you notice him look into your eyes while smiling and/or laughing? That proves that it means more to him, and subsequently, that he likes you.
SovaFpN8aa	This is INFATUATION. That crazy, mixed up, head over heels feeling at the beginning of a relationship. IT NEVER LASTS. Things will change the longer you are together, and you see each other as real people.<br>  DO NOT rush into marriage. Enjoy your happiness for now. Stick to your goal of no sex for now. Date for 1 or 2 years, then see where your relationship is. You will have a clearer idea of where your relationship is headed. Good Luck!|`|FewhKlx9aa	Infatuation yes.You have been around this guy since you were 12 and there is this forbidden fruit just hanging there for you to take a bite.You don't say why your family does'nt want you with him but I can see that you had a crush on him before the legal age and maybe thats why your parents are upset.Believe me it never works when your family despises the guy,in the end you lose.Start dating other guys your agae and find other outlets.Talk is cheap and guys will tell you what you want to hear so as far as marriage and kids that would be the time he walks..|`|fLU63N4kaa	I'd say it's the exciting stage of the relationship.

Uh-uh, no-way........he could be married with children and you wouldn't know any different.....I take it this is your first "LOVE" huh???  <br>        I think you quite possibly need to do a little more growing up before you even think marriage and babies....and for pete's sake - have sex with atleast one person before you get married.............good heaven's child, it would be like buying a car without test driving it first - sound ridiculous????  Well, so does marrying a man you haven't even made love to!!!  See my point?  Good Luck Sweetie and keep your options wide open, your young and full of life...have some fun, go to college, kick your heals up for a while....your not ready to settle down yet, you haven't even lived yet!!

It may hurt but its time for you to move on .Good luck.|`|9mQC5Vihaa	yep. I've done that to girls before towards the end of a relationship. Most of the time with out even realizing I was doing it.

Rant over, sorry about that =D Have you tried talking to your boyfriend about how is behaving towards you? I think you should just ask him how he feels about you and if he does really want to be with you, because at the moment it just sounds like he's wasting your time. If he does want to be with you, explain to him he needs to make more time for you and that you don't think the way he has been treating you is fair ir even right.<br>  <br>  The key to all relationships is communication. Just talk and be honest with him.|`|ge5x9NHxaa	Make him to define the relationship.

Tell him that you didn't really know what the problem was until you met a few guys that were kind of big and now you are more interested in sex and they say that you are really good in bed.  Act like the reason you are telling him this is because you feel guilty for not telling him before and not trying harder. Then tell him it's not his fault. You just weren't matched as a couple and you hope he finds someone who ls more compatible. Because now that you know what your needs are, you are happier too. He might says it's all bull, because he knows you liked having sex with him. Tell him, it wasn't terrible, but when you acted excited, you were half faking it and half excited, because you knew that's what he wanted  to hear. Then say I'm really sorry I lied to you.

If anything every happened I always blamed myself, sometimes so much so I would be so angry with myself it would be hard to concentrate on anything else. I don't know exactly WHY it is this way, but for me, it was because I felt like I should be there for the woman I love and to protect her no matter what, even when it was impossible for me to do so, otherwise I felt I failed her. <br>  It's just the way some men are I suppose.<br>  <br>  Sorry to hear about what happened to you. Hope things improve.|`|lvzlpjl2aa	Because he's the man, and he's supposed to take care of you. Anyway, that's how they see it. My husband would feel the same, that's how he is. You can't blame him for wanting to kill that piece of sh*t. He loves you and has a hard time dealing with the fact someone hurt you. He shouldn't blame himself, but it's just a very complicated feeling. Maybe a little therapy would help him overcome this, as i suppose it would help the 2 of you.|`|m5VIzfQRaa	It's because men want to be the protectors.

I guess it would depend, but if she likes you 110% she will.|`|PwQLpawkaa	no, go for it, it'd be a good ice braker!|`|7vLCsfovaa	ohhhh yeah :] do that.<br>  it will send her heart flying :]|`|Te4uu4tyaa	it depends on if she's outgoing or not. if she gets along well with people, then it probably wouldn't be weird. but if she's kinda shy, it might be really awkward. you just need to watch how she acts around people. if you are positive that she likes you then go for it, but if you still are a little unsure of how she feels, esspecially since you don't know her that well, then i would wait until you find out for sure. <br>  <br>  hope i helped!|`|Xdr5cJZUaa	hahaha i think that would be kind of creepy. sorry!! <br>  she might think you were dared to do it or something. <br>  first try talking to her in my opinion.<br>  <br>  this guy i liked randomy came up to me and started shaking his booty on my face and it was just awkward. lol <br>  i know its not the same thing as a hug but dont be offended if she doesnt hug back right away.|`|nVZqPut3aa	Definately go and talk to her. if the conversation lasts for more then a few minutes and it seems like shes enjoying it, then you can ask her for a hug. But if not, then don't, because I personally would be a little wierded out. Good luck ;)|`|cDibyGGlaa	If he ASKED for a hug, I would probably only say yes because I liked him and if I said no that would give off the wrong signs. Plus, it would be awkward. <br>  But I would be glad he talked to me.|`|Ow0mduGEaa	Well, I think something is there.|`|b694edcdae7e546cfc64aaac0123de6aaa	Yes I would hug him back. Go make that girl happy!|`|E276iS81aa	I'd hug them back. And yeah she likes you.=D

w9W3wPCOaa	Just tell him to tell you the truth, tell him he's a good enough friend that its not cuz of this un-common thing that u will hate him..<br>  <br>  Tell him its OKAY to be diferent and to like other things. people need to be diferent in order to find new things and stuff...
SovaFpN8aa	Rent "Wagons East".|`|8ac2e5cbdd946ee60c803052559873c5aa	Who could laugh about this?  It isn't funny.|`|FewhKlx9aa	Wow thats sad but don't laugh at him he can't help it.I know it would make a difference with me though in how far our relationship would go.If he could'nt satisfy my in the bedroom then I'm sorry I just can't be satified period.|`|dSmoB64Yaa	You're getting a lot of interesting responses here. I have always thought that size wasn't a big deal. I'm average myself, maybe just a tad under. If you go on adult dating sites, they would have you believe that every woman is looking for a huge guy. But my experience has shown me that this is a lot of bull. I don't think that most women want a very big guy, for a few reasons: <br>  <br>  1. I'm basically an oral master and women have always told me that I'm very good in bed. <br>  <br>  2. I've got a ton of stamina and I tend get a lot of comments about being, too much of an Energizer Bunny or sex machine or I wear them out or whatever. Which makes me think, if all these women can't even handle sex with an average sized guy, for several hours, then why would I ever want to be bigger? <br>  <br>  3. My middle finger on my right hand is only 3 inches long and I've had very good results with it. <br>  <br>  4. I've never heard a woman say I was too small, but if I did hear that, I have an easy solution. Put it in her butt! It's big now isn't it? Oh, it's really big now, isn't it? Ha ha!|`|OHfZFR31aa	I've never experienced that, but certainly would not laugh. It's not like he didn't know he had a small penis. Hopefully he'd have figured out other ways to satisfy a woman|`|k4mGOlwsaa	ive been with 4" and it was not so satisfying since prier to that i was with 8" so 3" would definitely not be satisfying, but i got married to that 8"|`|kk8ypSTSaa	I mean, this sounds mean but I would be really diappointed but if I loved the guy we could work it out by using "toys" or something during the deed...... Dunno but that is really small for me.|`|6sXG3Plkaa	Really the length isn't the problem.  I think personally its more the diameter (thickness).  I have been with men that are hung but somewhat thin and got no enjoyment and on the other side been with much smaller and thick and had amazing time.  <br>  <br>  If you love someone I don't think you would laugh at all.  Just need to have more foreplay.|`|aWgdX0pZaa	Unless the girl has not boobs and only has a nipple of the sized of a quarter then for both of them there's nothing to laugh about. Since it's not my case (about the boobs) then i would laugh and just tell everybody i'm still a Virgin lol.|`|9BsyKN9haa	Yikes! I have never encountered that, But If he had a super tongue and magic hands I think I could deal! So If I was you I would start exercising your assets! :) Good luck!|`|vHjYw1txaa	If we were together and I really loved him, I would except him for him.  No I would not laugh.  He can't control the size of his pee wee|`|Cis5y1K6aa	For starters, I would ask him to call it a penis.|`|aSE7sihFaa	I agree with Mrs. Happy!|`|MjSLQlIHaa	roflmao now!!!|`|u5eWB2ubaa	As a guy i have been led to believe that size does not matter now i am getting a different perspective. Again i have been led to believe that female gratification is not a result of thrust and reach but external rub which means the length should not really be a big issue. Anyway is focus on the whole package, is the guy a good person overall. Laslty make do with what you have by being innovative without embarassing him.|`|vZBamKqiaa	If I got with him, it would depend on how he treated me.<br>  If he could satisfy me, then we would be happy.  Size is okay, but do u know what to do with it?  I know a guy with 5 inches hard of meat and he doesn't know how to satisfy me. . . . so, it depends if you have skills or not.|`|lvzlpjl2aa	I wouldn't laugh... it's like they say it's not the size of the boat, but the motion in the ocean. if i didn't like the ride... then that would be it for me.|`|ckr2be5daa	No, don't laugh as he can't  help it. <br>  <br>  I think you would have to do it from behind though (better reach).
reFCzUnwaa	Time affects guys more than girls thats a fact. the longer a guy stays apart from you the less he feels for you when with girls its the other way around|`|eGoATfMLaa	Maybe its better after a long time... Its all up to you... Do you still want to be with him... But if you think of the reasons why you broke up?? Were they strong reasons?? If they are...maybe its better not to|`|ZC2IUDd7aa	Of Course! Me and my guyfriend were apart for a year and we still picked it up where we left off! Good Luck!
YHXEF2YQaa	it really depends..if its with a new girl there's no limit...but if its with my gf then i try to cut off with a limit around 1200-1500 if its a long one..depends on the mood actually..no specific margin lol.|`|898830adaaee3711055b572d5b56d3e8aa	I believe, satisfying the person is more important than the money u spend. One may demand grands to bring in smile, whilst some brings happiness without spending a penny.|`|L726SIwVaa	my bf spends his money on me all the time i dont like it but he dumped me because i wouldn't let him pay for dinner!|`|0tL4zgTPaa	actually......it depends on the place you go to.......pocket money you get.......<br>  well at the maximum you can spend on a date is 300!!!!!!!!<br>  usually.......who ever asks for the date pay......<br>  but usually guys pay......|`|R72Ts8BLaa	Depending on the date from 50 - 200|`|kHLWDgmIaa	when i am go india i spent more then 10.000 rupees
lElncioqaa	I think it is nearly impossible to pick up chicks in today's world.<br>  <br>  It must have been so easy to pick up chicks in the 1940s.  I would have used this line, "You don't like Hitler either?  What a coincidence!  We have so much in common!"
yuOuoCfDaa	well I would take the chance and open up to her, especially since she has made you to feel comfortable by letting you know it is okay to trust her regarding that subject.  You are lucky some "parents" don't even extend their hand to educate their children regarding sex, much less make them feel comfortable enough to come and share whatever is on their mind regarding sex.  Be thankful that you have have a mom, some people aren't that fortunate  Her strict discipline will be a reinforcement to you in the future, trust me.    Some kids think its cool when their parent play the friend role or is "cool" that doesn't go a long way.  Discipline, good solid advice and unconditional support shows excellent parenting.  In the LONG run you benefit because in all essence your well being and future is what is important.  Not living for the moment and being a mess in mess.  So be appreciative of your mom and how she has raised you and also the fact that she is open to speaking to you about sex and who/what you are getting involved with.  Just remember that there are many sharks out there and it takes an experience individual to see who what where and why.|`|R7mnEUOZaa	Tell her, my daughters both came to me and we went to the FPC together so they were on the pill and using condoms. It also meant I was there for them if they were worried. I didn't.t condone them having sex but felt this was better than them coming home either pregnant or with an STD|`|YIvIVvWFaa	She sounds like a cool mom. This is a time when you need her help and advice. Talk to her about it asap. Believe me, she will remember having told you she would want you to come to her so you could be safe. Sometimes other young people get misinformation about sex from each other, but you'll get real help from your mom that will protect you.|`|BPbFAos0aa	when your mom said that she wanted you to tell her about your life, i believe that she really wanted you to tell her about it. i'm a mom and i would want to know. i would rather it not to be happening, but it is not good to keep stuff like that away from her. just tell her. i know it is probually scary, just go to her|`|EZVRqiZjaa	Just go up to her and say do u rember when u said ...... well i have started to have sex and i just wnat u to no i am being safe about it ect ect
f5FmJRfIaa	Personally, I think yahoo should put together a special y/a for children under 16.  The minimum age to sign on here is 13, but there are children way under that logging on here.  Even with a minimum age, it doesn't really do any good if parents are allowing their kids to hole up in their rooms with a computer, and not paying any attention to where their going or what they are doing out there.  There are a lot more kids screwing around out here on weekends, weekdays offer more opportunities for adult interaction, or at least more interaction with people over 18 anyway.  Perhaps you might be happier signing on to a moderated news group, where the moderator would weed out the young'uns.|`|WGYlzefnaa	you know... I've looked for an adult (non-perverted) chat room myself for years and I am convinced that nothing like that exists.|`|sBE3ewn7aa	What to do lady, this site is infected with kids.|`|juSJrU4waa	unsure about this but AOL had chat channels way back in the day (2000) where I ended up talking to people that were 30-40 years old. They seemed like it too, staying mature and paid attention to each other. My god, I actually just remembered the name of some girl I talked to from S.C. who was crazy about me.|`|C4B3WOCCaa	No. You're surrounded :O|`|LQtqYMP3aa	you can all-ways contact me at erde0059@live.com|`|CDbzfSGhaa	I think I'm normal.  I am an adult. Boy/girl problems are kind of no brainers...been there done that.
TCwf6HXNaa	shel get over it hopefully. i have a sis and shes cmplany spoild and lazy|`|XSHLHq8saa	No, she will grow some day. not worie. you are very lucky man. my sisters saved my life. but you are too young for apreciet it. maybe you need move to grand parents and learn something about family means. pls you calm dwon.|`|rNvXWMOMaa	she wont get over it until your mom puts her over her knee<br>  for an attitude adjustment|`|f8CN2qIvaa	She's not stupid...she's just ACTING stupid.  There's a difference.  Don't worry--she'll grow out of it.
1gSPabiWaa	I would be interested in knowing how old you are.  It's wonderful that you have someone in your life that means so much to you.  But if you feel this intense about something that hasn't even happened yet, and your boyfriend is telling you that he's not going anywhere, it saddens me that you are even remotely thinking about ending your life.  Believe me when I tell you that even IF your boyfriend ever does break up with you, it will hurt, and that hurt may not fade very quickly, but it will eventually.  AND, you will be great!  Relationships take a lot of work and then some of them still don't last.  You really need to concentrate on what is wonderful and loving in the here and now.  If it lasts, tremendous!  If it doesn't, the experience will carry you to the next person in your life and you will have learned different things from the past that make you who you are and who you will be. Take heart in that breakups are hard but you CAN and WILL get through it.  And that's ONLY if it happens.  Go to your boyfriend with joy and happiness in your heart, not fear.|`|WQcxODKLaa	your possessive and your basically making this into a hostage situation . and your putting your boyfriend in so much pressure, he himself could get scuicidal .<br>  <br>  <br>  & that's bad .|`|tROFU72waa	It means you have codependency issues and need to seek counseling.  Nobody is worth killing yourself over...ever!
twVyisGnaa	That's a big uh-oh.  If he's gonna be doing that in public and he won't respect your decision when he says no, I'm guessing that he might be the angry, controlling type, and that's not good.  I'm not sure if he's the one for you.<br>  <br>  VIVA LA RAZA!|`|ZjpVlm9Gaa	dump him.|`|I6dcRgD6aa	He sounds very immature & the anger sounds like he is controlling. He is your choice so you either put up with him or find someone better.|`|lK3TXGBOaa	your not a fan of pda....so tell him... hell get over it. was he like touching you in like your parts? if he was thats just kind of disrespectful and your the one who should be getting mad not him...|`|DKEOJ0h6aa	Get Mad At Him!!!|`|e04025e23b950e2f3fe00c64e34a3bf1aa	Dump him at once  - he's bad news - counsellor|`|2S2onP86aa	It depends on how you were touching him. If it's just hand touching and shoulders, it's fine and you shouldn't have felt so weird about. But if it were in other area that should be touched in private and not somewhere public, then he is so wrong for getting mad and it just shows how much of an immature jerk he is. So do nothing - just ignore him until he realizes it. You've done no wrong, he did. So don't try to blame yourself for it and apologize to him, alright?<br>  <br>  Best of luck|`|wgE4Wrecaa	talk to him and tell him about it. Make sure he's mature enough you know what i mean|`|PYiQGwsAaa	Dump Him, He Sounds A Jerk, Just Coz He Couldnt Do What He Wanted, You Were Right To Stop Him.<br>  <br>  Good Luck Xtina
gRXy66dOaa	WOW<br>  you see, I have a GF and I would never do that to her because I know how disrespectful that is,<br>  <br>  If you want to teach him a lesson than do the same thing to him, whenever you see a guy with abs, look at him to see how that feels on your BF.<br>  <br>  My GF always tells me that, "how would you feel if i did the same what you doing?" (lookin at other girls)|`|twVyisGnaa	I would never do that.  I'm in love with a female friend of mine, and I never check out other women, even though I'm not dating my friend yet.  Your boyfriend is being a disrespectful, anti-gentleman jerk.  Tell him that he shouldn't do that when he's with you.<br>  <br>  VIVA LA RAZA!
k5557KW2aa	becuse most girls want more then sex they want some one to talk to
oY1YzPMzaa	U should text him back. Let him know whats goin on on ur end. U will just have to weigh ur options on what u want to do with the schooling or family though. They are big discisions.
Qwd0dLVzaa	A friend? You must have an interesting relationship.|`|iIRy8seLaa	give them one first|`|6LBiVn1jaa	a friend? .... ok..|`|lK3TXGBOaa	mmh idk ive never given oral sex to someone.......<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  can you please answer my question?<br>   <br>  go to my profile under my questions its the first one that says <br>  <br>  " HELP!!! advice...."<br>  <br>  i would gladly appreciate it <br>  <br>  thanx:)|`|Ot2jBr17aa	push her to the ground. rip her pants open, put your force your ....... into her mouth.<br>  <br>  haha jk. jk. jk. jk. lmao...<br>  y do you want to give your friend head anyway?|`|5nNLcaaHaa	Grab them by the hair and force your penis into their mouth.

8XKmMBU7aa	If they blames you,  They will do right stuff with you.<br>  If you hadn't broken her arm, why wouldn't she had favoured you.<br>  <br>  Good Luck|`|AA10975867	You made your reputation so now have to live with it. I am having a hard time believing that an obnoxious bully who would beat a woman can't climb up a tree but maybe that just proves what a coward a woman-beater really is! God! You beat a pregnant woman! How low can you get! They will not EVER trust you and I don't blame them. Your cat story might be true but you are going to be watched for ever, dude, and you need to be! (Wow, Corona - so true! She surely would have called her family to say she'd broken her arm accidentally. OR was she waiting for bruises to heal from another run-in with this ape? Hmmmnnn....|`|f0503b7c948aabdd21ad5f5ddaca7e86aa	Sounds fishy to me.  Why wouldn't she have called her family and told them she fell out of the tree the day she broke her arm....probably because she didn't want to lie to them.  You are probably just writing this to show them some sort of fake proof of your fake confusion as to why you don't understand why they think you are still abusing your girlfriend.  I hope that if you have frustrations that you can hit a pillow, or work it out because a man hitting a woman is pathetic and only proves to society what a loser he really is.|`|596ba0725523b654ae88f9a7d31dae51aa	Unfortunately, that's part of the price you have to pay for past actions. You are damn lucky she decided to stay with you. You sound like even though you didn't do the tree thing, you should be in some kind of therapy to help you find a better outlet for your anger. Even if they seem to deserve it, you should never, ever, hit a woman. <br>  So anyway, actions have consequences, dude. You just have to live with it, and, frankly, you deserve it. You still have a lot of repair work to do. You better treat your two ladies like gold, and maybe after a few years or more, your actions will be maybe not forgotten, but somewhat forgiven.|`|cadaf08b5e2b5ca7fea1ef6cb7035c53aa	Their loss of trust in you is well earned.  It will take a long time, if it's possible at all, before they believe in you.  You need to be patient and respectful.<br>  <br>    When you have children of your own you'll understand how protective you can become.<br>  <br>  If any of them accuse you directly, tell them that you understand why they think you're capable of that, but that you got help and are not ever going to hurt their daughter again.  Mean it and time will show them you're for real.|`|L4jMOVvPaa	well these things happen al the time. my sister was goin with this guy and he was a total nutter. he used to beat her and burn her and since my mam is into all the spirits and **** like that she said she could help him. ,y mam would take him to our house and do whatever and then he kept on doing and would blame my mam! "your mams ***** with ma head!" hed say stuff like that to turn my sister against us.<br>  <br>  any way sometimes people will use excuses if theyre not happy with something. maby you need to get to know them so much as they wouldnt confront you with that sort of thing.|`|L0AZ6tHGaa	i don't really blame them for thinking it was you. i mean you did beat the **** out of her before, so why wouldn't they think it was you this time? you have to live with the consequences of your actions.|`|e2bc9d6d80cd30940315e03dcd764fd3aa	Did you convince yourself she really fell out of a tree? I think you did it and manipulated her so successfully that you're confused now about what really happened.|`|iJimc8XYaa	sounds to me like you are just a pu$$y.......<br>  but...whatever....scared of getting a cat <br>  out of a tree<br>  bull$hit
oPFhz1EPaa	Make him a big collage. You should frame it, and cut old and new pictures of you two together-- from when you first started going out, til now. He can hang it up in his room, or in his closet (if he's weird about having it up for everyone to see.) I did this for my boyfriend, and he loved it. Or if you're not a creative one, then treat him to a date night! You plan it, like set out a candlelit dinner at your house or a picnic somewhere nearby. I hope this helps :) Good luck!|`|Sofk2yO8aa	buy him a motorbike|`|iMo6cRN1aa	ooh i know, make him something, its more special then :)  but what do i know, im 14 :) umm does he like reading? you could go to thorntons and get a cake personalised for you both :) i did tht for my mum and dad once on their anni. <br>  thats all i can think of for now, sorry <br>  good luck :)|`|nuYxVIkUaa	It would be expensive, but you could get him a really nice watch...from a really good jewelery store.<br>  <br>  Just a suggestion...|`|L0AZ6tHGaa	butt secks|`|YFXbfssiaa	need a poo :(
71fc8cbea5928669e06e7c42a2dd8046aa	The problem is your afraid. You want someone in your life but your afraid to get hurt. As soon as they start to care about you, you back away. You probably feel like if you never give anyone the chance to get close, they can't disappoint or hurt you.<br>  <br>  I have known many girls like you. The only thing you can do to stop this kind of behavior is take a leap of faith like the rest of us. Yeh, you will probably get hurt, but thats part of life.<br>  <br>  Next time take a chance and let your guard down.|`|zFDUoid2aa	well it does Not sound like you had any real connection to these boys if you keep getting bored. sound like you need someone more interesting by your standards or maybe they are boring. i dont know. are you worried nobodys intersting to you?|`|ge5x9NHxaa	You have to change your attitude before it's too late.  From today make amend and let your relationship to work.  You have the keys to your life and to make change.|`|uSiTwFqwaa	it is kinda mean leading guys on and then rejecting them... instead of rejecting them once they like you, try actually entering a relationship...|`|2Fdytg8Laa	you probably are so used to dating a certain type of guy. think about the guys you date. are they similar in some way? no offense, but you probably need to get your boy priorities straight. <br>  <br>  or, it could be that you didnt ever get to spend time with them. if you only see him in school theres a least likely chance your relationship will last long, because u cant kiss in school or even show affection..<br>  <br>  sorry if i was harsh, but i hope you take this as constructive advice! <br>  emma?|`|ZTDgKPh4aa	Ok theres nothing wrong with you once you find the right u will stay with them for ever. Try to spread things out with them i am not saying dont do stuff with them but just dont do it all at once. Tell the guys that you date about ur porblie. Just remenber that everything happens for a reason. And if the world dont want you with that guy you are not susposed to be with him. Do some stuff differnt spice it up.<br>  God loves you Good Luck|`|HksTtfNgaa	THIS MEAN THATS YOU FIND OUT WHO ARE THESE PEOPLE SO  YOU DONT WANT THEM BECAUSEOU KNEW THEM BUT AFTER WHEN YOU FIND SOMEONE YOU LIKE HIM YOU WILL NOT SAY NO IT'S ALL BECAUSE YOU DONT LIKE WHAT YOU FIND IN THEM|`|6lL4hwM6aa	Don't go out with anyone you don't like.

And probably being a bit shallow by nature. you only like guys depending on how good they look, and don't even take time to get to get to know them. You're having these little crushes because it is fun and you obviously don't actually want a real boyfriend or relationship.|`|MzanmVtdaa	think about every decision u make. if u really feel somthing, then go for it! if u hav butterflies in ur stomach wen u think about them, if u dream about them, cant function without them, always zoned out wen there not there.... then go out wit him. if not, then stop going out wit people for a while. maybe u need to do ur part or find a more interesting guy|`|M8gOaGN3aa	sounds like you enjoy the challenge but,...<br>  <br>  why not try dating them even if you feel bored with them by the time they like you.

sV0fKe6jaa	"my other moms" ??<br>  <br>  Well, hold old is your mom? (i'm sixteen, and my mom is 42). Her father was a preecher when she was born, so she was never allowed to do anything, go anywhere alone, had to be in bed at 6pm, and awake at 6am. (this is true, i hear it all the time!) She's always relating her life to mine. Saying that she never gets to do the stuff i do... <br>  <br>  Now i hate sharing storries to show how i relate with someone, but what i am saying is, maybe she is jealous. thats what my councler told me. she said if you respect your parents wishes they will give your more freedom, and with that said, even though i didnt want to, it is true. trust me!<br>  <br>  you seem in your older teen years, by guessing. So i'm sure you only have a few more years to stick under her rules. <br>  <br>  good luck. (: <br>  remember you arent the only one. /:|`|AA12198711	Some of todays fashion trends for younger adults is less than flattering to them as a person. Your mother sees that.

I think she likes you but she may be unsure if you still do as she may have the attitude that as she knocked you back you have already moved on.<br>  I think you should maybe try to meet up out of school as friends, maybe go to the cinema or something, nothing big. And maybe then if it goes well make the move and ask her out. Try not to be shy. What have you got to lose?<br>  I had a problem like this once. I asked her out, she said no and so I left it and now we are really good friends and I always feel like if I had've been a bit more persistent she would have maybe said yes eventually.<br>  But all in all you will know what is right and sometimes you just need to make the move and ask the question and then at least you will know where you stand.<br>  Let me know how it goes :)|`|uvOhOUllaa	if you think she feels closer to you now then she did when you first asked her out, you might ask her again or ask her to clarify the situation. if things are still just friendly, keep being her friend but don't mention it anymore.

QBKH8LsPaa	Mine is doing the same. He's been caught before and he keeps away for three months or so and then goes right back to it. I'm coming to the end of my tether now. I've just found out he's arranging to meet some of them. It started with women across the world and now its women in our own back yard. I'm trying to find the courage to walk away before he does cheat on me physically. I know you probably want to hear a positive line on communication etc. Ask him straight out. If he says yes, talk to him about it and how you feel. If he says no, he could still be doing it. I'm not saying he is, just that we tend to believe what we want to. Tell him he needs to have the respect for your marriage to be honest with you and that you wont be angry as long as he's honest and that you want to work it through.....if he still says nothing is going on, I guess you'll have to trust him. These things have a way of coming out. If it does, you'll know he didn't even care to be honest about it when you asked him. Don't be like me.You'll end up feeling like someone pathetic and weak. If you're not happy with it, and he has no intention of stopping, walk out!!!!!! He's not worth it, what you will feel like is not worth it.|`|0a6f37ff97b71253871297bc4face75aaa	eharmony has an interesting free compatibility test, maybe you should both take it to find out if you really are 'doing fine'. If you both sign up, what do you think the odds are that you would be matched together?|`|veZLfnGFaa	Talk to him and find out.  He might have just been surfing the net.  Don't jump to conclusions before you know what's going on.   :)|`|hSy8ZKRXaa	I wouldn't worry about eharmony. Someone has probably sent him a link and once you click on it they never let you go. You can't get off eharmony once you've been there, and they make it sound so innocent like it's not really a dating site. They're like vultures. Once they get their hooks into you they never let go. I clicked on their website years ago, and I still get emails from them even though I never got involved with them. Once they have your email addy, you can't get rid of them.|`|AA10250918	It's interesting...I'm married and I've checked out the matching websites just to see who I'd be matched with, but with no intention of leaving my husband. Wouldn't you want to know? <br>  <br>  Now, if he starts coming home late or being secretive...if you get that gut feeling that something is not right, talk to him about it. Otherwise I think he's just curious, like I was. Maybe you should get an eharmony account and see if it matches you with him!|`|RHux2Fmnaa	My husband treats me like a queen, tells me he would die without me and does many things for me to show how much he loves me...but, still every chance he gets watches porn -and masturbates to it-, looks into eharmony, match.com, is always trying to get in touch with his ex's through classmates.com, etc. He's a compulsive cheater. Whenever there's been a family reunion where he gets to see old -female- friends, he makes sure they know our marriage is not that solid (he thought I couldn't hear what he was saying). It's just sad how many men say they adore their wives, yet, cannot seem to stop their attempts at cheating. You need to talk to him about this and find out what his true intentions are when he looks into eharmony and such.|`|v8lSuNQzaa	You know, just because someone is curious on a dating site does not mean he is looking. I go on Yahoo personals to look and see if i know anyone on there. And yes, my husband knows that i do it.

You are nice person in be invol with him. until he understand god rules maybe he not visit her mother. the moises rules are only 10. if he can forgive mother maybe he will change mind.

AA10327793	Well, talk with him. Say "hi", and when he says back "hi", then start talking with him. If you are afraid that he will say no, then why aren't you afraid that you will be hungry today? He can say no, but he can say yes too. You won't know it until you talk with him. Be brave!
iMtGIiMQaa	what does pi-st mean?<br>  <br>  but i think you need to talk to jillil and tell him to quit it or tell him you will report him or something.
hCJ66msnaa	well you both said you want to wait so it didnt look like you broke up because of him but did you? regardless of your answer to that a week may not be long enough because even if you didnt break up with him for the other guy if only a week you start seeing the other guy your ex may still believe that is the reason you may want to wait a little longer like at least a month|`|0f30f66fc86cce53e3a3756af8324bd1aa	You're young...you should do what makes you happy.

It will help you clear your head as well as be respectful to your ex-boyfriend. After a week if you feel ready to be in another relationship then I would say go for it, but if you need more time don't be afraid to tell the guy. If he really cares about you he won't mind waiting a bit. Good luck!|`|C3CmrjmKaa	the only one here that will suffer any loss is you ex's friend.  perhaps they will get into a fight if your ex still has feelings for you.  id say your ex may also be sad because he sees that a week latter your already over him.  if both of you weren't feeling anything for each other and your ex's friend is fine with it then i suppose it should good.  follow your instinct.  do what you think is right|`|Rt1FfBchaa	I don't see why not, Good-luck :)|`|Ujh2TE1daa	yes ....u should listen of ur heart....|`|n6zHBxY8aa	I'm a girl.

Its different if it was another guy, but that's his friend and it might cause a lot of problems between them. I saw that happened before to a friend and all his guy friends turned against him and werent too happy with the girl either. Theres alot of guys who can be sweet but I dont think yu would like it if he went out with one of your friends either. Im not trying to be rude at all, I'm just telling you from past experiences.

It can last for a few weeks, or a few months at best.  Once the euphoria of new love wears out, he'll come around as well.  I don't think your dad is doing that to hurt you.  I don't think he can help it anymore than anyone else can at this point.<br>  <br>  Prior to him having this girlfriend, how was your relationship with your dad?  If it was a good one then you have nothing to worry about.  He'll come around.  <br>  <br>  With that said, however, I don't mean to tell you to let him off the hook about this.  This is solely for you to understand that this isn't about you and that you're not at fault.<br>  <br>  You need to tell your dad in no uncertain terms that you need to talk and let him know that his absence is hurting you.  If you are afraid to bring it up in the open, maybe you can talk to your grandparents (his parents) and let them know how you feel.  They might in turn scold him in a way you may not be able to get away with doing, LOL<br>  <br>  Keep your chin up.  This is a phase all of us have gone through.  If you had a good relationship with your dad prior to this, you will do so again.|`|VQtKujZoaa	awe...<br>  <br>  my boyfriend has talked to me about this. his dad is doing the same thing. try to not be negative toward your dad's girlfriend... she doesn't understand or know that she is doing anything wrong. this is between YOU and your DAD... and shes not doing anything wrong, your dad is the one who is not thinking straight.. so please don't blame her... it will only come back at you negatively and push your dad even further away.<br>  <br>  What you should try to do is ask if you can join in whatever your dad and his gf are doing. When you call your dad to make plans, tell him that you don't mind if she comes along and suck it up. Even though... I know how hard it must be.<br>  <br>  Listen... I don't know if you've ever been in love before... but your dad is just excited to be in a new relationship. It doesn't mean its right what he is doing to you... he's just not thinking straight. I'm sorry you have to go through this, but hang in there. I think he will come around!|`|65m62rDraa	I am a mother of a 15 year old son who is in a similar situation as you are. My husband/his father had left us for another woman. Although my son gets to see his father some days, it is not the same relationship, and the father he has now, is nothing like the father he knew.My son suffers greatly by it. Your father, like my son's father seems to be very selfish. That means you have to do your best to except that and move on with your life and your future. Whatever your father is doing, and as much as it hurts you, your future is the most important thing in your life. So focus on your education, keep busy with hobbies and fun activities, and think positive. Whatever your father decision might be/or has been, it is not your fault, and you need to be strong and move on with your life!
4795d77d0f5d92b1857cb97388d9b05eaa	Sounds like you have a serious crush. You should tell her that u have feelings for her. It's not fair for her to torture u if she knows how u feel. Let her know casually, keep it light and don't put her on the spot, then give her some time and space to let it register. If she feels the same she'll come around. If not then stay away from her for a while so u can move on.|`|s5y6SZhnaa	this has happened to me twice. i like to have guys as best friends, because i think it tones down all that b!tchy gossipy drama. but sometimes, they think i want more from them than just friendship. <br>  <br>  honestly, i think from what you've said, she doesn't really love you like you love her. she loves you as a best friend, because thats what you are to her. if you tell her you are in love with her, it may even make her upset, because she will feel like she is losing somebody close to her, and gaining another admirer. <br>  <br>  you have to learn to live with not being able to go with her.|`|ghISlqExaa	it may be  love. But love is different for many people if you love her try to give her signs and then she'll usualy fall inlove with you aswell.

xoXkHOVsaa	The best thing to do is talk to him about why you want to get back together and how you plan to avoid the problems that broke you up in the first place.  If he says no, accept it.  You can't force someone to take you back.  Give him space if that's what he needs right now.|`|kDZjuKUaaa	people break up for a reason.
BaXSNq3aaa	why bother even hanging out with them or listening to their worthless crap. you need a friend who will appreciate you who you can hang out with whos honest. you should go try finding other friends and ditch them. cause im sure theres more better people out there for you.|`|pnA1GWPqaa	say bye thats all explain why.

orxxu75Gaa	ok she likes you but shes playing hard to get. first just keep going out with a couple of friends and look at her and try to put emotion in your face and let her know you like her by doing that. but you have to hurry and tell her like (before the last of next month) make sure she knows hoe you feel because if you dont you will be stuck on a friendship level forever.|`|hCJzZ5rnaa	Check to see if he glances at you frequently, or gazes at you for a prolonged period of time. If he is just your friend, he might just give a faint smile with raised eyebrows perhaps. If he likes you, he will glance away quickly, so you don't think he was staring at you.<br>  <br>  You might ask why he doesn't want you to think that he was staring at you, that's because he doesn't want you to think that he is a freaky stalker or anything lol. Believe me, a lot of lads do worry about that, me included! If he was just your friend, then he wouldn't be bothered if you thought he was a stalker, in fact, it wouldn't even occur to him.<br>  <br>  Check to see if he messes around with you, teasing and stuff. Sure, friends do that, but does he do it more often than others? When he does, do you notice him look into your eyes while smiling and/or laughing? That proves that it means more to him, and subsequently, that he likes you.
4795d77d0f5d92b1857cb97388d9b05eaa	I think your refering to an emotional connection during sex. If you have an attachment to that person then it will most definetely be an emotional sexual experience. If u feel connected it is emotional. But if your completely detached, and your only connection is sex, then this is unemotional sex, (no strings sex). Men are more commonly likely to have unemotional sex because they Are less emotional creatures than women, but not in all circumstances.|`|WulN2FWMaa	Well if you love the person the answer should be obvious.

kmOx8Hu6aa	I dont think youre being too worried, if he cheated before whats stopping him from doing it again? How do you know that he didnt like this other girl as much or more than he likes  you?<br>  <br>  If youre concerned about it, yes mention it. But know that you cant change anyone- if youre not happy with his behaviour, then get out... if you want to try to tolerate it and see what happens then do so :)|`|88549bab6924439810ef4c92c64e5634aa	Listen, the parties involved in high school relationships rarely are looking for something long term serious like marriage. If you were older, I would suggest talking to him about the partying and working out a compromise like he calls you to check in and make sure he's OK and not doing something he isn't supposed to be.<br>  <br>  However, because something like that needs to be brought up and changed in a serious relationship, I'm not sure how well that would fly with a high school boy. If you feel like it's worth it, and you both are mature enough, then go ahead and have a talk with him about how it makes you uncomfortable, worried and uneasy. <br>  <br>  You shouldn't ask him to stop completely, because that's who he is and that is what he likes. You wouldn't want him to ask anything like that from you. Instead, work on a compromise that makes both of you happy. It's the healthy relationship/mature thing to do.<br>  <br>  If that's not the course of action you want to take, then I would say let it fly and see what happens. If he cheats, you know not to make that mistake again. Don't date a guy that parties since that's not you. <br>  <br>  FYI: Drinking only changes someones character so much. So does drugs. As a habitual smoker, I know I have full control over my actions when I smoke and would never cheat on my boyfriend. Drugs and drinking are a convenient excuse for someone to blame their mistakes on.|`|PeJnA85Raa	I don't think there's anything wrong with voicing your opinion to him, he may make you feel better about your feelings. It sounds like he really cares for you so he seems less likely to cheat on you. But despite how you feel, don't expect him to change his partying behavior, or even try to pressure him to change. That could cause the relationship to go sour fast. I think the best approach would be to tell him how you feel, but make it clear that you are not trying to change him, but you are a bit worried because you wouldn't want to lose him. Good luck!|`|T33Za7jiaa	It's his choice.<br>  Let him make his own mistakes.<br>  All you can do is give him good advice.

I know a lot of people who start going out with a person, then they don't talk. So my advice is to give him your number or ask for his and have a way to get in touch with each other. If you both like each other the rest will work out.

If you can't think of anything to say, pick a random subject or talk about something funny or just ask the other person about them.

Anyone who looks down on you or judges you harshly on your height in any way is a lesser human being themselves, and not worth worrying about!<br>  <br>  As for attraction-wise, personally, height doesn't influence who I'm attracted to at all, though I tend to suit shorter guys better anyway as I'm only 5'3"!<br>  I don't imagine height affects physical attraction for most, though taller women may prefer men of a more similar height; I'm still sure they don't generalise shorter guys as creepy though; that's ridiculous! <br>  <br>  I assure you it's really not an issue at all! Please don't go worrying about nothing. <br>  <br>  Hope this helps a little!

OjoRulRUaa	my parents have 10 years difference. my moms the youngest and now shes going out with someone 13 years older! <br>  <br>  My advice: Ask your gf if she wants the relationship to last, then tell your mother that her mothers cool with it! Because there has to be a reason that her mom let her go out with you in the first place!|`|DJXEfzG5aa	age is a number tell your mom how you feel about her and if she still dont approve sorry i cant tell you ant more thats all i got|`|1gf0BwcXaa	age number doesn't count. it's just a number! what matters is the LOVE.<br>  <br>  <br>  that sounded so cheesy. xD lol|`|dPxcoeP0aa	im sorry, to me. if the age bothers you now. its going to keep bothering you. and if you really like her, your mom will to in time.
03rggPF2aa	you both still have a lot of growing up to do. you are not fully developed mentally until you are 25. please wait to get married until you are that age, or at least done with school and able to financially support yourself (in case of divorce.)|`|dX4Dll0yaa	You are way to young. You don't even know what you want out of life when you are 16. A lot of marriages end in divorce even when the couple has a mature relationship. Also, you have only known him for a year. That is not long enough even for adults.|`|2KC467tFaa	I don't think age should matter, but it's the maturity we're all concerned about. I'm not implying you are immature, but I know how much people change around that age in just a few years. You have a lot of experiences ahead of you. Experiences have a tendency to change people. I would strongly advise you to wait a few years before getting married. Get engaged, but set the date a few years ahead of you. If it doesn't work out, at least you won't have to worry about finding the money for a divorce. Divorces are long and can be extremely messy; whereas a break-up just takes a while to emotionally get through. If I would have married my high school boyfriend, I would have missed out on my husband. My husband is the one who is perfect for me. We have much more in common, identical goals, beliefs, and communication skills. My ex was sweet, but I wouldn't have felt as free and happy if I would have married him. All I'm saying is there might be someone better for you, but you won't know who it is until you go through certain experiences that lead up to you meeting him. Do what makes you happy, but make a conscience decision before you close doors of opportunity.|`|QNoGRmkUaa	Over 90 percent of teen marriages end after a year or so. <br>  A researchs outcome was that teenagers cannot think about long term consequences. <br>  You cannot either. <br>  There are long term consequences! You'll make the biggest mistake if you marry at this age!<br>  I know how it is to love somebody very much when you're 16, but it won't work in a marriage. You're both too young. This boy I loved told me he wanted to marry me, wanted to have a child with me etc. Two weeks later he dumped me because he liked someone else!<br>  At this age you can easily change your mind about things! Normally that isn't bad, but marriage cannot be changed that easily! <br>  People need to get some life-experience before they can settle with someone. You need to go to college, study and get a job. Once you have a house and a solid income, you can think about marriage. <br>  Age does matter!! 7 years or so from now you will think back at this and realize this was the craziest idea you've ever had! <br>  So DONT DO IT!|`|gEaZEqbYaa	it is better to wait .........no hurries if you both really love each other no one is going to run away.........so chill and enjoy|`|RvRe45seaa	How about a NO, your ONLY 16. I think don't think it's a good idea. AT ALL.<br>  <br>  ~`?|`|WcioB4JFaa	Honestly I don't think it is a good idea. I know you've heard it before, but I'm going to say it again: your not done growing up yet. You are both still getting an education, and you are both still trying to find out who you are. Don't rush into a commitment that's "till death do you part"<br>  <br>  I know that you love each other, but think it through first, if all you want from this is to show that you are together, go steady, it's old school, but it'll be something to show the both of you what you mean to each other. Untill you are old enough and mature enough for marrage.|`|GaEF8k3haa	I relate completely. My boyfriend and I were deeply in love when we were 16, and wanted to elope. But things turned sour within a year. Relationships keep changing, and what is important is how you are able to cope with the changes.<br>  I am now 22 and in love with a wonderful man for the past three years. Although we both really want to get married, we are going to wait. Passion alone does not drive relationships forward. Often it is patience and not wanting to give up no matter what. <br>  If you have gone through many deep and meaningful experiences with your boyfriend, and you know what it eels like to make (big) compromises, you could consider getting engaged right now. But then I suggest you have some fun, travel and experience a lot of life before you jump into marriage.<br>  Just my two cents worth. Good luck!|`|TnHKoM2naa	Don't do it. Wait until you both are at least 18 just to see if it would last that longgg. You two will be okay for a few more years without marriage. You need to test your relationship. Marriage isnt something you should do especially at a young age. My boyfriend and I have been dating, for nearly 7 months.Were in love but since im 17 and he's 18 we planned not to get married until im least 25.And he'll be 29. But nobody knows what can happen in that amount of time. Just take everyones advice dont do it. Wait a few more years. Your still in high school.|`|XBy7am73aa	Hate to say it but I agree when i was 16 i too was mad about my bf and loved him big time, we were crazy bout each other...trouble is when your 16 you dont know what you want, u just think you do. Why the rush?? If you were my daughter I would want you to wait. You'll understand when you are older, I didnt even know what I wanted at 25 let alone 16.  Get engaged but wait for the wedding, you have your whole lives ahead of you. Good luck|`|vFtdEejAaa	Hey, think about it. Your planning your life before you even know who your gonna be. To me, it doesn't sound like it's worth it. That's my opinion. Ask your friends, they'll say the same, that is if their honest. And just think what your parents would say hun. X|`|RjUraQrtaa	What you're about to do is stupid. You have your whole lives ahead of you, do you really want to be married at the age of 16? Think of how your mum and dad would feel.|`|gDfGfpMfaa	its better to wait. If u really love each other, then waiting for each other is the best way to show it.|`|aErUKUvVaa	DONT DO IT.  Ur WAY too young. PERIOD. end of story.|`|BOxOMdqWaa	don't do it your too young and eventually some things are gonna happen. i know so trust me|`|gm0QGJrPaa	i don't understand yoooooooooooooooooooooooooouuuuuuuuuuuuu...

You can prolly tell by "feel" if your partner has an i.u.d (extremely effective), diaphragm (pretty effective) or nuva ring (effective). No way to tell if she's on or using the pill properly (most effective), though a patch would be evident. <br>  <br>  If you're female, the hormonal ones (pill, patch, nuva ring) are undoubtedly extremely effective, but always carry risks associated with use (strokes, blood clots, etc.). If you know you want to put off having kids for a while, an i.u.d. can be extremely effective but requires a dr. to install and remove. Diaphragm is pretty effective, slightly more incovenient than others in terms of timing and applying; also requires dr. visit for initial fitting. Condoms can be pretty effective, readily available and convenient esp. if you're not that sexually active and/or don't have a steady bf.<br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|QqY8YgGDaa	Those used by Kings|`|B4ORpmS9aa	Abstinence but it is also the most boring form also.|`|mgiQvrafaa	What is the best birth control:<br>  Not having Sex<br>  Why:<br>  No chance of getting pregnant|`|8vfCRg7Caa	no sex at all, womens health not single and dating.|`|WGYlzefnaa	your hand|`|hCJ66msnaa	well obviously abstinence is the best but others are birth control for her and condoms cuz while birth control will prevent pregnancy, that is not the only thing you need to consider, std's are also a factor so for that you should also use condoms|`|xarKlp0Oaa	I like the Nuva Ring.

F5v5Qme0aa	It's not whether you pay or not that will give her the wrong impression, it's your demeanor with her. Be friendly, but make it clear the meeting is platonic. For example, talk about a potential love interest even if it's fictitious - it's a little white lie to help someone along.  Also,  make it a point to tell her how nice it is to have her as a "friend."  Aside from that, YES, of course you should pay. Especially if it's only a few bucks, that's the gentlemanly thing to do. If she protests, just say "the next one is on you!"  By then it will be the end of your meal and she'll understand that there is no romantic interest, so she won't get the wrong idea.  Good luck!  :-D|`|XR3SPPCVaa	Yes, you should absolutely pay for her. Not only did you suggest doing something with her but it's only the right thing to do. Guys should always pay for girls.

dkJfJkzvaa	It is a normal feeling for a person that is curious about things that are different than what their culture practices.  You show me a person that is all about their race, and I will show you a person that makes the very thing they're proud of look bad.  Having an open-mind is important, no empire that was dominant for a few centuries were comprise of one race.  So your feelings are natural, you just need to go out there and find what you are looking for, be proud who you are, you can do this while learning about others.  Wisdom comes from knowing and understanding things that have to do with Life, Life is the combination of all living things, different species and all.|`|55Xq3a5Laa	Yeah its normal.

Its a big buzz kill for me, theres no surprise or excitement left.|`|5fIBXX7gaa	well depending on where you live see now-a-days we have to be a individuals live the way we see fit for our familes. look at you life and say what's best for me? what do i believe? so think about it|`|OxFzFDgVaa	i don't think that's normal... but there in nothing you can do to change your race.....unless, you celebrate with other reces on there special occassions....or you could even invent an event of your own and make it public|`|C4fOQemVaa	<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMTj2Zt5fHo" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMTj2Zt5f...</a><br>  <br>  yes, especially if you do not speak spanish, like me, but hey this might help|`|L0AZ6tHGaa	you just don't care. you don't have to be all "oh yeah latinos are the best woo", you're normal, relax.|`|hcRGqk2gaa	Well I mean..... every race is like that. Everyone has certain holidays that they celebrate. Christians celebrate Easter and Christmas, while some others celebrate Kwaanza. <br>  <br>  If you're bored with your race then try to get into something else. I mean, I'm not saying go out there and pretend like your black or white or whatever.. but if you're old enough and it's not going to disturb the peace in your home, then try understanding another culture and do it one year. Figure out the meaning. Education is power and knowledge is the key. You might find something you like.|`|WlliZdy1aa	So you're mad at your culture, not your race?<br>  If you're irritated with doing the same things at celebrations and what not?<br>  <br>  It's not completely abnormal. I have to say the effect of Christmas has worn off me because it's insanely predictable.<br>  <br>  Maybe you can suggest switching things up a bit.<br>  Instead of making this food, try making that food.<br>  Instead of celebrating at this place, let's celebrate at that place.<br>  <br>  Take initiative.<br>  <br>  I'm not Latino and don't know exactly what you celebrate, but this is about the only advice I can give you.<br>  Good luck, I suppose.|`|jauVVrzTaa	I`m sure we all feel we wish we`d been born someone or somewhere else. Born in England I envy anyone born in Australia. Life here is so dictated by the weather and Brits are really gloomy people. But then there are millions all over the world would love to live here and be English. Celebrate who you are and where your from - it happened for a reason.|`|bf5084d1ec35330c95ff7b7bd883bbffaa	Yes, it's very normal.  You don't have to agree with everything that people of your race do.  Whatever you choose to do, I think you should just enjoy yourself.|`|7hZ2yzK4aa	lol. you make it sound like you're part of some clan.<br>  humans is humans is humans....if you get bored celebrating Pizza Day or whatever, then dont.|`|JqVU84yLaa	it just means your bored of the same routine doesn't mean your racist or anything like that

fLU63N4kaa	You both need to be with people who want what you want. Try and work on changing your stance about marriage (whether it be you or him). If neither of you can change, then you owe it to eachother to break it off and find people you will be happy with.|`|E7RhMRKhaa	Gently and to  his  face...|`|O2s8tLQzaa	You had compounded too much Martian level, our levels. What you did was about you had EVERYTHING, including why needs of a man to satisfy your needs. Nope, sex is exchangeable.<br>  <br>  One, you didn't know who you are.<br>  Two, you are the type that tolerably accept for the worst of your empathy.<br>  Three, you have everything, so did him. What's the point of marriage. Is it what you have in your thought?<br>  <br>  Sweetie, make your progress with a result. You had planned that a relationship was not just merely for a sex. There were more than that. Self-control is one of the most vital that you may learn in marriage life, and sustaining it. <br>  <br>  Marriage is not easy, that's what you think about it, right? Don't read many problems of people's problem of marriage. Because HUMAN only ASKS if he/she had stuck and without solutions. Imagine how many marriage that may hold until years, even with kids, and with problems that may be solved together. What's play the best role, Tolerance and Forgiveness.<br>  <br>  Our life is like a wheel lady, even when you work, when you earned money. Sometimes all is easy, but another times those were hard. In family relationship, in your family's relationship, friendship, marketing in business, etc . Those all were having their up-and-down occasions.<br>  <br>  10 years, imagine that if you're the man. I wonder some of women were expecting they became a wife, but you're not. There were something or a big obstacle while you think marriage is not in the priority list of your Venusian life.<br>  <br>  Lady, you need to work with your Positive Thought, either you like it to put negative rating on my answer. It's your right.|`|UUrqECXIaa	If you really do not want to get married (for reasons other than you fear having a panic attack at the altar) than tell him the truth. Tell him exactly what you just typed here-you don't need a piece of paper...and you have concerns about his debt.|`|rgW2hVpIaa	I guess it comes down to values. If you don't share the same vision, maybe it's time to talk about the longevity of your relationship.|`|a074aac3ad17521564085d29e2af8d4faa	You have different goals and I would let him go.

fLU63N4kaa	Everyone should be their own leader.<br>  <br>  <br>  Well, since you told him, it sounds like he's just afraid to make his own decisions. Maybe lack of confidence. Perhaps you could try working on that.|`|a074aac3ad17521564085d29e2af8d4faa	It just sounds like he is never content, always looking at what you could have. Show him what he has.
ANg8RFWUaa	The good thing to do is to give up on him, you dont want to share a bf do you? So its better to find another guy that you wont have to share.
rzPIO1aQaa	Contact a lawyer. if you have proof of what he has been doing than yea you can have the baby come live with you. The state will be involved for a while and I am sure the dad can keep his visitation rights as long as he follows the programs they put him on but custody will be towards you guys. Like I said get a lawyer so you can get the case started and do not tell anyone about what you are going to do so he doesn't get wind of it cause the first thing he will do is take off with the baby.|`|NuJako4gaa	cant deal with all this drama!<br>  oh and i believe that baby should go to u<br>  b/c u care the most|`|27vNdc4baa	k seriously....dont do anything rash and go and take the child now. It will amount to kidnapping and you could go to jail!<br>  <br>  You need to contact the authorities, i.e. child services and social services and explain to them the situation...once they take the child out of his custody you can adopt the child or become the childs foster parent and child services will be glad to help you with this!<br>  <br>  Good luck!<br>  J|`|d6bb91335d2d467b86fe9b280c4c812eaa	All caps is an eye sore. You need to convince the courts that he is an unfit parent. Next time he does drug or drinks call the police and tell them that the child might be in danger because his father is high or drunk.|`|rNUB8B6Vaa	Yes contact an attorney. If you have the proof and can show why you don't feel he is capable of caring for the baby then yes and asap|`|lYZ71zYAaa	You have to prove that he is an unfit father and doing drugs. And go through proper channels.|`|llepn8nyaa	it depends on your age <br>  and the court must favor in the child's best interest so it'd be a good idea to get a good lawyer and make a great connection with that child good luck cases like these,aren't easy to win.especially if your going against the state. now if you can get a good lawyer or can in some way let it be stated that you love this child and care more than anyone else you might win this case
LHupfSpNaa	Just talk to him like nothing happened. <br>  Act confident, and don't bring it up.<br>  If he brings it up, just say it was a good time and the party was fun.<br>  Try to just forget about it.<br>  Good luck :)
WmgDyhffaa	Maybe cause you lied to him?<br>  Some people can't handle being lied to. I know I can't. I hate being lied to with a passion.
ce53a9f68093b2a6cf60a521947320d0aa	taped conversations cant be used unless he warns that the conversation is being recorded.. but emails can (although can be easily fought as anyone with any computer sense knows they can be fabricated..) , written letters , voice mails, answering machine tapes..etc can be used in a court of law.. BUT it better have real reason to be heard based on the issues of child support, bills, medical etc.. because the judge doesnt care why u dont get along, he doesnt care about your vindictiveness he only cares about the "real issues"<br>  <br>  Things u need to know.. Your the custodial parent.. guess what.. HE DOESNT "HAVE" to see her ever if he so choses.. the law has to grant the non-custodial visitation, but can not force them to take their visitations...  he doesnt have to help with taking her to Gymboree class.. thats obviously a commitment u made for her to be in, so if he choses during his time not to take her he can..  once visitation is decided, he can go 3 months if he chose to with out seeing his daughter, and then show up out of the blue on his weekend and want to pick her up , and as long as its his weekend he can until u legally have things changed.. Being the custodial parent means u are ultimately the responsible parent at all times.. unfortunately the law allows the non-custodial to be a dead beat in their childs life if they so choose to be, the only thing the law can enforce is custody, childsupport and medical thats it.. but because he's the parent they have to give him visitation until given just reason not to. But on your side of the coin.. U DO NOT HAVE TO give her to anyone but him on his scheduled weekends.. if he sends his mom to pick her up, u can refuse and force his hand in having to pick her up.. BUT when he has the child for his scheduled time u can not dictate who he leaves her with.. (the complaining shes always with the grandparents.) just like he cant tell u when u can and cant have a babysitter or who u can and cant have babysitt her..  the courts dont care that he bought a new car they set the amount of child support based on his income.. and if he cant afford the car oh well, his problem..so its not like just cause he has a new car that ur child support will go down cause thats not how it works..  he will have to pay for atleast some of the marital debt .. perhaps credit cards ect that in both of your names , that kind of thing, so they will take care of atleast some of your burden on the "joint" bills..  as far as he's only given u 400.00  you can ask for the c/s to be retroactive from the time that he left the household.. so he'd already be starting out in the arrears on child support..  If you go in and start pulling out all the mean spiteful things u've both said to u, the judge isnt going to tolerate it.. so if there are things in these logs that may hold some substance to the issues at hand.. Bills, custody, visitation, medical bills etc.. have them with u and highlighted but dont bring it to the judge unless need be, the judge will think its petty and get upset at all the ankle bitting.. let him come off looking like the arragant azz and u sit there looking like the normal one, the judge will side with u more if u act mature and he comes off looking cocky, arragant and evil... <br>  <br>  Last bit of advice from someone thats been there done that.. u need to have the child support paid through the state if its not automatic in your state.. u need for it to be garnished from his check so u arent waiting for him to get around to paying it or constantly paying for lawyers to hold him in contempt. If he starts out in the arrearages cause he hasnt helped since leaving the house.. u ask for a with holding order to be placed on his income taxes so if he gets any refunds they take the arrearages out of his refunds until he's caught up.. <br>  <br>  Good luck.. pick and choose your battles wisely ...|`|FewhKlx9aa	He cannot use the taped conversations for sure the others maybe but you are already divorced and I would hope child support set up already.Being a police officer I know they can do some pretty sneaky things so keep your logs and hope the judge is on your side.|`|8103f5a386f35ec2420460c4f3b3dcabaa	This matter is better served in family court..settling child support issues..to visitation issues..plain to see that you have issues..and the only way to resolve them is in court.getting everything settle on paper with details for the court orders..nothing always works out the way it should with custody/visitation/childsupport issues.that is why there is court..|`|E7RhMRKhaa	I hate to burst the bubble of you and his  "gathering" of the evidence.  The hearing will be of financial matters of support for child.  Your income , his income, and the division of support according to set tables per child, per week.   The court does not care about any emails or any details.  Is not there for that purpose.|`|0KLu4hRaaa	He can use them the same as you can. Only one person has to consent to the recording of the conversation (in most states but check yours) and that is him obviously in this case. How nice of you to ALLOW him to see his daughter (just to be fair). You want to know what the problem is --- you have the attitude that you "ALLOW" a child to see her  bio-father when in reality that child has the RIGHT to see her bio-father. You act like you are doing him a favor which you are not--you are suppose to do what is best for the child.  <br>  <br>  Your attitude and the evidence he has compiled against you may very well seal your fate. Let's just hope if he gets custody he will be better about doing what is right for the child and not trying to determine what rights he will ALLOW his daughter to have. Because it sounds like he is collecting evidence for custody not CS.|`|uGEz4X0caa	Even if he could use them against you, what do they say?  They probably go along the lines about what a worthless piece of crap he is, which doesn't help him and in that case, he's be an idiot to use them.  I wouldn't worry too much about it, you're doing the best you can, and you have to do what you have to do to take care of you baby.  Don't put another thought into this loser, except to be grateful your rid of him.  : )|`|1NFJ5Trnaa	He's on the LAPD police squad? Well in the state of California, it's illegal to record phone conversations without the other person knowing. So if in fact he brings that to court, he will have a lot more problems than just child support.

(It's not true popularity, it's just being known as easy.....not something to strive for).<br>  <br>  You really need help......sorry.<br>  <br>  I can answer what you want to know, (how to be popular)....be yourself, and under NO circumstances be easy.<br>  <br>  Establish and maintain high moral standards, not only will you be popular, people will also respect you.<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  Luck

I had a similar experience with my sister once.|`|hcRGqk2gaa	Ummm.... what would make you feel better?<br>  <br>  <br>  Telling him will probably prevent him from using your computer again.<br>  <br>  Not telling him, would have more of a chance of him doing that again. I mean, masturbation is natural for men and women... so........... <br>  <br>  I would just be careful and try to think of how he would react in either situation.|`|qyPv50I2aa	i would tell him you saw it.  it is natural, but it is not apropriate for you to watch your brother.|`|delMvf8iaa	Let your brother do his thing at least he's reliving preasure.The good thing is he can't get a girl pregnant or catch a disease.Maybe for xmas you could give him a jar of Vaseline|`|XSHLHq8saa	this maybe help you. you are really inocent boy. boys for all over the world jacking off. some guys start at 13 but some are interesting in others things like sports. you most talk about sex with your brother and let him know, the same room is the right place. maybe next time he feel horny the bathroom he will go and visit for a moment. it is weird about people at your age still living at home. I supose people go to university at 18 years old.

V96p5opeaa	Hi.  I am not sure about how things work in India, as far as marriage etc goes) but here in the U.S. you are free to marry anyone you wish.  <br>  <br>  Everyone - no matter where you are born or what your heritage is - is born of FREE WILL.  You get one life and what you do with that life is up to you.  You should not marry to make your family happy.  You marry someone that you love and someone that you want to start a family with.  You marry someone to be partners with them.  You don't marry someone because you're the oldest in the family or because someone told you to marry him.  Do you want to spend your life being miserable with someone you don't have feelings for just because you're afraid of disappointing his and your family?  That's just silly!!! <br>  <br>  Also, why do you think that you will be alone forever if you divorce this guy?  You had a boyfriend prior to getting married so what makes you think that another won't come along?  Again - you were born of free will that with that you are allowed and able to make your own decisions!  Stand up for yourself and tell them all how you feel.  You have a job and you can be independent.  Be your OWN woman!!  and.. do this before you have a child.  It would only make things harder for everyone.  Good luck and God Bless!|`|8103f5a386f35ec2420460c4f3b3dcabaa	It's really only up to you to figure out what you want to do with your life..maybe talking a counselor and speaking to someone may help|`|NwVwZ8Tjaa	Your family should support whatever decision you make.  It is obvious that you are hopelessly not in love.I think you should divorce this man and face the future head on.  You can't find true happiness if you are stuck in park.  <br>  <br>  If you are a good woman that exudes positive energy men will notice and you will find mutual love.  You have to try.  Move on now before it is too late.
gRXy66dOaa	yea its normal, theres nothing wrong with it*|`|AfnQ95Z5aa	If he's masturbating then you're not having enough sex to satisfy him.  It's as simple as that.|`|eS9nPWqBaa	Lady you are crazy....seriously you're measuring his sperm.  Who cares if he masturbates - more than likely he's thinking about how your vag feels when he's doing it.|`|2YX18RE2aa	Sometimes a guy just wants to lower his sperm count without having to perform or be subject to someone measuring the output.<br>  <br>  <br>  This concept of being aware of volume brings a whole new set of questions to mind, like how did you know?<br>  Did you wear or swallow it?|`|NwVwZ8Tjaa	This is just so odd on many levels.<br>  I personally would feel like after three days of sex the sperm would be less than normal with or without masturbation.<br>  Your husband either has a high libido or he is also having sex with someone else.|`|ae3ecab489f9cbbdd2b51fb0492f64d3aa	Yes, this is normal. However measuring sperm is not normal|`|E7RhMRKhaa	The only reason he does it  is he is thinking of the last 3 days.....Sounds like a nice thought....He's just shy....On the next  fourth   day just join him in the shower.......|`|tEy9hvebaa	then give him more sex.. he obviously needs/wants it!<br>  <br>  once a day for 3 days isn't much! wife and I do it more than that every day each weekend (fri/sat/sun.... as in 3+ fri, 3+sat, 3+sun) and we're 50+|`|DWgyWFNyaa	its because u really dont satisfy him so u need to talk him and tell him wat does he want u too do because tats just not right|`|lvzlpjl2aa	i'd say that's normal... sometimes guys masturbate before sex to have more stamina. less man juice... not so easy to explode so quick.|`|v8lSuNQzaa	Why are you measuring his sperm? that is just odd.

For me and my guy it was our love towards one another and the fact that we knew we would be together forever whether we could get married at the time or not. It's a bond between two people and it means more to some than others. Me and my guy both got one when we first got together and we always wear them. Of course mine is an engagement ring now and will be a wedding ring in 2 weeks but he still wears his with pride and has never taken it off. He will have a new ring in 2 weeks as well but I am sure he will wear his first ring on another finger.|`|dIS08i1oaa	I apologize in advance if this offends any good Christians out there, and it is not meant to.<br>  <br>  Promise Ring was originally meant to be a token of affection, sort of like going steady.  It meant that when you were dating you would not cheat on your partner.  And it symbolized a bond and commitment between a young man and woman.<br>  <br>  A Purity Ring, on the other hand, has an entirely different meaning and sometimes Purity Rings are also called Promise Rings.  A Purity Ring is a vow of chastity meant to be kept until you find your true husband or wife.  The term "true love waits" is associated with Purity Rings, meaning that you will remain a virgin until you are married.  The Jonas Brothers wear Purity Rings.<br>  <br>  A Purity ring can be given by a father to his daughter, a mother to her son, or given between a couple.|`|Ekg4H6HQaa	It's about love and trust. You promise that you won't be doing anything stupid with anyone and when you find the right person for you, then you will do something with them, but no one else. That's it. You love yourself enough to wait for the right person, which also means you love the other person (even if you have not met yet) enough to respect him/her by not being with anyone else in "that" way.<br>  <br>  In this day and age, I'd also have to say is means courage and patience because it's hard not to get into things with people because of all the peer pressure and stuff like that.|`|9Zjk9dRqaa	it all depends on what he/she is promising you. yes most mean that he/she is promising you to get married but i gave rings to girls and make a promise that no matter what im their for them to protect them from everything.|`|4259a8b8fa5899f30c0e319fda9936fdaa	I would think that if a guy gives his girlfriend a promise ring, it it like a pre-engagement ring.|`|5voteJLRaa	I was given my promise ring from my boyfriend after a year of dating. When I got my ring, it was a confirmation of our commitment to each other. It let me know that he felt I was the one for him, but he just wasn't ready to make the BIG step and ask for my hand in marriage. I knew that he saw me as a potential wife still and that in time he would ask me to marry him. He has now asked me to pick out an engagement ring, so we are moving on to the next step in our relationship. Now I am just waiting for him to pop the question. It's like a pre-engagement ring.|`|PTnwi01Uaa	Nothing, it's an object that can be thrown anytime it doesn't work out. Instead of rings, why not have the person you care about in your mind everyday, all the time you're at home, at work or with your friends. Because see ok let's say you go all the way to getting a pathetic marriage ring, then all fo the sudden divorce happens, then what. After all that worthless effort, then everything went to the trash.|`|9sSWlgeeaa	it means that i'm promised to someone. that i'm engaged to someone and that I promise to be faithful to that person and love him/her!|`|l4bPFEhUaa	Its basically the same thing as an engagement ring. (Me and my fiance told our parents it was a promise ring because they thought we were too young to get married. About 6 months later we told them we were getting married in July)|`|26cae2932c19d290ec2e4570f9542e0baa	It's something cutesy that the jr high crowd does. It's the modern equivalent of back in the day when a high school boy gave a girl his class ring or letterman jacket to show everyone they were going steady, but not all of them ended up engaged and married later on. Adults don't take them seriously.
f8CN2qIvaa	Though I am pro-choice and believe every child should be wanted, it is never OK.  You are terminating a pregnancy.  I have a problem when it is used as a substitute for birth control. However, in cases of rape, incest,  teen pregnancy, or if the mother's life is in danger, then women should have access to safe and legal abortions.  Don't forget that the person getting the abortion has to live with the consequences of a very serious decision.|`|gPeEdjmuaa	To me personally, I believe that it's not okay. Abortions cause a lot of conflict and can really screw up someones life afterward. They create a lot of mental pain to the mothers, and even physical pain as well. I know a couple who had an abortion when they were younger but can't have children anymore because when the mother had the abortion the abortionist messed up her uterus, and now she is unable to conceive. She said that she only wishes that she could go back in time and change her decision to murder (yes, she used that word) her child, and just dealt with 9 months of embarrassment ad afterward give it to a good adoptive family, instead of dealing with a whole lifetime of grief and sorrow during which not being able to have kids of her own anymore. <br>  <br>  I've hard way too many depressing stories to ever think about getting one. Then again, I would never even consider it an option because I absolutely don't agree with it.|`|f5FmJRfIaa	Sometimes it is necessary, and it's not for me to say to someone that it is or isn't, I'm not in their shoes.  I doubt that anyone feels like it's "OK", even when they decide they need to. Educating yourself and using solid means of prevention is a much better option. <a href="http://www.plannedparenthood.org" rel="nofollow">http://www.plannedparenthood.org</a><br>  <br>  If there is anything that does make legalized abortion "OK" to me, it's because of what happened to women when abortion wasn't legal.  Many women died when abortion wasn't legal, in horrible and painful ways.  They would try to induce abortions themselves using things like wire hangers and knitting needles, or they would have the surgery performed in unsanitary conditions, often by unlicensed practitioners in a back room somewhere in secret.  These women more often than not died of hemorrhaging and terrible infections. If they lived through it, they weren't able to have children when they finally were ready to.  That in itself justifies safe, legal, and licensed abortion to me.|`|O2s8tLQzaa	You will have two answers for this. YES because I'm the... and the...<br>  NO because it's the .... and the....<br>  <br>  I mean if you think abortion is okay, go for it. Besides, I'm clueless on how one judge on what "abortion" was.<br>  <br>  How about using of pills, how about "death in belly", how about PREGNANCY PREVENTION; like condoms, pills, ovarium's take-off, etc. Abortion? Nope, they even JUDGE that value by their own CRITERIA or THOUGHT.<br>  <br>  My friend, people had their own right to choose. If you watch movie of "The Myst", you will realize that it's an ENDLESS result.|`|oK57m5RQaa	if its early enough..<br>  its your body, your choice.<br>  after a certain amount of time, than its wrong|`|j53r3pvsaa	cause...|`|5EIrFbHkaa	Will always be not ok, because before the sex relations, the person has all the choices at hand to your own body, but after that, another body of someone else (the child) in growing up inside of the mother. It's not the choice to the mother or father, give an end to the life that is incoming because this life doesn't pertain to them.<br>  Of course after the baby born is up to them give the baby for adoption and the new parents will be responsible for the baby education and health.|`|AA10905966	We had this discussion in law and main reasons for abortions are that lots of teenagers are getting into having sex which is their option but teens that are the ages of 14 and such have abortions because their just way to young that can't even support themselves and really why should our government let children go through such a traumatic thing like that when they go to school they have to wake up with morning sickness and having other these other complications there is no reason why they should even have to experience such a thing at that age.|`|XeMS4wGiaa	they just cant c tht they hav a beutiful child in them. and they prolly no longer want the kid, mayb it was an accident, or...yeah<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  abortion is NEVER the answer<br>  it is horrible<br>  i am ALL AGAINST abortion|`|BPbFAos0aa	i don't think anything to do with killing a baby is ok. this is a very touchy subject for me and i don't see how doctors or anyone can do it. if you don't want a baby, give it to someone who does|`|gRXy66dOaa	well, to me its not ok<br>  I think its wrong*

My boyfriend was 16 when I met him and he was the biggest prick to me for days until his friend told mines that he liked me!  Honestly he used to pick holes in everything i said and I really thought he hated me!  And then he started to properly know me and then he was the sweetest boy in the world.<br>  <br>  Eventually they get over this awkward age!|`|b1b2189c8ba661d29c84f87088fa4ee8aa	If you don't like him just ignore him and if he sends you email just delete it  yes and he sounds like idiot to i sure you have your own friends and don't need  him at all|`|cIYD9YqGaa	HEY! sorry to bother you, but we are going to upload our first 3 videos of the series UrNotSoBFF on Youtube. make sure to check in on this coming SUNDAY- TUESDAY :D
cebea3a8e8113acc7b540c298907a6c7aa	Disconnect the computer! Guys have so many eye candy sites that mess up the marriage by making him compare their wife to some 18 y/o nude porn wanna be. There is no chance for the wife to compare! Yes you can lose weight, yes you can dress sexy, yes you can style yourself to look wonderful. But, what chance do you have against a cute young nude girl with perfect hair, perfect tanned body and perfect "whatever"? If he likes brunettes then there is a perfect nude brunette, if he likes blonds then there is a perfect blond, if he likes red heads.... you get the idea. Try to get him to spend some time in reality because his fantasy is much better than you! Then again, just try to get him to admit he looks at porn! Oh boy there's a problem and a fight!|`|8ac2e5cbdd946ee60c803052559873c5aa	You're way too eager.  Most men like to be in control.  Even the ones who enjoy women initiating still like to feel like they have some control over getting it when they want it.  Back off and make him work for it.  You're too easy.|`|OHfZFR31aa	That can happen as guys get older. You just need to be more persistent and spend more time on foreplay. Every man is different so who knows what will turn him on. What does he respond to?|`|mFZeEm9paa	I am totally confused here. Now you are a woman?|`|60f46466d2dd728810388e09955b9b12aa	ur appearance should be attractive always,have a shower,nice perfumes,be pleasant,cook nice foods,watch romantic movies together.if possible have a drink together etc may make some changes.<br>  but pls do not expect him to bang ur walls every day,try to give oral sex it may work out.<br>  work,family,children,finance all these pressures reduce the sex drive.<br>  it is better sometimes u can pleassure yourself or use sex toys for a temporary relief.|`|lvzlpjl2aa	try pleasuring him orally. or ask him to join you in the shower, then when you get all steamy in there go for the home run. or try giving him a sensual massage.... but don't take too long you don't want him falling asleep. bring in some whip cream and put some on his tender spots... lick them off.|`|NwVwZ8Tjaa	He is probably putting the pipes elsewhere.|`|E7RhMRKhaa	Why must it be quickly ???  We have feelings you know.....Relax woman....Enjoy...As for the mouse.....Pet it.....kiss it....|`|W7uP1ty4aa	Dance for him or put up some mirrors in the bedroom.|`|MjSLQlIHaa	another woman for sure he'd wake up then! lol|`|AA12346188	Start oral sex.|`|2JPRTMIJaa	Well, most people men and women get bored with the same person, year after year with the same sex. It's just a fact of life. I'm not condoning cheating, but physically, we are not meant to be life partners. Most (not all) animals have multiple partners through life. <br>  I suggest asking him casually (maybe not even while in bed or in the "mood"), don't lay it on where he feels he's being accused of something. Men are just as sensitive as women. Then go from there based on his responses.
ZzTJ1A3Baa	Sorry about that|`|9eMYzY0Paa	Sorry for your problem, i know it must be rough. High school and Middle school are tough. But there's others out there. Get new friends.
8Zlrbeh0aa	well im a dude<br>  but seriously like call her/email her first and start small conversations<br>  find out key info like Married, children, single, etc<br>  then if u feel like it ask her if she wants to go get some dinner and talk sometime<br>  and if she finds out u have a lambo she'll prob say yes for that reason so dont make yourself look like some rich bastard. talk abt more personality things that way u know she really likes u not ur money|`|gM2eyQFKaa	I guess it depends how much I love the bad guy. If I kinda loved the bad guy, I would probably wish I listened to you and went out with you. But if I really really loved the bad guy, even if he's abusive and a drugy, I would probably stay with him. It's kind of an interesting topic though, I mean, honestly, if it was me, I would probably wish I listened to you cause your life seems to be pretty good. But still, I guess it all comes down to how much the girl does love the bad guy.<br>  <br>  --Remy
mFX18yxTaa	tell her how u feel<br>  most guys dont realize that we girls don't like playing the guessing game, she will prob respect that u came right out to say it and most likely has feelings for u 2! u seem rly caring and devoted... hope everything works out ;-)

lBe3zws1aa	yeah see i have a close friend exactly like that<br>  sometimes when i am sitting with my friend .. he would come up and say something like "so does this mean you guys are lesbians" and i think the reason to why guys act like this is because they want to be funny and most of the time there really shy and are trying to talk to you or something.. and when you ask them to stop or why there being mean .. they get mad because there simply just making a joke and arent really paying to your feelings<br>  <br>  i talked to my friend about it and was like what your doing <br>  is not right .. and sometimes it really hurts.. its fine once in a while<br>  but not all the times .. and i would really like you to stop .. and he stopped he still does it but not as much and his comments arent as hurtful<br>  <br>  so basically just talk to him and if he still does it SCREW HIM .. hes not worth it :D<br>  good luck hun|`|6HP348pAaa	You and your friend need to go up to him together and say: Kay, I know when you say all of those "jokes" it really hurts and if you can't stop joking around like that, then we aren't going to be your friend anymore.|`|15dA7weiaa	He sounds very inconsiderate & abusive. I'd drop him. There's plenty of nice guys out there.|`|f2dkqemCaa	Just say<br>  "suck a chode"<br>  :]|`|Q23Wdr1saa	He's such a jerk because guys are difficult to under stand like they just think totally different we make think one way but they with think the other just try to get inside his head....and if he keep doing make up some lie that'll make him mad|`|JvTF7UrMaa	....  fern i aint that bad and you all hit me first and i can proove it but you cant take it back and you all gang up on me in the first place its called self defence. you canrt expect a boy to be abused by loadsa gurls and not do anything back especialy when those gurls are your friends why do you think when we are at myne and your not all together to gang up on me we never fall out coz i have nothing to be defencive about coz i dont get ganged up on and abused. you think coz im a lad i can take loadsa abuse news flash i have feelings 2 !|`|9eMYzY0Paa	Tell him to grow up.

g3l5f9iwaa	If a guy I had a crush on hugged me after the first time he talked to me, I personally would be in 7th heaven.<br>  But some people warm up a little more slowly. She might be nervous talking to you for the first time. A hug at the end of a short conversation could be awkward. Maybe you should go for the hug at the end of the third conversation. You both will feel  more comfortable and who knows? You may not want to hug her by then (or vice versa!).

PVkHVyucaa	First things first if you see any signs of possible Suicide Behavor do not just assume it's no big deal. Make sure u constantly show her that you need her without making it obvious what your doing. You could perhaps sign her up for some therapy or get her prescribed anti depressants. It's very important that you try to be with her as much as possible. Take her out to new places and show her the good things in life. Possibly set up some dates for her so she can meet new people. About her being too sensitive you need to slowly test the water. With people like that however you say the wrong thing and the friendship is over. There are medications for stuff like that.|`|Qbjpft5aaa	don't tell her she's to sensitive. that might push her MORE in the<br>  suicidal direction. just make sure she knows your there for her.<br>  tell her you love her, are always there for her, stuff like that. you<br>  have to be patient, help her through her depression. tell her your<br>  worried, and dont want anything to happen to her. telling her you<br>  care is the MOST IMPORTENT thing you can do.|`|5HfsDZh4aa	The best thing you could do for your friend is get her some help tell her parents ( are they a ware?) just tell someone!!

73GkepzFaa	Its his first time he doesnt know quite what to do or how to do things yet. He's probably just a little shy/nervous about the experience but doesn't mean you weren't good. It could have been mind blowing and maybe he felt like he didn't meet up to it because it was his first time. We all have our insecurities. Just communicate with him and give him some pointers next time your having sex or something =P Men love direction, or comments, or dirty talk, I don't really know for sure xD|`|Pwg8IUbTaa	Oh dear you took his virginity..you naughty girl !<br>  Look,as it was his first time,he probably did not know what to expect or handle his feelings. I think give things a few more times and things will get better..at least I hope so for your sake.<br>  Try it again and see how things develop. Good luck|`|MWdBiGNjaa	No.  I think he's in shock.  After all, this was his first time.  If he didn't like you, he just would have ignored it.  But, considering he said he had an amazing time, that means he's kind of in shock, but had an amazing time!!!|`|Eq5JJMvJaa	No some men are sensitive,some of us keep true feelings buried deep.Be nice and sweet to him and DONT ask him a thousand questions about his feeling for you,he will answer in due time.|`|YSrMtjFGaa	hmmm..can you demonstrate on me?|`|oY1YzPMzaa	Hes probably just really nervous. Try talking to him about it, maybe that would give u the best insight on what hes thinkin|`|FFKbVKWDaa	it was his first time<br>  he was probably just overwhelmed<br>  he'll be fine|`|7MoTvFidaa	maybe he is feeling insecure|`|FlLsQcssaa	In my opinion the act of sex is a expression of love and you should not worry about it feeling good or anything like that. Giving your body to someone else and putting yourself out there like that is a true act of love and compassion. <br>  <br>  Maybe he was nervous or wasn't sure if he was doing the right thing, he could have also been uncomfortable. I can say much more because I'm a virgin myself.|`|WzrDiLqWaa	He might me scared. Perhaps he was afraid he could harm you and so did everything too softly. he will be more confident the following time. Just say you liked it and that you love him to make him feel better.|`|tG1vTi0Daa	f u k him again.|`|5rV95B9jaa	he is probally feeling insecure and overwhelmed about how it felt <br>  <br>  remember he has never had it before so he is trying to digest what happened<br>  <br>  he let you do it so that means that he had a good time<br>  <br>  just act normal as you usually would and then he will be ok|`|gbUKzTyVaa	normal virgin nervousness<br>  <br>  STOP THINKING ABOUT IT... BANG HIM EVERY OTHER NIGHT... AND WITHIN A WEEK OR 2, HE WILL BE PERFECTLY COMFORTABLE!!|`|YQUrWyH3aa	its normal your bf just isn't used to having sex and you are|`|tYnpVHpZaa	he just realized that he  is gay
HKZE2v0saa	if she is looking at you, or u catch her sttaring at you, then she likes you<br>  <br>  <br>  100% fact, happens to couple of times<br>  <br>  flirt back or do things with her, talk to her alot so you guys want stop talking again|`|j53r3pvsaa	she likes u !!!|`|1eYUof7zaa	sounds to me like she likes you!!!!!<br>  i think you should ask her out on a date be like hey do you want to go out sometime and then shell get the hint you like her then it willeskalade into a relationship!!<br>  good luck
LHupfSpNaa	Don't sweat it; I know exactly how you feel.<br>  I think it's just a little crush, and you'll get over it. But if you're finding yourself completely attached, maybe you should try to focus on another guy for a while, or focus on something really important to you right now. It will be hard, I know, but trying to keep your mind off of him will help. I managed to do it, even though it was tough. You have to realize though, that he has a girlfriend and unless they breakup, he's off limits. <br>  Good Luck :)|`|IE3i4dhNaa	this is probably just a crush. i doubt that it is 'love at first sight'. Maybe you should make sure to not get in contact with him for a while, and things should blow over. Hope I could help|`|HNAVlwV7aa	I think you're infatuated. but u can go for it. u need to do something though. u should flirt with him so that he gets it that u like him. but don't do it around his gf. u should become friends with them first, especially the girl. although, that would be wrong-to steal away her bf that is-, but go ahead. i think u like him because he can meet your height requirement though. <br>  <br>  but u can try.<br>  i mean, what's the worst that can happen??<br>  <br>  hope i helped|`|eM8jJ93gaa	It happened to me too, and i still have feelings for him even tho he just doesnt think of me anymore.  i thought it was love at first sight even though i just said hi to him ...  i dont know love is a very strong word.  i think you guys would have made a great couple...and your friend thinks so too and she dates everyone so it doesnt really matter that much.  i think it will eventuallypass unless he asks you out then it will take longer lol.  hope i helped  =)|`|AfnQ95Z5aa	No, it's interest and maybe infatuation.<br>  <br>  Love is much deeper than what you've described.|`|nYEkkNn2aa	this is just a crush you'll get over it
OHfZFR31aa	If you post this on the Politics & Government>Immigration board, there are people who can walk you through the whole process, application fees, etc<br>  <br>  It's not cheap to sponsor a spouse - it is going to cost you over $3000 in legal fees and application fees.
g0lNgc0paa	tell him how you feel<br>  i am exactly like you are.<br>  i dont go out with guys unless i am SURE of them<br>  i think this would be the right choice<br>  answer mine?<br>  <a href="http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;_ylt=AmP7cNe3HSxCBB4ub.sQ_xQazKIX;_ylv=3?qid=20090307100846AA0Qpjj">http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;...</a>
d36OrpbDaa	what she's doing is called neglect.  she sounds irresponsible, missing work and leaving you without groceries, not even telling you when she'll be home.<br>  <br>  this is not acceptable from a parent.  my mom's done it in the past (she is bipolar), and it's awful.  <br>  <br>  living with your grandparents could be a really good thing.  try to bring your little brother with you, because without you around at mom's house, who's gonna be there for him?<br>  <br>  i know from experience that some parents are just like this and you can't change them.  her problems are too big.  if she's willing to neglect her kids and miss work, her problems are bigger than just this one boyfriend.<br>  <br>  the best thing for you and your brother to do is to get out of the situation if it keeps up.  because it's not healthy.  you need parent figures who are there for you and take care of you.<br>  <br>  as a parent, your children's well-being must come first until they are out on their own.  because they can't take care of themselves yet.<br>  <br>  good luck with whatever happens.  but seriously, call your grandparents and talk to them about it.<br>  <br>  i'm assuming they'll help you.  if they don't, email me and i can help you to contact Child Protective Services.  you should research it first to understand what it means though.|`|9MhlmO74aa	you're not being selfish, your mom is.  her children should come first not her boyfriend.  it's not right for her to put off important things sao that she can be with a man.  that's immature on her part.  you should talk to her and let her know exactly how you feel and if she doesn't care that lets you know what kind of person and mother she is and living with your grandparents might be a good idea.|`|pwCUXz6Oaa	maybe her bf abuses her so she takes it out on u|`|0VVevBhBaa	She is being selfish, not u!  It should be ur choice that u don't wanna meet him and drive an hour away. I bet she is not gonna get serious with this guy anytime soon. Hope everything works out for u!|`|delMvf8iaa	I understand,your Mom should make sure you and your brother are taken care of first.Why don't you meet your Mom's boyfriend first then form your opinion  then.If you need groceries and she has not purchased them ask her first ,then if all else fails call Grandma .Make sure you give your Mom's new bf a chance you might even like him. Treat him like you would like your Mom to treat one of your new friends  PS I just read the second part. Honey it sounds like your a little jealous ,but that's ok tell Mom you NEED ONE ON ONE TIME! My daughter's father past away 3yrs.ago I haven't started dating yet.Just remember you will be grown in three yrs. then you might be going to college then who will be there for your Mom. She will be all alone .
