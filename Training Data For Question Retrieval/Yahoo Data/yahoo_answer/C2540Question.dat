20090205052658AAGlTMY	Cars & Transportation;Insurance & Registration	What happens after investigation phase in a theft claim?	My house was broken into about a month ago and many items (mainly my musical gear in the studio) were stolen. After reporting the incident to the local ploice and taking forensic examination I reported it to my insurance company too. An adjuster visited my house and took all the receipts and catalouges relating to the stolen items. The next week I was called that an investigation will take place which will involve a lengthy interviewes of me and other witness(s). The investigator interviewed and recorded all the conversation that lasted for nearly 3 hours. I can't remember any question about anything that he didnt ask!    I beleive that they have interviewed 2 other witnesses as well.  So how long more do I have to wait and is it a normal procedure every where?...does every one after going through the difficult time of loosing personal belongings then they have to go through the various stages of insurance companies and feel even worse?! Or maybe the number of fraud and dishonety have inclined dramatically so they have to deal with every claim in the same manner?..then I think they should change the so called "ONLY ONE PHONE CALL"  claim procedure!... Can any one tell me what will happen next in my case?

I know that employers (especially ones lke Tesco) always have a way of making it your fault....so i just wanted to know if it could be held against me, if i could get a warning for it or anything.

20090205063559AA7mxAq	Cars & Transportation;Buying & Selling	Should I buy or refinance my car.?	I have a 2005 Buick Rendezvous and would like to lower my payments.  At the time I bought the car I was trying to reestablish my credit and got an interest rate around 13%.  Now my credit has came up to 620 (not perfect but much better) and of course I would like to get out of that ridiculous rate.  But how?  To refinance I would probably have to pay it down to book value (about 2K).  If I trade it in and get a newer car (maybe a 2006 Honda Accord or Toyota Camry), after they add back the amount I am upside down, even at a lower rate would that lower my payment.  Any suggestions?

20090205075038AAkc4VT	Cars & Transportation;Buying & Selling	I was looking for a car in craiglist, and found a very good price?	but when I contacted the person through E-mail, he said that he would only do the transaction through E-bay, he said that for our protection, I would put the money in an E-bay account and they will hold it and release only when he ships the car and if I am happy with the car. My question is, why it has to be through E-bay, if am willing to go wherever the car is located, since he told me that the car is in orlando and I am close by. I don't understand why he says protection if the only thing that I have to do is take a look at the car and if I like it, just buy it. Could this be a scam??

20090205065612AAEiLMG	Cars & Transportation;Maintenance & Repairs	My car sounds horrible after an oil change?	2004 Kia Optima V6 - yes, some might say "eh, cheap car."  Yes, it is very affordable but it runs like a dream.  I've NEVER had any problems w/ this car & anyone who ever took a ride in it always acclaimed how smooth & quiet it was.  Well, NOT ANYMORE!  This past Friday I took it for its regular oil change & not soon after, my car started and is sounding like a wreck.  The motor sounds ridiculously loud as heck - if I hit 25mph or more, it sounds even worse.     They either messed w/ something else in my car or gave me the cheapest oil out there.  I already contacted them & will be bringing the car in tomorrow.  I'm expecting them to say there's nothing wrong w/ my car.. I want them to do a complete diagnostic on it & give me new oil while I watch!    For those car savvy readers out there - how do I prepare myself for tomorrow & what should I be ready to tell them - so that I don't end up looking like an idiot who knows nothing about cars (b/c...well... I know nothing about cars).    Thanks for your help!

20090205080124AAqZGD5	Cars & Transportation;Insurance & Registration	Improper Spelling On a Criminal Conviction Notice?	So I plead guilty to a DUI charge and have accepted my fate and consequences for lack of judgment. However while in court when they called me up to plead they said my middle name wrong. I corrected them and they said it would be changed for the record but when I received my conviction notice / fine my name was still incorrectly spelled.       The DUI happened in Alberta but I had a B.C. drivers license at the time. When I phoned back to B.C. to see how I would go about getting my license back in a year the registry informed me there was no charges on my license. This was about 2 weeks after I was charged.       So I guess my question is if they didn't write my name correctly, even just the middle name, does that mean it won't show up?

Yesterday my car had 14 inch rims, Tire size 185/65 R14      Today my car has 15 inch rims, Tire size 195/60 R15      Apparently 195 is too wide (at least for a 96 integra with stock coils) because (from the looks of it) the inside of my right rear tire was rubbing against the (stock) coil, which caused it to rub/overheat/melt and my tire exploded... in all likelihood the left is rubbing too, but I haven't checked it yet.      Because I'm not big on exploding tires, but I don't want to revert back to my 14 inch rims, what size tires should I get? I understand load capacity will change with a smaller tire, but I want to       1. Make sure my tires don't explode.   2. Try to keep the odometer and speedometer readings as close to accurate as possible      Also, I have read some about spacers, but I'm a bit hesitant about the idea, because I'm afraid it might put additional (too much) stress on my old wheel studs, and I don't want to take on the job of replacing the studs beforehand.

20090205092740AAievV0	Cars & Transportation;Car Makes;Pontiac	Is It Worth Putting a $1,500 Body Kit On A 85 Trans Am?	I own a 1985 Pontiac Trans Am and im thinking about buying a body kit for it. The trans am now has a front bumper that has a hole in it and is a little smashed up. I have it covered up with a bra but I want to get rid of the bra because it doesn't look that good. Overall I purchased the car for $2,500 and it now has 120 k miles on it. The only body kit that i can find is going to cost me around $1,500 to $2,000. Im just curious what you all think because I don't want to blow my money on something that isn't worth it. It seems as though the only body kits that i can find for this car is made by Xtreme Dimensions who are located out of California...      Any feedback would be awesome.   Any tips on where I can find a body kit for a 1985 Pontiac Trans Am are also appreciated...      Thanks
