20090202104444AAjxdqW	Business & Finance;Taxes;Other - Taxes	I don't understand taxes?	I know it's a somewhat complicated subject but if you can tell me in layman's terms I'd be greatful.      I've been working for the past 3 years. The past 2 years I got refunds of 600ish total and 1300ish total. I looked at Turbotax online and put in all my info (correctly), and it said I would end up owing money. I don't understand why? What makes someone owe money and what makes someone get a refund?      I can provide the monetary details if asked. I'm just scared. I was hoping on a 500+ refund to get rid of all my debts.

20090202112728AAvt5yz	Business & Finance;Careers & Employment;Other - Careers & Employment	Would I be insane to turn this down?	I was hired in January of 2008 at a chain drugstore. After 8 months as a cashier, I was promoted to Shift Supervisor. I worked 35 hours/week with no benefits. I was only 18 at the time, and the work was very stressful to me. After 4 months, I found another part-time job, and now I only work there (as a cashier) 10 hours a week.    I told my boss (when I asked to cut my hours) that if "Anna" leaves, I will come back. Well, it has only been a month since I said that. "Anna" got fired last week, and now my boss wants to meet with me to talk about me taking "Anna's" position. "Anna" was a Shift Supervisor also, but she was full-time with benefits.    Right now I only work 28 hours a week. My boyfriend and I are trying to save up enough money to move out, but it's not going well because we already have too many bills and not enough money!       My boss really wants me to go back to being a Supervisor, and says that I do a great job and have wonderful potential.       If I took this job, I would be able to move out with my bf (we've been planning for a year!), get a new car (I've been sharing a car with my mom since someone hit me two weeks ago), and get benefits.   On the other hand, I would be stressed out much of the time, and working in a job that I already know I do not enjoy.      Thoughts, please?

20090202112515AAHVM34	Business & Finance;Credit	How will it affect my credit score if I max out my credit card, but pay it in full each month?	I am 18 and just starting to build credit, so I don't really have a big credit line. My credit line is $500, and I pay about everything with credit.      It's not too hard to spend $500 in a month, and sometimes I find I have to even pay it off in the middle of the month, just so I can use it more.      So my question is, if I put a high balance on my card, but pay it in full each month, will that still negatively affect my credit score, or do they just count carrying a high balance over to the next payment cycle?      I'm asking because I just was reading that maxing out your cards can hurt your score, but I'm not sure if that means maxing them out and keeping them maxed out, or just maxing them out in general, even if you pay it off in full.

20090202112618AApyzLk	Business & Finance;Renting & Real Estate	Does refinancing our home make sense?	We began paying on our new home in August 2008 at $1320.00 (6.625 interest rate) per month. Its a 30 yr fixed FHA loan including principle, interest, mortgage insurance with home insurance and property taxes paid from an escrow account. We've made 7 payments, all on-time or early. Credit scores are mid to high 700s.   We have been offered to refinance at 5.5%, starting the 30 yr period over, skipping first payment, new $2000 mortgage premium but no out-of-pocket expense. Refinancing would save us about $100 a month.       Is it worth it? Are there tax benefits or penalties? What is the effect refinancing has on credit scores?      Is it worth it if we plan on selling after 5 years in the home?

20090202112952AASwL1y	Business & Finance;Renting & Real Estate	Renewing our lease with an eviction on record?	Last January my husband and I were evicted from our apartment for non-payment (long story!!).  Our landlord called my husband and told him that we had until midnight to get out or else we were going to be arrested for trespassing.  We called the courts because we had not received anything regarding eviction or anything.  The courts had that yes we were evicted but we had until that Friday to be out (this was Monday).  We started looking immediately for a new place.  We went to this one apartment complex and explained the situation and the property manager approved us to move in immediately.  She did not run a credit check or do any form of background check. She did have my MIL co-sign on the lease.  She told us to not speak of this to anyone because if the owner found out he would kick us out.  We had not been to court yet so she said it should be ok.  We went to court 3 months later and had no judgment placed against us but we were officially evicted.  We owed no money and we still do not own the previous place any money.  Well the property manger left in October and it is now time for us to renew our lease.  Is there anyway that we can be kicked out since there is a new property manger?  We have over a year of on-time rent, no problems, my husband even did part time work with the property for a few month.  Any advice???      Thanks is advance.

He is now being sued. He did so in an innocent manor, as he is not too bright and clueless about the laws. The law states the plaintiff is entitled to over $440,000 in damages. My friend is not rich, but does have some minor assets, but now way worth $440,000, not even close. He sold the pieces of art he made for a total of $1800, not much, he did not make much profit at all.     Since this was an honest mistake, what should he do? If he fights the suit and looses, would the jury / judge really award the full amount to the plaintiff? Are they forced to award the full amount if he looses or could the judge award a lessor amount? This guy is just some every day dude, not some huge corporation and it will ruin his entire life to have to pay that much. He did not really damage the copywrite holder, but technically violated the law.     Any info is appreciated.

The one issue is, I'm going through this thing on HR Block and TaxSlayer but can not find a place to put any of the things that are on the HUD-1. The only thing they ask about are things that are on the paper that the bank sent to me (1098 or 1099 form. Don't remember). That form only lists interest, taxes and PMI for 2 months. None of the money that went to escrow is on there. I know I paid 4 months of taxes in all.      Anyway... of the things on the HUD-1, what can I list (and where) on the tax forms?

I was working for chipotle over the summer, and they give you a 30 minute paid "lunch" break for 4-8 hours (if you work 8 hours you can have an extended break, or 2 breaks). but often the managers would cut the breaks short.      if you worked a morning shift you work from 9-4 - so a 7 hour shift.    but in the morning they would give you a break before the restaurant opens, and after you finish your open work. so if you finish it quickly you can have a longer break, but if you are slow you get a short break - possibly less than 30 minutes.      also they started to make us clock out for break and then make us do a "quick chore".      since they are only required to give us a 15 min break for 4 hours and they avoid making you work for 8. and also it's paid.      so is it fair/legal or whatever to make you work on a break, or shorten the amount of break time that they originally say they allow?

Is there still a chance to make money in this market? Is it just a little harder now? or what?

OK, I'm thinking about getting a permanent tattoo ad on my forehead, close to my hairline to raise some extra cash to pay down debt.  I've seen online articles which claims some woman got $10K for a tattooo.  On Yahoo answers, I've seen prices ranging from $15-$25K.      I think I found a UK company, Laptops Direct, which appears to pay $10K for a permanent forehead tattoo and an additional $2K per year thereafter as long as you still have the tattoo.  (Not sure if Laptops Direct is legit or an April Fools joke?  I have an email in to them and am awaiting response.)   So what is a fair market rate to charge a company to have a permanent tattoo ad on my forehead?  What do any of you think about the idea of an annual fee, like the $2K a year that Laptops Direct is willing to pay, maybe only for persons in the UK?  Do any of you know about any US companies willing to do this and how I would contact them?  It would be great to get $25K, if I could.  I'd like to try marketing this myself, maybe through craigslist and emails to companies, without going through eBay.  I'm open to suggestions and ideas.  Also, if anyone has any ideas on where I can find sample emails or sample ads for "Forehead Space for Sale," I would appreciate any and all tips.  Many thanks.

20090202145156AA4HyeJ	Business & Finance;Other - Business & Finance	Is this a trick? Message from Mr Saeed Ahmed?	So i got this no subject message that reads      "Dear Friend,   As you read this, I don't want you to feel sorry for me, because, I   believe everyone will die someday,and am contacting you because i   really do need your help,and i want you to help me with all your effort and   time for just seven to fourteen workings days of your time.I want you   to be honest and truth full with me that you will help me with my last   wish as a dying man.      My name is Saeed Ahmed a merchant in Dubai, in the U.A.E.I have been   diagnosed with Esophageal cancer.It has defiled all forms of medical   treatment, and right now I have only about a few months to   live,according to medical experts.   I have not particularly lived my life so well, as I never really cared   for anyone(not even myself)but my business. Though I am very rich, I   was never generous,I was always hostile to people and only focused on   my business as that was the only thing I cared for. But now I regret   all this as I now know that there is more to life than just wanting to   have or make all the money in the world.   I believe when God gives me a second chance to come to this world I   would live my life a different way from how I have lived it. Now that   God has called me, I have willed and given most of my property and   assets to my immediate and extended family member as well as a few   close friends.   I want God to be merciful to me and accept my soul so, I have decided   to give also to charity organizations, as I want this to be one of the   last good deeds I do on earth. So far, I have distributed money to some   charity organizations in the U.A.E, Algeria and Malaysia. Now that my   health has deteriorated so badly, I cannot do this myself anymore.   I once asked members of my family to close one of my accounts and   distribute the money which I have there to charity organization in   Bulgaria and Pakistan,they refused and kept the money to themselves.   Hence, I do not trust them anymore, as they seem not to be contended   with what I have left for them.   The last of my money which no one knows of is the huge cash deposit of   Eighteen Million Dollars $18,000,000,00 in side two boxes that I have   with a Finance/Security Company Abroad. I will want you to Act as my   Beneficiary who will help me contact the security finance company on my   behalf to discuss the terms and condition of getting this deposit out   from thier custody and also helping me to dispatch it to the charity   organisations   Reply to this email with your full names,contact address,tel number and   fax to enable me ask my doctors lawyer to arrange for you a power of   attorney that will give you full legal backing as my beneficiary   Kindly get back to me with trust and sincerity that you will help me on   this regards.      I have set aside 30% for you and for your time."      Is this just a scam? or is it real?
20090202145159AAclmMp	Business & Finance;Careers & Employment;Technology	Computer science degree - what can I do besides programming?	I'm about to graduate with a Bachelor's in Computer Science. I should be trying to find a job but I'm not because I don't feel motivated by most of the jobs out there. Actually I'm OK with programming but only the higher level stuff. I'm not really interested in tracing stack pointers or implementing some Unix system call, if you see what I mean. I don't feel like I really like "tech culture". If you asked me in high school, I'd probably say I want to be a computer geek, but after 5 years of university I don't feel like getting into a discussion about why Vi is better than Emacs or whatever. I also struggle with systems and am afraid of the programming assignments in things like networks, security, distributed systems even though most people think these things are easy.       Some possibilities I thought of were:   - Try to make use of my math skills. Actually my degree will be a "Bachelor's of Mathematics", but I haven't taken anything particularly challenging in math. I tried to take a computational finance course this term and I chickened out because of the stats. But I usually find math more elegant than CS - within CS I like stuff like algorithms, logic, etc.   - Try to find something that's more on the business/management side, maybe apply for an MBA school, but I've never taken any business courses in university.

20090202145315AA3yOqa	Business & Finance;Personal Finance	If I close my checking account, can LA Fitness still get money from me? Will they screw up my credit?	I currently belong to LA fitness and the monthly membership fee is deducted directly from my checking account, however I want to cancel my membership because I am moving. We will be living in a high-rise condo complex that has its own gym & pool so I have no need to belong to any health club. I went to the front desk at my local club to tell them I wanted to cancel, and after a lot of questions on their part and a lot of explaining on my part (the tried to retain me) the manager handed me a cancellation from. He told me that I had to mail the form to the corporate office in California and that it could take up to 60 days for my membership to be canceled. He went on to tell me that I should send the form via certified mail otherwise it might get lost (how convenient). So this means I will be billed for at least two more months after I have moved. Per their instructions, I have sent the form to California via certified mail (but not before making a few photocopies).   I was wondering, now that I have sent the form, if I could stop them from billing me by closing my checking account and switching to another bank. Will they still try to come after me for those last couple months? Will they send it to collections and screw up my credit? (Im not all that concerned about my credit score at the moment anyway because we just bought the condo and I bought a new car a few months ago). I never signed an actual contract, so I dont think they can sue me.   Any ideas?

I have been working at a grocery store meat department since June 2008, and I did not like the job at all. I put up with it for a long time but I could not take anymore and began to look for opportunities elsewhere. I now have two interviews set up in place where I am excited to work, and it is likely I will get a job offer.       The problem is, my boss is known to scream and is known to speak his mind. I am afraid that if I quit, he will snap at me and take a bite out of me. Another reason I am wary is that one of the employees went on a trip until mid-March, and if I leave, I am afraid I may screw over the department. I will give him two weeks notice if I get one of the jobs, but that will take me to late february to early march.        I really hate my job, and I really want to quit. How do I approach my boss on quitting, and how do I do it?

20090202152533AAEH8ZG	Business & Finance;Credit	Credit score dropped 51 pts in 1 month...WHY?	We got out of debt 2 yrs ago and have been on the road to repair since them.  We bought a house and when we checked out score in Jan. it was 669.  It said we needed more revolving credit so we decided to get one more Credit card (we now have 2 total) we have a loan, car, and house, plus the 2 card all in good standing.  One of my cradit cards came with a automatic Experian score update monthly.  It has been on the rise for the last 9 months (since I got the card) it has gone up between 1 and 10 pts every months.  Well I checked it today for the month of Jan. and it has dropped 51 pts!!!!  No late payments, nothing.  The only difference is that its a new year and we opened our new credit card account, but the 1 st payment isnt even due yet!  I'm so confused....Why would it drop lke that?????
20090202152638AAwtpzf	Business & Finance;Renting & Real Estate	Should I apply for foreclosure?	This week, I know for sure that we won't be able to pay our monthly mortgage for the first time.  My husband has been laid off for almost 6 months now and we have used up all of our resources.  Used our credit card to pay some bills, buy groceries, and everything else.  It's so hard especially that we have a 7 month old baby.  I tried to refinance my condo with multiple banks and even online(Quicken Loans) and we have been denied because we don't have enough source of income.  My credit score as of today is 679 and have never been late with anything but all of our credit cards have been maxxed out.  We have about 30k in CC debt.  Can anyone give us some advice on what to do?  I'm thinking of foreclosure and just move to an apartment.  We don't want to do any loan modifications. I'm willing to give the condo up but in the future, I would still want to finally get a nice house of our own.  We're trying each day to be optimistic but things are getting out of hand lately.   I would appreciate your suggestions.

My Father died in turkey due to a heart attack and he told me before he died that the will is under my name,the will is for 65,000 dollars.I am a nurse/U.S. citizen and never been to turkey and I never met my fathers family members but,I recently called my fathers brother in turkey to get a hold on my father because I did not have contact with my father in many months and the brother told me he died 3 months ago from a heart attack and they buried him.Now,my fathers brothers say in a letter that they will join together, all 3 of them ,to get my FATHERS DOCUMENTS to have the will devolved to me.I was supposed to go to turkey next week but,the brothers told me dont woory you dont have to come because it takes 3 to 4 months for the brothers  to get the right documents and they then will soon after wire the money to me.Should I trust them because my father before had to loan his brothers thousands of dollars  for all sorts of reasons. They also told me at the end of the letter that  THEIR IS  ONLY ONE WAY TO GET THE MONEY AND IT IS THROUGH US/ MY FATHERS BROTHERS. Whoever is reading this can you please tell me what to do to get  all the money for ME AND MY WIFE.I suggest maybe talking with the turkish embassy or hiring a lawyer in america or turkey,I dont know  but, should I continue next week to go to turkey to handle the matters by myself or with a turkish lawyer in turkey with my appropriate documents to the turkish embassy.WHAT SHOULD I DO?

Together we made some big mistakes...bought a new truck, etc.      Now we owe up to our necks in payments and are barely making the monthly payments.      For a while, I was paying the bills, and had no trouble. But my husband somehow talked me into letting him control the bills and finances, and since that has happened, we have had a bounced check, missed payments, late fees, and on top of that, he ordered himself another credit card and opened another loan without talking to me about it.      He is succeeding to get us further into debt, and still continues to make the minimum payments.      Just now, I saw his bank statement, which says he is $292 late on a loan payment. I called him up to ask him when he would be home so we could talk about it, and he swears the loan was paid. Then he hung up on me.      I have tried to regain control of the finances, since I am better at it and have NEVER missed a payment or bounced a check, but he SEVERELY RESISTS...saying that he feels like a failure if he were to give up on it.      I cant do this anymore...I cant even talk to him about money without him getting mad and clamming up. I dont want to be in debt forever, and I dont feel like he is actively helping us out.      Any advice, suggestions??

Where I work I'm admin assistant/receptionist and been with the company for 3 1/2 years so far. I'm hourly and so is "Jim". When "Jim" goes to lunch or is out of the office I am required by our boss to transfer his extension to mine and do his job in addition to mine. According to the boss the phones are not ever supposed to be left unattended for any reason (yes there is a voicemail system in place). A few days ago "Jim" went to lunch and as soon as he returned he was sent out on company errands by someone else. Well, the phones weren't ringing and there were other people in the office so I went to grab a bite to eat. When I got back "Jim" informed me that the boss was extremely pissed off because noone was answering the phone. I told "Jim"..."I was at lunch. What am I supposed to do...work thru lunch and not get paid for it??" (The timeclock automatically deducts 1hr for lunch if there is no recorded punchout time for it) Anyway...the boss told "Jim" to get our lunches worked out and "Jim" told me he isn't changing his lunchtime. I already know if I go to the boss or HR I'll be seen as a complainer/whiner because the boss left the decision to "Jim" who has only been with the company for 1 1/2 years. Any ideas? Do I just suck it up and work thru lunch unpaid like I've been doing?

20090202161804AAVe4G1	Business & Finance;Renting & Real Estate	Question about paying rent and compensation for having to show the house...?	I am at a loss with this...we are living in a house that we we were going to lease option.  The landlords decided to put kind of a shakedown on us after we were in the home for barely 2 months stating that they wanted us to pay them $7000 for a use the lease option (this was never ever mentioned at the beginning of the lease).  We decided to put it off as we knew it didn't seem reasonable.  Shortly after this, maybe a month or so, our landlords came back at us stating that they wanted $14,000 for the lease option or they would put the house up for sale.  Again, we declined...just because we knew they were doing this purely for money's sake.  So they put the house on the market, while we're still paying rent on time, always, and put a sign in the yard and a lockbox on the door.  We have had to live with real estate agents showing people the house several times a week, me having to keep the home perfect for these showings, having to leave when people come through, etc., etc.  The house has just sold, thanks to me showing the home alone when the real estate agent wasn't available...that's another story.  Anyway, so I decided that because of this inconv. and invasion of quiet enjoyment of property that I would only pay half of the last month's rent, which is this month.  I am considering doing it this way...I paid half the rent and will pay the other half under the condition that my full security deposit is returned to me.  When I receive that condition in writing, then I will pay the remaining amount.  We figured that they would try and keep our security deposit too (they are those kind of people).  What do you think?  I am so so angry at this situation that I really want to see some justice done.  What would you advise?

Next day I went to Best Buy, talked to the manger and customer service senior.

I just started my first job a couple of months ago and have not saved a large amount so far as I have been paying off student loans.  I had always hoped to work and rent for quite a while as I would like to be able to buy my cousin's house when he moves.  Well last night I found out that the plan is to be moving in approximately two years.  Not wanting to give up this chance to own the house, I am trying to figure out whether it would even be possible.      I currently make about 56,000$ before taxes.  I would figure that the house will sell for about 600K and I am wondering what the downpayment would generally be on that.  I have at least two years to save up for this and could always get a roommate when I moved in.  I have loved this house for over 20 years, I don't want to give up the chance to have it.      Does anyone know whether I am being realistic at all or whether I should just give up.  Or know around how much a downpayment would be?  Thanks!
