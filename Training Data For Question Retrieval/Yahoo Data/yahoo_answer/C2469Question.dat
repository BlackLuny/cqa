20090306160138AASvrJD	Arts & Humanities;Poetry	What do you think about this poem?	Imprisonment      Granite walls were built around him   To save him, protect him from those   Who wished evil on him   They would destroy him    If he left the safety of confinement   He often looked at the walls around him   With hateful eyes   They made no sense   He felt entrapped not safe   There were so many rules   He dared not disobey   Complications everywhere   There was no one to speak to in his prison   No one to comfort him   No one to even look at   He often wondered what existed beyond the familiar bars   He lived in a shroud of darkness   He never smiled   One day he managed to look beyond the walls   He smelled the sunflowers in the fields   He felt the cool water from the lake on his skin   He saw children playing on the shore   And building sandcastles   Could a paradise like this really exist?   Laughter   Bliss   Love   Freedom   Things he had not know   They seemed strange yet    They brought peace to him   All he had learnt was to protect himself   No intruders   No visitors   No onlookers   It did not balance in his mind   Then a child approached him   Her smile was inviting   And angelic   He knew what he had to do   As he reached forward and took the child’s hand   The walls of his prison collapsed   He smiled   He found what he was searching for   The next morning his lifeless body   Was found on the ground   But there was something different about his face   It bore the marks of peace   And a smile chiselled in perfection   They could imprison the body   But never the mind   The mind is free and will claim   Its freedom.
20090306160458AAxaYzR	Arts & Humanities;Poetry	Would you like to offer comments on this?	Liquid pools of sapphire blue   diamonds peaked upon it’s waves   fathomless depths, uncaptured hues    not at all how eyes behave.        Each twinkle is a memory,    but day by day they threaten leave   hearts broke in perfect symmetry    I can’t be sure. I crave belief       It broke her when those diamonds turned    to common glass beneath your lids   a lesson prematurely learned    God's grace? It had no part in this.        And where’s my part amongst the cracks?   (Make sure I keep my footing here.)   A you-shaped whole in my heart lacks   a substance not comprised of tears.      I hate those briny orbs of soul   burning flesh to join their kin,   collecting in that gaping hole,   the void that festers from within.       And as time goes I feel it more   your bear-like hugs cannot contest   I reminisce with feelings flawed   eroded by my acid chest.      I don’t want to feel this rotten core.   I welcome anger's rough caress   it barges through the open door   to swamp and choke my grief’s unrest.       Don’t hate my innate flood of what   I know keeps your face in my mind   it may be this is all I've got   I failed with faith, but God…       … I tried

She watches the arts channel whenever I will let her to see the dancers, tries her best to imitate them, and wants to be a ballerina when she grows up.  I was thinking about letting her start classes in a few months - maybe when she's around 3 1/2 or so.  But I don't even know where to start.  Any suggestions on how to choose a good school for a beginner, for someone who knows NOTHING about ballet?  I want something that will encourage her, but not a hardcore school that will push her so hard she doesn't like it anymore.  What should I look for in a good ballet school?

I am looking for real critique (not on grammar really).      The beer bottle swung over my head missing my face by inches. I felt a sob escape my chest.    “Dad! Stop it you are going to hurt me!” I cried out.    He laughed manically “That is the point isn’t it?” He said swinging the bottle past my face once more. He missed once more.    “Mom!” I screamed hoping she would come. I dashed to the corner of the room crouching down, my face towards the wall. Loud, booming steps running towards me. A dark laugh chuckled from behind me before I felt the oozing pain hit my back. My stomach lurched as I fell over crying, the pain unreal it was so horrible.     I turned my head seeing my dad no longer there but my mom running towards me. I cried louder and held my arms out towards her. She kept running but did not move.     “Mom!” I cried out again “Run faster! Don’t leave me here with dad!” I bawled, tears mixing with the blood pooling around my face.    She ran, but just fell behind until I could not see her.     “No!” I screamed.    “Cal? Cal?” I heard my name screamed.    “Mom? Mom?” I screamed. I felt my body shake fiercely.    “Cal! Cal! Caleb! Caleb” I heard my name screamed. My eyes opened as my cousin shook me in my bed. Fresh tears stained trickled out of my eyes. I sobbed as my cousin held me against her chest.     “What nightmare was it this time Cal?” She asked me.    “The one about Mom and Dad.” I said breathless.    She held me closer “Cal, everything is Okay. It is a new home, a new school, a lot of stress. Please do not worry, I am here for you Okay?” She cooed.    I nodded, and lie back down in bed. She put her hand on my forehead and smoothed back my thick brown hair and walked away.     I watched the door close until she is finally gone “Damn it!” I cursed into my pillow. I was fourteen, and still I woke up crying. Truly who could blame me though, I had to watch my own mother’s death.

20090306163338AAfAnWB	Arts & Humanities;Books & Authors	Writers can you help me out? I'm confused? Flat characters?	So I'm taking a course on fictional writing and I'm confused.       What is confusing me is this:       "Flat characters have few traits, all of them predictable, none creating   genuine conflicts. Flat characters often boil down to stereotypes: fat,   doughnut-eating cop; forgetful professor; lecherous truck driver; jovial   fatso; shifty-eyed thief; anorexic model. Using these prefab characters   can give your prose a semblance of humor and quickness, but your story   featuring them will have about as much chance of winning a contest as a   prefab apartment in a competition of architects. Even more damaging,   you will sound like a bigot. As a writer you ought to aspire toward   understanding the varieties of human experiences, and bigotry simply   means shutting out and insulting a segment of population (and their   experiences) by reducing them to flat types."      So are they saying not to use words like: fat,   doughnut-eating cop; forgetful professor; lecherous truck driver; jovial   fatso; shifty-eyed thief; anorexic model...ect?      I go back after reading that to do an assignment. They want me to take one of those stereotypes and use it in a brief scene. If it makes me look like a bigot, why would I use one of those stereotypes?      I'm so confused!

What are your thoughts/feelings/harshness on this one?   thanks!      The Enchantment of the Night      Have you ever walked in the midst of the dark?   Do you know the enchantment of this different world?      The bright summer stars,   Wink at me,   Almost as though they are flirting with me,      I look up to them,   As a nightingale sings sweetly to its lover,      The bright, glowing moon, illuminates the earth below,      I look around in the garden and see,   Deep, plump grapes, just as purple as can be      Green ivory reaches up to what now is gone,   Decorating my palace elegantly and whole,      The aroma is peaceful and full,   As the dew perches on the sweet roses tips,      The lake sparkles like the stars up above,   Creating none other than a mid night dream      The fields rise and fall,   As the wind gently flows over its long, mangled mane,      The tree branches sway,   As they rock softly to and fro,      Yes, welcome to the Enchantment of the night

20090306163337AACbUR7	Arts & Humanities;Books & Authors	Do you like this fight between friends?	I just wanted to know if you like this fight. If you thought it was believeable. But before you read I have to tell you whats going on. Savanna is having a party at her house and had promised Alicia that they would hang out. But as soon as the party started Savanna ditched Alicia to hang out with her boyfriend. That's the story. Please tell me if you like it. Also, not to much harsh comments. Thank you. I also know that there is grammar and spelling mistakes.      Claire had got me to go out on the dance floor with her to dance. She was overly drunk. By now, she had shed her small little blue jacket that she was wearing earlier, and now all she was in was a white tank top, shorts and socks. She had another beer in her hand and was acting more crazier then usually. I hadn't saw the gorgeous guy for a while. But it still had me questioning things. Why was he here? Was he really smiling at me? Did he know me or something?       Claire and I was talking about the song that they were currently playing, "Shake It" by Metro Station, when Savanna walked over to me.       "Hey chica, what's up?" She said with a smile on her face.       I was so not falling for this.       "What the hell is wrong with you?" I asked her not caring if I really told her how I felt.       Her face dropped that smile as she strutted, "Uh... What are you talking about?"       "You know perfectly damn well what I am talking about."       Claire gave me an annoyed look on her face as she put one hand on her hip and turned her head to the side, "Oh, well apparently Alicia is just having the worst time of her life at this party and she is mad at you, Savanna, because you won't spend every single second with her."       She was staring right at me. Why did Claire always have to be on Savanna's side and gang up against me. Would it hurt her once to agree with me?       Savanna looked at me with her eyes big and finally said, "What is she talking about Alicia?"       I looked the other way, wishing I could have this conversation in private and not as a public show on a dance floor. But then I remembered that I started so I might as well finish it.       "Okay, Savanna I'm just going to tell you the truth. You told me that you would hang out with me a lot tonight and we would have fun. But no, that can't happen you have to be off with Trace the jerk face every second." It finally felt good to get it out in the open, no matter how Savanna felt.       Now Savanna had annoyed look on her face. "Well you know what Alicia? You are not the perfect friend either. You're always negative all the time and I can't be around with you all the time to hold your hand. And what is your problem with Trace? If you were as good as a friend as I thought you were then you would be happy for me. Not telling me every second that my boyfriend sucks."       That's when Claire started in on me, "Yeah Alicia, you're not all that fun to be with. I always have to hear you complain about what Savanna has done and how Trace is just completely evil. It was okay at first, but now you have reached you're limit. I'm getting tired of this crap with you. And Savanna is right, you are always negative all the time. You don't ever crack a smile or do anything but mope around about how boring my little life is and how my best friend is going out with Trace the jerk face." She smiled when she was finished and then added, "That is a gay nickname, you know."       "Well at least I'm not a **** and with a different guy every other day." I said, it was the only thing that I could think to say. This had really stung.       "At least I'm not a *****!" Claire screamed at me.       I turned my head to the side. I bit my lip. I was so not going to cry. I will not cry in front of them.       "Come on Savanna, let's get away from her. Who wants to be friends with a negative ***** all the time?" Claire said and grabbed Savanna's arm.       Savanna laughed with Claire and added, "Totally."       There I was all alone. Alone. In the middle of the dance floor. I didn't have friends anymore or anyone. I hated myself. I hated for what I had done to them. I felt a tear starting to run down my cheek. I turned and started running, putting my hand up to my face trying to cover myself up. I didn't know where I was going, but I had to get out of here.

Could be books, food, animal, etc.        e.g., I need Catcher, like a cake needs batter.    ^ yeah, that was lame, but you get the idea. Right? It doesn't have to rhyme, but it would be way cooler if it did.

20090306182119AALwOI3	Arts & Humanities;Books & Authors	I'm Writing A Story And Need Help?	I'm writing a story and I'm kind of stuck. It's about a princess and her kingdom is attacked by a mysterious tribe of warrior people, when she was very young. Her mother is supposedly taken and killed in the raid and now she is fourteen. Her name is Tessandra, Tess for short, and she no longer wants to be a princess. At one point in the story she says she wants to be what killed her mother, she wants to become a warrior. I am at the part where she goes off alone in the woods to train herself to be a warrior, instead of tending to her royal duties. This is where I'm stuck. I was thinking of having the tribe of warriors come and steal her while she is training and take her back to their lands, far away, but I wasn't sure if there was some other way I could go? Any ideas? Anything else I should add to the story?

I was stretching over a month ago, working hard on my straddle stretch (where you sit on the ground, spread your legs, and reach forward).  The next day I had intense pain in my right hip, and it was really stiff.  It's been over a month and it still hasn't gone away.  When ever I try to do stretches on my right side I'm stopped by pain and my flexibility is greatly reduced from the pain.  Also, it's only stretches that use your hip flexers. I've tried googling what I can do to get rid of it, and all I can find just really doesn't fit my symptoms.  It's really getting in the way of my dancing.

It was a picture i had to write about, it had seven soldiers in it.         Standing on the gravel   with our feet faced forward   Seven soldiers faced down praying to the Lord.   Hands clasp together, tears flowing down.   Thinking about the future or if it ends now.      The clear blue sky looking down    becoming black by the hatred between us.   As the jets fly above us   make everything better.   Showing us our country is strong.      As the sky is clearing once again   I’m standing here thinking about     my life passing by, thinking of my victory    going right by my eyes.    I look down at the red water flowing   knowing it’s my time.       I gave it my all as I am laying here.   My hand on my heart as I clasp my memories   knowing it’s not over.   As I am floating to the better place,    I saved another and my Country.      When laying here with my feet   faced forward with my hands together   thinking why did it end now.

20090306220352AAXhg34	Arts & Humanities;Philosophy	Why criticize ontological arguments that create circularity?	You know the types of ontological arguments Im referring to.  Someone argued that "God exists" because God is perfect by definition and existence is better than non-existence... and so if God didnt exist then he'd be imperfect...      Why should arguments such as these be ridiculed?      It seems to me that we use them all the time in other, more "rational" realms of reasoning, and they arent regarded as fallacious then...      In physics' M-theory, we arbitrarily create more and more "universes"... just to fit them into the equations that we use... the numbers work better so we think more universes exist. But we dont question the fundamental science itself... we only appreciate the consistency we generate.  And without answering any questions, without simplification or complication, we merely add more of the same... and infinitely many at that... (Occam's Razor, but that is a different issue).      In mathematics, the proof that the square root of two is an irrational number involves positing a premise, reductio ad absurtum, and finally a contradiction.... and we call it good.      It seems to me that all these take arbitrary definitions given to abstract concepts, and each involve a circular / redundant reduction to absurdity.      In math and science its called logical and in theology its called a fallacy.

20090306213935AAkyPrY	Arts & Humanities;Poetry	Do any other relatively new poets have this problem?	My mind will not allow me to write poems without some kind of rhyme. I have all sorts, and am working on one that only has internal rhyme, but if it doesn't rhyme, I can't write it. I don't think this is all bad, because I enjoy this, I see it kind of like a puzzle, to get the words to rhyme and still say what I want or feel, but still... I am kind of worried that I do not have the capability to write free verse or anything like that.      Also I am relatively good at it, or so I've been told. It took me about 10 minutes to write this, been writing poetry for around 6 weeks.      Anxious waiting evermore,   as we're rising from the floor.   Will we fall or will we fly?   Will we soar or will we die?

20090306215402AASgLWD	Arts & Humanities;Books & Authors	Comment my first chapter part four?	finally>>>>>            I couldn’t help but jump away. I’m not really good at dealing with… closeness.    “Thanks, but no thanks. I don’t have time for this.” I said matter-of-factly.    “Are you sure? Because, if you allow me, I can give you all the time in the world.” He said with a sly smile.    “What do you mean by that?” I didn’t quite like his tone of voice, but I couldn’t help that I was intrigued. Well, that and his eyes were even more effective when paired with the moonlight.    “Here, I’ll show you.” As he spoke the last word, he closed his eyes. He seemed to be concentrating really hard. The air around him seemed to get warmer and it seemed as if he was glowing. This was a little creepy to say in the least. I started to back away from him.    “No, stay close!” The voice came from nowhere. I looked at him and just as I thought his lips were sealed. Besides, the voice was deep and way too rough to be his. The air around me seemed suffocating somehow. It was not uncomfortable, but it was not natural either. His hair whipped about furiously, though there seemed to be little wind. Then, his eyes popped open.    “There!” He said triumphantly. “Now we have as much time as you’d like.”    “What are you talking about?”    “Look around. Do you see any movement?”   I did as he said. There seemed to be no movement at all anywhere. Even the bodies were not twitching in the least. The little wind there was before ceased to exist. The clouds froze in their tracks across the night sky.  What the heck? I didn’t know magicians could do this and what’s more is that I didn’t see him utter a word. This was truly amazing.    “From the look on your face, can I infer that you are ready to talk with me?” He smiled a nice warm smile. It was comforting.    “What is it you want?” I asked hesitantly. These types of people could not be trusted.  A person who is obviously above me and talks to me in such a kind manner is not something I see every day. No one is this nice to a delinquent. He had to have some ulterior motive.      “Well, I can get rid of all the mess you’ve made, if you agree to aid me in my ….for lack of a better word project.”    “What is this project? And what do I have to do with it?”    “I could use your magical expertise” I couldn’t help but laugh at that. He looked at me with a confused face. “What’s wrong?” he sounded genuinely concerned.   “Tell me what you really want or I will not listen to anymore of your lies.”   “What? I’m offering you a way out of this. A means of freedom. Surely you’re not so dumb as to pass this up?”  How rude was this guy? Did he actually insult me, the person he wants help from? I mean, he said it nice, but that only made me feel even worse. Like he was being sarcastic.  My hands twitched to knock him out. I hated being called dumb, even if it is somewhat true.    “Well, I have always been behind in schoolwork. I guess I am dumb. So I guess I’m just too simple minded to help you with whatever ‘project’ you are attempting!” I folded my arms tightly, trying to hide a little of my fury.    “I’m sorry, I was misunderstood. Forgive me. I’m just saying you have a better chance at freedom by working for me.”    “You’re not offering me freedom! You want something in return and I don’t have time to help out needy people!”     “Listen little girl. I will offer you this one more time. If you say no then there is nothing I will do to help you.”    “Well, then my answer is no!” I said with all the defiance I could muster up. Little girl? Well, he would get no help from this little girl. My stance seemed to falter a little as my knees bent weakly. My condition was slowly deteriorating.     “Then you truly are stupid.”    His soft yet bitter words lingered in my ears. Then, with one snap of his fingers, motion returned. The wind caught me off guard. I stumbled backward and landed on my bottom. As I tried to pick myself up, I noticed how heavy my body seemed. Had I gained weight? I struggled a little while longer. I was only ever able to get about 3 inches from the ground. This was futile!!! As I fumed over this, I noticed movement out of the corner of my eye. I turned my head. Oh man, it was an android. One android had obviously made it. Probably used people as its shield. I struggled harder to get up. I looked for the magician, too. Where was he?    “Hey! Come here, help me up.”    “You don’t need my help.” There was no trace of sympathy in his voice.    “So you’re just going to watch it kill me?”    “No...” he turned, looking down at me, “… it’s just going to knock you out and take you to the station.” That pissed me off.    “I know you’re mad, but this is ridiculous! Just help me get up and I will be out of your way.”    “Ridiculous? You mean, like slaughtering the lives of innocent people on the streets like you did?” The look in his eyes was a cold one, indifferent.  I didn’t need this guy’s help! As I began to feel overcome with hatred and my weakness spread throughout me, the tears I had tried so hard to keep hidden i

The decisions and conclusions anyone can make up will provide a false sense of understanding and contentment. A physiological and poignant trick one will play on his or herself to bear the possibilities of how it may actually be. The cause, the purpose, the explanation and the justification- all of the options you can settle your head on. No need for truth if there’s room for a flight of fancy. Besides, at one point all the steps will fade away, anyway.       what do you think?

20090306212935AAfb4gt	Arts & Humanities;Other - Arts & Humanities	May a new race be born.............. Kearomye!?	You've got to be kidding me. I know the properties of the human soul and manipulate and alter them, by using the powers of other side. It has nothing to do with drugs or nazis. There are rules even the devil must follow just as there are rules and limitations God set for himself. Have you ever wondered how God does not get bored or need rest?  I know too much but I can make so much use of it. Souls can be fragmented, they also have the ability to rejuvenate like flesh. If you could sell a small fraction of your soul, it would grow back within time. The soul also has the ability to  replicate a smaller version of it's self for the hearts of those you've come in contact with. Sometimes this smaller version can boost someone's strength enough to lift a bus. Love is the most powerful force, without it this world would not have sustained it's self for this long. Some spirits are trapped on the other side and can only come out with the permission of someone on this side. You do know of the powers a poltergeist has, don't you?   There is a way of stealing their powers, I know how.   A contract must be written on blessed paper with blessed ink (that way they can not alter what it says). Invite them to this side in return, you get their power or have them do your bidding. Part of their "curse" is that they must follow through with conditions if let out. You'd need an Ouija board to do this. Are you willing to join my group who is working on this?

I read this book in the late 70's, early 80's about a college student who writes a program described as a search worm type program which goes out into the Internet/ARPAnet and later contacts the student when it becomes self aware and intelligent.  I'd love to know the name of the book and/or author.

I dont want a pure rap song, I need a song with a melody and a good beat. Not too fast though. I considered "Elevator" by Flo Rida and Timbaland. But it seems too fast.   Perhaps something with a violin in the backround or whatever, as long as it has a nice beat that is easy to dance to. I will appreciate it!   Thank You So Very Much!
20090306212003AArFhK6	Arts & Humanities;Books & Authors	Is this a good start to my story?	Ok, so here is the first chapter and prologue a novel I am trying to write. Is this good, and what do you suggest to make it better? Sorry, its kinda long.      Prologue       "Revenge. What a sweet taste." Amie thought as she held her newly acquired sword in hand. She couldn’t go on anymore. Her family was gone. Her home was gone. She would go into an orphanage if she was found. Torn away from her land she loved. She could at least do this one thing for her aunt and uncle. For all the people who died. She could kill the one who killed them.    She closed her eyes and, for a moment, she could almost see the event unfolding. Her uncle sitting at the front desk, checking someone in. Her aunt instructing the chefs on a special dinner for her and her team. Her teenage cousin showing off to the girls in the lobby. Her baby cousin sleeping peacefully in his crib. Everything going like a normal day.    Then, suddenly a big explosion coming from the basement. Debris flying everywhere as people died of the falling rubble, intense heat, or burned to death. The horrible screams of pain all around as each one died a terrible death.    She shook her head, trying to get rid of the awful thoughts. Concentrate she told herself. Stick to the plan. She took a deep breath and listened. Everywhere in the building, guards were fighting off animals everywhere, two to each guard.    Amie smiled a dark smile. With the guards distracted with fighting the animals, they wouldn’t be able to come after and stop her. Her bright green eyes turned dark green as dark thoughts of her kill was absorbed into her body. She reached out, arm extending to the door. She took the door knob, twisted it, and opened the door.    "Soon, very soon, I will have my revenge."      Chapter 1: Amie       Amelia Kemen stood in place and stared at the setting around her. She was in what looked like a valley she never saw before. Green grass covered it. In the center, there was a pool. The water shimmered with the light from the stars and the full moon. All around her were many wolves. They were howling but the howls seemed to come together in a melody of joyous accord. Almost as if they were singing. She approached the small pool and stood at the end next to another wolf who, somehow to her, seemed familiar. She looked up at the moon. Suddenly a ray of moonlight showered opon her. All she could see was a ray of bright light which took shape into the form of another wolf. Then she heard an odd buzzing noise.       The buzzing noise, Amie’s alarm clock, woke her up. As she turned off the alarm, she saw that it was 5:00 am . Amie groaned. She was exhausted from her restless night. She hadn’t had a good night’s sleep for two weeks now. Every night, the dreams were always the same. It always ended when she saw the mysterious wolf and the alarm went off.    She had to get moving.. Amie had much to do before the sun rose. She had to go to the stables and take the horses out to the meadow. Then she had to meet her aunt at the restaurant and do some cooking. She’d have some free time around noon to three o’ clock where she would hang out with friends. Then she’d work the rest of the afternoon for the dinner shift. This is what she did every day when there wasn’t school. Her Aunt Eliza and Uncle John had three things that were the most important to them, their ranch, their faith, and their two sons, Joseph and Joshua. Sometimes, she felt like to them, she was a failure. That she was always second best to them. She never knew what she ever did wrong.   Maybe it was because of her looks. She was quite skimpy for her age, 11. She was one of the shortest kids in her class. She had dull brown-blonde hair and her face had some hard edges. The only beautiful part of her was her bright green eyes. This was what she was thinking as she got up and looked at herself in the mirror.    She took off the shirt she slept in. Disappointment took her when she saw that her breasts hadn’t shown up yet. Already at least five of the 14 girls in her class had gained breasts. Some of them even had periods, or so the rumors said. She sighed. The day was April 8th. Her 11th birthday was in 7 days, just before the end of spring break was over. The only thing she wanted was breasts because she knew if she had them, she’d be one of the more popular girls in school instead of one of the nerdy girls. No, she wasn’t nerdy, not pretty, not even a skater girl, or goth. She didn’t belong anywhere in the school. She only had two friends in the school. Nothing went right for her.   Amie put on a plain white t shirt and some jeans, then headed out the door of her room. Actually, it was more of a cabin and a suite rather than a room. Because there were no girls in her family besides Eliza, she got the cabin-suite to herself.    The main building of the ranch was about 3 stories tall made of grey bricks. In the outside was a grand driveway with a garden in the middle. There were already flowers that were blooming, but they were

20090306214651AA8F0Su	Arts & Humanities;Books & Authors	I can't remember this book? It's about a girl who moves to a new house or something?	Actually, I do not remember a lot. I remember a few details in the book here and there. But, I do remember that is was also a movie on Lifetime a while ago. However, the book was published first.       All I remember from the book is in the beginning, the girl (who I think lost her mother?) And I remember in the beginning of the book the narrator was talking about how she was moving to a new house and I remember something behind mentioned about a green colored house.       The main characters name was Hollie (I think). She moves to live with this old woman who is a painter. Overtime, the old woman starts losing her memory. And at the end the main character, Hollie, (?) ends up staying with this family that adopts her.       Sorry if I wasn't that descriptive but does anyone know what book this is? Any help is appreciated. I really want to read this book again and if anyone can find it I will be very grateful!
20090306215839AAlvtmY	Arts & Humanities;Books & Authors	Questions On Getting My Book Published?	I've read some articles about how to get your book published.   I know that you have to get an agent interest and such, but I have somethings that I'm not clear on.   1- Do agents provide a editor, or do you have to hire one yourself?   2- Can you choose your Publisher, or does the agent have a Publisher for their entire agency?   3- Only scamming agents ask for money up front, right? Unless it's vanity publishing.   4- Could someone give me a website to double check agent Andrea Somberg? I know my mom did her research, but she repels technology, so I don't know if she did something wrong.      Thanks for your time.   -Courtney

20090307010037AAFDP4l	Arts & Humanities;Books & Authors	What do you think of my poem?	I haven't seen her in awhile, but we still stay in touch.      She makes me happy, and I cant thank her enough.      As her happiness begins to fade, I can help but want to help.      Why can't I help?      Why are my prayers not working for her?      Why her?      why not me? surley I would trade places if possible.      Because as she begins to break I do too.      I feel her pain, and she feels mine.      We have been like this forever.      and swore to never change,      As her luck begins to shift, I am overwlemed with joy.      Finally my friend will be happy, but to be mistaken was what I was.      She must move again, for her mother health.      She said they are not good in weath there anyway.      I cant belive whats happening.      Why are these prayers not working?      Why cant I help her like she does for me?      Why her?      Oh god please make it be me!      I would do anything for her, everything.      Why cant I, I would sacrafice everything, even myself.      But the problem of that is a secret hidden under blankets of insanity.      We made a promise, a oath, a swear.      If one is to die, than the other is to follow soon after, because heaven would not even be close to our friendship.      Insanity? yes      Foolish? Indeed.      true? Anyday, anytime. Every hour of every breath I take. This will be true.      So if to find a friendship so strong, and a person so great.      why her?

As I lay in bed,    Restless from a chill,   I am dreaming of summer…      When hot days melt into hotter nights,   And the ceaseless spinning of the fan    Cools the beads of sweat into rivers    That glide down our glistening bodies.      Where the sun burns the parched land   That thirsts for a storm rumored in the distance   As children run through water sprinklers   Shrieking gleefully.      And if innocence is for the youth,   What shall we have in our old age?      Summer arrives.   The dreams are gone.   It was too soon.

In places like Europe and Russia there are a lot of straight male dancers because its more of a tradition over there. In the USA its not so, and dance is not often seen as a masculine pursuit, although sometimes it can be.      So what do you think it the ratio of gay to straight male dancers, about 70% to 30%?      I would like an answer from someone who is familiar or has worked in the dance profession.      Although some of you may be tempted to I'm not really looking for any comedic answers at this time, sorry to say.

I have modded it it use 35mm film.  The first roll I know I messed up on, it was over exposed thus it was blank.  However, I have read up and thought I covered my bases.  I've been very careful to load and unload film in complete dark, I've made sure to tape any place I might be getting light leeks, I've been sure to tape the end of my film securely and centered on the left hand spool, ect.  I found that when I ran my film down to Walgreen's for One Hour photo, they cropped the sprockets from my photo's and out of 24 exposures I only received about 6.  I realize Walgreen's isn't necessarily the ideal place to get my film developed but 'm not sure if I'm just missing something or if the problem actually lies with Walgreen's.

Then I got a new cord and tried it but no sound occurs. I know the amp and cords are fine (i bought 2 cords to be sure) because i also have another guitar that works fine with it.

Adrian, one of the masked villains sets up a plan to blow up half of New York to unite the Soviet Union and The United States to a common enemy. The nuclear talks between united states and the soviet union presented a threat to humanity.      Realistic? A borderline yes. It is too brutal and inhumane to be the best decision. I just wanted some feedback for alternate solutions. I don't disagree with the decision (only if it was the worst case scenario)... but I feel like there was another alternative without killing 3 million innocent people.

You've made me a pig; a boar. You've made me greedy and inconsistent. You've used me to use others and though you're too soft to leave, you're too uneasy to stick it out. Too uneasy to help uproot your planted seed. Useless as you are, our tree would have been beautiful. A clinic has removed your mistake and I've been too kind to worry your sick soul.   Keep still, tiny burdens. Burning my eyes, stinging my throat. My gluttony, half acidic already, is right before my eyes swimming in a filthy bowl. Dry skin, cracked lips, brittle nails and wet lashes. The overpowering smell of purge makes the sensation even more horrifying. The feeling of an empty stomach has suddenly transformed me into a beautiful sight to see.   Keep still, tiny burdens.I fend you away with a naked shield; new body belonging to a name unknown to me. Watch, tiny burdens. Watch as I satisfy a sick mind who believes I am gullible. Thigh on thigh; hand between legs; palms on breasts no connection, no communication. Only disrespect for a body fending away you, tiny burdens. Keep still..

My ancestor was born 1799/1800 in England, and served in the Royal Engineers (or Sappers and Miners as they were known then) as early as 1827 and was discharged in 1831 in Canada. He remained there, and was granted Crown land. So far, I have only found out his company number, commanding officer's name, and discharge date.

This poem or whatever you call it is dedicated to a child when he separated from his parents and joints a poster family.         Life in foster family      Joining the foster family, a new life begins   You don’t know what to expect next   But to hope for the best, thinking   How will I be treated?   How will I be cared for?   But assuming it as though being with mom      Giddy, got up in the morning, confused and embarrassed   Where am I?   But I hear an unfamiliar voice calling,   You are late for the school!   Got up quickly, and a bit nervous   Though not because of the school      For the first few days, you see the smile on her face   And slowly, this begins to disappear   As usual you sleep at night, and then the dream comes   A dream, when I was with mom and dad   For a while I find myself being with them   Laughing and having funs      Later, got up in a strange place, feel lost and lonely   Now, last night’s dreams stayed in mind   The whole day at school   And it continually stays for the next weeks, months and ever   I can’t rinse it away         As time passes on, people tell me, why I become quieter and less talkative   And I say this is the way I am   But they say no   This is the way you have become   But do I realize the difference?      Sometime I go out for shopping   And then I see people and things around   I see them holding their kids, them being with their parents   They laugh and busy in pleasure of life though,   They don’t notice me   For a while, I close my eyes and picture myself with mom and dad   And soon, the fate of life knocks me up      7. Now here that her moods keep changing   I can’t do anything I want   I am asking to myself why?   Am I a bad kid?   But I hear a voice says, it’s her house role         Sometime, you have something good and want tell her   When you go, you see a different face, telling you   You have not done this and that   And then soon you forget what you wanted to say   But, will mom ever understand this one day?         As usual I go to school, hoping   If, I ever meet mom again, so that one day I can make her proud   Though, sometime its fun and sometime boring, but to keep on going   As time passes on, got the exam results, though at present mom’s feeling could not be expressed   And to say ahh! Well done my son      Now says she, sit down you big boy   And learn how to live an independent life!   But, don’t I deserve some joy in life?   Now, that I have grown up, what has this life to give me back?   Happiness, my childhood or what?

20090307144421AAGCopG	Arts & Humanities;Philosophy	Topic for discussion.?	Lets say you drop a ball from a rooftop. The laws of physics say that the ball will fall with an acceleration of 9.91m/s^2. So every time you drop that ball, it will fall almost exactly the same way. Another example, lets say you have a simple electric circuit. In that circuit, it is possible to find current, voltage, resistance, and many other aspects of that circuit at all the different nodes and resistors, and whatever you happen to have in that circuit. So here is the question, since the human brain also runs on electric signals of some kind, what is the force, or ability, that the human brain has that is able to give someone the ability to make a decision. Shouldn't that decision be based on the laws of physics applied to the human mind in ways more complex than are currently known? Is what we as humans call choice merely an Illusion?      Just food for thought that's all. 10 pts for the best argument/answer.

20090307144810AA9mjPt	Arts & Humanities;Dancing	How can I help my daughter practice her dance?	My daughter is 9 years old and has been in dance since she was 3.  She has dance lessons once a week for 2hours.  She has always been told how talented she is (I think she is absolutely wonderful).  By nature she is a perfectionist.  She practices daily at home but she wants more.  In our small town children her age are put in a class based on their grade level not their ability.  To her dance is her everything.  I never took dance as a child and I do not know how to help her learn more.  She currently takes ballet, tap, jazz, and clogging(which has become her favorite).  Also, she wants to start point in a couple of years.  Any advice you have would be appreciated.
