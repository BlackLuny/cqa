hHQIUrNjaa	I personally think netbooks are crap, but i guess if $$ is a problem then its good. Acer is a very good brand. You can't use discs on them, so u can just download like AVG or something for antivirus. I use AntiVir its free and very nice. Online browser based games may have alittle trouble playing on the. You can forget gaming. I would suggest getting a laptop for like $500.00 because anything over $500.00 has a quad core. Assuming you dont need a quad core since you are considering a netbook, you should be fine.

Now click on your music folder on your desktop and click on that file you saved , it should be there! and when doing so your media player will pop up. Click on "BURN"  and on the right hand side you will see a white square and it should say "add file" or something like that click it. All the songs should pop up in that square .Then u need to put the CD in and let it read how much space is available and  click "BURN" which is below that square . Well there you go hope this isn't too confusing lol|`|PNLwOIOraa	Drag the songs onto Windows Media Player or Itunes then make one. :]|`|gD86SIWeaa	use itunes. its wayyy easier.|`|4k59EjXUaa	Well First Of All You Have To Have iTunes Or Another Program Opened (Cause Limewire Doesn't Have The Appropriate System Standards)    Then You Have To Create A Playlist With The Downloaded Songs (Any Songs BTW)    Then Insert A BLANK Disk    Hit BURN DISK With ALL The Songs You Want Checked In Your PLAYLIST      Then WAIT Till It AUTOMATICALLY Ejects The CD        And Last Of All ENJOY!|`|Pwqx6yZvaa	u need a seperate software|`|47382e48aef6e87e9665b1861684e79baa	drag the songs from limewire to itunes and burn it from there. you can't burn them directly from limewire|`|6Z49DZaRaa	Just use "Burn a CD" in Windows Media Player.

Anyway, you can drag and drop like I do.|`|qyWqp4GOaa	All you have to do is make a playlist on LimeWire. It usually shows when you play a song. When you finish making the playlist, click and drag all of the songs to a burn list on Windows Media Player or another program where you can burn CDs.|`|qTnEI5dwaa	iTunes  1. once you have downloaded the songs you can simply drag them into itunes (from either the library tab or the ones you just downloaded)   2. then make a playlist with the songs that you would like to have on the cd (ctrl + n)  then drag the songs into the playlist  3. insert disc into slot  4. right click on the playlist   5. click burn to disk  (i only use limewire for open source stuff, no worries)    If you don't have itunes it may be more complicated  1. Find out were in your computer your computer your downloaded songs are going (if you know were skip to step 7)   2. open my computer  3. (i may be wrong because all computers are different.) open up your C: drive  4. click program files  5. click limewire  6. look around in this folder possibly under the file called library or lib  if they are not there look in my music or my downloaded files.   7. put all the files you want on your cd in a folder   8. click burn to disk (on left column in xp) *make sure your cd is big enough for all the music you want on it.   9. when you are finished, i would move the folder to a place were you can find it again like my music or something.   hope it helps...

ywdmPH5Uaa	For the same level of card (9xxx GT vs. a 9xxx GS), the GT will be a bit better.    Of course, you could always put two GSs together (via SLI) and they would outperform a GT (but that's not comparing apples to apples).|`|0xz8mR2xaa	GT is better than GS in Nvidia's lineup, but the difference can be insignificant or very large depending upon which cards are in question. For example, an 8500GT is about twice as fast an an 8400gs. But, a 9800GSm is nearly as good as a 9800GT. Also, an 8800gs is significantly faster than an 8600GTS.

Also, most hosts have a way to automatically make the .htaccess and .htpassword files, usually encrypting them, therefore when you do it manually, your password is completely different then what you put because what you enter, is what the actual password would be when encrypted.

I'm not sure where to get them though, my friend has one and it seems to be able to charge his netbook (which requires much less power than a normal laptop).    There is one catch; only direct sunlight will charge your laptop. Lights from artificial sources (e.g fluoro lights) aren't powerful enough to charge a laptop.    But if you're going to be indoors, an extension cord or an extra battery may be your best bet.|`|0xz8mR2xaa	Yes. Look into a universal lithium-ion extended battery. They're thick slices that a computer can sit on, and can provide a full day's worth of power before running down. Most connect to the power jack, and come with an array of tips to fit most machines. While an unusual usage, I suppose one would also recharge the internal battery in operation.
wfjdYC4Iaa	Just wipe it clean and start over.. Do a full reload of everything..    Also, how much memory does it have?    Make sure your AntiVirus and Firewall are updated. Depending on the laptop, I would suggest you spend some of the money and get Kaspersky Internet Security. It works really well on our systems.    Do NOT use Norton Internet Security. I found this one out the hard way when it decided to use a gig of memory and the system had less than that (896MB). I couldn't kill the process, even with SYSTEM level access.  I had to back up what I could, do a full erase, then reinstall everything.

If you're looking for something to carry around your own files and use on like, lab computers, library computers, and your own desktop, or whatever, then a USB flash drive is your best bet.

If you're looking for a way to give files to a friend to keep, then your best bet is probably to burn it on to a data CD.

These are the only possible answers: 9, 18, 27, 36, 45, 54, 63, 72, 81.    Examples:  99 (9+9=18) then 99-18=81  98 (9+8=17) then 98-17=81  95 (9+5=14) then 95-14=81    62 (6+2=8) then 62-8=54  61 (6+1=7) then 61-7=54  60 (6-0=6) then  60-6=54  ......and so on.    It doesn't matter what you choose and knowing that it will be only one of those 9 numbers that the person will come to, you can type the page up so that the ball matches those numbers each time. Each time the symbols change so that you don't notice a pattern and the same symbols over and over again because the numbers 9, 18, 27, 36, 45, 54, 63, 72, and 81 will all have the same symbol because those are the only possible answers.

nqbcJjHyaa	If you can afford the new aluminum MacBook, get that one. It has a faster processor, etc. and is generally better than the entry level white MacBook. The MacBook comes with iLife 09 which is iMovie, iDvd, iPhoto, iTunes, Safari, Garage Band and more. Macs have the highest rated tech support, highest rated reliability, excellent battery life and highest resale value. The only thing you would need to add to it would be a better word processor, either Office (couple hundred) or get iWorks 09 (under $80 and opens and saves in Word, Powerpoint & Excel formats). And ignore the "doom and gloom" pundits. There are no released MacOs X viruses. Someone would need to write 3,000 Mac viruses a day for a year to equal the number of known Windows viruses today. It isn't going to happen. The last Mac virus was 3 years ago and a whole 49 Macs got it before it died out. There are handful of Mac trojans but you have to be duped into downloading them, installing them and activating them by putting in your admin password.

Fp0jrUtOaa	You've already done most of the things you need to protect yourself.  Reporting it to the police, the credit reporting agencies and the FTC were the right steps.  I also assume that you've formally disputed the charges with your bank.  (You didn't explicitly say so, though.  If you haven't, call the bank immediately.)    Assuming that you make the notification requirements, the bank may reimburse some or all of the money.  If the compromised card was a credit card, your liability is limited to $50.  If it was a debit card, you have far fewer protections and may be liable for the full amount lost so far.    The one step that I would not have recommended was calling the companies charging the account.  They are either in on the con or they were careless enough to be duped.  Their claim that they needed your SSN in order to cancel the charges is pretty clear evidence of the former (though there may be some legitimate need to verify your identity - that can usually be done with less sensitive information than SSN, though).    Having closed your account, there is no way that they can continue to charge the account.  They might try to make a claim that you have reneged on a contract and could send you to collection but when you dispute that, they will have to provide evidence that you really entered into the contract.  Keep detailed records of all correspondence and/or conversations you have with these people.  If you get a collection letter, respond to it immediately.  The Fair Debt Collection Act has strict timelines and if you fail to respond in time, you are assumed to concede the debt.    So far, the evidence you describe is limited to credit card fraud, not identity theft.  In your shoes, I would not yet take the step of freezing my credit report.  I would, however, watch my bank and credit card statements very carefully, dispute any unrecognized charges immediately and review the free copy of my credit report.      I would also shred any debit cards that have a Visa or Mastercard logo.  As I noted above, debit cards are treated differently under federal law.  Debit cards with a credit-card logo can be convenient but they are not worth the risk.  (Debit cards that are ATM-only are safe.  Your bank should be able to create one for you on request.)|`|IyCnihLmaa	Once your account is closed there should be no more charges although you should go to your bank and file against the unauthorized charges.  They will already have your account numbers and SSN so all you will need to do is prove who you are if they don't already know you.   This way, if there are more charges you will be able to show the bank that you already told them it was unauthorized.  You should get reimbursed by your bank if you report it within 30 days (some banks give more time)    You can talk with an attorney although that is $$$ and unless you are talking about thousands of dollars, it will cost you more than you will benefit from it - although for peace of mind, it is sometimes worth it.|`|zzvDybEiaa	Contact visa for reimbersment. as well as your bank.

If you open up the preferences of that application it will tell you what ports it uses for transfers.  Then all you have to do is open up your firewall settings and tell it to block those ports.

A Do...While loop repeats a section of code and then tests whether or not it should stop executing the code based on a statement in closed in the while statement.  It's different from a normal While loop because it'll run at least once before it tests to stop.    You just simply do the calculations necessary, and feed it into total.  Remember that you can use more than one variable on a line (such as total = total + (k*k)) or something.

There is not a really good method to convince them, just promise that you won't do anything that will put down your grades, and that you won't do something too horrible. It's better off if you'd just go to the library after school or something, create an account, and go on MySpace. That's what all the kids are doing.

dkpIjt5jaa	An affirmation to start: 1) Do not copy your documents elsewhere as this will only spread the Malware and do NOT use your Email until this is cleaned.    Now for the main part: This could be Malware disguised as AOL, deeply rooting itself in your system (some even hide in your router's firmware). Virus scanners and the Restore Point Utility are not good things to use against such invasion for this reason alone.    Get the programs I listed from another computer (Internet Caf, Public Library or friend's computer) onto a USB stick as Malware blocks you from downloading protection. A word of caution, be sure to read all programs help files completely before using them. If you still cannot use MBAM,  rename it Alteregobytes to confuse the Malware (but be sure to keep the .exe extension on it) and use it as alternative for part A of the following solution.     TRYING MBAM ALONE IS NOT ENOUGH AS YOU NEED A COMPLETE SOLUTION, here is one (use programs in the order stated):     A) Download MBAM (MalwareBytes' Anti-Malware): http://www.download.com/Malwarebytes-Ant... - Install the application and make sure a checkmark is placed next to Update Malwarebytes' Anti-Malware and Launch Malwarebytes' Anti-Malware, then click Finish ( If an update is found, it will download and install the latest version ).    Once the program has loaded, select "Perform Quick Scan", then click Scan ( The scan may take some time,so please be patient ). When the scan is complete, click OK, then Show Results to view the results. Make sure that everything is checked, and click Remove Selected ( When disinfection is completed, a log will open in Notepad and you may be prompted to Restart ).      B) Try the tricks and free programs I use: 1) Clean browsers junk.     Method One (now): In Internet Explorer (IE), click the Tools menu, then Delete Browsing History and in the box, click the Delete all button (bottom left) and Yes.  In Firefox (FF), go to tools, clear private data, make sure all boxes are checked and then click on the clear private data now button.    Method Two (Normal use: Every 14 days - Heavy use: Every 7 days): In IE, click the Tools menu, Delete Browsing History and in the box that opens, do these: a) click the button near Temporary Internet Files, click Yes and wait for the box that opens to close.   b) click the button near History, click Yes and wait for the box that opens to close and finally, click the close button (bottom right) to finish.    In FF, Go to tools, clear private data and uncheck all except Browsing History, Cache and Authenticated Sessions boxes then click on the clear private data now button.    Note: Close browser when done to clear cookies still in memory.  For other browsers or versions of the programs, check help files for guidance on doing cleanup.    2) Turn off the restore point utility ( Guide for XP: http://support.microsoft.com/kb/310405 and Vista: http://windowshelp.microsoft.com/Windows... )    3) Use this free cleaner: http://www.glaryutilities.com/gu.html to remove junk, remnants of installs/uninstalls and orphan registry entries.    4) Use a "Disk defragmenter".    5) Turn restore point utility back on. (see part 2)    6) Do not use toolbars (spyware).    7) Persisting problem after this, make sure your virus database is updated.    8) If the problem is very stubborn and you have a router, visit its web site and check for firmware that is more recent than your version. If FOUND, download and install, if NOT, use the router's reset switch, both methods return it to factory settings. "WARNING": Gather router install CDs, guides, passwords before doing this as you will need to do all connections again.      By doing so, you are on your way to being well protected BUT never relax your guard !      NOTE: If it is Malware, all these steps should eradicate it and if it is just a few errant files from AOL, step B  3 should take care of this problem.    In both cases, an additional benefit will be that your computer is a lot cleaner and a bit zippier in performance !|`|IyCnihLmaa	Have you gone into control panel under add and remove programs and  uninstalled everything associated with AOL?    This is either AOL security software or it is malware disguised to look like AOL software.  Have you scanned your computer for viruses and adware?
ZvkUBNOtaa	We'll need a little more information Jack.  How do you know your connection is working?  When you say you can't connect to the internet, do you mean that your browser isn't working or that the lights on the modem are blinking where they shouldn't.  You may be connected properly but not able to browse. Do other internet programs work OK, like  IM programs? Do you use a dial-up, an ADSL or a cable (DOCSIS) connection?  Have you tried shutting off the modem for 5 minutes and then powering it back up?  There's a condition with ADSL called "Sync but no Surf" that could also be the problem.    The first thing to do is to try to ping a major website.  Click Start/Run and type cmd in the box, hit enter.  This will open a command console, at the prompt in the window type ping yahoo.com     The next thing to check are your IP address settings.  In XP right click "My Network Places" and select properties. Select your connection, right click and select properties.  In Vista do the same but when the Network Properties comes up click the text on the left that says "Manage Network Connections", and select the connection you're using and right click for properties.  At this point in Vista you could also click the Diagnose item on the dialog menu and let Vista try to fix the connection for you.      In either case, you're looking for an item in the Networking tab on the window that pops up that has Internet Protocol Version 4 (TCP/IPv4) {Vista} or Internet Protocol (TCP/IP) {XP).  Click on that to select it and then click the Properties button.  In most cases and unless you need a static local IP, the best and easiest way is to click the box that says "Obtain an IP address automatically"  and then click OK.  If you're on a router you need to check your device documentation to be sure that the router is acting as a DHCP (Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol) server for this to work.    If those things don't fix it, you'll need to answer some of the questions I asked in the first paragraph.|`|Asb3yT3xaa	if you are using a modem then turn off the modem, turn off any router, then turn off your computer,then in reverse, turn on computer, after it has booted, turn on router, then after it has cycled through, turn on modem and it should reset itself.

bnCiNAQdaa	nothing useful.  you cannot connect 2 PC's together (or 2 routers, or 2 switches) with a standard ethernet cable.  you need a crossover cable to connect 2 like devices.    and besides sending files back and forth between them? thats about it. and since you have tied up the ethernet port, you will have no internet access.    dont be cheap. go buy a router.|`|NZxvybYUaa	If the NIC in one or both of the computers is auto-sensing (probable), you don't need a crossover cable. Just connect a cat5 cable between the two ethernet ports.  If you can't connect this way, you must use a crossover cable or an autosensing switch and 2 straight -thru cables. You have created an ad hoc network. You need to run the network setup wizard on both computers, using the 'ad hoc' option. The wizard will automatically set the correct settings for your "network". You need to share at least one folder on each computer, but you can share as many as you want. Some home networks just share complete drives, which makes all files on each computer available to any other computer on the network.|`|7aqEtfLRaa	You can't connect them with only one cable, you need 2 cables + a hub, router, or switch.    Once you do that you can share an internet connection and network them.|`|0xz8mR2xaa	Share a printer  Share drives  Run SSH and SFTP to share resources and access each computer from the other  Play LAN games    Also, you'll need an Ethernet hub and two pieces of Cat5 patch.
AVDTZ63Oaa	Reset the thing...  I'm going to say coincidence.    Believe it or not.. an RJ-11 connector will not only fit in an rj-45 jack, but if the wiring is right, it'll even work...    Poke the reset button.|`|UNGM6Xk7aa	No, Typical RJ-11 (phone line) will not fit into a LAN ethernet jack. If you still have that problem then there should be a reset button on the back of your router hold it for 10 seconds that resets it to factory settings|`|UXAjzdl2aa	i think so.   i know they don't fit, but if you force the plug in there, you will basically be shooting up 50 volts into the router.   that can't be good.
XmnVJxzaaa	No, I'm afraid it won't. According to the Compaq website your computer has an ATA-5 interface for hard disk drives (HDD). The MK2552GSX uses the ATA-8 interface, which is more commonly known as SATA. I've put a link in sources* that has the full system specifications of your laptop  model.  ATA-5 (a form of EIDE interface) is now usually called the PATA interface. Most PATA HDDs are now on the newer ATA-6 interface standard. The ATA-6 standard will work fine on your laptop.   If you go into any decent local computer shop and tell them you need an EIDE, ATA-6 or PATA laptop hard disk drive, they will know what you need. And any decent online retailer will have a link allowing you to specify those qualifiers as well. If you need more help,  update this question, or email me through my Y!A profile.  Good luck.
AQgr5lQYaa	Mistakes will happen with ordering systems.    You didn't pay for two items, you only paid for one of them.  You will find no legal assistance to allow you to keep a product you did not pay for.  Since they're offering to arrange for a pick up, take that option.  I'm sure you'll use the other cartridge at some point in the future, however, so it probably wouldn't hurt to pay for the extra one now and just have it on hand.    I wouldn't attempt to fight it if I were you, they may give up in the end and just allow you to keep it if you do fight, but don't expect to be allowed to order from the site ever again.|`|46eedfcc0d431f5086b7b4cfa950eb57aa	Choose one of their options|`|W9PSxtXFaa	You must have to send extra cartridge back as if you refuse to send extra cartridge back and not to pay for that than it is crime    You did not order 2 cartridge so you can ask company for shipping charge to send 1 cartridge back to them but you must have to send it back

AA11779483	when you use a cell reference like A1--where neither the row nor the column is modified with a $--then the reference will be changed relative to where you move or copy it.    In cell C1 enter "=A1+B1" (without the "s), then copy (CTRL-C) that one cell. (it should be surrounded by moving dashes).  then highlight all the other cells in that column, down to the last row with an A and B value.  then paste (CTRL-V) into the highlighted area.  The formula will be copied into every cell, but more importantly, on every row, it will be modified automatically to reference that row's variables! C2 will read "=A2+B2", C3 will read "=A3+B3" etc    (the problem with TheMonster54's answer is, that will add all the numbers in both columns together and put the single answer in the one cell, not one sum per line like you want)|`|VTv7zsfFaa	in the fx bar at the top type in =sum(B2:B[watever])+(C2:C[watever])

zorYTX59aa	YOU DON'T NEED ANY DOWNLOADERS OR CONVERTERS. SOME PEOPLE ON   YAHOO! ARE ACTUALLY DISGUISED SALESPEOPLE TRYING TO 'SUCKER' YOU   INTO BUYING THEIR BOGUS AND UNNECESSARY SOFTWARE.    If youre using Windows Movie Maker, there is  the possibility that you mistakenly saved your   video as an "MSWMM" file with "Save Project"  rather than save it as an "AVI" or "WMV" with   "Save Movie File" (Win XP) or "Publish Movie"   (Vista).    There is a world of difference between the first   example and the others: not only is MSWMM   considered a "work-in-progress", it is not even   a "true" video. The other 2 examples are what  you need to properly save your file and upload  it to YouTube.    The best way to save and upload your video is:    1 -- click the blue "Tasks" icon.....(you'll get the "Movie Tasks" menu)    2 -- click "Finish Movie", the 3rd option.....(it will expand to 5 choices)    3 -- click "Save to my Computer".....(the "Save Movie" wizard appears)    4 -- enter the name of your movie.....(it is best to stay in "My Videos")    5 -- click "Next" at the bottom.....(you'll see the "Movie Setting" page)    6a -- for regular video, click "Best quality for playback".....(the default)  6b -- for 16:9, click "Compress to" and tweak it until you see 640x360    7 -- click "Next" at the bottom.....(you will get the "Completing" page)    8 -- click "Finish" at the bottom.....(the saving may take quite a while)    9 -- click the blue "Tasks" icon again.....(you'll get the "Movie Tasks")    A -- click "Finish Movie" again, the 3rd option.....(you'll get 5 choices)    B -- this time, click "Send to the Web".....(I'm sure you know the rest)    YouTube suggests that the video format be  MPEG4 at 480x360 recorded together with   sound in MP3 audio, all at a rate of greater   than 24 frames per second. Other files that  are accepted include AVI, MPG, MOV and   WMV (which is Windows Movie Maker).

I hope my answer is what you're looking for.|`|FTvkahKWaa	When the file cannot be converted or too small size, it means the file is in the wrong format...    Ensure the file format is correct before uploading to youtube...    Using windows movie maker -- you have to save it into the proper file format, that is "wmv" file (use the "save movie file" on the menu at the top left) before upload..    The WMV file will be smaller in size but still quite good quality.. so uploading it will be faster.    also some movie maker version requires to be published instead of save... for that, press "ctrl-p" to publish or search&select a publish option from the menu at the top of the program window.    --for best editing....    use windows movie maker (included in your windows machine)... it can help you make beautiful slideshow or video clip(e.g. mixing your songs with pictures/video/etc).... then save it as video file such as wmv file format... finally upload.    or .. Just get those clips you want , save & convert them, and then mix/match with pix/sound/etc using windows movie maker to create new masterpieces....    this will help you.... Use 'zillatube'. This is the easiest (and also the fastest) way.    Zillatube produces mpg/mp3 formats from youtube that are compatible with windows movie maker(or media player), and more.    It is very easy to download and convert videos. Then edit those converted mp3/mpg videos with windows movie maker... save your file as wmv and then upload.    It works very well....just google search for "zillatube"    =============================???|`|rMSJ6Gqcaa	Your video needs to be converted to the .flv format.    Use converting software for this task - such as Total Video Converter.|`|bPAt4SNtaa	well maybe the file will work in windows movie maker,then you can convert the file from there.

This is the way that html works - the easiest way to make it go to default.html is change the name of default.html to index.html. Other than that, you can open up your existing index.html file and paste this code in the  portion of the page (it is an html re-direct):          Be sure to replace "fillinyoururl" with your domain (including the location of default.html), and this will automatically send your visitors to your default.html page.|`|XGa2p39Jaa	Due to the fact I've never used that host, I can't give you exact instructions.

And if it's been used once, and NOT deactivated on the computer it was installed on, you won't be able to use it, because Adobe will know it's in use. In other words, if he bought the Master Collection, installed it on his computer, and then is offering to let you use it too, that's a violation of the license agreement (in fact, it's a form of software piracy). Although you MAY install the suite on 2 computers, for example a desktop and a laptop, they in use at the same time (and since one of the things the Adobe products do is automatically check for updates, Adobe will know if it's a second installation and the other one is in use too.)

0xz8mR2xaa	Okay. You have a 250 watt Bestec power supply and a PCI-e 16x slot. Given how this machine has a slow single-core CPU, I don't suggest spending much money on graphics. The HD4650 is fast enough to play the latest titles on moderate settings, and is currently at Newegg for $40. I'd suggest buying a better power supply, too, but the card draws less than 50 watts, so really, it should work even on a 250 as long as you don't plan on marathon gaming sessions. If you decide to buy a better power supply, a cheap FSP, Silverstone Strider or Antec Basiq of 400+ watts is a great choice.    http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.as...|`|ChBK5Lv9aa	You can buy an card with a pci-e x16 slot on it.

But Mac cost significantly more for less hardware..    You pay more for less Mac hardware than a PC...  Why? Because people don't realize that Mac uses a subset of PC hardware...    A number of PCs can also run OS X (Mac OS)  http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&q=os+... as well just that Apple makes it illegal in order to get Market share.. The reason why Mac can run native Windows  is because it is using a subset of PC hardware,    If you decide to buy a Mac for running Windows, you will still have to get the same virus/spyware protection, and run into the same issues as a regular PC.    Now is a Mac worth buying for OS X?    I say:  NO... for the following reasons...    ADVANTAGES WINDOWS :  Aprox 90% of the market is Windows and most PCs have windows already pre-installed.  1) Some websites require Internet Explorer, to run IE on Mac you really get ies4osx which is the Windows version of IE running really buggy and illegal if you don't have a legitimate copy of Windows.  2)  Supports devices (printers and other things you hook into the computer).  3) More business software/games  4) Want the dock on OS X (Mac)? google/yahoo rocketdock, objectdoc.  5) Used by businesses.    ADVANTAGES LINUX :  1) FREE (most versions are)  2) Install software by eitjher 1) Synaptic Package Manager,  2) Add/Remove   3) Opening a .deb or .rpm file (depending on distribution)  2) Like the Mac OS X effects? go yahoo/google COMPIZ FUSION which can do any cool effect a Mac can do and many ore....  http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E4Fbk52Mk...  http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3gkX9HDf...

QUALITY/PROBLEMS  Contrary to belief, Macs are not better quality. Apple also has been changing suppliers to try to "lower the price" and thus lowering quality. Even with the lower prices, Macs still cost more, they spend a higher percent of budget trying to make it look pretty, and marketing.    Sample of problems: Overheating Macbooks, OS X- not responding to keyboard, some units with 16bit screens, etc. Apple statistics are misleading since Mac users with problem machines are more likely to go out and buy a new computer than PC users.  Apple is lowering prices which means you can expect lower quality than in the past. Apple had switched the manufacturers producing parts. OS X also has problems slowing down.  http://news.cnet.com/8301-13506_3-100202...  http://www.tuaw.com/2008/08/01/apples-qu...  http://www.appledefects.com/  http://www.mac-forums.com/forums/os-x-op...

dkpIjt5jaa	Two affirmations to start: 1) Do not reformat or use system restore to start from new as it is too harsh and you should do it only as a last resort.    2) Do not copy your documents elsewhere as this will only spread the Malware and do NOT use your Email until this is cleaned.    Now for the main part: This is Malware, deeply rooting itself in your system (some even hide in your router's firmware). Virus scanners and the Restore Point Utility are not good things to use against such invasion for this reason alone.    Get the programs I listed from another computer (Internet Caf, Public Library or friend's computer) onto a USB stick as Malware blocks you from downloading protection. A word of caution, be sure to read all programs help files completely before using them. If you still cannot use MBAM,  rename it Alteregobytes to confuse the Malware (but be sure to keep the .exe extension on it) and use it as alternative for part A of the following solution.     TRYING MBAM ALONE IS NOT ENOUGH AS YOU NEED A COMPLETE SOLUTION, here is one (use programs in the order stated):     A) Download MBAM (MalwareBytes' Anti-Malware): http://www.download.com/Malwarebytes-Ant... - Install the application and make sure a checkmark is placed next to Update Malwarebytes' Anti-Malware and Launch Malwarebytes' Anti-Malware, then click Finish ( If an update is found, it will download and install the latest version ).    Once the program has loaded, select "Perform Quick Scan", then click Scan ( The scan may take some time,so please be patient ). When the scan is complete, click OK, then Show Results to view the results. Make sure that everything is checked, and click Remove Selected ( When disinfection is completed, a log will open in Notepad and you may be prompted to Restart ).      B) Try the tricks and free programs I use: 1) Clean browsers junk.     Method One (now): In Internet Explorer (IE), click the Tools menu, then Delete Browsing History and in the box, click the Delete all button (bottom left) and Yes.  In Firefox (FF), go to tools, clear private data, make sure all boxes are checked and then click on the clear private data now button.    Method Two (Normal use: Every 14 days - Heavy use: Every 7 days): In IE, click the Tools menu, Delete Browsing History and in the box that opens, do these: a) click the button near Temporary Internet Files, click Yes and wait for the box that opens to close.   b) click the button near History, click Yes and wait for the box that opens to close and finally, click the close button (bottom right) to finish.    In FF, Go to tools, clear private data and uncheck all except Browsing History, Cache and Authenticated Sessions boxes then click on the clear private data now button.    Note: Close browser when done to clear cookies still in memory.  For other browsers or versions of the programs, check help files for guidance on doing cleanup.    2) Turn off the restore point utility ( Guide for XP: http://support.microsoft.com/kb/310405 and Vista: http://windowshelp.microsoft.com/Windows... )    3) Use this free cleaner: http://www.glaryutilities.com/gu.html to remove junk and remnants files.    4) Use a "Disk defragmenter".    5) Turn restore point utility back on. (see part 2)    6) Do not use toolbars (spyware).    7) Persisting problem after this, make sure your virus scanner's database is updated BUT do not use AVG free (Too many false positives).    8) If the problem is very stubborn and you have a router, visit its web site and check for firmware that is more recent than your version. If FOUND, download and install, if NOT, use the router's reset switch, both methods return it to factory settings. "WARNING": Gather router install CDs, guides, passwords before doing this as you will need to do all connections again.      By doing so, you are on your way to being well protected BUT never relax your guard !    And as a bonus, your machine will be cleaner and probably a bit faster ( all that for free )|`|lLiQzJjBaa	Download and run Spybot Search and Destroy, don't use third party pop-up blocking programs as they are often malware themselves.    Use Firefox or something besides IE as your web browser.    http://www.safer-networking.org/index2.h...|`|lb0bYSgUaa	In order to successfully remove malware infections (viruses, spyware, adware etc) from your PC you need to follow a methodical approach as well as using effective (and free) tools.  Theres a decent guide covering this that you can work through at My Slow PC (http://www.MySlowPC.co.uk/)  click on the Troubleshooting link.  Heres my advice from it:    1.) Turn System Restore OFF so any infection that you remove is not restored.    2.) Scan with a combination of the best detection utilities as youll find different scanners can sometimes pick up different infections.  E.g.       * McAfee Stinger  a free stand-alone utility used to detect and remove specific viruses.     * SpyBot Search & Destroy  a spyware/adware scanner     * Lavasoft Adaware  for spyware/adware    Note  it might be a good idea to disconnect your network connection once youve updated them with the latest virus/spyware definitions.  This is due to the fact that often an infection is trying to spread over your network.    3.) If the above fails or youre not sure if youre still infected, when you start your PC tap the F8 key, select Safe Mode and repeat the scans once youre connected.    I hope the above helps, as mentioned the guide above is a lot more detailed and the My Slow PC site is pretty useful.  Good luck!

If you're just sitting on your hands with nothing to do, then build a demo; otherwise, check out the sites of local charities, not-for-profits, or publicly-owned institutions (like your local library) and volunteer your services. Don't promise the world; it might be sufficient just to design a new layout for one section of the site.<br>  <br>  This would a) give you something for your resume; b) build a relationship that might offer some benefit (paid work later, or some other consideration); and c) increase the likelihood that they will mention your name to others who might be looking for a web designer.<br>  <br>  Do be clear, however, on the limits of what you offer.  You certainly would want to avoid any misunderstanding about how much work you are willing to do (since you wouldn't be paid).<br>  <br>  Alternatively, instead of a strict demo site (ie for a fictitious company) you could redo an existing site for any company at all.  Just find a site that looks badly in need of a redesign.  It looks a little better than a completely invented site.<br>  <br>  Finally — while you're waiting for the phone to ring, study, study, study!  Always improve your craft. Learn enough about ancillary areas (Flash, server-side languages like PHP, Javascript) that you won't be completely out to lunch when you need to know some of that (and you will!). Check out Amazon's reviews for web-design-related books and keep upgrading your skills.<br>  <br>  Having said that, however, nothing upgrades your skills like a real-world contract, with all the surprises and challenges it will bring.

When you turn off the system, all services are ended.  When re-starting, the system goes through a set series of service start up's, and this security bundle is just started before the firewall gets loaded.  One method of ending that, is to change the way you 'shut down' your system.  For Windows, a reliable & fast start-up often depends on   how the system is put away.  Turning a Windows system "OFF" (from 'Start> Turn Off Computer...' button) is not the best way to put your system away for the night (or extended periods) and  forcing a shutdown with the power button is NEVER a good option; only a last resort.  It prevents Windows from 'housekeeping' system files to get ready for the next start-up, and may, over time, cause file corruption; slow down; even  break Windows.    A much better method is 'Hibernation'.  Shutdowns using the 'hibernate' method gives several benefits: It's a near zero power state; all 'Startup' folder items are already loaded, Windows background services are already 'up', and all open work moves to the hard drive, yielding really fast start-ups.  And if power is lost (storms, etc.) the document or picture you were working on won't be lost like it would be in 'Standby' mode, and the system will resume just where you left it.    Go to Start> Control Panel> Power Options> Hibernate: here check the box.  To show this option when turning unit off; Start> Turn Off Computer> HOLD down 'Shift' key & 'Standby' becomes "Hibernate': tick that.  (Some systems have a 'crescent moon' key to go right to hibernate).  Note:  emergency power disconnect can be done without any affect on the system, but unfiltered power spikes will likely cause damage to the system.      To start up, push the power button, and Windows will resume right where you left it, bada bing.|`|UNGM6Xk7aa	If you are running windows xp then go  to start>control panel>system mantinace>security center|`|QCjOcME6aa	The above mates have Solved your problem.

T8G0wOXQaa	Well google chrome is simple to explain.    The reason it is so fast is because every tab runs as a separate browser.    It is the equivalent of running 3 internet explorers except the google makers made it not take up so much ram. Hope this helps.|`|lLiQzJjBaa	Yes, other web browsers can access web pages faster than others because of differences in coding and how they actually go about it.    Chrome and Firefox are significantly faster at opening pages than IE for example.|`|I24AuawZaa	How fast your browsing is depends on 3 factors.     1. Browser  2. Connection speed  3. Computer specs (specifically RAM and CPU)    1. Browser    Differences in browsers occur to how they process the information. Some browser developers spend ageeeees working out the most efficient way to process browser scripts into people-speak.     My favourite is Opera, it seems to have nailed this perfect, plus it has a load of extra features.     2. Connection Speed    This is to do with how fast the information can get from the remote server, to your computer before being processed by the browser. If you have a fast internet connection (eg broadband) it's unlikely to have much of an effect.     3. Computer Specs    This one is simple, the better CPU you have, the more calculations the browser can send to it, and the faster they can be worked out.     The RAM and Backing Storage also need to be relatively good, as most browsers use caching to store images and other large content, so next time you visit that site, the content is on your computer rather than having to download it again.     I recomend Opera if you're wanting a decent browser that's fast, customizable, feature rich, and simple to use.   http://www.opera.com/browser/|`|AA10911217	not always, depends on memory allocation and how efficiently it is coded, google chrome uses firefox source code, making a new user profile should speed things up if your FF is running slowly|`|W9PSxtXFaa	Because they are light weight  Also speed depends on configuration of browser|`|o3c8KDITaa	okay firstly if you have windows vista you would have to turn off all the extra features to get the most out of its browser but yes any other web browser is faster than internet explorer. Opera (my favorite browser) claims it is the fastest and the way i figured out why it runs faster is because it draws more memory so there is a short but specific answer to your question. what one can deduce from this is that in order for web browsers to run faster they need to hog ddr memory.    Using opera again as an example has found  ways to use less memory in order so that users with less memory can get the best out of the browser -- Chrome on the other hand has used a different method namely seperating each tab to allow more user RAM to be freed for other programs (in my oppinion, this method is more effective).|`|jQUkECRCaa	If there is any difference, it would be because there aren't as many people using that browser, but it is such a small difference i would be very surprised if someone could actually tell if one was faster or not.|`|AA10009070	You are correct, if you have really a fast connection then discussing the browser speed becomes a moot point.

zorYTX59aa	If YouTube is slow, stuck or weird, and people suggest you  either change, install or get stuff....DON'T TOUCH A THING.    Please dont tinker with your "Java Scripts", "Flash Players"  or different browsers -- and definitely stay away from any of  the software that salespeople (disguised as answerers here  on Yahoo) are trying to sucker you into buying.    None of those things will help you because I am pretty sure   your computer and YouTube were working fine before, right?  The first rule of thumb and ideal option should always try to  be: DON'T disable, erase, uninstall, switch, download, alter,   add, change or install anything. Matters will only get worse.    Several times each day, YouTube shuts down a few of their   servers to update stuff. Be patient if YouTube is slow, stuck  or mangled. Transmissions from YouTube to your computer  are done in multiple tiny packets of data and flash at a time.   That's why sometimes you may get any of these scenarios:   bits and pieces of text/thumbnails in weird places; sluggish  loading/buffering; the spinning circle going on forever; or the  player being blank. This problem could fix itself within a few   hours or by the next day.    If your YouTube continues to behave slow, stuck or strange,  it's very possible that your directories of "temporary internet   files" and RAM (sometimes known as "cache") are close to  the maximum and just cannot take anymore, the end result   being any of the above scenarios or videos that: A) come to   a complete freeze; B) start/stop/start/stop in a choppy way;   or C) never even make it onto your screen.    "Temporary internet files" are tiny bits of webpages that get   permanently put on your hard-drive. They will remain forever  on your computer, gradually plugging it up like hair stuck in   a sink drain, until you finally get rid of them -- or "clear your   cache" of "temporary internet files", "cookies", and "history".  Then reboot.    If you're not sure how to clear your "cache", or if you would  like more "tips" on making YouTube run even better without   having to buy or install anything, please click on my avatar   and send send me a message -- ideally with your YouTube   channel or email address. I'll guide you step-by-step, using  plain English and with full explanations.    Note 1: if you have Google Web Accelerator (or something  similar to it), dump it, burn it, trash it, disable it, uninstall it;   -- do all that you can to get as far away from it as possible,   even though this contradicts all my advice. Not only does it   conflict with YouTube, simply clicking on "Don't Accelerate   This Website" will not help you whatsoever.    Note 2: longer videos only require "Flash" and "Shockwave"  in order to play smooth. Other than that, avoid all the sales   pitches that some Yahooers are shilling, because they are   really disguised salespeople and peddlers. Their "solutions"   have nothing to do with your question, and their wares may  actually worsen your problem. Besides, what kind of stupid   answer is:....[my paraphrase] "Although you can't watch or   access videos properly, buy our downloader."    Note 3: a peculiar fix that once worked for me was altering   the URL from "www.youtube.com" to simply "youtube.com"  (or you could even try "ca.youtube.com").|`|y5Ggaxf5aa	You're internet connection must've slowed down a lot.|`|FTvkahKWaa	Try refreshing the webpage    or...    Turn off web accelerator, if you have one - it may be conflicting with youtube.    or..    It could be due to slow connection or high traffic.  Try watching it during off peak hours, the video will be smoother.    Or you could watch it offline smoothly... try using 'zillatube' .    It works well - Just google search "zillatube" to get it.    ==========================???

zorYTX59aa	You can't have a video autoplay on your   YouTube profile page. But you can do it  on external websites such as MySpace.    All that you would need to do is append  "&autoplay=1" to both ends of the video  URL address that YouTube gives to you  (example: watch?v=AB1Cd2eF3GH).    When you click on the YouTube embed  code, the entire string highlights -- there  is no other alternative. Here's the format  of a typical YouTube embed code:    ?   ? width="425" height="344">  ?   ? name="movie"   ? value="http://www. youtube. com/v/AB1Cd2eF3GH">  ?    ?   ? name="allowFullScreen"   ? value="true">  ?   ?   ? src="http://www. youtube. com/v/AB1Cd2eF3GH"   ? type="application/x-shockwave-flash"   ? allowfullscreen="true"   ? width="425" height="344">  ?   ?     After you add "&autoplay=1" to both the  value and the source codes, this is what   the overall embed code should look like:    ?   ? width="425" height="344">  ?   ? name="movie"   ? value="http://www. youtube. com/v/AB1Cd2eF3GH&autoplay=1">  ?    ?   ? name="allowFullScreen"   ? value="true">  ?   ?   ? src="http://www. youtube. com/v/AB1Cd2eF3GH&autoplay=1"   ? type="application/x-shockwave-flash"   ? allowfullscreen="true"   ? width="425" height="344">  ?   ?

Acer tends to be less than others but have horrible reviews.    Sony and Mac also have great computers but they tend to be more on the pricey side -you end up paying more for the brand than the laptop or computer itself.|`|jKJ2rdmJaa	First of all if you are the least bit computer knowledge go to a site called newegg.com and check out you can do there. You can talk to a tech that they have and build a laptop that is better than what you can get in the store and in the end last you longer as well.   they have a brand called everex that they sell and as couple of other ones as well they work just as well as the hp i have to agree with the other person who answered in that acers suck.  good luck

2LHgmq97aa	PC is better...  Not to mention the newer versions of OS X will no longer support the PowerPC architecture of the G5    You pay more for less Mac hardware than a PC...  Why? Because people don't realize that Mac uses a subset of PC hardware...    A number of PCs can also run OS X (Mac OS)  http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&q=os+... as well just that Apple makes it illegal in order to get Market share.. The reason why Mac can run native Windows  is because it is using a subset of PC hardware,    If you decide to buy a Mac for running Windows, you will still have to get the same virus/spyware protection, and run into the same issues as a regular PC.    Now is a Mac worth buying for OS X?    I say:  NO... for the following reasons...    ADVANTAGES WINDOWS :  Aprox 90% of the market is Windows and most PCs have windows already pre-installed.  1) Some websites require Internet Explorer, to run IE on Mac you really get ies4osx which is the Windows version of IE running really buggy and illegal if you don't have a legitimate copy of Windows.  2)  Supports devices (printers and other things you hook into the computer).  3) More business software/games  4) Want the dock on OS X (Mac)? google/yahoo rocketdock, objectdoc.  5) Used by businesses.    ADVANTAGES LINUX :  1) FREE (most versions are)  2) Install software by eitjher 1) Synaptic Package Manager,  2) Add/Remove   3) Opening a .deb or .rpm file (depending on distribution)  2) Like the Mac OS X effects? go yahoo/google COMPIZ FUSION which can do any cool effect a Mac can do and many ore....  http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E4Fbk52Mk...  http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3gkX9HDf...  (there is no flickering when you use it like on the video, not sure why the person has the flicker)  3)  Mac OS X Doc? google/yahoo Avant Window Navigator.Cairo Dock, http://www.dailymotion.com/video/x3rf5q_...  http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p0hzi22g2...  4) It is FASTERr/MORE SECURE to surf on the internet  5) Some Windows programs work with Wnehq/Crossover (also avail on Mac, but why pay $$$)    Instructions how to download, burn and boot  http://www.howtogeek.com/howto/windows-v...  Dual Boot Instructions http://apcmag.com/how_to_dual_boot_windo...    SECURITY  Mac OS X was hacked in 2006 less than 30 minutes, and within 2 minutes in a contest in 2008 . Linux and Vista were not hacked until another day when restrictions were lowered. Vista was next, and then Linux.  Macs are standardized with Cameras, if your Mac gets hacked, the hacker can turn on your camera with more ease.  Please Note: All OS's have vulnerabilities.  http://www.zdnet.com.au/news/security/so...  http://www.infoworld.com/article/08/03/2...  http://news.softpedia.com/news/Microsoft...    VIRUSES  Mac OS X has viruses (and significantly on the rise), a friend of mine has a virused Mac. As more users use Macs, more viruses will come out for it. Especially when users think "they are safe".  http://infosecurity.us/?p=4005  http://blogs.chron.com/techblog/archives...  http://www.macsimumnews.com/index.php/ar...    QUALITY/PROBLEMS  Contrary to belief, Macs are not better quality. Apple also has been changing suppliers to try to "lower the price" and thus lowering quality. Even with the lower prices, Macs still cost more, they spend a higher percent of budget trying to make it look pretty, and marketing.    Sample of problems: Overheating Macbooks, OS X- not responding to keyboard, some units with 16bit screens, etc. Apple statistics are misleading since Mac users with problem machines are more likely to go out and buy a new computer than PC users.  Apple is lowering prices which means you can expect lower quality than in the past. Apple had switched the manufacturers producing parts. OS X also has problems slowing down.  http://news.cnet.com/8301-13506_3-100202...  http://www.tuaw.com/2008/08/01/apples-qu...  http://www.appledefects.com/  http://www.mac-forums.com/forums/os-x-op...

1aKO6ukbaa	That computer will have no problem with your music interests, email, and myspace/facebook.  The processor is darn good and power efficient for a budget system.  Should you suddenly turn into an intense gamer overnight, slapping a video card in there will take care of that, too.    Pretty good price this week at Best Buy that comes with a monitor and printer.|`|ElYQxK0Taa	I use this model to produce music. If your needing mass storage the SATA option is available, although for most the 640GB on-board is usually more than enough. Compatibility is an issue for some of the production software mainly because of Vista 64-bit still being new to the tech world.. For an overall computer though for what your inquiring I highly recommend it. Especially for the price it's available at, best in its class!!!

In your case though I would also recommend using a proxy  server when surfing the web.    You sharing that wireless connection is pretty unsafe, even if a password is used, and as you noticed the IP address you all share is susceptible to many things...including being banned.    Using a proxy will allow you to mask your real IP when surfing, which makes it more difficult to track your surfing habits.  Also your connection is encrypted and secured so if someone is spying on your network they won't be able to grab any of your data.    The proxy I use also rotates IPs every 30 minutes and allows you to choose from 3 different locations so you have a ton of IP addresses at your disposal...meaning you won't have to worry about your IP getting banned from sites.

RAM does not measure performance, where GHz captures some of that performance potential.<br>  <br>  However, one big fallacy is that everyone things that bigger numbers are better, which is true for CPUs using the same architecture, but otherwise incorrect.|`|vo42ZRPdaa	that is only about 10% faster so you will not really notice the speed difference under any real world usage|`|kFNii2Hzaa	The only difference is that the 3.06ghz processor will process information at a faster rate.

kZVblG3maa	Hi there. Avg is an average protection but is not the most positive and effective solution against most threats. If you wish to be more protective i would recommend a free virus program called "Avast" which has more features to keep you protected. If you wish to keep to Avg that's ok but you are not fully protected. Also Avg's internet shield only works with Internet Explorer but Avast has 3 shields that work together to stop threats like trojans. As your question says is it any good my answer would be "No".|`|77PMVjAAaa	No antivirus is perfect, even big names like Norton and Macfee have their flaws. <br>  <br>  I use AVG personally and extremely happy about it. It's not resource intensive, and does a good job for it's worth.

The paid version is better.|`|CiGgPeUEaa	yep, AVG is the best out there sister. and panda is pretty good as well, i guess.|`|wFRuecKwaa	It is a relatively good antivirus and is suitable for normal users.|`|1504ed0aa41d9367f9e3e5ec6d17284eaa	no look in search for questions ---on avg problems an read all of them <br>  use avast with superantispyware or spyware doctor free <br>  <br>  <br>  this is my choice  avira with pctools threatfire i get great results no problems at all and these are free to the public ( and they up date themselves )|`|AA12069128	Yes.

The Nvidia 6150 is an entry level video card, and is more used for basic gaming and does not even support Direct X 10. You should at least look into getting a Geforce 8800 GT. I would really not use this computer since the processor runs from 2.1 to 2.5GHz respectively. Not a gaming or encoding chip by any stretch of the imagination, these processors are best suited for media center PCs or in any application where quiet and cool operation take precedence over performance. You should go for something in the $500 range, or build the computer yourself, but this is by far not a gaming machine. Good for basic stuff though, but it might need at least an 8600 GS or GT to run Vista well.<br>  Have a nice day<br>  Ken

Having a corrupted registry can cause a whole host of errors and problems. Freezing up is one of them. If you have a lot of unnecessary registry keys that are hogging up your computer resources. Your computer is bound to choke. Scan your registry with a good registry cleaner. If you pull up more than 20 errors or duplication, clean your registry.<br>  Go to:<a href="http://downloadlk.com/themosteffectiveregistrycleaner.htm" rel="nofollow">http://downloadlk.com/themosteffectivere...</a> get one to free scan your pc<br>  <br>  2. Depending on your RAM specs and your computer usage. This could also be the issue. Having an insufficient amount of free space does not allow your RAM to function properly. If you are using a lot of RAM by net surfing or other activities without enough empty space your will get freezes. You don't need to buy new RAM but you should increase your free space by removing unnecessary data and perhaps increasing your virtual memory. The below link will show you how.<br>  <br>  3. Spyware could be the culprit, so do a scan and see if your computer is infected.<br>  Get the best one from: <a href="http://toptenantispywareviews.com" rel="nofollow">http://toptenantispywareviews.com</a> to scan your computer.<br>  <br>  4.

To find those two programs just google the names.|`|uGKCsvdpaa	There could be a number of reasons for this. The first thing you should do is consider installing more Ram in your system. I would recommend at least 1 to 2Gigs of RAM. You should also consider putting a 2nd hard drive in your computer or getting an external HD. Use this to put all of your pictures, documents, music, movies ETC.. Things like these can really slow down a HD even with regular defrags. Also consider buying a new main HD. Older HD's tend to run at slower speeds and have a lower cache size which means no matter how empty it is it will still cause your computer to run slow. You should also run disk cleanups before every defrag. You can also install programs such as CCleaner(can be downloaded for free off of ccleaner.com) which will remove files that slow your computer. You may not be able to make your computer start up as fast as the day you bought it but these will make a difference.<br>  <br>  You can find RAM and HD's for excellent prices at sites such a newegg.com & tigerdirect.com

Also, DVDShrink is a great DVD ripping/copying software. I used it once when I had to extract some scenes from a DVD for a school presentation and put the excerpts into a PowerPoint. <br>  <br>  When you get into copying games, then it gets a bit tricky. Usually you have to adhere to some sort of user end agreement with the game consoles and almost always you need a modded console to play copied games. Modding consoles is against the user end agreements almost always. Also, games typically come with DRM in them so copying them is difficult and not worth your while.|`|XlyLakYAaa	It actually is illegal to remove the copy protection from a DVD, so yes, DVD Rippers are illegal.

NkbhHcIAaa	if your westell modem is not wireless , how in the hell do you think it is going to pass a wireless signal ? also does your PC have a wireless card?|`|ytNlz3b7aa	I don't suppose it dawned on you to call the tech support phone number included with the instructions, huh?|`|t5sYXwSqaa	A LAN is a wired system and not Wireless. It sounds as though you have a modem that has not got a router. You say you have not connected a router but this is the very device that make the system wireless.

SJM0rzHtaa	A few suggestions..<br>  <br>  Go through your motherboard BIOS and see if you can:<br>  <br>  - Enable video ROM caching (some BIOS might call this ROM shadowing).  This loads Video ROM into your computer's system RAM for faster access.<br>  <br>  - Crank up AGP memory aperture to as high as it will go.<br>  <br>  - Initialize AGP first.<br>  <br>  - Disable PCI Palette snoop.<br>  <br>  You might also want to tune your other BIOS settings for performance.<br>  <br>  As far as the hardware is concerned, IIRC the AGP HD3650 needs to have a 4-pin power supply molex plugged into it.  If it has a 4-pin molex plug and it's not connected, the card will run very slow.  So make sure all the necessary connections are in place.<br>  <br>  Then you might need to play around with different versions of the drivers.  I find that the latest Catalyst drivers for some reason don't like AGP cards.  I have an HD3450 AGP in my HTPC and I have absolutely no luck getting the latest Catalyst to work with it, but it works splendidly with the driver that came on the CD included with the card.  Go figure.<br>  <br>  Good luck, and once you get that card up and running properly I'm sure you will have a better experience.|`|wiJz0FYLaa	Maybe your overclocks are too high and/or cooling is insufficient, causing the CPU to throttle down and decrease performance. Maybe your PSU cannot keep up with the o/c.<br>  <br>  So run it at stock and see if the problem still persists.<br>  <br>  Could also be bad RAM that is causing the stuttering.<br>  <br>  For a software solution, this is my usual routine:<br>  Assuming you have no hardware issues, do this:<br>  <br>  (1) Run a FULL anti-virus scan with a good virus scanner. Get free editions of AVast or Antivir. Use the latest virus definitions file. But don't install or run more than one anti-virus at the same time.<br>  <br>  (2) Run anti-spyware scans with Spybot S&D and malwarebytes.<br>  <br>  (3) Ensure all Microsoft security updates are applied.<br>  <br>  (4) Run disk cleanup to delete old temp files and other junk<br>  <br>  (5a) Run chkdsk once to scan for file system errors. <a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/315265" rel="nofollow">http://support.microsoft.com/kb/315265</a><br>  <br>  (5b) Run  a thorough disk defrag. Use a good defragmenter for this, and also run a boot-time defrag to fix the MFT and page file if they are fragmented. You can check out Diskeeper 2009, which is widely acknowledged to be the best defragger around. Their website has free 30-day trial versions. <a href="http://www.diskeeper.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.diskeeper.com</a><br>  <br>  (6) Disable unnecessary background processes and services that take up memory.<br>  <br>  (7) Make sure all the hardware components have the latest and most stable drivers. Video card performance in particular is strongly dependent on drivers.<br>   <br>  Good Luck!

If the file system is consistent through out then it should be an option to install to another partition. In any event, even if the install is done to another partition the links will still live on the primary under windows. That is just the way it is due to the registry. If you boot to one of the other partitions, then an install can be effected from there.  Once in that partition that becomes the primary and the drive letters get shuffled. That is to say what was say "D" will become "C" and the drive letters get remaped.|`|WWxGAzYgaa	When you install a program, select to install it manually or 'custom'. Then redirect the installation to your other partition. Maybe create a folder in it either called "Programs" or "Program Files" first. If you want to move some existing programs, the easiest way would be to uninstall them first then reinstall them and redirect the installation to the new file folder on the other partition. Some of the files will still end up on your C drive, (like drivers in system32 folder), but at least the bulk of them will be on the other partition.

We were all novices when we started. I only meant that at your age NOT many of your friends will have MACS and for that reason you will not be able to work our computer problems together.<br>  <br>  Let me give you an example.    A friend of mine had a Mac and joined out computer club but he was the only member who had a Mac and he foundit very frustating.  A Mac is a wonderful machine BUT itis VERY different from a PC.  Every time we accessed a new application he had nobody to help him and in the end he quit the club. I felt bad for him.<br>  <br>  Your Dad probably thinks that an ordinary PC which is HALF the price by the way would be better for you at this time.  Even it is your own money you can get a nice PC laptop with 2 gigs Ram,3Mhz processor and 250HD with duocore for under $400.<br>  <br>  A Mac with these specs will cost you at least $800.<br>  <br>  And that is only half the story.  Microsoft is right at the point of bringing out a new WINDOWS and pasing out VISTA which has too many problems.  ANYBODY buying a computer these days should be very careful not to be caught having to upgrade in a year.<br>  <br>  Finally, let me ask you?   Can you get instruction for a MAC in your school or your area?  In my own case it took me a full year's classeson computers to become proficient in all the applications and programs I needed like Publisher, Excel, Access, Frontpage and Word.<br>  <br>  So I've tried to mention a few reasons why your Dad might be right in suggesting a cheaper computer just for now.<br>  <br>  I just bought an IBM Think Centre XP duocore for one of my kids.

Then he will probably start asking lots of questions about it to make sure you know what your buying, so make sure you have your facts straight.

This rogue is advertised by the Vundo Trojan and is replacing the Antivirus 2009 rogue program that Vundo has been aggressively advertising. If you are infected with the Vundo Trojan you will see a large amount of pop-ups stating that your computer is infected and that you should install Antivirus 360 in order to protect yourself. If you click on the ad, Antivirus 360 will be downloaded to your computer and you will be prompted to install it.<br>  <br>  Once installed, Antivirus 360 will be configured to start automatically when you start Windows. Once started, the program will perform a scan, and when done, will list a variety of legitimate or nonexistent files as infections that cannot be removed unless you first purchase the program. What is so dangerous about these scan results is that the files that Antivirus 360 states are infections are actually legitimate Microsoft files, that if deleted, will cause Windows to become unusable. Therefore, if someone believes the results from this program they may manually delete the files thinking they are infections and cause their computer to no longer function. Some files that it states are infections are:<br>  <br>  C:\Windows\System32\svchost.exe<br>  C:\Windows\System32\alg.exe<br>  <br>  While running you will also see a constant barrage of false security alerts stating that your computer has a variety of security risks. These risks range from files being modified to private data being sent to a remote host. These alerts, though, are false and are only being shown to further scare you into thinking your infected, when in fact the Antivirus 360 program is the actual infection. Unfortunately, these alerts coupled with the Vundo Trojan will affect your computer's performance and you will notice that it begins to operate slower.|`|wtVSTuSuaa	I use Malwarebytes!

Sometimes it take a long time for the youtube to upload your movie to youtube's server. But here are some things that may be causing this problem. <br>  Your video may be too large. Try uploading a smaller video if you can. <br>  Another possibility is that you have too much videos on your youtube account or too much memory on your account. Maybe consider removing some videos that are not being used. If you have less than 5 videos, this isn't a problem. <br>  Try uploading the video on youtube's site. I know iMovie can upload your video using the program iMovie. But I would first export the movie to a file (quick time format .mov) and then go on youtube's site and follow the sites instructions to uploading videos.

FZmu6Pm9aa	You need to do a clean uninstall of iTunes or the problem will continue. If you've tried the add/remove programs option and keep getting errors you should check the Apple forums for advice but you could delete everything manually and then run a registry checker program to remove all iTunes garbage from your system. Then do a new install. I'd advise checking to see if someone else is having the same problem as it may be a known bug in the software that has an easy solution.<br>  <br>  First I'd try this: open control panel and go to Admin Tools, look for Services and see if iPod Service is running. If so right click and stop it and then try to complete the uninstall. If that doesn't work then check the link below.

d3ad8545c7b9175df8ca7dc65b5c8eccaa	There are basically 2 ways, one is less drastic then the other.<br>  <br>  First way, would be to go into Safe Mode, and you do this by tapping F8 constantly during the very first screen you see when you turn on the computer usually the Dell Logo, once you have selected Safe Mode, you should see a Welcome Screen, with one account being your account, and another account called "Administrator". Click on the Administrator account. Once in this account press Windows key + R and in the Run Box type:<br>  control userpasswords2 <br>  This should allow you to reset your password.<br>  <br>  The other way of resetting your password is more drastic, and will make you lose your data. This method uses Symantec factory reset.<br>  The Dell PC Restore by Symantec shipped on all XP systems shipped by Dell on or after July 16, 2004 in the United States and on or after August 30, 2004 in Europe.  Easy enough to recognize if it does or does not.   If your system has the PC Restore partition you will see a blue bar across the top of the screen with www.dell.com right after the Dell logo and before Windows XP begins booting.<br>   <br>  What it does is restore your Dell to its "as-shipped" condition.  It's like taking it out of the shipping box all over again.  It totally clears your hard drive of any programs you have installed and any documents, music, pictures and other data you have saved on the drive since you purchased it.<br>   <br>  The procedure is similar for Windows Vista, but you use the F8 key to access the Vista Factory Image. For Dell Symantec, you must at the first boot screen hold Ctrl and numerously hit F11 to start Symantec.<br>   <br>  Other PC manufacturers use similar methods to restore their machines to their "as-shipped" condition.  HP/Compaq, Gateway/eMachines, Sony and IBM have some form of PC Restore.  I recently restored access to a factory image on an older IBM Netvista machine so that it was back to its "as shipped" condition.  Similar to Dell, but uses a different keystroke sequence at power on.<br>   <br>  I cannot emphasize strongly enough that you back up all your data before using the PC Restore by Symantec.  Once you start the restore, your existing data is gone.<br>   <br>  If you cannot boot your system, and you need to backup existing data, let us know.  Hope this info helps.<br>   <br>  Most of us here recommend the PC Restore only as a last resort to get a system back up.  XP is a pretty resilient system, and there are specific ways to "repair" it when it will not boot.  Also, there are numerous ways to backup data even when the drive will not boot up.<br>  <br>  If you have anymore questions about my answer, please contact me and I will gladly continue to help you.<br>  Have a nice day<br>  Ken|`|vo42ZRPdaa	XP or vista?<br>  did you make your password recovery disks?<br>  you may need to FORMAT the pc and start over

Even though the duo has a higher clock rate the quad has two more cores. Think of it as adding two more engines to your machine. The quad has four cores with it can process different information through and the duo only has two cores so it has to process more information per core compared to the quad. For the best you should upgrade to a core i7. However, you would also have to upgrade your motherboard as well, so if you just want to upgrade then go for it.|`|7DpZgDCfaa	the 2.7 ghz duo core is better. the more parts (duo, quad) just provides priority for certain applications based on which part. for gaming, priority wont matter that much. so go with the faster one.

I think its incompatible RAM, bad RAM, or you just need to manually set the parameters for the RAM.<br>  Try manually setting the voltage of the RAM and the speed and different combinations of RAM in the DIMM slots.

I've also got good computers that I just built out of new hardware.<br>  <br>  So, you aren't providing nearly enough information.<br>  <br>  Good enough for what?  If you examine a netbook, you are looking at a computer with a 1.6 ghz single core processor with 512mb or RAM and a 60gb hard disc.. that's equal to a laptop of 4 years ago... and these are the brand new netbooks that are being sold today.  So, it all depends on what you want to do with the computer.<br>  <br>  If you want to surf, check email, play music and videos, and maybe watch DVDS... guess what?  People were doing that 5 years ago.  So, a computer from 5 years ago is good enough for that.

It is a DRM loaded OS.<br>  <br>  Digital Rights Management.<br>  <br>  For example, if you install a perfectly legitimate and legal copy of Adobe CS3 on Windows 7, and you use an altered DLL to get rid of the update/upgrade nag screen, windows 7 will allow (without your permission) a third party to install another program that will scan your system for other alterations, disable Adobe CS3, and edit the registry so no uninstalling and reinstalling or system restore will fix the issue.<br>  <br>  SO, if you want Windows to make changes to your system against your will without your permission, then feel free to run and get a copy of Windows 7 as soon as possible.|`|plBN572qaa	i really don't get the deal with vista being so bad....i mean, i have it, and i don't have any problems on it whatsoever<br>  <br>  if i need to learn something, i just go on help by pressing F1 and ask the question....the answer comes up and your problem is fixed....<br>  <br>  i've tried XP.......and i found vista to be WAY easier to use......and look at the face it makes (weird, huh?)|`|XW4pa8Pzaa	I believe it will, but I don't believe in waiting for technology.

zorYTX59aa	Several times each day, YouTube shuts down a few of their <br>  servers to update stuff. Be patient if YouTube is slow, stuck<br>  or mangled. Transmissions from YouTube to your computer<br>  are done in multiple tiny packets of data and flash at a time. <br>  That's why sometimes you may get any of these scenarios: <br>  bits and pieces of text/thumbnails in weird places; sluggish<br>  loading/buffering; the spinning circle going on forever; or the<br>  player being blank. This problem could fix itself within a few <br>  hours or by the next day.<br>  <br>  If your YouTube continues to behave slow, stuck or strange,<br>  it's very possible that your directories of "temporary internet <br>  files" and RAM (sometimes known as "cache") are close to<br>  the maximum and just cannot take anymore, the end result <br>  being any of the above scenarios or videos that: A) come to <br>  a complete freeze; B) start/stop/start/stop in a choppy way; <br>  or C) never even make it onto your screen.<br>  <br>  "Temporary internet files" are tiny bits of webpages that get <br>  permanently put on your hard-drive. They will remain forever<br>  on your computer, gradually plugging it up like hair stuck in <br>  a sink drain, until you finally get rid of them once and for all. <br>  Thus, exit out of YouTube, then clear your "cache" of all its<br>  "temporary internet files", "cookies" and "history". It is best<br>  if you shutdown and reboot afterwards. You'll be amazed at <br>  how "fresh" and "new" your YouTube will be.<br>  <br>  Note 1: if you are using Google Web Accelerator or a utility<br>  similar to that: Dump it, burn it, trash it, disable it, uninstall <br>  it. Do all that you can to get as far away from it as possible,<br>  even though this seemingly contradicts all my advice which<br>  I wrote uptop. GWA conflicts with YouTube. Clicking "Don't <br>  Accelerate This Website" will not help you whatsoever.<br>  <br>  Note 2: longer videos only require "Flash" and "Shockwave"<br>  in order to play smooth. Other than that, avoid all the sales <br>  pitches that some Yahooers may be shilling, because they <br>  are really disguised salespeople & peddlers. Their answers<br>  have nothing to do with your question, and their wares may<br>  actually worsen your problem. Besides, what kind of idiotic<br>  answer is: "Despite the fact that you can't watch or access <br>  videos properly, buy our downloader." [my paraphrase]<br>  <br>  Note 3: a very odd fix that once worked for me was altering<br>  the URL from "www.youtube.com" to simply "youtube.com" <br>  (or you could even try "ca.youtube.com").<br>  <br>  Note 4: depending on how your YouTube account is set up,<br>  your personal "video playblack quality" (or "VPQ") could be<br>  set to "dynamically" or "fast", thus making YouTube videos<br>  play at higher quality. This in turn eats up lots of bandwidth,<br>  memory and "cache". If you are "logged on" to YouTube as <br>  you're reading this, you can verify your VPQ from right here <br>  within Yahoo!Answers by clicking my link below, which will <br>  bring you directly to "YOUR VERY OWN" playback setting:<br>  <a href="http://www.youtube.com/account#playback/quality" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/account#playback/...</a><br>  Otherwise, if you must "sign in" first, click on the 4th black<br>  option which will be on the left side called "Playback Setup".<br>  <br>  Note 5: nothing about playing YouTube has changed in the<br>  past year. If anything, the newer Flash players are causing<br>  many YouTubers plenty of grief -- especially all 5 variations <br>  of version 10. It is absolutely crazy that there is a 10.0.525, <br>  10.1.218, 10.2.26, 10.2.54, and 10.12.36. Updates are only<br>  good for one thing: software/computer conflicts. Myself, I've <br>  never strayed away from 9.47, and many flashers swear by <br>  9.45.

3ece80164c2739cc39f908768c919b69aa	In order to access anything online, you have to subscribe to an Internet Service Provider, also known as an ISP. As for which ISP is the best one, it depends on your preferences. If you use the Internet a lot, which most people do, you should definately choose an ISP that offers unlimited Internet access and does not limit the amount of uploading and downloading that you can do (yes, there are some ISP's who are starting to set limits and charging users for over use). <br>  <br>  First of all, you should ditch dial up and go with DSL or Cable. If you live in an area with Cox Communications, I feel as though their cable Internet is the best that anyone has to offer. It's affordable, fast, and they offer unlimited use of the service. Best of all, it's easy to install, and you can purchase a modem and install it yourself with two simple plugs. The modems are under $50 and available at Walmart. You can also let them install it (Cox Communications), but they do charge you a fee for that. <br>  <br>  If you are going to go with DSL, then I feel like Earthlink is the best. They are reliable and inexpensive. They are consistent as well and have been around for a long time. <br>  <br>  When it comes to ISP's, it's really about preferences, but I believe that AOL and Time Warner as well as MSN are the worst ISP's available in terms of reliability, being user friendly, and customer service. Some people would disagree, but that's the conclusion that I have made over the year. <br>  <br>  When trying out a new ISP (especially when switching to cable or DSL for the first time) make sure that you don't sign a one year contract, or that if you do, you have a trial time (usually around 30 days) in which to cancel. The first time I had the Internet, I made the mistake of signing a contact with MSN, and when their Internet Service was awful, I was stuck paying for a service that I could not use, and eventually, after a long hard battle was able to regain some of my losses. <br>  <br>  As far as the content you mentioned, if you are talking about e-mail accounts or home pages such as Yahoo or AOL they are free to use. But if you wish to access them on your home computer, you will need the Internet to do so. You could always take advantage of free services and web pages and e-mail accounts on a library or friends computer without paying for an ISP if you don't use the Internet at home often.|`|KTz3qpCvaa	AIM and Yahoo are dependent on the internet, one needs to connect to your contact list through the internet and the other can only be reached with internet access. Your computer can run just fine without internet access, but you can't do anything that requires your computer to have contact with an online server.<br>  <br>  Try contacting your phone service provider, they may offer either dial-up or DSL, ask them for their prices.|`|xaaZSbnVaa	You need and ISP in order for you to go on the internet. I imagine you're still using dial-up which is why you're using the net through AOL. Upgrade to cable internet, or DSL and you won't need AOL anymore, at all. Search on google for "cable internet providers in [city, state]" that should give you a list of ISP's that cover your area.|`|fqJwOohRaa	Yes, you need an ISP (Internet service provider) in order to use any applications that require the user of Internet (which is pretty much everything in this day and age, even the operating system...).<br>  <br>  Depending on your area there are various ISPs including AT&T, Comcast, Cox.

(you can get it around $5 to $10)<br>  <br>  b) to repair your laptop --> i would suggest you go to the used computer store..they might help (usually its really cheap price for such a repair, but if you are in america,canada,or europe.. its gonna be expensive.)<br>  <br>  c) the third option, is if the repair price is too high.. just get another laptop.<br>  <br>  when you are shopping for your next laptop.. dun invest lots of money in it.. if you are gonna buy laptop that have lots of fancy stuff, buy a desktop instead.. laptop get obsolete quickly..plus you can't even upgrade it.|`|lbmrK4Qlaa	well this happened to us recently that the PC stopped recognizing that it was plugged in and we found out the cord is really sensitive and only work's at certain angles. Also over time the battery goes bad so it doesn't hold a charge for long, also your pc seems to be over heating so i would get a chill mat or something with a fan...or getting a new laptop isn't a bad idea...|`|wfTkJ6otaa	Since the computer is getting too hot, it will be the reason of shutting down itself by itself.<br>  Now, about the water, it may be it got to a critical part inside of the computer, like the motherboard, so it will be the source of all this problems you are having.<br>  <br>  I advise you to take it to a technician so he/she could check it and fix whatever is happening with it<br>  <br>  Hope this helps
fQqAWGTgaa	I got my 512mb EVGA Double slot 9600 GT for $70 from Newegg a couple of months ago.  My computer only scores 11243 with 3dMark06 though.  I mean, I can play any of these new games on the market, just not at the max settings.<br>  <br>  If you want a great card though, for a great price... grab a 9600gt.|`|x1NaGF2Saa	it's good, but you can also get the ati 4650  or 4670.. they're excellent, especially in the half-life gaming engine (counterstrike), i get about 60 fps on that! terrific cards. i got mine for 90 bucks, it's a sapphire ati 4650 512 mb, for about 150 you can find something like that, if not better. for 200 you can find the 4870 512 mb; go on newegg. all ati's 4600- and 4800-series are excellent.|`|gRO3N6aIaa	Try something like a 9500GT for not highly demanding games, if the game is extremely demanding like "Crysis" then i suggest getting a card like an 8800GTX, now they're pretty cheap while they last. ATi video cards are more for watching movies, while nVidia cards are better for gaming. But the final decison is yours. Good Luck|`|doaVZBQBaa	what type do u need AGP or PCI-e<br>  <br>  if PCI-e look below, for $100 you can get the HD3870
gHMK8TpVaa	Both of those cards are lower end models that are designed to be for budget builds. The Nvidia 9500 isn't as good as the RADEON 4830.<br>  <br>  I, personally, would buy an Nvidia GeForce 9800 GTX 512MB RAM.<br>  <br>  Check these out:<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16814130339" rel="nofollow">http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.as...</a><br>  <a href="http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16814150316" rel="nofollow">http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.as...</a>|`|ykXzzx65aa	If i were u i would get the 4830, its like a 9800GT, but u can overclock it pretty far<br>  <br>  <br>  the 4830 is an ok gaming card, it can handel all the mainstream games no problem, and can handle some Call of duty, and other games like that, but it wont play anything at a super high res|`|2vL8wOHZaa	Between those 2 cards the 4830 is a better gaming card. It is a mid range gaming card and should be able to play most of the newer games on medium settings. The 9500 GT isn't a gaming card it is more for watching DVDs and online movies. I hope this helped.|`|gRO3N6aIaa	8800GTX(very nice card, can handle anything you throw at it, limited supplies)<br>  9600GT (very close to 9500GT, slight better)<br>  9800GT(expensive)|`|SOxzD2Waaa	the 4830. if u can spare a little bit more money, then get the 4850.
gHMK8TpVaa	The type of cable you should use in this situation depends on what would be more convenient to you. Would you like the networking equipment to be close to the computer? Or would you like it somewhere else that's out of the way? A benefit to having it nearby is that you can restart the equipment rather quickly if you need to, so in that case, coax cable. If you like to keep your networking equipment in one location, then CAT-5 or CAT-6 will do the trick.<br>  <br>  As far as running the cable, I'm more of a hands-on guy, so I can't give you a specific answer. I've run cables down cold air returns, but I generally try to run them behind walls and through attics as much as possible. Keep in mind that it's important to use cables with plenum coating if you're going to be working around sources of heat.|`|sJppSbpcaa	I would go with wireless to have Internet access anywhere in a house, investing for the future.|`|FUQuGnPdaa	very bad idea if your running any type of cat5 cable in or around ducts that air flows through you need plenum rated cables that are fire proof.<br>  Why you ask if there is a fire the toxic fumes from the cables are deadly.
B7THwJxvaa	Depends on your choice and budget. Any midtower or full tower case will fit everything nicely.|`|7pAXElgSaa	its 10 bucks cheaper at newegg! every thing will fit in a mid-tower or full tower, however smaller and lighter is easyer to move around!|`|U0fjB82qaa	Are you going to add more and more "stuff"? I have an older Compaq Mid tower and it running two HDD's inside a 120g and a 300g with 2 500 g external and I've always thought it would be nice to have four 5.5 bays instead of two<br>  Two for cd and dvd burning and two bays for removable HDD's.instead of all the USB clutter. Take some time and some measurements some "full" towers are just absolutely too big some mid towers are just too small (EMACHINES)<br>  Screw it all down to a make shift wood case till you decide! it won't be pretty but you could get it all working and be using it and usually out in the open there isn't any cooling or dust problems. This way you could really take any pressure off until you make a decision.. Hell you could mount it all on a 20x20 sheet of plywood and screw it to the wall and have the ribbon/sata cables just come down to your desk for the Hdd's and CD?DVD....Just a thought
Lh4S3q53aa	haha, well maybe its just the computer! Also get rid of those programs!  You've got to many programs running durrign start up of course your comp is goign to go slow!   <br>  <br>  What are the specs on the computer itself?   Anything under 2.0Ghz processor and 1GB of ram will keep you slow forever!|`|d40398c9a237463488665e8314e9bea4aa	If you know when your computer was running well, try your "System Restore" program and return to that date. It will remove whatever problem you currently have and run as it did then..Good Luck!!

t1OSx5VOaa	E-08 means move the decimal place 8 spaces to the left (inserting zeros as necessary).<br>  <br>  So 1.57667570499915E-08 is<br>  0.00000001576675704999.<br>  <br>  The easiest way to solve this is to choose Format, Cells, and then say number, and change the number of decimals to 3.  Remember that when you report your results, a p-value of 0.000 should be reported as <0.001.

tOCESHLYaa	It sounds like Bitdefender is conflicting with something and not starting right. If you have Bit Internet Security make sure your windows firewall is off. Make sure windows defender is off. You should also contact Bitdefender support at their web site.|`|fizuyKBTaa	Bit-Defender takes up lots of ur resources so that it responds very slowly.<br>  U may choose one that is not only powerful but also small size.<br>  Why not have a try Spyware Cease? I like its easy operation and powerful protection:P|`|gUXb103Maa	You may be lagging. Try waiting a bit or open task manager and end some processes that are taking up a lot of system resources. Bitdefender is relatively new to antivirus, maybe a couple of years, and it isn't that popular. Maybe your computer needs more RAM. There are minimum requirements for antivirus softwares. Best you switch to Eset who does not make your computer lag at all! It ahs great protection. Trust me, I have seen it in front of my eyes multiple times in less than 15 seconds.|`|b6c4af7d411b31b81b993c41a9db5e1baa	You wont hurt your pc.<br>  <br>  But if it keeps giving you trouble you could try reinstalling it.<br>  <br>  Your not running 2 different realtime antivirus programs are you? If you are, uninstall 1 or the other. They are probably conflicting.
lJZ6D9dTaa	You should be fine. I consider myself a semi-serious gamer and i'm still using a 2GB kit.|`|eVIUwF1waa	yea. DDR3 is good memory 3gb is awesome dont upgrade man, trust me.
27MkQ7gXaa	you can use wordwrap()<br>  string wordwrap  ( string $str  [, int $width= 75  [, string $break= "\n"  [, bool $cut= false  ]]] )<br>  Parameters<br>  <br>  str<br>  <br>      The input string.<br>  width<br>  <br>      The column width. Defaults to 75.<br>  break<br>  <br>      The line is broken using the optional break parameter. Defaults to '\n'.<br>  cut<br>  <br>      If the cut is set to TRUE, the string is always wrapped at the specified width. So if you have a word that is larger than the given width, it is broken apart. (See second example).<br>  <a href="http://us2.php.net/wordwrap" rel="nofollow">http://us2.php.net/wordwrap</a>|`|DbmtyOBCaa	Ok I did this recently...However placing a hyphen every 40 characters is not the correct way to do a word wrap... mainly because you dont know if the 39th character is a letter, number, special character or space.<br>  <br>  Here is my solution  Ill Place a link to the script at the bottom : <br>  <br>  First you need to count the first 39 characters then check to see if the last  character is a space or a string.  if its a space then but a "<br>" or new line "\n" after it. If it is a string the go to the begining of the string and place a "<br>" or a "\n" in its place.  then place the string in front of whats left of the original string.  repeat until origanal string is less then 40 characters then add whats left to the end of the new string.<br>  <br>  Here is My Script you can use:<br>  <br>  <a href="http://variux.com/yscripts/wordwrapp.class.php" rel="nofollow">http://variux.com/yscripts/wordwrapp.cla...</a><br>  <br>  ill have it up 5 minutes from the time i make this post<br>  <br>  <br>  Ok Now Its Up with Colored Syntax and all|`|1GfvqVQAaa	hmm...<br>  <br>  I swear I just answered the same question.<br>  <br>  $hypened_string = chunk_split($string, 40, '-');<br>  <br>  Dats it brah.<br>  <br>  ~Shawn
xdlsGvldaa	Unplug the lap top, remove the battery cover and battery ( install battery and cover), remove the memory module/ram cover and check for being loose ( remove and plug back in), remove the hard drive cover and then the hard drive and plug the drive back in. Restart the lap top if it still does not power on your hard drive was damaged in the fall, replace the HD and install the operating system.<br>  Hope this helps|`|DNG1Jze9aa	hard drive failure... it seems it was damaged when it landed. Get it replaced|`|t49B5xQ2aa	Oh wow, Id tak it in to be repared. Damage is done. Sorry to say|`|dILqe7nBaa	check your hard drive and ram that they are in correctly and not loose

There are some components that can be upgraded, but in all honesty, the parts are going to cost more than they are worth.  <br>  <br>  You could increase the memory from 128M to 512M, and you may see some startup performance (a little).  You would need 2 of these:<br>  <a href="http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16820146079" rel="nofollow">http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.as...</a>  <br>  <br>  You could disable the on-board graphics, and get an add-in graphics card (AGP 1x type).  Here's one that will work:<br>  <a href="http://www.pcprogress.com/product.asp?m1=pw&pid=ATIR9700PRO128OEM" rel="nofollow">http://www.pcprogress.com/product.asp?m1...</a><br>  <br>  You only have a 1.4 Ghz Celeron processor.  You might try to find a replacement processor with a higher clock speed.<br>  <br>  200Watt power supply... you could.. *sigh*.. nevermind.<br>  <br>  Frankly, upgrading this machine is a waste of time, money, effort, and probably sanity.  Do yourself a favor and buy a new machine.<br>  <br>  Don't buy your next one from Radio Shack, and don't buy an Emachine.|`|fQqAWGTgaa	Well, you could put in a new motherboard and processor that is of a modern speed.  That would mean upgrading your RAM as well, since it is doubtful a new board will utilize your old memory.<br>  <br>  You would still have the original case, power supply, hard drive, and optical drive.<br>  <br>  Now, that optical drive is probably full of dust from having air sucked through it for those years.  It is part of the design of computer cases unfortunately, that air is sucked in through the front, and spit out the back.  And your hard drive is probably nearing or past it's expected life span.  Drives typically last 3 to 5 years if they are any good.  Anything past that is a bonus, and should not be counted on.<br>  <br>  So yeah.  Proc, mobo and RAM will make it modern in speed.|`|f1VCVKKlaa	The easiest way is to do the following in order:<br>  1.) Take out the hard drive<br>  2.) Throw away the old tower.<br>  3.) Buy a new computer<br>  4.) Put the hard drive from your old computer in the new computer.<br>  <br>  There is a 30% off deal going on at dell.com<br>  <a href="http://www.dell.com/content/products/features.aspx/desktops_great_deals?c=us&cs=19&l=en&s=dhs" rel="nofollow">http://www.dell.com/content/products/fea...</a>
fQqAWGTgaa	Ok.  Know this...<br>  "The file svchost.exe is the Generic Host Process for Win32 Services used for administering 16-bit-based dynamically linked library files (DLL files) including other supplementary support applications."<br>  <br>  Which means that svchost.exe is a program that is used to run DLLs.  So some DLL that is being loaded is having issues.<br>  <br>  Now... you are kinda boned since you can't download anything.  This is really probably caused by malware infections, which you should download a tool to clean and repair.  Since you didn't keep your key, you *can* recover it from windows... if you could download a tool like RockXP or Jellybean Keyfinder.  Then, you could pull your key from your registry, and just wipe and reinstall.  Maybe a friend will let you download those key finders, burn them to a disc or put them on a flash drive, then you can get your key, and reinstall.<br>  <br>  Or, here are two possible repairs for svchost errors.<br>  <br>  1- Go to Control Panel      <br>  2- Administrative Tools              <br>  3- Services            <br>  4- go to the following Service : ( Windows Driver Foundation - User-mode Driver Framework ) Right Click then choose Properties ----> in the start up type choose Disabled.<br>  <br>  Then reboot the system. <br>  <br>  <br>  Of course, that will only fix one specific svchost error.  You could try this...<br>  <br>  <br>  Verify Windows Update Service Settings<br>  <br>      * Click on Start, Run and type the following command in the open box and click OK<br>  <br>        services.msc<br>  <br>      * Find the Automatic Updates service and double-click on it.<br>      * Click on the Log On Tab and make sure the "Local System Account" is selected as the logon account and the box for "allow service to interact with desktop" is UNCHECKED.<br>      * Under the Hardware Profile section in the Log On Tab, make sure the service is enabled.<br>      * On the General Tab, the Startup Type should be Automatic, if not, drop the box down and select Automatic. <br>      * Under "Service Status" on the General tab, the service should be Started, click the Start button enable it.<br>      * Repeat the steps above for the service "Background Intelligent Transfer Service (BITS)"<br>  <br>  Re-Register Windows Update DLLs<br>  <br>      * Click on Start, Run, and type CMD and click ok<br>      * In the black command window type the following command and press Enter<br>  <br>        REGSVR32 WUAPI.DLL<br>  <br>      * Wait until you receive the "DllRegisterServer in WUAPI.DLL succeeded" message and click OK<br>      * Repeat the last two steps above for each of the following commands:<br>  <br>        REGSVR32 WUAUENG.DLL<br>        REGSVR32 WUAUENG1.DLL<br>        REGSVR32 ATL.DLL<br>        REGSVR32 WUCLTUI.DLL<br>        REGSVR32 WUPS.DLL<br>        REGSVR32 WUPS2.DLL<br>        REGSVR32 WUWEB.DLL<br>  <br>  Remove Corrupted Windows Update Files<br>  <br>      * At the command prompt, type the following command and press Enter<br>  <br>        net stop WuAuServ<br>      * Still at the command prompt,<br>  <br>        type cd %windir% and press Enter<br>      * In the opened folder, type the following command and press Enter to rename the SoftwareDistribution Folder<br>  <br>        ren SoftwareDistribution SD_OLD<br>      * Restart the Windows Update Service by typing the following at the command prompt<br>  <br>        net start WuAuServ<br>  <br>      * type Exit and Press Enter to close the command prompt<br>  <br>  Reboot Windows<br>  <br>      * click on Start, Shut Down, and Restart to reboot Windows XP<br>  <br>  However, it would help if you looked at your event viewer to see exactly what programs are erroring.<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  Good luck.|`|7Sql54CFaa	You can find your installation key easily  by going to<br>  <a href="http://www.magicaljellybean.com/" rel="nofollow">http://www.magicaljellybean.com/</a> and downloading keyfinder.exe.

It just depends on what kind of drive you have as to what kind of enclosure you need to get.

They actually make magnets designed specifically for the purpose of corrupting/erasing all the data on a hard drive.<br>  <br>  Finally, if you want to be absolutely sure no one can ever recover the contents of the drive (unless they're absolutely dedicated to getting information off it... I'm thinking a computer forensics team on a mission), simply drive a couple screws or nails through the hard drive's platters. Obviously, however, this will permanently destroy the drive as well.|`|xdlsGvldaa	You can not erase it if it will not start/boot up, take it out and sell with out the hard drive then destroy the drive.

zorYTX59aa	Whenever someone uploads a video to YouTube which contains<br>  copyright material by an "established" recording artist, YouTube <br>  doesn't always automatically "mute" it or "remove" it.<br>  <br>  The copyright holder, usually a music label, always has the first <br>  and final say, and usually pre-arranges it with YouTube to either<br>  <br>  A. "block" the video or mute its audio,<br>  B. "set aside" the video for review before making a final decision,<br>  C. "allow" the video for the time being (with the same conditions <br>  . . .as above),<br>  D. "track" the video (meaning allow it, but also tell us everything <br>  . . .about the uploader and the video's statistics),<br>  E. "monetize" the video (meaning put advertising alongside it so<br>  . . .that money can be generated for the copyright holder).<br>  <br>  In this particular instance, what you are seeing is a combination <br>  of options D and E along with a link to most probably the official <br>  channel of the artist.<br>  <br>  In effect, the uploader has gotten some form of permission to air<br>  the video, although that person could be a promotional company<br>  or official representative of the music label.|`|A2MAWxGEaa	When there is music or other media from another Channel, (e.g. "Contains contents from Rick Astley Official Channel") it has that music somewhere in the video.

17fc2b122418131f22f55073029bb3b5aa	Ethernet is a family of frame-based computer networking technologies for local area networks (LANs). The name comes from the physical concept of the ether. It defines a number of wiring and signaling standards for the Physical Layer of the OSI networking model, through means of network access at the Media Access Control (MAC) /Data Link Layer, and a common addressing format.<br>  <br>  Ethernet is standardized as IEEE 802.3. The combination of the twisted pair versions of Ethernet for connecting end systems to the network, along with the fiber optic versions for site backbones, is the most widespread wired LAN technology. It has been in use from around 1980 to the present, largely replacing competing LAN standards such as token ring, FDDI, and ARCNET.<br>  <br>  Ethernet was originally developed at Xerox PARC in 1973–1975. In 1975, Xerox filed a patent application listing Robert Metcalfe and David Boggs, plus Chuck Thacker and Butler Lampson, as inventors (U.S. Patent 4,063,220 : Multipoint data communication system with collision detection). In 1976, after the system was deployed at PARC, Metcalfe and Boggs published a seminal paper.<br>  <br>  The experimental Ethernet described in that paper ran at 3 Mbit/s, and had 8-bit destination and source address fields, so the original Ethernet addresses were not the MAC addresses they are today. By software convention, the 16 bits after the destination and source address fields were a packet type field, but, as the paper says, "different protocols use disjoint sets of packet types", so those were packet types within a given protocol, rather than the packet type in current Ethernet which specifies the protocol being used.<br>  <br>  Some early varieties<br>  10BASE5: the original standard uses a single coaxial cable into which you literally tap a connection by drilling into the cable to connect to the core and screen. Largely obsolete, though due to its widespread deployment in the early days, some systems may still be in use. <br>  10BROAD36: Obsolete. An early standard supporting Ethernet over longer distances. It utilized broadband modulation techniques, similar to those employed in cable modem systems, and operated over coaxial cable. <br>  1BASE5: An early attempt to standardize a low-cost LAN solution, it operates at 1 Mbit/s and was a commercial failure. <br>  <br>  10Mbit/s Ethernet<br>  10BASE2 (also called ThinNet or Cheapernet): 50-ohm coaxial cable connects machines together, each machine using a T-adaptor to connect to its NIC. Requires terminators at each end. For many years this was the dominant Ethernet standard 10 Mbit/s. <br>  10BASE-T: runs over four wires (two twisted pairs) on a Category 3 or Category 5 cable. A hub or switch sits in the middle and has a port for each node. This is also the configuration used for 100BASE-T and gigabit Ethernet. 10 Mbit/s. <br>  FOIRL: Fiber-optic inter-repeater link. The original standard for Ethernet over fibre. <br>  10BASE-F: A generic term for the new family of 10 Mbit/s Ethernet standards: 10BASE-FL, 10BASE-FB and 10BASE-FP. Of these only 10BASE-FL is in widespread use. <br>  10BASE-FL: An updated version of the FOIRL standard. <br>  10BASE-FB: Intended for backbones connecting a number of hubs or switches, it is now obsolete. <br>  10BASE-FP: A passive star network that required no repeater, it was never implemented <br>  <br>  Fast Ethernet<br>  Main article: Fast Ethernet<br>  100BASE-T: A term for any of the three standard for 100 Mbit/s Ethernet over twisted pair cable. Includes 100BASE-TX, 100BASE-T4 and 100BASE-T2. <br>  100BASE-TX: Uses two pairs, but requires Category 5 cable. Similar star-shaped configuration to 10BASE-T. 100 Mbit/s. <br>  100BASE-T4: 100 Mbit/s Ethernet over Category 3 cabling (as used for 10BASE-T installations). Uses all four pairs in the cable. Now obsolete, as Category 5 cabling is the norm. Limited to half-duplex. <br>  100BASE-T2: No products exist. 100 Mbit/s Ethernet over Category 3 cabling. Supports full-duplex, and uses only two pairs. It is functionally equivalent to 100BASE-TX, but supports old cable. <br>  100BASE-FX: 100 Mbit/s Ethernet over fibre. <br>  <br>  Gigabit Ethernet<br>  Main article: Gigabit Ethernet<br>  1000BASE-T: 1 Gbit/s over Category 5e copper cabling. <br>  1000BASE-SX: 1 Gbit/s over fiber. <br>  1000BASE-LX: 1 Gbit/s over fiber. Optimized for longer distances over single-mode fiber. <br>  1000BASE-CX: A short-haul solution (up to 25 m) for running 1 Gbit/s Ethernet over special copper cable. Predates 1000BASE-T, and now obsolete. <br>  <br>  10-gigabit Ethernet<br>  The 10-gigabit Ethernet family of standards encompasses media types for single-mode fibre (long haul), multi-mode fibre (up to 300 m), copper backplane (up to 1 m) and copper twisted pair (up to 100 m). It was first standardised as IEEE Std 802.3ae-2002, but is now included in IEEE Std 802.3-2008.<br>  <br>  10GBASE-SR: designed to support short distances over deployed multi-mode fiber cabling, it has a range of between 26 m and 82 m depending on cable type. It also supports 300 m operation over a new 2000 MHz·km multi-mode fiber. <br>  10GBAS|`|7Sql54CFaa	Ethernet is a protocol, or agreed-upon set of instructions that computers and communications equipment use to talk to each other.<br>  <br>  Ethernet cables usually have an associated CAT # that simply tells how high a data rate (speed) the wire can support.

ejodXS5naa	They are very fundamentally different.  A super computer is simply a fast regular (or classical) computer.  It can do the sorts of things that a classical computer can, it just has a faster processor or (more processors), so it does it faster.<br>  <br>  A quantum computer, on the other hand, handles information in a different way.  Instead of being restricted to simple 0's or 1's of classical computers (bits) they have the ability to work with 0's, 1's, and 0's AND 1's AT THE SAME TIME.  This ability to have a bit be both 0 and 1 simultaneously requires superposition, which is a phenomena at the heart of quantum mechanics.  This ability also gives quantum computers a kind of massive multiparallelism that is not achievable for classical computers.  In fact, 300 quantum bits (or qubits) have the ability to be in more states simultaneously then there are atoms in the universe.  However, despite all this massive multiparallelism, there is a big problem with quantum computers, and that is the read out or measurement of qubits.  This kind of destroys the functional advantage of multiparallelism for all but a few types of problems.  That is to say quantum computers are only good at a very small number of problems, the main ones being factoring and unstructured search.  For almost all other problems (addition, graphics, etc) a classical computer will be as good as a quantum computer.  But for these few problems that are better on quantum computers, it is important to point out that the benefit is not in the operating speed.  A quantum computer is not intrinsically faster at computing, the operations are no faster (and probably quite a bit slower).  The reason a quantum computer is better is simply because it is more efficient, meaning that for really big problems that take many operations to solve, a classical computer would take many many more operations than a quantum computer would on these few select problems.  Therefore, even though a quantum computer does not manipulate information any faster, since it requires less steps in solving the problem, it can solve problems faster overall.<br>  <br>  And there is another problem with quantum computers.  They are very hard to make.  No one has made a useful quantum computer to date, and we are probably decades away from having a useful quantum computer (if we ever will).<br>  <br>  So the overall answer to your question is that right now, supercomputers are much faster and they exist.  In several decades, we may have a quantum computer.  That quantum computer will never replace a super computer because there are many (most) types of problems that a super computer will be able to do better.  But for a few types of problems (factoring) a quantum computer will require so many fewer steps to solve that it will beat the pants off the super computer.  But again, only for those very specific types of problems.<br>  <br>  By the way, factoring is an important problem because our public key cryptosystems are based on the inability of classical computers to efficiently factor large numbers.  If you had a quantum computer that can efficiently factor large numbers, you could break those cryptosystems.  That means that it would no longer be safe to send you credit card number on an encrypted lie over the internet and that top secret communications between government entities would no longer be secure.  So obviously there are lots of people who want quantum computers.

f7YMjK8Faa	If your internet is not working, that could be from a number of things.  First check to make sure your wireless is on.  Then, if you are at home, using wireless perhaps, reset your modem and router.  Then make sure you have a network connection on your laptop.  Save the settings for the wireless network and then reset your computer.  If this does not work, there is always the possibility that your internet provider is simply having problems.  <br>  <br>  As far as the blue screen, if you're running any Vista os, then you should have automatic system restore points as well as a factory reset.  So from this point, go to "start", "all programs", and then "recovery manager" .  Or you can search for system restore which is under the windows defender category in the control panel.  Now, you can choose a previous system restore point (choosing one before the problem occurred) or start from the factory settings which prompts you to create a backup "system recovery files", but you need a external/portable hard drive depending on how much space you have on your laptop.  <br>  <br>  if you are running windows xp, then you can also run system restore, however the system restore points aren't automatic like in vista, so this would depend on if you originally set up a restore point or schedule.<br>  <br>  If you cannot restore for some reason, you may want to get familiar with torrents and download a client such as uTorrent, Bitorrent, or azureus.

C2aWncmkaa	This is a common malware trick.  The malware site has taken over your Internet Explorer window with a script.  There is malware out there that reads people's email contacts when they log into their email service and the malware then sends copies of itself out to all the names in the contact list.  You got a malware chain letter from someone who might not know their computer has been compromised.  Your computer too might be compromised.<br>  <br>  When that happens, to shut it out you will have to close the entire window that the malware has taken over.  You do not want to click anything in Internet Explorer because the malware controls the window.<br>  <br>  Press the Ctrl Alt Del keys at the same time.<br>  <br>  Task Manager will open.  Click the tab labeled Applications if it is not the front one.<br>  <br>  Find the line for the Internet Explorer window that contains the malware and click that line to select it.<br>  <br>  Click the button "End Task"<br>  <br>  Then unplug from the Internet and run your anti-malware software.<br>  <br>  The criminals that create and distribute this malware create websites that look legitimate but are really traps.  They hack into legitimate websites (sometimes it is an inside job) and plant a web page with a trap.  They put malware code into videos and music and upload them to YouTube and other video-sharing websites.  They put malware with names of legitimate software on the torrents and warez and pirate websites hoping people greedy for free copies of commercial software will try to install the software and thereby contaminate the greedy suckers' machines.|`|UdICTUnaaa	here is the malware remover from windows, (will most definately get rid of your malware) <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/details.aspx?FamilyID=AD724AE0-E72D-4F54-9AB3-75B8EB148356&displaylang=en" rel="nofollow">http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/detai...</a><br>  <br>  but its good to have this windows defender program too and scan ur pc about once a week. it got rid of a virus i had been fighting for months on the first scan<br>  <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/details.aspx?displaylang=en&FamilyID=435bfce7-da2b-4a6a-afa4-f7f14e605a0d" rel="nofollow">http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/detai...</a><br>  run full scans|`|eTLG23N4aa	Looks like you have a common malware infection.

Whereas, manual removal is free and can be accomplished without downloading any program.

PpnsOjw2aa	AVG has three options when it detects a virus. You can store it in your virus vault, heal it or delete it.<br>  <br>  Deleting will delete it directly after scanning although some viruses multiple if you delete them so I do not recommend to use the delete tool.<br>  <br>  Healing is hard to explain in computer terms so i'll explain in a 'human' way. For example, say if you have a cut in your leg and it becomes infected, it is now a virus, it can be spread. The heal tool, will heal the cut and stop it from spreading.<br>  <br>  Putting the virus in the vault will seal the virus into a box like a treasure chest to stop the virus from doing anything else. It will make the virus dormant (like the box has no oxygen to allow virus to live). <br>  <br>  When you delete the contents in your virus vault, they will be removed 'safely' unlike the normal delete tool. Deleting files in the virus vault will only delete the ones in the virus vault, not on your computer. You need to do a computer virus scan to do that.<br>  <br>  Hope this helped.|`|tTUoqOs3aa	Yes. The infections will be removed from your computer. Those are only quarantined in the Virus Vault so that you may restore those files in case your computer malfunctions without them.|`|hCpqhn27aa	It will.

6Djqii7Xaa	Is the wireless router protected? If the other person has that wireless defined and the access key, then they will be able to connect and you won't.<br>  <br>  Another issue might be the way the connections are managed on the two computers. Some are managed via Windows, and some have their own managers from the computer manufacturer. They may select the network connections differently. For example, if the other user has previously connected to that network and told his connection manager to remember the settings, then it may give priority to that network over stronger signals because it recognizes it from a previous session. That may well be why yours has a preference for the weaker signal over the stronger one. Perhaps you previously used the weaker wireless network and your connection manager prefers it.<br>  <br>  Without more specific details, that is about all I can offer at this point.

The scanned item will load onto your printer software which is on your computer or it may open in a Windows program depending on  your computer. <br>  <br>  Scanning is basically like copying, except the image that is scanned won't print, it'll print onto your computer screen.<br>  <br>  2.

Aperture is a great program, but it's not the same type of program as say Adobe's Photoshop.<br>  <br>  Aperture and Lightroom (adobe's answer to aperture) are programs that sort your files, convert them to other formats and do general things for quick photo fixes. You can get really into the editing with these programs if you spend time doing it.<br>  <br>  Adobe's suite of software is expensive and powerful. A lot of people will tell you it's simply the best, and yah it's powerful and absolutely great, but it isn't everyone's answer to photo editing and manipulation. I use Corel Painter 9.5 and Elements 4.0 (yah it's an old version, but it was free). Corel Painter is an illustration program, and Elements is a very basic version of Adobes photoshop. Between those two programs and aperture, I can pretty much do everything I really need. The average user doesn't need Adobe's CS, but if you have the money and know you'll need all of it's capabilities down the road, go for it. Before you do that though, be sure you check out a few other great programs (good bang for the buck). Corel's Paint Shop Pro, Essentials 7.0 (pretty sure that's the current version). The two of those programs will run you way less money, and are almost as capable as Adobe.<br>  <br>  To save you another question if you go with Adobe's CS4, don't bother with extended unless you really need the high end extreme stuff like 3d rendering? Photoshop CS4 is cheaper and does have all the stuff most people need.<br>  <br>  Anywho, check out the macforums, you'll find a lot of good info there. Do searches for things like "workflow" "aperture or lightroom" "do i need adobe CS" etc|`|4MYWPD9Yaa	Try out Seashore:<br>  <a href="http://seashore.sourceforge.net/" rel="nofollow">http://seashore.sourceforge.net/</a><br>  <br>  It's a Mac-native version of GIMP.|`|xDy2KIocaa	If you're doing simple stuff like cropping and resizing, then you can do all of that in iPhoto.

Irdj2KAFaa	Do you mean how can you add a reference to your project? <br>  <br>  If you added the assembly to the GAC by drag-&-drop, or using Microsoft's Gacutil.exe, then you won't find the assembly in the IDE references dialog.<br>  <br>  Within Visual Studio .NET, you'll need to add an assembly reference by browsing for it on your local drive.<br>  <br>  After you've added the assembly reference to your project, you simply add your 'using' statements, such as, "using System.IO.Compression;"... etc, at the top of your code file.<br>  <br>  Then you can implement all the assembly's functionality.<br>  <br>  Happy coding.|`|0LfW7NbVaa	JAVA Tutorials-<br>  <a href="http://javatutorial.info/" rel="nofollow">http://javatutorial.info/</a>
vLAakLfjaa	well it depends on the code. If you bought the copy of Windows XP and your trying to use it on 2 computers it will lock into the "trial" mode and will work for only 30 days before you have to activate it by calling them i believe. Ive had this happen to me so I know... but i didn't call them, i just downloaded a newer version service pack 3 (but dont tell anyone lol)...BUT if you got the code online which you can google for, it might work for several computers (thats what i have right now and it has been installed on 3 PC) <br>  <br>  Hope this helps<br>  -comwiz|`|ySKsOfIMaa	You can use a Windows XP key a total of three times before it will quit activating online. At this point you will have to call Microsoft and possibly explain to a customer service representative why you want another activation.

It sounds like something is telling your computer do do something that it doesn't want to do. <br>  do you get any error messages before it restarts like remote procedure call, or error codexxxx. ?<br>  <br>  When you reinstalled xp did you also install the service packs.1, 2, and 3, and other updates from Microsoft?  they fix a wide variety of security related problems plus more.  if you haven't try to install them.  If you can start them before your computer shuts down than they will resume on start up.  you might have to click the icon at the bottom of your screen but if it works don't open any other internet windows until it is done.  Hope this helps.<br>  <br>  If it was a hardware problem than it would restart all of the time nit just when you hook it up to the internet.  Try hooking up another computer through the modem If it dose the same thing than it is definitely a modem problem.  what kind of connection do you use?

1384db91df3d3d0522dfddecce4bed11aa	*edit* <br>  I think it really depends on how many actually reports or flags the videos, and who happened to see it. If someone thinks it's hilarious they will probably not report it.It's crazy that there are so many that are actually violating copyright as well, yet manage to stay on for a long time, sometimes even years. It's very difficult to stop people. Even if it's really bad---hundreds of people will always see it before it's removed. I think they also don't notice or ignore because a certain number of users have to actually view the video---the same users for example could view it numerous times each.<br>  *edit*<br>  It's not a silly subject :)<br>  It's a good question.

You may have simply hit the limit for the amount of RAM your motherboard can take. Also, your motherboard may not be able to handle a 1GB stick of RAM - 1GB of total RAM maybe, but not 1GB all on one stick.<br>  <br>  Edit: That's interesting. It shows your laptop can take up to 2GB of RAM, so it should work in theory. You might try reseating the RAM or swapping the sticks around. Worst-case scenario, your new RAM simply isn't compatible - online utilities aren't always 100% accurate, after all. If this is the case, the numbers you need to look for when picking out a different set are that it's DDR2, and running at 533MHz.<br>  <br>  Edit edit: Also, one of your sticks may simply be defective and not registering. Try pulling one stick out and turning it on. If it boots and still registers 512MB, take that stick out and try the other one.
