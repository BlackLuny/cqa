The most common period of time is anywhere from 3-30 days, depending on your metabolism and the amount of marijuana that youve smoked also the potency of THC. This is unfortunate, since it means that while most drug tests can only turn up evidence of other drugs if youve been taking the drug within a few days of the drug test, marijuana could still be detected in a urine test up to a month after the last time it is used. If you smoke it occasionally it will remain in your system for up to 10 days. If you smoke marijuana on a regular basis it will stay in your system for as long as 45 days, and if you smoke marijuana at a constant pace, it can stay in the body for 90 days, Marijuana is fat soluble. It stores in the fat cells of the body, the brain, the liver, the kidneys, in other words the major organs.     Hair tests are even worse, since your body stores THC in the hair follicles. For this reason, the previous answers to How long does marijuana stay in your system? are only useful if youre going to be forced to take a urine test. For the hair test, depending on the amount of hair that the company takes, its possible that marijuana could be detected up to three years after the last time that you smoke.|`|571c197253c5d436479f389f4de71583aa	28 day to get rid of thc

Add the olive oil and Sofrito. Stir-fry the Sofrito for 2-4 minutes until lightly golden. Add the gandules, tomato sauce, Sazon packet, half cup of the water and the salt. Stir well, cover and simmer on medium low heat while you wash the rice Wash the rice in cool water rinsing continuously until the water is no longer cloudy Add the rice to the Dutch oven, mix well and raise the heat to high. Add the remaining cup and a half of water to the rice and stir with a large cooking spoon until just combined. At this point you will need to make sure that you have enough water in the pot. You can do this by inserting a tablespoon  in the middle of the pot, if it falls over slowly, you have enough water. If it falls too quickly, you have too much; remove small amounts of the water repeating the spoon method until the spoon slowly falls over. If the spoon stands at attention, add more water or the rice will be al dente and not soft and fluffy, which is what we’re going for. The rice will begin to cook rapidly at this point. The sauce combined with the high heat will cause some of the rice to stick to the bottom of the pan so you must monitor the rice closely, stirring, almost folding with the large spoon often so as to reduce as much of the sticky rice as possible. Once the water has been consumed by the rice, lower the heat to low, pile the rice in a nice mound getting as much as you can away from the sides of the pot, cover with aluminum foil and the Dutch oven lid and cook for 20-25 minutes. <br>   Arroz con gandules goes with any type of meat or vegetable

Then I throw in some chopped chicken or pork (already cooked) and heat that through.  Once everything's nice and hot, I throw in the left over rice, bean sprouts and some soy sauce.  Make sure to cover the wok at this point because the rice needs to absorb the moisture or it stays crunchy.

N6Oq5QcVaa	In general, most gas grills (the ones with a gas tank on the side or underneath) are liquid propane which can be refilled at various places. More recently many grills are available for natural gas which is the same gas line that supplies your house for your gas stove and/or oven.<br>  <br>  The advantages of natural gas are numerous: 1) natural gas burns cleaner, better for your heath and the environment, 2) natural gas is less expensive per BTU than propane, and 3) natural gas never runs out (unless the gas company goes out of business!) so you don't have to worry about refills or running out of fuel in the middle of a party.<br>  <br>  The disadvantages of natural gas are that you do have to have your grill installed in a location which has a natural gas line nearby. If you don't have one already in your backyard then you will need a professional to install one.<br>  <br>  Beware, you can't just plug your propane grill into your natural gas line! The regulators for the two fuels are completely different. You won't get enough heat out of your grill if you do this. You need a grill which is either specifically designed for natural gas or you can buy conversion kits which have a regulator which increase the flow of fuel to your grill so that you can use it with a natural gas line. If in doubt, ask a professional to check it out and install it for you.|`|6vKjxn0Xaa	I think propane gas is the only gas used for grilling.|`|ecd46de3f5db92b6d26c258002cf6b8faa	Propane is the most common but some have natural gas but most of it is installed professionally.|`|053a531df599f487ea4c2826a4cc7233aa	Propane gas is available in different size containers - basically there are 2 popular sizes though, 20 pounds and 16.4 ounces.  They connect to different size grills with different mechanisms.  This, along with natual gas, are the other gasses used for grills.  Natural gas grills are GREAT and much cheaper than the propane alternatives, but typically with natural gas grills, you cannot move the grill - it is installed and isn't mobile like a propane-gas grill.

I think one brand name for them is Nik L Nip. Then we went to Wal-mart and got party favor toys to put in with them.

GicN1B2raa	As of right now, any establishment that allows smoking can still do so. The smoking ban in Allegheny County was to take effect this week, but 14 hours after it started, the ruling was temporarily put on hold. The state courts put this hold on the ban because of the smoking ban exemption given to the casinos being built. However, I do not frequent strip clubs, so as to if and where you can smoke is beyond me. Even if the ban is reinstated, businesses with less than 10 employees and less than 10% in revenue from food sales are exempt. The only establishments who have received these waivers are in the link below:<br>  <a href="http://www.achd.net/smokingban/waiver.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.achd.net/smokingban/waiver.ht...</a><br>  But, for now, smoking is still permitted in Allegheny County at least until a final decision is met. But, like I said, this would depend on the establishment and I can not help you with that information. I am sure they allow it, but I am unaware of any restrictions placed. There are probably different restrictions at every club.|`|G7dvZtAZaa	Planning to indulge all your vices tonight?|`|fKltcE4Kaa	THEY MUST if they allow STD-infested whores to be ridden.|`|uUJqfj3Daa	Well that all depends because of the no smoking act that just happened some mayors are making there towns or cities no smoking it is up to the state to choose if it wants to go smoking or not smoking but ive been to places where they didnt allow smoking at all and ive been to places where they just do it in certain areas and others ive seen you can smoke where ever you want. it all really comes down to the owner of the place you gatta understnad one thing that if the go non smoking on there property they get a nice kickback at hte end of the year from the federal government so it all depends on who wants the tax rightoff

Beat 2 minutes on medium speed or by hand. Scrape sides and bottom of bowl frequently.  Add rest of flour and mix with spoon until flour is thoroughly blended into batter. Spread batter evenly into greased 9-by-5-inch loaf pan. Batter will be sticky.  Smooth out top of loaf by flouring hand and patting into shape.  Let rise in warm place until batter reaches 1 inch from top of pan. Sprinkle top with a little cornmeal.  Preheat oven to 375 degrees. Bake 50 to 55 minutes, or until done. Crush will be dark brown.

Remove from heat and add to the bowl of a standing mixer fitted with a dough hook. Proof the yeast by adding it to the warm milk and butter. Add the sugar and stir gently to dissolve. Let stand 3 minutes until foam appears. This indicates the yeast is active. Turn mixer on low and gradually add the flour. When the dough starts to come together, increase the speed to medium and add the salt and 1 egg white. Stop the machine periodically to scrape the dough off the hook. Mix until the dough is no longer sticky, about 10 minutes.   Turn the dough onto the work surface and knead for a minute or so by hand. Knead by folding the dough over itself and pushing out with the heel of your hands, not down. Rotate the dough and repeat. The dough is properly kneaded when you can pull it and it stretches without breaking. Form the dough into a round and place in an oiled bowl, turn to coat the entire ball with oil. Cover with plastic wrap or a damp towel and let rise over a gas pilot light on the stovetop or in another warm place until doubled in size, about 45 minutes. Test the dough by pressing 2 fingers into it. If indents remain, the dough is adequately risen.   Once the dough is doubled and domed, turn it out onto the counter. The act of turning out the dough naturally deflates the gas, so there is no need to aggressively punch it down. Handle the dough gently, overworking the gluten at this point will produce a dense loaf that is difficult to shape. *To form a loaf, pat the dough into a rectangle, fold the long sides to the middle then fold under the ends. Pinch the seams closed and place in a greased 9 by 5-inch loaf pan, seam side down. Make sure the dough touches all sides of the pan. Cover with plastic wrap and let rise a second time for 20 minutes or until the top of the dough is nearly level with the top of the loaf pan. Preheat oven to 350 degrees F, place a large pan on the bottom rack of the oven. Bring 3 cups water to a boil on the stove. Pour the hot water into the preheated pan to create a steam bath for the bread. This will make a crisp crust.   Slash dough down the middle of the loaf with a sharp knife to allow the steam to escape during baking. Brush the top with remaining beaten egg white and sprinkle with sesame seeds. Bake the bread for 30 to 40 minutes until crust is golden and internal temperature reads 195 degrees F when checked with an instant read thermometer. The bottom of the loaf should sound hollow when tapped. Immediately remove the bread from the pan and cool completely on a rack.|`|AA11727338	Some people on here are jerks. MG.  Talk to u l8r
4fcebd54c81e0034d801b753538cddcdaa	Pastrami is one of my favorite things in the whole wide world.    In the United States, Pastrami is made from the section of the cow called the "brisket"  which is first salted, then dried, cured with spices and then smoked.    Traditionally however Pastrami is Romanian.  Supposedly coming from the romanian word which sounds similar but is not, "pastrama" meaning to preserve.  However although we know Pastrami as beef or turkey here in this country, it originally was made with sheep and even pork.    Pastrami can be Kosher.  Kosher simply refers to the method in which the food was produced and has been approved by a rabbinical authority.  Unfortunately unless they list that it is a kosher product on the label, the product is most likely not.      So I guess some Pastrami can be kosher and some are not.|`|94a08b02dc557d9eac29139137c85226aa	if you are asking about pastrami, it is beef (cow).|`|ba044188d04383870795e394a4418a2aaa	It's smoked corned beef.

All carbohydrates are made up from sugars. There are a number of different types of sugars but in the body all carbohydrate metabolism converts sugar to glucose, our body's preferred energy source. Glucose is the main sugar present in many foods but some contain different sugars, such as fructose in fruit, lactose in milk, galactose as well as others. Most sugars are digested and absorbed and converted to glucose, some cannot be digested, we call this fiber.          What are complex carbohydrates?       Complex carbohydrates or starch are simply sugars bonded together to form a chain. Digestive enzymes have to work much harder to access the bonds to break the chain into individual sugars for absorption through the intestines.          For this reason digestion of complex carbohydrates takes longer. The slow absorption of sugars provides us with a steady supply of energy and limits the amount of sugar converted into fat and stored!     What are simple carbohydrates?         Simple carbohydrates are smaller molecules of sugar unlike the long chains in starch. For example the individual sugars themselves - glucose, fructose and galactose ( monosaccharides ), or two sugars bonded together ( disaccharides ).         They are digested quickly because the individual sugars are ready to be absorbed immediately plus digestive enzymes have easy access to the bonds in the paired molecules. You could say most of the work has been done!          Their rapid absorption increases the chances of sugar converting to fat but only if there is an abundance of energy absorbed. Foods like cake, pastry, biscuits, chocolate and too much table sugar to name a few contain lots of "empty" calories. Because our cells usually do not require that amount of energy at that time, the sugar must either be converted to glycogen ( sugar storage within cells ) or converted to fat. The cell can only store a limited amount of glycogen so in many cases simple carbohydrate loaded foods may contribute to body fat stores. This rule can change if the glycogen levels are low such as after anaerobic exercise!         Other natural foods like fruit contain naturally occurring simple sugars, however because the amount of energy is low there's less chance for sugar to be converted to fat. Plus many fruits are high in fiber which helps slow digestion again limiting the flood of sugar energy into cells when its not needed        http://biology.clc.uc.edu/courses/bio104...        There are simple carbohydrates and complex carbohydrates. Simple carbohydrates are made up of one or two sugars. Examples include glucose, fruit sugar, table sugar and the sugar found in milk. Simple sugars are found in candy and also in fruits.  Complex carbohydrates are made up of chains of three or more sugar molecules and include starchy foods. All breads, rice, pastas, potatoes, dry beans and corn are common examples of complex carbohydrates. Beans contain complex carbohydrates all by themselves and all grains, whether whole grain or processed flours are complex carbohydrates, but whole grain flours contain more bran and fiber along with the complex carbohydrates  Alternative Names:    Starches; Simple sugars; Sugars; Complex carbohydrates; Diet - carbohydrates; Simple carbohydrates    Food Sources:    Carbohydrates are classified as simple or complex. The classification depends on the chemical structure of the particular food source and reflects how quickly the sugar is digested and absorbed. Simple carbohydrates have one (single) or two (double) sugars while complex carbohydrates have three or more.    Examples of single sugars from foods include fructose (found in fruits) and galactose (found in milk products). Double sugars include lactose (found in dairy), maltose (found in certain vegetables and in beer), and sucrose (table sugar). Honey is also a double sugar, but unlike table sugar, contains a small amount of vitamins and minerals. (NOTE: honey should not be given to children under 1 year old.)    Complex carbohydrates, often referred to as "starchy" foods, include:    whole grain breads and cereals   starchy vegetables   legumes   Simple carbohydrates that contain vitamins and minerals occur naturally in:   fruits  milk and milk products  vegetables  Simple carbohydrates are also found in processed and refined sugars such as:   candy  table sugar  syrups (not including natural syrups such as maple)  regular carbonated beverages  Refined sugars provide calories, but lack vitamins, minerals, and fiber. Such simple sugars are often called "empty calories" and can lead to weight gain. Also, many refined foods, such as white flour, sugar, and polished rice, lack B vitamins and other important nutrients unless they are marked "enriched." It is healthiest to obtain carbohydrates, vitamins, and other nutrients in as natural a form as possible -- for example, from fruit instead of table sugar.
JJ6YxkAMaa	That sounds like so much fun! The hot tub, the food, the face paint and watching the game will all be fun, but one other thing you should do is nails! have everyone bring all there nail polish and have everyone do someone else's nails. But don't be boring one color, go crazy with patterns and design! (Sally hansen has new nail art pens or you could get nail brushes) Have fun with it! From zebra to cheetah to watermelon to french manicure. Have everyone bring a plain tee shirt and make "jerseys" with fabric pens and glitter glue (any craft store, even wal-mart sells them) Write your last name and "number" on the back add stripes to the sleeve write whatever you want on the front, and have all of you girls sign each others! Wear them to school the next day! When the shirts dry go outside and play FOOTBALL because there is an odd number have one person keep score first and then alternate teams so everyone gets a chance being on the same team as everyone. Take tons of pictures so if you girls are ever going through tough times just look back at all the pictures and remember the great times you had! Have a crazy fun time!|`|N6NunLGVaa	hahah me and my friends are doing the same thing! except were 13. we have guys comming (i have a twin bro so we have 2) and were going to play football there way and then our way :D lol. were also going to have our pool open so thats always funn....|`|2LOxmOnsaa	have some dress for steelers cheerleaders and other for the cardinals and whatever team loses [hopefully cardinals] then make them do some kind of dare like call someone and say something or whatever make sure to do the bet deciding and teams BEFORE the game|`|yga2DY29aa	invite a few guys it would be way more fun (no brothers)

Try checking the "whois" record for the domain next time, they are just some scumbags leeching another site's content (in this case PETA) and adding their own advertising.    I kinda hope that they are not doing it for profit - as they'd have to be really stupid to think PETA's demographic a good target for steak ads.    P.S. Have emailed a complaint to the advertiser - as I am sure they don't want to be paying for such advertising either!
047IPSovaa	  Red Velvet Cake with Cream Cheese Frosting       Printer Friendly Page    Sometimes it is hard to trace a recipe's origin. Take the Red Velvet Cake. There are many theories; some say it comes from the South, others say it originated in the North. But in actual fact all we really know is that it has been a favorite for decades, not only in the States but also in Canada. It is a very dramatic looking cake with its unusual bright red color that is sharply contrasted by a creamy white frosting. A Red Velvet Cake is really a Devil's Food Cake that has red food coloring added to it. John Mariani tells us in his book "The Dictionary of American Food and Drink" that the name 'Devil's Food Cake' is so called "because it is supposedly so rich and delicious that it must, to a moralist, be somewhat sinful."     If we look beyond the striking appearance of this cake, we will find that it has a mild chocolate flavor with a moist and tender crumb. The mild chocolate flavor comes from adding a small amount of cocoa powder to the batter and the moist and tender crumb is obtained by adding buttermilk. If you are not familiar with buttermilk it has a nice thick creamy texture with a rich tangy buttery taste that makes baked goods tender. Whereas in the past buttermilk was made from the liquid left over after churning butter, it is now commercially made by adding a bacteria to whole, skim, or low fat milk. You can make your own buttermilk by adding 1 tablespoon of white distilled vinegar, cider vinegar, or lemon juice to 1 cup (240 ml) of milk. Let this mixture stand 5 to 10 minutes before using.    Once the cake layers have been baked and cooled, I find it is best to place them in the refrigerator or freezer (for at least an hour) before frosting. This extra step makes the spreading of the frosting a much easier task as a freshly baked cake is quite fragile and when you try to spread the frosting there is a tendency for the cake to tear. Refrigerating or freezing the cake first eliminates this problem. In fact, you may want to bake the cakes the day before you need them and then you can just place the cakes in the fridge overnight to firm up. The type of frosting used on a Red Velvet Cake can vary. While I have used a Cream Cheese Frosting, other recipes often call for a 7-Minute Frosting or even a White Confectioners Frosting. Recently I found a new cream cheese frosting that I like very much and I have included it here. It still uses cream cheese but it also contains mascarpone cheese, which is an Italian cheese that is thick, buttery-rich, delicately sweet and velvety, ivory-colored cheese produced from cow's milk. Its texture is similar to that of sour cream. It is sold in plastic 8-ounce tubs and you can usually find it in specialty food stores or look in the deli section of your local grocery store. If you cannot find Mascarpone just use regular cream cheese instead. Besides the cream cheese and mascarpone, this frosting also contains whipped cream so you end up with a flavorful, soft and creamy frosting. The frosting recipe is adapted from 'The Waldorf-Astoria Cookbook' by John Doherty.         Red Velvet Cake:Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C) and place rack in center of oven. Butter two - 9 inch (23 cm) round cake pans  and line the bottoms of the pans with parchment paper. Set aside.    In a mixing bowl sift together the flour, baking powder, salt, and cocoa powder. Set aside.    In bowl of your electric mixer, or with a hand mixer, beat the butter until soft (about 1-2 minutes). Add the sugar and beat until light and fluffy (about 2-3 minutes). Add the eggs, one at a time, beating well after each addition. Scrape down the sides of the bowl. Add the vanilla extract and beat until combined.    In a measuring cup whisk the buttermilk with the red food coloring. With the mixer on low speed, alternately add the flour mixture and buttermilk, in three additions, beginning and ending with the flour.    In a small cup combine the vinegar and baking soda. Allow the mixture to fizz and then quickly fold into the cake batter.     Working quickly, divide the batter evenly between the two prepared pans and smooth the tops with an offset spatula or the back of a spoon. Bake in the preheated oven for approximately 25 - 30 minutes, or until a toothpick inserted in the center of the cakes comes out clean.    Cool the cakes in their pans on a wire rack for 10 minutes. Place a wire rack on top of the cake pan and invert, lifting off the pan. Once the cakes have completely cooled, wrap in plastic and place the cake layers in the freezer for at least an hour. (This is done to make filling and frosting the cakes easier.)    Cream Cheese Frosting: In your food processor, or with a hand mixer, process the cream cheese and mascarpone cheese until smooth. Add the vanilla and confectioners sugar and process until smooth. Transfer this mixture to a large mixing bowl.    Then, in the bowl of your electric mixer, or with a hand mixe|`|4dntstR9aa	This recipe for Better than sex cake was given to me by my sister!!! It's a family favorite and pretty easy to make!

I would say about 250 cans.|`|0HfhltzZaa	About 2 cans per person. Or 15 to 20 (2 liter ) sized bottles.|`|tmDklO54aa	If your getting the liters, I would go with about 35 or 40.

Plan that each person will have four over the 3 hours, maybe 2 sodas and 2 bottled waters.  Most people will get thirsty dancing, and after a couple of sodas will start feeling sick of them.  Bottled water is cheaper, too, if you buy it by the case at Walmart or a shopping club.

A lot of the newer coffee makers have a shut off function (for safety) where they will turn the warmer off if left on for a certain amount of time.     The thermos pots are a nice alternative if you want coffee to stay warmer longer without reheating it. In my opinion, it never tastes as good reheated. |`|AA10373027	It really depends on how much coffee they drink and how well they are able to work new gizmos.  My parents are in their 70's and can't handle too much technology.  They just needed something to make coffee when the button is pressed. You can find a basic one at Target for a pretty good price.  Check out this link, it has everything from basic to super high tech!    http://www.target.com/gp/search/ref=sr_r...|`|HWyhc5rdaa	One with a well insulated carafe.

ylJoUuMDaa	The term "butter" just means its smooth and spreadable.  No butter is used in the making of peanut butter any more than apple butter, etc..|`|KpO4UtElaa	No. most of the time they use palm oil.|`|AA10988378	no butter, it's the oil from peanuts and since it spreads like butter, so the term is same.|`|kJjBAJu4aa	The usual ingredients in peanut butter are:    Peanuts, dextrose, hydrogenated vegetable oil (cotton seed and/or grapeseed) and salt    However, you can get some brands that are all natural and only include peanuts and/or salt.    No butter:-)|`|zUxtdiBnaa	Thy just call it that because it spreads easy like some people I know.|`|Mf1anWtDaa	no.|`|tb5wIjfZaa	No Just Veg oIl . They call it peanut butter Because once it if mix spin and chopped it is charmed like butter. to get it creamy texture.
hvwp2bcVaa	I think the better question is why are you eating it?  It's not sweet like cake mix or cookie dough...maybe if you aren't pregnant you are lacking something in your diet and this is your body's way of getting you to eat something with that item in it.    like when some people say they have a craving for ice, it is really their body's way of telling them they need water  but they may dislike water so the human brain translates that need into something you do like.|`|ubofHDxPaa	It has raw eggs in it, very dangerous to eat. Stop eating it. |`|fQCygwJfaa	I guess it is making you sick since your stomach is starting to hurt.  Raw pancake was not meant to be eaten in liquid form.  If this is instant pancake mix, more than likely it already has a form of powder eggs in it.  Your stomach is probably having a hard time digesting the mixture.  Are you pregnant? Pregnant women will eat unusal foods. If not you have no excuse to keep eating like this.  Stop before it causes permanent injury to the lining of your stomach, or you may develop a ULCER.|`|AA10988378	yes from the raw dough, the raw eggs...that can make you sick and have contamination.|`|O8qdCBzLaa	It's probably expanding in your stomach from the rising action of the batter. And, your stomach stretches out making you feel very full until it processes the batter. Then you don't feel sick any more.    Still, I think that's kind of weird that you would eat something every day that makes you feel sick by doing it.
fbGv4iZ1aa	"Garlic Parmesan Marinade"                    2 Tbs. Melted Butter                  1 Tbs. Garlic Salt                  1 Tsp. Ground Pepper                 1/4 Cup Parmesan Cheese                  1 Cup Italian Dressing                  2 Tbs. Ceasar Dressing         Mix the above ingredients in a bowl. Set aside.        With a fork pierce both sides of the steak about 8-10                Creating tiny tong holes randomly on the top.             In a sealable storage bag or a container place steak and rub both sides with mixture pour remaining mixture on top and place in fridge for about 2 hours....turn and do the other side 2 hours.                You will have a tangy and zesty steak that is juicy and ohhh so good.  For a even juicier steak with mouth watering flavor.  Make the above marinade and spread on steak.   Freeze steak over night or however long.  Let thaw and marinate for 1 hour in thawed juice.  Oh my it really is good.    Well hope I helped,  I gotta go, hmmmmm..... were did I put the BBQ tongs....|`|hKlsJgVSaa	What kind of steak is it? If it is a good cut of beef don't marinate it. You will ruin it.

AA11420109	Beer really depends on what kind of mood you are in....  Watching a game with the guys at a bar - Amstel Light  Watching a game with the guys at the house - Miller Lite  Watching a game at the house with the woman - Corona  Just got off of a 14 shift at work - Corona with the top filled with Bacardi Limon  St. Patty's Day -  Smithwicks  Cinco De Mayo - Modelo Especial  Octoberfest - Hoeegardden   Cold - Sam Adams Winter Lager  Hot - Coors Light  In Between - Black and Tan  Tired - Heineken Light  Celebrating - Stella Artois (draft)  Celebrating at a frat party - Pabst Blue Ribbon (in a red plastic cup)    And the list goes on and on, but my favorite of all time, that could easily take the place of any of those would have to be...

WKKdQq2Aaa	Coffee..   Lots of Water...  Greasy food...      Sex...|`|LPtUJ5p5aa	There is no PROVEN way to sober up faster, the alcohol must run its course through your body, HOWEVER, here is what has worked for me.    Coffee, LOTS of water these two combined forces your body to process much faster, although you will feel really full.    Absorbant food also does the trick for me, lots of breads and things do the trick normally.    Figure an hour per drink to run its course through your system, but with bread, it absorbs it in your stomach and slowly releases it over time, and with coffee, and water you will pass fluid much faster, giving your body less time to absorb the alcohol.|`|Dl1uS5CLaa	COFFEE  and lots of it!|`|pK708QPOaa	Having to talk to the police    haha|`|4kBeBXOyaa	Bread and tons of water.

CMSbqweCaa	well how about making some soup? this is my homemade recipe:      Potato and roast red pepper soup    Ingredients  4 red peppers  55g/2oz butter  425g/15oz potatoes, peeled and diced to 5mm/1/3in  110g/4oz onions, diced to 1/3in dice  1 tsp salt  freshly ground pepper  900ml/1?pt home-made chicken stock or vegetable stock  120ml/4fl oz creamy milk  sprigs of flatleaf parsley  roasted chillies (optional)        Method  1. Roast or chargrill the peppers for 10-15 minutes in the oven and then leave to cool in a plastic bag.   2. Peel and deseed, save the sweet juices and carefully pure the flesh with the juices. Taste and adjust seasoning if necessary.   3. Melt the butter in a heavy saucepan. When it foams, add the potatoes and onions and toss them in the butter until well coated.   4. Sprinkle with salt and a few grinds of pepper. Cover with a butter wrapper or paper lid and the lid of the saucepan. Sweat on a gentle heat for approximately 10 minutes.   5. Meanwhile, bring the stock to the boil. When the vegetables are soft but not coloured add the boiling stock and continue to cook for about 10-15 minutes or until the vegetables are soft.   6. Add the milk. pure the soup in a blender or food processor. Taste and adjust seasoning.   7. Just before serving, swirl the red pepper pure through the soup or simply drizzle on top of each bowl. Top with some snipped flat parsley. You might try adding one or two roast chillies to the pepper for a little extra buzz - serrano or jalapeno are good.|`|55vTVIxnaa	well..you can bake something or cook something..maybe like chicken or beef..:) check out recipes..:)|`|xgWf3SKxaa	eat something else...|`|OTxCCXa5aa	eat your pets|`|LQSApB5raa	MCdonalds can't go wrong there|`|bxjrkRdZaa	You could make grilled cheese with ham or whichever cold cuts you have.

31502c4099a13ff4b194118f2c724fddaa	IF this is a singles type of shindig I would go with something that is completely original. Such as a neon or glow in the dark party. Have everyone wear clothes that glow in the dark. switch out your light bulbs with the cheap black light light bulbs. turn your table into a neon feast. get a white table cloth and use glow in the dark paint and splatter it. get neon colored plastic serving ware and target or a party store and give everyone glow sticks.    or also for singles a vegas theme. turn your house into a mini casino. if you don't want real gambling going on you buy three gifts and some poker chips. at the end of the night, check everyones chips.....the top three chip winners get a gift.    However if this is a couples theme:     Have an era party. Pick a decade and everyone must dress accordingly.    Have a wine and cheese tasting. do a little research of what wine goes with what and set out food that goes with your wine choices.    Have a party based on a different country. Example: I picked Egypt one time. Everyone dressed Egyptian. I made an Egyptian food table and maybe research a few games that ancient Egyptians played and try to recreate or play a modernized version of it.    Have a board game party. Everyone dresses up as a game character or piece and you guys play games!       Have a murder mystery party! so much fun but needs a little time to plan I do them and have a blast. here is a link  http://www.host-party.com  http://www.dinnerandamurder.com  http://www.mymysteryparty.com/  http://www.murdermysteryparty.com/        Anything goes!

l2BjWA5Baa	Soggy french toast probably has more to do with the bread than your cooking style - ideal french toast is made of thickly-sliced DRY bread.  In fact, in France it's referred to as "lost bread" because it's too dry to eat unless dipped in eggs and milk.  If you're a good housekeeper and don't have stale bread lying around, set the bread in the (unheated) oven or on a cooling rack so it can dry evenly overnight.  Use a sturdy bread, too - Wonderbread or another typical sandwich bread will make flimsy slices no matter how crusty they are.|`|fen79tTnaa	Its always going to be soggy no matter how long you soak it in the batter or not. It has to do with the thickness of the bread. Think about it, all restaurant french toast is usually thicker than homemade. Why? Because they use thicker toast! I would go for something similar to Texas toast. give that a try.|`|ZdeJCdCbaa	sounds like your soaking the bread too long. just dunk the bread in the egg mixture, and cook on a med-low heat. for an extra flare after you dunk the bread in the egg coat the bread with rice crispies.|`|pJIg4Ippaa	don't leave it in the batter too long...it may be soaking up too much of the liquid. When it's finished frying put it in the oven to crisp up...it's better that way!|`|AA12336927	If your using regular bread, don't let it soak to much in the egg mixture. Just put it in and flip it over then put on your griddle or in your frying pan|`|UVUYG5jaaa	maybe your soaking the bread too much? maybe your not cooking it long enough|`|AA10531094	Maybe the toast isn't dry enough.  Make sure the toast is dry and don't soak it in the batter. . . just dip it.  Good Luck!

Don't drink it to excess.  3 words---"bad things man."|`|Vj13f7zmaa	It is fine for mixed drinks.  Only the more expensive versions are worth drinking straight.  Of course you can get stupid drunk on it, even kill yourself with it.  But it is no stronger or act any different in your system than any other liquor.  |`|2zd9OjeMaa	It's a relatively low-grade tequila (at least the classic version). I like most tequilas and low-grade tequilas are generally better in terms of hangovers than low-grade vodkas of whiskies, but I'd rather have something made from 100% agave than the 51% of Cuervo Gold. I can't describe liquor taste very well, but it doesn't burn nearly as much as some other liquors. It gets you as drunk as any other 80-proof drink. I remember plenty after drinking it because I can hold my liquor, and I didn't do anything I wouldn't have done while drinking something else. |`|6HMTlQMaaa	I like it, I like others better.

Cheap tequila can get people drunk but it's one of the bad ones to puke up the next morning. I associate Jose Cuervo with college students trying to get drunk rather than people who enjoy the taste of tequila.     I always like Patron better.    A word of caution about any tequila- it hits you faster than you think. Its not like a few beers where you enjoy it and then slightly feel buzzed. No, tequila comes out of nowhere. You enjoy a sane, clear conversation and then get up to go to the bathroom and then BAM! you are the stupid one dancing on the bar. Be careful with any alcohol but especially tequila.|`|05kAf2DZaa	let me tell you something about my man jose. hes a good man  gives a great big buzz in such a tiny glass. hes wondeful to me cause he wont give me a hangover. sure, he tastes a little nasty, but it still goes down so easy!

It is the same proof as pretty much every other tequila, there's nothing special about it that will make you more drunk than anything else.

Technically yes, Mexican law only requires that a spirit be made with 51% of Agave to be called tequila. Guess what the other 49% inside a bottle of Jose Cuervo is!?! Literally a combination of the the cheapest grade alcohols, all covered up with artificial flavors and coloring.    REAL TEQUILA will always have "made with 100% agave" proudly displayed on the bottle (in Spanish "100% de Agave").    The Jose Cuervo does make some descent 100% agave tequila such as "Tradicional" good for light mixing, never straight; and the "Platino" premium Tequila which is a good siping Tequila but, because of the exagerated aging it undergoes, it takes on too much of the cask flavors and begins to take on more of a Bourbon or single malt whiskey character...    (PS: Please stay away from the Paul Mitchell "Hairstylist To The Stars" Tequila, aka, "Patron", an inferior tequila for it's price)|`|jF75gRIRaa	um had it once. the 1st time i went to mexico on my own, i was about 15(im 18 now), uhh got really drunk, had a pretty bad hangover the following morning. didn't rememeber the night before at all. so i hate it now. it's a really cheap liquor, but it is very popular with young white dudes and chicks. they love it. when i went to rosarito for spring break a few months ago, i saw alot of them drinking this cuervo stuff. i stick to cazadores, patron, don julio, 3 generaciones, herradura, or centenario. with all these i buy the aged kind(better, smoother taste, higher quality, but also higher cost)|`|i9C7He7paa	makes my clothes fall off   bad stuff dont drink it

X0E5vGftaa	What size bottles are they? Normally the cases hold 16 ounce bottles but not always. If so then you are of course getting 384 ounces. Normally we need 1 ounce per 2 pounds of body weight and 8 more ounces for every 20 minutes of exercise or activity we do. With hot/dry days and climates we need even more.    Normally you can only get too much if you drink a large amount in a very short time. Within 15 - 20 minutes we start to excrete extra water so it would have to be shorter than that. The exact amount that can be too much is hard to nail down because it depends many factors. It depends on your current hydration levels, your body size, how much you already have in your stomach, your activity level at the time, as well as your overall health.    Unless you are fasting you should not need to drink that much water. It should not hurt you since it is spread out throughout the day. However since it is not normal to drink that much you may want to talk to your doctor. There can be a reason why you are drinking that much. Normally diabetes is the first suspect.|`|KDKUnJOaaa	Uhm, dude. Theres no such thing as too much water, but if your drinking 24 bottles a day, then your gona want to be close to a toilet.

And now the station is getting sued for not listening to medical advice from the nurse. Sooooo, if you are going to drink a lot of water just make sure you don't hold it. Water is good for you, just don't drown your organs.|`|6V6LtUfMaa	water is not even bad for you. u can drink as much u want till your stomach allow you to do it|`|pxvpHIfjaa	While water is good for you, in certain quantities... you are essentially drowning yourself from the inside!  YIKES!!     It would take about 3 gallons over a short period of time for you to overdose (yeah I know it sounds very strange) on H2O!      What size are the bottles you are drinking?    24- 0.5L bottles = 3.17 gallons... so I would suggest cutting back on your water intake for sake of not drowning!  Even though you are drinking in a days time, not a few hours... why risk it!|`|o78hCHYdaa	rofl @ 'Erin is a kiwi yay!'. I was gonna say the same thing!

5KZdTMPDaa	They are completely different tastes.  Coffee has a strong aroma that you can smell from a different room.  Most coffee's have a deep rich taste.    Tea is a very light taste, and does not have a strong scent.  I drink plain green tea (no sugar/honey etc) Some days, i feel like i am drinking hot water with a light taste.  |`|AA10988378	Tea is milder and has a smooth taste.  Coffee is kind of bitter and stronger.  You should use creamer and some sugar in coffee. versus black tea can be drank on it's own and it's not as strong to the stomach.
FlVLN3Ehaa	You can't change him, but perhaps he will agree to eat vegetarian for dinner at home and satisfy his meat cravings when out. That's how my partner and I were when we started converting to veganism. He wouldn't trust what I had to say about nutrition, of course, but was willing to read a few chapters out of "The China Study," which had led to my "conversion."  Now he's on board too. Until his "conversion" he was happy to support me in my decision for myself and our kids, but he'd sneak off down to the kebab shop when we weren't looking :)|`|Jm6Vtptuaa	if he wants meat he can cook it himself    make seitan instead of meat.|`|b8R5bPrhaa	You do not control his body, He does.   You say he's healthy and fit, so he is probably fine with his diet.  Convince him to eat more veggies balancing his diet.|`|AA10758468	Cook meat for him even if it's not your way. You'll both be happier in the long run.|`|AA11498082	" need his support and a partner in this journey." says you made the decision to go meatless without his input.  Walk your own walk.  Don't expect anyone else to walk for or with you.  You made the choice, not him.    My family ate what I put in front of them.  This is dinner, period.  I did cook meat for them when I was a vegie, no big deal.  I - ME - chose to not eat meat, I didn't expect them to follow my lead.|`|AA12031316	Well, think about the last part of your statement-you said that YOU need support and a partner on this journey.  Remember, its YOUR journey.  Equally, your husband deserves the courtesy to be allowed to eat what he wants and what is familiar to him.  I don't eat meat, but when my mother comes to visit, I find ways to incorporate meat for her.  I think the more you preach to your hubby, the more likely he is to resent your choices.  Find a way to compromise that works for both of you.  If he is fit, then obviously his diet is working for him.  I personally don't believe we need meat in our diet, but its not my job to convince others not to eat it.  Remember, you need to be as supportive of his choices as you expect him to be of yours.|`|MpzPfzivaa	That is a decision he is going to have to make on his own. Many times with people, if you keep nagging (even if you think you are not) it has the opposite effect than what you are trying for.I have been a vegetarian for 22 years and my husband of 12 years is not. When we first were married, I tried to convert him too. All it did was put strain on our marriage. Over the years my influence has sunk into his brain to some extent. So when he comes up with some great "discovery" about his health, I bite my tongue, smile, and say "oh really, that's good to know". Essentially, the decision must come from him. You don't have to make this life style change on your own though, there are many on-line communities that will help you and encourage you. Good Luck!|`|466d0df8a4110fb75f51028e25c34d52aa	oh, girlfriend  i dont think u can change him  men have their own rules when it comes to eating  mine says i am too fancy  and i should cook more like his mother did>>>>.grrr  he is healthy  eats good healthy meals  i dont care if i eat meat or not  but he does  just be peaceful  it is his body   just add more veggies and fruits to his diet  i dont think you will change him  only he can do that|`|7xnVBSuXaa	Well, you can't change him.. but you can try to explain to him the benefits of eating healthier... Then you could make sure to cook for him other things that are yummy and healthy. Maybe you two could make a compromise of cutting down on meat instead of completely eliminating it. Compromise with Pasta dishes or fish ro chicken. Or instead of ground beef, use ground turkey. I hope this helped and that you two can work it out. You can't change him, but maybe you can try to suggest good decisions! :)|`|2r4kfcJmaa	You could give him Boca burgers and tell him that it's a burger. Same with all other meat substitutes. That could possibly work.

Preheat the oven to 180C    2. Line three 20cm cake tins with oiled greaseproof paper, then sift over some flour    3. In a medium bowl sift the flour, cocoa powder, bicarbonate of soda and baking powder.    4. Add sugar, butter and sour cream. Mix well until the mixture resembles fine breadcrumbs.    5. Stir together the vanilla essence and eggs. Add this mixture bit by bit to the breadcrumb batter so it doesnt curdle, then sprinkle with the food colouring.    6. Mix well, then divide between the three cake tins. Bake for 20-25 minutes or until the cake has come away slightly from the sides of the tin and a skewer inserted into the thickest part comes out clean.    7. Leave the sponges to cool for 5 minutes in the tins, then turn two of the sponges upside down on a cooling rack to dry. Turn out the third cake, but leave it right side up (this will be the top). To make icing the cake easier, you can refridgerate the sections once they have cooled a little. While the cakes are cooling, make the icing.    8. For the icing: cream the butter and cream cheese together and sift in the icing sugar. Add vanilla essence and mix until well combined.     9. Once the cakes are completely cool, layer the cake sandwiching it together with the icing, reserving half for the topping.    10. Spread the icing on top the cake and around the sides. Cut in slices to serve.    Cooks note: don't over cream the icing as it will become too soft to work with. If this happens refridgerate it for 10 minutes.|`|OgT00dW4aa	This is a cupcake recipe, but you can bake it in 2 - 9 inch round pans.  Fill and frost it with cream cheese frosting!

In a large strong plastic food bag, crush the biscuits to crumbs with a rolling pin. Stir into the butter until evenly mixed. Reserve 2 tbsp of the crumbs, then press the rest over the base of a 20cm/8in loose-bottomed cake tin and smooth down with the back of a large metal spoon. Chill the base while you make the filling.  2. In a mixing bowl set over a pan of simmering water, whisk the egg whites and sugar for about 5 minutes until it forms a stiff meringue that stands in soft peaks.  3. Break up the chocolate and melt in the microwave on medium for 3-4 minutes or in a small bowl set over the pan of hot water left over from making meringue. Whip the cream until it just holds its shape.  4. Fold the chocolate into the meringue, followed by the cream and the brandy. Pour into the tin and smooth the top. Sprinkle with the reserved crumbs and chill for at least 4 hours, or preferably overnight, so it is softly set.  5. Just before serving, remove the torte from the tin, slide on to a plate and dust lightly with icing sugar. Cut into wedges with a warm knife and serve with cream.
uap6JAqQaa	sounds like a pasta salad to me! just cook the macaroni & rinse with cold water, chop up all the veggies & bacon & toss them in with the pasta, & mix in sour cream to your liking. if you have any herbs and spices, i would definitely add them to the sour cream before mixing in, so you have a more flavorful dressing - but if you don't, just salt & pepper will do! hope this helps!|`|SwKPJRNvaa	Grilled vegetables -peppers, onion and celery. add herbs garlic and olive oil if u have them  Make a small salad- squeeze lemon onto thinly sliced onion -it cooks out the onionness and is tasty.

O0AfxH9Eaa	Copper lined with tin but they cost an arm and a leg and you have to get them relined and they take a lot of keeping clean.    What you really need to do is have different pans for different purposes. I have 3 heavy based stainless steel (Cuisinox) with layered bases, but a small non-stick heavy-based pan for making sauces and a non-stick frying pan. One of my set of 3 has small handles so it's easy to put in the oven. I've also got a thin-based pan for cooking Indian food in that I also use for chinese.     Cast iron is also very good - I have an iron griddle. The one to avoid is aluminium - not a good conductor of heat and aluminium is bad for you too. Nobody who uses unenamelled cast iron ever suffers from iron deficiency.    As a rule of thumb, buy the best you can afford. If you can only afford $20, buy one pan and save for the next one.|`|c5b91af8f2f5d06ad48ebd329c25945faa	I  cook  every day  with  a  good  ole  black  iron  skillet.

CATALINA CHICKEN:   From DontH8Me  http://www.city-data.com/forum/recipes/2...    "Catalina Chicken from the thighs and legs - separate them and skin them before baking to keep the fat down, if you prefer. The recipe I use is typically for a whole chicken, so I would substitute 4 - 5 legs and thighs in this case.    Take the cleaned pieces and put them in a rectangular glass baking dish. Mix one small or 1/2 large bottle of Catalina Island French salad dressing with one envelope of Lipton's French Onion Soup Mix. At this stage, depending on your preference, you could add to the pan of chicken any of the following: Onions, 1 inch dice, red/green/yellow bell pepper, 1 inch dice, and/or pineapple tidbits. Pour the sauce mix over the whole thing and swirl it around to coat all the pieces. Cover with foil to keep moist.    Bake in a 375 degree oven until the chicken juices run clear. You will want to make a batch of fluffy rice or mashed potatoes to soak up the delicious sauce from the chicken bake. My family loves this recipe and it takes less than 5 minutes to prep."    8. Campbell's Tasty 2-Step Chicken-5 Star recipe:  http://www.campbellkitchen.com/recipedet...    Ingredients:  1 tbsp. vegetable oil   4 skinless, boneless chicken breasts halves  1 can (10 3/4 ounces) Campbell's?

Return the chicken to the skillet.  Reduce the heat to low. Cover and cook for 5 minutes or until the chicken is cooked through.    Serving Suggestion: Serve with steamed whole green beans with sliced almonds and white rice. For dessert serve fresh red grapes.    9. Dessert - Seven Layer Magic Bars  Go here for a video:  http://eaglebrand.com/videos.asp?v=mcb v...|`|rPT4J5YLaa	Nothing is more American than apple pie. and america was based on it's meat and potatoes.|`|hKlsJgVSaa	You have some great ideas from other posters, and I agree it is hard because we are such a mixed and matched culture.    Now one thing that comes to mind are Indian Tacos, or Fry Bread. Some people call it them Navaho tacos but I grew up outside the res and everyone around here calls them Indian Tacos.    Anyway you can do the fry bread very easily. You can make your own bread from scratch or even use those frozen loafs and let it thaw then pinch off a bit of dough and flatten it out and then deep fry on both sides.    Drain the bread and either top with honey butter or with, beans-taco meat-tomatoes,onions, olives, lettuce, cheese etc.. and of course then salsa and sour cream.    These were made by the Indians back in the day, when they were on the rez. The tribes were given on flour, fat-usually rancid, baking powder etc.... So they had to make the best of what they had. Nowdays of course it is not made with rancid lard, and is pretty tasty. It is a Native neccessity food, but I sure do love it when I get the chance.    Or the other food Ithought of is Hard Tack. I'm pretty sure it is All-American.    Civil war soldiers used it as well as cowboys back in the day. It is just flour, salt, and water. It is then baked. It's not the best taste but it could be munched on when food was scarce. not only that it could stay in the saddle bags for ages and ages with out spoiling. Just like jerkey. My dad is 51 and he used to keep hard tack in his saddle bags when he was young as well.      As far as the pizza thing. Yes it is not originally American but our style is. Loaded with tomato sauce, cheese and tons of toppings. Or even a b-b-q chicken pizza, or alfredo sauce with chicken and artichoke hearts. Or even a taco pizza. You put refried beans and meat of choice on the pizza with a little cheese, and bake it off. Then top with all the yummy taco toppings you can think of.    Another thought is how you can pick several foods and show how they may not be original to the US, but how the US has made them thier own. Like pizzas, make mini burgers, you can even buy mini hot dogs (Oscar Meyer) and top them with chil, saurkraut-onions etc... Look up a good new york hot dog topping "recipe" or list.|`|hHCdXq0Naa	meat loaf, mashed potatoes and green beans

qkYv5c6uaa	Here is a very simple recipe.  You can add small chunks of meat if you like, such as corned beef.    Ingredients  4 potatoes (peel & cut into small cubes, all the same size)   1 onion (finely chopped)  vegetable oil   butter    Melt 1-2 tbsp butter in a pan.  Add onions & fry until translucent.  Add 2 tbsp each butter and oil.   Add potatoes & fry until golden & crispy on all sides.  Add salt & pepper to taste.
qkYv5c6uaa	If you are baking the rolls with additional sauce, then it is probably getting soaked up while it bakes.  Try baking it first so that it forms a crust, then add extra sauce in the pan & just heat it til warm.
AA11527539	I dont know about the law, it depends on your jurisdiction, speak to a lawyer, etc.  Distillation is certainly possible from beer, but realistically, it is almost certainly not worth the effort.    Using any kind of home still, you will certainly not have good control, and you will not have an efficient collection. Normally spirits are collected in a number of parts, the first bit to be collected (the heads) contain methanol and should not be drunk.  The last bit may contain longer chain alcohols and should not be drunk.  The middle is the bit you are interested in, and you probably need to run it through your still a few times to get decent purity (and safety).   There is more to it than just temperatures (if you are interested, you can read up on Raoult's law which will tell you a bit about why just getting the temperature right wont get you pure alcohol).    I would strongly suggest that 1) you check the law, and 2) you get a book on distilling.    Also, some quick math.  If you start with beer at 4% and you want to make moonshine at 40% alcohol, then you need 10 gallons of beer for each gallon of shine.  And of course you will get some wastage, so you are looking at 10-15 times as much beer as shine.  And what you get at the end will taste bad, may not be safe, and may not be legal even to make.    Normally people only distil for themselves if alcohol is not otherwise available -- if you have a source of beer, I would stick to drinking that.|`|QvF8dR7Taa	there are web sites that have the instruction on how to meek any type alcohol you want to,also you can order a distillation set up,and its legal to make small amounts for personal consumption,you just cant sell it.you can find the legal amounts you can make on the same site,so be care ful|`|WKKdQq2Aaa	Can't be done.

xrRZeROmaa	Flank steak cut with the grain for chewy, or cross grain for easy to chew.    Cross rib with the fat well trimmed from the outside, Chuck pot roast with the fat well trimmed.      I usually pick the leanest meat on sale for the best price.  Don't overlook the discounted meats bin.    Get your butcher to slice it for you unless you have a slicer of your own.   Most large grocery butcher shops charge nothing for this service.   It's easier to get even slices on a professional machine, and makes for even drying times.|`|hHCdXq0Naa	I've always used London Broil - sliced thinly across the grain.

Jerky can be made from lean beef, chicken or turkey breast, and wild game.  Quality meat means quality jerky but you don't have to pay a high price.  Watch the sales at your local supermarket and take advantage of them.   Beef flank steak is your best buy.  There is no waste at all because flank steak is all lean, pure red meat with consistent straight grain making it easy to prepare.  Chicken and turkey breast meat are also perfect for making even lower fat, healthier jerky snacks.  Pork should never be used for jerky.  The pork version of jerky is bacon which requires a different blend of cure and spices as well as completely different processing.      Wild game like deer and rabbit are well suited to jerky making if the meat has been promptly and properly processed. The curing process used to make jerky will greatly reduce the gamy flavor of wild meats.  Prepare deer and rabbit as described for beef.  Game birds should be treated like chicken.|`|lTkYWiy5aa	Alton brown uses flank steak: http://www.foodnetwork.com/recipes/alton...|`|zn0pXkc0aa	I don't make jerky but I think a lean cut such as flank or round steak would be best.|`|0ff2304aa58946a2151ca64e5d9e7cd9aa	Absolutely anything.  Lean seems to work best; if you use marbled cuts, refrigerate or freeze the end product so the fat doesn't go rancid.

ZSyyTjokaa	Any pre-ground  spice,  as opposed to something you grind yourself,  will have less fullness and potency.  Ground spices tend to give up their volatile oils over time  (even in a well-sealed container),  and the flavor and aroma evaporates.    Large, whole spices,  like cardamom, nutmeg, star anise and cinnamon  aren't terribly hard to find, or very expensive---around here,  anyway.  Plus,  they're usually worth the investment, because if you only grind them as needed,  the  remaining  whole spices   will last for years,  with no significant loss of potency.    You might try online resources if you're looking for specific  spices that aren't available in your neighborhood.  Also,  large supermarkets tend to charge way too much for some herbs and spices,   if they even  carry them in the first place.  Look around for a smaller, independently-owned international  market.  They usually carry the more  "exotic"  stuff,  at a reasonable price.|`|BWxSSADaaa	I'm Indian and cook Indian food at home frequently.  I use many of the ground spices you describe (tumeric, cumin, coriander, sometimes cardamom, chili powder, cayenne pepper, fenugreek, black pepper).  Not only do I use them, my mom uses them, my grandmother did, and all my aunts do (one of whom cooks the best Indian food EVER).  No problems.  But, we use up these spices quickly after buying them, since we're cooking this type of food often.  If your spices are old, they are less flavorful.  You may need to add more than the recipe requires.  That will be a good idea anyway, except for with chili powder; stick with less at first if you're not used to it.  If your spices are VERY old, I'd throw them out.  It'll just taste like powder.|`|0HfhltzZaa	You can make curries using ground spices. Just readjust the amounts given in the recipe. Also, sauteing the spices with your aromatics (ie ginger, garlic, onions) will help bring out the flavors. I use both and there is a slight difference but most people won't notice unless you tell them!|`|cLa7nwhcaa	Let me try to answer this query in a different fashion  1. Coriander Cumin Fenugreek  These have largely oil-soluble components. The flavor is released efficiently when fried in oil. The next best method is by dry-roasting.  It really matters less if the spices are pre-ground or fresh-ground, the flavor needs roasting so the advantage of fresh-ground is marginal at best.    2. Red Chilli peppers  The pungency (heat) is in the chemical called Capsaicin that is oil-soluble. The best way to maximmize extraction of Capsaicin is by frying it in oil.  The other part is the aroma and color in the pigment. If the cayenne is ground it losses its aroma and color. The ground spice must be stored in dry cool dark place and expect it to last six months. The whole spice stored in the same enviornment is good for one year. Apparantly, the whole dry pepper are better than ground pepper. If you do want to use ground peppers at least try to use them up in less than six months    3. Turmeric and Dry ginger  It is very hard to grind these two spices for practical puposes. So these spices are always used as ground unless used by a gormet chef with an access to burr grinder.    4. Nutmeg and Mace  These two spices are from rthe same fruit just different part of the fruit. The flavor of these spices degrades rapidly. They should be grated or ground on as needed bases. Also, these spices should not be dry-roasted or fried in oil.  These spices are included in Garam Masala, but what a wastage of money. You only realize if you add freshly grated Nutmeg    5. Cinnamon, Cloves, Black Peppers, Cardamom  These have a significant portion thats water-soluble. Remember how the Garam Masala Chai is made.  Frying these spices gives only marginal improvement in flavor, over-roasting will actually burn the flavor. Remember that Punjabi Masala is not made by dry-roasting these spices.  The spices with water-soluble compents are delicate. They should be freshly ground.    6. Degi Mirch  This is Kashmir Paprika. It is primarily used for its pigment (color and aroma), and not the heat (Capasaicin). The Paprika is very delicate and should not be roasted. It should be stored in dry-cool-dry place. It should always be freshly ground    Summary  If the spice has to be fried in oil for its flavor, it is a robust spice and can be used as whole or freshly ground    If the spice is basically water-soluble it is a delicate spice and preferable used as whole or freshly ground    I wish query had included the third option of cracked spices. The Indian pickles largely use cracked spices. Cracked spice is spice that is ground very coarse to the consistency of spent coffee grounds. In Punjab, cracked spice mix of Cassia, Cloves, Mace, and Black Peppercorn is used to make Pickles, and as Sabut Garam Masala. Sabut means whole, but in this case it is cracked and not whole.  I know this answer is getting too long so I will stop here.|`|cfdc405defe60d37e2129e3f90174096aa	I am a former chef and agree with Yogesh, I have worked with Indian spice and use many now myself and some whole spices are better as they loose alot of there strength and volatile oils over time, some are best toasted and fresh ground a simple coffee grinder is best, turmeric is available fresh but harder to work with ground is best, most other are fine cracked or broken, chili's are one thing I have found to lack the ability to last after breaking or grinding.    For me I like to blend my own spices and buy from many vendors, I like spicy so most of my food is highly seasoned with chili peppers. I would seek out the whole ones were you need them and rely on only spices that need to be ground and those are very few, and one thing about whole seeds or other spices when whole is they last 2-3 times longer.

They'll get crisp in an oven, and you can put them on a pizza tray, but put some foil on it since the nuggets will release some grease that will not be fun to clean off your oven floor.     You should probably get a baking sheet pan at some point as well though...    I shudder at the thought of your oven lol. Buy a toaster oven, it'll be cheaper, and work just as well. Also, wax paper is coated in wax...which melts when exposed to heat. Please don't use it in your oven, toaster oven, or microwave.

Microwave on high power 2 to 4 minutes or until chicken is hot; turn plate and stir pieces halfway through heating time.  Serve immediately.    Oven Method:    1.  Heat oven to 425 degrees F.  2.  Spread pieces out on a foil-lined baking sheet (pizza pan will work too) in a single layer.  3.  Heat chicken in oven 6 to 8 minutes or until light golden brown.  Remove pan from oven; scoop pieces up with a spatula and turn over.  Heat 6 to 8 minutes longer or until chicken is golden brown and crispy.  4.  Let stand 2 minutes prior to serving.

Milk  2 tsp. Balsamic Vinegar  2 tbsp. Honey  1 Lemon    How to Make It:    1. In a bowl, stir the marscapone, sugar, and milk together.  2. Shred a little bit of the lemon rind, and stir it into the marscapone mixture.  3. Cut strawberries into quarters. Mix together the honey and vinegar.  4. In individual serving dishes or glasses, layer alternately the marscapone followed by a layer of strawberries. Repeat until finished. Then pour a little honey and vinegar sauce over the top.  Voil!    Variations:    You can use any other berries along with the strawberries, or any other fruit.  You can also replace the honey/vinegar sauce (it may sound a little strange, but really it's delicious!) with any other fruit sauce you choose.    Serving Ideas:    Even though this dessert can be made in about 10 minutes, do not underestimate its elegance... so, it's definitely the moment for crystal or glass serving dishes which will show off the beautiful layers of creamy marscapone and strawberries! After all, who ever said that quick easy dessert recipes have to look quick and easy?!  Of course, you can also prepare this dessert in one large serving dish.    Fact:    Marscapone cheese is of course Italian, but is more and more commonly used in French desserts.      Chocolate Truffle Recipes:    Preparation Time: 30 minutes     Ingredients (for about 1.5 pounds):    1 cup Crme Fra?che (or heavy cream)  14 oz. Dark Chocolate (use very high quality, 70% cocoa, chocolate - or very high quality unsweetened baking chocolate.)  8 oz. Additional Dark Chocolate  11/2 cups Cocoa Powder (the highest quality you can find)  3 tbsp. Butter (optional)    How to Make It:    Batter (Ganache):    1. Break chocolate into small pieces and put in a large bowl.  2. Bring cream slowly to a light boil.  3. Pour boiling cream over chocolate and keep stirring until all the chocolate has melted and the batter is homogenous.  4. If you want to add butter, do so now, before the batter cools, and thickens.    This batter is called Ganache and is the base for all French truffle recipes!    When the ganache is warm it is very creamy. You can thicken it   1. by whisking it (the oxygen causes it to thicken) or  2. by putting it in the refrigerator.    You want the ganache to be just thick enough to easily form the truffle balls    Forming Truffles:    1. Using two spoons (or a baking sac) form even and round balls. Place them on parchment or wax paper.  2. Melt the rest of the chocolate in a bain-marie (double-boiler).  3. Dip each ball in the melted chocolate and then roll it in the cocoa powder.

You can also search on that page for more crepe recipes.  http://allrecipes.com/Recipe/Basic-Crepe...    --------------------------------------...  The other idea would be cream puffs.

You make it into a dough that you drop by teaspoons onto a cookie sheet and bake.  Follow this recipe instructions and let the crusts cool in the oven so they wont collapse. They puff up a lot and after they are cooled you can cut them partially open and fill w custard or whipped cream.  This recipe for the shells is exactly what I use.  I have never made the custard.  And I frost with frosting not drizzle.    http://www.recipezaar.com/Cream-Puffs-33...    People are so impressed when you make these and they are relatively easy!!
6QJe4Mlyaa	I think you are supposed to split the vanilla bean.  I am pretty sure it will take about 3-4 weeks to flavor an entire bottle of vodka.  At some point the vanilla bean will loose all its vanilla flavor but that will take a while.  The vodka will be good for  cooking, baking and drinking.  If you do not split the bean in about 4 weeks remove the bean and dry it off and place it in a container of white sugar.  The bean will infuse the sugar with more vanilla flavor and you can use the vanilla sugar for baking, coffee, tea......|`|AA12307584	Try to leave it at least.

2b7ErdOqaa	This is the standard information I generally give for my stir-fry recipes. The sauce is what does the trick and the rest is up to you.    Most fresh veggies will work well in a stir-fry. Here are some simple combinations that always go great:    Onions  Carrots  Celery  Pea Pods  Bean Sprouts  Broccoli  Cabbage    You can get creative and add things like    Bok Choy  Savoy Cabbage  Bamboo Shoots  Mushrooms  Water Chestnuts  Zucchini    And the list goes on.    The meats are also up to you but chicken and pork always go well together. You could use in your stir fry:    beef strips  pork strips  chicken strips  shrimp  scallops    Any leftover meat you have that you can slice would work in there. Just add it at the end.    And, if you want to make the best sauce, here's what to use:    1/2 cup boiling water with 1 tsp chicken base (like a bouillon cube but moist)  2 "glugs" of soy sauce  2 "glugs" of oyster sauce  1/2 tsp ground ginger  black pepper to taste  5 drops sesame oil    Mix all that together and sprinkle it on your veggies as they cook. Remember not to overcook the veggies. Always start with the veggies that take the longest to cook. Things like pea pods and bean sprouts are always the last to go in.    Once all the sauce is added, to thicken it, mix 1 tablespoonful of cornstarch with some cold water - enough to make a thin paste. Move the veggies over and add a little to the broth in that area. It will start thickening up pretty quick. Stir it around and do it in another area until all the sauce is glossy and coating the veggies (don't do too much, though). Be sure to cook your noodles until el dente in a separate pan and add just before adding the cornstarch.|`|USoCUVeOaa	Any sort of Stir-Fry would be great for a chicken based meal just add white rice some soy sauce your chicken and some stir fry veggies (broccoli) and any salty seasoning you desire.|`|ahjqc9Ifaa	CHINESE STIR-FRY    1 pound chicken, round steak, or pork, cut into bite-size pieces or strips  Cornstarch  Soy sauce  1/2 - 1 tsp. chopped or minced garlic, fresh or from a jar, water- or oil-pack  2 Tbsp. cooking oil: vegetable, peanut, or canola  Vegetables cut into bite-sized pieces (3 - 5 cups raw)  Cooked rice or pasta (spaghetti, fettuccine, capellini)    In a small bowl, mix 1 Tbsp. cornstarch with 1 Tbsp. soy sauce and 1/2 to 1 tsp. garlic. (If you must, you can substitute 1/2 tsp. garlic powder for minced garlic.) Stir to coat meat. Flavor sinks in if you let meat sit in the mixture for a while [30 minutes to all day], in the refrigerator. Leave the soy sauce and corn starch out--you'll be using them again. Tip: Youll need the tablespoon measure for the cornstarch again, so use a different one for the soy sauce.    When youre ready to cook, start the rice first. (White rice goes from cold water and raw rice to cooked in 20-25 minutes.)    Heat oil in large skillet or wok. Stir-fry meat until it shows no pink or red, about five to seven minutes. Don't worry about some of the sauce mixture sticking to the pan. Add vegetables (broccoli, snow peas, mushrooms, bok choy, red or green pepper, thinly-sliced carrots, coarsely chopped onion, canned baby corn, water chestnuts, bamboo shoots, straw mushrooms, etc.) and stir fry about five to seven minutes, to heat through and to fully cook crisp veggies (broccoli, carrot strips) and to allow mushrooms to release their liquor.    In a small bowl or cup, mix 1/3 c. cool water, 1/4 c. soy sauce, and 1 Tbsp. cornstarch. Pour into skillet or wok and cook, stirring, until sauce boils and thickens. Serve over cooked rice or pasta.    The trick to making the sticky rice that goes right is to use short-grain or medium-grain rice and to get to know your own stove. On mine, I bring 2 cups of salted water to a boil, throw in 1 cup of short-grain rice, and reduce the heat to low. It takes exactly 18 minutes. In our old house, it was 16.|`|dDDAbqqhaa	spinach

GCZaK7CYaa	make sure you provide games or entertainment-there is nothing worse then a bunch of bored people just sitting around.  Even though some people will think it is corny at 1st---- play games that involve everyone.    From the classic charades and standard board games to hip rhyming challenges, there are lots of ways to add fun activities to your at-home, casual party. Some to consider:    Revised version of charades using news of that day.   Board games from the past (Battleship, Operation, Twister) with odd substitutes for missing game pieces (toothpicks for Battleship pieces, tiny party favors for Operation).   Create new lyrics to common and popular songs. For instance, you could use the tune from the Beverly Hillbillies television show to sing about a friend's promotion: "Come and listen to a story about a guy named Jay. Accounting extraordinaire at Horner, Smith and Flay." Get the idea?   Trivia challenges--especially fun if you and your guests share a common hobby or interest such as old movies, cars or even cooking.  Have Fun!|`|vw7ebwgnaa	MUSIC!! Music is always a good mood setter!! I would do like your mom did and set something up outside, whether it's food or drinks, to draw the guests outside. I would also recommend waiting until spring to be able to use the gorgeous weather outside. You could also try getting a few ottomans for the couches that can double as a "table" or as somewhere to sit.     As far as the drinks go, I would recommend just buying a whole bunch of stuff and letting them make their own. My family makes vodka or brandy slush that gets mixed with any white soda (usually 50/50)...the colors go great with a spring theme.

737e8ad896c16931d3da06dca8c8e2b4aa	Well the Yamster has done it again. Why did he direct this question to Cooking and Recipes? To cook up romance?     To answer the question it is about how wonderful we feel when we are together. How she makes me feel and how I make her feel. It is heartfelt but difficult to describe in words. The communication is more non verbal. It really is heart to heart and in the eyes as much as the voice.    To me it is when she tells me how much she loves being with me and how good I make her feel.  I love telling her I love her and how I find her beautiful,sexy and attractive.

0b508e8a46ceb076d498c94707fa4b1aaa	This is a dry recipe for pancake mix that I made up and it is awesome. If one can eat 2 they are doing great. They are so fluffy and I use a pancake ring to cook them. It does involve soda. I couldn't pass this up. Hope you enjoy. 5 cups all purpose flour,3 cups coffee mate creamer original, 5 tablespoons sugar and baking powder, 5 teaspoons baking soda, and 1 tablespoon of salt. Mix dry ingredients well and store in an air tight container. When ready to use add 3/4 cup of the dry mix with 2 tablespoons of the oil and 1 large egg with 1 cup milk. Stir well. Heat the griddle. Allow batter to set for 5 minutes at room temp. Then cook over low medium heat. They are the best. I made this a few weeks back and ask YA to help tweak it and they did just that. The only thing I changed was the salt content. So I have to thank the guy who helped me tweak it to perfection. It was a recipe close to Alton Brown's. One answerer added that with the coffee mate you could add different flavors. That was awesome.

Baking soda reacts with the acidic ingredients in the pancakes to create air and make them fluffy (the reaction is the same one you get when you pour vinegar on baking soda).  If you leave it out, the pancakes will be very dense, but if you don't mind that, you can leave it out.

yqqVPcU0aa	You shouldn't have more than 3 eggs a week, too much cholesterol, potatoes is basically a starch, just like white bread is.  Change the white loaf of bread to something with grains, or something other than white.  You need more vegetables, greens to be exact.  Most leafy greens can be eaten raw.  Some need to be blanched first, while others need to be simmered.  Most vegetables may be eaten raw.  Just wash, rinse and slice, or eat.    Easiest way to add more vegetable to your diet is have a V8s.  Its a vegetable cocktail drink that provides 2 servings of vegetable per can/bottle, but may get costly over time.  Making a simple salad is best, basic greens, and colourful vegetables.      Don't forget to add beans/legumes to your diet.  They contain the same vitamins/fibre as meat does.  They may be out of a can, or fresh.  If you are buying them in a can, make sure you rinse away, the liquid inside used to can the beans.    Juice everyday is good, but it depends on the juice.  Orange juice is the best of all the fruits, with the most anti-oxidants, and vitamin C per fruit.      You may mix up the juice with apple, grape, and cocktails, but at least have 3 servings of orange juice a week.      p.s. a serving = 250ml|`|i405qKokaa	Sounds like you're getting enough starch in your diet. I think you need to learn a few recipes though, or maybe extend your menu a little. Beans on Toast, Fish & Chips, Spag Bol...I think you could do with more green vegetables and fruit too.|`|XdzV4KMOaa	no that is not sufficent. you need vegetables, fish,chicken, meat,, etc. why dont you so to a sanhich place , wath how they make them and dulicate at home, or bu prepared meals at store and heat  up for yourself|`|76SAdZ19aa	Eat some salad.|`|AA10027242	Of course it's harmful.  You'll get malnutrition.  You don't have to know how to cook to eat some fresh fruits and vegetables.   Eating the whole fruit or the whole vegetable is much healthier than drinking the juice.  You get more vitamins, and you get fiber from it.   Also, why don't you learn how to cook?   It's not hard.  All it takes is a little bit of practice.
zawmsUO1aa	Chicken Parmigiana & penne pasta - it's pretty easy.    What I use (I'm not going to include quantities, because you can just use as much or little as you need)  Boneless, skinless chicken breast tenders  Italian breadcrumbs  Canned spaghetti sauce   Tomato sauce  Penne pasta  Parmesan cheese  Grated mozzerella cheese    Get a little oil heating in your pan, I'd say about 1/2 inch, not enough to deep fry the chicken, but not so little that it all sticks to the pan  Dredge the chicken in the bread crumbs to coat both sides  Once the oil is good and hot put your breaded chicken in.  Fry on both sides until you have a nice golden brown crust happening.   Meanwhile you should have started boiling some water for the penne. Cook that according to the package to your desired tenderness. It's probably a good idea to remove it just before it's completely done, because it will finish cooking in the oven  Once your pasta is tender and your breasts are golden you can throw it all together in a large casserole dish.   Pasta goes in first. Cover with canned sauce. Mine wasn't quite enough so I added a can of tomato sauce.   Put chicken on top, cover with foil and place in a 350 degree oven for 20-30 minutes. Long enough for everything to get nice and bubbly.  Remove foil and sprinkle on lots of cheese and place back in oven just long enough to melt cheese.     Serve with a salad and maybe some French bread.|`|UjG8FqLUaa	PASTA?|`|89650e173bc5a587806fdebc36366a40aa	Mickey D's...|`|Er4le3okaa	Enchiladas!|`|sr1ERywSaa	when their not home order  chinese takeout|`|6f2db755a3cb804e6e5942093e504c5baa	ribs
t0vuwuGXaa	If it tastes pungent, then you may have used a bad lime, or whatever fresh ingredient.

(To rim a glass, take a lime and wet the rim of a glass with it, then place the glass upside down onto a plate with margarita salt on it).    If you want to get creative, float a splash of brandy on top!    Also, it's important to use a good tequila, like Sauza Commemorativo.|`|d2c5a92a77916c71329eb41b3c23d5d2aa	It's the lime juice, try the mix you get in stores.

MIlpLLZcaa	Sounds yummy, but when you are pouring it in make sure you let the next flavour that you are about to pour in cool to room temp, just before it begins to set.

fBW54cAraa	When you freeze anything, ice crystals form within it from the food itself and the humidity of the freezer.  If such items are placed right into an oven, the ice melts and evaporates quickly, but if you thaw something such as a frozen pizza before you bake it, the ice will melt and the resulting water will soak into the bread, making it soggy.  There's also the issue of food safety.  Many of those prepared foods are high in protein or sugar, which microbial nasties enjoy munching on.  Keeping such foods at room temp, which some people do when they defrost things, could lead to food poisoning and a lawsuit.|`|hKlsJgVSaa	Okay take for example, frozen mozzerella stic or fish sticks etc... The breading gets mushy, and can even fall off, before or during the cooking. The texture will not be the same and you run the risk of loosing all the good stuff.|`|F2ugW4cRaa	Many will become water logged if thawed, they need that burst of heat, often high, to steam it out ASAP.|`|B1ueclBaaa	That would give them time to lose their texture and maybe be mushy.|`|BV6POGufaa	If thawed first,it could lose some flavor, be mushy, and taste yucky.  However, it could also have health issues worked into it. When a food is thawed, it often times can have bacteria growing on it in the room temperature. My advice is, when a package says to prepare straight from frozen, prepare is straight from frozen.
6QJe4Mlyaa	A note about one of the answers, DO NOT use honey for a child under the age of 2.  Dried cranberries are good.  They do have sugar added but I am sure he would eat them.  They are good in cookies in place of raisins.  You can try cooking the cranberries with another sweet fruit.  Apples are very good for this.  If you want to use the cranberry juice use apple juice to sweeten or a pear juice.  Orange juice might also be good.  I would try baking or cooking the cranberries into something he likes.  I would not worry much about getting him to eat cranberries.  If he is eating a good healthy balanced diet don't force the cranberries.  It may back fire and you will have a harder time getting him to eat them later.  I mix cranberries into stuffing for chicken, turkey and pork.  I add them to chicken and turkey soup.  You can also cook them and add to jello they thicken up all by themselves, there is a lot of pectin in the cranberries so your jello will become real firm.  Good luck I hope you find some healthy ways to introduce them.|`|0HfhltzZaa	You can take 1 cup of cranberries and cook them with some grape or other fruit  juice concentrate (to taste) over the stove and let cool, then serve. Whole cranberries are just too tart and highly acidic when raw for a young one. =]|`|A0nRQHDCaa	maybe whip cream|`|dbw210qqaa	Stevia is an excellent sweetener as it does not spike or drop your blood sugar levels   you would have to experiment as for how much to use as it is very sweet  there is powder and there is liquid and it is natural|`|MVcvIiiaaa	Honey is probably your healthiest option.    Here are some others that you might have heard of:    Stevia-this is all natural, but it lowers sprem count in men    Agave nectar-this is good too, some what expensive though    Splenda and other artificial sweeteners-pleeeease never consume these-in anything. You are better off having a regular soda than a calorie free one. It took artificial sweeteners to get approved by the FDA 9 times before it got approved by the makers. Plus onece they enter into your system, they become a chemical which they use in laberatories to preserve things.    High fructose corn syrup-this is laughable. have you seen those commercials that say there is nothing wrong with using corn syrup? Well, its bad for you. It ages your skin by brecking down some structure in your skin. I dont remember exactly what it is/i have to re-read what I read :P...just dont eat it.      Another way to consume your cranberries is by getting Knudsen Cranberry juice and putting just a little bit at the bottom of a sippy cup for your son with a little honey, then filling the rest up with water to dilute it and make it tast good.     Also, you could steam them untill they are squishy, mash them up with a little honey and mix them in with yogurt.     Even making cranberry muffins using whole wheat/non-bleached flour is good.     Same thing with chocolate chip cookies-just use semi-sweet/non milk chocolate chocolate, whole wheat flour, honey and dont beafraid to use canola oil or olive oil/good source of healthy fat which your body needs(especially your heart because good fat is its first choice of enery)    Hope this helps!!|`|PtACBQNgaa	use splenda :D|`|ELCJQXMraa	Honey? or a sweetner|`|ZUcQAqRUaa	Try giving him dried cranberries, they taste a lot sweeter than fresh ones.

You could put Splenda on them instead.    Also, usually you're meant to sweeten cranberries.  If you buy dried cranberries they're almost always sweetened already.  It won't really affect the nutrition of them, it'll just make them a little higher in calories.|`|767862fac913cacc2a85deeb280cab44aa	try splenda...or try putting them in jello...just mix em in|`|dat8eoYyaa	stevia, its all natural ! :)|`|sr1ERywSaa	use this thing called stevia.its in a green box. or splenda but stevia is better.|`|dnoJPmG7aa	Cranraisins are less tart.

hHCdXq0Naa	My daughter has 3 kids (the oldest's 5th birthday party is today); and the first birthdays are always a small party for family and close friends.  NO GAMES for a 1-yr-old!  They're happiest just playing, especially with the boxes & ribbons from the gifts.  Keep the party to about 1-1/2 hours, or they'll start to get cranky.  ... She usually has an outdoor BBQ, or has BBQ food catered in (in winter), veggie/dip & fruit platters;  mac & cheese (the kids like it);  and of course cake - with a special small one for the birthday child......  Favors can be a box of animal crackers.

Keep the party short (1-2 hours) and plan for a time of day when your child is usually at his best. Morning parties work well for many young children.    Fun Invitations for a 1st Birthday include:     Cut a large number 1 from bright colored paper. Write your child's name on the front of the number and the party details (time, location, etc.) on the back of the number.   Make reprints of a recent photo of your child and tape or glue to a slightly larger piece of paper. Write "Look who's turning 1!" above or below the photo and write and the party details on the back.   Tie one birthday candle to your invitations.       Fun Decorations for a 1st Birthday Party include:   Personalized 1st Birthday banners   Large number ones cut from brightly colored paper and hung around the party location.   Favorite photos of the birthday child (from infant pictures to current).   Stuffed animals   Happy 1st birthday banner or poster for guests to sign and add their best wishes.   Helium balloons and streamers to match party theme.       Fun Games & Activities for a 1st Birthday include:   Story time (read or tell a favorite story)   Show home video of 1st year (limit to 10 minutes!)   Ball rolls (have children sit in circle with legs apart and roll large ball to each other)   Wagon rides (decorate a wagon and pull children for rides)   Free play area (blocks, stacking toys, pull toys, and other young favorites)   Box yard (decorate several large cardboard boxes and allow children to climb in and through boxes)   Pull string pinata (even very young children can play)       Creative Arts & Crafts for a 1st Birthday include:   Finger painting   Paint with water books (ink is printed on page)   Handprints in plaster or clay       Fun Foods for a 1st Birthday include:   animal crackers or other small cookies   peanut butter & jelly or cream cheese sandwiches   applesauce   cupcakes (less messy than cake), cake with  1 candle,   ice-cream   Include additional foods for the adults, such as:    cheese and crackers   cut fruit   raw vegetable platter with dip   pretzels       Fun Party Favors for a 1st Birthday Party include:     beach balls   blowing bubbles   picture book   finger puppets|`|c22PlL9paa	there is this place in worchester MA it is called pump it up or close to that location and it is like inflatibales and bounce houses it is really kool i hope that helps
qkYv5c6uaa	I don't have experience with this brand of breadmakers, but it is probably not worth getting service on it.  The machine probably cost you between $50-70, and you figure in shipping costs both ways, plus whatever they say is wrong with it.    You might have better luck if you just contact Sunbeam and explain the problem - they might have something you can try at home to fix it, or they might even give you a discount on a new machine seeing as you've only used this once and it doesn't work.
0ff2304aa58946a2151ca64e5d9e7cd9aa	Norwegian pancakes.  These are somewhat heavy crepes.  Pancakes that don't rise so you can use any pancake recipe and omit the baking powder, but that takes the fun out of it.  The fun is in learning how to throw things together until it feels right.  Three ingredients: eggs, flour and milk, in that order.  And butter...is FOUR ingredients!  (NNNOOOBODY EXPECTS THE SPANISH INQUISITION!)  Alright, I'll behave.  Mix the eggs with a fork (2 or 3 per person) and stir in flour until it's thick, or even until you get a lump.  Then slowly mix in milk.  As it thins, you can add milk faster but start slow.  The end of the flour/beginning of the milk is the most energy intensive part.  Toward the end you can pour it back into itself with a ladle to mix the milk, but don't get it too thin.  It needs to be ladled in and slide around the bottom of a buttered frying pan.  NNNOOOB...oh, I'm sorry.  I promised to behave, didn't I?  It looks kind of dry on the top when it's ready to flip; you learn quickly and the first one is never perfect.  After the first, they fry pretty consistently.  When the second side is done, fold in quarters and transfer to a plate.    These can be eaten as pancakes with syrup, spread with jelly and rolled up, or spread with absolutely anything and rolled up.  You can even heat a can of Dinty Moore Beef Stew and roll some up in them.  It's a basic eggs, flour, milk food that anything from sweets to beef to seafood to veggies can be rolled up in.  They should have a sauce.    BONUS!!!  Make a bunch, folded into quarters, and freeze them.  They nuke up well from frozen (about one minute each).|`|Tidc5Ra9aa	you shouold make tostadas with beans on them and make pork-n-beans ans corn it will taste delicious|`|3xNqFQMTaa	BBQ Prawns & Mango Salsa    Ingredients  1 ripe mango, peeled and cut in to 2 cm cubes  3 shallots, finely sliced  1 fresh chilli, seeded and finely sliced  2 tsp grated ginger  1 tbsp lime juice  2 tbsp fresh coriander, roughly chopped  300g green prawns, peeled, leaving tails intact  Method  Make the salsa: Combine all the ingredients, except the prawns, refrigerate.

Place a large pot of water on to boil for pasta. When it comes to a boil, salt it and add the pasta to cook to al dente. Strain pasta reserving 1 cup cooking liquid.    While the water is coming to a boil, in a large mixing bowl combine the chicken, salt and pepper, rosemary, fennel seeds, garlic, crushed red pepper flakes, ricotta cheese, 1/2 cup grated Parmigiano - a rounded handful, egg and bread crumbs. *If the mixture seems too wet, add a handful of bread crumbs and mix together.       Form 8 large round balls, about 3 to 4-inches. Coat balls in a couple of tablespoons of extra-virgin olive oil and lightly grease a baking sheet with 1 tablespoon extra-virgin olive oil. Arrange balls on the baking sheet and roast 17 to 18 minutes until juices run clear.    Defrost spinach in microwave 8 to 10 minutes on "defrost" setting depending on the microwave.  Place the boxes in a shallow dish to catch any run off.    While the meatballs roast, in a medium sauce pot over medium heat, melt butter, whisk in flour, cook 1 minute then whisk in stock and milk, season with salt, pepper and nutmeg and thicken 5 to 6 minutes. Stir in the remaining 1 cup grated Parmigiano and reduce heat on lowest setting.    Wring spinach completely dry in clean kitchen towel then separate as you add it to the sauce. Also add the reserved 1 cup pasta cooking liquid.    Toss pasta with the spinach-white sauce and adjust seasonings.    *****When I made it, I omitted the fennel seeds and used reduced fat ricotta.*****|`|sG5FKmAYaa	Baked whole soles,  Roast potatoes and pumpkin crescents,  Steamed carrots and peas.  2x 110g Traditional Christmas Puddings and hot custard.|`|iEsICA3Maa	Baked Chicken Nuggets:      * 3 skinless, boneless chicken breasts      * 1 cup Italian seasoned bread crumbs      * 1/2 cup grated Parmesan cheese      * 1 teaspoon salt      * 1 teaspoon dried thyme      * 1 tablespoon dried basil      * 1/2 cup butter, melted     1.

Also "drunk" is a subjective term.    If you use the legal definition of drunk, to have a BAC of above .08%, then you will have to drink 3 in an hour to get over that.  Subtract one drink for every hour of drinking.

xyE4lVcEaa	Now, this cheesecake isn't a chocolate mousse but it is amazing!!!! This is where I found the recipe http://amberskitchen.blogspot.com/2009/0... go there and look at the pictures of this cheesecake and bring a paper towl because you'll need it to wipe up all the drool! It's so good!!    It's pretty time consuming, and uses a lot of ingredients, but it's totally worth it. I though it might be too rich, but it wasn't. It was completely perfect! I did it in two parts over two days to make it easier (the brownie and the cheesecake one day and left it in the fridge to set up over night, and finished it the next day.) Here is there recipe:     Brownie Mosaic Cheesecake  As seen on Annie's Eats and Brown Eyed Baker; originally from Smitten Kitchen    For the Brownies  Ingredients  4 ounces unsweetened chocolate  3/4 cup (1 1/2 sticks) unsalted butter  13/4 cups sugar  3 eggs  1 teaspoon vanilla  1/2 teaspoon salt  1 cup flour    Directions  Preheat oven to 350F. Line 139-inch baking pan with foil, with ends of foil extending over sides of pan. Grease foil.    Microwave chocolate and butter in large microwaveable bowl on high 2 min. or until butter is melted. Stir until chocolate is completely melted. Stir in sugar. Blend in eggs and vanilla. Add flour and salt; mix well. Spread into prepared pan.    Bake 30 to 35 minute or until toothpick inserted in center comes out with fudgy crumbs (be careful not to over bake). Cool in pan on wire rack. Remove brownies from pan, using foil handles.    Cool brownies, then cut them into 3/4- to 1-inch squares for use in the cheesecake. You will have more than the two cups of cubes, loosely measured, than you will need, and Im sorry, youre just going to have to decide for yourself what to do with the extra. Add cubes to cake batter as directed below.    For the Crumb Crust  (if you like a lot of crust, go ahead and double this)  Ingredients  11/2 cups or 5 ounces finely ground Oreos, or other chocolate cookie  5 tablespoons unsalted butter, melted  1/3 cup granulated sugar  1/8 teaspoon salt    Directions  Stir together ingredients and press into bottom and 1 inch up side of a buttered 10 springform pan. Fill right away or chill for up to 2 hours.    For the Cheesecake  Ingredients  3 (8-oz) packages of cream cheese, softened  1 cup granulated sugar  4 large eggs  1 teaspoon vanilla    Directions  Make crumb crust as directed above for 10-inch cheesecake. Preheat oven to 350F.  Beat together cream cheese and sugar with an electric mixer until fluffy. Add eggs, 1 at a time, then vanilla, beating on low speed until each ingredient is incorporated and scraping down bowl between additions.    Fold brownie cubes in very gently and pour mixture into prepared pan. Put springform pan with crust in a shallow baking pan. Pour filling into crust and bake in baking pan (to catch drips) in middle of oven 45 minutes, or until cake is set 3 inches from edge but center is still slightly wobbly when pan is gently shaken.    When completely cool, top with following glaze.    For the Ganache Glaze  Ingredients  3 oz. bittersweet chocolate, finely chopped  4 tablespoons (? stick) unsalted butter  ? cup heavy cream  ? teaspoon vanilla  1 tablespoon powdered sugar    Directions  Place finely chopped chocolate in a medium size mixing bowl. Scald the butter and cream together in a saucepan (or in the microwave on high for 1 minute). Pour the cream mixture over the chocolate and stir until the chocolate is completely melted. Whisk in vanilla and then whisk in powdered sugar until smooth. Spread over cheesecake while ganache is still warm.  Chill the cheesecake until ready to serve.|`|AA10531094	Chocolate Mousse Cheesecake    NGREDIENTS (Nutrition)        * 1/2 cup chocolate cookie crumbs      * 1 pinch ground cinnamon      * 8 (1 ounce) squares semisweet chocolate      * 1 tablespoon butter      * 2 (8 ounce) packages cream cheese, softened      * 1 cup heavy whipping cream      * 1 teaspoon vanilla extract      * 2/3 cup white sugar      * 2 eggs, beaten      * 1 1/2 tablespoons unsweetened cocoa powder      * 1 1/2 cups water        * add to recipe box Add to Recipe Box        My folders:      * add to shopping list Add to Shopping List      * Customize Recipe      * add a personal note Add a Personal Note    What to Drink?

If desired, you can add grated carrot, chopped celery, chopped water chestnuts, garlic, or peas. It can be served in a bread bowl.    Bread Bowl  Use a medium size round loaf. Cut bowl-shaped hole and pull out center of loaf. Dry out the bread in oven at 200 degrees F or less until stale. Use bread from center of loaf by tearing it into chip-size pieces and use for dipping.|`|8WdFnf0Eaa	I get raves for this:    1  8 oz. package cream cheese, at room temperature  1  16 oz. tub sour cream  1 smallish shallot, finely minced   1 or 2 cloves garlic, finely minced  1 can artichoke hearts, chopped and trimmed of any tough       pieces  1 box or bag frozen spinach, thawed, drained, and        squeezed dry  sea salt and freshly ground pepper    Preheat oven to 350.  Mix all ingredients.  Carefully slice off the top and hollow out a round loaf of bread, reserving the insides to use in the dip.  Transfer the dip into the bread bowl, replace the "lid", and wrap in foil.  Place either on a cookie sheet or in a pie plate and bake for about 30 minutes.  Serve with reserved bread and crackers.    This dip is delicious either hot or cold, but the baking helps meld all the flavors, so I wouldn't recommend omitting that step.

Vegetarian diet: How to get the best nutrition  http://www.mayoclinic.com/health/vegetar...|`|5DB6nOXkaa	A common myth is that ypu need a ton of protein, in reality your body only needs about 18grams of protein per day. For me, I personally love edamame (soy beans). Steam them with a little salt and it's a delicious snack packed with more protein then meat. Also nuts and beans have lots of protein. Almonds have a lot as do black beans (try to stay away from refried beans, they're usually made with animal lard which is not vegetarian friendly)|`|NNiN0tK0aa	lentils are the legume that is highest in protein  try to eat as much dark leafy greens as you can (thats where all the vegetarians in nature get their protein - it's their staple food.  it's what they eat instead of meat)  greens, eggs and dairy contain complete protein.  for protein from other sources you have to combine   beans/lentils + grains/seeds = complete protein.  eg hoummus (chickpeas and sesame seeds) especially if eaten on bread or rice cakes  lentil dhal and rice  bean chillie and rice  lentil bolognaise and pasta  beans on toast  lentil soup and bread  bean stew and dumplings or bread  beans, sweetcorn and squash (complete - the vegetarian Native Americans ate these as their staple)  Cornflakes with soya bean milk|`|a5b833f1cecfc7eab7869f5ea4fe43f1aa	Please do more research on protein intake. Chances are, you're getting plenty. Protein is present in lots of food, including vegetables. Meat eaters actually consume WAY more protein than they need.     If you are super-concerned, up your bean intake, but really and honestly you don't need to worry about it. Worry about B12 if you're going to worry about something.|`|AA11173395	Protein is found in seitan, tofu, veggie burgers, veggie dogs, tempeh, edamame, soymilk, beans, peas, lentils, chickpeas, nuts, nut butters, seeds, oatmeal, brown rice, broccoli, potatoes, kale....    However, outside of famine conditions protein deficiency is all but unheard of.  If you consume enough calories, youre getting enough protein.    The Physicians Committee for Responsible Medicine has a Vegetarian Starter Kit which is a great place to get nutritional information:  http://www.pcrm.org/health/veginfo/vsk/|`|5I7MZjHuaa	As a couple of others have said, if you are getting enough calories, then you are getting plenty of protien. Protien deficinecies are unheard of except where there is famine.     http://www.vrg.org/nutrition/protein.htm|`|IYGahVhHaa	Do you have a lacto-ovo diet, meaning that although you are a vegetarian, you still consume dairy products?  If so, eggs are a great source of protein. So are beans, such as kidney beans, lentils and garbanzo beans and soy protein shakes.    Also: Black bean burritos are DELICIOUS!!!

If so, go for it.  Pizza is the best for sobering, don't order them though, buy them cheap and in bulk. Cupcakes/Crisps, are all good, no-one really wants to eat when you're drinking. Bread! Invest in bread, that's good for sobering.  Get people to bring their own alcohol if they can, saving you money, unless you want to limit the amount people drink.  Cider's good. Lemonade and Coke are always good for people who are straightedge ;)  Ask him to come to yours, then your parents will give you a 'lift to the cinema'. Then lead him to a room where all the people are, so they turn the lights on and pull party poppers.  Only invite people who respect you and your boyfriend.  Any mainstream songs in the charts are always good, as well as the classic sing along ones when everyone has been drinking.    Have space to dance, but also sofas and etc. for people who don't want to dance and just want to talk. If possible, one room for dancing, one room for chatting?  Do lock the rooms, people will go in even if you say you don't want them to.    Hope this helps.

Buy a corned beef brisket and cook it according to package directions except a little longer, you want the corned beef to be pull apart tender.    Mean while microwave about 2-3 potatoes until soft but still a little firm-not crispy. And put them in the fridge.    The corned beef should be done by late-ish tonight. Pull the corned beef out of the water, or baking dish. Start to shred the corned beef, include the majority of ahte fat in the pulled beef, and put it in a bowl.  Peel the potatoes and dice them real small. Mix well with the beef, and put in small zipper seal baggies. Save one for tomorrow (at least one-I'm not sure how many people you are serving. A one quart baggie will feed 2-3 people)    Tomorrow morning heat it up in a skillet and serve with eggs (Ilike over easy), hash browns-frozen or homemade-or Cowbpy style, and toast.    ----------------  Or you can aways do pnackaes/waffles with eggs, bacon, sauasge links or patties, and ham.

6QJe4Mlyaa	Yes applesauce would be considered a fruit as far as nutrition goes.  Get an unsweetened applesauce.  Better yet make your own it is very easy to make applesauce and you can flavor it with cinnamon and sweeten if you would like.  I would add a combination of sweet and tart apples to make a good flavored applesauce.  You can also make a sauce from pears, peaches, nectarines almost any fruit could be made into a sauce.  You can add a combination of fruits.  You can also make it as chunky or as smooth as you like.|`|hKlsJgVSaa	Fruit servings can come fruit juices, applesauce, dried fruit, and remember Tomatoes, and avacado's are actually fruit even though in the kitchen they are considered a veggie.    So salsa and guac are good for your fruit servings.|`|hHCdXq0Naa	ONE serving of fruit????  You need between 4-5 servings of fruits and veggies a day!

6oC80Fpraa	Peanut oil is usually recommended for deep frying, as it has a high smoke point and little taste to be transferred to the food.    Don't put chocolate, like the Snickers, in the fat.  It will melt and sputter, possible starting a fire.|`|hKlsJgVSaa	Okay here are my tips:    When frying 350 is the magic number.    You don't want anything wet with water/juice inthe fryer. So if you make your own chips or fries get them very dry. I pat mine down with a clean dish rag.    When frying foods that have a batter (wet vs dry crumps or flour etc...) wipe the tip of the food on the edge of the bowl. Then put the dipped item in the fryer. Hold the food in the oil for about 10 seconds until there gets to be a bit of a crust. This help to keep it from sticking to the bottom of the fryer and the coils.    For the most part, when something floats it is done.|`|vEJhSd0Raa	if youre frying chocolate make sure it is in a think batter, try battered pineapple rings, bananas and apples then cover in maple syrup and sesame seeds.
6oC80Fpraa	Shredded cheese.  I like cheddar in potato soup, but any cheese that melts easily will work.|`|hHCdXq0Naa	You could add some finely shredded carrot .. it has natural sweeteners in it and would add a nice flavor and color too.  You may need to add more salt before you serve it, since potatoes absorb the salt when cooking.|`|6QJe4Mlyaa	Add more stuff to the soup.  Add broth, potatoes, celery and onion.   Adding more ingredients will increase the volume of the soup diluting the spices.  Hope this works out for you.|`|EQeX35dWaa	Try putting corn or some veggies in there.   I am not sure but maybe a little sugar in there as well might help or maybe a heavy cream.  Good luck.|`|LLk11Ljqaa	Put a small pinch of sugar and a lettuce leaf (sounds crazy but it is in an official cook book) Good Luck!|`|ur3vgbXoaa	Pour off all the broth and rinse the potatoes.  Fry four pieces of bacon.    Cool and crumble.    Sautee a chopped onion in bacon grease.  Add rinsed potatoes.  Cover in half milk (or cream if you have it)  and half water.  Salt and pepper.    After you ladle the soup into the bowl, put cheese, chopped raw onions and some of the crumbled bacon on top of each serving.    This will work.|`|yqqVPcU0aa	There are some good answers so far, but they all seem to be ignoring the one ingredient that is working against your recipe here.  "Chicken flavour".  It contains MSG, and we all know, MSG is a flavour enhancer.  Which makes me wonder, if you already added chicken broth, why add chicken flavour as well?      The best way to counter-act MSG is not use MSG, once that goes in, there isn't much that can be done to save any mistakes.  The MSG in the chicken flavour will act as an enhancer to everything it touches in the pot.      The usual way of counteracting bitterness, is not adding neutral acids, but to add strong acidic flavours.  Soft rindless (no oranges, grapefruits, lemons or limes) fruit juices like apple, and berries will counter-act and compliment rosemary.    Its just pointless to add natural stock and artificial flavourings in the same recipe.  In the future, I'd loose the chicken flavouring, and simmer the soap longer but adding the rosemary last right before serving.|`|qfbDMVKKaa	Sour cream will cut the bitterness and make it creamier.|`|3MaDdoSkaa	The only thing I can think of is straining it and picking out the rosemary.When u strain it taste the broth and see if it still has the bitter taste.If it does then put new broth,water.This will fix it.If I were you though and I had the ingredients,since potatoes are cheap I would start over.Just a very few leaves of rosemary is enough.I know they don't look like leaves but they are.|`|14zk9dldaa	At this point it looks like you'll need to "over power" the rosemary. Try dumping parsley flakes in. That may calm it down a bit. Also, you could try adding some sour cream. A touch of butter (not a lot but depends oh how much you're making) Maybe a bit more onion. Milk? did you put milk in? I didn't see it but I'm assuming your putting milk in.|`|LvOYmoQGaa	bacon the answer is always bacon|`|y8aJ05z4aa	Salt.

d7dd462aaca2f3f6864eb52dbf7754d7aa	I commend you for being concerned about throwing away food. The answers that you got telling you to throw them away are WRONG. Too many people and animals are hungry in this world to just throw food away.    Diana had a great suggestion, if you don't have pets of your own. If you don't want to trouble someone all the time with your yolks, you can freeze them. I would suggest a container you can reopen easily and just add them as you collect them. Don't keep them more than a month or so and they should be fine.    Have a nice day : )|`|sfmcZ9IHaa	Throw. them. away.|`|vEJhSd0Raa	feed them to your cat or dog or neighbours pet|`|466d0df8a4110fb75f51028e25c34d52aa	oh my goodness............  either buy a carton of "just egg whites" which are delicious  or make these>>>>>>>delicious    These Meringue Cookies are so airy, sweet and crisp that they seem to almost melt in your mouth. I love how the outsides of the meringues are nice and crisp, yet the insides remain wonderfully soft and puffy, almost like mini-Pavlovas. While I often eat these just as they are, they also make a very nice plated dessert. Place one meringue in the center of your plate and top with whipped cream, or ice cream (sherbet), and fresh fruit.     Meringue Cookies are made with just two main ingredients: stiffly beaten egg whites and superfine (caster) sugar. To ensure the egg whites reach maximum volume, have your mixing bowl and beaters clean and free of grease. It is easier to separate your eggs while they are cold. Once separated, cover the egg whites and let them come to room temperature before using (about 30 minutes). Cover and refrigerate the egg yolks for another use. Superfine sugar makes the best meringues as it dissolves easier in the whites. To make your own, take 3/4 cup (150 grams) granulated white sugar and process in your food processor until very fine.     There are a few things to keep in mind when making meringue cookies. The standard ratio when making hard meringues is 1/4 cup (50 grams) of granulated white sugar for every egg white. This amount of sugar is needed to give the meringue its crispness. Adding the sugar gradually to the egg whites ensures that the sugar completely dissolves and does not produce a gritty meringue. Cream of tartar is used in the whipping of egg whites to stabilize them and allows them to reach maximum volume. Also, it is a good idea to use parchment paper or aluminum foil to line your baking sheets, not wax paper, as the meringue will sometimes stick to wax paper.    Baking the meringues in a slow oven allows for gradual evaporation of the moisture from the meringues.  If the oven temperature is too high, the outside of the meringue will dry and set too quickly. You will also notice that the outside of the meringue separates from the inside. Another indicator that your oven is too high is when the meringue starts to brown which causes the sugar to caramelize. If this happens, lower the temperature about 25 degrees F. If you decide to make meringues on a rainy or humid day, you will probably have to bake the meringues longer (could be up to 30 minutes more) than on a dry day. Lastly, to prevent cracking of the meringues, do not open the oven door during the first half of the baking time.       Preheat oven to 200 degrees F (105 degrees C) and place the rack in the center of your oven. Line a baking sheet with parchment paper. You can form the cookies with a pastry bag fitted with a 1/2 inch (1.25 cm) plain tip, or I often just use two spoons to make the cookies.     In the bowl of your electric mixer, with the whisk attachment, beat the egg whites on low-medium speed until foamy. Add the cream of tartar and continue to beat the whites until they hold soft peaks. Add the sugar, a little at a time, and continue to beat until the meringue holds very stiff peaks. Beat in the vanilla extract.      Note: The meringue is done when it holds stiff peaks and when you rub a little between your thumb and index finger it does not feel gritty. If it feels gritty the sugar has not fully dissolved so keep beating until it feels smooth between your fingers.    Before placing the cookies on the cookie sheet, place a little of the meringue on the underside of each corner of the parchment paper. This will prevent the paper from sliding.  Transfer the meringue to a pastry bag fitted with a 1/2 inch (1.25 cm) tip. Pipe 2 1/2 inch (6 cm) rounds of meringue in rows on the prepared baking sheet.  Alternatively, spoon mounds of meringue, using two spoons, onto the prepared sheets. Sprinkle with a few shaved almonds, if desired.    Bake the meringues for approximately 1 1/2 to 1 3/4 hours, rotating the baking sheet from front to back (about half way through) to ensure even baking. The meringues are done when they are pale in color and fairly crisp. Turn off the oven, open the door a crack, and leave the meringues in the oven to finish drying overnight.    Makes about 10 - 2 1/2 inch (6 cm) meringues         Meringue Cookies:    3 large egg whites (3 ounces or 90 grams)    1/4 teaspoon cream of tartar    3/4 cup (150 grams) superfine or caster sugar (if you don't have superfine sugar simply take granulated white sugar and process it for about 30 seconds in a food processor)    1/4 teaspoon  pure vanilla extract    Garnish:    1/4 cup shaved Almonds    -|`|Vhq3GURQaa	I have read all the above answers.

If you live a healthy lifestyle you should have no reason to be concerned about 'heart health.'    You've been brainwashed by marketing/fad diet bs so drink bleach for all I care, you obvously have no common sense.    I wasn't being rude, you're just a stupid human being, that's all.  You don't like yolks so you come here looking for what to do with them?  How about you just get over it and deal with them yourself. BTW you mentioned heart-health so make up your mind, are you just a whiney picky eater or a hippie granola eater who thinks eliminating egg yolks will make their life better?|`|5uxo43rRaa	I've often thought about this, and though the only thing I've ever actually done is make lemon curd (its a tasty topping/filling on cakes or other baked goods), which you could give to a friend or family member, though then you're just passing on the yolks to your loved ones :)   If you have pets, they might like the yolks mixed into some of their kibble.

Most young people find the caffeine gives them the GO to start doing things and running about so the blood pressure is needed and activity uses up the tension. The problem comes when people just sit at a desk all day and drink one cup after another. If you're active you have no problem.  OLGA|`|vxjLI5vbaa	That's way too much coffee dude...

Also, you can become dependent on it to stay awake.|`|VVF5lPXxaa	It's a lot. yes, & you can damage yourself. it's a Central Nervous Stimulant. It blocks receptors to do this.

Of course you could try DeCaf cofee|`|YuYSL0A2aa	That much caffeine isn't good for you with or with out sugar. I don't think it would be as bad for you if you drank decaff instead. They say some coffee( 2-3 cups) is actually good for you. Your daily cup of joe may reduce the risk of type 2 diabetes, Alzheimers disease, and more. It also packs a powerful punch of antioxidants. In fact, Americans get more antioxidants from coffee than from any other food or beverage. With just two calories per 8-ounce cup (no cream or sugar) and no fat, coffee is a pretty guilt-free way to boost your health. But dont overdo it. More than 2 or 3 cups daily may increase blood pressure, especially in those with borderline or high readings.|`|AT1aPNHUaa	Yes that much is VERY unhealthy and its habit forming stop now and try to drink 3 day.
Lv3G7E3Eaa	Okay, here's what you do.  Get your coffee maker.  Make as much coffee as it will make at once (should be about twelve cups).  Ice it, throw in a ton of creamer and real sugar.

iHFZLsDTaa	First of all, start taking a vitamin-mineral tablet each day to get what your body needs most.    Once per day drink V-8 Fusion (I like the mango drink best), and V-8 Juice.  Both will give you your daily requirements of fruits and veggies in order to stay well.    It's time to learn to cook for yourself.  Make a grocery list and go shopping.  Ask a clerk to help you find what you need.    Scroll down this screen for great vegetable recipes:    http://southernfood.about.com/library/re...    Ask a clerk to show you where the boxed dinners are.  They have flavor packets inside the boxes.  My favorite are the Pasta-Roni boxed dinners, but there are many others to choose from.    Have your mom teach you how to make hard boiled eggs.  Cook one for each day's afternoon snack and keep them in the fridge.    Fried egg sandwiches are good for breakfast, lunch or dinner.  I like mine with mayo.    You can now buy veggie burgers at the store.  Ask a clerk to help you find them.|`|1aa219c3a6ee161ab1b4130ceb16aa6baa	Turkey or Chicken, Eggs,     All fruits are pretty good    Make a salad to get vegetables, you know, lettuce and other vegetables you like|`|vEJhSd0Raa	rather than worrying about what you don't like think about all you do like and eat a varied diet with different coloured fruit and veg and try to get protein from dairy and pulses.|`|0ff2304aa58946a2151ca64e5d9e7cd9aa	Well, you asked for it.  Really, you did.  You answered another question and said, "Now answer mine."  You're 13 and I should never judge you because you know what you're talking about but you're that picky that you need to ask here what you can eat that's healthy.    You needed to meet my grandmother.  When she asked who wanted dessert and someone asked what it was she replied, "You're full.  You may leave the table."    What you really need is to train yourself to be less picky.  A three-day wilderness hike watching others fill their bellies on the food you turn your nose up at would do you good.  I'm willing to bet that one or both of your parents are picky and you're blindly following in their tracks.  I read your list, but I'm sure you could make it longer.  You should make dinner for your family at least twice a week--on a really low budget, so you can't cheat with shrimp or clams.  I'll start you off with ham and pea soup--get the dried peas, ham hocks and whatever else is needed, cook the ham hocks the day before and skim the fat when cold.  Take the meat off the bone and finish the soup.  Learn how to please others, not yourself.
vKEYa8aeaa	im not a vegan anymore because of my pregnancy [personal choice really]. when i was vegan i ate ALOT of beans, they are high in protein. also, make sure you take a GREAT multivitamin daily just to make sure you are getting all the nutrients your body needs. it is very easy to become anemic, i became anemic when i was a vegan because when i first became a vegan i didnt educate myself on what i needed to eat and supplements i shouldve been taking. my advise to you is to eat alot of different types of beans, also take a prenatal vitamin [even if you arent pregnant or planning on becoming pregnant]. prenatal vitamins are great for you, pregnant or not. they have great amounts of all the supplements you need and iron. if you start to get symptoms of anemia [bruising easily, getting worn out and tired easily, etc] go to the doc and get a simple blood test done, if you do end up being a lil anemic they will give you an iron supplement to take on the side.     good luck!    EDIT: also, being a vegan/vegetarian doesnt make you tired at all! you are actually more energized! the reason some people say that it makes you tired is because anemia causes you to get tired quicker, and people think that everyone thats vegan/vegetarian is going to become anemic    EDIT: actually, vegetarians DO drink milk, eat eggs, etc. they just dont eat MEAT or anything that the animal has to die to give up. vegans are the ones that dont consume anything that comes from an animal in any way.|`|llkSmgLJaa	Only junk food vegetarians get anemic. Do your research and you will be fine. We get protein from: beans, peas, nuts, seeds, and whole grains. Many vegetarians eat eggs and dairy also.     Get the Vegetarian Starter Kit from -   Physicians Committee for Responsible Medicine   http://www.pcrm.org/health/veginfo/vsk/     You want to get yourself a couple vegetarian cookbooks also, like this one.  Becoming Vegetarian: The Complete Guide to Adopting a Healthy Vegetarian Diet - Vesanto Melina & Brenda Davis|`|AT1aPNHUaa	Being a vegetarian actually gives you more energy than meat does! I recommend taking vitamins if you begin to get a health problem after being a vegetarian, try it out you have nothing to loose. Good luck!|`|QjoWA99Yaa	They can become anaemic because mosy people get their iron from meat but eating lots of leafy green veg (also a good source of iron) can combat that. :)|`|8IfePMa3aa	Protein is the easy part. A lot of newbies really mess up in the iron department and go anemic.  You don't need to take pills or anything, just become friends with the Nutrition Facts box and get a well rounded diet.|`|zJi5Cjpiaa	no, only vegetarians who live off of side dishes get anemia. Eat mainly fresh fruits and veggies,whole grains,and beans.|`|PQRcItmdaa	Try to get a lot of protein. Milk and beans have a lot of that! If you really want to become one, just remember that. You could also go to a nutritionist, they will help you. Even give you a list of products that would be good.|`|VMPPkytEaa	^^ at the1st answer; vegetarians don't drink milk unless they are lacto vegetarians.    im not sure how to answer your question, but peta2.com can help :)|`|IegOHQXOaa	A well rounded colorful diet! That's it! =p     What I like to look at is the list of the "worlds healthiest foods":   http://www.whfoods.com/foodstoc.php   (ignoring the non veggie parts of course) and cram as many of those veggies and fruits etc into my diet as possible.   I've been vegan for 6 years and vegetarian prior and I have experienced nothing but amazing health.   Now personally, I haven't had to deal with any heavy equipment to be a vegan save Veglife's iron supplements however everyone is different and I would really urge you to search for vegetarian friendly multivitamins and supplements.     tips: It's easy to find vegetarian friendly processed foods and get sucked into just eating those but do not thrive on those alone. Becoming vegetarian also means becoming a good enough cook to feed yourself.    Good luck and welcome to an animal friendly world.
GoEdpprvaa	It's like you have no control over staying still. Your head keeps spinning & you can't stare at anything. You hear things like they're far away. It almost feels like you kinda "leave your body" & are looking at yourself from outside sometimes. The first time I got really drunk (not just drank) was when I was 14. It's fun mann..it makes me just laugh & feel happy at everything. :]|`|wV9nMhqAaa	You feel social and really happy...Its hard to stay coordinated and focused...i think the first time I ever did it was when I was 16 or maybe 17 I don't know|`|FQ3X9Kdlaa	You sound like you're curious about it so:    First off, it's not a ritual.  You don't become a man for having gotten drunk.     That said, if you really want to know what it feels like, it's great, you get a good buzzed all over feeling.      You lose your inhibitions, those things that hold you back from saying the things you want to say but just don't have to courage to.    When you're 'buzzed' and feeling good the only thing you want to do is drink more to get more of that good feeling.  This is a huge mistake which you will pay the price for (assuming you do try it).  Drinking more won't increase the good feeling, it will end up with your face in the toilet for the rest of the day.    If you want to call anything a ritual it will be going through that.    Oh, my first experience was at around 14.  I had some friends come over at lunch at school and somehow we got into my stepdads liquor cabinet.  They poured a bunch of different stuff in a glass and dared me to drink it.  I could barely walk to the next class and passed out on my desk in math class.  The teacher asked me to move to another desk for some unknown (this really pissed me off because moving was what going to make me barf so it's like she knew and just wanted to make me suffer).  I moved to where she said and soon barfed on the girl in front of me and all over the floor.  It kind of was ironic because no one liked that girl.    What's it like when you're drunk?    When you're drunk you just don't give a sh!t|`|xO9S1d24aa	I stopped drinking 7 years ago, I was up to 10 bottles of burbon a week, it almost killed me, but in short, being drunk is losing control, and a waste of time, ...time that you can never get back.|`|WKKdQq2Aaa	what the F-*CK is wrong with you?

JPssvCAvaa	If you can get alcohol free beer, then mix it with some ginger beer or lemonade.     Apple juice can be on the tart side too but a squeeze of lemon takes away the sweetness. Infuse those spices used for mulled wine with it.    Lasse is good that is a sort of yogurt smoothy.    Iced coffee, make it strong and white with a little sugar to taste. Serve with a whip of that cream from an aerosol can on top to impress add some cocoa like a cappuchino.    Another great one is pina collada. Pineapple juice, canned coconut milk and a dash of lime cordial. Blend together with ice. you may need a little cows milk with it too.

ddMJr1l1aa	It's fine for children.    Alcohol once it reaches a temperature of 170 degrees begins to evaporate.  While 100% of the alcohol does not evaporate about 99.7% does. That .07% left over is not harmful in any way.    You will want to keep it at at least 170 degrees for about 5 minutes.    What kind of dish are you making btw?|`|SOPVLyjoaa	Alcohol boils away at a lower temperature than water, so if you bring something to a boil or simmer, then the alcohol will completely evaporate over time.    Of course, how long it takes depends on how much wine you put in.  The best way to test is to smell the steam.  You will be able to tell when the alcohol has dissipated.    I cook tomato sauces for my kids with white wine and there have been no drunken stupors yet!|`|2c556debd7c1c18834aeac39fbfe496caa	All of the alcohol evaporates and it is safe for everyone..People have been cooking with it for hundreds of years..There is no harm.|`|Kus73aMQaa	I use cooking wine all the time with my family. As a general rule I add the wine at least ten to twenty minutes before the dish should be done cooking.

nwcJI64naa	If you keep it in the refrigerator it'll be just fine. I've done that many times. Believe it or not, though, coffee starts getting moldy pretty fast. Even a couple days at room temperature and it could start growing stuff.    So I'd say a max of 4 days refrigerated and you'll be fine. Of course it won't taste nearly as good as fresh coffee though. ;)|`|fBW54cAraa	You could keep it in the fridge, but coffee tends to get bitter as it ages.  If you use a lot of sugar, or don't mind the bitterness, go for it.  But when I worked in food service we had to make fresh coffee every two hours so as not to upset the coffee snobs.
wLgGD63raa	Simple syrup is just equal parts sugar and water by volume. So one cup sugar would call for one cup of water. Two cups sugar would call for two cups of water. It is very easy and simple to make (hence the name). All you have to do is heat pot of water over medium heat and stir in the sugar until it dissolves, remove it from the heat and let it cool.<br>  <br>  It doesn't take that long to make either, so I would not walk away from the stove as it can quickly go bad.<br>  <br>  If you want you can add some mint, ginger, or cinnamon sticks to your simple syrup and let it steep for a couple of minutes after the cooking process. This will add those extra flavors to your simple syrup and you can use it for different things.<br>  <br>  I put lemon zest in mine and use it over ricotta pancakes as a syrup.|`|alIO8ic0aa	Ingredients:<br>  <br>  2 parts sugar<br>  1 part water<br>  <br>  Preparation:<br>  <br>  Bring the water to a boil. <br>  Dissolve the sugar into the boiling water. <br>  Once the sugar is dissolved completely, remove the pan from the heat. <br>  Allow to cool completely and bottle|`|ozWi3TJlaa	Equal parts sugar and water.  There are different methods, some include cooking it, some don't.  Cooking it takes some practice and don't turn the temp too high (med.-high should be sufficient to get it to a boil) or you'll burn the sugar.  Crystals will form on the sides of the pan,  just use a pastry brush to brush them back into the liquid.  When it's a little syrupy, take it off the heat and let it cool.<br>  <br>  Last week I made it by adding  2 cups of boiling water to 2 cups of sugar in a bowl (non-reactive and not glass) and stirring them together until the sugar was incorporated.  Then I refrigerated it.  This worked really well and wasn't as tedious.|`|sP98NDi5aa	If you don't want to go through the trouble, 7 up works as well.|`|mJHpI6J6aa	Ingredients:<br>  <br>      * 2 parts sugar<br>      * 1 part water<br>  <br>  Preparation:<br>  <br>     1.

7gpDLc6daa	You have to be 18, doesn't matter if you are drinking or not.  However, most places won't care and will let you in and serve you anyway. Ask around, if other people your age have gotten in then give it a shot, all they can do is refuse you entry and you'll go home.|`|hKlsJgVSaa	It really depends:    Some clubs let minors in on certian nights or for certian events. You will either get a wrist band that says you are under age or of age.    The club may be closed for a private party, this would enable you to get in.    Or you can sneak in, I guess.|`|iFCBEZW7aa	Yeah, you can. But make sure not to sneak any drinks because you could get alot of trouble.|`|kQf5TbUFaa	sure?????  good for the club to keep teens out of alcohol     answer mine|`|tsoc9tihaa	the bar would serve anyone let in if its an over 18s bar.  so no i wouldnt think it is true.  im guessing youd have be 18 get in.      but 12 years old get in clubs these days.  dress up and u might have a shot.|`|ZcovejOkaa	Yes I went to a club when I was under 18, but if you drink you are breaking the law.

If they don't have the underage licence but the clubs closed for that party only you still may be allowed in..    You could always try and sneak in and hope no-one stops and asks you for i.d, but if the police go into the club you risk getting in trouble with them and i imagine that it would be quite embarrasing to be caught and chucked out while your in there.    Your best bet is to ring the club and ask :)|`|aYICSwMpaa	Hi    No club will let you in under ages else everyone under aged would just say they wont drink and then do it anyway....    Are you in UK?    If so you have to be 18 (however if you look over 18 they wont ask you for ID so just wear sommit that makes you look older than you are)    X|`|ePZN6RG3aa	Yeah, the club may be for over 18's but that's because it's full of drunk people and they will be serving drink.  If you do drink you could get in massive trouble, so just wait until you turn 18. I think i have heard before 16- 17 if you are sitting down for a meal you can have one glass of drink with your meal. I'm not sure though.

5zNwBQZHaa	To be very honest - ground meat doesn't have a heck of a lot of taste to it.  What we are picking up when eating a hamburger is the taste of salt, the mouth feel of the fat and the texture of the meat.    If you notice, no soy meat tries to pretend it is a steak - they all try to pretend to be ground meat.    So if you take something like Textured Soy Protein (TVP or TSP) granules, hydrate them in salty water, mix them up in a sauce like marinara or stroganoff - we are going to have a hard time detecting that it is fake meat, not real meat.    Same thing for soy patties like Boca - they try to duplicate the texture of the meat, the 'tug' you make when you pull a bit away from the patty - the salt and the fat.    Try this - cook some crumbled ground beef until done - do not add any seasoning, and eat it plain.  You'll notice there isn't a lot of taste in that.|`|llkSmgLJaa	Your tasting the amino acids, salts and fats in soy meat, they are  similar to the one's found in animal meat.

If not brown enough, position the basket facing the Heating Element and turn the " Pause-to-Sear" switch to "off". Rotate 2 to 3 minutes more on each side.   heat your bbq sauce in a microwave before applying to meat. you can apply just a few minutes before removing from the showtime. or remove from showtime dip in sauce and serve immediately. let me know when and I will be over.    IF YOU DO NOT PAR BOIL THEM JUST SAMPLE A SMALL PIECE FROM TIME TO TIME UNTIL THEY ARE HOW YOU LIKE THEM.  ( 20 to 35 minutes )
q4ppgGe1aa	INGREDIENTS         * 2 cups white sugar      * 1 3/4 cups all-purpose flour      * 3/4 cup unsweetened cocoa powder      * 1 1/2 teaspoons baking powder      * 1 1/2 teaspoons baking soda      * 1 teaspoon salt      * 2 eggs      * 1 cup milk      * 1/2 cup vegetable oil      * 2 teaspoons vanilla extract      * 1 cup boiling water    DIRECTIONS       1. Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease and flour two nine inch round pans.     2. In a large bowl, stir together the sugar, flour, cocoa, baking powder, baking soda and salt. Add the eggs, milk, oil and vanilla, mix for 2 minutes on medium speed of mixer. Stir in the boiling water last. Batter will be thin. Pour evenly into the prepared pans.     3. Bake 30 to 35 minutes in the preheated oven, until the cake tests done with a toothpick. Cool in the pans for 10 minutes, then remove to a wire rack to cool completely.    It's easy to make and not crazy sweet, though you might want to use 1/2 a cup less sugar than the recipe states.     I made it today and it turned out perfect.     Good luck!!|`|dqqtmhdnaa	Heya,  Chocolate victoria sponge cake.

MBFtwQSVaa	Die Feige ist die einzige Frucht, die nur am Baum ausreift, leider nicht durch Lagerung. Darum gibt es in Deutschland, keine frischen reifen Feigen, da sie den Transport nicht überleben würden. Essen kann man sie mit und ohne Schale au?er den Stengel. Als Zutat mit rohen Schinken werden sie natürlich gesch?lt. übrigens Zuckerfeigen sind hellgrün und sind innen leicht r?tlich, die blauen Feigen haben dunkelrotes Fruchtfleisch. Haben Feigen erst mal einen wei?en Schimmer, sind sie hinüber, man sollte sie tunlichst nicht mehr essen.|`|00429c84f259793fc2275afe17bcf189aa	Einfach aufbrechen oder sch?len wie eine Banane und - das Innere essen.

Du schneidest sie oben vorsichtig ein, oder versuchst sie auseinanderzureissen, sehr vorsichtig. Dann l?ffelst Du den Inhalt. Diese Frucht dient in der Form der Frische eigentlich für die Weihnachtsküche in Deutschland. So schmeckt sie herrlich mit Marzipan oder einem leichten Schaum aus Marzipan und Sahne, sie schmeckt pur natürlich auch. Sie ist für uns in Deutschland eine Dekofrucht (meistens auch sehr teuer und empfindlich). Allerdings finde ich dass sie herrlich zur Erg?nzung eines tollen Essens passt, Walnusseis, ein Spiegel aus einer milchigen Frucht darunter, etwas Sahne daneben, ein bisschen Marzipanrohmasse, vielleicht etwas Rumrosinen in die Sahne oder in das Marzipan und dann zwei drei Scheiben der frischen Feige.

Je dunkler die grüne Schale ist, desto sü?er und cremiger ist das Fruchtfleisch. Feigen, frisch sollten auf leichten Druck etwas nachgeben, aber nicht zu weich sein. Das Fruchtfleisch kann hellrosa bis dunkelrot sein und ist mit kleinen essbaren Samen durchsetzt. Unreife Feigen sollte man nicht essen, da sie einen wei?en Milchsaft abgeben, der leicht ?tzend wirkt. Feigen kann man mit Schale essen, oder die Frucht halbieren und das Fruchtfleisch ausl?ffeln. Frische Feigen schmecken auch sehr gut in Obstsalaten oder mit herzhaften Zutaten wie Schinken, K?se oder Salami kombiniert. Man kann Feigen auch im Ofen überbacken. Sehr gut schmeckt auch selbstgekochte Feigenmarmelade. Frische Feigen sollten m?glichst schnell verbraucht werden, da man sie nur wenige Tage im Gemüsefach vom Kühlschrank aufbewahren kann. Feigen, frisch sind reich an Vitamin A, B und C. Sie enthalten die Mineralstoffe Kalium, Magnesium, Eisen und Phosphor sowie Ballaststoffe, weshalb sie verdauungsf?rdernd sind.guten hunger...lg|`|XqdeIXC8aa	Wie gegeben?<br>  <br>  Kann man mit Schale Essen wenn man sie gut abgewaschen hat, dann einfach nur kurz oben bisle wegschneiden und unten.

cfdc405defe60d37e2129e3f90174096aa	I am a former chef and here the scoop, Cocoa bean are the whole thing the Cocoa Nibs are the centre of the cocoa bean used to make cocoa and chocolate, cocoa is a dried defatted cocoa nib pressing with an alkaline to keep it from solidifying.<br>  <br>  They remove the nibs from the cocoa bean shell, then grind and press in a machine called a "Concher" it is like a steam rolling that mixes and press the chocolate or cocoa solid with sugar to make a cocoa mass, this is them processed into dark semi sweet, milk and more sugar for milk chocolate, white chocolate is not chocolate it is a milk and sugar preparation with cocoa butter removed during the pressing process.<br>  <br>  Cocoa is dried and powdered and use in place of melted chocolate, I use both when making a cake, brownie or sauce, and the higher the cocoa solid, you will see bars marked with a 70-90% number on the package label, this mean that it is higher in the essential cocoa solids and is less sweetened. I buy 70 & 85% here in Toronto Canada and have 3 square occasionally, but for the richest and most flavourful chocolate items, cocoa plus high mass dark chocolate, it is the best.

wPM6eBkWaa	Based on the ingredients listed, I would add 2 tablespoons, give a taste and add 1 more if not chocolate enough.|`|UIXKTaghaa	You need to make sure that you don't mix in cocoa dry or it will make the cake dry.<br>  <br>  What I do when making a cake of that size is add 2 generous heaped tablespoon of cocoa to a cup and usually 2 to 4 tablespoons of boiling water to it to turn it into a thick liquid (not too runny, but runny enough to come off the spoon or pool at the bottom of the cup)  before adding it to the cake mix.<br>  <br>  If you want a really good tip for a good lightweight sponge, then weigh your eggs.  I always weigh the eggs and add exactly the same weight of flour, butter and sugar for a really good texture.<br>  <br>  Also don't forget cocoa itself reacts with the baking powder in a cake so what I would suggest is that you use plain flour rather than self raising and reduce your baking powder by 1/2 and add a 1/2 teaspoon of bicarb of soda instead of the full quantity of baking powder.  Typically for a 8 to 4 cake I would add 3 teaspoons of baking powder usually, but for a 4 oz cake with cocoa I would probably add 3/4 teaspoon baking powder and just under 1/2 bicarb of soda - but that's probably being too picky for your needs!!|`|PX88XNJcaa	Why not just make the sponge cake as normal and cover it with chocolate and a contrasting filling.   :D|`|AA11786341	three tablespoons|`|RlZvWkSIaa	Add a couple tablespoons or so.
