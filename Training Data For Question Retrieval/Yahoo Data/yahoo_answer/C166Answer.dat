5axGfFofaa	A chemical pregnancy is like a cruel joke. You take an early pregnancy test around the time your period is due that shows a faint positive. Naturally, you get excited and start spreading the joyful news that you're expecting. Then, a few days later you get your period and the doctor says, "It was just a chemical pregnancy." <br>  <br>  Meanwhile, you're left confused and possibly devastated. The term chemical pregnancy sounds like a false positive pregnancy test, as if you were not really pregnant at all. But the truth is that a chemical pregnancy was indeed a conception and is actually a very early miscarriage.|`|RPszYGXkaa	When I had one, my doctor defined a chemical pregnancy as a very early miscarriage, so they are on in the same.<br>  I had almost the same thing happen to me last fall...two faint positives, then negatives, then AF.<br>  I didn't really have any major issues, but had I not tested, I really wouldn't have known b/c I was only "late" by 4 days.  My period lasted about a day longer than usual, but the clotting, cramps, etc seemed very comparable to other normal cycles.<br>  Best wishes and I am sorry for your loss.|`|bebee00e4f3a4e5d156594de8d4a527eaa	Honestly I think they are the same thing.|`|klrQ9yFlaa	It sounds like a miscarriage to me but, you could never be to sure. The best thing to do is go to the doctor and find out what is happening. Also, you need to be examined if you were really pregnant to make sure that their are not anything left inside of you to cause an infection.<br>  <br>  Good Luck and I hope you feel better
fWAzJIEkaa	Hey!<br>  I ahvent heard of it either, but done a lil research for u =)<br>  Heres what i found :<br>  Ovulex Pills are designed help the female body hormonally tuned and prepared to conceive a healthy new child, without drugs or synthetic chemicals. When using Ovulex pills you can get pregnant at a time that is appropriate for you, on your schedule. Ovulex Pills do not have any risks or side effects to an unborn child and do not give artificial multiple births.<br>  The blend of botanicals that make up Ovulex? is the result of the international research of multiple universities, scientists and doctors over the past two decades. The ingredients in Ovulex? have been demonstrated through innumerable documented studies to effectively and safely bring balance to most women's hormones and help normalize menstrual cycles by directly affecting the length of time for ovulation. <br>  <br>  This balance is essential to increasing your chances of becoming pregnant. Ovulex? does not over stimulate your ovaries to release multiple ova (eggs) throughout your cycle, or multiple times during your cycle. It also does not “force” pregnancy on your reproductive organs but assists your body in achieving it all on its own. <br>  <br>  For many women, infertility is due to a shortened or irregular menstrual cycle. The ingredients in Ovulex? have a specific action allowing for a longer ovulation period, giving you a greater opportunity to conceive. Ovulex? is also designed to help relax the uterus and at the same time strengthen the walls of the uterus, helping to avoid or stop early miscarriages (in the first trimester, some even before you realize you may be pregnant). <br>  <br>  Ovulex? contains a proprietary blend of ingredients that are good for your overall wellbeing by helping strengthen your immune system and help reduce reactions to stress, to very important factors for maintaining a regular menstrual cycle and a healthy environment for the growth of a new baby. You can see why Ovulex? works so well. <br>  <br>  How Ovulex? Was Discovered <br>  <br>  You'll be shocked when you learn how and why Ovulex? was first made and used. One of the scientists at Selmedica Healthcare, the makers of Ovulex?, had read a particularly heartbreaking story about a woman who had nearly committed suicide because her depression had made her so despondent. <br>  <br>  Because Selmedica is known for creating 100% natural products that are used by people with a wide variety of health conditions, this scientist began to wonder if he and his team could create something to help women like the one he had read about. <br>  <br>  After studying and understanding the main causes of infertility, the Selmedica team focused their attention on the types of infertility that did not require surgery due to blocked fallopian tubes or other anatomical problems. <br>  <br>  After a long R&D process, they came up with the unique 100% botanical formula that is now known as Ovulex?. They were overjoyed when their clinical studies and tests began to show that the ingredients in Ovulex? were actually helping woman to become pregnant.<br>  <br>  <br>  U should google and search some of the forums.. alot of people say it hasnt worked...<br>  <br>  <br>  But to be honest, the best thing to do is to go and speak to ur doctor, i know uv probably heard this a million times before, and probably fed up hearing it, but its best thing, as every woman is different, and if u buy something that hasnt been prescribed for u by the docs, u can actually cause more harm.<br>  So please please please, go and seek doctors advice before making any decisions =)<br>  <br>  Hope it has helped!|`|AA12228565	I have never heard of Ovulex, but I should look into it too.
OI3bf4yjaa	Having green poo is perfectly normal. (Surprisingly)  Did she eat a lot of blue foods? Like kool aid, or icing on a cake? I read that a lot of blue or green foods can cause green poop.|`|d666c2be64ceba00657540ace50128e4aa	It's normal.  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  If it's like a "lizard green" and diarrhea though with a very foul smell it's a sign of Rota-virus.  If that's the case then call your pediatrician immediately.|`|fyIxQTl6aa	if you want to know exactly what whats wrong I would take her to a doctor.|`|VWAdVZ43aa	nothing is wrong.........SHE AINT GONNA DIE FROM GREEN CRAP|`|AA11537580	did she eat or drink something blue?<br>  blue dyes cause green poop|`|gfgln6v9aa	nothing is wrong, Green poop is natural|`|1s3nddaYaa	is she drinking whole milk? my sons has been green like neonish green since he started whole milk.
P1xlrvAaaa	Yes it is.My friends called me "heat"while I was pregnant bc every minute I was way horny.I did this the entire pregnancy even when I was super sick.If you had a shorter lighter period wait andtake a test in a few days.Good luck!|`|PBY9MNDFaa	Is it possible you are ovulating already?  This happens to me when I ovulate, I just put it down to Mother Nature trying to get me pregnant!  Anyway, I'm not sure if you are ttc, but if you are then you might be aware of the differences in your cervical mucus at different times of the month.  If you are ovulating you should have cervical mucus that is similar to egg white.  I think this is the most likely cause of why you are craving sex.  Check out www.ovulation-calendar.com (or co.uk can't remember sorry).  This explains the changes in the mucus at different times.|`|3X0t8JrXaa	Sex is the last thing you think about early on in pregnancy...you're too tired and queezy for that.  And you certainly wouldn't be having cravings yet.  Maybe the sex at home is just good :-)|`|xpstigPTaa	I wanted to rip my husbands head off for the first couple weeks of my pregnancy! The poor guy couldn't do a dang thing right!!! haha best of luck!|`|r6NJrasBaa	it never happened to me,, if your period is super light, then get a test to make sure|`|Z1e3Cxjoaa	No it's not.|`|5yAsj29Vaa	Well, you got your period, so you're likely not pregnant.  No, being horny is not a sign of pregnancy.|`|nAOlBmzDaa	more of a 'side effect' than a 'symptom'... <br>  <br>  i wouldnt say it MEANS you are pregnant, but some women do get very high libidos DURING pregnancy...<br>  <br>  gl!
lRq81lu7aa	You need to go to Babies R Us, or Target, or even Wal Mart.<br>  <br>  Start a baby registry at one of the stores and I know for a fact that Babies R Us should have a check list of their suggested items to get.  That is a good place to start.  <br>  <br>  Babies R Us also has a web site and should give you some ideas.<br>  <br>  go here Babiesrus.com  <br>  <br>  Hope this helps and good luck!|`|9ro8fiKvaa	Ask anyone you know to give you a list of what they feel are the neccessitites to have when your babies arrive. Pick and choose from the list the things that YOU feel are neccessary - then just multiply by 4. Do NOT go and ask a salesperson at ANY store you are considering registering at. Registering is a GREAt idea ... don't get me wrong. However, you need to be armed with a list first. Babies do not need everything that the stores sell, so don't get sucked in to buying stuff you don't need. If you know that you re going to have lots of help, and want to save some cash consider a diaper service. They work out cheaper, it's better for your babies's behind and it's less hassle than running out of diapers when you'll need a constant supply! Good luck!|`|PkWX9Ouwaa	I hope you will be able to get a lot of help.  I can't imagine 4 newborns at once.<br>  <br>  Make sure to have enough clothes, socks, hats, and blankets to keep them warm.  You can live without a lot of the extras but I would start stockpiling diapers now.<br>  <br>  Babies-R-Us gives you a checklist that is nice but the prices there are pretty steep.  Target and Wal-Mart provide better prices for all the essentials.  Good luck|`|b5ae6c4a0700956c375f37b49f896632aa	first and foremost, congratulations :).. now i would recommend freecycle network since there is a lot of things that you can get for free (and most of them are barely used or even new)..|`|KICQQxLxaa	yeah, I really believe this.<br>  <br>  You are due in about 3 months, and have yet to buy anything??  And you need to know what to get and where to shop??<br>  <br>  If you were really having 4 babies, I think you would have started shopping and getting organized MUCH earlier than this, especially since quads rarely make it to their due date....|`|X6as2nOAaa	You will need everything, cribs, changing tables, diapers, bottles and a lot, bottle scrubber, clothes, burb cloths, bibs, socks, diaper genie, if you want that. bassanets maybe, blankets, bath items, soap and lotion that is all I can think of at the moment.|`|Cwqkbp49aa	Wow!<br>  <br>  Can you get a sponsor from any of the big companies?  They may help with diapers or formula.<br>  <br>  Otherwise, get the basics.  It all depends on your budget.  Wal-mart, Kmart, and Target carry most of what you want.  Babies R Us runs a lot of specials, so check them out when they are switching things out.  Maybe try Ikea or Baby Depot at Burlington.  There are also high end stores you can go to.  The main things to look for are probably:<br>  <br>  Car seats, bouncy seats, cribs, changing tables, toys/mobiles, strollers, bedding, onesies, bottles, formula, diapers, and a whole lot of support and help!  Maybe you can ask family, friends, and neighbors for that.|`|E5CnUdhsaa	well you will need the neccessities such as car seats (one each)<br>  push chair suitable(might be better to browse online for this)<br>  my auntie had twins and bought one crib in which they both slept together til they were older so gives you more time to save for another crib.<br>  stock up on nappies and creams etc. boxes work out cheaper and better value than the packets. <br>  you get great deals on clothes etc like packs of 6 onesies<<these types of things will prob be better bought in neutral colours which will be least expensive as all babes can use them and outfits you can buy individually. and lastly congrats|`|mjz8JF9Gaa	target and wal mart are cheaper <br>  babies r us is more expensive <br>  but generally have the same stuff<br>  <br>  you will need every thing times 4 <br>  <br>  cribs x4 <br>  blankets x4 <br>  clothes x4 <br>  binkys x4 <br>  bottle propper x4 <br>  baby wash x4 <br>  swings x4 <br>  diapers and wipes x4|`|x7vTKP24aa	shop at target. you will need everything x 4

And nicknames such as Mia or Ammie or even Leah.|`|yxtMLgN8aa	Amelia for sure. That's what I FINALLY decided to name my baby, BUT we just found out we are having a boy and now we have to start all over with names (emilio sounds terrible so I can't use that). <br>  Amelia Marie is what I chose. One day I'll get to use it.|`|CbKOO4HFaa	Both are quite pretty, but I think you need to think about what nicknames you prefer because it is likely that people will call your child by that nickname.  So do you like Amy or Vickie better?  :)|`|QJbXTdCjaa	I like Amelia better.<br>  My sister is naming<br>  her daughter Amelia<br>  and is planning on <br>  calling her Milly.

But I named her Mattix instead!|`|MKC3CnqHaa	Amelia, for certain.  <br>  <br>  I'm not a big fan of the old Queen Vic, so I guess that's why I don't like that name.|`|KAj7GfeDaa	Amelia- that name will win! lol|`|AA11210211	I like them both but prefer Victoria but I am partial to that name because my name is Victoria:)|`|bIaywrBCaa	I love them both. Both go well with middle name Rose. If I have to choose I say Victoria, classic, beautiful
aOJ89sauaa	I think it's a very pretty, sophisticated name. Starr is the surname of her partner and I think Scarlet preceeds it perfectly.|`|3c999cc5b0b1a321de8a3f065f0fab47aa	I think it's pretty, and it goes well with the last name, which is Starr, that's not a second name. Its the babys surname, her dads name|`|cvjPQ9tTaa	I like the name Scarlett but It just sounds a bit wierd with the surname Starr, its almost a cartoon characters name. But I still like it! : )|`|O2oqcpXIaa	Well i like the name Scarlett but as some said earlier joining it to star makes it a bit of a tongue twister.  But hey each to their own!|`|ZMnD5s7laa	i like it personally- but it shouldn't matter what other people think its her child!

Not keen on the Starr part but the whole name goes together quite well.|`|2716717868fe21f32f85869cd02f81d8aa	I really don't like it. Another celebrity that has given their child a silly name|`|Hn3aBIb1aa	Yes starr is the surname :) and i think its lovely|`|OI3bf4yjaa	I don't like it.. it reminds me of a name for a powerpuff girl for some reason.|`|8OoqHpbIaa	i like Scarlett<br>  <br>  its just that any name would sound a bit silly with the surname starr|`|b6e25abd37c3e9a3b82b14fba72575e0aa	starr is her surname if you actually look the dads surname is starr and as long as they like her name no one elses opinion matter|`|DHW8x1d8aa	I love Scarlett but I don't think it goes well with the last name Starr it makes it a bit cheesy. At least she didn't call her baby Apple though and picked a classic, more normal name|`|kCrfK8IUaa	It's okay. Not the worst celebrity baby name, I'll give her that.<br>  <br>  Starr is going a tad far though.|`|2EklweZEaa	Typical Celeb Baby name.<br>  <br>  x|`|OXxKTM6vaa	I love it, so unique with Starr as well.

VGij9p0Taa	Pretty. <br>  Daylyn is very unusual and I have never heard of the name. It would be lovely if the child is born during the day due to the start of the name. Jane meaning god's gift of grace provides a good mix of old and new. However like I think I have stated before I prefer the first girl name you suggested Amelia Jane. This name is ultra classy with great meaning's Amelia meaning noble kind and Jane meaning god's gift of grace. Amelia Jane I think is the better name out of the two, but Dayln Jane is pretty just not classy I feel.|`|Kx0XoZpmaa	Daylyn is really pretty & unique. Jane is cute, too. It's more common so it creates a nice balance with Daylyn.<br>  <br>  (:|`|HWeajklaaa	SO it's pronounced Day-lyn?

I believe that your name has a lot to do with how you will turn out.  Jonathon Charles is a successsful name like King Charles or sir Jonathon Charles.

Everett is so masculine and an "e" doesn't make it much more feminine in my opinion.|`|8ldMwflKaa	That's so cute! And no one will ever have the same name as her. Perfect!
T0fwqL2baa	No the baby will not be an addict. However, the baby will go through withdrawal. If the mother used during pregnancy...say heroin...when the baby is born he/she will experience the withdrawals and could also have serious consequences to organ limb development...jaundice...etc.|`|ZZzQLjaKaa	The problem with your question is that it is too general to answer with any deal of authority. There are many different drugs out there and the effects will be different. Most longitudinal studies of how drug addiction affects a fetus is narrowed to a specific drug of choice, such as heroin or meth. <br>  <br>  <a href="http://pediatrics.aappublications.org/cgi/content/abstract/48/2/178" rel="nofollow">http://pediatrics.aappublications.org/cg...</a><br>  <a href="http://www.pubmedcentral.nih.gov/articlerender.fcgi?artid=1807933" rel="nofollow">http://www.pubmedcentral.nih.gov/article...</a>|`|jBnQiZVFaa	Sort of. It is more complicated than what you are thinking.  An addicted baby is not an addict.  They were not choosing to use drugs and do not have a memory of using (no drive to have deal with). However, their brain holds the memory of being an addict so if there were to pick up the drug, or any drug, later in life, they will have about a six times greater likelihood of becoming an addict.  Their body will respond different to the drug than someone who had never been addicted (even at birth).  Drug addiction is genetic anyway, but it makes it way more likely if the child was actually addicted at birth.  It would not be a relapse though.

ELSKfMpxaa	My dad used to use military work out's on us when we misbehaved & we'd get literally 10x the punishment if we lied. The one I hated the most was the "bull dog" which was basically you get on the floor like your going to do a push up but you don't move, you just hold it. Or standing with your feet together in the middle of the floor and your arms straight out and a book in either palm. If you dropped the book then the time started over. During punishment he'd ask randomly "what did you do wrong" or "why are you being punished" It got to a point where we'd nark ourselves out rather than lying or being caught. Punnishment was much less that way. I doubt that would be considered abuse. It's actually good for you, builds strong muscles :P|`|UADLdXBtaa	Check with his doctor, he may have ADD. It might also be a good idea to talk to him and ask him why he does certain things. Maybe he's not paying attention because he doesn't understand the course work. The school might be able to move him into a class with less difficulty. It could also just be his age and he will need to grow out of it on his own. I'm assuming he's in either kindergarten or first grade. This is coming off of not being expected to do anything all day long to now having to sit for long periods of time and absorb unusual amounts of information. It could take a while (and I mean years) to adjust. Make a list of things that are expected of him during the time he is in school and then make a chart. Ask the teacher if you might be able to get weekly progress reports about how he was, on a scale of 5 (one for each day of the week). If he gets a 2 out of 5 this week, put two stickers on the chart. 3/5 then three stickers, etc. Once he makes his way to a certain amount of stickers, say 20 (since that would be an entire month without incident) tell him if he gets however many you specified that you will take him to his favorite restaurant like pizza hut or chucky cheeze or something. You  just have to make sure you don't go there any other time, and if you have to, leave him with a babysitter and tell him he hasn't earned it yet. It has to be special or he won't be motivated.|`|3GHXk05saa	What changed? I'm guessing he wasn't always like this so if you've taken his toys, grounded him and paddled him, he seems either bound and determined to be disobedient or he just can't help himself.<br>  I think you've done about all the punishing you can, I think it's time to find out why he's misbehaving so much. Most kids want to be good and they rarely act out to this degree without a reason.<br>  Did something change in the classroom, is there a new teacher, or kid, did a friend move, is there a bully? Does he still behave well at home (when you're not talking about school)? If so, then something is going on at school. If he's misbehaving at home, look to other reasons.<br>  How is he sleeping and eating, does he have headaches?<br>  You seem like a good mom so I doubt he's acting out because of anything you're doing but I would take him to his pediatrician for an evaluation. You'd feel awful punishing the poor kid if this is truly beyond his control.<br>  As for the lying, kids that age really don't understand how it's wrong. They may know to repeat what you've told them (yes, Mommy, I know it's wrong to lie), but a six year old may not have acquired the ability to really understand it yet. They know it may help them get out of one kind of trouble, so it's a solution to a problem. He's old enough not to believe a lie he tells like a toddler would, but to really appreciate deception takes another couple of years.|`|ZQS2Q6cXaa	search for a psychological answer. it might be there.|`|1UOnrM1Maa	Okay. You may be a bit offended by my answer, but I hope you can see where I'm coming from, and take it for what it's worth.<br>  <br>  Your son has been taught to act a certain way. Either you raised him to be like this, his father, another relative, or someone else, raised him to be like this. It could have even been his friends.<br>  <br>  There is not much you can do. The common human will not change their lifestyle based on the answer of someone on Yahoo Answers. But it is just that.<br>  <br>  You'd have to describe your home and living status for me to get an understanding of why your child is behaving this way. I grew up in a very poor neighborhood, I had a lot of bad friends, but I graduated high school with a 4.2 GPA. This is because my mother sat me down everyday and taught me proper ethics, how to behave, etc. My father, when I visited him, would make me read books that I often learned from. <br>  <br>  Like I said, I can not properly answer your question just yet. But the problem is not your child, it's his environment.

Well, all I can say is that you have to own up to what you did and tell your mother what happened and be grown up about it. Sit down with her and plan out what you are going to do with yourself and the baby until you turn 18. I'm sure you are scared, and you should be. Abstinence is the only true form of protection. But, enough of the preaching.<br>  You will feel sick for the entire time that you are pregnant. That is called "morning sickness". A good book to purchase is "What to Expect the First Year". It will give you an idea of what's to come.<br>  Maybe you won't have sex now until you get married. By the way, you should consider marrying the father of your baby.|`|yas23v7laa	alright, does your mother love you, does she trust you, if she loves you then when you tell her she will only be mad for like 2 weeks, if she trust you, well that will be gone for like 2 weeks also, you just have to sit her down, say mom i have something i have to tell you, the just tell her you and your boyfriend have been haveing sex and something has happened that you dont know how to handel with out her, tell her that you are going to need her help through everything, and make sure you throw in how much you love her, when you finally tell her that you are pregnant she will go through the whole " are you sure" once you tell her about the tests ask her to take you to a gyno so you can be super sure. whatever you do if she wants you to get an abortion say **** you mom, and pack your **** and move in with your boyfriend. everyting will be fine, its going to be really really hard but you have to do it.|`|0998cb727a21ddeb5105fa6704b79faaaa	i know the feeling! im 14 but before you freak out go to a confindential teen health clinic and get the test there.

Good luck.|`|8nL4bKieaa	My 18 month is doing the same, and was starting to do the same at bedtime, then crying every time we went upstairs when he was a tiny bit tired. He's also not needing a nap every day now, so i hope it's just a transition phase! I figured the best thing was not to have a battle so for two weeks didn't try putting him down, and instead let him drop off by taking him for a drive/put him in the pushchair/let him go to sleep in the highchair. then after two weeks started back on putting him in his cot. Can't say he's happy about going for his nap, but he isn't screaming like before and we can now walk upstairs without him creating chaos.|`|tRNwh2yxaa	My daughter went through that phase, but I figured out I was checking on her too much.  If you can leave the door cracked so you can peek at her, but she can't see you, then just let her cry and don't go back in there.  If you keep going in and out then eventually pick her up, she may be figuring out that if she screams long and loud enough, you will give in.  This is absolute torture, and it makes you want to throw up some days especially being 6 months pregnant ( i know because my daughter did it right after Christmas when I was 6 months.) But, if you can just try to break her of this habit, you should have a much easier time.  Just make sure nothing is wrong by peeking at her, but don't go in and fuss over her and pick her up.  Try this, and good luck!

But I have heard that if they're going to stay blue, or light, they will be that color at 4 months.  I've also heard that if they're still blue by age 2, then they'll be blue for sure.

SauyxU3Eaa	Start talking to the one you know best.  If you find out why they broke up in the first place then you could go to the other become good friends.  Then you could ask them if they would ever go out with the other again.  If they say yes you could tell them both how each of them feels.  sorta a long term process but it will be worth it.|`|bebee00e4f3a4e5d156594de8d4a527eaa	I wouldn't.

She may be upset now but you don't know...he may have cheated on her, beat her or something worse. The only people that should 'set-up' two people that were once in a relationship before are those two people.<br>  If she just broke up with someone else I would say just wait a little bit. Most likely she's not going to want to even look at other guys for awhile. She'll know when she's ready, but until then provide some icecream (or wine if you both are of age...but you sound really young so icecream) a chick flick and a listening ear.|`|pcjOQDymaa	well i wouldnt do it because obviously they broke up for a reason.

tle3AGJraa	take your time.  i worked with an autistic child who didn't potty train until she was around 8 years old.  she was such a wonderful girl and i loved her so much....she was mighty proud of herself when she was finally potty trained too.|`|amLzTNeVaa	First of all, you need to completely get rid of the diapers. Your child will never understand what you are trying to do if you keep him or her in the comfortable environment of the diaper. At the most, only keep them for a short time at the beginning to use for overnight or long outdoor trips. At first, this may be upsetting to the child and they may attempt to put the diapers back on his or herself (which is a sign he/she is definitely capable of being potty-trained). Consider using absorbent Pull-ups??? for a short while to accustom the child to the feel of underwear. But do not use the Pull-ups??? for so long that the girl or boy becomes overly-attached to them as they did the diapers.<br>  <br>  Next, you need to buy your child several pairs of regular cloth underwear or cloth training underwear and some pairs of plastic underwear covers (similar to cloth diaper covers-to reduce mess from 'accidents', which will be inevitable in this process. Buy some disinfectant and a good bottle of carpet spot cleaner!). Put the underwear and underwear cover on your child while just spending time around the house. Once again, they may be upset with the change, but will eventually get used to it and be thankful for your 'push'. At this stage, you may also want to let them view a parent of sibling of the same sex using the bathroom normally, so they can visually see the process.<br>  <br>  Do not rely on regular Pull-ups??? to help train your child. The newer potty-training disposables that contain strips that 'alert' or help the child feel the mess may be more acceptable and cleaner, but an autistic child needs to be able to feel the wetness in order to be encouraged to use the toilet and avoid the discomfort. That is why cloth underwear or Feel 'N Learn??? disposables are so important to use, and why regular Pull-ups??? and diapers will only hinder the process (except in cases where a bathroom is not going to be available to the child at this stage). If possible, attempt to teach your child a signal to give you or a word to use when the bathroom is needed. In any case, make sure the bathroom is not locked off and is always available for the child to use whether they alert you or not. It may be helpful to leave a hallway light on all night, so the child isn't afraid to get up and use the bathroom at night. When your child gives you the signal for the need to use the bathroom, if you can see they are in the middle of going to the bathroom in their underwear, or even if you discover they've already had an accident-immediately take them to the toilet and sit them down. Even if the child has already gone to the bathroom all the way, sitting them down and helping them wipe will associate the deed with the toilet. Even when the child does not give you the signal to go, it will be helpful to sit him or her on the potty for a moment and going through the motions of wiping before leaving the house/going to bed, or just random times during the day-preferably repeating phrases such as "Poopy in the potty" or "Pee-pee in the potty." In regards to wiping, keeping a supply of flushable wet wipes will help them become more independent. As for the type of toilet, by the time many autistic children are potty-trained they are too big to use a potty chair or seat, so the regular toilet should do just fine.<br>  <br>  It may take several accidents and trips to sit on the toilet, but eventually your child will discover that in order to avoid the discomfort of having wet underwear, they need to use the potty. They will discover that you are not giving in to their desire to use Pull-ups??? or diapers, and that from now on underwear and the toilet are things that will be a part of their everyday lives. Gradually, they will become more adept at getting to the toilet before they have an accident and will become more independent in the process. Soon, they will be able to completely rid themselves of over-night and travel Pull-ups??? and will be able to hold it until they can get to the bathroom. Make sure your child always knows where the bathroom is located when you visit a new place.<br>  <br>  It is important that all people who give care to this child know what you are doing, are willing to follow the instructions, and know your child's signal for the bathroom. It is also important that you not get angry at the child for having an accident. My family found this out the hard way, when we became irritated at our son for having accidents. He began holding it until he arrived at his special pre-school, where he promptly exploded his bowels almost daily on the teachers (of whom he knew would not punish him), nearly getting him expelled from the school! Patience and praise is definitely recommended over punishment and anger.<br>  <br>  It may seem like a lot of work at first, but potty training your autistic child will make everyone's lives easier in the end and will give them more of an advantage in school. It took my boy a few months or so of daily training and my daughter was traine|`|jgYhKaACaa	it really depends as to where he is on the autistic spectrum as to whether he is ready or not. being verbal would defiantly help and he will need some way of communicating to you that he needs to go.<br>  3 seems to be a little young for boys but don't let your doctor push you into something your not ready to do since its you doing all the work. if your not ready then it wont work.<br>  if he is peeing in his diaper about the same time every day then you can start sitting him on the potty and just counting and that's all. start off with 15 and work your way up to 50 whether they tinkle or not let them up and wash hands. this will eventually become the norm and he will hopefully become ok with this. we don't have any special potty chairs or special potty seats in our classroom they just have to hold themselves up and this system works for us.<br>  but like i said, if your not ready and he isn't responding well then don't do it. but good luck|`|yPLS0FeWaa	You can keep a record of the times he is has wet and soiled himself over a period of a week or two, with any luck you will have a idea of approximate times he goes, such as a pattern of when he is going. Then you can try to have him sit on the potty or toilet around these times to get a more of a set schedule to training him since many on the spectrum like set schedules/routines. If he is in diapers you can switch to pull-ups, they tend to feel more wet to their skin after going so he may not like that and be wanting to use the potty more. Maybe look into a child potty seat that fits inside the regular toliet seat, so he gets use to using the big potty instead of a child's potty, may be less confusing for him.<br>  <br>  Modeling is another way of encouraging children to use the toilet/potty. The idea is for him to see a male figure actually using the toilet, flushing, washing hands and so on.<br>  <br>  You can make a visual using PECS pictures or just simple pictures off the internet. (some links below to PECs and pictures you can use) . We made a chart with 10 steps for our son to follow with pictures for each of them: 1: pull down pants and underwear/diaper/pull-up; 2: go potty (he'll sit on potty); 3: wipe & flush; 4: pull up pants and underwear/diaper/pull-up ; 5: wash hands- 1: wet hands, 2: add soap; 3: scrub; 4: rinse; 5: dry hands.  We praise him everytime he sits on the potty whether he actually uses it or not, we don't give him a reward because we feel that he'll always expect an award even after being trained, so we simply do "great job", "way to go", we use positive reinforcement. <br>  <br>  Any potty training books/videos can be great visuals as well and can be used for modeling purposes too. Any visual or modeling is great since most on the spectrum are visual learners.<br>  When he gets a little further along with training you can place something into the water of a regular toliet such as cheerios can help him learn to aim by trying to hit the target, but yet making it somewhat fun. You can use a step stool for him if the toliet is too tall.<br>  <br>  Look into The Center for Autism and Related Disorders, Inc. (C.A.R.D.)<br>  Offices located in Arizona, Virginia, Illinois, New York, Texas, and several in California including the headquarters. <a href="http://www.centerforautism.com/" rel="nofollow">http://www.centerforautism.com/</a>  I don't if they have anything relating to potty training, but could contact to find out.<br>  If you are in FL, there is Florida's Center for Autism and Related Disabilities - CARD.

Consider switching doctors.<br>  <br>  I have two sons on the autistic spectrum.  Typical kids pottytrain at 2.5-4 years, kids with differences pottytrain usually between 4-7 years.  For your son to pottytrain now would be very early and it doesn't sound like he is ready.<br>  <br>  My kids on the spectrum I waited until they were waking up dry, interested in the potty, and disrobing frequently.  Neither were verbal.  They trained at 3.5yrs, and 32 months.  I sat them on the potty and praised them for sitting.  I sang a little jingle and they sat for 30 seconds.  At first I praised them for going over and touching the potty, then praised them for sitting on the potty clothes on, then sitting on the potty.  Once they sat and were comfortable I put them on for 30 seconds every 2 hours, starting with in the morning when they got up, and then before bed.  I went straight underwear boxer briefs hanes that are completely covered, no elastic waistband.  When they had an accident, I ignored it and cleaned it up.  When they went they got alot of praise.<br>  <br>  Always use the same terminology, we say potty.  My son who is 3.5 can say potty now (he trained at 32 months), but he will hold himself and then I say potty, and he runs to the door.  We use a potty insert into the regular potty.<br>  <br>  We got Gerber training pants in a 4T from Arctic Originals and tyedyed all of them.  Then we went to Hanes boxer briefs size 6-8|`|1469145fbc54553729532a83a0ba1985aa	1) Get him to communicate with you when he has gone to the bathroom in his diaper. Try humming or the like. SOMETHING that will let him tell you when he went.<br>  <br>  2) Always reinforce his communication. A hug. Anything.<br>  <br>  3) Give him salty foods and plenty of juice/water when you're ready to try. <br>  <br>  4) At first, get him to sit on a potty (of his choice, if possible) while he goes to the bathroom in his diaper. Flush the toilet together.<br>  <br>  5) Keep doing this and eventually assist him in removing his diaper. Some kids do better at this than others. <br>  <br>  6) To conquer #2, make sure he has plenty of fiber. Autistic children tend to have harder stools, and any help he can get will help. <br>  <br>  7) Keep at it. Keep on the schedule and keep trying. It's going to be frustrating, but keep with the positive reinforcement. Sometimes it's good to award yourself when he reaches accomplishments too, so that you don't completely lose it.

If they don't see any problems with it (helping him walk, use the restroom, giving him medication, whatever it may entail), then I think sending him back would be ok.  You might want to try short days at first for a couple days to make sure it's working out.

rqJSk1omaa	Oh definitely tell him the truth always. My best friend growing up was adopted and she knew from a very young age. He will want to know where he came from and the story of how he came into his mom's life. He will only resent secrets being kept from him. <br>  <br>  I remember my friend getting offend because some other child said something like "your family isn't really related to you." But her family was related to her. Family is more that genetics. She even resembled her family a whole lot and they were very influential in her life. <br>  <br>  He will love your mom for being his mom and loving him. Your mom is the person who raises and takes care of you. He will lover her as much as she loves him. Don't lie to him, tell him where he came from and that he came to live with your family for a very important reason.|`|0SIhrYCbaa	You should always make it known and never a secret. That way there is no reason to be upset later. You acknowledge him as being the special baby you got to pick for your self. That's what my family has always done. Your mom is his real mom and if she feels that way he may too. She is the only mom he has and he will love her unconditionally. I have non biological kids that I love with the same fervor as my bio ones. Does she love him less because she adopted him? Of course not. <br>  Being picked is a very special thing and one that should make you feel loved.|`|KPac9A2qaa	No but tell him young, or else he'll figure out because no 8 year old I know has a 53 year old mom xD|`|KSUPtqCaaa	It should never be kept as a secret, but you shouldn't bring it up with him until he is at least school-aged. Even then, don't make it quite a big deal; but when he is somewhere between 10 and 12 (depending on his maturity level), the family should sit down and explain everything to him.<br>  <br>  The love you give to him as a child will be what he gives you back. Being adopted doesn't make him less family, nor does it make you any less his brother, or your mother any less his mother too. She will be his 'real' mom. One isn't a 'mom' or 'mommy' because of giving birth, this only makes one a mother. One becomes a 'mom' by raising and loving a child.<br>  <br>  Cheers!|`|TK03jZTuaa	You need to start telling the toddler now that he is special because he is adopted. He won't undrstand it now but he will always know. Then later on in life he will develop an understanding of the situation. Do not hide it from him.
ATeLkwGUaa	you deserved a punishment, not because you were playing w/ mathces because you said you werent but you also said you told them to open the window so your moms would not smell the matches which was wrong. You should have told them to stop and informed your mother. You little sister should be able to feel like you want her to be safe more than you dont want to be a "tattle tale". You seem so certain that "no one would get hurt" but there is no way to know that, what if one of them burned their finger and accidentally dropped a lit match into a can of something, or on the floor where something had leaked and you didnt realize anything was even ON the floor? There is no way to be safe when playing with matches which is why you got in trouble as well. and by the way, 5 min was PLENTY of time for you to stop them or to notify your parents.|`|G2auAv1Saa	12 and 10 year old should have enough wit to not play with matches.

I believe what you did still was wrong, even though you weren't doing anything, just being there is wrong. You don't need to be a dobber, you can just say to your friends that you're going to play outside and play some other game. You can choose to not join in, and not be a dobber, and this won't get your into any trouble with your friends or your parents. I think it's a valuable life lesson for the future though, you will get into trouble if you stand by whilst someone is doing something wrong. Just walk away and do something else, however, if it's really, really wrong and someone is getting hurt - I'm sorry, but you really do have to tell...|`|c9NuCZnaaa	I dont believe in spanking as a punishment at all. I think it was wrong for your mother to do that. <br>  However in future do go and let someone know if something like that is happening as there could've been a fire. Just ask the adult to not say you did it and go over like they're just popping around and catching them.|`|5Nxb8aqRaa	no i don't think you should of got a spanking but a very very serrious talk because what would've happened if there was a jerry can full of gas and a spark got the fumes you would've been hurting alot more than a little spanking but matches are very dangerous if you don't know how to use them. Matches aren't toys there are not to be messed with they can ******* burn an entire building down|`|tBtOTiQDaa	i agree with your mom<br>  you aided a conspiricay, thats illeagal<br>  how would you like it if there was a fire, and it burned down half the town<br>  you, had the power to stop it, but you didn't|`|1enIWBGnaa	I would do exactly the same!!!<br>  You were there, you didn't do anything to stop it - you're just as guilty!|`|6kBAj12gaa	matches are not a toy and the fact that you gave them the idea to open the window so the moms wouldnt find out is you and your friends trying to get away with it. However your story contradicted itself a little in the beginning you said you didnt know they were till your mom walked in and in your additional details you said you were there about 5 minutes and told them to open a windo so no one would smell them. You tried to hide what you were doing.....so the punishment was deserved.<br>  <br>  sorry...i hated spankings as a kid too and in front of your friends....couldnt imagine...but I think id rather have a sore bottom than a burnt down house..|`|CrZxYK5raa	trust me no matter if you did it or not parents are going to do what other parents do in front of them. the other kids got spanked you get spanked. they get time out you get time out. they were playing with fire you could of burnt the house down or really hurt yourself. I am 14 and my parents would of spanked me if i was in the place at that time. its done and over with you already got spanked just now its time to face you can't do that anymore and time to move forward. don't bring it up just face that it happened and you no what not to do next time. sorry about what happened though i no how you feel.|`|ELSKfMpxaa	You deserved the spanking. Not because you did anything wrong or because you didn't tell. But because you weren't able to explain properly to your mom that you hadn't done anything. If you really did "just" walk in, then you would have said so the second the adults came in, the fact that you delayed suggests your guilt. Maybe the spanking will teach you a lesson and you'll be faster to think and to act next time.|`|TZi4ChYYaa	Ok, make your mind up- you say that-i knew it was wrong but before i could even say anything their mom and my mom came in and saw what was happening. Then you say-well......i was there for about 5 minutes or so, but i didn't light any matches. Perhaps this is why you got smacked. Unfortunatly its a parental instinct to hit a child when they are surprised at what they've done. If I was your mum I would of still punsihed you by either<br>  Docking your allowance<br>  Make you write a 4 page essay on why whay you did was wrong<br>  Make your wash the dishes for a week<br>  Take away your computer or laptop or phone!<br>  <br>  XXX Moi :)|`|TK03jZTuaa	If you were present but did nothing to stop them or tell on them then you are actually involved in the crime. Sorry, but it's true. and that's the way the law would deal with you if it were a crime.<br>  <br>  It's calles aiding and abetting (I think). Just walk away when someone does something idiotic next time. tell an adult quickly.|`|NrLcshCmaa	spanked. you should have been whipped with a belt to a cream! you ignorant little brat. <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  lol JK <br>  <br>  no child should ever be spanked, and grounding doesn't teach you anything. what i would have done is had a good talk with you and maybe taken away a privilege such as not letting you go to a birthday party, sleepover etc.|`|bXvVWx7jaa	be careful of what you say on the internet. i'm sure your mom was doing what she thought was best for you, and you don't want to get her in serious trouble|`|lVa2zYrlaa	If u were my daughter ...I dont think i would have spanked u. I would have a REAL talk with u ..like "What couldve happen" something like that. If u havent done anything like this before, I wouldnt be real hard on u. I hope u learned though cuz something could have happen real bad!|`|sa9ieSMlaa	o my gosh that is so un fair,that lady has no right to hurt you cause u r not her child .it may be child aduse hurting outhr peoples kids|`|J1taQ7R4aa	I don't think you should have been spanked, because I don't believe in spanking.  But you should have left immediately when you saw what your friends were doing - what if they'd burned down their house?  I had a friend who burned her house down when she was 8 years old.  They are very poor, and they still haven't finished rebuilding it, thirteen years later.  What if that had happened to your friends?  And they were in the garage.  What if they'd set themselves on fire or blown themselves up?<br>  <br>  I think you got punished partly because you scared the crap out of your mom.  And partly because you were a party to what your friends were doing.<br>  <br>  I think you deserve to be punished, or at least not allowed to play with those friends of yours for awhile.
oOMzcKITaa	well just give him some time and see if he still wantss you <br>  aroundd,,|`|AA11296427	Well, your boyfriend is hurting a lot right now.

cnssh7v3aa	Hey gurl, <br>  Congrats on your long relationship, that's amazing! <br>  good for you trying to be reasonable and use protection! That's extremely smart of you :) Condoms are not a 100% though, so maybe the way to bring the situation up to your mother is birth control. Tell her how you feel about your guy, and tell her that you want to be ready if and when something happens beetween the two of you.  <br>  But as a mommy to be myself i have to tell you one thing, <br>  sex does lead to babys, no matter how careful you are sometimes things just happen. <br>  I was engaged to my guy 6 months before we found out we were expecting our first, now im 17 and married. <br>  Trust me i understand you love him, i really do, i was with now husband since early in my 15. <br>  But sex is a huge responsibility, just make sure your both ready for it! Sex does change alot!! It really does, sometimes its the most amazing ways, and sometimes not, Be ready for both. <br>  But really sit down and think what if i had a baby, thats what my husband and i did before we started having sex, so when i found out i was pregnant, it wasnt a hug surprise. <br>  Communication with your mother and boyfriend is key. Dont forget that and you cant go wrong! <br>  <br>  Bring on the thumbs down lol|`|PJ0aI0Dtaa	im 14. and i wouldnt be ready for sex.<br>  not now, even if i was truly in love.<br>  which i thought i was, but it didnt ended up well.<br>  i think you guys should wait, maybe 2-3 months.<br>  good luck.<br>  and you should tell your mom,<br>  if she lets you have oral, and you want to get on birth control.<br>  then she'll think your responsible<br>  but just wait a little.<br>  <br>  good luck! andd hope that you and your bf lastsss for a long time!|`|e7aeb2cff39c63298f29417537101f03aa	Why would your mom care or his mom care if y'all have sex. She already lets y'all play house. She lets y'all have oral. An whats worse your only 14. You say your mature for your age but i am sorry someone mature would not be risking sex at that age. <br>  <br>  You only want nice answers with us saying yes go ahead an have sex i am sorry not many people r going to be cool with someone at 14 doing it.|`|GuVNYGqyaa	well if ur relationship with ur mom is really close and she ok wit u having oral sex then i would go ahed and tell her that ur ready to go ahead and hav the real thing but before you do it these are the 2 things i would recommend condoms and birthcontrol<br>  hope my opinion helped:]|`|Q05rrSX4aa	At first I was going to answer seriously, and nicely.  But then when I got to the bottom where it says you are 14!!  I decided not too.  So sorry, I can't answer your question....|`|TXmAx8jwaa	You should just tell her and get it out the way, otherwise she might feel upset when she does find out that you have hided it from her for so long.|`|3w7VztEWaa	Your way too young.<br>  it doesn't matter how mature you are.<br>  wait until you've known him longer. <br>  please .|`|BUOJJpaCaa	Maybe approach her with the subject about having sex before you do so. Your mom seems like a very understanding person. Obviously, she trusts you enough to leave you alone and let you sleep together at night. She should assume sexual intercourse will eventually happen.<br>  <br>  If she flips out, just say "Thank you and I respect your opinion. I won't do it"<br>  If she doesn't flip out and is supportive of your decision, kudos for you.<br>  <br>  She knows you guys are exploring each other, so you should talk to her about birth control other than condoms at that time too.|`|1B91qtNQaa	Go ahead and report me if you must but I just wanted to tell you that you should not post questions if you don't want the full range of opinions. Including those who don't agree with a 14 year old no matter how mature having sex. <br>  <br>  Just so you know being a mother myself that your mother will find out. Maybe not immediately but she will and then your trust with her will be broken.|`|vXlw9Vm5aa	i no you said you would report this but o well...your are to young to be having sex and i don't care what you say your mom is an ignorant bad parent if she allows her 14 year old daughter to do this! But whatever... you say you have such an open relationship just tell her and you say they let you do whatever you want so the freedom won't go away!!! Later mama-to-be!!!|`|rwrDD14Jaa	You seem a bit too young to lose your virginity. I would wait a couple of years if I were you. Have you discussed sex with your mother before? Ask her about her opinion on you losing your virginity now and see what she says.|`|3Pmq0rUMaa	you should ask her what she thinks about you having sex..before you do it. so that if she doesn't agree so okay. thanks..ill wait..so you don't lose her trust.<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  but im 14 too..and im not ready.|`|F1DXUByNaa	I wouldn't risk telling her, if it was me.|`|UtiTJddfaa	just tell her|`|I8nRT6Kdaa	Hear me out before you think I'm judging you. This is coming from someone who became a mother at 17. If I were your mother, I'd hope you'd wait until your older, when you become a parent you'll understand. (I know, I hated it when people said that to me too but it's so true!)<br>  <br>  However, if she's leaving you and him alone like she is, she must have a profound level a trust in you to do the right thing. I'm sure no one can talk you out of your decision to have sex so I'll say this: tell your mom. It doesn't have to be right away, let it sink in and think on how and when you'll bring it up. Approach in a way of maturity and ask her to respect that you think you were ready. If she limits your alone time together, would you blame her?<br>  <br>  Or you can do it old fashion. Ask her as a "what if."<br>  "Mom, let's say me and bobby were thinking of having sex, would that change any alone time you allow us to have together or will you still trust us?"<br>  <br>  Good luck, dear. :)|`|oyINZiNDaa	i still think you should wait..condoms don always work **** happens as they say...but i was afraid that my mom wouldn love me anymore if i had sex with my boyfriend we were together 2 1/2 yrs before we had sex an he was my first an here it is 4 yrs later still togehter but i kinda just asked my mom if that happened would she not love me anymore an she said that she would always love me to make the best decsion and that she couldn be with my all the time so i ended up havin sex with him. and i didn tell her right away it was probably 2 months after the fact that i told her..and she wasnt mad an she lets me stay the night with him and they let us up in my room they just say they don want it done around them cos thats disrespectful..so they let us up in my room don bother us.....so yea hope i've helped|`|xoveRPysaa	Well, I'm 15 and my boyfriend and I have been together a year.<br>  & we are definatly in love with each other.<br>  We lost our virginities to each other. <br>  *I dont have a good relationship with my mom, because she treats me like a child, I wish i had to freedom that you have, i'd give anything, he lives about 30 minutes away from me, but there is no way in hell i would ever tell my mom that we had sex.<br>  you on the other hand, if she didnt get mad about the "oral sex" i dont see why she'd get mad about the actual sex.|`|EPaYoJaiaa	I'm not judging you or anything this is just my personal opinion but...<br>  <br>  If you're afraid of 'being caught' or telling your parents or anything like that then it's either wrong or you're too young. In this case you are too young.<br>  You say you have an excellent relationship with your mother and she knows about you doing other sexual things, yet afraid to tell her that you want to go all the way with your boyfriend. You are not ready and because you are not ready you shouldn't do it.<br>  Ask around, I have never heard of anyone that waited till they were older to have sex regretting it...but most that did NOT wait do regret it.<br>  If it was me I would wait.|`|jPlUycx0aa	just dont have sex. your only 15. wait until marriage.|`|xPR7g0wFaa	Whats wrong with kids today?????????? Oh, its the parents knowing and allowing them to have oral sex and sleep overs with the opposite sex. No, your not running around being a whore your just doing it at your parents home.Having sex at 14 is not being mature and making good decisions.|`|iTFZr9dGaa	umm... your on a Higher Level then me.|`|NFeKUgWCaa	Tell your mom that you want to start birth control, and then when she asks why, say ' well, i feel very comfortable with ___ and if we do have sex, I want us to be very safe about it.  So I'd like to start birth control, in case the time comes soon "  or something along those lines.<br>  I'm 15, turning 16 in 2 weeks.. and the way I told my mom was I just asked to go back on birth control, and she was in the doctors with me, and she told the doctor she knows we have sex, so she wants me to be protected.  I didn't know she even knew.  Lol. <br>  Your mom is smarter then you think.  And she'll hopefully be understanding.<br>  good luck :)|`|k9VvIG3gaa	I thought the same as you...Im ready for sex (and i was with the guy for almost TWO YEARS before even thinking of doing ANYTHING sexual), But i wasn't ready for what can happen in result of sex...<br>  <br>  Are you ready for a child?<br>  Honestly answer that question..!<br>  <br>  Condoms dont work 100% of the time, <br>  <br>  I used a condom my first time, and guess what, now im called MOM!<br>  <br>  Just dont have sex till you can answer "Are you ready for a child"? with a yes..
X1NVjZEKaa	Maybe you should just talk to your mom first and ask her what she thinks you should do (sex or not sex). If she approves then great. If she doesnt and you are still very sure you are ready for sex then do it and just dont tell her. Most kids dont tell their parents about that stuff anyways.|`|2osuEr0naa	Why should anyone judge you?  If anything you're being smart about the sex situation. I think that you should tell your mom. Tell her you're ready, and your being safe. :] She will trust you so much more. Your mom has to know you guys fool around lol. Just be honest with her. You got a good head on your shoulders. Good luck! :]|`|oOMzcKITaa	well my mom would knoww but only tell me to use<br>  protectionn,, cause of course i would do it wether she approved<br>  or not, so she would just tell me to take care of myself,|`|AA11348344	Talk to your parents , tell them that you think you are ready for sex.|`|NgeZASTYaa	OK - IF you think you are old enough to have sex, you should think you are old enough to get married - then you can have all the sex you want.<br>  <br>  BUT, since you ARE in doubt about telling your mom, you are NOT as mature as you think you are.<br>  <br>  Either wait or get married - don't sneak around - mature people don't sneak around.<br>  <br>  regards|`|mSzwilutaa	Dont tell your mum|`|ELSKfMpxaa	I think it's great you have that relationship with your mom.<br>  Talk to her about it. Tell her you think you're ready for the next step. Ask her to help you get on birth control. If you're on the pill and using a condom, if she's ok with oral she should be ok with the whole thing. Any intelligent parent would be proud that you came to them first. If you do it without her blessing then she'll never trust you. If she says you're too young or it's too soon don't get upset and argue. Just accept it and be happy with what you have. If you get upset then she'll lose some of her trust in you|`|jPlUycx0aa	Report me if you want but, you are to young to be having sex.  Dont be another teenager who thought they were ready and ended up pregnant or even an STD.  Even though they had sex with a guy they thought loved them. You need to be focusing on your own life and goals and not some boy that you been dating for 9 months.  Im not trying to judge you but, i think you just becoming another stupid teenage statistic.  Just dont have sex no matter how much you care about him. You dont want to end up like me with a baby at 15 because i gave my virginity away to a boy I was dating for 2 years. Its just not the way to go.|`|c4d179c54efba1c73a993ab6f248346aaa	you can understand if you mother might not be happy with what you have done, right..?<br>  <br>  if you feel close enough to tell her, then tell her..

Good Luck|`|3HR1SfGMaa	There is also enfamil and similac.  And Sams club has a pretty good generic version of enfamil, the only difference was the fillers, the essential nutrients were all the same if price is an issue.

ytE1q20taa	When women can't get pregnant they have one of their eggs taken and injected with one of their partner's (or a donor's) sperm and then put in to their uterus, sort of manually getting pregnant. I've heard it cost a lot though.|`|WWcaKZ7Qaa	It stands for In vitro fertilization. It's where they fertilize an egg outside of the body and then put it into the uterus. Many people try this after having fertility problems for a long time. Here's a link so you can read all about it: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IVF" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IVF</a>
xcxMB4Rlaa	Don't stress yourself out over the specific day you got pregnant.  And don't stress over the due date either.  It's just an estimate; baby will come when she's ready.  <br>  <br>  That being said, my lmp before I got pregnant was April 21, 2007.  My due date was April 21, 2008. Huh????  I got pregnant at the beginning of July but because my cycle was so irregular they couldn't use it to determine my date of conception.  My doctor actually said according to my lmp I was already 18 weeks pregnant when I walked into the office in August to confirm my pregnancy.  I laughed at her.  When she did the internal exam she changed it to 6-8 weeks.  Then when I had my first ultrasound two weeks later they said I was 8 weeks and they determined the due date.  <br>  <br>  Congrats and good luck!|`|tRNwh2yxaa	Just go with the date for the ultrasound because it sounds like your cycle got very screwy and confusing.  Honestly, if you have the later due date, you could still go early, its not hurting anything to plan to be pregnant through June 15th.  Even if you thought your due date was the 4th, the doctors wouldn't induce you based on your opinion, so you might has well go with what they say.  Due dates are an estimate anyway.|`|DVJoW71saa	they measure the baby in an u/s. GO WITH THAT DATE.|`|5HY1AslWaa	On mine there was a week gap in between my LMP and the ultrasound and going by how much she weighed at birth the ultrasound was right. They can tell on ultrasound give or take a week but in the first tri it is more accurate at telling the estimated due date. They cannot tell the exact day you got pregnant. Congrats!!!
723QHuicaa	Yes that is fine. Your daughter is an individual - not a recommendation on a formula can. If she is hungry - feed her. Simple!<br>  <br>  Well done for breast feeding, dont beat yourself up for formula feeding now - if its what is best for now, then its what is best!<br>  <br>  *** Edit to the giving juice people - 1) juice is not recommended, high in sugar and unnecessary at this age. 2) if she is hungry she needs calories, not flavoured water.<br>  <br>  If your really want to cut out some of her bottles, you could replace on with a snack of fruit.|`|pXSKSS3daa	You're fine.<br>  <br>  Noah was having five bottles/day at that time and each were around 6 oz. He was also JUST starting one solid feed/day.<br>  <br>  I wouldn't worry about it. Her height and weight seem "in tune" with each other and unless her doctor is worried about her growth then I'd look over what the can says. No biggie.|`|xOr67VDiaa	The main thing to worry about is, if she can hold it all down well. if so then its fine, but you have to also remember formula makes children alot more fatty then food or breast milk, so if you find her putting on more weight its because of the formula. As long as she holds it all down well there isnt anything really to worry about. Babies tell mums what they need, thats how we know, also at this stage she is using more energy so she will need more. i think everything is fine and i think youre doing a great job, alot of mothers wont give them the extra and its not good because of the about of energy they use at that age. good luck and dont stress!|`|lGcpXteaaa	Oh hun...well done for breastfeeding that long! Mine stopped at 6 months too...for reason that are way too detailed and long to explain to everybody. No worries!<br>  <br>  Well let me just say...i seriously hate the 'recommendations' and 'statistics' I swear to god, most of them are a load of bull!! <br>  My daughter is 10 months and still has 6 bottles a day. She has 2 small meals a day also. I don't care as long as she is happy and healthy..and she is!<br>  She is not a big eater and she would rather have a bottle over food any day! <br>  My ped said that formula is really the only form of nutrition they need and that solids are just a learning process at this stage.<br>  I only give juice really with her supper and snacks. Just because she enjoys the juice.<br>  <br>  My daughter still has this many bottles (6 6oz bottles) and is 50th percentile for height and weight and is 10 months....|`|qayCggxMaa	Every kid is different.  Especially being in the upper percentiles, she may just need more than other kids.  Plus, it's not really the number of bottles per day, but the number of ounces they eat.  My kids always both preferred more feedings per day but would only take 3-4 ounces per feeding, while I knew other kids who would take a 6 or 8 ounce bottle and only need a couple bottles per day.  As long as her growth is on track, don't worry about it.  They'll eat what they need at this age.|`|fe6fcbf713d0ed0538de9c9304001a52aa	How much is in each bottle?<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.drgreene.org/body.cfm?id=21&action=detail&ref=857" rel="nofollow">http://www.drgreene.org/body.cfm?id=21&a...</a><br>  An older baby can have up to 32 ounces of formula per day. In addition, he can have as much in the way of solids, water, or juice as he wants to supplement this. The mealtime formula is usually given at the end of the meals, to top off the solids in a comfortable and easy way. Even though the solids are now playing a larger role, the breast milk or formula still provides the core of the nutritional needs. If a baby begins to regularly take less than about 20 ounces per day, you might want to offer the bottle first and then solids.<br>  <br>  Thirst is an extremely strong drive. As long as a baby’s own regulating mechanism isn’t tricked by getting too much juice or water, healthy babies will take enough formula or breast milk to meet their nutritional needs. This is one good reason not to put juice in the bottle.<br>  <br>  Let your baby set the pace, but if he continues to consistently take more than 32 ounces or less than 20 ounces, run it by your pediatrician.|`|r7q8LW7Aaa	Wow, I know how you feel - my baby has refused to breastfeed since friday and I now have to accept that she's likely a formula fed baby now. I've been very upset, but having a formula fed child already, i know it's not the worst thing in the world.<br>  Anyway, I think the amount she's eating sounds fine. I thought when they start solids, they should still be having approx 5 bottles a day (give or take one or two)? I wouldn't worry about the 'guidelines', my first never followed them either and she's now a perfectly proportioned healthy and happy 3 year old. Mothers intuition is far stronger that anything in a book can tell you, if you feel like she's doing well, keep what you're doing.|`|JXB5pI7Aaa	The tin gives recommendations for the 'average' baby - not all babies eat the same. <br>  <br>  As long as your daughter remains height/weight proportionate, I wouldn't worry about how many bottles she's getting.<br>  <br>  If you're concerned, ask your doctor about moving her to 3 solids a day and eliminating a bottle feed.<br>  <br>  My son is 95th percentile for both height/weight and head circumference.  He's over 13kg and 76some odd cm long, and yes - he eats like a horse.|`|842e6473a8bb1a5aebd67febd13abe6daa	I'm sure she's fine. She's just a very healthy baby who wants her formula! :)<br>  <br>  She knows when she's hungry and when she's not. If she wasn't hungry, then she wouldn't take the bottle/solids. However, when you feed her solids, don't try to encourage her to be a "plate cleaner", just let her eat what she wants. <br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|LbkLg4RFaa	Honestly I wouldn't worry.  Our son was having 5 bottles of 8oz at this age plus 1 solid a day.  Sometimes an extra bottle during the night as well.  He was almost 100% for height and weight.  Not long after he dropped a bottle.  She will only eat when she is hungry.  Don't worry about her weight too much as she's quite tall plus after this age they tend to slow down on the weight gain and even back out.|`|E5CnUdhsaa	if she needs it then its absolutely fine:) she sounds very healthy:)<br>  <br>  congrats on managing to breast feed her til 6 months thats great....just rememebr formula will still give her that nutrition she needs to thrive as a happy healthy tot:) good luck......when she starts to eat more solids ie three a day you may find she will cut out bottles and will continue to do so in the first year!|`|6Zdfx7QOaa	Aw, she is just a growing girl! You should put up new pics on facebook! I want to see this little chunky thing lol. Hallie had some bananas today and loved them.<br>  <br>  As long as her doctor doesn't say there is anything wrong, I'd forget about the recommendations on the back of the formula can!|`|wUfZJvbUaa	well, keep in mind that the charts are just guidelines.. feed on demand and enough for your baby. this is just my opinion, just to make sure, you can also ask her doctor.|`|3iGhO7Y1aa	Every child is different, she is drinking a little over and above at the amount, put that might be very temporilary and it will balance itself out in time|`|Apdwkw66aa	omg...don't worry! My daughter is almost 11 months old and still has 6 bottles a day (including about 2 bottles during the night....) If anyone should worry its me not you!!! :) LOL|`|voj4H6Fpaa	all babies are different. if she is hungry, then follow her cues and feed her. she will stop when she is full.

6PEOqeLOaa	I have never heard that you poop a lot through out the day. I have heard that labor feels like you are going to take a massive dump. I have also heard that you can have diarrhea when you are in labor. I have also heard that most woman urinate and poop while they are pushing the baby out. Again i have never heard that pooping a lot through out the day is a symptom of labor...good luck|`|r6IRYVRnaa	No i never heard that! i know when labor starts it feels like you have to poop, but its the baby!

ojVl4Gowaa	Absolutely! Sometimes I wake up and don't even feel like I have a belly (though it's there, it somehow seems smaller) and other times I feel like I'm a weeble wobble about to explode. <br>  <br>  I think it's partially mental, and partially dependent on baby's position.

The right guy will come around, you don't even need to look for him, I wasn't looking when my 'mr. perfect' came and sweep me off my feet. Become friends with lots of guys, get to know them. This sounds sort of bad, but 'talk' to a few different guys at a time. Think about it, if you are talking to three guys at the same time, at least one of them is bound to be a good guy. I know this sucks to hear, but the right guy will come around whether or not you are looking for him, so it is best to focus on your life and not finding 'mr. perfect' be patient he will come, but don't settle for some jerk while your waiting.<br>   I hope you find your prince charming soon, or rather he finds you soon, good luck!|`|Av9jeRAkaa	same problem, they will come to you when you least expect it|`|oGHtaaCkaa	It's just what the first answerer said. <br>  I know it's annoying to think about and say, but honestly if you just focus on your life and not on guys, one will come around.|`|PFmSuBgraa	Go to places where you will meet peoepl that share your interests.  When I was looking for Mr. Right (found him too) I went to the bookstores, library's, and online chat rooms with topics that interested me.  This way you already anrrow down the search to guys who share common interests.  it sounds like you're being choosy which si good because the only thing worse than being alone is being with soeone who isn't really the right guy.|`|FZQ2KHDvaa	Pathetically, it is part of, what I would call the game of 'Selection and, Rejection'.<br>  <br>  I went without a 'true' girlfriend, all through high school.  I fel like there was a sign on my forehead, that said 'Do not date him'.<br>  <br>  So you are not alone.|`|3Pmq0rUMaa	that happens to me too. but i just learn from my mistakes and then wait for my perfect man.<br>  <br>  Good luck! =]
29944ccd64861970ae51bf4345a57f13aa	I opted for the natural miscarriage, as my doctor told me that a D&C may leave scars that would take longer to heal, and may lead to another miscarriage if I conceived too soon.  I have heard different from other women who visit other doctors.  Basically I don't think the doctors even know much about miscarriage, as they always say, "Sometimes this just happens, we don't know what caused it, but it's not your fault."<br>  <br>  My doctor told me that the reason you conceive easier after a loss, natural or D&C, is because your body is in the frame to support pregnancy, therefor it is more likely to support a new pregnancy, and have the hormones already in use to help a new pregnancy develop.  As I've said, this is just what I was told by my doctor, everyone I've talked to says their doctor told them something different.|`|yp9rEMSraa	Dont know about this one but did some research and here is what other Q&A cites had for answers.....<br>  <br>  <br>  All the doctors I talked to said you are more fertile after a d&c and the success rate of getting pregnant is higher after a d&c.....I asked why and a doctor told me because your uterus is all fresh and clean. I dont know how true this is, but hey it sounds good!<br>  <br>  My doctor told me that I would be more fertile after my D&C because they go in there and clean everything out. I'm not sure it happens the same way with a natural miscarriage. Good luck ttc! Lots of baby dust!!<br>  <br>   had a d&c and i have become pregnant 3wks later my dr said it was fine aslong as mentally ready but i cant answer for natural because all my m/c have need d&c but goodluck and baby dust........<br>  <br>  So the myth is that you are more fertile but having a MC can throw your cycle off. The best way to get preg now is to chart your ovulation or use an opk monitor :) Good <br>  <br>   I had a miscarriage in early Sept. 2006 (after 8 months of trying to get pregnant). I ended up having to have a D&C due to the fact that it was a twin pregnancy therefore it would take my body a long time to get rid of the high level of hormones. After having the D&C my doctor did tell me it would make things easier to get pregnant since the D&C "cleans everything out". She said that everythign would "stick" better after the D&C. Well, It ended up taking 4 months to get pregnant after the D&C so it was much sooner that the 1st time. Hope this helps!<br>  <br>  <br>  Here is just a few...i hope this helps you.....lots of baby dust to you

0vLU2GGGaa	7 years old is not much a baby girl to me anymore, but since you let her sleeps with you for so long, it will be quite difficult for her to go back to her own bed.  Just tell her that she is old enough to sleep on her own, expect a lot of fuss at the beginning but stick to it.|`|RmFVYkxeaa	No. This is not normal. You've got a tough battle on your hands since you've let it go on for so long. You should have taught her how to sleep on her own a lot sooner. You may have to seek professional advice on this one. You could try reading her a book in her bed and lying in there with her... until she falls asleep. Then go into your own bed. Get her a night light, and maybe a big cuddly teddy bear, really big, so she feels safe. After a while sit on her bed next to her lying in bed and read the story and sit there until she falls asleep. Eventually you might be able to leave the room after the book and tell her you're just making a cup of tea and then coming back. Of course come back, so she knows you're telling the truth. After a while you might be able to leave more often whilst she's dozing off and just check in on her every 2 or 3 minutes... You don't know unless you try. But you need to change this behaviour straight away. It's in her best interest to do so, it will build self confidence.|`|5Nxb8aqRaa	i would get a blanket with disney princess on it or something and tell her that she is a big girl and that she needs to be able to sleep on her own but shes 7 she should be sleeping by herself i mean when i was little i only used to sleep when i got scared|`|75acbeaefbdb50e3100c79930d1c607caa	so 7 is not a baby lol<br>  just lay with her in her bed for like 20 min in the day and at nite<br>  if she come to ur bed in the middle of the nite just walk back to her bed <br>  till she falls asleep it prob will take like 2 weeks but it will work it u stay with it good luck|`|xrfD9Jqnaa	Buy her something that would want to make her sleep in her bed. Like a princess blanket orr stuffed animal. Tell her that "big girls"don't sleep with mommy anymore.  Use an older cousin or sibling as an example. Say something like " You see (name here) doesn't sleep with mommy anymore, and there i big boy/girl" Or to help her get used to sleeping in her own bed, tuck her in with a good night kiss and maybe a story. Not a princess story. Maybe just a story when she was a little girl, or when you were younger. Another thing that would help is putting her in her own bed, and laying down next to her. Maybe rub her back or something relaxing. Then after you see she's asleep, leave. But every night take a shorter nap. Hope this helps. Good luck!|`|OCKLSoKqaa	make her sleep in her own bed. if she gets up simply say nothing to her and take her back to her own room. do this continually until she gets the point that she cannot sleep with you anymore. and explain this to her that night time is a time when mommy needs to be alone to think about the day and other things. and also tell her that she is 7 years old now and is a big girl and can sleep by herself. if she does sleep on her own for a week reward in a some way. maybe take her out to dinner or buy her a new dress or item of clothing or something small like that. nothing too extravagent!<br>  <br>  good luck!!|`|o43uZSDJaa	get her to sleep in her bed any way possible, i was 11 when i stopped sleeping in my parents bed, i know really old. i was warped lol. i would suggest a night light. or you can stay with her in her room until she goes to sleep in her own bed.|`|5v65I0Jmaa	ask if shes scared if the dark put a night light in it if she wants a teddy get her a teddy or if shes scared say you will give her a piece of candy or you guys will go out for ice cream once every week or two if she sleeps in her room those nights. It works anymore questions contacts me at heather.greene@live.com|`|lVa2zYrlaa	My nephew was the same way.  Maybe you buy her cool little animated sheet like..Princess or Dora {whatever she likes}. Put them on her bed and tell her she needs to sleep with her new lil friends. She is a big girl now and thats where big girls sleep. She might like it the first night,maybe not the second night...just stay consistent with it and it will work out.  Good Luck!!|`|r6IRYVRnaa	That's a problem< let her fall asleep n then put her in her bed!Well Good luck|`|XzV4bUeFaa	This is such a common question.  If all parents just realized that once they start allowing it from infancy or babyhood, it will never change for many years.  The parents create the "monster" and then want to know what to do.  You have to be firm, let child know that she/he needs to sleep in own bed/room and is not allowed in parents bed.  Every time they come in they need to be escorted back to bed w/one sentence only, "You need to sleep in your own bed."  You may have to do this for many nights and many times ea. night.  However, you have to be STRONG no matter how much child screams and cries.  When the child finally realizes that no matter what they say, do, etc., that you will not give in, the child will finally stay where they belonged in the first place.  When your child finally does stay in bed for the night, reward them w/praise and perhaps a special treat.  This will let them know that you are happy w/proper behavior.  Remember, anyone reading this should let whoever they know who has a new baby to not allow baby to sleep w/them.|`|8j7FCEOraa	Heres the thing about your question...<br>  <br>  she is not your BABY girl!<br>  <br>  Shes a big girl, and until you realize this and start to treat her as one then things will not change.
Xu5BtID1aa	I know what you mean!! I was the same way when I first started to get on here!! This is a GREAT support group for all of us girls trying SO HARD to get prego!!

e0eb82b689e1db392eb51c89982ed115aa	its not "unsafe" to fly, its just not advisable. Your cabin is pressurized. The worry is most people have slight fears of flying and BP can rise on a plane. Nervousness can bring on labor, and pre-labor is more likely at this time. So they dont want you to give birth on the plane. Thats all. If the flight is less than 3 hours and you have had NO history of high blood pressure, your healthy, and no pre-term labor, you can get a note and fly. Then before you come back also go to a doc and get re-checked quick for another flight back. They will let you. I flew for my moms cancer treatments up to 35 weeks with my first, and there was no problems. Then the doc said to stop because i had high BP. SO I drove instead only once. Nothing bad happened.<br>  Blood clots are only a worry if its a LONG flight, more than 3 hours. Then you can request that you sit up in the front where there is more leg room, be aware you have to request that early on, so if he already has tickets and can not switch seats, you should not do it if you cant get up and walk a little or switch positions.|`|kaqPSgTVaa	When your doctor tells you not to. It's usually the third trimester. Also MOST airlines will not let you fly starting around 30 weeks.|`|jQCmJQrtaa	i believe its 30 weeks or under is fine but no more as its unsafe <br>  <br>  good luck ;)|`|sIr2fWh6aa	Generally, once into your 3rd trimester, doctor's recommend not flying due to the increased amounts of fluid in your body..riding in a plain could cause blood clots, etc.  Ask your doctor, because he/she may be different, but generaly it's after the 3rd trimester starts.|`|uLcUrQ8Yaa	I don't think it is a good idea to fly after you are 20 weeks.  I no your fiance wants you to go. But I will tell him you didn't feel save with flying. If he loved you and your unborn child he would accept that.|`|wphI41wNaa	Air lines wont let you fly after your a certain week others need a note from your doctor saying its ok but I think youll be to far along for them to let you you can call them and see tho
Apdwkw66aa	Hi, I definitely think I had post-partum depression. My daughter is 11 months old now and I think its been about 3 weeks or so where I feel like I am getting back to "normal"...whatever that is! I asked my doctor about it and she said her first step is have a mother speak with a therapist and then maybe medication if that doesn't work. I know its hard to discuss with people but talking about it with your doc is the best thing you can do for yourself and for your baby. You may not realize it now because you are depressed but your baby can sense the depression and probably the distance from you. You shouldn't be ashamed...go get help. The sooner you do the faster you'll feel better. In the mean time there are things you can do for yourself:<br>  take good fish oil supplements (they helped me a lot!!)<br>  exercise<br>  get some sun<br>  eat good/drink lots of water<br>  I also took B vitamin supplements which helped too<br>  <br>  Hope this helps a little|`|723QHuicaa	Effectively, my PND started at the birth of my daughter. Id planned a natural birth in a lovely birthing centre which quickly turned badly and ended up in an emergency section at a hospital 20miles away with me and my daughter in hospital for 5 days after birth, both on anti-biotics. It really upset me, I had spent a lot of time researching and building the right birthplan for ME and it all went out the window.<br>  <br>  I spoke to some people (some incredibly stupid people)  who made me think that if I went to a dr and told them I was struggling, that I would have social services beating my door down to take my child from me.<br>  <br>  So I carried on, struggling and staying quiet. It got to 10m post partum, and I literally could barely function. I was dragged to the drs where I broke down. I was prescribed Fluoxetine (prozac) and assured no-one would be coming to take my child. 2 weeks later I started to feel normal again. that was 8m ago and i'm now weaning from the anti-depressants.<br>  <br>  People confuse post natal depression as not loving your child, wanting to harm them, etc. With me, my problem was not my daughter, it was me. To all those around me I was doing a great job, but I was constantly criticising myself, and nothing I done was ever good enough for me. My sleep patterns were erratic causing me to be tired and ratty through the day. My eating habits became eraatic - i wouldnt eat till 8pm then Id binge till I went to bed.|`|ZYlr9TSBaa	I have PND, my daughter is a little over a month old.<br>  <br>  She wasn't a planned baby, and her father broke up with me when I was 33 weeks pregnant after two and a half years for someone else - a recipe for disaster.<br>  <br>  I ended up having the epidural which meant I was numb from the waist down, couldn't feel my contractions, couldn't feel her coming out and I didn't know she'd been delivered til I was told. It was a massive shock. Then she was plonked on my chest which threw me off guard. My first photo with her I am frowning at her with a dazed look on my face.<br>  <br>  The next few weeks are a blur. BF was SO hard and SO painful, I couldn't bond with her, I didn't feel like a mother, I didn't feel like she was my daughter, I was looking after her cos I had to, not cos I wanted to. Then things hit a boiling point with her dad which led to my HV and doctor diagnosing me with PPD.<br>  <br>  PLEASE talk to someone if you think you have it, please don't suffer in silence. It doesn't make you any less of a mother for admitting you could have it. I've been on anti depressants for three weeks now and they've made a huge difference. Plus just giving myself a challenge each day - go for a walk, do my nails, do my hair - not massive tasks but enough to make me feel i've achieved something. Try and do that too. Hugs to you hun xxx|`|AA11952283	I would say for you to contact your gyn immediately!I'm going through a bit of that myself,although for a different reason.I'm just finding out I have high I mean high bloodpressure and did'nt have b4 or during pregnancy,I'm on all this medicine and had to stop breastfeeding my 3 month old.The doctors can't offer me an explanation,so I've been doing some crying myself.This is a very serious matter for us both.I went and talked to my gyn and she tried to put me on bloodpressure medicine to control it and so I could continue to breast feed but it was'nt strong enough so I had to go to a cardiologist and now it's under control.If your ashamed don't be this ppd goes on more than people say.Some people try and deal with it on there own but that's not good.It's an imbalance and you need medicine.My doctor also put me xanax the lowest mg,I really did'nt want nothing to strong.My whole thing is just wondering will my bloodpressure get back normal,and will I be able to breastfeed her again because I'm still pumping but of course wasting it but trying to keep it going just in case they find a pill I can take and still nurse.I know how you feel,like I said different circumstances but kinda feeling the same.Good luck,please go and talk to your gyn they will know what to do.|`|d8fSVX23aa	Please go see the doctor as soon as you can, I know you don't want to because fo the tears but that's the point you are not in control of your emotions right now and need help.<br>  <br>  I tried to hide it and never told a soul for ages, from wanting to put my daughter in the trash bin, take her back to the hospital stating there had been a mistake and she wasn't mine, to in the end wanting to drive my car into trees as I was driving along just to end my living hell.<br>  <br>  This is when I admitted to myself it was time to get help. Yes I felt even worse because then I felt a failure because people then knew I wasn't coping which in my mind proved I was a bad mom. but in the end with the help of doctors the dark cloud lifted and everything is fine now many years on, it scares me how bad I was before I finally sought help and how close I came to either hurting myself or the children.<br>  <br>  Get help now !|`|hitgP4Hoaa	after having my son i was very bad like i couldnt look at my own child taught everybody taught i was bad mother just taught the worst about everything. i tried to fight it myself for a couple of months and my mother and my mother in law notice i was getting really bad like say as yourself when i was on my own cried and cried and didnt want to leave the has nor talk to anybody. at first i didnt no how to speak to my partner but then one night i broke down and told him all cause if i didnt i think we would have broken up, so i went to a private doctor i never used before, reason for going to this lady was my mam suffered PND really really bad and my mam used her. so i went to get broke down told her everything was in there for like an hour she put me on tablets and you  no what im 14 months down the road and i havent looked back once i go back to this lady doctor every month and she sits and we talk everything through and i just feel great coming out of it. well i can say for you please seek help cause its such a hard illness to fight yourself go and talk to someone cause trust me hun you will be different women in a few weeks and talk to your husband cause the more you talk about how you feel the better you will feel yourself for getting it out..<br>  <br>  Sorry bit of long story but good luck i no  how your feeling|`|wFVLP5l3aa	i went to my doctor as soon as i noticed symptoms my partner made me at first i was going to just get counceling but the next couple of days it got worse i started getting angry at my son and feeling horrible and guilty so i went on the antidepresents for the sake of my son and its realy starting to help<br>  <br>  good luck with your situation i know that you feel so ashamed to be feeling like this, i know i did, ut its nothing against you. im sure your a fantastic mother but post natal depression can escelate and get out of hand verry quickly so you realy should talk to your doctor and get help. even if its just to get counceling to have someone to talk to<br>  <br>  good luck

(hint hint)....and fun.|`|GR07LyyTaa	i was at work when i took a preg test cause my hubby swore up and down that i wasn't and it would be a waist of money so i did it behind his back and then sent him a picture of the positive test in a text and then he made me take like 7 more.. literally.. oh and go get a blood test.. he was happy but just didn't believe it because we'd been tryin for so long.. but after he received the pic he sent it to his mom and friends.|`|Jcz29H2Oaa	you could do a scavenger hunt type thing.... leave a note by the front door telling him to go somewhere else in the house... then there will be a note there leading him somewhere else... and after a few of thoes lead him to a pair of baby booties or a baby bottle with a note in it about the baby! good luck!|`|jgtfWjE4aa	get a cheap pair of baby shoes in a neutral color and tie them to your husbands car mirrior and write him a little note...that'd be cute...i think my aunt did something similar to that.|`|lMvwVvqbaa	put a shirt on your other child that says... i am a big/brother sister...

Because, That says you don't trust him.|`|AwrtwIpIaa	That's okay....one person always has to love the other more.<br>  <br>  Maybe he will cheat on you, or do something to hurt you so that you love him less.  Then your love will be more equal, and you will feel better about things.|`|IcAO0QuBaa	Just ask  him if he still loves you and tell him why you don't think that he does. Maybe hes going threw something that you don't know about.|`|CnM2U1bXaa	sounds like your overthinking it. just ask him about it, he wont be offended|`|6YbxTlDCaa	welcome to the cooling down period of your relationship...by now you must know that this is normal...or maybe it's time you did something extra to get him re-excited about you. Remember that your life is important and that he is not the center of your universe, you are.  Get excited about your future...have a purpose...   if he doesn't come around, keep moving forward...you will attract someone even better...let him be the one to get off the couch and try to keep up with you for a change...|`|PFmSuBgraa	he may be trying to pull away but we can't obsess over maybe's.  Just enjoy the time you have together.  if it isn't enough then you have to decide if this is what YOU want.  If he isn't able to meet your needs then maybe it's time for YOU to pull away and look at this relationship from a different perspective.|`|Xf9QGTBraa	Well, if you guys have been together for almost a year you should be able to openly confront him.<br>  There is a definite problem here and it needs to be addressed.<br>  Now, it may not be a problem with you, maybe he's depressed?<br>  Make sure to talk to him and be in an honest state of mind, both you and him.|`|v852MqtIaa	sounds like hes scared of losing you hes scared of pulling u in closer he doesent no if u want him to and he it prob got old of saying i love you every day and his parents might have made it were u cant come over on weekends cause of school alot of possibilities good luck =) and ur prob thinking about it to much|`|CMg0xzAyaa	You're young, whatever you do don't have sex with him cuz that will just make things worse ok.  if you thing somethings going on then there probably is something going on.  tell him you need a serious talk and if he's immature about that then you have your answer, he's not a good guy.|`|y43XQwUuaa	It's funny that this is my exact situation :/|`|zB2PIUmzaa	ur just thinking things!|`|U9cLxjUjaa	True love is never lopsided.<br>  <br>  If the relationship is going in the direction where things seem one sided, its not a healthy relationship.<br>  <br>  Relationships shouldn't be 10-90, 30-70, or 50-50 even, they should be 100-100.<br>  <br>  And no offense, but at 17 and 18, relationships typically don't last forever anyways.  Sounds like you want something more serious than he does.  That's fine, just find someone who's on the same page as you, and will give it 100% just like you.|`|lIx6kngbaa	Girl, you should have more confidence yourself. People already told you  are too pretty for this guy.  Remember you are special, don't just hold on to anyone who pays you little attention , make sure you really like them. Some many girls get caught up in the one guy that goes to there school and they don't realize there are a million high schools across untied states with a trillion guys to choose from. If you feel hes not into you drop him, however if you really like him keep him. But most of the time girls look back  at the guys that they  wasted so much time with and laugh, because they now found the man of there dreams who really cares about them. Good luck! Just have more confidence in yourself get involved in things, pretty girls are a dime and a dozen there's going to be a lot of pretty girls hes going to see, make sure you have something to offer besides pretty looks, that severyone.|`|ORB3owf7aa	your not over thinking it<br>  mine did hte exact same thing<br>  wen i say exact i mean EXACT same thing<br>  i asked him about it and broke up with me<br>  <br>  so tht might be it<br>  or maybe its cause he is a guy lol<br>  good luck<br>  let me know
0BC2WTyoaa	I took a Dollar Tree test and it was positive 7 days before AF was expected.<br>  Make sure you are getting a test that is 25MiU or lower.  First response early results are good ones.|`|WWcaKZ7Qaa	I took one 5 days before my period was due and got a positive but it was so ridiculously faint that it didn't even look like a line. I had to take the test apart and hold it up to the light to see what looked like a shadow of a line. I'd suggest waiting a few more days. I took a test a few days later and got a pretty dark line.|`|W1p6LetFaa	Most pregnancy tests cannot detect a pregnancy that early (if you're pregnant).  It says so right on the box that the results are only 50% accurate when you take them that early (which in my mind, is not accurate AT ALL!).  I did not get a positive test until 5 days AFTER my period was supposed to come but never did.  If you want to test that early, go ahead, but you'll have to keep testing if it's negative, because it might be a false negative since it's too early to detect the pregnancy.  But if it is positive, you'd better believe that you are probably pregnant!|`|xY1kohVRaa	I tested 6 days before my period was due for the first time, and didn't see a second line until the next day but it was VERY faint.<br>  The next day, (5 days before my period was due) i got a definate positive :)<br>  <br>  I used a clear blue pregnancy test (+ or -) 5 days before.|`|uDSBfakzaa	ive done it, right away. it said i was negative but i believed it. try it any if you really do feel pregnant go to the doctors, its just to confirm|`|zk3Bp9uNaa	Yes - and yes, it was accurate.<br>  <br>  I tested ont he day my period was due too - just to be sure and got a much stronger positive|`|WGadfTJaaa	Yes  I've done a test 5 days before my period and it was positive  and I was indeed pregnant, Another time same thing but it came up negative and I was pregnant so it all depends if your HGG levels a high enough to be read at the time.<br>  <br>  Probably best to wait till you miss your period  or see your doctor for a blood test.<br>  <br>  Good Luck|`|qaoIdRSZaa	i was due on the 18th (roughly) and i took a test on the 14th, it was VERY faint (i took it half way through the day) so i thought id just do it again the next morning first thing to be sure. i did it again and it was also positive, still faint but a little darker. <br>  But they say no matter how faint the line is if its there, your pregnant. tho go to the doctors to be sure.<br>  GL :)|`|tcHkn0VIaa	I took the digital one the night before i was supposed to start and it popped positive within 30 seconds! i am now 16 weeks prego :) good luck.|`|r8wkV01Saa	nope
FTW82Wumaa	I think it's a good plan for yourself and for for your family.<br>  I'm starting school for nursing (LPN) in April and I'm due in early September. Even though I'll be gone a few hours a day, my husband will be with the baby and it's definitely what's best for our family.<br>  Good luck and I wish you all the best!|`|b6EyFLgUaa	I know now that my mother worked 3 jobs to support us. She had her cosmetology lisc already but because of past events it wasnt enough money. I dont remember her being gone at all. I do remember spending time with her by the river, and playing when she was home. I remember the wonderful people that were in my life because she had to work. Your child wont remember you being gone and if she does it wont be any form of resentment as she get older she will understand and be proud of you. Do whats best for both of you, it will be hard but in the end the best.|`|lMvwVvqbaa	well i go to night school three nights a week for that long for medical and really I spend all my day with my children so they really love the time they spend with daddy. The first couple of days you will worry but it is for the best.|`|iTEf1dP3aa	2 yrs ago, I was working 3 jobs and going to school p-time...I had just turned into a single mom living w/my parents. needless to say, the most time I spent with him was in the weekends. I hated every moment of it, but I now have a career that I really wanted and spend time with him like a normal mommy would. Its for the best!|`|uj1A73ZGaa	I went to cosmetology school when I was in high school before I had my girls. <br>  If you want to do it than go for it. If she goes to bed early than she will be fine. You will learn lots and have lots of fun. Just make sure if anyone cuts your hair they know what they are doing. :)<br>  <br>  Good luck
OHYQvcfJaa	Believe in yourself, and it may be hard for you, but try to control your actions. Practice reading outloud to yourself. I cannot remember all the states' either. When you're bored, go in your room, or what/where ever and read a list off all the states to yourself. Math is not easy for me either, but i try,and if i fail, i try again. Try not to cut your hair off either. You're in a reading class because they want to help you learn & become a better reader, not because you're retarded ( which your NOT!)<br>  <br>  And for Caty, you're not perfect either. so it'd be best to keep your mouth shut.<br>  <br>  Also, you can study for your drivers' test. I'm sure you'll do great next time.|`|AA11296427	Aww, you're not retarded.<br>  <br>  I stutter too, when i'm nervous. I sure can't remember all of the States!

sbeoF50gaa	Let him sleep! It's normal for babies to start sleeping through the night.|`|CmnnfJEDaa	my son had this and do not wake him up during the night, enjoy the sleep while you can. you are lucky some people have there child crying all during the night also. i wouldn't be worried, let him wake up himself, he will let you know when he is hungry|`|Wb9oqcWDaa	I would definitely let your child sleep.  I went through this with my son and I asked the Dr what I can do to help him.  If your baby is formula fed try to change the formula to a gentle formula with less lactose in it.  Like Enfamil Gentlease or something similar.  I swear as soon as I changed my sons to that he instantly was more happy and cried less.  Also try to make things quite and not hectic for him so his nerves aren't running.  This makes colic worse.|`|ZKxgqK3zaa	8-9 hours at night is good! I would try the Enfamil Gentlease and if that is STILL making him colicy I would try the Enfamil Nutrimigen. These formula's you can find at WalMart.<br>  <br>  Also there is this stuff called Gripe Water. You can find it at Target for like 7.00 and it is ginger and fennel(good for digestion & upset tummy!) The brand is Little Tummies. It is great stuff! <br>  <br>  Usually that works for my little girl. Hope things get better for you!|`|O76KyEOYaa	my health visitor told me that as long as they sleep they are happy.I wouldnt wake him up, let him sleep and it also gives you a break from him crying and getting upset with the colic. Have you tried Infacol?? I sweare by this stuff and it is really good for colic or an upset stomach. Hope this helps.

OHYQvcfJaa	Who cares? You're one of the greatest 13 year olds i've heard of. I know plenty of 13 y.o, and they'd rather sit home and play video games or look at inappropriate stuff + way more. You can wear whatever you like, be yourself.. Good for you, because most 13 year olds are having sex already..keep going in your path kid and don't get lost and don't go on someone elses'..you can also move to the juniors section to feel a little mature..like JCpennys junior section, or walmarts.<br>  <br>  Here's JCP:<br>  <a href="http://www4.jcpenney.com/jcp/X2.aspx?DeptID=50455&CatID=50455&cmCatLevel=2&cmResetCat=True&CmCatId=&mscssid=6ecda16dcc37d4f54bdd2682a7d4b7119xMnVNoVza3oxMnVNoVza3W200B612C9F30D0C15B3F3E0B64EE0004E4190905422&cmAMS_T=G1&cmAMS_C=D1" rel="nofollow">http://www4.jcpenney.com/jcp/X2.aspx?Dep...</a><br>  <br>  <br>  Walmart:<br>  <a href="http://www.walmart.com/catalog/catalog.gsp?cat=133201&fromPageCatId=14503" rel="nofollow">http://www.walmart.com/catalog/catalog.g...</a><br>  <br>  <br>  Or go to aeropostale or abercrombie, if you have money to spend.|`|aOCfLAJJaa	Do what ever you want!

igJJ37Tjaa	Talk to your nurse or doctor, but you can use apple juice.  For 2 months about 1/2 oz to 1 oz a day.  Just not during normal feeding times because you don't want him getting full on "empty" liquids...no real food for them.<br>  My daughter did the same thing. <br>  Also rub his tummy, it helps get things going!|`|GR07LyyTaa	that happend to my daughter.. at first her poop was soo hard it made her butt bleed and freaked me out and so i took her to the dr and he said it was probably in there from being on the reg. formula.. her poop was still a little harder then before but the dr said it was normal.. now that she eats baby food too i wish it was the same as her poop on just soy formula lol... it'll be ok..|`|r6IRYVRnaa	apple juice!!

FBhjhjR0aa	I just finished my 5th month of clomid. I was doing 50 mg at first, then Doctor increased it to 100mg, still nothing. We are now moving on to AFI. Clomid works for some, and not for others. I was supposed to take the clomid for 6 months. but I have refused the last month of it, because it's too much on my emotional well being, with all the side effects, and the way it mimicks pregnancy symptoms. I wish you the best, The best advice I can give, is try to stay sane, it's alot to deal with and can be a real heart breaker|`|bWyKAFwuaa	yes it is totally normal to ovulate at different times on clomid, I did. I ovulated on cd 23 last time, and this time I got a positive today!!!!! at cd 14, it is a guessing game with clomid just be sure to bd!|`|yp9rEMSraa	Im not sure about the clomid but remember with the CBE monitor when you use clomid it might not tell you the right results...look at your directions for the answers why cause i personally dont remember what they were...
FBhjhjR0aa	Depo can take up to 2 years to get out of your system. and it can also take up to 2 years after your last shot, befor your cycles are regular again.|`|kaqPSgTVaa	Take another test. If it' still negative you are not pregnant and need to get your next shot ASAP.|`|bWyKAFwuaa	you are not pregnant, depo makes your period really weird....and it is soooooo rare to get pregnant that fast off depo i am sure you're fine
R9mQNOCnaa	Try sitting the bathroom with the shower running on hot to steam the room up.This will clear up his lungs.If you have a humidifier put it in his room.If he has a fever you can wipe him down with a cool rag and avoid him getting too hot.put a diaper and a tshirt with sox on his feet and keep checking on him during the night.If he gets a fever try adding rubbing alcohol on the wash cloth and rub him down behind his neck,his arms and leg.Not on his face.Other than that,not much until you see the doctor except hold him and try to comfort him.I know it's hard to see your babies sick but no matter what we do we can't prevent it.Good luck.|`|uRReUowHaa	If you don't know the answer to this, you need to find someone who can take care of children. Obviously you can't.|`|WZQKevt8aa	You might be able to get something to break up the stuff in his chest from the chemist or you could try a vapour rub on his chest or try a warm wet cloth on his chest. Steam usually helps, so maybe a shower? There really isn't much more you can do, but if he has a blocked nose, you can usually get a type of nasal spray to unblock it but you would have to see what age people can use it. Also keep both of their fluids up. Good luck.|`|8iLVnYRUaa	For the two month old I would raise the head end of the cot with thick heavy books or catalogues under the cot legs.  This will mean they are more comfortable and not struggling to breathe.
VKQzj4Pmaa	It sounds as though she feels superior to you, because she is a parent and you are not. She is taking pride and arrogance out of being a mom and having children, thus she is a harder worker, she is wiser, she is more knowledgeable, and she is stronger, more experienced, has more going for her, yadda yadda yadda. Basically, it sounds like she sees you as inferior because you didn't accomplish motherhood and all the wonderful things she accomplished by being a mother herself.<br>  <br>  I know it's hard, but don't let her get to you. She is arrogant and ignorant.|`|723QHuicaa	Next time she is rude, ask her why she feels the need to undermine you becayse you have a different lifestyle. I dont think there is a reason - I think she is just plain rude.|`|uP08b6K4aa	In my opinion and from what you've briefly written, it seems to me that she sees you as a threat, in that you have all this freedom to do as you want, and by talking down to you about something she feels you have no clue about, she feels that she can take back some of that power.<br>  <br>  You seriously need to ignore this woman and if she makes a comment so flippantly again, acknowledge her, smile and walk away, I'm sure there are far more interesting people to spend your time with at work!<br>  <br>  Good Luck x|`|PZZkjST7aa	Ignore the digs if you can, she's just sounds rude, maybe don't bring up the subject of children yourself first and try and steer the conversation away if she does.<br>  If it's any consolation, I'm a parent and I would not have known instantly what she meant by 'weird stuff' because it could have been any number of things, so it was a reasonable question for you to ask.|`|iTEf1dP3aa	Women can be very conniving! I feel many jealous people are rude and mainly take stabs at people who they envy...this may be why. She may be stressed at home, she then sees your stress free life and dislikes you for it....|`|5270639c059ab08c1b3431555f150db7aa	Blow it off, hun, don't let the bad ones drag you down.|`|0vLU2GGGaa	she might be secretly jealous of your carefree life ... just ignore her.|`|0045ad487ff6d67f68a5efcc905d5b17aa	Shes trying to justify her boring life by bullying you.  That's what it is, shes making you feel bad about yourself which make her feel better.  She jealous of your freedom!  Stay away from her, she's bitter and twisted.  Enjoy your lifestyle, you deserve it!|`|M2yERqNSaa	ignore it, some people are absent minded<br>  <br>  if your life is all that lovely then her comment wouldnt affect you honey <br>  <br>  (( HUGS ))<br>  <br>  ignore her|`|33361f975202a28024124ac0b9d8b821aa	Shes a self righteous *****.  I cannot stand women like this!  Try your best to ignore her, she has issues.|`|PFmSuBgraa	it could be that she on some level envies your freedom.  I have a single friend who hasn't had children yet and while mine are growing and fully dependent on me she gets to jet all over the world on vacations and soend her money on maritni's and expensive dinners.  We just share our joys and dissappointments.  She wants children but doesn't really see it in her future - tick, tick tick ya know :)  So, it is likely just some jealousy.  Ignore it, she has to come to terms with her life choices just as you have found peace with yours.|`|UR9BX77haa	She's obviously got a chip on her shoulder, I am the only person on my section at work with a child & I never make comments like that. I make a joke of it like if they are discussing a programme on TV & ask if I know what there talking about I make a comment about only knowing about cbeebies. I do think some mums suddenly act all superior , what they don't realise is that no ones interested, thats why I only talk about my daughter if something funny has happened or if someone asks.|`|wi6mkT30aa	Hey hon. I agree I think that is a bit rude and annoying if you ask me! I would stick up for yourself (Like you've been doing!) and say more about your nephews and neices! <br>  <br>  I think she is a proud mother and she probably thinks shes one of the best and looks down on others who have choosen NOT to become a parent. Which I think is rude because many people LOVE children, yet it's just not for them or their life style. Nothing wrong with that at all.<br>  <br>  <br>  She needs to grow up and get a hold of herself. She's would really get on my nerves because I think in her own mind she's better than most. Even on other subjects not just parenting!<br>  <br>  Good luck dealing with that thing!
9P26sacKaa	Actually, that's not too uncommon, but I would still look for a midwife who would take me earlier.  Midwives are typically better for low-risk women anyhow and give you a lot more time and attention.  Women who stay with midwives have less interventions during labor and have fewer c-sections.  Women who use midwives for prenatal care and birth tend to be happier overall with their care and the outcomes.<br>  <br>  You might not be able to hear a heartbeat until 11 weeks though, so if you do get an earlier appointment, don't get your hopes up about that.  <br>  <br>  Some doctors don't want to see a woman until the chances of miscarriage are nearly gone, but many midwives think it's good to meet before this time because the first trimester is a time when diet and other information is so important to the development of the fetus.  There are sometimes things a woman can do to avoid a miscarriage too, and if you haven't seen your care provider yet, you're less likely to feel comfortable calling them up when you do have symptoms and you might not even be in their system as a patient yet.<br>  <br>  I'd personally keep looking for a good midwife or doctor until you find one you really get along with and feel comfortable with.  This might not be your regular gynecologist.  This is the birth of your baby, you're only going to do this a few times in your life and you might as well make sure all of your birth and pregnancy experiences with medical people are as good as they can be.  It's worth interviewing many midwives and doctors and doing research to make sure you're with the right person or practice.|`|yWBmZrfAaa	It is a very common practice.  My OB told me once it was done because of the risk of miscarriage (most occur in the first 12 weeks).  He also said it was this way b/c if a woman miscarries after she has seen/heard a heartbeat it is a lot worse on them emotionally.  <br>  Also, they probably got enough bloodwork when they did your positive test to screen for all the STDs....at least that was how mine worked.  Good luck on your little miracle and CONGRATULATIONS!|`|9KpidWBEaa	That is normal, most times they will see you a little sooner but for the most part that's when you start going.  You wont be able to hear a heartbeat until 10-12 weeks anyway there is nothing to worry about.  You may want to call them and ask for vitamins so you get in the routine.  congrats and good luck!|`|6D4wSKriaa	It is normal not to see you OB/GYN or midwife until then, but you can make appointments with your GP to have a pap done or discuss any concerns you might have until you get in to see the OB.|`|CpiLHcTlaa	thats what happened to me. so i started just going to a regular doctor instead. if i have a problem then i'll go to an obgyn.  if your nervous go to your family doc before your appt with you obgyn|`|4p9sBdyTaa	This is actually a very common practice. If you do start to experience problems call them and they may work you in sooner.|`|ubo0HWtVaa	yeah thats quite some time away from now. if you don't feel comfortable with that. then try to find a different doctor, that you can get into sooner. good luck and congrats. when i was pregnant last year i found out the same time as you, i think i already had 2 appts by april 10. i even had a ultrasound to determine when baby was due.|`|2Pp2cDbJaa	I would get a new ob/gyn i was 5 weeks when i found out and they saw me right away, i was 7 weeks when i got my first ultrasound and i got to see my babys heart beat, they also had me come in ever few weeks to test my hydration and to see if everything was ok and to help me out with my morning sickness, Any way I would find a new doctor or maybe just see your regular doctor, but if you have any problems then call your ob and they will usually see you asap|`|zk3Bp9uNaa	No its normal not to be seem till 12weeks (after the first trimester and the chance of miscarriage falls)<br>  <br>  They dont normally do ultrasounds early, unless there is a history of miscarriage/problems or if you have bleeding etc.|`|oA8Rtyxuaa	usually they see you around 8 weeks, 12 weeks, 16 weeks and 20 weeks...then it depends on where you are in your pregnancy, any complications etc...|`|hDnX6Vx6aa	Its normal. My doctor wont see me till the 25th of march. Ill be 10 or 11 weeks. It sucks. Take your prenatal vitamins and eat healthy. IT will all work out.|`|e0eb82b689e1db392eb51c89982ed115aa	very normal. SInce a high number of first pregnancy's end in miscarriage. Not to scare you. There isnt really anything they can do. The baby is too small, to hear anything properly till 12 weeks. So they wait for that to be sure they hear the heart beat. They dont want to do it earlier because if they cant find the heart beat which is common at early weeks. It FREAKS the mom out. Only if you are spotting and having problems should you be going in that early. You can make an appointment with the nutritionist and talk about healthy diet, exercise, and pre-natals. Thats all you need to do at this time. Sit back, relax, enjoy. Dont over stress!!! Thats all they want you to do
ibFTUi1taa	I too take Tri Cyclin and I had nothing like that happen to me, but it does act differently for different people. <br>  I would advise a pregnancy test and see what happens. <br>  Stay calm. =)|`|A0eDA6RGaa	Your birth control may be causing your monthly to stop but you should see your doctor if you r active JIC|`|VPsDptrraa	I don't feel sorry for you.

AA11887900	It sounds to me like you're worried that your MIL is going to "take-over" your daughter and not let you be the mom. I've heard of grandparents who take over like that, the parents become "second" as the grandparents try to re-live their own early parenthood. Some are trying to make up for mistakes they made raising their children, others, like your MIL, didn't get a girl (or a boy) and want to do those things they didn't get to do the first time around.<br>  <br>  My FIL/MIL didn't get a chance to do it until my oldest was 2 years old, when we moved into a house very near them. During the 8 months we spent living near them they pretty much took over running every facet of his raising, except the parts that actually involved work. They bullied my husband and I into putting him into a "preschool" (glorified day care) of their choice even though I was a SAHM, and dictated how his room would be kept to the point of hiring a housekeeper (who we think was also a "spy" for them). I also had an infant son at the time. I did a better job of protecting him from their meddling, but they were working on getting him out of my care too.<br>  <br>  As mom, you have the right to draw the line wherever you want. If you insist on no visits oh, say, before 11 am or after 4 pm, it's your right to keep those hours private for yourself, your baby and your husband.<br>  <br>  Make clear rules to make sure she doesn't run roughshod over you. But also give her a little space to be "grandma." She could give you and your husband evenings out without the baby every week or two, time to go to a movie, or, during those early weeks, some time for you to sleep off the post-partum exhaustion that results from the physical efforts of labor.|`|4eTyCuRSaa	You are worried because you have an involved loveing grandmother?  <br>  <br>  And yet have no concern over your own mother who sounds like she couldn't careless about her new grandchild.<br>  <br>  Lady you have your priorities all backward!.<br>  <br>  And what is so bad about dark curly hair...I look great with it!|`|F6lZHRkVaa	Your baby's grandma is just as excited as you are! That's a wonderful thing. I know it seems nervewracking now and maybe you're afraid she's going to take over. Being pregnant can make your emotions go all topsy turvy too, so little things seem major. Try not to worry too much right now. Try to be happy that your baby is going to have a grandmother that cares so much about her. It's always good to have as many people as possible loving your baby. <br>  <br>  As for your own mother - I'm sorry she's not there for you right now. She may come around after the baby is born, but she might not. Try to accept that she might not. And enjoy having your mother in law dote on you for now, she can take the place of your absent mother.<br>  <br>  If your mil gets to be too much, gently tell her, "We were planning to buy that for the baby. But you could get us some diapers if you'd like!" <br>  <br>  Good luck and congratulations!|`|PFmSuBgraa	You're question seems to touch on some points that aren't fully detailed here.  if she is so helpful why would she be concerned about not seeing her grandaughter?  If she is being too helpful (trust me this will no longer be an issue once the hcild is born you'llw ant all the help you can get) simply tell her you are feeling emotionala nd overwhelmed and if she could keep the calls down to every other day and keep her spending down to a minimum it would make both you and the other st of grandparents feel more equal.|`|zhrGiQsKaa	it is normal for her to be excited, heck i would be too. you should be lucky you have someone who loves and cares for you that much.|`|c4sn6g3xaa	Don't worry - there is enough of that little "munchkin" to share with everyone.  Don't just leave your mom out - she may have problems that your not aware of and doesn't have time for the baby - you sound like you have an awesoe support system!    I am the grandma and my daughter could care less about her daughters babies - but to me - they are my world!!  Gosh, I hope you can update us!<br>  <br>  Good Luck!
WpGROxH8aa	If there is a downside to putting kids to bed early, its only that they're likely to wake up early. Its not going to harm them. And if they're getting up early anyway, its a good idea for them to go to bed as early as they can so they get plenty of sleep.|`|SnQvsOPwaa	Yes    My sons doctor even suggested a later bedtime at one time. It worked out fine.|`|c271e0d140cbe1902cabe87b6f0e3485aa	If he sleeps through the night then it wasn't too early.  There would have been no point keeping him up for another hour or so, if he was going to be grumpy and tired.<br>  <br>  Don't worry what others think, do what works for you, your baby and your family.|`|Wb9oqcWDaa	I think it is a little early, but if that is what works for your family I would go with it.  I would definitely pick 1 specific time that you want your baby to go to bed every night and stick to it.  So if 6 works better than 7:30 I would change it to 6 because your baby is going to get all mixed up.  Getting up earlier and then wanting to go to bed early, or getting up late and wanting to go to bed later than what you want.|`|1o820L3Daa	No, My daughter who is 5 (6 in May) goes to bed about 6:30-7:00pm each night. She gets up at about 6:30am every morning, so I don't think its too early, Its good for them to get sleep. It helps with development. My daughters teacher was very happy to hear she had a early bedtime.|`|Yi5Rgauoaa	There is nothing wrong with putting your kid to bead early every once in a while. I don't put my son (he's 2) to bed at the same time every night. And we don't nap at the same time every day. I wanted him to be flexible. I could never be the parent that HAS to put their child to bed at the same time every day or their whole system is ruined. If we are out shopping and he misses his nap I will put him to bed early especially if he is cranky. And as long as he seems to be getting enough sleep then whatever you are doing is fine. Some kids need routine but I guess I got lucky. My son just rolls with it. He goes to bed when I put him to bed and he rarely fusses. Everyone has their own routine.|`|PFmSuBgraa	Let them sleep!  Once they get older you'll WISH they woudl sleep when you want them too. :)  mine are 8 and 9 and if it's been a busy day for the family I encourage them to go to bed early as well.  I just tell them mommy is exhausted and I'm choosing to go to bed early, if you want to go also i will tuck you in, otherwise you're on your own tonight, be in bed by your bedtime.|`|9vyjAP6uaa	i am sure you know every child is different. I dont think it is too early. My son is 10 months and does sleep late. he wakes up at 8:00am sometimes 9:30 and takes 2 naps during the day and doesnt go to bed til 10pm. <br>  <br>  My doctor said to put him to bed 1/2 hour earlier each week. so he goes down at 9pm. he also told me what ever you do you ALWAYS need to leave ur child in his bed for 10hours. he should not see you at all for 10 hours so he gets the idea to sleep later. It has worked for us so far. I know its tiring and its not a crime to put him down. if he is not use to the hours he might wake up earlier tomorrow morning. <br>  <br>  Good luck
7m8ayTLjaa	what kind of carrier? Like a Snugli or a sling? Or a carseat? Please clarify!|`|oA8Rtyxuaa	what kind of carrier?|`|deIzFnV8aa	You mean like a sling or a front/back pack? - they wouldn't be able to sleep there during the night unless you were willing to walk around all night.<br>  <br>  Some babies like to nap in them or are calmed down by being walked around in them. Our DD was not one of them - would only fall asleep if it was a long walk, and wanted to be facing outwards and looking around. I think most babies do like to nap there, though.<br>  <br>  If you mean a car seat, again, it is a yes for some babies, a no for others.  Many young babies (0-2 months) sleep better on an incline.  If you do let a lot of napping/sleeping happen there, it will be a bit harder to get them to accept a crib later on, so just don't let it go on to too old (3+ months). Also, make sure they are safe in the carrier, not tippy or able to fall out or overheating or anything. And I believe it is bad for their heads to slump too far forward or to the side - makes it hard to breathe and puts pressure on the tummy.  You could try using a rolled blanket to make sure the head stays in place.  And supervised sleep (naps) would be best; I would be uncomfortable letting baby sleep in a car seat all night.|`|O76KyEOYaa	If you are referring to a car seat then YES definately, my 4 month old loves to sleep in hers and will sometimes sleep in it for 3 hours. Dont let your baby sleep all night in it though as this can cause curvature of the spine. Hope this helps.|`|7vRVF6wUaa	If you are talking about a car seat type carrier, do not let you child sleep in them for an extended period of time, can cause major neck and head problems.
l4mMBe5Aaa	Is he getting plenty of sleep?  My daughter gets cranky when she doesn't get proper naps during the day...|`|XSol0H6Uaa	He's probably bored.  Find new ways to entertain him.  Take him to the park, walk him in his stroller.  Play toys with him.
laVH1Bz3aa	you would file these under "critique"...<br>  <br>  Girls:<br>  <br>  Vienna Grace - Vienna is a name of a place, not a person<br>  <br>  Emmie Wynter - I advise against naming your child after misspelled seasons<br>  <br>  Axelle Evolet - the first name is a misspelled car part, and evolet looks completely fabricated or like someone dyslexic trying to write Violet<br>  <br>  Cadence Harlow - Harlow is the last name of an actress, and should not be used as a first name. Only famous people can get off doing that kind of thing to their poor, innocent children.<br>  <br>  Aimee Lousia - Assuming you misspelled Louisa unintentionally, I am all for this name. Both are spelled correctly and they flow nicely. Excellent choices.<br>  <br>  Emerson Elaine - Emerson is a last name, although lately it has been used as a boys' name for some ungodly reason. Do not give your child a name that is not for her gender.<br>  <br>  Boys:<br>  <br>  Asher Hendrix - Hendrix is a last name; do you really want to name your child after Jimi Hendrix, a musician who died from a drug overdose? Doesn't bode well for your child.<br>  <br>  Callum Henley - Both are last names, although Callum can pass as a first name if you're into the whole weird first name thing.<br>  <br>  Colby Carter - I love colby cheese. Its my favorite kind.<br>  <br>  Edward Anthony - Wonderful names that go well together. Gold star.<br>  <br>  Slayter James - Slayter is not a first name, and its spelled Slater as a last name|`|oYmZUO8Caa	I DO like your names, but I don't like "misspelled" names. I don't think it makes them look unique, I think it makes them look incorrect. BUT to each their own :) <br>  <br>  Vienna Grace - Reminds me of a cookie, LOL. Sorry.<br>  <br>  Emmie Wynter - Emmie is really cute. Do you like the name Gemma by any chance?<br>  <br>  Axelle Evolet - Don't like it.<br>  <br>  Cadence Harlow - Reversed it would sound amazing! I like it.<br>  <br>  Aimee Lousia - Cute. <br>  <br>  Emerson Elaine - I like Emerson a lot. <br>  <br>  Boys:<br>  <br>  Asher Hendrix - Not my style.<br>  <br>  Callum Henley - Cute.<br>  <br>  Colby Carter - Not my style.<br>  <br>  Edward Anthony - Aw! Cute.|`|EvgSMTjnaa	Girls:<br>  <br>  Vienna Grace 7<br>  <br>  Emmie Wynter 10 (love this name!)<br>  <br>  Axelle Evolet 8<br>  <br>  Cadence Harlow 4<br>  <br>  Aimee Lousia 5<br>  <br>  Emerson Elaine 6<br>  <br>  Boys:<br>  <br>  Asher Hendrix 7<br>  <br>  Callum Henley 8<br>  <br>  Colby Carter 3<br>  <br>  Edward Anthony 2<br>  <br>  Slayter James 10 (I really like this)<br>  <br>  What about Callum Asher or Asher Callum?|`|U1juqahIaa	Aimee Louisa for a girl and I think Anthony Edward flows much better than Edward Anthony.  Good name though.  I don't like the rest of them.|`|tw1uePBbaa	Girls:<br>  Vienna Grace-5-sounds too much like a place and not a name<br>  <br>  Emmie Wynter-5-like the Wynter part but not Emmie<br>  <br>  Axelle Evolet-2-just too out there for me<br>  <br>  Cadence Harlow-7-very cute<br>  <br>  Aimee Lousia-5cute, but a little too outdated<br>  <br>  Emerson Elaine-7-love emerson, hate the double e thing<br>  <br>  Boys:<br>  <br>  Asher Hendrix-5-sounds like two last names<br>  <br>  Callum Henley-2-callum doesnt sound like a name to me, henley is cute though<br>  <br>  Colby Carter--7-very cute<br>  <br>  Edward Anthony-2-just not a fan<br>  <br>  Slayter James-2-just not a fan, reminds me of saved by the bell|`|HMPdnhApaa	Vienna? Like the sausages? lol  Emmie is best...however I like Emma better. Don't like any of the boy names..|`|x0INaVNqaa	Vienna Grace--its a pretty name, but I personally would prefer Sienna Grace, Vienna makes me think of the city, not a person. I love Grace as a middle name, but not Vienna. <br>  <br>  Emmie Wynter--personally I'm not a fan on using seasons for names and the mispelling of winter isn't that pretty. Emmie is pretty, but it sounds like a nickname from Emily or Emma, and those are both a lot prettier. I just don't think the name is that pretty. <br>  <br>  Axelle Evolet--this name is truly horrible. Axelle reminds me of the nickname my parents call me sometimes, Axel (my name's Alexandra) and  Evolet just looks weird and unpronounceable. Sorry but this is probably one of the worst names. <br>  <br>  Cadence Harlow--I actually like Cadence, but prefer Candace, and the name in general sounds really trendy. Like in five years when your kid's in school, there will be five Cadences. Harlow also sounds very masculine and not pretty.<br>  <br>  Aimee Louisa--it's a pretty name, I just don't really like Aimee, the spelling looks prettier than the Amy spelling, but more childish and I don't really like the name in general. Louisa is pretty though.<br>  <br>  Emerson Elaine--Elaine is pretty, Emerson is not. It doesn't sound like a person's name and if that, it reminds me of a boy, not a girl.<br>  <br>  Asher Hendrix--sounds too trendy and I don't like it. <br>  <br>  Callum Henley--this sounds like it should be the name of a law firm, sorry but these are both last names, and henley is also a type of shirt. I don't like it. <br>  <br>  Colby Carter--Carter's okay, Colby's not a name I care for though.<br>  <br>  Edward Anthony--this name is the best name on your list. It's nice and I love it. Please please please please please use it, it's the only one I have nothing bad to say about it. <br>  <br>  Slayter James--Slayter is should be spelled Slater I think, but overall it reminds me of a serial killer, it just does. Please don't use this, he'll be teased in school and others might also think of a serial killer.|`|w1necKzYaa	sorry don't like any of them!
gq34I1aMaa	motherhood is a beautiful thing. it's a big resposibility, but it's a gift. The love for a child is no stronger than anything else in this world. It's a joy everyday. it's a new person, with their own personality, who can look up to a parent for help and love.  parents uausally do change their ways of thinknig. more being responsible and extra careful around a baby, and more senssitive. a child is a fragile thing and can easily be injured or hurt. HECK IM ONLY FOURTEEN YEARS OLD, AND I CANT WAIT TO HAVE A CHILD lol. but ya ive only gotten parenthood lessons and techniques from parent class in school, movies and from my parents. but i hope u can have a helathy child if u want one one day! lol|`|AA11083066	I'm 35...had my first one at 30.  Your perspective changes.  Everything you thought was important before will be nowhere near as important as it was.  Everyone takes to motherhood differently.  You'll just have to wait and see.  For me, it's exactly what you said, "your main life goal is to care and protect and love your baby".|`|c9NuCZnaaa	I got pregnant at 19 and i'm 21 now. Of course your life changes completely once you become a mother. even when i'm out and about without him i keep thinking about him "oh he needs this" and i sometimes think i hear him when he's not around. or like i need to check on him sleeping when he's gone to his grannys for the weekend. But i still enjoy life. He goes to his grannys every other weekend and i get a chance to go out and enjoy myself. <br>  It's not my MAIN LIFE GOAL to protect and love my baby but it comes naturally. I'm there to support aned raise him and it pretty much just flows. If someone tries to hurt my baby or he gets a bit of stranger anxiety, i'm right at his side and i will always do that.<br>  <br>  Its extremly tough especially being this young. A few of my friends already had kids, and i've made young mummy friends along the way but it's very tiring. I remember not so long ago i'd stay up all the the night drinking beer and partying. Now i wouldnt even dream of it! You really need your sleep!!!! <br>  It's exciting having a baby though. you do new things every day. painting and going out for walks, meeting new people and babies and watching them all grow into little terrors :D<br>  haha<br>  It's going good though. You do get into a routine of things and it gets easier as you go along. You work together almost. It's a beautiful thing. exhausting! but beautiful.|`|PCK5bJt3aa	I was a month away from my 23rd birthday and yes it was difficult to get accustomed to a defenseless baby completely depending on you.But after a short while it is almost like a switch flips in your head and your priorities shift, you become second in everything you do. Yes the choice to be a mother is optional but for my personal experience,motherhood is hardwired in my system. I don't think, I just act its hard to explain until you become a mother. Being a young mother, expect sleepless nights, possible stares from closed minded people, and maybe some economic hardship but above all expect to experience the greatest and most selfless love. I would not change this for the world!|`|yzwbsLAYaa	I thin it really all depends on how much you want to be a mother. If you plan your pregnancy and are all excited and waiting then you are prepared and ready for the things that come next like no more going out whenever you want, waking up at any time to care for your baby, always more woried about letting your baby have everything and not yourself, etc. But some moms that dont plan their pregnancy later on may see it like a burden cuz they werent ready..BUT many of them make it work out and yes your mind and heart changes if you truly are happy to be a mom and dont regret it. I am 21 and have a 1 year old and a 3 year old and I love them sooo much I love being a mommy it is the best thing that ever happened to me ever!|`|fOzV0oHvaa	I'm a young mother who just had her first last month. It's rough, and it took some getting used to, but I love being a mommy. :)<br>  It is the most rewarding thing, and if you're considering whether or not to go through with a pregnancy at a young age, I highly recommend going through with it! It is worth it! You will never love anyone like you do your baby|`|AA11991883	I was 22 with my first child. Everything changes.I gave up a promising career because I fell in love with her she became our main focus.It is damn hard, mothers should tell each other that,its unpaid and sometimes thankless, but it is the most important job in the world. When I look at this 30 yr now.....I did good...I put a good human into the world.|`|z77TERJGaa	I am 21 and my daughter is my life. There's nothing like becoming a parent and striving to give your child the world, protect them, and ensure their happiness. When you become a parent, it's no longer about you...it's all about your child and it's a wonderful feeling. Not always easy but there's nothing else like it.|`|53bd19880b6b3e5a536fb0927f6493d7aa	i'm 24, and my son is almost one (yikes!)<br>  it's going really well for me. I had a lot of issues bonding when he was first born but i can honostly say that I am truly happy and that i have found what i am meant to do with my life. some moms go through a mind shift. i certainly did. I was going to put my baby in the crib and he was going ot be on a strict schedule, I was going to continue to work and my hubby was going to be home with our baby. I was going to breastfeed exclusivley for 6 months and he would be weaned at a year.<br>  The reality: my son still sleeps with us (he's 10 months) and i am still almost exclusivly breastfeeding, he sleeps when he's tired and eats when he's hungry, I quit my business and am more fulfilled than I have ever been!<br>  As for your questions, what is it like? Amazing. Fulfilling, Empowering. Yes that baby relies on you 100% but it's so incredible to be the world to a little someone who unconditionally adores you!
b6EyFLgUaa	Does it just seem like the get stuck and dont move? Try putting them in the wrong way and they may pop out. We have one and my daughter was terrified of it for the longest time.

Also try changing the battery's because the air pressure just might not be enough.<br>  <br>  EDIT- I laugh when ever I see it, Hes a big fat cat and I think she mostly wants to play with him but he just lays there.

Our bodies work in strange ways.  Have you heard the saying, "If you wanna make God laugh, tell him your plans'?  I think this fits in that criteria|`|syrh8J6Vaa	Because you were on birth control your ovulation may have been thrown out of whack.  You probably just ovulated late in your cycle and thats why she is due later.|`|mxVq4mOeaa	whattt!?
VMASMHX6aa	Well, actually you can't ovulate for 3 days!! You can only ovulate at one point in your cycle and that will just happen on one day and the egg is viable for about 12 hours after ovulation.<br>  <br>  Seeing as you got positives for a few days, it's hard to know exactly. I'd say you probably ovulated on the day of your final positive so that would be Saturday.|`|ARccSWfkaa	All three days would be ovulation days.|`|kLoICJJjaa	i agree with commenter #1|`|3rv5mjfeaa	That is a stupid question, dumb *****.|`|8uiH6iRbaa	yep #1 has got it.<br>  <br>  it would be best to cover all 3 days but you cannot be exact on the particular day you ovulate x

l4mMBe5Aaa	Well, the thought of eating a jar of mushed up salmon and sweet potatoes makes me want to throw up, so I guess that's a possibility!  Ha.  <br>  Has she had salmon before?  And all of the other ingredients in the baby food?  Our daughter throws up when she eats mandarin oranges - not sure why, but maybe it's the acidity of the fruit...  This baby food has lemon juice in it - could it be that?  <br>  If she's had all of the ingredients on their own without incident before, then she's probably just sick.<br>  Best of luck!|`|uCnmYEPBaa	Why is your toddler eating baby food?<br>  She should be on table food by now.|`|AA10708106	most toddlers don't have an appetite when they have a cold.It could be the salmon but a cold with drainage and a cough will stimulate the gag reflex and will cause vomiting.Just make sure she get lots of fluids and give her fruits until her tummy settles down.If she isn't better in a couple of days she certainly should be seen by her pediatrician.You always worry about dehydration in toddlers when they vomit.No more salmon|`|2Hhbz16maa	It sounds like an odd combination to me. Salmon and Sweet Potatoes. Sound really nasty lol. I think I'd throw up too. Her tummy probably says get that out! Also some foods will make a cold worse such as milk so it could be that. When my little one is sick I take her off milk products until she clears up a bit.|`|58YiE4pFaa	the best thing anyone can do is check with the doctor. but otherwise, i'd say its the salmon... for now, treat her like you'd treat any stomach flu and cold.|`|P1xlrvAaaa	I have never heard of baby food being of a fish flavor,are you sure?You aren't supposed to give a baby a few things until after 1 year of age bc it can trigger a very serious allergic reaction these are the things to avoid.<br>  -eggs<br>  -fish<br>  -peanuts<br>  -nuts<br>  -peanut butter<br>  -strawberries<br>  that is why I find it so odd that there is a baby food with a fish flavor.I would say if that is the case that can definitely be the cause.Good luck and I hope this helps.
S1t4e9E0aa	sperm can live up to 5 days in a womans vagina and a +opk means ull be ovualating between 12 to 36 hours , so yea it can result in pregnancy.<br>  thanks for answering my question i need the advice , i hope af doesnt show <br>  baby dust to both of us and all ttc ladies out there|`|qHa4w8eyaa	I believe so. A positive OPK suggests that you will ovulate within 24 to 36 hours. Since sperm can last upto 5 days in a woman's body, chances are that many will still be alive and well by the time you are due to ovulate.  I'd say your chances are good....best of luck!|`|FBhjhjR0aa	Of course. Any time you have intercourse, there is a 50/50 chance of getting pregnant. It really only takes that one time for it to happen.

AA12221556	I did.  My son eat so much.  He wasn't content w/ his formula.  So I added a tablespoon of cereal in his bottle.<br>  <br>  If you do just pay close attention to how he sleeps, eats & poops.  If he begans to act constipated or upset you know he's not ready for it.|`|ZKxgqK3zaa	I tried it but that is not ever going to happen again. It is too binding for the baby and her little intestines aren't ready for that yet.

Read some parenting books.|`|MW18liqTaa	Absolutely Not. The only thing my child is getting is breastmilk until he is 6 months old, when he is READY for cereal.|`|15uqPesKaa	no|`|fa60257b056e6393028d193602d295a6aa	no.  that's way too young.  4 months old is the earliest doctors recommend.  Nutritionally, breast milk or formula is sufficient until 6 months of age.|`|JnLoHaoAaa	No I didn't give cereal to my daughter when she was 2 months old|`|voj4H6Fpaa	no, absolutely not. you should not give a baby cereal under 4 months of age. they are not ready for it. their digestive systems are not mature enough to handle it. plus, baby's need to learn to eat cereal from a spoon, not a bottle. if you are giving it to your child to help them sleep longer at night, there is some reasearch that says that is just a myth, and does not work.|`|Siaf4gd3aa	No! We waited until 4 months, when our doctor<br>   recommended it!|`|ANHsv4ENaa	Not a good idea. A baby's digestive system should have six months to develop before you give any solids.|`|aLAmvX5Naa	Nope. Babies can't handle solids that young.|`|cv0foxlTaa	No, I waited until 5.5 months.  I found there was conflicting advice on whether you should start babies on rice cereal at 4 or 6 months, but I never heard that you should do it sooner than 4 months; I choose to wait until closer to the 6 month mark.  I don't believe that a 2 month old would have the digestive capability for solid foods...  breast milk or formula is all a baby needs for the first 4-6 months of life.<br>  <br>  P.S.  Babies should only take cereal from a spoon, never from a bottle.  I don't think a 2 month old would be able to eat from a spoon.<br>  <br>  That all being said, I was reading through my own baby book the other day and my mom started me on Pablum at 8 weeks, at the advice of her doctor.  I guess times have changed.|`|fd34d7830f1987fa091fa8de50613944aa	No, it is not normally recommended to give cereal to babies at that age.|`|QOvUS6xVaa	yes i did my son was having it in his bottle due to excessive spitting up at the direction of his doctor, <br>  <br>   and here come the thumbs down from the moms who don't like to be told how to raise their kids yet judge others who do|`|bebee00e4f3a4e5d156594de8d4a527eaa	Uh... No. They really do not need anything what so ever besides breast milk or formula at that age... I really hope you didn't give her cereal. I mean what is she going to chew with? Baby dentures?

My aunt said her pressure was slightly elevated for the first year after she gave birth and then she was able to slowly wean herself off of the meds.  No problems before giving birth.  Like most African Americans, high blood pressure runs in the family but is not life threatening if supervised so it's possible she would have inevitably gotten it, but she thinks that becayse she was pretty young, just like yourself, and relatively fit she couldn't think of anything other than it being related to her pregnancy.|`|wiAVa1H5aa	You can have pre-eclampsia after delivery, did they check for that?|`|AA11991883	Yes, after my 2nd pregnancy I developed hbp-it was a normal birth but it was a c-sec.PLEASE check your bp regularly. I was always 100lbs. but found the weight harder to takeoff after my 2nd child and I stayed at 140 on a small frame..I stroked because of the hbp in 2007.Check your pressure a.m. and p.m. Watch your diet-especially salt,and if one medication is not working you need to request a 2nd one. I am sorry you cannot breast feed it was a wonderful experience,but give your baby a healthy mother that is most important. If at all possible avoid stress...the hardest to do sometimes.

I don't mind Easton but I dislike Patrick. I personally prefer more modern names. Each to their own though I guess.<br>  <br>  Out of the girls I love them all. Lennox is definitely my favourite though.|`|A9NBtUy6aa	Easton James is quite cute.. in fact so is Easton Patrick... or Drake Christopher... I like Easton Patrick myself.<br>  <br>  Don't like Lennox... love Maisy, Elyse and Ava... From those my favourite is Camden Elyse, but i would call her Nolee Mikole or Maisy Elyse :)|`|uzasBsL8aa	mitchell jayden, drake francis, i like maisy and nolee kinda, but i'm not so fond of the rest|`|n2toGLaYaa	Mitchell & Maisy are my favorites.

Theres a boy in my class, called Mitch, and all the time the kids call him "B*tch" its awful, but the kids wont stop. Out of the girls names, I LOVE Maisy, but I don't like Mikole... I love Nolee Blair, very cute. I love Lennox Ava, but I like Ava more than Lennox. But I hate Camden. I used to know this girl whose name was camden and all the boys called her "Condom" it was really embarassing for her... But I like the middle name Elyse.|`|Tjr9aObNaa	Patrick is the best from the boys although i dont really rate any of them.<br>  Maisy Ava would be better than any of those.|`|cp7fjeJhaa	hey there, yay i love talking about baby names!!  ok let's see....<br>  <br>  I like all of the boys name, what about mixing and matching them like<br>  <br>  Mitchell Drake<br>  Mitchell Easton<br>  Mitchell Patrick<br>  <br>  Drake Mitchell<br>  Drake Easton<br>  <br>  I dont like Drake Patrick cause it sorta rhymns together<br>  <br>  I think I like Drake the best though, followed by Easton, Mitchell then Patrick.<br>  <br>  Ok girls names:  I like them all, however, I dont care for Mikole for a middle name (no offense intended)<br>  <br>  I love Maisy, you can also spell it Maisie too<br>  <br>  Maisy Rose<br>  Maisy Elizabeth<br>  Maisy Corinne<br>  Maisy Heather<br>  Maisy Isabelle<br>  Maisy Jolene<br>  Maisy Nicole<br>  Maisy Renee<br>  Maisy Christine<br>  Maisy Kayla<br>  <br>  I like your other names, however, Camden is a really icky town in new jersey....dont know if you care about that.......maybe spell it Camdyn or what about Camryn......|`|8gWftZQpaa	Patrick Ethan...Drake Elijah....Drake Micah......I love Nolee Blair...sounds cute & cuddly....|`|gl4DFLVGaa	All cute but I dont like Easton or Lennox.

SnQvsOPwaa	Get your degree and then go. Your old enough to do what you want. Just make sure you finish your education first. Africa will still be there.|`|0vLU2GGGaa	i think if you are an adult, you have the right to make your own choice.  For some parents, especially Asian, they just want their kids to have a "normal" life, do "normal" things (as you said, find a good job and get married and have kids), and be around them the rest of their life, i understand, because i am Asian too.<br>  <br>  I will suggest that you make your plan clear to them, let them know you have your mind set and no matter they like it or not.  I think when time pass and they realize what a wonderful thing you been doing, they will accept it.|`|KVrEhZjtaa	Your 20!<br>  You should move out of the house you have to be in by 8. <br>  thats crazy. im well younger than you and my curfew isn't that early.|`|M2yERqNSaa	so why do you care what your parents say ? your 20 yrs old go and stop being a cry baby
LfqpBjSfaa	I always do.  It would be rude otherwise.  I don't want vwayward carts hitting my car, or taking up a parking space.|`|jG8b3Mz0aa	I do sometimes. If the cart rack isn't very far away I'll usually jot over very quickly. If I'm cranky, the kids are cranky, or I'm unloading a lot of stuff I'll just leave it in front of my car. I admit it.|`|YYLzML9gaa	no i do not|`|AA11083066	I actually try to park right next to them or as close as I can to one.  If I can't (I have three kids, 5, 2, and 9 wks)  I lock them in and run and put it in the cart corral.  I know people will say that's bad, but, I think it's safer than having to try and hold a carrier and two little hands and the keys.  There are too many people (in and out of their cars) that do not pay attention to their surroundings in a parking lot.|`|YpN50jFDaa	I always do..

FmC1TGm5aa	Awwww! As the other posters have said, totally normal. It will change quickly when she gains control over her arms and hands. In the mean time you can move the toys to her mouth and away (like they're flying) while making sound affects or singing. My Genevieve just loves that! <br>  <br>  I just LOVE the name Simone, btw!|`|voj4H6Fpaa	my son would get frustrated too as he learned to gain better control over his limbs and movements. he continues to be that way with learning to roll over, crawl, etc. i think it is normal. the only way they can express frustration is through crying at this age|`|aJLx0nhNaa	No it's normal.  I think their ability to desire something proceeds their ability to actually get it.  That makes a kind of sense - why else would they keep trying?<br>  <br>  It was very frustrating to my son to try and grab things or get them in his mouth, but this is what compelled him to keep trying and learn.  Now, of course, we can't keep anything out of his mouth.|`|2932ee4950edd4f131a711d029cc8528aa	my son was like that until he figured out how to get the toys to his mouth. i think its normal.
S4DNQkFraa	Not likely, but it can happen. Chances are slim tho.|`|CtUVT49Gaa	Extremely likely...|`|CuTvFlxTaa	The affect of the hormone starts as soon as you take an injection and if you are regular in your menstrual cycle, the chances of getting pregnant are very rare. Some drugs, such as those taken for Cushing’s syndrome, may lessen the effects of this contraceptive. Do tell your doctor about all the medications you are taking and use a secondary contraception if advised. <br>  <br>  <br>  During this time, it is also important for you to check for pregnancy, as receiving depo provera while pregnant may cause premature birth. <br>  <br>  <br>  Very slim chance. In total I have been on this for 4 years of my life and never got pregnant.|`|7add460ae24c9452ae87b5a99c5aa756aa	Not very likely according to them...<br>  But I gotta tell you. I have like 4 friends who all got preggers on the shot.  All were high risk, and had awful pregnancies. I dont like the shot for this reason.  You never get your rag, therefore never even know if you might be pregnant!|`|mqHL4UcRaa	You have a 97- 99.7% chance that you WONT get pregnant. So its very unlikely.|`|Q2OP7SOtaa	1% as its 99% effective.

If you just heard about your state it wouldn't be as often plus every child the has killed some one is going to be highlighted and famous its just the beast. I think the kids now days just have more excuses for doing it and get away with it. Oh video games made me do it, movies made me do it. No you picked up the gun, you shot that person and unless you are very mentally ill you know that shooting some one will if not kill them hurt them.|`|ajEuk4MTaa	It has nothing to do with media, and everything to do with parenting.<br>  <br>  Imagine what a kid from the dark ages would be witness to...

Video Gaming and T.V.<br>  Children become addicted to Video Gaming and T.V.<br>  It is really like drug addiction. They get hooked and live in the world of gaming. Gaming becomes their identity.<br>  I like many parents over looked this. My neighbours son, went missing after his parents took away his Xbox 360 on Thanksgiving day here in Canada. Brandon had become addicted to the game Call of Duty 4 Modern Warfare.<br>  He missed a day from school sneaking home, when his parents were at work to play the game. His parents took the game away, he found it and got caught playing it when it was grounded. <br>  So it was then taken out of the house for good. His parents did not know they had just taken away his whole world and his indentity. Brandon ran away that afternoon and searchers looked for him for 3 weeks. His body was found by hunters in a wooded area a few miles from his home. He had fallen from a tree, we think he climbed it trying to see the lights of the town and find his way back home.<br>  Sadly, Brandon is just one of many that have been addicted. Parents should all read about Brandon. Type in Brandon Crisp Barrie Ontario Canada on your computer.<br>  Read the sad story and look at Brandon's picture. Now decide if this beautiful child, who was so addicted died for a reason. The reason we think,  was to bring to every parent the seriousness of Video Gaming addictions.<br>  ( Connie Mom of 4 and 5th. Grade Teacher Barrie Ontario Canada )|`|723QHuicaa	I read a story on Y!

Pregnancy hormones cause your esophagus to relax, and that happens to a lot of women during pregnancy, it's unrelated. It probably will cause you some heartburn though.|`|UaL28atDaa	Heres a couple of good videos I think you will find useful. The first is explaining about morning sickness and when to expect it.

You could be well on your way to full blown out morning sickness or this is all you will get (cross your fingers :) )  Good Luck|`|tcHkn0VIaa	it is usually around 6 weeks but every pregnancy is different- and some effects are worse than others. I hope yours is not too bad. Best of luck|`|tkpBDLwYaa	At four weeks, I think what you are experiencing is a little indigestion.  Morning sickness is different for every woman, and different for every pregnancy.  Some women experience none at all, some have only slight nausea, some vomit constantly for nine months. What you are experiencing now may only be indigestion, maybe some nerves, but certainly not an indication of what you can or should expect in the months to come.  Most women don't even know they're pregnant at four weeks, so don't upset yourself further or over-react by thinking what may be a perfectly normal occurrence is out of the ordinary.  Knowing you are pregnant at four weeks, have you changed your diet in any way?  That could be part of what you're experiencing.<br>  <br>  I hate to say it, but if you do have any morning sickness as your pregnancy progresses, you'll know it and there's not a whole lot you can do about it.  Should that occur, some people swear by soda crackers and a cola soft drink. For me, it was oatmeal.  <br>  <br>  Best of luck to you!|`|ddYu1rrYaa	. First off congrats!!!I don't think this is morning sickness. I am a mother of two and when that has happened it is usually just indigestion. are you eating or drinking citrus or anything acidic or spicy? morning sickness although different for everyone usually is triggered by a smell, taste, even eating or brushing teeth or just the thought of these things try using tums (good for the calcium too) or something simillar to see if that helps. Heartburn and indegestion get worse as the baby grows so keep what your eating in mind!|`|9KpidWBEaa	with my first baby started getting morning sickness at about 6 weeks and then it lasted the rest of my pregnancy.  It started out how you described it then turned into violent vomiting and nausea.  Pray and pray hard that that is all you get, it could possibly be the worst part of being pregnant worse than labor!
vKmzcZZvaa	I'm partial to Urethra myself, but if I had to choose one of those, I'd go with Jazzlynn, but change the "a" to an "i" and make it Jizzlyn.

wzM5WB8Xaa	I am a parent, and I agree with you that pagents are probably not intended for kids who are overweight. It is the type of social situation that could lead the child to a future eating disorder. However, her mom likely doesn't see it like that. If you ask 99% of moms who the most beautiful girl in the room is, she will likely say that it's her own. Parents are often blind to their own childrens' imperfections. Therefore, even if everyone else saw an overweight girl who probably did not fit into the pagent world, her mom likely just saw her beautiful little daughter who has a great talent and could beat all of those other little girls.|`|thier1XYaa	Well a lot of moms want the money that you get from pageants and so they put them in pageants then they get older and they don't take care of themselves but the moms still want the money and the girls like to feel good about getting money, but she could also just want to do pageants.|`|bebee00e4f3a4e5d156594de8d4a527eaa	Did you ever think that maybe the little girl wanted to be in the pageant? And this particular parent wasn't trying to fulfill her dreams through her child. The pageants should be for the children,not for fame seeking parents.|`|ZcrsqMbcaa	if you people are insulted by this question its only because your kids are fed cookies and not hugged enough. And youre morbidly obese yourselves. Fat is repulsive unattractive unhealthy...join a gym and stop the glutony|`|AA12080472	shallow as in "like you".  only a shallow person would even notice it.|`|5f6XnInEaa	Um, maybe the girl wanted to be in the pageant?<br>  <br>  It is people like you you will continue to keep the low self esteem wheel turning with your ignorant comments.<br>  <br>  Any girl, of any age, and of any size should be able to go into whatever pageant she wants to, and frankly I find it sad that someone that is supposed to be an adult is complaining about chunky children.|`|Zyhe3GvXaa	you are horrible its not your kid why does it matter to you and i saw that episode of toddlers & tiaras and she was not that big like you are saying and if she is chubby and wants to be in a pageant she must has a lot of confidence and i saw it a nd she was very confident|`|2osuEr0naa	I get what you're saying. I do agree with you that they shouldn't have pageants for kids. But I 100 percent disagree with you with the whole 12 year old being chunky. Maybe she wanted to be in a pageant. Your the reason why kids who are over weight are so insecure with themselves. A lot of young kids are not always "FIT" a lot of them have that baby fat still. And a lot of them grow out of it. I don't know why you posted this, and it shouldn't matter to you|`|7g3IWCBvaa	Personally I think that was wrong<br>  now i understand if the 12 year old didn't want to go in<br>  the pageant thing, but if they wanted to be in it I don't think<br>  it's wrong to be a lil big and want to try to do something like the pageant i think thats wrong..<br>  If I had a kid and it was big in area i would let her do it if she wanted too and i would support her decision it doesn't matter what you look like..<br>  I just hate the way you thought about those girls that are chunky<br>  thats just disgraceful too me..|`|SlBsJ3NRaa	It's so nice that being thin is one of the most important factors in determining beauty, especially coming from a mother. Here's a question for you, do you think a child should enter a beauty contest if she has a thin/normal body but an ugly face? Would you be as upset if someone was ugly and thin as opposed to fat and pretty and entered a pageant? This is why we have so many 8, 9 10 year old anorexics and bulimics, because hey hear heavy equals ugly. Shame on you for your way of thinking.|`|ex53YwSuaa	The mom was probably trying to make her daughter feel more beautiful by putting her among the crowd....of course, that really isn't the best way to do it. Putting her daughter in probably made her daughter feel horrible once looking at the competition...but maybe that was another motive of the mom's? <br>  The mom either could have:<br>  1. Put her daughter in to make her feel like she was "like the crowd".<br>  2. Put her daughter in to make her daughter realize that everyone else is healthy, and that she needs to lose weight. Fast.<br>  <br>  ...Either way, this girl is sure going to lose weight after being through THAT horror!|`|p68DUZhCaa	yea i agree with you. the parent is pretty much setting her daughter up for humiliation and disappointment for the rest of her life. i mean why not put her into something productive and beneficial like a sport? as for the negative comments your getting, WE CANNOT CHANGE SOCIETY! being fat is perceived as ugly and we all know it. the girl was bond to lose. it may be insulting but its true, trust me i would know threw personal experience. either way the mother should have been smarted and not have traumatized her child.|`|ANHsv4ENaa	I honestly think parents who have the stomach to do that to their children are suffering from a mental illness. I believe a lot of them would benefit from some serious counseling sessions and a reality check. So I guess my answer is they are already crazy. Really. It doesn't have to make sense for them to put their daughters through that, they don't see reality as it is and just want their kid to win. It doesn't matter if they don't have a chance or if they don't want to, the attitude is my kid is better and I will prove it come hell or high water. Or some chub.
qImMwhUHaa	That's a good question. My four year old still doesn't wipe properly. He tries but still hasn't mastered it but I always let him do it first before I come in there and "check". He's learned that he doesn't like poop on his hands so he used extra toilet paper. He'll get it soon enough.|`|rGci1ehoaa	i am going through the same thing with my son and have tried everything he REFUSES to do it. dont listen to the people telling you it is too early my daughter has been wiping her own butt since she was 2!! I have ignored him when i have heard him welling for me to wipe his own butt.. it doesnt work.. however when my mom was visiting she told him i left the house and he needed to wipe it himself.. then he did!! kids can be little shits lol no pun  intended... if you find the answer please let me know we have tried everything.. sticker charts.. prizes... bribes lol|`|z7SJaMwuaa	CHILL your son is only 3 and a half why does he got to wipe his own butt? My little sister is 5 and she doesn't wipe herself.<br>  Actually its too early to start teaching him that its too soon.<br>  Start when hes 5 I don't know anybody in my family that wiped their own butt at 3 and a half. It took me till age 7 and look at me I am a great success lmao|`|2T9RXxNTaa	my son is 3 1/2 and were going through the same thing. just be perststant, but not harsh. make it a game, you do it first then get him to do it afterwards. tell him its a game it might sound crude but tell him that whoever gets the least amount of mess on the tissue wins a treat (a game of his choice, dvd of his choice or a healthy snack). good luck hun :)|`|7W3iEtW8aa	Hold his hand in yours and help guide him through it.  yes there will be poop one both of your hands at first, but it will help him.|`|9KpidWBEaa	My daughter hated wiping herself but we just talk abut it being "nasty not to wipe" and eventually she started but i always go behind her and wipe again just to make sure she is doing a good job.  also try throwing in some reward for doing it on his own.  get him his favorite fruit snacks and tell him if he's a big boy and wipes himself he can have a  snack or something.  positive reinforcement works sometimes with little kids.|`|LjO374MDaa	Find a book, a catchy song, and just encourage him.|`|AA10708106	one of my son's and one of my nephews was the same way.if you don't wipe him and his butt itches he will eventually do it.Get him some good smelling wet wipes that are biodegradable and he can throw in the commode.also if you raise heck with him he'll never stop.Just say oh well I guess if you want to get it wiped then I guess you'll have to do it.Never let him know it upsets you.
KICQQxLxaa	OK, first of all, stop trolling around.<br>  <br>  Just 3 days ago you just found out you were pregnant, then you wanted 3-4 kids but didn't want to start trying for 1-2 years.<br>  You are not pregnant, and not having twins...you just want attention.<br>  <br>  Oh, and I have some names for you.<br>  Trollie and Trolletta|`|UC9Wjjscaa	I have always thought that while they are little dressing them the same is super cute.  I like the idea of the names being similar but not rhyming.  If I had twins they would definitely be dressed the same atleast until they were one.  Congratulations and good luck.|`|oA8Rtyxuaa	I am a nanny for twins and here are my personal opinions about that...<br>  <br>  Dressing them the same is cute BUT I would suggest only buying a few matching outfits for special occasions or if guests are coming over. Reason being, its cheaper. With twins, saving money in any way is a good thing!!<br>  <br>  Names...basically i think anything goes, just try not to make them so similar that you confuse the heck out of everyone, if they are identical that is confusing enough for teachers and stuff! <br>  <br>  Congrats!! Best of luck to you! :)|`|rUPjr7hjaa	I don't think it's weird to dress them the same as long as they're little.  Once they start school it's time to dress them different.  When it comes that time, ask them what they want.  If they want to dress the same then fine :)<br>  Rhyming names for twins is a pet peeve of mine!  The first letter being the same is alright.<br>  Good luck!!|`|723QHuicaa	Its weird if one is a boy and one is a girl, and both are wearing dresses.<br>  <br>  Aside from that, no, I think its kinda cute.|`|hDnX6Vx6aa	If i had twins i would ALWAYS dress them the same and i would give them rhyming names. That's just me though. I think it is so cute.|`|a508777527beb8fd9a3a41166b16dccdaa	My twin is a boy, our names don't match...my mom used to dress me especially in the summer with similar clothes as my brother and sometimes even boy clothes that looked unisex (shorts or t-shirts)...I also have twin cousins their names also don't match but since they are both boys my aunt and uncle dressed them alike until they decided not to anymore...|`|kxSz1PYmaa	My twins are 3 weeks old today!!!  It is funny...we get comments from everybody if we DONT dress them alike.  I have similar outfits usually a different color for each and they do look adorable when they are dressed alike.  Our boys names also start with the same letter, but they dont rhyme.  Do you know what you are having yet?  Our boys are Brady & Bryce.  Good luck and enjoy!!!|`|VwaFM0L8aa	Don't always dress them alike. It is cute to do it sometimes. Maybe same clothes just diff colors. I think its cute when they have names with the same first letters. Good luck.<br>  Boy's or Girls?
tCsFxh5Aaa	Some project ideas that we did at this age:<br>  Planting a variety of seeds and taking care of them. <br>  Collecting seeds from foods eaten and making a poster of them to compare different sorts of seeds.<br>  Making papier mache crafts with newspaper and watered down glue, then painting it.<br>  Making a variety of simple crafts--making soaps and beeswax candles, making bowls out of beads that you melt and form into a bowl, making coasters out of beads that you iron together, "sewing" with yarn and a large, dull needle around shapes cut out of light cardboard that I punched holes into, making things from playdough or from salt dough that you can let dry and then paint, finger painting, baking, shaping and decorating cookies, making lapbook projects (google "lapbooks" to find ideas on these) on topics we were reading about, lots of cutting and pasting, lots of coloring and painting, stringing beads or noodles onto yarn, etc.<br>  Learning new songs (especially ones that teach something, such as a song for the days of the week and one for the months of the year).<br>  Making a cassette tape together that had a mixture of his favorite songs and stories with counting by 2's or 10's, some new songs, a story he made up, some Bible verses or famous sayings, and anything else that you think could be good for him to learn; it takes a long time to make, if you fill up both sides of a cassette tape (and you'll repeat a lot of songs and such to help him really learn them and to fill up the tape); then you'll have something he'll enjoy listening to when bored (and he'll learn something from).<br>  We made posters for things that he was learning about (say gluing pieces of rice, 10 in a circle, and numbering how many glued so far, to help him learn the idea of counting by 10's; or listing basic types of animals and then cutting out pictures of animals and deciding if they get glued into the mammal or bird or insect section; etc.).<br>  Read about pirates and then make a simple map of the backyard and hide a "treasure" in it; have him use the map (with hints of "getting warmer" if getting closer or "getting colder" if getting too far way) to find the treasure.<br>  Read about knights and castles and show him how to use his toys to play act that they are knights in a castle, or have him try to draw a knight fighting a dragon, or ride his bike around pretending that he's a knight preparing to fight to save the fair princess.<br>  Read about fossils and then make a container with some dirt or sand in it, with a few things hidden in it to be pretend "fossils" and have him do his own fossil dig; then spend time on walks looking for fossils in the rocks and such encountered along the way.<br>  <br>  <br>  BUT, it sounds like you are making sure that he gets lots of interaction and new things to think about and do.  As long as you are regularly introducing him to new ideas and such (keeping his brain engaged), *you* are doing enough.<br>  <br>  Sometimes, you have to let them be bored for a while.  They have to learn to entertain themselves--not to depend completely on you or other people for 100% of their entertainment, otherwise, they'll grow up to be bored, dissatisfied people.  So, make sure that there are things around the house that he can play with or investigate.  And then let him spend time being bored, until he figures out something that he can do to entertain himself.  If his behavior gets unbearable, then you explain that the behavior is unacceptable and put him in time out, or better yet, give him some chores to do.  (In fact, make sure that he is regularly doing some kind of chores at this age.  He's old enough to help sort laundry, pick up his toys, help with dusting, sweeping or cleaning up simple messes, help weed the garden, maybe even start to take out the trash.  The responsibility involved will help his attitude and help you tremendously when the baby comes.)<br>  If he learns that being bored and acting cranky means mom gives him work to do, he'll soon learn to play more on his own (as long as he gets a reasonable amount of attention on a regular basis).  (Especially if mom clearly explains this to him a few times as she assigns work.  Particularly if it is work that he doesn't care to do.)<br>  <br>  Good luck.|`|DKqsFGymaa	It sounds like you do enough activities with him.  He should also be taught to play by himself.<br>  <br>  Does he have hotwheels, with tracks, that he can set up.  Or a train to set up and play an imagination game with.<br>  <br>  Also, my daycare kids love "Magic Putty".  Similar to play-dough, but more like slime.|`|KyFCYs0Yaa	Maybe the answer isn't in finding more things to do with him, as it sounds like you do a LOT with him already! Maybe you and your husband could sit down and discuss how to teach him to be happy during down time. In preschool i don't think it is going to be constant activity all of the time. If he is anything like my son (same age) He will do anything if you tell him he is going to have to learn how to go to school! <br>  Hope that is at least a little helpful!|`|Q6Bzggmpaa	Hello, I have a girl who has just turned four and I find it easier if she is busy too. I try to get her to do things in the kitchen - sometimes just helping me do dinner and occasionally I let her make biscuit dough and leave her to her own devices with a rolling pin and some shapes, sometimes icing pens, jam , cherries etc. If I don't have much time to do it with her I literally shove a bit of flour, egg, sugar and butter in a bowl and let her mix it together herself. I do all the oven bit but apart from that it's just up to her to get 'creative' (and messy - big plastic sheet recommended!) <br>  Also, I have recently got my daughter a hamster and it occupies her for quite a lot of the time. Of course, a certain amount of observation is needed at first! and it takes a little while for them to learn to be gentle. I have to say that as far as pets go they seem to be really easy to look after - no obvious smells, quick to clean out, very sociable, and cheap to keep -unless you get one of those fancy tube cages that my daughter is hankering for! Hope this helps!
AA10624857	I am mom to 4 children. With my older 3, whenever they had ear infections the pediatrician would prescribe antibiotics. Each one had numerous ear infections with my third daughter having quite a lot of them. However, when my youngest came along, there was some research that showed that many ear infections were actually caused by a virus and that antibiotics didn't actually make the ear infection clear up any faster. There was also talk about "super" viruses that were developing as the result of over-use of antibiotics. My youngest didn't have her first ear infection until she was 2. I had a different doctor then and she wrote me a prescription for an antibiotic but encouraged me to give the ear infection a couple days to get better on it's own. So, I gave my daughter acetimenophen for her ear pain, gave her plenty of fluids, let her use a hot water bottle to rest her sore ear on and it was true that within 48 hours she was feeling much better. So, I didn't fill the antibiotic, but I had it in case I felt she needed it. That doctor has since moved away, but I loved her for the approach she had of letting me make many decisions on my own. My daughter ended up with only 1 other ear infection, which once again we waited on the antibiotic and it went away without it. I do think there are ear infections caused by bacteria that need the antibiotic, but there are also virus induced ear infections that don't. I like the idea of getting the diagnosis then taking the "wait and see" approach before using the antibiotic. I've not heard of antibiotics leading to asthma.|`|a1x0xqARaa	My son also had his share of ear infections as a baby, got antibiotics and healed nicely.  He is now 7 years old and is perfectly healthy.  Has no signs of asthma.  I urge you to get the medicine.  Good luck.|`|Wb9oqcWDaa	I am for the antibiotics if the ear infection is bad enough.  If it gets to bad it can rupture the ear drum and cause more pain and problems for your baby.  My son gets them all the time and now is eligible for tubes in his ears which we will probably do so we can forfeit the antibiotics.  If your baby gets them all the time and they continue to give you antibiotics I would ask them what the qualifications are for tubes or whatever so you don't have to do antibiotics andmore.
NoUkTQCgaa	Congrats, Lauren! I just met my n family last October. It is an overwhelming and awesome thing, isn't it? I feel really close to my n brothers, too.

MLFBsZnUaa	Well, when my husband had to get a dna test for his youngest daughter (lol he knew she was his...but the mother kept telling him she wasnt, just to spite him)...it took maybe like week between the 1st court date n when the test was done. It was maybe another week or two until the results were mailed from court and another court date was given. Which then it was about a month until that court hearing came. But, it could take less for you, it all depends on how your court runs and how quickly they work. But, rest assured...the father will be obligated to pay back support from the day your originally filed for support. So one way or another, you will get that money. Good luck!|`|z77TERJGaa	It depends on the priority of the test, as to how long it can take.  Most test results are in within 48-72 hours of the day the test is given.  And once the test proves he is the father then he will have to pay child support from the day the baby was born and until the day he turns 18.  Good Luck!
6G14WPhQaa	It sounds entirely possible that you are pregnant.  Supposing you have a 28 day cycle, you would already be late.  However, given the information you gave, if you are pregnant, it is more likely that you are farther along than you would think.  A lot of women don't know they are pregnant until they are around 8 weeks or so.  My mom had regular 'periods' until she was about 5-6 months pregnant.  She had no clue she was pregnant.  My pregnancy symptoms started early (at 6 weeks).  This only gave me a week to get used to the idea of pregnancy before I was blasted with morning sickness, lower back pain, sore breasts, and fatigue.  My suggestion to you is if you have these symptoms, either get a couple HPT's from the dollarama, or buy a double pack of whatever brand HPT you trust.  Take one now, and then take the other in about a week.  You may originally get a negative, but it's always a smart idea to do another test about a week later if you are still having symptoms.<br>  <br>  Good luck to you!|`|tcHkn0VIaa	If you want to be pregnant it is easy for your mind to give you the symptoms however since you have been having sex every weekend there is a great possibility that you were ovulating at the time of intercourse and you may be pregnant. There are home pregnancy tests which can tell if you are pregnant up to 5 days before your missed period but that is not always 100% there can be false negatives but not false positives so if it is a BFP then it is time to find a dr.|`|plI0WOrUaa	You very well could be!!  It kind of sounds like it.  I had that feeling too when i got pregnant.  I had very tender, really abnormally heavy breasts, no implantation bleeding (not everyone gets that), was dizzy in the morning, and i was bloated like crazy.  My clothes were even tight that's how bloated I was.  You could take an early pregnancy test now.  I used a first response like 5 days before my period.  I tested first thing in the morning and got a positive.  Good luck!|`|Q05rrSX4aa	Sounds like you are pregnant....but.....those could also be period signs.  The throwing up thing makes me think it could be pregnancy related, but usually those symptoms don't kick in right away.  I would take a test to find out for sure.  I don't want to get your hopes up though, I get pregnancy symptoms every month (ttc) and I get my period.|`|sVPToYvKaa	The obvious thing to do is take a pregnancy test, but since you are already having COMMON "prego" symptoms, then I would say go to a hosptial or free clinic and get a blood test. This is MORE accurate.<br>  <br>  It seems to me like you are.<br>  <br>  Pregnancy is a beautiful thing <3 Don't be nervous!|`|0eg3rLPUaa	it does sound like your pregnant. my early pregnancy symptoms were. . lower backaches, nausea, sore/tender breasts, i ate alot more and i was moody|`|A0tWlG94aa	you could be...wait for your period and if you dont get it then just take a test<br>  <br>  good luck|`|mqHL4UcRaa	Bloating, breakouts, irretibility, and backaches are signs of either PMS or pregnancy. The nausea is what makes me believe you may be pregnant. It's been about 3 weeks since you had the unprotected sex that you could have conceived from, so the nausea may be striking you right about now. I didnt have it until I was 6 weeks. It's called "morning sickness" but it occurs morning, day, and night. It's not a specified time. Typically women feel worse in the mornings because they have less food in their stomachs. <br>  <br>  You wont gain much weight in early pregnancy. And only 20% of pregnant women notice implantation bleeding (I didnt have any). <br>  <br>  I had a feeling I was pregnant before the missed period. We had unprotected sex many times and thats how you conceive. The 1st early signs of pregnancy I had were sore/swollen breasts that felt like needles were stabbing them if barely touched, period-like cramping, and fatigue.|`|Q2OP7SOtaa	Take a test, You may find you have talked tourself into feeling pregnant with stress. the only way to know is either wait and see if you have a baby or do a test? <br>  <br>  when i was pregnant i went off some foods, i had a heightened sense of smell and in the first 12 weeks lost weight before steadilly gaining.<br>  <br>  Whatever happens hope its what you want xx|`|XpqQvQsgaa	im 13 and i fill the same way go to this web site it will explain more www.webmd.com i hope u have good luck.|`|H2IhRXIIaa	Of course you can be pregnant! They say if you have a normal 28 day cycle then you ovulate around the 14th day..And that you should start trying on the 9th day after your lmp. Well that is NOT always true. I was on the pill and had a normal 28 day cycle with my periods only lasting 4 days. Well I ovulated very late, like on the 17th day of my cycle so I got preg then. So really besides maybe going to the doctor or taking a test theres no for sure way to tell.|`|2674548b6a4c9cdbb098044c58c7af7aaa	Just take a test.|`|r5zy8jMgaa	You would not have gained weight that fast.Or have gotten that sick. Pregnancy morning sickness doesn't usually start till about 8 weeks or later.  I just found out I was 6 weeks and I never felt any of that yet. and my last pd was january 10th. They said I conceived the 23d you'll just have to wait till your late.|`|MsipL0Mzaa	well there is a chance since youve been doing it...i wouldnt think morning sickness would be happening just yet,but i guess everyone is different....not all people have implantation bleeding....but my breast were the first thing that i noticed and they felt very heavy sore and got really hard.....i would just get a test...you can take most test 5 days before your due period.....goodluck...|`|zk3Bp9uNaa	Take an early test<br>  <br>  <br>  Sounds like you could be expecting|`|2ObqoJbKaa	You definetly could be pregnant, if you have been having unprotected sex. Its probably too early to be having morning sickness yet, that doesn't usually kick in til a little later. Mine started at about week 6. Your symptoms sound like you could either be just starting your period, or possibly pregnant. It sucks cuz pregnancy symptoms and pms are alot alike, so its hard to tell the difference. but when I first found out I was pregnant, I was having all the usual pms symptoms. I thought I was getting my period, but it never came and it turned out I was pregnant. So you never know. Just have to be patient and see if you get your period. and if you don't take a test. Good luck to you.
vQ8XPXsdaa	Congrats to your sister on the twins!!!<br>  <br>  I don't think that names for twins should match completly -- and especially don't like ryhming names or boy/girl names together that are basically the same (i.e. Victoria and Victor) <br>  <br>  Here are suggestions..<br>  Two girls: Alexa and Brielle, Madison and Lauren, Rachel and Olivia, Naomi and Bella, or Paige and Erin.<br>  <br>  Two Boys: Nicholas and Landon, James and Ryan, Raymond and Jamie, Joseph and Garret or Hunter and Tyler. <br>  <br>  Boy and Girl: Victoria and Kyle, James and Torri, Merrit and Ashley, Jackson and Lauren, or Oliver and Madeleine. <br>  <br>  I don't mean to be rude or offend anyone -- hope I helped!!|`|RoTLnFGZaa	i like <br>  Cameron and Cylie. or Kylie and Kameron.

So having matching names would be the first thing I would NOT do. I'm sure your sister will stick with what she likes but this is just another consideration. Also matching names will be harder to choose because what if you really like the name Bella for example but can't find a boys name starting with "B" that you really love- how unfair for the little boy to have a name just because that was the chosen letter!!|`|ln0wLqZhaa	The ones i like are <br>  A:  Alexa , Austin<br>  B: Brandon , Bella<br>  C: Carmen , Chanelle<br>  I: Isabella and ivan  ( to cute)<br>  J:Jamie , Jessica<br>  K: Kyle and krist ( there are also very cute :)<br>  M: Madison , Mason<br>  N: Nathen <br>  O: how about Olivia and Owen ?<br>  R: Ryan , Rachel<br>  T: Tyler and taylor ?

FEg0PDdnaa	A friend of mine hemorrhaged after she gave birth to her first child. I'm not sure what the cause was but she went on to have 2 more children and had no complications with either the pregnancies or the births. As long as your doctors know your history they will take good care of you.
ZA5QTj3Zaa	Legally the baby can take the mothers last name unless you two are married.  If you don't think you will break up maybe a hyphenated name will work.  You can always change it later when/if you marry.<br>  <br>  If you just want your name I would talk to you male partner first about it.|`|tw1uePBbaa	i think a baby should have the dads last name.  if you have a good relationship now, then i dont see why you should assume the worst for the future.  if you want your last name included, i would hyphenate it with his.|`|94kNwMPdaa	i would have the baby take the dads last name. that baby is always going to be apart of him so why does it matter? I'm just old fashioned i guess and i believe the baby should have the fathers last name|`|P9k8qHP6aa	My parents broke up when my mom was pregnant with me and my mom gave me her last name...and now 25 almost 26 years later is has done nothing but cause problems for me. Grated all of those problems have come from decisions that my mother has made regarding my last name but none the less...but anyways I strongly believe that the baby should have its fathers last name no matter what, the father is who it is and nothing will change that|`|OXxKTM6vaa	I would always prefer for my children to have their fathers name.... providing he is actually there and a father. Its tradition.. in you're mums case I would do the same as her.<br>  <br>  However with you I'd probably name the child after its father, providing you arent intending to split up etc.

Now I know this sounds really boring but my 2 year old boy loves it. Most libraries now have little play areas and comfy areas in them with great toddler books to read to them (mine has even got a coffee machine). They don't mind noise that they will inevitably make! as long as it's within the kiddie bit. My son loves to pick some books and DVS's to take out every week and libraries don't even charge for books coming back late or ripped pages. Hope this helps!|`|liOClXPHaa	arts and crafts!! grab out some paint and let your 2 year old go crazy, finger painting, and let him/her experiment with different patterns certain things make when dipped in paint eg. sponges, rocks, string.. my nephew is two and he loves doing this.. also building cubby houses out of sheets and stuff, haha
plI0WOrUaa	I always liked the pill.  It was easy, as long as you remember to take it.  Plus, you still get your periods and when you want to come off of it, you don't have to wean yourself off of it or anything.  Some brands made me moody, but I found one that didnt.  Just made my periods lighter and less crampy.  I loved it.  Its old trusty lol!|`|wUdweNSmaa	One of the best methods is the female condom. The great thing about that, is that you are in control of it. You do not have to count on your partner to be wearing it. It also decreases the risks of STDs.<br>  <br>  For better protection combine it with vaginal contraceptive inserts. If you use the both of them properly, they will be very effective. And you are not exposed to hormones all of the time.|`|AA11083066	Ask your doctor for samples.  And/or ask for a pill that is low cost.  Go to different pharmacies and find out how much the different brands cost (when I was on it, it was not covered under insurance and Target had it cheaper than Walgreen's).  If it's too expensive...tell him to go buy condoms.  Also, try looking into a planned parenthood or a free clinic near you.  Some have birth control that's free or cheap.

(else she will get pregnant)<br>  <br>  Google Tough Love (or go to the library) and start from there - in addition to taking her stuff away from her if she complains about her new look & travel restrictions, and depending on her grounding requirements, you may have to take the door off of her room.<br>  <br>  I really believe a good and COMPLETE talk will take care of the problem, but if not, see previous paragraph.<br>  <br>  good luck mom - you'll need it  *__*|`|TMkHzArLaa	talk to her,tell her its bad and if she does it gain start taking stuff away.

The boy's parents have the right to be furious that you laid hands on their son. <br>  <br>  If you're a legit mom I really don't understand why you needed to go into detail about the sisters being friends.

(and be honest with yourself)  It drives me nuts seeing parents whining around about their "out of control" daughters or kids but they refuse to stick to the discipline they've set.  Frankly, its either laziness on the parents part or their "feeling bad" for the child being punished.  What is she grounded from?  Lay out the lines and terms distinctly and be sure you go over those terms with her (calmly).  Then for God's sake STICK to it!!!  I don't care if Miley Cyrus' limo is brokecounselinger best friends house (not that your 10 year old would care about Miley Cirus like most 10 year olds if shes in bed with boys already) but regardless, STICK TO THE FRIGGIN' PUNISHMENT!!!<br>  <br>  However, you may also want to look into counciling.  I have a 8, 10 (soon to be 11), and a 12 year old daughter and I have to say that I would be SHOCKED beyond belief to see my 10 year old in that type of situation. (and she too watches tv)  She nor any of her friends are at "that place" yet.  It seems very odd that she is so "advanced".  Are you sure she's never been molested?  It is a matter of proven statistics that children that become "sexually active" (I know that they weren't having sex but it is in the same category, she was active in a sexual manner), in children that become sexually active at very young ages, a very high percentage of those children were sexually abused.<br>  <br>  I would run, not walk but RUN to get counciling with or for your daughter.  If you don't have the money, find a church where a pastor would be willing to help.  Her childhood is being stolen and it is your job as a mother to do something about it.  She is too immature to see it that way so YOU have to do something.<br>  <br>  Also, put your foot down when it comes to her attire.  You act as though she got the streak of pink in her hair and wears what she wants and there is nothing you can do about it.  You are her mother for God's sake and you can't allow her to put herself out there as a neon sign to boys saying, Come and get it!<br>  <br>  Please stand up and be an active parent for your daughter.  It is good that you are asking advice on what to do but unless you get up from your computer and go and get this taken care of, all the advice is worthless.|`|28zqdoSNaa	I think you need to talk to your daughter. I think she needs a mother she feels she can confide in and feel is there to support her. It's hard to understand what teenagers go through in their daily lives. I think you should teach her to respect herself so that boy respect her. If she is becoming sexually active it's probably because there is pressure in her circle to act that way. I would sit down with her and really have a conversation without getting upset at the answers she might give you. She's probably just trying to get your attention. Kids need discipline. They also act out based on what they see. If they don't have good role models they can get confused about what's right and wrong. They also need clear expectations. She's really young and she's probably confused about who she is or what she wants to be. You need to be there to guide her and advise her.|`|FkbYr8yuaa	Well I am a 14 year old myself so I thought I would give some input from your daughters age: I would defiantly make sure you don't say anything about her not being able to see the guy or refusing her to be able to see the guy because she will just rebel. Also I would keep her grounded for the amount of time that you said and then explain to her that you don't want her to make such big decisions at this age, but don't tell her to not act like that or that she can't act like that because she will just rebel! <br>  <br>  Hope I helped!|`|OzpzIXwuaa	hmm.<br>  you must be a really bad (or irresponsible) mom to let them be in the room together touching each other with out noticing.<br>  they are both probably sluts, doing that so young, so send them to boot camp!:]]<br>  and not to be mean, but its half your fault. haha<br>  and who lets a ten year old have a pink highlight <br>  seriously dude...|`|oyINZiNDaa	talk to her about it.........ask her if she has questions for you..or what made her want to act like that....explain that sex is a "grown up" thing to do...an that your not mature enough to do that..no matter what everybody else was doing|`|z0W9zomaaa	hmmmmm. how do i put this.<br>  i have fights with my mom alot too, never like that.<br>  mabey it's because of how she is being influenced. or how often mom puts her foot on the ground.|`|Am2GSJfFaa	Right on, Mom!

Also this boy has something wrong with him if wants to dates a 10 year old. Think about it ur daughter is in like 4-5th grade and a 14 year old is like in 8th or 9th. SO no. This kid is a freak for trying to go out with a 10 year old and u shouldn't allow ur kid near him.|`|OCKLSoKqaa	ummm if your asking a bunch of people on the internet. thats pretty bad...if i was ten and wanted a 14 year old and told my mom she would probably kick the **** out of me. ok not really but shed be like ummm i don't think so.<br>  <br>  follow my moms example. tell your daughter to try being a kid. she shouldn't be worrying about guys at 10 years old!! plus 14 is waaaaay to mature for a 10 year old. girl|`|3653KNYDaa	yeaah, i'd hate for my mom to make me stop seeing someone just cause of age, put yoruself in her shoes, let her be, your not young forever.<br>  <br>  although at the age of 10 she shouldent be dating ANYONE.|`|w7XNcmihaa	10 is way too young to even be dating. You can't go anywhere, you don't know how to kiss, you don't know what love is at that age.|`|eqsIIuydaa	YES, BECAUSE usually when you try to keep a child away from something they'll want it even more, and you do not want this girl doing bad things just because she's not allowed. trust me i've experienced stuff like this.|`|I8nIewQHaa	If the 14 year old is a girl then I don't see a problem with it. If the 14 year old is a boy then only if I really do mean only if your home with them in the living room not alone.|`|Q05rrSX4aa	See, as in date?  No.  <br>  As friends, maybe.  But I would meet the 14 year old first, see what their intentions are.  14 year olds are interested in sex now!  I would be very careful.|`|xqzE2tkqaa	if you don't let her she'll see him another day you wont know about it.<br>  and hide from you everything<br>  <br>  i suggest you should but "control" the situation ;)|`|NAwzuLayaa	No way!

NO WAY!!!  No dating until she is 18!|`|2G1vKuZAaa	**** no!|`|OZrdXQMyaa	Absolutely not. I cant believe you would even consider this. She is far too young.

You should not let your 10 year old daughter see anyone, let alone a 14 year old.  Please, oh please, get you and your kid to a therapist or family counselor as soon as you can.  If you think you can't afford it, go to your local social services department ans request free counseling.  Your daughter has some serious issues she needs addressed by a trained professional if she is looking to date at such an early age, and you need some serious help if you actually need to ask if its okay for her to be dating.  Trust me, seek help before its too late for her....swallow your pride and remember that its okay to ask for help, especially if its for the benefit and well-being of your child.|`|HFsRHZS6aa	As in "going out"? Oh god, no! You're not much of a super mom if you even let the idea of your ten year old daughter dating come into your head. Let alone going out with a fourteen year old. <br>  <br>  And if you didn't mean "going out", and if your daughter just wants to be friends with a fourteen year old, then sure. Make sure the fourteen year old is a girl, though, and make sure she's a good person herself.|`|7uRFHWxkaa	I know alota people say age doesn't matter. Well it doesn't, once you've reached that certain age where it won't. Your daughter is still maturing and has not fully developed her mind or even "body" enough yet to fully understand the concepts of dating or making the right decisions that come with relationships. Teenage boys hormones are out of control because they are at the stage of becoming a man. Your daughter probably hasn't even had her first period. So unless you want your daughter to be molested or raped or feel uncomfortable with this boy in any way, I'd suggest you keep her away from him until she herself develops properly.|`|RpEP0biLaa	honestly i don't see the big deal, i mean the kid doesn't have access to a car, he can't buy cigarettes. A four years difference isn't that much.But the best thing to do would to check out his back round, meet his family. This might be embarrassing to your daughter,but at least you know she is in good hands.|`|idMpK0suaa	Are you serious? Hell no!<br>  <br>  Do you really think your daughter who's probably in fifth grade, should see a guy in high school? Does that make sense? She's not even a teenager yet! And besides, dating at ten years old is nothing. There's no real relationship there. If there's a four year age difference WHEN THEY'RE STILL KIDS, that's just totally messed up. And I agree with vw1282. <br>  <br>  It's just creepy. That's like having a 40 year old dating your 16 year old... only a little less of an age difference... O.o|`|db5f6d9593a678681b66a5729cebb0e3aa	A 10 year old girl is still a child and you should be fostering a healthy image of a girl growing up without being pushed into the arms of a horny 14 year old boy.  Seriously, this must be a joke question.  If you are seriously asking this, you shouldn't be a parent.|`|cq2qsPJkaa	I think that you should not let your 10 year old daughter date a 14 year old because it will cause many problems inside your home and out<br>  <br>  also a 4 year span difference between a 10 year old daughter would not be right at all<br>  <br>  talk to her and explain why you are not going to let her date him|`|9t8pJG5Caa	I think you need to clarify the question.<br>  Are you asking "Should you let your 10 year old daughter be friends with a 14 year old girl?"  or are you asking the same question except the 14 year old is a boy?<br>  <br>  Clarify please...|`|WA4JoCEvaa	well i think it depends...<br>  how mature your daughter is and how mature the guys is and how much you trust him<br>  <br>  if your daughter is mature for her age and you trust her and this guy is mature and you trust him go for it!<br>  <br>  if not dont|`|PAC7aoBfaa	No way in hell.

He may not be an absolutely giant fan of that--but if he is, go with that.|`|MOHuGi3oaa	Everlee is cute. :] nickname- evee or lee and middle name like grace, rose, whats the last name?|`|27299196d94e4542e17592433927dc00aa	I like everlee seems more feminin|`|3axDgVA2aa	It's beautiful! I think of a brunette girl who loves nature and animals.|`|gAvJMVsMaa	Beautiful unique and really pretty.i never heard such a cute name.|`|NN3BIX8caa	Sorry ........!! Go for another Name ..It IS not Good.
tcHkn0VIaa	Haven't you ever watched Maury on TV. yes there is a paternity test which can be done once the child is born and it is DNA where they swab the cheek and get saliva and compare the 2 samples. Bottom line is he needs to know you were unfaithfull. You chose to cheat now you have to own up to the conciquences!|`|zk3Bp9uNaa	DNA test - it will show who the father really is.<br>  <br>  Best to be honest and just tell him|`|v0aKxF6iaa	yes he can find out when the baby is born if he wants to get a dna test done.|`|hzAidxdkaa	well you sound like someone who is not very trustworthy so if he's smart he will have a DNA test. If you knowingly extract money from him for support and he finds out it's not his kid he can sue you for every last dime. I hope he dumps you and you end up all alone. You're not the kind of person that should be allowed to raise a child.|`|Jcz29H2Oaa	you better hope that the guys look exactly alike, or else hes going to see a difference and want a dna test. mannnn why do all these girls act so SCANDOLOUS these days. stop cheating on your man! if your old enough to have a baby your old enough to know how to be faithful! grow up!|`|CpiLHcTlaa	yeah its called a DNA test.  he might also see it and notice it looks like someone else! i hate when girls do this... it give the rest of us a bad name. trapping someone who isn;t the father with taking care of a baby he had nothing to do with?|`|3w7VztEWaa	when the baby is born he can have dna test done.<br>  and you should tell him how can you have a relationship on lies.<br>  better you tell him than someone else.|`|PRBjG2c2aa	Yes, DNA test will tell the truth. You should not go through your pregnancy with this on your mind. It is only fair for your child to know who his real father is. Tell your boyfriend what happened and let him decide if he wants to be with you or not. There is a reason you slept with someone else and search your heart and find out the truth for yourself.  You are not the first woman to find herself in this position nor will you be the last. Don't spend a lot f time beating yourself up for this, you have a child coming and no matter who the father is you are the mother! <br>  If your boyfriend does not want to be with you okay, it hurts but move on many men have known and raised another mans child. It is not the end of the world.  <br>  Get it out in the open and get ride of the stress you currently have about this.|`|445676ee4ba9ef6e5bd44f0f3b9d7501aa	If he is suspicious, he could ask for a DNA test (can be done after the baby is born, and is painless).  The test would definitely tell if the baby is his or not.<br>  <br>  Prior to the baby being born, I suppose he could ask for an amniocentesis...but this is higher in risk and requires your willingness and consent.|`|4AZp8Quwaa	You need to grow up and tell your boyfriend the truth. I am not trying to be mean here, but you are being selfish. Your boyfriend deserves to know. That baby also deserves to know who his/her father is.|`|IExPOxpHaa	Yes, he can take a DNA test to find out.  Besides, it is completely wrong to make him go through his entire life believing a child is his when it is not.  This is a huge deal and definitely not something to lie about.|`|SL1v6fpCaa	seroiusly just tell him its not good 2 wait <br>  he will appreciate it now instead of finding out later<br>  Why did u cheat??
V7Q7SbHfaa	My daughter is also very big.  She is 8 months old and at her 6 month checkup she was already 19.9lbs and 28.5 inches.  I'm sure she is much bigger by now, but I was also worried about her weight and the doctor told me to try and feed her more often during the day then at night she would not need as much.  I did this when she was still only eating formula and it worked.  Now she gets 3 meals a day and formula.  It still seems to work for us.  Try this and see how it does for you, but if it doesn't work don't get discouraged he will stop waking up eventually.|`|pXSKSS3daa	That's really not "huge". His length is in the 50th percentile and his weight is between the 50th and 75th percentile. So he's actually pretty average when compared to other baby boys his age.<br>  <br>  The majority of babies will NOT take in more than they need, so it's likely your son is just feeding on demand which is normal and should be happening. I wouldn't stress out so much, especially as it seems his doctor isn't.|`|EmYNUZcXaa	that doesn't seem huge. they say the average baby is between 20-25 pounds at one year. so he seems right on track. my sister in law's baby is 6 months old and 21 pounds!! probably not good, but who am i to say...|`|Wb9oqcWDaa	My son was and is big also.  The only reason your son gets up in the night for a bottle is because you give it to him.  I would stop feeding him at night now.  He doesn't need it anymore.  The most effective way we found to get our son to stop the bottle at night is 3 nights of crying.  It is hard and really sad but very effective.  Pick a weekend that works best for your family and lay him down like you normally would, when he gets up for a bottle wait about 10 minutes and see if he will just go back to sleep, if not go in lay him down and tell him its time to sleep.  If he continues to cry give him 20 minutes go in and do the same thing.  Each time you go in extend it 10 more minutes.  I will be honest, the first night really sucks but I promise it will work and you will be much happier.<br>  <br>  Make sure he is getting 3 meals and 3 snacks a day with however many bottles you give him in the day and he has had as much food as he needs.
sbeoF50gaa	I've never had a Dr. FLICK my nipple!  and WHILE he does that says "you've grown into a lady" weird, creepy, unprofessional... I would have felt extremely uncomfortable. The "terrific"reply was just an "everything is okay" but the nipple thing.. I dunno I guess I would have had to experience it myself to be sure.|`|wzM5WB8Xaa	Regardless of whether or not this is normal, you need to trust your gyno. If you were uncomfortable with any part of his exam, it is time for you to start looking for a different gyno. By the way, my female gyno does the same types of exams to me, so it is normal.|`|0vLU2GGGaa	No, it is not normal for doctor to do this, is there a female nurse present when he gives you the check up?  I think it is required when a male doctor exam a female patient's body there should be a female nurse there to watch the whole process.  In my opinion, he definitely took advantage of you.|`|1o820L3Daa	hmmmm! I think he sexually assaulted you, I have never been to a doctor for a check up where he asked me to take my clothes off. Never had my boobs rubbed, or checked down there. Except for a pap smear. Id report him. Your not over reacting.<br>  <br>  If hes going to examine you like that, he needs to have a female nurse present.|`|a6e7SRYzaa	That is not normal, at all. I have gone to male doctors for woman issues and they do not act like that. You need to report him. There should have also been a woman nurse in the room since he was a man and you are underage. Was there someone else in the room?|`|bwHWizWyaa	Bad doctor. Don't see him again.  Report it. That is definitely not normal conduct for a doctor.<br>  The definition of assult, is ANY unwanted touch.|`|E5CnUdhsaa	it is not normal report him|`|s3pkM64faa	This is not normal and your parents should help you deal with this. Try talking to your parents again, at least to get another doctor you should never feel uncomfortable at a doctor visit. If you can try to go to a female it will make you feel more comfortable. A male doctor must have a female nurse in the room for any exam. Please talk to someone who can help, don't suffer with the bad feeling alone.|`|WGadfTJaaa	I wouldn't go back to him if he made you feel uncomfortable, Personally from what you've said  it sounds like he's crossed the line And when I see my doctor about this sorta stuff he doesn't touch my breast he just looks.<br>  <br>  your doctor seem like a pervert <br>  <br>  Good luck and don't let this experience ruin your outlook on doctors there not all like this.|`|M2yERqNSaa	first of all what lousy parents leave their teenager alone in the room wiht a dr, NEVER NEVER and if this is real and you arent some sick troll, call the police, PERIOD< call the police.<br>  <br>  only idiot parents done believe their children|`|bdWO9wSAaa	Your doctor sounds like a perverted freak.<br>  <br>  When you're 18, go see a new doctor. <br>  <br>  This is why I don't let my mother take me to male doctors. Too many bad experiences and possible things that could happen without a parent or nurse in the room.|`|aoHYpnH4aa	i have a female gyno<br>  and i bet that's different from a guy but if she didn't do that then why would a guy need to do that|`|842e6473a8bb1a5aebd67febd13abe6daa	A nurse HAS to be present when a Doctor does that type of thing - it's illegal otherwise. <br>  <br>  If this is TRUE, then you need to report him.|`|NW7RZ3YWaa	ohhh my jesus!<br>  lord have mercy<br>  report the perve!<br>  <br>  i have a femal doctor and she dosent even do that<br>  ewww...<br>  <br>  good luck
749K6Hysaa	Unfortunately, something similar happened to me. The doctor told me that it was normal to miss a few periods when taking birth control. I did not know that I was pregnant and I lost the baby because I continued to take birth control while I was pregnant.<br>  I feel like the best advice is to stop taking the pill and wait for now. Your best option is a blood test, that way, they can see where the Progesterone Hormone level is at. If you can't get to a doctor, whether you can't afford it or you can't find a free clinic, then wait a few more weeks and take an over the counter pregnancy test. It is hard to determine a pregnancy right away and you might get a false result. <br>  Be careful and Good luck to you! :0)|`|zk3Bp9uNaa	I concieved on BC - taking it regularly etc<br>  <br>  It is possible that you are pregnant - take a test.<br>  <br>  Your period may also be a little off normal as you have just started BC|`|S1t4e9E0aa	its possible u could be pregnant<br>  i know 2 girls got preg on bc

How embarrassing, to be stuck as part of a TV sitcom title for life!<br>  <br>  Nothing is more ridiculous than naming your kids something that rhymes like "Daniel and Nathaniel."  Giving them the same initials is bad enough.<br>  <br>  Just pick two regular names you like well enough.<br>  <br>  Besides, if you know you have twins but didn't want to know the sex, it IS possible you have a set of fraternal twins including one boy and one girl.|`|PmT8dPEqaa	Boys:<br>  Bryan and Ryan<br>  Nathaniel and Daniel<br>  Jayden and Jason<br>  <br>  Girls:<br>  LilyAnn and MaryAnn<br>  LisaMarie and RoseMarie<br>  <br>  <br>  xD|`|9KpidWBEaa	I like Aden and Kaden for boys and depending on what you like for girl or boy names you can choose variations of the same name.

Go and get a test done to see if you are actually pregnant though.|`|rHufcHwHaa	take a pregnancy test|`|plI0WOrUaa	You could be with a period that late.  Usually the appetite doesn't kick in until at least 6weeks.  Mine didn't really change until about 4 months actually.  When I got pregnant my first signs were bloating (big time), fatigue like crazy, very sore breasts, headaches and some dizziness.  YOu would be at a great time to take a pregnancy test if you wanted to know for sure.  Good luck :)|`|Rf2r23sYaa	take a pregnancy test|`|tcHkn0VIaa	Absolutely!!! any HPT will be accurate at this point I say you should go get a test and take it.|`|IExPOxpHaa	I didn't experience frequent urination until later on in my pregnancy.  I am 28 weeks and never have had problems with never feeling full. Everyone is different though.  Being 2 weeks late is a good sign that you are pregnant, but there are other things that can cause a period to be late.  You should definitely test.|`|db283f38a50e9b11c80bec5ede4f7661aa	NO, it can all be in your head especially if it was the first time you had sex, ah I know I freaked out, I almost wanted that to be true, thank God It wasn't so.<br>  Don't be paranoid wait a little longer if you don't get it in another two weeks be scared, sometimes that happens especially now that were going into a five week month all that stuff is confusing, the month was shorter so idk<br>  If you are and you're not ready don't freak there are alternatives.

YgNackecaa	Well I probably am not the best person to ask.  My 11 month old still sleeps in our bed and I cuddle him all night long.  He is so cute and sweet, I love waking up to his baby face and squeezing his fat baby legs and arms.  Last night he would only fall asleep rocking on my chest.  You know what, just cuddle her.  Soon they will be obnoxious teenagers who will be embarassed just to be seen with you!|`|r61bHJ0iaa	Just enjoy it!  My 11 month old is fiercly independant and barely wants cuddled at all...ever.  I try and try and try to cuddle with her as much as possible, but to no avail.  It makes me kinda sad.  She just likes to be off on her own. She's a very happy and secure baby and barely crys.  I think some babys are born more secure than others. She gives kisses and stuff and I'm trying to teach her to hug, but she doesn't like hugs...lol. So, my advice would be to give her what she needs and hope it doesn't past too soon.|`|wi6mkT30aa	It's normal hon, and very sweet. Sometimes children are more clingy than others. I think it's cute that she needs that just be thankful because it is won't last forever and it's adorable!<br>  <br>  I don't know if you listen to country music or not. But I think you should hear this song. It's so true.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=at_lUnFjXg8" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=at_lUnFjX...</a>|`|xrfD9Jqnaa	Maybe throughout the day cuddle her more. Maybe she feels like shes not getting enough love from you? Also, when she comes to you, don't cuddle her. She will eventually learn you just cant do it so she'll fall asleep on her own. Good luck!
uCLenopbaa	WHY WOULD SOMEONE LET THEIR KID HAVE A BOTTLE UNTIL THEY ARE 2. ..<br>  you did the right thing, as long as she still drinks her formula/breast milk until she is a year.<br>  <br>  don't listen to your mother in law.|`|pXSKSS3daa	Our son will be 11 months old next week and has been on all sippy cups(with his formula, of course) for a few weeks now.<br>  <br>  If she's making the transition this easy then leave her be. No sense in forcing something on her because your MIL thinks children need to be on bottles until they are two.|`|GR07LyyTaa	my daughter is 6mths old and can hold a sippie cup good, but wont hold her bottle.. but plays with the sippie cup more then drink from it, so if you feel she is ready to use the sippie cup, go for it.. you no her best!! do what ever you think is right!|`|vm8HtVUYaa	As long as she's drinking her fluids and she doesn't seem to miss the bottle, I don't see a problem with it. Just make sure she's getting her formula or breast milk through the bottle, it is recommended to keep the baby on breast milk or formula until their first birthday. Cow's milk shouldn't be started until after the baby's first birthday.<br>  You're lucky she's making the transition so easy!|`|7rIAd6gGaa	What difference does it make if it's a bottle or a cup? Your MIL is being ridiculous. You have to make the switch to a cup at some point, and if you can do it without issues now, go for it! It would be crazy to put her back on the bottle just because of her age. I switched my daughter at about 10 months too. Ignore your mil and her friends. You did the right thing.|`|UriE3wN6aa	i took my son off the bottle at 10 months!!|`|Wz1O9m53aa	Just ignore your mother-in-law. It sounds as if your daughter is perfectly ready to move on past the bottle.|`|I9BbQ5Qmaa	your doing just fine dont listen to your MIL, drinking from a sippie cup is better for your babys teeth.|`|oWLznROuaa	They say when your child is eating solid foods and snacks they shouldnt really need a bottle anyway - maybe at night time (which is when my son has his) but even then its suggested they start drinking from a sippy cup as it helps their teeth and the roof of their mouths stronger.  I say do what you think is right - the whole point of a bottle when a baby is young is to get the nutrients they are missing out on in solid food, but if she is a good eater and is getting enough fluids then you go girl!  My friends little girl wouldnt take her bottle after 6 months and she has never been ill a day - and she is coming on for 2 in may!  Just tell your mum in law a lot has changed since the rationing days of WW2 - in those days a fat baby was a healthy baby!  Times have changed!
rGci1ehoaa	stop bringing her into your room!! i didnt nurse when my kids were that age but i never got up to feed them a bottle either.. your child should be sleeping through the night.. make sure she is nice and full when u put her to bed.. stick to her orginal routine DO NOT bring her into your bed... nurse her in her own room if you must.. just remember no kid has ever died from crying.. i know it may be hard to hear her scream and you are losing sleep but it is only going to get worse if you give into her|`|AA10742362	when my dd was only a few weeks old she would cry all night long sometimes.  i mean she would stop  but inevitably she would cry again even with feeding, etc.  she would only sleep on me, not just in our bed but on me i asked her doc cuz i felt so bad, she would cry til she almost couldnt breathe some times, didnt know if i was missing something he explained it like this...as a newborn they cant manipulate u.  they want to be comforted so we comfort them.  as they get older and can manipulate we let them cry.  if they cry so hard they pass out then their body will breathe for them automatically .  now obviously he didnt mean it so matter of fact but i got his point.  as long as u know her needs are met let her be.  i dont speak from experience with that age, my dd is only 5 months old but i also know when something big is about to happen with her because her sleep goes to poop, lol.  3months growth spurt didnt sleep for like 2 weeks leading up to it, 4 months same thing then started rolling over, just turned 5 months this weekend hasnt been sleeping and today popped her first tooth.  maybe something unexpected is about to happen?  good luck, im dreading the days that im gonna have to let her cry herself to sleep...my poor heart strings :)|`|Wb9oqcWDaa	First you have to teach your baby that you are the boss.  She is at the age were she can manipulate you.  She has figured out if she cries long enough you will come to her.  I went through the same thing with my son and the Dr told me to do the 3 nights of crying to get him to understand that he has to put himself to sleep.  She is old enough now to go through the night with out eating and should be able to put herself to sleep.  I would suggest not pulling her into your bed any more, once she knows you wont do that anymore move on to the next thing that you want to eliminate.  As far as the schedule start laying her down at those times for naps again and don't get her out till she has taken a nap, start feeding her when you want her to be fed etc.

Have you asked the DR about it, and is the DR concerned. They should have measured your fundal height/given you an ultrasound if they're worried. My doctor thinks I'm not showing as much in correlation to how far long I am. And if it still doesn't change at my next appointment he's going to send me in for an ultrasound.|`|HPRlEWu1aa	hey, every woman shows differently ... just o to the doc and make sure the baby is growing like it should be at the week that u are in .. theres nothing u can do or we can do about this. im 5`1 so i hope i show by 31 weeks lol .. im showing a lil at 14 weeks. also weight could have something to do with how u show ... if ure carrying more weight for ur hight u may not show as much as some1 in the normal weight range for their hight|`|OXxKTM6vaa	My mum never shown either, people used to call her a liar and say she wasn't even pregnant over my sister!

I am 5ft exactly and 23 weeks along and I feel huge.  I popped out around 18-19weeks, but everyone is different.  People carry their babies differently.  Maybe you are carrying more into your back or something.  Unless your doctor thinks there is a problem, you should be just fine.  Ask at your next appointment if it scares you.  Then you'll at least know whats going on.|`|ae12c1d8c1c47a1b878b6100f2dccc4eaa	Sorry, but none of this makes sense.  If you are 31 weeks pregnant you should be showing by now, and you should have already had an ultrasound.  If you haven't been to a doctor yet, you should go to the hospital and have them check the baby's heartbeat.|`|vCtCW8ODaa	this has got to be one of the funniest spelling mistakes ever lol... but if it's your first it's normal not to have a bump for a while, i was tiny until around 7months and then it seemed to grow overnight....|`|Y3DR1EBUaa	i SHOWED BAD WITH MY 1ST & I AM 6 FT TALL BUT MY 2ND DIDNT SHOW THAT BAD BUT IT WAS OBVIOUS I WAS PREGO|`|A0tWlG94aa	just go to ur doc

KDb96QS7aa	I would not suspect the shots are the cause of his difficulty falling back asleep.  That's probably just a coincidence.<br>  I have heard that babies going through growth spurts or reaching developmental milestones begin to have difficulty settling. 6-8 months is a first for a lot of things, so perhaps his little brain is having difficulty shutting down.<br>  That said, you need our sleep. Ferber is not such a bad thing. It worked for my son. It only took 2 days and he was 7.5 months at the time. (he is 9 months now and sleeps much better - he still wakes once a night but I'm breastfeeding and he's not huge on the solids so that may be why).  <br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|a43c635a9767f924cfd929c6c43f2501aa	If he is good & full when he goes to sleep, that should help.|`|1enIWBGnaa	Cut him down to one day-time nap and make sure his tummy is full before going to bed.  Install a night light and play some calm soothing music.|`|77hZZZXvaa	Does he have any sleep crutches? Most babies wake during the night just like we do but they have to be taught to put themselves back to sleep. If you go in right away when he starts stirring then he might be dependant on you to get back to sleep. See what happens if you don't go in for a while, you never know he may go back to sleep! But if you've tried this and he just cries then that may be what you have to do, CIO. Babies do go through phases though, growth spurts, new teeth etc. If he is not in pain then he is ok to CIO. It sucks, I know, but it will only take him a couple nights and he'll get it. Good luck!|`|oWLznROuaa	Sad to say, you can only get lucky sometimes, babies cry at night.  Maybe he is cutting a tooth (or teeth).  Try giving him a bath before bed using lavender bath oil (get the baby friendly one) and give him some calpol before bed?  Good luck!
Q05rrSX4aa	Yes, but unlikely.  As long as you have been taking your pills and not missing any, I wouldn't worry about it.  You are still new on the pill so your period may take some time to get regular.  I have been on and off the pill for about 12 years and never got pregnant on it.  There is like a 1% chance.  Use condoms as well to increase your protection.  I would take a test if you really think you are pregnant.  Good Luck:)|`|zk3Bp9uNaa	There is always a chance that you could be pregnant having unprotected sex - and the pill isnt 100% so dont just rely on that.<br>  <br>  <br>  Take a test|`|2ObqoJbKaa	I don't know. Usually if you take your pills correctly every day, you are pretty well protected. You shouldn't be getting pregnant. but its odd that your getting your period earlier  than your suppose too. I would talk to your doctor about that, you may be having side effects from the pill. I would recommend waiting to see if you get your period next month, and if you don't, then take a test to find out for sure. Most likely your fine though. Good luck.

Although 30 minutes is fair in my mind because there are plenty of other things you could be doing that are more beneficial for you. Read, study, exercise, join a after school activity etc. Maybe there is an actual computer class you can take that will help you with the knowledge you'll need later; check with a local college there may be online courses you can take.|`|YI31TqNNaa	lol, ur comeback is hilarious!!! I honestly don't have much of a response for you, but that is hilarious! lol. anyway, they are the parents. maybe if you show a little maturity and deal with it, they will realize they made a rushed decision and change their minds. if you throw a fit like a 5 year old, they will treat you likewise. ha ha, im still laughing about that baby thing|`|Q2OP7SOtaa	Unlucky.<br>  <br>  while you live under there roof its prety much there rules. ask them if there are any chores you can do with a reward of extra computer time, they might feel that the extra responsibility you are taking on is possitive.

t4HXotwEaa	A couple of weeks ago i walked by the dumpster at the grocery store and threw up all over the parking lot.  I gag every time i put gas in my car.  Icky smells reek havok on pregnant women.  Good Luck.|`|2ObqoJbKaa	Yea its normal. During pregnancy alot of people develop adversions, or very strong dislikes to certain things. In your case cigarette smoke is an adversion you have. I had a lot of adversions to certain foods in early pregnancy, such as pizza. lol. and I used to love pizza. As I get farther along though, alot of that stuff is slowely disapearring. Your fine though, its perfectly normal. good luck.|`|AuVtUjVAaa	yes this is normal, your sense of smell is heightened and some people get sick to some things they smell..|`|mqHL4UcRaa	YES its normal. Your at the early phase of pregnancy where most everything you smell makes you sick. I couldn't stand the smell of most foods, cigarettes, beer, etc. <br>  <br>  Your sense of smell will increase while pregnant. So you will have this crazy ability to smell things from a great distance.|`|sVPToYvKaa	A lot of women start to get morning sickness around 6 weeks.<br>  Doctors say that usually an empty stomach or a certain SMELL will trigger the morning sickness.<br>  <br>  Cigarette smoke could be that one smell that triggers. For my sister, it was fish and eggs.<br>  YUCK!<br>  <br>  Good luck.<br>  <br>  <br>  Lots of crackers will simmer your stomach and help out with the vomiting.|`|sRy2SKpXaa	It's called morning sickness, lol. It'll make even the SMELL of something make you want to throw up (or in some cases actually throw up). It's totally normal. I still get that way and i'm almost 31 weeks.|`|hqEG4ur6aa	i think its normal, i was smoking till i was 6 weeks as didnt know i was pregnant and just after i got my positive i couldnt smoke at all it made me feel sick as i was going to cut down to stop but went cold turkey and completely stopped as it was horrible and im so glad i did quit espesh 4 my baby and now been smoke free 4 5mths xx|`|plI0WOrUaa	Yes its normal.  Its your body's way of telling you to stay away from toxic things like cigarrette smoke.  Just your body helping out your baby.  Plus, pregnancy heightens your sense of smell, as well as distorts sense of smell, often making things you could normally tolerate really foul smelling.
aeuWwrehaa	you may have experienced a chemical pregnancy: <br>   <br>  A chemical pregnancy is like a cruel joke. You take an early pregnancy test around the time your period is due that shows a faint positive. Naturally, you get excited and start spreading the joyful news that you're expecting. Then, a few days later you get your period and the doctor says, "It was just a chemical pregnancy." <br>  <br>  Meanwhile, you're left confused and possibly devastated. The term chemical pregnancy sounds like a false positive pregnancy test, as if you were not really pregnant at all. But the truth is that a chemical pregnancy was indeed a conception and is actually a very early miscarriage.|`|96HWpdkFaa	You could have had a misscarige...<br>  Those kinds of misscariges are very normal..<br>  Alot of times girls have them without even realizing it and just go on to think it's their regular period.<br>  <br>  Or it could have just been bleeding and a threatend misscarige.<br>  Either way you need to go the doctor.|`|OYvviDoTaa	Calm Down Dear..<br>  <br>  Many women get their periods while pregnant..But Go Check with your doctor to make sure everything's ok..<br>  <br>  Best Of Luck =)|`|rGci1ehoaa	having a period while being pregnant does in fact happen i know this because i had my period my first 2 months of my first pregnancy.. call your doctor.. if he cant get you in for a while once you stop bleeding take another test!! an at home test RARELY  will tell you that you are pregnant if you are not... it is more likely to show negative and be wrong than the other way around|`|yp9rEMSraa	Call your doctor...did you only do one test?  That doesnt sound good to me if you got a BFP and got your period...It probably is nothing and everything is fine but i would still call you doctor....some women do have their period when they are prego|`|txSiQc7Waa	I don't think getting your period while pregnant is as uncommon as we think. I've actually heard of many woman that have done this so don't give up just yet.... Good luck to you!|`|vknGI0cmaa	maybe a spontaneous miscarriage?  It does happen...and does not have to be particularly painful.<br>  <br>  Good luck:)|`|7W3iEtW8aa	You should see your doctor to make sure everything is o.k. - possible miscarriage.
NaJPIOheaa	well.. could you tell me a little more about you? are you charting? if not you should be! i would get OPK's(ovulation predictor kit) and make sure to BD on peak days, there is also other signs such as cervical mucous, and position. it is good to BD when your having egg white cervical mucous, and when your cervix is high and soft. have you been taking prenatal vitamins, and been to a doctor yet? i would recommend a charting site such as <a href="http://www.mymonthlycycles.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.mymonthlycycles.com</a> to understand your cycle more. they also say after a year you should see a fertility doctor, have you been tested for a hormone problem or other things? has your partner also been tested? if you are irregular or rarely ovulating you can try a herb called agnus castus. good luck and tons of baby dust! xo|`|yp9rEMSraa	Buy a male sperm count test and see if your husband has a low sperm count....if you have been trying for a year a doctor will take action and try to help you out probably with clomid....There is a thing called fertilaid for men that is suppose to help with sperm count....take prenatal vitamins, they will level out any vitamins that you are suppose to be getting and not getting.....heard black cosh helps out with fertility but i don't know about this one....stop drinking caffeine it might be causing infertility....if your man smokes have him cut back....try exercising....add more veggies in your diet....try a fertility monitor, chart you BT....if you are using lube stop cause this could be hurting the sperm....so many things you can do just dont give up!!! Best of luck and Baby Dust|`|VQs0adT8aa	Well, trying unsuccessfully for one year is the usual benchmark for going to a fertility specialist.  When you say you've "tried many things," that's not very helpful to keep us from just repeating things you already know.  So if I am listing things you already know about, forgive me.<br>  <br>  The acceptable normal "stats" are that 85% of completely healthy young couples can conceive within one year of unprotected sex.  It is possible to be part of the other 15% WITHOUT there being anything huge wrong with you.  However, it is normal procedure to think of going to an expert if you go a whole year without any success.  Here are some more options before you make the appointment:<br>  <br>  CHARTING:  I would HIGHLY recommend that the very first thing you do is order the book "Taking Charge of Your Fertility," by Toni Weschler (link to Amazon below;  a used copy could easily cost you less than $10US).  Whether or not you try anything else I or someone else mentions, you MUST start charting, which is what the book will teach you.  Charting involves keeping daily track of your waking temperatures and your cervical fluids, along with any other details you choose to track as being possibly relevant to your cycles (like exercise, illness, PMS symptoms, etc).  TCoYF has its own accompanying software (called Ovusoft) that costs $39.95.  I think it is very much worth it, but that's just me.  If you can't swing that much, try going to the Fertility Friend website to keep track of your charts for free.  Their explanations of charting are a rather boring read and not very helpful, in my opinion.  The TCoYF book, on the other hand, is an easy read and includes lots of troubleshooting and specific TTC advice.  There are also courses available where you can be taught the methods from the book by an instructor (look for more information once you have your book in hand).<br>  <br>  Why chart?  It will help you figure out what's going on in your own body.  Just through charting, you can determine if you are ovulating or not, if your luteal phase is long enough to allow implantation, and more.  If you did end up going to a fertility specialist, any one worth his/her salt would ask you to start charting temps and such ANYWAY so you might as well go ahead and do it.<br>  <br>  PRE-SEED:  If your problem is due to a lack of enough cervical fluid to keep the sperm from dying off (the vagina is actually a very hostile environment to them), then try the lubricant called Pre-Seed.  It will help the sperm survive longer and travel faster toward your eggie.  :)<br>  <br>  NUTRITION:  Don't go wild with taking supplements without consulting your doctor, but some women find that taking B-complex vitamins and/or herbals like Vitex/Chasteberry help even out inconsistencies and flaws in their reproductive cycles.  Of course, the best place to start is by fixing any glaring flaws in your ordinary diet.  Make sure you're eating balanced meals.  I assume you're at least already taking prenatals of some sort with folic acid.  If you're not, get on some.<br>  <br>  FITNESS:  Either gaining or losing a few pounds, if necessary, to get into your optimum weight range can do a world of good for your reproductive (as well as overall) health.  The human body is amazing in its natural programming:  it can decide, all by itself, that a too-thin or too-heavy body might not do the greatest job at nourishing a baby.  As a result, our cycles can be affected when we are underweight or overweight.<br>  <br>  ACUPUNCTURE:  Some women have reported amazing results from reproductive-health-focused acupuncture.  I'm not aware of whether any studies have been completed on this, but it's certainly worth a shot.  Some women who had irregular or annovulatory (no-egg) cycles reported that they ovulated earlier or more regularly while on an acupuncture regimen.<br>  <br>  CHECK FOR HORMONES:  Getting more into the realm of hormonal balance, it certainly can't hurt you to ease off if you're consuming too much soy products or other things that contain things called phytoestrogens.  These are estrogen-like compounds found in certain plants.  Consuming too much of them can start to screw with your normal balance.<br>  <br>  RELAX:  As I'm sure many will tell you, allowing yourself to become stressed about TTC failures will just make it worse.  Your reproductive system interprets stress as "Body/environment cannot support a pregnancy safely right now" and can temporarily shut down your ability to reproduce.  Your system isn't able to compute WHY you're stressed... it just knows you are.<br>  <br>  That's all I can think of off the top of my head.  Keep googling/yahooing for more ideas, but one last caution:  If you start going the route of supplements/vitamins over anything else, DON'T GO NUTS and take lots of new ones all at once.  Consult your doctor, and only try one or two new things at a time.  There are a lot of herbals and such out there that don't mix well and you can do yourself more harm than good by trying out the witch doctor routine unschooled.<br>  <br>  HIM:  Trying all the normal stuff can't hurt.  You know, don't let him ride bikes or horses, make him wear boxers, keep him out of hot tubs, etc.  There are vitamin/herbal supplements specifically geared toward male health.  And other than that, I'm honestly not that knowledgeable.  Sorry.  More expert in women's cycles than men.<br>  <br>  Good luck!!!|`|Wzws8v8daa	you said you tried many things.. is one of those things seeing a fertility specialist??  after 1 year of trying without getting pregnant, something is definitely wrong.  you should certainly talk to a fertility doctor so he/she can identify the problem and then help you correct it! there's no reason to just keep trying when you could see a doctor who could get you on your way to being pregnant!|`|Q05rrSX4aa	Its frustrating, I know.  If it has been a year, you can see your doctor and they will check for fertility issues.  One of the most important things to remember is to try not to stress.  Stop trying, relax and enjoy sex.  That is what I am doing right now (though it is hard)<br>  <br>  I would recommend talking to a doctor, I am sure you have already tried tracking ovulation (bbt, cp, cm) and taking your pre natals, Folic Acid and stuff like that.<br>  <br>  Good Luck:)|`|iPsFTNivaa	Before you go see a doctor and pay for (and go through) expensive, invasive tests you should read "Taking Charge of Your Fertility" by Toni Weschler.  It is a must read for anyone trying to conceive.  It explains how you can do a little investigative work into your own fertility and save your gynecologist time and yourself a ton of money!|`|zTnR2ZFeaa	i have been trying to get pregnant for the past 11 months, i would recommend going to your doc for some tests, i have had blood tests to check if i ovulate, pelvic ultrasound and my husband has had his swimmers checked. it helps to rule out these things, i wish you all the very best|`|cEXzXkqnaa	Get your levels checked...<br>  A friend of mine had abnormally low levels of iron and didn't know it...and within 2 months of taking daily iron supplements, she got pregnant.<br>  also...i have had a few friend that have had luck with drinking noni juice everyday.
PQw92IGHaa	You should have your GP refer you to a reproductive specialist and endocrinologist.  They will be able to offer you a wide range of options from fertility meds to testing for specific infertility issues.  Good luck!|`|w1necKzYaa	Try using mycycle.com and input what it says to it is an ovulation calender! I have yet to try but a friend of mine tried for 3 years and is now pregnant with her 2nd!|`|FMmncxToaa	You didnt indicate your age, but if you are younger than 35 yrs old, usually it would take a healthy couple around a year to conceive. It could be wrongtiming also.Are your periods regular? I they are, try monitoring your ovulation, which is the only time  you can conceive,either with a Ovulation Predictor kit, or tracking your bbt chart.Good luck and lots of baby dust to you!|`|s3pkM64faa	I'm in the same boat as you, we have been trying for many months. Reading a lot of books and on line we are using ovulation tests we are using a lubricant called pre seed which is supposed to help sperm live longer and still nothing. Every month is so stressful. Good Luck hopefully other answers can help me too|`|PsNzmPgbaa	sweetheart, many women are tryin for many months, <br>  my mum tryin with my sis for 6 months and with my bro for 3 months<br>  my mate tryin with her second baby for 3 years!!!<br>  i heard that its normal to trying for at least 3 years<br>  dont worry u will be fine :)|`|E7R7D1onaa	i have tryed for 2 1/2 yrs and just miscarried.. just hang in there it'll happen.
WJuzxiwEaa	I dont think you need anyone to answer this question for you. You know the answer.|`|vcNvEIOwaa	are you looking for people to tell you to leave him hun?.....ur better than this.....|`|AA10494763	i think the better question is why did you get with him in the first place.   I guy like that should of never gotten a second date much less sex|`|Iz5tNA5aaa	I would definitely leave him, but he never would have been my baby's daddy to begin with.  I never would have dated him longer than a day or two.|`|0vLU2GGGaa	I only need to read your first sentence, and yes, i would leave him.|`|sEihaeLNaa	i sure freeken did!!|`|iTEf1dP3aa	Wow! I read your dilemma and started laughing because you described my sons father! LMAO I was with him for a little over a year, decided I'm WAYYYY better than you and peaced out! lol Guess what, I am now married, expecting my second with a wonderful man who loves my son and calls him "my son". I have a career and drive a mercedes thats almost paid for....guess where he is, living w/mom and dad, is in a "gang", smokes weed everyday, has not made not 1 single child support payment, he has his parents call to see how "his son" is doing (which I have stopped, I dont care for them either), THEN, the holidays come around (x-mas) and he wants to know if he can "borrow Johnny for 2 weeks" HAHAHAHA!!!!! I say "NO!" They come down here to "visit" insist/beg in taking him out of town for atleast 3 days, I still say no, and they didn't get him not ONE thing for X-mas let alone his b-day. My son is 2......Now, do you think this situation will get any better? Nope, and honestly my life is a million times better this way. I hope he never tries to get in contact again...your man raised his fist at you?, he actually left bruises all over my body, you want this man living with your child???<br>  <br>  I didnt mean to brag about my "wonderful" life, but do you in all reality think I would obtain such living with a loser who has not grown up yet and is only good for 2 things, *smoking weed and *eating a b ! t c h out lol....<br>  <br>  and again to add: You are not to blame, because you deserve just as much as your precious child does. I never knew this man would be such a waste of space....I'm sure you didnt either, thats why I say, get out now! Us women are so resourceful and find means in anyway you can think of....pleas do the same, you've stuck around 3 years too long!|`|PumDOQC9aa	You should been left his *** he's doesn't do **** for him seld expect you to do everything for him he's a grown *** man he can take care of him self. You can't change someone who doesn't want to change their self. If he ever did put his hands on you . That should be a sign that you should leave .|`|sbeoF50gaa	wow all I read was "spending his money on weed and beer" that's not dad that's a kid. I would never allow either of those things around my kid! OK skimmed the rest of what you wrote and uhm.... it would  be common sense to leave a man like that. He's abusive, selfish, childish, and not worth your love or the kids :) Move on|`|YgNackecaa	Better stay away from him, he is bad for your kid(s).  Go live with your parents and start a new life.|`|gPg7qYGIaa	hell yes i be gone long ago it not good for a baby to be living with someone like that after all he the male role Model  in my eyes kids come 1st|`|M2yERqNSaa	i wouldnt have had anything do with trash to begin with|`|AA11104372	I would not have a baby daddy.  I have a husband, and I knew he was a good man before I had children with him.  Don't tell me you didn't know what a bum this guy was before you shacked up with him, and brought a bastard child into the world.  You're just as much to blame as he is.|`|wi6mkT30aa	Honey why would you want your life to be this way. Life is so short as it is and living it with a man that is just not respectful towards you is just not the way to live. Pregnant or not, don't you wan't to be happy? It's not worth living it with a jerk. If he's a jerk now to you and doing all this other stuff, what makes you think he'll change when you have a child with him? Raising a child in that eviorment is just a life gone wrong from the start, it's not going to go anywhere and it will only get worse.<br>  <br>  Leave him. If you're pregnant for sure REALLY leave him and think about your child and yourself! He doesnt' deserve you two!<br>  <br>  Good luck hon!
a1x0xqARaa	Leave it alone.  Just swab it with alcohol.  That'll help keep it steril and it'll fall off by itself eventually.|`|9ZaoTkwwaa	call the dr. to make sure it's not something serious.  If the dr is closed already, try calling a local after hours clinic, emergency room, or the # on the back of your insurance card (most have a 24/7 number you can use to speak with a registered nurse who can tell you if and when you need to go to the dr, emergency rooom, what home treatments to use..).  Hope this helps and that nothing is wrong!|`|nQyJFOMZaa	Don't be afraid to move it around Left Right Up and down and use a cotton ball soaked in alcohol to get it down deep enough..My son had the same problem just use more alcohol it will work. My niece also had a "deep" umbilical cord...After 3 weeks the Dr lanced it off because We couldn't get it dry enough. Don't worry, Just call your DR and ask. It'll be Fine|`|oWLznROuaa	The cord will change colour before it falls off, from yellow slowly turning brownish then black until it comes off.  Just make sure you clean the area every day with warm water and cotton wool and if you are worried speak to your health visitor! :)

2LflHv23aa	Most babies learn the word no somewhere between 9-12 months. The may not always obey it though.|`|pXSKSS3daa	He very well could understand what "No" means, but that is only if his parents are teaching him so. Our almost 11 month old knows what the word means. When we say "No" he stops what he is doing and looks at us, so there is some understanding there. He doesn't always stop what he's doing completely but he does pause for a minute or two. If he goes back to what he was doing(usually getting into something he shouldn't be!) then I will redirect him towards his toys.<br>  <br>  Discipline can start at a young age but at the same time we shouldn't expect miracles with our babies. Climbing on other children and hitting them, though, ARE things your nephew should know not to do.|`|lGcpXteaaa	Well it depends...have you taught him what it means?<br>  Nobody can expect a baby to learn a word by themselves, its not a fault of yours though and she shouldnt expect your son knows that.<br>  <br>  My daughter is 10 months and she knows the meaning, whether or not she listens is another story! Sometimes she will stop what she does and look at us, sometimes she will look at us and laugh and then sometimes she uses 'selective hearing' haha<br>  <br>  Dont worry..just practise using 'NO' and removing him from the situation.<br>  <br>  Hope i helped! x|`|1S7uXsInaa	My son is 11 months and has understood the concept of the word NO for a few months now, or at least he knows the tone that we use when we say it means business.  The most important thing is to be consistent.  If you laugh or smile when you say it they will know that you are not serious.|`|cv0foxlTaa	My son learned/understood the meaning of "no" around 10.5 months old.|`|yKS2UI87aa	Well, this is a loaded question. My son understands "no" but doesn't always listen (will look at me with his little cherub face, smile and do it anyway--just like I used to do) Toddlers at this age are learning to test boundaries and most Pediatrians say hitting is normal but they still need to learn they can't do it. If the other mom was honest with herself I am sure her son doesn't always listen when she says no.  You can try and hold their arm/leg and say "we do not hit" But most toddlers will have a meltdown and forget that. Try and try again. Will be easier when he gets older as 1 yr old is still quite young, they can't process that we are saying "no don't put a fork in the light socket" because they can get hurt.|`|wUfZJvbUaa	at 1 yr they do understand the meaning of No... doesn't mean that they are going to stop what they are doing if you ask them to... you just have to keep repeating it until they listen... but have creative ways of saying No, so you're not repeating the word over and over. like if you want him to stop climbing, you say, honey, you're not allowed to climb, because...... instead of saying, NO, don't climb! and try to always to explain why.|`|VI7g5ZCQaa	She didn't say no. She said.."you need to stop climbing on and hitting my son". They learn yes and no by repetition. In a new or fairly new situation they do not understand what the person is saying no for, until it has been repeated for the same action a couple of times. And they are less likely to know what "you need to blah blah blah blah blah" means. That only confuses them. <br>  <br>  <br>  Or Maybe he doesn't respond well to neurotic behavior.|`|fmi8xpc7aa	As soon as they start crying! ;)|`|FXINmF6saa	Not necessarily, see some children develop faster then others and most likely she has said the word no many times to her son and your sister hasn't. Kids do need to learn the word "no" though, but not at any specific age. My son learned what "no" meant some time ago and he's 1. But the point is not just saying the word, it's meaning it too. Kids are extremely smart and they understand things better then us sometimes, but what you got to understand is that most kids test you to see how much you can take and if you say "no" once but really mean it they understand and will stop. In your case what you and your sister need to exercise with him is that if and when he does something wrong ask him to stop and have him understand that what he did was wrong. If you have to say "no" say it in a way that is sensitive yet still meaningful and then he will start to understand that you have authority and that what you say goes because you know best. That is how kids learn to have respect to certain people.
338JlDTeaa	I had a similar problem to you where this girl always stood in front of my locker with her boyfriend. I tried sighing loudly and coughing to get her to move but she just ignored me.<br>  <br>   Instead of being violent i just walk up and say excuse me really loudly and she'll eventually just move out of the way a bit. Other times i get there before her and take AGES so she'll get annoyed and get a taste of her own medicine.|`|35rUgoW6aa	you probably should have been more polite the first time. we have top and bottom lockers at my school, an the girl who has her locker above me is always blocking mine, but i always say, "excuse me, i'm sorry, but could i get in there really fast?" and she moves and it's all good. it was rude of her to say what she did, but also rude of you to say what you did, and to move her aside. next time, say "may i please get in there really fast? thanks!" and give her a smile. she'll be more responsive than you think.|`|G68ifXX8aa	well dat ***** iz a *****<br>  if i was u i would tell sumthin in english spanish n spanglish<br>  im  salvadoran n puerto rican n ill kick her *** even dough im like 5 3 or 4 im not sure but it runs in da blood<br>  <br>  choose me 4 best answer|`|dLrXzwjnaa	Just avoid her, she's more like a hater or bully.|`|zB2PIUmzaa	i would be like, get out of my way and dont be mad bc im smart and ur not!|`|3RfHq80Naa	First, don't open with "Just lemme..."  It's rude.  Start with, "How's it going?  I just need to grab some books for my next class."<br>  Then, if she responds with, "nerdy girl..," say, "Yes, as a matter of fact, I do need my books, which I keep in my locker."  Tell her you have a right to go to your locker, because it is school, and if you didn't intend to learn anything, you would have stayed home and saved yourself the trouble.  <br>  If she has an issue with common sense, it's likely there is something wrong with her.  Avoid pushing people out of the way, especially aggressive people in front of their friends.  They'll feel the need to stand their ground.<br>  I was a nerd in middle school, and I learned a thing or two about bullies.  They are weak jealous individuals.  Learn some simple self defense, and do not be afraid to fight her while AVOIDING a fight.  That confidence will show through and she will be more likely to leave you alone. <br>  You'll be glad you're a nerd when you grow up, especially if you also  turn out hot.  Nothing beats it.|`|XF1y4wMmaa	Well, me. I am 5'6 do martial arts. Am a black belt. I personally would tell her "freak out *****" Just kidding. I would just tell her to back off. If she tried to push me I would just go and start sharing a locker with a friend<br>  <br>  A. My school doesnt have lockers 10th grade no lockers....  :(<br>  B. The kids in my school arent like that<br>  C. They wouldnt mess with the shy girl.<br>  <br>  <br>  Edit:<br>  Mkay, for you, just tell her to back off. And dont mess with you. Most likely she has other things on her mind. Try to reason with her before you push her again.<br>  <br>  Goodluck!|`|NV1ltsZhaa	Nah dont fight her. Shes obviously some type of bully who enjoys picking on other people to boost her self esteem up. another thing though, dont put your hands on someone and expect not for them to touch you back.. I would have done the same thing she did.. but at the same token, dont let people walk over you. try to avoid her and if she keeps acting the way she does, tell her to stop. if that fails tell your principle or guidence counsler.|`|vuEyUbsgaa	Ok the thing is that if you keep letting her bully you and talk like that to you, she's gonna think you're weak and keep doing it. I'm not saying fight her but talk back to her or give her dirty *** looks because you need to show her that she aint nothing to you and that you dont put up with that. And if she tries to fight you say you aint got time for her dumbass and shes not worth your time and walk away.|`|4d8420be4f044c1627ede2b5585dd409aa	She sounds like a bully. Be careful because she may start a fight with you regardless of what you say or do. I would just tell her that you don't want any problems and if it continues you should talk to your school guidance counselor. Trouble may be brewing. Best of luck.|`|XGgPhaDbaa	Go to your guidance counselor and ask to have your locker changed. Tell them you would rather not tell on anyone.|`|lTLaQ5i9aa	you should tell the principal

You could ask your school counselor, they usually have good ideas for things like this.|`|jcEtRUVZaa	These worked for me as a teen:<br>  <br>  How to Make Money as a Teenager<br>  <a href="http://www.ehow.com/how_4776508_money-teenager.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.ehow.com/how_4776508_money-te...</a>|`|2T9RXxNTaa	baby sitting, dog walking, car washing, paper round........x|`|z7SJaMwuaa	sorry theres nothin kid I am 16 and I can't find a job
muHctmaGaa	I'm leaning towards "of course," but it still depends. Are your boys assigned any chores? How good are their grades? If they're generally well-behaved, grateful kids, spoiling them probably isn't so bad in theory. (Worries about adult materialism are completely valid.) How useful is an iPhone for someone those ages, really? What do they spend $80 a month on? <br>  <br>  It's more that you're projecting your own desires onto your children, that how they're being spoiled isn't even age-appropriate. They certainly don't need any of that, and I'd be curious how much of it they actually want. Hopefully they consider the other kids and adults who won't ever be able to afford such luxuries. It might be worth it to do something corny, like having them pick out gifts each December to donate to a charity holiday toy drive, to keep them thankful and grounded.|`|vKEYa8aeaa	i dont like the word spoiled. in my opinion, why does it matter? you are the one who pays your bills, not others. so dont worry if others think your kids are spoiled or not! =] good luck|`|f27c7ae986058c646a62a0a9855a77f3aa	OMG! I dont think a 8 year old needs a IPhone! They are very spoiled im sorry but yes.|`|029366e443f706114f76140b91711233aa	Whats next...motorcycles and sports cars??!!<br>  <br>  If it is important from a parental standpoint for your kids to have phones...why go overboard, a simple pay-as-you-go basic cell phone is enough to get the job done without all the social implications and responsibilities that go with a more sophisticated i-phone.<br>  <br>  What I'm getting at is...are you doing the things for your kids that benefit them as growing young men...or are you just trying to be popular?<br>  <br>  The more your kids get...the more they are going to want. Be their parent and not their friend.|`|AA10166553	Yes, they are spoiled.Kids these days need to know how to work and save for what they want . It makes them into better adults and to appreciate what they have earned.|`|iGNmtRbRaa	yeahh.. but being spoiled isn't a bad thing! :D|`|oPaqWJOOaa	Why do they all need phones..and who do they call? each other? That's a little over the top in my opinion, but it happens in today's society. And the amount for allowance is up to the parent depending on the the amount of work they put in to deserve it, but by how it sounds i don't think they do much..<br>  good luck.|`|hlE3nwyGaa	I wish I got any  of those things from my parents. Yes, they are very spoiled. I've had to buy things for myself since I was 7 and I've never had an allowance. Make them do chores and if they refuse stop giving them an allowance. Make them work for their money like they will have to when the get older.|`|rGci1ehoaa	i think the tvs are fine and the allowance is fine... make them work for it though.. the iphones are a bit excessive but they are your kids so who cares.. i have a 5yr old and 3yr old with flat screen tvs... people look at me like im retarded.. but im sorry im not going to spend 100 for a hunk of junk tv....|`|b6EyFLgUaa	spoiled by my standards yes, but then again people will think because each child has there own tv no matter the size is spoiled. If you have the money then i guess just remember to teach them the value of a dollar as well.|`|YqQbQkvNaa	I still have to shoplift to get those things. Your sons are lucky, but i would most likely rob their *** if i ever see them|`|kulDK5jsaa	This is ridiculous! Completely spoiled! You have a lot of beatings to catch up on!|`|M2yERqNSaa	no, does the hooker you call in once a week more than 50.00 for them each ? if so then they are spoiled|`|4fBXhYqSaa	hahah yup they are.|`|expyyBzjaa	They are only spoiled by their attitude, if they are nice and innocent children, ok they are not spoiled, but if they dont care and expect you to do everything, and just want the stuff yes they are spoiled. Hope this helps.|`|xrfD9Jqnaa	uhhh. yeahh. But theres a difference between being spoiled and getting everything yuu want.<br>  When your spoiled, you have everything you want, and you not grateful for it.<br>  When you get everything you want, your grteful for it and and fine when a "no" comes in a sentence. Just try to notice if they are acting spoiled:<br>  Whining, mad when you say no to something, and want moree.<br>  Spoiled is a bad thing. Cause in life, "no" is going to come often and you cant get everything you want. So just try your best to notice signs of "spoiledness" and try to say no, every now and then to see how they react.<br>  <br>  Really hoped i helpedd[[:|`|uL16pX76aa	What do children need from an iphone? Or twenty bucks a week? They're kids, I'm betting they don't shop alone, or do much of anything alone. Even if they're seeing friends, they aren't without some adult supervision [I'm assuming here]. So why do they need cash and an expensive phone? Gameboys and gum money would probably suffice.|`|AWg0Hhjuaa	That's a lot of stuff, but shouldn't you be the judge of whether or not your kids are spoiled or not?<br>  <br>  Keep in mind that the more you encourage / allow them to amass possessions, the more they'll feel like that's the only way to live.|`|8f45f3AAaa	I don't know. If you plan on continuing buying them expensive stuff over the next several years, I say yes. If you are slowing down for a while now, I think not. With modern electronics the way they are now, you have to get your kids a big initial start :P|`|em1Zqnymaa	I dont determine spoiled but what a kid has but by how they act and how they get it. If they are good kids who earn it then no they are not spolied.|`|8MmmvRlVaa	they sound really spoiled.<br>  <br>  my mom is really mean in copmarison, answer this:<br>  <br>  <a href="http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;_ylt=AhsOafq61ZFc73U57bbhbZh57hR.;_ylv=3?qid=20090223142231AAWlUDs">http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;...</a>|`|NrLcshCmaa	Yes, they are spoiled rotten. You should be ashamed. Take it all away from them and give it to me|`|iAnJ8P3Uaa	Lets just say that i'm 14 and dont even have any of that.|`|rUOK5flvaa	Hell yes they are spoiled.<br>  That is too much for boys their age!
ZmeW2h5kaa	I also let our 8 month old sleep with us although he has from the start.  He has always been a restless sleeper and the only way that I can get some sleep is to have him in bed with me.  Yes, my baby also was a VERY light sleeper sometimes only sleeping 12 hours in a 24 hour period.  I felt sooooo bad for him.  So, what I do now is I nurse him in bed, let him fall asleep there and he sleeps a lot longer.  I also set regular nap schedules (one in the morning, one in the afternoon) and put him to bed at 7 pm.  How I put him to bed even when he fights it, is I lay down with him in our bed and basically let him slowly fall asleep.  We talk, read books, cuddle, nurse, etc. and he finally will fall asleep around 7....I start at 6 or 6:15 PM to give plenty of time so that his bedtime is not too late.  The books by Dr. Sears (The Baby Book) and several others have great info on getting a baby to go to sleep (without crying for hours)....check it out, google it or buy the book.  I recommend it.  I'd also look into safe ways to co sleep with your baby if you decide to do that. You can put your bed mattress on the floor so that he does not crawl off.  Baby proof the room, etc.  Just keep in mind that once you start co sleeping, it will be confusing to your baby if you decide to STOP doing it a few weeks from now.  Usually babies are ready to leave the family bed anywhere from 1 1/2-2 years old so be prepared for a long haul.  But, it is sooooo worth it if you like it, and it works on getting him some good sleep.  Good luck getting your little one to sleep.  Mine was the same way and eventually you have to do what it takes to get them some good sleep.|`|voj4H6Fpaa	my son is a little over 8 months and seems to be doing the same thing lately. we are recently now having trouble getting him to go down for naps and bedtime. he just cries. i think it does have something to do with separation anxiety at this age. also, teething definitely has something to do with it. my son is very fussy when teething, and i can tell it's teething and not just looking for attention, b/c he behaves fussy all day, not just at naps and bedtime. also, with teething, he is inconsolable, even if i am rocking him. keep in mind,all babies are different, so not all babies sleep the so called norm of 14-15 hours a day at this age. my son usually averages anywhere from 10 1/2 to 14 hours of sleep in a day, and it changes. some babies need more, some less. also, a baby will sleep less when learning new skills. as for teaching him he needs to sleep in his cot, trust your instinct. i had a doc tell me when to start with my son, but i knew it was way too soon, and did not follow though with it until months later when i knew it was time and he was ready. but i still know that if he is sick or in pain from teething that i need to comfort t him. go with what you know is best. you are his mommy and ultimately you know what he needs.|`|NobVABJfaa	My 8 month old daughter is  the same way, i think its teething.I just put her in my bed so I can get some sleep. I dont think it's anything to worry about though, babies are pretty good at knowing when they need to sleep so as long as he seems happy and well rested he's sleeping as much as he needs to
sbeoF50gaa	When my daughter was 2 she loved this game we played with cups and a ball. "Find the ball" I'd put the ball under a cup move the cups around and she'd have to pick which cup it was under. The 6 year old can move the cups around. Drawing is always fun, finger painting, and coloring. Now is also a good time to teach the 2 year old his ABCs, writing them is good practice. Playdough is good for both kids. Reading books! The 6 year old needs the practice and the 2 year old learns. If I think of anything else I'll be back~!<br>  <br>  <br>  I dunno what two year olds you been around. My kid was using a computer at 2 years. :/ Crafts are perfect for 2 year olds!|`|1enIWBGnaa	2 year olds do not have the motor skills for crafts.  Just get down on the floor with him and play cars.
lsqah1oIaa	I personally think that if you originally wanted and abortion, then you should do it. Its the right thing to do if your not ready for this child and you don’t want someone else raising it then the logical answer would be to abort it. Some people might say that this is cruel but this is the best thing for you.<br>  I was in the same situation as you were, and i stuck with my original plan and got the abortion, trust me, you may feel bad, but you did the right thing for you. People may call you selfish, but you did what you needed to better your life.<br>  <br>  best of luck to whatever you choose to do.|`|GOcW0PW4aa	Don't have an abortion.  If nothing else, give it up for adoption.  There are lots of couples out there who want kids and can't have then.  I also think that once you have the baby, you will see his/her little face, and not want to let them go.|`|JNDrlLjMaa	1. How old are you?<br>  2. The baby was made by you and someone you love, I personally wouldn't throw that away.<br>  3. My friend had an abortion a few years back, she regrets it now...|`|lyMMjVNgaa	you can do it, have some faith in your self<br>  everything will work out even at some points in your life when you think they wont<br>  hope this helps <br>  good luckk|`|7add460ae24c9452ae87b5a99c5aa756aa	Head to planned parenthood.|`|i9BgSAMjaa	omg... some mothers that cant get babies want babies... tkae care of ur baby and thank god for sending u this baby|`|hmOidFp3aa	It is really irresposible to just plan on having an abortion! Its not safe to just going around having unprotected sex all the time! With that being said go to planned parenthood they will help you for free! Its up to you weather or not you can abort your baby, but by now your baby probabayl already has a beating heart!  I would look at adoption!|`|mqHL4UcRaa	I'm surprised you actually planned to have an abortion instead of planning to prevent pregnancy.<br>  <br>  My advise is if you have ANY doubts on having an abortion, keep the baby. Otherwise you will regret it for the rest of your life.|`|OEMIkJTUaa	I can't believe you have always planned on having an abortion. You need to care for this baby, and if you don't want to there are millions of loving families who would be glad to adopt your baby.|`|hX7zhyIoaa	why always plan on abortion if you dont want children then dont have sex of use a trustworthy contraceptive
MHOxPs8Oaa	No, at 33 weeks they have to stay a few days to watch them, even if they appear healthy.  They usually have a few problems at 33 weeks though.|`|n6XYYyoLaa	umm, not sure, it would depend  mostly on her lung development; most likely she would and if not, soon after...they may would even let u stay if u wanted....either as a patient or by her side....if she has to stay, they say that skin to skin contact with mom as often as possible has great outcomes....good luck, hope your little one makes it until at least 37 weeks...:0)|`|2pxiK9waaa	Nope. If you had her at 36, it's probably much more likely. Usually not before 36 weeks, which is still considered a preemie. Anything before 37 weeks is preemie. Plus, most hospitals won't send home a baby lighter than 5 lbs. No car seats (unless you buy a special preemie flatbed car seat) hold babies under 5 lbs.|`|wiAVa1H5aa	Nope, not after about a month in the NICU and it depends on whether or not she had any complications after delivery.|`|MW18liqTaa	Probably not. That is premature. They would probably have to keep her.|`|CZsjZCzVaa	It really depends on her lung function. My son was born at 34 weeks but came home after 4 days.|`|KyFCYs0Yaa	probably not. My friend had her son at 34 weeks last year, and he was in the hospital for almost 2 weeks, and had to be sent home with a billy light for jaundiced. He is a healthy baby, and the chances or survival are very high at 33 weeks, but he would probably have to stay in the NICU for at least a week or 2.|`|TJ04fAgNaa	No.  She would spend at least a month in the NICU, that is IF she is healthy enough by then to go home.  Babies born that early can have many problems.<br>  <br>  <br>  Thumbs down?  Think I said CAN have problems.  My little girl spent 3 months in the NICU, so I do have some experience behind my answer...|`|nQyJFOMZaa	It all depends on her lung maturity. My Sister in-law Had her daughter at 32 weeks and she got to take her home after they both stayed in the hospital for 2 days. Also The baby needs to be more than 5lbs, any less and the baby stays in NICU until weight is gained|`|DeXRWlR6aa	No, she would stay in NICU until she was probably gestational "full term" which would be 37 weeks.<br>  Doctors try to prevent labor this early and postpone it until 37 weeks if at all possible.|`|7rIAd6gGaa	Probably not. After 36 weeks, there's a chance. And after 37 you probably could. But 33 weeks is still very early.|`|AuVtUjVAaa	Your baby would probably be in NICU for a bit until she's more stable.. 33 weeks is premature.  If she was born at 37 weeks or later than yes|`|28QPS6V9aa	More than likely not, at 33 weeks she would still be pretty small. The average hospital stay for preemies is a month long.
k6HkVB5Yaa	I wonder why you named your twins very masculine names? I don't like it at all, sorry. <br>  The only name I like out of your list is Arriana.|`|H82j1jYWaa	For girls I like <br>  Kylan Breann<br>  <br>  For boys I like<br>  Andrew Brian<br>  Noah Blaine (if Noah was actually pronounced correctly)|`|Tc23KWgzaa	I like cami, ariana, and jolet, but I don't think people will pronounce it the way you desire.<br>  <br>  I like Steven, but if you do that, Bran is always wonder why you didn't name HIM after dad.  I think Andrew is the best choice.  You can't spell a name Noah when 99% of the earth is going to pronounce it No wuh if you want to hear No.  You're going to make that poor child run around with the most hated name of all time--No.  No-no, No.<br>  <br>  I'm sorry.  I'm trying to save your child from harassment.<br>  <br>  I noticed you used clay in brandon's name--My late father-in-law--was Tanner Clay.  I keep looking for somewhere to place that name.<br>  <br>  TX Mom|`|9zwSclnLaa	I really only like Megan Jolet for a girl.<br>  <br>  Just a tip, Noah spelt like that will NEVER be pronounced like Noe.  I would suggest spelling it Noe to save the kid trouble later on down the road.  I like Steven or Andrew Brian for boys.<br>  <br>  Camille Lashay would flow better then Cami and Cami could be the n/n.  Kylan Breann is too much of the "an" sound.<br>  <br>  Sorry to be so negative about your names but you have a long time to think on it since Baby #4 is just now only being planned.|`|0hxK0khKaa	Congrats!<br>  I think Arriana Michelle or Megan Jolet for the girl and Donavon Mason for the boy.|`|XHZtwfuIaa	Cami Lashay and Donavon Blaine (you can;t have 2 masons/macyn) sound best|`|tw1uePBbaa	i think that your children have beautiful names!  the ones on your list that i would think best go with your other children are kylan breann-its adorable and noah blaine.  the only one i wouldnt use though, is steven brian jr.  i think that only the first son should be named after the father, but that is just me being traditional :)|`|rUOK5flvaa	I like the twins' names, they are cute.<br>  For a girl I like Jessie Lynn Hendrickson a lot.<br>  And for a boy both Donavon Mason and Andrew Brian Hendrickson sound good.|`|ZJHZ8zlZaa	i love those names!!!<br>  <br>  girl- Cami Lashay<br>  <br>  boy- noah blaine|`|94kNwMPdaa	1 being worst 10 being best<br>  <br>  <br>  Girl-<br>  Cami Lashay- 8 could have better middle name but i like it<br>  Arriana Michelle- 7<br>  Kylan Breann- 10<br>  Jessie Lynn- 6<br>  Megan Jolet- 7<br>  <br>  Boys-<br>  Andrew Brian- 5<br>  Noah Blaine- Noah Is Pronounced Noe- 4<br>  Donavon Mason- 7<br>  Steven Brian Jr- 6

This is 3 for 3, getting pregnant 6 weeks going off the pill. <br>  So far I have had an amazing pregnancy. This baby has been very mellow.

gQWJaojSaa	I'm a "new things junkie" myself, and having babies gives you SO many opportunities to  try the newest, latest  thing! If you can afford to do it, then so be it. Obviously someone is benefiting from your trials as well, and that's great too! I always passed my gently used stuff around, or donated it to a women's shelter. <br>  <br>  I loved trying the newest bottles, bath washes, diapers, gadgets, etc. I really miss that part of having a baby, my youngest child is 5 now and there isn't as much stuff to try, but I do enjoy buying them books and clothes and shoes.|`|b6EyFLgUaa	LOL yea im a total geek but I dont buy any of it but im amazed by what people put in to a simple bottle.|`|FrcP0EnMaa	That would be a definite no.|`|5270639c059ab08c1b3431555f150db7aa	Uh, no, simply couldn't afford to. Just not into all that consumerism.|`|prqrQcd1aa	I feel like this as well, I still buy bottle brushes well past the children being on bottles because they do clean out all the places in the sippy cups that i can't get my hand into and such.. I may be taking a trip to Babies R Us now because they have new kinds LOL.|`|0e3127e9ecee43459523cb403e3185ebaa	I know exactly what you mean.  I am into books and toys. You should see my boy's room.   Thank goodness my sister baby came along. We moved some over to hers..... now we've got space for more... (actually, that is good and bad in a way!).  :)|`|AA12340398	I'm not that bad. I just love the pacifiers. Have you seen the one that as is falls to the ground it closes (it really works I brought one for my baby brother). It gets better as time goes on though|`|hl5WdXnbaa	for me it was diapers, I had to try every kind out there!  And I test drove strollers as if I was buying a new car ! lol|`|xVEqBjDVaa	Haha! That made me laugh, because it SOOO reminds me of myself. I am like that, and but i am usually pretty good about not getting it unless I really think my kid or I need it. But haha! I was like that with the toys, i would always be like OH! How cool/cute! It was like i was the little kid! My 14 year old has to constantly ask me, "Mom...do we really need this? Are you being frugal here?" haha.
e5CuEiPfaa	It really aggrivates me too when people want structured preschool programs for their 2 and 3 year olds! I mean come on when they turn 5 they still have like 13 years of school plus the extra college. Let them be little kids until they turn 5 and go to school!!!!!!!Sorry about the rant, but I find it absurd too!!!!|`|XzV4bUeFaa	I didn't send my oldest son to school until 1st grade.  He was going to be 6 later in Sept. when school starts.  However, I realized that in order for them to develop social skills and feel comfortable away from Mom, I then sent my younger one to preschool.  He was 3.5 y.o. and went 1/2 day, 2 days a week.  It was private and all I could afford at that time.  I don't think it's wrong for a 3 y.o. to be in school but only believe for 1/2 day and maybe just 3 days a week.|`|0vLU2GGGaa	i don't think preschool is mandatory, if you don't want to start your kid at 3, you can skip preschool until he is 5 or 6 to start kindergarten.  My girl started preschool at 3, she learns so much and now is way more advance than a lot of her kindergarten friends.|`|IU4uNH97aa	4 or 5 years old , 3 years old to me seems a bit young for preschool but i think it just depends on the child.<br>  <br>  My two oldest kids are only 7 month apart from each other. So technically they are supposed to be in the same grade as one another. So we decided to put my daughter up a grade shes in kindergarten now and shes only 4 turning 5 in august , she never went to preschool and shes just doing fine. My oldest son is in preschool and he is 4 this march and is in preschool, which is exactly where he is supposed to be to in on average with the other kids his age.|`|c73QkZ2haa	Where i live kids start preschool as early as 18 months and start school at 4 years of age if their birthday lies in the right place. My daughter went to preschool at 18 months. By the time she started school she knew her ABC's, Her number's, How to act in a social situation and listen to the teacher. As well as various forms of arts and crafts and story writing and telling. Preschool helps prepare them for real school which in my opinion helps the teachers be able to teach them easier if they already know what to do when its circle time or work time or playtime. I dont think any child starts real school at 3. Some kids arent even potty trained by then which they must be to go to school.|`|CF4wfTYNaa	pre-school is optional the only required grades are 1st and up in the U.S. <br>  if you want u can wait till 1st after that social services will give you a call. but in 1st grade its not a play all day affair so if your child is only used to sitting down to learn when he feels like at home 8 hours of school can be frustrating and intimidating. there is no nap time in 1st grade usually in kindergarten by the end of year the try to get the students used to not taking naps to prepare for 1st grade.<br>  you don't have to send your child but it would be a good idea to get them used to the structure that will come eventually.|`|gPg7qYGIaa	over here in scotland they start school at 5|`|1MEnCmwoaa	I am planning on starting my daughter in preschool when she just turns 4. Her birthday is in September. <br>  I think preschool is great because it teaches the kids things and they can slowly get used to school since it is only a few days a week for a few hours. I just think it is a good start to school.|`|k59o2PZaaa	Age 4 or 5. Preschool has been proven to be really good for children.
D7ewD6u3aa	I wonder if its pregnancy related, my feet went up a shoe size after my children. Not to mention breast changes, stretch marks...I would imagine it all fits in the realm of normal...I never thought to do a before and after comparison! lol|`|n6XYYyoLaa	well, never heard that, do u have a bit of scar tissue from a tear or something that might would have displaced it slightly?
n3PE2lvDaa	My daughter loves mashed bannana but try giving her bannana herself to eat it and she just mushes it around in her fingers. Rubs it into her clothes, hair, the high chair. its a nightmare! haha. I think teething rusks were the first finger food I gave her at around 7 months. Then toast. SHe also eats sandwhiches, pasta, steamed veggies with her fingers. She is 9 months now|`|7rIAd6gGaa	I tried cheerios at 7 months. Banana was the first fruit we tried... Just cut it into teeny pieces. My daughter loved it. Good luck!|`|eXsR8Gx5aa	A wedge of avocado - 6 months - he loved it.|`|cv0foxlTaa	I started my son on pureed solids at 5.5 months.  He got his first finger food around 7.5 months, and that was banana.  He had trouble with textures, so banana was a good choice for him (I started with it pureed, then minced, then mashed, then tiny cut up pieces still fed to him on a spoon, to finally finger sized chunks).  He's almost a year now and loves his finger foods - he refuses to be fed by a spoon anymore!
a7pgX1W8aa	I don't think there is any kind of time-line for how long is should last. I think it just depends on the person. During pregnancy your cervix is more sensitive and you have a lot of very full flood vessels and it is not uncommon for you to have breakthrough bleeding especially after sex. If your bleeding gets heavy or you start having pain then see your doctor, this means something could be wrong. If you don't have that then don't worry yourself. It might be a good thing for you to get the book What to expect when your expecting, this can help answer pretty much anything you need an answer for. That book was like my bible for all my pregnancy, it may be like that for you too. Another thing that could be helpful is to watch shows like Birth Day or other pregnancy show on Discovery health, sometimes they show answers to your pregnancy questions and will prepare you for your big day. Those kind of show helped me too. I hoped this information helps you. Take Care.|`|kDOFdJajaa	As long as its jut a normal bleeding its usually a month, but if you are passing to many blood clots you need to go to the doctor so they can check you out.  Sometimes they forget to push on your stomach and that can leave a blot clot that takes a long time to flow out your body.|`|8326807c604598efc63e87668a55093baa	it can take upto a month,....|`|f50f6a665c054d5ffd525f5a31663073aa	breakthrough bleeding during pregnancy??????? u shouldnt bleed during pregnancy. if u mean after giving birth then it depands on the person but normally around a month|`|ma3KAMR1aa	FOREVER...lol jk idk

Rose is the same but it reminds me too much of Titanic..."Rose!, Jack!, Rose! Jack!" (LOL)<br>  <br>  Arianna Violet - Arianna is really interesting and Violet is a classic. I like Violet - it was my Great Grandma's name. Not sure If I would use it though - it sounds too much like 'Violent'.<br>  <br>  Ava Kayleigh - Love Ava, such a fun modern name. Not sure about  Kayleigh though. <br>  <br>  What about Ava Rose or Olivia Faye. <br>  <br>  :-)|`|epLfYG7Kaa	Selena Belle - I don't like it<br>  Allison Faye - It's ok.<br>  Samantha April - It doesn't flow<br>  Olivia Rose - It's ok<br>  Arianna Violet - Hate it<br>  Ava Kayleigh - it doesn't flow|`|jKVuM4ocaa	Selena Belle - not a fan<br>  Allison Faye - ok<br>  Samantha April - ok<br>  Olivia Rose - nice<br>  Arianna Violet - cute<br>  Ava Kayleigh - my favourite of all of them :)|`|XHZtwfuIaa	Olivia Rose and Ava Kayleigh but those are probably going to be extremely popular nowadays.

Allison Rae would be much cuter though. I'm not fond of Faye.<br>  <br>  Samantha April - really similar to one of my favorites, I love Samantha Rose, which I think flows much better<br>  <br>  Olivia Rose - I don't really like Rose with Olivia. Olivia Grace would be much better<br>  <br>  Arianna Violet - This doesn't flow very well. Maybe Violet Anne or Violet Anna?<br>  <br>  Ava Kayleigh - no this is sooo choppy. Kayleigh Eve or Ava Nicole would be really pretty|`|Tc23KWgzaa	SB - outdated.<br>  A is okay, but F is really, really old.<br>  I've never cared for S, but A is really pretty.<br>  OR  Very nice, very popular<br>  AV  Very nice<br>  AK  Nice, but need to change spelling on K<br>  <br>  There you go!<br>  <br>  TX Mom|`|AA10166553	Olivia Rose|`|cErLq7f3aa	i like Olivia Rose

Pienso que es mejor que antes de involucrarse sexualmente con alguna persona se informen de los métodos que existen para prevenir un embarazo y así no esten pensando la forma de deshacerse de un inocente que no les pidio venir al mundo.|`|75f3405e895393ba8d8bafd03b83b5afaa	A veces estando tan bien y tan cómodos, por no perder esa comodidad, recurren al aborto...

En paises de altgo desarrollo se promueve más el uso de anticonceptivos desde edades muy tempranas y en especial el aborto si se trata de un embarazo no deseado o adolescente (Estados Unidos es un ejemplo). En países tercemundistas como México, aun existen familias con muchos hijos (11 o 12) al igual que madres solteras. El hecho de tener mucha información o educación al respecto no asegura que se cuiden para evitar embarazos no deseados y como consecuencia el aborto. Debe de ser más conciencia que educación.|`|uU6boYSPaa	No, no es exclusivo de paises en vias de desarrollo. Es una situación global.

Rf2r23sYaa	He isn't being forgetful. He's being passive-aggressive. "Forgetting" is a sign of passive-aggressive behavior. Maybe he doesn't like being told what to do. Possibly you will need to include him in decisions about chores etc. There is a really helpful book called: "Managing Passive-Agressive Behavior of Children and Youth at School and Home: The Angry Smile" I got it from Amazon a few years ago.|`|3Psi4kBxaa	LOL yes 12 year olds are like that. My 13 year old is and seems to forget more as he is older. Maybe you all need to work together as a family. We do that and it works wonders.<br>  ( Connie Mom of 4 and 5th. Grade Teacher Canada )|`|Y6xanshEaa	^^;<br>  <br>  Well,alot of 12 year olds are like that,they keep on thinking about different things and forget about some stuff.<br>  <br>  I'm like that,though I'm 13.|`|tokcUJSpaa	Our brains are just to busy processing to remember things! Jk, well this totally happens to me, just not as bad. I'll usually remember what it was i needed to do eventually.|`|639b2178cbbecee8a881b09ae5058d5eaa	If a person cares or something is important to them, they take care of it- if they don't care or it's not important they usually don't. It's that simple.  This may sound silly but it is true for both boys and girls.  Here's why I say that: My 11yr old step daughter ALWAYS remembers to bring two jackets with her to school because she hates being too hot/cold but I have to remind her to brush her hair before we leave for school because, even though she sees herself in the mirror in the morning, it doesn't cross her mind because it's not important to her.  She cares more about being too cold than the way she looks.<br>  <br>  The same goes for adults: I often forget to take the clothes out of the dryer before they wrinkle because I don't care if my clothes are a little wrinkly but I never forget to wash the clothes because I hate when all my clothes are dirty.<br>  <br>  My bet is that your 12 yr old doesn't find his To-do list all that important at this stage in his life.|`|7xHfvMIZaa	My brother is like that. It's a guy thing, I guess. You're just going to have to keep making him do stuff. My mom doesn't make my brother do a checklist or anything, though. She just makes him do stuff. Like, she'll say 'You have to do your homework before 6 pm and then you can play Halo' or something. And she makes him deal with conseqeunces if he misses the bus because he was late or if he leave HW at home.|`|8MmmvRlVaa	maybe help him write a list of what he needs to do. i sometimes forget stuff and i'm 12 but i don't mean it and i feel bad when it happens so try not to punish him for it.<br>  <br>  but you seem much nicer than my mom. my mom is really mean:<br>  <br>  <a href="http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;_ylt=AsLS6QfclyvMjR.z7I7FAUx57hR.;_ylv=3?qid=20090223142231AAWlUDs">http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;...</a>|`|BEjZ1wUgaa	Yep, all the 12 yr olds I know are this way & it just gets worse if you let it. Just stay on him. My son was the same way, he is now 19. I basically would not let him do anything until his chores were done. One of his worse habits was leaving his size 9 1/2 tennis shoes on the bathroom floor right next to the door where we had to step over them all the time. After about 2 months of getting him to pick them up over & over I got tired of it. I finally just threw them in the front yard. When he asked if I seen his shoes I told them where they were & he couldn't believe I did that. Oh well, life's rough. He finally stopped because I continued to do it until he learned to pick them up. He is now a US Marine & keeps everything clean & tidy.

gHmSnCPGaa	Claro que no yo ni siquiera estoy deacuerdo con que se casen menos que puedan adoptar un hijo no es bueno para la criatura te imaginas cuando vaya a la escuela y le pregunten por que tiene 2 papás o 2 mamás va a ser una confución muy grande y no es justo tienen derecho a tener una familia normal papá mamá y por que no hermanos|`|SDHvDNGJaa	Si, si son personas solventes moralmente y responsables si...<br>  Porque hay tantos ni?os desamparados en el mundo que necesitan un hogar...|`|5c67e83fa136c5d2806a84ff12ba7591aa	si pueden mantener un hijo economicamente por k no?, es mejor ah k anden en la calle.|`|0253e8c907a815e678a247ecfc9a860caa	Pues tal vez si ....<br>  <br>  <br>  Le daran una familia <br>  algo distinta pero <br>  EDUACACIóN <br>  VIVIENDA<br>  VESTIDO<br>  UNA VIDA DIGNA <br>  <br>  Buenos ejemplos <br>  <br>  Y pues se encargarin de darle una correcta eduacación y orientación sexual|`|32sAr03vaa	Sí, un ni?o necesita amor, tiempo, cuidado, un hogar estable, educación y dinero, no que sus padres sean de distinto sexo.|`|55e25ed52724a9d9904ca31afb56c320aa	Desde luego que si, un ni?@ necesita amor, educación respeto, alimentación, etc. si eso se lo pueden dar dos hombres o dos mujeres ?cual es el problema?, hay muchos ni?os que se crían solo con la madre o con el padre.|`|tyxbFMjcaa	Yo creo que si..conozco unas personal homosexuales que son muy amorosos y pues no tiene nada de malo.|`|1b3756597fd7e667e4fbd5b86ef9c0adaa	SI...si la pareja es estable ..es  MUCHISIMO MEJOR QUE ESTEN EN UN ORFANATO..o  con padres sustitutos.y el ni?o..no se puede formar de mano en mano o de casa en casa...LO IDEAL ES QUE ESTE CON ALGUIENRESPONSABLE DE SU SALUD,EDUCACION Y VIVIENDA...verdad?????|`|4jYtWoSdaa	claro que porsupuesto que no es algo tonto seria tonto que fuera mas facil que ellos adoptaran mas facil que un hombre solo que desee un hijo por falta de pareja o por esterilidad|`|60e41e781e4fe0684fa8ca97041a0efeaa	en mi estado se les permite y tanto lesbian como gays son bonísimos padres|`|SDGKQW2naa	Creo que si deberian dejar que adopten. Primero y principal porque siempre estaran mejhor con una familia amorosa que en la calle o en una institucion, principalmente porque todas las parejas comunes solo quieren  a los bebes (o casi todas) y casi nadie acepta ni?os mas grandes.<br>  Hay parejas que tienen ni?os y los maltratan, los ofenden, no les dan libertad etc... <br>  Obviamente que habria que analizar a la pareja gay al igual que se haria con otra pareja hetero para ver si estan psicologicamente preparados.  Para cuando los ni?os vayan a la escuela sepan que decirles etc, los ni?os aceptan las cosas de maneranatural no como nosotros los grandes que somos unos reprimidos... El amor es amor y punto!!!<br>  no importa quien te lo brinde siempre y cuando lo recibas de forma sana e incondicional!!! <br>  Hay muchas parejas gays que son estables y sanas, no se drogan y tienen mucho amor para dar...<br>  <br>  ?????? ????? ??? ????? ?????|`|cOX2ZuYbaa	Si.Hay muchos ni?os que necesitan amor y se comprobo que el ser educado por una pareja gay no influi en el desarrollo sexual del ni?o.|`|euIGeSSvaa	pero por supuesto... y por no????<br>  en muchos países se hace y esta muy bien???<br>  es obvio que 1 ni?o va a estar mejor en 1 hogar en donde ahí amor y en donde lo van a querer mucho que por ahí de huérfano o algo.... y que pasa que la pareja sea gay????<br>  cual seria el problema , que a caso ellos no pueden dar amor a 1 ni?o que lo necesita....aunque si no se pude dar en adopción 1 ni?o a cualquier familia y si ahí que fiscalizar bien quien es la pareja a la que e le entrega el ni?o... pero de la misma forma como se debe fiscalizar a 1 pareja hetero...<br>  cual es la diferencia aparte de sus preferencias sexuales????|`|sOdUIEiAaa	yo no estaria de acuerdo, el motivo : yo tengo amigos que son gays y son buenas personas trabajdoras y que no se meten en problemas, pero imaginate como el ni?o adoptado va a ser el blanco de burlas y va a ser repudiado y rechazado por sus compa?eros de escuela y mas cuando los padres de los compa?eros se enteren de que es hijo de gays, no permitiran la amistad eso pensando solo en los a?os de escuela, despues es muy probable que el se averguence de sus padres creandole complejos y sentimientos encontrados, yo creo que no es justo para el ni?o, porque quieras o no, te guste o no. vivimos en una sociedad que no esta preparada para eso, asi que por la salud del ni?o yo digo que no.|`|60bee6ceae01a0cfbc2a9f203aa71d63aa	Claro que sí.  Cualquier persona puede ser un padre o madre amorosos y reponsables, y de igual manera hay padres desobligados, golpeadores, abusadores que no merecen ser padres.  Así que mientras estén dispuestos a darle un hogar amoroso a su hijo, sean heterosexuales, bisexuales u homosexuales no importa porque sabrán inculcarles morales, respeto, educación y tolerancia para cualquier ser humano.|`|63d40cbd2007a3a30e7ec908d33c1938aa	querida bburbujita: como es posible que a estas alturas uno diga que no es homofobico, que no le molestan los gays, pero cuando les preguntas y si tu papa lo fuera y si tu hermano o hermana lo fuera se aterran. o sea mientras no sea una persona cercana a nuestro entorno lo respetamos. a eso le llamo hipocresia y doble moral, el hecho de que una creatura cresca entre dos personas del mismo sexo, las cuales el identifica como pareja no quiere decir que el ni?o se valla hacer gay si no que tendra una mayor tolerancia y respeto hacia Otras personas, UN NI?O TIENE DERECHO A UNA FAMILIA SIN IMPORTAR COMO ESTE ESTRUCTURADA. y mi respues es si todos tenemos el derecho de ejercer la paternidad.|`|6acd9b3050dfa99df4c9409b14ac767aaa	CLARO QUE SI....<br>  <br>  las personas homosexuales tienen derecho a adoptar o criar ni?os... a los ni?os se les debe fomentar y educar acerca de esto, que es normal y no tiene nada de malo... todo debe hablarse, es lo mas importante la comunicacion de padres/madres a hijos. Los homosexuales pueden criar o adpotar, pueden ser hasta mejores padres que las parejas normales, y estudios han comprobado que son muy buenos padres.|`|7b2eca605d429130cc5645186848ff4eaa	No tengo nada en contra de los Gays, allá cada cual con su preferencia sexual , tengo  amigos Gays y converso con ellos de diferentes temas . Pero...... en esto de la adopción no .  A todos los que están de acuerdo ,  piensen en si ustedes tuvieran que dar  un hijo o hermano suyo en adopción , buscarían una pareja de Gays para que sean los nuevos padres de su hijo , por favor !  <br>  Ahora , si se diera el caso de que un ni?o queda huérfano de madre y su único familiar es un hermano (a), o sea, tío(a) del menor y es Gays  ya la cosa cambia .....  es un familiar no un desconocido.  Aclaro en caso de que no haya otra alternativa.|`|9d811f964ae89c221bcfdcf7a18c8020aa	Si estoy de acuerdo, las parejas gay para mi son exactamente igual a las demas, asi que no hablare de gays, si no de la adopcion en si, mientras una pareja reuna los requisitos, para tal hecho, lo veo completamente razonable.|`|U6Y5NqxXaa	Claro que si!!!!!!!!, hay muchisimos ni?os en el mundo que son abandonados por personas que nos los quieren desde peque?os, son ni?os que necesitan el amor de una familia y si estas personas pueden brindarles un hogar, adelante!!!!|`|Wte24FFvaa	si estoy de acuerdo la adopcion en pareja gays pueden criar a un hijo con amor y dandole sus necesidades materiales como cualquier pareja de hombre  mujer le dan la opotunidad  de tener una familia un lugar en la sociedad y no que esten en la calle o en institutos los nin?o quieren AMOR ellos no discriminan  los adultos si suerte!!!!|`|jeGc9wiyaa	Yo creo que es muy delicado, ya que puede confudir un poco al nino, pero creo que depende mas de la educacion y amor que le den, y que le expliquen bien, ya que los ninos alrededor de el o del colegio van a hacer burla de lo que el va a llamar normal.|`|kOuoydXSaa	Yo creo que si porque lo que se busca hoy en día no es la estructura familiar de marido y mujer sino una vida sana y educación para todos los ni?os...además en comparación de los hogares de los que vienen los bebes en la mayoría de los casos es horroroso: padres golpeadores, mucha pobreza, abandono y ni hablar que están dejados a la deriva en la educación...obviamente siempre como en el caso de las parejas hetero se debe realizar un profundo análisis de todo el entorno. Mas allá de esta opinión creo que en la realidad es muy difícil que se de así...con decir que muuuchas parejas hetero no pudieron adoptar por todo el filtro que hacen antes de finalizar la adopción.|`|lvT5oFSEaa	mmmmmmm.................................... NO SE, talvez|`|weInHeXkaa	jo der no sabes las probabilidades de que ese ni?o tenga una buena educasion de dos gays al rato deespues tambien se hace gay ademas alguien gay no puede tener buena moral despierten pueden abusar del ni?o.

FHT6wsUpaa	There isn't much else you can do...you're doing all that you can already. I have to say, the humidifier helps my daughter immensely. We run it all the time in the winter, even when she's not sick. Just a lot of TLC, cuddling, reassurance...babies are truly miserable when they're sick because they can't tell you what's wrong and don't understand how to deal with it. Don't worry, they also bounce back quickly too. Good luck.|`|nQyJFOMZaa	My 5 month old sons has a bit of a cold right now. The cough isn't as bothersome to him as his constantly runny nose, I also use the aspirator, also try some saline nose drops you can make them at home boil 1 cup of water with 1/4 teaspoon of salt let cool to room temp then use a dropper and put about 4 drops in each nostril then use the aspirator to suck out the mucus from his sinuses works great and clears their little noses for much longer than just the aspirator alone.|`|1MEnCmwoaa	When it is runny all you can do is wipe it really. The humidifier is good too. If it turns to stuffy then also use saline drops to unstuff then suck it all out!|`|bASjhsFBaa	cough came from runny nose. its called poise nasel drip. it literally runs down the back of your throat which makes it soar. be prepared for a stomach ache next! anyway, alll you can do is give him some medicine or wait it out|`|LZVZkSHUaa	For a baby I would call the DR he/she can give you s Rx for the symptoms, No over the counter meds are okay at this age.
SDHvDNGJaa	No, siempre es una postura comodina y antinatural. Sobre todo una postura que trata de imponer un criterio sin un razonamiento lógico. Porque la iglesia católica se opone al uso de anticonceptivos, de condón, de la pastilla del día siguiente, muchos sacerdotes son violadores y pederastas. Y entonces ?cual es su falsa moral? ?Quien puede confiar en personas tan manipuladoras y nefastas? ?Quieren que el mundo se pueble con seres sumidos no solo en la pobreza material sino en la espiritual? Claro, para poder seguir manipulándolos a su antojo.<br>  Saludos!|`|56c5e9af867f47977f6f5caaec5c5826aa	no para nada, el clero no es dios.|`|b4f4fe7ec6cf325437c3a60a65af56edaa	Es comprensible que su actitud sea esa. ?creíste que iban a traer un mariachi para celebrarlo? Entiendelos, siempre ha sido su inflexible postura contra el aborto y ahora menos la van a cambiar. Y esta postura no solo fue en México, también fue en Espa?a, Italia, Holanda, Brasil y en todos los lugares donde tenga presencia el clero de todas las religiones. Tuvieron la misma postura con las pastillas anticonceptivas allá por los a?os 60's, incluso aún es pecado usarlas.<br>  Actualmente ya la gente no toma en cuenta esas opiniones y decide por si misma. Ya no se oye que digan las mujeres "los hijos que Dios me de" y es raro ver que las parejas tengan más de 4 hijos.<br>  La gente de la iglesia nunca va a cambiar. Siempre va a ser intolerante, irreflexiva y reaccionaria.|`|be84f6885005b6560a04dedab989defdaa	Claro que no!!!!!!!!!!!!      Como alguien mencion+o arriba, hay más cosas a considerar cuando un bebé va a nacer, y una de ellas (la más importante creo yo) es la calidad de vida. Quizá no sea el momento en que deba nacer el bebé (que en todo caso ni a feto llega), pues no se le aseguraría una buena vida. Por otro lado, la vida de la madre también es importante. <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  Saludos!|`|4da8b70c9f14ec1d3e5fc84b6bc9b1e4aa	Para mi la opinion del clero no tiene validez alguna,|`|7b7544f2c4a951eace63b04baddb2157aa	Mira en cierta forma al defender el derecho a la vida sobre todo de un inocente indefenso, si, pero creo que el clero es el menos idicado para hablar de moralidad. A nivel mundial ?no se conocen cada vez más casos de abusos del clero que también son criminales, como la pederastia?|`|ba0811caba7cccf75c7f9d07e97007c9aa	creo que cada quien tiene su manera de pensar pero la madre tiene todo el derecho de decidir sobre lo que ara pues si el bebe nace probablemente no sea deseado y sea maltratado o simplemente las condiciones no sean las adecuadas|`|w59e5u5Taa	pues cuando es una violacion o que el bebe tiene mal formacion para que vas a traer al mundo a una personita a sufrir|`|f2b57faf2b65bf75799889bc2e9bb005aa	Ninguna ya que las leyes en mexico son laicas, y en lo personal me importa poco por que ellos mismos hablan sobre el libre albedrio.|`|4iCs2oeBaa	El que lo haga quede en su conciencia!

I've had 4 pregnancies resulting in 3 children (i lost a baby).Only the 4th pregnancy was planned but it does not mean my other 2 children and the child i lost were "mistakes".. When old enough if my kids asked if they were planned i'll tell them the truth but make sure they know that they were still very much wanted. <br>  I knew from being quite young i was not planned but i always knew i was loved and that once they found out my parents were pleased..|`|hVVALFAPaa	You don't. <br>  <br>  Period. <br>  <br>  Ever.|`|JnLoHaoAaa	Why even do that?

Your parents don't want you to be exposed to something and get sick again, They are not punishing you  they want to make sure that you are truly able to fight off the germs. A swimming pool is a harbor for germs, Warm & moist. that is why they put chlorine in the pool to kill off the ones in the water, but it does nothing for the ones in the air. <br>  Your parents will write a note to your coach to detail what they have done and he will have to accept it.

6PEOqeLOaa	it sounds like yesterday you had pre-labor contractions. From what you described as to how you feel now sounds like you are having true labor contractions.

When you go in for your intake at OB though, they ask how many times you've been pregnant because yes, it COULD affect things if you have had miscarriages or abortions.  I asked my doctor why they wanted to know, and she said they like to know that when it comes time to deliver, it has something to do with your uterus.

chmuDZObaa	Take a shower and put on clean undies.  If it continues to seep out, even when you squeeze your muscles to stop urine, then it might be amniotic fluid.

Yes the medical abortion with pills will probably hurt more, but you will abort a group of cells that don't look like a baby yet.  The longer you wait, the more and more human the baby looks and the bigger it gets.  At only 8 weeks the baby is already the size of a quarter.  You do not want to get a surgical abortion.  Honestly- what were you expecting when you had sex?|`|6L9jJnchaa	Your parents are going to find out anyway!  You can't get an abortion without parental consent.|`|7add460ae24c9452ae87b5a99c5aa756aa	Well, both suck.<br>  Ive never had the pill cause its not legal here in canada.<br>  Im sure though cause you caught it early enough, it would be the way to go.  No need to put your body through the actual procedure if you dont have to.  Its awful!!!! (personal experiance)<br>  Good luck!<br>  <br>  Oh, and PS...abortion isnt murder.  Dont let these psycho pro-lifers on here make you feel bad.  They have no clue what its like to be in your situation!|`|9hrJfhIIaa	You're "mature" enough to have sex... you're mature enough to handle the consequences.

I'm not sure on the cost.  You do not need someone 18 or over, we just voted on that prop and it did not pass.  My advice would be to do this asap and get it over with.  I don't personally have experience with either one but my friend took the pill and it was painless.  I had another friend who had the surgery and said it was awful.|`|uYDoPNv9aa	abortion is MURDER just because of your mistake why does the baby have to die for something it didnt do but because of the stuipd moms misstake. abrtion is murder and it should be made illegal. you made a mistake by geting preganante why take it out on the baby?? you should have the baby and keep it or give it up for adoption!|`|ixD2RnqTaa	Seriously, you should have thought about the consequences of your actions first.<br>  Your pregnant now and if you knew what a blessing it is.<br>  <br>  Do you know how many families want to have kids but cant?<br>  You can and you want to kill it?<br>  I had a baby at 17 and she is 6 now. I couldnt imagine life without her.|`|qImMwhUHaa	Do you mean less painful for you or the baby. I seem to think that either option would be VERY painful for the baby.|`|4AZp8Quwaa	What the heck are you thinking in having unprotected sex in the first place?|`|t8HPCzrOaa	wow either way its still going to pain you cause your trying to kill a innocent baby|`|1veacHkjaa	First of all it sounds like you are probably a little farther along than 3 weeks. If you dont want to hear the truth with the killing comments then why'd you ask a question like that. Abortion is murder and that's the truth and if you're mature enough to have sex then you are mature enough to hear the truth. Please do not get an abortion, yes, your parents might be upset and that is going to suck for a while, but an abortion will not be worth it because you will regret it for the rest of your life and that is a serious understatement. Adoption is a great option and won't cost you hardly a thing and you will get all the support you need if you feel unable to support it with the help of friends and family. Please be open minded...You are carrying a CHILD with it's own DNA, its own fingerprints, it has a gender, it has a personality and all of that has already been decided at the moment of conception. Don't you want to know what your baby will look like? Don't you want to hear it laugh? Please don't abort your baby. It is just as much alive as you are. I know you're scared, but emotions are temporary, and abortion is forever. Please please please reconsider. And in response to the whole sending away thing...They will find out either way and I doubt they'd want you to get an abortion over having the baby. Please grow up and realize that you are someone's mother now and take responsibility for your actions.|`|hmOidFp3aa	Honey, both are going to hurt!! But it is the consquences that you have to deal with when you make that decision to have unprotected sex! Its already the 23 of Feb,and a baby'sheart starts beating anywhere between the 18-21 day! So it is growing and living inside you, it has a beating heart and developing! I am still TTC my first baby, you dont know how big of a blessing this could truely be! You could give the baby up for adoption! If you are scared that your parents would be angry, they will get over it! My best friend is LDS and got preggo in HS. Her parents were mad at first but then started getting so excited to be a grandma! she gave the baby up and she still gets to see it! <br>  I am somewhat pro-life i guess, unless it will harm the mother or in cases of rape or incest or something like that--You are neither! you are 16 out having unprotected sex, so think of it this way, you are going to stop the beating heart of your baby, that YOU created, all because you were careless! <br>  I just wish you could understand and dont make a rash decision! Both are going to hurt it doesnt matter which one you pick and when you get it done! Sleep on it, think about your baby, or a couple you could give it to! Think of watching your little son or daughter grow up to be big and strong and make a difference in this world! What they would go to school to be, how when they are scared you would be the FIRST person they would turn to! How amazing it must feel to hold that tiny baby in your arms for the first time and look down on it and think "I made that, she has my eyes"!<br>  Im sorry to get so sentimental but I want a baby of my own so dear, and it breaks my little heart to see careless 16 year olds destroying what I want MORE THAN ANYTHING! I hope you will think long and hard and you will be in my prayers!|`|oJ5pZQAiaa	People say they don't understand what it is like to be in your position but I do. I am 15 years old and 14 weeks pregnant. I am also giving my baby up to a loving family that are unable to have a child of their own. I know I made a mistake but I am taking the responsibility into my own hands. Why don't you do the same? Don't get an abortion it doesn't make you unpregnant it just makes you the mother of a dead child. Give the child up to a family.|`|oWLznROuaa	I dont know how things work in the states but you should definately speak to someone at the womans clinic before you make this decision!  I am not for abortion but you really need to think about your choices, this is gonna effect the rest of your life!  I hope you have learned your lesson and PLEASE go on the pill!|`|FRapTJzwaa	give the baby to adoption, the loving option.<br>  <br>  wth are you thinking... going to kill a baby.|`|vnBU9O9taa	DEAR GOD DONT ABORT, IF U WANT IT TO LIVE, PUT IT IN A HOME LIKE IN THE MOVIES|`|NGinqXvuaa	Finger-pointing and talking down to you aren't going to help you, so I'll spare you a lecture, or any morality-based lashings. You're right to be taking this seriously, but don't panic. You're not the first this has happened to, you won't be the last. You couldn't pay me to have to go through the high school years again, because the lessons can be so hard. Firstly, are you able to talk to your family about this? (I don't mean you should avoid their disappointment, and yes, even anger when you break the news.) I mean, some girls are truly afraid to talk due to family violence, etc., If you can, you need to turn to them first. If not, go to your guidance counselor (or, even a teacher) at school and run all this past them. Point is, you should talk to an adult before making any appointments. I know this is an extremely difficult situation, I wish you all the best. And, abortion is not the only option (which is also physically painful, Ive heard.)
vlVdn5GFaa	i not sure.  ask a knowledgeable friend, or see your doctor at your next visit.|`|wiAVa1H5aa	Yes that's pregnancy related, but you could have a yeast infection in your mouth - it hurts and ulcerates, and during pregnancy you have a compromised immune system so your are more susceptible to infection.

SDHvDNGJaa	Tienen que determinar la causa de la falta de espermatozoides, puede ser tan simple como el bloqueo de un conducto espermático. Pero lo tiene que tratar un médico especialista. Tal vez en la seguridad social si piden que los trate un especialista se pueda.<br>  Suerte!|`|P1iNFQGCaa	Debe determinarse la causa de la azoospermia antes de que se formule un plan de tratamiento dado que los espermatozoides se producen en los testículos. Una biopsia testicular puede recuperar los espermatozoides para ser utilizados en FIV con ICSI. La corrección quirúrgica puede corregir un bloqueo si se determina que ésa es la causa. La recuperación de espermatozoides viables podría requerir una biopsia testicular. Si la afección no puede ser corregida, la donación de espermatozoides puede ser una opción.|`|C3UQSrYHaa	CAUSAS BIOLóGICAS<br>  La azoospermia tiene dos causas principales: la primera es la obstrucción de los conductos que trasladan los espermios desde los testículos hacia el exterior. Generalmente, esto ocurre por presencia de infecciones que producen cicatrices que impiden el paso de fluidos como el semen. Otro motivo puede ser que exista algún corte como consecuencia de intervenciones quirúrgicas pasadas (vasectomía, extirpación hernias inguinales, etcétera).<br>  <br>  La otra causa (secretora) es más complicada de tratar, pues muchas veces tiene características biológicas que pueden ser hereditarias. En términos simples, se trata de la imposibilidad de los testículos de producir espermatozoides capaces de fecundar al óvulo o, en lo casos más extremos, de su nula existencia en el líquido seminal.<br>  <br>  Por causas genéticas, se considera la alteración cromosómica (gestada durante el desarrollo embrionario) que impide el normal desarrollo de los testículos.<br>  <br>  Por otra parte, también puede presentarse un déficit en la producción de testosterona, la hormona masculina encargada de la generación de esperma y de acentuar los caracteres masculinos secundarios.Dentro de esta categoría, también cabe mencionar el padecimiento de cripotequídea, o sea cuando los testículos (después de aproximadamente 4 aóos de edad) no bajan al escroto, quedándose en la cavidad abdominal.<br>  <br>  La temperatura corporal de las personas hace que la producción de espermatozoides en este caso también se vea mermada o impedida, porque -según explica Salas- "las gónadas masculinas necesitan estar siempre a una temperatura inferior a la del resto del cuerpo; es decir, a 35 grados".<br>  <br>   TRATAMIENTOS<br>  "En hombres jóvenes y solteros, el tema de la fecundación no suele sertan preocupante, por lo que no acuden a realizarse estos exámenes", explica el urólogo. Pero si después de algunos intentos fallidos, no existe fecundación es primordial realizarse un chequeo para determinarla calidad del semen producido. Este determinará la cantidad y forma de espermios, así como también su movilidad. Estas dos característicasson cruciales a la hora de fecundar el óvulo. Lamentablemente, para corregir estas imperfecciones aún no existe tratamiento, puesto que se trata de condiciones biológicas inherentes.<br>  <br>  La buena noticia es que, en caso de alteraciones producidas por infecciones, golpes o acumulación de sangre o agua, la posibilidad de revertir la situación, y de producir semen con "buenos" espermatozoides es alta. Mediante cirugías, hormonas o medicamentos (antibióticos, generalmente) se pueden corregir obstrucciones en los conductos que mezclan los espermatozoides con las secreciones de lavesícula seminal, lo que -en conjunto- compone el semen.<br>  <br>  La salud de los órganos genitales es muy importante, pero a veces -yasea por vergüenza o desconocimiento- los hombres no acuden al médicopara chequear los. Es importante saber que, por lo general, eldiagnóstico oportuno de afecciones puede ser de gran ayuda para evitarcomplicaciones que posteriormente podrían convertirse en causas defertilidades.|`|jtahdpxnaa	puede ser,ves al medico a ver que pasa.

Si en realidad la amas de verdad no importa nada mas.  Ahora, ojo, observa bien si ella te corresponde o si solo es por salir del problema.  Cuando tuve a mi hijo, no queria que el padre se enterara por varios factores.  Mi ex se ofrecio a hacerse cargo de mi hijo.  En un principio no queria por todas las implicaciones que eso conllevaba.  Al fin y al cabo el me convencio pero siempre tuvo claro que fue por sus motivaciones personales y no por creer que yo lo amaba ni nada por el estilo.  Al sol de hoy no hemos tenido mayores contratiempos, el es feliz por su lado y yo por el mio, por que no hubo enga?os.  El si me tiene que ayudar con mi hijo lo hace pero tampoco lo hago sentir que tiene que responsabilizarse de mi hijo.  Asi que evalua todo y elige la mejor opcion que no lastime tus sentimientos ni los de ella y mucho menos del ni?o que esta por nacer.|`|t7DlZ9XEaa	Pienso que ojala hubiera mas hombres como tu... ese es el verdadero amor, y si te elige estoy segura que te llegara a amar igual que tu a ella, que bueno que la apoyas y ojala el bebe lo ames igual :D|`|MFCt3aIHaa	Bueno me pareceria genial si asumieras la paternidad, quizas no tanto por la chica sino por ese angelito que no tiene la culpa de nada, esto seria el resultado del amor que sientes por tu ex novia, pero tienes que estar seguro que ella te ama, y si no es asi la relacion no tendra futuro.

Nada mas de pensar que trae en la pancita el hijo de otro es motivo suficiente para que la repela de inmediato.<br>  <br>  Y si ella aún no se decide entre tú o el otro ( como lo escribiste ), es porque nada mas está buscando un pen....dejo la palabra para no ofender a nadie , que la mantenga a ella y a su bodoque.....<br>  <br>  Está bien que aún sientas algo por ella, pero de eso a hacerse cargo de su embarazo, echarte encima gastos que ni vienen al caso y todo para que a fin de cuentas se largue con el otro en cuanto te saque todo lo que necesite, ( con el pretexto  " es que ya me dí cuenta que es a él al que quiero"  la verdad, YO NO ESTARíA DISPUESTO.....<br>  <br>  YA ME SAQUEARON..........NO ME VOLVERAN A SAQUEAR.....|`|a387f6085436b1eab30cb9d59eaafb48aa	Primero que nada ella es la que tiene que estar segura de que quiere vivir contigo, y poner en claro la relación y que vas a asumir la paternidad de su hijo, que lo amaras como tuyo y sobretodo que no vaya a buscar al susodicho despues.

Pero ella misma eligió su camino, fue su desición directa o indirectamente hacer pareja con un hombre que no la valora ni reconoce sus cualidades, ella tiene que asumir su responsabilidad, ella tiene que enfrentar su realidad. Puedes estar a su lado, en el momento mas dificil, mas doloroso, compartiendo sus tristezas y alegrias, pero no intervengas en una situación que es ajena a ti, es la relación de ella con otro hombre y el hijo de ambos, no debes meterte aunque sientas que la amas  y quieras protegerla.

Asegúrate que el ni?o ha descansado bien. Especialmente antes de un día muy ajetreado o de actividades agotadoras. <br>  <br>  2. Evita salidas muy largas o visitas sin descansos o comida. Lleva siempre aperitivos nutritivos y bebidas si las comidas se van a retrasar. <br>  <br>  3. Crea un ambiente seguro en casa. Esto permitirá al ni?o la libertad para explorar y tener independencia. <br>  <br>  4. Minimiza el factor “no”. Demasiadas reglas solo harán que el ni?o esté más frustrado. <br>  <br>  5. Deja que sea el ni?o el que decida. Por ejemplo, si tiene una rabieta a la hora del ba?o, pregúntale qué juguete quiere en la ba?era o qué libro quiere que le leas después. <br>   <br>  6. Establece normas diarias consistentes. Contar con una rutina transmitirá al ni?o la sensación de control sobre lo que va a pasar a continuación y aumentará las posibilidades de que coopere contigo. <br>  <br>  7. Prepara el escenario para nuevas experiencias contándole lo que va a pasar. Si vas a visitar a un pariente, por ejemplo, dile a quién va a ver y qué va a pasar cuando llegue allí; cuanto más sepa el ni?o, menos propenso será a tener una rabieta.

26bmrd89aa	Puede resultar todo el proceso bien, pero se corren riesgos debido a que los ovulos tienden a envejecer rápido desde el momento en que comienzan los primeros cambios de la menopausia, eso provoca que el feto tenga alguna tara o problema genético. Está tambien la salud de la madre, que a esa edad ya la producción de estrógeno disminuye (el estrogeno es el que permite que la mujer asimile el calcio) y asi mismo disminuirá la absorcion de calcio que es uno de los minerales mas importanes durante la gestación, entonces el feto tomará todo el calcio y la madre dificilmente lo recuperará produciendo en su organismo la osteoporosis.<br>  Los procesos bioquímicos a nivel de sangre tienen ligeros cambios por la edad, aumentando los riesgos de hipertensión arterial que puede llevar a una eclampsia, aumento en la coagulación sanguínea produciendo trombosis,y otra serie de afecciones que pueden pasar. Todo es relativo, porque como dije al principio todo puede salir bien, pero el riesgo es muy grande para la madre y el feto. A esa edad se tiene como embarazo de alto riesgo.|`|659d941551a9d413f0f0beecd9f3c323aa	mira es mas q todo un peligro ya q tus hormonas no son tan altas como lo fueron en tu juventud o tu edad madura...tienes muchos movimientos hormonales q afectan al feto y hace q tengas q tener dietas especiales y cuidados especiales en tu embarazo q seguramente no tuviste q hacer cuando t embarazaste antes cuando eras mas joven, consulta con tu ginecologo, el t dara una respuesta mas clara y mas confiable, nosotros estamos aqui para ayudar, pero la verdad no tenemos la experiencia como para decirte q kedes embarazada,  T DESEO LA MEJOR D LAS SUERTES Y FELICIDADES SI SERAS D NUEVO MADRE:)|`|IzsZRU7Baa	se considera un embarazo de alto riesgo, tu bebe puede tener problemas de salud, o enfermedades cromosomicas, te recomiendo un seguimiento estrecho por tu ginecologo y pruebas al liquido amniotico asi como ultrasonidos, cuidate mucho.|`|yzxWVE0caa	el de perder al bebe, y eso es por la edad, pero si dices estar en perfecta salud, puede que nada...|`|5CiSZub0aa	En realidad, la edad ideal es aquella en la que la pareja está lo suficientemente madura como para tomar una decisión tan trascendente como la de tener un hijo. Día a día es más frecuente que las parejas, principalmente por motivos laborales o por realización profesional, comiencen la búsqueda de su primer hijo muy cerca de los 40 a?os, o bien, teniendo ya hijos grandes, deciden comenzar una nueva etapa con la llegada de un recién nacido a la casa.<br>  <br>  ?Qué complicaciones podrían aparecer?<br>  <br>  Los 40, no representan un sinónimo de complicaciones durante el embarazo. Los 40 representan una etapa de madurez orgánica y psíquica de la vida, en la que suelen manifestarse algunas condiciones patológicas como la hipertensión arterial, la diabetes, la hipercolesterolemia, las alteraciones de la función tiroidea (hipotiroidismo o hipertiroidismo) o inconvenientes para conservar un peso adecuado. Actualmente es posible utilizar tecnologías médicas que pueden ayudar a diagnosticar una afección o bien, prevenir su aparición antes de la gestación.<br>  <br>  Otras enfermedades que pueden tener mayor incidencia en un embarazo a esta edad son la hipertensión arterial, la preeclampsia (hipertensión inducida por el embarazo), diabetes gestacional, acorde con la historia natural de aparición de estos procesos, así como partos prematuros o recién nacidos de bajo peso. <br>  <br>  Es muy importante que antes del embarazo se realice un control ginecológico y recibir asesoramiento acerca de las cosas que conviene modificar en la vida cotidiana para que los riesgos puedan minimizarse.<br>  <br>  Ser madre después de los 40 es algo tan maravilloso como a los 20, 25, ó 35 a?os.

La implantación de un ovulo fecundado en el endometrio no se lleva acabo en el mismo momento de la relación, no es algo express. Cuando se tiene una práctica sexual apartir del momento de la eyaculación y suponiendo que estes en tus días más fertiles, el esperma tarda  doce horas en llegar al ovulo y poderse fecundar. Suponiendo que la fecundación haya tenido exito el camino que rrecorre el ovulo hacia el endometrio tarda aproximadamente  60 horas más, para que se pueda llevar acabo una implantación. Para que esta sea exitosa tiene que haber las condiciones propicias  para que  se comince a desarrollar una celula huevo o cigoto, de no ser así, aún cuando el ovulo esté fecundado la implantación no se lleva acabo y el ovulo es desechado y posteriormetnte el endometrio en tu menstruación.  <br>  En dado caso de que efectivamente te encontraras embarazada tubo que haber surgido con mucho más tiempo, no descarto la posibilidad, suponiendo que hayas tenido relaciones previas, pero no es un acontesimiento que surja en minutos. Por otro lado es importante que te mantengas en observación médica, si estas embarazada el médico te dará las indicaciones pertinentes para que tu embarazo se desarrolle de la mejor manera. Pero toma en cuenta que no es la unica posibilidad, es imprtante que si el liquido que salió de  tu vulva es totalmente ajeno  a algo que anterior mente hayas segregado, puede tratarse de alguna infeccion que no nescesariamente pudiste adquirir en una practica sexual, pero que  la tienes. Por tanto es importante no especular y que acudas al médico a que te exmine, ya que sea la una o la otra causa siempre es mejor estar bajo vigilancia médica.<br>  <br>  Saludos y suerte!!!|`|XJcPNhekaa	y crees q todos andamos de medicos por el mundo???|`|Yl1lMUkXaa	Amiga, tranquila,  ya viviste todo un proceso.

Eso que la madre de la bebita le haya pedido que se la quedara, no implica que haya que acceder al pedido en forma textual, porque a l fin y al cabo son los vivos los que deben tomar la decisión que más se apegue al beneficio de la familia en su conjunto<br>  Te deseo suerte|`|8973b813e482207b97efaaf1cfeb140caa	veras, yo creo que tu amiga se siente obligada moralmente y quiza sienta compasion por el bebe y es normal, es muy bueno el acto que desea hacer, pero ahora pienso que la postura de su mama es correcta y te voy a decir porque, tu y tu amiga son muy jovenes y mas adelante ella tendra que hacer su vida, casarse tener hijos, esto no quiere decir que no ame tambien a este ni?o, pero muchas veces para los hombres el hecho de saber que una chica ya es madre les hace pensar que quiza sea una chica solo para pasar el rato y creo que de eso la esta protegiendo su mama, no veo nada de malo que el ni?o se regostre a nmombre de su mama, incluso tambien por seguridad juridica, porque de seguro su mama ya tendra algunos bienes que quiza en lo futuro pueda heredar al bebe, ademas no le estan negando el apoyo a tu amiga y mucho menos la esntan alejando del bebe, asi eue ella puede estar pendiente de los cuidados y darle amor al bebe tal como se lo pidio la madre de este, pero con la salvedad juridica de no ser la mama y si la hermana, yo tengo una hermana 13 a?os mayor que yo y siempre me amo mucho, es como si fuese mi mama,y yo la quiero mucho, asi le puede pasar a ese ni?o con tu amiga, yo creo que su mama de verdad la esta apoyando y esta opensando en su futuro, y entoendo a tu amiga pero ella no ha visualizado lo que mas adelante esta por venir, ademas el ni?o va a ser su familia. felicitala por el bonito gesto, debe ser una buena chica,  con una buena amiga preocupada por ella.|`|910e4b6caf327203bbb8d7d1953d3e06aa	Creo que tu pregunta es poco seria. En primer lugar, los ni?os no se regalan. Segundo, cada país tiene un organismo que se encarga de la ni?ez y es a ellos a quien compete el bienestar de este ni?o, que según tú, ha quedado desamparado. Como madre por adopción me ofende que se hable de "regalar el ni?o", "quedarse con el ni?o", como refiriéndose a un cachorro que encontraron en la calle. Por lo demás, me parece poco creíble que una situación así suceda en un hospital y quienes estén decidiendo el futuro de la criatura sean tu amiga y su mamá.

Siento que la abuela adoptiva lo que quiere es el bien de su hija, ya que como tiene 20 a?os y es soltera, no quiere que en el futuro tenga problemas cuando los demás piensen que no es cierto que es adoptado, sobre todo que tiene el tipo de ella.  Si se lleva bien con su mamá que la deje ayudarle, pues siendo su madre no le va a hacer da?o, al contrario ella puede estar cerca y amarle y no por eso defraudará a la mamá que murió, pues siempre estará al pendiente del bebé.|`|zBC3MKyAaa	hola:<br>  la verdad, es algo complicado pues es tan fácil que tu hermana lo registre a su nombre y listo, el ni?o puede vivir en la casa de sus padres si ellos así lo desean pero registrado al nombre de tu amiga ahora si ella quiere llevarlo a vivir con ella adelante.<br>  Echale porras y que decida bien, porque por algo pasan las cosas y lo que dices pues es algo que muy pocos creirian pero si es veridico, que haga lo que mejor le parezca para bien suyo y del ni?o|`|025Oubasaa	Es complicado, por el tema de las leyes sobre adopcion, pero no imposible.

Por algo llego a ella, no? Saludos, suerte.|`|Tom8v99Vaa	Que bueno que tu amiga tiene un gran corazon, y ha decidido cumplir su promesa de cuidar del bebe, yo le aconsejo que ya que su mama y la familia acepta al ni?o deje que sea ella quien lo adopte, tu amiga es muy joven aun y no sabe la gran responsabilidad de ser madre, a ella le falta por vivir mucho aun, tener su propio hogar y su propia familia, lo importante es que no desamparen a la criaturita y que lo cuiden mucho y lo amen de verdad, porque mas adelante si ella lo adopta puede echarle la culpa al bebe de que no se pudo realizar como mujer, o que la atò para hacer muchas cosas, mejor que le adopte su mama, y buena suerte.|`|UXr5z8uXaa	que se lo quede y arriende un lugar para ella y su hijo ya que la carrera que ella estudia tendra grandes frutos monetarios.|`|WcOOCxDcaa	bueno me parece que tu amiga tiene la suficiente edad como para decidir sobre sus propias cosas.. que reconozca de una vez que crecio y la responsabilidad que implica tener un chico a cargo y lleve la situacion adelante.. y que le importe un huevo lo que piense su madre.!!!     **** madre metidaa...   uy! sory pero mimetice con la situacion!!  comunicate conmigo|`|YopoOIQVaa	me parece muy chica para tal responsabilidad pero si ella esta capacitada y tiene solvencia economica me parece bien ysi la q la rodean a ella estan de acuerdo.barbaro|`|cgFO3q8Saa	si ,|`|cs38Vcucaa	la verdad es serio lo que dices a mi me gustaria que algo asi me pasara. te voy a decir lo que yo haria me quedo con el bb a fin de cuentas es la ultima voluntad de la madre si confio en ella por algo debe haber sido no se como son los papeleos por alla pero aqui en santo domingo creo que no dejarian adoptar porque es soltera.  yo en su lugar me quedo con el bb y cuando me case lo adopto para que las cosas se hagan mas facil.<br>  <br>  la verdan es que siento envidia de la buena.<br>  es una situacion muy seria y la vez muy linda no se como describirlo.|`|gfMeY79Naa	La madre de ese baby lo que quería es que su hijo estuviera bien, no la conoce a tu amiga y por lo tanto no creo que fuera  su pedido que fuera exclusivamente ella quien lo adoptara como madre, sino que se encargara de que estuviera bien... Igual... tremendo favor que le ha pedido!<br>  Y que bien tanto tu amiga como su mamá para querer cuidar de ese bebé... <br>  Yo creo que es indistinto quien lo adopte como madre... si ella quiere ser madre bueno entonces sí, pero si tu amiga lo va a adoptar porque se lo pidieron, me parece que se siente más en falta por sentir que no cumple su promesa que otra cosa. Y te repito, para mi la madre del bebé no le pidió que fuera ella quien lo adoptara sino que lo cuidara, que se encargara de cuidarlo. Y si ella fue criada bien, su madre tan mala no ha sido, y si son una familia dispuesta a adoptar un bebé tampoco parecen tan malos... <br>  Que ella se pregunte verdaderamente si quiere un hijo o si quiere cumplir con el pedido de la mujer que ha muerto. Si se responde a esta pregunta ella sola se responde su conflicto.|`|hdLLvhAYaa	Chales!!, este caso esta como de pelicula<br>  <br>  Me recuerda la de Maria Isabel...<br>  <br>  Bueno, pues si esto es cierto, lo mas viable seria que tu amiga fuera al DIF  a tramitar la adopción, aunque si probablemente se lo quiten hasta terminar el juicio, o quiza no se lo quiten, esto es el riesgo..<br>  <br>  Suerte para ti y tu amiga<br>  ..|`|imPAEE3Taa	Creo sinceramente que un acto de solidaridad no puede pertimirse en una situacion como esta, no estamos hablando de una mascota o algo asi<br>  criar un hijo lleba muchas responsabilidades, darle amor y una familia estable es lo mas importante no solo las ganas|`|mMWYj12Daa	oues es una decision muy gruesa pero alla tu.|`|sb3PVevxaa	para mi la adopcion esta biien pero a la veZ esta mal<br>  el lado biien le da  hogar amor de una mama a un chiiko que nesecita<br>  en vez de abortar mejor ponga en adopcion!<br>  <br>  <br>  si x un mubdo mejo!

Por que los hombres tienen mejores derechos que nosotras y pueden buscarse jovensitas? no te digo que te busques un jovensito que pueda ser tu hijo, pero tampoco quiere decir que te busques a un viejo que pueda ser tu padre ;)  aspira por alguien que tenga una edad considerable y que pueda amoldarse a tu edad. suerte.<br>  PS: no creo que todos los hombres maduros quieran mujeres jóvenes.. eso es muy subjetivo.|`|SDHvDNGJaa	A todas las edades, lo mas aconsejable es tener fe en una misma!|`|y0y445hXaa	la edad no cuenta lo importante es la confianza y la seguridad que debe tener la mujer y su madures para volver a empezar en cero.|`|3NfRVhrFaa	no hay edad|`|ChUuSWvEaa	Es muy cierto lo que dices de los viejos, pero ahora se estan imponiendo nuevas modas y muchas mujeres le llevan a su compa?ero entre 5 y 8 a?os, todavìa no es muy comùn pero ya existen varias parejas, ahora si ya tuviste una relaciòn y no fue la adecuada, esta vez tienes que fijarte en lo siguiente: no importa el fìsico, lo que màs importa en una relaciòn es que de verdad te ame tu pareja, porque  si realmente te ama siempre te va a procurar todo lo mejor y va a tratar de superarse lo mas que pueda, es cuando ha llegado el momento de tener una relaciòn o romance permanente, ademàs recuerda esto NO IMPORTA LO QUE DURE, LO IMPORTANTE ES QUE SEA BUENO!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!...
