20090205124607AAWiMnE	Health;Mental Health	What is wrong with me?	i'm 13, and a girl. I am optimistic, but i can't help but be emotional... i've tried to not be so sensitive. i don't know what it is, but i've been going through something for the past two years. i don't know if it's depression, or borderline personality disorder. but i get nervous for social situations, such as i'd get sad if someone didn't say hi to me, and i'd think maybe something was wrong and they thought i was annoying. my family has always been a big problem of my life. i argue with my parents constantly, i wish i had a less complicated family. but it's kind of strange because after we fight we go back to acting normal like nothings wrong, and it just feels like a big lie. also i have pretty low self-esteem, i try not to. i try telling myself that i'm a beautiful person inside and out and should have no reason to bring myself down. i honestly feel like no one understands me. i have friends, it seems like to other people that i have a normal life, but deep down inside i feel like i want to scream. i have considered cutting but always tell myself not to because i don't want to go that low. but something weird is happening... recently i've been feeling just so hopeless. like, within the past month, i started getting nightmares ALL the time, about my boyfriend breaking up with me, about no one liking me, about just feeling lonely period. and i've recently not been hungry at all. the only thing i eat is a snack, and dinner. i used to eat lunch and more breakfast and more snacks but i've just not been hungry. and a habit i've always had is to forget about my problems and act like everythings alright with me, and i feel normal for a while, until it all catches up with me later... and i feel worse than ever. (problems as in emotional problems, and bad memories with my family from the past) i just feel plain lonely. the only thing i can relate to is music that's lyrics relate to my life. that helps a LITTLE. but i'm sick of this. i'm sick of feeling like this, i'm taking a stand. any suggestions? does this sound like a disorder? thanks.

20090205130902AA82fQr	Health;Men's Health	My boyfriend can't climax through any form of sex, but is perfectly capable of it through masturbation. Help?	We're both young; 16 (the age of consent in the UK for anyone who wanted to preach). He's never been in a sexual relationship before, but was given a hand job by a girl over a year ago and came. He masturbates in a strange way though; not upwards, but pulls his penis down as he does it, down and leftwards, as he's left handed.   Apparently this feels better and he's unable to come in any other way.      I think this problem could be anxiety related, as he can be quite nervous and feels under pressure to finish. I keep telling him it's nothing to worry about but he still does.      I've been in two partially sexual relationships before and haven't had this situation before-one premature ejaculator, and one guy that took about 45 minutes to come but still got there in the end.      We've tried oral and normal sex, and although he says it feels fantastic and way better than when he does it himself, he still can't reach orgasm.      It's a long distance relationship and we see each other every month or so, so he's abstaining from masturbation for the week before I see him, as he's then coming to stay with me for a week.   He's done this before for a few days but it's made no difference....         All/any help would be greatly appreciated!

I was in a public bathroom today and I saw a sticker on the cubicle door saying that tampons are a thing of the past and to use a femmecup. www.femmecup.com It's alittle cup that goes inside you like a tampon but catches the flow and you empty it in to the toilet and re-use it. (The website explains more) I just wondered If anyone has used them? I think the idea is a bit disgusting... as I am alittle bit squeamish but I haven't tried it so I can't judge. Has to be better for the environment as there aren't so many tampons and pad strewn across our landfills.       If any one has used them, how did you find them? did you find it better or worse than tampon use?       Thanks  =)

20090205140144AA3ySP3	Health;Mental Health	What can cause weird perceptions?	For the past month, I have been experiencing weird perceptions.   Sometimes, if I look at a clear span of area (the ground, the floor, a desk), it seems to be shifting. It might look as if it's pulling apart, or it may have a landslide effect, etc.      More recently, along with seeing things shift, it feels as if everything around me is moving to the side. Sometimes I see an area shift with this feeling, or sometimes it might just feel as if everything is shifting (though I see nothing actually moving.)   I thought this would go away, but it hasn't. I thought I needed more sleep, but even if I go to bed early and get a good night sleep, I still feel these things.      Only a professional can truly diagnose me- I know that and have an appointment soon. But I would like opinions on what this could be.      I also have anxiety and depression- could this be caused from that?      Is this some early/light form of psychosis?      In a question asked before, someone mentioned eye/ear problems. I'll keep that in mind.

My daughter who is 9 started having very painful "blisters" pop up all over her legs and so I took her to the E.R. and they cut them open and drained a few of them, (they held her down to do this as she screamed, very hard to watch as a mom) but they did cultures and it came back as M.R.S.A. and I do know a lot about this infection, I got it myself about 5 years ago after an operation, it started out as what I thought was just a staff infection but it turned out to be MRSA and I had it cut open 5 times and drained and was on meds for 8 weeks.  Since then I have never had any issues and they said it was gone but that I could be a carrier, so I have always been careful, it is only transferred through bodily fluids.  Well they said that it is highly unlikely that she got it from me, but that she could have picked it up anywhere, that 10% of the population has it.  My question is how could she have gotten It, she is always at home or school, she has dance class once a week but other than that she is home.

20090205141044AAtX0uq	Health;Women's Health	Problems with having sex?	okay, I am 23 years old and I think that I have a problem with sex. I don't know if I should go see a doctor or not but I would really like some advice. I used to be a really sexual person when I was about 17 up unitl about 21. I don't know how to explain it but most of the time when i have sex now it seems to hurt. There is certain ways or positions that when i have sex it hurts and then when I go to the bathroom to pee it hurts worse, then the next day I am fine. Besides that factor I am just not in the mood to have sex anymore, it does not desire me like it used to. It is not my fiance cause I am still sexual attracted to him and he turns me on but I just don't wanna have sex. I had a baby in August and then I went on to birth control. I don't know if it has something to do with my hormones or not but I am just don't into it anymore. I was approached by my fiance last night and he has noticed a change and asked me if I was okay. I am I am just not in the modd to have sex, the only time it seems to do or make me want to have sex is when I drink. I don't think he would ever leave me but it scares me. I don't know what to do so if anyone has advice please give it to me.

20061204213832AAYo3Qa	Health;Mental Health	Alcoholism and "Temptation"?	I've been clean and sober for over 7 yrs. I stopped drinking back in 1999, and quit cold turkey. A friend of mine introduced me to a NA program, because she was a recovering Addict. I was the only one in that group who said, "I'm ____, and I'm an alcoholic". Well, needless to say, I stuck out like a sore thumb, but I always felt uncomfortable going to the meetings as there was no feedback to what you were talking about, during those meetings. It was a downer for me, and I quit going. So, here I am, 7 yrs later, and I'm feeling like I'm trying to 'justify', in my mind, how having a drink or two, won't KILL me, as long as I know my limit. Of course, you know, if you have a drinking problem, there's no such thing as having ONE drink, and a THOUSAND is NEVER enough!! I know this, but in my head, I feel like I'm trying to give myself permission to 'try it, again', knowing the consequence. What do I do?

I came from a very strict religious household, and was essentially brainwashed into believing sexual thoughts were negative, thus I tried to turn off my desire when I was younger, believing I was "bad."  I once had a very healthy sexual appetite, and now I feel like it's significantly diminished. I started birth control 8 months ago, but I don't know if I can attribute that to my low sexual appetite.  I am now in a wonderful relationship, but I can't help but feel abnormal. I really only get very aroused maybe twice a week? I love having sex, but I sometimes feel that crazy level of desire is only there when I haven't had sex for like a week or two. Most of the time I just have a desire for closeness. All the physical changes that are associated with sexual arousal are present, and I can orgasm fine.  Have I screwed myself up permanently by trying to turn off these sexual thoughts when I was younger, or could I suffer from low testosterone levels? Or is it just possible my sex drive is normal  variation and I don't have a problem? This is really beginning to affect me and I don't know what to do! Please help!

20090205142010AA0nAvX	Health;Mental Health	What do i do with my life?	Throughout my life i have had a horrible experience. I had willm's tumor (Cancer in the kidney). For years i was in bad schools and ended up in many situations that the police (not shitty school security) have to become involved. Ive been beaten up, threatened to die, and to what i consider extreme bullying by a good total of 30-40 people in my school. (An incredible amount of emotions were being bottled up by this time and will continue untill the 10th grade)After 7th grade i moved and things began to get a bit better yet i still had alot of problems at home with my brother (who has been abusive since i was in 5th grade) and my parents who did a cruel thing and told me they were getting divorced if i didnt do better in school, which just made things worse. When i hit 9th grade things got alot better yet there was also another problem that had been with me since 5th grade, which was an overweight problem as well as very strange gynocomastia. Socially, i was "ok" in ninth grade yet i also had a videogame addiction which had followed me since i had cancer. Things were getting better since i picked up the guitar and i stopped my video game addiction by march of that year(last year). I had a great summer and by the end of it i decided to begin loosing weight and from mid august to mid september i got from 177 to 159. As my birthday came up in october 7th things were just getting better and better yet i had this irritation problem building up. I picked up swimming again(i was in many championships when i was little and when i had cancer) yet i stopped by the end of that month. By the swimming i dropped another 2 pounds. During late october i began getting intense mood swings. I went to the hospital after a huge epidemic of crying, laughter, depressions and huge stress. In early november my mood swings ended but i obtained depression and anxiety issues. I had several incidents during that month of me seeing people and seeing them dissapear, as well as hearing voices telling me to give in and worship the devil. The worst one made me yell out "Take my soul" and i ended up seeing someone appear right next to me and then just kept on walking. The depression worssened along with a huge amount of stress (Forgot to mention since late october i began seeing a psychiatrist). By learly to mid december i was at the point of crying to how bad i felt and how stressed out i was with my school work and emotions at the same time, since i was trying to maintain a good grade. My parents took me on a so called "vacation" during christmas break. The reason why i quoted vacation was that when we went down to florida we spent 80% of the time buying things for my older brother and his apartment there. When we came back i was getting ready for my surgery to remove most of my gynocomastia in which i had been waiting for over a year to do.(The appointment was set for me to wait a year). I got two extra weeks off of school for some recovery yet i still am recovering today. about a week ago i had gotten my weight down to 155 and i stopped eating as much as i used to. I began eating only once a day because i was afraid of gaining weight again and for the past two days i didnt eat yet my mom found out and kind of made me eat today. My weight dropped to 151. I was trying to become anorexic on purpose. I am worried if im going to do more things to hurt myself. I kind of think im doing this for medical attention in which is something that i love having, its somewhat something i lookforward to anytime something happens. Or i might just be doing this for attention in general. Im worried i might go a step higher and do something worse not to mention the suicide attempts i had during my depression stage.   Since i stopped eating i have had my energy drained almost completely, im having alot of concentration issues, i have felt kind of light headed and i nearly collapsed a few hours ago in the bathroom. Im pretty worried and i dont get to see my therapist untill friday, and i dont want to tell my parents cause all they will do is yell at me, and no i have no one else to tell this to because my friends wouldent really care too much, they would laugh at me or they would just not understand because their lives have gone pretty much perfect so far. I am wondering what to do?!(I did not want to type this all again so I am using this from another question I had yesterday)   My problem today is that I felt even worse today, in fact ive never felt so bad that I felt like I was dying inside, and I still have to go to school with this. My parents wont give me a day off because I already had my so called “Vacation” when I was out recovering from surgery. Today I got home and I still feel like **** but a little bit better from earlier. I feel a bit empty headed and stress is just building up more more and more and im up to the point of crying now. Im getting more thoughts of suicide and planning to just make myself sleep through benedril and Nyquil. What do I do?

20090205144257AAP8pzg	Health;Other - Health	Doctor question! Avulsed fracture of humerus (at the top), in sling, pain worsening?	Hi.  A week and a half ago I slipped and stopped myself from landing by grabbing the kitchen work surface, but kept slipping!  I sustained an avulsion fracture (small, I believe) to my left humerus, close to the shoulder, towards the outside of my body.        I was given a sling, have had one appointment with the fracture clinic, and was advised to carefully rotate my shoulder now and then etc.      That was fine, but three days ago I was trying to get dressed when suddenly I felt a kind of "ping" and intense pain, a little lower down my arm (slightly closer to the my elbow, the pain is very localised, at the "front" of my arm).  Ever since then, I have felt this awful pain on about 30% of any movements I do with this arm.  It really hurts when it happens!  I could cope with the pain if I wasn't worried that it means I have possibly sustained further damage to it!      I am worried that I may have pulled the ligament or the bone further away from their proper place.      Or is this kind of pain a normal part of the healing process?      I can't rest it as much as I would like to, due to my circumstances, but I am sensible and I am doing the best I can (i.e. kids sorted but no housework that needs two arms).      With two young children, on my own, no-one else can get them ready for school.  My daughter has special needs and needs much help dressing. She still needs nappies (pull-ups). Thankfully her brother is understanding and is dressing himself.      Please advise A.S.A.P.!      Thanks.

The last episode of depression I had lasted 3 months and then I was put on antidepressants.  The one before that lasted 9 months.  I've been on antidepressants for months so they should be working by now.  Now I feel depressed again and I don't see my doctor until the end of the month.  Would it be ok to up my dose a bit until then, to get me out of this episode.  I'm not suicidal now, but that can easily change if this continues.

20090205125116AA4UFgZ	Health;Mental Health	Visual Hallucinations due to distress/fear. May be genetic? Or could it have really been a ghost? Interesting.?	A female friend of mine had a nightmare, a very scarry one i might add. She wouldn't tell anyone what it was, or what happened. She tried to block it out of her mind, and repressed it whenever somebody would bring it up. The girl thought the dream was real or something? A few days later she said she seen an old lady, with skin that was so old it looked like it was made of bark. She seen her in the bathroom as she was washing her face, and again in the room. She was shaking because of how frightened she was. I think it was a hallucination.      The family believes in jinn, they are kind of like a spirit that lives amongst us. Its an islamic thing i dont know anything other than that. They called a religous figure, and they said there were jin in the house. Her mom said she seen them before as well. I think she may have put the idea of this into the girls head, I don't know. I don't believe in the existence of jinn, so the only thing i can think of is a genetic disorder, where under periods of extreme anxiety, the person can see things that are not there.      I was thinking dementia? but i have no club. Please help. any input is appreciated. Thanks

I'm only 14 and not sexually active at all but I really don't want to have it at camp!!!  Also, how long does it take the Pill to really "kick in".   And would this month, since it only has 28 days, would it change my schedule around a little??  possibly???  And I just got it today too which really sucks I hate the pain!   And the other camp (one i don't want to go to as much but will if I have to) starts July 12.  But if my cycle changes around this month, I might run into July 12th months from now.     ugh this really sucks, and I don't want the camp filling up before I can sign up for it, I can't wait another month and see what happens!!   Please help me!!!

I kept having them a couple times a week in random spots around my body, but for the most part they went away.

I went to get a physical since I really wanted to make the team which I did not. And at the physical it turns out they want me to get x-rays for my back...again. It is pronounced Skull-E-Os-Iss. I was born with it, they even do not know if I have it. Last time in the x-rays, it showed up 3 degrees, if it is 25 degrees then I have to get a back brace. The doctor thinks it changed alot in a bad way and wants me to get another x-ray. And now I am crying....I hate doctors...x-rays....back braces which I have never had.      I was 7 when they first told me I need to sit straighter which I did, and how could it have gotten worse, it has been a year since the last x-ray.      And can x-rays cause cancer?      Also...my mom is just says it is just an insurance policy but I am pretty sure she is lying...what do you think?      Please Help me and answer all my questions.

20090205154052AAKYEfM	Health;Women's Health	Have you ever forgotten to wipe after pooping?	Very personal question :(      So, I'm on my period. The other day I was at my bf's house. He was cooking us food and I really REALLY had to go poo, so I just went to the bathroom. At the time, my flow was really heavy and I was dealing with that and had to change my pad and all that stuff. AND I TOTALLY FORGOT TO WIPE MY ANUS. I guess I thought I did, but I didn't.      So after we ate, we started getting involved with sexual things but I never took off my pants or underwear. While I was giving him a bj, he put his hand down my pants (in the butt area!) and I bet you know what happened. He took his hand out and there was POO on his finger. I was so embarrassed I started crying while he was washing it off in the bathroom. I ended up finishing his bj... and he continued to make out with me after wards. But now (today) he keeps making fun of me, calling me "poopy" and saying "at least I know how to wipe". This has NEVER happened to me before and he actually thinks I was walking around with poo in my butt all day because I never told him I just went at his house (too embarrassed to). He said he thinks it was disgusting, and he's just not making me feel any better about it. I feel so insecure. I already felt insecure before this happened because we almost broke up a couple weeks ago. I just don't know what to do. I feel so disgusting and immature... I guess I'm lucky he's still with me, but I'm just worried that he won't ever be physically attracted to me again :( Any advice would be helpful.      AND YES, THIS IS REAL, as disgusting and as fake as it sounds :( We've also been together for a little over 2 years.

I was just told by my physician that I have a non-aggressive lesion on my distal femur called a fibroxanthoma. I researched it and it seems harmless, however, I also have a renal cyst on my right kidney and have had two lymph nodes removed from my neck as all of the lymph nodes in my neck have calcified. Is it possible that all of these separate findings are somehow interconnected by a disease/disorder/etc? Or are they really just isolated findings that are not related?

My husband have type 2 diabetes High blood pressure and high cholesterol .He haven't been taking care of himself and not doing what his Dr.recommend him to do.It's been almost two years since we found out that he is a diabetic,and he is not taking this seriously.      He had two skin infection and had to be hospitalize back in Aug 2008.Now since then he never went back for a follow up check up.The Dr gave him medication to last for 3 months but he need to see him more offen to check for any organ damage and to make sure that everything is ok.Before the infection he hadn't been to the Dr. in about 6 r 7 months and i know that he wouldn't have went if it wasn't for the infection on his leg,but the only reason y he went was b/c it was so painful that he couldn't take it. His refills ran out  back in Nov.He haven't been taking any medication for none of three diseases that he have.I have been asking him to go back to the Dr. But he haven't done it yet.I kind of know all of the risk that he is taking b/c i did a lot of research on diabetes but one thing that i have notice lately that i never read about is itching. He starting to itch more.Is this one sign that his sugar level is not under control? Do u scratch a lot more as a diabetic.   He don't even know what his blood sugar level is b/c he never ever check to see if it's to high r to low. If so what does this mean for a person with this diseases. Will this itching stop once he start doing the right thing and start taking better care of himself r will this b something that he have to live with for the rest of his life. Am afraid that he will have more skin infection.The area were he itch is starting to turn into dark scars and i try to remind him not to scratch his skin .I tell him to scratch with his shirt down and not directly on the skin.I told him by scratching he can break the skin which will not heel easily but it seem like he don't care.

I would go to sleep fine and everything feeling good. Then in the early morning from about 4-5 i would wake up and use the bathroom. Note: I was okay before i went to the bathroom, when i came out and lay down back, i started feeling sharp little pains, then it start to increase and become more tense and very severe until i have to bend over to walk. Then i started feeling nauseous so i would go in the bathroom and vomited. the pain is still there, hardcore pain in my lower abdomen. So to relieve this i would force myself to sleep so i wouldn't feel anything. Then when i wake i am quite okay again, but if i touch my abdomen i would feel the pain really bad.

Two year ago my partner was diagnosed with depression and was offered medication by gp which he refused. Shortly after i had our 2nd child together and every thing was going well, we had a lovely new daughter he was in a job he loved, it wasnt a fairytale there was still some rough times but we were managing to work through them.  Then last September the place he worked for went bankrupt he received an ok redundancy package which got us through christmas but i also had to return to work which i wasnt planning to do but was more than happy to do so our family could survive.  Now since January thing have went downhill rappidly he is isolating himself more and more choosing not to get out of bed till mid afternoon and when he does get up he will either go out on his own or sit by himself all day till about 10 o'clock when he goes back to bed. I am now finding it really hard to cope with the kids, housework, working fulltime and still trying to be there for him when he pushes me away. And its a visious circle because any time i suggest to go away for a weekend or go to pictures e.t.c he refuses cause "i am not spending your money!". I am so tired and just dont know what to do he has desperetly trying to get a job but with the whole "credit crunch" there is just nothing out there, and he refuses to go back to the gp. Now even our six year old son is picking up on it saying "i miss the old daddy".  Please any advice welcome

20090205135739AAkIJEi	Health;Mental Health	Am i as worthless as i think i am? what can i do to help myself?	I'm 17 and i'm a lad. I don't know fully why i am the way i am. I find it difficult to talk to people, to be out in public. Some days i can't leave the house because i just can't face the world. I don't go out very often, maybe once every few months i go out for a social occasion. I have a  few friends, but i don't know why they like me. I don't think me dad even cares about me, never mind loves me. He views me more as more of an accident that he's bound to rather then as his son, whereas he simply adores my older brother. My brother uses me a lot, usually as a crutch to make himself feel better.In his own words he pretty much summed me up as to how i am to both he and my dad 'always second'. My mother truly loves me but i feel like such a failure to her. I don't feel worthy of her love and feel guilty that she does love me. She constantly feels guilty about my brother and my dad and how they treat me. Especially after my brother his hit me or my dad has threatened to kick me out. I live with my dad and my mother lives in a village a few miles away. My brother can drive so he goes to both houses and is treated like he is the center of the universe and gets angry when i disagree to his attitude and beg him to treat mom with a little respect. I can't maintain a conversation with anyone and usually i'm the silent kid. I go for days at a time without saying 5 words. I worry about all my family, who each have serious medical and finicial difficulty and try to be supportive as i can be. ironically no-one seems to care how i am, how i feel. I hide as much as i can from my mother. She has so much to deal with, how can i put another nail in her coffin? I feel so alone and crave to be with someone, but when i am with someone i want to be alone. i just, i just want someone to care about me, i want to be loved. I want to be able to be totally vulnerable to someone and have them not hurt me, but to hold me as close to their heart as i hold them. I feel broken, and hurt. It actually feels like a force in my chest, crushing me inside. Whether it's phantom or not i don't honestly know. I'm afraid of people, afraid that i'll never find anyone who will love me for being me and not because they can find things that they love me doing for them. I have long stopped caring about my life, i would welcome death if i wern't such a coward. I don't feel much anymore, the hurt seems to suffocate everything to the point where i find very few things that bring me a little bit of happiness. I want to embrace the world, but i can't face it and so i shut myself in my room and wonder what's so wrong with me and what i've done so terribly that i've ended up like this. I just want someone to love me, i just want someone to care.....
20090205140038AAES8IE	Health;Men's Health	Gaining muscle...Any tips?	Ok, so I started out the school year (Sept) weighing 130, benching 95 pounds max. 4 Months later (January) I weighed in at 155, benching 170. I have a very high metabolism and I only gained 25 pounds in 4-5 months. Do you think its possible if I eat right I could weigh in at 180-190 for football this summer? I want to get bigger 155 isn't good if I want to be starting OLB. And most kids are like 200 lb and they make fun of me, My dad also told me over-eating protein can get me really sick and will damage my organs, so Im scared to eat a lot in the day. Im 155 and I want to take it 10 pounds at a time, So I eat 165 grams of protein, but I feel like before I go to bed I can fit in another protein shake but I will end up eating 190 grams of protein and I can "damage my organs and get sick" Its really hard for me to gain the weight and I dont want to get sick at the same time, any hints if anyone has been in this position? Thank YOU

20090205142406AA84UQ4	Health;Other - Health	Mystery Diagnosis Anyone?	Okay, I seemed to be having a few weird problems for the past month.  First off, just to let you know I'm 13. I have a missed period of almost three weeks, and compulsive eating habit has been developing in the past week (I normally don't eat alot, no more than 1100cal a day, now its almost 5000cal). It feels like their is a giant block in my stomach that wont digest and an irritating pressure in the back of my head. I also tend to fall asleep and stay in an unconcious state for more than 10 hours. Every time I try to exercise (cause I'm supposed to be on a diet and is backfiring because of this) I get tired and black out.  And there hasn't been any results in my diet in the past 2months, I've only gotten fatter. Any suggestions?      My parents think I'm having problems at school and faking it, so please don't recommend that I talk to them about it.  I have no problems at school, I'm a straight A student with tons of friends and in the school select jazz band.

20090205153407AA81TPv	Health;Diseases & Conditions;Other - Diseases	Sudden severe light headiness?	I was in the supermarket a couple of days ago and was feeling perfectly normal. When I had an urge to urinate so I went off in search of a toilet. As I was walking I suddenly felt progressively more and more light headed until my eyesight started to go (you know the static you get on TV's it was exactly like that).       My feet gave in on their own and I just colapsed. Luckily I was STILL conscious enough to support myself with my hands and tilted my head downwards.      After a couple of seconds the static like vision went away and I got back up again. By this time I was being walked to the sickbay by someone. However, they said they had to leave me for 10 seconds so they could find my mum. As soon as they stopped supporting me the static/fuzzy vission came back and I collapsed but was able to support myself to stop my head hitting the floor. I could hear screams so my hearing was fine but for some reason my vision was going nuts!      After about 20 mins of having my feet elevated I was fine.      I'm a medical student so am curious as to what caused this sudden drop in blood pressure that caused me to loose vision and cause me to collapse. The weird thing was I was still conscious but barely so it couldn't be normal fainting.      This has never happened before, the doctor said I must have been ill but I was perfectly fine.

I am so incredibly excited to have FINALLY been diagnosed that I almost cried with relief in the doctor's office!  lol  After years of suggesting PCOS to my previous gynecologist and never being taken seriously, I went to a friend of my family doctor who happens to be a VERY good gyno. Anyways, he has prescribed 500mg of metformin for 30 days and then 1000mg daily thereafter. I have a couple of questions:      1) Did you feel any negative side effects from metformin?   2) If you lost weight, how long did it take for you to notice the weight loss and how much did you end up losing?   3) As for facial hair and/or acne, how long did it take before these symptoms subsided?      I eat healthy and exercise at least 30 minutes a day 4-5 days per week but struggle with my weight (due to the PCOS). I am not using the metformin as a "magical" weight loss pill but I do that is one of the good side effects and just wanted to know how long it should be before I start to see results. Thanks!  =)

This is really weird too:  I've never had any signs of having a period until the day before or the day of.  I kept thinking I was going to get my period on time because I kept cramping below my belly button and was feeling kind of sick. When I finally got my period, it was really light and the color was light too, but it darkened up.  It's been 2 days (today is the 2nd) and it looks as if it's about to stop.  Also, after my period starts, I quit cramping but I'm still mildly cramping and when I smell things that I normally like, I feel nauseous.  I also have bad headaches.  Do you think I could have ovarian cysts or a worse problem? I'm scared it could be life threatening even though the pain isnt bad.  Also, my lower back hurts.  I really hope someone on here knows because when I went to the doctor, I was told that I couldn't be seen because my insurance was canceled because I turned 19.

20070319182420AAN0RXr	Health;Diet & Fitness	Liquid diets?	Ok so I pretty much want to be smaller and kinda put myself on this "liquid diet" kind of.  Basically I have a soy shake (all soy...I hate cow's milk) for breakfast and sometimes for dinner.  Every now and then I share a sandwich with my friend (which is normally the only solid food i have)      Yeah Yeah I know its unhealthy but just curious....will it work to lose inches?  I couldn't care less about losing weight....just inches.  I don't plan to get to the size I want then spring back on normal foods.  I think I would start on something a bit negative like oranges and plain salads (like super plain....no meat.....just lettuce and maybe carrots....stuff I would munch on anyway)      So just curious....would it work?

And if i can get financial aid to help pay the classes?   Oh and if its true that before they hire you do you have to have work for at least 5 years in a dental office where they train you, and then take the certification test?    It seem like a lot of time for a dental assistant if you know the true time period it takes please let me know.   Thaannks in advance!!!

(it seems like i dont have one)   until the other day i was just, checking myself down there and i found what might be my other labia minora, its obviously on the other side of my large one and connects in the same places but its extremely small but quite thick and normal coloured, whereas my larger one is somewhat stretchy and darkly coloured. im probably being really stupid but is this my other 'missing' inner labia or is it something else, and is it possible to not have labia minora??      just a little concerned, please advise.

I usually don't have a chin-up bar (and hotels don't really appreciate you hanging off of their door) available, and every "biceps targeted" variation of the pushup that I've tried seems to work the other muscle groups too much, without isolating the biceps.

20090205121419AAhB85D	Health;Diseases & Conditions;Other - Diseases	Unknown seizures - Epilepsy or Potassium problem?	Hi & Thanks for your time in advance!!   I'm a 27 year old female, who started having seizures about 4 years ago.   I've had 4 or 5 grand mal seizures, last one was in March of 08. And about 2 or 3 petite mal seizures a month (dizziness, tremors, loss of sight or tunnel vision, loss of memory...) they vary in strength everytime.   Full blown Epilepsy is VERY heavy on my mothers side, so the doctors just claim thats my problem. I've had EVERY neurological test done & the results are all normal.   BUT, EVERY grand mal seizure i've had, the E.M.T tell me I have EXTREMELY LOW potassium. Then I go to my doctor for blood work, and all my levels are fine.   I've tried just about EVERY seizure medication there is, from depakote to tegrotol, & am currently taking Lyrica, 200mg 3 times a day. And if I feel a seizure coming on, I am supposed to take a Klonopin, which is chewable. That calms ME down but does not always  prevent the seizures.    I can drink SmartWater (which contains electrolytes & potassium) and it makes the "seizure sickness" go away (for the most part)   IF I miss a dose of the Lyrica, or am late on it, i have a seizure.   but i think this is a potassium problem.... Or is it really epilepsy?

I know this may sound funny but I had a scary feeling in me that I covered myself with the covers like a 5 year old.    What does that mean? Was I having a dream, or how can it be explained?

20090205144656AAfr1lC	Health;Diseases & Conditions;Other - Diseases	Help making a diagnosis?	A female patient, age 30, visited her physician regularly and ofter complained of excrutiating headaches. Since the age of 15, she has had a consistent history of frontal headaches and pressure over the frontal sinus. On examination, a protuberance was noted in the region of the right frontal sinus. No other symptoms were evident, and findings on the Ear-Node-Throat examination were normal. A single-photon emission CT scan of the cranium showed increased bone metabolism in the area of the right frontal bone.        In view of the absence of any complications, no tissue biopsy was performed. The patient was prescribed bisphosphonates for symptom relief. A follow-up CT scan, 1 year later, revealed no progression of the lesion.        The female, who was married and planning on having children in the next few years, was concerned that her condition might affect her pregnancy or be passes on to her offspring.        Based on the information presented in the case study, what type of diagnosis would you present to this patient?        Are there other signs and symptoms of your diagnosed disorder/disease? if so, what are they?       How does the diagnosed disorder/disease affect any of the tissues we have discussed thus far this school year? Expain the snatomy and physiology behind this disorder/disease.
