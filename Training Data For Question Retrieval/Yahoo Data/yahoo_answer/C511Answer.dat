LE7aZ2yvaa	Don't ever doubt yourself.  DOn't worry about not being in mensa.  Remember Andrea Yates? Yea the murderer of her six babies! She was a member of MENSA.. Where is she now.  My point in saying this is not to discredit your bf for being intelligent, but to tell you intelligence doesn't dictate superiority.  More importantly there is more to life. The content of your character, hwo you treat people, the simple things in life, happiness, are the most important things in life.    Plus you are smart.  He is lucky to have a sincere person, there are qualities of you that are just important and may be qualities that he is lacking.  Chin up! You have nothign to be ashamed of/|`|6qsocyK3aa	Intelligence should not be based purely on an IQ score. Yes, it has its place but intelligence is much more complex than simply doing a test. IQ tests don't measure common sense, emotional intelligence, artistic intelligence, how intelligent you are at understanding human nature or anything else that gets you through every day life (when, apart from in an IQ test have you have to answers one of those "If brigs is heavier than brags and brogs is heaviers than brigs, what does brogs weigh?" questions? You get the idea.). All it tells you is that you are good at an IQ test (basically maths, english and various problem-solving skills). So while you may be just average at that sort of thing, he might lack so much common sense he can barely tie his shoes! You're just as brainy as the rest of us my dear. :)    EDIT: The point I was trying to make is he isn't going to be good at everything. No one possibly can be. Even people with high IQ's are going to be bad at something. What are your strengths? Maybe you're a great painter or writer or something. Maybe you're better at empathising with people than him (woman often are). Everyone is good at something. Even if his IQ is high, so what? What does that proove? That he has aced an IQ test, that's all. You know you can actually learn how to be good at them? I've heard of people who have practised and ended up getting an IQ of about 150 when the first time they did it, they got just an average mark. You see what I mean? IQ scores proove bugger all.    And remember, you're his girlfriend for a reason. Obviously you give him something no one else can give him. There is some quality about you that he finds special. :)|`|cSqx1DxKaa	MENSA members comprise more than just the top 1% of the population.  But anyway, IQ is really irrelevant.  I know several people with relatively high IQs that are complete idiots.  IQ isn't everything.  Your boyfriend is with you because he likes you and appreciates who you are.|`|OgaJqkSQaa	I got into mensa and I'm a complete fool. I didn't do amazingly at school, either. It only measures a certain way of thinking, not really how clever someone is or how many A Levels they're capable of getting.    Anyway, I can't see how having an intelligent boyfriend would make you feel inadequate? An ex of mine was a highly qualified medic and I didn't feel inadequate. I knew he was 1000 times cleverer than me and I used to pick his brains all the time! It was handy to have him around. He knew I was as thick as sh*t compared to him but he loved me all the same....|`|sciO32Bsaa	because much like you people like him often have a hard time making friends and bonding with people because most would think he's just weird so even though you may feel "inadequate", top 1% or not I'm sure there are many areas of his life where he feels that way too.|`|HNCa1C53aa	you may not be in the top 1% of the population, like your boyfriend...but alot of people are not. He probably is with you because he likes you (your attitude and your looks), that's kind of how love works. I say you have a very great boyfriend and should be happy!    you are soo not inadequate! cheer up! :)|`|Gxog88I3aa	Instead of feeling inadequate you should just be very proud of him.      Remember he loves you for who you are and obviously you are Intelligent enough that you do not bore him.  If he felt superior to you the two of you would have nothing to talk about.    Also you are not ugly and you must at least be a nice person to him or he would not love you.    Be Happy and quit stressing!!!|`|sMpALAMgaa	well he is with you, so doesnt that point to something about you being pretty good?    if hes as fantastic as you say he is, then obviously he sees something in you being just as good as he is. for all you know he may think himself inadequate for you, its amazing who can feel insecure.     if you still feel inadequate go and ask him why hes with you, or ask others what they think is good about. try to find some confidence in yourself, it gos a long way if someone this good is interested in you then obviously youve got something to be confident about.    good luck  ave fun :D|`|d8h5h8IVaa	Get over it.|`|0SQou2X9aa	hes with u because he loves u.he probably think ur the preetiest,smartest,fun lady hes ever met.dont ruin it coz of baseless insecurities.n remember the most attractive feature in a person is CONFIDENCE.u cn loose or gain weight,rich or poor bt never loose confidence.believe that ur worth him being with u.
FIG58FVpaa	It sounds like you have a bad cold or possibly the flu. Drink lots of fluids (slowly if you feel nauseous).

SpcYCBndaa	once a week|`|GrwWH5XJaa	I'm bad at flossing my teeth. Whenever I do, it makes my gum bleed. So i stopped doing it =(|`|2c556debd7c1c18834aeac39fbfe496caa	Yes, I can't stand to go without doing it once a day now..Makes my mouth feel so much cleaner..|`|1aSrTpbhaa	Ever since I bought the little floss picks that are so easy to use you just stick them right between your teeth, I use them daily.  I have sensitive gums to I think its important to floss too.  Also, ever since I got my braces off I enjoy flossing a lot more =)|`|oGyL9WJ1aa	Unless I pass out drunk, yes I floss every night.|`|xhjSPd0uaa	2-3 times a day  but thats coz i got braces.  use to do it once a day x|`|McYp8luoaa	Never do. :)|`|MczmTftTaa	I keep floss just to get food out from inbetween my teeth when it's bothering me.|`|aariLFAMaa	I do everynight but sometimes I get away with not flossing here and there like once or twice a month only because I got lazy.   Just thinking of sleeping with that food inbetween my teeth grosses me out! That's why I make myself floss everynight and if your gums start to bleed after flossing that means you have gingivitis from not taking care of your teeth! You want to avoid that!|`|BaxwbIk8aa	I actually floss everyday. My mother is in the dental field, and I've seen some scary things happen when people don't have good dental hygiene.|`|48e80d4dffb6b005f6946b03af059d5eaa	Once a day, everyday!|`|dx7QSbkVaa	in the morning and at bed time and after every meal or snack|`|Om9CFRpsaa	Floss every night  to keep your gum clean. This will prevent cavities, gingivitis, and oral cancer. Small food debris can get stuck in your teeth, and left to decay overnight this debris will turn into bacteria and cause cavities.  Flossing after meals is recommended, too, for the same reasons.  When your gums bleed if you brush your teeth or after flossing, these are the first signs of gum disease and tooth decay. You can make your gums healthier by starting to floss again. I carry floss with me inside of my purse to floss after meals.
WadzK6ejaa	Cat can transmmite toxoplasmosis .so be careful|`|XjthKyp1aa	most probably yes,normally not only canine carry the rabbies also feline carry the same rabbies as canine carries,so be careful!|`|Fd0hvyoyaa	YES! Cats wash theirselves with their tounges so all the germs will be on their tounge. They also lick their bum so your basically eating cat poop. No offence but it is sad that you let your cat do that. I love my cay so much but i never ever let him lick my food or drink out of the same bowl as me.
BG8vMyZjaa	? Diabetes, see your doctor for a blood test.  ? High temperature - infection,flu or a cold.  Spoil yourself if this is the case.  See doctor if it doesn't clear up.  ?

aSwSyjuNaa	Maybe because you might need some aerobic or cardiovascular activities. Try running a mile for a week; or even simply talking a walk should help. What you are doing are only strength-training, and if you have a layer of fat over your muscles the latters won't be obvious and you'll only bulk up.    Also, nobody can lose weight by simply exercising as little as you do. Diet and exercise go hand in hand. But by diet I don't mean calorie-counting nonsense; I mean a good, healthy diet, with loads of fruits and veggies, good carbs, some protein and whatnot. Cut out the sugar in your daily diet and you might lose weight just by doing that. No soda, no diet coke even, no artificial sweeteners, etc.|`|811921e95b3795dad10075b3f9e12029aa	doh!  Muscle weighs more than body fat - you won't lose weight!  You need to find the machine that measures percentage body fat if you want to check your progress.|`|kn6Lrf6Raa	maybe its the way your body is, you don't need to lose weight anyway, you're not overweight but if you insist i'd say go to your local gym and get some professional help.|`|0m7kEIDiaa	If you dont eat enough of the right foods , your body will try and keep the fat by using up muscle as energy.. so maybe you should look at your diet?  YOu are also still growing and so should be eating plenty and healthily..  I also agree with going to the gym for advice.

It is very hard to concentrate & relax at the same time.  Being relaxed & comfortable with yourself & your surroundings is a great help.  You might practice looking in a mirror & reading out loud to yourself - or singing.  You might want to consider taking a course in public speaking to help overcome self consciousness & shyness.  Take a course in sefl assertiveness to gain confidence & become more positive.  You must make a commitment to YOURSELF to make improvements & stick to it - or it aint gonna work.  Good luck.|`|PpKJIT0aaa	Speech therapy does wonders for this condition.    You're in a bit of a Catch-22, though. When you go to speak, in front of several others like in class, etc, you immediately fear rejection (being laughed at) and before you have even opened your mouth, you are pretty much in shut down.. therefore you stutter, they laugh, and once again you 'prove' to yourself... whatever negative belief you have.    PLUS, you get even more annoyed, so your brain gives your body the message that it's not cool to stutter, and the next time you go to speak up, guess what happens??    Around and around you go. No wonder it isn't working.    So... what to do about it. Speech therapy, as mentioned already. Relax. Compose your beginning words in your mind, take a deep breath, start to speak. Stop. Compose the next sentence. Relax. Another deep breath, etc. This is best practiced in the privacy of your own room, till you get good at it.    That's the surface side of things, the symptoms.    Now to the meat of the sandwich. Somewhere along the line you have experienced a scenario whereby you were bullied, laughed at, made fun of, teased, etc (it's often at school presenting something to the class), and whilst you may have forgotten about it, your body mind and emotional mind hasn't, so guess what the default setting is when you are in a similar situation again? That's right: knocking knees and stuttering speech.     Try to find the memory of what kicked all this off, and deal with it. Look at what happened (ask your inner being to show you), let it play out, then give the younger you some balloons with empowering words on them like strength, resilience, a sense of humour to cope with it, etc. and let the younger you absorb them.    Forgive whoever and whatever went on, including YOURSELF.    Then let it go.|`|rLsphyqhaa	I don't know if there is any kind of medicine for it but many have that problem. Mel Tilis is very famous for his songs but he stutters like crazy and it is sort of his trade mark. One of his daughters is also a singer don't know if she stutter or not.   When I was ACS some years ago i had one of the troops who would stutter very bad. We all began to notice that once he went out into town and had a few beers and I think a few other thing took place also(not at all uncommon over there)he would come back on base and could talk just a clear as any one. So we could only guess he was more relaxed mentally and phycial. That just might be your key is to chill out. Not saying to drink or get yourself into a situation that might make you settle down with a family, but calm your nerves practice looking into a mirror and telling your self to calm down. Best may be to see a doc and see if they have any medicine for you.
tAYXUXreaa	Well how old are you? Have you started taking a birth control? You may have reached a point in your life where your body has matured and now has lighter periods. This usually happens over a period of time, but maybe you are different.    If you just started taking a birth control or have switched recently then this is a side effect of it.     Another possibility is that your body is dehydrated. If your body becomes dehydrated and you do not drink water it will start to conserve water where it needs to be. This one time I got the flu really bad and vomited for a week straight. This just happened to be the week of my period, my period the first few days was really light and then it went to a black and then just completely stopped. At the time I was thinking I was dying...This could be a common thought when you throw up for a 7 days straight. Try drinking more water and see what happens.     Another possibility is that your stress level is extreme right now which will always change your cycle.     And one last possibility. Have you started working out more in the last month? Lost a bunch of weight? These all can make your period either stop or slow down. Your body needs some fat to have a healthy cycle. If you take the fat away, it has no choice but to stop or create a much lighter period.    Sorry so winded. Hope that helps!|`|pYJvLnoMaa	duhhhh u r pregnet thats wat happend 2 me wen i got pregnent|`|6rOJZxxSaa	prego|`|oL3AoLPsaa	could be first trimester spotting which isn't a period at all, get a test|`|kp0QYdb9aa	im sure ur not pregnant but u might have an infection? i would get it checked out if your badlyy dizzy|`|4pqL4QFLaa	sokay|`|DWqyK0Mbaa	Its probably light since you got it early...:)       Dont worry my periods have been extremely normal and regular for years..n suddenly it changed...|`|ViNFT9RQaa	it depends- are you on birth control? sometimes hormones are to blame for abnormal menstrual cycles.|`|V4iZcrVmaa	consider ur self lucky girl cuz i always have cramps wahhh|`|VjkDIvezaa	if you lost a lot of weight or gained a lot of weight or if it is your first 2 years of getting it that is normal.

I sometimes get the nightmare worst period where its totally heavy and than other times its really light.|`|8uJVN1n3aa	Why are you asking me? I'm a man.|`|ya1pNLtGaa	Go see a gynecologist. Don't wait, any time things are weird with your period or you have abdominal pain you should get it checked out, the sooner the better, Things only get worse with time.|`|mMByiHaQaa	Periods vary they can change at any time and do anything.

Well if you are really concerened Maybe going to the doctor would be best. If your eating like a pig that is a sign. and if u havent eaten that much then ur pregnat!|`|3urpilpBaa	Depends on how old you are.  If you are really young this is probably normal.  I would take a pregnancy test just to confirm you are not pregnant ($8 is totally worth putting your mind at ease).  If it goes on for more that 3 days I would call into a gynocologist and make an appointment.  In fact I may call a gynocologist just to seek advice.   If you are drinking a lot of certain herbal teas it can sway your hormones and fluctuate your period.
AA10864194	seriuosly you need to think about your options  and abortion shouldnt be one of them. and   to the person saying i dont beleive.. why wouldnt  you beleive? my 12 year old cousin got pregnant  why is it so hard to beleive? this it the world we  live in today get used to it|`|HWnhBCXiaa	The kid is too young to be a father in the social sense. His parents and the girl's parents should decide to have an abortion or put the kid up for adoption. A twelve year old is not going to be a father - his parents if anyone, will be the kid's parents.     You have to be a horrible parent to stick a baby to a twelve year old. Adoption is what I'd choose for my son.  As to how to support him... just talk with him.|`|6qsocyK3aa	Tell him to reasearch childcare so he is prepared, like how to hold and feed a baby properly, that kind of thing.|`|ya1pNLtGaa	Wow, that's to bad. Help him research the government programs he can get on to support his child. If he is not religious help him find a church, he doesn't have to believe but they will help support his family.

KrsVJ5XTaa	Try to rest as much as possible. move slowly if you have to go to work , take deep breathes and try to not get up and walk around too much. Sip water all day,just don't drink too fast or it could upset your stomach. Eat a bland diet,  Bananas, rice,  toast, applesauce and get well soon!    If you can, try to get some gravol into you, the ginger stuff is really gentle on the digestive tract|`|b52aec304160f164ffbd53c65e826f2aaa	Maybe you are pregnant!|`|EMbaak9waa	Unfortunately rest is all you can do to recover, if you don't rest it will only make you worse. Go to the doctor and get a doctors certificate so you can take it in to work when your better.
cl6r8cGBaa	no, it means its either you're drinking a lot of h20 or your having kidney or ureter trouble.|`|AA10766729	No.  It means your fluid intake exceeds your metabolic need (in other words you're well hydrated).|`|x3EPqezJaa	No. It means you drink a lot.     If you pee a lot but only a little each time, then it could mean you have a urinary tract infection or a bladder problem.    If you pee a lot and your bladder is full each time, then you're drinking a lot. If you are nevertheless always thirsty, then that could be a symptom of diabetes.

"That's good.  they're nicer."  but they knew right away what to ask.)    they'd probably even have a suggestion where you should go, if you need to, to save you some money.|`|IMPvzBk1aa	Most likely this is an allergic hypersensitivity reaction to whatever you contacted....either a bite or a contact dermatitis. You can react this way to plant borne toxins like poison Ivy, or from insect bites.  Soaking it in cold water will help to soothe it.  You can use cold damp washcloths laid over it.  Calamine lotion or poison ivy preparations can be used to stop the itching.  it is also safe to use preparation H hemorrhoid ointment which would soothe itching and reduce any swelling.  but do see the doctor for a diagnosis.  If it is poison ivy, you can spread the toxin by scratching it and transferring it to other areas.|`|s9AzdrNlaa	Don't hesitate - take yourself to Hospital NOW.

2OO9U8o9aa	Anything that adds a bit of suspense will add to the excitement . , even just slowly unzipping him is hot , Ask him to wear button fly and that can be really exciting as you slowly undo one at a time|`|YRsCMVvnaa	Of course this is a good idea! I suggest trying this on a pair of your own jeans first. Just make sure you can do it before you try it on him. There is no bigger turn off than when a girl tries something new like this, messes it up, and ends up scrapping the whole idea completely.|`|Fgz5xWxOaa	yes, most likely.    but be careful not to scrape your lips or gums or chip a tooth on a metal zipper!|`|JHRqYs3Raa	Yea he wood just dont get u no wat lol stuck|`|Q5qpMLOVaa	Depends what follows.

29I8PWrxaa	Sometimes you need to try a couple different brands before you find the most comfortable ones.  But I find that after having a tampon in for several hours it starts to move down a bit and gets uncomfortable sometimes, especially if it is getting full.    If you want to try another brand, I find the most comfortable ones are Playtex Gentle Glide.|`|AR8AyFqbaa	it was full and needed to be changed    they hurt when full|`|2VtFVKCDaa	You are most likely using too high of an absorbency or you didn't have it in all the way.|`|ya1pNLtGaa	they don't hurt when full|`|WJjr2E0haa	Well, it could be a couple of different things....you could have used a tampon that is too big for your flow OR sometimes it will hurt when it needs to be changed. Remember you don't need to wear one that is too big for your flow because there can be serious medical problems.|`|Co9I2OMSaa	It was probably full and needed to be changed.  Sometimes though, depending on your flow, you might want to change it more often, every 2-3 hours, then it won't hurt.|`|PX4KlDQhaa	You may not have pushed the tampon in far enough.  If you barely pushed it in it could be rubbing coming out.  Make sure you push the applicator all the way up when you insert it.  When a tampon is placed in correctly you should not feel anything at all.|`|aMQD2UnWaa	It may not have been all the way in and was between the vaginal wall muscles, which does make it uncomfortable. You will figure it out. I've been using tampons for 30 years and that happens to me every once in a while. Please be very aware of the facts about Toxic Shock Syndrome. Be careful using tampons and never sleep with them in.     Good luck.|`|WiuZ4yVdaa	you probably didn't have it in al the way.
BRT2teSqaa	Everything is good except the avacados for a diet.  While avacados are VERY good for you , and I mean VERY GOOD, it does have a LOT of calories, which is obviously bad if you're on a calorie restricted diet.|`|G3TEO6C7aa	Avocados are very high in calories, believe it or not. Baked chicken is a very good choice though, there is lower fat content than fried chicken. Which means less calories.|`|8RQCa3SXaa	one piece if chicken has about 220 calories (if its a breast piece) so two would have about 440. advocado contains quite alot of fat too.    also, there is no carbohydrate in you meal. this would also temp to to snack in the evenings.    this meal isnt exactly low calorie, it has about 550. so i would swap it for something more balanced, like just one piece of chicken, boiled potatoes and broccoli.    Hope this helps (:

They are most often transmitted by skin-to-skin contact during vaginal, anal, or (in rare cases) oral sex with someone who is infected. About two-thirds of people who have sexual contact with a partner with genital warts will develop them, usually within three months of contact.    Genital warts are not always spread through penetrating sex. Some studies have shown that in female virgins, genital warts may be transmitted through non-penetrating sexual contact.    In women, the warts occur on the outside and inside of the vagina, on the opening to the uterus (cervix), or around the anus.    So I would not use the same soap, towel, body scrubber, etc... as anyone, especially if you know they are infected. I hope this helps and I would be very careful. MC
tPx7y6Abaa	My son is now 10 and he had bronchitis for the time he was about 1 until he was 3 or 4. Some kids are just more apt to get it then others and it seems like there is no break in between. If it worries you or concerns you than you should ask for a request to see a specialist. It never hurts to be careful and you as the parent knows best. Never let a doctor tell you different.|`|S79P5Q3Eaa	If the child has had Bronchitis for 2 years that is definitely not normal in my opinion.  I would most certainly call a specialist to see what the underlying issues are.|`|3b19545514d9f2ad32a6ef7b4dca83acaa	I don't think it is abnormal - if your child gets it all the time  then made the doctors might look further, but at this time of the year kids get colds and coughs a lot.  my grandson is 5 and has had a few times but his doctor says not to worry.
54a8ab2a075f3228053ce1f8fb3b394aaa	Not bad at all. The color deals with hydration and how much water you drink. The more water you drink the lighter the color. The less water, the darker color.|`|AhO0Uoppaa	o---k, your pee being too yellow isn't good for you means your dehydrated etc.|`|8TmK8Qklaa	It's only the color of the pill that colorizes your urine if your'e hydrated and if you drink a lot of water it won't do as much as it would for someone dehydrated.|`|uXjb9yMYaa	you pee yellow when you dont have enough fluids,its normal to pee clear|`|pb7qPJcxaa	it means you're drinking enough water.|`|OLXv3DEAaa	Some types of B vitamins will make your urine bright yellow. This is not the same as when it is darker because of dehydration. There are certain things in the vitamins that just change the color to a crazy yellow. I am not sure what it is though- I think its excess vitamins but it might be that certain types/compounds do not do that? I guess you could see if they are using a different brand or soemthing, all the B vitamins I've used have done that to me and I drink TONS of water. I wouldn't worry about this though I don't think its a health issue or anything.     Just randomly- you shouldn't take big amounts of B vitamin every day as its not necessary and they are fat soluble not water soluble (they don't wash out of your system) so the extra WILL stay in your body and collect. That can be unhealthy.|`|oszDKWf1aa	Take lots of Vitamin C and you will see your pee will be yellow. I go on and off Vit C and if Im on it it is yellow and if Im not its clear. Also if you take lots of fluids it will only be your first pee to be yellow|`|JQIztxIlaa	Not all B vitamin makes it yellow. It's niacin and niacinamide.|`|CNlfn5Wraa	What else are they taking? Doesn't sound right to me. I take Vitamin B complex and it doesn't affect the color of my urine.|`|wFN8bVqsaa	It is completely normal to have yellow pee after taking vitamins. The color is from the excess vitamins/nutrients that your body does not absorb. Completely natural and vitamins are good for you! :)|`|ay0FEQaiaa	nope. if you drink lots water it dilutes your pee causing it to be clear. i take vitamins everyday but my pee is clear because i drink a lot of water. if that's not what it is then maybe your body uses up all of the vitamin. their pee turns yellow because it doesn't use all of the vitamin and it gets rid of the excess through pee. maybe your body uses it more than your friends.
XHnpraaxaa	Go see another doctor and if you still are having so many problems may want to consider a shrink.|`|aSTmFCiBaa	try eliminating white,bleached flours from your diet,change to whole grain wheat,rye,rice flours,,,,don't smoke bong,,no milk or dairy products,or chocolate,,,,,get a bottle of liquid centrum multivitamin..plus a good calcium/magnesium supplement,also,don't eat cashews,corn,peanuts,chicken for a few weeks,,,,trey seeing another doctor to rule out circulation problems,atherosclerosis|`|o5ueyi5Yaa	For the dizzyness you may have just slept in a way that was pinching your bloodflow or you actually slept so rested your whole body was just super relaxed. Then again if your taking meds for the earlier mentioned feelings and your taking your meds before you go to sleep a slow metabalisum could be to blame for the dizziness meaning that your meds were in your blood stream and as you stood up they rushed throughout your body causing the dizzy feelings.     The air, and you feeling pressure may be due to high blood pressure. Are you taking a med for your blood pressure, or does one of the meds your taking say may cause such and such or so and so? If your having a ringing in your ears and or feel your pulse though your body then one of your meds may be what's causing the other feelings. Read the paper work that comes with whatever else it is your taking and you may find your answer there. If not journal how your feeling and be as spicific as possible so that during your next doc appointment you can hand your doctor your journailngs and they can be better informed on how to treat you. I don't know about you or most people but before I started journaling or note taking about how I was feeling or how My body was funtioning I would never remember everything, and I spent years before getting the right help for Myself. I hope something I've said will be of help. J

xLmtXZJ0aa	you might have type 1 diabeties, I would get a checkup!|`|Co9I2OMSaa	you are just going through puberty- the eating lots is because you're growind, weeing a lot is because you're eating a lot, tiredness is caused by hormones, you just need more sleep.  getting angry easily is also hormones, growing up.  your blurred vision could be from standing up or sitting down too fast, or doing an activity that maybe causes too much physical activity or too quick motions for your body- or maybe at that time you haven't had enough to eat.    just hormones- you're just growing up|`|ya1pNLtGaa	sounds like puberty. I don't know about the blurry vision but the rest sounds like depression. Get plenty of exercise and make sure the food you are eating is good food. It also may be diabetis.

I lose my temper sooo easily i got kicked out for 3 schools for fighting so just try and find soemthing that clams your nerves leave the school early if that was clams your down.|`|6qsocyK3aa	That is a question for your doctor, not us. It COULD be hormonal but I can't say for sure.|`|sXeyRD9taa	It's either hormones, or you are REALLY bad eating habits since you're a growing girl you need to be eating the right foods and getting your vitamins and nutrition.        I was a vegetarian for like 2 years and I became angry and gained weight. I found out that I wasn't eating the proper foods to be a vegetarian, I was eating junk food without meat haha.

You can also start with push ups and some dumbbell flyes as it will grow muscles underneath your flab. That can also help.<br>  <br>  I also suggest, like I do for everyone, to go on a juicing fast before you start any program. It gets rid of toxins in your body and can shed a lot of pounds fast, in a healthy way. Check out the site below for anything you may need regarding juicing. I go there all the time and comment or email. The guy running it is a personal trainer and a rockstar at advice.
LR30v9Eqaa	My story is exactly the same as yours. I have quit half a dozen times (even threw out my ashtray once so I have been using a bowl) but I really need to exercise but cant because I cant breath. I really don't think the patch and gum work worth crap. And it terrifies me to think what I will do in nervous situations where I resort to smoking. But I quit for about a week and half and my breathing got easier and everything and when I smelled smoke it was like my lungs closing up again so I removed myself from that area. I would say try chewing gum or keeping yourself busy so much that you dont have time to think about it. Or every time you get a craving go running or drink some water...of course it wont totally satisfy you but hopefully keep them at bay. Good luck!

067fa6dfc93e782fff815f1abe45eebaaa	You wouldn't tone up at all! With no protein in your diet your body would gradually lose muscle, so about the time your starved yourself is when you would see your muscles.|`|RleNFBuIaa	You realise you are going to have to eat atleast a little bit of meat!   Meat is not the culprit! I can name thousands of other foods that are many times as bad as meat in relation to the fat content!  Like ice-cream... **** like that definately need to go if you want to tone up!  45 minutes on a skipping rope is quite good! It gets your heart pumping, gets your body working... in relation to calorie deficit it depends on how much skipping you do in 45 minutes.   From past experience i skipped about 1100 skips in about 50 minutes and that burned about 300 to 400 calories.   Not too bad at all! I recorded it on a pedometer by the way.  Skipping is good exercise!   Stay motivated and keep at it!
ce060a29a8e7cbb3f7cdc004ec90adc3aa	Alyssa, the problem is excess very thick mucous in your nasal cavity. I tend to have this a lot myself and the following has worked successfully for me for years.<br>  <br>  Take a 2 oz spray bottle (available and many health food stores), fill it 3/4 full with alcohol (isotropy or Ethyl are acceptable) and add 10 drops of essential oils of Camphor, Eucalyptus and Peppermint to the bottle and shake it well and then top off with more alcohol.  Spritz your pillow liberally about 15 minutes before you go to bed. The alcohol will evaporate and leave behind a fine covering of the mixture of sweet smelling oils. The oils will open up the sinuses and allow for more comfortable breathing during your sleep. This is especially beneficial if you tend to sleep on your side.<br>  <br>  If you can't find a spray bottle then anything that will hold about 2 fluid Oz of liquid and spray a fine mist will suffice. If the bottle is clear then store it out of the light. If it is a dark material then it can be kept anywhere.<br>  <br>  Good luck with this and let me know how it worked.<br>  <br>  Brightest Blessings,<br>  Raji the Green Witch|`|QE77Oxtqaa	I would try a nasal spray before bedtime. I'm having the same issue. Get the kind with a fine mist, it doesn't run out of your nose as easily.

tG5PSmwAaa	eating chocolates (hershey/snickers/ those kind of chocolates) before going to gym may cause low blood sugar. It'll make you tired. so I suggest don't eat chocolate...you should eat something that is more likely to keep your energy levels more stable.
XSu3dedGaa	You're doing a good job, it'll soon scab over and be fine, it's just like a graze on her knee, just in a different place.<br>  <br>  If you can, when she's at yours and you can keep her from getting stuff in, leave it without a band-aid on, let her skin breathe, it'll heal better, put the band-aid on when she goes to child-care it can look as clean as you want, but they've still got kids running around all day every day, kids pick up nasty things. If you tell the minder about the cut, you can ask them to clean it and put a new plaster on it every so often so it stays clean.<br>  <br>  If you daughter doesn't like the band-aids you can try spray on plasters, you can get them at most pharmacies, they'll keep dirt and water out but your daughter has nothing to fiddle with and nothing to get in the way of her playing.<br>  <br>  Your basic first-aid kit if perfect for this type of graze, you're doing everything right.<br>  <br>  It won't take long to heal, you're doing a good job of helping it heal by itself.|`|35etSURMaa	put oitment on it and keep it covered at all times.|`|kqkgro5Zaa	Just put some cream on it and talk to the teachers tell them that she needs to stay out of sandy areas or any places where dirty can find its way into her wound. Also (make sure your watching her!!) let it air out every day for about five minutes, during this time she must NOT get any and i mean ANY!! dirt into her wound. So just make sure the wound is clean, creamed,bandaged, and aired every day. She should be fine very soon.
6AS8xmnyaa	it means you're nervous usually.  but if it's shaking insanely then you should tell your parents/guardian and or see a nurse/doctor.
12GHDExwaa	Hopefully this will not be intentionally.  The poison control center in their local town should be notified and get to the emergency room of the nearest hospital.  Hazardous products should just be used for what the intent of purchase is, and then discarded in the designated  drop off point in the town.|`|zFsTSrOcaa	There are different types of rat poison.  Strychnine is a traditional favorite; in humans, it can cause agitation, convulsions, and death.  A more recent option is warfarin, which interferes with blood clotting and causes death by hemorrhage.  Interestingly, warfarin is also used in medicine as a "blood thinner" and anticlotting agent (brand name Plavix).<br>  <br>  Since there are different kinds of rat poisons, signs and symptoms can be different.  If someone has ingested suspected rat poison, call a poison-control hotline (check your phone book or online) and provide as much information as possible.  Different poisons require different treatments, and the treatment for one poison make cause more harm if a different poison was ingested.|`|4V2Odsygaa	you're not thinkn of knocking someone off are you?(LOL) If you want to know for sure I think you can contact the poison control center.|`|9bG4PRRUaa	yes it will kill you<br>  and if someone ingests it you call poison control|`|Q8fcepcZaa	i suspect it depends on the dose. what is just enough to kill a rat might not be enough to kill a human, but eating enough of anything is bound to kill you.|`|ARmhMq5laa	sodium fluoride *ingredient in rat poisoning* is in toothpaste that's why they say don't swallow it so no more then you would accidentally swallow while brushing teeth..but straight rat poisoning is definitely not good do not ingest any amount.

One of these mornings you will wake up after your first wet dream and then you will know you are then producing significant amounts of semen.<br>  <br>  Remember there is a difference between sperm and semen.

If it is in the shape of a bowl it is positioned correctly. If it is flared at the edges, it's inside out & needs to be flipped over before insertion into the eye.<br>  6) Keeping contact lens on right forefinger, pull down lower lid with middle finger of right hand.

Look straight ahead.<br>  8) Continue holding lids in position while now looking up, down, to the left & to the right to allow lens to adjust to proper eye alignment. Slowly release eye lids & blink. Contact lens will center itself automatically.<br>  9) If lens is not centered, close eyelid & gently massage contact lens into place through closed eyelid.<br>  10) Repeat above steps for left eye.|`|AA12021966	Hold it open for a few seconds with other fingers.|`|RgwJ1PNnaa	If it's folding up it could be inside out.

8RQCa3SXaa	you dont "go" anorexic. this is a mental illness that evolves over time.    you can't choose to have a mental illness. you're mind eventually develops into thinking you are fat when you aren't.  anorexic people physically see themselves as fatter than they truely are when they look in the mirror.    as for bulimia, don't even go there. it rots your teeth and dentists can always detect it.  also, you will stop growing taller from lack of nutrients.    please take this seriously. Bulimia and anorexia isn't something you can snap out of. it stays with you for life, even when you feel as if you have beaten it..|`|WwXrTQgaaa	stop eating junk. take a vitamin every day! drink a LOT. run a LOT. get MAD at your body and force it to get into shape!|`|4BE2ZSdZaa	dont bother goin anorexic or bulimic they both are as bad as each other and have serious side effects, death is 1 of them, unfortunatly you cant lose weight quickly without mose likely putting it all back on again, just stick to a 1500 calorie exercise an hour a do (try cardio for 1/2 an hour) but dont worry there are a lot of people overweight, be strong and good luck. hope I helped|`|drzN1kkuaa	dont do bulimic, or anorexic. youll get a rep as those "werid girls" or become very ill, just cut down on calaries.        breakfast - fruit, or juice. and cerial or bagel/toast.    lunch- [idk, but keep it to a minimal]    dinner- same as lunch, minimal.|`|Fd0hvyoyaa	Simple. Don't look in the mirror.|`|qiIlZLs6aa	Eat healthier....start exercising....all there is to it.

Good luck!  Stay away from crash diets that say 10 pounds in 7 days, etc etc etc|`|bqCGovxFaa	its ok ! Calm down sweetie.    You are only in 8th grade but it is important to be healthy.  Look at your parents.  Are they overweight too or were they as a child growing up? It might just be in your genes and it might not.  Some people just thin out when they get to high school but that's mostly for males. I was overweight in 8th grade too.  i remember feeling the exact same thing and wanting to be thinner like all my friends and so boys would like me. and unfortunately i wanted to be bulimic and anorexic too. But that's not the way to solve your problems.  There is no way to lose a lot of weight really fast.  The only good, healthy way to do it is to stop over eating, stop eating fast food and exercising a half hour a day or at least for an hour 3-4 days out of the week. Its hard at first but you get use to it :)     No matter if you are thin or a little plus sized, you are beautiful.  And if people dont like you for the way you look then they aren't your real friends and they aren't worth your time.    I hope this helps you.     Good luck with everything you do in your life :)|`|fMS1kDA2aa	dude, just take your time and eat carefully. Just eat less fast food, have smaller portions and have lots of grains and vegetables and fruits. If you go bulimic or anorexic, that's as bad for you as weighing 800 pounds. Don't stress about it, stress could cause you to eat more and gain more weight. Don't take any of those BS weight loss pills either. Pick a sport or hobby too, maybe just run around the block once or twice a day. Take your time, you're really young and just not consuming food to loose weight will REALLY mess you up.|`|40yAoIrNaa	Do not be so hard on yourself! You are in 8th grade, your body is still growing. Do not even consider going bulimic or anorexic! Eating disorders are so unhealthy.. and will mess with you, physically and emotionally. You should loose weight in a healthy way. Try bringing veggie wraps or a salad to school instead of buying lunch in your cafeteria..Also, since you are still in school, take advantage of the sports that are offered there! If you do not want to be on a competitive team, see if your school offers any intramural activities. These can help you have fun and make new friends too! Also a quick and easy thing to do is start taking walks. You can take a 30 min walk around your neighborhood everyday, and you will notice a difference in the way you feel and look in even the first couple of weeks! Just try to get on the right track.. and first try to embrace your body. Once you start exercising, you will feel much better. Try to focus on the positive instead of the negative. Good luck!|`|o5EGMbpjaa	neither bulemia or anorexia are a good idea. you are only what like 13 or 14 you are still going to grow. you still have the body of a child. even though you are a teen. You Might be one of the kids who is chubby while young but overview grows to be talk and skinny. that is how the body works. but if you really wunna work on your weight you should talk to your parents and tell them you want to start eating healthy bc you are a little concerned about your weight and not sure if its healthy for your age. just eat a little healthy and be active like play a sport. go play outside. just don't hurt yourself in the process. k hope i could help you!!

ufgv7oTjaa	Between Glucosamine Sulfate and Glucosamine HCl, a good chunk of the difference would depend on the person taking it, unfortunately.<br>  The Sulfate and the HCl molecules are bonded to the Glucosamine to stabilize it and help the absorption into the body, so it would depend on if your body absorbed the Sulfate or HCl form better. Honestly, most people don't notice much of any difference between the two forms, so either should be perfectly fine.<br>  If one of the two has Boswellia, that would most likely be better for your joints because the Boswellia helps with a different aspect of joint health. If you are looking for other options as well, there are several nutrients that help joints in addition to those two and you could take all of them together safely. The most popular are Microlactin, Tart Cherries, Chondroitin, MSM, Hyaluronic Acid, and Litozin (Danish Rose Hips). Good luck and I hope I helped!|`|XinTNCJUaa	Not sure.

jvLCHuqTaa	There are several great cellulite removal treatment therapies on the market today. The most common is mesotherapy. Mesotherapy involves injections of vitamins into the target area that helps break down the fat. Does it hurt? Everyones pain tolerance is different so it is difficult to say. Mesotherapy costs $250 - $600 per treatment and only a licensed professional will be able to tell you how many treatments youd need.    Lippodissolve is very similar to Mesotherapy but it uses a more concentrated solution of vitamins. It generally costs between $400-$1000, and only a licensed professional will be able to tell you how many treatments youd need.     Endermologie is a technique where rollers are applied to the target area to help smooth out the cellulite. Generally, endermologie is needed to be done twice a week to be affective. It generally costs between $50 - $70, and only a licensed professional will be able to tell you how many treatments youd need.    Velasmooth is a technique that combines Endermologie with radio frequency designed help speed up your metabolism to burn up the fat causing cellulite. Treatments generally costs between $250 - $400, and like the other treatments only a licensed professional will be able to tell you how many treatments youd need.|`|2q1XI0j9aa	cellulite is all about diet, but it may just be her age, unfortunately when women get older our cellulite shows up more :(     if she has tried everything from working out and eating healthy and talking with her doc, she can try the vela smooth thing that is offered from laser treatment centers|`|HpqGnCFAaa	well its actually really normal to have cellulite. but there are topical ointments that can be prescribed by your doctor or dermatologist. try over the counter aloe and or skin moisturizers.

JxV6lIFyaa	If you are desperate to gain your weight back I wouldn't say it's anorexia, but I may be wrong. I would definitely recommend going for a blood test to see if the sudden weight loss has caused any damage to your liver or kidneys. If the loss in appetite continues to bother you then I'd recommend going to talk to a professional. Good luck.|`|vNlyRmB7aa	Umm...Anorexia is not something that happens to you...it's something you choose. It's an eating disorder where you choose not to eat. If you "had" anorexia, you would know it because you would be doing it to yourself to purposely lose weight. Most people would be excited about losing weight for no reason...however, loss of appetite could be a symptom for other issues.
5kwKeWsbaa	There is nothing that will prevent a night of over doing it.  Stay hydrated and dont drink on an empty stomach.  If you still wake with a hangover.

2q1XI0j9aa	about 8 months make sure you are eating the right kinds of foods in your 1200 calories and not junk food    To lose fat you need to eat lean meats (chicken, fish, turkey, lean beef) , low gi fruits (apples, bananas, pineapple, oranges), green veggies (broccoli, celery, green lettuce, spinach), only whole wheat breads (look on the package and see if the first ingredient is whole wheat flour, if it is it should be good unless it has high fructose corn syrup like Mrs Bairds does). Jillian Michaels from biggest loser has a great quote, "before you eat your food ask yourself, does it have a momma or did it come from the ground? If not don't eat it." Eat 5 - 6 small meals a day, this will increase your metabolism and help you to not feel so hungry in between meals. Its all about portion and calorie control regardless of what food you are eating, but remember cleaning up your diet and eating X amount of calories of lean good healthy foods instead of X amount of calories of candy bars (I know you are probably not eating 4 candy bars a day but its just an example) will help you lose it faster. The leaner you are eating the faster you will lose it, and you will get a toned healthy look instead of a skinny jiggly look. You also need to drink at least 8 glasses (8oz) of water a day. Sometimes hunger is mistaken for thirst so if you are hungry drink 8 oz of water and wait 30 minutes, if you are still hungry then eat a light healthy snack. Water also helps you feel fuller longer and helps flush out toxins that may prevent fat loss. Also allow your self a cheat day (but dont go over board and eat everything in sight or like 5 cakes in that day). Allowing yourself a cheat day once a week will help cut out cravings Think of it like a reward if you did well with your diet and exercise that week have a piece of pie If not just stick with you healthy food.

0l88fiUTaa	I don't know anything about the product in that link. The little advice that I can offer about male hormone imbalance is that Saw Palmetto is a pretty common herb used by men for hormone problems.  Another thing is that a healthy diet, exercise, and preventing stress  are the most natural ways of keeping your hormones balanced.    Edit: hey, also try posting this same question in men's health...maybe you'll get a lot of responses there from men with a hormone imbalance or maybe in general health....since people don't usually get a lot of answers in the alternative medicine  section : (

wwP3ONCFaa	Much of the time an ulcer is just a literal pain in the gut. BUT a bleeding ulcer can become serious, even life threatening. A bleeding ulcer can drain you of enough blood to drastically lower blood pressure and stop vital organs from functioning. If you have an ulcer and get really nauseated and suddenly throw up blood or what looks like old coffee grounds, see your doctor immediately. Other symptoms of serious trouble include passing a stool that is black or one containing bright red blood. A person with a bleeding ulcer also may become dizzy and pass out|`|4xOXiZcNaa	Aside from the black and tarry stools, which can be a problem on their own.. the ulcer can EAT THROUGH THE STOMACH LINING and allow the stomach contents to drain into the body cavity and THAT can be even MORE serious than the stools
p31vZmK0aa	who told you about the dry socket terminology at the first place , you have mis understood it completely : In dentistry, a dry socket is a layman's term for alveolar osteitis. The alveolus is the part of the jawbone that supports the teeth, and osteitis means simply “bone inflammation”. However, it is not actually an infection of the bone, but an irritation of the bone open to the oral cavity, after the loss of or premature disintegration of the blood clot.<br>  <br>  Alveolar osteitis is a painful phenomenon that most commonly occurs a few days following the removal of mandibular (lower) wisdom teeth. It occurs when the blood clot within the healing tooth extraction site is disrupted. In rare cases, the removal of the upper wisdom teeth can also result in possible alveolar osteitis.However, a dry socket typically presents as a sharp and sudden increase in pain commencing 2–5 days following the extraction of a mandibular molar, most commonly the third molar. It can also be accompanied by a foul taste or smell.<br>  The pain, which often radiates up and down the head and neck, can be extremely unpleasant for the patient. It will often cause pain in the ears as well.

But you should go for a check-up if you feel there's something wrong.|`|zAXlJpqcaa	If you are going to develop a dry socket you will probably know it around the 3rd or 4th day after extraction-it will feel like a throbbing earache.  Just call the office, they'll have you come in to have a medicated dressing placed in the socket to insulate it and alleviate the pain.   I doubt that your spitting action would be the cause of a dry socket, it occurs most frequently in smokers or women on birth control.|`|tsn34pS4aa	if you are concerned call your doctor in the AM and ask for an early follow up, most doctors have their patients come back in within 3-5 days, in your case because of concerns you should just go in for yours early.|`|Iek7D2hOaa	i'm no dentist, but if you've just had some pretty big surgery on your teeth, it's no surprise there's still blood lingering in your mouth .<br>  but, if you have concerns, call your dentist, don't rely on people on the interwebbbb.|`|AA12262106	I wouldn't worry about it too much.

I can truly understand your embarrassment to go to your dad about this, but you really need to tell him what is going on. IF you tell your dad all of the symptoms you are having, I very seriously doubt that he is going to laugh or tell you to stop being stupid; instead, I think he will be more concerned about you and your health. Also, it may be awkward talking to your dad, but there are times when you have to take your health concerns more importantly than embarrassment ... Go tell your dad that you need to go see a doctor.|`|G9liglrwaa	You could have dysmenorrhea..I was diagnosed with it at the age of 14.

I know how you are feeling, my ex was a really bad addict and now is clean.

The bad thing about abusing that drug is that it has really bad detoxing.  Throw away all of your paraphernalia, and go to a rehab to detox for a few days.
MvMMIxjIaa	Yeah, if your new to this it may be a lubrication prob, if youre dry it can cause tearing inside the vagina and cause pain there after. You said it was protected good to hear!!! Just dont usr any perfumed products down there plain water until it heals, if there is no discharge  or odour its unlikely to be an std. If the pain continues for over 48hrs i would consider going to the dr. but keep the lubrication in mind. Good Luck|`|sfL8Qr8Xaa	This could be to do with the friction of the condom on your vagina. Is it your first time? If it is it could just be because of that. Otherwise I recommend you see your doctor asap.

QPyB6Er4aa	Good morning, Just.<br>  I have severe depression and anxiety disorder among other MH problems.  I get the same crap that you get.  People who don't know what depression have no clue what we are talking about.  They think that when they are circumstantially unhappy about something, they are depressed.  They should know, right?!?  <br>  Have you gone to see a psychiatrist and/or a therapist?  That would be a really good idea.  If the anti-depressant that you taking now is not right after 6 weeks, your dr. will change it.  There are hundreds of different meds that can do better than the one that you're on.<br>  I take Wellbutrin and have done for years with a supplement which has changed over the last 16 years or so.  <br>  You WILL get to a point when you will be able to cope with things pretty well - not all of the time,. but mostly.<br>  Be happy, Sweetie.  Get intense help.|`|icJBLlUdaa	The answer is no!!  Until I started suffering from depression, I didn't believe it was a real state of being, nor did I understand the reason for people to behave this way.  I had a close friend who was always taking meds since we were teenagers.  She was always in bed, crying whatever...I used to get reallly mad at her and tell her it's all in her head and to snap out of it.  I no longer feel that way.  I went through a bad couple years using drugs...life was horrid and I think once a person experiences something really bad  that depression becomes something very easy to continue reoccuring in your life.  And there are also people who have no trauma in there lives that suffer due to a chemical inbalance.|`|k1xebxJ0aa	some people do and some just dont. it is an awfull thing. but really people shouldnt say its a weaknes and stuff because if they do they are pathetic and maybe have something they are hiding .|`|AA10674555	First, depression is many things to many people.<br>  <br>  What does a cherry taste like? You cannot describe it because words cannot adequately express a feeling unless someone has experienced that feeling before. Additionally, your feeling may not be the same as my feeling even though they are similar.<br>  <br>  Can a man or woman for that matter, know what it feels like to have a baby unless they have had one. Some think it a wonderful experience. Others not so. To each is his or her own experience.<br>  <br>  Then there is the cause of the depression.<br>  <br>  Is it caused by chemical imbalances in the brain. These can be treated with medications.<br>  <br>  Is it caused by hard wiring problems. One study looked at the brains of actors once they played the role of various mentally ill people, be it psychotic murderers or what ever. They found that their brains scanned similar to those who had the defect. They returned to normal once the part played was over.<br>  <br>  Many people are finding a treatment for depression in boosting their Glutathione. Our brain has one of the highest concentrations of it. Here is the best part, although given as a med in the hospital, the stuff that boosts your glutathione is considered a dietary supplement over the counter. There are several products available.<br>  <br>  One of the drugs for bipolar depression is a glutamate blocker. One source of glutamate is MSG. MSG is in a lot of foods. So, eliminate MSG. Glutathione clears MSG from the brain and body. <br>  <br>  Even more remarkable, if you have been depressed, you probably cannot imagine what it would feel like not to be. You cannot imagine how those who have been but no longer are could feel so good.<br>  <br>  Oh yea, boosting your glutathione will give you more energy too. You will feel so alive  you will think you are someone else. There are some simple things in your diet that will help if you want to get started.<br>  <br>  Best wishes.<br>  <br>  Hope to hear your on the other side some day.<br>  <br>  Do a search on Pubmed about glutathione and depression and you will find a lot of information. If it is too geeky, just read the conclusion at the end. Not all but some are in plain English and talk about the benefits of boosting your glutathione.|`|z2cysiEhaa	Those people just don't understand the illness thats all and they wouldn't want to know what it's like either. They simply have no idea how profound that feeling can be.
sSu33iCWaa	It's a thing that is scientifically called "Claustrophobia".<br>  <br>  There's no easy way of fixing it as it is considered a fear of crowded places. Many claustrophobic people also fear small rooms.|`|TM6C2HlAaa	Hi-- A panic attack is a sudden episode of intense fear that develops for no apparent reason and that triggers severe physical reactions. Panic attacks can be very frightening. When panic attacks occur, you might think you're losing control, having a heart attack or even dying. <br>  <br>  You may have only one or two panic attacks in your lifetime. But if you have panic attacks frequently, it could mean that you have panic disorder, a type of chronic anxiety disorder. <br>  <br>  Panic attacks were once dismissed as nerves or stress, but they're now recognized as a real medical condition. Although panic attacks can significantly affect your quality of life, treatment — including medications, psychotherapy and relaxation techniques to help prevent or control panic attacks — is very effective.<br>  <br>  Panic attack symptoms can make your heart pound and cause you to feel short of breath, dizzy, nauseated and flushed. Because panic attack symptoms can resemble life-threatening conditions, it's important to seek an accurate diagnosis and treatment. <br>  <br>  Panic attack symptoms can include: <br>  <br>  Rapid heart rate <br>  Sweating <br>  Trembling <br>  Shortness of breath <br>  Hyperventilation <br>  Chills <br>  Hot flashes <br>  Nausea <br>  Abdominal cramping <br>  Chest pain <br>  Headache <br>  Dizziness <br>  Faintness <br>  Tightness in your throat <br>  Trouble swallowing <br>  A sense of impending death <br>  <br>  You may have a few or many of these panic attack symptoms. Panic attacks typically begin suddenly, without warning. Panic attack symptoms usually peak within 10 minutes and last about half an hour. But panic attacks have many variations. They may last hours or, on rare occasions, up to a day. You may feel fatigued and worn out after a panic attack subsides. One of the worst things about panic attacks is the intense fear that you'll have another panic attack. <br>  <br>  If you have frequent panic attacks, you may have a condition called panic disorder. Panic attacks can greatly interfere with your life — and perhaps even endanger you or others. <br>  <br>  Panic attacks can strike at almost any time without warning — when you're driving the school car pool, at the mall, sound asleep or in the middle of a business meeting. And you may fear having a panic attack so much that you avoid situations where they may occur. You may even be unable to leave your home (agoraphobia), because no place feels safe.|`|WPnMXP8paa	yeah that sounds like anxiety. Do you get dizzy and confused? does your chest kinda hearts? do you sweat a lot when you are surronded by people? if the answer is yes, you do suffer anxiety or panic attacks.<br>   You know what works very good? if you don't have medication, try carrying something that smells like lavander. I use hand lotion. Smell it for a minute and it really calms you down.|`|lk9z59dDaa	Hi, sounds like crowded places are not comfortable for you at the moment. Perhaps you are feeling anxious about something else in your life and a bit of extra anxiety is just pushing you that bit too far? Is there other areas of your life that you feel trapped? Are you experiencing any trauma or loss?<br>  <br>  Panic attacks are about the panic try to think, I'm only panicking and it will be over soon, not I'm going to die, collapse or faint etc.
8mFvaWeBaa	Are you stressed at the moment? You might need to take a break for a little while. It sounds like you are really healthy, but have you had problems with excessive bleeding before? e.g. cuts taking a long time to heal. (Does anyone in your family have heamophillia?)<br>  <br>  Oh ok, if it runs in the family, then it's a good idea to talk to your GP about the nose bleeds and heamophillia, because he/she can perscribe you with some medication to help clot the blood. Stress is also a very common cause of nosebleeds, so don't be too scared.  Make sure you visit your GP as he/she will be able to put this onto your medical record. <br>  <br>  Good luck with your GCSE's and nosebleeds!<br>  <br>  Bryony x|`|9ozLBt5Qaa	Stress can cause it.

I tried absolutely everything, but in the end the only thing that worked was having the inside of my nose burned. It isn't nearly as painful as the procedure sounds - you will only feel a small amount of discomfort.<br>  <br>  I have never had a nosebleed since.|`|qGBklnngaa	nosebleeds can be a sign of something more sinister, especially recurrent ones. If they have only recently started to become regular and persistent, you should visit your doctor, especially if you have lost weight, look pale and feel tired. Nosebleeds can lose allot of blood apart from anything else, so you need to get it checked out.<br>  <br>  good luck x

LYhiCV4saa	Hi, Sumbuddy. I'm sorry you're feeling so stressed and afraid of people. It sounds as though you urgently need to seek some sort of counseling or therapy to help you overcome this situation.<br>  <br>  Have you tried counseling? Have you always been this anxious or was the problem triggered by bullying or abuse? Try not to be so critical of yourself- it's not fair to accuse yourself of having "no guts" or being a "coward"- anxiety is a mental health condition and not something you should be blaming yourself for.<br>  <br>  You're still only 23 and have many years ahead of you, so please get some help and start enjoying your life. Don't give up! Jenny<br>  <br>  Edit: I'm very glad that you're getting some help. Lots of people suffer from anxiety and there are some effective treatments. I'm also glad that you've been able to talk with your family- having support is very important. I'm sorry that you've had to live with your anxiety for a long time, but hopefully you'll be able to see some improvement soon. The more recent tension that you mentioned sounds quite severe, though- I hope that can be resolved quickly. I really wish you well- it sounds like you've had a tough time with this.|`|qGh1HhPwaa	You call me anytime and talk, email me for the number ( I have a toll free one as well) if you want.<br>  Life is too short to waste it.|`|y9tMWuQjaa	I feel your pain. I have very similar problems, and we're even the same age. I have given up on a Masters degree because I couldn't bare it any more. I felt like I was a failure at life, despite having intelligence. I became frantic that my CV has gaps all over the place.<br>  <br>  What medications were you given? I am trying the med Trazodone. It's not ideal but it helps me to sleep. I am back working and in education now. I have also had good success with Propranolol in the past.<br>  <br>  I wish you well. I suggest taking a low-stress job part time to keep your life moving. Perhaps in a library, or something similar, so that when it comes to getting a professional job when you are better, you will not have too much in the way of gaps.

KPXwwwMMaa	Compared to the average American diet, you're definitely NOT consuming too much sugar. <br>  <br>  You may want to cut back on the Pepsi, though. You should never drink your calories. If you're used to having your Pepsi every weekday, maybe you should switch to just every other day.<br>  <br>  Also, if you're having weight problems, i would cut back on the portions of your food. Use smaller bowls and plates for meals. And then snack on raw veggies in between meals to keep your metabolism up.

In order to lose 2 pounds a week, how many calories should I be eating? <br>  — Mari<br>  <br>  A: While I'd need your height, weight, and age to calculate this number specifically for you, most people generally need to eat approximately 10 calories per pound of weight to maintain that weight without strenuous activity. To lose 2 pounds of weight per week, you need to decrease the number of calories you take in per day by 1,000, or expend that extra energy in working out, — which is hard to do! Try cutting 500 calories from your diet and burning 500 calories with vigorous exercise average woman will lose weight on a 1,500-calorie-per-day diet, while men can lose weight on about 1,800 calories per day. I would not go below 1,200 calories per day, however, especially since you are exercising. <br>  <br>  <br>  Dr. Apovian is director of the Nutrition and Weight Management Center at Boston Medical Center and associate professor of Medicine at Boston University School of Medicine.|`|6e9wMh6yaa	nine pounds a month. roughly 2 a week.

No special diets really work they   only want your money.<br>  But always allow yourself a treat once a week otherwise you'll obsess about what you are missing then binge.|`|G2ehZV6iaa	You should exercise about 60 or 50 minutes a day. Also, you should think when you're full. Don't eat up to when your full. Check the scale 3 times a week and don't worry to much about your weight. Lowering your cholesterol can also help lose weight. Even if you want to lose weight, the most important thing is to worry about how fat you look. Don't skip any meals because it can make you gain weight. When you're eating a meal, just don't eat too much. Start to drink more water than sugar drinks like juice. Try to sit less and exercise more. Exercise much more than you normally do. If it's too hard for you, before you blow up,you can exercise a little more than you do. You can eat some junk food, but some more healthy food. Breakfast can be healthy, lunch can be mixed with healthy and junk, a snack can be junk, and dinner can be completely healthy.|`|sumbsdU5aa	see the best way is that u dont sit after having ur food either in day or night just work untill u dont feel hungry 4 next time and when u feel then prefer fruits and juices no fats and fast foods|`|sZOiNdD5aa	if you heard of CREVAX before, i think that's the solution to your problem, because you can lose weight even without any diet plan or exercise program, you better check it out, i've bee using that for almost a month.

AA10493307	Life is always better when it is in balance.  <br>  <br>  The modern fast-paced society has lost sight of the fact that there is a value to solitude, just as there is a value to interacting with friends and associates.  <br>  <br>  Seeking out human company is fine as long as it does not develop into borderline personality.  Interactivity with trusted friends generally has a calming effect.|`|OyBuEpOTaa	It is normal to seek companionship. Be choosy though.

p0guNQhiaa	Nope. Your blood alcohol level will be the same. Though the rate at which your liver processes it may be different and it may decrease at a faster rate. Also, the outward effects tend to appear to be less.
4yzxXO1haa	They are your family. They're there to protect and love and support you. And I'm sure they'll be concerned, but just glad to be of help in any way.<br>  <br>  Do you see a doctor of some sort? A psychologist or therapist? If not, maybe you should schedule some sessions. Find one you like, and catch up with them every now and again. It's good to have a uninvolved professional to talk to sometimes. Someone who's trained to listen and offer advice.<br>  <br>  I think one good idea regarding school would be to go to your school nurse, introduce yourself if you haven't been to her before, and explain your situation. Also ask for a meeting with the school counselor/psych. And talk to a trusted/favourite teacher one day after class. It would be good for you to have people working at the school who understand what's going on with you, and who are on your side. You don't have to tell anyone else if you don't want to.  If you decide to tell people other than your close friends, I don't want to alarm you, but be prepared to cop some flak. Depression and mental illness has a stigma attached to it, and some people really aren't as understanding or kind as they should be.<br>  <br>  When I was first discovering and learning about my own issues, I spoke to the school nurse, and she was lovely. Sometimes I needed to get out of class and go to her office and just chill. She was good for a bit of a chat and a sympathetic ear. I was amazed at myself for actually flaking out all of the time, but my advice to anyone suffering from something like depression is, learn to cut yourself some slack every now and again. Sometimes you just aren't up to facing the world, and trying to do so will just make you feel worse, and more of a failure. <br>  <br>  But at the same time, you need to keep moving, and not let life pass you by too much. I know this because I looked up one day and realised that I'd missed a couple of very important years and now I face even more of an uphill struggle.<br>  <br>  I wish you all the best. Message me if you want. =)|`|QsbYcxjiaa	wow you sound like an exact copy of me i held it in for three striaght years that i was going to be in the marine core my parents kept asking me to tell them and i finally did it feels so much better after you tell them dont worry u wont be a burden i felt like a giant weight was lifted off of my chest|`|ATh0ciALaa	i do also i find writing talking too people listening too soft music swimming watch fish but if its bad u have too talk too people im sure your fam would only want the best|`|whw3DEjVaa	try going 2 c the school councilor. make sure wen u ask to ask the person not to call ur parents and make sure the councilor dosnt either.<br>  counciling sessions are confidential and they will only call ur parents with serious situations.<br>  <br>  or talk 2 a friend about it. <br>  <br>  i slip into depression every now and then. to beat it i stay occupied.<br>  i swim, play basketbball, soccer season is starting, play drums, school takes away 6 hours of the day,.<br>  just take it one day, one hour, one minute at a time. dont think about the long run and dont get too involved in one thing (cept skool thats a different story).|`|ParFJxnSaa	Ask yourself: "Why do I feel depressed, and when did I first start to feel this way: can I associate this with any recent change in my life?" (if so, it is probably reactive [situational] depression: counselling, such as Cognitive Behavioural Therapy may be indicated, but most of life's adverse situations are resolved within 16 weeks, yet the medical criteria for depression, and the prescription of antidepressants is only 2 weeks!). Or, was it a more gradual thing, with no apparent cause? (a nutritional deficiency, hypothyroidism, environmental toxicity, or reactions to some medications, etc., becomes more likely as the cause). Antidepressants work quicker than the following; 2 - 6 weeks, but you may have to adjust dosage, or types. St. John's wort helps most people; tolerance doesn't develop, and the few side effects don't occur often, and even then are normally not severe (neither should be relied on as a sole treatment). <br>  <br>  It doesn't cause sleeping problems, or weight change, but usually takes at least 2, and generally 4 - 6 weeks to become effective, but can work quicker than antidepressants, sometimes. A recent, independent German double blind study showed it to be as effective as a commonly prescribed antidepressant, in cases of major depression, with far fewer side effects, and those were generally better tolerated, with a lower rate of discontinuation. Unlike antidepressants, where sexual dysfunction is a common side effect, it happens much more rarely with St. John's wort (I have noticed no effect in this area). A multidimensional approach to treating depression without medication follows. All except for no. (7.) are safe to use with medication, but not St. John's wort, because of interactions, and it's sensible to check out anything else first with your doctor. <br>  <br>  (1.) Take 4 Omega 3 fish oil supplements, daily: (certified free of mercury) it is best if consumed with an antioxidant, such as an orange, or grapefruit, or their FRESHLY SQUEEZED juice. If vitamin E is added, it should be certified as being 100% from natural sources, or it may be synthetic: avoid it. In the winter months, if not getting sufficient daily exposure to strong light, see <a href="http://www.mercola.com/" rel="nofollow">http://www.mercola.com/</a> SEARCHBAR: enter: "vitamin D3", & Go to a doctor and ask for a 25(OH)D, also called 25-hydroxyvitamin D, blood test. When you get the results, don’t follow the typical “normal” reference range, as these are too low. The OPTIMAL value that you’re looking for is 45-52 ng/ml (115-128 nmol/l)". The company which tests your levels has to be one of those using the correct form of test, and this topic is addressed via the searchbar at mercola.com - "vitamin D3; testing". Also take a vitamin B complex which is certified as being 100% of natural origin; a deficiency in vitamin B9 (folic acid, or folate) is known to cause depression. Around 30% - 40% of depressed people have low vitamin B12 levels. Depressed females using the contraceptive pill may benefit from vitamin B6 supplements. <br>  <br>  (2.) Work up slowly to at least 20 minutes minutes of exercise, daily, or 30 - 60 mns, 5 times weekly. Too much exercise can cause stress, which isn't wanted when dealing with depression. (3.) Occupational therapy (keeping busy allows little time for unproductive introspection, and keeps mental activity out of less desirable areas of the brain). (4.) Use daily, a relaxation method* and/or yoga*, and/or Tai Chi*.(5.) Initially, at least, some form of psychotherapy or counselling; later, perhaps either Cognitive Behavio(u)ral Therapy, or Rational Emotive Behavio(u)ral Therapy for, say, 6 months. (6.) Maintain a mood chart, and daily activities schedule**.  (7.) As options, if desired, either a known, effective herbal remedy, such as St. John's wort, (get a German variety, if possible; local ones may vary in effectiveness. Perika, and Kira brands have been recommended as being effective. Take with a meal) or supplements, such as SAMe, or Inositol (from vitamin and health food stores, some supermarkets, or mail order: view section 55).|`|ea2395751480a69caa92c51b9cfe1156aa	How do you know that you have depression? Have you actually been diagnosed by a doctor? There is all the difference in the world between true deep clinical depression, which is caused by a chemical imbalance in the brain, and simply going through a phase of feeling unhappy with your life, which can last for years and is common in people your age but is not true depression.<br>  <br>  You might benefit from counselling but you really need to see a doctor and find out if you genuinely have depression or if, as I suspect, you simply feel fed up with you lot. Self diagnosis is not adviseable, and depression gets such a lot of press nowadays that too many people are too eager to claim that they have it every time they feel a bit down. I have had true depression and believe me there is no comparison, and no way could you have functioned for 5 years with it.
VnHBNJkiaa	Trimming would solve the problem of your hair getting caught.  If you shave, it won't grow back longer, but it will be thicker and coarser to some extent.  I find a combination of trimming and shaving works best.  Shave to remove anything that would be visible when I'm in my underwear (bikini, thong, whatever your comfortable style is).  Then trim as needed to keep it in a neat package.  Tip:  Use small, rounded scissors instead of pointy ones.  There are some quality children's scissors that are fairly safe, and can be brought into the shower with you.|`|Xa9wiUnXaa	Wax it. Hair comes in a lot nicer, like no ingrown hairs and comes in thinner. After doing it a couple of times it gets easier and easier. Its also a lot cleaner.|`|pdbc4souaa	Shaving does not affect growth rate. It does cause itching; nicks and cuts can cause an infection in an inconvenient and embarrassing place. Nothing we say here will convince you to leave it natural, so do minimal trimming. <br>  <br>  I agree with the guy who says that men prefer a bushy merkin.|`|rLsphyqhaa	It is only going to get so long but if you want to have it that is up to you to maintain it. As for me I would just keep it trimmed very nice much faster and easier to deal with. I understand many girls like to shave it for health reason or some kind of fade. I would much rather see that she is a woman instead of a little girl. It is funny that so many little girls want to have their period and hair so they can look like a woman then when they get it they want to get read of both. Sort of like the China and the US  with ice tea.|`|qVmIokXPaa	Look, just leave it alone.. You people that insist on doing all this trimming & shaving keep failing to recognize that nature knows what is best for you.. You have NO reason to believe that pubic hair is a bad quality on a girl. It's there because it's healthy to have ; ask any nurse. Further, in the future you'll indeed find that men prefer hair on your vulva. Hairy vulva = woman. Case closed.|`|za9b8cHKaa	Trim it. Any cuts caused by shaving can get infected very easily.

yUyx2nhmaa	i had exactly the same when i was younger - 4 teeth out and then braces! the worst was having teeth out. braces are fine, but maybe a annoying sometimes. they don't hurt to have them put on, or taken off. sometimes u feel some pressure when they get tightened but no big deal and well worth it for great teeth when u start dating LOL|`|t3G5xSbIaa	ya they'll hurt the 1st time and then u can't chew or anythin|`|yzKrwvxSaa	the putting the braces on part is painless if your molers are seperated. if their not, thats the only part that will hurt but it still doesn't hurt much. when they put the ring on your moler.<br>  it just feels like when your teeth are about to fall out. it doesn't hurt unless you put pressure on it but you will have to stick to soft foods<br>  after that, its pretty much painless except for when you get it tightened. it only hurts a bit and you can still eat pretty much anything you would normally eat|`|sjLUe4Kxaa	It dosen't hurt, it just feels kinda wierd.

qEIeJLtGaa	The 4 day split that works for ME:<br>  <br>  1)Upper Body/Pull Muscles: Back & Bi's (abs)<br>  <br>  2)Upper Body/Push Muscles: Chest, Delts, Tri's (abs)<br>  <br>  3)Lower Body (abs)<br>  <br>  4)Rest<br>  <br>  Sets: Do 4-5 sets for large muscle groups counting the warm up set, 3 sets for smaller muscle groups. Since the bi's and tri's are getting a big workout during compound movements, I only do ONE specific exercise for each of them because overdoing it will hinder development. I do 3 sets of curls/tricep dips/presses and that's it. You want to focus on these major exercises and do them at the beginning of your workouts on their particular days: Squats, lunges, bench presses (all kinds- don't forget dumbbell bench), shoulder presses, dead lifts, Pull ups, bent rows, and dips. Another tip: if you want to get big and strong, use freeweights whenever possible.

ZUX03uZZaa	I just did some quick research.  The majority say: "Little, if at all."<br>  <br>  The actual circumference may shrink slightly as the fatty tissue beneath them disappears, but it will be only a slight difference.  There are also hormones that are involved, and it's possible that the size may be reduced as you leave puberty behind.  Here's a quote:<br>  <br>  "If you're in pretty good shape (not too overweight), then i would say it's due purely to hormonal changes in your body. More than likely, the condition will regress and flatten. Although, as i said; in some cases surgery is required. Given the circumstances, it would be wise to consult your local General Practitioner - to get a professional perspective on the case.<br>  <br>  If, by any chance they do not go down when (if you still are, that is) you finish the main stages of puberty, then maybe considering surgery is the best option. If you do decide to go along with surgery, then don't worry, because it's not that big of a deal."|`|iQ6YJPmqaa	you can make it non burden for you with proper chest workouts &diet plans|`|Uxe1GjP0aa	Get to exercising.
kXq90b09aa	Im guessing you're a tall guy, which is the reason why you want to put on! <br>  You need lot of carbs and proteins, combine it with Fruits and veggies too. Also do high intense exercising (like interval training) to burn fat without losing muscles and to increase your appetite. <br>  <br>  Most of all you need to start weights to build muscle and stay healthy with lower percentage of fat. <br>  <br>  One more thing, calculate the amount of calories you need for a day, normal range is 2000-2500, eat more than that!<br>  <br>  good luck|`|yUoa678Gaa	Right, to gain weight, eat more. I know it sounds like rubbish but it is true. I am a classic hard gainer, but I added three extra meals to my day and decreased the amount food in each meal, it worked out smashingly. Sometimes you just have to change your eating routine to trick your body into gains. <br>  <br>  I also drank one or two Myoplex Mass meal replacements each day (on the days when I couldn't eat extra meals). I would only advise taking that if you work out though, because it can turn to fat very quickly.|`|qEIeJLtGaa	Eat. Eat a lot of quality food, not junk food. Eat lots of fruits and vegetables. Eat at least 1g of protein per pound of body weight, and eat a lot of carbs and fat. Peanut butter sandwiches are particularly good at adding weight not only because of their high calorie content, but peanut butter actually stimulates the production of testosterone which translates into more muscle for men. An exercise program of heavy weight lifting and avoiding cardio such as running should add muscle to your frame.|`|3g1ghEKBaa	The key for losing weight is simple - consume less food and exercise more often - the difficulties surface when we really try to put that into operation!

AA10246871	It's mainly a matter of semantics. Not all overdoses lead to death. It simply means that a person took a toxic level of a drug. For instance, opiates usually kill a person by slowing down their central nervous system so severely that they stop breathing. If a person has taken too much, be it morphine (legal) or heroin (illegal), and their breathing starts to slow, they can be treated and recover from the overdose.<br>  <br>  It's also called an overdose when someone takes too many pills and doesn't receive care which saves their lives. Let's assume we're talking about Vicodin, which is a narcotic. It kills the same way an opiate does--it slows everything down until you stop breathing. Someone takes 100 mg of Vicodin, they go to sleep, their breathing slows and eventually stops. End of story.<br>  <br>  So, an overdose doesn't necessarily result in death if there is intervention. But taking so many pills you die from it is also called an overdose. The difference is one was treated before the person died, and the other was not.<br>  <br>  I hope that makes sense.|`|7AUqSr4uaa	well.... you can overdose without dying, usually you would be saved by a stomach pump at the hospital.<br>  <br>  But obv you can die from an overdose. <br>  <br>  Overdoses can also happen when you take say, one more paracetamol a day than you should over an extended period of time, you end up with a cumulative effect whereby the effects of the overdose would become apparent over a much longer time|`|aMyLeIeIaa	The main difference is that in "death" by taking too many tablets.... Your dead. People don't always die from an overdose. People overdose on things all the time and are fine within hours or days after there body has recovered.

Nbo0Daowaa	in an emergency you can lose sleep without big problems. as soon as you can get some sleep, try to sleep for some extra time (10 hours) each day until you feel better. <br>  if it happens alot you can do damage. but 1 day isn't enough to do serious or irreversible damage. attention problems will be the first sign of trouble. it takes a couple days of no sleep or several months of lost hours of sleep to get into serious problems like immune system deficiencies, paranoia, hallucinations.|`|hlYZeY4vaa	You just feel sluggish the next day-- lazy, kind of out of it.

When you come down, your brain is depleted of serotonin and that's why you feel depressed and crappy. It then takes a while for it to build back up to normal levels, but if you're a recreational user, then often the levels will never return to normal.
LMoJl7hFaa	Get something natural.   If you want it for depression, take Omega 3 fish oil - its an essential fatty acid.   If you have a deficiency it can cause depression.<br>  <br>  No one ever had a deficiency of Cymbalta.
GXiCrhVYaa	Hi: Xanax is an anti-anxiety medication and is sometimes used as an aid for insomnia. Cymbalta is an antidepressant that can also help with social anxiety disorder and certain pain disorders. <br>  <br>  Yes, it is very possible to take these two meds together. I have major depression and have taken as much as 4 meds together. I have met people with bipolar disorder who have taken 6 meds together!<br>  <br>  Back to Xanax and Cymbalta: People often react to the same psychiatric meds very differently. So these two meds might be a good combo for you, but a bad combo for someone else. I suggest  monitoring how you are feeling. If you run into any problems, please call your doctor. If you have just started taking these meds, doctors generally start you off on a very small dosage and later increase it only if necessary.<br>  <br>  Cymbalta can make some people drowsy, but it gave me terrible insomnia. Welcome to the wacky world of psych meds.|`|LMoJl7hFaa	I'm not sure why anyone would even take one of them.

5rJ6nf2oaa	It can be either low blood sugar, not enough oxygen in the bathroom (if it is small with no windows and very steamy), or it can be a small petit mal seizure (not all people react to flashing lights or have convulsions with epilepsy). <br>  <br>  Personally I am leaning toward a small seizure because I have experienced very similar episodes myself over several years. I did not bother with treatment, and have actually noticed that with reductions in stress those seizures have disappeared now. They never harmed me. I did however have them checked out initially to make sure there was nothing physical causing them eg CT Scan, EEG etc.<br>  <br>  Don't worry, it doesn't sound too serious, it just feels weird when it happens to you and you don't know why.|`|AA12393369	I was exactly the same, I used to black out every week.<br>  My problem was that I had an alarmingly low Vitman D level (Sun) and Low Iron Levels.<br>  Since he was in the shower, the heat of the water can also have caused him light headed.<br>  Make sure your friend goes sees a docter for better consultation.|`|y38p0c6qaa	There are several different possibilities for why this is happening.  It could be as simple as low blood pressure or blood sugar, but it could also be something more serious like seizures or a heart condition.  He should see a doctor right away.  People can have seizures without actually going into convulsions.|`|vNM21JZnaa	Could be numerous things, but probably not epilepsy.  Fainting and seizures are two different symptoms resulting from completely different things.  Seizures resulting in complete loss of consciousness typically have rhythmic jerking (clonic-tonic), but not always. He would wake very fatigued, and with possibly major self inflicted injuries from the jerking motion while being unconscious.  If he faints, it could be a blood flow problem.  Possible heart problem, blood pressure problem with sudden movements (standing up quick), or stoke.  He should see a neurologist if possible to get a CT scan or MRI to look for any brain malformations, and possibly an Echocardiogram to rule out heart issues.  A duplex study of the arteries in his neck would look for any problems preventing adequate blood flow to the brain.  <br>  <br>  He could just me clumsy too?<br>  <br>  Take Care!|`|9F3GOelfaa	This happens to me atleast two-three times a week. The doctors said it was due to low iron and low blood pressure.

I think this is fairly common, to certain degrees. There's nothing wrong with it, in fact, I think it's a pretty good way to be, after all, it's never boring.<br>  So long as the logic part of your brain is present, I doubt you have anything to be concerned about.<br>  <br>  To me, it quite sounds like you have dissociative disorder in some form.

fZ3FXZMyaa	I know it hurts when someone you know tries to hurt themselves.  It is a very scary thing.  Usually after being in a "psych ward",(which I have found that you should say psychiatric unit),  depending on how long the stay and what the doctor has planned. In a psychiatric unit you have many people watching over you and they are watching and observing how you behave.  Examples:  If you gert out of bed, if you eat, if your a threat to yourself  or others.  If you "filp out" and yell and scream.  The doctor reads his chart from what the other staff has seen and he makes a dicision.  He will put your friend on medication and most likely put him in several rehabilitation programs.  He will not live alone.  They could send him to a "half-way" house, where he will get better and be around people that are trying to recover from things that happend to them.  And he will be watched and helped, it takes time before he will be ready to come back into sociatiy.   And yes family can help with cost, bringing clothes and visiting.|`|Ep7fwAtFaa	They if they are in their right mind will find him a place rather if its his family or a residential home.

syC3uQpjaa	To get six pack abs you need to do two things: Build muscle and lose fat. Details on ways to accomplish each of these goals follows:<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  Build Muscle<br>   <br>  Do Crunches. Lie on the floor (with or without a mat) and cross your arms in front of your chest. Bend your knees up as far as they go. (Do not place both hands behind your head. Placing both hands behind your head can cause lower back problems in the long run as it places unnecessary stress on that part of your body from pulling on your head and neck.) Another alternative is to cross your arms in front of your chest and lightly place your finger tips behind your ears, without pulling on your neck or ears to help raise you off the floor. Draw in your abdomen towards your spine while inhaling through your nose. Now raise your shoulders (upper torso) towards your knees, using strictly your abdominal muscles. It is very important not to lift your entire back off the floor, as this can cause back strain, and the extended movement does not help you develop six pack abs any faster. The most important part of the crunch is the initial flexing of your abs as you lift your shoulders off of the floor. As soon as you begin lifting off the floor exhale through your mouth, ending with a gasp once your shoulders are off the floor. Then pause for a second once you are at the top of the crunch and exhale the last bit of air from your diaphragm while flexing your abs. The proper breathing and flexing make all the difference. Now lower back down slowly and controlled while inhaling through your nose, just until your shoulder blades touch the ground. Do not let your head touch the ground and repeat. <br>   <br>  Do Sit Ups. Lie on the floor, feet on the floor, knees up and fingers placed behind your ears or hands crossed on your chest. Sit all the way up, lifting your lower back off the floor along with your shoulder blades.Lower yourself down. Repeat. Once this becomes relatively easy for you (i.e. you can do a quite a bit with ease) start adding more challenges. Find an incline bench or do these on an exercise ball. Once you "graduate" from that, do weighted sit ups. Hold a weight on your chest while you do these. As these become easier, hold heavier and heavier weights. You might also try lifting your feet off the ground while doing the sit ups or alternating the leg in the air, like pretending to pedal while sitting up. If your hands are behind your head, bring your left knee up to touch your right elbow and then your right knee to the left elbow. <br>   <br>  Do Leg Lifts. Lie on the floor, legs straight out, hands at your sides. Lift your legs straight up (not bending your knees at all) until they're at a 90 degree angle (or close). Lower your legs and repeat without letting your legs touch the floor. For more challenge there is equipment at most gyms that will allow you to raise yourself up using your arms as support and dangle your legs. You can perform leg lifts there too. If you're using this piece of equipment, you can make it easier by just raising your knees to your chest. It's more difficult to raise your legs to a horizontal position with your legs straight. This helps firm up the lower abdomen. If you're truly a monster, try doing leg lifts with a medicine ball hanging from your feet. Or hang from a pull up bar and raise your legs in front of you all the way up to the bar. <br>   <br>  Do Jackknife Sit Ups. Lie down flat on the floor. Place your hands on the ground to your sides for balance; you can pick them up as you get used to the movement. Simultaneously raise your knees and torso so that your knees and face meet on an imaginary line extending from your pelvis to the ceiling. You should be able to kiss your knees at the top of the motion. Your legs will naturally fold bringing your feet towards your hips, much like a jackknife. Lie back down (i.e. "spread out") and repeat. Place a weight between your feet when you think you can handle it. <br>  Do V-ups. Lie on the floor, legs straight out, hands on the floor but this time extended out over your head. Simultaneously raise legs and torso. Don't bend your knees! What kind of V would it be if you bend your knees? Reach with your hands toward the raised feet. Touch your feet if possible (will require some flexibility). Relax, return to starting position and repeat. Add weight between feet to match your taste. <br>   <br>  Static Hold and Side Statics. Put your body into the push-up position but with your elbows on the floor, and your whole body flat. This position is known as the static hold position and it trains your core (including your abs) to hold the body in place which is the real purpose of your abs. Hold this position for as long as possible, but you should be aiming to start off with at least 45 seconds, while seasoned ab workers known to achieve over 20 minute static holds. To perform the side static hold roll onto one side of your body and lift into the same position as before, but this time only one arm will be on the ground|`|UZJ7wVc8aa	Getting a nice set of abs is such a misunderstood process. It's actually a lot easier than most people think which is why most people are in a never ending quest to get that perfect six pack - it's because they're doing all the wrong things.<br>  <br>  When you eat more calories than you burn, your body takes those extra calories and stores them as fat somewhere on your body. For some people, the #1 fat storage area is around the thighs and for others it might be around the stomach - it differs from person to person. Sometimes the fat is perfectly distributed around the body so it's not as big of a concern. <br>  <br>  If an excessive amount of fat is stored around your stomach, the reason that you're not seeing your abs is because your body fat percentage is too high. What you need to do is create a calorie deficit (take in less calories than you burn) so that your body is forced to use its fat stores for energy. After a few weeks of doing this, you'll notice that your abs will start to show.<br>  <br>  You first step is to figure out how many calories you burn each day. Use this calculator <a href="http://calorieneedscalculator.com" rel="nofollow">http://calorieneedscalculator.com</a> for an estimate. Now you need to increase the amount of calories you burn by exercising more and decreasing the amount of calories you eat. Cut out junk food such as fast food, candy and sugar. Eat foods that are high in fiber: bread and pasta made from 100% whole wheat, brown rice, oats, fruits and vegetables.<br>  <br>  You shouldn't ignore targeting your abs with sit ups, leg raises and twists but doing hundreds of sit ups won't do anything about the layer of fat that is covering them. Cardio and calorie restriction should be your main focus.

Let me put it this way: you could be carrying around the most impressive 6 pack in the world, a six pack that would make chicks slips and fall down on their own juices, but unless you lose the weight that is covering it up, no one is ever going to see it, got it? good -john in rock island, illinois, QUAD CITIES, USA|`|CC6dSdJmaa	You need to lie down with your feet under a bed or sofa and do sit ups, as many as you can manage each day, also avoid fatty foods.<br>  It will take a few weeks to show but you will get there!|`|tE7lqUfoaa	how many people do you think ever in there lifetime use the<br>  "Search for questions:"<br>  it's actually a really good thing to use i just don't think people have common sense|`|b6RqNpV9aa	um, wel i just hav to add first that im 12 and a girl and im taller then u....but besides that i hav a six pac and u should swim! and do crunches......i suggest that when ur relaxig and watching t.v. do as many crunches as you can without stopping while the commercials r on. that helps me alot.|`|3gPLONagaa	Go to a Gym and ask a serious trainer.

So acccording to that as long as you eat right you can lose as much as you want to as long as you exercise.  so it would take 100 1 mile runs x 350 kcalories = 35000 kcalories to lose 10 pounds of body fat.

DtG4zpM2aa	Chlamydia alone can be tested for just by checking a urine sample, but if you're wanting to rule out the possibility of any other STIs, they will need to take swabs.   It's a similar procedure to getting a smear test, a bit uncomfortable but doesn't take long and it would be best to get this to rule out the possibility of any other infections, to reduce the possibility of any further problems for yourself, your boyfriend and any future partners.   But obviously nobody can force you to have a test if you are not willing to have it.  <br>  <br>  Aside from taking swabs and checking a urine sample, the doctor or nurse who sees you will want to take some details from you about your current sexual partner and partners in the past, ie what forms of sex you had, if you used protection or not, etc.   Also they will probably ask about blood testing for HIV and hepatitis - if you would like this just to get everything checked, further counselling is given prior to the test.<br>  <br>  Hope it goes ok.|`|SHanivxvaa	Yes they must take some swabs from your cervix if you want to check for chlamydia its not painful it feels a little weird and uncomfortable but you will be fine|`|CpevWaQ7aa	Yes they have to take swabs.

It hurts very badly and waiting for the swelling to go down or icing it for a long time may not be an appropriate solution. This morning, a ring got stuck on my finger and we tried everything to get it off, but it was just getting worse. I was at work and was in immense pain. A coworker found out that there is a "rescue station" at the local fire department that has special tools for cutting off a ring. He drove me there and in 20 seconds the ring was off. They were happy to help me and just concerned because my finger was purple and hot. If the ring that is stuck can be repaired then I suggest getting it cut at the fire department.<br>  jagkiter said Flag This Comment<br>  on 7/1/2008 Most definitely use windex, it works like a miracle!

I knew it was time to take my rings off. This is the ONLY thing that worked for me: 1. Take a long piece of floss...maybe about 2-3 feet worth. 2. Thread one end through the ring going towards your palm. Leave a few inches on this end. 3. Now with the other end, wrap the floss around your finger, starting at the ring. Be sure to wrap tightly and evenly spaced. I would wrap the floss very close together. 4. Once you get to the top of the knuckle, you can probably stop. Hold that end tight. 5. Lube up your finger. I tried it without lube and it hurt very bad. 6. Grab a hold of the short end of floss and start winding it upwards. 7. Keep winding even if you think it's not working. 8. This should pop the ring right off! Yes, it will be uncomfortable, but it's worth it to go through a few minutes of pain!<br>  fireball67217 said Flag This Comment<br>  on 12/25/2007 TRIED EVERY THING BUT NOTHING WOULD WORK HAD TO CUT OFF WITH TINSNIPS<br>  pokegod11 said Flag This Comment<br>  on 12/9/2007 Windex is the almighty for getting a stuck ring off if it is a class ring or an engagement ring just put some windex down your finger and twist the ring down the finger till it's off and it will be off in the matter of a minute if you keep twisting it even if there is pain keep twisting.<br>  jtc4989 said Flag This Comment<br>  on 11/25/2007 There is time when all this just does not work. I have been in this situation, to the point of where my finger has become infected underneath the rung because it was tight and stuck and moving it around, wiggling it to get it off just made it worse and it cut into my flesh. The way i got it off was a long tiresome fight but when nothing else works its the only thing that will eventually work. Take a set of crimping pliers, the ones with the thick jaws, squeeze the side of your ring until is flat no longer round. Take a set of heavy duty cutting pliers and work on cutting it. Mine was gold, took an hour of tireless work to cut through it, its the only way i could possible get it off, tried everything else, was this way or off with the finger.<br>  steffined081 said Flag This Comment<br>  on 11/6/2007 I just have to say WOW for WINDEX!!!!

My finger was swelling and starting to hurt very badly. Icing my hand for 15 minutes while elevating it above my head helped the swelling to reduce. I was a little skeptical of the Windex, but tried it. After twisting and spraying, the ring came off in about 10 seconds! I was shocked! The Windex truly works. Thank you to those who suggested it.

Sometimes if you have too much salt in your diet it can cause your fingers to swell . I realize thats not immediately helpful but it can be used as worst case scenario. Hope it comes off :]|`|0FCoK8Kraa	You should get a bowl of ice cold water and stick your hand in it. When the skin is cold your finger size shrinks so you should be able to slip it off of your hand.

wXalOb0Waa	It is possible to lose weight fast but you should be realistic and understand that if you lose weight fast then you will probably put it all back on again just as fast. The one diet that really worked for me is wu-yi tea, it can be viewed in the resource box underneath, they have a small number of free trials in stock, it was featured in Fox News and CNN. I lost 30 pounds, it really does produce success!|`|XZqSO94saa	You can't fast if you're looking to firmen you're but.<br>  You're going to need to increase you're protein intake by about 30g more.<br>  <br>  - Hip up's<br>  Lig on the floor with feet on the group in a 90 degree angle like a crunch.

6da5a77fa2ae9ecdc85aad0e7e8f2db3aa	Many things can happen but it may depend on you and how you define bread in moderation, as some people do not tolerate it at all whilst others can tolerate a little.<br>  <br>  Ultimately if done right, you will switch your body over to a fat burning metabolism rather then a glucose one. This in turn will help you keep your insulin levels down which in turn helps to reduce cardiovascular risk as well as risks associated with metabolic syndrome such as diabetes. Low carb is thought to help with some cancers which depend on insulin. <br>  <br>  Low carb can also have a positive effect on hormones, helping women to improve their cycles to the point of even allowing some PCOS women to fall pregnant.<br>  <br>  On a lifestyle point of view you will find you're less hungry and your energy should be on a more even keel, none of these ups and downs that swinging blood sugars brings. You may also experience improvements in digestion, particularly if you omit bread.<br>  <br>  If you're already a type 2 diabetic then low carb should reduce and may even eliminate your diabetes medications which is a very good thing. Particularly, with some recent research suggesting that aggressive drug treatment to bring blood sugars down and reduce cardiovascular risk increases risk of death. One of these studies they had to stop it early because of this!<br>  <br>  Remember though, if you eat low carb do not avoid fat.<br>  <br>  Here's a page I put together that collects research on the various benefits of low carbohydrate diets:|`|DGY33SSkaa	Hi Jim,<br>  <br>  There are several things that will probably happen.  First, you will probably lose some weight.  Second, over the long run you will probably greatly reduce the chances of developing type 2 diabetes.  There are others, but these are probably the two greatest potential positive benefits.  I'm a type 2 diabetic myself and wish a doctor or nutritionist had been able to tell me about these potential benefits before it was too late.<br>  <br>  Hope this helps!
LuNWeewLaa	If the lump feels hard, my guess is that you probably have a dorsal ganglion cyst. You can usually go to any orthapedic hand specialist and they'll either drain it or remove it. Hope this helps :]<br>  <br>  *well I double checked with my dad who's a doctor cause I didn't want to give you faulty advice based off my own cyst, but he said that it shouldn't hurt anything if you continue to box but you have to be careful because if trauma occurs to the area there's a chance it might make it bigger. So just keep an eye out for it. As far as the pain, I think its pretty normal because I usually get it from bending/moving my hand really fast for a long period of time, but my lump hasnt gotten bigger.
XN0sRoqpaa	whoa thats really weird. it means that your hand has died.<br>  <br>  literally, the blood circulation had not been revolving throught he veins and thus, caused the veins to decay. its very sensitive, but give it some more time, and it will go back to normal.<br>  <br>  how ever, if you cant move it or the fingers, then you should go to a hospital|`|1L7goFOEaa	hahaha i know what is rong with u. you held your hand up in the same position for 6 hours and it lost its circulation because your hand was above you head right. haha you could lose your hand just to tell you i would go to the hospital and you never know you may never be able to hold on to a bus for 6 hours ever again. nah jk good luck you did lose circulation in you hand though. hospital!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!|`|6TSwoU3yaa	Dont catch the bus.  Walk instead.<br>  It is lack of movement that is causing your pins and needles.  You need to be mobile.|`|CC6dSdJmaa	See your doctor, it could be Carpal Tunnel Syndrome which is reasonably easy to treat with drugs or minor surgery!|`|3gPLONagaa	visit a doctor|`|E64juLwJaa	Caused by the pressure on your nerve endings:sit in warm water with your hand:then it will get better.<br>  If not?<br>  See your Dr<br>  Planets.|`|cr2KKT6Naa	sounds like your on the computer way too long .  you need surgurey. you have carpatunnel.
GXiCrhVYaa	Jogging an hour a day is quite an accomplishment. Perhaps you have a slow metabolism or an underactive thyroid. There are other medical possiblities, so you might want a general checkup with your doctor. <br>  <br>  I found with my own weight loss that my weight might remain steady for weeks, but then I would lose a bunch of pounds all at once. Then I would hit another plateau, and then lose weight all at once. I don't understand why.<br>  <br>  Please avoid the acai berry craze for weight loss, no matter how many ads you see. To make a long story short, avoid any acai free trials (they are scams).<br>  <br>  I CANNOT offer you any guarantees, but what helped me lose about 20 pounds in 3 months is an old, very inexpensive natural remedy that might sound very strange to you. Put 1 teaspoon of apple cider vinegar (ACV) and 1 tablespoon of honey in 8 ounces of warm water and drink this mixture. Do this two (or possibly three) times a day. It may take a while to get used to the taste. If you really don‘t like the taste, add extra honey. <br>  <br>  Use Bragg's ACV or other brands from a health food store, not stuff you buy in a regular grocery store. Also avoid the ACV capsules sold in grocery stories and drug stores. They are a waste of money. As I said, the ACV did work for me. For the 3 to 4 weeks, I don't think I lost an ounce, but maybe my metabolism was speeding up. In the second and third month, the weight started to come off. <br>  <br>  ACV has been used for hundreds of years for a variety of health issues, so this is not the latest fad diet. If you want more info, google “apple cider vinegar health benefits.”|`|3ctL64O4aa	you Are Currently Have A Healthy BMi of 22.<br>  <br>  Just Keep Up What You Are Doing.

Sh7r0kNuaa	"Focalin is a brand name for dexmethylphenidate. Dexmethylphenidate is an isomer of Methylphenidate (also known as Ritalin). Dexmethylphenidate and Methylphenidate should have effects nearly identical to each other, though Dexmethylphenidate is about twice as potent as Methylphenidate (requires lower doses). This is supported by the fact that Focalin/Dexmethylphenidate is available in 2.5, 5, and 10 mg tablets while Ritalin/Methylphenidate is available in 5, 10 and 20 mg tablets.

AA11102015	Give your 3 yr old the recommended dose of Tylenol, 4 hours later, ibuprofen, Alternate between Tylenol and ibuprofen every 4 hours until the fever breaks.<br>  <br>  Axillary temps are inaccurate. If the temp's 103.5 in the armpit, the kid is MEGA-burning up. If the kid's not taking in enough fluid, she'll need IV fluids to prevent dehydration in addition to the fever control. If you have a rectal thermometer, take her temp that way- it's the most accurate. DON'T use an oral thermometer to take a rectal temp. 1) they're calibrated differently and the temp would be wrong, and 2) you don't want to expose anyone to other bugs that may be in the stool.<br>  <br>  Call your doctor, but I would advise getting her checked out in the ER ASAP.|`|NFyQWFoGaa	That is not healthy, definitely see a doctor.|`|wMeQoXkzaa	You need to get that child to a doctor!

Scratching herself is a form of self harm - this doesn't mean she will defiantly start cutting herself however. i would say she needs help now before it gets worse - it's whether she wants any help though..<br>  Self harm can be done in lots of ways - it's coping mechanism so don't try and make her stop, it's something she needs to do. try talking to her and listening to her upset if you can. Counselling?|`|BS9pRP97aa	i dont think scratching yourself is the first stage into cutting yourself. maybe your friend is doing it in public cuz she wants someone to know & help her to stop cutting herself.|`|c3h3qgNpaa	i started with hitting, den jabbin myself, stratching, slicing, cutting<br>  and now i'm stopping|`|4WlkDzLeaa	It depends on WHY she is scratching herself.<br>  <br>  If she is doing it to causde yourself harm, them yes, maybe it is the first stage of self harm. But if she are merely doing it as a bad habit or because she is itchy, then no.<br>  <br>  I have known people who cut themselves and they did it lightly, with a knife or so, so it looked like some small red cuts, but never just scratching with her nails (if that's what you meant). <br>  <br>  Another friend used a blade and had "scratches" up and down her arm when they healed, so maybe you need to talk to her about it and see if she is upset or in a stage of depression?<br>  <br>  Good luck!

CT8pwhM5aa	Before coming to conclusions based on your fingernails, consider the health events you have recently experienced. You probably took some serious medication before moving, antimalaria drugs perhaps? Your fingernails provide a record of health events but you know that you were really sick recently, so that's probably the cause. A dark red/brown band across the top of the fingernail is correlated with kidney failure, internal illness or nutritional deficit.<br>  <br>  I had pneumonia a couple of years ago and found it fascinating that it caused deep valleys at the bottom of my nails.
RHcrI2Acaa	I have not read the "UTI Remedy Report" and from what I found on the internet I would be a bit skeptical.  The reviews that your are referring to appear to be advertisements for the "Report".<br>  <br>  You probably already know about drinking Cranberry juice.  I would also recommend blueberry juice.  I also read that you can take potassium citrate or sodium citrate (the sour stuff that is often used as a laxative).<br>  <br>  I would caution you to take care.  UTI's in older adults can cause symptoms similar to dementia.  My mother who is in her 70's had a bad case of repeated UTI's that caused her to hallucinate.<br>  <br>  Homeopathic treatments have their place in medicine but cannot but completely trusted to work instead of medicine.  I think the best thing is for you to see your doctor to make sure there isn't an underlying cause for the chronic nature of your problem.|`|tbFI2XJeaa	Purchase some supplements from your local drug store, such as cranberry and garlic tablets to help fight the UTI. Cranberry makes the walls of the bladder slick so that bacteria has a harder time sticking to it. Garlic has natural antibacterial qualities.

28RK2hKBaa	I think with Doctors it's a guessing game for them. It can be irritating. <br>  You can have both or either. I have been told some Doctors that I am bipolar and not borderline and by others that I am borderline and not Bipolar. I am on meds for bipolar either way an being treated with therapy for borderline. The 2 doctors disagree on a diagnosis. There still isn't a defined diagnosis but I have been told that the 2 overlap so many times that it can be a long time for them to be sure. I feel like giving up so many times but..we'll see.<br>  You can try a second opinion but it might not be what you want to hear. Or they might just say "not sure".."maybe" <br>  What you have described does not rule out bipolar because there are also cases of bipolar with rapid cycling that mimics borderline too btw..<br>  Not sure if I helped you at all but good luck.<br>  <br>  I added my myspace page and a link to an article about rapid cycling bipolar and bordelrine.|`|Ep7fwAtFaa	No one but the doctor can diagnose you I am sorry, but it does sound like borderline to me but it also sounds a little like bipolar but listen to your doctor.|`|sy4HR96eaa	are you trying to get discharged from the military?
OtND4Yicaa	Hello,<br>       How are you doing?  I have never tried air alert, but I have heard that there are much better programs that you can do to raise your vertical.  I would suggest getting the vertical jump bible.  Then, I would suggest listening to this guy on youtube called freejumptraining.  I've posted a link for you.<br>      I do not know why your achilles heel is getting thinner.  It could simply be that you are losing fat with the amount of exercise you are doing.  It could be that you are doing exercises that are toning your muscle instead of increase size.  (Basically, endurance versus strength.)  It could be something serious and you may need to see a doctor.<br>       Anyways, if you are looking for exercises to strengthen your achilles heel, you can do weighted standing, and weighted seated calf raises.  Make sure you include both in your workout because they work slightly different parts of your calf and achilles.<br>      Goodluck!
Z8xyY0g8aa	1. Either you are eating something that's high in fat like chocolate or something or maybe you are using something that's bad for your skin<br>  <br>  2. You do seem abit stressed and as you say- you suck up your pain, so that adds to your inner stress and that might also be a reason for the spots- It's your determination and irritation also that might contribute to this<br>  <br>  3. The tears just might be you crying without realizing it or your brain just feels the need to tear, my eyes sometimes tear for no reason but its okay as i know myself that i aint crying lol<br>  <br>  4. Try tummy crunches. Or if you are always on the move and don't have time, whilst you are walking- suck you tummy all the way in for 10seconds a couple of times, or suck your tummy in and out 20 times whilst on the phone or waiting to do something. Also try trampolining which is really good at working the tummy<br>  <br>  5. No matter who says it and how you feel about yourself- You and No one is ugly <br>  <br>  Hope you are alright and Good Luck with everything =D<br>  Xx

jnuBYMAiaa	This is something you and your mother should discuss when both you and she has nothing to do and will not be interrupted. If she's curious as to why, explain your future plans of becoming a Gynecologist and this in-person action would help. Explain also that she's the closest female to you that you'd trust with something like this. It's not really odd, for there are children that are in the room with their parents when they're baby brother/sister is born. Just talk to her and respect whatever decision she makes As for the birthing videos, ask her about this. If she says yes to you witnessing the birth, I'm sure she won't mind the viewing of your birth video. As long as your motives are pure and your interest is in this medical field it's fine. There's nothing wrong with being a male who wants to deliver babies or study the female body earnestly and not out of hormones, for I wish to be Urologist and I'm a female. I think I'll be really good at it. Hope this helps.
CJmSbIuHaa	its more than likely just an epicanthal fold, my brother has the same thing.<br>  <br>  the only way to change it is plastic surgery (which i don't recomend)<br>  <br>  your eyes are probably awesome.<br>  <br>  i always thought it looked cool.|`|TsjqzanQaa	From your description, your eyes aren't exactly horrifying.<br>  <br>  I find the slightly exotic look of the oriental eyes appealing, for the most part.<br>  <br>  Look at the famous golfer, Tiger Woods.

That is due to the Japanese part of his ancestry.<br>  <br>  Most of us find things that we don't like about our appearance, and we tend to see them as being much worse than others do.<br>  <br>  However, if it bothers you so much, you can indeed get some minor plastic surgery to shape your eyes so that you're more comfortable with them.<br>  <br>  It's expensive, so you should start saving money for this.<br>  <br>  Also, a good part of the way that your eyes look is because of facial expession.     You might want to try looking in the mirror and experimenting with what facial expressions make your eyes look better, and practice these expressions, if you find that you feel you look better.<br>  <br>  Good luck to you.|`|K5SGG1QYaa	i think its a bit offensive and extreme to describe asian shaped eyes as 'horrifying'|`|Nq4FWEIcaa	I can't really give a decisive answer.

7be554591e8c040c7b5bfa762a5a2560aa	In the future....put ice water on a burn as fast as you can...this will lower  the temperature and possibly prevent the burn from being worse than it would have been.  But for now...if you can keep air from reaching it....it will not hurt so much.  So...I would say put a clean plastic  bag over your foot...cover the burned area w/vaseline...or any ointment you may have then the bag.  Tape it around your ankle so no air can reach the burned part.  It will relieve the pain immensely. Seems it is exposure to air that causes it to hurt.|`|ec76af399c519dad926a10430304f541aa	no, use ice or ice water for the first 24 hours after a burn.|`|ded7fc19860a81607ee52a6560480ab2aa	i say cold water it makes the pain go away but will only help for a while.|`|PaZcLiKKaa	If the skin is off you need medical attention .

I'd love to just talk to you and here whatever it is you know and have to say.  As far as these affinities towards clean living, it's something of a catch 22.  We, as a modern people, have a very sedentary lifestyle.  Our technology overcomes our lives in many ways that these new generations take very much for granted.  Who needs to rifle through hundreds of books in a library when google.com can find the closest thing to an exact sentence that you're searching in close to 100, 000 texts in a matter of seconds?  We've become "too babied" in a sense.  Look at the people who think spanking their kids is a crime?  I'm no advocate of abuse, but sometimes a kid needs a trip through a wall to re-focus.  In defense of this "evolution" to a more tidy society, our knowledge of the possible diseases as well as ones that are discovered and classified often, has made us more aware and, thus, more cautious of our surroundings and our want to protect our loved ones from the things that can hurt them.  A raw tomato in a salad is delicious, but once i know that my son could possibly get salmonella and die, I may be skeptical but I'm still going to be hesitant about giving it to him.  Am i making any sense?

vPI1hVGUaa	It is called Photic sneeze reflex or ACHOO (autosomal dominant compelling helio-opthalmic outburst) and it occurs in 17% to 25% of humans, with more common occurrences in Caucasians than other human races. <br>  Photic sneeze reflex is a gene mutation that results in an error in the trigeminal nerve, a nerve that leads sensory information from the face into the brain. As the name indicates, three nerves meet in the trigeminal nerve, the ophthalmic nerve, the upper maxillary nerve and the mandibular nerve. The error means that a powerful stimulation of the ophthalmic nerve, which is stimulated by sudden change of light, also results in a stimulation of the upper maxillary nerve, which is other stimulated by irritation and blockage of the nose.<br>  <br>  Sunglasses can help out, but it's probably a good idea to stay out of that fighter jet.

tmGRe2Jraa	They actually make products that are supposed to numb him to help him last longer (Mandelay gel or something Proloonging makes called "penis desensitizing aid delay spray", along with "Extended Pleasure" condoms and the like), although I'm not sure how effective they are.  If you're going to try something like that, please, for heaven's sake, buy a product intended for the purpose.  Don't just buy any old numbing cream and start slapping it onto his penis, there's no knowing what you'll do to his nerves.  <br>  <br>  You can also try switching positions to something you like more and he likes less (you on top might work), having him slow down a bit and take breaks when he feels like he's about to come, or demanding a ton of foreplay before you progress to actual sex.  Also, round two tends to last a lot longer than round one, provided he can get it back up again.  And depending on how old you are, there's an age-old time-tested method that's worked for hundreds of women over hundreds of years: Get him a bit drunk.<br>  <br>  If none of that works at all, try to look at all the positives:  You'll never wind up having to go down on him for half an hour at a time, and, after four years, he's still so turned on by you that he can't control himself.  These positives, unfortunately, seem pretty meagre compared to your boyfriend using you like a masturbatory tool for four years.<br>  <br>  Seriously, good luck.|`|CkdSTD1Baa	ugh I feel you're pain. It helps if you change positions frequently. When he starts to get close, stop, and change positions. Or just stop, and have him pay attention to you for a few mintues until he is a little less excited. (and you are even more so)<br>  <br>  You can get condoms that cause a numbing sensation in the penis which can help, because he wont get as much stimulation. However, it can be too strong for some men and can even make them lose their erection!|`|RGAdEvaOaa	My gf always pours hot wax and melted butter over my body. and then she pees and craps on my chest. i know it sounds wierd but trust me it works.|`|LSlMRXrtaa	hey Rebbecca if he is only lasting 2 minutes then u should be on top if he wants to stop just give him head|`|Gw1LLzDgaa	How incredibly sad and shallow of you.<br>  <br>  Regards,<br>  <br>  Hermes|`|40zewEkMaa	Why don't you try different positions or maybe buy a game to make it more exciting.|`|H7oH331taa	Get him to ejaculate earlier in the day so when it comes to having sex he'll be able to last longer.

TKf6z1vHaa	I understand your situation. That is normal to feel protective of them especially since they are the family you have left; which is why you need to preserve that relationship and nurture it as much as possible. I think it's great that you are trying to be a role model for your nephew. So what you can do is explain to him the situation of what happened in the room and why you lost your cool. Tell him how much you love him, and that he doesn't need to be scared of you. <br>  Also, I would recommend some counseling. Losing a family member is very tough and maybe therapy will help you control your anger so that your family can see what a great person you are. <br>  Good luck.|`|f00589104255977086e57a356d925224aa	Maybe you would have like someone to do that for you when you was young?  so as you are older you feel it is your duty to protect the one's more venerable than yourself. I think it is a good thing to stand up for them, but sometimes it can make things worse. Make sure you don't react for the sake of it. It could cause a lot more problems for example when you are not around and the others start on the kid they will repay him for what you done. So it is a tricky one. <br>  <br>  Be cautious. Get your information right before you act.
4V2Odsygaa	It may be thyroid related,or spasms of some sort either way you'll most likely have to see a doctor.
T8G6CSEwaa	As a girl who's experienced both, I DEFINITELY prefer circumcised!  No matter how clean an uncirc guy is, his penis will still have a slight unpleasant smell, whereas a circ guy's doesn't.  Also, uncircs have a greater chance of catching disease and transmitting it because bacteria loves to live in the foreskin, which is why the WHO suggested circumcision to fight the AIDS epidemic in Africa.  <br>  <br>  Also, circumcised men last longer, so the sex with them is so much better!|`|TsjqzanQaa	I'm glad that you like your foreskin, it's what makes your penis 100% complete and gives you 100% of sexual sensitivity.<br>  <br>  Circumcision was used about 100 years ago to try to stop boys from masturbating, as it does make all sexual activity less enjoyable, because of the damage to the penis and the diminished sexual sensitivity.<br>  <br>  It didn't stop boys from masturbating, as it still feels good, but it senselessly deprives males of the complete enjoyment of sex.<br>  <br>  There are no benefits to circumcision, except to the doctors who make money from it and who are very frequently members of the religions that try to impose the mutilation of circumcision on all males.<br>  <br>  I was a victim.     As a helpless infant, I was strapped down, assaulted, sexually molested, and mutilated by the process called circumcision.<br>  <br>  This resulted in more than the usual loss (50-75%) of sexual sensitivity in my case.     I was unable to achieve orgasm in normal sex because of the damage inflicted on me.<br>  <br>  I didn't know what was wrong with me for years, until I found out about foreskin restoration.<br>  <br>  While restoration doesn't replace the amputated nerve endings in the foreskin, nor does it repair the damaged ones on the penis, it does dekeratinize the tisses which were meant to be covered by the foreskin naturally.<br>  <br>  It's my theory that the dekeratinized tissues compensate for the lacking nerve endings and severed nerves, which is why I have such vastly improved sensitivity and function.     Orgasms are also dramatically increased in intensity.<br>  <br>  The circumcised male is also more prone to HIV and other infections.    A fairly recent discovery is that the foreskin has Langerhans cells, which have antiviral and antibacterial properties.      The fact that HIV transmission rates are much higher in the US than in the countries in Europe, South America, Scandinavia and Asia bear this out.        Pakistan, where almost all males are circumcised, has an HIV rate 400% more than that of India, where the vast majority of men are unmutilated.<br>  <br>  The old wive's tales and outright lies about the so-called benefits of circumcision have been disproven, yet some people still hold on to these superstitions.<br>  <br>  Circumcision is the worst hoax ever perpetrated on the male sex.<br>  <br>  A foreskin is not a birth defect; it is a birthright.<br>  <br>  ERIC|`|K4zsztkRaa	I love uncircumcised =]<br>  the way a man was born is so much better.<br>  <br>  <br>  you can't jack off without lube lol <br>  <br>  Yeah and sex is A LOT better when you are uncircumcised.<br>  I was circumcised and I am restoring my foreskin (non-surgecly) and sex has gotten A LOT better.

And I can tell you that it is MUCH better with foreskin than without. I used to always need lube of some kind, now i need nothing, and it feels great.<br>  <br>  Once I started restoring and had enough coverage for a while, I realized that the head of my penis got tremendously more sensitive.  Until the skin was trained to stay forward over the head, once in a while it would peak out and rub against my underwear.  I was amazed just how painful it was to have the head rub against fabric.<br>  <br>  Guys that are circumcised aways comment on how much cleaner they are, for me, with the very little extra washing I might need, is NOTHING compared to the additional pleasure I now have.|`|i6RlYFo7aa	you're one of the 85% of the men who have foreskin? yeah, cool<br>  <br>  circumcised and intact are pretty much the same thing<br>  <br>  but i think circumcision is cruel, besides there are no benefits to circumcision, it is completely unnecessary, all it does is scar the penis and dry it out|`|7mCCAqXzaa	Uncircumcised is the way to be no lube nessesary for wackin my partners have never complained about sex with me seems to fit and work like any other unit they have had only one chick didnt go for it so i dumped her. <br>  <br>  curtdude <br>  uncirced dude|`|AA11693808	Ambivalent. Having been uncircumcised and circumcised later I can say that sex honestly feels the same. I last longer now, but it also doesn't feel as intense until much late.r|`|QBUypAmAaa	I was circumcised without my consent and I HATE it. I'm restoring my foreskin to correct that as best I can and can vouch that having a foreskin increases pleasure at least tenfold if not more. I can feel so much more with the skin gliding and covering my glans, it's awesome. I'm glad you appreciate your foreskin. Often it seems that "The intact male knows not what he has, while the circumcised male knows not what he's missing." At least this isn't true in your case and a lot of intact and circumcised guys on here too.<br>  <br>  Most circumcised guys have to use lube, because they were cut tight and can't glide their skin up and down the shaft easily. I was lucky to have been given a loose cut and could do it before starting to restore, so I've never had to masturbate with lube, skin feels better anyway.<br>  <br>  -KH|`|EwmHsEoiaa	Those that are circumcised are in the minority.  they do not realise the function of the foreskin.<br>  <br>  The damage done:<br>  <a href="http://www.noharmm.org/IDcirc.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.noharmm.org/IDcirc.htm</a><br>  <br>  The function of the foreskin:<br>  <a href="http://geocities.com/painfulquestioning/naturalresources" rel="nofollow">http://geocities.com/painfulquestioning/...</a><br>  <br>  Why sex with an intact man is better ( I hate the word uncircumcised - it makes it sound like we are the ones that are abnormal):<br>  <a href="http://www.sexasnatureintendedit.com/10F/1hook_scrapes.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.sexasnatureintendedit.com/10F...</a><br>  <br>  Also don't forget about all the men who have been mutilated for life through the circumcision, some have lost their penis , some have actually died:<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.circumstitions.com/Complic.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.circumstitions.com/Complic.ht...</a>|`|AA11587429	Ethically I'm against circumcision, and think it probably shouldn't be done. But for whatever weird reason, I like being circumcised.  It's not true that you need to use lube if you don't have a foreskin.  In fact, I like it better dry.  Although no skin covers the head, the skin is still loose enough to move up and down, and even up an over the edge of the head.|`|bEOHVM1Faa	Um. Theres not much of a difference. If you are uncircumcised you are more sensitive, so yah sex would feel better. About the masturbation thing  I think using a lube is a preference for guys. Some guys use lube, some don't. Circumcision is a religious thing, it's not a big deal. :)|`|sW4nZ2z9aa	I think sex with an uncircumcised man feels better, there's more motion in the ocean, and alot easier for me to have an orgasm with, With a circumcised man it feels like after a while they are soaking up all of my lubrication and I get dry faster.|`|DcEBhY02aa	UNCIRCUMCISED! circumcision is not needed...

2OQuDVYvaa	First off lets not confuse a disposable on time enema with a real enema as they are only clearing the rectum.  A large volume enema would involve a person taking 1-2 quarts or more (some have boasted about doing 4 qts or more but they are exceptions).  Larger volume means the water is reaching further into the colon,  Once you have taken the entire bag you would retain it for a period of time and then get up and evacuate on the toilet. For most people this is the finish of an enema.<br>  <br>  For those wanting a more thorough clean-out they may repeat this 2 to 4 times.  So if you had taken 4 2 quart enemas you have processed 8 quarts of solution.  Some may be retained and later passed in urine as your body may absorb some of the water.<br>  <br>  With a colonic, it must be administered by a trained professional in their facility.  The therapist would insert a disposable speculum in your anus and begin filling your system.  At some point they would stop the flow in and then another clear tube allows the water to come back out.  There is no odor and the therapist looks at the tubing to determine how well the colonic is clearing your colon.  They repeat this process and each time the water would reach further into your colon and then drain.  By the time you were finished they could have processed about 5 gallons of solution through your colon and the returns would be clear.  <br>  <br>  An enema bag can be purchased starting at $5 and they are reusable (rinse thoroughly after use and do not share) whereas a colonic session costs start around $65 per session and some exceed $100 per session.  Some colonic therapists offer packages of multiple sessions for a discount.|`|bTfR8OnDaa	A colonic wil remove bulit up stool pockets deep within the colon. The doctor will insert a tube into your rectum and run water through it to loosen the stool. It is quite uncomfortable. An enema will clear out what is in the lower part of your bowels.

FT2dOlZEaa	The ‘average’ length of an erect adult penis is about 5.5" - 6".<br>  <br>  It’s worth remembering that the average adult penis is 'designed' to fit the average depth of the adult vagina which is also about 6". <br>  <br>  There is no normal or average size for a soft/flaccid penis because they vary enormously. Some guys ‘shrink’ a lot more than others when soft. You can NEVER judge how big a guy will be when he is erect from his soft penis size.<br>  <br>  The ‘average’ girth of an erect adult penis, that is the distance AROUND the penis measured at the thickest point, is about 5". Anywhere between 4.7” and 5.2” is normal. <br>  <br>  Most penis growth happens between the ages of 12 and 16 with a subsequent slower rate of growth until the age of 17 or 18. Sometimes up till about 24 or 25yo.<br>  <br>  Approximate lengths for under 18’s are:<br>  At the beginning of puberty 2.4” <br>  12 to 13 ....... 3.0" to 4.0”<br>  14 to 15 ....... 4.0" to 5.0”<br>  16 to 17 ....... 5.0" to 6.0”<br>  <br>  To convert to cm, just multiply the number in inches by 2.54cm. For example, 5 X 2.54 = 12.7 So a 5" penis is 12.7cm|`|kD8iggyCaa	6-7 inches!

T73Y6BnWaa	They are pretty much the same thing. Steroids give testosterone in pill form and testosterone shots are in liquid. All of the same affects go along with taking either of those. If you mean animal like by roid rage then yes.|`|YDykVkcmaa	Testosterone is an Androgen (helps in the development of male characteristics such as facial hair, deep voice, muscle mass, etc.) and it is also a steroid which is a term that is used to denote a substance that helps build muscles.<br>  <br>  It is testosterones muscle building capabilities that has caused it to be labelled a steroid. Testosterone is also a prescription only drug in most countries (not all).<br>  <br>  Testosterone has got a bad name because of sports doping and abuse in the body building industry.<br>  <br>  As to your other question will more t cause someone to become 'animal like' the answer is No! unless you are already animal like.<br>  <br>  Excess testosterone can cause a lot of health and other problems but causing someone who is non-violent to become violent is not one of them.<br>  <br>  Mind you there are possibly deeply hidden personality characteristics that people have that could be triggered by the use of testosterone but that is true of anything (peanuts can kill, orange and red food colouring can cause dramatic behavioural changes, etc., etc.).<br>  <br>  So testosterone does not stand alone as a driver of behavioural change.
HvbIE03saa	A period is a normal bodily function and at your age you shouldn't be trying to stop it. <br>  <br>  Track when you're supposed to have your period (even if it's out of whack, there shouldn't be a two week difference in your periods) and just make sure you have motrin, pads/tampons, and those tummy warming things you need to get through it, should you start.<br>  <br>  If you need to, just tell your friend what's going on, she might tell her Mom, and they'll all understand.<br>  <br>  Jasmine - the birth control pill does not cause you to miss your period, it helps regulate your period. There are certain forms that will cause you to have only 4 periods a year, however I doubt they would give them to a 14 year old.|`|mG8kWrTXaa	The only pill that works like that is the contraceptive pill. Usually you take the active pills for 21 days, then take the fake sugar pills for 7 days, then go on to the next pack.

You're still developing and unfortunately it's just s**t luck that it always tends to come at a bad time.<br>  Take some tablets for period pain, drink plenty of water so you can theoretically flush it out and you should be ok. <br>  You don't have to tell them anything and if the pain does get that bad see a doctor. I used to get bad cramps around your age and found I was low in iron.|`|o7hf7IiJaa	Yes, it the contraceptive pill.

AA11366224	Cancer has been with us for thousands of years.  Until fairly recently, people tended to die of other things.  With improvements in other areas of medicine, people are living longer and are able to suffer the luxury of cancer in their old age.<br>  <br>  Some cancers have become more common, in particular cervical cancers caused by HPV.  This is because of changes in lifestyle.  Women are starting sex earlier and have more sexual partners than they did in the past.<br>  <br>  Nuclear radiation is a factor in some cancers.  However, the background levels of radiation are now considerably less than they were in the 1950s.  The main source of radioactive pollution was not the bomb or nuclear power, but burning coal. Up until the 1950s, coal was the usual way of heating your home and most factories had their own coal fired boilers.  Now only power stations burn coal and steps are taken to minimise the particulates released into the air.|`|Rk46lIBwaa	Cancers have been occurring since man first developed. The difference is that we now live much longer lives on average, increasing the risk.|`|aCDWwsisaa	Ask your grandma how the nuclear bombs gave cancer to the Ancient Egyptians, LOL!<br>  <br>  Cancer rates have been about the same throughout populations & throughout history.  They have been falling since the 1960s because of advances in medicine.  Average lifespans have been increasing since the 1850s, and that HAS resulted in more cancer cases since people aren't dead from poor hygiene in their 30s, so live long enough to develop cancer.<br>  <br>  I'm sure grandma is a lovely person, but don't listen to her about anything to do with science!|`|d456069f8e03a8bf7a79de76c7e45228aa	Yes, people got cancer 50-100 years plus ago and died from it which is one of the reasons a 'war was declared on cancer'. Cancer had always plagued mankind and people were tired of losing family members so research was started to determine exactly what cancer was and to see if it could be 'cured'. The result was that more and more people began to SURVIVE cancer and not die from it. Because more and more survive the public has become more aware of the disease, because of ads on television and more talk about cancer, more fundraising, and more news about the disease . . this gives the illusion that there is more cancer. But it is an ancient disease . . and one that even after 30 years of research still continues to be a mystery. However, the good news is that more and more people are detecting cancer earlier, treatments have improved, and people can survive cancer . . but an overall cure remains out of reach and metastatic cancer remains deadly.<br>  <br>  So, the answer to your question is that people have always gotten cancer. Cancer does not have borders, it affects all age groups, both sexes, every nation, all lifestyles, and while there is awareness to some risks . . no one knows exactly what causes the over 200 different types of cancer.<br>  <br>  American Cancer society: The History of Cancer<br>  <a href="http://www.cancer.org/docroot/CRI/content/CRI_2_6x_the_history_of_cancer_72.asp" rel="nofollow">http://www.cancer.org/docroot/CRI/conten...</a><br>  <br>  Your grandmother is wrong and being overweight has nothing to do with a two year old, teens or young adults getting cancer . . nor does smoking always give an older adult lung cancer . . and even more curious . . just because an adult develops lung cancer does not mean they ever smoked.  No one knows what causes each type of cancer and for every known cancer risk there are exceptions to that rule. Radiation and being overweight may have some effect on some types of cancer for certain kinds of people at risk . . but not everyone is affected by it and continue living without every developing cancer at all.|`|9tMNpFmEaa	Yes. People nowadays give a **** about it because it's the new AIDS.|`|FicyC2TXaa	Cancer has been around as long as humankind and longer.<br>  <br>  The oldest description of cancer in humans was found in an Egyptian papyrus written between 3000-1500 BC. It referred to tumours of the breast.<br>  <br>  The oldest available specimen of a human cancer is found in the remains of skull of a female who lived during the Bronze Age (1900-1600 BC) The tumour in the woman's skull was suggestive of head and neck cancer<br>  <br>  I once read about a tumour discovered in the fossil remains of a dinosaur, but I haven't been able to find the reference again.<br>  <br>  Here are some articles about the history of cancer:<br>  <br>  <a href="http://medicineworld.org/cancer/history.html" rel="nofollow">http://medicineworld.org/cancer/history....</a><br>  <br>  <a href="http://cancer.about.com/od/historyofcancer/a/cancerhistory.htm" rel="nofollow">http://cancer.about.com/od/historyofcanc...</a><br>  <br>  <a href="http://info.cancerresearchuk.org/cancerandresearch/learnaboutcancer/whatiscancer/historyofcancer/" rel="nofollow">http://info.cancerresearchuk.org/cancera...</a><br>  <br>  The origin of the word cancer is credited to the Greek physician Hippocrates (460-370 B.C.)<br>  <br>  There were not so many diagnosed cases 100-200 years ago, but diagnostic techniques and screening were not as sophisticated as they are now; much cancer went undiagnosed.<br>  <br>  There are a number of reasons why cancer APPEARS to be more common these days.<br>  <br>  The first, ironically,  is better general health care; in the west at least, more people are living well into old age than ever before. Many cancers are associated with ageing, and the majority of all those diagnosed with cancer are over 60, so - more old people = more cases of cancer.<br>  <br>  With modern diagnostic techniques and screening., cancers that would not have been spotted in the past are now found through routine screening.<br>  <br>  And of course we hear more about cancer these days in the media. When we didn't have TV, or the internet cancer didn't get as much coverage as it does now. And people are more open about cancer, more willing to talk about it. When my dad got cancer in the 1950s, his mother was really embarrassed because she associated cancer with dirt - I bet she didn't mention it to anybody she knew, as someone in her position would these days<br>  <br>  And celebrities - Patrick Swayze, Kylie Minogue, Jade Goody, Paul Newman are just a few examples - talk  openly about their cancer diagnoses these days; they wouldn't have done that 20 years ago, never mind 50.<br>  <br>  Hearing much more about it can give the impression that it's more widespread and that incidence of cancer have increased - which for several types of cancer (such as breast cancer where rates have not increased significantly for 20 years) is not the case.<br>  <br>  And being overweight is a risk factor (not a cause) of some cancers, but by no means all.|`|7fd09fc865c9d553f3ab7b48c7111aedaa	It's been around since humans have been around. Most animals get cancer. Rats get tumours all the time, sharks however, do not get cancer and studies have been done to try and single out why and if that is transferable to humans. <br>  <br>  Humans get tumours all the time but the body is able to break them down and get rid of them, these are benign and do no damage to the body.<br>  <br>  The Cancer that causes problems are the ones that the body is not able to break down and further problems are caused by that. Cancer is not an external problem caused by pollution, radiation etc. <br>  Obviously smoking and diet factors into it, but on the whole it is a genetic problem that has occurred since the beginning of time.|`|HumMEMu5aa	Two reasons why we didn't hear about cancer in history<br>  <br>  1.  Doctors were not so common, and they didn't have the knowledge to identify many diseases.<br>  <br>  2.  Cancer was regarded as 'unmentionable'.  People didn't talk about it, and would say that a relative had died of heart failure, or wasting disease, or any other 'cover-all' name.<br>  <br>  Verite R|`|hZVJRW7uaa	Because medical systems were not that advanced back then, meaning they didn't know much about those mysterious deaths, 50-100 years ago.

GBG2hbQ4aa	There are generally no noticeable signs for early stages of cervical cancer.  Symptoms that warrant a visit to the doctor include:<br>  *   abnormal bleeding (other than your period); vaginal<br>       bleeding<br>  *    pelvic pain; while pain is normal during your monthly<br>       cycle, pain between periods or pain that lasts longer<br>       than your monthly<br>  *   pain during intercourse;   back pain<br>  *   swelling in just one leg<br>  *   painful urination or blood in urine  (can mean a <br>      urinary tract infection, but is sometimes associated<br>      with cervical cancer<br>  *   unusual odors and/or discharge<br>  *  suddenly (unexplained) feeling tired all the time<br>  *  weight loss or gain (associated with several health <br>     problems, is sometimes a symptom of cancer)<br>  <br>  Things that are associated with a higher risk of cervical cancer are ... first sexual intercourse at an early age; multiple sex partners; smoking; use of oral contraceptives; human papillomavirus (HPV) infection; weakened immune system    (Some of these behaviors are high risk for other cancers as well.)|`|hlYZeY4vaa	I have exactly what you are going through. I am also 20. When I went to my gyno, he checked for everything-- did a pap, checked for chlamydia and gonohhrea. He found nothing cancerous, but said there was some inflammation and free fluid in my pelvic area. His bets were on endometriosis or dysmennhorrea. Check these conditions out, maybe you will find some similarities. Cervical cancer is hereditary in my family. It's almost inevitable. Also, don't take my advice as being professional though, please, go see your gyno.

b7037586581b82e483bcc45bea7734c9aa	None of the studies I have seen show any real long-term effect of stimulant use for those suffering with ADD. I believe that this is because the stimulants work so well for the condition.<br>  <br>  Remember that a stimulant works in a paradoxical manner with ADD. It calms rather than excites if it is right for the person. I had one client who had anxiety secondarily to ADD who dropped 15 points on his blood pressure once we got his ADD under control with Adderall.<br>  <br>  However, there often are side effects from the stimulants that are unwanted. This paticular client eventually changed to ADD-care because even though he was calmer he still had too much stimulation for him.

pTNAgU5uaa	Lexapro and Wellbutrin when taken together have a major drug-drug interaction. <br>  <br>  MONITOR CLOSELY: The use of bupropion is associated with a dose-related risk of seizures. The estimated incidence of seizures is approximately 0.1% at dosages up to 300 mg/day and 0.4% at dosages between 300 to 450 mg/day, but increases almost tenfold between 450 mg and 600 mg/day. The risk may also be increased during coadministration with selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors, such as Lexapro. These agents are often individually epileptogenic and may have additive effects when combined.<br>  <br>  Bupropion and medications given concomitantly should be initiated at the lower end of the dose range and titrated gradually if feasible. The total dose of bupropion should generally not exceed 450 mg/day (or 150 mg every other day in patients with severe hepatic cirrhosis). Bupropion should be discontinued and not restarted in patients who experience a seizure during treatment.|`|uC75y83Taa	Call a 24-hour pharmacy.

I believe it is 98% thc, whereas a joint or bong is about 5-15%.|`|ad6YgqZlaa	I shared a huge spliff the other day and was pretty disappointed as it was supposedly "good shiit"<br>  my tongue tingled when i touched it and the stairs were like tilting when i walked down them but apart from that, nothing much|`|aEKI1Knqaa	Actually, all the above answers are a little off base. No one single smoking device will deliver a high that is stronger than the other. Smoother hits maybe, but, if the weed is the same, the high is the same. A pipe will be a little smoother than a joint, a bong will be smoother than the pipe, a vaporizer will be smoother still...and so on. If you want to know how to get "higher" you either need to concentrate your weed or simply smoke more.<br>  There are many ways to concentrate weed. You could make hash, which is essentially removing the trichomes and smoking or vaping those. You could make oil or budder which involves the use of chemicals and smoke that, which will get you out-of-this-world high. I would say just invest in some high grade weed and a nice vaporizer. Smooth hits on some dank weed will do your lungs, and your head, some good.|`|knmxq1o4aa	The object that gives me the most THC? The smoke from the buds I guess. Stems and leaves have only a small amount of THC in them.|`|eZsr6pOaaa	If you cant vaporize then definetaly get any pipe with water...and try to refrain from eating cause it kills your high|`|9hbsuDJFaa	I agree with the guy above me,smoke more but a vaporizer is the smoothest.

ZbMLigR3aa	Absolutely.  You are definitely having a bad reaction to this opioid medication.  Some people are more sensitive than others to opiates and other narcotic medications.  Call the prescribing doctor if you can to let him or her know about this reaction.  He or she will probably prescribe an anti-nausea medication to abate your symptoms.  However, if you cannot reach your doctor and your reaction/pain gets worse, go to the emergency room, they will be able to assist you.  I hope you find easy relief.  Good luck.|`|AA10953999	Medication effects everyone differently. You may be having an allergic reaction.

nARTpAnDaa	The diet sounds ok however if you want to lose the weight that quickly id say you need to do more exersise, try running or cycling, something to get your heart pumping and burning them calories away.<br>  <br>  Not snacking inbetween meals will also help in weight loss.|`|mFnH5e8saa	Going on your eating regime, it would be difficult to say if you would lose the weight you aim for. You can be as good as you want during the day, but if your mother provides you with an unhealthy meal all the good that you have done in the day would be undone by eating the meal. I have found that eating a healthy breakfast, such as cereal, poached/scrambled eggs on low fat toast, lunch of a sandwich (low fat bread) some fruit and an evening meal of say, grilled meat/fish with fresh vegetables a healthy diet. Plus you can still do your exercises. It is true what they say, you are what you eat. On average a weight loss of around 1-2lb per week is normal.|`|kdXTunqgaa	My friends and I are following weightlosssecret.info. I have lost 8 kilos now since December.

My other friend has a bit more weight to lose than me and she has lost 11 kilos since she started. All info is at the site. You should consider it. It was recommended to me by a natropath friend<br>  My breakfast is filling and I eat way more than a granola bar at lunch and I am losing weight.|`|y3I1qSHEaa	Firstly I think this diet of yours will leave you starving.  You should incorporate fruits into your daily meal plan too.  Eat more than just one granola bar for lunch.  At dinner time in fact is when you should eat light, and no carbs.  This way if you eat a little more and smaller more frequent meals your metabolism will also increase, and therefore help you to lose weight in a better way.<br>  <br>  As for the exercise part, you must include a run or walk everyday for 45 minutes at least.|`|vRJRT0QAaa	If u do not want to make any adjustments to what ur doing currently, then to loose 10 lbs in a month, u will need supplemental help.<br>  <br>  Try out this website, www.sdevkumar.qhealthzone.com for natural supplements<br>               or<br>   www.thebettermeds.com <br>  I am a fitness consultant and I own both these websites.

2sycPf8Daa	Remember if the heart is the pump for your body the brain is the computer that controls all you do. It depends which part of the brain is affected as to what deficits or complications will occur. Therefore, damage to the brain in every Stroke will be different. <br>  <br>  It is difficult to provide definite answers about expected progress at any stage of recovery. Medical tests will have been done and the results, particularly in the initial period, are not always conclusive. No one wants to take away hope or give unrealistic expectations. As the individual’s Stroke is assessed, it must be remembered that each person’s outcome and potential for recovery varies. <br>  <br>  People of any age can suffer a Stroke and every Stroke is different.The impact of a Stroke is far-reaching and may have an effect upon each member of a family.<br>  <br>  After the acute phase of a Stroke is over, many people experience frustration and frequently suffer from depression, anger, resentment and a sense of powerlessness.  Fatigue is also common. As the person who has suffered a Stroke enters the phase of rehabilitation, just how much recovery they will achieve cannot be accurately predicted. Recovery is often a long term process.<br>  <br>  Take care as always!

mzhFrm5Taa	Yes, your tear ducts don't just stop working because your under water|`|wwP3ONCFaa	well yeah, as long as you have a submarine|`|HxXduL1maa	Of course you can cry underwater. <br>  <br>  Crying is simply fluid leaving your eyes via your tear ducts. One might even say that crying doesn't involve tears at all, but only the racking sobs associated with them. Doing it underwater simply means that the fluid leaving your tear ducts mixes with the surrounding solution immediately instead of being exposed to the air. <br>  <br>  In any case, under enough pressure, your body would implode, and crying would be a moot point.|`|GxKnzVVzaa	No....because crying involves breathing, therefore you would drown.

YCXxP43Laa	Try not to think of yourself as a label. You are more than just a diagnosis that was pinned on you, just as you are more than just a guy, more than you hair colour etc. No it's not like being a murderer or a thief. Sometimes they do label people with this when they don't fit any other categories, adn there is still some controversy over the label, and if it even exists.<br>  To be diagnosed with this you would have had to fit certain criteria... which of the symptoms do you identify with? If you feel unhappy with the diagnosis you are well within your rights to demand a second opinion.<br>  Who diagnosed you? It should have been a psychiatrist, not a family doctor.<br>  The treatment for BPD is not generally medication except for antidepressants, or in if you have psychotic episodes maybe antipsychotics. The usual treatment is either CBT or DBT, both are therapies designed to help you learn new ways of regulating your emotions.<br>  It would certainly be worth a second opinion, also don't think of it as a mental illness, it is not a brain chemistry problem in the way schizophrenia is, it is a personality disorder, in the case of BPD affected by your self esteem and emotional dysregulation.|`|ParFJxnSaa	BPD is addressed in section 15, at <a href="http://www.ezy-build.net.nz/~shaneris" rel="nofollow">http://www.ezy-build.net.nz/~shaneris</a> Be aware that, because of their upbringing, people suffering from BPD tend to see things in terms of black and white, rather than shades of grey, and often idealise, then devalue, in relationships. They also tend to have a great fear of abandonment, and sometimes go to extreme lengths to prevent it. A tendency to abuse alcohol and/or drugs, or high risk activities may be present.<br>  <br>  Use the locators, in section 1, at ezy build, and the phone book, to find a therapist who uses Dialectical Behavio(u)ral Therapy, or get a good book on the subject, and give to a therapist using Cognitive Behavio(u)ral Therapy (fairly common, and probably nearby) and ask that it be incorporated into your treatment. Read "I hate you: don't leave me." by Jerold J. Kreisman, m.d. and Hal Stras. A workbook that offers good coping skills is Marsha Linehan's Skills Training Manual (a DBT Workbook). Try <a href="http://www.amazon.com/" rel="nofollow">http://www.amazon.com/</a> for these. View: <a href="http://www.2knowmyself.com/uieforum?c=showthread&ThreadID=72" rel="nofollow">http://www.2knowmyself.com/uieforum?c=sh...</a>   ~~~ THERAPISTS: It depends to a certain extent on what your tentative diagnosis is: people with Borderline Personality Disorder, for example, need to be challenged from time to time, by therapists using DBT. A good therapist will get you to examine the appropriateness of your actions, or thought patterns, and offer the occasional suggestion.<br>  <br>  Some therapists, however, work from an "I know best" basis, and, even though they may actually do know best, their approach often isn't as conducive to progress as others, who take more of a middle position. On the other hand, there are those who try to be your friend, when what you really need is expert help. I suggest that you try at least 3 new therapists, and initially select one you feel most comfortable with, because a good degree of rapport (which takes time to build) can help a lot, with therapy. Closely examine the <a href="http://1-800-therapist.com/" rel="nofollow">http://1-800-therapist.com/</a> & <a href="http://www.metanoia.org/choose/" rel="nofollow">http://www.metanoia.org/choose/</a> websites, and use the locators, there, and/or in the index page of section 1, at <a href="http://www.ezy-build.net.nz/~shaneris" rel="nofollow">http://www.ezy-build.net.nz/~shaneris</a> (and phone book, but only if necessary). Personally, I'd select a clinical psychologist who believes in only recommending minimal necessary medication, if at all, because they don't issue prescriptions, so are considerably less likely to be involved with the rewards, and inducements offered by sales reps from "big pharma": the large drug companies, to psychiatrists (there are links to, or articles on how psychiatry has become corrupted by money from drug companies, and "how doctors are being manipulated", in section 1: worth reading!). <br>  <br>  It's important to not only feel comfortable with your therapist, but also to know about their qualifications, and the type of therapy used (read section 1). Some people are in therapy for many years, and pay a small fortune in fees, so recognise that therapists may have a vested interest in keeping their patients coming back. It pays the rent, and permits them to feel that they are fulfilling a useful function in life. For this reason, I believe that, unless there is a need for a specific type of therapy, such as Dialectical Behavio(u)ral Therapy, for Borderline Personality Disorder, or EMDR therapy, for Post Traumatic Stress Disorder, or ongoing support, in the case of people with bipolar disorder, who find they function best this way, it is a good idea to start out with a clinical psychologist who uses Cognitive Behavio(u)ral Therapy.

4yzxXO1haa	Medication really works on a case by case basis, which is why some people have to go through trialling many different types of meds before they find one which works, and others find they feel much better on the first one they are prescribed.<br>  Zoloft may take up to two or three weeks to take effect. As it is an anti-depressant, you should notice a change in your mood. You may feel less stressed, generally happier, less irritable... If you take it for up to a month or around five weeks and notice no change, you need to see your doctor, who can give you instructions for taking yourself off of zoloft, and perhaps starting something new.<br>  Zoloft is very commonly used. It falls under SSRI class of anti-depressants, which is the safest class, and medications in this group are usually prescribed before the medications in the other classes, which I guess you could call plan B.<br>  Be aware that zoloft can make you feel very sick the first few days, but shouldn't last much longer than that.<br>  If you start noticing any adverse effects (say, suicidal thoughts, which can sometimes happen when taking some anti-depressant medication, especially in younger people), don't hesitate to get in contact with your doctor.<br>  <br>  All the best. =)|`|dBj7dLSraa	From what I've read, it's best to avoid Zoloft.

hzMpdFFBaa	If your general practitioner hasn't given you medication and appropriate directions for how to use the medication to stop a migraine, the practitioner should have referred you to a neurologist or pain specialist. There are pain specialists who typically are neurologists and who specialize in headache treatment. Such a specialist will give you a full neurologic workup. They also will go through your diet and lifestyle habits and may recommend that you keep a food diary and a headache trigger diary (a diary that keeps a record of what you were doing when a migraine started) so that you can modify your diet or daily goings on. You may be given an prescription for a medication with specific instructions on how to use the medication and you may be referred to or recommended to participate in stress-relief or biofeedback programs.  Also note that if you chronically take over-the-counter pain relievers  because of headache pain, you can make the symptoms worse. This is called rebound headache. In this case, a doctor will need to wean you from the OTC meds while giving you another kind of drug to manage the headache pain.|`|Z672v1nSaa	My normal physician thought I was having migraines, so she referred me to a neurologist. He ran lots of tests, and came to the conclusion that it really was migraines. He put me on a prescription to help them.

I would call your doctor and ask for a referral to a neurologist.|`|iY3FOP0waa	cervical vertabrae 2 could be out so visit a chiropractor or possibly an acupuncturist
Gr522w9Naa	I managed a tanning salon for several years. First start out slow, time wise. Each 5 minutes in a bed equals to 1 hr in the sun. Do not bath for at least 2 hrs. after tanning. It cools the body temp down to fast and causes the melanin to rise to the surface to fast. Wear a lotion made for indoor tanning and get one that does not make your skin tingle. That is increasing the blood flow and can cause you to burn. California Tan products are great. They have lots of moisturizers in them. Increase your time by just a minute or 2. The time between 7 & 10 days you shouldn't see a lot of results. It takes time for the melanin to rise to the outer layer of your skin which is trying to reach oxygen. Hope your tanning experience turns out well.|`|X4hz3a9haa	no you don't wear cream and you usually only go on for about 10 mins at a time, check with the tanning salon your going to use as to time spent on bed.|`|d3VV4b6vaa	the salon should give you good info....but usually they say just 8-10min the first time in a low UV bed..and its always best to apply an oil (natural oils work bets I find..such as shea butter or coconut oil) evenly right before you get in.|`|h3s02b3Jaa	I have not used one for some time, but we used to have a shower before we went, or one at the saloon before we used the sun beds.

There should be some notice or person to tell you how long as some are quick tanners and some take longer or only do one side at a time.|`|29hcn9JRaa	I advise you to not use any cream, I also would recommend that if you are of fair skin to use caution and limit your time in the bed to under 10 minutes.

In times of crisis, the emergency room doctor at a hospital may be able to provide temporary help for an emotional problem, and will be able to tell you where and how to get further help.<br>  <br>  Listed below are the types of people and places that will make a referral to, or provide, diagnostic and treatment services.<br>  <br>      * Family doctors<br>      * Mental health specialists, such as psychiatrists, psychologists, social workers, or mental health counselors<br>      * Health maintenance organizations<br>      * Community mental health centers<br>      * Hospital psychiatry departments and outpatient clinics<br>      * University- or medical school-affiliated programs<br>      * State hospital outpatient clinics<br>      * Family service/social agencies<br>      * Private clinics and facilities<br>      * Employee assistance programs<br>      * Local medical and/or psychiatric societies<br>  <br>  How to Help Yourself if You Are Depressed<br>  <br>  Depressive disorders make one feel exhausted, worthless, helpless, and hopeless. Such negative thoughts and feelings make some people feel like giving up. It is important to realize that these negative views are part of the depression and typically do not accurately reflect the situation. Negative thinking fades as treatment begins to take effect. In the meantime:<br>  <br>      * Set realistic goals and assume a reasonable amount of responsibility.<br>      * Break large tasks into small ones, set some priorities, and do what you can as you can.<br>      * Try to be with other people and to confide in someone; it is usually better than being alone and secretive.<br>      * Participate in activities that may make you feel better.<br>      * Mild exercise, going to a movie, a ballgame, or participating in religious, social, or other activities may help.<br>      * Expect your mood to improve gradually, not immediately. Feeling better takes time.<br>      * It is advisable to postpone important decisions until the depression has lifted. Before deciding to make a significant transition–change jobs, get married or divorced–discuss it with others who know you well and have a more objective view of your situation.<br>      * People rarely “snap out of” a depression. But they can feel a little better day by day.<br>      * Remember, positive thinking will replace the negative thinking that is part of the depression and will disappear as your depression responds to treatment.<br>      * Let your family and friends help you.|`|rMewByCzaa	On this site is a Top Ten of Depression Blogs.

I still don't know if, or when, they may try again. I didn't appreciate how small my other problems were until these events happened and took over my life. I only mention this to show that whatever you're going through, there is always something worse, and cutting won't help anything.|`|CoP9d4X8aa	Go see your doctor.

0TT5q0cUaa	no these are just myths and there are are a lot of myths like these flying around you should clarify your mind of them.<br>  some common myths are:<br>  Only males masturbate – this is not true. Females masturbate as much as males do. However, they tend to report it less than males due to the social stigma attached to it. Also it has been observed that females tend to reduce or discontinue masturbation once they get into meaningful sexual relationships.<br>  <br>  Masturbation is unhealthy – masturbation per se does not cause any health hazards. It is not an unhealthy habit. However, it may be mentally unhealthy if it assumes obsessive proportions and the individual is unable to think of anything else. It may also have physical repercussions if the instrument used to masturbate is dirty or infected.<br>  <br>  Only adolescents masturbate – though the practice usually begins during adolescence, almost all adults practise it at some time or the other. <br>  <br>  Masturbation does not provide as much satisfaction as sexual intercourse – sometimes masturbation is more satisfying than the sex act. This is because, during masturbation, an individual is in control of his own movements and can maximize the pleasure according to his or her needs. During sexual intercourse, the degree of satisfaction may, to some extent, lie with the partner.<br>  <br>  People masturbate only if they have unfulfilling sexual relationships – people also masturbate for self satisfaction, even when they have fully satisfying sexual relationships.|`|X008O0cuaa	No Masturbation is not harmful at all.<br>  <br>  You are satisfying yourself instead of sleeping with someone and get transmitted STDs or veneral diseases. at your age, it is normal.

CciXZNYraa	Here are a few tips;<br>  <br>  WHEN to eat for losing weight... <br>  <br>  ? Eat (at least) three times a day. <br>  Because when you eat only once a day, your metabolism gets slower than it already is! That's the main reason. Sounds funny, but to lose weight... you must eat (the right things, of course) <br>  ? Eat low-fat, high-fiber foods such as salads and vegetable pastas.<br>  ? Your last meal should be before 18:00. Try. <br>  OK, one apple after 18:00 <br>  ? Don't starve <br>  Starvation is not good for losing weight, nor your health. <br>  Starvation is the worse thing you can do in a weight loss diet. <br>  ? Try oatmeal instead of cornflakes for breakfast--eating oatmeal can help reduce cholesterol levels, and its high fiber content will keep you full longer.<br>  <br>  WHAT to drink for losing weight... <br>  <br>  ? Drink 6-8 glasses of water every day ! <br>  Can be tap, plain, mineral, sparkling. I just love mineral sparkling water! <br>  This improves your bowel, reduces the "hunger" sensation, and hydrates your skin. Your skin will look much better after the first weeks! <br>  Don't believe the slogan "water makes me fat". Beside being stupid... you might get into serious troubles with your kidneys. <br>  ? Drink ONLY natural juices, freshly squeezed! <br>  Don't drink Coca Cola, Pepsi, Spite etc. during the diet. Even lite or light versions. <br>  ? Avoid those vending machines by carrying around your own healthful foods and leaving pocket change at home.<br>  <br>  Exercise for losing weight... <br>  <br>  ? If you want quicker results - exercise would be good. <br>  ? Don't just sit in front of the TV and eat peanuts... <br>  I guarantee THIS won't work for your weight loss... <br>  ? Start a regular exercise program and stick with it. Don't be afraid of those sweat suits and Lycra pants! <br>  ? Start swimming. Swimming is an excellent exercise to get involved with, since it increases blood flow and uses muscles we don't regularly use. Start a swimming program and try to do it 3 times a week. You will feel excellent and rejuvenated.<br>  ? Choose an exercise program that you enjoy, and don't shun the unconventional. For instance, did you know that regular vigorous dancing is exercise too?<br>  ? Also Cardiovascular exercises such as running, jogging, or aerobics will help you lose that unwanted belly fat. Weight training can also help you lose body fat because the more muscle mass you have, the more ability your system has to burn body fat.<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|l0oDymHYaa	Hi Dear<br>  <br>  Why don't you use the Yahoo spelling checker this way you will improve your word power.<br>  You have to wait on eating to loose weight.

Impossible. The only thing you can do to lose the fat and flab is to eat properly, exercise and lose in your total BMI. Just take in a proper low fat diet and increase your workouts. One day weights, one day cardio - or if you have time every day, 30 minutes weights (high reps/low weight) and 45 to 60 minutes of cardio (cycling, rowing, swimming, e.t.c...)<br>  <br>  You can also try a god juicing fast to start with.

Since you're being so restrictive, you'll want to get in the necessary nutrients and less sugar. So two eggs and two strips of bacon for breakfast. Cottage cheese and fresh fruit. Hard boiled egg and peanut butter whole wheat toast. Veggie omelet. Even just yogurt. Stuff like that will keep you feeling fuller longer and be better for you than the suggary bar!!

The more quickly you do it, the more quickly you put it back on. Also, it's not good for you to just 'suddenly' start exercising vigorously. Do it slowly and that way you will be able to keep it up and not put the weight back on.<br>  <br>  The best exercise for burning calories is cardio-aerobic. Jogging, cycling, power-walking, swimming, aerobic dancing or general aerobic workouts.

The main thing is to stick in there.  You can't be an addict to food and never exercise if you want to live a healthy life and keep the weight off.  I've worked out, done every diet, and all types of classes.  <br>  <br>  Nothing works,  besides dedication and intelligence towards the subject of losing weight.  <br>  <br>  First,  depending on how much weight you need to lose,  your diet is the first concern.  You can't eat 10,000 calories a day and expect the weight to come off,  even if you are exercising a lot.  Which brings us to the next thing.  Duh,  Exercising...<br>  <br>  This is a must especially if you need to a lot of weight.  Get at least 30 mins of some good hardcore exercising.  Do some cardio,  in the long run,  it's good for the heart.<br>  <br>  However,  I find the most hardest part of losing weight/keeping it off,  in my diet.  It's so hard to keep your fingers out of the cookie jar or those chocolate goodies.  I've found a great addition to help any one out,  it's a natural weight loss supplement called Proactol.  Now don't get all crazy on me and say diet pills don't work.  That is true,  but not in this case.  This one isn't meant to burn pounds while you sit on the couch.  It's an appetite suppressant,  along with being a fat binder.  I saved money on the pills at <a href="http://starturl.com/efblc" rel="nofollow">http://starturl.com/efblc</a> along with getting some good info.  It basically makes those fingers not go towards the cookie jar.  For me it's the best pill I've tried and I've tried cupboards full.  Now this doesn't mean you have to follow my foot steps but I've successfully lost roughly 70 pounds and keeping it off til this day.  <br>  <br>  Well good luck and remember what I said,  Dedicate.|`|tERrqwzaaa	high intensity cardio!<br>  jump roping, jogging, dancing!<br>  <br>  <br>  try lots of lunges and squats with weights in your hands to make it even more intense<br>  do it to your favorite music :]<br>  do 30 squats<br>  jog on the spot for a minute<br>  do another 30 squats<br>  jog for a minute<br>  15 lunges on one leg<br>  15 on the other<br>  jog for a minute<br>  15 lunges on one leg<br>  15 on the other<br>  jog for a minute<br>  <br>  do this as often as you can :]<br>  doesnt take up much time, 10/15 minutes max?!<br>  <br>  really gets your legs burning :)<br>  <br>  good luck<br>  its knackering haha, make sure you stretch well before <br>  xo|`|tSjJpjzKaa	The food you eat not only contributes to the quality of your weight and general health, but also on how well you sleep.

7IjGzvqTaa	I would suggest going to speak to a psychologist instead of a psychiatrist.  I think it's better to try and work through a problem like anxiety with someone who will do everything in their power to keep from having to prescribe drugs to you.  Drugs don't necessarily cure the illness as much as they treat the symptoms.  To get to the root of the problem, you really should attempt to work on it without supplements.<br>  <br>  I realize this didn't really answer your question, but it's just my advice.  I wish you luck!|`|AA10493307	If the herbal works stay with it.  <br>  <br>  Some rock stars have extreme stage fright.  They take enderal. It lasts 4 hours.  They manage to get through the concert without panic and generally don't take it again until the next concert.  Ask your psychiatrist about it.  It has less side effects than the other drug alternatives.|`|ParFJxnSaa	Try it, but use this: View the techniques for control of anxiety/panic attacks, in section 8, at ezy build, below. Begin, on this first occasion, only, by holding your breath for 5, or 10 seconds: this will give you the confidence to realise that YOU CAN CONTROL YOUR BREATHING, but not pass out, or die (your autonomic nervous system resumes breathing, if you become unconscious). Advice from a published psychiatrist on controlled breathing: (1.) Get a clock, or watch with a second timer. (2.) Practise for 5 minutes, 4 times daily, until proficient. (3.) Take a small breath in, and hold it, for 6 seconds. (4.) Think to yourself: "RELAX", just before breathing out. (5.) Try to feel a sense of releasing tension, as you breathe out. (6.) Breathe in for 3 seconds, then out, for 3 seconds. Try to make your breathing very smooth, and light, as you breathe in through your nose, and out through your mouth, or nose. (7.) For the next minute, continue to breathe in, and out, every 3 seconds. (8.) Go back to step 3, at the end of the minute, and proceed through to step 7, doing this for 5 minutes. Use this at the very first sign of a panic attack starting, or any time you feel anxious, or tense. Similar, but simpler advice, from a clinical psychologist is to breathe in to the count of 3: (one thousand one; one thousand two; one thousand three) each takes around a second to say to yourself, in your mind. Then breathe out to the count of 3. Repeat, until it begins to take effect. Understand panic attacks, and what triggers them, in your life (if it is unresolved anxiety, or stress, see sections 6, [page N first] or 42, [page i first] respectively). <br>  <br>  The paper bag method also works for most people, but is not suited to all circumstances, such as driving, or playing sport. Another alternative is psychotherapy, to address its fundamental cause, which is usually anxiety; read section 1, and examine the <a href="http://1-800-therapist.com/" rel="nofollow">http://1-800-therapist.com/</a> & <a href="http://www.metanoia.org/choose/" rel="nofollow">http://www.metanoia.org/choose/</a> websites, and use the locators to find a therapist, (and phone book, but only if necessary). I used to suffer from panic attacks, until I questioned what had changed in my life, at, or just before that time, to trigger them, which is enough for some people. Visualise as vividly as possible, a large, red, flashing, "STOP!" sign, and/or possibly a stern faced person wagging an index finger at you in a negative manner, then say to yourself as forcefully as you can, even aloud in a big voice, if alone: "I know this tactic: GO AWAY FOR A WHILE !!!" You may want to us either: "ruse", "ploy", "game", or "trick", instead of "tactic". It usually takes 30 - 40 repetitions, for most people, to establish a new habit. I also suggest that you learn, then practise the controlled breathing technique, until competent, then employ it, at the very first sign of a panic attack.<br>  <br>  Practice one of the relaxation methods in sections 11, 2, 2c, or 2i, daily, and when needed. Also, give the EFT a good tryout, to see if it helps you. There is also a version for use in public places, (if you like, you can claim to have a headache, as you massage/lightly tap your temples, but you would then be restricted to subvocalising - saying it to yourself in your mind). Sections 53, and 2, 2.q and 2.o at <a href="http://www.ezy-build.net.nz/~shaneris" rel="nofollow">http://www.ezy-build.net.nz/~shaneris</a> also refer: "Even though I sometimes suffer from panic attacks, I deeply and completely accept myself." Note: the controlled breathing only helps with the symptoms (as do medications/herbal remedies): you need to address the underlying cause, which requires some form of therapy, and Cognitive Behavio(u)ral Therapy has been shown to be effective. Imagine that the cause of your panic; your anxieties, fears, your self doubts, self recriminations, all the agonizing "I'm-so-Stupids"; every painful "I-can't-do-it" are huge raging, hurtful bulls snorting and charging at you. You see them coming at you and you hold out your red matador's cape at arms length and simply let them charge right by.|`|0mqF0nqhaa	Take the Linden Method !<br>  <br>  The Linden Method was developed by Charles Linden, an ex sufferer of panic attacks, anxiety disorder, agoraphobia and other anxiety related conditions. Used by tens of thousands of sufferers worldwide, this method's success rate is undeniable. The Linden Method is so simple to use, fast and permanent in fact, it is so successful that it is guaranteed for 365 days<br>  <br>  <a href="http://xrl.us/beg67e" rel="nofollow">http://xrl.us/beg67e</a>|`|zDhSWcJYaa	Before you try any form of medication I would look at trying other methods that are designed to tackle the area of anxiety or panic attacks that you are having and why.<br>  <br>  My girlfriend was constantly having panic attacks, which was making her an absoulute mess. Constantly worrying that something terrible was going to happen to her and her family and how was she going to cope when that time came. She was so convince that all things bad were coming her way. <br>  <br>  This made it very hard to live with, her constant fear, her anxious thoughts all the time were really put a strain on our relationship. She was very reluctant to try any medication of any sort. <br>  <br>  So I made it my task to resource some information for her, what I came accross was a review of the anxiety release method, which provided on line videos, audios and book. There was also coaching available for her. She was a little reluctant at first but I went and bought it for her. I must say this program has saved our relationship, her attacks are very few now and she is full of confidence. You have nothing to lose, I would strongly recommend you check it out you can see a copy of the review here at <a href="http://www.beatanxietypanicattacks.com/joe-barry-anxiety-release-method-review.php" rel="nofollow">http://www.beatanxietypanicattacks.com/j...</a> . The online videos were fantastic, we actually sat together to watch them and I actually went throught the online program with her, which made me realize what she was actually living with for so long.<br>  <br>  The program really helps get to the core of your problems.<br>  <br>  Good Luck I hope this helps you as it has helped us

7IjGzvqTaa	Well, they say that the average person isn't technically done growing until about the age of 25.<br>  <br>  I don't know in your case, though.  You could stop early, or you might just keep growing, if only just a little.  And keep in mind that you don't have to be shorter than your parents; my mom was 5ft 7 and my dad is 5ft 11, and my brother ended up 6ft 9.  Crazy tall jerk, got all the good family genes...<br>  <br>  But yeah, so you may actually end up taller.  More than likely, though, you're about done.
VnHBNJkiaa	Sorry to hear of your discomfort.  Sounds like the sex was good, but might have been a little rougher than you're used to.  Higher passion levels tend to blur, or even move the line between pleasure and pain.  A burning sensation upon urinating could be a symptom of a bladder infection, which is sometimes called the 'honeymoon illness.'  Frequent sex provides more opportunity for bacteria to enter the urinary tract, especially for women.  But if you have blood in your urine I highly recommend you see a doctor today.  That could indicate something serious, and you shouldn't take a chance.  Though your sex was protected, there's still the possibility of transmitting something.  Don't rule it out.<br>  <br>  Take care, Paint the Stars, and feel better really soon.  In the meantime, flush wuth cool water AS you void.  It won't be as painful.|`|xYgFcEfwaa	burning.... hahaha<br>  definately STD<br>   :)<br>  how i know...i m not a girl but a boy, and i had the burning sensation and went to doctor and yea he told me...<br>  also tell your partner not to push it too much in...<br>  doctor should give you tablets, and its a 7 day course and it should be fine after that.|`|fdNo9Flbaa	You have a UTI, Kidney or bladder infection<br>  --The spotting could be the condom or he is just going to hard.<br>  try lubricated condoms because dry condoms can pinch the vagina and cause injuries.<br>  <br>  Go to the doctor|`|jfOSVSQkaa	Sounds like an infection, consult a gynecologist as soon as you can.|`|2o6qrGKdaa	Sounds alot like a urinary tract/bladder infection. It doesn't always start burning first, but as far as I know, burning is always a sign of infection.<br>  I strongly suggest NOT having sex with your boyfriend until you go to a doctor, because you're going to give him the same infection and I don't think he's going to be happy about that. <br>  The doctor will tell you everything you need to know, probably check out your kidneys and such and give you some antibiotics and pain medication. But go NOW before it spreads or gets worse!|`|qZLl5sb1aa	Burning during urination? <br>  sounds like maybe clahmydia or ghonorria <br>  idk about the spotting tho..|`|FIG58FVpaa	It sounds like you might have a UTI.

YCXxP43Laa	The racing thoughts may be indicative of bipolar... but the mood swings are unlikely to be . Although bipolar is characterized by moods swings they tend to be of a period lasting at least a week to months. Faster mood swings are common in borderline personality. They are quite closely connected, but the frequency of mood swings suggest you do not have bipolar.. though there is a condition called cyclothimia 'bipolar light' where you have mini highs.<br>  The difference between bipolar and BPD is that with the latter you don't have manic highs. You have to have highs in order to be bipolar.<br>  As I said though the racing thoughts could be.<br>  What you need to do is to go back to see a psychiatrist for further evaluation. No one on here can tell you what you have by just listing your symptoms... and in fact listening on here is dangerous as you may choose to believe something and miss the treatment you need.<br>  I thought I had borderline as I matched lots of the symptoms.. but when I saw a psychiatrist I was diagnosed as bipolar. They are similar, but as I said you'd have manic highs as well as anger.|`|LYhiCV4saa	Hi, Hyena Island Inquisition. <br>  <br>  I can see that you're very worried about this. From what you've written, your symptoms do sound consistent with Borderline Personality Disorder. If you're not comfortable with the diagnosis, though, you need to ask your psychiatrist about your concerns and make sure that he/she answers your questions to your satisfaction. You could also request a second opinion from another doctor if you need further reassurance.<br>  <br>  I'm sorry you've had such a difficult life. I've often seen your questions here on Y!A. I hope no one has been telling you to "go away"- surely the whole point of a forum like this is that it lets people who are having a tough time get a bit of support in a safe, anonymous way. I really wish you well and I hope you find the answers that you're looking for. Jenny<br>  <br>  Edit: Thanks for explaining. I'm glad no one's been telling you to "go away". I can understand why you'd feel frustrated if no one answers your questions.|`|28RK2hKBaa	I just answered one of your other questions like this one. I found it on a search but here's the answer either way:<br>  <br>  I think with Doctors it's a guessing game for them. It can be irritating. <br>  You can have both or either. I have been told some Doctors that I am bipolar and not borderline and by others that I am borderline and not Bipolar. I am on meds for bipolar either way an being treated with therapy for borderline. The 2 doctors disagree on a diagnosis. There still isn't a defined diagnosis but I have been told that the 2 overlap so many times that it can be a long time for them to be sure. I feel like giving up so many times but..we'll see.<br>  You can try a second opinion but it might not be what you want to hear. Or they might just say "not sure".."maybe" <br>  What you have described does not rule out bipolar because there are also cases of bipolar with rapid cycling that mimics borderline too btw..<br>  Not sure if I helped you at all but good luck.<br>  <br>  I added my myspace page and a link to an article about rapid cycling bipolar and bordelrine.<br>  Source(s):<br>  www.myspace.com/beatuspandora
TKf6z1vHaa	Your overthinking the perception that other people have of you. Granted there are people out there that judge others based on appearance or past behavior, but do you honestly want people like that to be your friends, people who wont' give you the benefit of the doubt. There are so many good people out there. Try socializing more and meeting people. You need to build up a network of friends and family that you can trust and rely on. This might be hard because friendships and relationships take time to build and need to be nurtured, but it will help you overcome this animosity that you have towards others. <br>  Also, I would suggest some counseling. It seems as if you have made great improvements, but I would recommend going to a psychologist. If you work on the counseling it could possible greatly benefit you. <br>  Don't ever give up though. Even in the most dire of situations we must still be resilient and work hard. Good luck!|`|c3h3qgNpaa	well i wnt want to give up<br>  but if it goes on and on and on.....<br>  den i'll *** 2 a point where i will give up<br>  i think tats where i am now<br>  it's horrifying.....|`|OKPFeBtYaa	So you are too proud to admit your a fvckup.

7IjGzvqTaa	I find steam good for both.  I was sick two or so weeks ago with the flu, but in my stubbornness, I still went to school.  In the mornings, though, despite waking up stuffed up and croaky, I would hop in the shower and the steam would help incredibly.  If she doesn't like to shower in the morning, or if she's before the age where she prefers showers, then I would suggest a glass of warm milk with a 1/2 teaspoon of honey stirred in.  It doesn't take much; just enough to sooth the throat.  As for the congestion...hmm...perhaps a nasal spray?  It's not comfortable, but there aren't many natural remedies (other than steam) for that sort of thing.<br>  <br>  Good luck, and I hope she gets to feeling better soon!|`|JmCY7Bnnaa	YEsh..i have just the things...<br>  <br>  buy ginger root<br>  <br>  and chop it up or wot eva...and add it to a cupa boiling hot water<br>  <br>  and leave for 15 mins...and  u have ginger tea :) works awsome..<br>  <br>  <br>  <a href="http://altmedicine.about.com/cs/3/a/Ginger_Tea.htm" rel="nofollow">http://altmedicine.about.com/cs/3/a/Ging...</a>

You can find them at any drug store or pharmacy. It sounds like it may be painful to use but believe me it isn't. You mix a packet of saline with warm water in the bottle provided with the kit and lean over the sink and slowly squirt it into each nostril. It will completely clean out your sinus's. It will give you some relief but it does sound like you have an infection. I know some doctors do not like to give out antibiotics, they like to see if you can get over it on your own. If nothing else lie and tell them you have had this for 3 or 4 weeks. Then they will give you the meds  you need. I would definitely get the saline rinse though.|`|TwVd0etQaa	Because your coughing up 'green thick' mucus it is definitly an infection.

ZUX03uZZaa	As mentioned, "shallow" is a personality trait.  They have a personality, but it's "shallow".<br>  <br>  "People with a shallow personality are generally concerned only with the surface of things, and not with any deeper meaning or implications. People with Shallow Personalitys can frequently be identified by the fact that they are very interested in appearances, and are rather less interested in the actual characteristics of the object behind the appearance."|`|jjQogMkAaa	Of course they do.<br>  <br>  It's just shallow people may be more reserved and not want other people to know what's happening behind their front.<br>  <br>  Where'as bubbly people who talk a lot may make you feel they're letting you get to know them in actual fact they still could hold you at arms length.<br>  <br>  Everyone has a personality, whether it's what they want you to think or what they show you.|`|W7l1awFPaa	Yes, just extremely self-centred ones.|`|aYVVwjBXaa	obviously they do, since shallowness is a personality trait.|`|e5VUwaRsaa	Yes, personality involves a stable set of traits that do not change much over time. They also differ from one person to the next. So, just because shallow people may seem like they don't have a good personality, it doesn't mean they don't have one at all.|`|OyBuEpOTaa	Yes of course. their personality shows that they are a shallow person.  hmmm define shallow
ffe04ac4fefbb1ae0a7bd8d06171e322aa	It chubs you up.|`|90x0vsTAaa	Pretty sure it fattens you up.|`|qEIeJLtGaa	Yes, you'll probably look more bloated, as well as fatter if you eat like that all of the time. "Bad carbs" mess with your body's hormones, and because of that the likelihood that those carbs will get stored as fat increases dramatically, especially if you're inactive. Bad carbs can cause diabetes 2 if eaten frequently on a sedentary lifestyle, among other health problems. Bad carbs are rapidly absorbed into the blood stream, forcing the body to produce tons of insulin to maintain even blood sugar levels. Over time, with constant assaults from refined sugars and flours, the body may become desensitized to it and thus you develop diabetes. In other words, your body loses it's ability to regulate your blood sugar in response to what you eat, so you could have a potentially life-threatening situation.
fk9AvB25aa	Sounds more like irritation. If it is herpes you would at least have some painful itching going on where the bumps are. Out breaks of herpes can be mild enough to look like little pimples, but they usually look like raised blisters or open sores. They could be in grown hairs from the last time you shaved, boils, chaffing, boils, or ordinary pimples.<br>  Also if you haven't had any kind of sed yet (oral or regular sex) then I doubt that this could be herpes. It could be some thing that was triggered by your period. if you want to know for sure then you might want to wait until your period is over and if the bumps are still there then get them tested for herpes.|`|TvGW3xV0aa	It sounds more like some type of irritation or something else innocent rather than Herpes.

rbkWmBThaa	i don't know..i asked my mom why..(she's not yet in menopausal stage)..she hit me with pillow and walk out..don't know why..i think they run out of hormones..|`|YmELDRSEaa	Menopause starts as the functioning of the ovaries begin to change. The ripening and release of the ovum (which, during the reproductive years leads to ovulation and then menstruation if pregnancy does not occur), becomes unpredictable. Ovulations start to be skipped, and the menstrual cycle starts to become less reliable in timing. As these changes become more pronounced, periods start to be skipped, and other perimenopausal symptoms may appear.<br>  <br>  After a number of years of erratic functioning, the ovaries almost completely stop producing progesterone and two out of the three estrogen hormones: estradiol and estriol. Estrone is one estrogen which is still produced in reasonable amounts in post-menopausal women. Testosterone levels decrease; however, a decrease in testosterone levels begins gradually in young adulthood. Testosterone levels are thought not to drop significantly during the menopause transition because the stroma of the postmenopausal ovary and the adrenal gland still continue to secrete small amounts of testosterone, even during post-menopause.<br>  <br>  Menopause is the end of the reproductive years rather than the beginning, and thus it is the opposite of menarche, nonetheless it can usefully be compared with that event: the menopause transition years are in many ways similar to puberty in that women experience hormonal fluctuations which usher in a new stage of life. Similar to pubescent girls, menopausal women are often unfamiliar or uneducated about the types of bodily changes they are undergoing, and may require time to adjust to the accompanying effects of these changes.<br>  <br>  <br>  [edit] Age of onset<br>  The typical age range for the occurrence of menopause is between the ages of 45 and 55[1]. The average age of menopause varies according to geographic location. In the Western world, the average age of menopause is 51 years[2]. In some developing countries, such as India and the Philippines, the median age of natural menopause is considerably earlier, at 44 years[3].<br>  <br>  In the Western World, last period ever occurring between the ages of 55 to 60 is known as a "late menopause", and an "early menopause" is defined as having one's final period somewhere between the ages of 45 to 50.<br>  <br>  Rarely, the ovaries stop working at a very early age, anywhere from the age of puberty to age 20, and this is known as premature ovarian failure (POF), also commonly referred to as "premature menopause". 1% of women experience POF, and it is not considered to be due to the normal effects of aging. Some known causes of premature menopause include autoimmune disorders, thyroid disease, diabetes mellitus, chemotherapy, eating disorders, and radiotherapy. However, in the majority of spontaneous cases of premature menopause, the cause is unknown.<br>  <br>  Premature menopause is diagnosed or confirmed by measuring the levels of follicle stimulating hormone (FSH) and luteinizing hormone (LH); the levels of these hormones will be abnormally high if menopause has occurred. Rates of premature menopause have been found to be significantly higher in fraternal and identical twins; approximately 5% of twins reach menopause before the age of 40. The reasons for this are not completely understood. Transplants of ovarian tissue between identical twins have been successful in restoring fertility.<br>  <br>  On average, women who smoke cigarettes experience menopause significantly earlier than non-smokers.[4]<br>  <br>  <br>  [edit] Menopause in other species<br>  Menopause in the animal kingdom appears perhaps to be somewhat uncommon, although the incidence in different species has by no means been thoroughly researched. However, it is already quite apparent that humans are not the only species that experience it. Menopause has been observed in rhesus monkeys[5] and all other primates, some cetaceans[6], as well as in a variety of other vertebrate species including the guppy[7], the platyfish, the budgerigar, the laboratory rat and mouse, and the opossum.<br>  <br>  <br>  [edit] Menopause in human evolution<br>  The Grandmother hypothesis suggests that menopause evolved in humans because it promotes the survival of grandchildren. According to this hypothesis, post reproductive women feed and care for children, adult nursing daughters, and grandchildren whose mothers have weaned them. Human babies require large and steady supplies of glucose to feed the growing brain. In infants in the first year of life, the brain consumes 60% of all calories, so both babies and their mothers require a dependable food supply. Some evidence suggests that hunters contribute less than half the total food budget of most hunter-gatherer societies, and often much less than half, so that foraging grandmothers can contribute substantially to the survival of grandchildren at times when mothers and fathers are unable to gather enough food for all of their children. In general, selection operates most powerfully during times of famine or other privation. So although grandmothers might not be necessary during g|`|Z8xyY0g8aa	When a female is being formed in the mother's womb, they produce allll their eggs then, and they start ovulating during puberty.

Cos depression is a state of exaggeration of normal sad & pessimistic feelings that occur in a normal person.<br>  <br>  Most characteristics of mania too can be found as in normal people, as long as the intensity, duration and frequency of them are not severe enough to be diagnosed as clinical mania.<br>  <br>  So the answer to ur question is, if u take bipolar 'characteristics', they can be justified as normal as long as their intensity, duration and frequency are not severe enough to be diagnosed as clinical bipolar disorder.

Good Luck! xx|`|mNJFttV6aa	It really depends on what you mean by "a while ago".  If it was yesterday that you had the extraction then it is normal as there is swelling and a wound to heal.  If it was extracted a month ago then perhaps you need to go back to the dentist.  If the gums are pulsating you may have fragments of the tooth in the gums causing an infection.  Check with your dentist|`|e25149c4b92661e23727bb5ebba001f7aa	How long ago was it?  It's normal for a few weeks, yeah.

JQKADWyzaa	So I'm going to answer what you told me not to, go to counseling, period. And don't just go to "counseling" go to a physiologist, who will prescribe you medicine to maker you feel better. <br>  <br>  Here are some steps int he mean time, I know it LONG but its really important you read it, I really hope you get better good luck!<br>  <br>         Tell someone you trust about your feelings. This is one of the hardest steps. Chances are, if you've been hiding out for months, or maybe even years, and covering up all of your problems, it is going to be very difficult to suddenly open up. However, confiding in somebody who is trustworthy will be well worth it; they will be able to give you advice, support, help you understand your emotions, and be an alternative outlet rather than cutting. Don't be discouraged if they seem shocked, scared, or maybe even horrified. Of course it will have a massive impact on them. Wait for the person to come to terms with the situation. However, always be sure to confide in someone who you know will help you. Telling someone who will make your situation worse is a bad idea (and seriously, these people exist). <br>  <br>           Talk to this person whenever you have the urge to cut. When you feel like cutting yourself, confide in a teacher, school counselor, parent, friend, relative, etc. If they don't know about your current struggle, tell them about it and tell them you need their help to keep yourself from cutting again. <br>  <br>         Keep a hotline number with you at all times. When you feel the urge to cut, pick up the phone and call the hotline. Crisis hotline staff are trained to provide support and offer you alternatives to cutting yourself. If you haven't gathered the courage to open up to someone close to you yet, then talking anonymously on an untracked hotline would be a good idea. Whenever you feel like cutting yourself, call the hotline number and tell them how you're feeling. Soon, you will start to learn a lot more about your emotions. The staff will be able to help you view your situation in a more positive way. <br>  <br>           Try talking to a professional crisis clinician. It is clear that it is not their job to "talk you out of" cutting yourself - you make your own choices and you must take responsibility for either cutting or not cutting. However, talking to your GP or another professional and notifying them of your situation will help. They may be able to tell you if you have the symptoms of a disease or disorder (depression, etc.) that may be contributing/causing you to cut. They may also be able to refer you to a clinic or support group. <br>  <br>           Remove cutting tools from your immediate area. If you have time to search for something to cut yourself with, you may just be able to crush the impulse. One minute can determine whether or not you self harm. Don't keep sharp objects on your table, and don't put razors in a close drawer or cupboard. Remove anything which you may use to cut yourself. Put other "cutting tools" wrapped up in boxes and high up on hard-to-reach shelves. <br>   <br>          Identify the 'trigger' that gives you the urge to cut. The moment you have the urge to cut, stop and think of what has just occurred. Remember it and try to avoid these situations. For example, if you've just had an argument with somebody close to you, and are having the urge to cut, stop and ask yourself what's making you feel this way; "I feel like cutting myself because I've just had an argument with somebody I love, and it's making me feel really bad." Determine what in particular makes this situation trigger off negative emotions-a certain feeling, or maybe an action? Then work on reducing this issue until you have it under control or completely diminished. <br>  <br>           If you need to hurt yourself, do it in a controlled and less harmful way. A good idea is to wear a rubber band around your wrist. Every time you want to cut, snap the rubber band against your wrist instead. You can also draw on your wrist with red pen, or rub an ice cube on your wrist. Although all of these cause some immediate pain, it is much milder and much less dangerous. <br>  <br>         Express your emotions. For example, when you feel like cutting, try doing one or more of the following: <br>  Drawing or scribbling on paper <br>  Painting, on white paper <br>  Listening to music that relates to your emotions <br>  Writing down your emotions in a diary/journal <br>  Writing songs/poetry <br>  Call a friend <br>  After a day or so, analyse what you have done. Try to determine how you felt, and what you can do to reduce or stop these emotions, or work around them. <br>  <br>            Distract yourself. Some people feel that rather than analysing their emotions, they feel better when they get rid of them or forget them completely. When you feel the urge to cut, try distracting yourself by trying out the following: <br>  Drink a glass of water <br>  Watch TV <br>  Do some form of exercise-run, walk, ride your bike, or just dance like crazy <br>  Take your dog for a walk, or spend so|`|LuNWeewLaa	I understand where you're coming from. There's only so many times that people can ask you "why do you feel that way". But I'd reccomend trying to replace that physical pain with another, like doing crunches, push ups etc. that's what I ended up doing and it helped me the most. But whenever you feel like hurting yourself  just try to ride the wave out, things get better I promise :] I hope you feel better|`|QtYo0E0Iaa	From my heart, I would want to give you advise. But I am almost, not completely, at a loss.  Here's a tip: When I was a teenager, I had some compulsions that would rule over me.  In order to stop myself, I would literally dig my fingernails into their palms.  My nails were short of course, it hurt.  But I gradually got over the other compulsion that seemed to make we want to reach out and take what was not mine to take. I then eventually stopped pressing my fingernails into my palms (kept my hands in my pockets a lot).  I then needed to learned to forgive myself as I had yet to learn to forgive others who abused me.  It's a long story.  But please don't cut yourself, just don't.  <br>  <br>  Another thing, you may want to try to challenge yourself at the gym and do weight training (so it hurts) or get involved in building yourself athletically, which is physical and helps with defining your boundaries.<br>  <br>  Give it a try.|`|f6e717954d47e3850c47b18f045c5ae9aa	You can't fake being happy. You either are or aren't. No one is happy all the time.

Injury to yourself is wrong.  This is hard for people to understand, including yourself.  You need a professional to help you  who is trained with this situation.  You must get yourself healthy, love yourself first and foremost and the rest will come, including new friends who love, care, and understand you.  Do things that make you feel good like get a new haircut, go shopping, read, write, find a talent and a hobby, go walking, take a hot bath etc etc.  But most of all VALUE you.  Obviously you need counseling if you cannot get a grip on the reality of what you are really doing to yourself, sorry but that is the truth and sometimes the truth hurts, but it will set you free.  Pray for guidance and pray to God and tell him you need his loving arms wrapped around you to help you through this difficult time.  Have faith and stop hurting yourself and those who love you.

3QIWdvG1aa	Meningitis is an infection of the coverings around the brain and spinal cord.<br>  <br>  The infection occurs most often in children, teens, and young adults. Also at risk are older adults and people who have long-term health problems, such as a weakened immune system.<br>  <br>  There are two main kinds of meningitis:<br>  <br>      * Viral meningitis is fairly common. It usually does not cause serious illness. In severe cases, it can cause prolonged fever and seizures.<br>      * Bacterial meningitis is not as common but is very serious. It needs to be treated right away to prevent brain damage and death.<br>  <br>  The two kinds of meningitis share the same symptoms. It’s very important to see a doctor if you have symptoms, so that he or she can find out which type you have.<br>  What causes meningitis?<br>  <br>  Viral meningitis is caused by viruses. Bacterial meningitis is caused by bacteria.<br>  <br>  Meningitis can also be caused by other organisms and some medicines, but this is rare.<br>  <br>  Meningitis is contagious. The germs that cause it can be passed from one person to another through coughing and sneezing and through close contact.<br>  What are the symptoms?<br>  <br>  The most common symptoms among teens and young adults are:<br>  <br>      * A stiff and painful neck, especially when you try to touch your chin to your chest.<br>      * Fever.<br>      * Headache.<br>      * Vomiting.<br>      * Trouble staying awake.<br>      * Seizures.<br>  <br>  Children, older adults, and people with other medical problems may have different symptoms:<br>  <br>      * Babies may be cranky and refuse to eat. They may have a rash. They may cry when held.<br>      * Young children may act like they have the flu. They may cough or have trouble breathing.<br>      * Older adults and people with other medical problems may have only a slight headache and fever.<br>  <br>  It is very important to see a doctor right away if you or your child has these symptoms. Only a doctor can tell whether they are caused by viral or bacterial meningitis. And bacterial meningitis can be deadly if not treated right away.<br>  How is meningitis diagnosed?<br>  <br>  Your doctor will ask questions about your health, do an exam, and use one or more tests.<br>  <br>  Lumbar puncture is the most important lab test for meningitis. It is also called a spinal tap. A sample of fluid is removed from the spine and tested to see if it contains organisms that cause the illness.<br>  <br>  Your doctor may also order other tests, such as blood tests, a CT scan, or an MRI.<br>  How is it treated?<br>  <br>  Treatment depends on the cause. See your doctor right away if you or your child has symptoms, because bacterial meningitis can be deadly if not treated right away.<br>  <br>  Bacterial meningitis is treated in a hospital. You or your child will get antibiotics. And you will be watched carefully to prevent serious problems such as hearing loss, seizures, or brain damage.<br>  <br>  But viral meningitis is more common, and most people with this form of the illness get better in about 2 weeks. With mild cases, you may only need home treatment. Home treatment includes drinking lots of fluids and taking medicine for fever and pain.<br>  Can meningitis be prevented?<br>  <br>  The best way to protect your child from meningitis is to make sure he or she gets all the standard immunizations for children. These include shots for measles, chickenpox, Haemophilus influenzae type B (Hib) disease, and pneumococcal infection.<br>  <br>  Talk to your doctor about whether you or your child also needs the meningococcal vaccine, which is a shot to prevent bacterial meningitis. It is recommended for:<br>  <br>      * Adolescents ages 11 and 12.<br>      * Teens ages 13 to 18 who haven't had the shot yet. (They should get it as soon as possible.)<br>      * College freshman living in dormitories.<br>      * People who plan to travel to countries known to have meningitis outbreaks.<br>      * People without a spleen.<br>      * People with HIV.<br>  Treatment for meningitis depends on the organism causing the infection, your age, the extent of the infection, and the presence of other medical conditions or complications of meningitis.<br>  <br>  Most people with viral meningitis usually start getting better within 3 days of feeling sick and recover within 2 weeks. However, it is important to see your health professional if symptoms of meningitis develop so that he or she can rule out bacterial meningitis, which is more serious. With mild cases of viral meningitis, you may only need home treatment, including fluids to prevent dehydration and medicine to control pain and fever. If you do not get better or if symptoms get worse, you may need further testing to check for other causes of illness.<br>  <br>  Bacterial or severe viral meningitis may require treatment in a hospital, including:<br>  <br>      * Antibiotics. These medicines usually are given through a vein (intravenously, or IV) to treat meningitis. Antibiotics are given only when bacteria are causing the infection. Giving antibiotics when they are not needed may cause drug resistance.<br>      * Measures to reduce pressure within the brain. If meningitis is causing pr|`|7AfEG5rWaa	Smile on Mighty Jesus<br>  Spinal Meningitis got me down<br>  <br>  I'm feelin' greasy mommy<br>  Please don't let me die<br>  Stinky vaseline mommy!<br>  Please don't let me die<br>  Am I gonna see God, mommy?<br>  Am I gonna die?<br>  It really hurts mommy!<br>  Am I gonna die?<br>  <br>  Smile on mighty Jesus<br>  Spinal Meningitis got me down<br>  Smile on mighty Jesus<br>  Spinal Meningitis got me down|`|6aIuZZi7aa	I'll wager that it's pretty serious, even though I have no idea what it is.
rqwXqmyTaa	If your dr. has said you do have a heart condition ....then yes.  You don't have to experience chest pains to be having a heart attack.  my father's first heart attack was just simple nausia ...shortness of breath and pain in his shoulder.  It would probably be best to call your doctor or go to the ER.  Take an asprin also... if ur not allergic.  It also could be anxiety.....but with your heart condition do not take any chances.|`|fQVM8OHmaa	You could be at risk.  See your doctor about what to do.
vNM21JZnaa	Not likely, they want a full bladder for the ultrasound because it displaces the ovary for better visualization. Physically holding your pee is not damaging to the bladder to make you have to pee more often. <br>  <br>  If you had an ovarian cyst, and it was not cancerous, it was probably not addressed surgically. However, a benign cyst can create problems.  Not like true metastatic cancer can, but if the cyst continuous to grow it can affect the surrounding tissues.  If your cyst wasn't removed last year, it sounds like it has gotten bigger and it is pushing on your bladder. Causing a decrease in the holding capacity of the bladder, therefore making you pee more often. I would go get another ultrasound.<br>  <br>  Not to scare you, but ovarian cancer is very serious and has a high mortality rate because it is usually identified too late to treat.  I would get it evaluated asap.  <br>  <br>  Take Care|`|TwVd0etQaa	I dont think you would have damaged your bladder from just holding in water. When i go for scans i have to drink pints of water before having it and ive personally never had that problem afterwards. It could be that you overstretched your bladder from having the fluid in for so long and because of that its not holding urine as well as it should be because the muscles are relaxed/not tight enough. When going to the loo stop peeing half way through and hold for as long as you can then carry on... this way you can tighten your pelvic muscles and hopefully resovle the problem :)|`|HvbIE03saa	It seems unlikely. <br>  <br>  Chances are you MIGHT have a UTI.

6NZeItMAaa	Our bodies doesn't need saturated fats at all. They need some good fatty acids that you can find in vegetal oil and only 2 spoonful/day<br>  <br>  If you are a typical American, whether you know it or not you consume an unbalanced, obesity-producing diet. People have been urged to "eat the right foods" and to provide plenty of meat, eggs, milk, and cheese for their children. In most areas of the world, this problem of getting enough nourishing food to eat is still of primary importance. <br>  <br>  But it is not the problem in America. Our problem is somewhat the opposite: "living too high on the hog." Our diet is too rich in fat as well as calories, refined sugars, starches, and oils. At the same time, it is low in essential nutriments, minerals and other vital requirements.|`|OMEDzf3maa	Our bodys need alittle fat. But it is better to have less fat then more so it depends on how old you are and how much you weigh.|`|50v3hrp4aa	Please do not listen to the person who goes by "Lsa".  She is obviously not a medical professional and as I looked back at her previous posts, she has posted some very inaccurate and irresponsible information including this one.  You should only listen to physicians or registered dietitians regarding nutrition.  Your body in fact does need fats, both saturated and unsaturated.  These fats are essential to maintain cell and organ health, ensure strong immune systems and for the absorption of several vitamins.  These fats are also very efficient sources of energy.  There are many cultures who derive the majority of their calories from saturated fats.  They have an obesity and cardiac disease rate far lower than the Western world.  Obesity is caused by one simple factor; consumption of too many calories and lack of physical activity.  Its a very simple problem with a very simple solution but some people try to complicate it because its the easy way.|`|qEIeJLtGaa	Yes! Contrary to popular belief, saturated fats are NOT evil! In fact, try going without saturated fat for a few days...you'll feel like crap! I don't think you need to worry so much about the exact grams of saturated fat so much as your total fat intake if you're trying to lose weight. If you're eating a balanced, healthy diet, you'll get all the right amounts of each kind of fat that you need. But I would say that saturated fat should make up around 20-30% of your fat intake- so for someone eating 40g per day, that would be about 8-12g. per day- but needs vary from person to person. Like I said, if you eat correctly, you won't have to worry about it.|`|AA12016863	Yes, fat is essential to a balanced diet, but only a very small quantity, like in the region of immeasurably small, and not because we need to actual fat, but because we need the amino acids that are only found in fats, which help to break down the food we eat into elements the body can use for proper function.

FicyC2TXaa	Hereditary cancer is rare - fewer than 10% of all cases are hereditary<br>  <br>  You don't inherit a general tendency to get cancer, there is no general 'cancer gene'.  A sign that a cancer MAY be hereditary within a family due to a rare inherited faulty gene, is when several members of the same side of the family have had the SAME type of cancer, especially if some have developed it at a younger than usual age.<br>  <br>  You don't say how old your relatives were at diagnosis.  Cancer that is diagnosed after the age of 50 is less likely to be hereditary.<br>  <br>  With at least one in three people diagnosed with cancer at some time in their lives, and with people living longer, it isn't unusual for several people in the same extended family to have non-hereditary cancer. This is the case in my family.<br>  <br>  Both my parents, two of my grandparents, my aunt, my uncle and my young cousin all had cancer, and all but one of them died of it. None of their cancers were hereditary, and no members of my immediate or extended family have ever been considered at increased risk of them.<br>  <br>  Of my parents six children, now aged between 47 and 60, only I have developed cancer, and mine too is non-hereditary and unconnected to theirs.<br>  <br>  So... there is a lot of cancer in my family. But there is no hereditary cancer in my family.<br>  <br>  If all your family members had the same type of  cancer then you may be considered for genetic testing if such a test exists for that type of cancer - not all can be tested for.<br>  <br>  If they all had different types of cancer then you are almost certainly  not at any increased risk|`|vVfH8yBYaa	There are cancer genes, there are also genetic translocations.

My mother was just recently DX with another type of breast cancer.<br>  My mothers ONC wanted her to have the BRAC1 and BRAC2 gene tested to see if she was positive.  She just paid over three thousand dollars for her test but well worth it.<br>  I still go through treatment every three weeks and will continue for many years to come.  My worry was I have a little girl.

Rk46lIBwaa	Rhianna is quite correct as ever the age range set for cervical smears by NHS Scotland is 20 to 60 as distinct from 25 to 65 in England. <br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.healthscotland.com/uploads/documents/CervicalScreenBooklet.pdf" rel="nofollow">http://www.healthscotland.com/uploads/do...</a><br>  <br>  Even then we sometimes got requests from slightly younger women who wished to have a smear performed. There are 4 reasons to perform any test, to exclude a diagnosis, to confirm a diagnosis, to screen and to reassure (patient and/or doctor!) In my view all are valid reasons.<br>  <br>  I also agree that at 23 your daughter should be requesting her own appointments and if she is concerned she should make a GP appointment to discuss HER worries.|`|ZMWjdKfraa	Im from England and had first one at 20 but if your daughter isn't sexually active there really isn't any need.|`|9cba094486c6e7ab49a59ac5ea44682faa	Hi, in the UK smear tests are offered to women once they reach the age of 25 and 20 in Scotland. The reason for this is because the risk of a girl having precancerous cells before ths age is very remote. Obviously this all comes down to costing.<br>  <br>  That said, most GPs will not have a problem giving a women a smear test before this age if she requests one. I'm surprised your surgery refused. I suspect that in the future the age of offering first smears will be lowered to 18 or 20 like it is in Scotland. <br>  <br>  Is your daughter sexually active? if not then the chances of her having cervical cancer are almost unheard of. If she is sexually active then phone the surgery back, ask to speak directly to the Doctor or make an appointment (do not be fobbed off with those receptionists), and tell him your daughter is sexually active and she would like to book a smear test- there is sufficient justification.<br>  <br>  At 23, your daughter really should make an appointment and request one herself. If no luck then I think (i'll check with Dr Frank to be sure) the Family Planning Clinics offer smear testing.|`|YRTNpOO7aa	Get a second opinion,because you can get one done if you are <br>  sexually active or have had a child.<br>  I think that your docs wrong,so tell him that you want a second opinion,then he will do it for you.<br>  I got me first on at 17 and I have on every year,as they found that I had something wrong,I had a operation but all is fine now.<br>  <br>  Good luck,hope you get what you want :)|`|f43be0279e4f60717eb598a32d93faa0aa	Another postcode lottery apparently, some areas can get smears done on the NHS at an earlier age than 25.

yUoa678Gaa	Best advice I can give is to start juicing - as in serious juicing - buying fruits and veggies and concocting juices that you enjoy. Maybe even go on a juice fast for 5 to 10 days. It's healthy and you will drop weight fast. Check the source address if you want some good advice on how to do it, also for good books and juicers. The site is owned by a personal trainer who trained me when I lived in Vancouver, and he turned me on to juicing then. He's a frikin rock star as a trainer, and may even give you some good workout advice if you ask.<br>  <br>  As for dieting, the only diet you should consider is one that has you eating healthy foods only, in small portions, spread evenly throughout the day - which should give you at least 4 to 6 small meals. The fact is that the more times a day you ingest calories, the less your body thinks it needs to store the calories as fat, and thus you start to use your own metabolism to burn fat. And seriously, try juicing. I did it two years ago, fasted and everything. I've never felt better and I dropped almost 30 kilos.|`|YQYMPGK3aa	cereal is good breakfast (whole grain cereal with fruit and skim milk is tops)<br>  <br>  "sometimes"? salads for lunch. salads are very good, but you should have them everyday, also mix ingredients up a bit.<br>  <br>  you should all ways eat dinner. not a huge dinner but you should eat something. small serve of noodles would be good. even better if it had a small amount of skinless chicken breast or something.<br>  <br>  a diet like this is missing out on a lot of nutrients. you should definitely take a multi vitamin, iron tables, omega 3 at the minimum. from what ive gatherd obvious things your missing are protein, calcium, vitamin C.<br>  so try to have a citrus fruit or orange juice daily, also milk for calcium and some protein. chicken/red meat/some beans are high in protein witch you need.<br>  <br>  as far as exercise goes, you should exercise everyday if possible. 30 mins of cardio is perfect if you can manage it. other tips = make sure you drink water and eat some "healthy" snacks during the day, its bad for your metabolism to go more than 3-4 hours without some form of food.|`|myBoF6Dvaa	DIETING NOT ALLOWED!!<br>  Just try eating healthy until you are full--do not overeat.<br>  Then after/before dinner (at least 30mins) take a 15min jog.<br>  It's better than dieting.|`|4BE2ZSdZaa	you need to start eating more protein otherwise your muscles cant repair or strenghten, try chicken you also need to eat 3 times a day as it sounds like you are not eating enough, look up how many calories you should be eating. as for the exercise use a juming rope for 10 minutes or if you dont have one run up and down the stairs for 5 minutes, jogging, swimming, cycling, aerobics and high intensity cardio will also help<br>  hope i helped|`|3ctL64O4aa	You're saying to get fit<br>  <br>  Then Eat a bit more.

On top of that you could try a dance or spinning class or something? Mix it up a bit =]<br>  <br>  This should work but I don't think 2 stone of weight loss will be good for you based on your height.

If you had HIV would you still sleep with someone with out telling them you have it? I don't know one single person that would be happy about their partner having an STD and not informing them before they had sex together, I'm sorry your in the wrong on this one. The right thing to do is tell your partner that you neglected to inform them of this so they can be seen and start treatment before they spread it to others, granted it may not show up on them for years and if they are sexually active they may pass it on to all their partners with out knowing they even have the virus, so please tell whom ever you had sex with so at least they know they have been in contact with it. And from now on inform every potential partner you have that you do have an STD. STD's are nothing to mess around with they should always be taken seriously.

There are a number of other things that can cause the symptoms you are describing and I think it would be worthwhile for you to see your doctor about it to set your mind at rest.  There are many different causes for heavy and painful periods in particular, and your doctor may be able to help this with medication.   Some of your symptoms such as the palpitations and panic attacks may just be anxiety-related and with problems like that, it's usually worth talking to someone such as your GP about it and getting some help.   <br>  <br>  Try not to worry...the chances are, you have nothing to worry about yet in terms of the menopause!|`|MvMMIxjIaa	youre not well really are you?

Dont know if youre on contraceptives but ure Dr may advise something to sort out your periods. You can have a blood test or/and a wrist bone xray to determine your concerns about the menopause. dont sit and worry do something about it.|`|U9R005b1aa	There have been rare cases where a person as young as you has gone thru menopause, but I don't think that is the case here.

I know my daughter-in-law had endometreosis and had several of the same symptoms you are experiencing.  Saddly she had to have a hysterectomy at the age of 26.

cnnu1IFtaa	No, you don't have TSS. But in future remember to change tampons every 8 hours at least or, if you can't remember to do that, use sanitary towels instead.|`|PxJXJKCpaa	If you're a girl who's had her period, you may have heard frightening stories about toxic shock syndrome (TSS), a serious illness originally linked to the use of tampons. But TSS isn't strictly related to tampons. The contraceptive sponge and the diaphragm, two types of birth control methods, have been linked to TSS. And, sometimes, the infection has occurred as a result of wounds or surgery, where the skin has been broken, allowing bacteria to enter.<br>  <br>  Toxic shock syndrome can happen to anyone — men, women, and children. Although it can be serious, it's a very rare illness. If you're concerned about toxic shock syndrome, the smartest thing you can do is to read and learn about it, then take some precautions.<br>  <br>  What Is Toxic Shock Syndrome?<br>  TSS is a systemic illness, which means that it affects the whole body. It can be caused by one of two different types of bacteria, Staphylococcus aureus and Streptococcus pyogenes — although toxic shock that is caused by the Streptococcus bacteria is rarer. These bacteria can produce toxins. In some people whose bodies can't fight these toxins, the immune system reacts. This reaction causes the symptoms associated with TSS.<br>  <br>  When people think of TSS, they often think of tampon use. That's because the earliest cases of the illness, back in the late 1970s, were related to superabsorbent tampons. Research led to better tampons and better habits for using them — such as changing tampons more often. The number of TSS cases dropped dramatically. Today about half of all TSS cases are linked to menstruation.<br>  <br>  Aside from tampon use, TSS has been linked to skin infections that are typically minor and can be associated with the chickenpox rash. TSS has also been reported following surgical procedures, giving birth, and prolonged use of nasal packing for nosebleeds — although all of these are rare.<br>  <br>  What Are the Signs and Symptoms?<br>  Symptoms of TSS occur suddenly. Because it's an illness that is caused by a toxin, many of the body's organ systems are affected. The signs and symptoms of TSS include:<br>  <br>  high fever (greater than 102° Fahrenheit [38.8° Celsius]) <br>  rapid drop in blood pressure (with lightheadedness or fainting) <br>  sunburn-like rash on the entire body <br>  vomiting and diarrhea <br>  severe muscle aches or weakness <br>  bright red coloring of the eyes, throat, and vagina <br>  headache, confusion, disorientation, or seizures <br>  kidney and other organ failure <br>  The average time before symptoms appear for TSS is 2 to 3 days after an infection with Staphylococcus or Streptococcus, although this can vary depending on the cause of the infection.<br>  <br>  Can I Prevent TSS?<br>  The risk of getting TSS is already low. But you can reduce it still further by simply following some common-sense precautions:<br>  <br>  Clean and bandage any skin wounds. <br>  Change bandages regularly, rather than keeping them on for several days. <br>  Check wounds for signs of infection. If a wound gets red, swollen, painful, or tender, or if you develop a fever, call your doctor right away. <br>  If you're a girl whose period has started, the best way to avoid TSS is to use sanitary napkins instead of tampons. <br>  For girls who prefer to use tampons, select the ones with the lowest absorbency that can handle your menstrual flow and change them frequently. You can also alternate the use of tampons with sanitary napkins. <br>  If you've already had an episode of TSS or have been infected with S. aureus, don't use tampons or contraceptive devices that have been associated with TSS (such as diaphragms and contraceptive sponges). <br>  What Do Doctors Do?<br>  TSS is a medical emergency. If you think you or someone you know may have TSS, call a doctor right away. Depending on the symptoms, a doctor may see you in the office or refer you to a hospital emergency department for immediate evaluation and testing.<br>  <br>  If doctors suspect TSS, they will probably start intravenous (IV) fluids and antibiotics as soon as possible. They may take a sample from the suspected site of the infection, such as the skin, nose, or vagina, to check it for TSS. They may also take a blood sample. Other blood tests can help monitor how various organs like the kidneys are working and check for other diseases that may be causing the symptoms.<br>  <br>  Medical staff will remove tampons, contraceptive devices, or wound packing; clean any wounds; and, if there is a pocket of infection (called an abscess), a doctor may need to drain pus from the infected area.<br>  <br>  People with TSS typically need to stay in the hospital, often in the intensive care unit, for several days to closely monitor blood pressure, respiratory status, and to look for signs of other problems, such as organ damage.<br>  <br>  TSS is a very rare illness that's usually not fatal if recognized and treated promptly.

I was absolutely mortified of having an erection.  I was perfectly fine the whole drive out, but once we hit the driveway (It was about a mile), I started having massive anxiety.  It was so bad, to this day I am sure that if I wasn't in good shape, I would have had a stroke or a heart attack.  That was the longest mile of my life.  We get to the top, and there's the owner, in all his glory.  I am having such a hard time with the whole thing.  He points us where to pull the camper, and I park it, only to find we have no power.  Now the owner and myself are trying to figure out why there's no power.  He is buck naked, I am dressed, fixating on that darn outlet, trying to overlook the naked guy next to me.  We get that straightened out and set up the camper.  Now comes the moment of truth.  I was always a swimmer and found it best to jump right in, rather than to wade in slowly, so we stripped down, cracked a beer, and went outside and sat down in front of the camper.  Junior started to make an appearance, much to my chagrin.  But as I sat there, looking around, seeing other people sitting in front of their campers, swimming in the pool, the situation suddenly took on an entirely different context, and Junior lost interest.  That was 6 years ago,  junior hasn't shown any interest in it since.<br>  <br>  So to answer your questions:<br>  <br>  1) Don't worry about it.  Your fears are based on society's propaganda that nudity = sexuality.  Putting yourself into that situation will cure that fast, it's bull.<br>  <br>  2) It's not acceptable, however, it is understandable, especially from first timers.  You'll need to have a towel with you to sit on anyway (Sitting on anything without a towel is a no-no), if it happens just cover up until it goes away, it will)<br>  <br>  Really, the best way to cure that, is to do it.  <br>  <br>  "We have nothing to fear but fear itself"   Franklin D.

It might seem strange but nudist beaches tend to be very unsexual places - they are not full of people 'looking' just people who enjoy the freedom of being naked.

The only thing I would add is (as unlikely as it is) if you are up and walking around and lil matt decides to make an appearance, find a place to sit and cover it with part of your towel, or jump in the pool or lay down on your stomach quickly, because in the US if you are at a family oriented resort, you'll get called down on it if you don't take a seat pretty quickly.  We understand, especially with young men, it can happen, but we expect you to get it out of sight within a reasonable time ... which means pretty quick.  And if children are present, it should be very quick.  <br>  <br>  The other comment about causing it … is right on, you can and should handle whatever you need to in order to put sunscreen where your skin has never seen the sun before, and that includes down and under, but if you appear to be doing more then applying sunscreen, you’ll find yourself at the exit quickly.  You don’t want to find yourself “dna’d” (Do Not Admit)<br>  <br>  But, as others have said, erections at a nudist resort are very, very seldom. Don't worry about it; the nudist population are the nicest, most welcoming and friendliest people you could ever meet.  I’m a marketing consultant for the American Association for Nude Recreation (aanr) and we find this to be the single most asked question by men that are interested in trying nude recreation.  98% of the time you’re lil buddy never comes to attention, and if he does, now you know how to deal with it.<br>  <br>  BTW, make sure the resort you go to is affiliated with either AANR or NTS (The Naturist Society)  They are the two sanctioning associations in the United States that are like the Good Housekeeping Seal of Approval that the club is safe and secure for your family.<br>  <br>  Come on in, the water's fine...|`|jfsJzgs2aa	It doesn't normally happen. When you actually go into a naturist setting you'll see that bodies come in all shapes and sizes and belong to people of different ages and gender.Naturism is not about ogling other people but being yourself and enjoying the sun and fresh air all over your body.<br>  It's not unknown to fall asleep and wake up with a hard on but the best thing then is to be discrete, roll over and let it subside.Do not on any account walk around with a hard on - that is just exhibitionism and is the quickest way to get kicked out of a club. If you visit the web-site of any responsible naturist organisation you will see that this is a FAQ for a lot of men and is dealt with very effectively there. <br>  Try naturism and you'll wonder what all the fuss was about after your first experience.

Change your lifestyle. Have a schedule.|`|ParFJxnSaa	Ask yourself: "Why do I feel depressed, and when did I first start to feel this way: can I associate this with any recent change in my life?" (if so, it is probably reactive [situational] depression: counselling, such as Cognitive Behavioural Therapy may be indicated, but most of life's adverse situations are resolved within 16 weeks, yet the medical criteria for depression, and the prescription of antidepressants is only 2 weeks!). Or, was it a more gradual thing, with no apparent cause? (a nutritional deficiency, hypothyroidism, environmental toxicity, or reactions to some medications, etc., becomes more likely as the cause). Antidepressants work quicker than the following; 2 - 6 weeks, but you may have to adjust dosage, or types. St. John's wort helps most people; tolerance doesn't develop, and the few side effects don't occur often, and even then are normally not severe (neither should be relied on as a sole treatment). <br>  <br>  It doesn't cause sleeping problems, or weight change, but usually takes at least 2, and generally 4 - 6 weeks to become effective, but can work quicker than antidepressants, sometimes. A recent, independent German double blind study showed it to be as effective as a commonly prescribed antidepressant, in cases of major depression, with far fewer side effects, and those were generally better tolerated, with a lower rate of discontinuation. Unlike antidepressants, where sexual dysfunction is a common side effect, it happens much more rarely with St. John's wort (I have noticed no effect in this area). A multidimensional approach to treating depression without medication follows. All except for no. (7.) are safe to use with medication, but not St. John's wort, because of interactions, and it's sensible to check out anything else first with your doctor. <br>  <br>  (1.) Take 4 Omega 3 fish oil supplements, daily: (certified free of mercury) it is best if consumed with an antioxidant, such as an orange, or grapefruit, or their FRESHLY SQUEEZED juice. If vitamin E is added, it should be certified as being 100% from natural sources, or it may be synthetic: avoid it. In the winter months, if not getting sufficient daily exposure to strong light, see <a href="http://www.mercola.com/" rel="nofollow">http://www.mercola.com/</a> SEARCHBAR: enter: "vitamin D3", & Go to a doctor and ask for a 25(OH)D, also called 25-hydroxyvitamin D, blood test. When you get the results, don’t follow the typical “normal” reference range, as these are too low. The OPTIMAL value that you’re looking for is 45-52 ng/ml (115-128 nmol/l)". The company which tests your levels has to be one of those using the correct form of test, and this topic is addressed via the searchbar at mercola.com - "vitamin D3; testing". Also take a vitamin B complex which is certified as being 100% of natural origin; a deficiency in vitamin B9 (folic acid, or folate) is known to cause depression. Around 30% - 40% of depressed people have low vitamin B12 levels. Depressed females using the contraceptive pill may benefit from vitamin B6 supplements. <br>  <br>  (2.) Work up slowly to at least 20 minutes minutes of exercise, daily, or 30 - 60 mns, 5 times weekly. Too much exercise can cause stress, which isn't wanted when dealing with depression. (3.) Occupational therapy (keeping busy allows little time for unproductive introspection, and keeps mental activity out of less desirable areas of the brain). (4.) Use daily, a relaxation method* and/or yoga*, and/or Tai Chi*.(5.) Initially, at least, some form of psychotherapy or counselling; later, perhaps either Cognitive Behavio(u)ral Therapy, or Rational Emotive Behavio(u)ral Therapy for, say, 6 months. (6.) Maintain a mood chart, and daily activities schedule**.  (7.) As options, if desired, either a known, effective herbal remedy, such as St. John's wort, (get a German variety, if possible; local ones may vary in effectiveness. Perika, and Kira brands have been recommended as being effective. Take with a meal) or supplements, such as SAMe, or Inositol (from vitamin and health food stores, some supermarkets, or mail order: view section 55).

Vitamin C works in the body as a scavenger, picking up all sorts of trash-including virus trash. It can shorten the length of a cold from seven days to maybe two or three days. Vitamin C may also cut back on coughing, sneezing, and other symptoms. Short-term use of such high doses shouldnt cause any side effects.

AA11102015	Disadvantages- none.<br>  <br>  Benefits- the baby has little to no natural immunity. In its secretory form, Immunoglobulin A is the main immunoglobulin found in mucous secretions, including colostrum (breast milk). It is also found in small amounts in blood. Because it is resistant to degradation by enzymes, secretory IgA can survive in harsh environments such as the digestive and respiratory tracts, to provide protection against microbes that multiply in body secretions. <br>  <br>  When a baby has not had mother's breast milk, it takes the baby about one month to develop its own immune system. During that month, if the baby gets sick, then some immunity might never develop because the immune system was so overwhelmed by some particular antigen (invading bug) - the immune system can even start thinking that the antigen is a normal thing to have floating around in the bloodstream.<br>  <br>  Colostrum is the first milk your breasts produce in the early days of breastfeeding. Highly concentrated in nutrients, it contains substances that will defend your baby against many harmful agents. The concentration of immune factors is much higher in colostrum than in mature milk.<br>  <br>  Colostrum actually works as a natural and 100% safe vaccine. It contains large quantities of an antibody called secretory immunoglobulin A (IgA) which is a new substance to the newborn. Before your baby was born, he received the benefit of another antibody, called IgG, through your placenta. IgG worked through the baby's circulatory system, but IgA protects the baby in the places most likely to come under attack from germs, namely the mucous membranes in the throat, lungs, and intestines.<br>  <br>  Colostrum has an especially important role to play in the baby's gastrointestinal tract. A newborn's intestines are very permeable. Colostrum seals the holes by "painting" the gastrointestinal tract with a barrier, which mostly prevents foreign substances from penetrating and possibly sensitizing a baby to foods the mother has eaten.

YLMjAlgQaa	Your body mass index suggests you are but BMI's can be inaccurate if you are very muscular as muscle weighs more than fat.  You will need an intake of 1214 calories a day, based on your height and weight, to lose 2lb per week. To lose 1lb a week you should eat 1714 calories. These numbers are based on you doing moderate intensity exercise 3-5 days a week. (obviously you don't have to be exact but aiming at these numbers should help). Aim to eat 5-6 times a day: Breakfast, snack, lunch, snack, dinner. This will help keep your metabolism going and burn fat quicker.<br>  <br>  Exercise ideas:<br>  Join a school sports team- basketball burns many calories.<br>  Running for 30 minutes a day. (you can break these up into 10 minute bursts if you like)<br>  Swimming for an hour once or twice a week.<br>  <br>  Also walk as much as you can. Walk everywhere! You'll be surprised how easy it is.<br>  <br>  Ask your parents to help you with your healthy eating. Cut back on junk food and eat 5 portions of fruit or veg a day. Also DRINK LOADS OF WATER!

However, BMI's are calculated only using weight and height (weight divided by the square of your height) and because muscle weighs more than fat many top athletes come out being classed as obese. In saying that though, your BMI indicates you are not overweight, but if you do want to lose weight or get fit you should join a team. It makes exercising more fun and you meet lots of new people. I'm sure your school will have teams that you can join, otherwise find a local sports club. I played water polo throughout high school and it kept me really fit. If you don't want to join a team just go for walks/runs or swims, get a friend to go along with you and chat while you work out, or join a gym!|`|7IjGzvqTaa	Nope; your BMI is 23.5.

I remember one time my at my friends house I saw some proactive and asked if I could use it.  I had a Rudolph looking nose, man it was big.  All I used was the astringent and it immediately starting to puss out and it wasn't even white headed yet.<br>  <br>  There is another way and it is the way I handle it now.  You kind of have to  make yourself think about germs all the time, not to the point your freaking out or anything.  I mean think about it enough to wash your hands and splash your face when you feel them getting sweaty.

S7Q3fRvoaa	Yes, you are definitely not eating enough.  What you are eating right now is well under 1000, probably in the 700-800 calorie range.  Undereating is bad for your body.  The average person burns about 1200 calories a day just for the body to do normal functions (digestion, heart, brain function).  Since you are not feeding your body enough, it is eating away at your muscle tissue.  Your body will also go into what people call "starvation" or "survival" mode where your metabolism slows down in order to conserve calories.  This is extremely bad because when you eat something, the body will automatically store it as fat as a survival technique.<br>  <br>  So bottom point is, you need to eat more!  Especially since you are 17--teenagers usually require more calories.  But this doesnt mean you should add chips and donuts to your diet.  Add healthy things.  Plenty of fresh fruit and veggies is key.  You also have virtually no protein whatsoever in your diet.  Try adding things like chicken breast  (idk if ur vegetarian), tuna, beans, and cottage cheese.  Whole grains and dairy are also important.  You need to be eating more milk and yogurt so u dont get osteoporosis when ur older!<br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|PKUtKIRfaa	HELL YES!!! you are starving yourself|`|3J9jLcPlaa	Yes! you are starving yourself! At your age you need to be eating atleast 2,000 calories and right now you are probably eating like 500 TOPS.<br>  You need to eat more before you ruine your metabolism!<br>  in order to stay thin but healthy, i know this sounds funny, but you have to eat!<br>  normally you should eat 2,000 - 2400 calories a day no matter what.<br>  if you want to stay thin then eat 2,000 but do not go below that because you are young and still growing!<br>  it is also not healthy to eat the same thing everyday because you cannot get the proper nutrition, so be sure to vary your healthy meals.<br>  make sure you include all food groups. including grains, fats, veggies, fruits, dairy and meats and beans. Each one is a vital part of nutrition.try eating nuts, olive oil, etc. for healthy good fats, and whole grains for your grains.<br>  just eat when your hungry and stop when your full.<br>  or try eating small well balanced meals every 2-3 hours.<br>  but make sure to eat enough or your metabolism will slow down.<br>  eat healthy and regularly and youll be thin.<br>  anything else, you wont.|`|GYJXjMpAaa	although u are now 17 and have stopped growing it doesnt mean u<br>  dont need any energy or proteins. To be honest your not eating enough, <br>  it is very respectably healthy but there is not fats or fruit so therefore<br>  ur 5 a day isnt complete and neither is ur 5-7 food groups.<br>  what I would suggest is keep ur yummy salads but have some small fruits like 7-9 strawberries , plum(s) apricots , kiwis <br>  and for dinner make something light like rice , lasagne with vegetables <br>   which is something light and healthy u cud grate some cheese , melt butter or something like that<br>  seriously if u dont ur bones will go weak and u will lose colour from ur skin <br>  oh and also remember to drink 6-8 glasses of water a day<br>  if u find it hard build up from 3 and every week add 1 glass <br>  :) <br>  hope i helped u|`|4BE2ZSdZaa	i think your eating around 650 calories which yeah is way too little you should be eating at the least 1500 but if your active then 2000 plus. <br>  hope i helped :)|`|PztDZBW1aa	your are definitely not eating enough!!|`|H9J7dCpAaa	Calories is a major topic when it comes to weight loss. We need to learn three things: the amount of calories in our food, the amount of calories a specific physical action uses up every sixty minutes, and last but not least our own personal daily limit of calories.

The more quickly you do it, the more quickly you put it back on. Also, it's not good for you to just 'suddenly' start exercising vigorously. Do it slowly and that way you will be able to keep it up and not put the weight back on.<br>  <br>  The best exercise for burning calories is cardio-aerobic. Jogging, cycling, power-walking, swimming, aerobic dancing or general aerobic workouts. However, strength-training is also important to increase muscle-fat ratio.<br>  <br>  Exercise does burn calories but it takes a while to lose 1 pound of weight!

wwP3ONCFaa	Vicodin is a pain medication and if used in moderation, suppresses pain as it is designed to do. It is addictive in the same manner as heroin. Anything up to a fatal overdose induces a false feeling of pleasure since it stimulates the pain suppressors naturally found in the brain which makes you feel really, really GOOD in spite of the pain from whatever, which is why it is SO addictive. Take too much and it suppresses your nervous system so much you die. Anything less and you just feel really good. As with heroin or cocaine or crack, once you become addicted, you suffer symptoms of withdrawal, which are quite painful and unpleasant in the extreme.
fhYXa38Paa	I don't think that this has anything to do with drinking plenty of fluids. To be on the safe side, you should make an appointment with your regular doctor or the surgeon to ensure that the bleeding is in fact from your urethra rather than just normal vaginal bleeding, which is entirely possible considering the surgery that you just had. If you lose too much blood, that isn't a good thing and can lead to anemia and/or other problems. You should also be checked for any kind of an infection from the surgery just to be on the safe side. <br>  <br>  -- Shane|`|PaZcLiKKaa	It isnt uncommon to have small amounts of bleeding from catheter trauma but yours sounds excessive .

It was bad enough that I had to wear a panty liner. I had no pain or swelling or discomfort--just the bleeding. When they called to check on me three days post-op, I told the nurse about it and she said it's very common, and that it was just irritation from the catheter. It went away in a few days. I was supposed to be pushing fluids, but I was sleeping about 19 hours a day, so there wasn't exactly a lot of time for me to be drinking and going to the bathroom. I just tried to ignore it, and it went away.<br>  <br>  You might give it until Monday and see if it doesn't clear up. If it doesn't, try calling them on Monday morning so they can call you back during the day. That's all I can think of to suggest.

qEIeJLtGaa	Um, wow! That is REALLY good! And by the way, 3 pounds in 2 weeks is excellent. This is what is happening: the weight always comes off really fast at first, and then it starts to slow down as you get closer to your target weight. (Ever hear people say the last 10 pounds is the hardest?) Also what can happen is that if you follow the exact same program for too long your body "gets used to it" and learns to become more "efficient" during the expected workouts thereby burning less calories. Solution? Change it up! Ramp up the intensity and/or change your workout routine all together. Some changes that will kickstart the results again: jog outside instead of riding the stationary bike, or bike outdoors. Change your weight training program- if you're doing light weight and lots of reps, switch to heavier weight and less reps, or do an intense circuit training program. <br>  <br>  By the way, you are not eating enough calories! You will lose muscle at that rate, and starvation makes it easier to regain the weight should you ever deviate from your current program. (It will come back on in the blink of an eye should you ever so much as even smell a piece of cake or a potato chip) Make sure you're eating at least 1-1.25g of protein per pound of LEAN body weight. (that's your total weight minus your fat weight, which is calculated from your body fat percentage)  For your size no less than 160g per day of protein, and that may be too little at that. (The equivalent of about 5-6 chicken breasts). If you have trouble eating enough protein I suggest a whey protein supplement. (sugar-free). But sometimes the metabolism may stall due if the body goes into "starvation mode" and there are not enough calories in the diet so beware of that too.|`|vuo5AaVUaa	it is not necessarily the calorie intake you have to watch just keep a variety of seafood vegetables fruit and meat in your diet and keep your self exercising at least 30mins minimum per day. keep of fast foods and watch out for what you eat also make sure how you exercise is using the muscles were your trying to loose weight from.|`|804cb911d4cc8bd5e313f515a2485812aa	It sounds like you're doing really good.

In most cases the goal is weight loss in those who are overweight or obese, but some athletes aspire to gain weight (usually in the form of muscle) and diets can also be used to maintain a stable body weight.<br>  <br>  Types of dieting<br>  <br>  There are several kinds of diets:<br>  <br>      * Weight-loss diets restrict the intake of specific foods, or food in general, to reduce body weight. What works to reduce body weight for one person will not necessarily work for another, due to metabolic differences and lifestyle factors. Also, for a variety of reasons, most people find it difficult to maintain significant weight loss over time. Among individuals that have lost 10% or more of body weight, only 20% are able to maintain that weight loss for a full year.<br>  <br>      * Athletes participating in professional sports may sometimes undertake weight-gain diets to increase their body mass and gain advantage in their field.<br>  <br>      * Individuals who are underweight, such as those recovering from anorexia nervosa or starvation, may adopt weight-gain diets which, unlike those of athletes, have the goal of restoring normal levels of body fat, muscle, and stores of essential nutrients.<br>  <br>      * Actors, and people participating in similar activities, may pursue weight loss or gain in order to better portray a particular role.<br>  <br>  In children and young adults<br>  <br>  Receiving adequate nutrition through a well-balanced diet is crucial during childhood and adolescence. Some diets can deprive the body of necessary nutrients, for instance lipids. In addition, there are some indications that the harmful effects of starvation or extreme dieting during adolescence exceed the expected benefits, sometimes even leading to increased weight gains.<br>  <br>  Research shows that putting children on starvation or extreme diets can be harmful. The brain is unable to learn how to correlate taste with nutritional value, which is why such children may consistently overeat later in their life despite adequate nutritional intake. <br>  <br>  Thermoregulation<br>  <br>  As endotherms, humans expend energy to maintain our blood temperature at body temperature, which is approximately 37 °C (98.6 °F). This is accomplished by metabolism and blood circulation, by shivering to stay warm, and by sweating to stay cool.<br>  <br>  In addition to thermoregulation, humans expend energy keeping the vital organs (especially the lungs, heart and brain) functioning. Except when sleeping, our skeletal muscles are working, typically to maintain upright posture. The average work done just to stay alive is the basal metabolic rate.<br>  <br>  Physical exercise<br>  <br>  Physical exercise is an important complement to dieting in securing weight loss. Aerobic exercise is also an important part of maintaining normal good health, especially the muscular strength of the heart.<br>  <br>  Though the energy for muscle activity is primarily derived from the glycogen stored in the body, continued activity results in an increased use of the fatty acids as well. After the available glycogen stores are exhausted, fatty acids alone are used . It is often recommended that muscle activity be maintained for 20 minutes or more for increased usage of fatty acids.<br>  <br>  The energy burnt during physical exercise has only a limited effect on weight loss, since an hour of aerobic exercise for a man in reasonable physical shape would burn about 2 megajoules (500 kilocalories), which is equivalent to only 60 grams (2 oz) of fat.<br>  <br>  Both aerobic and anaerobic exercise would increase the basal metabolic rate (BMR) for some time after exercising. This leads to an additional caloric loss.<br>  <br>  Fat loss versus muscle loss<br>  <br>  Weight loss typically involves the loss of fat, water and muscle. Overweight people, or people suffering from obesity, typically aim to reduce the percentage of body fat. Additionally, as muscle tissue is denser than fat, fat loss results in increased loss of body volume compared with muscle loss. To determine the proportion of weight loss that is due to decreased fat tissue, various methods of measuring body fat percentage have been developed.<br>  <br>  Muscle loss during weight loss can be restricted by regularly lifting weights (or doing push-ups and other strength-oriented calisthenics) and by maintaining sufficient protein intake. Those on low-carbohydrate diets, and those doing particularly strenuous exercise, may wish to increase their protein intake. According to the National Academy of Sciences, the Dietary Reference Intake for protein is "0.8 grams per kilogram of body weight for adults."<br>  <br>  Excessive protein intake, may cause liver and kidney problems and may be a risk factor for heart disease.. There is no conclusive evidence that moderately high protein diets in healthy individuals are dangerous, it has only been shown that these diets are dangerous in individuals who already have kidney and liver problems.<br>  <br>  Energy obtained from food<br>  <br>  Th
PqQurpMfaa	First and foremost, you have to find someone you trust.  Someone who comes recommended from several people, not just one person.  I hate going to the dentist also.  I believe that most are in it for the money, not to help someone.  <br>  <br>  I have panic attacks every time I go to the dentist.  Which is for 3 different occasions in the last 24 years.  I don't understand why I do, <br>  I think it's due to the fact that I've had so many bad experiences with both dentists and doctors in my lifetime so far.<br>  <br>  They can prescribe you medication to help with the anxiety before you go in.  But just find someone you trust, and that should help with it.<br>  Good luck!!|`|AA11066099	If it gets you down that much you should just go.The Dentist does not hurt.x|`|ABtqc2WPaa	yes...true.|`|xIj4HHesaa	i can understand your fear.<br>  <br>  ask yourself this.. are you scared of going to see the doctor? <br>  if not, then why should the dentist be any different? you know what you are going to see the dentist for but the doctor is a completely different story. you know you are going to get veneers in at the dentist but when you go to the doctor you dont know what the hell you are going for. also, these guys have been trained for what? 5 years plus all their experience. they are experts. try to put yourself in that frame of mind when you go but dont get scared of the doctor now lol. just remember they know what they are doing.|`|8ChAefLOaa	me too but i aint got ￡￡￡
QYC6n7pLaa	no, its not normal to not poop after 3 days.<br>  ask your doctor for more info, usually people empty the load every morning which is fine because it takes your body 48 hours to fully digest.|`|XinTNCJUaa	I think your best option is to ask advice from your GP or even the pharmacist at your local chemist shop as it is the week-end.|`|mNJFttV6aa	I would look more seriously at your diet.  Eat more roughage, salads, grains, beans.  They tend to be like a freight train through your system.  You should also consume a lot of water, often the lack of water is the cause for constipation.|`|2OQuDVYvaa	A few days would not be unheard of; but, four days seems a bit long.  Take a stool softener (generics work as well as the brand names).  Increase your exercise like brisk walking, running or bike ridding.  It could be the fiber is the problem.  Remember enough is enough but too much is decidedly more than is sufficient.  Too much fiber will actually clog the tract.  If that's the case you may need (or want) to repeat the enema.
8jBGhsWPaa	There is always a possibilty she could be pregnant, no form of contraceptive is 100% effective and if you was careless and put it on wrong its even less effective. If your girlfriend has been through any form of stress lately this could make her periods late so make her feel as relaxed as possible. If you're worried that she could be pregnant take her to a pharmacy to buy a pregnancy test.|`|T0pkW783aa	It is possible that she could be pregnant but if you used a condom every time and appropriately, it is less likely that she is.

Fit17SnVaa	Well when I was younger I had a girlfriend that had irregular periods after we started having sex (probably not the cause) . I drove myself nuts every month worrying that she was pregnant. That went on for 3 yrs and I drove myself batty. If you use precautions you should be alright. But remember condoms are not fool proof. Eating and tired after 3 weeks wouldn't mean too much shes probably worried and some people eat when their anxious. I would try not to worry too much. Good luck and remember to always use protection.|`|CHCPnvksaa	If you're worried get her a pregnancy test. Eating, being tired, and a late period is also a sign of stress.

Bgzq0K1Iaa	I was later than that the month I was due after my first time. I think I was a whole week late.<br>  The appetite and tiredness can be symptoms of being due on.<br>  If you've always used condoms then don't worry yet.<br>  If she hasn't come on in a couple of days, get her a pregnancy test.<br>  Don't panic yet.<br>  <br>  PS. Was it really necessary to ask 3 times?|`|ecfdaa0025f15f95c0f55c59a87b000aaa	You should wait for a week and then get a proper test. If she is pregnant then you should, together, decide on what course you will take. Terminate or go through with it. At this point both sets of parents should be told if the test is Positive. If negative then think of this as a wake up call for your actions and maybe either not have sex again or she should go on to the pill. You should consider that at 16 this girl is unlikely to be the girl that you will share your life with when you are older and more responsible.
WA9Y8QAEaa	well, get a pregnancy test just to be sure :)<br>  good luck :D
WzKrZoHQaa	For heavens sake !!  What kind of Q is this.  Surely not a serious one ?  No a Tapeworm would make you extremely ill - they actually hook onto the inside of the intestine with nasty barbs and sit there and absorb all the nutrients your body intakes via food or liquid.  You would be seriously ill.<br>  <br>  The only way to lose weight - is to do the portion control option.  NO JOKE - just open up yr 2 palms and put them together - this is the actual size of yr stomach muscle.  This is a medical FACT not some stupid diet guru throw away line.   Now so long as you eat that amount of food 3 or 4 times per day you WILL Lose weight naturally.   We think our stomachs are bigger becuase we have overeaten for so long that we think it is this great bulge in front of us that needs filling - Er NO that is the podge from all the excess overeating that has turned to fat.  Yr own personal stomach size is very small.  If you don't believe me check out the link below - this is the size of a normal stomach.  Just use yr palms as yr guide and drink glasses of water in between as this is a good conductor of energy too - electricity (the ability to do work) loves water.   Forget the Tapeworms !!!!!|`|en9Xk0h2aa	Don't be so damn stupid! You really want to risk becoming seriously ill to lose some weight???<br>  <br>  Just eat healthier and excercise more!|`|8mFvaWeBaa	You have to remember that a tapeworm is a parasite, and can cause you to depreciate in weight vastly. It's never a good idea because you can become very ill, and some of the results from having this parasite, can be quite awful and embarrassing. <br>  <br>  If you would like to lose weight, it's a good idea to do it by changing your eating habits, it's the safest way to do it, and you will build your immune system. <br>  <br>  To answer your question, yes you would become malnourished, because the tapeworm will be feeding on the food you consume, your fat and your muscles. You will also become increasingly fatigued.<br>  <br>  Make sure you choose wisely. <br>  <br>  Good luck!<br>  <br>  Bryony|`|qEIeJLtGaa	Tape worms are nasty things that are hard to get rid of. This is because they can imbed themselves in other areas of the body, because unlike roundworms, tapeworms enter the bloodstream. If left untreated, a tapeworm infection can cause blindness due to accumulation of the parasites around the nerve endings of the eyes. Tape worm infections causes vomiting, bloody diarrhea, weakness, and other symptoms. Not a good way to lose weight!|`|uTKCjmKgaa	ummm where would you even find a tapeworm to swallow it??<br>  <br>  this is one of the craziest questions ive ever read. sheesh.<br>  <br>  and no you would become ill, its a parasite, parasites make people ill, and they can do some seriously messed up stuff to your body.<br>  <br>  if you want to lose weight PLEASE go about it in a normal way.|`|7060eafce3928f5687a405e1d56fae80aa	WOW!!!!!!  what a crazy idea.<br>  You really want to put yourself at risk yukkk
vQuoI4VJaa	Yes a lot of people masturbate including me. my favorite way is if you have a removable shower head, put it on a hard adjustment level and let the water hit your clitoris. don't let it go into your vagina though. also if you don't have a shower head like that, run a warm bath and while the water is still running, spread your legs and put your vagina under the running water. And, while you are laying in your bed or on the couch (WASH YOUR HANDS VERY GOOD), spread your legs out as wide as you can get them and finger yourself. as you finger around and find something you like, rub your nipples and try to orgasm. another is to go to get to chairs, tie a string from the back of one chair to another at crotch height. then step over it and walk back  and forth while pressing your vagina into the string until you orgasm. when you feel that you are about to orgasm, stop and just move your hips hard like you are humping the string. whether you have your period or not doesn't matter. :)<br>  Good Luck And Have Fun :)|`|5oBjmeJMaa	almost everyone masturbates it's healthy but if you get ADDICTED to it, there you find a problem|`|Xr8yw4ztaa	..did you ever use a pillow.. fold it...

qEIeJLtGaa	Well, I can tell you from experience that if you hurt your wrist, the only way it will get better is if you rest it. (no bag work for a while) Otherwise, it will always be a nagging problem or it may get worse.<br>  <br>  To strengthen your wrists, you want to work your "grip" muscles (forearm muscles). You can buy those squeezy grip exercisers or do wrist curls, but I can tell you from 10 years of experience the best way to have a strong grip is to do weighted pull ups and heavy dead lifts. For the weighted pull ups, you can strap weight to yourself or hold a dumbbell between your feet. I'm a woman, and I have a stronger grip than many guys! Not only will you improve your strength overall (the pull ups will shred your upper body), but these exercises are phenomenal for building grip strength. I also like to grab very heavy dumbbells at the gym- like, 80's or 90's, and walk around all over the place holding them until my grip gives out. (I usually do this at the end of my workout when my grip is already tired) <br>  <br>  Another method employed my martial artists is to to push ups on your fists or finger tips. However, I'm still standing by the deadlifts and the weighted pull ups.

You're going to do some damage to yourself.|`|ZbMLigR3aa	Hon, you are playing russian roulette here and you know it.  Why would you do this to your body?  Why boast about it?  It really isn't something to be proud of.  Responsibility is part of being an adult, if you are old enough to have sex, you are old enough to figure out how to properly protect yourself.  Since you are against the use of condoms, you can use a female contraceptive such as norplant or one of the many other birth control pills or devices that are available.  Everyone is different so speak with your gynecologist before something bad happens.  You cannot rely on plan b or any other morning after pill as a permanent method of bc, it messes your body up royally.  Good luck.|`|za9b8cHKaa	Either you are a troll or you are completely insane. First and foremost, the pull out method is not at all reliable for preventing pregnancy or STIs. Second, this guy has no respect for you - if he refuses to wear a condom now, what do you think the likelyhood is of him still being around to support you if you get pregnant or an STI? You do not know for certain that he is not clear of STIs, no matter what he tells you. If you want to keep sleeping with this guy (which I really do not advise) then you are going to have to take responsibility and start bring the condoms. A man will not lose an erection because he has to put on a condom - if this was true, the makers of condoms would have gone bankrupt years ago. If he refuses to wear one well ... tell him there will be no sex for him.|`|e25149c4b92661e23727bb5ebba001f7aa	they have that gel that you inject into yourself before sex, it kills sperm.  It comes in an applicator like a tampon and you just push it up there, wait ten minutes I think..... then you can have sex.  It's only 90% effective, my friend got pregnant on it, it's better than using nothing though.  Look for it by the condoms.<br>  <br>  I also agree with the person above me, I am in no way condoning this... I was going to answer your question without the lecture... but i agree with her.|`|7gfNIajYaa	The dont have sex with him..it'l be your own fault if you catch something or get pregnant.Plain and simple.<br>  If he is too much of a ***** not to wear a condom,what makes you think he'l stick around if you get pregnant???He simply doesnt give a crap.<br>  Bang buds,geez you have some ammount of respect for yourself.

As far as remembering things as a child, Piaget, the famed child psychologist, said we remember things when we start getting language.

All that with all your heart... He will  give you new life. <br>  i'm talking about salvation not about religion etc|`|RPd66ldYaa	I agree with a few other people's answers. The only True Solution and Answer (even if it makes no sense right now) is to call on JESUS. When I was a child I was living in an extremely abusive household - where I was totally neglected. God LOVES and cares for children deeply - and when you feel most overwhelmed, lost or alone - God is even closer than you think or know. One day, even though I was not brought up in church - I prayed for help. I even said "Jesus please help me," and in that instant my life was changed. Jesus was there and began to change my life from that time forward. It has never been the same. It was the only answer to my confusion, guilt and loneliness of living with the abusive family. So it is my only advice to you - just pray - just give it to God. Take care of yourself and I am sorry for what you went through. You will work through it.|`|fZ3FXZMyaa	Yes you do need some help, but let me say 4 words to you, ITS NOT YOUR FAULT.  Your counselor is right.  You have this "obssesion" with being an infant, like you want to stay a baby forever.  It is a need you have to act infantile, the love and stablitiy that was never instilled in you by your parents.  Being sexually abused most of your life, is horrifiying.  And you feel ashamed.  You have an oral ficisation, sucking on bottles and pacifiers because of a need to take things in.  Having an eating disorder is one of many things you could have it does not surprise me.  It saddens me.  Yet it goes along with having a bad self-image and not loving your-self.  You should stick with your counselor, you may not want to but my advise to you is to keep going. You are young enough were the damage that has been done to you can be healed.  It is not magic threrapy is hard work but I have faith in you.  You can save yourself from the depths of your hell and rise above the pain and hurt.  And find you in all of the mess that was not your fault.|`|gEd09OVGaa	Julianna,<br>  I went through this too. Jesus can heal all these wounds when you are ready and He won't rush you!<br>  <br>  Your therapist sounds like a quack to me, since she didn't bother to call when you needed her. <br>  <br>  Eating isn't wrong. Not eating doesn't have to be. Eat when you're hungry, and only until you're satisfied, you'll stay at the perfect weight. I now weigh about 135 -140 lbs, but ten years ago I weighed 298 lbs! I wouldn't go under the knife, so it's taken ten years! Big deal! I knew I was going to be ten years older some day, God willing, and I decided that I'd rather be ten years older and healthier than I was, so I just kept trying. I fall off the wagon all the time too! I still eat chocolate bars and chips, I just don't go crazy with them. It started out really hard, because diet is only die with a "T"! LOL! It's not wrong to eat those things, it's all in how much you eat them. I still munch french fries, burgers and dogs, all that stuff. Don't count calories! Don't keep weighing yourself! You'll just give up when you don't see a change in the numbers or if the change wasn't good enough. Muscle is heavier than fat, but you need some fat on you to stay alive. Women are also built differently then men. We're supposed to have more fat and less muscle, it's our genetics. It's all about when we have babies of our own.<br>  <br>  You are a gift to your grandparents and you are a gift to others! You will survive, and yes, time does heal those wounds. I am 41 now but I was in my early teens when it happened to me. <br>  <br>  You aren't just hurting from this, you were robbed of your childhood altogether, I was robbed of my teens.  Jesus can give it back to you! I know that first hand! He gave me back my tomorrows after I threw them all away!<br>  <br>  When people like us are going through the memories, trying to come to terms with what has happened, knowing we can't change the past, some of us turn to very bad ways of living, like drugs, sex, alcohol, and the like, and I did.  Others of us try to punish ourselves, feeling like it was somehow our own fault - and it's not - but what I'm getting at is this... In the future, as you grow and mature and become a woman, you will find the transition difficult because of how you are treating yourself now - as a baby - that doesn't mean it's wrong, or bad, it means you will make your own maturity harder on yourself. <br>  <br>  There are people all over this planet who will take advantage of that in many different ways - they will study your weaknesses and try to use you as a stepping stone to the top of where ever it is they think they're going. They will try to make you a target!<br>  <br>  You are not a target! Stay strong and stay on the good path, look for Jesus when your heart feels broken, He won't let you down! I never knew that people would take advantage of the very wounds that were ripping me apart, but you now have a head's up!<br>  <br>  You go girl! You have what it takes to survive! You've found an avenue, other than one that is life destroying, in which to begin to deal with that pain, so you just keep on keeping on and you're going to be just fine!<br>  <br>  Love in Christ<br>  Annie C<br>  Canada|`|db440e48d3204833c920aa88aab4ed5daa	Look sweetie we today all have some serious issues and I know how you feel  I to was raped by family members at a early age .But it is getting time you let the past be just what it is and make a good happy life for your self and know the bad people are out of your life now .<br>    I would start by getting ride of one at a time until you are past the need for these things .<br>  <br>  I know how scared you may feel but you want to live a good long life and just know the people that hurt you God will make them pay in a serious way .<br>   This was not at all your fault and you can put this behind you only if you try .<br>  <br>  Talk to Jesus and let it go and you want to force your self to eat you I am sure are very pretty and you will have a great life but it is time now to start <br>   My suggestion are eat chicken noodle soup daily even if you don;t want to eat and start putting each of your things in a box for a keep sake .I wish you the very best of luck always ,|`|pZ9eA5rYaa	Do you actually remember being abused or is that just her interpolation of your problem. If you can't remember it she is probably a quack. It might not hurt to also try another therapist.|`|QtYo0E0Iaa	If you were seriously abused as a child, you most likely have boundary issues in your relationships and within yourself.  Your difficulties with boundaries will cause you to have problems with school and work and having friends.  You will have trouble interpreting other people's "signals".  <br>  <br>  You will probably need to do some hard work in order to gain a new sense of security as your move around in the real world.  What you are doing is "prepping" yourself for a past, abusive world that is no longer there for you.   It is kinda two-sided, but you need to "think out of the box" once in a while.  Find other activities to do that will make productive use of your time - so that you can better manage what you are doing when you don't know what else to do.  You will have to teach yourself to eat again.  Work out and really build muscle.<br>  <br>  Take care of yourself as if you were the most valuable thing in this universe!

F8Ac1pPNaa	Well, moderation and throwing out all the junk food/drinks will not only keep you healthy but save a lot of money.<br>  <br>  See the article below on healthy eating.<br>  <br>  And good luck to you.
KAnEq8Laaa	Um, define huge. Are we talking, they are disproportionately large for your frame, or are they actually just flabby, and you need to do a little exercise and tone them up? I suspect the latter, rather than the former, is the truer statement. As women, we look at the least ounce of wobbly skin on our bodies, and go, FAT!! And frequently the answer to that is, No, just start exercising.<br>  <br>  I think you'd be happier if you skipped the weight loss idea, and just went for fitness, actually.<br>  <br>  You can't lose weight just in your thighs. That doesn't happen. You will lose weight all over, and you haven't got enough weight on you to afford losing 10 pounds. You see, according to my handy BMI calculator, your BMI is 21, which is just on this side of ideal. If you lose 10 pounds, your BMI will be 19, which is just a hair over underweight. In any case, the 1200 calories-or-so diet you're describing is actually too stingy for someone your height, weight, and age. You'd probably lose a couple pounds pretty quickly the first week, but then since your BMR is about 1359, your weight loss would slow or stop. Although, I am quick to point out, 1200 calories is not exactly starvation, but it's still really not enough for someone as young as you are who wants to lose a couple pounds. When you're younger, you burn off a lot more calories. Just to maintain your weight, you need nearly 1900 calories at your age/size. So if you want to do the meal plan you have described, go ahead, I guess, but it IS a little boring. Why not have milk with the Special K? Skim milk is only about 90 calories per cup. A serving size of cereal takes 1/2 a cup of milk. You can afford 45 calories. And a couple snacks, too.<br>  <br>  As far as the exercise is concerned, I think you're on the right track with the walking daily, and swimming is absolutely great exercise. Swimming for an hour can tone your entire body. Squats, stretches, and so on are fine for exercise, just so long as you include your cardio every day to get your heart rate up, and understand that there's no such thing as spot-reducing. Exercise should be incorporated into ANY healthy lifestyle, and this plan is not bad for starters. Walking is so good for you. <br>  <br>  So my snap analysis: don't bother with the diet. Walk! Swim! Tone up! Don't lose any weight! You're small to begin with. If you exercise, you don't need to cut any calories at all (unless you're eating 3000 a day, which I doubt) and you'll see results and be able to stop saying Eurrgh! without having to choke down bowls of dry cereal. Good luck!|`|JQKADWyzaa	This is a very reasonable diet, however your calories seem a little low so you might want to incorporate a low-cal snack.<br>  your exercise is very very good, but! my thighs never looked better than when i started running, they get muscular tight and smaller.<br>  Don't get obsessed, don't get downhearted if you mess up one day, it happens.<br>  Good Luck!|`|rX81HPNwaa	You'd lose some weight, not 10lb though|`|AA11447210	First off, you can't spot lose weight. If you are exercising you have no control over where the fat/weight comes off. You aren't guaranteed to get thinner thighs, just thinner. If you are already at a healthy weight, don't drop 10 lbs in an attempt to do something that can't be done.<br>  <br>  You can tone specific areas of your body, but you can't slim them down (sorry).<br>  <br>  Your eating plan should not be under 1200 cals a day and should consist of 4 - 6 small meals a day (the more often you eat, the better).|`|kiKB7tdaaa	If you lost 10lb you'd be underweight. Your thighs cannot be huge at that weight. Perhaps that's where you carry all your fat, but even if that's the case, I'm sure everyone else who sees you thinks your thighs look normal or even skinny. Just eat healthy and exercise, don't try to diet or restrict food, thats just unhealthy and might make you gain weight in the end.

GLOBmh0Baa	YOU CANNOT LIVE ON ONLY 3 APPLES AND 3 ORANGES IN ONE DAY! Honestly, trust me... your body needs 2000 calories in one day, only to survive! You are only eating about 100 calories per day... that is so unhealthy, if 'the person' is you.... PLEASE STOP THIS DIET! You will become so thin you could become anorexic, and even die.<br>  <br>  Here are some tips if you really want to lose weight:<br>  BUT YOU MUST EAT 2000 CALORIES PER DAY TO LIVE!!<br>  <br>  <br>  As I am sure you know already, cut down on all fatty foods, drink 8 glasses of water per day, eat 5 fruit/veg per day and choose low fat options.<br>  <br>  You could try joining a club such as weight watchers as this will give you lots of diet plans and help you to stay motivated.<br>  <br>  Exercise :<br>  <br>  You should 'exercise' for a full twenty minutes at a time, five days per week to stay at a healthy weight.<br>  <br>  Remember, don't over-do it and certainly don't try to lose weight too quickly. The more quickly you do it, the more quickly you put it back on. Also, it's not good for you to just 'suddenly' start exercising vigorously. Do it slowly and that way you will be able to keep it up and not put the weight back on.<br>  <br>  The best exercise for burning calories is cardio-aerobic. Jogging, cycling, power-walking, swimming, aerobic dancing or general aerobic workouts. However, strength-training is also important to increase muscle-fat ratio.<br>  <br>  Exercise does burn calories but it takes a while to lose 1 pound of weight! However, exercise is essential to maintain weight loss and maintain your body at peak efficiency.<br>  <br>  Thought you might find this useful:<br>  <br>  Type of Exercise - Calories/hour <br>  <br>  Sleeping 55 <br>  Eating 85 <br>  Sewing 85 <br>  Knitting 85 <br>  Sitting 85 <br>  Standing 100 <br>  Driving 110 <br>  Office Work 140 <br>  Housework, moderate 160+ <br>  Golf, with trolley 180 <br>  Golf, without trolley 240 <br>  Gardening, planting 250 <br>  Dancing, ballroom 260 <br>  Walking, 3mph 280 <br>  Table Tennis 290 <br>  Gardening, hoeing etc. 350 <br>  Tennis 350+ <br>  Water Aerobics 400 <br>  Skating/blading 420+ <br>  Dancing, aerobic 420+ <br>  Aerobics 450+ <br>  Bicycling, moderate 450+ <br>  Jogging, 5mph 500 <br>  Gardening, digging 500 <br>  Swimming, active 500+ <br>  Cross country ski machine 500+ <br>  Hiking 500+ <br>  Step Aerobics 550+ <br>  Rowing 550+ <br>  Power Walking 600+ <br>  Cycling, studio 650 <br>  Squash 650+ <br>  Skipping with rope 700+ <br>  Running 700+
G9liglrwaa	IT'S SUPPOSE TO BE VERY RELIABLE ,BUT IT'S NOT ALWAYS 100%... IT'S JUST A HIGH DOSE OF BIRTH CONTROL...I KNOW OF PEOPLE GETTING PREGGO ON BC..JUST GO TO THE DOCTOR AND GET A BLOOD TEST|`|tFAKwsv6aa	I would NEVER take such a pill and I advise you to use birth control besides the abortion pill doesn't block HIV!!!<br>  <br>  lil bowe is ignorant. I stated that I would never use the abortion pill but never told her that birth control pills prevent HIV. Lock up the legs loose ladies! And explain to me lil bowe why women get the morning after pill as you like to call it when they have unprotected sex and fear pregnancy????|`|YHmr7nvsaa	Yes.|`|HvbIE03saa	Well it depends on how soon you took it after sex.<br>  <br>  The morning after pill is only effective within (I believe) 72 hours of unprotected intercourse. But, like everything other than abstinence, it isn't 100% effective so it could go both ways.<br>  <br>  Grapes - get off your high horse. Calling the "Morning after pill" an abortion pill is ignorant. All it does is prevent pregnancy in the SAME way that birth control does, it's just essentially a higher dose. And birth control doesn't block HIV either.|`|bfNDLbVqaa	Yes, because the morning after pill is designed for having to work within 24 or maximum 48 hours after intercourse. That means that taking it on time is so crucial that it wouldn't be of any use if it hard to work from Tuesday all the way to Friday.|`|7KxJ7DgLaa	yes,it will work.

Hope it works and the nose bleeds stop. or just tell him to stop picking :L|`|YHmr7nvsaa	One possible reason is a dry house, you may need more humidity.|`|wwP3ONCFaa	You've packed your nose with cotton, applied pressure, and waited the alloted time. But your still bleeding. What do you do next? Go to an emergency room or head straight to your doctor's office. Nosebleeds can kill you if they go on long enough. In rare instances, continous bleeding indicates the presence of a tumor. <br>  <br>  Here are some tips to stop the flow:<br>  Take Iron. If your'e child is prone to nosebleeds, consider iron supplements to help his body rapidly replace the blood supply. Iron Is a vital component of hemoglobin, a key substance in red blood Cells.<br>  <br>  Pinch the fleshy part of your nose. As soon as you've blown his nose and packed it with cotton or gauze, use your thumb and forefinger to squeeze shut the soft part of his nose. Apply Continous pressure for 5 to 7 minuntes. If the bleeding doesnt stop, apply fresh packing and pinch again for another 5-7 minutes. The bleeding should stop by the time you're through.<br>   Leave the cotton in another 20 minutes before you take it out.|`|LDVBKMiSaa	Omg i am in the same boat as your son! Im 14 and i have been having random nosebleeds night and day as long as i can remember. Im not some fat unhealthy person either, i have healthy food and swim and play football for teams.<br>  Anyway i have heard that it is because we have sensitive veins in our nose and it can run through the family...<br>  Its probably pollen since im starting to get a bit of hayfever now :S
ELlgTuEyaa	Well if you are coughing up brown phlegm, do you also have a fever or aches and pains? If the problem persists, you might want to see a doctor because it seems like signs of broncitius or pneumonia.|`|831e735ba92bb0dfd3b16be0d4995ccfaa	I would be looking at an upper respiratory infection.|`|f8mLpPXlaa	Does this happen only in the morning or during the day too? If it's just in the AM you might want to invest in a room humidifier. They're cheap and effective. What's probably happening is you mouth breath when you sleep and the mucous membranes dry up and crack causing a little bleeding which mixes with the mucous being produced in an attempt to keep the membranes moist. This will give you the brown coloration. Try the humidifier but make sure you keep it clean. Change the water every other day and give the reservoir and good cleaning.<br>  If this doesn't help you may want to see your doctor to make sure nothing else is going on to cause the bleeding.<br>  God bless.|`|RwY2Eu7Raa	Your condition can be very well cured by a homeopathic physician.  It may be due to the infection of the respiratory tract.  By narrating your symptoms like dry mouth, bad taste etc, the physician may select a right remedy for you and you will get cured in about 3 weeks time.  Best of luck.
JArE2DGuaa	Anyone can do ti because it doesn't involve penetration ;) :)|`|VvNKTFhJaa	Dry sex can be had at any age. Only penetration is not allowed.

CuX4Q4xTaa	Dear TJ<br>  <br>  You have received some real kind words of support from other users who have answered before me. I just want to add that despite your intense traumas, losing the support of your counselors all at once is an outrage. From my experience, clinics are like this. They dont care as much for the individual as a private Dr. would. I understand your means, however there are wonderful private Drs. that can work with you on a sliding scale. If you feel you are not getting the help you need.. its time to move on; as painful as that may be. You cant afford to be and shouldnt be let down by counselors or therapists, for that will only make you feel worse and that all hope is lost. Your feelings of despair are totally normal despite all you have been through. You need a solid support system; who you see on a weekly basis or even twice a week. I feel you have been abandoned by the system and your entitled to feel as you do. It is so understandable and entirely normal for you to feel worse and alone, but you may not see that as as youre the one in the position.  As you know I am your best friend and am always hear for you to vent and express your feeling during this intermission of support and beyond then.  I know you already know that all you feel is normal and expected. Your traumas and the feelings behind them are real. Do not put yourself down for feeling as you do..anyone would feel the same. I hope you current counselor returns soon, so you feel like you have her support as you once did. But when help is not being given and youre in the same spot for so long..its time for a change. You need someone who can help you and be there..always. You will eventually get through this. You are an extremely strong person. You are so lovely and good-hearted and deserve nothing but the best. <br>  Love you girl Huge Hugs. <br>  Brooklynn|`|HLmryKhSaa	Hi,this may not sound like good advice but talking a walk is a start...<br>  I too have felt overwhelmed when i lost my Mom,Sister,Brother-in-law<br>  with-in a year of each other...My Mom and Sister both had cancer<br>  i took care of them till the day they passed. I could barely breathe<br>  at times from the pain i felt losing them...but i believe we will meet again...the great thing about life is not knowing whats around the corner...I know how hard it is to go out in the world when feeling<br>  like you can't..you can do it!!! You are in my prayers...a friend|`|a20KcBqdaa	first of all, i wanna say that i'm sorry for all that has happened to you. i can see that you havent had much luck recently. my advice would be to talk to a close friend, or a family member - it will make you feel so much better, and they might be able to help you. also, get another trauma therapist. it might be hard for you to go looking for another one - you might feel that your last one was the only one who could have helped you, but there are plenty more just like her. i have also had a rough time, with deaths in the family, and broken relationships, and some scary illnesses, but i am still carrying on in life. dont lose hope, because every cloud has a silver lining. there will always be something good just round the corner, so hold on to the good things in life, the good memories, and life will be just that little bit easier to cope with. one last thing - smile, and laugh out loud. you'd be surprised at the healing powers of a good laugh has. good luck, and keep smiling :)|`|f00589104255977086e57a356d925224aa	Thing do change!

Realise you are human you will get down but it's okay. <br>  <br>  Take things slowly just focus on here today. What can I do and think about now. No point in looking miles ahead. No off us know where/what will happen. We only have now!<br>  <br>  Think of how life is precious. It can be taken away when we least expect. So just enjoy now.

Exercise really helps, just do anything which you think will take your mind off stuff. Trust in God and you will be ok.|`|qGiFTnC2aa	I suffer from PTSD (long story) too, and depression and anxiety.<br>  <br>  The way I try to see things is this.  We have only one life to lead, we can use it or waste it.  It doesn't really matter if we die, the earth still turns without us, but it might matter a lot if we choose to live, make a difference and contribute to the world.  I have been trying to help others, even in tiny ways.  Volunteering, donating money or time, even just helping someone with a lot of parcels or a baby in a stroller get through the door.  I'm doing some good in the world and that makes me and my life worthwhile.<br>  <br>  You really need to secure a new therapy team.  Talk to someone about getting another care worker while yours is recovering.  Start tracking down a new therapist.  <br>  <br>  Also, look for some online grief support groups.  A friend of mine lost her husband suddenly - he died of a seizure in her arms. She has joined an online group and it has helped tremendously. There are also groups that meet in cities and towns.<br>  <br>  There is some info on grief and bereavement here:<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.crusebereavementcare.org.uk/" rel="nofollow">http://www.crusebereavementcare.org.uk/</a><br>  <br>  And some online support groups (US) here:<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.griefnet.org/support/sg2.html#spouse" rel="nofollow">http://www.griefnet.org/support/sg2.html...</a><br>  <br>  Good luck to you.

AA10815212	Having worked in cardiology practices, I know those cardiologists would have weekly conferences - review the angiographs with all of the other cardiologists and the cardiothoracic surgeon and discuss the appropriate route of action, given the patient's medical history.  More thought was given to your case by more people than you probably realize.<br>  <br>  One other note, bypass is not for sissies...it's a very big surgery with a long recovery time (a year in total).  That said, no one recommends it lightly.  It has excellent long term out come data - superior to that any angioplasty and stenting.<br>  <br>  Discuss your reservations with your cardiothoracic surgeon...I am sure her or she will be able to address them.<br>  <br>  Good luck.|`|9cba094486c6e7ab49a59ac5ea44682faa	Angiography will make the arteries clearly visible on x-ray- this will show whether or not an CABG is indicated.

This test will also show any narrowing in the arteries of the heart.<br>  <br>  CABG will only be given if your Dr feels you would respond well to it, he will take into consideration all other factors regarding your heath. If you have concerns, have a chat with your Cardiologist.|`|TORBP6QIaa	Trust your doctor...a bypass is not suggested lightly.  The Angio is the usual procedure done before attempting to fix a blockage.<br>  <br>  A bypass is a big operation but recovery is often surprisingly quick and nowhere near as painful as you imagine it to be.<br>  <br>  You will likely be up walking within 24hrs of surgery and probably go home at around 5-7 days post op.  You will be slower for a few weeks and may tire easily but you should be pretty well all healed by about 6 weeks and driving again etc.|`|DtG4zpM2aa	Angiography is the best test to see if a bypass operation is indicated.  It provides a clear picture of how the blood vessels supplying the heart are looking, and if there are blockages in the arteries, the doctors can see the severity of this and assess what is the best option to treat this and restore optimum blood supply to the heart.   If your doctor has said that bypass surgery is the best treatment for you, he or she will have made this decision based on the very detailed results from your angiography as well as other factors regarding your general health.

qEIeJLtGaa	If you're trying to lose weight, 5 minutes will only work if you run really, really fast and hard...like, sprinting speed...to the point where you are breathing so hard you can't even talk. (Not advisable if you're out of shape) Sprinting, or H.I.I.T. training (high intensity interval training) is a very effective way for those of moderate to advanced fitness levels to burn fat in a very short period of time. For the beginner however, a more moderate pace is suggested due to the extreme intensity of H.I.I.T./sprinting. <br>  <br>  Research shows that it takes around 20 minutes of moderate cardio activity such as jogging non-stop for your body to switch into "fat burning mode". In other words, you need to jog for more than 20 minutes without stopping. If you cannot jog the whole time, you may stop to walk fast but remember the goal is to keep the heart rate constantly elevated so WALK FAST. Initially, you'll want to start out doing 30-45 minutes 4-5 times per week. <br>  <br>  Eventually, when you become more fit, you can do H.I.I.T. to save time and be even more effective. <br>  <br>  And squatting is good for shaping your bum, and if you do enough of them they will help somewhat with burning fat. Actually, if you do a whole-body strength training program with weights and combine that with your cardio, that is the best way to go. And don't forget your diet- diet is #1 when it comes to fat loss.|`|6db0f4a18581920a0595ba65256e51f8aa	YES BUT NOT AS MUCH AS YOU THINK, THE WAY IT WORKS IS YOUR BODY BURNS CALORIES WHICH COME FROM FAT SO THE MORE CALORIES YOU BURN THE MORE FAT YOU BURN, DO SQUATS AND RUNNING BURNS SOME CALORIES BUT FOR 5 MINUTES YOU WONT EVEN BE ABLE TO BREAK 100 CALORIES AND YOU NEED TO BURN 3500 CALORIES TO BURN A POUND OF FAT. DO 30 MINUTES OF CARDIO LOWER FAT AND SIMPLE CARBS (SUGAR) FOR YOUR EATING HABITS AND THAT WILL HELP PREFERABLE WORKOUT 5 TIMES A WEEK AS WELL IF YOU BURN 500 CAL A DAY THATS 3500 A WEEK|`|Uxe1GjP0aa	Yes.

If your sore throat is caused by a viral infection, antibiotics wont help it. But medicated lozenges containing phenol may do some good.

And its mild anesthetic action numbs raw nerve endings so your throat doesn't feel as scratchy. These Lozenges come in various strengths, so follow package directions.|`|L4z1FI5Kaa	For the throat, you can gargle with a saline solution (1 tsp salt to a tumbler of warm water), or TCP diluted 1 part TCP to 3 parts water.

oQkwZhXpaa	Sounds like you had a panic attack.<br>  Don't worry..I had them for years and Its fine..you just have to get yourself under control.<br>  <br>  I know its hard but you need to try and confront your fear..perhaps go into an elevator with someone you trust and go up one floor and then reward yourself and gradually work your way up..avoiding it will just make it worse.<br>  <br>  If you start to feel like that again then you need to remind yourself you are in control, ad that your fear is unfounded. i.e tell yourself people wouldnt use elevators if they were unsafe. Take deep breaths and try to relax your body. Visulaise the air going into your body and hold the breath in for 5 seconds before you let it out. Don't breath fast or hyperventilate you will make yourself feel worse. <br>  <br>  Remind yourself of the biology of it. The only reason you feel like this is because something in your brain has told your body to panic, and you body has released adrenaline to prepare the body for fight and flight, kinda like in prehistoric times lol a caveman would be faced wih a sabre toothed tiger and body would release adrenaline to help the guy run away. The body hasnt changed much over the years so when you feel panicked now the adrenaline the body releases overwhelms you, speeding your heart rate up and making your breathing fast and even making you feel a bit sick. <br>  <br>  Just take deep breaths, try to relax, and tell yourself that its a natural response but you can control it. Try to confront your fear now before it gets out of hand..the sooner you do it the better as you will know for future times there is nothing to be scared of etc..i know thats very hard..i had an immense phobia of sick for years and would have panic attacks so i know how you feel but through doing the above im now fine :)<br>  <br>  Good luck.

My doctor discovered that I had a fairly large fibroid tumor in my uterus, and performed surgery. <br>  <br>  Your problem could be caused by a number of things: hormonal imbalance, endometriosis, cysts, fibroids, or you may just need a different type of BC pill.

Good Luck.|`|TsjqzanQaa	I experienced the same thing for years, and didn't know what was wrong with me.<br>  <br>  Circumcision always destroys sexual sensitivity, and in my case it destroyed more than the usual 50-75%.<br>  <br>  First of all, circumcision amputates the foreskin, with its thousands of nerve endings and nerves are also severed.       Some remaining nerves on the penis are damaged.      Scar tissue is formed.     Veins and capillaries are severed.      The normal blood flow of the penis is permanently disrupted.<br>  <br>  Finally, the exposed glans and surrounding tissues, meant by nature to be covered by the foreskin dry out and keratinize, as they rub against clothing and are permanently exposed.       The keratinization continues throughout the victim's lifetime.        All of these factors combine to reduce sexual sensitivity.      The sensitivity continues to decline, slowly and inexorably and almost imperceptibly.<br>  <br>  I was unable to achieve orgasm in normal sex, but could achieve it through masturbation, as the more direct pressure and stimulation of the hand could achieve the necessary sensation to give me orgasm, but the vaginal walls couldn't provide enough sensation to my damaged penis.<br>  <br>  Being unable to achieve orgasm, my partners felt that they weren't attractive enough or skilled enough sexually, and we both felt inadquate.<br>  <br>  Finally, I found out about foreskin restoration.     This has changed my life completely.       While restoring the foreskin doesn' replace the amputated and damaged nerves and nerve endings, it does dekeratinize the glans and surrounding tissues, and the new inner foreskin is exquisitely sensitive, giving me a new feeling in sexual enjoyment that I never before experienced.<br>  <br>  I use a device called the TLC Tugger, which puts a constant tension on the shaft skin, gradually letting new skin cells fill in to create a new foreskin, which provides glans coverage to restore the sexual sensitivity more like nature intended.<br>  <br>  About 200,000 guys are restoring, as more men finally discover what was done to them, and what they lost when their foreskins were amputated.     Most circumcised guys are unaware of how sex is really supposed to feel with a complete penis, as they don't have anything with which to compare it.<br>  <br>  Almost all circumcised males had it forced on them as infants, very few males ever choose to be circumcised.<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  It's my theory that, once dekeratinized and covered by foreskin, the nerve endings in the tissues compensate for the missing ones, giving me sensitivity close to that of the unmutilated and intact foreskin.<br>  <br>  Uncircumcising myself is the best thing that I've ever done.       Having a foreskin is natural and normal; circumcision is not.<br>  <br>  It's not easy to restore your foreskin, and it takes several years, but it's bring the penis back to the way that nature intended, and feeling and function are vastly improved, together with the intensity of orgasm.<br>  <br>  This is much more common than you would expect, but the adverse effects and complications resulting from circumcision are never disclosed by doctors and are in fact suppressed.<br>  <br>  Circumcision is the worst hoax ever perpetrated on the male sex.<br>  <br>  A foreskin is not a birth defect; it is a birthright.<br>  <br>  ERIC|`|E64juLwJaa	Can you still come when you masturbate ?<br>  Then you are maybe to stressed when you are with her:learn to relax,<br>  Planets.|`|CC6dSdJmaa	Orgasms come from your brain, the more relaxed and horny your thoughts, the easier you will cu*m.<br>  Stress and anxiety, or an unattractive partner, can affect your ability to relax and cu*m. <br>  Financial problems, family problems, work problems, all can affect your peace of mind and make it difficult, don't worry about not coming either, that can make it more difficult!<br>  Chill, relax, don't worry about a thing and you will cu*m normally!|`|3gPLONagaa	Nothing wrong I think<br>  <br>  Use imagination, sometimes porn helps|`|PxJXJKCpaa	You should talk to a doctor about this.

YhB6SPfeaa	I read an article today in OK! magazine that talked about it. It's the March2, 2009 issue with Angelina Jolie and Jennifer Aniston on the front.<br>  <br>  on page 78: It says that "the TrimBall-EXP200 capsules contain a natural dietary fiber which is 100% natural and has no side-effects. You'll lose weight everyday without any cravings. " <br>  <br>  It also says, "TrimBall-EXP200 capsules is a rare dietary fiber which is 100% natural and which has been extracted frp, a Japanese plant (known under its scientific name as KGM-E425). This plant from which the dietary fiber is extracted is found in only a few secluded areas of Japan and has a very unique property: like a "super-sponge", it expands up to 200 times it's own volume in your stomach when it comes into contact with water." <br>  <br>  If you want to lose up to 20lbs, take only 1 everytime you feel hungry or is meal time. <br>  <br>  If you want to lose more than 20 simply take two. <br>  <br>  Prices for this product range from $77- $108 including shipping. <br>  <br>  Here's their website:  <a href="http://www.trimballexp200.com/eStore,wciProcess,FAQ.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.trimballexp200.com/eStore,wci...</a><br>  <br>  Hope this helps.|`|7IG3PH39aa	Google “Bypass 2 Slimball" someone told me that this is a simular if not the exact same product.

hzMpdFFBaa	Yeast infections are common but they have a cause--and are sometimes misdiagnosed.  People (men and women) who have HIV infection are at higher risk than others for yeast infections; they have them more often and more intensely. The package labeling of the antifungal cream has to put that info on the label because they are required to do so by the FDA. It is to help discourage people from self-diagnosing and self-treating themselves when they might have bigger problems that can affect more people. <br>  <br>  Women can get yeast infections repeatedly if they have high blood sugar,<br>   If their partner has yeast growing on him (or her, in the case of lesbian and bi women) --and many men have creepy crawlies on their "equipment" but don't have symptoms and pass things around (like human papillomavirus, for instance)<br>  Women can get irritations that seem like yeast infections from using latex condoms, diaphragms, and antifungal yeast infection products themselves. So if you are frequently getting yeast infections but using a condom, you may want to try a polyurethane condom-- they are much more expensive though.<br>  Taking antibiotics for a prolonged time can result in a yeast infection because of an imbalance of microorganisms in the body.<br>  If you are very moist down there because of a natural discharge that may happen during certain times during your cycle--like ovulation. Wear panty shields to keep dry during this time.<br>  <br>  Besides using an antifungal cream (or a prescription for an antifungal pill) if your doc recommends, you might try eating good quality yogurt or taking acidophilus supplements (the stuff that yogurt is made out of). Limit eating sweet things, try to use a barrier method for sex that isn't made of latex or has strong chemicals in it, and use panty shields to absorb moisture.<br>  <br>  Male ob/gyns are not better or worse than female ob/gyns so don't let a docs gender keep you from getting care.|`|IyEJfHGSaa	Chill gurl..

It will only take about five minutes. I do not want to talk you out of your bad feelings. I am not a therapist or other mental health professional - only someone who knows what it is like to be in pain.<br>  <br>  I don’t know who you are, or why you are reading this answer. I only know that for the moment, you’re reading it, and that is good. I can assume that you are here because you are troubled and considering ending your life. If it were possible, I would prefer to be there with you at this moment, to sit with you and talk, face to face and heart to heart. But since that is not possible, we will have to make do with this.<br>  <br>  I have known a lot of people who have wanted to kill themselves, so I have some small idea of what you might be feeling. I know that you might not be up to reading a long book, so I am going to keep this short. While we are together here for the next five minutes, I have five simple, practical things I would like to share with you. I won’t argue with you about whether you should kill yourself. But I assume that if you are thinking about it, you feel pretty bad.<br>  <br>  Well, you’re still reading, and that’s very good. I’d like to ask you to stay with me for the rest of this page. I hope it means that you’re at least a tiny bit unsure, somewhere deep inside, about whether or not you really will end your life. Often people feel that, even in the deepest darkness of despair. Being unsure about dying is okay and normal. The fact that you are still alive at this minute means you are still a little bit unsure. It means that even while you want to die, at the same time some part of you still wants to live. So let’s hang on to that, and keep going for a few more minutes.<br>  <br>  Start by considering this statement:<br>  <br>  “Suicide is not chosen; it happens<br>  when pain exceeds<br>  resources for coping with pain.”<br>  <br>  That’s all it’s about. You are not a bad person, or crazy, or weak, or flawed, because you feel suicidal. It doesn’t even mean that you really want to die - it only means that you have more pain than you can cope with right now. If I start piling weights on your shoulders, you will eventually collapse if I add enough weights... no matter how much you want to remain standing. Willpower has nothing to do with it. Of course you would cheer yourself up, if you could.<br>  <br>  Don’t accept it if someone tells you, “that’s not enough to be suicidal about.” There are many kinds of pain that may lead to suicide. Whether or not the pain is bearable may differ from person to person. What might be bearable to someone else, may not be bearable to you. The point at which the pain becomes unbearable depends on what kinds of coping resources you have. Individuals vary greatly in their capacity to withstand pain.<br>  <br>  When pain exceeds pain-coping resources, suicidal feelings are the result. Suicide is neither wrong nor right; it is not a defect of character; it is morally neutral. It is simply an imbalance of pain versus coping resources.<br>  <br>  You can survive suicidal feelings if you do either of two things: (1) find a way to reduce your pain, or (2) find a way to increase your coping resources. Both are possible.<br>  <br>  Now I want to tell you five things to think about.<br>  <br>  1<br>  <br>  You need to hear that people do get through this -- even people who feel as badly as you are feeling now. Statistically, there is a very good chance that you are going to live. I hope that this information gives you some sense of hope.<br>  2<br>  <br>  Give yourself some distance. Say to yourself, “I will wait 24 hours before I do anything.” Or a week. Remember that feelings and actions are two different things - just because you feel like killing yourself, doesn’t mean that you have to actually do it right this minute. Put some distance between your suicidal feelings and suicidal action. Even if it’s just 24 hours. You have already done it for 5 minutes, just by reading this page. You can do it for another 5 minutes by continuing to read this page. Keep going, and realize that while you still feel suicidal, you are not, at this moment, acting on it. That is very encouraging to me, and I hope it is to you.<br>  3<br>  <br>  People often turn to suicide because they are seeking relief from pain. Remember that relief is a feeling. And you have to be alive to feel it. You will not feel the relief you so desperately seek, if you are dead.<br>  4<br>  <br>  Some people will react badly to your suicidal feelings, either because they are frightened, or angry; they may actually increase your pain instead of helping you, despite their intentions, by saying or doing thoughtless things. You have to understand that their bad reactions are about their fears, not about you.<br>  <br>  But there are people out there who can be with you in this horrible time, and will not judge you, or argue with you, or send you to a hospital, or try to talk you out of how badly you feel. They will s|`|p96PiyiIaa	Feeling down from time to time is a normal part of life. But when sadness takes hold and won't go away, it may be depression. These are the symptoms:<br>  *Feelings of helplessness and hopelessness <br>   A bleak outlook—nothing will ever get better and there’s nothing you can do to improve your situation. <br>   <br>  *Loss of interest in dailly activities <br>   No interest in or ability to enjoy former hobbies, pastimes, social activities, or sex. <br>   <br>  *Appetite or weight changes <br>   Significant weight loss or weight gain—a change of more than 5% of body weight in a month. <br>   <br>  *Sleep changes <br>   Either insomnia, especially waking in the early hours of the morning, or oversleeping (also known as hypersomnia).<br>   <br>  *Psychomotor agitation or retardation <br>   Either feeling “keyed up” and restless or sluggish and physically slowed down. <br>   <br>  *Loss of energy <br>   Feeling fatigued and physically drained. Even small tasks are exhausting or take longer. <br>   <br>  *Self-loathing <br>   Strong feelings of worthlessness or guilt. Harsh criticism of perceived faults and mistakes. <br>   <br>  *Concentration problems <br>   Trouble focusing, making decisions, or remembering things. <br>   <br>  I think you should take your mums advice and visit rehab for a while it could seriously help you change you life around for the better. Just talk to someone you trust about what's going on whith you and how you are feeling, like your mum or a GP. There are so many people that care about you, don't suffer in silence. I know asking for help can be really embarrassing but trust me it's the most important thing you can ever do. Don't spend another day feeling so misserable; know you deserve 100% better.

Apparently if you get the muscle cramps it means you are lacking potassium. In which case, bananas are filled with potassium. I haven't had one in over a year, so I guess it's a good sign.

I personally don't think 5 months is enough time to go through it. However, she is obviously clinically depressed at this point. She needs a psychiatrist who can prescribe medication to help her through this. Sadly, you can't force her to go. <br>  <br>  BUT, you can make her realize that you won't stand for abuse.

Sit is a straight chair with the thighs together.  Turn the head to the left as far as possible and then go to the right.  Start with the side that you were able to turn into the most.  Turn in that direction as far and hard as you can for fifteen seconds and then rest for thirty seconds.  Repeat that sequence twice more always remembering to turn as far and hard as you can.   Now get up and walk around, there should be a difference in how the back feels in pain and mobility.  Next sit in the chair and raise the left arm up as high as it will go and then the right.  Start with the arm that rose the furthest.  Raise that arm up as high and hard as you can for fifteen seconds and then rest for thirty seconds.  Repeat that routine twice more and then go to the other side and do the cycle three times.  Now get up and walk around.  Again there should be a difference in how the back feels.  Lastly, sit in the chair once more and turn the body to the left as far as it can go and then go to the right.  Start with the side that turns the most.  Do the routine of three turns as hard and far as you can followed by the same routine to the opposite side three times.  Again stand up and walk around.  Now there should definitely be a difference in how you feel and move.  Do this routine another time during the day.  You may also try this.  Try a wall push up using the left arm and then do it with the right arm.  The one that is stronger is the starting point.  Unlike the other movements this one is done in sets of ten to fifteen repetitions per set.  Three sets are done per arm always starting with the stronger arm.

A lot of small meals opposed to a few bigger ones-- make sure is has at least 8-10 or more g of protein, not too much protein because the body can only digest a certain amount at a time; and avoid too many fruits, carbs and sugars.

Each one is a vital part of nutrition.try eating nuts, olive oil, etc. for healthy good fats, and whole grains for your grains.<br>  just eat when your hungry and stop when your full.<br>  or try eating small well balanced meals every 2-3 hours.<br>  but make sure to eat enough or your metabolism will slow down.<br>  eat healthy and regularly and youll be thin.<br>  anything else, you wont.|`|AA12121469	i work long hours (anywhere from 7:30am-1am) and i often go a day without eating, or only eating one meal a day, and i haven't lost any weight, i have actually gained weight. whether or not that has anything to do with it i don't know. but i have heard by not eating you slow your metabolism down (due to lack of work i guess lol) and your body stores all the food you eat as fat as it doesn't know when its next meal is coming and its trying to maintain the body..|`|RJdWIHR7aa	Well i did it yesterday and only drunk water but i didn't lose any weight but my metabolism is really crap! so it might be good for you. if you go on youtube and type in water fasting then there are people who have done it for a month or two and they tell you all about it.

KSUPtqCaaa	So you said you've had a bad cough and pain in the chest? Let me ask you about the pain... When it first started, did it almost feel like a "tearing" sensation?<br>  <br>  If this sounds correct, then you may have torn an intercostal muscle. These types of muscle strain are not unusual with a really bad cough, but they can be quite painful.<br>  <br>  Rest by trying not to breath too hard, use a pillow or blanket to splint the ribcage when coughing (hug it hard to the chest, like a teddy bear), use an ice pack over the area of pain (about 4x/day for 30 minutes), and try ibuprofen for the pain (provided you are not allergic, and don't forget to follow the dosing directions on the bottle).<br>  <br>  This should take a week or so to have a modicum of resolotion, though you will probably have a little soreness for a few weeks all told.<br>  <br>  Cheers!<br>  <br>  PS: Here is a website with some information to check out...<br>  <a href="http://www.newsfinder.org/site/more/rib_injury_the_annoying_pain/" rel="nofollow">http://www.newsfinder.org/site/more/rib_...</a><br>  <br>  PPS: Even by being pregnant, you can still tear a muscle. I doubt it is a fractured rib, however. This requires too much force. Also, check with your doctor before taking any medications for pain, especially ibuprofen or another NSAID! This is very important.<br>  <br>  Since you are so far along in your pregnancy, I'm guessing you will be delivering soon. That said, make sure you tell your doctor about the pain. It can really flare up during labor, and it may help them to know about it.|`|PtqN5WM3aa	Pleurisy is an extremely painful condition of the lung, It causes pain on inhaling and exhaling and can be very distressing.

Well, my take would be since it does help in the areas I've outlined above, it should help your physical performance in a lot of areas.
GstUwXWMaa	I have tried and I am in LOVE!!!  I am currently on week 7 of this who new journey. All that SSS supplies is a meal plan that you chose and work with real food from the grocery store. I have lost 17.5 lbs and 9.5 inches in a little more than 6 complete weeks. I am not trying to sell you a darn thing. This program is not a diet it is a new lifestyle. It has taught me to eat better foods and I have learned so much about what fat is, trans fat, sat fat.. why sodium is bad and what a healthy range is. You get to eat two days and then treat the 3rd (there is an accelerated program for $2 more a week where it is eat for 3 and treat for one but I have not chosen that program) On your treat days you still follow the meal plan as it is set with higher amount of fat and less lean lowfat protein as the other two days and then for one meal you get to replace with a cheat food.. whatever you want to cheat with,, you dont get to eat whatever you want all day on treat day... Anyways I eat wonderful foods and the recipes are amazing... I mean for lunch today I just ate a turkey and reduced fat cheese sandwhich on whole wheat bread with 6 baby carrots and 1/2 cup mandarin oranges. I have also learned to incorporate an exercise routine into my new life. You can lose the weight without it by doing this plan I did for the 1st month, but now I want to get a little more tone! This is deinfinitely something to try if you are wanting to make a whole lifestyle change. If you are at that point where you are done being unhealthy then this is truly the best thing out there that I have found, because it is a new way of life not just some crash diet. I am learning to be healthy!!<br>  <br>  I also couple this site with a free website called www.sparkpeople.com and that is the most amazing site you will ever find to help keep you motivated and to learn so many things about what it is to be healthy! If you ever decide to go there look me up my user name is phoxym!! <br>  <br>  Best of luck to you on your journey!!

You can expect your penis to get random erections several times during the day.  It is normal and a part of normal early teen puberty.  Do not be embarrassed by this and do not try to hide them that much it is normal.  At school you can where shirts out that hang down a little, you can carry your books in front of you, or you can switch to briefs and just let your penis lay against your belly when it gets hard.  Just ignore it if you can.  If they become to bothersome go to the boys room or locker room and run some cold water over your hands and wrists.  That will help.  As you get older they will occur less and when you get into your 20's you will not have hardly any.  A few things to be aware of.  When your penis becomes erect it becomes more sensitive and all of the nerves in the penis work to make your more sexually aroused.  Ignore that urge and your penis will get flaccid again and the since of arousal will deminish (not dissappear) Later in the day when you have some privacy you should masturbate to release that sexual tension.  Be careful and avoid adult or older persons that get you aroused and then while your are sexually agitated seduce you into sex or mutual masturbation.  It is normal for boys to not think to well when they are sexually aroused.  So work to stay in control of your thoughts.  If sexual arousal is occuring stop, get up and leave, or change what your are doing.  If you want to have a jack off buddy be sure it is with a friend you can trust.  Also, understand that it will only last for a few months until you become older, wiser, and more modest.  Sex is meant to be personal and private.  Also, girls do not understand about boys penises and they think that we only get erections because we think sexy thoughts.|`|3gPLONagaa	It's complete normal.

AA11690259	What is your cardio? Meh, don't answer that. 20 to 30 minutes a day, three times a week would be more than good. If you have a stationary bike, then it be easy to do that. Same applies to weight lifting. If you're just starting out which I think you are, then do about 30 minutes a day and split your sessions up. do every other day mon-wed-fri for upper body, and tues-thurs-sat for lower body, and sunday can be your rest day. you'll need time to recover, and recovery is key to muscle strength and growth. <br>  <br>  Cut out the sweets, and eat as little fat as you can. trick is, you can't cut it out entirely, but try to reduce it.

Don't get discouraged when you plateau , it will happen, trust me. if it does, take a week off the diet and off the exercising and you will benefit even more, because you are depriving your body of calories and it will need that week off from time to time. bout every 6 weeks :)|`|GYJXjMpAaa	i would say to join the fat loss for idiots website<br>  type it on google<br>  it really works|`|cpxkROqMaa	Try a low-fat diet and read the food labels on everything you eat.
1ZDxrBzZaa	First of all I would like to tell u the causes of scabies:<br>  Scabies is caused by a microscopic  mite called Sarcoptes scabiei var. hominis. The scabies mite causes symptoms when it digs a little tunnel below the skin .. It may be caused bcoz of bad HYGIENE like not taking bath .. EEUUU<br>  and secondly I will tell u the symptoms of scabies:<br>  1.The skin may show small insect-type bites on it, or the lesions may look like pimples. The skin may also be red and or have sores due to scratching of the area.<br>  2.Scabies frequently occurs in the crevasses of the body such as between the fingers and toes, the buttocks, the elbows, the waist area.<br>  3.In crusted scabies, the body is covered with a thick, dry, and scaly rash. The rash of crusted scabies may or may not itch, but it contains thousands to millions of mites.<br>  <br>  TAKE CARE DUDE!|`|AA12386598	In scabies itching is mostly in the arm-pits, hands and groin and it is most intense during the night. And other people in the same house have similar symptoms.|`|KSUPtqCaaa	Look for track-like welts along the belt line, feet, wrists, etc. If you have a magnifying glass, you can see the track marks beneath the skin from where the mites burrow in.<br>  <br>  Scabies can be gotten rid of using a special soap called "Lindane" or permetherine. The latter is more effective, or so I'm told. Both are toxic, and should only be used once. Follow the directions carefully, and preferably, under a doctors guidance.<br>  <br>  Cheers!

BtgNH2Yaaa	Any exercise is good.  But although exercise is beneficial regardless of your diet.  However, 80% of your physique is a result of what you eat.  20% is exercise.<br>  <br>  So by making sure you eat a healthy, balanced low fat diet of:-<br>  Lean meats (no fat on), poutry (no skin on), fish with scales on (not fried in batter or breadcrumbs), eggs, plenty of fresh fruit and vegetables, low fat dairy products, skimmed milk, sugar free beverages, (including tea and coffee), eggs, and non sugary cereals.<br>  <br>  But do make sure you KEEP all Junk Foods, ready made processed meals, alcohol, sugary fizzy drinks and takeaway meals to an absolute minimum.  These are high in sugar and full of saturated fat.  The two main ingredients which are responsible for those extra pounds.  <br>  <br>  Junk food is just what it says - JUNK.  With one added ingredient in - FAT.<br>  <br>  Try to include more wholefoods into your diet.  Such as brown bread, brown rice,brown pasta, beans & pulses.  These are high in fiber and will keep you feeling fuller for longer.<br>  <br>  Try to MOVE as MUCH as YOU CAN.  The more you move the better.<br>  <br>  Walking is good, but if you could fit in a couple of minutes running,  Then even better.  Try walking for 5 minutes and running for 2 minutes, then if you can gradually increasing the running.  If you can run for around 30 minutes.  <br>  <br>  Swmming, cycling, using a jump rope, trampoline, climbing up the stairs.  All of these will help to get your heart rate up.  Meaning your blood is pumping, you are breathing hard, and sweating.  Making it possible to burn calories.<br>  <br>  A healthy weight loss is around 2lbs a week.  Weight loss varies from person to person.<br>  <br>  But one thing you have to remember is.  That once you have reached your realsitic target weight.  If you go back to your old eating habits and activity levels.  Unfortunately, you will put all the weight back on again.  It is as simple as that.<br>  <br>  I know this works.  I also struggled with my weight for many, many years.  But just over 2 years ago I set out to eat a healthy sensible diet and embarked on regular exercise.  Which was running.

KAnEq8Laaa	How many calories you burn doing anything depends on your size to begin with, as well as your age and the intensity of the exercise. Most weight-tracking software that calculates calories burned does this based on a 150 pound person exercising for 60 minute increments, and then adjusts the total up or down based on your personal information. That said, a 150 pound person would burn around 200 calories per hour shopping. And that's a more or less figure, a variable, because sometimes while shopping you speed up, you slow down, you lift things, or you're clothes shopping and trying on jeans that you have to jump up and down to fit in...and sometimes you're just standing still pondering the peanut butter. See what I mean? <br>  <br>  A good site for you is www.my-calorie-counter.com, which will let you input your height, weight, and age, and then you can search lists of activities and find out, tailored to your stats, how many calories you burn doing just about anything.|`|RJdWIHR7aa	It depends how heavy you are, if you go on this website it will tell you. <a href="http://www.healthatoz.com/healthatoz/Atoz/tl/misc/caloriesburned.jsp?caloriesBurntValue=588&Weightlb=100&exercise_calorie=445G&DurationHr=1&DurationMin=0" rel="nofollow">http://www.healthatoz.com/healthatoz/Ato...</a>|`|WfwFuQB0aa	don't know about the calories but i guess you could burn a lot of calories worrying about the amount of money spent.|`|11kuwaOEaa	Shopping actually burns a lot more calories than one might think.

Chicken pox breaks out in batches over several days, so he may look worse before  he looks better.  As long as he is happy, eating and drinking well  there is not much to do except keep him away from other people until all the lesions are scabbed over.  If he has a lot of itching, good old calamine lotion looks terrible but does give relief.  We don't see chicken pox much anymore, since most US kids are immunized against it.  Good luck.|`|nrTVlo8Eaa	Make sure you don't expose him to any older people until all his lesions have scabbed over, first of all. The problem is that you don't have any idea which adults still have immunity or not; I'd just keep him home. Chicken Pox is much worse for adults.<br>  <br>  Aveeno oatmeal bath is pretty helpful for keeping the itching at a minimum.

If I remember correctly, just keep him comfortable, tell him to try not to scratch and have plenty of Calamine lotion on hand.|`|3QIWdvG1aa	Treatment for chickenpox (varicella) depends on a person's age, health, and severity of the illness.<br>  <br>      * Healthy children with chickenpox may need only home treatment. This includes taking acetaminophen (such as Tylenol) or ibuprofen (such as Advil) to reduce fever and discomfort and taking nonprescription oral medications or using lotions to reduce itching. (Do not give aspirin to people younger than 20 because of the risk of Reye's syndrome). Oatmeal baths also can relieve itching.<br>      * Healthy teens and adults with chickenpox usually have more severe symptoms than children and are at higher risk for complications than children. Still, most need only home treatment. All adults with chickenpox should be seen by a health professional; some may need hospital care.<br>      * Pregnant women and people with immune system problems are also at increased risk for complications. They should see a health professional immediately if they suspect they have chickenpox.<br>  <br>  Medical treatment may include a shot of chickenpox antibodies to delay or prevent a person from having chickenpox, and also may include antiviral medication to shorten the length of the disease. The chickenpox (varicella-zoster) vaccinealso can be given if you have been exposed to chickenpox; this treatment may prevent you from having the illness. It is recommended that the vaccine be given within 3 days after exposure to chickenpox. Most people can be vaccinated to prevent chickenpox (varicella). The vaccine is successful as long as it is given before you have been exposed to the virus. It also may prevent or result in a milder case of chickenpox if given within 3 days of exposure.<br>  <br>  Antiviral medications also may be an option after you start to develop symptoms of chickenpox. These medications do not prevent or cure chickenpox, but they can help shorten its course and make it milder.<br>  <br>  Immunoglobulins can be given to help protect you from getting chickenpox after you have been exposed to it. However, these medications can give only short-term protection (up to 3 months).<br>  <br>  After you have developed symptoms of chickenpox, you can use nonprescription medications to help relieve discomfort.<br>  Medication Choices<br>  Vaccination to prevent chickenpox<br>  <br>  Chickenpox can be prevented by getting the varicella-zoster vaccineClick here to view a form.(What is a PDF document?) before exposure to the virus. A shot of the vaccine can be given in one of two ways:<br>  <br>      * As 2 doses given at 12 to 15 months and 4 to 6 years<br>      * In a combination shot that also contains the vaccines for measles, mumps, and rubella. This combination shot is known as MMRV (ProQuad) and can be substituted for one or both of the regular measles, mumps, and rubella (MMR) shots.6 (Immunization with MMR combination vaccine is recommended for children between 12 to 15 months of age and again at 4 to 6 years of age.) If a child receives ProQuad, a separate vaccination for varicella is not needed.<br>  <br>  If you are exposed to chickenpox and you get the vaccine within 3 days, the vaccine may still be effective in preventing the illness or result in a milder case.<br>  Medications to help decrease the severity of chickenpox<br>  <br>      * Antiviral medications, such as Zovirax, Foscavir, Famvir, Valtrex, and Denavir. Antiviral medication is usually used to treat adults and people with impaired immune systems; healthy children usually don't need antiviral medication when they have chickenpox. It is not known whether antiviral medications reduce a person's chances of developing complications of chickenpox.<br>      * Immunoglobulins (IG). This treatment is given through a vein, usually at the hospital. Immunoglobulins are a group of proteins in human blood and tissue fluids. These proteins help the body's immune system recognize and destroy harmful bacteria and viruses in the body, such as the varicella virus. You may get IG after being exposed to an infected person. IG can also be given to people with certain immune system deficiencies to prevent infections. Immune globulin is usually taken from the blood of people recovering from an illness; for example, the immune globulin given to help prevent chickenpox infection is taken from the blood of people who are recovering from chickenpox. The protection provided by an immune globulin injection lasts about 3 months. Immunoglobulin for chickenpox must be given before a rash appears.<br>  <br>  Medications to relieve pain and discomfort from chickenpox<br>  <br>      * Acetaminophen (Tylenol, Tempra) or ibuprofen (Advil) to control pain and fever. People over age 20 also can take aspirin to reduce fever. Do not give aspirin to anyone younger than 20 because of the risk of Reye's syndrome.<br>      * Antihistamines to relieve itching, such as Benadryl or Vistaril.<br>  <br>  What To Think About<br>  <br>  Vaccinations to prevent chickenpox help you or your child avoid an illness that causes discomfort, missed work or school, and possibly complications.<br>  <br>  In rare cases, you or your child will develo
KAnEq8Laaa	1. The founder of Weight Watchers was Jean Nidetch, a housewife in Brooklyn, New York, who liked cookies a little too much. She started a diet based on the NY Dept of Public Health plan, lost 20 pounds, and then realized she was going to dive back into the cookies unless she had some support. So she formed a group of friends to all support one another.<br>  <br>  2. Experience made her an "expert," if any of us are ever really "experts" in anything. <br>  <br>  3. No, WW involves what in the popular parlance is now known as a "lifestyle change."<br>  <br>  4. No, not specifically, since it's an American Company. But it was initially formed around a US Government-sponsored public health plan in the state of New York in 1961. They have since updated their information, of course, based on new models.<br>  <br>  [You skipped #5, so I continue here with your numbering scheme.]<br>  <br>  6. Yes. The big thing here is to be conscious of what, and how much, you eat. There are a number of ways of doing that, like counting "points", but it comes down to educating oneself about portion size and keeping strict written track of what one eats, which is never bad advice, no matter what plan you follow.<br>  <br>  7. Like most more or less reputable plans for weight loss that you pay for, you can do the plan without buying their special food or supplements. They would LIKE you to buy their stuff, of course.<br>  <br>  8. Yes. Meals three times a day, and two snacks, which, again, is never bad.<br>  <br>  9. Yes. You track daily exercise just like you track your foods.<br>  <br>  10. No. Doctors recommend this plan, in fact, because some people do well with the constant support group thing, since they tend to lapse into bad habits without it.<br>  <br>  11. Yes. There are weekly maintenance sessions, or less frequently, if you like. A friend of mine who did WW used to go once every week or so for a weigh-in, just to make sure she maintained her weight. If she would've gained anything, they would have helped her figure out why.<br>  <br>  12. They hire dieticians to work out their plans, but the people in the centers are employees, not medical or nutrition professionals.<br>  <br>  As far as diet plans go, I'd give it a 10 for being healthy. As far as being necessary, I'd give it a 6. Some people need support groups; some don't. As far as cost, I give it a 0 - you don't need to spend money on expensive programs to learn how to eat right and exercise. As far as effectiveness, I give it a 9, since it's not perfect, but it does work really really well. Overall, about a 7. Effective, but unnecessary.|`|DjircW6waa	1.

Genital human papillomavirus (HPV) is the most common sexually transmitted infection (STI). The virus infects the skin and mucous membranes. There are more than 40 HPV types that can infect the genital areas of men and women, including the skin of the penis, vulva (area outside the vagina), and anus, and the linings of the vagina, cervix, and rectum. You cannot see HPV. Most people who become infected with HPV do not even know they have it.<br>  <br>  What are the symptoms and potential consequences of HPV?<br>  <br>  Most people with HPV do not develop symptoms or health problems. But sometimes, certain types of HPV can cause genital warts in men and women. Other HPV types can cause cervical cancer and other less common cancers, such as cancers of the vulva, vagina, anus, and penis. The types of HPV that can cause genital warts are not the same as the types that can cause cancer.<br>  <br>  HPV types are often referred to as “low-risk” (wart-causing) or “high-risk” (cancer-causing), based on whether they put a person at risk for cancer. In 90% of cases, the body’s immune system clears the HPV infection naturally within two years. This is true of both high-risk and low-risk types.|`|0vQbPqbwaa	No but it means she most likely has HPV. And certain hpv viruses can give you cervical cancer. She really should go see a doctor.|`|hzMpdFFBaa	No. Genital warts are a symptom of humanpapilloma virus. Certain types of HPV can cause cervical dysplasia (a precancerous condition) and cervical cancer. Warts and cervical dysplasia or cancer can occur at the same time (they did for me). A Pap smear can detect HPV and other infections. You can be infected with HPV and it can go away spontaneously but you can be reinfected with a different strain of the virus. It is sexually transmitted, it is epidemic, many men carry the virus but are asymptomatic. Condone use can help prevent transmission of HPV. <br>  <br>  A doc may "freeze" off the warts and, if the Pap smear shows significant cellular changes to the cervix, perform an operation in which cells of the cervix are shaved off. If cancer is diagnosed, that is a whole other ballgame but it is not that common in women who are diligent about getting Ob/gyn exams that include Pap smear tests.|`|413cfb7eef158b727cd15e4e110059a4aa	No, but you are very high risk for cervical cancer. I have HPV but I don't have the warts. Mine had no symptoms. It was caught on a routine pap smear. Now my paps are always bad and I have to go to a specialist every year to get a C.O.P.O. and biopsy even though I have no symptoms. Cervical cancer is very deadly. If you catch it early then chances are it can be removed. Please don't put off your pap smears. They are VERY important.|`|Cnb4yMAQaa	What? No.. they are nothing to do with each other. Genital warts are from having unprotected sex with someone who had them, and caught the virus from them.. cervical cancer is from.. cancer. You cannot get cervical cancer from genital warts, or vice versa.

The person may suffer from a lack of concentration and be unable to make decisions, or be a little bit forgetful and confused. They may also get puzzled and upset about their behaviour. <br>  <br>  In the middle stages of dementia, the person will become more forgetful, especially of people's names and recent events. They may become muddled about what day or time it is, have difficulty talking and understanding what people have said to them, and may put themselves at risk by doing things like leaving pans to boil dry on the cooker. They may also become angry, upset and aggressive quite easily.

51HWwSlwaa	There are a lot of people who are shy, nothing wrong with that. Just because you're 20 and not dating there is nothing weird about that either. You know there are a lot of people that would like to be your friend if you give them a chance. You don't have to be the life of the party to have friends, you need to be more sure of yourself and who you are, Don't be afraid to express your opions, it will probably get you some self esteen and get you noticed. There's a lot of guys that feel the same way you do and they don't know what to do or how to approach a girl. Be yourself first and things will be great for you. Don't try to change into something or someone you aren't. And just remember there is guys out there that feel just like you do. Join some organizations is a great way to make friends and who knows you might meet Mr. Right!!<br>  GOOD LUCK!!|`|0RscSQj7aa	I think if you found a good boyfriend, you'd be able to open up to people more.|`|1itmn0NOaa	You need to have a friend that undrestand you.|`|P6qKmhihaa	hey there  not  so fast  I  was20   before I started  to date and  I  am still shy at 61, you sound great don't be to hard on yourself  when you are born shy it is a painful  life  no matter how hard you try to make it all happen  most of the population are shy and it can be really hard to even have a normal relationship with any one  you end up with the same personality  as  yourself and some how you compensate for your loss of communication  skills and it can lead to being lonely<br>    some advice  go and seek some help some you can trust  stay in touch<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>    have a good day|`|uC0xTgkeaa	when it comes to looking for a relationship, don't look around, but keep your eyes open. <br>  <br>  in other words, it doesn't seem like you are the kind of person who should be looking for a boyfriend. that would be a socially awkward experience for both of you, but that's ok. if there is a guy you like, just try to be friends with him. in successful relationships almost always start off as two friends.

yg5P4mBlaa	You need to do exercise as well as reduce your food intake. (More meals, less amount of food!)|`|MzWM9rBRaa	If you want to lose that kind of weight you need to focus on your diet too.  Diet will account for 70% of your weight loss (or weight gain)  You seem to be getting enough exercise, although you can never really get enough.  But you must fix your diet to be healthier in order to lose weight.|`|8o5Rbu62aa	I had way too many pounds in all the wrong places until I used acai berry, I understand they say that pills do not work, however they definitely worked for me, and they have been shown on the Rachael Ray Show too.

If you consume more calories than you burn, you will not lose weight.  Losing 40 lbs. by July may not be very safe or doable because of plateaus you will invariably encounter--where your weight/scale may stay the same.   You should lose only 1-2 lbs. per week in order to stay healthy-- the initial water weight excluded.  Adding strength/weight training can speed the inches lost, which is more important than what the scale reveals.  The best test of this is how your clothes fit.
c8ebe8705eaf13a28547213ca1de8013aa	Your situation is a very serious one.  A body mass index over 50 is considered a genetic disorder rather than one of calories in versus calories 'burned'.  The universal recommendation at this time for people with a BMI over 40 (or those with a BMI over 35 with a co-morbid condition such as hypertension or diabetes) is bariatric surgery such as gastric laparoscopic banding.  A BMI over 50 places you at a dangerously high risk for premature cardiovascular events such as heart attack and stroke.  People with a BMI over 40 have a high incidence of obstructive sleep apnea and this may be the source of your fatigue.  So far as your BMI is concerned I would strongly encourage you to seek medical evaluation promptly.  For those with a BMI over 40 diet and exercise rarely succeed in bringing the BMI to below 30.  I have never had a patient with a BMI of 50 succeed in reaching 35 let alone below 30.  Obstructive sleep apnea is not just 'being tired' and it is not a benign condition.  It is also associated with adverse health outcomes.  I wish you the very best of health but please promptly seek medical advice regarding bariatric surgery and a sleep study for sleep apnea.|`|7oYpbSjIaa	your BMI is 50?!?!?!!?  how are you still alive?  you are MORBIDLY obese!!!  THAT is why you are so tired! you really really really need to lose weight.
y43tzOQlaa	Couple of suggestions, Melatonin is a great help. Learn some relaxing technics, when the brain is active it keeps our body going. Listening to some relaxing music, nothing with allot of words it makes the brain work. Breathe, deep and relaxed, listen to your breathing. Ear plugs work when you get use to them, it blocks out the noises from out side.  If none of this is working see a Dr., I take Ambien it's safe and I don't wake up with the groggy hangover feeling.|`|g6Vci5SUaa	Depending on what time of day you're working out, your metabolism could still be revved up and not allowing you to get to sleep soon enough to allow a proper resting period.  Try switching your workouts to the AM hours instead of PM.      A relaxing bath or hot shower and a cup of chamomile tea at night might help you relax.  Remove anything that doesn't relax you from your bedroom, whether it's the TV, your computer, work, etc.  Create stories in your head as you're falling asleep, and keep it very detailed.  Sometimes the details can put you to sleep.  A white noise generator could help block out racing thoughts, too.    If it continues for an extended period of time after making changes, then I would suggest consulting your medical professional for advice.    Good luck, and sweet dreams to you. :)|`|QQlbvWj4aa	Take Melatonin.  It's a natural drug used to help people fix sleep cycles if they are jet lagged.  Take it about an hour before you want to sleep.  They come in many different kinds- pills that dissolve under your tongue (that don't taste bad- like mint- just a bit chalky) and regular pills, in different strengths.  They aren't expensive, either, and you can get them at any drug store.  It's what my doctor recommended when I was having anxiety issues that kept me up.|`|L1z5qydSaa	Are you stressed or ave too many things on your mind This could be the cause. In any case, I'd suggest meditating. Sometimes you end up falling asleep in the middle of a session.|`|ugsfuQQcaa	Sometimes after a workout later in the day, you energy levels are still raised.  If possible, try exercising earlier and relaxing in the evening.  Also, make sure you save bed for sleeping.  NO t.v., homework, reading, etc.  Maybe a small bowl of cereal in the evening about 1/2 hour before bed and even trying this technique has helped before.  When you go to bed, get snuggled down and relax.  Then, starting with the letter "a" think of as many girls names that start with "a."  Then move on to the next letter and so on.  Don't stress to think too hard, it's just a way to relax.  You can also try chamomile tea in the evening.
2wMMAKpOaa	A reliable, cheap brand of BC I was on is called Desogen. In fact I had gotten it for free because I went to the health clinic to get it. I suggest just going to your local health clinic, it's cheap. Hope this helped :)|`|khCt2oSoaa	Call your drug store. Let them pull up your insurance and they will let you know what your insurance will cover. Then you can take that list to your doctor and talk to him about it. A lot of doctor's offices you don't have to go back in you can call and talk to the nurse and they can talk to your doctor for you and have something else called in. Also they may have samples and that can save you a lot. Good luck you need to this asap you don't want to miss any pills and when you swich its best for the first 3 weeks to use back up birth control. There has been a lot of girls with babies who swich birth control and didn't used back up.|`|pcOdEZllaa	As far as my knowledge,this is a question with various answers,it is really depending on the mind of yourself,providing a great resource here <a href="http://www.HealthInsuranceIdeas.info/free-online-health-insurance.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.HealthInsuranceIdeas.info/fre...</a>  for reference though.|`|weBvwrloaa	birth control  does not usually come in "generic" brands. But it is more expensive  if your own family doctor prescribes it, and  it is less expensive if you seek it through a  family planning center. you can get your  choice of birth control at very little or no cost depending upon your income and or if you have health insurance. They use a "sliding scale fee" to determine how to charge ( if at all). It is the very same birth control that your own family doctor or ob/gyn would prescribe. you can also get your bc online and up to a 90 day supply cheaper but I would suggest the  family planning center first. Doesn't matter if it' spills, the ring, diaphragm, I.U.D's or shots. They  do it all...Oh, they will make you do the whole physical but it's worth it to spend way less

8RCANzJvaa	doesnt matter when you exercise, as long as you do, if you are trying to lose weight.<br>  <br>  the best time is probably afternoon before suppertime, or in the morning (unless you go to school lol) because, ive noticed that if i exercise at night, it keeps me up all night. all my blood is flowing, hearts pumping, it kinda energizes me; gets me pumped up for the day (that just ended...)<br>  <br>  thats why i do mine in the morning or afternoon. <br>  <br>  if you want to do something like weight training or yoga, tht shouldnt be a problem because its not as aerobic as the treadmill or the bikes.<br>  <br>  since you are a girl, no matter how much you work out, you wont get big and bulky like men do. youll get lots of definition, but no bulk. =)|`|Qm2apU5Qaa	Its a little hard to exercise while trying to digest food. If you just ate a big meal it is. Otherwise, its not a bad idea, because the nutrients your muscles will need during reparation will be available immediately. That's why protein supplements ask you to ingest their product 30 minutes prior to working out.
f7a52089d54ea643febc2fcffc9dd887aa	It is not airborne. That is the dumbest thing I've ever heard. Well, not the DUMBEST. Anyways, it can be a virus or a bacteria that has to be ingested. So it is transferred by touch with unclean surfaces that a sick person has touched. Bodily fluid transfer...oral and even nasal secretions as well as fecal-oral transmission.<br>  <br>  And in regards to the Norovirus, norwalk virus, and norwalk-like viruses....they're most often seen on cruise ships...and they are not airborne.|`|zw6EJ2izaa	It depends on the specific stomach virus they had.  Different strains of virus may be transmitted in different ways.  You should be fine, however, it is unlikely that walking by someone will cause you to get it.  I work in a hospital and come in contact with sick people all day and I rarely get sick, washing your hands and keeping a good diet to support your immune system will go a long way.<br>  <br>  edit- He is right in saying there is no stomach flu because Influenza is a respiratory disease, however there are many virus strains which cause gastro-intestinal problems lasting a day or two.|`|KhvXdMpNaa	there is no such thing as the 24 hr flu <br>  its really food poisening
deYDbVDSaa	Everyone is different so there are no real answers to your questions.<br>  <br>  1. Whether it is a clean bulk or not, I would suggest you go 12 - 16 weeks at a minimum.<br>  <br>  2. At your age you can reasonable expect a couple pounds a month.<br>  <br>  3. Again whether it is clean or not, you will need to eat a ton. You do have to eat more than you burn to give your body the material to add weight/muscle.<br>  <br>  4. Go for 2g of protein per pound of body weight. You may want to work up to that if you have been eating less protein. It can stop you up, if you all of a sudden increase your protein.<br>  <br>  5. In the future, I would suggest bulking starting in the fall, and cutting near the end of winter. Maintain through the summer. The reason here should be obvious.
WdGmsSrMaa	I didn't mind mine. It's just annoying to remember to keep putting it back in once you're done eating!<br>  <br>  Just make sure you brush it daily, that's my one tip for you. It doesn't take long, and you'll thank yourself in the long run!|`|Qy4k1w1aaa	It does take a while to get used to. Try to avoid playing with it with your tongue. Once you get into the habit of doing that, it's hard to break and it can really annoy other people.

nVI0Stvzaa	I was wondering the same thing about Levity...    I have read that omega 3 supplements can help with depression and anxiety. I don't eat fish, but if you do, eating salmon or taking fish oil supplements might help.    Magnesium can also help if you have problems with anxiety or irritability.    Also, make sure you're getting enough of the B vitamins, thiamin, and riboflavin.    I would try taking a regular multivitamin before spending the money on a "special" multivitamin, like Levity. But if Levity has worked for others and a regular multivitamin doesn't, Levity is probably still better for you than a prescription drug (unless you have very severe depression).
lpDyjosfaa	In times of great stress (more than usual), your OCD will most likely flare up. For the most part, however, you should be able to trust your medicine.

But when a therapist gives you a positive regard they are truly happy with your progress and also it gives them a good feeling to know that they are helping you.|`|tKFO3u60aa	do you mean if they 'really' are, as opposed to not actually? or do you mean 'really' as 'extremely'? <br>  i'll take it as the first one.<br>  well, if they are judgmental, and to some degree I think you are correct, that is their job. patients do not go to a therapist to be told "well, i don't know if i can help you because i don't want to make any judgments."<br>  however, therapists do generally leave a lot up to the patient, whether it seems like it or not. sometimes they step in, to direct the patient to the path that seems best, but most often they present the choices and let the patient decide. i don't know if you've ever talked with a therapist, but one tends not to be too judgmental. if one is, he or she probably won't last very long. some people are hypochondriacs--they love being told they are on their deathbed every time they take a breath, but not many like to be classified under mental health problems, at least, not consciously. subconsciously, it requires a great deal of effort to pull out from under the mountain of stress and worry, and therapists are there to remove some of the rocks and show you a path to the surface. it's harder than it sounds, and takes years of learning about trends in certain situations, healing processes, and how to treat every case as in its uniqueness. therapists are not judging so much as they are expressing what is often the case. don't knock it till you've tried it:P|`|JJCSEe3Taa	I wouldn't say lie.

fdKA2Rr7aa	It can effect your sleep, but the hours you are sleeping are safe. It is actually healthier to get 7 hours of sleep, than it is to get more or less. Well, this is according to a book I read. If you start sleeping less than 5 hours you're looking at some implications. Also, it is healthier to go to sleep earlier than 12am, even if you wake up early. Just take into account that genetics play a huge part in overall growth. Your diet, activities, and sleep habits are just small additions to the overall picture.<br>  <br>  However, the weight lifting will stunt your growth if you are one of those real "heavy" lifters. I am talking about the commitment, not the weight. Stretching can help, but growth can still be stunted by it.|`|dBoC8fR2aa	Sleep would affect your growth, but I think the weight lifting would.

q0oynj9Faa	I don't think they would die immediately, but without treatment in 24 hours or so they're most likely going to be dead.  It depends when they receive medical treatment, but I don't think they would be in critical condition for four weeks- the injuries would have been fixed but it might be possible.  The knife would probably have to enter from the lower part of the belly and then travel upwards into the body.  That would prove with the most serious and numerous injuries (basically the intestine would be sliced up A LOT).  The knife may hit other vital organs such as the spleen or liver as well.  These injuries wouldn't cause immediate death but a slower one if medical treatment is recieved.|`|RcTdyxjgaa	You wouldnt necessarily die right away depending on which organ the blade of the knife struck, would depend on how long you would live, you could die fast if it was a more vital organ such as the heart or lungs, but if you punctured your intestines, or something like that you could slowy build up an infection that would intoxicate your body and blood stream which would end up killing you. Also you could get internal bleeding and die, not instantly but fairly quickly, so my real answer is I guess that it all depends on which organ you hit, and how severe the puncture wound is.

All this will do is take away some of the symptoms of your cold or flu. It will make you feel better but it will not make you any more less sick then you already are. Good luck and I hope you feel better soon.|`|S6n5kC9raa	no itll help a little but only for a while.i had a bad sore throat a while ago and it felt really bad and it didnt go away with medicines. drink a lot of fluids and sleep too. itll go away in like 3 days.yes i know it sounds like a long time.get well
XHnpraaxaa	If you use steam to open your pores do make sure you clean your face well or it will not do no good.  You may want to check the web for home remedies.  They often have many little secrets that help and cost nothing.  Many just use stuff we have laying around the house and says us big bucks as well.  I could not believe all the stuff that VICK'S is good for.  Had it on my feet last night to make my heels softer. It works too

ew0FaElzaa	I highly suggest AGAINST accutane. It's an extremely potent acne medication, while yes it does wonders, it also makes you extremely sick. My mother has cystic acne and was prescribed this medication. The dryness depends on the persons skin type. If you have naturally dry skin then obviously it will be pretty bad, if you have oily skin though it won't be as bad. Usually results are seen within a few weeks. You do not "break out" from the medication is causes more internal problems then external. I am hoping that your doctor told you of the risks involved in taking this medication! If not please, please look it up! You also cannot get rid of pores just so you know, you need them so that your skin can breath. You can reduce the appearance of a pore though.|`|4FR9d17Xaa	My mom refused to let the dermatologist give it to me because of all the side effects and precautions you have to take.|`|xRQAsGRAaa	I used it when I was 16, I'm 19 now.<br>  <br>  I saw results in about 3 weeks.<br>  <br>  I've had like 3 pimples since I got off it.<br>  <br>  The side effects suck since I wasn't prepared for them. Buy a lot of chap stick, and an oil-free moisturizer for your face. Let your arms peel, because they will stop in a few weeks after you start it.<br>  <br>  The dryness stayed for the first 2 months of starting it, then my body got used to it.<br>  <br>  You don't break out when you get it, you just get really dry.<br>  <br>  No it does not get rid of blemishes(except for pimples), and why would you want to get rid of your pores? You need pores.<br>  <br>  <br>  Edit: forgot to mention the bloodwork. You have to get bloodwork every month until you work up to your maximum dose. It's not bad, but be prepared to be late for things since it has to be in the morning.
eb603a32531b733c208d6a3685da0228aa	Birth control pills are famous for lightening period flow, and the effect is cumulative.  Pills work because they trick your body into thinking it's already pregnant.  So it doesn't build up as much endometrial lining, and there isn't as much to shed each  month. After a while, that means you have a rather scanty period.  Brown blood is just old blood, more broken down and unable to turn red in air anymore.  It doesn't mean anything else.   I don't know why you are bloated and lightheaded, other than you may be suffering a mild viral infection.  You could also have something else, since you and the BF do not use a condom.  If it continues to be a problem, you will need to see a doctor to have it checked out.  Meantime, if you have taken your pills every day, and more than a month, chances for pregnancy are really low and not worth worrying about.  But you can always use a home test to set your mind at ease.  If you are, it will show positive- pill or no pill.|`|4A8lGwYJaa	my mom got pregnant with me while being on birth control...|`|pd0EeJMJaa	It depends on the type of birth control you are on, most forms of the pill are usually around 92-99.7% effective with perfect usage ( meaning you didn't forget on a day.) So there is still a chance of pregnancy. <br>  The second link I'm giving you gives a list of early signs of pregnancy, my son was born last June and I noticed many of these symptoms within the first 6 weeks of my pregnancy.|`|2b1GEf68aa	My boyfriends mom was on birth control and she still got pregnant and had him. Periods can be very short i've had one and two day periods. a lot of women get bloated when they have had there period, and i've gotten light headed and head aches. the best thing to do is do a pregnancy test or wait another 28-30 days and see if you get your period again, if not you MAY be pregnant. so next time you're out think about heading over to a CVS or WalGreens or any store that may sell a pregnancy test and buy one. make sure you use condoms because birth control does not prevent pregnancy 100%. that's as much as i know and i wish you good luck with your situation.|`|pN3INe2yaa	well if you ha vent forgotten to take the pill then you should be fine and my last period was also 1 day long then it was brown and im okay so you should be fine but if your really worried then I suggest that you ask your doctor|`|2wMMAKpOaa	Well how long have you been on your birth control? Sometimes when you haven't been on it for that long your periods will be a little irregular for a bit. Hope this helps :)
a3a7528fd9333924ab2d7522df78a2e6aa	OCD (and all "mental illness") is just an extreme version of behaviours we all have. It's probably no diagnosable OCD. We (humans) are creatures of habit. We like repetition, predictability, etc. And we have a lot of trouble when we try *not* to think about something. Try it... set a timer for 2 minutes and try NOT TO think about a polar bear. :)      We also like thoughts that distract us. I wonder what else is going on in your life? Maybe this song is actually *good* for you...instead of lying in bed thinking worrying thoughts, your mind goes to music.    In any case, the more you worry about it, the more your will probably think about it. Relax and enjoy your free radio station.

The only bad thing about marijuana is the actual smoke when someone smokes it. So my advice (so you can enjoy the high and not be paranoid) is to just extract the thc and cook with it.

Could anything else you do cause problems with something you have?|`|UmVjp0Pqaa	You have answered this question for yourself already!, even the fact the fact your questioning it means you shouldn't do it because you'd be doing it only for your friends and not yourself. I wouldn't recommend it for anyone anyway! Not healthy for people without all of the difficulties you have regarding your heart and mentality.|`|2vkVQ3F6aa	Before listening to a bunch of propaganda-spewing conservatives, you should do some research about the medical benefits of marijuana. It is *not* addictive, and helps with many different physical and mental ailments.    There are a lot of good books out there about cooking with it (to remove the effects that smoke inhalation cause, if you're concerned), and the history of the plant.    You should discuss this with your doctor if you have medical problems, and in this day and age there are MANY doctors that condone the use. My father is wheelchair-bound, with the very debilitating multiple sclerosis, and has discovered that marijuana assists him with the slowing of the progression of his disease, along with calming some of the more severe muscle spasms and the depression that comes with dealing with a horrible condition.    I understand there are a lot of do-gooders that feel that because it is "illegal" that it is a harmful substance and on the same level as serious narcotics such as cocaine, meth, heroin, etc. However, alcohol was illegal at one point, along with biracial marriage and women in the military.    This is the 21st century. Marijuana is just like any other medication (or even alcohol). It's not for everyone, but users should not be condemned for seeking alternate treatment for medical conditions -- or for preferring marijuana to alcohol. Be informed and make an intelligent decision for your *own* life.    [I would like to note that smoking weed for ADHD & OCD can be very beneficial. I have ADD and am often deluged with racing thoughts and a very short attention span. Smoking helps slow me down enough so that I can concentrate on one thing at a time instead of bouncing off the walls.  As for the heart palpitations, I don't know that inhalation of smoke is very helpful, but weed can be cooked and the THC added to your food.]    I am a regular smoker that uses it as an alternative to the often harmful compressed pills the doctors try to cram down own throats.|`|ozexBuZ3aa	no please dont do it, my boyfriend was on weed for 8 years after he got addicted and has only just decided to sort himself out. he has ADHD also. now hes on tablets because he has heart and lung problems, he has numerous panic/ansiety attacks and he gets a really fast heartbeet and pulpatations all the time. it will ruin your life x

yY2Czxy2aa	As far as I can tell, there are no proven weight loss benefits from the acai berry, juice, or capsules.    It does seem to be a great supplement (I take it, but don't sell the stuff!) and is full of anti oxidents, which help prevent damage to your body. But that's what you should take it for, not weight loss or fat burning.     The acai berry itself is an amazing thing - has a lot of anti oxidents etc and is really good for you.    But there's nothing really to suggest in scientific terms that it helps with weight loss.     And there are a lot of scams out there, be careful where you buy it from!    I take it, and I think I feel healthier and better. But it's not some type of magic formula, sorry.|`|MzWM9rBRaa	Those are some lose weight quick gimmicks, i don't think they're good for long term weight loss.|`|xopIi2Vfaa	I tried reading up on it and came on reports that they don't work. All websites which claim that they work try to sell them to you. There also seem to be quite a number of scams which try to get your credit card number.    A?ai berry supplements have been promoted in the U.S. for weight loss, as energy boosters, and as a source of antioxidants. However, according to ABC news correspondent Susan Donaldson, these products have not been evaluated by the FDA and their efficacy for weight loss is questionable.[3] In late 2008, lawyers for The Oprah Winfrey Show began investigating potential claims against supplement manufacturers who suggested that frequent Oprah guest Dr. Mehmet Oz had recommended their product or a?ai in general for weight loss.

You can't sit around on the couch eating pizza and expect them to magically make the weight disappear.    But what worked for me is that the two products together helped to boost my metabolism and gave me tons of extra energy.  I've always struggled to lose weigh in the past because of my slow metabolism - I'd go to the gym every day and eat perfectly, but never see any results.  Now, I find it much easier to stick with my plan and see results.    Hope this helps!

I was stuck at my weight loss goals and this brought me through it and made me lose a lot of weight.  So in my opinion it helped me lose weight tremendously.  I know a lot of that dieting stuff is expensive but I found a free trial of Acai Berry(I think it only cost me like 7-8 bucks at the time for shipping.)  The site I got it from was theweight lossp lace.com -  All I did was try it out for a month and I was sold,  I saw the results I wanted to and like I said I was in that plateau with my weight loss.  This kicked it up a bunch.    Good luck and I hope this helps.

rpnFxnCQaa	Ashley,<br>  <br>  I used to.<br>  <br>  IMHO, you really should avoid medicine, when avoidable, of course. I am not saying you should not listen to you doctor!<br>  <br>  I had anxiety when I had to speak in public. Or when there would be more than a few people around me in the same room. It was something that started when I was a teenager and that lasted over years and subsequently affected my career until not so long ago. <br>  <br>  At some point, I was prescribed medicine but I wanted to avoid that because of the side effects. That's when I discovered a program that literally pulled me out of that "hole". It is a natural method, i.e. without drugs. The key is that you should no longer fear the thought of anxiety. Get out of that loop. It works, it is drug free and I even re-gained my old self-confidence.<br>  <br>  Good luck!<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.stop-your-anxiety-now.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.stop-your-anxiety-now.com</a>|`|AA11610448	Like everything else, it depends on how bad you have it.  You can feel super hyper with an inability to pay attention.  You can think you're going to die.  You can have stomach problems, shaky hands, tight muscles, you can worry about the future and the past, you can feel like you can't do anything right.  All kinds of weird crap.  I am on a combo of wellbutrin and prozac and doing dbt to help with the haywire thinking.|`|ParFJxnSaa	There is a comprehensive quiz for it in section 6, below. Limit "worrying time" to around 45 mns, daily, possibly when you get home, or after your evening meal, but not too close to bedtime) after which, resolve firmly to refuse to worry again on that day: realise and accept that to do otherwise would be counterproductive to your mental health, and enjoyment of life. You will have had your "worry time" for the day, and can just write down any more thoughts that come to mind, and say to yourself: "Well, I'll just have to worry about that tomorrow, won't I?". It's important to regularly monitor, and deal with a negative internal monologue (self talk), or mental process, such as disturbing thoughts, images, impulses, or emotions, by the process of (a): recognising it, and (b): challenging it immediately. Technique For Re-Programming Negative Thoughts: When you notice something negative, such as: "I can't do this/ am never going to get over this!" or: "Why am I always so pathetic/useless/such a loser?" or even an image, emotion, or a memory; recognise that it is being generated from the negative part of your mind. Having identified and labelled it, visualise a large, red, flashing, "STOP!" sign, and/or possibly a stern faced person wagging an index finger at you in a negative manner, then say to yourself as forcefully as you can, even aloud in a big voice, if alone: "I know this tactic: GO AWAY FOR A WHILE !!!" You may want to use either: "ruse", "ploy", "game", or "trick". In the case of an image, visualise a large "STOP" sign, or your preferred version. <br>  <br>  Some people go so far as to keep a wide rubber band in their pocket, then put it around their wrist, when they catch themselves backsliding, stretch and release it, as a method of reprogramming their mind sooner, but I don't regard it as being strictly necessary. Remember to remove it, afterwards, if you use this method. Try replacing a negative thought with a positive affirmation of your choice, like: "I am a unique individual, with my own set of skills, and good points", or "I may not be perfect, but I'm doing the best I can, right now". Practice one of the relaxation methods in sections 2, 11, 2c, or 2i, daily, and when needed. Tai Chi, or yoga suits others better. Give the EFT a good tryout, to see if it helps you. There is a version for use in public places, (you can claim to have a headache, as you massage/lightly tap your temples, but you would then be restricted to subvocalising: saying it to yourself in your mind). Section 53, at <a href="http://www.ezy-build.net.nz/~shaneris" rel="nofollow">http://www.ezy-build.net.nz/~shaneris</a> refers: "Even though I sometimes suffer from anxiety, I deeply and completely accept myself." Or Google: "neurofeedback; therapists" Herbal remedies, such as chamomile, passionflower, or St.John's wort, are often effective, but the idea is (as with anxiolytic medication) to use them like water wings, or training wheels on a bicycle, providing initial support, and giving time for other treatments, such as therapy, and relaxation techniques, to take effect.|`|9EVcTnUWaa	It depends on how serious your anxiety is and how your anxiety expresses it's self, When I get really anxious my heart races, I sweat and I shake.  When my daughter gets really anxious she starts to shake really badly to the point where it looks like she's having an epileptic seizure.  I take buspar and she takes seroquel. the buspar works for me and keeps me calm and the seroquel works for her and keeps her calm. So a lot depends on how your anxiety manifests it's self.|`|tbeO3Lataa	Yes I do.<br>  <br>  It's hard to explain what it's like for me, because I don't have much to compare it to. My first major symptoms popped up when I was seven, so I don't remember much else. It sort of became a way of life, and after a while, I honestly thought I just couldn't handle things everyone else could. Starting school was impossible. I was in tears for weeks, and I had no idea my fast heart rate and on-and-off extreme symptoms were an anxiety attack. I thought it was just what I was going to live with my whole life. Vacations were hard, going to other people's houses was hard, any kind of change was damn near impossible. Then it all blew up on a vacation this past summer, when I literally thought I was not going to make it through life the way I was living it.<br>  <br>  I went to therapy, was told something was wrong with me and that I was in fact not just insane or a wimp, and am now on Lexapro which is a mild anti-anxiety med. I am SO much happier, and life is SO much easier. Now what terrifies me is thinking of how much time I spent not being diagnosed and treated.<br>  <br>  Do you have it?|`|PtqjRurnaa	Its like when your stressing over a test or something.  You feel like that most of the time.  And most of the time you haven't got a clue why.  And then you stress trying to figure it out. So its just all messed up.  I was put on Paxil been on it for 8 years just stopped it so well see how it goes.
exMPHWKHaa	don't worry benzodiazepine withdrawl syndrome is only after a coarse of months of addiction to the drug. You have taken some over the period of a day you are nowhere near to be going through a withdrawl. If you continued this for the next 3 months then yes you might have a problem but if not then you are fine. think about heroin withdrawl or any other drug these users spend a long amount of time using it before they build up any tolerance or any addiction to it. You are nowhere near this. you could do this routine for a week and still be fine.|`|f1ecdc0889f6df3d7bfbd8f5307091b3aa	I doubt it-I've been in VERY similar situation, there may be a little extra nervousness-but nothing major. If you're really worried tho-call the dr.|`|cebad5b46077e5b2866e0817f2c2e8caaa	First of all, I am not a medically trained professional but I have had experience with a lot of medications, worked in a pharmacy and many different physicians offices....therefore based on the link below and the information it provides, you haven't even taken the top dose prescribed so I would assume that it wouldn't make you have withdrawals per se.  <br>  <br>  Withdrawals usually occur when you have consistently consumed a medication or drug and there has been a build up of it in your system that when you stop, has to dissipate.  <br>  <br>  The website below indicates that it metabolites between 12 - 18 hours.  So after about 24 hours if you haven't had any adverse symptoms, its probably safe to say, you are ok.    <br>  <br>  Don't make it a habit, and if you feel you need to use benzo's please consult your physician to discuss prescribing them for you appropriately.|`|5XwY9aP8aa	Do NOT take anymore medications that aren't prescribed to you! It's not healthy!<br>  <br>  And just taking that little (although, could hurt you in the long run if you keep doing it) will not make you addicted, so you will not go through withdrawals.|`|g5vQYWrzaa	There isn't any withdrawals that I know if. The side effects are drowsiness. You allergies will come back.|`|5KjvNg2oaa	no|`|Ozu3yDMFaa	I doubt it, if it was a one time thing. But your question is a little confusing and vague. If you are not taking a benzo daily for a period of time (say you are just using it recreationally) you shouldn't have withdrawals. But recreational use can definitely lead to an addiction in which case you could have withdrawls and possibly seizures or death. A doctor should monitor the dosage and tapering off gradually is the best way to get off such medications. It almost sounds like you don't have a prescription of your own.Get to the doctor! If you have a condition that merits the use of these type of drugs your doc will prescribe them probably temporarily while you are adjusting to an SSRI or other maintenance drug for your specific mental health issues, assuming that is why you're taking them.
6PhSENcXaa	I have bipolar disorder and there is no tests, I did have the EEG test for other reasons done and the two different people that did this test on me from two different hospitals in different towns stated that I had bipolar disorder.  There was and abnormality on the test.  And nothing was written on my chart about me having bipolar, I asked to read my chart because I didn't believe the person when their said this to me.    But there is no real test to say you have bipolar disorder.  It's basically a question thing that I went through with 4 doctors and 3 psychiatrists and a counselor.|`|ZaVPaDGhaa	Its Bipolar, and no, there is test per se. A psychiatrist will try their best to determine wheter or not you are bipolar using various sources - some of which could be called tests, but there is no conslusive test you can take (such as a blood sample, or brain scan, or anything medical like that) which will tell you for sure whether you ar or not.  Try this    http://www.psycheducation.org/depression...|`|HNnVrvCfaa	I was inaccurately diagnosed as a depressive for half a dozen years (this is often the case, I have since learned, with bi-polar disorder as you only really seek treatment when you're feeling bad).  One day I went to the doctors and told the doctor every feeling, emotion, reaction that I could think of.  The doctor sent me to see a psychiatrist and the psychiatrist asked me a series of questions - from which he determined I had bipolar disorder.  I have been receiving treatment for this for several years.|`|gkqmrIAGaa	I can't imagine why some people are so awful.  I think there are some who sit at their computers on Answers just for the intention of being mean and cruel.  Ignore them who cares!  Regarding BiPolar there isn't a test you have to see a psychiatrist who is the specialist. When you seen one have a list of all of your symptoms, how it is affecting your life and describe what happens when you are depressed and what happens when you are manic. He will make the right diagnosis and treat you with the correct safe medications to help you get well.  Remember that some antidepressants work for some and not for others so if after 3 to 4 weeks you don't notice a difference it is time to try another one. Remember there is help and you don't have to suffer after having the right medications. The best to you and the last thing you need is someone who behaves awfully on this site they have a serious problem and need help themselves!|`|ZDMjuf4Taa	bipolar is a distressing mental illness for the sufferer and his family and friends, in order to get a true diagnosis you would need to be referred to a psychiatrist (via your gp) who would carry out a detailed assessment, today there are lots of treatments available to help that person live a life as normal as possible|`|60a3bbdca78e74fb19db426e27b9a087aa	Yes there are ways to diagnosis and it is Bi-Polar.

If you go speak with your doctor they can tell you if the things you are feeling and going through are symptoms or not.  Your best bet is to go speak with a doctor about it.|`|DDTiZRvzaa	I think...but sometimes you can tell. I did with my friend we just haven't told her that she is Bipoloar yet.................|`|aSWOtchuaa	You can go to http://checkupfromtheneckup.ca/quiz2/che... and go though the quiz there.  This is not a diagnostic tool, but meant to assist people when they think something may be wrong.  You can take the test and show the results to your doctor.    Please remember that only a qualified doctor can diagnose bipolar disorder.    Hope this helps!|`|UARTn2snaa	you can do personality tests in the internet but their not very valid or reliable. Anyway, someone with bipolar will have massive moodswings, and i dont just mean like a girl getting PMT. One day they can be severely depressed the next manic.

It's the same kind of shenanigans we see from pills that apparently get you slimmer and fit.|`|osY0xlhTaa	The answer is yes, but you have to be careful which method you choose.  Surgery is definitely the last resort - it's dangerous (possible complications include impotence), very expensive, and there are no guarantees that it will work. 60% of men who get it are unhappy with the results.    Penis enlargement pills are expensive, and don't really work - at best they will give you stronger erections, not extra size.    The one way that can work if you do it properly is penis enlargement exercises. There are 2 chambers in the penis which fill with blood to give you an erection, and once they are full, the penis can get no bigger. Because the exercises gradually increase the capacity of these chambers, they can then hold more blood, and this means that the penis will be longer and thicker.    You use only your hands, so it is also the safest method of enlargement. But it does take a bit of  work and commitment. There is a good site at http://www.biggerbetterman.com with lots more information about exercises and the other methods.|`|Eku8XD2Gaa	nothing can make your penis grow , it is completely genetic and if someone claims it then its got to be fake. read on the link below it will further clear your queries   http://www.socyberty.com/Sexuality/25-My...|`|Wdv2hUDaaa	Eat lots of Shrimp :)|`|ndlGyX0Waa	I HAVE BEEN TOLD THAT JELKIN WORKS, MAKE THE PROVE AND THEN TELL US.

An average non-erect penis ranges between 2 to 4 inches (5 to 10 cms).

When smokers inhale, that smoke gets into the cells of the lungs and the smell stays in the breath a long time so I'd concentrate on that since he could easily use the excuse that the cigarette smell you detect on his clothes is from being around his friends that smoke..."but Katie, I never smoked myself...honest!"<br>  <br>  One other sign could be if he chews a lot of gum when he's with you to try and cover up his smoker's breath.|`|7ZX3Ibz4aa	Beyond the fact that his breath will smell like smoke (unless he is now chewing gum or eating mints more than before) his clothing will smell like smoke, his hair etc.  While he could say he was around the smoke of his friends, the one tell tale sign is smell his hands (right hand if he is right handed)  It will truly smell alot of smoke/nicotine if he was holding a cigarette.<br>  <br>  Good luck to both of you|`|Bsimt0Dgaa	He smells like smoke.

upvLAyyzaa	Well I believe you could benefit from some counseling.  And yes, you can go to therapy for whatever concerns you, it doesn't have to be some huge disaster.  Many people are in therapy for depression and anxiety.  So if you're having trouble coping, I would recommend a therapist to help you learn to cope better with things in your life.|`|lxrQyQ5raa	I think you should go to therapy.  If you had a broken arm you would go to the doctor, you wouldn't try to fix it yourself correct?  So yes I do think therapy would be very helpful to you.  It's not something you should be ashamed of.  If it's causing a disruption in your life you need to correct it.  There is no such thing as a small problem.  I think therapy would help you continue with these goals and give you skills to learn on how to deal with stress, anxiety, and depression.  I go to therapy for Bipolar Disorder and yes I have medication but medication is only part of it.  Most of it comes from you and how you deal with problems.  DBT skills are excellent skills to learn for dealing with anxiety and depression and Bipolar.  Look up DBT skills on line.  They teach you a bunch of skills on how to deal with emotion regulation, mindfulness, distress tolerance, and anger.  Don't try to fix this yourself.  Especially when there is available help and many medications out there to pull you up.  Good Luck Sweetie.|`|KRJ7h8MYaa	If you feel as if you cannot control these emotions, then perhaps some form of therapy/counseling would do you good.<br>  <br>  I will try to help a bit though...I think one thing that might help you would be to set some shorter-term goals. Also, you need to make sure that these goals of yours are very well defined.<br>  <br>  For example, you could take up a sport, you're at the perfect stage to do so. And then with that, set short term goals with visible performance measures. For example, if it's tennis, maybe your goals could be to learn to play a consistent forehand and backhand in the first month, serve in the second month, etc, etc. You set goals in similar fashion for your studies (which should come first), volunteer work, etc.<br>  <br>  I never really had "issues" per se with my self-esteem and "social anxiety" but they were things that I could have improved upon at your age, and I did eventually, although it did take time as you would expect. I think your self-esteem issue will resolve itself once you have your goal-setting technique refined and under way - it's a matter of confidence in yourself for reaching the short-term goals, which will lead to the long-term goal. As for your social anxiety, my best advice to you (begetting from personal experience) is to just "force yourself." You can do that through playing a sport, engaging in volunteer activities, taking part in leadership camps, etc, etc. Any sort of activity requiring social interaction and the development of trust and in others, basically, will help your "social anxiety" issue solve itself. The only way you're going to solve it is by being tough within yourself and forcing yourself to interact with others. That's the advice my boss gave me during my internship a few months ago. "Force yourself" were her exact words.<br>  <br>  Ultimately seeing a therapist cannot hurt, can it? (Except for the $$$ in your pocket I guess...) But if you're looking for some sort of guideline to determine when you will or will not need therapy, it's ultimately when you feel that you cannot keep these emotions of depression under control. If you feel that it might be taking over your life, then...seeing a counselor might be the best idea. I would suggest that you talk to your parents/family first about this though.<br>  <br>  Good luck!
muHctmaGaa	Contraceptive sponges were briefly discontinued, but according to a feminist magazine I read, should return to the market in one to two years.|`|zF1MRdUFaa	From my personal experience I used the vaginal contraceptive for about six months before going on birth control. It seemed to work for me but some women say it works as well as water.  also another great way to avoid getting pregnant is by using ovulation test strips, most women use them to help them get pregnant but they also work to be a birth control in themselves don't have sex unprotected if you are ovulating.
Gw1LLzDgaa	You will get a lot of pleasure.    Your chance of prostate cancer will DECREASE (masturbating once a day or more reduces your risk of prostate cancer by more than a third, its very healthy for you)    You will become a better partner when you are having sex with someone.    Your penis will be somewhat larger than it would be if you didn't masturbate regularly (studies show that men who stop masturbating regularly have their penises shrink somewhat over time -- logically therefore, -- masturbating regularly makes penises grow somewhat over time.)    You will be happier and healthier as  a result.    That's it. There are no negatives, scientists looked for decades to find negatives, they never found any.  All the old myths were lies.

JjbragXNaa	Brushing with a hard brush won't take off your enamel, unless you're going crazy, but it can and will make your gums recede.  You should brush with a soft brush at least twice a day and floss daily.  My bottom teeth are very crowded (and I am so guilty of not flossing every day) that I get plaque build up right there.  I bought a dental pick, like a scraper, and I go over it very carefully and scrape all that off.  As far as the yellow teeth go, if you are properly taking care of your teeth and they're still yellow, you probably drink too much coffee or smoke too much.

If you do this plus go to the dentist every 6 months you shouldnt have stains on your teeth..if you smoke or drink a lot of tea or coffee I would recommend using the listerine whitening mouth wash twice a day (it really works)! Maybe you should check with your dentist to make sure you are brushing and flossing correctly (or if your too embarrassed to ask--then search for it online) Because I didnt know the proper way until I was 18!

(trust me, you will feel like you are dying if it is coming out of both ends and you are fatuged as hell)<br>  <br>  <br>  Let it run its course.The virus needs to shed out of your body and taking an anti diarrheal is NOT ideal so do use one.<br>  <br>  <br>  Drink plenty of water to stay hydrated.<br>  <br>  <br>  Prevention:<br>  <br>  Norwalk virus<br>  (Just remember that hand sanitizers will not kill this virus.House hold cleaners such as Lysol will also not kill you.You must use bleach.)<br>  <br>  The Norwalk virus causes viral Gastroenteritis which is known as the nasty 24 hour bug that causes explosive and sudden diarrhea and projectile vomiting.Usually non life threating but can cause complications in the very young,elderly and those with compromised immune systems.<br>  <br>  PREVENTION-Wash your hands before preparing food/eating food and most importantly, TOUCHING YOUR MOUTH/NOSE/EYES.<br>  <br>  The ONLY way to become infected with this virus is if you ingest the contaminated fecal/vomit particles through your eyes,nose and mouth.<br>  <br>  It is impossible to "breathe" in the virus BUT possible to become infected by breathing in aerosol "spray" droplets from someone vomiting right next to you.(the droplets settle within minuted but can still infect someone until cleaned with bleach)<br>  <br>  Even if your whole family breaks out with this virus, you can prevent it by washing your hands for at least 15-20 seconds with warm water and soap.Remember that you are not killing the virus, you are washing it down the drain even if you use an antibacterial soap (which only kills bacteria, not viruses) hand sanitizers are also not successful in killing the virus.<br>  <br>  If a member of your family comes down with the virus, let them know to wash their hands AFTER a bowel movement and vomiting.<br>  <br>  To clean infected areas, clean with BLEACH.Clean bathrooms (all infected areas) with a bleach solution as soon as possible and be sure to prevent cross contamination and wash your hands afterwards.Especially children! wipe down all commonly touched objects like door knobs, faucet handles, light switches, toilet flushers etc.<br>  <br>  People are STILL contagious even after 24 hours after their symptoms settle down so it is always important to wash your hands after the rest room (which you should do anyways!)<br>  <br>  The key to staying Norwalk virus free is to keep sanitary.Wash your hands after using the bathroom...you could prevent other peoples misery as well as yours!!<br>  <br>  TIPS:Do not share any cups/plates/utensils with an infected person and be sure to wash in a bleach solution to prevent cross contamination with the rest of your family.|`|niLvdq0Qaa	You are not going to die--just feel like it. You do not say if you ate something which made you have this, or if you have the flu, have a fever??  How long have you had it??<br>  This will pass--if it does not  see your doctor.<br>  Drink lots of fluids-to replace what you are loosing in the loose stools.<br>  You can always try the BRAT diet.<br>  Good luck|`|zw6EJ2izaa	Well you already got rid of the stomach flu because there is no such thing (Influenza is respiratory disease).  For diarrhea some Pepto Bismol should help, make sure to drink plenty of fluids to prevent dehydration.

F1OIGwtBaa	Instant detox is a very dangerous goal. Depending on the depth of your body's need for detox, the most effective is slow and gentle.<br>  <br>  There are many, many effective colon cleanses on the market. To be sufficiently complete AND gentle, you'd want to take a product that takes a minimum of two weeks. The best I've personally used is 'Manna Cleanse' by Manna tech.com. It's a 2 month program, very slow, gentle and complete. It does not keep you tethered to a commode as it doesn't give you runs or excessive gas.<br>  <br>  For liver cleanse, milk thistle is generally the most trusted herb on the market.<br>  <br>  As another comment mentioned, there are many teas that are excellent for detox.<br>   - alfalfa tea has many health benefits, including detox: <br>   - licorice root is a natural sweetener (does not taste like black licorice candy) and aids in detoxing liver and blood.<br>   - Ginger root improves digestion and liver function and stimulates circulation.<br>   - peppermint tea aids in digestion and adds excellent flavor to teas.<br>  I put one of each of these teabags in a 12 cup coffee pot and brew the full pot. Leave the tea bags to steep for 30 minutes or more. This can be consumed hot or over ice. If you like more sweetener, use stevia leaf. It's a plant leaf and will not have a negative effect on the value of an all herbal tea. <br>  All of these teas are available at vitacost.com for far less than you can get in the health food stores. Look for 'Alvita' brand for quality and value.<br>  <br>  There are many other detox teas out there, but I've found the above to be very effective, gentle and very tasty. You could also get each of the above teas in capsule form (omit the peppermint) and take as directed.<br>  <br>  Another way to gently and thoroughly detox your body is by adding quality digestive enzymes to your daily routine. I take one daily that includes lipase (for fats), protease (protein) and amylase (carbs) with my biggest meal of the day. When I go to bed at night, I take one capsule of just protease to help break down protein matter that has built up in my arteries and/or intestine. Each of the products above cost about $10 at the links below and each will last 4-6 months. Not bad! <br>  <a href="http://www.vitacost.com/Source-Naturals-Vegetarian-Pancreatin-475-mg-120-Capsules" rel="nofollow">http://www.vitacost.com/Source-Naturals-...</a><br>  <a href="http://www.vitacost.com/NSI-BioCore-Pro-Digestive-Systemic-Enzymes-w-Bromelain" rel="nofollow">http://www.vitacost.com/NSI-BioCore-Pro-...</a><br>  <br>  Detoxing the body (whether slow or fast) can cause discomfort that may include any of the following:<br>  -many trips to the restroom<br>  -offensive smells (gas and poo) as your body eliminates old and putrid matter from the intestinal tract<br>  -a little nausea<br>  - slightly achy joints<br>  - stronger than normal persperation (as toxins are eliminated through the skin)<br>  These effects are temporary as your body cleans itself out. The faster you detox, the more likely you are to experience stronger side effects.<br>  <br>  I hope you'll look into whole and complete detox as a longer term venture.<br>  <br>  God Bless.|`|df7e0a98adad7376c2265d7ad4d45e2faa	Detox - rubbish, Didn't you read all that research recently that told you it's all a waste of money?

F1OIGwtBaa	Aloe contains a phytonutrient called mannose that every cell in the human body requires to function properly. With our processed, fast food, nutrient-depleted, chemical farming culture, we do not get enough (if any) of this and several other necessary phyto nutrients. Aloe will replenish this precious nutrient, allowing every cell in your body to function more efficiently.<br>  <br>  The biggest problem with consuming aloe juice is that mannose degrades very quickly after the aloe is harvested (within 48 hours). There is a process that only 2 companies use to stabilize mannose, making this nutrient readily available to the body. One of those companies is Mannatech.com - awesome products! The other is a product called Manapol available on many sites. All of these products are natural, organic, and perfectly safe - + very beneficial. <br>  <br>  I would be wary of spending my hard-earned dime on seemingly less expensive products that end up having little or no nutritional value.<br>  <br>  God Bless.|`|Gmf3rCibaa	Aloe vera also very very good for metabolism, throat, colon, antioxidant, fire and knife injury, so put that pot plant near your kitchen.|`|vb0FO6k0aa	Pl check this post<br>  <a href="http://myblogonbeauty.blogspot.com/2006/06/aloevera-wonder-herb.html" rel="nofollow">http://myblogonbeauty.blogspot.com/2006/...</a>|`|umqWDs5Aaa	aloe vera in all forms is great for skin/skin conditions no matter what form its in!|`|IkT27czcaa	its good for al sorts of things. bites, sunburn, scars stuff like that|`|xkRBxGrKaa	It's good for when you get a sunburn|`|YS4wfSaJaa	The juice from it can help a bug bite itch.

You should tell your mom, so she can help if needed.|`|AA10975334	Sounds like it. You really should tell your mother.

It is caused by the candida species of fungus, usually Candida albicans.<br>  <br>  Thrush most commonly affects women in their thirties and forties, and those who are pregnant. Many women are affected by vaginal thrush at some point in their lives and, in some women, it recurs regularly.<br>  <br>  Candida albicans is naturally found in the vagina and is harmless. However, when it multiplies it can cause irritation and swelling of the vagina and vulva. In the majority of cases thrush can be treated effectively.<br>  <br>  It is not known what makes some women more prone to thrush than others, but women with poorly controlled diabetes or a seriously damaged immune system have an increased risk of developing the condition.<br>  <br>  Just order some canasten over the internet from an online chemist like Boots.|`|6tOK3STZaa	yupp sounds like a yeats infection. <br>  and it WONT go away on its own. <br>  chances are, your mom has probably had quite a few in her lifetime because they are very common. just say "mom, i think i have a yeast infection." she will take you to the doctor, you will tell her your symptoms, and she may or may not look "down there" to make sure, and then she will give you a pill to take for a few days, and it will go away and you will feel a LOT better. its really no biggie, people get them all the time.<br>  <br>  good luck :)|`|3wcVA7RIaa	Yes, you could have a yeast infection (caused by fungus) or you could have a infection caused by bacteria.

VsaEOX9vaa	I don't think that there is a way to actually prevent cancer. There are many causes of cancer, including an hereditary disposition to it nd you can't do much about that, except some women have their breasts and reproductive system removed at an early age if their mother and others in the family  contracted breasts or ovarian cancer.<br>  <br>  There are known carcinogens and you can find these listed on the Web. Of course, about the worst is tobacco as cigarettes/cigars/pipe/chewing and snuff. Dope is another, causing mouth, throat, lung and other cancers. Theses are the most common cancers, mostly caused by smoking tobacco & dope.<br>  <br>  You can help towards preventing cancer in your body by not smoking, by drinking alcohol in SMALL quantities, by eating as few processed foods as possible and by eating lots of fresh vegetables, particularly green leafy varieties and veg that have carotene. Tomatoes are great anti-oxidants.<br>  <br>  Your doctor or pharmacist would be able to help you.<br>  <br>  Basically, commonsense prevails. If you keep healthy, eat properly, don't smoke, don't drink too much alcohol (can cause mouth and throat and stomach and liver and bowel cancer) you can give yourself a fighting chance .|`|TudZYPN5aa	There is no way to prevent cancer.<br>  <br>  There are some simple ways to avoid it, however.<br>  <br>  To avoid, and even prevent skin cancer (basal cells are usually harmless, melanoma kills) stay out of the sun, or if you're going into the sun for more than 30 minutes, wear sunscreen that is 40 spf or above.<br>  <br>  Other cancers just come randomly, to random people.  There isn't a way to get rid of it, or prevent it.  The most "preventable" is skin cancer, but even people with sensitive skin such as red heads (who often have fair skin) get it easily.|`|FgXnEYZBaa	There's really no way to prevent cancer it's just caused by a mutation in your cells.<br>  <br>  Pesticides-can also cause lymphoma & leukemia<br>  <br>  Tobacco smoke: A well-known carcinogen that can harm you even if you don't smoke but are simply exposed to it.<br>  <br>  Toronto Smog: A well-known fact that the air we breathed has numerous carcinogens.|`|OjXvYEZDaa	There is no way to prevent cancer even no best cures apart from having chemo|`|d456069f8e03a8bf7a79de76c7e45228aa	No one knows what causes cancer . . if we did than it could be prevented. No one knows why a person who has never smoked in their life can still get lung cancer . .and no one knows why someone who may have smoked their entire life might never even get cancer.

No one knows why one person exposed to a 'risk' for cancer will never develop it while someone else might. <br>  <br>  There is no known way to prevent cancer . . there are ways that people believe will cut down the risk of developing it for only one type of cancer.

2wMMAKpOaa	It sounds like a bloody UTI (urinary tract infection). These can be spread to your partner. I wouldn't count on a condom. They are not always reliable and you never know when a fluid slips out or even if there is the tiniest of tears in there. Don't have sex until both of you get checked.|`|AoUUfzXgaa	I wouldn't have sex with him any more until you go to the doctor and get it checked out. May be some disease or some STD.|`|B1iBGRzUaa	Wow, tell him to go to the doctor, that cant be good|`|WMc3UIXsaa	does it sound normal? no? then it probably isn't normal.<br>  if none of his blood gets inside of you, then you should be ok. <br>  force him go to the doctor's cause this actually sounds pretty serious.|`|x1KRxDuGaa	He should go to the doctor. It might be and STD. It is better to get checked and be negative than not getting checked and being positive.|`|mMGQCGMsaa	No.  NOT normal.  He could have a very bad bladder infection, a kidney infection, etc.  He needs to see a doctor.|`|vVJsoxc2aa	I would definitely suggest he goes to the doctor.  Bleeding from the penis is never, ever a good sign.  There are many things that can be wrong, go asap.

pa7hVLAHaa	Supplements such as multi-vitamins should be secondary to proper nutrition from food unless to supplement a deficiency condition.  <br>  <br>  A key issue to consider when taking supplements is their absorption.  Many popular multi-vitamins on the market are not well absorbed by the human body.  You'll end up paying money for the supplements and just excreting them with your urine or stool.  <br>  <br>  Do some research before purchasing multi-vitamins.  Vitamins that come from whole-food sources are usually the most absrobable and typically don't upset the stomach and/or cause allergic reactions.  In addition they usually don't have preservatives, or synthetic coloring which could be toxic.|`|1Q0ZnVdaaa	What most people don't know is that with ordinary over the counter vitamins, you are only absorbing about 10% of the minerals.  I had to do an extensive search for the right vitamin where I will always absorb 85% from here on out.  Whether male or female, be sure you take the suggested dose.  this is a tricky question because there are many supplements to choose from that would give you what you need but I wouldn't suggest not eating.  Also, vitamins are more effective when taken with a tall glass of water.  Your getting started at a great age, don't ever give it up.|`|3kCQDUUGaa	You sound like me.. i take a multi-vitamin...I hardly eat any vegies or frut so i guess taking this will be beter then nothing right??|`|exMPHWKHaa	Theres not much of a need to take vitamin pills especially at your age. I am 17 also and you won't notice anything different unless you are severely deprived of vitamins. The most you will feel is a placebo effect. Don't waste your money you'll be fine. The only thing I take is fish oil which is supposed to help anti depressants work but it isn't really. Good luck/
RMfmw4n1aa	heres a good muscle workout <a href="http://gladstone.uoregon.edu/~bhurley/images/horror.gif?" rel="nofollow">http://gladstone.uoregon.edu/~bhurley/im...</a>|`|6sPcYQr0aa	Diet.<br>  It doesn’t really matter what you eat (besides the obvious junk food) and when you eat it, as long as it has the nutrients your body needs and you give it to your body when it needs it.  You cant forget protein, which is not only a main building block for your body but for your mind as well. I will explain.<br>  One of the worst things you can do to your body is stop eating. Your body needs fuel just like your car needs fuel. And just like your car, the better the fuel and oil is, the better the cars performance, the better the food and liquid is that you put in your body with too make you "run" better.<br>  If you are trying to lose fat. Try to raise your metabolism by eating smaller meals, more nutritious meals, and about five or six meals throughout the day.<br>  Also, remember that if you are working out you are also building muscle, and muscle weighs more than fat does. So as you lose the fat and gain the muscle your weight might not adjust for a while until your muscle building reaches a plateau and your body begins to really tare away fat.<br>  If you do not want to eat five or six small meals a day. Eat three meals a day, smaller portions, then between breakfast and lunch have a healthy snack or meal replacement shake, and another between lunch and dinner.<br>  The idea is to teach your body to get rid of all extra fuel it doesn’t need, which are fats, carbs, and simple sugars for the most part. And once your body begins to understand that you are giving it the fuel it needs when it needs it, then your body will no longer store fat cells as a fuel reserve.<br>  It is also a good idea to use a body cleanser, or detoxify before beginning any change in diet. Especially if you are going to begin eating healthier. The process might cause head aches or muscle cramps depending on what your body has become used to. Also diarrhea is a common side effect of most cleansing programs, but don’t worry this is a sign that your body is getting rid of the toxic substances. The cleans will help your body to easily extract the nutrients it needs from the food you intake and bypass the rest as waste.<br>  To expedite the process it always helps to concentrate on full body workouts to keep energy storage empty. Also, drink water, water is used to clean your body inside and out. Stay away from caffeine and soda.<br>  This will take time. But once you are able to achieve routine with your eating habits it is one of the easiest ways to keep the fat off.<br>  So with this, your diet can be very flexible as well. You can have sweets and things but for best results I would stay away from all simple sugars, like candy.<br>  Good luck and God bless.

The only sure thing I can say is that the iron in the vitamins may turn your poop green. Gross, I know, but true! And if you take too much iron or protein, that is dangerous, so beware! You should talk to your doctor about what you need and other concerns. If I would recommend ANYTHING, take omega-3 fish oil and V-8 juice!|`|kMIzNpEsaa	ooooooh my god. yeah, but MAKE SURE YOU DO NOT OVERDOSE!!!!! especially on iron, you can die. or OD-ing on other stuff can make your hair fall out....its bad. and also some nutrients simply do not get absorbed very well, so even if the bottle says you are getting 100% daily value of something, you could in reality only be getting a small fraction of it. you should do some research because some foods like avocado help absorb these vitamins better.|`|NPMKqJlMaa	no dangerous side effects of taking multi vits<br>  just remember to drink plenty of water after it, as it can become kidney stones!
63c6ad890d0828ff609c53ea0a1378e0aa	Is the blood dark, like it comes from deep within the body. Sounds like Acute Pylonephritis. You need to see your family doctor pronto, and get this treated. He can tell from a urine sample.|`|PRzmwFfgaa	RUN to a hospital!!!!!|`|2a03b86b4608a88a1b5104413c857ac3aa	No it won't. No water means no "pee". Blood come from infection or inflammation. More water means more urine and that's what it takes to make your kidneys work best. Not enough water, your eye's dry out, you don't sweat and your mouth dries up. MORE water neans everything gets back to normal and works properly.<br>  You need at least 64 ounces of fluid daily (more in the summer) to remain properly hydrated.
8ovTppsAaa	Sorry no.  Colour coded equipment,thermal imaging equipment,gas bottle necks and flame type recognition are just some of the reasons why perfect colour vision is essential by the nature of the job.    There are 28 applicants for every single post in the fire service,so even if perfect colour vision was not essential then there would still be candidates with more merit.

This is something you need to discuss with your doctor.  Why are you concerned about someone finding out you had Leukemia?    A blood test will only show if the Leukemia has recurred.

ZbMLigR3aa	She needs to see her doctor.  The effects of loestrin in the dose she it took may actually make her ill.  To take the morning after pill on top of that probably would not be a good idea.  The reason you'd want to take this up with a physician is to ensure that nothing bad happens to your girlfriend.  If she is pregnant it is just too early to tell yet.   The doctor will advise her on her options at this point in time.
AEqOczcCaa	I know that if you try to hold your pee in for too long, you'll just let it all out eventually so I doubt that you'd die from voluntarily holding it in.

pqnEavSyaa	Flat feet (or low/fallen arches) can lead to over-pronation, a biomechanical imbalance that may cause serious problems over time.  When people who suffer from over-pronation stand or walk, the arches collapse with every step they take, and the ankles roll inwards.  Pronation itself is not wrong as we need to pronate and supinate as part of our gait. Pronation (rolling in) acts as a shock-absorbing process and supination (rolling out) helps to propel our feet forward.<br>  <br>  Flat feet or fallen arches may lead to uncomfortable, and even painful conditions such as plantar fasciitis and heel spurs. The most effective treatment solution for over-pronation is to wear an orthotic shoe insert.<br>  <br>  For more information please refer to links below.

If the tooth needs to be extracted then this will fall under the same price band.  Privately a filling starts from 40/50 upwards depending on the size of the filling needed. You will need to have a check up before he can do the filling, a private check up starts from 35 upwards.

BIyiOgPYaa	Birth control basically works two ways:<br>  <br>  1) It prevents ovulation, which means you won't release an egg. If you have no eggs to fertilize, then you will have no baby.<br>  2) On the very, very rare chance breakthrough ovulation occurs while on the pill, your cervical mucus will thicken, making it nearly impossible for the egg to implant into your uterus, which means a baby will not be able to grow.<br>  <br>  If you take birth control every day at the same time and have no medications that interfere (such as antibiotics), you will not get pregnant.|`|c5WFme5Jaa	Yes it should be fine as long as you take it at the same time everyday and go on the breaks when you need to. Make sure you definitely know he's STD free though because, let's be honest people sometimes just guess that kind of thing and I've seen my friends make that mistake.<br>  <br>  Also you should use condoms if you ever need to use antibiotics as they make the pill ineffective. That's how most people get pregnant on the pill.|`|G6Snxhwmaa	As long as you have been taking it for more than one month and you take it properly (same time every day) you should be fine.

DjircW6waa	As far as the armpit hair goes, you are very lucky.  You may never get much, particularly if you're blond like your avatar.  Your vaginal discharge as well as the smell will vary according to all sorts of factors from hormonal changes in your body to even your diet.  Sometimes it could be an indication of an infection or presence of bacteria, but I wouldn't worry unless you notice pain or itching.  You do have larger than average up on top for your age, but perfectly normal.  Make sure you do plenty of exercises both for your back and your abdominals to support your gifts.|`|eef0fd7a18ed1e8ac453b6086f666edfaa	Key word your still young, as you get older it will happen.|`|1yGDFTieaa	Women develop at all different rates, whilst most girls do have underarm hair by the time they're 16, there are some who don't.<br>  <br>  Sounds like a yeast infection.<br>  <br>  Nope, if you're overweight you will have larger boobs, but otherwise there isn't much you can do about them if larger breasts are passed down the family.|`|PDYiwb3Raa	Nothing is wrong with you.

I could go for ages without shaving because there wasn't enough there. I never minded in the least, not having it.|`|2wMMAKpOaa	About the discharge thing you could have a yeast infection. But yeast infections don't cause an odor, that sounds more like BV (bacterial vaginosis). It's not an STD it's just when the bacteria in your vagina is not in order. This won't go away on it's own and needs to be checked. Secondly about the period, since you're young it'll fluctuate a lot. Don't worry, it'll straighten out in a few years. Hope this helped ;)|`|0be2fe08ce298863b7b8d7b8ccc0b8a9aa	The discharge sounds something like a yeast infection. Discharge is normal but should not have a heavy odor or be yellowish.

QzlFON84aa	Hold your virginity not for a religion but for self respect.|`|XtHsBlJKaa	This is a choice you need to make by yourself without anyone's help. But I think a man you plan to marry would respect you more if you were a virgin. If you decided to loose your virginity always be protected, Lots of STDs out there and plus you  want to adopt instead of have children of your own.   Another thing to keep in mind, Don't sleep with to many guys, you will get a bad reputation and then sex will be the only reason men talk to you.

BnR4LLhxaa	john e gave you great details about the A1c testing.<br>  <br>  I tried one of the home tests once. The particular kit contains a lancing device, so you poke your finger with it, and put enough drops of blood onto a special absorbent paper from the kit to cover three small circles that are printed on the paper. Wait a few minutes for the blood to dry; seal it up; put it into the envelope they provide and send it off.<br>  <br>  I think that the results from this one test were reasonably accurate in comparison to standard lab tests that I have had. My main complaint was that it took more than a month to get the results back. Not very useful if you want to know how any recent lifestyle changes have affected the blood glucose levels.<br>  <br>  I have seen that the companies who make the kits claim that the labs are all certified and so on, but who knows. The only way for you to really evaluate them would be to get a bunch of kits from different labs, get blood samples for all of them at the same time to send in, then also get blood drawn a standard A1c test, through a doctor's lab test request.<br>  <br>  When you get all of the results, compare them.|`|7oYpbSjIaa	you don't have diabetes but you're here everyday asking questions about it.  that's so weird.  anyway, an a1c test is just like every other blood test.|`|c8ebe8705eaf13a28547213ca1de8013aa	The full name of the test is glycated (not glycosylated!) hemoglobin A1C.  The surface of many molecules in the body are 'sticky' meaning that glucose will attach itself to the surface.  Erythrocytes (red blood cells) have an average life span of around 90 days.  The A1C determines the % of erythrocytes that are glycated.  The higher the average glucose in your blood the higher the A1C.  Although the relationship between mean (average) 90 day glucose and A1C is not linear but there is a simple way to approximate the mean 90 day glucose.  An A1C of 6% is about 120 mg/dL (6.7 mmol/L - the US is the only country that uses its own set of laboratory values) and every 0.1% increase in the A1C implies approximately a 3 mg/dL (0.2 mmol/L) increase in the mean glucose.  Thus an A1C of 7% approximates a 90 day mean glucose of 150 mg/dL (8.3 mmol/L) and an A1C of 8% approximates a 90 day mean glucose of 180 mg/dL (10 mmol/L) and so on.  The A1C test that you are referring to does not require you to draw blood.  It does require a drop of blood obtained by pricking your finger in the same manner that a diabetic tests their glucose on a regular basis.  The test is quite simple to use and at this point it appears to be reasonably accurate.  I wish you the very best of health.

You simply MUST tell your current lover so he can seek testing and treatment.  You simply tell him, you've found out that you have chlamydia from your last boyfriend and he should get tested.

You should definitely tell him, but let him know the risk is almost nil because you were protected with him.    These are the risks of having sex with anyone, and it's irresponsible NOT to tell someone you're infected, especially since death, infertility, and lifelong illness are potential results.

And, he could go to the doctors and get a check-up to be on the safe side, even though he has only a 2% chance of contracting it.  Also, if he freaks out and runs from you, it tells you that he's not a reasonable or strong person and you don't want him as a boyfriend anyway ; )|`|AA10572259	I think you need to tell him the truth.  If you end up staying with him and he finds out later that could really hurt your relationship.  I'm not sure what the best way to tell him is.  When I first started dating my husband, over 8 years ago, about a month into our relationship I got a phone call saying that he had been to the doctor and tested positive for a STD.  He had just broken up with someone.  I was understanding about it.  I don't think that a phone call is the best choice though.  He did make sure we kept using condoms after that until we were very serious and I was on birth control.  I would sit down with him to tell him.  Somewhere in private so if he does get upset you don't have people watching you.  Just be honest with him.  If he already knows your past then it shouldn't be a big problem.  If he does get upset and doesn't want to see you anymore its his loss.
vkrQ29lOaa	No, not at all, but when urine first exits the body, it is more clean than a lot of other liquids around us. If there is no disease in a person's body that can be carried by urine, then the urine is, from an emergency standpoint, "safe" to drink and to be used to rinse out a wound. That said, however, anyone would be taking huge risks in using urine for such purposes outside the most desperate circumstances. And even then it would be almost unthinkable, and certainly it would be cause for a lawsuit, say in a desert, for one man to use his own urine to wash another person's wound or to keep someone from dying of thirst. Goddess protect us from such circumstances!|`|3c606c504872e24f874ab51f4295f617aa	yes, i asked a doctor many years ago and he said it was sterile, and could be used to clean out a wound if no other cleaner was available.

6mSfRjpxaa	Infectious mononucleosis (mono) is often called the kissing disease. The virus that causes mono is transmitted through saliva, so you can get it through kissing, but you can also be exposed through a cough or sneeze, or by sharing a glass or food utensil with someone who has mono. However, mononucleosis isn't as contagious as some infections, such as the common cold.    Signs and symptoms of mononucleosis may include:    Fatigue  Weakness  Sore throat, perhaps a strep throat that doesn't get better with antibiotics   Fever  Swollen lymph nodes in your neck and armpits  Swollen tonsils  Headache  Skin rash  Loss of appetite  Soft, swollen spleen  Night sweats  The virus typically has an incubation period of four to eight weeks, although in young children this period is shorter. Signs and symptoms such as fever and sore throat usually lessen within a couple of weeks, although fatigue, enlarged lymph nodes and a swollen spleen may last for a few weeks longer.
AA12266052	Pathogen means any disease-producing agent or microorganism. The Bacteria are a large group of unicellular microorganisms. Pathogenic bacteria are bacteria that cause infectious diseases.  Although the vast majority of bacteria are harmless or beneficial, quite a few bacteria are pathogenic. The most common bacterial disease is tuberculosis, caused by the bacterium Mycobacterium tuberculosis, which kills about 2 million people a year, mostly in sub-Saharan Africa. Pathogenic bacteria contribute to other globally important diseases, such as pneumonia, which can be caused by bacteria such as Streptococcus and Pseudomonas, and foodborne illnesses, which can be caused by bacteria such as Shigella, Campylobacter and Salmonella.

You can decrease the amount of time you smoke per week gradually until you're down to once a week. Then it should be a lot easier. But just make sure you keep your goal in mind, and you don't end up getting back into your old smoking 4-5 times a day smoking habit|`|PMPUQvUZaa	just chill run and get some more exercise dont go back to smoking because thats how you got into this predicament. but just exercise and go see a doctor about any treatment or rehabilitation|`|aCDWwsisaa	See a doctor.    THC is vaso- & bronchio-dilator, and you are not using it any more, so your veins and lungs are probably constricting...|`|3pFOHj8Oaa	Marijuana has tar like Cigarettes, and causes many of the same side effects - but if you run regularly it'll go away eventually like cigarette smoking.    Smoking 4 joints in a day is like smoking a pack of filtered cigs in a day.|`|IzHfbWtiaa	A lot of your symptoms of withdrawal are common, especially when there is a sudden abstinence of what ever the addiction might be and as you have indicated,marijuana is your demon! Part of your problem could be in part psychological but I would advise you to seek a professional opinion and assistance in the continuous existence of withdrawals,whether they be literal or psychosomatic! Best wishes and God Bless! It may seem hopeless today,but you can do it! Take 1 spoon full of confidence,1 spoon full of courage, 1 spoon full of will power! Mix well, add 1 cup of determination and sprinkle generously with hope! Take a sip every 4 hours as needed,prayer may be added for extra power! Use extreme caution if Luck is incorporated as the side effects may be hazardous! Most common side effects are >disappointment-grief,anger,and can feel like a complete failure! I hope that I have given you some reassurance,but for total reassurance you must talk to our Father in Heaven!  You may want to consult with a Pulmonologist for the breathing problem!|`|f8mLpPXlaa	It's smoking it that causes the shortness of breath not quitting. Get into a rehab program. You'll find out that there is life afetr drug use. And a much better life.|`|Vz08qkNeaa	no, that's a side affect of the smoking. The smoke contains tar, which damages your lungs' ability to function. It's only temporary, though. Your immune system removes the tar over time.|`|2gUBpC62aa	Some say that Marijuana can help Asthma.  This is extremely unverified, but perhaps you lungs became used to your habit and now you are suffering the withdrawal.  There is another yahoo answer that says that smoking 1 joint equals 5 cigarettes... but lets be honest, either way, its best just to stop.  Give yourself some time to adjust, but if your breathing gets any worse, go to doctor to get looked at.  You may need an inhaler.  Good luck!!
fXj2kVpPaa	I had septoplasty and  turbinate reduction surgery -- it really wasn't too bad.  They send you home, but not with packing...just a gauze moustache.

Good luck!|`|ec76af399c519dad926a10430304f541aa	these are questions you should have asked your doctor, and should still ask him BEFORE the procedure.|`|bdc0c1d1aead267282553512169a9932aa	how about you ask the Dr...thats what they go to school for and you should have asked when you went for your appt.|`|YfvWZM6faa	PAINNNN
b1feaaa978d115c4f2ff497d30752baaaa	I would try this workout. At the same time you will be gaining muscule and burning fat. So its awesome.       WHAT YOU'LL NEED: Two 5 pounds weights.  * means one 5 pound weight in each hand.    If you don't have two 5 pound weights try using water bottles full of water.      Workout:  Stretch  *20 Bench Press x3   20 squats x3  *20 side arm lifts x3  20 crunches x3  20 push-ups x3  *20 lunges x3  20 leg lifts x3  Walk for 30 mins  Stretch    Stretching before your workout helps you not to pull a muscule during your workout.    Stretching after your workout helps you not be AS sore afterward.     I try to do this everyday, but I'm sure you would get results doing this only 2-4 days a week. I recomend everyday.      Eat 1500 calories a day and drink 8 glasses of water daily.    You will lose weight and tone up!      I've lost 6 pounds and I've only been doing it for a week!      You can do it! i know you can!    You will be sore. and it will hurt but you can do it.    Don't be scared to add more excercises of more reps.      Hope this works for you!      Can you email me and tell me what a stone is?  Anyone, please?  volleystar1992@yahoo.com

XYQAxq6Iaa	Soda is really bad for your teeth even without braces.<br>  <br>  It won't, you know, DISSOLVE your teeth like that old urban legend, but that amount of sugar and other such chemicals can have a detrimental effect over time.<br>  <br>  Just be sure to brush your teeth really well, clean your brackets, and try to limit your soda drinking.|`|XxZQ72J4aa	Yes. The only reasons there are limitations on what you can eat while wearing braces is that some foods are hard or sticky and can cause the brackets or wires to break. Soda is really sugary, and plaque is a greater concern with braces, so just make sure you brush your teeth really well. Good luck!|`|OQIP89zuaa	I did, don't see why you can't<br>  <br>  Do brush your teeth really well though, under, above, inside everywhere around the brackets!!

5Co6baBmaa	What you're experiencing isn't normal, nor is it abnormal.  What you have actually done is stretched or even torn some of the ligaments that hold everything together.  Creaking is okay, so long as it isn't a grinding sensation you're feeling.  You should be okay for hitting drills, but expect some discomfort when it comes time for all the pushing, pulling, throwing of blockers and everything else that comes with.  BE CAREFUL !! Shoulder injuries are those types that just seem to stay with you for life.  Listen to your body.|`|87ad5d03bbd53bdda171d10bef721abbaa	that massive bump from all appearances is your head.
zVWhcbI6aa	tonsil stone, defintiley.|`|BdlGBdE5aa	There is such a thing as a tonsil stone. It is an indentation in your tonsil that fills up with stuff and hardens and then when it comes out it smells because it is full of bacteria.  However, this is unusual or rarely happens.  Most bad breath comes from the bacteria that live on the top of your tongue.  You can often see this bacteria by looking at your tongue, especially on the back of your tongue.  Most of the time this bacteria is white in color although it can be colored.  To cure bad breath you must clean the tongue with a tongue cleaner.  The one I recommend is OraBrush: <a href="http://www.orabrush.com/halitosis.php" rel="nofollow">http://www.orabrush.com/halitosis.php</a>|`|01Mu3wUeaa	More than likely, it is a tonsil stone.Basically, its a "sac" full of mucous and bacteria.<br>  <br>  Pictures:<br>  <a href="http://images.google.com/images?sourceid=navclient&rls=GWYA,GWYA:2008-50,GWYA:en&q=tonsil%20stone&um=1&ie=UTF-8&sa=N&hl=en&tab=wi" rel="nofollow">http://images.google.com/images?sourceid...</a><br>  <br>  Information:<br>  <a href="http://www.webmd.com/oral-health/tonsil-stones-tonsilloliths-treatment-and-prevention" rel="nofollow">http://www.webmd.com/oral-health/tonsil-...</a>|`|1b6c195ba207883a224264d44c013600aa	Tonsil 'stones' or 'oysters'.

13kMNf0faa	Chances are you could have a growth spurt within the next 5-7 years. One of my high school teachers said she stopped growing in the 5th grade I think, the joke around the class was that we could draw her life-size on the blackboard :) Anyway 5'8" isn't all that short, it's not as if you look like a lawn gnome.|`|dBoC8fR2aa	You don't expect your body to keep on growing upwards every year, definitely you can always grow sideways. If you are expecting an inch a year, at the age of 21 years, you will be 6' 1". Why should you be depressed over things you cannot control. What happen to people who are just 5' 6" tall? Did they commit suicide? So carry on living and be happy with what you are.|`|EM0kiImHaa	This is completely possible. My brother didn't grow an inch after he was 15. He was 6'3'' then and he's 6'3'' now. I'm kinda the same way. I'm 15 (almost 16) and I've barely grown at all. Average height for males is 5'7'' so don't worry.|`|QBUypAmAaa	Sometimes in puberty you will plateau, doesn't happen to everyone, but it does happen nonetheless. As for me, I stopped growing in everything at 14, I was 5'3 and a half then, then I started back up at 18, now I'm almost 5'8" and I'm still not done with puberty and I'm almost 21.<br>  <br>  -KH|`|02UeNiisaa	dude, you are only sixteen. you still have at least 5 more years to grow. For guys it usually comes in growth spurts. maybe the next one is just taking awhile. so don't stress it. you aren't short for your age, and i doubt you are done growing. plus it is nothing you can control so don't worry too much about it.|`|WdGmsSrMaa	Boys usually grow the most (height) from the age of 17 - 22 . Don't worry about it, you're not finished growing, man!  :)|`|OUtEtm2vaa	chill fool your gonna grow more i thought the same thing too but i grew and i keep growing so dont trip|`|xRQAsGRAaa	That happened to me. At age 16 I was 5'8, and now I'm 19 and 5'8 1/2. The doctor said it was because of Accutane, since it stunts your growth. It's not that bad though, because I'm still taller than most girls. So unless you're a basketball player I wouldn't worry about it.|`|2cIceMVdaa	That is not bad at all...well i am 5'9 and im 13...so i guess i would not know:)<br>  <br>  But i have oen thing.as long as you are taller than most girls than your perfectly fine and most guys avr.at 5'7-6+|`|cqwQbHqfaa	5 foot 8 is a good height plus i was 5 foot 4 at 15 the same at 16 now im 5 foot 11 at nearly 18

EFYxcWNyaa	if you have visited a dentist after the pain started and they have taken xrays and still they can not find anything wrong with your sinuses then it is something else. have you been under stress lately? do you feel you grind your teeth when you sleep? do you feel your cheeks are soar when you wake up in the morning? when does the pain start? how long doe it last?<br>  <br>  part 2: you might be grinding on your teeth on left side during your sleep especially if you are under some sort of stress right now. you can try occlusal gaurd when you are sleeping and that can help you. your dentist can make you one custom made or you can try over the counter ones outside which they are not as good and sometimes can cause more harm. talk to your dentist about this being a possible cause. I experienced something similar few months ago and I had to take some xrays to be sure it is not cavities which it wasn't. I think I was just under too much stress and I was grinding on my teeth during that time. mine went away after a couple weeks. Good Luck.
B0nTbAkwaa	Yeah this guy my sister knew was 5'3" when he was fifteen and then he experienced a huge growth spurt when he was sixteen so he know stands at 5'8". Don't worry you'll probably have a growth spurt and grow taller! And she's probably not going to be six foot lol I was 5'7" at thirteen and now I stand at 5'10" and I'm 14...I'm not growing anymore lol.|`|WdGmsSrMaa	Nah, I stopped growing when I was 12, and I'm only 5'5 now.<br>  <br>  I started dating my boyfriend when he was 17, and he was 5'5 also.<br>  <br>  He's now 20, and he's 5'8. He's taller than me.<br>  <br>  Don't assume you'll stop dating, she could already be done growing! :)<br>  <br>  Also, height isn't all that matters though either.

XNc5moJEaa	With all 4 wisdom teeth, a full mouth has a total of 32 teeth. Most people don't get the wisdom teeth until late teens early twenties.  Your question is vague.  Is your 14th one coming in on the bottom?  How old are you?  If you are young and it is your 14th, it's probably hurting because it's pushing through your gum.  It never hurts to talk w a dentist though.  <br>  <br>  By age 12, most start getting all of their adult teeth in. NOT including their wisdom teeth.<br>  <br>  Oh, well then that tooth may be erupting late.  See your dentist.  He can tell you after viewing the xrays if everything is okay.  It still may not be your wisdom tooth though.  w wisdom teeth you have 3 big molars in the back on upper R, L and lower R, L and 2 little molars following. He/ she can tell you what tooth is what.  Some people don't even have wisdom teeth and a lot of people have wisdom teeth that are impacted or never erupt.  <br>  <br>  Absolutely go to the dentist|`|AA11783467	From what you've described it sounds like a wisdom tooth. This has been happening to me too. It hurts some, yeah, but for me the pain goes away after only a day or so.|`|rGMv0AMtaa	You have 14 teeth on each bridge until you enter your later teens, then you develop your third molars (wisdom teeth). This makes it 16 teeth per arch, or 32 all together.  Most people have their 3rd molars removed because there isn't enough room, and they can lead to infections and crowding of your other teeth.  You problem could be a wisdom tooth pushing up on your 2nd molar which creates the discomfort.  It will only get worse if you don't go to the dentist.  It could also be an infection, or abscess tooth.  Either way, the dentist can diagnosis.|`|uUB6X8Khaa	I think it depend how old you are, since you are probably over 7 then it most likely is your wisdom tooth because your other teeth should already be there...

It is only seen in those with congenital heart defects, acquired injury to the coronary arteries due to infection, and familial dyslipidemia.  If you had a congenital heart defect your physician should have been able to determine this simply by listening to your heart.  By your age I am confident that someone has listened to your heart more than once.  Acquired injury is associated with an impressive infection that would not go unnoticed by yourself or by your physician.  If you have familial dyslipidemia you would have multiple family members with heart attacks at an 'early' age.  Based upon this it is extremely unlikely that your chest pain is related to your heart.  It may be due to costochondritis as someone has suggested.  This is a common condition of unknown cause which never leads to harm.  Pleurisy is very uncommon.  There are other sources of chest wall pain involving intercostal muscles and nerves which will lead to pain when you breath in as your are expanding your chest and 'rotating' your ribs.  Anxiety, asthma, and gastroesophageal reflux disease are also possibilities.  None of these are truly serious and they do not lead to permanent harm.  Thus there is not need for excessive worry although you and I would both be relieved if a physician made a specific diagnosis.  One visit without testing should be sufficient to make a diagnosis.  I wish you the very best of health.

It just depends on the severity of the allergy. Some people will just sneeze and other people's throats can close up. What people are actually allergic to is a protein in the cat's saliva. When they lick themselves to clean themselves, it gets on the fur. That's why most people think it's just the hair they're allergic to. If you dare to bathe the cat before your cousin comes over, that could help too. If not, just tell them to take some allergy medicine beforehand if their allergies are not severe.

(: but i know pads are icky and gross especially in those tiny stalls with your bag and jacket and everything.<br>  <br>  oh and im assuming during summer periods, a tampon will make you feel lighters than a pad. (:<br>  <br>  TAMPONS (:|`|o13oejiuaa	I personally prefer tampons! Once I was having a heavy period and my pad overflowed and you know, NASTY! I have never had hat happen with tampons. I also feel like my vagina breaths, with pads it feels trapped, EWWW! TAMPONS ALL THE WAY!|`|Mglfxm16aa	you should wear tampons. Unless you wear lots of perfume, pads start to smell (because you sweat down there, and you can smell the discharge)|`|rQ01LFVpaa	Ok well if you have gym u would probably like tampons better but i mean tampons are easier to hide like taking with you than pads.

eb603a32531b733c208d6a3685da0228aa	No, glasses don't heal the eyes except in certain cases- like with lazy eye or a wandering eye.  If the problem with your eyesight lies with the lens though, glasses do not do anything to change that.  Glasses only change where the image focuses within the eye, so that the image is focused where it should be.  There are exercises to improve sight, but those only work if the problem is due to troubles with the muscles of the eye themselves.  You can't exercise a lens.  If you have a lens focus problem, really bad ones can be corrected with surgery in some cases.  Unfortunately the surgery comes with no promises that you will return to perfect vision- only that it will improve.  That's why it's usually only done for people with such poor vision that they are basically blind without the glasses.  Your only other options are glasses or contacts, to enjoy "perfect" vision.  Chill, a good many people wear glasses or contacts.   At least you do see, and can see perfectly with the assistance of glasses.  It beats being blind entirely.|`|Q4oPyclQaa	No.  There's no exercises for things like myopia (which is what most common eye disorder is).  Glasses don't heal them.  <br>  <br>  Normal eye disorders are not about your eyes being weak - that's when you get old and can't read without bifocals or reading glasses.  If you have that, it's probably too late to do any exercises, and I don't even know if they exist in the first place... it's a normal part of aging.<br>  <br>  Most eye problems happen from a wrong curvature of the eye, which means that the picture you are looking at focuses on the wrong spot in your eye.  Instead of focusing on the retina, it focuses in front of it or behind it.  Does that sound like something that can be fixed by exercises?  No... it's just a part of who you are and the shape of your eye.<br>  <br>  You can have LASEK eye surgery which fixes the curviature of the eye.  That's about it, if you want normal eyes.<br>  <br>  Don't feel bad... I have -10 sphere in each eye..|`|gUWcvxzuaa	Lenses only correct your vision. Laser surgery is the only way to return your vision to 'normal'.|`|ZA18KoC9aa	There are exercises especially the near/far focusing ones that can help improve vision. Also read up on the Bates method and using glasses that are slightly below your actual prescription- under-correction helps with improvement as it forces the eyes to bring into focus a slightly blurry image. Just google natural vision improvement to find out more about these programs!|`|IBJHXCJPaa	No, because your eyes get used to being able to see with help. So your eyes weaken.|`|J0xyUHxIaa	no they don't the only way to get better eyesight is eye surgery|`|sxsb78Kzaa	They dont heal your eyes all they do is help you see better, it doesnt make your eye degree go up or down it will stay the same, but for me my degree went down somehow. I suggest taking a break from the computer and tv, You cup your hands over your bare,closed  eyes, your nose should be exposed, do this for 3 minutes and you will feel much better.|`|mMGQCGMsaa	No.  But don't have the surgery.  People I know who have had it have started having vision problems again with a year or two; and you can never wear contacts again b/c the surgery changes the shape of your eye.|`|q0oynj9Faa	From what I know glasses don't heal your eyes and there really isn't a way to heal them unless you get eye surgery or the like....|`|sbXdcurtaa	No they don't, I believe they make your eyes worse and you are more independent on them every day. The more you wear them the more you will be indepent on them.. if u wanna fix your eyes.. try LASIK or Ortho-k

It can become active at any time (making it possible to spread) and also may cause Burkitt's Lymphoma.|`|XYQAxq6Iaa	The mono virus can still be remotely active even after you don't feel sick anymore.<br>  <br>  Be aware that after you have mono you will always carry the virus, and though you might not get sick anymore, the virus can become active and infect someone else.<br>  <br>  Not to say you can't EVER kiss again, I'd say wait a week after you've stopped feeling sick and it'll probably be in it's disabled stage once again, there's always a small chance that open mouth kissing may infect someone.<br>  <br>  Also be aware that it's saliva swapping that really spreads mono, so a closed peck on the lips shouldn't be a problem.

Z8Prgkl6aa	i think i've been through something similar, feeling withdrawn from an old friend.<br>  <br>  the point is that you have to move on with your life, and you can't live in the past. you have to do what's best for you. it might be hard to be withdrawn, but honestly, you have to consider where you are at in your life. not to sound stuck-up, but do you really have time for it? i mean, people change. it's clear that you changed what you want out of friendships, and if that's not offered with the lost friendship you're dealing with now, then it's okay. life goes on, and friends grow distant. it's a fact of life.|`|syYV8JH1aa	Yes.|`|J0xyUHxIaa	I have and you shouldn't be worried about yourself being anti social has its downfalls everyone says that I am on the path of self destruction but anti social people live very happy lives|`|cebad5b46077e5b2866e0817f2c2e8caaa	I think its normal to experience a withdrawal of sorts when you have had some negative experiences with people.  It tends to make you a bit jaded and more cautious about becoming so invested in others.  <br>  <br>  Not to mention if you have had a lot of things going on in your life, or the other person has, they may have been caught up in that situation, and we all only have so many hours in a day, it doesn't necessarily mean that one doesn't care for the other.  <br>  <br>  We each take risks in developing relationships with anyone.  We entrust our feelings to them, depending on how close we are.  It is something we learn as we grow though.  We learn where it is appropriate to have boundaries with people and how soon we open up more.  <br>  <br>  Its always good to be a bit cautious with anyone at first, but when you know what qualities to look for in someone who is going to be trustworthy and has personal integrity and character, you can determine they may be safe to get closer with. <br>  <br>  And you will find that friendships wax and wane.  Some completely disappear and others come back together after a while.  But always remember you are in control of who you allow in your comfort zone and who you don't.  By becoming self aware we learn what we need from others and what kind of people we want to surround ourselves with.  <br>  <br>  I hope it works out for you either way!
6sPcYQr0aa	It doesn’t really matter what you eat (besides the obvious junk food) and when you eat it, as long as it has the nutrients your body needs and you give it to your body when it needs it.  You cant forget protein, which is not only a main building block for your body but for your mind as well. I will explain.<br>  One of the worst things you can do to your body is stop eating. Your body needs fuel just like your car needs fuel. And just like your car, the better the fuel and oil is, the better the cars performance, the better the food and liquid is that you put in your body with too make you "run" better.<br>  If you are trying to lose fat. Try to raise your metabolism by eating smaller meals, more nutritious meals, and about five or six meals throughout the day.<br>  Also, remember that if you are working out you are also building muscle, and muscle weighs more than fat does. So as you lose the fat and gain the muscle your weight might not adjust for a while until your muscle building reaches a plateau and your body begins to really tare away fat.<br>  If you do not want to eat five or six small meals a day. Eat three meals a day, smaller portions, then between breakfast and lunch have a healthy snack or meal replacement shake, and another between lunch and dinner.<br>  The idea is to teach your body to get rid of all extra fuel it doesn’t need, which are fats, carbs, and simple sugars for the most part. And once your body begins to understand that you are giving it the fuel it needs when it needs it, then your body will no longer store fat cells as a fuel reserve.<br>  It is also a good idea to use a body cleanser, or detoxify before beginning any change in diet. Especially if you are going to begin eating healthier. The process might cause head aches or muscle cramps depending on what your body has become used to. Also diarrhea is a common side effect of most cleansing programs, but don’t worry this is a sign that your body is getting rid of the toxic substances. The cleans will help your body to easily extract the nutrients it needs from the food you intake and bypass the rest as waste.<br>  To expedite the process it always helps to concentrate on full body workouts to keep energy storage empty. Also, drink water, water is used to clean your body inside and out. Stay away from caffeine and soda.<br>  This will take time. But once you are able to achieve routine with your eating habits it is one of the easiest ways to keep the fat off.<br>  So with this, your diet can be very flexible as well. You can have sweets and things but for best results I would stay away from all simple sugars, like candy.<br>  Good luck and God bless.|`|DCJRsR25aa	hello..<br>  <br>  if you want read something about healthy,diet fitness and weight lose..<br>  i come just accross this blog : <a href="http://easy--ways-to-lose-weight.blogspot.com" rel="nofollow">http://easy--ways-to-lose-weight.blogspo...</a> which may help you.<br>  <br>  other link to resourch:<a href="http://healthy-weight-loss-diets.blogspot.com" rel="nofollow">http://healthy-weight-loss-diets.blogspo...</a>|`|YI9d2k6Iaa	Here is where you can read a good article called "Top Ten Principles and Tips for Weight Loss"  <br>  <a href="http://www.weightlossfatloss.us/ten_weightloss_tips.asp" rel="nofollow">http://www.weightlossfatloss.us/ten_weig...</a><br>  They are good tips that work.|`|9BNHNcDbaa	my bro does wrestling and has to drop weight like that, he runs like crazy and jumpropes with sweats on.

And if you do opt for liposuction, having had such a recent surgery would likely temporarily disqualify you for boot camp. So, you're stuck with fasting until you leave for boot camp.<br>  <br>  Mase has some good points about the proper ways to lose weight, but the fact remains that unless you stop eating you're unlikely to lose enough weight. Even if you do stop eating, you still might not lose enough.<br>  <br>  2. Exercise every waking hour. <br>  <br>  This doesn't have to be running, but 30 minutes to two hours per day of running will help. If you're currently not a runner, walking fast for 15 hours per day should get you all of the exercise you can handle and may need. Be sure you keep yourself properly hydrated. Drink lots of water.<br>  <br>  The rule of thumb is that it's unhealthy to lose more than two pounds per week without a doctor's direct supervision. Your goal is way beyond that. Realistically, you may well have to push back the date you report to boot camp.<br>  <br>  Hang in there though. Ask your recruiter for suggestions. The Navy doesn't want to lose you before you even get in.

cnyU6KXzaa	As far as when to take it, right after you lift, it helps rebuild muscle. However, Whey is one way of getting protein if you are doing a heavy lift, but it is not the healthiest option. I lift heavy so I take some whey, but not just whey, after a workout I pop a can of solid white albacore tuna and eat it straight with salt and pepper. Salmon is also excellent. beef and eggs, chicken are good sources as well. Also WATER WATER WATER! I guarantee you don't drink enough of it, pound it down all the time. Without water, whey can damage your kidneys as well. Also, take a multivitamin, this is often overlooked but is extremely important.<br>  <br>  -Chris Buege|`|wwRbkCMraa	Usually losing weight is simple numbers. You need to know your basic metabolic rate (BMR). Once you know your BMR then you can design a diet lower in calories than your BMR.<br>  <br>  But.... it is not always that simple.

EobQv52saa	Puss only occurs when there is an infection. It results from white blood cells that have interacted with bacteria that need to be destroyed. Infections can be spread from other people or they can occur easily if you are a contact lens wearer that has kept a pair of disposable lenses too long or if you haven't been taking them out and soaking them in disinfectant saline. There are several important things you should do. One of the most important is to make sure your hands are extremely clean and that you wipe down anything you've touched around the house with something like a Clorox wipe. You don't want this to spread to anyone else. Also, make sure you don't touch your other eye or you put it at risk for infection too. Pink eye is a possibility but there are other common infections as well. You need to be seen immediately by an optometrist or opthalmologist. Waiting could result in things worsening. Doctors usually give you drops that have to be administered a few times a day. Just don't touch the tip of the bottle to your eye so that you don't contaminate it. If you are a contact lens wearer stop wearing the lenses and throw them away. Throw away the cases and solutions as well. Start wearing glasses until the infection clears up.|`|W1zI2jbLaa	you probaly have pink eye, go see a doctor and don't touch your eye.<br>  go wash the eye off with a towel and warm water. <br>  change your pillow case too!<br>  wash your hands frequently too!|`|Nj0CWRq5aa	It could be a few things.

DFJ9m4WKaa	Its total baloney. Did you even read the articles? They are totally biased and supported by homeopathic operations that support specific religious practices. For example the article by Dr. Sayeed Ahmad was originally published by BJain publications. The company is owned by Jainist (a religion found mainly in India), known for strict lifestyle of celibacy among other, sometimes extreme, practices. <br>  <br>  And again did you even read the articles? Both talk are clearly biased. One article refers to masturbation "as an evil act" and refers to it several times as such. Neither support their claims with any legitimate facts or figures. Neither even attempt to try to support their claims with anything concrete. As far as I am concerned, they are the opinions of the author's and made to look legitimate by being featured on web sites that deal with modern new age and homeopathic philosophies - not sciences, philosophies.<br>  <br>  I have studied human sexuality for a long long time. I can tell you there is ample evidence out there that masturbation is a perfectly normal human behavior that the majority of both genders practice. <br>  <br>  The only way you over do it is if you're really doing it a lot (like 10+ times a day) or rubbing yourself raw constantly, and not allowing yourself to heal. <br>  <br>  Finally if there were any serious side affects of casual masturbation, they would be FAR more publicized and credible. Both sites at the bottom say either these statements are not evaluated by the FDA or that you should not take it as professional medical advice.<br>  <br>  Don't be so gullible.|`|AA10475412	There are no bad effects in masturbation.|`|vTra7n5baa	Check the objectivity of those sources.

They told me that drugs and alcohol effect chemicals in the brain and make them Unbalanced!|`|jg9w6IbQaa	i learned in psych that drinking kills a ton of brain cells or something. i think. <br>  <br>  i'm kind of confused with what your asking.. of course they can have an affect on a developing brain. i think with all the drugs i did last year i ****** my brain up. i'm not sure if that'll help you.
GUSGvveEaa	Don't worry alot of people have braces in jr. high and that doesn't nessicarly mean that you'll get them off in college, college is a pretty long way off, frist think of them in high school, and also keep in mind how long your dentist said that they would be on and how fast your teeth change. Everybodies teeth are different most likely if you have crowding it usually won't mean that you would have to wear them all throughout jr. high, high school and collage|`|Qe9EULsdaa	Don't even worry. I got my braces in spring of eighth grade and got them off in january of my sophomore year. Trust me it is not a big deal at all. My best friend is getting her braces on in a few days and she's a 16 year old junior. She'll have braces for prom, senior banquet, senior pictures, graduation, college! You are lucky and you have no idea how soon this really is in your life. Also I noticed movement in my teeth within the first two months of my braces.|`|mPsNadNUaa	ive heard you could have them from 1 year to 4 years it depends on how bad your teeth are|`|W2FR0suEaa	you cant decide when to get them off--your orthodontist is the person who decides how long they need to be on. the average length for wearing braces is normally 2 years...so you might have them off before college depending on when in the school year that you got them on. but dont worry about it...alot of people have braces in highschool.|`|rrhXebgIaa	I honestly don't think you will have them in college unless you have major problems. But other than that i wouldn't worry about it. Just think of the after effect and it will be worth it no matter how long you have to have them on.... :D|`|VlzlPAEwaa	don;t worry about it, in school, people will think you have money...all is good|`|LQ82KNlNaa	yeah it depends how messed your teeth are to begin with... but braces move the teeth pretty quickly!
W2z5dCrmaa	Hey Dude<br>  <br>  Lighten up on yourself Man. I'm 24, and married for 2 years now. We Make love on an average of 1 to 3 times per day and have an amazing Love Life.<br>  <br>  Sex like anything else in life isn't perfect. What I mean is that something can throw you off and you can go down when you want to be up! Hahaha!<br>  <br>  That happens to us the odd time, and the first one freaked me out and got me all frustrated because I knew what I wanted my Dick to do and I couldn't make it do it. I got all scared because I didn't have control of the situation and there was absolutely nothing that I could do to make it go different with my sex.<br>  <br>  That was new for me and really scary. I became obsessed with it too, and the more uptight I got, the worse it became as I tried to do it more and more while I as up tight. I got mad, I wondered if it was my Ladies fault and was thinking of what it was that she might have done. I got mad at her because she wasn't seemingly as worried as I was and that sex wasn't important to her. Haha!   .... until the crazed notion came along that I was done and it would never be like it was b4.<br>  <br>  I finally settled down and left it alone for about 4 days, and found that I couldn't stand going without any longer, and it was right back to where it had been.<br>  <br>  Sure your a good Dude, but that has nothing to do with it Man! Hahaha! I have come to realize that this is normal the odd time, and there's 100 and some reasons why it can happen.<br>  <br>  Getting super horny, not carrying through, and then trying it 3 hours later can even cause it! Testosterone spikes, your body senses it and the pituitary gland causes the surplus testosterone to get synthesized into estrogen. Your testosterone shoots down temporarily, and you think that your Dick is going to cooperate with you now after making it wait? Not! Hahaha! By the way this illustration is how the body deals with surplus testosterone to keep it within the level that the body will allow. It's like an auto thermostat.<br>  <br>  Eating a heavy greasy meal or overeating can take blood from your Dude activity and tie it up for digestion. Think your gear is going to perform for you now? Not!<br>  <br>  Trying to tell you Dude, that is normal, and it will happen the odd time all your life. <br>  Sex like everything else in life is imperfect and has glitches like this If you don't let it bend your brain, and just give it a rest when this happens, until you can't stand the desire anymore, you always come back in powerful form and it doesn't happen again soon.<br>  You learn too what shuts you down. Like don't play around a bunch until you feel crazed in wanting it, and then put it off until later. Start when you both mean business and let if flow to completion<br>  <br>  Your going to be good man, just trust what I'm saying, and in a couple days, it will be You! :- ) again.<br>  <br>  Take care Dude<br>  <br>  Me! :- )<br>  <br>  You and Acid 09 must be brothers! Hahaha! almost the same face Man !|`|u8CJFHPcaa	maybe only once it doesn't matter, keep your confidence. since you said you've done well before then you can do it again.|`|c1JxLlYaaa	Do about an hour of foreplay, try an make your gf *** before you start having sex so it gives you abit more confidence, and even if you still lose it, your gf will still be happy :)|`|mYWeII5Zaa	sorrry old man your penis will fall off, na only joking try asking a doctor?|`|DFJ9m4WKaa	you need to give yourself time. Try no to rush into things. If you loose your erection, kiss, make out, cuddle go down on her. But allow yourself to relax and regain your erection. Anxiety kills your libido and it can ruin your ability to have an erection. So calm yourself down and try to allow yourself to reduce those stress hormones. Again, just take your time and don't worry about it. And when I mean take your time I mean literally give yourself an hour or two if that is what it takes.<br>  <br>  If you're obsessing about it constantly, it is possible you may have an anxiety disorder. Now that doesn't mean go to a doctor and get some pretty little pills because its obvious the source of the anxiety rests with your girlfriend. And you deal with that by seeing a professional. <br>  <br>  If you're going to college maybe talk with your school counselor or get in touch with the psych department and see if anyone is willing to give you some time. Or, if you can afford it, see a professional therapist. Something like this can usually be resolved in just a few sessions. Much cheaper than years of drugs, if you go to a regular doctor.

This is to allow her to breathe during the surgery, as it goes into the trachea.  It can and usually does cause a minor sore throat after the surgery.  She needs to be checked out by an otolaryngolist (an ear, nose, and throat specialist), to see what is going on.  Three months is way too long.|`|qi88afqYaa	My sister was like that.Her voice was hoarse from that thing they stick down your throat during surgery.|`|XHWSLF9Xaa	it will come back with time . maybe after a week

f8mLpPXlaa	Yeah a positive test just means you have been exposed at some time in your life. It doesn't mean you have the disease. If your immune system were to take a crash dive it could flare up. But that's in patients that have HIV or AIDS. That's why it shows up so much in them. If the chest x ray in normal then they probably won't put you on the antibiotics.  And it's six month course unless you are not responding and then they'll extend for three more months.<br>  By the way it's not a virus. it's what's called an acid fast bacillus. Viruses are not amenable to antibiotics.<br>  God bless and help everything turn out well for you.|`|QvF8dR7Taa	if the doctor gives you antibiotics take all of them and don't quit because you start feeling better,it might come back with a vengeance and the antibiotics wont work any more,you have to make sure its completely gone.|`|Bsimt0Dgaa	Hey man,<br>  <br>  I was tested positive for TB as well.  I took the regiment of antibiotics.  While I was on the medication, I went to see a nutritionist.  I got some great advise about diet that would help me strengthen my immune system and help my liver get more "toned".  At the end of the antibiotics, I had a final blood test to check out my liver enzymes.  Everything was fine.<br>  <br>  I continue to eat really well, and exercise daily (a result of it becoming a habit).<br>  <br>  So getting TB and paying more attention to what my body needs to be healthy, I am now in better shape and feel So much better than before I even had it!<br>  <br>  Go see a natural-path or a homoeopath.  Tell them your situation, and see what they recommend you do if you decide to start taking the medication from your doctor.<br>  <br>  Good luck with this.  Remember, the more you know about your options, the better, more informed decision you can make about your health.  And id you feel more confident about your decision, the better you will heal and feel.|`|WkcPWmR9aa	this post might add information for you about TB<br>  <a href="http://www.promdinurses.com/2008/10/tuberculosis.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.promdinurses.com/2008/10/tube...</a>|`|S6bsdP1Vaa	im a future cna (as by my name) and this was a question on my midterm.  <br>  <br>  A postive TB test first off means that you have the Turburcolosis germ in your body.  It doesnt mean you have TB necessairly but will probably in the future<br>  <br>  It is common, yet uncommon too.  The more you are around different people the higher chance of getting it.  if you are fairly isolate then you will probably not get it easily.  TB is spread through airborne droplets weather it be talking, coughing, sneezing, singing. etc.<br>  <br>  It is probably good to take antibiotics even with the serious side effects on them.  This is by far as i know the only treatment..and if you dun wanna end up with TB later in life then you should take them.  There is a possibility to one avoid it and two fix the liver damage if you get it!<br>  <br>  This is my best advice!
Z19gRYZwaa	It's possible. If you have rheumatoid arthritis there will be rheumatoid factors in your blood, in which case the blood work should clear it up. It is possible to have non rheumatoid autoimmune arthritis, so if the blood work doesn't show RF that's not conclusive. IF it is arthritis, then yes, the hockey is likely to damage the joints if you do it while they are inflamed. Keep in mind that it could be other things too, and don't get settled mentally into one diagnosis right away. Good luck: I hope you have an accurate diagnosis soon.|`|WkcPWmR9aa	rheumatoid arthritis is an inflammatory response disease, try to learn more at <a href="http://www.promdinurses.com/2009/01/diseases-and-conditions-rheumatoid.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.promdinurses.com/2009/01/dise...</a>

c8ebe8705eaf13a28547213ca1de8013aa	To be perfectly honest most physicians and nurses do not take blood pressure readings properly and the equipment available in pharmacies is notoriously unreliable.  I wrote an article on how to take a blood pressure properly.  I will be happy to send it to you but it does require some medical knowledge to understand it.  Blood pressure follows a diurnal circadian variation.  This means that it is lowest during sleep and that it rises upon awakening reaching a peak at about 11 AM after which it declines reaching a second peak - usually not as high - at about 4 PM.  There is a fair amount of variation between people but the guiding principle is sound.  There are many variables that may increase the blood pressure reading.  If you are in a rush or are stressed, if you consumed caffeine within 30 minutes of the reading, if you do not sit for 10 minutes prior to taking the blood pressure - the reading will most likely be 10 points higher than your 'true' blood pressure.  Again - improper technique is common and may result in falsely high as well as falsely low readings.  We have fairly standard goals for those age 25 and older - a first thing in the AM reading of 115/075 or less.  Cardiovascular risk doubles for every 20/10 increase in blood pressure above that so a person with a 1st thing in the morning blood pressure of 135/085 has double the cardiovascular risk of someone with a reading of 115/075 or less.  At age 16 we do not have such a well defined goal.  Instead - there are 'normograms' which you can easily find on the internet.  These are based on age and sex and give guidelines based on percentile rankings.  Anyone with a blood pressure above the 95th percentile certainly warrants having their blood pressure taken by a properly trained individual.  As a caveat I have always used so-called 'mercury' blood pressure units.  These do not require calibration.  Aneroid units have 'needles' on a dial.  Approximately 15% of aneroid blood pressure units in physician's offices are out of calibration and by definition inaccurate.  Another flaw in blood pressure measurement is that nurses too often use 'cheap' stethoscopes which transmit sound poorly.  In addition these stethoscopes do not detect low frequency sounds.  The sound that defines the upper number in a blood pressure reading is very soft and at a low frequency and therefore very often missed.  I wish you the very best of health.|`|I2Hh3kRQaa	not to worry
eF6HTt0gaa	I agree with Eli's mommie- tylenol first and alternate hot packs, they actually help release the tightened muscle faster then a cold pack would. Cold packs are more for sprained ankles and such. For the back you want heat. But if its still tight like it is now, contact the chiropracter they even might suggest a physical therapist visit for strenghtening excersises. I know I have seen both for similar situations and they where a big help. But I was a dancer so..lol|`|0QYIbn1saa	Poor thing!  My first thought was muscle, you probably just moved it in a funky way.   I would try extra strength tylenol in the mean time, muscle relaxer later on combined with ice.|`|FvYqKZSMaa	I agree maybe you moved it the wrong way.I have done the same thing.Yes extra strength Tylenol may work.

Running or walking uphill or on the treadmill is very good too and will also help you with that muffin top.     (Also, don't spend $60 on a fanny lifter. Go to wal-mart and get a step stool about 12-18 inches high for $9.)|`|aXnVFFUkaa	yes i see what you mean, running will be good and add some lunges and squats to your routine|`|FNeCDm3raa	You don't look bad at all.    But, if you want to tone, running alone won't do it. It will burn fat, which is great, but you need to do some special thigh/butt resistance training.    I suggest you go out and buy some specific workout DVDs that target those areas. I have a few, and they really, really work. And since you are already at a good weight, you'll see results in about 6 weeks as long as you are consistent. So, that means doing the workouts about 2/3 times a week in addition to the running. And keeping it up long after you have seen results.     Good luck.    ETA: Step aerobics is a good way to firm the bottom half.|`|lXOkRTPaaa	Climbing stairs is good for that.|`|QCTy1iaEaa	Most exercises won't do anything for the butt, you need to work very specific muscles.

So you need to get rid of fat too (which takes care of cellulite as well). Look for specific butt workouts, i.e. http://www.firmbuttexercises.com/workout... and others.
rm5Nt2VEaa	It could depend on various different things.  One being your eye color but also it depends on how your eyes react to the drops and the strength of them.  I had eye surgery and my eyes stayed dilated for three months!  Now considering you didn't have surgery it will probably be fine when you wake up. <br>  <br>  Depending on the time of my regular visits my eyes are back to normal during the night time or morning.  I wouldn't be too worried about it, especially if your eyes were fine.|`|UriE3wN6aa	dont worry everyone is different i had an appt. a few weeks ago at 10 am and mine didnt go away til like 8 that night so dont worry if it doesn tgo away by morning then i would maybe call and see whats up but dont worry tonight!|`|Nj0CWRq5aa	It depends on the type of dilating drop they used. Usually it last about 6-8 hours. If you are under 16 then the drop could last for the rest of the night. Right now it is letting more light in so yes I agree it is uncomfortable! I guess I need to maybe start a survey at work with the patients to see if the eye color does make a difference.|`|EvzrcBhDaa	dont worry im always at the eye doctor gettin my eyes dilated.<br>  <br>  it does depend on eye color.<br>  <br>  it should be back to normal by tomarrow,<br>  i wouldnt get to stressed about it.
QODJNf1oaa	Well, first of all I just want to say good for you that you gained the weight back, I know that it must've been something that was really hard to do. The only thing that you can do is just put it into perspective and say to yourself that it's okay, you will get back onto your routine once you get better and that you'll work out twice as hard.
Ow2ZM7EYaa	I have Fibromialgia.  I was prescribed medication and it didn't work.  I then was given sleeping pills so I could rest.  I did not like the feeling sleeping pills gave me.      The only thing that has truly worked for me is a nutritional product called Nutrazon.  You only take 2 to 8 oz a day for a month depending on problems.  After that just 2 to 4 oz a day. It actually helps with a lot of things such as joint inflammation and also focus.  You can check the product out at www.nutrazon.com/wnewman.  It will give you all the ingredients and what each can do for you.      Good luck.  I felt your pain.|`|c11aa6f60a1539d5467335708ac1ed21aa	i'm on disability for it and i get percocet for it and it helps. also soma to relax the muscles and ease the pain. talk to a doctor who understands what you are going through. you may need to see a neurologist to get the meds that you need. good luck and hang in there.|`|IIvnrK0Naa	my mom has fibromialgia and has to take pain medicine for it (percocet) continually. talk to your doctor about your options.|`|k5bT9kjDaa	Here's an audio file on Limu Plus....

Fibromyalgia, also known as fibrositis or fibromyositis, refers to a disorder of unknown cause that is characterized by recurrent pain in the joints, muscles or tendons. Often small, specific area called "trigger points" are tender to the touch. Physical strain and cold or damp weather can make the disorder worse. Frequently the pain is associated with other symptoms, such as insomnia, fatigue or anxiety. Laboratory tests are usually normal. There are several treatment: physical therapy, warm or cold compresses, anti-inflammatory medication and sometimes an anesthetic or cortisone injected directly into the trigger points, The symptoms can wax and wane over many years. And good luck.|`|d2AzNKEFaa	I would go back to the md or rheumatologist who specializes in joint pain - they will probably start you on prednisone which is a cortisone pill that is an anti-inflammatory - you can also try cherry juice - this also helps with joint pain -|`|K5IOSGXAaa	Fibromyalgia has been directly linked to depression, are you on anti-depression meds? that is a good start, or take St. John's Wort, a natural herbal remedy. Make sure you get out in the sun at least 15 minutes a day and get that much exercise too ( I know when you are in pain it's hard to do). Take fish oil capsules as well, they not only help with the pain but help with the depression. You need to try Aleve as it is a better anti-inflammatory med than what you have mentioned. Don't use caffeine or alcohol, it makes the condition worse. Eat every 3 to 4 hours to keep your blood sugar level, this goes a long way towards brain function and mood stabilizing.

As long as you are able to breathe, it can wait until you get through to the doctor's office today or tomorrow.|`|PMPUQvUZaa	You should drink fluids get good rest keep calling the doctor and if you can just go in. but i think you probably just have a fever so try to take in lots of fluids and take some medicine like nyquil so that way you will get sleepy and thats where the rest comes in. HOPE YOU GET BETTER|`|9Sgp7Mqmaa	It could be a relapse or it could be something else, sounds like the flu to me, but then again im not a doctor.    GO TO THE DOCTOR!!! You never know    Here are some natural remedies    honey and tea
xfpJGBfwaa	You may have been holding your head a certain way without realizing it to make your glasses look minimal on your face.  But when you take them off, it looks odd.      I noticed that I was holding my head a certain way because I had a haircut that parted on one side.  So I thought it didn't look right if i parted my hair in the center.  But actually it was the way I was tilting my head a little tiny bit.      Nobody noticed it but me.  Funny how critical I am of myself.  Nobody else will notice it but you either.  So get the contacts and relax your neck muscles.  Spend some time on some shoulder and neck stretches and you'll be fine.|`|2oc6TDiGaa	your jus use to yourself with glasses youll look different after a while|`|NUCCIFRtaa	Go to the doctor for sure... But for me it's better if you use contacts|`|ugsfuQQcaa	You're used to seeing yourself with glasses on.  It might take a while for you to adjust seeing someone else in the mirror.  While glasses are nice, remember it is nice to the the option to go glasses free.  The contacts are the same concept as glasses.  They adjust your vision, not the face.  You might like yourself more without glasses.  Just give it time.|`|kGDxGYrxaa	i thot the same thing about my self when i first got my contacts. but it looks like that cuz u dont have your glasses on and for me my eyesight iz really bad so that was probably the reason why. plus your not used to it. give it week or so and you'll b better adjusted    gud luk!

mCEKMWTYaa	Since you are 21 and you said your bpm has always been this way, I assume your doctors or nurses are aware of this.  I guess if it worries you maybe you should call and schedule an appointment to have it checked out by your doctor and ask him or her all of the questions you may have about it.  Anything with caffeine in it can make your heart "race" too and I am sure you know how many things we eat or drink that may contain the caffeine!  I really hope you get the answers you need!|`|AA10326997	I have no idea, but I suggest that you talk to your doctor about it.  Your heart is nothing to mess around with.

I can't find guys to date that are taller than me, and it makes me look even skinnier, and people make fun of me and call me anorexic.|`|kFECmFGLaa	I'm 5'7 I use to hate it in school I was taller than all the boys.

AA10343094	chickenpox is a virus. it can't be cured, it will have to run itself out... should be gone in like, a week. he can make up the work, don't worry so much about his marks. if you put pressure on him, it could actually cause him to "crack" and do worse. he can make it up, it's really only a few days. good luck!|`|2gUBpC62aa	Calamine lotion and Aveeno oatmeal powder (comes in single use packets) for the bath.  Use both regularly, eat healthy and take multivitamins.  Other than that, letting the virus take its course is all you can do.  Children his age get chicken pox all the time, so speak to his teacher about his condition and they should be able to have him re-take his exam.  Best of luck!
pfm0wcEIaa	Feeling like this can be pretty horrible and from the severity of your symptoms it seems it might be more than just plan stress that is causing it.  Pay attention to whatever other symptoms you may be having since there might be and underlying illness associated with it. Some anxiety may be related to some other medical conditions such as diabetes.  This is wintertime and lack of vitamin D can get you feeling mentally drained as well.  Also, medications such as steroids can cause you to suffer from anxiety. Sometimes the same medication that you take for anxiety might cause even more severe anxiety.  Be very careful.  Make sure to discuss this with your doctor.    The best treatment for anxiety is exercise and lots of rest.    Another thing that might help is going tanning.    When you are going through an attack try reminding yourself that you are Loved and that God will keep you safe no matter what.  Don't hesitate to reach out to someone and ask them to keep you company when you are feeling like this.  I started going to Church because I didn't know what else to do when this happened to me.  And although I am not deeply religious, it really helped to go to Church and see a large group of people getting together to wish others well.  It made me feel I was not alone and that there are people who do care and are willing to help.    You can also try making a list of 30 things you enjoy doing, that way when you get an attack you can easily come with something to do that might make you feel better.    Take good care of yourself.  And remember that to every problem there is a solution.  Take it one step at time.    I wish you the Best of Luck.|`|NpaJsM3Caa	when you feel an attack comming on, try to think of positive things rather than negative things, such as, 'oh no, im going to have an anxiety attack!'  take deep breaths. relax. lie down, imagine youre on a warm beach somewhere.  in other words, just relax.  i used to have anxiety attacks when i was in rehab. the staff taught me breathing exercises, it really helps
PJMqyjNtaa	this isn't really a question  but when two people become more comfortable with each other you don't really care what you look like   and also gain weight  now that you two are married she probably thought she didn't have to dress up for you and gained weight as a result    if you think she need to lose the weight  tell her that you two should go to the gym or workout at home together    hope this helps  :)|`|803c63e1bdfd226d14f4e5cafdc52f7eaa	Forget all the "you should love her no matter what." You have every right to expect your wife to keep herself up. Tell her you're working hard to stay attractive to her and she doesn't care about her health or her appearance and it's not fair to you or to her.     You could also be more diplomatic about it. Tell her you're excited to starta  new exercise program and want her to go with you. Go out and get her some new gym clothes and go to the gym together. Be encouraging and supportive but any girl knows that "Let's go to the gym together!" is code for "You need to lose weight."     Good luck.|`|kFECmFGLaa	So what is your question? If your mad cause she put on weight then maybe you should try to talk to her, or how about you both go on a diet and exercise together.|`|089e8d35b7463b74daf5b60e025ccdc5aa	The first & most important thing is:  do not nag her.  That will have the opposite effect from what you want.    I would suggest that you come up with some fun activities that the two of you can do together that will burn calories.  Don't call it exercise, and don't think that she should do it by herself.  Tell her, let's go dancing or let's ride our bikes or let's go for a hike--whatever physical activities you like to do and can do in your area.  Even tell her that you want to stay healthy yourself and protect your heart since men are more susceptible to heart attacks.  Get her involved WITH YOU in some fun physical activities and then make a big salad when you get home.  Tell her that you will make lunch or dinner and fix something that is high in taste, fiber and nutrients but low in fat.  Maybe you will have to do some research to learn how to cook or to find good recipes, but think of this as an adventure for the two of you together towards good health, happiness and most importantly, a good sex life.|`|66212653a2740e8707873b25ecf49af5aa	I know u should love her know matter what because shes ur wife but maybe if u take a picture of her now and one of when she was "Hot" , Put them side by side some where u know she will see them! Kinda like a wake up call! I cant stand it when people get married and they feel like well i got u now so i don't have to impress u any more! sorry that's not the way it works! at least not in my book! Good luck!
5919d59a9a07aac4e14c50ba4d7d46b9aa	your just stupid why even waste space with this crap|`|DptJXo7Caa	ive been there and that is a rough position to be in but here are a few helpful hints.    first: stop smoking until thursday. yeah itll suck but youll improve your chances    second: keep on the juice, maybe a little heavier dose, but keep it safe.    third: i suggest Azos. pills for urinary tract pain. you can get them at any decent sized store and they can "alter" the results of a test in your favor    now heres the big one: the THC will stay in your blood stream for quite a while after smoking (obviously) however when a person works out, a LOT of that THC is drawn out of the blood stream and into the muscles- becuase your muscles need as much blood and oxygen as possible when working out. now when the blood is drawn out, the THC will enter into your urine stream much more heavily. so the worst thing you can do is run hard right before the piss test. but by running hard a few times before the test you stand a fighting chance.    work out real hard before the test but on the day of DO NOT WORK OUT! leave the THC in your blood and away from your urine.    drink cranberry juice, drink as much liquid as you can, pee as often as possible, and- gross as it sounds- stick your finger in your urine sample for a few seconds after you go in the cup (the oils are supposed to mess with it a little but im not sure... it cant hurt)    best of luck|`|7IBJZrWjaa	drink things with niacin in it, such as orange juice, and lots of liquids... niacin is a vitamine kinda thing (mineral to be specific) that extracts the thc from fat cells and will help flush your system...|`|AA11397003	call the DEA and ask   them !|`|HwfYEQUOaa	Stop smoking immediately until after your test. Drink tons and tons of water. I passed for the state of Texas using Vail's one hour cleanser. It tasted terrible, but it worked. Available at most head shops, it's not cheap either. Be careful though, because some tests test for a cleanser, and if they detect it, it's the same a testing positive. Good luck.|`|Vakup5Jvaa	from the amount you say you intake and the short amount of time you have to get rid if it, no way. Teas and water helps but you need at least a week to not show dirty...sorry.|`|9cTHvhAuaa	Hi Kesh,     Had a friend who used the GNC stuff and passed 2 out of 3 times. The more water you drink while you do it the better. Also drink distilled water as it pulls everything out of you. Most grocery stores have it.    I'm not passing judgment but as someone probably twice your age and who quit over 20 years ago. We all have to grow up sooner than later. Hope your test goes well.
FVDTXM68aa	Wow hun! That's awful! I can't believe they can't find the cause of the problem! Honestly, I would continue to bug the doctors until things are fixed, because this is your health! Something is obviously wrong! I mean, how could this affect your child? Or what about when you deliver? Keep bugging them to run more tests. Try other doctors around town and get other opinions. Do whatever it takes to get to the bottom of this, because it's only going to get worse! I feel so badly, for you!! :(  Don't give up!! Do this for you and your baby!! Good Luck, sweetie!! Email me when you finally get an answer to your medical problem!! :)
kC8JHWVQaa	Why would you want this to spread faster on your face?? Don"t you want this to be gone?? Take your meds to clear this up and may need to take longer to kill infection under the skin surface.This is commonly spread by touch from infected area by use of other items such as towels, bed sheets,cloths,hats combs etc.etc. If you have any dogs/cats treat them as well by a vet of course.( If you have any )!This can take several weeks to clear up on the surface but more time is needed to do the job under the skin.
iNkOiNC7aa	i swear no one does patient teaching anymore and as a nurse it tics me off, yes its normal, you are shedding old cells or sloughing actually, anyway it could last up to 6 weeks and may even be blood tinged..had the procedure myself..if still shedding after 6 weeks ask doc, may have an oder too...sorry and good luck.
8Xbc4ok1aa	Yoghurt, cheese, and boiled chicken. Your bones need phosphorus, calcium, and magnesium while your muscles need water, protein and carbohydrates to grow. Since you are growing taller, both your muscles and bones are getting bigger and longer. Don't waste your money or your health on drugs, alcohol or cigarettes.    Have the hair style that makes you appear taller. In order to appear taller, a hair style should be thin at the sides and higher up top, which can make you appear as much as an inch taller Avoid clothes with horizontal lines. Belts are horizontal so make sure you conceal it in your clothes.  Avoid clothes with a tartan or checked pattern. Avoid cuffs that makes your legs appear shorter.    ? Wear clothes with vertical lines or striping. Vertical lines or stripping make a person appear thinner,  and thinness in turn gives impression of more height.    Wear shoes that will make you appear taller. If you are a female, this should be easy since you can find a lot of female shoes with 2 or 3 inches heels. For males, wear shoes with thick soles to add the illusion of height.    To increase your height, it is important that your blood is oxygenated as blood provides nourishment to your bones. Regular breathing will also purify your blood. There are three phases to breathing:  1. Inhaling - take in air into your body through the nose  2. Retaining - hold your breath inside your body  3. Exhaling - blow out air from your body through the mouth    It is during deep sleep that growth hormone does its job of thickening and lengthening your bones. So appropriate sleeping time (not the longer, the better) and correct sleeping posture is very important for your body to grow. Sleep is defined as a natural periodic state of rest for the mind and body, in which the eyes usually close and consciousness is completely or partially lost, so that there is a decrease in bodily movement and responsiveness to external stimuli.    During deep sleep, growth hormone produced by your pituitary gland is released into your blood stream and travel through your body and causes the thickening and lengthening of your bones. Therefore, you should achieve "deep level" sleep on a daily basis in order to coordinate your affords of exercises and proper diet. The following are some helpful tips on how to easily achieve deep level sleep.    Sleep in a comfortable and firm mattress.  Sleep in a room that is dark, quiet and fresh smelling.  Sleep with clean, soft, and comfortable clothes.  Keep your hands and feet warm. Scientific studies have shown that warm hands and feet will help induce REM (rapid eye movement) deep sleep. Cold hands and feet will keep you from deep sleep.  Drink a big glass of water before going to bed and when you wake up; this will help clean out your system.  Practice total relaxation and deep breathing for a few minutes before you go to bed.  Relax from head to toe. Close your eyes and relax every part of your body.  Maintain a habit of sleeping at the same time everyday, including weekends.  Sleep on your back with a flat pillow under your knees. This will align your spine properly and prevent any back aches caused by sleeping in a bent position.    Undoubtedly, the quality, quantity, and type of food we eat affect our height, growth, and health. We cannot emphasize enough how important your food intake is in determining how much growth you can possibly obtain. The types of food you eat will either improve or decrease your growth potential.  After careful consideration and research, the daily content of protein, carbohydrates, fats and water can be achieved if the following items were taken regularly.    Carrots Fish Liver  Egg Yolk Beef Red Meat  Milk Cheese Apples  Green Vegetables Potatoes Nuts  Yellow Vegetables Almonds Bananas  Peanuts Chicken Beans  Peas Salt 6-8 glasses of water per day    If you eat a lot of peanut butter, your height will not necessarily stop. Neither does masturbation stop height.  What might stop you from growing is smoking, drugs, alcohol, lack of sleep, stress, digestive problems, or lack of exercise.    Height Growth Products : The first approved natural product for height increase is Super-Growth http://www.super-growth.com or http://www.super-growth.org with this product it is possible to gain additional height growth even after puberty.

5T4AwCfOaa	Yes, just do push ups and sit ups.  That's all you need unless you're trying to get ready for professional bodybuilding competitions.  It may get boring, but just do it ..... at least 5 days per week.  Don't worry about working any other part of your body.  It won't make that much difference.

eb603a32531b733c208d6a3685da0228aa	The initial injection is just a sharp stick, and if the "sticker" is good and fast, you won't even know you've been stuck until it's all over with.  People generally don't have much problem for the first hour or so, but afterward it's normal to run a low grade fever and have a sore, stiff arm for a day or so.  Best way to help avoid the worst of that is to take Tylenol or Motrin about an hour before you take the shot, and then take it every four hours for the next day.  It also helps if you keep moving the arm you took the shot in.  The more you move the muscle, the sooner the tet-tox is absorbed by the body, and quits irritating the muscle tissue.  If you guard the arm and don't move it, it can be quite the killer the next day.  But the shot sure beats the disease, and a day of sore arm beats a coffin any time.|`|AZ0s5dGtaa	well i got it a few months ago and it was very painful it stings while their giving it because the stuff has to go into your muscle and afterwards your arm is very sore and also if you get the gardisal that was stings really bad spread the word and it has 3 freakin shots!!|`|q3yO95gnaa	feels like a normal shot, then the next day your going to feel like you just got punched in the arm really hard.

k5X78IM3aa	Do a Google for a low fat diet.  It works.  My doctor gave it to me when I was having problems with my gall bladder.  It is more of a healthy way of eating than a diet.  On a low fat diet there are fats you can & cannot eat in each food group, so you don't have to give up all fats...just the ones not good for you.  There are plenty of foods that you like that you can eat so don't worry about nasty food.  You don't have to eat it.  If you do a Google search, be sure to get the low fat diet for GI problems.  That way you don't have to pay for special foods & you can get them right at the grocery store.  Give it a try.  You won't be hungry & you can eat foods you like.  Good luck.  Nala<br>  <br>  PS...And stick with it.  You won't loose it over night, but you will loose.|`|zze8XmjLaa	you place to much on eating per se. you need to refocus on sports, study and good activities, not self destructive things like thinking about yummy food. knock it off and make something out of yourself.|`|7vt21U1naa	Eat healthy. Don't eat fried food or other junk food like fast food. And try to go to gym.

At 13, you should only worry about fun things. I was juust like you, I reach 170 and I NEVER tried to lose it.

I have a friend that lost over 60lbs after joining and she's keeping it off. No fad diets will work nor will diet pills - otherwise there would be no overweight ppl in the world, would there?

N35ugaL8aa	no it doesn't sound stupid.  If you don't want to wear the wrist band all the time just wear long sleeves.  And don't leave it on when you take a shower.  What i do is i wear long sleeves, but it doesn't bother me to see my cuts as long as no one else sees them.  If you don't want to see them just don't look at them and wear your wrist band some times but sometimes wear long sleeves.<br>  <br>  If you stop it will get better just try not to think about it and when you want to cut think about something else or listen to music or something.<br>  <br>  I hope this helped.
79YQAbSRaa	Blood in the stool usually shows up as black streaks.  Taking prenatal vitamins or other high iron concentrates can cause black to appear in the stool.  I would assume with your history that the internal hemorrhoids are bleeding, but I'd give the doc a call just to make sure.|`|xi7XaH4Maa	Well in my Human Biology class we kinda went over something like this but i don't have my notes with me to be really positive about it...<br>  <br>  The black streaks in your poo is blood because blood being in your intestines so long get brown after a while.<br>  <br>  My suggestion is to go back to the hospital and get it checked out. Bug them about it and maybe they might give you something to treat it but I'm not sure there's any medicine to treat it.<br>  <br>  Hope I helped a little...
exMPHWKHaa	The dose for it all depends on your weight, height, age, sex etc. The dose can range anywhere from 400-1500 mg. Obviously the higher the dose the more strong of a trip. It is very similar to drugs like PCP and ketamine in effects. I can tell already that you are not going to have a very good report and it will most likely just contain myths and false information. I recommend you go to <a href="http://www.erowid.org/chemicals/dxm/" rel="nofollow">http://www.erowid.org/chemicals/dxm/</a> for information you will find experience reports, dosages health effects and other stuff. Good luck.|`|HzmJkHMHaa	I've done a real low dose, 150mg. doses range from 100mg-1000 or even more. effects from 150mg were hardly anything. a little fuzzy in the head. maybe like a shot of vodka. the other ingredients in the syrup made me pretty nausious. that's why its recommended to get pure dxm or otc meds only containing dxm. cordicin cough and cold is specifically considered a very dangerous brand to trip on dxm because of one of the active ingredients, i forget what it is, is dangerous in high levels.|`|GCYvo1C0aa	dont take coricidin that **** ***** you up it has other ingredients in it besides dxm.<br>  <br>  ive tripped on dxm before on robitussin took 18 gel pills 15mg each i weigh 115lb im 15  5'5<br>  <br>  i took em waited like 1/2 hour smoked 2 bowls and as we were finishing the second bowl it hit me and im like holy ****. got up to walk back to my friends house (like 1 minute walk from our spot) and felt like **** when i started walkling. had to sit down halfway and take a breather, then got back up walked into his house layed down on his couch and watched ET. best trip ever hahaha then again im rolling tomorrow so that'll probably be better

Sometimes it is contributed to stress. You really should be wearing a night guard. It sounds like you are a pretty heavy grinder and it is possible to grind your teeth down to almost nothing. You can pick up a night guard at a drug store like CVS or even walmart that shouldn't cost to much money. It will help until you are able to get a more custom night guard made.|`|3d2q4X5Taa	I use to do that, it must be how your jaw is.<br>  I would ask your dentist, if there is a easy free way to help it

JQmlqeM7aa	If I were you, I'd get one of those Velcro ski boot like casts. I've seen them at thrift stores and I just found a bunch on eBay. Even if it's a sprain it's good to immobilize it for a little while. Obviously, if it's a break it's good to get it checked out, but since it doesn't sound too bad, immobilizing it would be the best thing to do short of going to the doctor.<br>  <br>  Let he know how it works out.|`|HE558QgXaa	You should go to the doctor. It may have broken and healed incorrectly. You may need surgery|`|rlvrgwWvaa	You know what, check for the break. I sprain my ankle a lot and that sounds much much worse. If it was me I'd rather find out that it was a sprain than be stuck with an untreated break. Until then buy an ace bandage. wrap it in a figure 8 around your heel and ankle. Make it tight, but don't cut off your circulation. But yes, get an x-ray.

If I take it immediately before bed, I just fall asleep and stay asleep.<br>  <br>  There have been times when I took it, and then waited before going to bed.  The closest I've come to the "side effects" described have been then.  Usually about a half-hour after I take it, I start to feel a bit like I've had one drink too many.  (Like a buzz.)   Sometimes my vision will be "off"...like I'll look at the TV, and the picture looks three-dimensional, or the chandelier in my dining room will appear to be swinging back and forth.  While I'm under the effects, I am fully aware of exactly what I'm doing, though I might have trouble remembering things the next day.  (Like if I'm watching a movie, I won't remember the ending.  I still need to watch "Batman: The Dark Knight" again because I have NO memory whatsoever of how the movie ended.)  I've never been tempted even for a minute to go out and drive, or do anything crazy.  I think the craziest thing I ever did was decide to re-pot all the plants in my house at about 11:00 at night.  My husband tells me I get "chatty" after I take it.  (Meaning I'll talk his ear off. lol.)|`|nrEQAOxsaa	My mom takes it and she gets really crazy on it. Like she's on drugs or something. She said when she first started taking it if she looked in the mirror after she took it and it looked like her face was melting.

Crest makes a ton. You can also get whitening toothpaste and chewing gum.

Clean your teeth with this mixture.|`|H9ci6Nofaa	Yes, try this company's product. Looks good.|`|Q9cx6nS0aa	Haley,<br>  <br>  There are a lot of different products out there.  Some are performed by dentists and are done in the office (and tend to be more expensive as well) and others are done by you at home.  In regards to the at home whiteners, there are many to choose from including NutraBrite, Crest White Strips, GoSmile, and Movie Star Look to name a few.<br>  <br>  From my personal experience, I would definitely recommend NutraBrite.  I have tried several other teeth whitening products (crest white strips and GoSmile) with some success, but I still thought my teeth could be whiter.  I wasn’t interested in going to a dentist for Zoom just yet, so I decided to try NutraBrite.<br>  <br>  I actually tried NutraBrite because of the promotion they were running (and are still running).  They were offering a free trial so I thought I would give it a try.<br>  <br>  The promotion is for real.  I had to give them my name, email and credit card information (just for their records), but they sent me their Whitening Booster product and Hydroxy kinetic Mouth Tray (a total value of $89) for free.  I did have to pay $3.95 for shipping but it was totally worth it (they even promised to refund the shipping if I wasn’t satisfied).<br>  <br>  I applied the Whitening Booster in the tray, allowed to sit for the recommended time and voila, my teeth looked whiter!  This was definitely a more impressive result than the other whitening products I had tried.<br>  <br>  After the initial products, you can opt to continue to receive more from NutraBrite to help further improve and maintain your results.<br>  <br>  I have been very happy with my results and highly recommend NutraBrite to anyone looking for whiter teeth.<br>  <br>  You can find the free offer at:<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.rightmeetsleft.com/NutraBriteFreeTrial.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.rightmeetsleft.com/NutraBrite...</a><br>  <br>  Good Luck!|`|aiwYCKmfaa	not much to it, it doesnt hurt or anything its just a super bluish light and takes a while they sometimes put like protective glasess so the light wont damage ur eyes
Yn6pM2Xyaa	'they say'.... ususally you've got good gums of good teeth... that being said seems like you might be getting a raw deal in both areas..  there are genetic defects people can have in how their teeth are formed that would cause them to have many problems such as you have described.. at the same time depending on how you treat your teeth, brushing, flossing and what kinda of foods you eat and things you bite on with your teeth similar problems could arise.  I would suggest you go to a dentist office and ask them how much things would cost to get you in there to look at things and work on a treatment plan that is cost efficient for your means.  They should be able to give you a good ballpark before the first appointment how much a new patient exam would cost you and they might even consider taking you in for a emergency exam first to only look at the molar at the back giving you the most grief right now.  I do not know what the fee guides are for your area as I worked in a dental office in Canada and haven't worked in one for a few years now but I hope that they could get you in for a 'look-see' and an xray for a reasonable fee and then depending on the state of the tooth would depend on whether you are looking at a simple extraction (very cheap) or a complicated extraction (about 3 times the price).  either way I would not let this get any worse as an infection in your gums could leave to bone resorbtion in the area and in turn more teeth having prblems and losing future bone ridge to sit a denture on which in all liklihood at some point in your life you might need.  Does that make sense?  Hope so.. just take it one step at a time, call an office and get them to explain things upfront for what they would book and the costs so you can set an appointment at a time when you have the money ready.  Where I live, a few years ago you could probably get the tooth looked at, xrayed aqnd a simple extraction for about $100-$120)  They most likely though at that point would want you to go ahead with a full patient exam before they would go ahead with anything further.  Best of luck.
