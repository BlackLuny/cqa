Everything changed when we moved in together and he is totally different. He always wants to know where i am going, who i am with & how long im gonna be out. We live in New Jersey & i have to travel into New York for work, i work ever hour i can to be away from him. He has this idea that i am cheating on him which i am not, im not that type of person at all. He is part of a very rough crowd and i hate them. I try my hardest to stay away from them.He has a very short fuse & gets pissed with me alot but always says he loves me so much, i don't know if i believe it though. Alot of my friends live in NY so i go there on some nights out with them. The other night when he came home i was on my way out with friends and he grabbed my arm and just kept staring at me & never said anything, i told him i was just going out with my friend eventually he let me go, i got terrified & knew i needed to get away from him.Another day when i was going out he put me up against the wall. I know he has a tendency to be violent as i have seen him beat a guy just for bumping into me. He shouts at me if i want to go somewhere with out him, even if the place doesn't involve him he wants to be there. Im not his property and he is starting to scare me, Im only 25 i don't need to be scared of someone who is ment to love me. He has been arrested a few times. Please help me with advice in how to go about leaving.   Thanks alot :)

I have SLE (Lupus), I have Chiari Malformation.     Its where my tonsols from my cerebellum longate into the spinal opening, cutting of the spinal fluid from going down the spine. This there for cause multiple problems. I recently had surgery on it to open up the spinal opening. But I still have many problems and now my dr wants to give me an injection in my lower left back theres something in there that moves around and hurts. Its a fairly big knot, I dont know what to do cause I also get my depot (Birth control) Shot the very next day. And if the Cortisone shot inhibits the Vitamin D and Calcium from not being any good, and my shot does the same wont this be a risky thing for me to get both shots so close? Ive been feeling like my bodys swollen and I ache and hurt all the time now. Ive been feeling like Im having problems breathing and my lungs are sore. Everything I read from people who have had it already have had problems, and I am fair skinned and have problems with almost every type of medicine. I dont know what else I can do to quit feeling like this everyday. I really dont want to get the shot and now Im soooo scared to get it after everything Ive read cause if all these people are feeling like this after what am I gonna feel cause I feel like this all the time anyways and Im afraid its gonna be bad if I go ahead and get it. It might be just double the hurt if I do and I read it destroys tissue and I already have a connecive tissue disease that already destorys my tissue so why should I help it along. Someone please help!!!

20090223033816AAMKGvO	Health;Diet & Fitness	How can I lose all this extra weight when I hate not feeling full?	Lets start here. I am 6'2 currently about 255 lbs. 3 years ago I was 175lbs. 4 years ago I was 220lbs. When I lived with my parents I was the 220. Not the most active, played video games a lot and what not. Move out on my own, had no money for food, ate a pack of Ramen every 2 days, lost alot of weight, got to 175, perfectly toned though. Looked and felt the best I ever had. No exercise or anything like that.       Fast forward a year from that, I met what was supposed to be the girl of my dreams, we were dating but then quickly began to gain weight, because I was making good money and we would go out to eat a lot, and she would make dinner and the like.       She got pregnant, I then ate when ever she did, which turned out to be horrid on me of course (weight wise). Here I am currently 250+ lbs, seemingly unable to lose it. The most self conscious person in the entire world, I don't even like to leave the house as I get treated somehow so differently then when I was skinny.       I am still not very active, but want to get rid of the weight. I seem fairly decently, but not obsessive amounts I don't think.       Going through alot in my life with our break up, my losing my job and all that, but I had been over weight long before that. I do drink excessively though. I guess there are too many questions I want to ask, but not enough space. Let me lay down the facts.      I drink more then anyone should. Mostly orange juice and rum, now moved on to bacardi 151. About a half a bottle or 3/4 of 151 a day. and a carton of Orange juice.       I think I eat alot, but seem to get full fast, and feel full alot, but for some reason still feel like I need to eat. I will wake up, eat maybe a sandwich, 2 hours later, a bowl of soup, 3-4 hours later, another sandwich, and then maybe another after that.       I hate not feeling full, I guess my main question was going to be, what can I eat alot that will not make me or keep my over weight (if anything) I have bought some caramel rice cakes, hoping they may help.       If anyone has suggestions, or maybe encouragement more then anything, please do share. I am not in a good place right now and need all the help I can get.

20090223034114AA6I2Bs	Health;General Health Care;Pain & Pain Management	Should I go to the ER now or wait and go to the doc in the morning?	I have had a sore throat for a few days now.  It's just on my right side but the pain has grown and is even behind my right ear now.  It hurts so bad to swallow that I can't sleep and have to actually think about if each time I do.  I often get strep throat (I have had it almost once a year since I was in 4th grade and I am now 28 so you do that math) but this doesn't feel the same mostly because it's only on side.  Should I go now to the ER or wait until the morning?

I do plan to see my gp about it next week, just have to get over my embarresment talking about this to him, as they're are no female nurses or doctors at our surgery!

20090223040139AAAaHmM	Health;Dental	Wisdom tooth extraction site stilll bothering me... call the dentist or am I paranoid?	On Friday (four days ago) I had all four of my wisdom teeth out. Within hours, the major bleeding had stopped at all four sites and healing seemed to be going normally.       However, the next day I noticed that I was still oozing blood from one of the sites. That oozing continued on and off Sunday and is still happening right now (Monday morning). The swelling and pain is almost completely gone at the other three sites, but at the site that is still bleeding slightly, both pain and swelling remain.       I know that different people and different sites might take different amounts of time to heal, but I am super paranoid about dry socket. I've only been eating mushy, liquid foods (soup, apple sauce, ice cream etc) and I've only brushed my front teeth gently. Is it possible, though, that somehow I have dislodged the clot and should be talking to my dentist about dry socket? Or should I be more patient with the healing process?

20090222162237AABrcFD	Health;Mental Health	I have weird thoughts - especially about killing and eating others- is this exceptionally unusual?	It especially gets worse when I am not busy. Usually the thoughts manifest as thoughts about killing someone in a fight and eating their flesh raw. Furthermore, I have visual/auditory hallucinations –of demonic sounds/sights. The hallucinations sound like inaudible conversations and appear as creatures that very rapidly evaporate as soon as I see them. What’s worse is that I get nervous when I am alone in a room in which I cannot see the entire area, especially if there is an open door. And, at night I sleep under covers, because otherwise I see demonic shapes swirling in the darkness. What is weird about it is that when I am busy (with work/school/whatever) I can go weeks without anything except the rare inaudible conversation and thought about cannibalism. What is more, no one else seems to know about it, because I’m rational enough to realize that these are not real and act accordingly around others. Is this strange or am I just over dramatizing normal thoughts/sensory information?

On thedailyplate.com they have it so when you enter your foods in it shows your percentage of carbs, protein, and fat consumed in the foods eaten. What's the recommended percentage of fat? Carbs?       I exercise everyday (sometimes skip a day though). I go to the YMCA and burn about 300-500 calories and then speed walk about 4-5 miles.       I'm not really seeing any results. I eat around 800-1100 calories each day. I don't eat sweets at all or anything that's high in fat. Should I lower it any more?

About 2 weeks ago my little sister had a seizure.( she is 14) It didnt last long, but we were all scared to death. We went to the ER and they said it was nothing and just to keep an eye on her. Last Thursday she had another seizure. This one was a little worse than the 1st. We took her to the same ER and they basically said the same thing. No tests were done or anything. This is the only ER nearby that insurance will cover.      Well tonight. We were all sitting in the living room talking and my sister stood up to go get her something to drink out of the kitchen. She walked about 2 steps and fell backwards. She wasnt shaking or anything like before but we could not get her to wake up. We thought she was dead. I called her an ambulance while my mom tried to wake her up. The EMTs got there and still couldnt get her awake. Her BP was 129/97, I dont remember the pulse. They put oxygen on her too. This time at the ER they did a CT scan but it was normal, they sent her home. We still do not have answers.      She told me that while she was on the floor, she could hear everything people were saying and she could see everyone but it was like she was looking from above, not on the floor.   Does anyone know what might be going on? We are all so scared for her

This hasn't been the first time this has happened and it's the repetitive nature of these experiences that concerns me. The feeling is usually brought on by a dream I have but I can always feel the effects of the dream on my body in real life.      2 nights ago I had a really weird, creepy dream where there were undertones of death. The dream ended with a scene of me reaching to turn on a light above a stove. Seems simple, weird, not really anything to worry about. But last night when I was dreaming, everything led up to me turning on that same light, which was a kind of deja vu/foreshadowing. I knew something bad would happen if i turned on the light and by the time I did it, it was too late. The people i was with (in the dream) immediately started freaking out because I dropped to the ground and died. But I could feel it happening to my body. It was like I lost all feeling, it was an empty numbness, not a tingling kind. and there was a sort of pressure over my body and my head and i felt like i was leaving my body. I couldn't breathe and the dream, by this time, was over. I felt like i was fading away and I started to pray with whatever consciousness I had left for God to not let me die and i fought to wake up.      I eventually opened my eyes but I was so scared to go back to sleep. This isn't the first time this has happened, the feeling of leaving my body and the overall emptiness and lack of breathing and control over my body. It's even happened once when i was awake and laying on the couch. i was following a certain breathing pattern and when it got messed up, i stopped all of a sudden and heard a high loud ringing in my ears and the same feelings started, all simultaneously, and i jumped up because i thought i was dying and my heart was beating super fast.      what could these feelings be? they really scare me and i'm always afraid of sleeping because i'll never know if i'm going to have another dream like that and have to fight for my life. i wish i could describe it better but there's nothing like it at all.
20090223044019AAUOAG9	Health;Mental Health	What's going on? why does this all seem like a dream?	I don’t know how to explain it. But everything just seems so unreal, I feel like I’m just a bystander to whatever happens in this world. I feel like I’m waiting for something to happen, something to wake me from this ‘dream’. But it’s getting harder to wait, and things seem to be happening to me without me really caring. It’s as if I’m emotionless. I cry but there’s no tears. I laugh, but am I truly happy?      I hate this feeling, I just feel like crying and sleeping all the time now. School, I just let the days pass by. I feel as though as long as I pass I’ll be ok in the future. And yet the future, I can’t even imagine my life beyond at the most age 25. I’m worried why.      Each day I just pass by, waiting for something, anything, to happen. Anything to ‘wake me up from this dream’. The only times I don’t feel like this is when I’m watching TV/reading books or actually dreaming.      I just want to wake up from this ‘emotionless’ state. Things are happening to me and I feel like I’m just letting them get worse. Eating Disorder. Depression. Anemic. Stress. I don’t eat when I’m hungry because, what’s the point? I find it hard to keep up with my work at school even though I’m doing perfectly fine?      Please tell me what’s going on in my head.   I’m a 14 year old girl, if that makes a difference.   I just feel like I don't belong in this place.

(I don′t know If I include Irish there)       I accept images if you want, jeje!        Evidently this is more for play than other stuffs, but I ask this because I being to belive, that they –germans- get something small and white. But that doesn′t look like like David Kross  in “the readers” (the movie of kate winslet′s  oscar) and he got 17 when he make that film,  and other films germans that I had see too show non weak stuffs. And I had see French who get it big too. I know, that someone gonna say that is umpossible generalize, but, for ex I see an Irish and Daniel Radcliffe naked, and they don′t look very endowed, look more like a tiny bean. So maybe Hitler get another mistake when they call them “cousines of race”, cause they don′t look very similars.      What I′m looking is the experiences of guys and girls who let your experience (age too if is possible) and confirm or not if are a tendency.

20090223004540AAltO5n	Health;Alternative Medicine	I need your input on drugs and pot.?	i always smoke weed. it is an everyday thing, all the time. and i see nothing wrong with it. when i wake up, i smoke. when i get home from school, i smoke. and a few hours later, i smoke. and sometimes before i go to bed, i smoke. the amount? well i usually smoke out of a glass piece with a pretty big bowl, and usually about ehh...4-5 bowls at a time. unless i'm with friends, then it's much more of course haha. my age? not telling you that. but i love it. it makes me feel better about life. and i still get good grades, and have good friends. i have a good relationship with my mom, she's like my best friend although sometimes we do fight over stupid things. my dad, on the other hand, is a completely different story. i can never seem to build a good relationship with him. and he knows nothing about my pot smoking. i do have a few things that go on in my life that a lot of people probably couldn't handle, but we wont go there.       anyways, smoking bud always makes me feel better about life. i enjoy it, as do most people :)    another thing i loooove to do is Ecstasy. it is a blast when i'm rollin and of course, it also makes everything so much better. i dont do this a lot though. but when i do, i absolutely love it.   i also like to take prescription meds, like percacets. i know pretty much everything there is to know about prescription meds. i dont know if one of these days i'm going to overdose or what, if something continues to happen.          "Only once the drugs are done, that I feel like dying... I feel like dying..."      This explains explains how i feel...i feel like i always have to be high or messed up to feel good about life. whenever i'm sober, i feel more like **** than ever. I have heard the whole "you're dependant on drugs" thing one too many times....although its probably true.      what do you think i should do?

In the mirror you can see that there is a slight change in texture on the tooth itself, and it feels rough to touch it with my tongue. Complicating matters a bit is that I am at college out of state, and do not have direct access to a dentist. Is this something I should have checked out?      ---- Also, my retainer broke a few months ago, and my teeth have moved somewhat significantly. It's the type with the hard plastic and the wire that goes over the teeth. I had a new one molded about a month after it broke, and they mailed it to me at school. However, it doesn't fit, and it seems the back molars have moved. Is this a simple solution for an orthodontist, or will a new retainer have to be made.      I hope these are clear and that you can help me! Thanks a LOT!!!

If it was something really serious it would have changed or had other symptoms in that amount of time, right?  Please let me know your thoughts and if anyone else has this problem.

20090223043610AA71mte	Health;General Health Care;Injuries	My boss said she would fire me if i went to the doctors?	i pit in a request close to 3 weeks that i had a doctors appointment because lately i wasn't feeling well. well last week i noticed that my request had been denied. so i called 2 days ago and told them that i could come in because my doctors appointment is very important, plus it is hard to re-schedule. so the gave me a list of people that i had to call to cover my shift for me. i couldn't find anyone. so i called back this morning and told them i couldn't find anyone and i was unable to come in, she told me i had to because there was no one else to cover my shift. i asked her what if i brought in an excuse from the doctor. she said she wouldn't take it because, 1. i didn't put the request in on time. i asked her what would have been a appropriate time?, she didn't answer me. 2. because i called off 3 times before in the last 6 months I've been working there. but i never got written up, or a warning or a suspension notice. plus a co-worker of mine had to schedule her appointment 3 times before they gave her the day off. am i wrong for being concerned about this.
20090223044606AAVTAYF	Health;Mental Health	Am I suffering from bipolar disorder?	My sister sometimes calls me bipolar when I snap at her. I usually only snap when I get irritated, like when I ask her to do something or I tell her to stop what ever she is doing and she doesn't listen to me, so I get mad as a last resort and feel like I didn't do anything wrong and I'm just trying to get it through her head. I thought this wasn't a big deal, but she called me bipolar again tonight so I looked it up on the Internet and saw that they can suffer from depression as well. I do get depressed, but is that only because I have a long distance relationship where I can barely talk to  or see him because of his job? This happens often, the anger issues and the depression, and I'm hoping that it's normal to be angry and depressed at the same time when nothing seems to go your way, because if not then I am bipolar. Anyway, that's a short description of what goes on with me. Could I be bipolar?

Of course she has been taking her prescriptions regularly.When I took her to the Doctor they said she had stomach virus and strep throat. She has been vomiting and had run a fever but is no longer running one! I took her a couple of days ago to the hospital and they just sent us home with another set of prescriptions.She also has not been eating at all only liquid substances as the doctor said! She is not getting better at all it seems to be getting worse. I am afraid cause she is not eating. I gave her pedialite also. She doesn't like it and I have to force her sips cause I don't want her to lose her life. Sometimes she'll want to eat but then if she does later she'll throw it all up!

20090223074735AA8tIFs	Health;Mental Health	We're my parents emotionally abusive (bulimia.. very long question.. )?	and are they to blame for some of the problems i have?       okay, so this might be a long question but i feel like i really need some help / advice.       first of all, i want everyone to know that i love my parents. they are great people who love me very much and they've always expressed how much they love me. they would do anything for me and give me anything i want and i know they'll always be there for me. they were truly great parents and i am lucky to have them.       BUT.. is it possible that they could have also been emotionally abusive?        -they are both highly religious and if i do or say anything that doesn't agree with our religion than they make me feel extremely guilty.   -they constantly invaded my privacy while i was in high school (ex. they monitored all of my phone calls, read my journal for no reason, read any notes that they found from any of my friends, etc)   -my mom would disapprove of any of my friends who weren't "rich enough" and would tell me i couldn't hang out with them because of this.    -they would nag me all the time especially for things like "being a pushover" or "not standing up for myself" enough.   -i would get compared to my older sister all the time   -they accuse me of not loving them if i decide to go out with my friends instead of spending time with them   -when my parents found out i had messed around with my boyfriend my dad yelled at me for an entire evening and called me a slut, tramp, whore.. etc. (he apologized for it later but it still hurts..)   -they constantly accuse me of doing things that i don't do   -they tell me i whine too much and that im too emotional   -i was terrified of having a boyfriend because i knew they would never approve of it.    -they always acted like they didn't trust me even though i never gave them a reason too.   -i did poorly last year at college and im currently not in school right now and they make me feel worthless because of this      the list goes on..      last year after flunking out of college i ran away from home and moved in with my boyfriend who lives 3 hours away (i had to tell them i was with a friend because they would never forgive me if they knew i lived with my boyfriend and i feel bad for lying to them) but now they make me feel bad for moving out and they make me feel like not living with them is wrong for me to do. (did they expect me to live with them forever?) and now when i visit (which is only about a week at time during major holidays) they smother me and try to "figure" out why im such a screw up and why i don't enjoy living with them anymore.       and i have NEVER ever admitted this to anyone but i have suffered from bulimia for the past 2 1/2 years. im 19 years old and i consider myself attractive and i have always been very thin.. but i still suffer from this. however, the only time im bulimic is when im visiting them. when i am at my new home with my boyfriend or anywhere else the thought of throwing up my food never crosses my mind and i feel happy and healthy. but when im home i get depressed, i throw up everything i eat and i don't want to do anything besides sit in a corner a read quietly to myself.       i feel really bad to blame this on my parents but when i think about it.. it sounds like it's their fault.       sorry this is so long.. but we're my parents emotionally abusive? they want me to come visit them again soon for like month and i don't want to.. i know ill go back to being bulimic and ill be depressed again and all they do is make me feel guilty when i visit them and i don't want to deal with it!       blah.. so my question is.. how do i fix my relationship with them (they really are good people) and how do i visit them and be happy at the same time? are they the cause of my bulimia? how do i recover from all of this?

I had a bit of a weak moment and fell over, thankfully I was in a virtually empty shop and nobody saw. It isn't a stretched muscle, I know what that feels like and this clearly isn't that?      Today they've hurt even more, I've put on weight which has worried me but I guess that's down to their swelling, it hurts to walk, especially up stairs. I did some stretches to see if it would help, but it didn't.      One of my friends said it might be due to my poor diet, I don't like eating much and eat only cereal, ryvita and rice. I don't know if this would effect it, maybe it is a reaction to low nutrients or something?      Help would be grateful, if you have any suggestions or ideas on what you think it might be!

I cut up my food too eat as I eat my food without teeth. Last week my roommate brought home a this big cheese cake. I love cheese cake. But, I really didn't gain much from it because I ate the whole thing. I usually only eat one meal a day in the afternoon and I get full. I sleep good too. I used to weigh about 140, I now weigh 123 and I am 5'6". I am a 50 something year old female. I weigh myself often to see the results. I know as you get older you lose weight, but this is ridiculous. I look terrible, and look like I have anorexia. Which I do not. Oh, I got my dentures before Thanksgiving. All my Dentist said to me was to call him if my dentures ever give me pain. Which they don't now. My friend told me my body is eating my muscles. How creepy. I have canceled a wedding invitation that I'm supposed to go to. I am cold all the time, it is cold but not that cold my roommate says. It's because I don't have any fat. So, any information would be helpful. I made a cake yesterday too, and I'm going to eat a lot of it.

20090223052939AAt34ld	Health;Mental Health	Still worried a year later and effecting my daily life.?	hey everyone i suffer from OCD/anxiety and i have been worried sick for the past 11 months because while moving i threw out my old 40gb laptop hard drive without thinking..and have read alot about idenity theft and it just scared me sending me into a complete obsession over my personal information being found and someone finding out everything about me, even though eveything was deleted from the drive, i know things can still be recovered ..after 11 months odds are it has been destroyed right? i would have known by now if anyone had found it. Basically i am just wondering if it could even survive being put through the trash process..it was just a small laptop hard drive outside of its case..usually if you just drop them they are toast. i also heard the trash from my town goes to the local power plant to be incincerated so the only chance it could have been found is point a to point b. What do you guys think?      I cant seem to get these thoughts out of my head and this has completely taken over my life..any help would be great i am really suffering here, i just really dont know what else to do..i am on paxil and have considered therapy but i dont know if that will even help me..       I have always had obsessions throughout my life. But not one that has gripped one so violently like this. I am sure people are sick of seeing me ask this, but it is theraputic for me to get reassurance, although i know it is not a solution. I guess i just feel silly seekign therapy for something so ridiculous. It is embarrassing.      I want to try and get over this without going to therapy, i am just not sure how.      Should i seek therapy? I have already checked my credit report and what not, but i always seem to just tell myself it just hasnt happened YET

I've asked a few questions like this before, but now i have more detailed informtion.      1. filling   2.brace to close gap in the front of my teeth   3.franetomy   4.upper bond retainer to hold teeth togetter and a removable retainer worn at night.      Cost is ￡1,350. I was firstly told by the dentist himself that it would cost ￡1,200, so the price is ok, but i was also told that it would take about 6-9 months. Now a receptionist says it could take up to 2 years.   I was really hoping it wouldn't take that long.

We can't seem to shake them no matter how many home remedies we try.      My question is this: can we just ignore the fact that they're there, and eat the worm-infested food anyway? Would there be any ill effects of consuming, probably, 20-30 larvae per day?      We're not squeamish about it (we overcame this by realizing how much money we were wasting by throwing away full packets of wormy food, and buying more only to have the same thing happen again!), we just want to know if it's safe.      Thank you
20090223061747AAMnTO4	Health;Optical	Bad contact prescription, plus bad business!?	This Saturday I went to the eye dr to get contacts, the Dr took about 5 minutes for the exam, and told me my prescription had changed, I thought nothing of it, put the contacts on, everything was a little blurry, but was told that would be normal, as my eyes had to adjust to the new prescription, but when I got home and couldn't even see my laptop which was sitting on my lap with the contacts on, I knew that something wasn't right. I was pushed to order a years worth of these contacts, the guy at the desk kept telling me I had to order them today, that they couldn't just release my prescription to me. So I ordered them. I went back to the Dr's Sunday, and the guy at the desk wouldn't even let me talk to the dr, the place was empty, there was one person in there picking out frames, he told me to come back sometime this week. I asked him not to place the order for my contacts just yet, and to please wait for me to see the dr, to make sure everything was right with the prescription, He told me he couldn't hold the order, and that I would have to sort this matter out at another time. What should i do? I just checked my recipet and there is no return or exchange for contacts, and I can't go to see the Dr again until Tuesday. I feel now that i paid in full, these people are not going to work with me, to get this matter straightened out!

It's a normal twin size and I count the four leg things the mattress and the two...um I'm not sure...the two wooden "bridges" that connect the legs.   All together makes seven.      My window.   The four wood frames and one that is in the middle separating the two actual glass windows.   All together? seven.      Down the hallway seven steps.    From the very entrance of the living room to the front door seven steps.   Six pieces of furniture in my room   Four in the bathroom.   Nine pieces of furniture in the living room      This is something I count like daily if I'm in that room and to be honest I am freaking tired and disgusted because I've had these problems before, not same but similar.

I am a 22 year old and I dont have ANY insurance. I have a swollen cheek and a possibly infected gum where my wisdom tooth is trying to come in. I have put this off for 2 years now and I just cant now that It is swelling and making eating difficult. I called around and all the offices want me to apply for CareCredit which is a credit card that pays them, but you pay them. It has like a 22.9 percent interest rate and I dont want another credit card. I DONT want to go to a university and get this pulled by students so please, dont suggest that.

20090223072208AA3BApC	Health;Dental	Lower teeth hurt.. Can it be illness related?	I'm just recently getting over probably the worst virus that I have had in my life. (Sore throat, chills, ect.)       The sore throat is FINALLY subsiding, but naturally my sinus' are stuffed like no other.       So bad that my ear hurts sometimes on my left side, as well as my teeth on the left side. (ONLY when I chew)       My question essentially is: Is it normal for ones teeth to hurt only while chewing when sick?       My teeth were fine before I became sick. Just yesterday this started up. My teeth are not sensitive to air, hot, nor cold. No swelling of the gums. Just when I chew.

I'm not looking for someone to tell me that, I'm looking for help.  I took Pristiq, (an anxiety medicine) for about a month, stopped and was told by the dr to take one every other day for three days and then switch to lexapro. Last friday I went to a party and did Meth for the first time, ( I will never again.) didn't sleep at all  and then saturday afternoon couldn't stand up I was so sick/dizzy. Saturday night I had horrible hallucinations. I started out my window for five hours then called the cops, I thought someone was going to shoot me. Sunday I just all around don't feel good, today (monday) I am just dizzy.. I don't know if this is from the meth, or the switching of meds. I don't want to tell my dr, I just need to know what meth first time side effects are and how long they last I guess... Thanks!

20090223074718AA42udZ	Health;Diseases & Conditions;Other - Diseases	Servere Headaches all the time?	I've had enough now and no-one seems to be helping! I suffer from alot of headaches, and what ever pain killers I take it don't work, not even the tablet that the doc put me on sumatriptan and topamax, and I darnt even go back yet to tell her its not working because she must think Im a right pain in the ***... I've been to see two neurologist, the first neurologist did a mri scan on my brain and said everything was okay, that i had two white dots on my brain, but since I was born premature he said it unsignificant could be down to that it might be scarring and that he aint going to look into it as he thinks its nothing wrong.... but something clicked just recently I had a mri scan two years ago when my headaches first started because i fell down the stairs and they said that my scans where clear and showed me my scans there was nothing on there what so ever... both neurologist one was someone who worked for him... said that it is down to having really bad migrains... which I explained this to the doctor a 4 days ago and she passed it off saying well try the medication first it will work the first tablet you take !!! yeah right!!!      But what I want to know is there anything to control a headache that is ever single day and is now affecting my sleep, the tables that the doc put me on not working, with theses headaches I am constantly tired, i am being sick in the morning and at night i have really bad dizziness, and i tend to be falling over and bumping into things near enough all the time.... this to me does not sound like something to do with migrains as painkillers are not working at all.... though the last neurologist told me to take asperin... untill reasently it seemed to be helping to some what extent, taking my sickness away, and somewhat dizziness and the falling over but not the headaches just the sharpness. leaving the pressure and heavyness... I just need some advice and some ideas how to approch the heath sevice over this because I dont want to look a prat being concerned about my own health and dont want to find out that i've got something wrong with me and they messed around to long that its too late...

I've been so sick and went to the doctor earlier this month. I had a whole bunch of blood tests done, one of them being the anti nuclear antibodies. The test came back positive (1:640 with speckled and homogeno pattern). My doctor then ordered more tests which she said were specific to lupus. She said the tests came back negative and that the iron deficiency anemia is whats causing my ANA to come back positive....this doesn't seem possible to me. I've never felt so sick in my life. Ive had iron deficiency on and off all of my adult life and I've never felt like this before. Anyone know if she's right?

20090222123447AA2wsb5	Health;Mental Health	Psychiatric Nurse Practitioner?	So, I'd like to become a Psychiatric Nurse Practitioner.   My goal is to work in a Private Practice, rather than in a hospital setting.      I'm a senior in high school, and I'm entering college to major in Psychology.    I know that I have to have my BSN to go to Master's School, but there are Entry-Level Masters in Nursing programs for people who have a degree in a field other than nursing.. And I don't really want to be a RN. I just want to be an APNP, because they seem to have more opportunities than someone with their Master's in Psychology.      Are these programs difficult to get into? I know BC offers the program specifically for Psychiatric NP, but should I just say screw it, and start a Nursing degree instead of a Psychology degree?   I don't really want to be a nurse, just a APNP, and I would rather not spend four years in Nursing school, when I can just go on to get my Masters in APNP later, without it.         Also, any additional information on APNP would be helpful. Like, salary, freedom, etc.

20090222161200AAChpa1	Health;Mental Health	I require PROFESSIONAL ADVICE on the unhappy behaviours of my 3 1/2 Year old son...Please help!?	From the beginning, my son was 2 and a half and my best friend and her son (SAME AGE) moved in with me and my son.  Cooper (My son) has always been a VERY gentle and loving but mostly HAPPY little boy with a sparkle in his eye and lots of love for everyone. Never demonstrated terriblr twos, jealousy, aggression NOTHING!  Pushed the normal boundaries of exploration ofcourse.  Her son on the other hand was a violent, aggressive, angry, loud kid who was CONSTANTLY and i mean around 9 times a day HURTING cooper.  Bting to draw blood on ears, face, arms back, scratchong, pinching, punching, swearing and elling aggressively, pushing etc etc.  Where cooper tried to have fun ''?ink oink Im a piggy!" Cayleb would hit him and angrily yell SHUTUP UR NOT A PIGGY UR A BOY!  Everything my son knew to be natural, innocent, happy and fun behaviour he was put down for and made to feel terrible.  He still, regardless of all this, loved this kid and his mother.  A year has passed and we moved to a new town together.  Things got so much worse.  I took Cooper and found a place of our own.  Now he is depressive, grumpy, over sensitive, cant joke around, lost his sparkling nature.  He gets angry and has lost his great attention span and concentration skills he once had.  He is just negative and all round not a happy kid anymore.  He doesnt get ANY kid interaction since we moved to a new town and dont know anyone yet but je is enrolled in daycare 2 days a week and is NOT settling in! He LOSES IT CPMPLETELY when I leave and when the other boys see this they dont want to be his mates.  He is lonely.  He is such a loving and smart kid I'm SO scared this is going to damage him further at school, with learning and socialising etc.  I need some advice on wherer to go from here.  I have made my new hom a peaceful and stress free home for him to feel safe and happy now that they r nolonger in his life.  He needs to be reassured he CAN be outgoing, loud and fun and that he WONT get in trouble for it!  WHat should I do??????

I'm on birth control and take it everyday around the same time (within a 30 minute to one hour time frame of the previous day but never hours late or anything) everyday. I always try to ensure that I use another form of protection(ie condoms) but I didn't yesterday when my bf and I had sex(and he ejaculated inside =/) and now I'm feeling paranoid about it. I know the pill isn't 100% so maybe I'm just a bit worried. The same thing happened once last month but my period came on just fine. I'm not due to get it again for another 2 weeks so I'd have to wait if anything did happen. I know all about std's(thanks). I was going to take Plan B but that's just a much stronger birth control pill and I've been taking mine consistently everyday so it wouldn't matter. Am I just being too paranoid or? TIA! =)

So an appointment was scheduled for me and my friend Michael (six at the time), unknowingly to us... The day before the appointment, my mom tried to explain to me what was going to happen at the hospital (she didn't do a very good job of it, or I would have fled immediatly), but me in my youthful ignorance, didn't quite grasp the severity of the situation... On that fateful day, me and mike, plus Mike's mom and my Mom arrived at the hospital. Now Mike's mom failed also to tell Michael what was about to happen, so we sat in the waiting room, thinking that we were about to go in for a routine checkup, or maybe get one of those dreaded shots, but when two nice nurses came to get us, we had a sixth sense that everything was not as it should be... We were ushered into a bigger than normal examinatin room with two tables seperated by a curtain. I sat one on, while Michael say on the other one. The nurses helped us take off all of our clothes (minus out Batman and Toy Story underwear), then a nice friendly doctor came in and snapped on a pair of surgical gloves (the sound of iniment pain that was soon to follow...). Mike was the first one to realize our position, and I'll tell you what, when he realized what they were about to do to our manhood, he put up a fight like you would not believe. In the end though, the process was completed with both myself and Michael screaming in pain, and our dear sweet mothers chatting away in the waiting room (they were actually with us the whole time, but did nothing to help the severity of the situation). That is why I have a rational fear of Hospitals, doctors and nurses (as well as my mom) to this very day... Hope you enjoyed the story (this actually happened btw), and can anyone relate to this?

I find it boring. I feel like I'm constantly underwater, drowning or something..      We were watching a video in class and a girl who was depressed was saying that no one has 2 months of bad days. I'm at 2-3 weeks straight of bad days. It worries me.      I was also talking to my mom  who is a psychologist. I told her we were studying depression in school and I was curious. I asked if a person can get depressed and not know it. She said that yes, because people just feel dull (check) they feel uninterested in the world (check) and they don't remember feeling any different (sort of check, I don't have a good memory.)      I know that in the past when I am under a lot of stress I lose interest in my friends like I am now. I wonder if I am just stressed out?

Her family though, doesn't notice it because they tend to even at meals, eat very little and mostly vegetables. My cousin has to drive her bike to school everyday (her school is 3km away) and in the time she is at school she only eats an apple. I had a really bad conscience because the before last time I visited her, I was anorexic too and I must say she takes me a bit as a role model. Last time I saw her though, I explained that last time I had had a disorder and the weight I have today is normal and perfect. Believe me, I know the habits of anorexia and i noticed them on her. Her family seems to be blind about it, and even my parents have talked to them about it. Her mother says: "Well she is very thin, but that's because she does a lot of sports. I think she is beautiful that way!!" Help! i dont know what to do, since we live in different countries! Please could you give me advice on the situation??

She doesnt like my boyfriend and has bad mouthed him to people and i cannot bring him home to her house (where i go every 3 weeks and xmas, easter and any other special holidays..i have to be separated from my partner). She has fought and said nasty things to her family (brothers and sisters) and now they all exclude her from family events..so she has no one. She soemtimes turns up at family events and then they ring me and tell me the nasty things she said or done even though i cannot control where she goes. that has lead to me cutting those aunts and uncles out too...as they have never been a support to me only to tell me how nasty she behaves. One aunt rings me up and tells me word for word the nasty things shes said about me and to her and then tells me not to repeat it as shes doesnt want to get ate by her. This leaves me so upset. My dad says i should do more aswell, although i do all i can with her. I've spoken to her doctors and nurses and they say she is just dfficult and wil not change and she is under their care. She tries to control me and people just tell me i'm an adult and to stand up to her wickedness, but i feel shes acting out of desperation and i dont want to upset her more. My dad then also says i'm not to stand up to her and make his life more difficult. He says hes the one dealing with her dailly while i live 60 miles away, so he thinks i should be doing more.

20090223064848AAXDqp1	Health;Dental	Hurting Gums after a cleaning about a month ago?	It is Feb. 23 2009 and on Feb. 4 2009 I went in for a routine dental cleaning. I get a cleaning every six months and have been doing this since I was old enough to go to the dentist. I am 25 years old and have never had dental problems besides the typical cavity and i had braces when I was very young. It was a new hygienist to my office and almost a month later my gums are still hurting from this cleaning. It was the most aggressive cleaning I have ever experienced in my entire life. Since the cleaning using mouthwash, the same brand I have been using for over a year, stings the hell out of my gums and I can not eat any type of mildly spicy food anymore without pain. Coffee makes my gums have a burning feeling. I have never ever experienced this before and have always had a clean bill of health after every dentist appointment. I have been seeing the same dentist since I was 5 years old and this is the first time. What is wrong with my mouth? Can anything be done to get rid of this pain?

I have heard that the pill can help give you lighter periods, does anyone use it for this reason.  I am not sexually active so I hadn't really considered it too much in the past.  It seems like recently that midol isn't strong enough anymore and I get physically sick (nauseous, vomiting, etc) when I get my periods, and I need to do something about it.   Just for extra info, I have tried pretty much everything on the market, primrose oil, extra strength midol, herbal remedies, changing up my diet...  The only way I get through is taking double amounts of extra strength midol, a heating pad, and lots of sleep.   Also blood clots run in my family, though I have never had any problems.  Would this be something to worry about?   Thanks for any advice!
20090223072623AAGXcNK	Health;Women's Health	Cyst aspiration, what is it going to be like?	I had an ultrasound done and my doctor told me there are non-cancerous cysts in my breast but if it's painful to get it removed. Now I know they drain it with a needle but do they just numb the area or are they kind of drugging me as well? I'm not too nervous but I'd like to know what to expect. The surgeons office told me they will give me a "local" but I'm not quite sure what that is i.e. laughing gas type of drug or a light anesthetic. Also can I expect pain after? thanks for answering.

Ok, i have this cousin, who keeps on annoying me about how she wishes she were taller,personally i think she is fine at her height which is 5'4". She is 17 and i tell her more than likely she is done growing but she says that she can still grow until she is 21 & will become taller because of some supplement she's taking.  I'm just wondering if that's true, or was my cousin tricked into buying something that won't work

I drink a bit, I eat about as healthy as the next person, some days is fast food other days its a good meal. Is it due to bad blood flow or something? I have no idea of the inner workings :P Any advice?

20090223073311AA6kj8n	Health;General Health Care;Injuries	What did I do to my calf ?	I'm a 36 year old male- I went with my family to the park yesterday and was pushing my kid's on the swings when an adult family member asked me to push them- Well not using the best judgment I pushed him (200lbs)   using my whole body trying to go up & underneath attempting the /Underdog maneuver . I immediately felt a pop & pain in my left calf- I iced it for an hour within 30 minutes & have stayed off it for the most part for the past 17 hours- I can walk only VERY slow and feel the most pain when the area is flexed or stretched such as going up & down the stars ( no Choice there)  - I missed work today & have never had such a severe pull or strain ??......in this area- There is no obvious swelling or bruising - How long should I expect this to heal ? Should I continue Ice at this point or try some heat ? Thanks for any sound advice- Anyone who has suffered a similar injury would be helpful too-
